CHAPTER I.
It was a dark stormy night, and the wind was sweeping
in gusts down the deserted streets of the town of Hawk.
stone, when Mr. Bentley, the young curate, was startled
as he was sinking into his first sleep by a strange distant
sound, mingling confusedly in the pauses of the wind, and
growing louder and louder. He rose up on his elbow,
and, after listening for a few moments, sprung from his
bed, threw open the window, and through the trampling
of feet, and the hoarse, broken clamor of a crowd, he
caught distinctly the cry of fire. In a few moments, a
man, breathless and half dressed, ran down the street,
knocking and ringing at the doors. Windows were
thrown open, and anxious terrified faces were thrust out,
calling for information to the watchmen who were hurry.
ing by. The fire-bell rang. The hollow iron rattle of
the engine was heard, as it galloped past amidst the
cracking of whips and the cries of the men and boys who
had seated theniselves about it; and on going to another
part of the house Bentley saw at once a red, lurid glare,
which showed him where the calamity had occurred.
Bentley was neither a cool nor a courageous man;
but he was a man of warm sensibility, and the curate of
the parish; and he lost no time in flinging on his clothes
and hastening to the spot. As he was running down the
steps of his house, Mrs. Alsop, the old woman who
managed his little household, cried after him to give him
his hat, and inquire if she should make up the blue bed,
in case it should be wanted by any of the sufferers.
" Yes, yes," was the reply, " and get mine ready too.
Any thing you can think of for them, poor souls." . And
the next minute he was out of sight.

A fireman who was running for more help told him,
as he passed, that the fire was in Barton Row; and
Bentley soon made his way to the spot, through a
labyrinth of dark courts and filthy alleys, which few
persons knew of in Hawkstone but himself and the
miserable beings whom he visited there. As he turned
into one of these narrow passages, a strong red light at
the end fell on a crowd of terrified faces, who were gazing
on the scene of destruction; and the cries of " More
water!" " More hose !" " Move the ladders!" " Pump
away!" mingled with oaths, and screams, and the
roaring of the flames, and the howling of the wind, struck
a cold chill upon him, and almost broke his resolution to
go nearer; for Bentley, as we said before, was a man of
feeling rather than a man of courage. But as he stopped,
and leaned for a moment against the wall, a wild piercing
shriek was heard; the flames shot up suddenly above
the roofs, and as a cry of terror and anguish burst from
the crowd, Bentley found himself, he scarcely knew how,
standing in sight of the burning building. And the sight
was sickening. The house which was on fire itself
was one of a dingy red-brick row, such as grow up in
the suburbs of manufacturing towns, and, having been
originally intended for decent occupants, become by
degrees, the abode of numerous poor families, who each
tenant a single room, and hide, under an exterior of some
pretension, a degree of poverty, misery, and vice, greater,
perhaps, than exists in huts and hovels. The fire had
begun in the ground room, and had been discovered in
time to permit the escape of a crowd of wretched, hag.
gard men and women, bearing naked children in their
arms, and endeavouring to save as treasures the dirty
bedding, the clothes, stools, kettles, and rugs,
which
formed all their property in the world. All were supposed
to have escaped; and they had gathered in groups at a
distance from the fire, the children cowering round their
parents, and the parents endeavouring to wrap them from
the cold, and to place them as guards over the little
property they had saved; while, as the flames made their
way from room to room, they looked on with a face

almost of desperate unconcern, as if, for beings so
destitute and wretched, it mattered little what fate awaited
them, the fire or the famine.
The first floor had already fallen in; the lower part
of the staircase was destroyed, and the firemen, hopeless
of saving the house, were beginning to play on the
adjoining buildings, when, to the horror of the crowd, a
boy, about fourteen years old, was seen shrieking for
help at one of the garret windows. At the same moment
a man and woman half clad rushed to the house, and,
but for the interposition of the firemen, would have thrown
themselves into the flames. " My child! my child ! save
my child! O God! save my child! save him! save him!
O God! O God!" were the sounds that reached Bentley's
ear just as he gained the spot. The man, a strong
muscular swarthy ruffian, struggled with the desperation
of a maniac to escape from the policeman, who held him
back from rushing into certain destruction. The woman,
held back likewise, fell down upon her knees before
Bentley, saying, " Save him! save him! let me go! I
have a right to go! he is my child! save him! save him!
my child! my child!" till Bentley, in an agony of distress,
burst from her, and she sunk down in a fit. "Ten
guineas! twenty guineas! a hundred guineas!" he cried,
(his whole stipend was scarcely more,)" any thing, only
save the boy." No one answered.
" Is it impossible?"
Yes, sir," said the man, with a dead hollow voice,
who was working at the engine, "it is impossible; no
one could get up the ladder through the flames. It is
quite out of the question; God help it!"
And the poor man, who had children of his own;
fairly burst into tears.
"Try-make an effort," returned Bentley.
6 Can't be," said the man;
we must submit to God's
will; God have mercy on it! Look at the ladder, sir;
look there!"
And Bentley saw a burst of fire from the windows
wrap it round and round like a whirlwind, just as the
father, who, by one gigantic effort, had cast off his

detainers, had mounted a few yards from the ground, and
fell back as if blasted.
" Take the ladder away! take it away," cried the
fireman. " It's no use: the next house has caught.
More water! more water!"
And with that sturdy sense of command which
Englishmen even in the lowest post of authority exercise
over their feelings when engaged in official duties, he
was proceeding to push aside Bentley, who was even
thinking of making the attempt himself, and to remove
the ladder, when a stranger made his way through the
crowd. He was a man tall, vigorously formed, and with
all those marks of high birth and commanding mind
which the lower orders so instinctively recognise and
obey. There was a quietness and steadiness in his
movements which contrasted strongly with the tumult about
him; and even Bentley, a man of education and religion,
felt himself in the presence of a superior, and was un-
consciously abashed at his own agitated state of feeling.
" Let the ladder stay, my good fellow," said the
stranger gently; " let it stay. I have a protection here
against the flames; hold it fast at the bottom, and let
me mount." And the words were uttered in a tone of
command which threw the firemen back. He stopped
to put on a pair of thick gloves and a mask of wire over
his face; knelt down for a moment as in prayer,
folded
his hands over his cheeks, and those who stood near
asserted that he made the sign of the cross on his
forehead, and then sprung up the ladder before the by-
standers had recovered themselves to interfere. He had
seized the moment when a fall of one of the inner walls
had lulled the flames, which were bursting round him;
and the crowd, who were looking on with intense anxiety,
hailed him with a loud cheer as he reached the window.
The boy had already disappeared, having sunk down
stupified with the smoke and with terror. The window
was closed and fastened within; but the glass was
broken, and the stranger, with all his strength, tore away
sufficient of the woodwork to obtain an entrance. As
he disappeared within the room, ancther volley of flame

und smoke broke forth from the floor beneath, and cries
of * Make haste! make haste! the floor is falling! for
God's sake, make haste! save yourself!" burst from the
people, followed by a tremendous cheer as he appeared
on the sill of the window with the boy wrapt up in a
blanket. Another moment, and it had been too late.
A frightful crush behind him announced the falling of
the floor. A heavy chimney at the side staggered,
bowed, and fell upon the ruins: and before the flames
could shoot out again, the stranger and his burden had
slided down the ladder. Scorched and nearly stified as
he was, his first act on reaching the ground was once
more to kneel down, and bury his face in his hands in
Then giving the boy to Bentley, whose
enthusiasm of admiration now was only equal to his
agony of anxiety before, he quietly fell back into the
crowd; and as they pressed about him with cries of
* God bless him! There's a fine man!
honor!" cheering him and thrusting their hands into
his, and waving their hats, he simply answered, " Thank
ye, thank ye! Will you allow me to pass ?" And
turning down the same alley through which Bentley had
come upon the spot, he was lost to sight.
"Do you know who the gentleman is?" asked
Bentley, of many of the by-standers who had gathered
round the poor man and woman, as they sat with the boy
in their arms, and watched him gradually returning to life.
" No, sir," was the general answer.
6 We never
saw him before. He is a stranger in the town."
" But he's a real gentleman," said a poor laborer to
another. " Yes, that he is," cried they all, " a real
gentleman, and that's a fine thing to say. God bless
him! say I." "God bless him!" cried another. "God
bles3 him!" murmured the poor mother, as the boy's
eyes began to open. Even the ruffian father relaxed
his surly, gloomy look, and, though he did 2100 say, "God
bless him," he muttered something about thanks, and, bid-
ding his wife look to the things, took up the boy in his arms,
and followed a poor neighbor, who had cffered a part of
her hovel as their refuge for the remainder of the night.

CHAPTER II.
On the Monday afternoon, in the week after the fire.
a sensation (to use the fashionable term) was caused in
the principal street of Hawkstone, by symptoms of an
approaching festivity in the apartments of Miss Mabel
Brook, who occupied the first-floor bow window in the
very respectable house of Messrs. Silkem the linen-
drapers. Mrs. Crump, the lame old lady who occupied
a similar bow window on the opposite side of the way,
and who, having a strong desire to know what was
passing in the world, could yet command only that
portion of the world which came within the focus of the
above mentioned window, had observed, as she informed
her maid, that the little girl from the Grey school who
waited on Miss Brook had gone out no less than three
times that morning, and returned on each occasion with
a something, (Mrs. Crump could not tell what,) but she
had her suspicions. On the first sally, Mrs. Crump had
traced her as far as her eye could stretch to the end of
the street, when she turned a corner abruptly: but in a few
minutes she came back again, and Mrs. Crump's ingenuity
immediately called to mind that there was a pastry-cook's
shop just at the distance required to account for this
temporary disappearance. On the second occasion there
had been an open visit to Mallam's the grocer before
Mrs. Crump's own eyes, and a return with a packet of
tea; whether it was green or souchong, Mrs. Crump had
been unable to ascertain. But as she knew Mrs. Brook
three days before had sent for a pound of tea to the same
shop, Mrs. Crump inferred that could not yet be
exhausted, and that the new importation was probably
green tea for company. The third expedition, at about
four o'clock P. M., baffled Mrs. Crump completely. The
little grey-clad abigail vanished at the end of the street,
and when she returned she was accompanied by two
other abigails clad in the same uniform, and bearing

23
prodigious packages of some mysterious article wrapt
up in white linen. In vain the old lady rubbed her
spectacles, wiped the window, moved from one pane to
the other; the contents of these portentous packages
were impervious to her eyes. The Grey girls and the
packages both disappeared at the side door of Messrs.
Silkem's premises; the door closed upon them, and, in a
fit of desperation, Mrs. Crump returned to her elbow.
chair, pulled the bell rope, which was tied to it, and
desired her maid immediately to go over, with her love
to Miss Brook, and inquire how she did this evening.
" You can find out," she said, " from her servant, by
the by, whether Miss Brook has company to tea."
No distressed lady in Mrs. Crump's predicament was
ever blessed with an Iris more anxious to fulfil a task,
which involved an occasional gossip, than Mrs. Crump's
Martha, and, after a little delay, which provoked no little
irritation in her impatient mistress, she returned with the
announcement that Miss Brook had company to tea, and
that she was expecting no less than ten ladies.
" Ten!" interrupted Mrs. Crump; " why, where is
she to put them?"
Martha, who was out of breath, proceeded.
the great monthly meeting of the Hawkstone Dorcas or
Benevolent Lying-in Union Society, of which Miss Mabel
was the honored secretary, and most active supporter;
and there was to be Mrs. Thompson, and the Miss Mac-
dougals, and Mrs. and young Miss Maddox; and muffins,
and tea-cake, and wine and water afterwards. And the
sofa had been uncovered, and the window curtains put
up. And Mr. Peachit, the gardener, had sent some
flowers for the chimney-piece, and Miss Brook was 60
busy, with her table covered with flannel, and nightcaps,
and gingham, and all sorts of things;-and the company
were expected almost directly." To all this, to the great
disappointment of Martha, Mrs. Crump only answered,
pish," and the "pish" was repeated at the close ;
accompanied, however, it must be confessed, with a
rubbing of the spectacles and an advancement of the
wheeled chair to the window, for the purpose, it

presumed, of obtaining ocular demonstration of the arrival
of the visiters. But the "pish " implied much. It implied,
first, that Mrs. Crump was not a member of the Dorcas
or Benevolent Lying-in Union Society ; secondly, that
she was no friend to it; thirdly, that she was, as she
delighted to say, one of the old school. She did not think
that any good ever came from such societies. She did
not like mixing with Dissenters; the Miss Macdougalls
were Presbyterians, and the Maddoxes Unitarians ; she
liked the good old way, and kept to the Church, as her
father and mother had done before her; and if dozing
regularly every morning over the psalms and lessons,
attending regularly in her pew at church every Sunday,
and even on Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Saints' days,
and giving her annual mite to the National schools, and,
we may add, playing her nightly rubber with Dr. Grant,
the old paralytic rector, constituted a friend to the Church,
no one could be relied on for more determined support
than Mrs. Crump. And yet on the "pish " there followed
something like a sigh ; and as the old lady sat watching
for the first arrival, she fell into a soliloquy on the evils
of a solitary old age, when there were no children to
repay the care of their youth, and society treated her as
a burthen, and weak health and advancing infirmities
prevented her from engaging in any active occupation
either of business or amusement. There was, indeed,
to relieve the heavy days which dragged on without
change and without hope, an occasional morning call
(few they were, and far between) from Miss Mabel Brook,
and the other dowagers of the town. And at times, one
or two of the younger ladies charitably reminded each
other that they ought to call on poor Mrs. Crump. And
once or twice in the month, Martha, who knew how her
mistress required some relief to her monotonous existence,
would entrap a stray nursery maid with Mrs. Thompson's
little girls, or Mrs. Jones' baby; and, as the old lady
crawled to her cupboard for the slice of sweet cake, or
made them sit down at her feet to show them the
wonders of her worsted work, a tear would stand in her
eyes at the thought of what had been denied to herself

a child, a grandchild, any being whom she might look
to for support, and love and watch over, and think on as
a second self, instead of hanging upon a cold neglectful
world, without interest, and without affection, until the
grave closed over her head. And another thought
sometimes struck her, little as her mind was formed to
deeper reflection, that God could not have intended such
things to be; that if he were, as she devoutly believed, a
God of love, and Christianity were designed by him to be
a blessing to all mankind, there might be somewhere in
its system, when rightly brought out, a provision for
destitution like hers, and that something might be deficient
in a Church which left her the widow, the laboring with
sickness, the desolate, the all but oppressedwhom it
prayed for, as one of its especial objects of care-with
no consolation but a Bible, as little understood as it was
monotonously perused; and no fixed task of duty but her
worsted work, and the feeding of her cat; no one bound
to attend on her but the hired Martha; and, saving one
day in seven, no aid or comfort to her devotion, but once
or twice a hurried service in a cold and desolate church,
with no one, perhaps, but the children in the Grey school
gallery, and poor Betty Foyle, the blind old woman from
the almshouse, to join in offering praises and thanksgiving,
for a population of thousands.
Whether or not the old lady's soliloquy would liave
terminated thus, we cannot presume to say; for it was
interrupted by the first arrival at Miss Mabel Bruok's
soire, in the person of the two Miss Morgans, the
pretty daughters of the principal surgeon in the town of
Hawkstone.
And here we must apologise once for all for our
inability to amuse our readers, and especially that
privileged class who dwell in parks and villas, places,
halls, and courts, at a distance from the vulgar town, for
our inability to supply them with the usual facetious
catalogue of odd characters, and still odder names with
which modern art has loaded the population of our
country towns. Hawkstone, indeed, like all other places
of human resort, had its characters; and those characters

had names.
But we lament, for the sahe of our 16
Itaders,
that they were little remarkable in any way. If they
could not boast of Fitz's, and Ville's, and Saints, and De's,
neither were they afflicted with the unseemly appellatives
of Hobbs and Dobbs, Simkins or Scroggins. They
were, in fact, fair, ordinary specimens of the middle class
of English people ; neither very clever nor very stupid,
very vulgar nor very polished, very enlarged in their
notions nor very narrow. In one point they resembled
all English people alike. They acknowledged an im-
plicit submission for the little world in which they
moved ; anxiously aspiring to the notice of its leaders,
and condescendingly patronizing all who came beneath
themselves ; and measuring the whole fate and character
of the vast terra incognita beyond them by the opinions,
acts, and vicissitudes of their own little coterie. Perhaps,
indeed, the Dorcas Society could not pretend to include
exactly the lite of Hawkstone ; for there were several
little suburban villas in the neighborhood, which being
uncontaminated by pavement and gas lamps, aspired to
a claim to rurality, and held somewhat aloof from the
decidedly town population. But still it was composed of
" respectables," in that sense of the word which perhaps
might be properly rendered " without a shop." Besides
the Miss Morgans, the surgeon's daughters, there was
Mrs. Lomax, the banker's wife, who officiated as presi-
dent ; the Miss Macdougalls, who tenanted the large
brick house with five windows in front, and a coach-
house and garden, at the north entrance of the town; Mrs.
and Miss James, who had recently retired from the super-
intendence of a very respectable seminary for young
ladies ; Mrs. Hancock, the wife of Capt. Hancock, an
officer on half pay, who continued to vegetate in a neat
little verandaed cottage in the outskirts of the town; and
the Maddoxes, whom their father's success in trade had
placed in easy circumstances, and left them abundance,
both of time and money, to devote to the charities of
Hawkstone. And one after another they arrived at Miss
Mabel's door ; and though Mrs. Crump, who was by no
means a favorable critic, did detect about them all a

little bustle of serious importance, more than the occa.
sion required ; and Miss James had pun into her cap
rather a gayer display of flowers than suited the sobriety
of her age ; and the Miss Macdougalls looked somewhat

in making her footboy follow her with a work-basket and

ance, and nothing to ridicule. And any one who could
have seen the hearty welcome with which Miss Mabua
received them, and the kind mutual greetings of t1.e
party, and the cheerfulness with which they produced
work-boxes and baskets, scissors and needles, and
ranged them on the green cloth of Mabel's largest table,
would think it a very ill-placed satire which attempted to
caricature such a charitable meeting, assembled, as
inodern philanthropy delights to express it, without dis-
tinction of sect or party, to promote the comfort and
relieve the wants of their fellow-creatures.
Of the whole party no was so pleased as
Mabel herself. It was the first time that she had been
enabled, by a removal into a new lodging, to entertain
the Dorcas Society in her single room. And earnest
were her pains to make her guests comfortable and
happy; and visible the satisfaction, notwithstanding all
her pains to suppress it, with which she received the
congratulations of the Miss Morgans on her cheerful
view of the High Street, so close to the Crown Inn,
where she might see every day no less than three
coaches stop and change horses ; and Mrs. Lomax's
panegyric on the prettiness of her sofa coverings; and
Miss James's admiration of the silver tea-pot, the only
relic saved from the wreck of her father's little property ;
and the praise which all bestowed on the delicious tea-
cakes and excellent cream. Every one seemed anxious
to say something which would please and flatter her ;
for Mabel was a general favorite.
She was the only daughter of an officer in the navy
who had died at an advanced age, leaving Mabel,
neither young nor beautiful, with his blessing and a
very small annuity, to make the remainder of her way

through the troubles of the world hy ber own exertions.
By dint of the strictest economy, she contrive:) soon to
bring her wants and wishes within the compass of sixty
pounds a year. High spirits and active habits engaged
her in a variety of occupations which filled up her time,
and absorbed both past and future, so far as anxiety or
sorrow was concerned, in the interests of the present ;
and an inexhaustible fund of good humor and good nature
made her invaluable to the little society of Hawkstone.
It was Miss Mabel who undertook the management of
the National Schools ; Miss Mabel who was secretary
and chief mover, not only of the Dorcas Society, but of
all the ladies' societies which flourished with a mush-
room growth at Hawkstone ; the Ladies' Branch Bible
Society, the Ladies' Anti-Cruelty-to-Animals Society,
the Ladies' Book Society, the Ladies' Association for
the Conversion of the Jews, the Ladies' District-Visiting
Society, the Ladies' Penitentiary, the Ladies' Female
Orphan, and Deaf and Dumb, and Pastoral Aid, and
General-Religious-Purpose Society. None could flourish,
and few had originated, without Miss Mabel ; her whole
soul was in doing good. And if there mixed with this
ardor of sincere benevolence some little bustle and
over-zeal, and no little ignorance as to the right mode
of doing good, it was the fault not so much of Mabel
herself, as of the age in which she was born ; and which
her own warmth of feeling and delight at the excitement
of charity in which she had involved herself, represented
to her as a model of wisdom and a Paradise of newly
discovered virtues. Nor was her benevolence confined
to public life.
How she contrived to do so much no one
could understand ; but scarcely a respectable family in
Hawkstone was ignorant of the value of her services. It
Mrs. Jones was ill, Miss Mabel would come and spend
the day and take care of the children. If a deatn
occurred in a family, Miss Mabel was the first looked to
for assistance in those melancholy moments ; if a wedding,
Miss Nabel assisted in distributing the bride-cake ; if a
children's dance, at Mrs. Lomax's, Miss Mabel was the
first who arrived to help in putting the young ones il

motion, and the last who remained to see the candles put
out, when the wearied hostess had retired to bed, and
Mr. Lomax had shaken both her hands with a hearty
wish that every one could be so useful. And in all this,
there was neither conceit nor pretension ; simply the
overflowing of a kindly-disposed heart, which could not
rest without doing something, and happily was most
pleased when that something contributed, as she hoped,
to the comfort of her kind friends and neighbors.
And having arrived at this point, it is high time to re-
lieve the apprehensions which our fair readers, who care
nothing for a story not strewed thick with lords and
ladies, Almack's and diamonds, will feel, when our talk
seems likely to be of market towns, and Mrs. Crumps,
Dorcas Societies, and flannels. They need be under no
alarm lest Miss Mabel Brook, much as we have enlarged
her merits, should be the intended heroine of our tale ; or
Jest we should already have destined her to pair off, after
*rials and temptations, with either Mr. Bentley or the un-
known stranger of the fire. Miss Mabel is by no means
an unimportant personage, but she is not the most im-
portant.
And they will be rejoiced to learn at once, that our
heroine will be a real lady, such as a heroine should be.
Not as if the middle walks of life were contemptible, and
had no joys or sorrows, duties or virtues, to excite our
sympathies and interest ; but because, where goodness
does exist accompanied with rank and birth, it exists in a
higher and nobler form than in an humbler station. It is
a grievous mistake to think that the highest ranks of so-
ciety are the only objects worth attention, or to underva-
lue the middle classes. But it is an equal mistake to make
society rest on the foundation of the middle classes, or to
suppose that leading minds, minds fitted to command and
rule, will be found, except by some extraordinary accident,
in any but men whom nature, from their birth, has placed
on an eminence, and accustomed them to receive the
homage of the world as their birthright, without either
vanity to court is affectation to disclaim it. To Miss
Mabel, however, we must return And cheerful as she

seemed, laughing with one, and arranging flannel with
another, and pressing another cup of tea upon a third, it
might be remarked that her eye glanced often to the door,
and then to an old easy chair, stationed in the warmest
corner of the room, and provided with a cushion and a
footstool, which no one yet had presumed to occupy. She
was evidently anxious for another arrival.
" We shall see Mrs. Bevan, I hope, to-night," said
Mrs. Lomax, with a tone of sincerity.
"I trust she is coming," subjoined Miss Macdougall, in
a voice which implied no regret if she were to remain
away.
"What can make her so late ?" continued Mrs. Mad-
dox, with something of censoriousness in her manner.
And even Mabel began to wonder at her absence, not
without some secret misgivings as to the desirableness of
her presence.
And yet, if there was one person in the
world whom Mabel venerated, it was Mrs. Beran; who
on the death of Captain Brook had offered her the shelter
of Brookfield Parsonage ; had accustomed her to the
active duties of charity, to which she had subsequently
devoted herself, and had been to her almost a mother.
She had seen this friend pass through trial after trial with
a quiet fortitude, an undisturbed piety, and a sweetness of
temper almost angelic. Two children had been taken
from her in early life. Her husband, the Rector of
Hurst, after a life of zealous devotion to his duty, had fol-
lowed them to the grave; and she herself was now es-
tablished in Hawkstone, dividing her time between read-
ing and charity, and in both continuing to follow the prin.
ciples which her excellent husband had taught her in the
management of his parish. On the dispersion of his lit-
tle property at his death, she had contrived, at some sacri-
fice, to retain the greater part of his small but well se-
lected library, composed chiefly, like most others belong-
ing to parochial clergymen of a former generation, of the
English divines of the seventeenth century. To these
occasional additions were made by her son, who was re-
sident at Oxford, as a fellow of college. And Mrs.
Bevan having li.le taste for the trash of the circulating

vine, sufficient at least to excite the wonder of the Hawk.
stone ladies at her learning, and even, though with no
intention on her own part, to perplex Dr. Grant, and still
more Mr. Bentley, with an accidental reference or ques-
tion. One thing we must do Mrs. Bevan the justice to
add; she was no writer. She had never thought herself
competent to undertake to direct the religious world by
means of periodical papers. If she heard of erroneous
opinions rising up in the Church, she did not write letters
to the newspapers, warning her beloved countrymen
against the encroaching heresy. She left this task in the
hands where God had placed itto his own ministers.
Neither did she dare to frame prayers and meditations for
others, however much she might think they were wanted.
Still less did she relish the idea of unbosoming herself to
the public, laying bare her movements, and feelings, and
fancies, and sympathies in a memoir, or a tour, or an au.
tobiography, or any other similar form, in which young
ladies as well as young gentlemen now delight to come
forward on the stage, uncalled for and unwished for, in the
hope of obtaining some random applause. She had her
notions of domestic economy, and very good notions they
were; but political economy she left to Mr. Malthus.
And she spent no little portion of her time in the school
of Hawkstone, and had suggested many sensible im.
provements in the management of it, but if it had been
proposed to her to enlighten the world on the subject of
education, she would probably have smiled with surprise,
that any one who professed to know what education was,
should think of its being discussed by one who had never
studied the deep principles of philosophy, on which it must
be based, and without which it becomes mere quackery.
In short, Mrs. Bevan, though in her own little circle of
study she was a very well-read lady, was by no means a
literary lady. And so much the better for herself and for
those around her.
Her only compositions were her letters to her son at
Oxford and regularly once a week Charles Bevan, on his

return from morning chapel, found to his great delight a
little folio on his table, containing the news of Hawk-
stone; how the school was flourishing, how the church
was attended, how opinions were improving. And when
the vacation arrived, and they were once more seated to-
gether in the evening-Charles, with his folio, and his
paper and pencil, and his mother making his tea, or en-
gaged in the mysteries of her work-box--she was able to
enter with him into the subject nearest his thoughts, and
to talk of his dear Oxford, and the struggle which was
then commencing there against the follies of the day, and
to follow him in his plans and conjectures, and his obser-
vations on the works which it was sending forth. If, in-
deed, at first, she was startled by the earnestness and
depth of his views, her alarms were soon quieted by ob-
serving that they were quiet, diffident, and discriminating.
Many of them, new to him, were old to herself. She
could recollect the time when, every morning and eve.
ning, there was a regular service in Hawkstone church ;
when, on saints' days, a sermon had been preached, in
compliance with an old benefactionwhen the very name
of a dissenter would have been sufficient to set the popu-
lace in commotionwhen the grammar school, now sunk
into neglect, had educated the sons of all the tradesmen
and farmers around, and every day the boys might have
been seen following the master to church, to take part in
the regular service. She had known Hawkstone in its
simple unsophisticated state, before Lord Claremont had
been obliged to leave his estate at nurse in the hands of
trustees, and retire himself to the Continent--and Gen.
eral Villiers had deserted the Prioryand Mr. Smith had
discovered the capacities of Hawkstone stream, and
raised on its banks the enormous hundred-windowed fac-
tory, with its steam-engines, and spinning-jennies, and
smoking chimney, and haggard mob of occupants, which
now shocked the eye of the traveller, 0:1 his quitting the

budent populationthe distracted political partiesthe
absence of any man of birth, and property, and sound
principles, to keep the town in order, and devise means
for bringing it once more into "unity of spirit, into the
bond of peace, and into righteousness of life." With these
feelings, Mrs. Bevan could easily sympathise with her son,
when he spoke of reviving again the right moral influ.
ence of the Church; of giving it new strength and ad-
ditional arms to grasp and bring back to its boson the
thousands whom it had permitted to wanderwhen he
talked with enthusiasm of the men by whom the thought
and hope of such a consummation had been roused-
when he described the purity of their lives, the depth of
their learning, the quiet, unobtrusive way in which they
practised what they taught, and then, almost with tears in
his eyes, blessed God, who even in this wilful age had
kept from destruction those noble institutions in which the
spirit that animated them had been preserved alive, burn-
ing under a heap of ruins.
6s And so, then," some of our readers will exclaim,
"Mrs. Bevan was a Puseyite." Mrs. Bevan was a la.
dy-a lady by birth, education, habits of society, and re-
finement of mind. And no one could practise better that
quiet, dignified, but severe, castigation which such ladies
are able to bestow on impertinence and flippancy. And
the young person (for old persons do not indulge in such
vulgaritics,) who had once presumed to apply to her, within
hearing, such a silly and mischievous nickname, would
undoubtedly never have' ventured to repeat it a second
time. " But she had studied the "Tracts for the Times,'
then ?" We rather believe not. Some portions her son
had read out to her; and she admired the eloquence of
some, hesitated as to expressions in others, perhaps did
not quite like the tone of speaking here and there. But
with the principles which her late husband had inculcated
and practised, and the habitual perusal of the great stand-
ard works of the English Church, Mrs. Bevan found little
novelty in the Tracts for the Times,' and other works
of the same authors, and preferred, as the Tracts them-
selves jerommended, her own course of old divinity, to

any modern teaching, on one side or the other. And she
gladly agreed with Charles, (who, at one time, she feared,
might be led away by his personal respect for the leaders
in the new movement,) when he congratulated her that
sound doctrines were now reviving independently in se-
veral parts of the Church, and less necessity would exist
for the guidance of individual men.
All this time we are detaining our readers (we would
fain hope they are impatient readers,) from Miss Brook
and the Dorcas Society. And we must return in time to
find Miss Brook, with some disappointment in her coun.
tenance, perusing a little twisted note which had just ar.
rived to announce thai Mrs. Bevan was unable to attend.
" Is Mrs. Bevan unwell ?" said Miss Macdougall, with
rather an offended look.
"She has no engagement, 1 know," said the younger
Miss Maddox, in a tone bordering on reproach.
" We must do as well as we can without her," subjoined
Mrs. Maddox, with a sigh in which she intended to con-
vey more of sorrow than of anger.
"Does Mrs. Bevan mention any reason ?" asked Mrs.
Lomax, pacifically.
Miss Mabel looked again at the note, but no reason ap-
peared, only there was a postscript hoping to see Miss
Mabel to-morrow. The whole party sympathetically said,
" Well!" and then proceeded to commence the business
of the evening.
This has been a longer chapter than we anticipated.
And as we know that, with most of our readers, reading
is an uphill work, and their own powers of attention not
a little asthmaticthat they are either lolling in an easy
chair after eating a full dinner, or lying on a sofa in their
club-room; or, if they are young ladies, that one is tired
with reading us out, while the others are yawning over
their work-boxes and worsted frames; for all these rea-
sons we think it better to give them and ourselves a re.
spite, and to postpone the business of the Dorcas Society
till another chapter.

CHAPTER III.
And they proceeded to the business of the evening.'
This business was opened by Miss Mabel Brook,
who brought before the society the case of Mrs. Connell.
Mrs. Connell was one of the poor women who had been
burnt out by the late fire, and whose boy had been saved
from the flames. She was in great poverty. Her hus.
band was a drunken, worthless profligate ; she herself
near her confinement. And Miss Jane Morgan, who
had accidentally found her in great distress both of mind
and body, had promised to apply for relief to the Society
in her approaching illness. All voices were unanimous
in her favor. And while the bag was making up,
Miss Jane proceeded to describe her interview with the
poor woman. She had given her some money, and
added a ticket for the Dispensary, and recommended a
plaster for the face of the boy who had been scorched in
escaping from the fire. Nothing could be better. She
had also spoken to her generally on the subject of religion,
on the state of her husband, and the duty of prayer.
nd she had given her a Prayer-Book, with the service
of the visitation of the sick, and promised to mention her
state to Mr. Bentley the curate. But at these words,
Miss Brook was alarmed to see the color rising in Mrs.
Maddox's face.
"I must really beg your pardon, Miss Jane," ex-
claimed the matronly lady, " but you must know that
doing anything of the kind is contrary to the fifth rule of
the Society, which expressly says, that we are not to
attempt making proselytes.'
" Proselytes !" replied Miss Jane, slightly confused,
"I really never thought of such a thing ; she told me she
had been baptized in our Church."
" Indeed!" rejoined Mrs. Maddox : " it happens that
poor Mrs. Connell has nothing to do with your Church.
She used at one time to wash for me ; and ever since

that, I know that she has attendei our chapel ; for
every Sunday that she goes to chapel, I told her, you
know," addressing her daughters, " that she was to have
her dinner with our servants."
"Oh, yes," cried the young ladies, "I assure you
she belongs to us." And poor Miss Jane was obliged
to apologise for having given the Prayer-Book, and men.
tioned Mr. Bentley, to the poor sufferer.
"Religion, indeed," subjoined Mrs. Maddox, in a
forgiving and placable tone, " we must all inculcate in
our visits. But peculiar doctrines," she added with a
bland smile, " you know, my dear Miss Jane, we have
agreed, shall never disturb our charitable purposes."
Miss Jane, who knew nothing of religion but what she
had learned from her Prayer-Book and Catechism, and
the Bible as explained from the pulpit of Hawkstone
church, made at once a resolution to set aside those
prejudiced associations, and to form a religion for her.
self, without any peculiar doctrines, and which she might
speak of to the poor and afflicted without incurring Mrs.
Maddox's censures.
"I will go myself," said Mrs. Maddox, "and see

woman, and will not trouble you, my dear Miss
Jane, as she is one of us. And I have no doubt the
Society will be glad to give her some relief from the
money which Mr. Bentley has placed at our disposal.
( will take it to her to-morrow." And though some
slight misgiving came across Mabel at the appro.
priation of Mr. Bentley's donation from the Offertory
money, to the evident purpose of keeping Mrs. Connell
to the Unitarian chapel, all had before their eyes the
fear of being suspected of a desire to make proselytes,
and the grant was proposed and carried.
The next motion related to Betsy Trotter, and Mabel
evidently labored under some embarrassment in alluding
to it. Betsy Trotter, like Mrs. Connell, was a poor
woman; five children ; husband earning eight shillings
a week ; an honest man,-everything to recommend the

task of conveying the Society's grant to the applicant to
the hand of Miss Macdougall.
" I suppose," said that lady to Miss Mabel, " you feel
some little difficulty about Jenny ?"
And Miss Mabel owned the impeachment. It ap-
peared that Jenny Trotter had belonged to the Grey
School, one of those old-fashioned charities, which the
benevolent but illiberal founders saddled with the express
condition of their being extended only to children in
communion with the Church. Now John Trotter the
father worked regularly in Miss Macdougall's garden.
And Miss Macdougall, with a laudable zeal for the
spiritual welfare of all her dependants, had recommended
him one Wednesday evening to go and hear Mr. Bryant
at the Presbyterian chapel. She had, also, with the
same laudable zeal, lent him a number of tracts, in
which, perhaps without the lender's knowledge, the
Church of England (in which, by-the-by, poor John had
been baptized) was spoken of in no very respectful
terms ; its bishops were called tyrants and oppressors,
why and wherefore John did not know ; but never
having seen a bishop himself he could not contradict
the statement. Then the Liturgy was mere popery; and
John, who knew the history of Guy Faux by heart, was
naturally alarmed at having so long been an accom-
plice with that wicked papist. The surplice also, which
he had seen Dr. Grant and Mr. Bentley wear every
Sunday, was called a filthy rag. And though the word
seemed rather strong, John could not help acknowledging
that
very
often it was not so clean as it should be. And
having no other place to go to on a Wednesday evening
after he had finished his work, and being naturally of a
religious frame of mind, John went again and again to
the chapel. And again and again he heard Mr. Bryant
say pretty much the same as Miss Macdougall's tracts.
And a good deal of what he used to be told by Mr.
Bentley, about faith and love, and going by the Bible
only, and the worthlessness of forms and the sufficiency
of prayer to obtain the aid of God,--all this he heard from
Mr. Fryant: only Mr. Bryant said a great deal more on

38
ITAWKSTONE
points on which Mr. Bentley had never uttered a word,
and on which therefore poor John was wholly at a loss
-such as the duty of obedience to the Church, the au.
thority of bishops, the necessity of the Sacraments, and
the like. And unhappily all that Mr. Bryant said made
John look on these points as absurd and even wicked.
Then one day while he was digging a border, Mr.
Bryant, who had been paying a congregational visit to
Miss Macdougall, came by accident into the garden, and
afier asking for his wife and children, told him he was
glad to see him so often at church, and slipped half-a-
crown into his hand to buy him a Bible. And another
time he called in at John's cottage to inquire how he
did, and after talking with a sad and grieved countenance
of the spiritual destitution of Hawkstone,---only Mr.
Bentley to do all the duty, and Dr. Grant rolling in
wealth, and paying him only 901 a year,Mr. Bryant
shook his head in a melancholy way, and took his leave
with a soliloquy, which John was evidently intended to
overhear : " Alas! poor Church of England ! it ruins
more souls than it saves !" In short, we need not follow
up the steps by which John shifted his place on Sunday
from the cold wet pavement and narrow bench in the
aisle under the pulpit of Hawkstone church, and where
his face had been seen for years, to a warm comfortable
seat, provided for him by Mr. Bryant himself, in the
Presbyterian chapel. And once there, he was soon
taught to feel as much aversion for the church as he had
before felt love. And conscientious and honest as he
was, he was resolved not merely to save his own soul
by quitting an evil church, governed by those enemies to
the Gospel, bishops and archbishops, but to save his
children also. Jenny, therefore, was ordered to attend him
on Sundays to Mr. Bryant's meeting. In vain Mabel, to
whom was confided the chief superintendence of the Grey
School, condemned Jenny for her first absence from
church, and even threatened to punish her. It was her
father's order; and Mabel felt it impossible to inculcate
disobedience to parents. In vain, when the offence was
repeated, Mabel made a visit to John's rottage, ta remon

39
strate on the secession ; John was inexorable. And as
Mr. Bryant had taken care to provide his inquiring
mind with texts from scripture respecting preaching the
Gospel, and sundry difficulties about the use of the word
bishop in the epistles, besides the unanswerable question
whether St. Paul had 50,0001 a year, like the Archbishop
of Canterbury, Mabel, who knew little more of a bishop
than that he wore a wig, and sat in parliament, and was
calied my lord, and travelled about the country on rare
occasions of confirmation, was compelled to beat a re.
treat for fear of being discomfited in argument. One
more attempt she made, and then John, encouraged by
success, launched out in such violent invectives on the
Church, and every one that belonged to it, and especially
on young Mr. Bentley, whom she had taken under her
especial patronage, that, unable to suppress her indig.
nation, she pronounced on him a formal anathema ; and
at an extraordinary meeting of the Grey committee, Jenny
was dismissed from the school.
It was this which caused her present difficulty. "How
can I," as she justly remarked, " do kindnesses to persons
whom I believe to be doing wrong, who are attacking
and abusing what I most value, without leading them to
suppose that I do not think then in the wrong, or do not
verence what they abuse? I can repay with kindness
a personal injury; this is only the duty of a Christian :
but the Trotters I believe to be in commission of a sin.
And I cannot show them any mark of favor without com.
promising my own conscience and misleading theirs. I
do not find fault with them, remember, for leaving the
Church--that is a question between them and their
Maker; and every one should act according to his con-
science : but I do blame them highly for abusing the
Church, Mr. Bentley, and myself, and the ladies of the
school, after their daughter had been in it so long, and
Mr. Bentley had been so kind to them." And Mabel,
having stated the difficulty, was silent. To this diffi
culty, Miss Macdougall, though she did not exactly see
the sin of abusing the Church, willingly assented, and
unde took to act as almoner of the society in place of

Mabel ; for the society, in its corporate capacity, being
precluded from entertaining any peculiar attachment to
the Church, was quite insensible to the crime of abusing
it; and, indeed, being raised wholly above any distinc.
tions of right or wrong in religious matters, looked only on
John's small wages and his wife's large family; and the
question was easily decidedso easily, indeed, that seve.

themselves how troublesome it was to have a conscience ;
and how easily all these difficulties might have been re-

of the Grey School going to church, or if Mabel would

religion. Mrs. Maddox, indeed, could not help saying
that she hoped the new charity commissioners would do
away with these persecuting restrictions of the Grey
School ; and"that the children of all sects might partake
together of the bounties of Alderman Brown, and of a
sound religious education, without any peculiar doctrines
to disturb their mutual affection.

culiar complacency of voice which indicated a conscious.

You are always at the bottom of these things, you know

And she turned to Mabel, who, with a little confusion of
conscious importance, protested that she was not in the
secret-she had nothing to do with it. Only Mr. Bent-
ley had been describing the sad destitution of the suffer-
ers by the fire, and she had just mentioned it accidentally;

Thompson has promised to invite Miss O'Neill to stay
with her, and keep her stallthe beautiful Miss O'Neill,
you know, who sold such a number of things at the Fair-
field Bazaar."
"Miss O'Neill !" cried a little voice from the bottom of
the table; what! the beautiful Miss O'Neill ?"
And Miss Martha Beadon, who was a niece of Mrs.
Lomax', and was then staying on a visit to her aunt, im-
mediately entered into a low laughing communication
with two other young ladies who were sitting next her.
In vain Mrs. Lomax looked, and frowned, and nodded.
Little Martha's high spirits carried her away; and even
Mabel, at the other end of the table, busied as she was in
cutting out a baby's frock, and discussing its proper length
with Mrs. Maddox, could overhear the words "Fairfield"

"pair of gloves"--" handsome girl," and other stray pas.
sages, which, when put together, seemed to imply some
anecdote of the bazaar not quite conformable to the no-
tions which Mabel maintained of strict feminine delicacy.
After a few sentences, Miss Martha's voice sunk into a
whisper; and "oh! oh, fy! hush !"--and the gravity
suddenly assumed by the young hearers confirmed hersus-
picions, and very nearly overturned all her plans for a
Hawkstone bazaar, together with a design for a splendid
kettle-holder, which she had intended to work herself, and
devote to the purposes of charity.
"Lady Thompson," she said in a hurry, in order to stop
farther tittle-tattle at the bottom of the table, "
posing a ball. She thought many persons who would not
give anything to the poor persons, or buy at the bazaar,
would willingly show their charity by coming to the ball."
The Miss Macdougalls both looked prim, and seemed
suddenly immersed in the perplexity of some plaited cali-
co before them.
" We should all like a ball," said Mrs. Lomax, looking
to Martha, at the bottom of the table, and thinking that
she should probably be asked to be one of the patronesses.
Yes," said Miss Lomax, "and we might all make par-

so many dinners. But then it was all for charity; and the
St. Barbes would never have come if we had not asked
them."
" How well," whispered Miss Maddox, " I remember
that ball. You must know papa gave us all new dresses,
white satin trimmed with blond; and only think that
awkward waiter at the Bell threw a cup of coffee over
mine, and spoiled it for ever : mine alone cost six gui.
neas."
" What a pity!" exclaimed the little knot of young
ladies.
" And do you remember, too, how silly it was of Mary
Vincent: she would not go at all; and the only reason
was, that she had been to see the poor people in the morn-
ing, and could not get their distress out of her head.
She said she really could not dance with any pleasure
while thinking of them."
" How very odd !" exclaimed the young ladies at the
bottom of the table.
And just at this time Mabel, at the top, who had been
searching for some papers in an account-book, read out
the sums of money raised for the last misfortune of a
similar kind :--Sermon at church, 51. 10s. 412d. Pri.
vate subscriptions, 261. 78. 10d. Balance of ball, deduct-

My own notion," she added, " was an oratorio in the
church. It is so much more solemn; and sacred music is
so delightful. Is it not, my dear Miss Macdougall ?"
But that lady again looked prim, and, muttering some.
thing indistinctly, was again perplexed with her calico.
"Oh, do let us have an oratorio !" cried Miss Martha.
"I shall never forget going to one at Worcester Cathedral.
It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw ; all the famous
opera-singers were there, and Signor Bellini, and Signora

into a sotto voce remark to her next neighbor, of which
nothing was audible but "sad character !-poor thing !-

" And how well," interposed Miss Anne," they had
arranged the seats! All the upper part of the choir was
boarded over ; and as we had some interest with the stew.
ards, we had the most comfortable place you can conceive,
just over the altar; I do believe I was exactly in the cen-
tre, just upon it. And we heard so well!" Just at this
moment something made Miss Macdougall look up from
her work with a rather surprised air, and Mrs. Maddox
and Miss Catherino exchanged little glances accompanied
with the slightest curl of a smile on their lips.
" It would take a long time," said Mabel, thoughtfully,
" to fit up the church."
" Yes, I think they told us at Worcester they had been
obliged to suspend the service for six weeks or more.
And I shall never forget the clattering, and hammering,
and the swearing of the workmen, while they were pull.
ing down the scaffolding. It sounded quite strange in the
cathedral."
" What we should want," said Mabel, thoughtfully
again, " would be stewards. It generally costs the stew.
ards a tolerably round sum. At Worcester, I believe,
they usually lose about 8001. between them."
" But then," said Mrs. Lomax, " they gain four or five
hundred for the charity; and that you know, is a great
thing."
" It we have a bazaar," said Mabel, thoughtfully as
before, W? must work for it."

"Oh! we will all work," exclaimed a number of voices
in which the Misses Macdougall did not join.
" And it must not be anything useful," added Mabel-
" I mean anything one really wants; for, you know, per-
sons always buy such things best at the shops; and it
would throw the poor workmen out of employment if we
set up a rival establishment."
"Oh, no, certainly not," was the answer. And each

ornament a card-box with paste and paper, so as to make
it look like real wood; another had learned the art of
stuffing little figures of birds, and covering them with real
feathers; a fourth had already commenced the cover of
an ottoman, which was to consume four or five guineas'
worth of wool and silk, besides six weeks' uninterrupted
labor, morning and evening, and which, when it was fin-
ished, with the border of yellow and crimson, and St.
George and the Dragon, in deep blues and reds, in the
centre, and the framework, and the tassels, no one thought
would be dearly priced at five pounds.
Mrs. Lomax promised to give up the children to their
governess
ess for a week or two, and contribute a little model
of a farmyard, (a papyreum it was called,) in which were
to be cows and pigs, and a haystack, two ploughmen, and
one milkmaid, besides barns and outhouses, all constructed
by some ingenious process, which she kept a profound
secret, out of silver paper, and which, under a glass case,
vould look beautiful on a table in a drawing-room. And
Mabel once more reverted to her kettle-holder, and al-
most engaged, in addition, for a patchwork counterpane,
provided all present would engage to furnish her with
fragments from their wardrobes.
* And what progress has been made in the subscrip-
tion?" said Miss Catherine Macdougall, at length folding
up her work, and looking as if she wished to go home.
"Tolerable," replied Miss Brook. 66 Mr. Lomax
very liberally headed it with two pounds; and most of the
tradespeople had given their fire and ten shillings."

"I assure you," said Mrs. Lomax, in a melancholy
tone, "these subscriptions are ruinous. Mr. Lomax de.
clared to me solemnly, that last year they had cost him
no less than twenty guineas, besides what he gives in
charity at the door. With his family, and situated as we
are, obliged to keep so much company, and with our es.
tablishment, I cannot bear to see him asked for anything
which is not absolutely necessary. But this is a case-
no less than four families without a home. Is it not, my
dear Miss Mabel ?"
" Five!" said Mabel. " The only odd thing that I
have heard yet is the refusal of the stranger at the Bell-
the gentleman, you know, who saved the child-our
hero, as we call him."
" He refuse !" cried the whole party.
" How very handsome he is !" whispered Miss Mad-
dox. "Do not you think so ?" And little Martha, to
whom the question was addressed, colored up as taken
by surprise, and answered, "Yes-10~I cannot tell,"
though ever since the night of the fire her whole fancy
was running on the mysterious stranger, whom she had
caught sight of in the street the next morning, and at once
had set down as a prince, or at least a count, in disguise,
who might possibly fall in love with herself and make her
a countess.
" The fact is," said Mrs. Maddox, significantly, " I
know more about the circumstances than any one else.
And I must say, they struck me as very strange-I might
even say suspicious." And she looked around for some
mark of approbation of her great sagacity:
66 You know
how well it was arranged that the subscription should be
set on foot without any distinction of sects or parties."
This was uttered with another bland smile on the amia-
ble Mabel. 66 So Mr. Maddox and Mr. Lomax took one
part of the town, and Mr. Bentley and our excellent friend
Mr. Bryant"-a smile at Miss Macdougall" took the
other. Well, when Mr. Maddox and Mr. Lomax called
on the stranger at the Bell, they were shown up into his
roomthe best room in the house, I assure you, over the
coffee-room. And the waiter seemed so civil, and indeed

to be quite afraid of him. And Mr. Maddos said that he
observed several travelling-cases, and an imperial, and
everything, in fact, like a man of fortune. Nothing could
be more polite. Evidently quite a man of the world.
But on learning the object of the visit, he regretted that
he could not do anything, as he always gave his contri.
butions through the hands of the clergyman of the
parisk."
" How odd ! " cried the young ladies.
"Not very liberal, I must say," said Miss Catherine
Macdougall.
" But," continued Mrs. Maddox, nearly out of breath,
and afraid lest any one should seize the end of the story
without her, "the strangest thing is to come.
When
Mr. Bentley and Mr. Bryant called, in consequence, he
was very civil to Mr. Bentley, and very cold and stiff
indeed to poor Mr. Bryant ; and after all, on some foolish
excuse or another, he would not give them anything."
" How extremely shabby!" was the exclamation,
in which the voice of Miss Catherine, who could not
help feeling for Mr. Bryant, was heard with peculiar
sharpness.
"But this is not all," continued Mrs. Maddox, rising
from the table and becoming agitated. "You know,
she said, looking to Miss Catharine, who was leaning
forward to catch anything which might avenge the slight
offered to her favorite preacher-"you know this gentle.
man" (and there was a bitterness mingled in the expres.
sion "this gentleman,') " though he did behave very well
in saving the child, was seen by fifty persons crossing
himself, actually crossing himself. He must be a Pa-
pist!" and her voice became louder, as she reached the
climax.
Certainly! said Miss Catharine and Miss Mac
dougall both, with a firm, decisive, judicial condemnation
of the unhappy criminal. And you know Lord Clare-
mont is erecting a Catholic" (if Mrs. Bevan had been
here she would have insisted on its being called a
Roman) "Catholic chapel. And parliament is just
going to be dissolved. And now I think I need say no

more : you can guess who this gentleman is, und what
he is doing in Hawkstone ; I have not a doubt he intends
to be the new member."
Why Mrs. Maddox should leap so rapidly to her
conclusion, and feel so much interest, and speak with
such evident exasperation on the subject, was a problem
to the Dorcas Society at large ; and much pondering
was proceeding in secret, when the diffident Sarah Mor.
gan, from the bottom of the table, with a very faltering
voice, which she had not trusted herself to utter during
the whole evening, except to her nearesi neighbor, and
coloring at thus coming forward in public, ventured to
say that she had heard something also which clearly
proved that the incognito was a papist. Mr. Morgan's
housemaid was sister-in-law to the first cousin of Robert,
the head waiter at the Bell ; and thus Miss Morgan,
whose curiosity, in common with all the other inhabitants
of Hawkstone, had been wonderfully excited by the
handsome stranger, was put in possession of many little
facts not known to the common world. It appeared that
one morning Mary the chambermaid had found in
arranging his bedroom a little gold cross with a hair
chain attached to it, which he received from her without
any confusion, and put round his neck. Moreover, on
Friday last when Robert after breakfast brought him
the bill of fare, Robert's observant eye detected that
nothing had been touched but a crust of bread, and, to
his still greater surprise, nothing was ordered for dinner
but a poached egg: this was evidently fasting. And to
crown all, Mr. Bryant, when making his visit of charity:
having been shown into the room before the stranger
appeared, had turned over several books on the table,
and two of them were Greek folios, which Mr. Bryant
did not understand, and a third was inixed up with red
letters, and the fourth Mr. Bryant had seen by the
lettering was a breviary. What a breviary was, the
ladies of the Dorcas Society did not exactly understand,
but they had met with the word in several romances con.
nected with monks and beads, nuns and crosses, and they
could not doubt it was something bad.

HAWKSTONE.
We must not dweh on the ejaculations, partly of pity
and partly of grave condemnation, with which these facts
were received. The notion that a papist should ever
come forward as member for Hawkstone, on which notion
Mrs. Maddox seemed strangely bent, was deemed an
absurdity. " And after all, my dear Mrs. Maddox," said
Mabel, we know nothing of the stranger, not even his
name ; he had no direction on his trunks." (How
Mabel had learned this fact was a mystery.) " He has
received no letters, he has never given his name to the
waiter ; and there is something so commanding about
him, that the people at the Bell are afraid to ask him.
All I can hope," continued she, "is that Mr. Bentley
may find some opportunity of speaking to him ; and if
any one can convert him, it must be Mr. Bentley.
What a beautiful sermon he preached against popery
last Sunday !--so very impressive!"
" Oh, it was beautiful! Did you not like it ?" said
little Martha, looking up in the face of Miss Catherine
Macdougall, who had left her chair for some work, and
was leaning over Martha's shoulder.
Mrs. Lomax coughed significantly.
"Was it not beautiful, Miss Macdougall ?"
Two more coughs from Mrs. Lomax ; but Martha
heeded not. "I do hope," she continued, " you like
Mr. Bentley. I never heard such a delightful preacher.'
" Martha, my dear, lend me your scissors," cried
Mrs. Lomax from the other end of the table ; and as
Martha took up the scissors she met a look and a frown
which plainly told her she was making some mistake.
" We always go to our own church," replied Miss
Catherine, very coldly.
" But I thought you lived in Hawkstone ?": sked the
innocent Martha, who, as a stranger, was not enlight.
ened on the polemical statistics of the place.
" So we do," said Miss Catherine.
"But where do you go to church, then ?" continued
Martha, warned in vain by a friendly foot touching her
under the table. "There is only one church in the town,
is there?"

we are
;
Here Jane Lomax took the opportunity of some little
movement to whisper, " They are Presbyterians."
"Oh, she meant the chapel, then," whispered
Martha.
" No, my dear," said Miss Catherine, coloring, who
had no wish to avoid the discussion, "I meant the
church. Our place of worship is a church as well as
yours.'
"But I thought," again asked Martha, " that there
was only one Church? Does not the Bible say there is
only one Church, aunt ?" Mrs. Lomax had no wiel de
reply, and was busy with her work-basket.
" You know," continued Miss Catherine,
the Church in Scotland, and you are Dissenters ; and
we are Dissenters here, and you are the Church."
" But then there must be two Churches," said Mar-
tha
" and the Bible says there is but one. Is not that
strange ?"
" My love," said Mrs. Lomax, impatiently, "we
should not talk of things which we do not understand
So put up your work, for it is getting quite latehal"
past nine, I declare."
And Martha proceeded to arrang
her work-basket, pondering in her mind how Miss Mac-
dougall could call her chapel a church when the Bible
said there was but one Church, and resolved to ascertain
as soon as possible what the meaning of a Church was,
and whether, which she strongly doubted, it meant any-
thing at all.
Mrs. Lomax's move seemed gladly seconded by Mrs.
Maddox, who had evinced for some time a little fidgetty
impatience, implying that she wished the evening at a
close. And the party had soon partaken of Mabel's
wine-and-water, adjusted their cloaks, put on their clogs,
and galoshes, and Gloucester boots, and wishing each
other a kind good night, they made their way down Ma.
bel's narrow staircase, into the gas-lighted street. Mrs.
Maddox alone found a singular difficulty in fastening her
cloak. And after allowing the others to depart, and
telling her daughter that the servant might come again
for her, she no sooner saw that all were gone,
than

closing the door, she seated herself once more by he fire,
and announced that she had something to impart of
consequence. Mabel took the opposite seat, and as.
sumed the air of an attentive listener ; and Mrs. Maddox
proceeded.
"I want you very much, my dear Mabel, to come and
dine with us to-morrowquite quietlyscarcely any one
but ourselves."
Mabel wondered at this being a matter of such im.
portance. But she saw evidently there was something
beyond. Mrs. Maddox paused, for she knew that she
was on delicate ground.
" I will tell you candidly why I wish it so much," she
continued.
" Now, do not be angry,
You won't be
angry, will you? But your cousin Marmaduke" (here
Mabel started, colored deeply, and drew herself up with
every mark of indignation), "your cousin Marmaduke,"
proceeded Mrs. Maddox, affecting not to notice these
symptoms, " is coming to us for some days. And I should
be so glad, so very glad, if I could see you meet him on
friendly terms, and forget all the unpleasantness between
you. He is such a clever man, and so agreeable. And
he is making his way in the world, rising, I assure you,
very rapidly. Mr. Lomax assured me that he had been
asked several times to Lord Germain's, Germain House,
you know, where all the clever men are invited. And
the government have made him one of the new commis-
sioners for inspecting the gutters, with 15001 a year. And
he writes in the Westminster Review. The very best
article in the last number, I am told, was his. And, in-
deed, I should not be surprised" (here her voice became
mysteriously low)" if he were to get into parliament in
case of a dissolution. It is such a pity that you cannot
meet him in a friendly way."
Mabel had heard, or rather she might have heard,
all this, for she sat perfectly unmoved, drawn up in a
rigid posture, with a very high color in her cheeks, and
a look of which Mrs. Maddox had caught a sidelong view,
and which she did not venture fairly to face.
But Mrs.
Maddox's eulogium had no sooner ceased than her an.

swer was ready. She expressed no little surprise that
Mrs. Maddox, an old friend, one for whom she felt the
most cordial esteem, with whom she was more intimate
than any one in the world, should have thought of ma-
king a proposal to her so painful and unreasonable.
She had no ill-will to Marmaduke, She was glad to
hear of his rising in the world. She could meet him, if
absolutely necessary, as she wonld any other person ;
but for anything like cordiality or friendship, such a feel.
ing as she had to the Maddoxes, for instance, and the
Macdougalls, it was quite impossible.
" You know well, my dear Mrs. Maddox," she
added, " the principal circumstances of his conduct.
You remember my poor brother Charles" (and here
Mabel's voice faltered, for it was her only brother, whom
she had doted on, of whom she was speaking). "You
know he sacrificed himself, I may say he lost his life, in
extricating Marmaduke from that disgraceful affair at
Gibraltar. Charles never recovered it ; and the very first
thing which Marmaduke did, as soon as he was released
from prison, while Charles was lying dead, was to villify
him, to impugn his word, to prevent his brother officers
from showing any respect to his memory, and to endeavor
to overturn all the plans which Charles had been all his
life contriving for the welfare of his family. When he
came to England, his first business was to sow dissension
between all the branches of the family ; to dispute my
father's will ; to try to deprive me of the little pittance I
possess : and all this with a show of kindness and pro-
fession of liberality, which common sense must see to be
hypocrisy. The very last words my poor father said to
me on his death-bed was a caution against Marmaduke ;
he almost prophesied what he would do, knowing his
cold, selfish, unprincipled, sneering nature. And he in-
treated me, or rather, I should say, he laid his solemn
injunctions on me, to abstain from any communication
with him. I owe it to the memory both of my father and
my brother, to have no further association with him than
is absolutely necessary. I should compromise my own
feelings and sense of right, and lose myself in public

opinion, and, as far as an humble person like myself can
do, lower the standard of public morals, if I overlooked
these acts as if they had never been, and could feel or
affect to feel to such a man the same as to a friend. You
will see this, I am sure, my dearest friend, in the same
light with myself, and will not urge me to place myself
in a position where I could not with propriety show what
I really feel, and yet by concealment I should disgrace
myself in my own eyes, and the eyes of others, and only
harden him in his shamelessness."
Mabel ceased--and Mrs. Maddox was silent, for she
felt rather ashamed of herself; at last she took courage
to hope that Mabel would not be offended, that she could
quite understand the feeling ; and on the whole she
agreed that it was better for persons who could not
cordially sympathize with and respect each other, to
associate together as little as possible.
"I am not offended at all," was Mabel's reply. "It
would take a great deal to make me quarrel with you,
whom I have known so long, and so intimateiy, and love
very dearly ; indeed, there is no one in Hawkstone
whom I live with more than yourself, and I hope it
always will be so,"
" Though we do differ in religious notions," said
Mrs. Maddox, recovering her spirits and smiling play-
fully.
" Yes," said Mabel, though you are a Unitarian, I
do not think religious opinions should ever interfere with
our social friendship. Thank God, we are not bigots in
Hawkstone, and there is no one, except indeed" (she
checked herself )" a Papist, with whom I could not live
on the most affectionate terms."
" God bless you, my dear, God bless
answer; and with a hearty and mutual kiss Mrs. Maddox
retreated to the door, and Mabel put out her candles, and
sretired to her couch."

CHAPTER IY.
MABEL was aroused the next morning from a disturbed
dream, in which Mr. Marmaduke Brook, assisted by Mrs.
Maddox, was in the act of seizing her splendid kettle.
holder, and plunging it in the gutter, by a merry peal of
bells from the towe of Hawkstone church. Nothing
could sound more light and cheerful. Bell took up the
sound from bell, and each seemed to rival the other in
ringing out some glad intelligence to the whole country
round. The sun shone brightly into Mabel's room ;
and again the peals rang round and round, and up and
down, now swelling out in full chorus, and now dying
gently down, only to resume the happy clamor with
renewed life and vigor. What could be the reason? A
marriage ? No! Miss Mabel was the sworn confidant
of all the Hawkstone young ladies, and could not be taken
by surprise on such a subject. Some victory, or a naval
battle, perhaps ? No! Though Mabel did not devote
much study to the newspapers, she knew that at that
time we happened to be in a profound peace, and not
even to have an ally to conquer untowardly, or a fleet of
his to destroy. What could be the matter? On looking
from her window, to her still greater surprise, she dis-
cerned, waving on the dark grey tower, a splendid pale
blue banner. Mabel rang her bell; and little Connor,
the Grey girl, was sent to ascertain the news, while
Mabel herself pursued her toilet. Connor had not far
to go ; for Mabel, with a truly liberal and charitable
spirit, was in the habit of maintaining that politics, as
well as religion, ought not to be considered in the friendly
associations of life, and that every one should be allowed
to follow his own conscience, whether in obeying or dis-
obeying laws. She had, therefore, felt no scruple in
establishing her quarters in the house of Messrs. Silkem,
the Radical linendrapers And Messrs. Silkem willingly
sent up to Mabel the  Morning Chronicle, which had
just arrived, containing all the news. The first words

which caught Mabel's eye, in large letters, were " Glo
rious Triumph of Dissenters ! " The next were some.
thing about " inevitable downfal of a tyrannical and priest-
ridden Church!" and, without much difficulty, Mabel
found that the bells were ringing and the flag flying on
the grey tower of the old church, to announce that a
liberal measure had just been carried in parliament, by
the hands of a Conservative ministry; a measure on
which she had heard both Mrs. and Charles Bevan de-
clare turned virtually the whole question of an established
religion in this country. It seemed strange : but then
there was in Hawkstone, as in other towns, a Radical
and Unitarian churchwarden ; and poor old Dr. Grant
was too infirm to enter into the dispute on the right of
ringing the bells, and Mr. Bentley, of course, could not
move. And so Mabel, a warm Conservative at heart, and
whose errors were only overflowings of real benevolence
and piety ill-instructed, was compelled to dress herself to
the sound of the tuneful church bells, ringing out merrily
the downfal of the Church, and with nearly a darkened
room, lest she should have before her eyes the spectacle
of that odious pale blue banner flouting the grey pinna-
cles of that ancient tower.
Her toilet was soon over, and her beakfast despatched;
but the latter not without many movements from the table,
and searchings among heaps of papers and references
to drawers, in order for Mabel to lose no time, but to ar-
range her business for the day, while she was eating her
meals. For this day, like every other day in the week,
was a day of business. And sometimes Mabel sighed,
and sometimes she asked for pity and sympathy ; but at
all times she felt a little excitement and sense of impor-
tance, which might (such is the frailty of our nature,)
rise occasionally into something like vain-gloriousness, as
she thought how many things could not be done without
her. And to-day there was the Grey School committee,
and the National School to be visited. And Mr. Bent-
ley's new plans for the Sunday School to be talked over
with four or five other ladies, and the last private meeting
with three or fou: others to originate a new ladies' asso.

( Jation for the discouragement of drunkenness, and the
accounts of the Tract Society to be audited, and the re-
port of the Ladies' District Visiting Club to be drawn up;
and, greatest of all, the first meeting of the Ladies' So-
ciety for the Conversion of the Irish, which was to be
held in the great ball-room at the Bell, and where Mr.
Bentley and Mr. Bryant would each make a speech, and
perhaps pay a compliment to her "laborious and ener.
getic offices as secretary," amidst cries of "hear!" and
" hear !" and the amiable congratulations of female friends
to cover her natural confusion. The day was filled up to
the brim. Still there was another object on which she
resolved, not without some misgivings, to bestow the first
hour of the morning. Why did not Mrs. Bevan come to
the last night's meeting? Was there, as she feared, an
anticipation of withdrawing from it ? Did Mrs. Bevan
disapprove of anything that had been done? And Mabel
could not rest till these questions were solved.
Attired, as she always was attired, in her respectable
economical black silk cloak, and her respectable never-
wearing-out black velvet bonnet, and, sole relic of weal.
thier days, her handsome boa, Mabel sallied forthfor in
novels, distinguished personages always move in that
way-into the High Street of Hawkstone. There was
seemingly a little bustle. Two or three persons were
congregated here, one or two there. Mr. Brown the
grocer was holding a confabulation with Mr. More the
chemist and Mr. Alley the shoemaker, at the shoemaker's
door. A little knot had gathered round the stable en.
trance of the Bell, waiting the arrival of the Highflyer
coach from London. At the corner of Westgate Street,
turning down to the Bank, Mr. Morgan was in close con-
versation with Mr. Lomax, and evidently on some deep
subject, for one of Mr. M.'s hands had seized Mr. L.'s
button, and the other was busily employed in laying down
the law and dictating some line of conduct, with a half.
patronizing and half-reverential air, to which Mr. L. wa.
listening condescendingly submissive, and not without gra.
tification, though at the same time importantly grave. As
she passes the her little groups, they make way for her

with more than ordinary deference. Mr. Brown takes off
his hat ; Mr. More smiles significantly, and retreats within
the shop to avoid touching her dress. The ostlers at the
Bell look respectful and admiring. But both the gentle-
men at the corner are cool-cooler than usual; and a
hasty good morning is all that they vouchsafe. "But then
they are evidently talking on business," thought Mabel,
who was not used to cool looks, and by no means likes
them.
But what makes Mabel on a sudden start, and look in
wonder at that long dead brick wall which runs at the
back of Mr. Aspland's garden? Why does the color
come to her cheek, and her heart begin to flutter, and she
look out to see if any one is behind her? Mabel's eyes
were arrested, as well they might be, by her own name, in
large white letters, three feet high, and half a foot broad,
painted with artistic skill on the whole length of that red
brick wall, " Brook for ever!" Mabel rubbed her eyes,
but it was no delusion. There was the wall, and there
her name; and there, what struck her most, the magic
words " for ever!" She was greatly touched, flattered,
surprised; but still modestly, and with a deep sense how
little she deserved such a testimony of popular approba-
tion. She knew, indeed, that she was of some little use
to the town; that the poor people always liked to see her
at their cottages; that the school could not do without
her; that she was secretary to no less than a dozen so-
cieties; that her whole time was spent in doing good.
Still, like the gentleman from Oxford who went up to
London the day after he had obtained his first class, an:
entered the Opera House just as the whole house rose up
to thunder out their applause on the entrance of the king,
she was not prepared for such a public manifestation of
popular feeling. It was too much. She preferred being
lefi in retirement, doing good by stealth : and, afraid, lest
persons should gather round her, she put her parasol be.
fore her face, and casting a side glance on the gratifying
inscription, she passed on. But for Mabel's modesty
there was no escape ; she had scarcely turned the corner
of King Street, going down Prince's Inne, than once

57
more, on the front of Mr. Russel's old malt house, there
stood the same lettersthe letters of her own name ; not
quite so large, indeed, and this time in black paint in-
stead of white, but coupled with a longer sullix, " Brook
and Religious Liberty !" Quite overcome, she thought
of those charitable sentiments, which she had so often
applauded and professed, and with which she had endea.
vored to hold together the sisterly societies of Hawkstone,
" without distinction of sect or party;" and could not but
confess that humble as she was, her heart indeed did merit
this tribute to her Christian benevolence. A little bewil.
dered at finding herself thus the marked object of popular
gratitude and admiration, before she saw clearly where
she was going, a rough " by-your-leave" compelled her
to make way for a dirty, fustain-clad, ragged-haired man,
with a short ladder on one shoulder, a mass of paper hang-
ing over one arm, and a black paste-pot, with a huge
brush sticking in it, in his other hand. She had just time
to save her silk cloak from the paste-pot, and to cast a
look of reproachful wonder on a rude man, who showed
so little deference for a person so extensively and deser-
vedly beloved, when the bill-sticker proceeded to fix his
adder against the wall, to smear his paste over it, to trans-
fer a long sheet of paper from his arm to the surface, to
descend his ladder, and vanish in a minute. Mabel looked
ap as she passed ; and once again-conceive her aston-
ishment-her own name, M. Brook, in large letters, at
the foot of some copious printing. What to think she knew
not. Short-sighted as she was, it took a little time to find
her glass, and examine the singular phenomenon. And
then, alas ! the mystery was dispelled. She read at the top
of the paper, " To the free and independent Electors of the
Borough of Hawkstone." She read one sentence, which
showed her that the address proceeded from her amiable
cousin Marmaduke, who solicited the honor of their votes
at the approaching parliamentary election. Mabel passed
on hastily, very much surprised, a little ashamed, a little
disappointed, half laughing at herself for suffering such
silly thoughts in her head, more than half angry at her cou.

and disturb the peace of Hawkstone, after having be
haved so ill to herself: and yet the thought flitted pastt
is a respectable thing to be cousin to a member of parlia-
ment! And before the thought had passed by, there was
a friendly hand placed within her own, and a pair of
laughing eyes were looking up in her face, with an ironical
congratulation. It was Anne Morgan, who had just re-
turned from one of her district visits, in which she had
been reading to a poor sick man, and endeavoring to show
him the necessity of coming to church, but without being
exactly able to explain to him why he might not just as
well go to chapel ; and Anne was not sorry to escape
from her difficult task of enlightening ignorance with
ignorance. There were kind allusions to last evening's
agr able meetingkind hopes that Mabel was not tired
with her gaiety.and kind hopes from Mabel herself, that
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan and all the children were well.
Yes, all well; Mr. Morgan tolerable. "But," said
Anne, sinking down into seriousness, "you must have
heard of his being called up last night. Poor Mary Vin-
cent-extremely ill, they say, with the typhus fever. And
my father was obliged to go there again this morning.
But we hope she is a little better." Poor Mary Vincent,
she, who would not go to the ball because she could not
dance with the misery of her fellov-creatures in her
mind. And she, it might be added, tle simple, retired,
pure-minded, sensible girl, who was growing up in the
village of Hurst to be a blessing to her parents, and a
pearl beyond price to any clergyman who could win her
affections, and associate her with him in the manifold duties
of his parish. And now she was lying on a bed of sick.
ness-perhaps never to rise from it again. And many
hearts, as Mabel knew, were wrapt up in her as in a pre-
cious treasure; and one, above all, whom Malel thought,
with comfort, that she was not likely to meet vhere she
was now going, for she believed Charles Beva 2 to be in
Oxford.
It was, therefore, with no little dismay that in Mrs.
Bevan's passage she observed a hat and stick on the
table ; and, on entering the little drawing-room, which

served also for a library, she found himself, as usual, with
bis large book before him, and his pencil in his hand,
and his note-book at his side. His mother's chair and
her work-table showed she had not left the room long.
And Charles was sitting with his back to the door, with
his head resting on his hand, but not reading; for Mabel
observed afterwards that the leaves of his book were
blistered with tears. But Charles had been brought up
in a school which did not encourage scenes--which
looked on human feelings-real feelings, that is, and
innocenttoo reverently to tolerate display of them. If
there was one thing which he despised, it was theatrical
sensibility. And thus the sight of Mabel quieted him at
once; and he could enter into the common topics of a
visit without betraying himself. He had come down, he
said, from London unexpectedly last night, and took to
himself the blame of his muther's absence from the Dorcas
Society. And his mother soon appeared to answer for
herself ;-her usual quietness of manner, shaded over by
evident sorrow, and her eye glancing unobservedly on her
son with an expression of affectionate compassion, which
went to Mabel's heart.
"A note from Mr. Morgan, ma'am," said the servant,
following his mistress into the room. And Mabel saw
Charles take up his pencil, and begin writing hurriedly,
as if not daring to look up. His mother's hand shook
violently as she attempted to open it; but, to Mabel's
great delight, her face relaxed as she read it; and, putting
it before her son, with a slight pressure of the hand,
returned, Oh! how warmly! she turned to Mabel to
inform her that it was a line from Mr. Morgan, who had
just returned from Hurst, to say that things were going
on well, and all danger was over. Mabel only saw that
Charles's eyes were turned up for one moment with an
expression of thankfulness and piety such as she had
never seen before; and then, while the two ladies were
in conversation, he folded up his papers, aud without
being observed left the room.
Nearly half an hour had elapsed before he returned,
with a composed and cheerful countenanceso much so,

that Mabel was emboldened to look him full in the face,
and even to appeal to him as arbiter on the discussion
which she was then holding with his mother. " I am
explaining to Miss Brook," said Mrs. Bevan, " the reasons
which we were talking over last night, and which have
induced me to think of leaving the Dorcas Society. But
I would rather she should hear them from you; for I am
not quite sure that it is not an evil sign where ladies
undertake to be teachers, and to lead instead of fol-
lowing."
Charles smiled, with something of an affirmative in
his smile which Mabel did not like. Besides this, she .
was not a little afraid of him, for their opinions often
differed; and she was conscious of something defective
in her own system, what it was precisely she could not
tell, which made her uncornfortable in his superiority.
"Are you aware, my dear mother," he said, " what
you are doingproposing to me to undertake a war with
all the ladies societies in Hawkstone, with Miss Brook
at their head, and all the liberality and charity in the
country to come to their rescue, myself almost single.
handed ? I must expect to have my eyes torn out with
the points of buckles, as the Athenian ladies destroyed
their rebel, or to be pricked to death with scissors, like
poor L'Escuyer, in the church at Avignon, by the ladies
of the French revolution. For, whenever there is a revo-
lution there you will certainly find that ladies, like other
members of society, fall out of their proper places, and
that they are the cause of the greatest mischief. In the
Lord George Gordon riots," he continued, affecting to
look grave, "it is a well-known fact, that the lower
ranks of London ladies formed the most troublesome and
destructive portion of the mobsburning houses, and
bursting open prisons. And I need not remind you of
the poissardes of Paris, who stormed Versailles and
over-awed the Convention, or of the more genteel Parisian
ladies, who subsequently petitioned the Assembly that
they might be allowed to trail a pike in the Champ de
Mars, and who used to take their work and sit every
morning under the guillotine."

" What do you mean?" exclainied Mabel, half-
offended and half-perplexed. "Do you seriously mean
to compare us with those horrible wretches? Are these
your new Oxford notions ?"
Charles smiled at her warmth. " No, my dear Miss
Boook, far be it from me to make any such comparison;
and far be it from you to lay upon poor Oxford all the
strange notions which strange men belonging to it may
take into their heads. Poor Oxford has enough to
answer for already, has it not?" he asked, laughingly.
And Mabel looked grave; for, though she had not found
time to learn what Oxford notions really were, Mr.
Bentley had preached a most powerful sermon against
the new heresy, as he called it, and always shook his
head with a profoundly melancholy expression whenever
the subject was mentioned, as it often was mentioned in
the little Hawkstone coteries. Nor must we forget that
she had more than once seen the Record newspaper,
which distinctly charged the whole University with
popery; and the statement being in print, and moreover
in a religious newspaper, who could hesitate to believe
it?
" But you look with such contempt," she said, plain-
tively," on us poor women, as if we were wholly useless,
mere slaves, fit only to talk scandal or sew silk."
" Ask my mother," said Charles, " if I speak con-
temptuously of women." And his voice softened as he
spoke, and his eye became graver, and Mabel thought
moistened, for his thoughts just then had turned on Mr.
Morgan's note. "Be assured," he continued, "no man
ever spoke contemptuously of women without having a
bad heart as well as a bad head. I believe that God
made them to be a help-meet for manto be his great
earthly support, his comfort, his encouragement in trials,
his nurse, his earliest teacher, his last friend, his mother,
and sister, and wife. And without mother, and sister,
and wife, what would man be? And yet," he added,
- there may be a peculiar sphere in which only they
ought to act; and they may overstep their duties, and be
too active, too zealous too enlightened, as it is called
## p. 62 (#74) ##############################################

HAWKSTONE.
And they may want guidance and control even in their
best of actions, their charities, and devotions--inay they
not?"
Certainly," said Mabel; " and yet what would you
do in this town of Hawkstone, for instance, if it were not
for ladies! Dr. Grant paralytic; poor Mr. Bentley fagged
to death with his three services on the Sunday, and all
the weekly duty, and a population of thousands to take
care of, with only 150 a year. How can he attend to
the schools, or visit the poor, or manage the hundred
things which are implied in the care of a parishmuch
more now the manufactories have brought here such a
number of poor, and there is so much sickness among
them? No gentleman can attend to these things; they
cannot teach in the schools, or attend to the sick, or have
any thing to do with cutting out flannels, and distributing
tracts. What is to become of the town if the ladies are
not to be active ?"
" And you may add," subjoined Charles, "what is
to become of the whole country if the towns are not
taken care of-if the ladies are not active--if such
masses of population are brought together as we see
throughout England, to ferment and rot in heaps, without
any one to give them religion, or to stand over them
constantly with a high and parental authority, acting on
them like the eye of a parent on a headstrong child, not by
force, which soon must fail, but by gratitude, kindness,
shame, advice, assistance, admonitionthe ten thousand
secret influences which regulate the human heart, and
which no books, no teaching, can create, nothing but
personal, close, constant, minute, affectionate association
with a power above them."
66 And this, then," said Mabel triumphantly, "must
be done by ladies ?"
" Much of it, undoubtedly. I fear my fingers would
move but clumsily, if I took my mother's needle out of
her hand, and set to work on that white lily which she
is embroidering. And I fear also, my dear Miss Brook,
that you would be a little puzzled at these strange
hieroglyphics," (and be pointed to his Greek folio.)

" Each of us tv his natural vocation. Educating young
children, nursing the sick, regulating families--above
all, exhibiting, without your knowing it, a spectacle of
purity, gentleness, and affection to us whose hearts are
so often seared and tainted by the rough commerce of
the worldthese are the tasks which nature has assigned
to you, and with which we are not to interfere. And in
these you can do incalculable service, both to the Church
and to the country. No Church can be perfect without
you. And how highly the Church and churchmen value
you, you may learn even from the simple fact, that the
Church itself has been named with your name, and
delights in assuming your relations as a mother and a
spouse. Therefore never charge me with speaking
contemptuously of women."
Mabel listened, and certainly felt flattered. But why
Mr. Bevan should have spoken of services to the Church
-why he did not say, in disseminating the Gospel, or in
making men Christians, or doing them good generally,
she did not exactly see. It was one of his strange Oxford
notions; and she felt sorry that he was so bigoted.
"Shall I tell you," continued Charles, as he stood
before her, and perceived what was passing in her mind,
by her not venturing to look up"shall I tell you, why
I laid so much stress on the word Church? Or are you
afraid lest I should convert you to popery?"
" No, not exactly," said Mabel, half-peeping from
under her bonnet, and yet a little afraid.
" I spoke of the Church," said Charles, " because if
we are to engage either in serving God or in blessing
his creaturesthat is, if we are to undertake any work
of any description either from piety or charitywe must
undertake it as the servants of God, according as he
wills, in submission to that authority which he has placed
in the world for that purpose.
What would you say if
some active clever boy in the National school, wishing
to benefit his schoolfellows and do good, were to put
himself at the head of a class and insist on teaching them
their lessons, instead of the master, or without consulting
the master, or when the master forbade it-would you

66
think the excuze sufficient that he was most zealous in
doing good? Whether he did good or not, would be
another question. But the very attempt would be an
act of insubordination, would it not ? and as such you
would punish it. The children are placed under the
governors of the school, are they not ? and no one has a
right to interfere with them but the governors themselves,
or persons authorized by them."
Certainly," said Mabel, for she was one of the
most active governors herself, and no one was more
ready to vindicate their claim to an implicit obedience.
Not two days before Patty Sykes had been sent away at
her suggestion, because Patty's mother had come to the
school and interfered with some regulations of the com-
mittee, that no parent should speak with the children
during school-time.
" Think also," continued Charles," that to do good to
man is not an easy task. To make them wise and vir-
tuous, and religious, happy upon earth, and fit for hap-
piness in heaven,.--this is not a light thing. We must
be sure that what we teach them is truesure that what
we would have them do is really goodsure that God's
blessing is upon us, that he is not against us, frustrating
our empty efforts to do good without him, or against
him : and unless there is God's own voice confirming us
in all these things, what do we know of them ?"
" Nothing," said Mabel, "certainly."
" And how can we hear this voice," he continued,
unless we hear it from his ministers, from those whom
le has sent himself, and specially commissioned to deli-
jer bis message to mankind ? "
" We hear it from the Bible," said Mabel, reproach.
fully.
"We hear it from the Bible, assuredly," said Charles.
"But the Bible is but a document put into our hands by
the ministers to whom it is entrusted by God himself.
If I sent to you a message by a friend, and that friend
gave you a paper containing the message, but containing
also an injunction that you should attend to the explana-
tion of that friend, ask his advice, consult his opinion,

respect him as my own representative, would you say
that the document alone, whether you understood it or
not, doubted about it or not, was all that you would look
to,--that
you
would listen to no further informs tion from
that friend himself of the interpretation I put upon the
document?"
Mabel was silent, for she had heard so often from
Mr. Bentley of "the Bible and the Bible alone," and of
the attempts of the Oxford heretics to supersede the
Bible by tradition, that she knew, as she afterwards
declared, that something was wrong in the argument,
though what it was she could not discover ; and as Mr.
Bentley had never explained to her that there was a con-
siderable difference between a power in human hands to
decree articles of faith beyond and opposed to the Bible,
and a power in the same hands to convey down, under
suitable checks against corruption, the same truths which
are contained in the Bible, Mabel stumbled, as other
persons less ignorant and not more well intentioned do,
on the fatal word" tradition," and already lamented that
she had ever come within such a popish atmosphere.
" But what has this to do with the Dorcas Society ?"
she ventured to ask, in hope of escaping from her difli.
culties.
"I wished," said Charles, as he smiled good-
naturedly at the sight of lier perplexities, (tor Mabel,
with all her little ignorances, had too much goodness of
character not to be a favorite with him,) "I wished to
suggest, that when ladies, like other persons, do under-
take missions of piety or offices of charity, they should
place themselves under the guidance of the Church, that
is, of God's own appointed ministers of piety and charity,
and act as a part of that body, according to its rules, with
a constant reference to its welfare and principles."
Surely," said Mabel, " but where is the Church ?
Are not all who preach the Gospel ministers of
God?
" Not exactly," answered Charles. " If the letter I
send you by the messenger is stolen from him, and pre-
sented to you by another person,
that
person
does not

become by the mere fact of such a presentation my repre.
sentative and minister, does he?"
" No," said Mabel.
" And if persons not appointed by God do happily
preach the word of God, does this make them ambassadors
of God ?"
"No, certainly."
" But who are appointed? How am I, a poor igno.
rant person, with none of those great books within my
reach, and if they were in my reach, without means to
understand them,-how am I to decide who are the true
ministers of God, when they all put into my hands the
same Bible, and each claims to be such himself ?"
What Charles's answer would have been to this
problem it is difficult to say ; for at this moment the
door opened, a morning visiter from the country was
announced : and Mabel, gathering up her black silk
pelisse and adjusting her boa, shook hands with both
Charles and his mother, whether cordially or not she
could not exactly decide, and took her leave with a
promise that her question should be put again at some
more favorable time.
CHAPTER V.
AND who is the lady with the green silk cloak and
red-ribboned bonnet, who has seized Mr. Bentley's arm
at the corner of King Street, close by that large house
with the little house fastened on at its side, and bearing
on its brass plate the name of Mr. Atkinson, solicitor ?
It is Mrs. Maddox ; and she is busily repeating to
Mr. Bentley, who, as chairman of the Ladies' Branch
Bible Society, cannot but listen attentively to one of the
chief members of the committee, all the information
which had been collected respecting the mysterious
stranger at the Bell.
## p. 67 (#79) ##############################################

"He is a Papist," said Mrs. Maddox ; and Mr.
Bentley's face assumed a rueful look.
"He wears a cross," said Mrs. Maddox ; and Mr.
Bentley might have pointed at the cross over the church
porch, but by chance he did not think of it.
" He fasts," continued Mrs. Maddox. And Mr
Bentley might have informed her that in one of the
pages of the Church of England Prayer-Book there were
especial injunctions for fasting. But the fact was, that
Bentley's studies had not lain in the rubric, and he never
thought of it.
" He has a breviary," continued Mrs. Maddox.
And here again, as Bentley had never read a breviary,
he could only answer,
"You do not say so?"
" He would give nothing to the subscription for the
fire," said Mrs. Maddox. And she had intended to
conclude with a request, that if he should come forward
on Lord Claremont's interest for the borough of Hawk.
stone, Mr. Bentley would refuse him his vote, and give
it to Mr. Marmaduke Brook, the clever young man, who
was then staying in her own house ; but Bentley was
obliged to interrupt her by explaining, that the stranger
had given something--a very large sumone hundred
guineas; that he had given it last Sunday among the alms
offered at the Holy Communion, and Bentley had found
it in a small packet folded up with a note to himself, ex-
pressing a wish that it might be appropriated, if the
clergyman and churchwardens thought fit, to the relief
of the sufferers by the fire. Mrs. Maddox was thrown
back surprisedeven dismayed ; for what chance could
Mr. Marmaduke Brook, with his 1500l commissioner-
ship, have against such means and such liberality ?
"Mere bribery," she said, but Bentley checked her
observation. He did not think it necessary to add, that
in the same slip of paper there was a request that eighty
of the hundred should be appropriated to such sufferers
as were members of the Church, and the other twenty
only give'i to Dissenters in case they were in considerable

distress, and could not obtain assistance from the he.
quenters of their several chapels.
" Strange !" thought Bentley, very illiberal ;" but
so it was. And Bentley forgot just at that moment the
injunction of the Apostle " to do good unto all men, but
especially unto those that are of the household of faith."
For more reasons than a mere love of gossip, which,
as Aristotle tells us, is natural to all men, Mrs. Maddox
would probably have hastened away at once to carry
this intelligence to Mr. Marmaduke's committee, then
sitting in secret conference in her own drawing-room.
But just as she was wishing Bentley good-morning, who
should issue out from Mr. Atkinson's brass-knockered
brass-plated door, and escorted to the door with very
deferential politeness by the grave Mr. Atkinson in per-
son, but the mysterious stranger himself! He passed
Mr. Bentley with a gentlemanly bow of recognition, but
found considerable difficulty in executing the same ma:
nu vre with Mrs. Maddox; for what with the surprise,
and the notion at being so close to a Papist, and the
indignation at his standing against Mr. Brook, and at the
same time a little awe inspired by his great dignity of
manner, and a little confusion at the consciousness of
her own thoughts, besides a doubt whether she ought to
notice him, and a resolution to toss up her head as he
passed-all these things so embarrassed poor Mrs. Mad-
dox, that shifting backwards and forwards from side to
side, she ended in very nearly pushing her parasol into
his eye, and compelled him, with an apology for his
awkwardness, to step out into the road. But the apol-
ogy was gracious, the voice refined, the manner noble.
And Mrs. Maddox, after achieving her evolution, could
not help looking back at his tall commanding figure.
She then recollected (it is singular how recollections of
the kind do come upon us) that it was her duty, a duty
which she reproached herself much for having so long
neglected, to call on Mrs. Atkinson to inquire after the
health of little Jesse Atkinson, the youngest but four of
Mrs. Atkinson's ten children, and who had pricked her.

son was at home. But Mrs. Atkinson, a plain, sensible,
domestic person, little stirred by curiosity, little disposed
to communicate her husband's secrets, and caring for
little in the world but her own family duties, and Mr.
Atkinson's comfort, and her ten children's health and
happiness, was not the person from whom much infor.
mation could be extracted on the subject of the myste-
rious stranger.
She was surprised at the call, for there
were political reasons why Mrs. Maddox did not call
often,--Mr. Atkinson was a Conservative, Mr. Maddox
a Radical,she was surprised at the tender inquiry
after Jesse's finger, for Jesse's finger had been quite
well ten days ago.
And when Mrs. Maddox's careless
well-managed " by-the-by" (for Mrs. Maddox was rather
an intriguer, and understood diplomacy) had brought
forward the subject of the stranger, Mrs. Atkinson knew
nothing about him. She believed he had some business
with Mr. Atkinson-he had been often to the house,
closeted with Mr. A. in the librarywas fond of
children.
"Oh, yes," cried little Willy, who was in the room
playing ; "and do you know, yesterday, when I was in
the library, he came in and took me on his knee and asked
me my name, and told me such a pretty story!
6 How artful and electioneering !" thought Mrs.
Maddox.
66 What was his name?"
Mrs. Atkinson did not know.
" Was he rich ?"
She could not tell.
" How long would he stay in Hawkstone ?"
She had not heard.
" Had Mrs. Atkinson seen him?"
Yes, for a minute, but only for a minute, except at
church, when he sat in Mr. Atkinson's pew.
" At church !" exclaimed Mrs. Maddox.
Why, he
is a Papist ! "
"I should think not," observed Miss Simpson, the

governess, who had been sitting by in ilence . " for every
time that I have been to eleven o'clock prayers on
Wednesdays and Fridays, he has been at church, and
also on the last Saint's day."
"How singular," thought Mrs. Maddox, and also Mrs.
Atkinson.
"What can a gentleman have to do at church on a
week day? He is not a clergyman, is he?"
" No:" the eldest Miss Atkinson had remarked one
day that he wore a light-colored waistcoat.
" Any relation to Lord Claremont ?"
No one knew.
" Had he been asked to dinner ?"
It was a bold question, and Mrs. Atkinson felt offended.
But Mrs. Maddox's patience was exhausted.
Yes; Mr. Atkinson, she believed, without mention-
ing it to her, had asked him to dine last Friday, which he
had declined on the ground that he never dined out on
Fridays."
" He has been very liberal in an odd way about the
poor people at the fire," observed Mrs. Maddox, severely.
" Has he ?" said Mrs. Atkinson.
And Mrs. Maddox in despair rose up and took her
leave, ejaculating mentally, or, as it has been correctly
defined, not ejaculating at all, but keeping close within
her own breast, the exclamation, "Oh, that impracticable
woman!"
And in the mean time what had become of the stran.
ger? He had turned into the high street, not unfollowed
by curious eyes, had crossed over the bridge, passed by
the huge hideous manufactory with its hundred windows,
and its tall, smoke-vomiting chimney ; from whence he
had pursued the high road, until he reached the old lodge
gate of the Priory, and here he entered, without asking
leave.
"Please, sir, be you going to the house?" cried an old
grey-headed man, endeavoring to pursue him, and warn
him from trespassing.
" Yes, my good friend," said the stranger, returning,
and seeming to recollect himself. " Pray, is it shown ?"
## p. 71 (#83) ##############################################
HAWKSTONE.
71
" Yes, sir," answered the old man.
" Is any one there?"
" No one, sir, and has not been for many a long year 
since Lady Esther's death-all gone away to foreign
parts."
The stranger said nothing, but walked onand he
walked with folded arms, slowly, and stopping at times,
as if oppressed by a multitude of recollections And
then he looked up and round with a searching eye, as if to
see if anything was missing from an old and much-loved
picture. And as the road, winding under its dark masses
of wood, rose gradually along the side of a steep declivity,
he stopped here and there as at well-known resting.

hold again. At one point he struck off from the road into
the tangled thicket, until he reached a knoll projecting
over the river, and commanding one of its fairest reaches.
And the old bench which he found there, decayed and
fallen from its support, and furred with fungi and moss, he
took up reverentially, and replaced, as if it were something
that he valued. And further on he stopped to examine an
old beech tree, under which some deer had been reposing;
and the grey silvery bark still bore on it the traces of
initials which the stranger stooped down to examine, and
was obliged to lean against the trunk and unbutton nis
coat, as if to recover breath from some internal pressure.
His walk was soon resumed. And yet his object was not
the house ; for on reaching the summit of the hill, the
road turned down again between two bold swelling downs
tufted with beech and oak, and matted in parts with brown
fern and thickets of holly and thorn. The deer were
lying in groups on the sides of the valley : and nearly at
the bottom, on a gentle eminence, rose the grey, gabled,
deep-windowed mansion, with its avenue of cedar and
chesnut stretching out into the lower park, and close by it,
a small churchyard and church nearly hidden in over-
grown plantations of evergreens.
Even under a grey

October sky, with the damp dews upon the grass, and the
sere leaf dropping from the trees, it was a scene which
might well attract a passer-by to pause. But now all
was bright and summer-like, and the old windows of the
mansion were lighted up with a bright afternoon sun, and
the very air was sweet and gladsome. And the stranger
did pause, but only for a minute ; and then, instead of
descending to the house, he diverged across the turf, fol.
lowing a narrow sheep path almost buried in moss, and
threading a wild forest brake which crowned the top of
the park.
"Are you going to the ruins, sir ?" said a shepherd boy
who met him. You won't be able to find your way by
yourself, sir. Can I show you, sir ?"
"No, I thank you," said the stranger; and he plunged
into the wood, and made his way as if he knew each step,
through brake and briar, and matted wood and coppice,
till he reached the green sward again, and below him,
embosomed in that quiet solitary dell
, with the oak and
the beech clustered round it, and the yew trees and juni.
pers studding every knoll, and the little stream fretting and
chafing under its rocky bank, there stood the ruin.
And as it broke upon him, once more the stranger
stopped, or st, or almost sank down, on the trunk of an
old uprooted oak tree, gazing on those grey relics with
thoughts far deeper than mere admiration of their beauty.
And yet they were beautiful indeed. Few monastic
buildings had escaped the plunder and desecration of
Henry the Eighth's times so well as Hawkstone Priory.
Much of the outer wall, with its gateway overhung with
ivy, was still standing. One gable of the refectory and
part of its oriel window hung together, but almost in the
air ; the prior's garden could yet be traced, though a slim
ash had shot up by the tall chimney of the prior's lodg-
ings: and two arches of the cloisters, exquisitely wrought
and wreathed with ivy, had been spared in the general
devastation, as if to show what the Church had raised,
and the State had destroyed. But the chapel was the
principal feature. The roof, indeed, had fallen in, but
one whole row of windows, with tracery almost running

wild in its richness, and even fragments of painted glass
still discernible in the upper compartments, showed that
Hawkstone Priory had been the work of no mean hand.
Two clustered pillars still rose up from the green turf,
where the antechapel had stood. The great east window,
nearly gutted, retained only one slender shaft, supporting
a hanging fragment of masonry, which threatened every
moment to fall. But through it was seen the bright east.
ern sky and the bank beyond the river, with its grey
rock and gnarled trunks and brake of gorse, melted down
into a hazy softness. And the stranger's eye wandered
over it, not without thought, and then fixed on a little pro-
jecting oratory still perfect in all its parts, and of which
the battlements and pinnacles had been even recently re-
paired, which was attached to the eastern extremity. At
last he seemed to summon up resolution, descended into
the dell, and as he entered within the walls of the chapel,
roofless as it was, he reverently uncovered his head, for
he stood on consecrated ground, ground which no act of
robbery or tyranny could ever render common.
Without stopping to examine the masses of carving,
grotesque and luxuriant, with which the ground was cum.
bered, he advanced at once to the east end, paused before
the place where the altar had stood, and inclined his head,
and then approached a strong iron-grated door, fixed in
the wall, and fastened with chains and padlocks, long
since covered with rust. Twenty years had elapsed since
that door had been opened; and when last it had been
opened the stranger remembered well how he had stood
as a boy beside it, dressed out with the trappings of woe,
and had watched with a cold awe, that nearly dried up
tears, a long funereal train lower through it into its deep
dark resting place the coffin of the being whom he loved
best in the world. How many things had passed over
his head since that melancholy hour! How many things
were yet to come, if it should please God to enable him
to accomplish the plans which were forming in his breast !
How much must he sacrifice, how much had he given
up fisr ever, if he was to abide by their execution !
Should he have strength to do it? And that tall, com-

fell upon his face before the altar, with his lip quivering
and the tears streaming down his cheeks, praying God
in the hour of temptation to be his guide and defender,
and even now in the day of peril to save his holy
Church.
CHAPTER VI.
But the stranger is leaving the ruins hastily, and looks
back as he ascends the side of the valley to listen to some
merry light-hearted music-a fife and flute, and even a

murmur of a cheerful crowd, is approaching through the

brate their third anniversary by a merry and innocent
tea-drinking amidst the ruins of the priory. And the
rubbish in the chapel is soon cleared sufficiently to ar-
range the deal tables on their tressels; and no place so
convenient as the altar to light three or four fires, each
with their simmering kettle. And the cakes are produced
from the baskets, and the young persons are all seated
in rows with their clean cups before them, so decent and
quiet, so very repectable. Who shall complain of the
progress of society, or of the state of our manufacturing
population? The signal is given; and Mr. Bowler, a
neighboring squire, with his bald shining head and good-
natured face, is pressed by Mr. Bentley, and Mr. Bryant,
and Mr. Armstrong the Baptist minister, and Mr. How.
eil the Independent minister, and Mr Mason the Quaker,
and Mr. Priestly the Unitarian, all of them pressing him

(he having consented ten days ago to submit to being
pressed) to take the chair. For who more fit to preside
over a moral and religious social meeting than Mr. Bow-
ler? a good, kind man, a justice of the peace, and, above
all (it made it so respectable, so free from party or sec.
tarian spirit,) a layman. And Mr. Bowler therefore is
moved into the chair, and Mr. Bentley, and Mr. Bryant,
and Mr. Armstrong, and Mr. Howell, and Mr. Mason,
and Mr. Priestley, range themselves by his side. There
is a grace to be said, and Mr. Bowler looks round de-
ferentially to ask which of the clergymen is to say it ; and
the other clergymen look deferentially to Mr. Bentley, as
if anxious to pay him a compliment, and therefore Mr.
Bentley says grace. But, as one of the children of the
children belonging to the National School remarked to
the child sitting next her, it was not the same grace
which Mr. Bentley said when the National School chil.
dren had roast beef and plum pudding at the coronation,
for then he had ended it in the same form in which the
prayers in the Prayer.Book ended; now he left this out.
They did not know that Mr. Priestley, the Unitarian min.
ister, was now sitting opposite him, and that Mr. Bent.
ley had too much delicacy to hurt his feelings by intro-
ducing any allusion to peculiar doctrines. The tea was
drunk, the cake eaten, with hearty relish, but tem-
perately, as became the occasion ; and as they emptied
after cup, there was a conscious gravity about the
process, and little side glancings of eyes to see if others
were looking; and the generality seemed to sit uneasy
on the benches, as if they did not exactly know what to
do with their hands. And the conversation was rather
forced, with long pauses between, except when some
bolder spirit, anxious to enliven the meeting, cried aloud
for more tea, and ostentatiously swallowed it, with many
self-congratulations that it could not get into his head.
But then the Temperance Society was a voluntary meet-
ing assembled to do that of themselves which neither God
conimanded nor man enforced; and, somehow or another,
voluntary acts of this kind cannot be done without persons
thinking of themselves, and therefore at times feeling

awkward. But the awkwardness all vanished when a
loud rapping on the table was heard at the upper end,
and Mr. Bowler's bald head and sleek good-humored face,
with all eyes upturned to it, was seen rising to address
the meeting. Unhappily the exact address itself has been
lost to posterity by the loss of the reporter's notes, but as
Mr. Bowler will make nearly the same speech at the next
anniversary, and indeed at every other religious meeting
in which he will be asked to take the chair, those who
are curious to hear it may still hope for a chance of
success. It began, we know, with " ladies and gen.
tlemen," at which the little boys and girls, and the
young men from the factory, made loud demonstrations
of applause. It then proceeded to enlarge on the inca.
pacity of Mr. Bowler himself for the high and distin-
guished office which he had been invited to fill, with many
humble protestations of his want of talents, and learn
ing, and eloquence, in which the meeting seemed con-
tentedly to acquiesce, and did not make against them such
decided remonstrances and denials as Mr. Bowler had ex-
pected : Mr. Bentley, indeed, said " No, no," but it was
uttered with a faint voice, and did not reach farther than
Mr. Bowler himself, who bowed gratefully and modestly,
but still as conscious that Mr. Bentley was right and he
himself was wrong.
A sentence followed in a different strain, beginning
with a " But ;" and when Mr. Bowler had enlarged in
the most glowing and pathetic terms on his devotion to
the welfare of his fellow-creatures, and especially of the
Temperance Society, " an institution which formed an
ra in the world, and on which the safety of the world
depended," all his hearers felt their own importance rise
into enthusiasm, and the tables echoed with hammerings,
and the ivy wreaths hanging round the mullions of the
windows actually waved with the commotion. Another
congratulatory remark on the harmony of these social
meetingson the delight of seeing around him so many
clergymen of different persuasions, all agreeing to sink
sectarian distinctions, and to unite in the common good
of the people committed to their care, -was loudly

and 66
cheered by the Dissenters. And Mr. Bryant, and Mr.
Mason, and Mr. Priestley, took the opportunity of stretch.
ing their hands across to Mr. Bentley in the sight of the
meeting ; at which proof of fraternal charity the uproar
became general. And Bentley gave his hand in return,
though he felt somewhat embarrassed at this cordial
assumption of equality ; and as he looked up, his eye
caught on one of the delicately carved corbels-a bishop's
face, quiet, but firm and severe, which seerned to frown
on him reproachfully. But the fancy was soon dispelled,
for the pith of Mr. Bowler's speech was coming; and,
as with honest cheerful face he told two ludicrous stories,
illustrating the advantages of temperance, everybody
laughed with him ; and everybody in good humor followed
him as he subsided into his chair with loud applause,
one cheer more."
And now the chairman, having wiped his face and
recovered his breath, looked at a slip of paper in his
hand, and then mysteriously glanced at Mr. Priestley,
who had been biting his lips and affecting to look uncon.
cerned ever since Mr. Bowler had been on his legs.
And Mr. Priestley rose, with some emotion, and with
sundry wavings of his hands, to propose the health of a
gentleman whose name he was sure would be received
with cordiality, even by those who did not agree with
him in religious opinions. Bentley felt an unpleasant
sensation in the palms of his hands and feet, and began
playing with the teaspoon in the saucer.
"Me," Mr. Priestley, "had always found Mr. Bent-
ley, his respected friend" (several of the poorer classes,
whom Bentley had often assisted, here joined with the
chairman in endeavoring to raise a loud applause, but it
did not succeed,) " he had always found his respected
friend, and he might say, he hoped without offence, his
brother minister, most anxious to cooperate with him in
all matters affecting the common welfare of their flocks.
He, Mr. Priestley, had his own opinion, and probably
many who heard him had theirs, of the expediency of a
state religion. But, as the laws of the land had decreed
that one religious denomination should have the ascend.

ancy over the rest, he trusted all would obey those laws
so long as they continued to exist." Bentley felt un-
comfortable.
" If, indeed," continued the speaker, " all churchmen
were like Mr. Bentley, Christians would, indeed, be at
peace. Nothing could exceed the liberality, the Christian
liberality, of his sentiments; worthy a religion of which
the first principle was peace on earth and goodwill to
men;" and he concluded with proposing Mr. Bentley's
health.
" How kind !" said an old woman to her next
neighbor."Just as it should be," exclaimed a stout,
honest-looking tradesman ; " I like to see good feeling
among the gown! Live and let live, is my motto ; and
persecute no man for his opinions ! Bentley rose to
return thanks ; the kind-hearted, zealous, pious Bentley,
who wanted nothing but instruction to understand and
avoid the false position in which he felt himself placed,
and who really was struggling (day and night) beyond his
strength to spread what he deemed true religion among
the thousands of Hawkstone, just as the Irish constable
threatened with his solitary arm to curround the mob.
That he said but little, and that little with an embarrassed
air, and in a voice too low to be heard, might naturally
be expected. And he sat down vexed with himself, and
to the evident disappointment of some few and the triumph
of many, with only a few encouraging "hear, hear's,"
to cover his retreat.
"Quite a break down," whispered Mr. Mason, the
Quaker, to Mr. Bryant, who was the great orator of
the place, and had been assiduously writing notes on
a scrap
of
paper
for some time past ;
quite a break
down.",
And certainly, through some cause or another, the
Church does break down generally, when it attempts
these rhetorical harangues. Popular eloquence is not
its forte, and never has been, for what reasons we leave
our readers to inquire ; but Charles Bevan, if he had
been asked, would have said, that man, in delivering a
message from his Maker, has only to deliver it, and not

to trouble himself with the results ; to deliver it plainly,
intelligibly, effectively, so that no excuse may remain for
inattention, and that all the rest is in the hand of Heaven,
and therefore, popular preaching, and popular speaking,
and appeals to the passions, and all the trickery of plat.
form discussion and proprietary chapels, are
out of
place in members of a Church, and only do harm.
Certainly, Bentley felt as if he wished such were the
case, and he might not be called on again to make
speeches at the Temperance Society.
Not so Mr. Bryant. Another mysterious look was
exchanged from the chairman, and the great orator of
Hawkstone arose, and with a deep and portentous voice
he poured forth, as the newspapers described it, "a flood
of eloquence, which held his audience in rapt attention,"
and " electrified them with lightning bursts of feeling,"
for more than half an hour. In fact, the chief amusement
of the meeting had depended on Mr. Bryant, and of this
he was well aware, for the day had been fixed purposely
for his convenience in attending. His exordium was
like Mr. Bowler's, but more pathetically bespeaking in-
dulgence for his defects and diffidence. From this he
proceeded to describe (and his eyes opened and flashed as
he advanced, and his arms began to move,)" the grand
and solemn scene which he then saw before him ; so
many intellectual beings congregated together under the
wide vault of heaven (applause), without distinction of
sect or party (applause again), to emancipate themselves
and the whole earth from the great crime of drunkenness
(reiterated cheers)." Mr. Bryant, in looking over his
speech in the morning, had doubted about "the whole
earth," but it told wonderfully well ; and the inhabitants
of Hawkstone felt each like an Atlas with a whole uni.
verse resting on his shoulders. He proceeded, says the
newspaper from whom we borrow, to depicture in the
most gratifying terms,
6 the moral and intellectual con-
dition of his hearers, free, enlightened, religious, liberal,
without bigotry, without vice. It was a sight to rejoice the
heart of Englishmen" (cheers again, though some of
the older members refrained, as not liking to appland

themselves). From this he digressed to give a graphic
sketch of the drunkard "rolling in the gutter, which made
the blood of his audience thrill with horror," and he
pointed out the absolute importance of binding even
children from their youth by a solemn vow to abstain
from all spirituous liquors. "Impossible," he said, " to
begin too early ;" and Mr. Armstrong, the Baptist minis-
ter, nodded a most hearty assent. He then enlarged on
the value and necessity of associating ourselves in every
good cause ; enumerated the hundred affiliated societies
which had sprung from the central one in London ;
trusted that they should always act unanimously, and
keep up a close and affectionate correspondence with the
body from which they had derived the first blessing of a
temperance committee. Without union, the very object
of the society must be lost. Without the society, there
could be no temperance. He would entreat them to stick
heartily together, and mark any one who ungratefully or
insidiously should sow the seeds of--(Mr. Bryant
here pansed for a moment, for the word " dissension" had
risen to his lips ; but, for some reason or another, he did
not like it, and luckily had time to change it)should
sow the seeds of disunion among them."Loud cries of
" We will, we will !" And here the newspaper re-
porter observes that some allusion was intended to a
feeling of discontent which had spread among many of
the members in regard to the conduct of the committee,
and which Mr. Bryant was most anxious to prevent
froin breaking out into open schism. And he therefore
proceeded to point out the solemn duty of not quarreling
with persons in authority, especially for minor points,
lest the very object of the whole society should be de-
feated by such jealousies and animosities.
Having dwelt for some time on this delicate topic,
he passed, to use the language of the newspaper, " with
singular felicity," to the picturesque and romantic ruins
within which they were that day assembled."

round with a scrutinizing eye), " it was impossible, in-
deed, that any Papist should have intruded into their

truly Protestant assembly." " No, no," cried the party.
"He gladly accepted their answer. And yet if the Pope
himself had been present, drinking tea with them, he
Mr. Bryant, would have boldly stood his ground, and
dared him to defend his bloody and atrocious system."
As this was uttered with the greatest vehemence, and
Mr. Bryant's clenched fist descended on the table at its
close with more than an ordinary thump, it was followed
by a round of applause. And certainly he was right in
supposing that few true Roman Catholics would have
made their appearance in such a heterogeneous congre-
gation. And then the speaker burst forth into the most im-
posing. portion of his harangue. "He compared the deeds
of darkness which had formerly been perpetrated within
these walls" (how and when he would have been puzzled
to say, for the simple reason that he had never heard,)
"and the innocent, the sublime' recreation of drinking
tea under their ruins, with tea-tables spread in the
chapel, and kettles boiling where the altar had stood.
He spoke of the enormity of monasteries, of vows by
which men bound themselves without any authority
from the Bible ; of absurd abstinences and fastings from
good things which God had created to be enjoyed in
moderation ; of silly, idle mummeries, and men and
women dressed up to distinguish themselves from their
fellow-creatures."--(And here, in the ardor of his gesti-
culation, he nearly knocked off from the breast of his
next neighbor an immense blue rosette, with which all
the members had decorated themselves, and especially
the gentleman stewards, the bearers of white wands.)
He showed, and with the greatest truth, how a numbei
of men or women congregated together without the super-
intendence of their spiritual superiors, and following
only their own will and fancy, must fall into mischief, as
monks and nuns had done : and from thence he traced
the corruptions introduced by them into the pure Gospel
of Christ, with which every one had mixed their own
notions and mere human speculations, instead of adhering
simply to the truth as it was taught by God. Nothing
coull be more successful than his demonstration, and

admirably was it received ; for Mr. Bryant was a clever
man, and not an ineloquent man, and a religious man,
and had studied parts of the Romish system with no little
insight into its faults, whatever he might have learned of
its virtues. One point, indeed, he omitted : he had
intended to speak of the absurd religious processions
and pilgrimages in which Roman Catholics indulge, with
music, and singing, and other vain solemnities; but
the chairman, as it was getting late, was obliged to
remind him that they had not yet sung the hymn, and
that the band was becoming impatient.
The hymn therefore was sung, all standing ; and, as
it was one of Watts's, which Mr. Priestley had pre.
viously eviscerated of all peculiar doctrines, it gratified
all parties, and offended none. And the members were
just about to rise from the tables, when a fresh arrival
was announced which caused considerable sensation.
Several of the stewards jumped up to receive the stran-
ger ; several others looked round for a seat. The bot-
tom of the table fell wholly into commotion, what with
curiosity, and what with a wish to do honor to the new
Mr. Bryant himself and Mr. Priestley advanced
hastily to the outer gate of the Priory, and proceeded to
introduce into the chapel, and to present first to Mr.
Bowler the chairman, and then to the gentlemen of the
committee,whom, gentle reader, whom do you suppose ?
Was it the tall dark stranger, who had left the chapel
just before the society came into it? No! it was a young,
thin, pert-looking, beardless roan; not ungentlemanly in
his dress or manner, had it not been for a contemptuous
turn about the nose and lips, and a cold sneering ex-
pression of the eye. But the contempt and the sneer
were now meant to be subdued into the most urbane
and courteous demeanor ; and the cordiality with which
he shook hands with Mr. Bryant, and the ease of his
deportment to the chairman, and the perfect confidence
and self-command with which he surveyed the long tea-
tables, and then turned up his glass to look at the mul.
jions of the windows, completely won the hearts of the
tea party.

"A very fine young man !" whispered Mrs. Hutchings,
the butcher's wife, to Miss Spence, who sat by her side;
"a very fine young man, indeed! and, they say, so
clever. I even heard he has written a book."'
" Indeed!" said Miss Spence. "I hope he will
make a speech."
And, to the great delight of Miss Spence, she observed
a little bustle and whispering at the top of the table, and
a short confabulation between Mr. Priestley and the
chairman, which was followed by Mr. Priestley rising
from his seat, amid a clatter of spoons, to call attention,
and craving the chairman's permission to propose a
toast. He prefaced it by some pertinent observations
about "unexpected honor," "duty of hospitality,'
tinguished talents," " illustrious representative," and
closed with announcing the health of Mr. Marmaduke
Brook. The cheering was not very enthusiastic, for
few persons knew anything of Mr. Brook, except that
he had offered himself as a candidate for the borough of
Hawkstone at the next election, and on the Radical
interest. But Mr. Marmaduke received it, such as it
was, with considerable nonchalance, and stood with his
glass to his eye, and beating his boot with his whip,
until it had subsided. He then advanced at once to the
table, and, bowing round to the chairman, commenced
his speech.
He thanked them cordially "from the bottom of his
heart." (Where Mr. Brook's heart was, it would have
puzzled a inoral anatomist to discover ; but, then, persons
who are poor must always talk most of their riches.)
"They had conferred on him an honor, such as he has
never received beforesuch as he should carry engraved
on his heart" (heart again !) " to the last day of his life.
Stranger as he was, coming among them thus unex-
pectedly, by the merest accident, as he was taking his
ride"(Mr. Bryant bit his lips to prevent a smile, for
the whole plan had been concerted that morning at Mrs.
Maddox's cabinet council, and all had agreed that no
better opportunity could occur of presenting the Radical
member to his hoped-fior constituents, than the Tempe.

last word of his triplet, and was compelled to cover the
blank with a cough, which the hearers, who seldom
heard such triplets, drowned in loud applause.) "He
saw among them, and he rejoiced to see, some of those
learned, and pious, and liberal-minded men, whom, since
his coming into Hawkstone, it had been his good fortune
to meet, and to obtain from them their promise of support
in his approaching canvass." (Cheers from the little
group of dissenting ministers, Mr. Bentley remaining
silent; and one or two faint cries of " Brook for ever!"
from the bottom of the table, but as they were not taken
up, the perpetrators of them slunk back in their seats as
if abashed.) " Such men were an honor to their country,
and he did from his heart" (heart again !) " rejoice to see
them sitting here side by side, sinking all speculative
differences, abjuring all empty dogmas, confining them-
selves to the great truths of benevolence and charity
(hear ! hear !) and pledging themselves and those
around them, to the grand, the magnificent maxim, that
religion was a thing between man and his God ; and
that every man had a right to worship his Maker ac-
cording to the dictates of his conscience. Am I right,"
continued the speaker, elevating his voice," am I right,
my enlightened countrymen, in declaring that you, like
myself, are pledged to this heaven-descended truth?":
(Two-syllabled epithets have always great effect on a
popular ear, and accordingly the remainder of the sentence
was lost in an uproar of applause, and cries of " Yes!
yes !" in which nothing more could be heard from Mr.
Brook, but something about "nailing colors to a mast.")
" The days of bigotry," he proceeded, amidst cries of
" hush! hush !" from the most influential of his supporters,
"the days of bigotry are gone. No more should a tyran-
nical despot trample on the birthright of man. The

the speaker became choked either with emotion or with
having nothing more to say, and the audience, though
rather disappointed of the end of the sentence, announced
their sympathy by loud rappings. And as no one knew
that these were only figurative expressions, by which
Mr. Marmaduke Brook intended to say that Henry VIII.
had driven out a number of poor old religious men to
starve in the roads, had pulled down their houses, turned
their chapel into a cow-house, and put their money into
his own pocket, the sensation caused by such a gorgeous
description was perfectly unparalleled. Happy it was
that no old monk made his appearance at that moment,
for in their horror of persecution for religious opinions,
they would infallibly have torn him to pieces.
Mr. Marmaduke having now recovered his speech,
proceeded to inform his hearers that on such an occasion
he should not think it proper to touch upon politics ; and
accordingly he proceeded to give them an vutline of
his political opinions. He professed himself a thorough
reformera reformer of all abuses, but without violence,
without revolution. " He trusted to the good sense, to
the prudence of Englishmen, to work an entire change
in the present corrupt system of government, without
moving an armby changing the laws," he said, " a10t

revenue now enjoyed by an hereditary monarch, and an
hereditary peerage, and contrasted them with the starving
condition of the manufacturing population--the very
population on which" (and here the factory men were
loud in approbation) " the whole wealth and welfare of
the community depended. They were the sinews of the
country ; they were its only hope--enlightened, cultivated,
intelligent! How comes it," said the energetic speaker,
" that this important class is degraded into the melancholy
condition of pauperism and demoralization in which we
now behold it? (Here Mr. Bryant, who, three days
before had administered to the Mechanics' Institution
an abridgement of Watts' Logic in the form of a lecture,
could not help coughing. Something irritated his
throat ; and the cough had the effect of diverting atten.
tion from the little paralogism with which the speaker,
without perceiving it till too late, had brought himself too
closely into contact.) " He would say a few words upon
the corn laws. (Cheers.) It was the corn laws, it was
dear bread which had worked this frightful effect." (Here
some one jogged his arm, and on casting his eye on a
bit of paper slipped before him, he read " Bowler-a
landlord," and upon this with great adroitness he changed
his tone.) "He was not for destroying the agriculturist.
No! he was for giving him his due ; securing him a
fair remuneration. But until something was done to
enable the manufacturer, now ruined by competition with
foreigners, to carry on that competition more fullyto
give higher wages to his workmen".
-Here  coarse,
vulgar voice from the bottom cried out, " They'll never
give us higher wages than they can help! and Mr.
Marmaduke, turning to the quarter from which the voice
issued, asked urbanely, " What did his excellent friend
suggest ? He entirely agreed with him. He went with
him fully in his observation ; but he might be permitted
to say (i. c., as Mr. Smith, the proprietor of the factories

the workmen had in their own hands the power of in.

nation-lawful combination, he repeated, to obtain their
demand. They might assemble and go before their
masters, and exhibit a moral force which would extort
the admiration of the world (loud applause), and at the
same time raise their wages. Allow me to detain you
for one minute with a few facts (and the speaker searched
in a copious pocket-book for some papers and memo-
randa), only a few statistical facts, showing how you,
gentlemen, would be benefited, and the agriculturists as
much, by destroying the present taxes on your bread.
Facts are the only argument.'
And then, with a great display of cool calculation and
accuracy, he proceeded to read them from a paper a long
list of figures and prices :- Wheat per bushel, so niuch ;
duty, so much ; wages, so much ; cotton, so
brandy, so much ;which astounded the hearers by the
business-like learning it displayed, and enveloped the
whole subject in a mist of multiplication and subtraction.
" A sound man!" whispered Mr. Bryant."No theorist,"
said Mr. Priestley."A good practical man of business
---understands figures," subjoined one of Mr. Lomax's
clerks; and the effect was very favorable.
"But I have detained you, gentlemen, too long"
("No! no!" from the whole body). "I should have
said  ladies and gentlemen,'" continued the speaker, as
if recollecting himself, and dexterously resolving to re-
lieve the dry statistics by an allusion to the bright eyes
and matchless beauty with which he was surrounded.

of her clever son from the National School. "Something

at his mother. " What a fine thing it is to go to school!"
thought Mrs. Lloyd, and she eyed her boy with admira-
tion, till her attention was called back to Mr. Marmaduke
Brook, and, with her hand turned up to her ear, she
succeeded in catching the most prominent portions of
his succeeding sentence : "eyes raining bright influence"
--" heaven-beaming innocence "" fairy forms "-
" flowers of creation," and sundry other appropriate
phrases which Mr. Brook had by him at all times,
kneaded
up in a ready-made sentence, and used on all
occasions, when it fell to his lot to propose the health of
the ladies. Magical was the effect produced by it on
the ladies of the Temperance Society, who had never
heard it before. They blushed, they simpered, they
looked down, and the sensation took a palpable form on
the same evening, by a resolution of the chief personages
to raise a subscription of sixpence a-head, and purchase
a large silk banner of the palest blue, with "Reform
and Liberty" worked on it by their own fair hands, to
be presented to Mr. Brook himself at the ensuing
election.
" And now," proceeded Mr. Brook, " I will add but
one word more : but it is on a subject of the most over-
whelming importance. I am, gentlemen, a decided
advocate for the Ballot. (Uproarious applause.) I am
an advocate, gentlemen, for ensuring to every Englishman
the right of voting according to his conscience. (Hear!
hear!) But how you can vote according to your con-
science, if
your vote is to be known, I cannot discover!

ready to pay a flaming compliment to Mr. Bowler, as
the only intelligent, benevolent landlord whom he had
ever met with, that gentleman, he saw, was fast asleep ;
and, indeed, his being awake would have inattered
little, since he had long since abandoned all trouble
about politics, and made a point of giving his vote to the
first man who asked him.
The sight, however, of Mr. Bowler's slumber re.
minded the speaker that his speech should draw to a
close ; and so to a close he drew it, with the usual pro-
testations of ineffaceable gratitude for the honor they had
done him--with the most profound deference on all points
whatever to their wishes and opinions, as the guide of his
life-and, if he might be allowed to propose a toast, with
" the health of those pious and excellent gentlemen to
whom their spiritual welfare was committed, for whom he
entertained the highest respect, and trusted they would
always exert their influence in spreading knowledge, and

CHAPTER VII.
In the mean time Bentley had slipped away, soon atter
Mr. Marmaduke Brook's appearance, and was walking
home alone through the park, uncomfortable and dissat-
isfied with himself. He had heard things which he did
not like, though why, he could scarcely explain, and had
done things which he felt to be wrong, though no one
was likely to reproach him with them. And yet what
could be better than his motives? There was a popula-
tion under his care ignorant and turbulent, and amongst
whom habits of intoxication, encouraged by the preva.
lence of distress and by the gambling spirit of manufac-
turing employment, were rapidly spreading. One after
another, pothouse afier pothouse in the streets of Hawk.

pillars, and carvings, and illuminated interiors, and pawn.
brokers' shops opposite, to supply means for the pale,
haggard beings who all day long dropped in to spend
their last pence in purchasing a temporary forgetfulness
from hunger and misery. And without some efforts made
to check this fountain of evil there was no hope for
Hawkstone. Why not take advantage of an engine
which had done so much good in America, and was con-
verting even Ireland, by hundreds at a time, to sobriety
and decency y? What was the harm of men binding
themselves by an open resolution to do that which was
evidently right, and binding themselves all together with-
out regard to religious distinctions in a matter where re.
ligious opinions clearly could not alter the duty ? Bentley
was perplexed for the solution, and yet could not make
up his mind that Temperanse Societies were the good
thing which he had once fondly believed. It did not oc.
cur to him, and no wonder, since no one had taught him,
that by God himself, long prior to the nineteenth century,
there had been founded a "Temperance Society, with its
initiatory vow, its appointed officers, ils festive meetings,
its solemn sanctions ; moreover with an especial promise

of aid and blessing from Heaven ; and that Bentley him-
self had been created an officer to govern this old society,
and not to supersede and destroy it by any new associa-
tion of his own, or of human invention : it never occurred
to Bentley that such a society was the Church. Of the
Church as an associated organized body politic, he had
entirely lost sight; just as if a subject living in the Bri-
tish empire, perhaps a magistrate charged with the ad-
ministration of its laws, were to forget some day by any
strange hallucination that he had already a Sovereign, and
a Parliament, and statute laws, and tribunals of justice
binding him to execute his office, and were then to frame
or fall under some new invented constitution and gover-
nor set up by a popular enthusiast-continuing all the
time to sit on the bench and administer justice in the
name of the old establishment. Strange contradictions
and painful perplexities would assuredly arise in such a
conflict of relations : but not more strange or more pain-
ful than those to which Bentley had been exposed, when,
as a minister of the Church, he had attempted to fulfil an
end of the Church by means not appointed by the Church,
and in conjunction with men who were in open
rebellion
against it.
And why was Bentley not alive to such simple truths?
Because, as we said before, no one had taught him. He
had been brought up as a boy under parents of lax prin-
ciples, who never spoke to him of religion : from them he
had been transplanted to a school, where, with the excep-
tion of a dull sermon on the Sundaya sermon on morality
onlyand a chapter in the Greek Testament on Monday,
in which nothing was thought of but the syntax, religion
again was as if it did not exist ; and all vice was allowed
to flourish, without effort to correct it, if it only had cun-
ning to escape
the eye of a master who did not wish to
From school he went to Cambridge. And here
the first germs of his religious feelings began to develops
themselves. He was thrown (by accident) among a set
of clever, cool-headed, profligate young men, who formed
theniselves into a sort of club, of which the motto, if the
spirit had been expressed, would have been a dilemma

between Atheism and Pantheism. He was caughi by
their sparkling vivacity, overawed by their sa castic pre-
tensions, involved with them in a rivalry of mere intel-
lectual power, in which he was encouraged by the hope
of obtaining a fellowship, for which nothing but intellec.
tual power was required. And the very studies of the
place, engaging him almost solely in mathematical specu-
lations, fostered in him a dry, critical, cold-hearted, scep-
tical tone of mind, which was prevented from hardening
into avowed infidelity, solely by the natural warmth of an
affectionate disposition, and the blessing of Providence.
The very circumstances of a place of education, in which,
as at that time was the case unhappily in both universi-
ties, the externals of religion had degenerated into empty
forms, and yet were still strictly maintained as instruments
of College discipline, necessarily engendered doubt as to
the sincerity of its professors, and the reality of its system.
He saw the chapel service enforced strictly on the pupils,
and neglected by the tutors--attendance on it selected as
a fit punishment for trivial offences, and a refusal to re-
ceive the Holy Communion visited as a sufficient penalty
by the most trifling fine. He found himself within the
walls of the chapel kneeling side by side with an avowed
Socinian, a professed Jew, and an hereditary Roman Ca-
tholic. And yet the authorities of the College, without
hoping or attempting a conversion, were satisfied with
exacting from them all an external act of worship, which,
to any sincere believer, either in Socinianism, or Judaism,
or Popery, must have been revolting and impious. He
attended lectures on divinity, but instead of the positive
truth of the Gospel, they turned on grammatical disquisi.
tions, or evidences of Christianity--evidences which, if
belief had been strong in the Church, would scarcely
have been deemed necessary to be taught. Of ecclesias-
tical history, of religion either as embodied in a social
system, or as a vital habit of the heart, he heard nothing.
Church livings and Church patronage were the only forms
under which the Church appeared : and its political con-
nexion with a mere Tory party, who upheld it as an in.
strument of government, rendered it peculiarly obnoxious

to the contempt of a liberal Whig; and by liberal Whigs
he was surrounded. At this stage in the formation of his
character, when he had already done much of which, at a
later date, he bitterly repented, and was on the eve of
doing worse, it pleased Providence to throw in his way
one of those many biographies, with which a peculiar
school of Divinity has endeavored to supply the place of
the Acta Sanctorum, or Lives of the Saints of Romanism.
It was taken up first in mere idleness; but it happened, or
rather it was ordained, that it should rouse a train of se-
rious reflection ; and Bentley became an altered man. A
new world seemed opened to hima world of feeling and
passion, to which the dry, cold associations of his past life
gave new zest.
The book which first touched his heart
was read again and again with avidity. Others were
procured of the same stamp. Hymns, sermons, devotional
exercises, preachers, doctrines, all formed on the same
model, were at Cambridge within reach, until he had
worked himself into a fever of religious excitement, in
which remorse and triumph, despair and confidence, love
and fear, alternated in strange confusion, and his imagi.
nation was filled with a wild phantasmagoria, obscuring
all the plain duties and sober realities of life. By degrees
this passed away. But still excitement of feeling was the
predominant element in his religion. He entered into
holy orders with a fervent zeal to redeem, if possible, his
past life by an entire devotion to his duty. But of this
duty itself he had never formed a clear and definite notion.
And notwithstanding his horror of Popery as a religion
of forms superseding the vital doctrines of the Gospel by
the craft of a priesthood, he fell at the very outset of his
ministry into precisely the same error which led to the
corruptions of Poperythat of making the object of his
ministry to be the salvation of men, instead of the plain,
straightforward, uncompromising enunciation of the mes.
sage committed to his charge. His first thought was man,
as if the glory of God depended on man's obedience.
And thus he labored for his flock with an energy exhaust.
ing his own strength and often defeating its purpose.

and actions were engaged in devising an i executing plans
for winning souls to God. Sermonslectures-visits-

gested themselves and pressed on him with an anxiety
which allowed him no moment of respite for quiet con-
templation or scarcely for prayer. Measuring the recti.
tude of his exertions by their success, and seeing them
constantly fail, he was constantly miserable. Every new
scheme was seized as gladly as if no schemes had been al.
ready provided by the Church whose minister he was.
A character of bustle, and vacillation, and excitement,
pervaded all his undertakings. His best efforts to do
good were generally out of place. He was constantly
exhorting-constantly debating ; bringing religion before
men at all times, seasonable or unseasonable, with no
rule to guide him but his own conscience; and his con-
science could never be at rest.
His very phraseology acquired an affected, technical
character which destroyed its force. It was violent with-
out warmth, and strained without power. And singular
to say, as he began, so he proceeded; and with all his
dread of Popery, which he never ceased to denounce in
the strongest and often in improper language, he gradually
adopted all the worst principles of Popery, and brought
them into action. Like Popery, he endeavored to bring
men to religion by appeals to the fancy, the feelings, the
reason, instead of plainly and simply setting before thein
the truths of God, and leaving them in the hands of God
to work their fruit. Like Popery, he learned to look
with contempt on the Catholic constitution of the Church,
and, if not to despise bishops, at least to depreciate their
authority. Like Popery, he formed his own standard of
opinion, and fixed his own centre of obedience, instead
of submitting to the standard and the centre fixed by God
in the Catholic Church. Like Popery, he had his saints

95
and his fathers, recent indeed, and selected by himself,
and canonised by himself on account of their agreement
with his own opinions, to whom he deferred implicitly as
individual men, while he stigmatised as criminal any
reverence for the Fathers of Primitive Christianity.
Like Popery, he shut up the Bible from the comprehen.
sion of the people. The book, indeed, he distributed
abundantly, but as he threw each reader on his own
powers of interpretation, and cut off from them the sound
comments and typical illustrations of Christian antiquity,
he might as well have given it to them in the Arabic
text; for what uneducated man could find out the one
true doctrine in the variety of possible interpretations,
and who could take an interest in a work which he
could not understand without assistance, and in which
assistance was denied him? Like Popery, he encouraged
the growth of a multitude of voluntary self-organised bodies,
emancipated from Episcopal control, and which were
intended to perform the various functions of the Church,
but by a different machinery; just as if a man to whom
nature had given legs should insist upon walking upon
stilts. Monastic, indeed, they were not: Bentley would
have shuddered at the word. But perhaps they had all
the evils of monasticism without any of the good, as we
may see hereafter. Like Popery again, Bentley preached
loudly the doctrine of justification by faith, and practically
inculcated justification by works ; for he threw men on
their own internal emotions, tested their goodness by
their feelings, which after all are only works of another
kind from alms, fastings, and mortification of the body,
but without the advantage of producing like them external
good. They produced no good at all. Like Popery,
Bentley indulged in forms, and laid on them the greatest
stressforms of speech, forms of intonation of voice,
forms of society, abstinence from certain amusements,
associations with certain persons, the reading of certain
books. Unhappily they were forms of his own creation,
or adopted from his party; not the forms of the Catholic
Church. Like Popery, Bentley tampered with the Cath-
olic apostolical crred-added to it-omitted from it-

HAWKSTONE.
fixed his own limits as to what was essential and what
non-essential and denounced an anathema on all who
did not subscribe to his peculiar views. Like Popery,
Bentley tampered with the sacraments. If monasticism
introduced a second baptism, a second vow of obedience,
a second commencement of a new life, which invalidated
the former, Bentley had his notions of conversion, which
went precisely to the same point. If Popery, in order to
satisfy a curious reason, explained the mystery of the
Holy Communion by the irreverent theory of transubstan-
tiation, Bentley had his theory likewise, constructed for
the same purpose, but equally destroying the nature of a
sacrament, by denying the inward grace of it, as Popery
denied the outward sign. Bentley had also his confes-
sional; not a private confidential chair, in which he
might guide the consciences of his flock, but open con-
fessionals, where he encouraged every one in the pre-
sence of every one to recount their spiritual experiences,
and throw open to the common gaze that sanctuary of
the heart which God has so carefully hidden beneath the
veil of diffidence and shame. And this confessional he
endeavored to extend, by putting up a box in his church
to receive communications from his flock, without the
pain or difficulty of personal intercourse. Unhappily,
this plan he was obliged to abandon, for just as monks
and friars are charged with leading away silly women,
so Bentley found his box filled with communications from
ladies, who, as any one might naturally expect who knew
his real goodness of heart, his talents, and his piety,
looked on him with something more than the reverence
due to their pastor.
In short, not to multiply instances, or to enter into
the abstruser points of resemblance, Bentley had hy
degrees become a Papist in every thing but in name,
and, what was more important, without the power which
enabled Popery to wield so long the spiritual destinies of
the world. He had no association to fall back upon;
no organized system : no arm of terror; no mysterious
foreign authority to speak to his flock from behind a veil :
no antiquity ; no pretension to learning ; no deep know.

edge of human nature ; no secular force ; no wealth :
and the consequence which was necessary follower! -
his flock melted away under his eye. A few he retained
almost against their will, for they did not coincide with
his notions. Others attached themselves to him enthu-
siastically for a time, and then dropped off, as soon as
Mr. Bryant had appeared in a new chapel, and with new
eloquence. The poor he could not hold ; for all that he
told them they required, they found in a more palatable
and intelligible shape in the dissenting chapel. And
for the better classes he had nothing to animate activity,
to regulate feeling, to enforce self-denial, to satisfy a
doubting reason, to answer that craving which, in an age
of scepticism and dissension, yearns for some permanent
authority, some bond of union, to quiet the distraction of
the mind. He never placed before them law-slern, in-
flexible, exterral law-a law over reason as well as over
willa law of God, definite and immutable, intrusted to
the custody of an incorporated society, and through the
hands of that society to be held up before the eyes and
grafted on the heart of man. And without such a law,
what becomes of man's intellect, or his passions, or his
activity, or his happiness. He spoke to them of reasou,
of conscience, of feeling, of utility; but when his hearers
asked themselves whose reason, whose conscience, whose:
feeling, whose sense of utility, was to be their guide,
each man found it was his own : and those who were sa
tisfied with their own gladly followed his premises to
their legitimate conclusion of self-indulgence in all
things ; and those who were not looked about them wea-
riedly and anxiously for some ark of rest,--and an ark of
rest, of false and treacherous rest, they were about to have.
As Bentley seated himself on the point where the
stranger had turned aside in the morning to replace the
broken bench, and gazed down sadly and bodingly on
the town in the valley beneath, he fixed his eyes on
some white glittering pinnacles just rising unfinished
above the smoke, and recognized the great object of his
alarm, the new Roman Catholic Chapel, for which Lord
Morden, the Conservative minister, had given the ground,
VOL. 1-5

and the Earl of Claremont had subs. ribed a very large
s'n.1; the rest being supplied from some mysterious fund,
of which no one could give any account, but which, from
the splendor of the building, and the number of others of
the same kind which were rising throughout the coun.
try, appeared almost inexhaustible.
The thoughts which passed through Bentley's mind,
as he gazed on this hateful object, were most bitter.
His ministry had failed; and he had sought for the creden.
tials of his ministry, not in a formal appointment from the
appointed rulers of the Church, but in the success of his
labors. He had found the town effete, indeed, and para.
lized by the long incapacity of its old rector to attend to their
spiritual wants; with little but a formal religion, and
those forms dwindled into shadows. He had thought to
revive the spirit of religion without them,--to make men
hearty zealous Christians, so as to need no support from
mere external ordinances,-just as if, when a sick man
has fainted, and the circulation has stopped in his limbs,
we should proceed to restore the circulation, and at the
same time to cut off the limbs. And now all had failed;
and the church, lying, as it did on his first coming, in a
state of suspended animation, had been apparently killed,
and prevented from coming to life again by his zeal and
energy, which had cut off the channels through which
the life-stream was to flow.
Bentley did not see all this; but he did see that some-
thing was wrong ; and he sighed most heavily. And as
he looked down on the dull red mass of vapor that hung
over the town, through which the setting sun was now
shooting its diverging rays, other thoughts than of his
spiritual duties rose in his mind. There were, indeed,
thousands of souls in that large place, for which, in some
shape, he, and he alone, was responsible ; and he felt
bitterly that the account he must render of them was full
of evil. But there were also thousands of bodies, thou-
sands of living beings, of whom all but a small proportion
were in poverty and misery ;-mothers, with the hearts
of mothers, who were hanging over starving children ;
fathers, with arms of strength, and hearts almost desperate

but espe.
with disappointment and suffering. There were hun.
dreds and hundreds of children who were toiling day and
night, without hope, without relief, like drudges in a mill,
forced from their beds in the cold grey mornings before
they had slept out their melancholy weariness, sent back
to their beds again to think with fear of the coming day;
many worn with midnight toil, snatching their hasty meal
of dry bread or cold potatoes, apart from their parents,
under the eye of a stern task-master, and in the midst of
grinding wheels and tainted air,---oh! how unlike that
beautiful, that merciful nature, on which Bentley himself
was gazing,the hills--the woodsthe green meadows
the sparkling waters--the bright blue skythe glo-
rious sun-all which God has made for man,
cially for man in his childhood, as the nursery in which
he might be reared under fair sights, and gentle sounds,
and softest colors, and a liberty of innocence, to see his
Maker around and above him at every step, in every
thrill of pleasure, though shrouded under a mystery of
grandeur and of beauty.
And they were left to themselves. Some hand,
Bentley knew not how, had severed those unhappy beings
from the ranks above them. He did, indeed, visit, and
visit daily, their miserable abodes, and came back choked
with tears, to sit down to his solitary meal, which he
could scarcely provide for himself, and which was often
sent away untasted to relieve some famishing family.
But what could one hand, a hand of poverty like their
own, or one voice, or one mind, do with such a mass of
ignorance and distress ? When he stood among them,
and spoke of religion, they gazed on him with a stupid
indifference, as if asking what right an individual, young
and solitary like him, could have to command their minds.
If he gave them relief, it was snatched without gratitude ;
for there was nothing about him to fear, and therefore
little to excite love. In vain he exhorted the few unoccu.
pied persons, principally ladies, who could undertake the
task, to visit and assist in relieving. They did assist
him as they could ; but they had neither authority, nor
power, often not judgment sufficient, to turn those visits

to account, in forming habits of obedience, or religion,
or even prudence. The population was a body without
a head,-a mass of fermenting passions, sufferings, high
stimulated desires, balf-instructed reason,---with no power
above them to control, to guide, to be the object of af.
fection, to sympathise with them, or to awe them. And
not long since they had been admitted to the right of
voting for members of parliamentto a share in the
supreme government of the country. And as Bentley
recalled these things, and gazed on the sun sinking be-
hind a hill, and thought of a declining empire, he
started up suddenly from bis seat-for he had lost his
watch.
CHAPTER VIII.
UNHAPPILY for the unity of our story, our three principal
personages at this moment have diverged, each in different
directions, without knowing or caring at all for each
other's movements. And the reader, who must hold in
his hands the several clues to their proceedings without
confusing them, will, we fear, be not a little puzzled.
The stranger has left the ruins, and wandered into the
park ; Bentley, while sitting on the Bench, and rumi.
nating on the state of his parish, has just discovered the
loss of his watch ; and Miss Mabel has been occupied
the whole afternoon, and we must now return to her.
She left Mrs. Bevan's a little ashamed, a little perplexed,
and, perhaps, a little angry with the lecture which she
had received. But her official duties were all before her,
aud her spirits rose with the calls upon her exertions.
The accounts, accordingly, of one society were settled,
and the plan for the other arranged ; and the meeting for
the Irish attended ; and Mabel had the satisfaction every
where of finding herself employed as secretary, and con-
sulted as oraclefor persons are always glad to find

those who will take trouble off their hands, and never
hesitate to consult those whom they are not obliged to
follow. And, the work of the morning despatched, and
an invitation being accepted to eat a family dinner at
Mr. Morgan's at five o'clock, Mabel resolved to employ
her afternoon in a visit of charity. She would go and see
poor Mrs. Connell, and the burnt boy.
It was with some difficulty that she made her way
under a dirty archway, and over a heap of rubbish, through
the narrow, stilling and offensive alley in which the poor
family had taken refuge. Some tattered linen was hang-
ing to dry across it; heaps of dung and offal lay before the
doors ; and a few pale, miserable faces peered out of the
broken casements, as Mabel's black silk cloak, carefully
wrapped round her, was seen threading the low passage.
Every one prepared at once their tale of sorrow or com-
plaint. One had been neglected in the distribution of
blankets ; another's child had been whipped at the Na.
tional School, and would not be sent any more unless
the committee would scold the master; a third had
found fault with the soup ; a fourth was meditating how
to extract from Mabel an order on the Benevolent So.
ciety for wine for her sick child, then lying in a high
ever; and the fifth, a masculine, red-armed Amazon, had
taken those arms from the washing-tub before her, and
hastily wiping them, came forward, with no pacific voice,
to expostulate with and denounce poor Mabel for having
said something to Mr. Bentley in dispraise of her drunken
husband. One face only, a fair, soft, delicate face, still
bearing traces of great beauty, but worn with care and
sorrow,
shrunk back, as if trembling and ashamed, the
moment Mabel appeared, and hastily withdrew up the
stairs of one of the most miserable of the hovels. Mabel
herself had caught her eye, and started, for it was poor

National School, whom she had petted and brought for.
ward on every occasion, employing her as scribe and
monitor, and in a variety of other trustworthy offices,
even dressing her in her own cast-off clothes, and turning,
in fact, the poor girl's head, until, to Mabel's horror, a

change was perceived in her character and appearance :
her quickness became levity ; her eye, naturally lively
and open, now shrunk from meeting Mabel's ; and it
soon became too evident that Margaret was lost. Ma.
bel, indeed, did not abandon her ; exertions were made
by Mr. Bentley, and other influential persons, especially
by Mr. Brown, who employed George Wheeler in his
service ; and it was some satisfaction to Mabel to think
that all that could be done was done, and that George,
who had caused her ruin, was compelled to marry her.
Whatever strictness Mabel was inclined to enforce
in melancholy cases of this kind, she could not forget
that something was to blame in herself; and the moment
she caught sight of Margaret's humbled, penitent, anxious
face of patient suffering, she resolved to do what she had
not done before, and to visit her again. And she was
rather pleased to find, when asking for Mrs. Connell,
to hear that she and her husband and children had been
offered a shelter by Margaret herself, and were now
living under the same miserable roof. Making her way
past a little knot of dirty, ragged children, who were
playing with a crab-shell, and, young as they were, inter-
mixed their play with oaths and words which Mabel
could not hear without shuddering, she ascended the
ruinous staircase ; and her authoritative knock at the
door was answered by the bustling appearance of Mrs.
Connell, her black, ragged hair straggling from her torn
cap, and many symptoms indicating that she had not
passed a day of that total abstinence recommended by the
Temperance Society.
The room, however, was neater than Mabel had
usually found to be the case in similar alleys. The
broken panes were partially covered with paper. There
were one or two chairs with their full complement of
legs; a little range of crockery ornamented one wall ; a
common print of a Scripture subject, which Mabel recog-
nized as one of her own gifts to poor Margaret when
at school, was pinned over the fire-place; and two large
geraniums in the window gave something of an air of
refreshment and comfort. It was with some little difficul.

ty that Mabel made her way past the loquacie'us Mrs.
Connell, full of her own distresses and tales of complaint
against her drunken husband, to the heap of straw
covered with an old brown coat, which lay in the corner,
and on which the boy who had been burnt in the fire was
now stretched. He was asleep, and, just as Mabel
came to the bedside, a ray of light struggled through the
dim casement, and fell on his face. It was exquisitely
beautiful; the forehead open, the lips half closed and full
of intelligence and sweetness, the hair clustered thick in
natural ringlets, the ear delicately small, the nose finely
formed ; and, though childhood even amongst the poorest
is still full of beauty, Mabel was struck at something of a
higher character in the form before her. She stood
looking on him for some minutes, with that delight and
composure, not unmixed with melancholy thoughtfulness,
with which a sleeping child, helpless, unconscious, peace.
ful, pure, and yet surrounded with so many dangers, is
regarded by a feeling mind. And she did not turn away
till the boy, disturbed by some noise, threw out his arms,
opened his eyes, and, uttering an oath, and throwing
from him a Bible which Margaret had placed by his
side, once more composed himself to sleep. "Mabel shud-
dered again, and would have remonstrated with his
mother on permitting him to grow up in such habits, but
she had left the room ; and, on turning round to look for
her, she observed Margaret herself, who had endeavored
to escape observation by withdrawing behind a screen,
on which a new-washed shirt was hanging to dry, and
was affecting to busy herself with preparing something
in a pipkin over the scanty fire.
As Mabel approached her, she turned round, and.
almost sinking with shame, could not venture to lift uf
her eyes ; and, at the few kind but sad words with
which Mabel addressed her, she covered her face with
her hands, and, sinking in a chair, burst into tears.
Vith this sight all Mabel's severity vanished ; she spoke
to her once more as she had used to do ; and, as the sound
of her voice recalled past days and happier times, poor
Margaret's ago ay of weeping increased, and it was with

sore difficulty that Mabel composed her sufficiently to
proceed in some inqniries respecting her husband.
the word " husband, all Margaret's distress was again
aroused.
Where was he?"
" He had gone to find work at the quarries in the
forest."
" How was he going on?"
Margaret was silent.
66 Was he kind to her ?"
She faintly answered "Yes." But Mrs. Connell,
who had entered the room again, looked as if she were
very much disposed to say " No."
" Where was her infant ?'"
And here Margaret once more burst into a passion
of tears. "George had taken it with him to a rela-
tion's."
" Why?"
* To get it taken care of."
" But why not leave it with its mother ?"
" We were starving," said Margaret, " and he said
it would be beiter off."
" Was he fond of the child ?"
Margaret was silent, and Mrs. Connell could re-
frain no longer, and said, " No,"that he was " a
brute."
Margaret sprung from her chair, and put her hand
before the woman's mouth. But it was too late ; and,
with all the feelings of an Irish mother, in whom no
hardship and no distress can eradicate the love of her
children, even of her foster-children, Mrs. Connell pro-
ceeded to enlarge on George's bad conduct both to his
wife and his child ; but to the child especially-he
seemed to hate it. Mabel listened with great pain.
She thought how often love which ends in crime turns
into hatred, and how little hope there is of permanent
peace and comfort in an union which remorse and
shame must imbitter, and how hard it is to restore
what has once been broken by sin. But while Mrs.
Connell, unchecked by the imploring eyes of Margaret,

who yet could not deny her statements, was proceeding
in the full flow of her eloquent indignation, another
step, harsh and heavy, was heard ascending the creaking
staircase, and a short rude knock at the door was followed,
without waiting for an answer, by the entrance of another
person.
" Is your husband here?" said a rude, stern voice, to
Mrs. Connell, which, as Mabel's dress appeared from
bebind the screen, was softened down into something of
bland, hypocritical gentleness : "Is your husband here,
my good woman?" And, on looking up, Mabel saw a
middle-aged, stout man, with a hard iron face, rough
whiskers, and bushy hair, a patch upon the mouth, the
eyes small, and twinkling with deep lurking cunning,
yet capable of concealing their expression, and his dress
that of a butcher. But there was something about his
whole appearance singular and almost unnatural-a
certain contrast between his dress and his manner,
which was felt rather than understood, and an evident
desire to make observations upon others without being
able to face others himself. Mabel was struck equally
by his change of tone and manner when he perceived
who she was. He made way for her as she went up to
the place where the poor boy lay, and his bow was that
of a person capable of moving in a higher situation.
And it appeared that he now thought it necessary to
show some sympathy for the poor woman.
"How is he to-day?" he asked of Mrs. Connell; "is
he better?"
And, as he came up to the bed-side, the boy opened
his eyes, and a greeting took place between them as of
an old and a young associate, familiar with each other,
and of whom the elder had initiated the younger into
much that was evil : and the look with which he gazed
upon the boy did not escape Mabel. It passed over his
countenance for a moment, lighting it up with a strange
expression of exultation, and hate, and treachery, which
made Mabel feel uncomfortable in his presence. But it
was soon over ; and he turned to repeat his question,
" Where was Connell ?"

Mrs. Cornell herself seemed to stand before him in
awe and fear. She faltered out, " that he was at the
public-louse."
" As usual," muttered the man. " As usual. And
wly do you let him go there?"
*. Liow can I prevent it?" said the poor woman ;
he takes all he can, and leaves me to get on as I can;
and it is his only comfort. He does not sleep at night,
and can't get work in the day : and no one cares for us ;
and, to tell the truth, Mr. Pearce," she said, gaining
courage from despair, "it's bad days with us, and it were
better we were back in our own country.
Would to
God we had never left it ?"
" Pshaw! pshaw ! " was the reply, and he was about
to leave the room, when Margaret, trembling and fal.
tering, came up to him, and asked if he had seen her
nusband.
" Where is George, Mr. Pearce ?"
The man started and colored, but only for an in-
stant. "Up in the quarries, I suppose. How should I
know?" he said ; " am I to be answerable for all the
stray husbands in the place ?"
* But he told me," said Margaret,
66 that he was
going to see youthat you were to get him employ-
ment."
" Did he?" answered the man ; " then he told a lie,
and you were a fool for believing him."
And
you have not seen him, then?"
" How should I have seen him, I tell you again ! "
" And my baby," once more she faltered out you
have not seen it?'
The man uttered a coarse expression of impatience,
and, as Margaret burst into tears, he retreated bastily
out of the room
It was some little time before any one spoke after
this scene.
At last Mabel broke the silence by some
observations on the sick boy, who lay with his fine face
buried in a rough dirty heap of clothes, and apparently
sulky and impatient at being made the subject of re.
mark. It was in vain that Mabel addressed to him some

107
of the usual commonplaces on the duty of bearing pain
patiently ; on its being a warning ; on the necessity of
profiting by it ; on the opportunity which he now
enjoyed of reading the Bible and saying his prayers.
He either said nothing, or muttered some indistinct
sounds, which told more of sulkiness than gratitude : and
Mabel, as she withdrew, could not help lamenting to
Mrs. Connell how little he seemed to have profited by
sickness, and entreated her to remember the awful re-
sponsibility of rearing up her children in the way they
should go, and of the misery of seeing a son turn out ill.
There was a strange passive indifference in Mrs. Con-
nell's face as Mabel uttered the word " son," and a look
of intelligence in poor Margaret's eye, which, however,
did not intend to tell any tale. But Mabel observed
them not ; and, after leaving a trifle from the funds of a
District Visiting Society, and promising to call again,
she withdrew.
CHAPTER IX.
As she turned the corner by the back gate of the little
public-house called the Bricklayers' Arms, she once more
caught sight of the strange man whom she had just met.
But the repugnance which she had felt at his presence
made her tum away
her eyes.
And she did not notice
that, after looking up and down the street to observe
if any one saw him, and whistling at the same time
with an affectation of indifferonce, he slipped quietly into
the yard.
And we must follow him.
A nod of familiar recognition to a dirty, slipshod abi.
gail, who performed the domestic offices of the public-
house, and another to her equally dirty mistress, showed
that he was no stranger in the place ; and he entered
withou hesitation a little back room communicating with
the tap, where, round a deal tah'o covered with mugs of

beer and tobacco pipes, sat six or seven ill-looking,
ruffianly fellows, with rough caps on their heads, and
dresses such as are worn by navigators, excavators,
and persons employed on railroads.
His entrance
caused a movement among them. One or two took off
their caps ; others shuffled with their feet, as it prepared
to rise ; and all seemed awkward at first, as in the
presence of a superior. But he nodded to them with a
mixture of condescension and familiarity ; and they
were soon placed at their ease again by his taking up a
dirty newspaper stained with beer, from which one of
them had been reading, and asking what news. Before
an answer could be given he had exchanged a sign with
one of them who sat at the head of the table, and seemed
to possess some command over the rest, and to be better
dressed. And after a few words whispered between
them, the other left the room.
" And so, sir, we are to have an election after all,"
said one of the remaining party.
" And what good will an election do you ? " said a
shrewd, cynical-looking man at the bottom of the table,
who appeared to have had a somewhat better education
than the rest.
"What good will parliament or anything do us,"
rejoined another, " until we get the charter ?"
" And what good will the charter do you ?" said the
cynic.
"Why, give us what we want, and put all things
straight. Is it not a crying shame that with your repre-
sentative government, as you call it, here are we, the
thousands, ay, the millions, without any voice at all, or
any one to represent us, or care for us, or give us any-
thing but a jail for a poor-house, and Botany Bay for a
country residence ? If we are to have representatives, let
them be real onesmen who will do as we tell them,
and only speak what we choose to hear."
" Fine governors we should make ? " said the
cynic.
" And pray why not?" was the reply.

themselves ? cannot we find out what the people like,
and do it just as well as they can, and better too? We'd
soon make short work of it. Down wlth your civil
list ! down with your pensions ! down with your corn-
laws--and your landlords, grinding the poor to death
that they may put their high rents into their pockets !
Down with your poor-bastilles !

" And dukes, and princes, and marquises, and lords,
and all the crew of them!" said another.
" Here's a health to them all Mr. Pearce !" and he
turned his glass upside down, and looked up significantly
in the face of the last comer.
"And your taxes," rejoined Pearce himself, - and
your tithes, and your church-rates, and your parliament
clergy, your archbishops with 50,000 a year, and your
bishops with 20,000, and your parsons, who, having
plundered the Catholics, would now willingly burn and
hang them, and send over an army to Ireland to extirpate
what they call the bloody papists-do you say, "down'
with these, too?"
"Ay, ay, down with them all!" rose at once in a
chorus from the whole table; " down with them all-
the sooner the better."
"And how will you down with them?" asked Pearce,
winking, and looking at them with a cold sarcastic smile
on his lips; " what is the use of your talking when men
should be acting?"
" And we are going to act, are we not?" was the
reply.
Going!" said Pearce; " cowards are always going
to act. What have you done to prepare yourselves when
the time comes?"
"Something," said one of the youngest ; and he threw
a heavy stick upon the table, which Pearce took
up
and
examined, feeling one end of it, and drawing out a short
pointed weapon which fixed into it.
" Sharp-pretty sharp," he muttered, as he closed it
up
" Sharp enough," said its ownes

i* And do you intend to use this?" said Pearce.
66 Use it?" cried five or six voices at once, and the
whole party opened their eyes as if in astonishment at
the question coming from such a quarter-"Use it?
Why, what have you sent Blacker to us for, if we are
not to use them?"
" I send Blacker to you!" said Pearce.
"I wish
you to use them! Who ever heard me say any thing of
the kind ? I recommend you all to claim your rights as
Englishmen; and if they attempt to put you down by
force, why, rather than have your necks straightened on
the gallows, it might be as well to try something else.
But my advice is, obey the law.
Alter the law if you
can, but do not break it; it only does harm. Show
yourselves in a strong attitude; let your enemies and
your persecutors see that you can defend yonrselves.
Moral force is invincible. This is what I recommend,
and always shall. So Blacker will tell you: he is a fine
fellow, and you cannot have a better leader."
There was a curious mixture of blank surprise and
disappointment in the faces of all assembled, as Pearce
uttered these words and turned whistling to the window.
" But I thought, Mr. Pearce," said one of them, at
length taking courage, "I thought Blacker had orders
from you?"
" Orders from me!" fiercely cried Pearce as he
turned round sharply on the speaker. "Orders from me,
Blacker!"as the man who seemed the leader of the
gang re-entered the room Blacker! have you told
these men that I have given you ordersthat I have any
thing to do with this?" and he took up the dagger-stick.
" I?" said Blacker, stammering. " No, sir, never.
No one ever heard me say any thing of the kind. I told
them you were a friend to the people, and wished them
to have their rights, and were no monopolist or aristocrat :
that is all. If any one says more than this, it is quite a
mistake."
"Quite a mistake, quite a mistake," hastily repeated
Pearce. " Moral influence is what I recommend

imposing attitude ;-show your strengthbut do not
violate the laws! do not violate the laws!"
He then whispered a word to Blacker-received a
short answer, and, with a hurried good morning, he left
the room.
" Now that is what I call courage !" said the cynic ;
and others seemed inclined to say the same.
But Blacker took his seat at the head of the table, and,
making a sign for silence, soon drew their attention to
other things. There were signs and countersigns ex-
changed, mysterious communications respecting Lodges
and Brethren, and work to be done. Several produced
weapons like the one exhibited before ; and the aspect
of fierce determination, with which they gradually re-
garded each other and their leader, brightened with satis-
faction when Blacker pulled out a handful of sovereigns
and proceeded to divide them.
" And now, Captain Blacker" said the cynic, as he
pocketed his money, " you are a great man, and a clever
man among us poor ignorant fellows, who cannot read or
write; but may such a stupid fellow as I am take the
liberty of asking where all this comes from ?"
"Comes from ?" replied Blacker, with a laugh.
" Who minds where his money comes from, when he finds
it
snug in his own pocket ? Do not trouble yourself about
that."
Why, I do not trouble myself much about anything,"
said the cynic, chinking the money in his hand; " it is
all the same to me, if I get my pot of beer and my warm
fire-side, how the world goes with other people. But
that fellow, Pearce, they say he has plenty of these," and
he held up a sovereign to the light; " and you seem to
be pretty good friends with him. Eh, Captain ?"
Blacker laughed again, but with a look which checked
further inquiry, and contented himself with saying that the
business was over and he must go. " One thing," he
added, "
you may be sure of, my lads. There are people
cleverer and greater than I or Mr. Pearce or any one in
this place, who will be very glad to see you have your
rights, and won 'mind assisting you if you help yourselves

HAWKSTONE.
Only remember your business : mind your oath, keep
your counsel, do not get drunk, stand by your brethren,
and obey your captain. Is not this it ???
"Yes, yeswe will, we will," and Blacker left them.
As he passed by a little room at the other end of the
passage, the door was ajar, and he was beckoned into it
by Pearce, who was standing to watch for him. The
door was shut after him; and Pearce, drawing himself
up to his full height, and planting himself with an air of
determined and commanding authority within a few feet
of him, sternly demanded what he meant by letting those
fellows suppose there was any communication between
them. Blacker, a man clever and self-possessed, but
evidently under the control of Pearce, and awed by him
as by a master, hesitated and colored, and began to ex-
cuse himself and deny it.
" None of your excuses or denials," said Pearce ; " you
know who I am, and you know that I know everything.
Never tell me a lie !" and he fastened on him a look of
penetrating and contemptuous significance which Blacker
could not face.
" You have not told them anything," said Pearce, after
a pause. "I know that well enough. But you have al.
lowed them to suspect, and with us that is as bad. Re-
member your oath, sir; and remember that if I have but
two eyes in my head, I have a hundred in my pocket, and
hands too-hands," he muttered in a low but audible
whisper, " which will do anything I bid them, and which
never spare a traitor."
The word "traitor" restored Blacker to his self-pos-
session. He came forward, protested against deserving
such a charge, acknowledged that he might have been
careless, promised that he would take care to remove any
impression of the kind ; and Pearce, receiving his ex-
cuses, shook hands with him at last, and apparently re-
stored him to favor. " And now go," he added, " and
send that brute Connell to me directly. Stop," he cried,
as Blacker was leaving the room; "I have one more
thing to say. Come back, and shut the door Have you
seen him to-day?"

"He was at the inn this morning at eleven o'clock, I
know," said Blacker; " and afterwards he went to At-
kinson's, for I watched him there ; and canny Charles
was to watch him afterwards. George the o-tler told
me they thought he was going away in a day or two."
" Did they know who he was ?" asked Pearce.
"No," replied Blacker.
" And you did not give them a hint ?"
" Not I. I merely stood about in the yard when they
were talking about him, and so found out what he was
doing."
" Has he seen Connell yet, and the boy ?"
"Yes, yesterday morning. Connell told me he came
to Wheeler's wife, saw the boy, and seemed struck with
him. Connell said it was quite strange to see him. The
boy behaved ill, and swore, upon which Connell had a
sermon given him, and something was said about his being
sent to school."
Very good, very good," muttered Pearce ; " this will
do. Has he been to the Priory yet ?"
" Not yet, I am sure," said Blacker, " for I have had
my eye on him ever since
you ordered and he cannot
have gone anywhere without my knowing it."
"Let me know," said Pearce, " when he does go ; for
it cannot be long first. And so the old Lord is come
back? You will have an eye there too, Blacker, and an
eye on my Lady."
"I saw her go up to the Priory about an hour ago,"
said Blacker, "in a little low phton, with a servant on
horseback."
" To the Priory?" muttered Pearce. "Humph! And
where is he now ?"
Canny Charles will tell me this evening," said
Blacker.
" Find out if he is gone to the Priory too," said
Pearce, " and let me know at once.
I shall be at my
lodgings all the evening. And now, good day."
But, once more, Blacker was called back before the
door had closed, and Pearce, shutting it carefully after him,
and looking round the 'oom as if afraid lest the walls had

cars, came up to him, and laying his hand on his shoulder,
and looking fixedly in his face, said to him in a low voice,
" Are you sure of Wheeler ?"
" As sure as I am of myself," was the answer.
Humph !" muttered Pearce. And once more look.
ing Blacker in the face, as if he would penetrate into the
very bottom of his thoughts"He knows things," said
Pearce, in the same low distinct voice, " he knows things
which he should not know, and he has threatened to dis-
close them."
" Has he ?" asked Blacker, as if alarmed.
" It is against our laws," said Pearce--and he paused.
"And our laws must be obeyed," he continued.
For a moment Blacker seemed to shudder and recoil
from Pearce's touch; but Pearce, with the same fixed,
searching, significant gaze, retained his hold of him.
"Our laws must be obeyed," he repeated, " and to the
letter, or all is lost. Blacker, my fine fellow, there must
he no finchiug."
"I never thought of flinching," said Blacker sulkily,
and yet seemingly nerving himself to hear the rest.
" I never thought you did," said Pearce ; "I know
you too well." And with an encouraging clap on the
shoulder, and a relaxation of his countenance, he let go
his hold. Blacker seemed to recover and take breath, as
if from a species of fascination.
Keep watch on him," said Pearce"and that is all."
There was something significant in Blacker's eyes, as
he looked up and repeated " That is all ?"
" Yes, all that is all :" and then, as if correcting
himself, " for the present, that is."
"Very well," said Blacker.
"Good bye. And now send Connell."
It was some time before Connell arrived, and in the
meanwhile Pearce paced backwards and forwards along
the sanded floor of the little room, with his arms folded,
and resting every now and then, as if in intense thought,
with his forehead on the mantel-piece. Once his dark,
gloomy, but energetic eye caught a gaudy-colored print
like a valentine over the fireplace. It represented threo

hearts transfixed with arrows, with the words " Mary,
Jesus, and Joseph" over them, and a devotional inscrip-
tion at the bottom, containing an invocation to all three.
He crossed himself at the sight, muttered over some form
of words, which might have been an Ave Maria, and then
relapsed into thoughtfulness, from which he was disturbed
by a low knock at the door.
" There are no letters, sir, to-day," said a little girl
who opened it with fear and trembling. "But here is a
parcel come by the coach. Three and sixpence, sir, to
pay,
from Preston."
Pearce took the parcel, and eagerly tore it open.
Some papers containing lists of names and printed tracts,
apparently for circulation, he put into his pocket, and then
sat down to open a letter in cypher, which it cost him
some trouble to translate.
" The cypher changed again," he muttered.
they are more cautious than ever. Has there been any
treachery, I wonder ?" and he proceeded to read : " You
will have no more letters by the post yet, for the post-of-
fice people have noticed the foreign letters. Govern.
ment has got wind of something. F. C. will forward
those from Lyons in a parcel by coach to the Hen and
Chickens.' Humph! more caution. You have com-
mitted yourself to Wheeler. He is not one of us, and
never will be, and has his own views and plans, and you
will never be able to make use of him as you propose.
He has even threatened, unless we do what he wishes.
He is too sharp and too wicked for you. If you cannot
get the papers from him quietly, we must not mind-
(here was a blank.) He might ruin us all.'
"Fools!" said Pearce, impatiently. " Fools, to think
I needed to be told this!  You will send us word regu-
larly of V.'s movements. He has sold his Yorkshire
property-we learned this by X. Z., and has made up
his mind to live at the P. You will let us know how long
he remains at H., and whether he goes to the castle and
sees L. E. She is quite firm ; and at present so is he,

have resolved on waiting patiently a little longer, and
making another trial."
As Pearce came to these last words he laid down the
letter with a cool smile, which implied no little contempt
of the writer, and no inclination to enter into bis views.
6. Another trial!" he muttered. " Have they not had
trials enough already? Do they think to bring him
round now, with his obstinacy and what he calls his
conscience, when he has once got out of their net ?
They might have done it once, when he was younger
and knew nothing ; but he has fallen into other hands
now, and they are no match for him. No!" and he
looked up triumphantly, "those two will never be one
now ; and, what is more, they never shall be. Never !
never! I have sworn it by my hatred and my vengeance
-sworn it on my knees, if my hand and the power it
wields can prevent it. Never! never !" and it would
have given a study for the picture of a fiend to have
watched his face as he uttered these words. But the
paroxysn of passion was momentary. Ile smothered it
over, assumed the same cold iron cast of countenance,
and proceeded to decypher the letter. "If all fails, and
he will not come over, we must try something else. He
must not be allowed to remain at H., where he will do
us great harm. He makes no secret of his intentions,
and will work against us in every possible way. But
you will take no steps to attack him till you hear from
If he can be brought over by fair means, well and
good ; if not, we must be rid of him in some other way.'"
"Rid of him in some other way !" repeated Pearce.
" Rid of him in some other way! Yes, there are many
other ways of getting rid of him. Men have been driven
from their homes by disgust, by disappointment, by threats,
by abuse, by calumny, by fear. There is no difficulty in this.
But this would not be vengeance-not my vengeance.
To make him drink of his own cupto stab him with
his own dagger--to have him here with

foot
upon
his neck, and tell him it was I who did it." He stood
fixed in the very posture which he would have assuined
had his deadly enemy been lying under his feet ; and

his ejo lighted up with fierce exultation. The letter,
however, was not finished ; and with the air of a man
who could shake off all personal feeling, and apply
himself at once to business, he reverted to it.
6. You
will beware of the Abb : he is still at the old Lord's ;
but he is, you know, a mere Protestant at heart, and you
must not trust him. We shall soon have bim removed,
and you may communicate freely with the person who
comes in his stead. Of course you will do what can be
done for the Liberals at the election. Make use of
Wheeler's set if you can safely. But again remember
that he has his own plans, and must not be trusted, and
unless he gives up
the
papers,
all
may
be lost. Write to
us every other day if you have anything to communicate,
and send your letters under cover to X. Z.'
Pearce had scarcely time to read the end of the
letter, when he heard another knock at the door, and,
with a heavy lumbering tread, his face inflamed with
habits of intoxication, his eyes bloodshot, and an expres.
sion of haggardness and fear in his lip and mouth, Con.
nell came in.
Drinking again, sirrah !" said Pearce to him in
the same cold stern voice which he had assumed towards
Blacker. " Drinking again!"
Connell, like every other person who came into
contact with this singular personage, seemed to quail
under his eye, and stammered out some excuse.
" I will have no excuses," said Pearce. 66 You have
been at the public-house all this morning, and all yes.
terday afternoon."
Connell attempted to deny it.
"How dare you," said Pearce, in his low, distinct
voice, which seemed to thrill through and fascinate his
hearer; "how dare
you
tell a lie to me who know every-
thing that you say and do? You went at four o'clock

to-night, and help him. You know whom I meat
And now, when I know every word you utter, and
everything you do, how dare you tell me a lie ?"
The poor wretch, as if aghast at the presence of a
supernatural being, listened without a word of reply, and
showed by his silence the accuracy of Pearce's statement.
" I tell you again," said Pearce, "that I have eyes in
every place, and tongues to tell me everything Never
lie to me, for it is of no use. And now, sirrah, give me
a true account of all that passed when the gentleman
who saved the boy came to see him. Tell me every-
thing, at your peril!"
Connell, faltering and frightened, endeavored, but
very imperfectly, to give a clear narrative, and Pearce
listened patiently without interrupting it. He knew
human nature too well to attempt to hasten him. It
appeared by Connell's story that the stranger had made
inquiries the day after the fire, and had found out Mar.
garet's lodging, with the view of giving the poor people
some relief; that on seeing the boy he seemed struck, as
Connell expressed it, all of a heap ; had stood gazing
on him, as he lay on the straw, with a look of painful
surprise, as if struggling to retrace past circumstances,
and bring to light some dim and indistinct vision. He
had lifted the cluster of brown hair from the boy's fore-
head ; spoken to him with a voice softened and sad, as it
with an interest deeper than that of ordinary benevo-
lence ; had returned more than once to look on him,
and had groaned heavily as a ray of light fell more
full on his face. It was not till the boy spoke, and spoke,
as he had done to Mabel, in language which revoltea
the ear, that the stranger turned away, as if in disgust
and disappointment ; and rebuked both Connell and his
wife for permitting one so young to be brought up in
such profaneness and vice. Even then he called Connell
aside, and interrogated him closely on his family, the
number of his children, the age of the boy, where he
was born, and other questions of the kind.
"To all which," said Pearce, at this point of the
story, " you answered properly ?"

thing?"
And now,
Yes, sir," said Connell.
" And boldly?" asked Pearce.
"Yes, sir, as you told me."
"Did he seem to have any doubt, or suspect any.
Nothing," answered Connell.
You are sure, nothing ?"
"Quite sure," said Connell.
"And then," said Pearce, " he offered to send him
to school, did he not ?."
"He did," said Connell. 66 And I told him I must
think of it."
"Very good," said Pearce. 66 You will let me know
when you see him again. And you will give no answer
of any kind till I have told you what to do.
man, tell me what Wheeler gives you for helping him at
the Ruins to-night?"
Once more Connell seemed aghast at the secret
knowledge which Pearce possessed of all his move-
ments. " Five shillings, and beer," he stammered out.
" And you are to carry away what you have
to the quarries to-night? How many of these things have
you got there ?" And he pulled out of his pocket a
pikehead weapon of the same kind as that which had
been produced by one of the gang in the other room.
" I do not know," said Connell.
"How many carts are there to be ?"
" Two," said Connell.
" And pray how came Wheeler to trust you, a
drunken sot as you are, with this piece of work ?
Why,
for five shillings and a pot of beer you would betray
your own father!"
"I won't betray him," said Connell.
Why should
I ? What should I get by it ?"
There was a pause, during which Pearce collected
his countenance into the same piercing, steadfast look
with which he had awed Blacker, and, coming up close
to the ruffian, he said, in the same low, distinct voice,
But Wheeler could betray you!"
Connell started, as if shot. The blood forsook biz

cheeks, and he turned to Pearce with a look of the most
abject, supplicating terror. Without appearing to notice
it, Pearce continued looking steadfastly on him, and again
attered the same words, " But Wheeler could betray

" Who told him ? " exclaimed Connell.
told him ? I never confessed to any one but the priest.
No one upon earth knows it but the priest and you."
And in the same low, distinct tone of voice, Pearce
whispered, " Wheeler knows it, and can give you up at
any time. And this is why he has employed you for a
work which, if you chose to peach, would cost him his
own neck."
The poor criminal sunk down in a chair, and trem-
bled from head to foot. Pearce allowed him a few
minutes to recover ; hut he had no intention of relieving
him from his fear. He pulled a newspaper out of his
pocket, and, casting his eye over a file of notices and ad.
vertisements, proceeded to read one which described
Connell's person exactly, and offered a large reward of
more than 5001 to any one who would give information
which might lead to his apprehension.
" Wheeler," said Pearce again," has seen this, and
he is a needy man, and a cunning man ; and no one
here has seen it but himself and me. You are in his
power,
and for that reason he ventures to trust you.
But he has been to the police, and, I suspect, about
this."
Connell's hat had fallen on the floor, his arms had
dropt, as if lifeless by his side, and the sweat broke out
in large drops upon his forehead, while Pearce, so far
from comforting or encouraging him, proceeded to read
the advertisement again, comparing every point of the
description with Connell's appearance, and going over
hem slowly and steadily, as if wholly insensible to, or
even taking pleasure in, the agony of his victim. At
last Connell could bear it no longer, and he fell down on
his knees, and, wringing his hands, entreated Pearce to
save him.
" You can save me, you know you can !" he cried ;
## p. 121 (#133) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
121
so you can do anything,you proinised you would,
you saved me once before when you brought me from
Ireland!"
" I can save you, I know," said Pearce, " if only we
can stop Wheeler's mouth. He's a troublesome and a
dangerous fellow, and 5001 would soon tempt him. He
has seen the paper, and he knows you did it, and can
give information all about it,which would hang you up in a
minute ; and, as I tell you, I have seen him talking with
the policeman. Nobody else has seen it, and there are
no placards here, nor likely to be, or I can stop them ;
so you are quite safe, except from him.
" How did Wheeler find it out?" asked Connell,
falteringly.
"I am sure I do not know," said Pearce, "but he
told me all about it; told
me where
you
hid the
gun
after
the shot was fired; and how, when the old man struggled,
you knocked him back with the butt-end; and where
you
threw away the frieze coat; and about the marks on your
waistcoat;"-and, with his eyes fixed steadily on the
convulsed countenance of Connell, he proceeded slowly:
* He knew every word the old man said; how he begged
for mercy, and prayed, you might not go to hell for it;
and spoke to you of the tithes he had forgiven you, and
the potatoes he used to send you through the famine."
" Connell put his hands before his face, and groaned
with anguish. "Oh, Mr. Pearce!" he cried, " if
had not put it into my head, I should never have done it!
He never did me any harm, except putting me out of
that bit of potato ground."
" I put it into your head, man!" said Pearce; "how
could I put it into your head? I told you, if a parson
kept you out of your rights, you might give him a little
fright, that was alland then you went and shot him!"
" You told me," said Connell, " that he was a parson,
and all parsons ought to be got rid of; and you said he
was an enemy of our religion, and cursed by the blessed
Pope, and the devil; and that there was no harm in
getting rid of devils; and then you said there would be
no difficulty, and I might make a clean breast of it at

confession, and do a little penance, and a] would be
right, and I should get the ground, and no one be the
wiser; and this was the way to make ould Ireland free.
I remember every word, as well as if it were yesterday;
and the devil put it all into my
heart. Would to God I
had been murdered myself rather than have done it!"
" Pooh! pooh!" said Pearce, "what is all this fuss
about? It is not the first parson who has been punished
in Ireland for keeping what does not belong to him, and
it won't be the last; and you are no worse than others.
The only thing to think about is how we shall stop
Wheeler's mouth-that dangerous, treacherous fellow; I
would not trust my own life in his hands for a mint of
money." "Eh!" he added, and looked aside at Connell,
as if hoping that a thought might suggest itself to him,
without requiring to be expressed. "Eh!" he repeated,
"how are we to stop his mouth ?"and, as if leaving
the question to work its way, he went to the window,
and whistled.
Connell once more buried his face in his hands, and
continued silent.
" At what o'clock," said Pearce, after a pause, and
turning sharply round, are you to be at the Ruins to-
night?"
66
" Ten o'clock," said Connell.
Any moon ?" said Pearce.
" I do not know," answered Connell, doggedly.
Any one to be with you?" asked Pearce.
" No," said Connell, in the same dogged way.
Pearce went again to the window, and began again
to whistle.
" He's a vile heretic, that Wheeler," he
continued, " and one that will do us mischief; " and, as
he uttered the words, a careful observer might have
detected a little faltering in the voice, as if arising from
a momentary swelling in the throat; but he stifled it
with a short cough, and the cough broke the stupor in
which Connell seemed sunk.
" I thought," he said, "he was a friend of yours, Mr.
Pearce ?"
"No friend of mine," said Pearce : "I tried to bring

worthy fellow. Wheeler has got too much of the devil
in him; and he knows a great deal more than is quite
convenient, more especially for your neck, Connell.--eh,
man! A rope and a gallows, and no priest to anoint
you; no pleasant prospect !"
But Wheeler won't peach," said Connell; " why
should he give me up? Why, I could give him up, for
all that."
" Ay, ay, so you could; but pray what would you
gain by that ? How would it save your own neck from
paying forfeit for the parson's bullet, by putting Wheeler
into gaol for his tricks with those arms? And, after all,
he would only be tried, and perhaps acquitted; or the
lawyers would let there be some flaw in the parchment;
or else there would come down a warrant from the
Secretary of State, and he would only be sent to Botany
Bay, and get a good place there, or be returned to his
family. Why, they could easily get up a petition for him,
and find plenty of members of parliament to threaten
ministers if they did not let him go; and ministers do not
like to provoke people now-a-days. But it would be
very different with you, my man. They may not mind
much in Ireland; but you are in England now, and
English people have not much sympathy with shooting
at landlords and parsons, though they are Protestants,
and do like to let their own land as they choose. I
suspect, man, your chance would be small."
Connell once more let his hands drop as in despair.
And Pearce continued standing at the window, and
affected to watch the drops of rain which were chasing
each other down the glass.
" Are you sure," he said, once more, " there will be
ne but you two to-night!"
" Not till the carts come," said Connell, " and they
are not to be there till ten o'clock."
" Humph!" muttered Pearce. " He's a slight,
weakly fellow, that Wheeler; I could twist him round
my thumb."

are
" Not when he has his pistols with him," said
Connell.
" Does he always carry pistols ?" said Pearce.
"Always on such nights," answered Connell, sharply;
and there was another pause.
" That's a deep well in the Priory court," said Pearce,
" by the great yew-tree; how many feet of water are
there in it?"
" Twenty," muttered Connell, " or thereabouts ;''
and they were silent again.
" There was a man," continued Pearce, " in Hawk.
stone, some years back, who fell into a well, and was
never heard of again for thirty years, when they found
his skeleton in cleaning it out."
" Connell was silent; but something had come across
his mind, and he started up, and, confronting Pearce,
who endeavored to avoid his eyes, said, with a voice in
which bitterness of suffering was mingled with anger,
and scorn, and defiance, " Mr. Pearce," he said,
you the foul fiend himself, or only his head clerk ? Blood
enough already, for your head and mine! Blood enough
already!" And he left the room.
Pearce stood for some minutes motionless, half-
alarmed, half-surprised, and chilled with that shame and
remorse, which even the most hardened and most guilty
cannot shake off, when rebuked by inferiors guilty like
themselves. But his was not a mind to give way to such
feelings. He whistled, as if to turn the current of his
thoughts; and once more began pacing the room. He
uttered nothing; but his thoughts were dark and deep,
and showed themselves in the workings of his stern and
malignant features. They were thoughts of a vast and
deep-laid conspiracy, in which the fate of kingdoms was
involved, and in which, though a subordinate, he was an
active and accomplished agent. They reverted to the
days of his youth, when he had been taken up by one of
its most penetrating leaders, and tutored in all the mys-
terious craft of intrigue--an intrigue of which religion
was the pretext, and ambition the mainspring, and which
was carried on by a machinery at once so gigantic in its

125
extent, so secret in its operations, so united in its com.
bination, so steady and undeviating in its aim, and so
adapted in all its parts to the passions and wants of
human nature, that to a human eye nothing could resist
it, or save even thrones and kingdoms from falling under
the rod of a religious tyranny. He thought of the lessons
which he had there, received; of acquiring power, and
exercising it remorselessly and fearlessly, with one sole
view to the aggrandisement of his society; of the modes
by which the minds of men might be laid open, and be
made slaves to those who were privy to their weakness
and crimes; of the grand rule of all worldy ambition,
" divide et impera," set friend against friend, power
against power, and you become master of both. He
took from his pocket the papers which had reached him
in the packet, and contemplated with exultation the
account there given of the progress of their influence,
and the increase of their revenues; while the goveri.-
ments and countries over which they were stretching
their arms in secret sat still in unsuspecting confidence,
unconscious of the mischief which was working in their
very vitals. To be engaged in the management of such
a secret and gigantic plot was in itself full of interest and
excitement to a mind like his. It gave him, palled as
he was at an early age with a licentious life, something
still to stimulate his enterprise and feed his imagination,
It exercised all the powers of a penetrating and calculat.
ing intellect: it gave him a personal importance which
atoned for the degrading sense of dependence and inferi-
ority to which his low birth had exposed him in early
life; and the bitterness of which, to his haughty spirit,
had been aggravated by the contemptuous repulses which
he had encountered in his effort to obtain a footing in
higher classes of society: and if it held out a prospect of
revenge upon the classes who had thus despised him, it
touched him also in a tenderer point; without which,
perhaps, he would never have thrown himself, with his
whole heart and soul, into the position which he then
occupied--a position of great risk, requiring the utmost
delicacy of management-bringing him into contact with

agents whom it was impossible to employ without risking
treachery on their part, and whom he could only hope to
control by playing them one against the other, and
fearlessly resolving to sacrifice any of them the moment
they became dangerous. Pearce had his private ends
and personal ambition; and his ambition was a longing
for revenge. It burned in his breast with a deep, steady,
resolved hatred, which never allowed a thought of pity
to come before it and its victim; and which, if ever
conscience intruded for a moment, threw itself at once
into the form of justice-of a deserved and equitable
requital for a deadly injury; and assumed even the
appearance of piety, because the same blow which laid
the being whom he hated at his feet, laid prostrate also
the enemy of his faith, and the determined and dangerous
antagonist of the religious body to which he was solemnly
Hledged, and in whose prosperity he was told that the
ii terests of Christendom were involved.
But the thoughts could not continue for ever. There
was work, active work, to be done. A few minutes
later, a respectable clerical-looking person, with his face
closely shaven, a dark head of hair, and a pair of green
spectacles which completely covered his eyes, issued
from a little garden gate, which communicated with a
back street of Hawkstone; and, after threading one or
two narrow lanes without any houses in them, he opened
another similar door by a private key, and soon found
himself in the little study of the Rev. Patrick O'Leary,
the bland, liberal, and accomplished Roman priest, who
had recently settled in Hawkstone to superintend the
erection of what the people persisted in calling a new
Catholic Chapel.

CHAPTER X.
With Bentley's narrow income, and the numberless calls
upon it, the loss of his watch, which he valued also as a
legacy from an old aunt, was a very serious considera.
tion : and he resolved to retrace his steps to the ruins in
the hope of recovering it. It never occurred to him, that
as the obligation of the Temperance Society only bound
men to abstain from one sin, and this on the ground of its
inconvenience, a member of the society might feel no dif.
ficulty about a distinct sin, particularly where tempting
from its convenience. And he did not recollect, that,
just as he was entering the archway into the ruins, there
had been a little crowd and crushing of some bystanders,
in the midst of which it was not impossible that his watch
had either been stolen or forced from his pocket. He
walked, therefore, as fast as he was able, back through the
park. But the sun had already set. The sound of the re.
turning band, as it entered the High Street of Hawkstone,
reached him from a distance, and told him that he would find
the ruins deserted. Twilight was coming on, and, if Bent-
ley had honestly confessed, he would have acknowledged
that he preferred a visit to the Priory in broad daylight. As
the thought came across him, he laughed at his own folly,
and walked towards it so much the faster. And yet
notions, and fancies, and idle tales, which were current
about the place, would occur to him. For there was a
gloom and an evil destiny which seemed to hang over the
spot, and the family to which it belonged ; and many
were the stories which tradition preserved, some old and
some more recent, which, mixed up with popular su-
perstitions, almost seemed to imply that a curse from
Heaven lay upon them. In the vault underneath the
Oratory there lay, not the remains, but the place where
the remains should have lain, of Sir Roger de Hawk.

stone, the bold, profligate courtier of Henry VIII., by
whose arm the monarch had expelled the monks, plun-
dered their possessions, including the most sacred orna-
ments of the chapel and the altar, and made over the
whole property around to his avaricious minion. And
the remains of Sir Roger de Hawkstone never reached
their place of rest in holy ground. He was seized
suddenly with his death-pangs in the midst of a mad,
drunken revel, in the hall of his new house, the hall
which, after the example of the Protector Somerset, he
had built out of the fragments of the consecrated cloister,
and, like most of the nobility of that day, had hung with
tapestry, and adorned its sideboards with chalices and
plate, which he had plundered from the chape! itself.
He died, and the room where they laid him in state caught
fire with the torches ; and before the flames were got
under, the whole wing of the house was a mass of ruins;
and only one blackened mutilated limb could be discerned
and extricated to give it the mockery of a Christian
burial. By that lay his two wives ; one who had died
by poison, administered, it was always believed, by her
own husband ; the other, in giving birth to a still-born
child. By them lay three children, all childlesstwo
daughters and one son,---the son snatched away in his
boyhood ; the eldest daughter killed with a broken
heart ; the youngest, the proud, haughty Lady Eleanor,
childless also, and brought to her grave with hands
stained with blood and a tainted fame. Then followed
another branch of the family, of whom but one, the good
Sir James, had escaped the hereditary curse. His
successor was murdered by a mob close by the tall ash-
tree which shot up by the Priory's chimney. His son,
Sir Hildebrand, had left behind him a name of vice, and
debauchery, and superstition, with which mothers in the
neighborhood would frighten unruly children, and threaten
them with the " wicked Sir Hildebrand." Then came
a son who was driven from his estate by a dishonest law-
suit, and the property passed into a line, which had
gradually encumbered it with debt, harassed the tenants,
ported with some of its finest portions, involved itsels

nent, where he died, and his only son laid him, not in
the
grave of his fathers, but in the Strangers' Cemetery at
Rome. But, before that, another name had been addea
to the melancholy catalogue,-a name never pronounced
by any of the older peasantry without an affectionate and
reverent sorrow--the good Lady Esther. She was the
wife of General Villiers, and daughter of John, Earl of
Claremont, whose estates adjoined the Priory. And like
her father, she was a Roman Catholic, but a Catholic
more than a Romanist ; scarcely tainted with the sins of
Popery, and a character such as might be formed, and, we
may trust, has often been formed, in the school of Fenelon,
Pascal, and Borromeo. Even she had not escaped the
general inheritance of evil; compelled by her father,
against her will, to marry General Villiers, she had found
him cunning, narrow-minded, jealous, and revengeful.
One son was born to them, whom she was permitted to
bring up for a few years, and whom, as far as childhood
can be formed, she had formed to be the image of her
own character. About that time the embarrassments of
the General thickened on him ; his temper became
soured, his conduct tyrannical ; losing all sense of
religion himself, the deep, earnest piety of his wife
provoked from him only contempt and persecution. And,
without listening to her earnest and tearful prayers, he
took her child, now grown to be a boy, from her care,
carried him abroad, and left her to linger out one year
and three months in patient, solitary suffering, and then to
be borne amidst the tears and blessings of the poor to her
last earthly resting-place in the Priory of Hawkstone.
And even beyond Lady Esther the curse seemed to
continue. At the death of General Villiers, the title to
the large estates of Hawkstone had been disputed. His
son remained abroad for years, under circumstances which
no one understood ; and even now, when his title had
been acknowledged, and his fortune increased by a con.
siderable bequest from an vn:'e, it was reported in Hawk.

stone that Ernest Villiers had become himself embai
rassed ; that his estates in Yorkshire were to be sold ,
that he was about to turn Papist, if he had not become
one already; and, as the only mode of escaping from
his difficulties, he was to marry his cousin, Lady Eleanor,
not a very probable combination : but the sale of the
Yorkshire estates had been announced that very day in
the papers, and Bentley, as he approached the ruins,
sighed to think of the futility and mutability of all earthiy
grandeur.
Before he descended the brow of the valley, the
twilight had deepened so much that he found it difficult
to search for his watch along the path which he was re-

stede's Oak ; for this also had its tale, and a tale of
sorrow. It was named from a village legend of the
last prior, a weak but not vicious man, who had been
harassed and persecuted by Cromwell unuil, in an evil
hour, he consented to surrender the Priory to the king,
rather than risk the miserable fate of the monks of the
Charter House of London, five of whom had already died
under the hardships of their usage ; five were brougkt,
by the severity of their imprisonment, to the brink of
death, and many others had been executed. But no
was the surrender made, than the most bitter
remorse had seized him.
When the visitors came to carry
off the vestments and plate, he had stood on the steps of
the altar, and solemnly denounced the sacrilege, repeating
the curse imprecated by the founder of the Priory upon
all who should disturb his gifts. When forced to desist
by one of the commissioners, he had gone to the foot of
the old oak, and, there gathering round him the peas.

the wrath of God. He had then left them, and wandered,
no one knew whither, till one morning he was found
lying on his face, cold and stiffened, with his hands
clasped, as in prayer, under the old oak tree, turned to
the already demolished Priory, as if he had come to die
at least within sight of its walls. And none of the
villagers liked to pass at night near the Silkstede Oak.
Many were the fearful appearances which were recorded
to have been seen there ; and latterly they had singularly
inultiplied. When the keepers made their morning
rounds, the trampled grass and broken bushes betrayed
that persons had been there in the night; it was
generally supposed poachers. Voices had been beard,
and even figures seen, about the ruins by late market
people. And even Mr. Morgan had laughingly told
Bentley, that, on his riding over the night before to
Hurst, he also had passed near them, and seen a light
moving about within the chapel. Bentley was not sorry
to find that it was becoming too dark to search for his
watch, and that his wisest plan would be to cross the
valley at once, and make his way into the high road.
He was not superstitious, but he was not a scoffing scep-
tic, and therefore he was not ashamed to feel a certain
awe, and even credulity, in all that related to the mystery
of a world of spirits. To effect his purpose it was neces.
sary to follow the path by the oak, and then strike off
along the Priory wall, passing under the great east
window of the chapel, and so gaining the little rude
bridge which crossed the brook below it. But as he
approached the oak he could not help starting at the
sight of a figure beneath it. It was a female, seemingly
of the lower orders, sitting with her head buried in her
hands, and motionless, as if in deep distress. She no
sooner heard the sound of footsteps than she sprang up,
with a faint cry, and was hastening to meet Bentley,
until, as she came near, she turned back suddenly, as if
she had mistaken the person, and diverged into the
thicket, where he lost sight of her. Bentley stopped to
see if she would appear again, or wanted anything, but
to no purpose ; and he passed on, wondering what could

have brought a poor woman, at so late an hour, to such a
place. But his wonder was not to cease ; as he turned
the corner of the north wail, and was making his way,
with some difficulty, over the fragments of the building
and broken ground, on which the dormitories had stood,
not without fear of falling into some of the choked-up
vaults and arches with which the ground was full, his eye
turned to one of the lancet windows, rich with thick
painted glass, and still perfect, in the little oratory adjoin-
ing the chapel. Was it his fancy, or the reflection of
the moon ? But a faint glimmering, which struggled
through one of the panes, fixed him to the spot. It
grew in a few moments clearer and clearer ; and Bent.
ley could not doubt that there was a light within. He
would have gone at once to see who was there, but he
remembered the rusty chains and padlocks with which he
had seen, a few hours before, that the iron grate was
fastened ; and he was too well aware how many turbu-
lent and evil-disposed persons there were in the neigh-
borhood of Hawkstone to expose himself to any collision
with such visitors in such a spot. He stopped, therefore,
holding his breath, and, it must be confessed, with a
beating heart. But the light remained stationary, and,
seemingly, was the reflection of a lantern, not imme-
diately in the oratory, but in some adjoining passage.
His next impulse was to move gently to the window, and
look in, but it was at too great a height from the ground;
and his prudence then suggested that it would be quite
sufficient to mention the next morning to Mr. Atkinson
what he had seen, and to pursue the inquiry by daylight.
But just as he had reached the east end of the chapel, he
was again startled by a clashing and fall of something
like arms; and a rough voice just above him, seemingly
from the hollow of the wall, uttered a dreadful oath, to
which another voice muttered out a grumbling; ulky
answer. Bentley drew himself close to the wall, and
buried himself in a huge mass of elder and ivy, driving
from it a flight of sparrows which had nestled there for
the night.
In another minute he heard two persons jump
down on the pavement, and the light from the lantern

streamed up. Seme words passed between them, which
Bentley could not understand, about "number nine," and
" fourth lodge;" and then one of them he heard de-
parting, with a promise to return in about half an hour,
while the other proposed to remain. Could Bentley
have seen into the chapel, he would have recognized in
the former the coarse, ruffianly Irish vagrant, whose boy
had been saved on the night of the fire. The other he
might also have recognized, though with difficulty. He
was younger, respectably dressed, with a quick, clever
cye, but with features marked with passion and intempe.

bered in him the sharp, intelligent lail at the National
School, always foremost to answer questions and gain
prizes, who, having left the school thoroughly tutored in
reading and writing, and thoroughly untutored in anything
else, had soon plunged into a reckless career of vice, and
had become one of the most notorious profligates of
Hawkstone---a Socialist. He had covered up his lan-
tern, and was pacing backwards and forwards at the
east end of the chapel, whistling at intervals, while
Bentley, drawn up close to the other side of the wall,
and unable to move without making a noise in the bough
of ivy, was deliberating, with no very comfortable feel.

his mind, the same brutal voice which he had heard
before called out, " Who goes there ? " and at the same
time the lantern was Hashed out upon the building.

ing, when a timid plaintive voice from the bottom of the
building uttered faintly, " It's only I, George."
" Who's I ?" said the brutal ruffian.
" It's Margaret," answered the female.
"And what do you want here with your whining and
pining, and spying out what you ha -a no business to spy"
How came you here ?'

"Conuell told me I should find you here,' said Mar.
garet, with her voice faltering,
" And what do you want to find me for ?"
" I want"said poor Margaret, and she ran up to
him, and put her pale, wan, anxious face into his hands
"0 George! I'm starving : I have no friends, not
one upon earth, and you have left me ; and I am alone,
and perishing, and I want !-- George, George! give
me back my child !"
And she fell down, and clasping his knees looked up
to him longingly and earnestly, with her eyes streaming
with tears, and her long hair cast back from a coun-
tenance where delicacy and beauty were still struggling
with care and sorrow.
"Fool! what brings you here?" was the only reply
which the ruffian vouchsafed as he shook her from him.
"Go back quietly, and here's something to keep you
from starving," and he flung her a piece of money.
But she heeded it not. "No, not money ; I want no
money ; I want yourself, George ; I want you to love
meto love me as you did when you married me!"
"Married you ?" cried the wretch with a hoarse
laugh ; "married
yoli !-what's marriage ?".
" Yes, married me !" said Margaret, with a firmer
and prouder voice. "I am your own lawful wedded
wife. No one has a right to separate us : you cannot
leave me.
Did you not take me to your chapel ? Were
we not married regularly, truly joined together for ever!
Would to God we had gone to the church as my father
and mother did before me ! It could not have been so
then."
Why not ?" asked the man insultingly.
66 What
have your priests to do with marriage? What are their
accursed contrivances, except to fasten persons neck to
neck, like galley-slaves, instead of allowing them their
freedom ? No, my good girl, we are wiser now. Go
back quietly ; find out another husband ; I give you
full leave, and shall never complain. Much better do
this than whine and whimper in this way."
" Never, never !" cried the horror-struck, indignant

Margaret. "O George ! you did not say this when
you knew me first. You swore to me you would never
desert me. You used to kiss me, and love me, and
call me your treasure, and hang over me, O how fondly !
Do you remember when our child was born ?"
" Dolt! Idiot !" exclaimed the irritated man,
" Hold
your tongue, and begone ! "
May God help me! God have mercy upon me!"
faltered the poor woman as she sunk upon her knees.
Ay, ay, that's the right thing," cried -the man with
a horrible sncer ; "go to your priests and your prayers,
they'll comfort you; nothing can be better for you
women."
" Nor for men either," she roused herself to say.
George, George, the time will come when you will die,
and then you will think on me ; and you will know that
there is a God in heayen who avenges the poor! ay, in
another world!"
"Ha! ha!" was the answer, as he burst into a loud
laugh, which made the walls of the chapel ring, and
Bentley's blood run cold.
"Yes," pursued Margaret, "there is a hell, and you
will know it, sooner or later!"
And so this is what you get from your priests!'
said the man,
"What right have they to tell me what
is to become of me? They know nothing better than
I do. Don't they tell each man to judge for himself? and
why am I not as good a judge as they are? Why, they
do not believe what they teach themselves. Here have
been five or six of them here this evening, keeping me
from my work, all of them the best friends in the world,
smothering each other with kindness, and to-morrow they
will get up in their pulpits, and swear each that the
other is a liar. No, woman, it's all a sham from begin-
ning to end,-a lie, to cheat and frighten us, and we
are beginning to know it. We'll have no more priests !"
Margaret shuddered with horror. "Oh, George !
where have you been since you left me, that you have
learned to speak in this way? What horrible company
have you been keeping ?"

" The company I chanced to meet," said the man.
" And I have learned what I have learned, and am what
I am, and could not be otherwise ; so do not be afraid,
Margaret ;" and he seemed softened by her deep com-
passion for him. "Do not be afraid, Margaret ; we
cannot help our opinions, you know. We do not form
them ourselves, and no one has a right to punish or blame
them. Why, even your priests tell you this, and your
precious Whig ministers, all of them together ; do not
they, my good girl ?"
And he attempted to put his hand on her shoulder, but
she shrunk back as from a touch of contamination.
" And so, George," she asked with a deep groan,
' you are become an atheist ?"
"An atheist !" said the man with an effort to laugh.
" An atheist! no, not an atheist. We are religionists,
rational religionists, all of us. We do just what your
priests do, and tell us to do. And we take their Bibles
and read them ourselves, and if we do not like or under-
stand what we read, why we know it is false.

any other. No, Margaret, never call me an atheist !
It's a mere calumny-a bugbear."
" And you are rich, then ? " faltered Margaret,
looking up at him with a famished, poverty-stricken
face.
" Yes, it is better times now with me," said the
wretch, "than when we used to be starving together
without a fire, and scarcely clothes to cover us. And
here's something for yourself. Take this," and he en.

deavored to put two or three sovereigns into her hands,
but she let them fall without notice.
" And what are you doing?" she asked.
Doing ?" said the man ; " doing a great deal that
one of these days you'll hear of. You should have beer
here five hours ago, up in the wall as I was, and heard
that young jackanapes who wants to be member of par-
liament tell us what we ought to do. We are going to
recover our rights, my girl ; and we'll have a little gentle
agitation, a little moral influence, a little quiet pres-
sure. Ah, ah !" he cried, and threw open kis coat, so
that the light fell on a couple of brace of pistols. 46 A
little moral influence! ha, ha! moral influence of
starving mechanics, with guns on their shoulders and
pikes in their pockets! Hark!" He stopped. " Is

stone bells just faintly reached Bentley's ear. "Stop
here, Margaret," he said to the poor woman, who was
trembling with alarm," and you shall see what you
shall see, and know pretty well what I've been doing, -
only," and here he uttered a horrible blasphemous oath,
- if one word of what you have seen this night ever
pass your lips". -and he looked at her, and put
his hand on his pistols, as sure as you are a living
woman!"
"Does no one know you are here ?" said Margaret,
faintly.
"Not a soul, but that Irish brute Connell, who dares
not peach.
"I fancied," said Margaret, was waiting for
you, that I saw another person coming. I fancied it
was the parson."
" The parson !" exclaimed the man. "How I should
like to catch the parson at ten o'clock at night in the
Priory ruins, prying into my secrets !--if I would not
slit his throat from ear to ear with as much coolness as
he would mend his own pen !"
Bentley heard it, and at that moment the cold air
irritated his throat, and he was on the point of coughing:
"Hold the lantern, girl, nd do not '? frightene:1!"

and, giving her the lantern, he lighted a matcli, and went
down to another part of the ruins. And the next minute
the poor girl heard a rushing, wavering, roaring sound,
and a rocket with a prodigious train of fire rose up into
the air, throwing a glare of light on the masses of walls
and the grim, grotesque faces with which the traceries
were studded.
" Did you see that, Margaret ?" said the fellow as
he returned ; " is not that a good blaze ? Do you think
we do not know to manage our fire ? And won't we
make a firework of every house and farm in the country,
unless they do as we choose? What's the use of science,
and lectures, and Mechanics' Institutes, if they cannot
teach us a little useful chemistry ?-Come here, girl,"
and with a hoarse diabolical laugh he pulled her into the
antechapel.
" Now, look out thero to the north, over the pillar,
two minutes more ;" and he began to whistle, and, before
the two minutes had expired, the poor terrified Margaret
saw in the distant sky another rocket shoot up, which
broke and fell in a shower of sparks, but at the distance
of several miles.
"Do you see that ?" said the man ; is not that a
clever mode of talking secrets with one's fingers at six
miles' distance ? Now then, look there, through the
window, out by the hills, where the quarries are. There
it goes ?" he cried.
And another rocket shot up in that direction.
66 Once more

he dragged her reluctantly to the outside of the chapel,
round to the east side, and within a few feet of the
tushes in which Bentley was hidden. " Look out for the
forest, there ought to be two there to-night. Ay, I
thought they were awake ;--fine fellows those pitmen !
capital coals they work, and capital hammers they have."
And as two rockets rose up side by side, over the dark
outline of the mountainous district which formed the
mining part of Hawkstone Forest, the man seized Mar
garet by the arm, and almost crushed it with his violence.
"And now you see what I have been doing; and if you

threw
open
his coat. "If I have a tongue that can talk
in this way, I have eyes that can see through stone
walls, and ears in every house in the parish ; and sooner
than we'd be baulked of our rights, there's not a man of
us who would hesitate to put you quietly out of the way
in the twinkling of an eye.".
" You would not murder me?" cried the almost
fiinting Margaret ; " you would not bear to have nie
imurdered ?"
" Murder you ?" said the villain. "What do you use
your cant words for ? Murder means to do something
wrong, and the bloody Whigs would hang one up for it.
No, I would not murder you ; but I tell you what I would
do, I would very quietly, and impelled by necessity''-

ness have we with anything else, as your parsons and
your philosophers--ha! ha!-have been telling you for
ages ?),why, Margaret (and he lowered his voice to a
deep hoarse pitch, and put a pistol to her ear), " I would
blow out your brains this instant."
"Spare me, spare me!" cried Margaret, sinking
down on the ground.
"Spare you ?" said the man ; " to be sure I will :
you have not peached yet, and do not intend to peach ;
and now get you gone, for I have some more work to do,
and cannot stand here chattering; What are you stop-
ping for ?" he cried, with an oath, as the poor woman,
who had risen up almost stupified, lingered and seemed
summoning up courage to approach him again. " What
do you want more?"
And once more she ran to him, fell at his feet, and
clasped his knees. "O George, George! forgive me!
spare me! don't kill me, don't be angry-only tell
me, and I will go away quietly, quite quietly. You pro-
mised you would-O George, George! where is my baby?"

HAWKSTONE,
The wretch uttered a horrible imprecation, and
almost stamped upon her. " What have you to do with
your baby, you fool? What have any of us to do with
babies, when we are starving and dying piecemeal! -
men enough in the world already, without having more
to breed a famine!" (Margaret's blood ran cold.) "Away
with
you !"
"No!" she cried, gaining courage with despair ; "I
will not away, I will not leave you! you promised I
should know where it was. My own child, my beautiful
baby! you took it
away,
and
you shall give it me again!
Would to God that I had died before I slept that night!
We were starving, we were dying ; but so long as that
baby was on my breast I could bear anything. And
now"and a flood of tears followed at the thought of
her own misery and desolation. " Tell me," she con-
tinued, "tell me only one thing is it safe ? is it well?
does it seem to know you? are they taking care of it ?
You promised they would take care of it. You swore to
me it should want for nothing ; that it should be quite
happy,"
" Ay! ay !" said the man, with something like a
groan, "quite happy! It wants for nothing, woman, take
my word for it, and never will."
"My God, my God !" cried the miserable woman, as
she caught the gloomy expression of his eye, and a bitter
smile about his lip, "it is notno, George, you would
not deceive me! you would not kill me! you do not
mean"--and she stopped, choked with her dreadful
anticipation.
" Go along, Margaret. Go along, and ask no ques.
tions. What's the use of asking questions? It's all right."
** All right-and my baby is well? Thank God! God
Almighty be praised ! o bless you, bless you! dear,
dearest George !-quite well-you are sure, quite well !"
And her voice faltered as she caught again the gloomy
expression of his eye, though she thought it seemed
moistened for the moment.
"Ay, go away-go away all's right-all's right,"
said the man.

No! no!" said Margaret, for she knew his notions
of right, and that everything expedient was right, and
she trembled at his repetition of the phrase; for, hardened
as he was, he rather wished to avoid a lie.

" Norsense !" said the man; " why then, quite well."
But the words choked him, and he tried to slur them
over.
" And I may see it?" exclaimed Margaret. " I may
see it? When may I go ? I am barefootlook, George,

"Yes, to-night, fool !" cried the wretch, exasperatec
and infuriated with her perseverance.
" And at once ? exclaimed Margaret ; 66 and with
you?"
" Yes, woman !" he cried, as he became furious ;
"at once, and with me !" and he seized her by the arm
with a horrible execration, and dashed her on the ground
a few yards off, close by the buttress of the chapel.
"There, there !"
And Margaret saw fresh mould and turf, which had
been disturbed, and the horrible truth flashed upon her.
She raised herself up on her knees, and gazed on him
like a furious tigress ; and before he could recover him.

murdered my child! Help! help !" and her cries rang
through the walls of the ruin, and startled the screech-
owls in the wood. " Murder ! murder ! help help!
take him ! seize him ! he has murdered my child ! "
"Silence, woman, silence !" muttered the man, as
he vainly endeavored to release his neck from her iron
grasp.
" Silence !"
But Margaret's shrieks and cries for help did not
cease ; and, without speaking, he contrived to disengage
one hand and seize his pistol. But the next moment he

was pulled upon his knees, and the pistol went off.
There was a man wrestling with him in the bushes,
wrestling desperately and franticly ; and as they rolled
together on the ground, the villain saw that it was a.
young figure, of little strength, and unarmed. It was
Bentley. "A priest, by all that's holy!' le muttered ;
and throwing away the pistol, the only one which had
been loaded, he coolly prepared himself for the struggle,
with the certainty that he must be the master. " Not
very wise to be here at this time of night," said the
wretch as he succeeded in turning Bentley under him,
and getting his knee upon his chest. "Not very wise
to be prying into other people's secrets at this time of
night!" and Bentley, sickening with the pressure, began
to relax his hold of the ruffian's neck. With one hand
pinning him down, with the other the man began to fum-
ble in his coat, and a dreadful oath showed that he had a
difficulty in finding what he sought. Bentley took the
opportunity of springing up once more and making a
last desperate effort ; but his strength was nearly ex-
hausted. " Down! down !" cried the villain ;
still !" and he dashed him to the ground, and, as Bent.
ley's eyes turned up, he saw something in the murderer's
hand which glittered in the moonlight ; his eyes closed,
and, having just time to utter a prayer, in the next minute
he was senseless.

It is now time to return to the spot on the side of the
hill, where, in the afternoon, the stranger had stopped
and looked back to catch the music of the Temperance
Society, as it issued from the outskirts of the wood.
As he saw the banners and the people, a dark shade
came over his countenance, and with a gesture of impa.

tience he turned away to pursue his solitary walk.
One only expression escaped him as he stood a little
farther on, with arms folded, as if in deep and painful
thought ; but our readers may like to hear it, for it was
uttered from the bottom of his heart. 6 0 Rome!
Rome! thou curse of the earth! what crimes thou hast
to answer for !" and he then passed on.
But, buried in thought, he scarcely heeded even
the magnificent scenery through which his path took
him. He followed it once more to the top of the park,
and then struck off down a steep declivity, the sides of
which were furrowed into three deep ravines formed by
the descending waters. The little streams themselves
fell over masses of rock, here spreading into dark pools,
and there eating unseen into the overhanging banks :
and above them the sides rose steeply, covered with old
oak trunks, and thorns, and fern, from which the deer
were startled, and bounded off as the stranger ap.
proached. At one point the eye could pass down over
all this depth of wood, and range over a plain beyond it,
then lighted up with the bright evening shadows.
To the west lay the forest of Hawkstone, stretching in a
long black ridge, and terminated at one extremity by
three conical mountain heights, folding one behind the
other, between which the sun was preparing to sink,
and was then melting down their bard clear outline into
a flood of the palest gold. Still nearer lay Claremont
Castle, with its ruined keep and broken tower, hanging
over the Hawkstone Brook, which there widened into a
stream, and wound snakelike through the meadows.
Lord Claremont's modern house was not visible ; it
was hidden by a projecting grove of oaks ; and at one
time the stranger, who had before scrupulously avoided
looking in that direction, seemed to make up his mind to
face the sight, and tried to discover it ; but in vain.
At the bottom of the ravine, just where it opened and the
stream made its way into the lower park, he rested against
a gate near an ivy-covered old brick building, used by
the keepers in killing the deer, and gazed on two gigan.

up their mass of dark green foliage from the bottom,
nearly to a level with the top of the bank. Beneath
them, but planted so as to form a group, was a fine stone
pine carefully enclosed ; and the ground round its roots
seemed to have been recently stirred, as if by some hand
anxious for its growth ; and as the stranger looked upon
the pine, his thoughts wandered off to a still brighter
clime, and to hours when he sat amongst the gardens of
Florence with another person at his side (and he gave an
audible groan at the recollection), gazing on the tall wild
outline of the same trees as they jagged the blue horizon
of an Italian sky.
" Lady Esther's tree's, sir," said a respectable old
peasant, coming up and taking off his hat to the stranger,
and exhibiting one of those fine, placid, sensible old
faces for which the peasantry of England were once
famed, and which even now may occasionally be seen on
the Sunday in the open pews of a village church, look.
ing up attentively to the preacher, and catching and
applying every word. "My barometers," as Charles
Bevan used to call them, when I wish to know if my ser.
mon is understood.--"Poor Lady Esther's trees.'
The stranger turned, took off his hat also, and
looked mournfully on the intruder, who also seemed
struck with something, without exactly knowing what.
"Sir Robert Haswell, the great painter," continued
the peasant, "used to say those were the finest trees in
the county ; and he never came to the Priory, but my
lady and he used to come up here ; and I have seen then
stand half an hour together close by this gate looking as
them."
The stranger only answered, " Yes, my good man,
they are very fine trees. And what," he asked with a
faint smile, " is that young tree?"
"That, sir," said the old man, " that's Master Er
nest's pine-planted when he was born : and please God
he may come to see how it is grown. Not a day passes
but I look after it. But oh, sir, it is a sad thing for the
owner of this fine place to be in foreign parts, and all this
going to ruin ; and the peoplu caring nothing for any-

they pay their rents. It is not good, sir, nor right ;
and things cannot be well when we are all left in this
way to ourselves, without our betters to take care of us.
Certainly not," said the stranger, "but we will hope
your master may come to live among you."
"Oh, sir, I hope he may; but there is bad news at
the house, they say. People talk of his having turned
papist, and being in debt, and selling all his property, so
soon after he has got it again. But then, it is not m,
business to talk of master's affairs.
And I beg you
pardon, sir."
" How long has he heen absent ?" asked the
stranger.
"Ever since Lady Esther's death, sir. I have noi
set eyes on him these twenty years. The old Genera)
took him away before, but he came back then for a
few days, and ever since that he has been with him in
foreign parts, except when he was at college. And

"Oh, sir, if he would only come back, and settle
among us, and take an interest in us, and teach us what
o do! Now, sir, things are all at sixes and sevens,
and the bad people at Hawkstone are riding over the
Conntry; and the miners out there," and he pointed to the
forest," are getting arms, and having torchlight meetings.
And the farmers won't pay their tithes, and the church
is tumbling down because the parish won't make a rate,
and the poor care nothing for anybody, for their wages
are ground down almost to nothing, and nobody comes
to see them. And if they want justice, they must go to
Mr. Smith, the cotton man, whom they have made a
magistrate of, because he votes for the radicals, instead
of having it from their own landlord. In short, sir, I
wish it were the old times again, when landlords, and
tenants, and laborers, all hung together ; and we had

none of those ugly factories corrupting the men and
women, and no fine talk about reform, which for my
part I believe is all nonsense. If people want reforming,
they had better reform themselves, and that is the only
way of reforming."
"I think so too," said the stranger.
" This is the
way to the house, is it not ? Good afternoon." And
the old man pointed out the path, looked after him with a
sort of wonder, and could not help muttering to himself,
" How very
like !" A short turn of the path soon
brought the stranger in view of the house. It was one
of those "old and reverent piles," which no one has so
well described as Wordsworth, with deep bay windows,
and wrought gables, porches, and mullioned arches, high
twisted chimneys, and pinnacles wreathed with ivy, and
all the rich quaint carving of the Elizabethan age.
At one corner stood a fragment of an older building, in
the shape of a square massive tower, called St. Bevor's
tower, which rose up from the terrace, and recalled by
its dark, solid masonry, the days when the lords of
Hawkstone had been knights in armor, and Sir Bevor
himself, whose figure lay cross-legged in the cathedral
of , had led a body of its yeomen to the Holy Wars.
Although an incongruity in architecture, the tower
formed a feature of no little interest. Not so with a
line of building of modern Italian taste, raised on the
site of the wing, which had been burned down on Sir
Roger's death. It connected itself with the stable.
yard, and was intended for offices. But there was a dis-
proportion and gaudiness about it which shocked the
eye ; and the stranger evidently regarded it with consi.
derable disgust. And yet, on the whole, few English
mansions were more striking than Hawkstone. Its
green terraces sloped up the hill behind, and were
connected with the house by balustrades and vases. In
front, beneath a rough overhanging bank, lay a small
sheet of water, reflecting in that calm sunny afternoon
every line of the building, its oriels glittering with the
sinking sun, and the rich foliage which bent over it
from the back. And at the corner of the tower lay a

sinall square platform studded with parterres and vases
in the old French taste, and commanded by a range of
windows in the south front, to one of which, a richly
wrought Gothic oriel with a small lancet adjoining, the
stranger looked up, and gazed at it evidently with con.
siderable emotion.
As he approached the house, he did not observe that
there were marks of carriage-wheels on the broad gravel
before the door, and that the great gates which opened
into the stable-yard were open. The old housekeeper,
who had been in the house ever since Lady Esther's
time, and indeed had been her favorite maid, was very
ill. And a young grand-daughter, to whom the stranger
gave a note from Mr. Atkinson, the steward, led him
timidly through the great hall hung round with pieces of
armor and stags' heads, and through the ante-room
and dining-room, with its oriel window and huge cuni.

modern taste had enlivened with gilded cornices and
fretwork, now faded and dull. And there were pictures

gales ; and venerable old gentlemen in wigs and bro.
caded coats ; and a few good busts ; and in the library,
a long oak-wainscoted apartment, opening into various
recesses, and dark with painted glass, there was a large
collection of books, on which the stranger looked with
evident satisfaction. The little girl could not, indeed,
understand his movements. He seemed to open the
doors as if he knew the house thoroughly. Before one
or two pictures he stopped with earnest interest. The
others he passed by carelessly ; and she endeavored in
vain to repeat some of the lore connected with them,
which she had learned from her grandmother.
66 Would he like to see the curiosities ? the fine
embroidered velvet pall, which had been brought from
the Priory when it was pulled down, and which Sir
Ilildebrand, the sallow, dissipated-looking man, whose
portrait, in the costume of Charles Il.'s time, hung on
the north side of the dining-room, had turned into a
coverlet for his bed!" The stranger declined.

" Should she show him the great gilt cup, which was
also brought from the same place, and which Sir Roger
had in his hand, and was drinking out of it, at the very
time when he was taken with the convulsions of which
he died ?" The stranger shook his head ; he would go
up stairs into the gallery, and look at the pictures there,
and his little guide need not follow him. He would
prefer looking at them by himself. And, half-doubting,
notwithstanding Mr. Atkinson's guarantee, if she might
trust him there without her, and looking back wistfully,
as he ascended the grand staircase, she took her bunch
of keys, and proceeded to reclose the doors of the rooms
through which they had passed. At the top of the
staircase a pair of folding doors, with pillars and richly
carved capitals, opened into the long gallery, ceiled with
stucco-work, and lined with portraits, and furnished with
old cabinets and curious encoignures, and high-backed
ebony chairs and marble tables, all of which the stranger
passed unnoticed. His eye was fixed on a door at the
end of it which he seemed rather surprised to find ajar.
He opened it gently, very gently, almost as if he was
afraid of disturbing some one within. It was a large
lofty room, hung with tapestry, containing a heavy-
carved bed, heavy-carved wardrobes and cabinets, old
worked chairs, and a toilet laid out with a rich silver ap.
paratus for a lady's use ; and over the fire-place was a
full-length portrait of a lady also. It was the bedroom
of Lady Esther. And as she looked down from the pic-
ture on the cold melancholy apartment, herself all radiant
with youth, and beauty, and the brilliancy of her bridal
attire, the contrast seemed too painful to the stranger.
He turned to a smaller portrait, only half finished, in
which the same high noble countenance, but marked
with lines of care and sorrow, was bending over a young
child, and watching him with tears in her eyes, as he
lay sleeping, not on her bosom, but in the arms of a
nurse ; and the tears came into the eyes of the stranger
likewise-tears which fell faster as he stood by the side
of the bed. For the last time he had been in that room
it was darkened, and hung round with funeral lights;

and he had been brought there, awe-struck and won-
dering, to cast a last look on a gorgeous coffin ; and
the time before that the room was also darkened, but,
instead of the trappings of sorrow, there only lay upon
that bed, covered decently with white, a pale, cold, un-
moving figure, resting as it were from a great agony,
and every line of sorrow softened into peace ; and the
stranger well remembered his being lifted up upon the
bed, and giving a kisshow chill and awful !-to that
marble forehead. And the day before that, he had been
also brought into the same room by the old housekeeper,
now lying ill : and how well he recollected that hour!
Years had passed away, but as he now stood by the bed.
side, the whole scene came back upon him with a vivid
distinctness which almost appalled him.There was the
pale faint form of Lady Esther, supported by pillows,
turning round longingly to the door where he was ex-
pected to enter, and waving to have the curtains undrawn
that the light might fall once more upon the face of her
beautiful boy ; and he had been wrapt in her embrace
for minutes without either of them uttering a word, and he
himself hearing nothing but the beating of her heart,
and feeling a stream of tears falling on his face. And
then she moved him from her, and turned him to the
light, gazing on him with a look of sorrow and affection
which he had never forgotten. And once more he was
buried in her arms, and he heard prayer on prayer,
faintly, yet all distinctly, poured over his head with the
energy of a dying saint. She had made a sign also to
her maid, to bring her something from a casket on the
dressing-table ; and whispering to him softly, " They will
not prohibit this, they will not take this from you," she
put round his neck with her own thin transparent hands
a chain of her own hair, from which hung a plain little
cross of gold ; and the cross she put gently into his own
hands, pressed them together, and looked up to heaven,
and once more kissing his forehead with a long fervent
kiss of blessing, she motioned to the servant that she
could bear to part with him, and as she sunk back u mon
the pillow, hi: was taken out of the room.

HAWKSTONE.
Nor were these all the recollections of that chamber.
No! almost ashamed of himself for their intrusion, he
thought of days still earlier, and of very different occu-
pations, when, as a child, he used to play by his mother's
side in that same rooin, and make her show him the
treasures of those silver boxes ; and tell him stories ;
when he would sit at her feet (there was the stool before
him, just as it used to be, at the foot of the great ebony
chair), playing with his puzzle, or learning his lesson, or
looking over picture books; not alone, but with a companion
of his own age, or, as he always used to call her, his little
wife, his cousin Eleanor. He dared not trust himself
longer, but moved, with his arms crossed, to another
door, which opened, seemingly, into a little sitting-room
belonging to the suite. The curtains were closed, and it
was nearly dark, but a door beyond was open, and a
stream of rich light from the narrow lancet window fell
beyond it into a small Gothic oratory, which had been
fitted
up for the use of Lady Esther. There was the
richly wrought niche over the altar, containing a crucifix
of the purest ivory; the canopied fan-like roof, the silver
lamp, the illuminated Missal, the small gold candelabra,
the footstool where Lady Esther used to kneel, all exactly
as he remembered it when, as a child, he had been
allowed occasionally to look into this sacred recess,
where, several times a day, Lady Esther used to retire
in the midst of even her most busy avocations, and where,
since General Villiers had gone away to the continent
and taken her son with him, she spent the greater part of
her time in prayer.
But the stranger saw none of these. For before the
altar, her back towards him, and her head upturned as in
a posture of the deepest devotion, there was a female
figure kneeling, who did not hear his approach, and yet
whose thoughts at that moment were full of him, were
praying for him. It was Lady Eleanor. He could not
doubt it. It was her tall graceful form ; the exquisite
ishape of her head, the slender neck. Even the dress he
recognized; the same which she had worn when they
parted, three moi ths before, at Florence. What a meet.

ing! He stood for a minute fixed to the spot, not aston-
ished to see her, for he knew she was in the country,
but amazed that their first meeting should be in such a
place, so consecrated to the recollection of them both.
Gathering all his resolution to bear the meeting as he
ought, he recollected himself sufficiently to endeavor to
withdraw from intruding cr disturbing her at such a mo-
ment. But the noise he made in moving roused her atten-
tion. As she turned round, she caught his figure
retreating through the outer door, and, before she knew
what she was doing, his name had escaped from her lips.
In a moment he was at her side, on his knees before her,
covering her hands with kisses ; and she, slightly endea-
voring to withdraw them, was looking as if a load had
been taken from her heart, and a long. hoped-for, long-
delayed joy, a joy too great for utterance, had suddenly
arrived. But it lasted only for a minute. His eye caught
the crucifix orer the altar, and he shuddered ; and dropping
her hands and rising up before her, with an altered tone,
which made the blood forsake her cheek, and leave on
it a fixed look of disappointment and despair, he faltered
out, " Forgive me ! forgive me, Lady Eleanor !-I have
no right-I am not master of myself. I am much to
blame--I was not prepared to meet you. Forgive me
for the intrusion. I did not know you were here.'
" They told me," said she, faintly, that you were in
Yorkshire. I came here to see poor Collins, who is very
ill, and wished to see me before she became worse."
" You have been," he said, "at Claremont, then,
some days?"
father came down on Saturday."
And there was a dead pause.
" And you will stay here, then, for the autumn ??'
"Yes," she replied ; "perhaps all the winter."
They were silent again ; but Ernest was recovering
himself.
" We shall meet, then ; we must meet often," he
said, with a firm but painful effort. And a slight gleam
of hope came across her mind. " We shall see each
other very often, as in old times
" Yes, my

" Yos," was her faint answer, and all hope had
vanished, " as in old times."
" As friends ?"
" Yes, as friends."
" Not as common friends ?" said Ernest.
No," she replied, for she also was gaining strength,
as very dear friends."
" As brother and sister ?"
" Yes," was her answer, and her eyes filled with
tears ; as brother and sister."
And once more he took her hand, and pressed it
reverentially to his lips. But the effort was too much for
her, and she sunk down in a seat, and cried violently.
He stood hy her in silence, waiting for her feelings
to find vent, and his own tears falling fast with hers. By
degrees her emotion subsided, and she looked up, and
stretched out her hand to him, which he took in both
his own.
" This is sad weakness, Ernest, sad weak-
ness," she said ; " but you will not think I wish it other-
wise. Act according to your duty, as I would act by
mine. Do not think me wicked enough to wish that
you
should tamper with your conscience. I mean"-she
corrected herself (for she knew how the word conscience
is abused)" with your faith, with your religion. Better
for us both to be miserable, separate, than to be joined
without God's blessing."
"Not miserable, dear Eleanor, not wholly miser-
able," said Ernest ; 66 you will have your comfort, and
God will give me mine. We cannot be miserable, you
know" (and he vainly attempted to smile), " when we
are doing His will."
May God forgive me the words !" she said, and she
lifted up her hands.  No, Ernest, we will not be
miserable. We can love each other, even now, as
brother and sister."
" And we can pray for each other," said Ernest.

And he gave her his arm, and, by a winding staircase
at the corner of the tower, they made their way out on
the terrace.
It was a still delicious hour. The birds were carolling
in the trees, the waters glittering in the sunshine, the
swans on the lake oaring their way in little fleets, the
deer lying under the oaks with no footstep to disturb them.
One solitary fleecy vapor was sailing gently across the
setting sun. The flowers looked up, as they passed, a:
if delighted to waft their fragrance to them. The very
air breathed like balm upon their heated foreheads, ani
Ernest, much as he loved at all times to dwell with na
ture, felt that he never before had known the power of its
soft gentle music in ulling a troubled heart, where the
heart was right with God. The turret clock struck foui
as they came out upon the terrace. It was five before
they left it. Now that all hope was over, Eleanor, quiet
ed and resigned, could almost talk to him as she used ti
talk; could begin to feel to him as she used to feel before
she had ever thought of him except as a playmate and :
brother. He asked for the good Abb St. Maur, who
was still at Claremont with the Earl. He spoke of foreign
scenes, where they had travelled together. He even
ventured to tell her much of what had passed since they
parted at Florence, while still there was a lingering
thought that he might yet be tempted to join the Romish
communion, and thus claim Eleanor's hand on the only
terms on which Eleanor, with all her love for him, would
listen to his affection. And then he entered on his plans;
told her why he had remained in Hawkstone privately,
partly in his dread of meeting her until all his arrange.
ments were settled, but chiefly that he might compare
by himself the real circumstances of his two estates, and
decide which he should part with, that he might reside
entirely on the other.
" You know," he told her, and Eleanor looked up to
him with a pride which she no longer attempted to dis-
guise, "that I hold the possession of land a most solemn
and responsible trust. A lardlord is the king of the soil,
and as a king, he cannot ha re a divided empire without

doing injustice to one portion of it or the other. I have,
therefore, resolved to sell my estates in Yorkshire. They
are quiet, comparatively happy, compared with these ;
here every thing is turbulent, and full of evil, I fear of
serious danger. And I have chosen to station myself
here, and by God's help, I hope to try what can be done
in one little spot, at lvast, to save us from the iniquities,
and follies, and approaching curses, of this unhappy land

heart, but he was resolved that, cost what it may, his de-
cision should be definitely known), "done as a Protes-
tant may do itas a devoted son of the English branch of
the Holy Catholic Apostolical Church may hope to do, and
may pray for God's blessings on his labors."

was over.
CHAPTER XII.
The carriage rolled away ; turned down the sycamore
avenue out of sight; and then it was, that Ernest felt the

was gone : the delight of seeing her, of walking by her,

the consciousness that he was sacrificing himself to
what he believed his duty-all seemed to vanish with
her, and a cold dreary blank fell upon his heart. The
very sun itself, and the bright landscape which had
sooihed him so .before, now became melancholy and
inanimate. The whole of life seemed stretched before
him as a long, dreary, tedious waste. And more than
once his resolutions failed ; more than once
teinpter whispered to him, that forms of faith were not

essential to religion ; that charity was the essence of
piety; that opinions are not controllable, and, therefore,
are not to be censured ; that marriage is a civil cere-
mony, convenient and conducive to the tranquillity and
morality of states, but that no solemn spiritual union is
implied in it, which should prevent it from joining as one
body those of different communions in spirit, or rather, a
living member of the Church and one who was cut off
from its fountain of life by heathenism, or heresy, or
schism. Happily he had been well taught, and he repelled
the suggestions manfully.
And now we must ask forgiveness for a long, a very
long parenthesis, to interpret much that has passed, and
all that is to come.
Some outline of Ernest's history the reader must have
gathered already. He was the only child of Lady
Esther : as such, and as heir to the large Villiers' pro-
perty, he was reared up from his infancy in habits of
command, which, but for the watchful care and discipline
of his mother, would have moulded him into a little
tyrant. He had within him the proud haughty spirit of
all the Villierses. Around him he saw nothing but ob-
sequiousness to his wishes, and a stiff, ceremonious mode
of life, not relaxed, but rather increased by the strict
adherence of Lady Esther to the principles of the Roman
Catholic Church. So long as he continued as a child under
her care, his imperious disposition was kept down by her
rigid but affectionate superintendence. But when the
General, soured in temper by pecuniary embarrassments,
and incapable of sympathising with her devotional ha-
bits, insisted on executing the miserable condition pro
posed at their ill-assorted union, of bringing up the boys
in the religion of the father, and the girls under the
wing of the mother, Ernest was taken from her and
placed first under a well-intentioned but injudicious tutor,
who endeavored to eradicate any seeds of Popery which
might have been implanted by his mother's influence, and
to form him to habits of religion by violent appeals
to his feelings, and by continual theological controversy,
which his mind was not capable of bearing : for f:w

persons seem to understand, in the education of children,
that the religious frame of mind, not the religious
knowledge, is the effect to be sought forthat a child's
religion consists not in quoting texts of scripture, or in
making long prayers, but in reverencing, loving, and
obeying the parents and teachers whom God has placed
over them ; in worshipping God through them and in
them; and seeing Him dimly and faintly beyond them
as a mystery, and only as a mystery, which gradually
clears up into open day, as obedience to His earthly
representatives prepares the heart and soul for obeying
Himself. Young as Ernest was, his feelings were
chilled rather than warmed by these efforts to excite
them. And with a sagacity common to children, he
soon detected the latent weakness, and even insincerity,
which must exist, wherever there is an habitual forced
effort to excite religious feeling by outward professions
of it. He was, in fact, even as a child, disgusted with reli.
gion ; and, if at any times he thought of it with pleasure,
it was in the recollection of his mother of the little
simple hymns which he had learned at her knee, of her
own unaffected devotions, of the prayers rather than the
preaching which formed her religious exercises, both by
herself and with hiin, and especially of that tone of un-
hesitating, unsuspecting authority with which she always
spoke, and which, he knew not how, seemed wanting in
his tutor's admonitions.
From his tutor's he was sent to Eton.
And at
Eton, as he rose to the top of the school, his talents
developed themselves gradually, and with them the
imperiousness of his temper, which made him stand aloof
from the rest of his companions, and confine himself to
the society of one friend who was of a similar disposition
to himself; and which soon brought him the reputation of
a haughty and overbearing boy. And yet Ernest was
not overbearing in the common sense of the word. To
weaker boys he was kind and gentle ; to the generality,
careless; to his superiors, really haughty. His compan.
ions disliked him, and the masters could not understand
him. And there was only one occasion, a rebellion,
## p. 157 (#169) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
157
on which he came forward prominently, and by a bold.
independent act, which set all the school at defiance,
prevented considerable mischief. But for the most part
he lived alone ; his walks were solitary, his reading
generally at night, when others were gone to bed. He
seldom joined in games; and when he did, it seemed to
be as if in scorn of himself, though no one excelled him
in any sport which he chose to undertake.
From Eton he came to Oxford. And still the same
reserved and exclusive mood made him regarded with
fear by inferior men, and with dislike by nearly all.
The one or two friends, indeed, who were admitted to
his rooms, spoke of him with enthusiasm. But when
thrown into general society there was a sarcastic expres-
sion about his lips, a thoughtful irony in his language,
and a gloominess on his brow, which repelled every
approach. Gloominess, we said, for Ernest was far from
happy. He had nothing to fill his mind. Ordinary
follies and dissipations he had none, for he had too much
pride. Against worse excesses he was saved by the
daily and almost hourly recollection of his mother, whose
picture hung over his fire-place, and who seemed, to his
fancy, to embody the perfection of pure, delicate, dignified,
and commanding woman.
He made no effort to obtain
any distinction ; left competitors whom he might easily
have vanquished to carry off prizes without rivalship,
chalked out a line of reading for himself
, and attended to
his lectures only sufficiently to avoid censure. He
always took his place in the class-room on one seat,
rather out of sight, which no one else ventured to ap-
propriate ; and when a tutor spoke to him, he answered
with a reserve which, without the slightest disrespect,
discouraged all attempts to gain his confidence. And
in the mean time his imagination was running wild in an
endeavor to find some realization for dreams of ambition,
and knowledge, and goodness, without which life seemed
to him a waste. Around him all was mean and petty,
-meaner and pettier the more it was compared with the
marks of giants' hands and giants' intellects stamped
upon those remains of past generations, beneath the shade

of which he was living. He saw statesmen succeeding
to the helm of the greatest empire formed by man, and
yet bowing to each gust of popular clamor, dreading to
assert a truth or hazard a principle ; hiding in false
shame or falser fear the grandeur of their own destina-
tion, and breaking and frittering up a glorious system
in vain attempts to purchase (from a mob) secu.
rity for the superstructure by surrendering instal.
ments of the foundation. Still nearer he beheld in his
own university, a congeries of grand incorporations
armed with wealth, talent, influence and dignity, capable
of commanding the education of the country, of beating,
as it were, almost as the heart and pulse of the British
empire, and of spreading its arms to grasp on every side
the command of all its moral movements : and yet no
grand scheme of improvement-no organized resistance
to the mischiefs which were gathering on the country-
scarcely a recognition or sense of the awful responsibil-
ities laid by Providence on the rulers of such a body,
seemed to break the dullness and repose in which the
constituted authorities of Oxford clung to the narrow
lines of existing associations and habits. "What,"
thought Villiers to himself, "what would Oxford have
been made at such a crisis in the hands of Popery!"
Nor, when he turned to his bookshelves, filled as they
were at each return of the season with the newest publi.
cations, and searched through on each fresh arrival to
discover some satisfaction to his longing after energy
and power, did he find what he required. Novels, reviews,
magazines, trumpery histories, autobiographies, Scotch
metaphysics, and, still worse, Scotch economics, met
bim till he turned from them with loathing. Once
he caught with delight at one of Carlyle's publications;
and plunged into a course of German studies, till here,
also, he discovered the same hollowness, and vanity, and
coldness, though masked under a more pretending mys-
ticism. And his final refuge lay in the old and great
writers of Greece, whose empire over the human mind
he seemed to share, as he was enabled to stand by their
side, and to appreciate the justness of their conquests

From Philosophy (the step was necessary) he carne upon
Theology: And the controversy of the day, which
brought before him as the one prominent object the
Image of the Church, seized at once upon his mind,
and opened to his fancy all that he had so long been
dreaming of. Here, then, was the power for which his
heart was yearning, and for which all Nature seemed to
cry aloud, -a power divine, though upon earth, bearing
in its hands the keys of Truth, opening and closing at
will the fountain springs of good and evil, swaying the
hearts of men, and overruling the oscillations of their
reason, and capable of binding into one the straggling
elements of society, till all affections should be absorbed
in one object, and every movement subdued to one law.
It was a grand conception for a grand mind ; and from
the moment that Villiers realized it, he became an
altered being. A load seemed to have been taken
from his breast ; the world wore a brighter aspect; life
had an object, and reasoning a foundation in truth. He
could now venture to do what before he had often feared
to doto think and to inquire into the destinies of man
and the Providence of God. And it was in this frame of
mind, before he had time or opportunity to study the
realization of his idea in the history of the Church, and
to penetrate deeply into the differences of the various
communities of Christians, that he was summoned to
join his father at Rome.
CHAPTER XIII.
It was a warm and brilliant evening, about a month
after his arrival there, that he stood on the steps which
lead up to the Palace of the Senators; but not alone.
With him, but a little retired behind him, and watching
him with deep earnestness, stood a pale, calm, silent
figure, in the gart of a Romar -celsiastic. His thin

ment of Villiers ; his hands were not merely crossed on
his breast, but clasped and folded, it seemed in prayer ,
and over all his face, on which high intellectual power
and purity was stamped, there was spread a chastened
yet ardent humility, strongly contrasted with the bold and
commanding contemplativeness of his companion's eye.
One seemed bowed down by a weight above him, be.
neath which he nevertheless moved with power and
willingness, not without enjoyment ; the other stood
as lord and monarch of all around him, free and bold to
move in any direction, to search into any mysteries, to
mould everything according to his will.
"And this, then," said Villiers, after a long silence,
"this is the Capitolthe Capitol of Romulus and Numa,
of Scipio and Marius, of Cicero and Augustus. And
here, then, was the throne of the world !"
And as he turned to look upon the paltry modern
edifices by which it is disfigured, a slight tinge of sar.
casm fell from his look upon his companion.
" And there," said his companion, stretching out
his arm toward the dome of St. Peter's, " there is the
Capitolthe Capitol of Rome and of all Christians !"
" And where," asked Villiers, " are its triumphs ?"
" Not," said his companion, and his eyes turned up to
Heaven,  not where our heathen triumphs have now
passed for ever. Those which are gone are passed into
heaven, and those which are upon earth are before you.
Look," he said, and pointed to a long procession of pil-
grims (it was a year of jubilee) which was winding its
way between the colonnades of St. Peter's.
s Villiers turned to look at his companion, his eye
met from him a steady, piercing, but sad and anxious
gaze ; and even his own proud spirit quailed before him.
Neither of them spoke for some minutes ; and the si.
lence seemed scarcely broken by the deep and almost
internal thrilling, low voice with which the ecclesiastic
asked him when he intended to leave Rome. Villiers
felt that a fascination was upon him-how, or froin

whence, he scarcely knewand he tried to break it
by answering coldly, " In a week." But the effort was
vain.
" And you will go from hence," said his companion,
still in the same charmed voice, "to Athens ?"
" Yes," said Villiers ; and he affected to answer as if
he did not feel the spell. "I must tread the ground where
Plato taught; where Socrates died; where schylus
dreamed; and where the people that have subdued the
minds of ages are now lying in the dust. Athens has
been before me, as the first place of my pilgrimage, ever
since I read the Phdo."
" You have visited, then," continued the ecclesiastic,
"the tombs of the Holy Apostles. You have studied all
the wonders of that art, and the history of that wisdom,
with which this place has enlightened the earth. Have
you descended into the Catacombs ?"
Villiers felt all that was meant, and simply answered
" Yes."
" And from Athens," continued his companion in
che same low unearthly voice, " you will go to Delphi,
che oracle of the heathen world, to Egypt, to the Py:
ramids."
" I hope to do so," answered Villiers.
" To stand," continued his companion, on the sum-
mit of mighty structures, on which the storms of ages
have beaten, and beaten in vain; and to bring before your
eye at one glance the mystery of time absorbed in eter-
nity-of change coeval with immortality ?"
" Such have been my thoughts," said Villiers.
" And such are mine," replied his companion. " But
I need not quit this spot. Are we not at this moment at
the Oracle of the Christian World--at the Pyramids of
human empire--one and the same empire, whether
its throne be placed on one side of the Tiber or the
other ?"
Villiers made no answer, but the thought struck deep.
and his companion knew it, and refrained from disturbing
it for some minutes.
" You are young," he conti rued at last ; " who would

" They are grand proofs," replied Villiers, " of the

Look," he said, and he took from his pocket a packet of
letters; one post this morning has brought me letters
from every quarter of the globe." And with calmness
free from all ostentation he showed Villiers the post-
marks on nearly twenty.
" Your correspondence is extensive," said Villiers.
" Must you reply to them all ?"
" They must be replied to," said his companion, (and
Villiers observed that he did not say " I must reply,")
" to-day."
"I observed one," said Villiers, " from England;
from a place well known to me--from Hawkstone. May
I ask if you know any cne there?:?
The ecclesiastic slightly colored, and, simply saying
that his letter was accidentally put into the post there,
he proposed that they should descend the steps of the
Capitol, and pass on to the Campo Vaccino.
The conversation of that our sunk deep into the
mind of the ambitious, thoughtful, imaginative Villiers.
The next day and the next found him again with his
friend, who had been introduced to him, soon after his
arrival, as a countryman of his own, belonging to the

ance of intrusion, and as sought for rather than as seek.
ing him, to become his daily companion. Without any
seeming design, sometimes in the pursuit of amusement,
sometimes in a plan of study, sometimes by accidental
coincidences, Villiers found himself through the means
of Macarthy, brought into contact with all that could
most engage the affections and stimulate the imagination
in the papal city. All its ancient lore was even more
familiar to Macarthy than to himself. When Villiers
entered with avidity on an examination of its ruins,
Macarthy seemed to have made them for years his
favorite study,
He carried him to unexplored recesses,
illustrated half-obliterated inscriptions, brought forth from
an inexhaustible memory quotation on quotation; and
whenever Villiers was at a loss for a point of history, i
Macarthy omitted for the time to supply the information,
he was sure the next day to revert accidentally to it, and
to show that he was master of that subject. Villiers did
not know that the paleness of his cheek and thinness of
his frame were due partially to the midnight studies with
which he prepared himself to be in all points the assistant,
and at the same time the master of his companion. Th.
versatility and multiplicity of his talents (still withcui
officiousness, or bustle, or ostentation, for Macarthy was
discharging what he conceived a duty to his superiors,
not thinking of himself,) engaged even more the admira-
tion of Villiers. If Villiers expressed an admiration for
Dante, in a few days Macarthy would lead round the
conversation to him, and pour forth stanza after stanza cf
his most exquisite poetry. If he proposed to devote a day
to the sculptures of the Vatican, the morning slipped past
unheeded, as Macarthy illustrated their history with
anecdotes and theories of art. At one time Villiers
expressed an inclination to play billiards, and to his
surprise, when after some days delay, Macarthy allowed
him to find a table, and after some reluctance was induced
himself to play, Villiers was beaten by him. One law
Macarthy seemed to have laid down to himself. He
never entered on iry subject, nor took part in any pursuit

in which he was not Villiers' superior. Villiers was
young; and the society of Rome at that i ime was gay
and brilliant. Without any departure from propriety or
clerical gravity, Macarthy did not hesitate to share it
with him, and whatever attention was paid to the hand-
some, and noble, and wealthy Englishman, Macarthy
was not long in any company without drawing the chief
interest round himself, and bringing Villiers to stand
beside him, the spectator and admirer of his power. But
Villiers one day spoke with enthusiasm of the austerities
of a monastic life; and by some seemingly natural and
accidental circumstance, he was led to call on Macarthy
late on a cold wintry night, and found him without a fire,
with a single candle to light his studies, his solitary meal
evidently untasted, and the door of his bedroom open,
through which Villiers could not avoid seeing a rude
hair shirt, not displayed, but apparently lying casually,
ready to be put on. And let us do Macarthy justice. In
all that he did, however calculated to raise himself in
the eyes of Villiers, there was neither affectation noi
selfishness. He was placed by those to whom he had
sworn obedience, and whom he regarded in the place of
his Heavenly Master, to play a part, to accomplish a
work, and that work the fascination of Villiers : and as
the whole powers of his mind were thrown into his duty,
the affections of his heart became involved likewise.
And Villiers could not have found in the world one who
more dearly loved him, or would have sacrificed for him
more readily all that he valued, excepting only the one
absorbing interest of his society and his Church. He
could not witness Macarthy's private devotions, but they
were never uttered without prayers, and often tears for
him-prayers that he might one day he brought home to
the bosom of what Macarthy deemed the true Church,
and that Macarthy himself might be the instrument of
his salvation. One night, when they were making an
expedition in the Abruzzi, and were compelled to occupy
the same room, Villiers was startled to hear his name
repeated again and again in the disturbed dreams of his
companion, in tones of affectionate anxiety, and mixed
..

with entreaties for blessings on him, which went to
Villers' heart. At another time, as they were crossing
a winter torrent in the mountains, Villiers' foot had
slipped from a wet rock, and he was plunged headlong
in the stream, incapable, from the fury of the waters, of
exerting his powers of swimming. In a moment Macar.
thy was by his side, and by their joint efforts he reached
the bank. From that day the charm 'was completed ;
and it began to work.
" How are you advancing ?" was the question pui.
soon after to Macarthy by the superior of his Order.
"Why did you not bring him here last night, to see the
washing of the feet of the pilgrims ?"
Macarthy sighed, and answered, " that he had every
hope of bringing Villiers over in time, but that his was
not a mind to be dealt with rudely." And while he
uttered these words, something of pain and shame flushed
across his face, as if, even in the conversion of a soul,
trickery and artifice were unworthy either of man or of
the Gospel. And, indeed, nothing but Macarthy's real
and deep belief in the rectitude of his own views, which
gave warmth and sincerity even to his most elaborate
manuvres, could have prevented Villiers from detecting
and revolting against his ingenious artifices.
At one time, Macarthy would take him to an hos-
pital, where, among the sick and dying, instead of un-
feeling hirelings taken from the lowest orders, he saw
young and delicate women habited in a religious dress,
and ministering with tenderness and devotion to the
poorest sufferers. And as they came out, penetrated
with the spectacle, Macarthy would ask, as if inquiring.
ly, whether there was any thing of the kind in London,
or, as he would correct himself, among the Protestant
sects.
Another morning, the newspapers had brought woru
that some treaty of commerce had opened a port in
China to European settlers. And scarcely a day elap.
sed before Macarthy called on Villiers, to tell him that
he might now have an opportunity of witnessing the
consecration of a bishop, which was to take place ini

E
mediately. "We are sending out a bishop and seven
missionaries to China," he said, quietly.
" So soon ?" asked Villiers.
" And are we to leave the poor heath in a day,"
asked Macarthy, gravely, "without preaching to them
the Gospel ?"
" And how can you manage this ?" asked Villiers.
** In England, it would take years even to propose such
a plan, much more to complete it."
"We have our colleges," answered Macarthy, " and
devoted men always ready to go in bodies wherever they
are sent. We are not under the crown."
And Villiers was silent, but he treasured up the fact.
Oftentimes Macarthy would speak to him of his mother,
as of one with whose character he was familiar; and
as the tears came into Villiers' eyes at the recollection
of her sainted life and sainted death-bed, Macarthy
would turn aside : and not in affectation or hypocrisy,
but in deep unfeigned pain, would silently breathe a
prayer, that the son might yet be restored to the com.
munion of the mother; and Villiers understood his
thoughts.
"Perhaps," said Macarthy to him one evening, " you
had better not come to-morrow, as usual, to hear the
music in our chapel. There is a commemoration of the
dead ; and one name you would hear mentioned in our
prayers, which might affect you painfully. Lady Esther
was a benefactress to our Order. And I fear," he con.
tinued, " you could not join with us in praying for her
now."
It was almost the only bitter word which Macarthy
had ever used, but it went to Villiers' heart.
At another time, when Macarthy perceived that his
friend was suffering under depression of spirits, and with
the acuteness habitual to his Order had discerned that
there was something on his mind-some remorse which
required to be calmed-Macarthy led him through a
church by a confessional, where a penitent was kneel.

as he glanced round to observe Villiers, he saw that the
shaft had struck him. They left the church, neither of
them speaking : not a word passed till they found them-
selves in the open Campagna, beneath the solitary sky;
and, as Macarthy sat down to rest himself on the frag.
ment of an old ruin, Villiers, with a deep groan, knelt
down before him; and, hiding his face in his lap, en.
treated him to hear his confession. A by-stander might
have observed a look of joy and exultation in Macarthy's
lustrous eye pass into tenderness and sorrow, almost into
a tear, as he bowed his head down upon Villiers, and
prayed to God bless him ; but he knew too well the art
of fascination.

residents at Rome, by reading prayers to them on a
Sunday, and rehearsing a sermon of Blair's.

carthy, preserving all the time a profound silence on
any point of controversy, watched over Villiers. Villiers
had launched one day with enthusiasm into the vision of
an empire placed in the hands of one great mind,
unshackled by the fetters of a popular government, and
devoted with honesty and self-devotion to the good of
mankind. The same afternoon, Macarthy stopped in
their walk at the gate of one of the colleges in Roma

and, after some little delay, they were led into a small
cell. The stone floor simply matted over, the single
wooden chair, the simple deal table covered with papers
and books, the image of the Virgin under a niche, with
a lamp burning before it, and the fireless hearth, even
in the midst of winter, were familiar to Villiers ; and he
felt no surprise. But he was not prepared for the noble
and almost awful figure of the occupant of that humble
apartment ; for the command with which he raised him.
self from his seat, and bestowing no look on Macarthy,
who stood trembling in his presence, pointed to a map of
the earth before him, and with his eye fixed upon Vil.
liers"Beware!" he said ; "young man, remember
that it is nothing to gain the .whole world, and to
lose your own soul." He then waved his hand for
them to withdraw ; and Villiers learned from his still
awed companion, that he had seen the general of the
Jesuits.
There were many Germans at Porne ; and Villiers,
who did not understand the German language, endea-
vored to converse with them in Latin.
" Oh!" sighed Macarthy, "if but one language
could be spread over the whole world, to unite us all to.
gether in our devotions as in our converse, would it not
be a blessing ? Would it not almost repeal the curse of
Babel ?"
They spent morning after morning before the works of
art, with which every palace in Rome is filled ; and while
other curious visitants passed rapidly through the galleries,
some chatting idiy on common inatters, others scanning,
with absurd pretensions to criticism, the grandest works
of the great masters of painting and sculpture, and
others lounging lazily on sofas to gaze, through opera-
glasses, on the sufferings of saints, and admire the
anatomy of the muscles in the form of a crucified Redeem.
er, Macarthy would draw Villiers apart, and fix him
before some figure of the Blessed Virgin ; tell him how
in its softness and its dignity it was a type of the Church;
and, as he watched the picture, drawing into itself, by
degrees, the thoughts and affections of his companion,

Macarthy asked himself how any system of religion could
rule the heart of man which did not appeal to his imagi.
nation through his senses. With great care and judg
ment he withdrew Villiers from the popular spectacles
of religious ceremonies, and from every thing which
could suggest to him the too painful system of artifice
and deception with which Popery amuses and controls
its followers. He showed him no relics ; led him
through no tawdry churches ; carefully prevented his
reading any popular books of devotion ; spoke soberly
and sadly on some impostures, which at the time were
claiming tr de miracles; and only on one occasion had
committeu a mistake, when Villiers had remarked with
some severity on the. exhibition of a dirty doll hung
round with beads, and crowned with paper flowers,
before which a crowd of market-women were paying
their devotions. He had made a faint apology for it-
the usual apology of Popery-Populus vult decipi ei
decipiatur. But the indignant and astonished look with
which Villiers turned round to see if he were speaking
seriously,--his demand to know whether God has given
to the Church commission to deceive,to do evil that
good might come,--to rule by lies, as they startled Ma.
carthy himself, threw him also on his guard : and though
the principle had been laid deep in his own mind by the
whole system of his religious education, he never broached
it again. But to one spectacle in particular did Macarthy
accompany his companion. It was the ceremony of the
Pope's blessing the people in the great area before St.
Peter's; and as the venerable old man rose from his seat
over the grand entrance, and the multitude fell down
before him hushed into the profoundest silence, Macarthy
felt Villiers kneeling by his side, and kneeling even after
the cannon from St. Angelo had broken the trance, and
the shouts and cries of the struggling crowd around them
had dispelled the magic of that wondrous scene. But
Macarthy did not lose the opportunity. The next day,
as they parted, he left in Villiers' hand a note-book,
closely and carefully written through.
" Yesterday," he said, " we both were kneeling side

You think," he continued, " that the whole was a
delusion. And if you did not love me, you would de.
spise me for becoming the slave of such an imposture as
the papal supremacy. This is the language of Pro-
testants. I do not like that you should despise me. I
have therefore brought together in this book the testimo-
nies of antiquity--of Catholic antiquity," he repeated,-
"to the truth of our doctrine ; and, perhaps, you would
like to look at them."
The next morning Villiers received a note from
him, to say that he was called away suddenly from Rome.
Days passed, weeks passed, two months passed, and
Macarthy did not appear or write. He had planted the
seed securely, and he was too wise to stand by and dis-
turb the process of germination. Villiers himself
, with
the departure of his companion, disappeared from the
general society of Rome. He was intently occupied, in
the mornings, in the libraries to which he could gain
access, in his solitary walks involved in abstracted
thoughts, and far beyond midnight his lamp was seen
hurning in his room, till his countrymen of the Piazza di
Spagna spoke of him as a prodigy of learning, or as a
recluse soon likely to be involved in the net of Popery.
One only Englishman might be seen with him at times,
climbing feebly the steps of the Piazza, for he was just
recovering from a long illness. And as the passers-by
saw him, with Villiers' assistance, mounting the acclivity,
and observed his sunken cheek and glassy eye, they
marked him as one who would add another to the victims
of the stranger's burial-ground. He was a clergyman of
middle age, bearing no marked character upon his features
or figure, quiet, equable in temper, resigned and cheerful,
as one whose past life had neither been ruffled by great
shocks of sorrow, nor stained by memories of evil, and
whose knowledge, accurate and sound rather than
iniversal, had been obtained by a patient, steady, unde.
viating course of study, in which he was seeking not for
the display of talent, or the satisfaction of a presumptuous

IIAWKSTONE.
171
curiosity, but to prove and develop truths which he had
already embraced heartily under the teaching of his
Church. In this good, simple-minded, sensible man, a
type of the character of the English Church in general,
Villiers became deeply interested. His perfect simplicity,
his freedom from effort, his abstinence from all attempts
to display himself or to influence others, the tranquillity
with which he retired unnoticed in society, and the open-
ness, not without thoughtfulness and discretion, with
which he spoke in private, fell upon Villiers with a degree
of novelty and freshness. It was a relief after the
depth and brilliancy which had marked the conversation
of Macarthy ; and from the profound carefulness with
which his every movement seemed to have been regu-
lated, as if some design and object lay beneath each
action. But there were other bonds of union between
them, and each week more and more time was spent
by them together ; and as Beattie's health improved,
before tables thickly strewed with books, till the day
which brought to Villiers a letter from Macarthy. It
was short, but ardent and affectionate. He apologized
for not writing before, by the pressure of business ; made
no allusion to anything which had passed between them,
and only hoped that he should see Villiers as soon as
he arrived in Rome ; or that, if he had left Rome, Villiers
would carry with him, wherever he went, the remem-
brance of one who dearly loved him. Villiers' brow
worked painfully as he cast his eyes over the letter. He
was in Beattie's room, immersed with him, as usual, in a
pile of folios ; and as he laid the letter down, and rested
his face upon his hands, Beattie looked up quietly, and
saw by the close pressure of his fingers that he was
engaged in some internal struggle. At last he recovered
himself, and simply saying that it was a letter from
Macarthy, who would be in Rome next week, he resumed
his writing.
On that day week Macarthy arrived in Rome. If
any one had imagined from his absence or his silence
that he had lost sight of Villiers, he would have done
him grievous injustice. His absence had been contrived
## p. 172 (#184) ############################################
172
HAWKSTONE.
for the very purpose of giving free unsuspected scope
to the working of the suggestions which he had made
to him. A double time had been allotted to the prayers
in which he entreated a blessing upon his labors, and as
he fondly deemed it, upon the head of his friend, by his
restoration to the unity of the Church. His asceticism
was increased, his voluntary penances made more severe.
And though, too often, a chill and deadness of feeling
hung upon him as if his devotions would be unheard, at
times he mistook the excitement and enthusiasm of over-
wrought sensibility for a divine inspiration within, and
solaced himself already with the thought of embracing
his friend, as his own work, and as such, adding him
as a worthy conquest to the triumphs of his idolized
Society. His heart beat as he entered the gates of Rome.
It throbbed quicker, under an outward veil of perfect
composure, as he ascended the staircase to his apartment,
almost expecting that Villiers would be there to meet
him. But the room was empty, the evening passed,
and Villiers arrived not. The next day came, and though
Macarthy remained within, listening to every step that
approached his door, it closed in blankness and dis.
appointment, and all his dreams seemed vanished. And
yet, in what way an honest ardent mind like Villiers,'
bent upon simple truth, and ready from inclination to
receive it, could escape from the overwhelming evidence
which Macarthy believed that he had placed before him
in favor of the fundamental article of his own religious
creed, it was hard to imagine. Should he go himself and
seek Villiers ? But Macarthy was too proud to seek
where he desired to be sought, and too prudent to risk
repulsion by an officious over-zealous attempt to attract.
The third morning relieved his anxiety in some degree.
It brought him a little note, simple and cold, and avoiding
even the usual formal expressions of regardto say, that
if Macarthy was disengaged, Villiers would come to him
that evening; and he did come. But, from the first
moment of his appearance, Macarthy saw that all his
feelings were changed, and that something had occurred
o break the spell of his own personal influence over him,

HAWKSTONE.
173
and that Villiers was no longer his captive. The formal
apology, the hand laid coldly in his own, and suffering
motionless the pressure of Macarthy'sa pressure which
Macarthy instantly checked-sufficiently told the tale
of some secret estrangement. Macarthy's pride came
at once to cover his disappointment, and enabled him to
meet the cold and severe look of Villiers with equal
reserve and self-possession.
"I am come, Mr. Macarthy," said Villiers, and his
voice faltered as he said Mr., and something of his former
tenderness seemed returning," I am come to replace
in your hands a little book, which you were good enough
to trust me with before you left Rome. You intended, I
am well aware, that I should study it thoroughly, and I
nope, therefore, you will excuse me if I have interleaved
it, and added to it suggestions and corrections of my
own." And as he placed the volume in Macarthy's
hand, and met Macarthy's eyes, surprised, and yet
unflinchingly fixed to meet his, some misgiving arose in
Villiers's mind as to the justice of his severity. Macarthy
said nothing, but opened the book. He found it, indeed,
interleaved, interlined, filled with MS. notes in Villiers's
handwriting, and with references, which had evidently
been drawn from a very deep and extensive course of
reading.
" And is there," said he, "anything in this book, Mr.
Villiers, which should have worked the change which I
cannot but perceive--anything which should destroy our
former regard for each other? It was drawn up with a
very different intention."
"I do believe it," replied Villiers; "I cannot have
been insensible to your anxiety, a well-meant but ill-regu-
lated anxiety, to win me over to your own form of religion.
I neither complain nor condemn. It is a good and a
Christian zeal, when conducted with reverence for truth ;
but I do lament, lament bitterly, Macarthy, that you
should have endeavored to convert me, even to what you
believe to be the truth, by an imposture."
Macarthy's color leaped into his face, and he half
started from his chair, but sat down again, confronting

Villiers with an open indignant look which demanded
explanation.
"May I ask," said Villiers, "if this collection of
authorities and testimonies to the doctrine which you
desire to impress on me was compiled by yourself from
the original writers ?"
" It was made," said Macarthy,
I intended to
express at the time I gave it to you, from our own contro-
versialists. I wished you to see the lire of argument
which they adopted, and the evidence on which they
proceeded.
" And you have never verified them yourself ?" said
Villiers.
"I have not," replied Macarthy ; "I have myself
faith in my teachers, and am willing to accept their state-
ments. It is our practice, and our first lesson, to discard
doubt in the honesty and correctness of those who are
placed to rule over us.
" And as a collection from your controversialists you
gave it to me ?" said Villiers.
"Most assuredly," replied Macarthy.
imagined that you would mistake it for anything else, or
myself for a man of so much learning."
Villiers's face in a moment resumed all its old cheer-
fulness and affection. "I have done you wrong, Ma.
carthy, a grievous wrong; but you must forgive me;" and
he stretched out his hand, which Macarthy met and took,
but did not press, for he was offended as well as amazed.
" I did you a grievous wrong, dear Macarthy," con-
tinued Villiers, "and I must make a full reparation for it."
" May I ask first," said Macarthy, " for an explanation
of this rather singular conduct ?"

your volume, I was overpowered with the accumulation
of evidence which it brought to bear on your favorite
dogma. I found an array of names, whose authority it
was impossible to dispute ; distinct enunciation of the
doctrine from the earliest times, which no art could
misinterpret; and quotation on quotation which, it seemed
clear, no opposite testimony could overcome, or eveni

happened to return to it, and to light on a passage quoted
from St. Cyprian, a striking and overwhelming testimony,
as you have there extracted it, to the papal supremacy.
A copy of St. Cyprian was lying, may I not say provi-
dentially, by me, and I turned to the passage in the
original. What was my astonishment to find that the
words on which necessarily turned the whole propriety
of the application of his expressions to the See of Rome,
were acknowledged as a well-known interpolation even
by the Romanist editor, and were carefully excluded from
his text,the very text, remember, to which your refer-
ence was given."
Macarthy's eye continued firmly facing Villiers; and
he proceeded. "One discovery," he said, " of this kind
induced me to examine further,--to examine laboriously
and honestly, and not without assistance, but with a
single desire to discover truth. And shall I tell you the
result ?"
Macarthy begged him to proceed.
" I found," said Villiers, " that nearly every impor-
tant passage was garbled in the same manner, and in the
face of direct warnings against the corruptions, which
corruptions it was impossible to doubt had been originally
fastened upon the text by papal transcribers and editors.
I found that other passages which were not garbled were
yet wholly misapplied that what the ancient Fathers
had spoken of the whole Catholic Apostolic Church,
without any restriction to the branches in communion
with the Bishop of Rome, was employed as if those epi.
thets had been used, as you abuse them now, exclusively
to designate your own peculiar branch. I found that
spurious documents were appealed to as genuine ; and
obvious interpolations of whole sentences admitted with:-
out a hint or warning. I catalogued the list of author-
ities, and affixed their dates, and to my astonishment
discovered the art with which ancients and moderns---
Fathers of the Catholic Church and doctors of the Romish
schoolswere mixed together, to present an overwhelming
catena of testimonies, out of which but two or three were

valid, as legitimate evidence. And when I coinpared the
real accounts of the constitution of the Church in the
ages which we are bound to follow with your own
description of them, I could find little but direct contra-
diction. Pardon me, Macarthy, if, as I read this compi-
lation of forgeries and deceptions (for I can call it little
else) and imagined you to have been the author of it, and
this for the purpose of inducing me to embrace a system
of religion based upon this one foundation, I did resent it,
and did forget all that I had formerly felt for you. When
we have been deceived in one point, we suspect deceit in
all. Before this, others endeavored to persuade me that
pious frauds were an essential part of your system. But
I never could willingly believe it. And when once
there fell from your lips that hateful maxim, Populus vult
decipi, et decipiatur, I persuaded myself that you were
speaking in irony. May I believe so still, and that your
controversialists alone are responsible for this cheat ? "
Macarthy did not look up. A slight pang crossed him
as he felt that the maxim so hateful to Villiers had been
uttered by him, not in irony, but in sober seriousness ;
and that if the imposition, of which he had been the un.
intentional aider, was gross and enormous, it was still
in perfect consistency with the principles of that dominion
over men by human arts, though for religious purposes,
which his life was devoted to maintain. But the shock
to his mind was great. He received the book, carefully
locked it up, and then taking Villiers's hand, " I never
intended to deceive you," he said, simply ;

And the pressure of Villiers's hand showed that his
confidence was restored.

But in Macarthy's own mind confidence was not re.
stored. Villiers from that hour made no attempt to
resume the subject. Whatever fascination had been
previously thrown around him by the apparent grandeur,
unity and splendor of the Romish system, the discovery
of the hollowness and vanity of its fundamental assump-
tion, and of the artifices with which it was supported, had
dispelled the whole illusion. He now walked the streets
of Rome almost with loathing, as a scene of imposition,
pitiable and pardonable in the deceived, but frightful and
impious in the deceivers. As he examined the doc-
trinal errors of its system, he could detect in all of them
the element of popular influence which the lust of rule
required, and to which, and not to truth, it clung with
such vigorous tenacity. And as he read the history of
modern days, and especially of his own country since the
Reformation, he could enter with heartier sympathy into
the struggles, and compassionate with more indulgence
the errors of the minds by which, in one portion of the
globe, popery had been resisted and exterminated, though
not without loss. But theology, as yet, had been taken
up by him only as a theoryas a vision for the imagi-
nation ; and when the first vision which he had formea
broke
up before his
eyes, he was left in a state of dreary
doubt and coldness, without any foundation on which io
restany positive system, either to realize in himself, or
to inculcate upon others. The thought, therefore, of
bringing Macarthy from error, never occurred to him ;
and even if it had occurred, the natural delicacy of his
mind would have shrunk from obtruding on a task to which
he was not called, and for which he possessed little
fitness. Even if he had undertaken it, what, according
to his then views, could he offer Macarthy in exchang",
for the system which he would abandon, and which.
false and hollow as it was, was still a splendid falsehood !
In the mean while Macarthy's own mind was working
upon itself.
It is not true that the quarrels of friends

are the renewal of friendship. Friendship is a delicate
plant, and every rude touch, though it does not uproot,
shakes and mars it. And the suspicion and resentment
once felt by Villiers, though cast away at Macarthy's
frank declaration, had left the shade of an evil association
with his name, which, unreasonable as Villiers confessed
it to be, he could not altogether dispel. Their inter-
course became less frequent ; and Macarthy himself
pleaded occupation and study in excuse for it. And when
they did meet, Villiers was pained to see a marked alter.
ation in his manner and appearance. He became gra.
dually reserved and silent ; his mind was apparently
engaged in abstracted and anxious thought; and his eye
was restless, and no longer possessed of that singular
power of penetration with which he used to fascinate
those with whom he conversed. Lines of care began to
mark his countenance. From a frank, open apology of
occupation, he seemed driven to find excuses for avoiding
a meeting with Villiers. If he came to him, it was late
in the evening ; and in the day-time he never walked
with him, as before. When Villiers called on him, he
evinced impatience and anxiety for his departure. And
at last, after having been informed several times by the
porter that Mr. Macarthy was not within, Villiers received
an embarrassed note from himself, pleading that he was
peculiarly circumstanced at present, and must deny him-
self the pleasure of seeing him so often. Villiers, of
course acquiesced, with some surprise, and still more
of offended pride. In his thoughts he charged Macarthy
with foolish resentment at the refutation which had been
given to his polemical theories. Alas! he little knew the
misery which he had caused to him, and the fiery trial
through which he was now passing. Weeks had passed
without his seeing him, when, on sending once more to
know if Mr. Macarthy was in Rome, an answer was
given that he had left it, and would not return for some
little time ; and Villiers gave up all hope of seeing him,
and prepared himself for his journey to Naples. He was
to depart the next morning. But before he quitted the
Eternal City, he gave himself up to spend one more

evening among its ruins, to stand once more by moon.
light on the steps of the Capitol, to listen once more, in
the cool silence, to the plashing of the fountains among
the colonnades of St. Peter, and to sit once more on the
topmost range of the Coliseum--that image of the for-
tunes of Rome--that concentration of its wonderful history,
and still more wondrous character.
The moonlight was streaming in masses through the
dark piers of that gigantic structure. The distant hum
of the Corso scarcely reached his ear as he ascended to
a favourite point, from which his eye could command the
whole area. There was the enormous pile, reared by
human art to gratify the meanest craving of an enormous
ambition. There was the ground polluted with the blood
of hireling gladiators, to slake that thirst for excitement,
that avidity for power, which converted even the theatre
of Rome into a butchery and charnel-house. There was
the scene of martyrdom ; and Villiers blessed himself
that the day of persecution had passed for ever, till he re-
membered the Inquisition. He sat immersed, not in
thought, but in a dreamy, melancholy, trance-like stupor,
under the immediate presence and eye, as it were, of an
awful spirit, which seemed to fill and haunt the ruins.
And he heard no step behind him till he was touched on
the shoulder, and a low hollow voice sounded in his ear,
* Villiers-dear Villiers !"
He turned round, and, disguised and enveloped in a
large cloak, he saw Macarthy. As the moon emerged
from a cloud and fell upon his face, Villiers was shocked
and startled to see its haggard cast and ashy hue. It was
the image of secret anguish ; and every trace of cool.
ness and resentment vanished from Villiers's mind in
compassion.
" You are ill," he said, " Macarthy ; how came you
here at this hour? They sent word to me, only yester-
you
had left Rome."
" Did they ?" said Macarthy. "I knew nothing of it ;
but thanks be to heaven, I am here. I have escaped
them. Only you are yourself in danger. This is no
safe place, he saiil, looking round him, " for any one,
day, that

much less for us. These dark passages and cells have
a bad reputation ; and two men were stabbed in them
last week."
Villiers knew it, but he was fearless.
" I could not leave Rome," he said, " without once more
coming here by moonlight. But you are ill, Macarthy
dear Macarthy; what is the matter?"
" Not ill," replied Macarthy, "not ill, only in tor-
ment. But I have borne it. I have gone through the
worst; and if I can but breathe another air, I shall be
well."
* And what have you suffered ?" said Villiers.
" It is a long tale," replied the other, " and I have but
a few moments. Hush!" he continued, " we are ob-
served. Did you not see a figure moving round that
corner.
" and we

Villiers looked, but all was still.
" There are two of us," he said ;
have given no cause of offence to any one. Be not
alarmed."
Macarthy drew breath more freely, but proceeded in
a low voice, almost in a whisper-
" You," he said, and his voice faltered tenderly-
you whom I loved so dearly, whose name has been in
all my prayers, the thought of whom has been the last to
soothe me at night and to wake me in the morning, --
you whom I have sought to make my own, until I
have at times forgotten my God,-you have been my des-
troyer!"
Villiers looked up with amazement.
" You have made me," Macarthy continued, with a
sepulchral voice, " an Infidel. No," he continued, after
a pause, and drawing himself up once more to stand as
he used to stand when he would command and
rivet his hearer, "not an Infidel.
Thanks to my
God, thanks to better thoughts and prayer, I have not
lost all. Something is true within me in what we
have learned and felt of Christianity: but what, or how
much, or where, or how it may be found, I know not. I

every moment vanish also from my grasp ; and but one
thing on earth am I sure ofthat Popery is a lie; and
they know that I know it; and I have been in their
hands." And Villiers shuddered at the tone of mingled
terror and loathing with which Macarthy uttered his last
words.
" I have been in their hands, Villiers," he continued;
and he bared his arm, and Villiers saw that it was
blackened and almost paralysed as by some dreadful tor-
ture.
" They found my book---your book," he said. " They
watched my reading as I followed it. They had their
confessional; they wrung from me every thought of my
heart. I had been their chosen minister, in the posses:
sion of their secrets. Judge, Villiers, if they would spare
me !"
And he again looked trembling behind him to catch a
creaking sound, which seemed like a step creeping steal-
thily along the dark vaulted passage at his back.
" Move out," he said to Villiers, " into the open
air.
It is better in the light."
" And how, then, are you here ?" asked Villiers.
"I have been bound down," he said, -" golemnly and
awfully bound down; and one voice was raised to save me,
or I should not be here. But I am escaped from them,
escaped for the present, though every movement is watch-
ed. I saw you from the wretched place where I have

are yourself in danger, and should leave Rome without
delay."
" And why not leave it with me?" asked Villiers.
" I cannot," said Macarthy ; "I am bonnd hand and
foot, and dare not stir. And if I could
escape
where am

" To England," said Villiers, " to your own country,

" Our church," said Villiers, " is open to you. We do
not deny your orders."
" No," said Macarthy," you do not deny our power to
minister ; but will you, can you, trust to us to minister,
at least for years, till you have tried us; and meanwhile
-hark again, surely that was a footstep ?"
And Villiers advanced to look into the dark passage,
but all was still and silent, and only the hooting of a so-
litary owl broke the breathless calm that reigned around
them. The unhappy man sunk down and buried his face
with his hands, till Villiers once more suggested his en.
deavoring to reach England.
England !" said Macarthy, " where the prisoner is
freed by the very touch of the soil on which he stands !
England, the refuge of the world !" And he seemed to
revive at the thought.
" And our church," repeated Villiers, " is still open to
you."
Yes," muttered Macarthy, " if it be true. And
if truth be found upon earth, I would fain hope that it is
there, though at present all is dark around me. I can
believe in nothing. I can only suspect and disbelieve;"
and he heaved a deep groan.
" Life and the world, and
earth and heaven, are all a blank."
"Will you not examine further and inquire ?" asked
Villiers, tenderly.
" Inquire!" cried Macarthy, with a bitter laugh of
irony. " Have I not inquired once ? And wbat has
been the end ?"
And then, after a pause, he resumed, as if the possi-
bility of so doing had dawned upon him.
" nd if I could inquire, where should I be mean-
while ? Outcast, degraded, despised; rejected with
suspicion by those to whom he comes, and persecuted
even to the death by those whom he abandons; his
heart broken ; his mind distracted-friendlesswithout
books--without support or guidance-shut out even from
the channels of aid from God, if such there be ; starving,
perhaps, and destitute of all things ;-you bid the wretch

183
your own--you bid him inquire ! Villiers, is it not a
mockery? Do you remember," said Macarthy, after a
long silence," do you remember that miserable man"
(and he alluded to a case which they had witnessed),
" the apostate priest? Do you recollect his shame and
nis sins, when he was driven from the shelter of his
Church, and exposed naked and defenceless to the temp-
tations of the world, which he had never known before ?
Why should not my end be like his ?" And he sprang
up in desperation, and stood trembling on the very verge
of the precipitous wall, till Villiers seized his arm, and,
entreating him to be calm, reminded him of the hour
and scene when his own life had been saved by Ma-
carthy's arm.
"Can you," he said, looking steadfastly into his dis-
tracted eye" can you speak of poverty, and destitution,
and friendlessness, while I am living ?"
Macarthy's pride, controlled and subdued as it had
been by his former position, in which the grandeur of
the body of which he was a member, compensated for
the humiliation of the individual, had now resumed its
sway, and almost scornfully he withdrew his arm.
cannot," he said, " be dependent even upon you." But,
recovering himself, he continued : " One thing there is
which you might do, and which I could accept without
shame. You might procure me admission for a time to
one of your colleges." And his eye turned up in hope
as the thought struck him. 6. There I might be safe for
a time, and at peace; and there, with the necessary help,
I might perhaps--once more he stopped, and then
added faintly" inquire."
Villiers did not understand him, and looked at him
for an explanation.
"Our colleges ?" he asked.
" Yes," said Macarthy, " you have literary colleges,
where there are libraries, and religious services, and
good associations, and discipline, and shelter from temp-
tation, and learned men, and means of living with
quiet and respectability at least, upon comparatively
hurrble means. Ours are always open to receive any

converts from your faith to ours ; they are admitted to a
shelter immediately ; and in that awful crisis which must
take place in the transition from one communion to the
other, they are nursed, and watched, and disciplined,
until they are strong enough to return once more into the
world. You must have such refuges in England ; and
in them I might still be saved."
" Alas!" said Villiers, mournfully, " I know of none
such. Colleges, indeed, we have, wealthy and nume.
rous, but they have not been used for such a purpose ;
perhaps they could not be."
"Not one ?" asked Macarthy again, " not one ? not
a single place of refuge for the miserable beings whom
you are daily almost execrating for remaining in popery,
and calling on them as their only salvation to come over
to your Church?
And do you thus cruelly endeavor to
break down the roof and walls of the home in which
they are sheltered, and to turn them adrift and naked upon
the world without caring where they go ? And when
they come and sit down before your own doors, craving
for some shed to cover them, you bid them wait and
inquire. Oh, Villiers, can this be the Church of Eng.
landof England, the merciful and the wise ?"
Villiers sighed deeply, but could make no reply.
"Then," said Macarthy, after a lengthened silence,
" all is lost." He started up and listened, as a fragment
of stone detached from the wall fell down in the dark
passage through which they had passed, and both fancied
they heard a suppressed cough.
" Come," said Macarthy, " let us separate.
I have
been followed and watched for days; and to be seen with
you might ruin me."
" And why ?" asked Villiers.
" Because," replied Macarthy, "I know all their
designs upon you. Beware, Villiers, how you trust to
any one. "Leave Rome immediately. At Napleseven
in England-even in the farthest part of the globe, re.
member that there is a power seated here which has a
thousand eyes and a thousand arms, and can walk the
earth invisibly, working its will at any mornent and in
any place ; and its eyes are fixed on you."

HAWKSTOND.
185
Villiers understood the allusion, for he knew that
Macarthy was a Jesuit. But why he should himself be
their object he could not imagine.
" Are you not aware," said Macarthy, "can you
have been so long in Rome, so long with me"and he
groaned again), " without seeing the intense avidity with
which every Englishman of rank and influence is brought
within the range of their fascination ? Upon England
their eyes are fixed as on the one great hope of restoring
their Empire. Every concession to an insane toleration,
every popular movement, every trembling and shaking of
the boughs of the English Church, every foreign alliance
or foreign commerce which threatens either the downfal
of the old English antipapal system, or the revival of a
papal influence, they watch and foster with an art which
almost defies detection, but ensures success.
Your name
is on the list of those from whom it hopes much. Your
mother's memory, your last associations at Oxford, and
all which they have witnessed in you here, have marked
you as their victim. Beware of every one. Beware"
But before the word was finished, there was a rush
behind. Macarthy staggered and fell into tho arms of
Villiers ; and before Villiers could disengage himself, a
figure, muffled up, leaped past him into one of the deep
dark passages on the other side. Villiers sprung after
hinn, and all but grasped his neck, but with a tremendous
effort the assassin shook him off, shot down the steps, and
disappeared in the labyrinth. Villiers rushed back to
find Macarthy bathed in blood and stretched dead upon
the ground. His arms were crossed as if his last thought
had been prayer. But the dagger had reached his heart,
and life had fied.

CHAPTER XV.
As the spring of that year came on, the loiterer on the
Chiaia at Naples might have observed, day after day, at
a certain hour, an English carriage drawn up before one
of the principal houses on that delicious suburb. After
delays, often very capricious, a little, thin-visaged, mean-
looking old man, with a soured and fretful countenance,
would be assisted into it by his valet for his morning
drive. And if the loiterer had also loitered before in the
Piazza di Spagna at Rome, he might have recognized
the same carriage and the same old man at the hotel
which was then occupied by General Villiers ; but the
ralet had been changed. Just before the General. left
Rome his former courier, upon some pretence or other,
expressed a wish to remain behind, and to recommend in
his own place the present stout, active, useful, obse.
quious, and accommodating, close-shaven, though rather
sinister-looking person, who, after almost lifting the
fretful General into his carriage, and arranging his large
silk handkerchief, his muff, his snuff-box, his cane, his
newspaper, and his poodle, without a murmur at the
General's
's angry complaints at the cold air or the hot sun,
took his seat behind the carriage with the air of one who
was now master of the vehicle and of all that it contained,
and ordered the coachman to drive as usual towards
Pausilippo. The same loiterer might also have ob-
served, that on one or two occasions a young man,
singularly contrasted with the feeble and pinched figure
of the General, tall, and nobly formed, but with a deep
melancholy inpressed upon his countenance, and dressed
in mourning, had taken his seat on the opposite side of
the carriage, but with a look of weariness and ennui.
Little conversation passed between them, except some
tart remarks of the old man on the dress or gesture
of his companion, on his still continuing to wear mourn-
ing, or on some accidental interference with the sill:

of the decrepit valetudinarian. His remarks on passers.
hy were snarling and ill-natured. His observations,
when made on the contents of the newspaper, of which
he carefully perused all the advertisements, scarcely
went beyond some faded reminiscence of past gayety
recalled by the columns of the Morning Post, or the
price of stocks. He dozed during a great part of his
ride ; and if, when he woke up, he found his companion
engaged in reading, he made some angry complaint
that he could find no one to talk to him ; or would ask,
sueeringly, if that was one of the new popish books
from England, and when the young man intended to turn
monk.
With ill-disguised impatience, and sometimes with
less of respect than became a son toward a father,even
a weak, fretful, irreligious, and mean-minded father,-
Villiers either answered shortly or remained silent

tormentor, whenever he found him engaged in some
study or interesting occupation, called on him to come
out and accompany him. Each day, and almost each
hour, brought with it some little vexation of this kind,
which fretted Villier's temper, and disturbed even his
own self-respect. In his own mind miserable and doubt-
ing, still suffering from the shock which the frightful
scene in the Colosseum had given to him, with no gran
object before him to occupy his life, and with the daily
presence of littleness and lowness in all that he saw of
man, whether in the vicious infirmity of his father, or in
the habits of a Neapolitan population, he became mor-
bidly sensitive to the annoyances to which he was sub-
jected even in the presence of society. His father's life
had been more than idle or useless ; it had been vicious ;
and Villiers know it. And in old age a paralysis of

mind was coming on which extinguished al hope of re.
pentance. He bad been a cruel husband to the mother
whom Villiers adored. And in more than the little
habits of daily intercourse, in threats of casting off his
son, and depriving him of his inheritance, he was a ty-
rannical father. One person only in the house seemed
to bear with him imperturbably. It was Pearce, or Mr.
Pearce, as the servants, who dreaded him as much as
they disliked their master, universally called him. It
was he who slept in his master's room, who arranged
his gouty stool, unfolded and dried his newspaper, pur-
chased his peculiar snuff at a peculiar shop, made his
posset, and administered it at nighteven fed his poodle.
and shaved his beard, without extorting from the old man
any very violent outbreak of anger. A spell seemed to
be laid upon the General by the very presence of Pearce.
There was something in his look penetrating and cun-
ning, and yet, when he choose, commanding, which at
first disgusted even Villiers himself, as it overawed his
father. But Pearce to his young master was more than
attentive ; he was obsequious and flattering, as clever
servants can be even to intelligent masters. He made
himself useful in a thousand little ways, gradually super-
seded Villier's own man in many trifling offices, which
the cleverer eye and head of Pearce better understood.
And at last he attained the grand point which he had
gradually but unsuspectedly worked up to, of paying
Villiers's little bills, obtaining free access to his room,
and at times even copying for him a letter, or writing
out some extract from a book which Villiers might wish
to preserve. Villiers could not like him, but could not
deny that he was a very clever, very obliging, and very
useful fellow. Nor was his appreciation of his attain-
ments diminished, when one day, having received from
Pearce a transcript from a passage in Burke, in which
a Latin quotation had been misprinted, he found that the
error had been corrected by Pearce, who, on Villiers ex-
pressing surprise, informed him that he had been taugh.
Latin when a boy.

cupations? He could scarcely tell himself. Stunned
and horror-struck at what he had witnessed at Rome, he
had delayed his departure in the hope of finding some
clue to the murder of poor Macarthy, but could reach
Strange obstacles and delays were thrown in his
way by the police themselves. Once, when a cap hau
been found in the dark passages of the Colosseum, and
a hope was raised that it might serve to trace or identify
the assassin, it disappeared from his possession, and he
could never find it again. Nor, indeed, was assassination
so uncommon an event at Rome as to create generally
the interest and suffering which it had caused in himself.
He was at last adviced by a judicious Italian, and ad.
vised with a degree of significance, that his search was
hopeless, and that it would be necessary to abandon it;
and with a sickened, loaded heart he followed his father
to Naples.
Youth, by a strange elastic power, soon recovers even
from the most frightful shock. But Villiers, even at
Naples, did not recover. By degrees, indeed, the hor-
rible vision, with which his dreams were at first haunted,
died away. He no longer heard Macarthy's last "Be-
ware !" ringing in his ears, or saw his ghastly haggard
face gazing on him through his curtains at midnight, and
almost reproaching him with his death. Though at the
first moment all the tenderness of affection, which he
had once felt, seemed to revive, afterwards the later
train of association resumed its place. And especially
as his temper and patience became embittered by the
trials of his father, he found himself at times almost re.
garding poor Macarthy's memory with the same resent.
ment as if he really had meditated the deception which
he involuntarily practised. It is a sad and awful trial,
heaviest perhaps of all to which human nature can be

take no interest in the ancient associations of Naples,
and all that surrounded it, for the study reminded him of
Rome and of Macarthy; and he was obliged, as the
thought struck him, to close his book, shut his eyes, and
take refuge in the crowded noisy streets of the luxurious
city. Here he could find nothing to elevate, little to

with his father, and the still more solitary evening, while
his father was dozing in his arm-chair, had left him at
liberty for the enjoyment of real solitude-the solitude
of a vision-peopled nature. And these moments, when
he threw his mind as it were upon a couch, and casting
off all exertion of thought, all memory, and all forecast-
ings of the future, gave himself up the luxurious influ-
ence of that delicious climate and glorious scenery, be.
came at last his only enjoyment. They soothed and
tranquillized him, and yet excited his imagination,
acting almost like an opiate on his distracted mind, and
filling him with a dreamy languor, full of luxurious sen-
sibility, but full also of a deadly poison. His religious
feelings, however crushed and chilled by what had pas.
sed, happily were not destroyed. They had been, and
continued to be, his safeguard through all the worst forms
of temptation to which, amidst a dissolute society, sepa-
rated from all the influences of his Church, and from all
examples of high rectitude in his own countrymen, he
was necessarily exposed. Once, in a moment of intense
weariness and self-reproach which followed a scene of
contemptuous vexation from his father, and almost of re-
crimination on his own side (for Villiers's ser se of duti-
fulness was rapidly sinking), he happened to be drawn

given himself up to the impulse of gaming himself,
but a vision of his inother, of her prayers and injunctions,
came across him, and he left the room with precipita-
tion. At other times, when, as he fondly thought, a
better spirit was moving within hima spirit of peace
and love, undisturbed by idle controversies, and resting
calmly in the great truths of religion, in which all creeds
united,he would abandon himself, not to the contem-
plation, but to the soft gentle influences of nature, tracing
a hand of love and a vision of glory in all her works, in
the bright stars, the breathless night, the eternal ocean,
the soft air that fanned his brow as he lay stretched in
his boat upon the sea, or sat listlessly on
eaten promontory, listening to the lulling waters, or in-
haling fragrance from a flower. Startled as he would

father's society. In later years, when, proved and dis-
ciplined by sufferings, Villiers looked back upon the
scenes of this period, it was always with a keen and deep-
ening remorse--remorse which in the secrecy of his
own chamber found vent in stated days of humiliation
and penitence. He was not indeed led to any open vio.
lent breach of filial respect, though to this he was often
tempted ; but his good taste saved him from it-it would
have been ungentlemanly. But the cold reply when his
father asked him some painful question ; the dead si-
lence to which he abandoned himself during their meals ;
the reluctance to meet half-way even the occasional
overture of his father to a more amicable communica-

religion had been unveiled before him; and as he stood
by his father's grave, he asked where his spirit then was,
and whether he himself might not have done something
to rescue it while it was upon earth.

self more assiduously to enliven his sick room, Villiers
was tempted to absent himself and to enjoy his freedom,
by prolonging his rides or boatings. To Pearce
the active, obsequious, ever-ready Pearce, who under-
stood all the old man's humors, and had now obtained
a complete command over him, so that the poor decrepit
being, sinking into dotage, scarcely dared to move
without asking permission and advice from his hireling,
Villiers abandoned his father. The excuse for retiring
himself was easy and ready, though it was not without
some pang of self-reproach. His father disliked himself,
and liked Pearce. His own presence only seemed to
cause irritation, or his patience was so exhausted that he
required repose and relaxation. Alas: how easily we
can excuse what we like.
One evening the General had been more than usually
querulous and sarcastic upon the companion of his tte--
tte dinner, until it amounted to rudeness; and Villiers'
suffused face showed that he was treasuring up a store
of bitter jeeling.

ness increased. One by one, Pearce endeavored to
engage him with the many childish but expensive gew
gaw's, in which his frivolous mind still endeavored to
find relief from the monotony of existence. The parrot
repeated its lesson, the poodle had performed its tricks ;
and as Villiers lifted up his eyes from some poetry which
he was reading, an involuntary expression of scorn rather
than of compassion rose to his lips, but was checked in
time. The heat of the room became oppressive and the
air offensive. Again and again Pearce was summoned
to shift the valetudinarian in his deep-cushioned tasy
chair. His gouty stool required moving ; Villiers left
it to be arranged by the servant. He wished to be
lifted round ; and another arm was required. Villiers,
when requested to assist, coldly complied, but without
any expression of thankfulness from his father or of
acknowledgment on his own part. He was evidently
treated as a slave. Again he was required to leave
his book to ring the bell, and Villiers became fretful.
The poodle nearly threw him down as he returned to
his seat ; and Villiers pushed it aside, and almost kicked
it, which drew a howl from the little ugly animal, and
the howl drew a violent coarse exclamation from the
impatient General. Villiers closed his book, and pre-
pared to leave the room ; but his father authoritatively
called him back. Villiers coldly pleaded an engage.
ment, and escaped. But he was overtaken at the top
of the stairs by Pearce, who delivered some bitter and
insulting message to him, which the artful messenger
took care should assume its full force of provocation,
and should sting Villiers more deeply by coming from
a servant. Villiers bade the man begone, and closing
the door violently behind him, issued into the street.
The hurried passionate step with which he paced
the long avenues of the royal garden, into which he
had entered as the first place of refuge, gave way by
degrees to more quiet and composure. The evening
was warm and calm ; all the stars above him seemed
to look down on him as if to soothe him with eyes of
peace and love. The hum of the city was dying away

and except the roll of an occasional carriage, few sounds
but the plashing of the sea disturbed the stillness. As
the cool air played upon his forehead, his resentment
sunk by degrees into that morbid state of self-pitying,
self-congratulating sensibility, in which, forgetting our
own faults, we consider ourselves the victims of the faults
of others, and, instead of rising up to battle with our
temptations, induige our vanity and indolence by con-
templating ourselves as interesting sufferers. If Villiers
could not realize his dreams of ambitious action, he
could find some gratification of his visions in this placid
and painless self-martyrdom. It soothed him, flattered
him, enabled him to dwell dangerously on the trials to
which he was exposed, and on his father's conduct, and
permitted still to lurk within him all his disrespectful
unfilial feelings of resentment and contempt, without
calling them out so prominently as to ensure their repro-
bation by his conscience. He sat down by the side of
the water, and as he gave himself up to the melancholy
luxuriousness of indolent sensibility, and felt the charm
of nature in calming his troubled thoughts, they fell, as
they often fell, into poetry. And he all but completed
a beautiful and pathetic sonnet, in which he described
his own broken spirit-weary, sick, helpless, hopeless.
the sport of idle thoughts, and chained to a sinful world;
while the spirit of Nature was invoked and blessed as
his mother, as his nurse, watching over him, notwith-
standing his follies and his faults, with tender pity,
soothing every pain, bearing every infirmity, and leading
him on with a mother's hand to a higher and nobler
state of being. It was a picture full of fascination.
Villiers contemplated it again and again. Again and
again a vague wild feeling of devotion rose up to the
spirit of Nature ; he gazed with a visionary eye upon
the stars above-with a mysterious sense of infinity and
power on the ocean before himwith tenderness and
sympathy even on the orange blossoms, which exhaled
odors on each side, as if they felt for his sorrows, and
delighted to minister to his relief. In the meanwhile
his father was calling for him to assist him to his bed.

But Villiers had forgotten the reality in the dream, as
persons often do who write poetry.
He found some perplexity and entanglement in ar-
ranging his last line, so as to express with sufficient
vividness the intensity of his feelings; and, as the night
was becoming cold, he rose to return home. The gates
of the gardens in which he had been lingering, had been
long closed, but he had been favored with a private key;
and as he passed along, and within the iron railings, to
the gate through which he was to obtain egress, he
observed two persons, one of whom resembled the
figure of Pearce, and the other was a young and seem-
ingly delicate female in the dress of a peasant, standing
on the pavement, and engaged in deep conversation.
As Villiers opened the gate, Pearce, whom he did not
recognize, had just seized the hand of his companion,
which seemed reluctantly yielded up to him, and he had
put it to his lips. But he was startled by hearing the
gate grate on its hinges ; and with a few hasty and
affectionate words, the two separated, The young girl,
as she passed Villiers, dropped a slight courtesy, as if
recognizing him ; and as the light of a lamp before an
image of the Virgin fell by accident (no, not by accident;
for things which in moments of indolence or sin lead us
into temptation, and end in misery, are not accidents) fell
by some mysterious overruling providence full on her
features ; and Villiers beheld a tender and pensive
face of exquisite beauty, which timidly glanced up at him
as he passed. He did not turn to look, for his niind was
one of singular delicacy in all that regarded woman.
But that face, once seen, was fixed before his eyes.
The sight had given to him a strange mysterious im.
pulse, which seemed to touch a hidden chord, and to
awake a new spring of life within him. He had never
been sensible of anything like it before. He dashed
his hand across his brow, and walked hastily on, but the
face was still before him. It came that night, and
looked upon him in his dreams, and his first thought on
waking fell on the same vision. The next afternoon the
carriage came to the General's door as usual ; the

General himself was lifted in ; the muff, the handkerchiet,
the snuff-box, the cane, the poodleall were deposited.
Pearce was at the door waiting to put up the steps ; the
General was feebly and querulously demanding where
Mr. Villiers was, that he might drive with him, and read
the newspaper to him, but no Villiers appeared ; his
servant only came to say that his master had an engage.
ment, and could not come. The angry General, in a
passion, ordered Pearce to lift him out again, and the
carriage was sent away; and the sick man was deprived
of his drive and fresh air, almost the only thing which
recruited and supported him during the day.
Half an hour afterwards, Villiers himself was floating
indolently in his boat, on the blue glad waters of the Bay
of Naples; and as he lay stretched at his ease in the
stern, with his Petrarch open before him, and his eyes half
shaded from the sun, the boatmen rowed him gently, as if
the very plashing of the oars disturbed his repose ; and
followed, as he bade them, the line of coast, entering into
every little bay, and bending round each ruin-crested
promontory, while Villiers gave himself up to his usual
luxury of dreaming. But this day his dreams were not
of empire ; empires had lost their charm. Solitude, re-
tirement, sympathising hearts, domestic affection, had
found their way into his thoughts. Nations he could
not find subjected to his will, and ready to be moulded
by his hand. But one human heart---pure, gentle, deli-
cate, and devoted, if such there were upon earth--might
still be his ; and he might lay one head upon his bosom,
to find there shelter and repose from the dangers of the
world. He might nerve his arm to fight battles, or to
endure toils, for the one weak and helpless being who
might look up to him as her only strength. And he
might find one mind docile, and susceptible, and unper-
verted by the cold maxims of a false refinement, to hang
upon his lips as the fountain of truth, and to image in
every thought and action the maxims which he could
teach her. Still he might be a sovereign. And as the
hoje flashed across him, he closed his Petrarch, laid his
head back upon the stern of the boat, and, as he closei}

his eyes, there came again before him that fair, anci
pensive, and exquisitely beautiful face, which had glanced
up at him on the night preceding, beneath the lamp of the
Virgin. He was roused by the sound of oars from an
approaching boat, a little fisherman's boat, apparently
returning from Naples. It neared them, rowed by a
single old man, but rowed vigorously and steadily; and
in the stern of the boat, amidst baskets of fruits, and
singing to her father, as he rowed, her hymn to the Virgin,
there sat (it was a strange coincidence, and coincidences
act as spells and charms upon the strongest mind) the
same figure, the same exquisitely beautiful face, which
he was striving to recall to his fancy. Villiers sprang
up, rubbed his eyes, watched the boat as it passed them,
and exchanged a greeting with his boatmen. And again
the beautiful face glanced up timidly, as if expecting
possibly a recognition from Villiers. And as the little
boat shot round a promontory and disappeared, Villiers
ordered his own boat to follow. It seemed a providence
-and a providence it was. But in the world are two
powers of providence ; and the good is discernible from
the evil only by the holy energies with which we strive
to turn accidents into virtues.
The boatmen were gaining rapidly on the little bark,
when Villers, as if recovering himself from a momen-
tary impulse, ordered them to stop. And affecting to be
busily engaged in disentangling and examining some
sea-weed, which had gathered round the rudder, (for
passion is full of craft, and even Villiers, proudly and
fiercely honest as he was, could not allow his boatmen to
see what was passing in his mind), he made them rest
on their oars until the little bark ran alongside a broken
flight of steps in the cliff. The old man moored it faste
took out his daughter in his arms, and with her basket
on her head, and still singing, she tripped lightly up the
steps, and entered a little cottage hung with a trellis-
work of vines, which stood on the verge of the precipice.
Villiers waited, still busily examining the sea-weed, but
finding nothing that he wanted. And when no one ap-
peared again at the door of the cottage, he gave the

signal for their return to Naples ; and as he returned,
the boatmen observed that he did not throw himself back
to dream with closed eyes in indolence, but sat up with
his head buried in his hands, thinking. He was en.
gaged to dine that day with the ambassador, to meet the
Duke of Newburgh and Prince Castel-a-Mare, and all the
rank and brilliancy of Naples. And Villiers sighed at
the burden which awaited him, and at the dulness, for-
mality, and heartlessness of high rank and fashionable
life ; and his fancy wandered off to a little cottage trel-
lised with vines, and a seat scooped out in the native
rock, from which he might gaze upon the blue sea and
the glorious sky, free and untrammelled, but not alone,
with one to whom he might himself give dignity and
honor, instead of receiving it from others. But the
dream was broken by the boat touching land, and the
first sight was the obsequious Pearce, with a face not
merely of feigned but sincere consternation (for his
schemes as well as his gains were at stake), who had
run down to the beach to inform him that his father had
been seized with an attack of paralysis. He had been
violently excited by Villiers's declining to drive with
him ; had indulged, Pearce took care to inform him, in
expressions which Villiers was obliged to command him
to desist from repeating, and in the midst became speech-
less.
Villiers soon stood by his father's bed-side, not with-
out remorse, yet still excusing himself. The physicians
were present, and all agreed that by avoiding any future
excitement, and with great care, the patient might re.
And Villiers no sooner heard it than the load
passed from his mind, and he found his fancy again wan.
dering off to the trellised cottage and the blue sea. One
year before, had any one told him that he could stand by
what might seem to be the death-bed of his father, and
that in that awful moment a single thought of self or
self-enjoyment could intrude upon him, he would have
spurned the charge with indignation : but admit self in
little things, and great things will not exclude it.

his usual habits; and with the usual habits came the
former temper, and with the former temper came Vil-
liers's former trial. And at first the shock and warning
which he had once received operated as such warnings
are designed to do. He bore with his father more pa-
tiently, if not more humbly, from the fear of bringing
upon himself more future remorse, if not from filial duty
and Christian affection. But the health of the
poor
old
man seemed at last quite re-established, the memory of
the sick-bed scene died away, Villiers's heart was full of
other things; it was possessed by a feeling--and pos-
sessed persons are not masters of themselves.
As the spring came on, he himself became an altered
Even his common acquaintance observed that his
eye was lighter and his step firmer--that life seemed to
have a charm, and time an objeet for him. He mixed
indeed in the general society of the place far less than
ever; but when he was induced to join a party, he was
cheerful, and even playful, instead of reserved and ab.
stracted. His pride and coldness seemed to be thawed
hy some better and happier influence. There was more
of natural dignity and command in his manner, as if he
was conscious of standing in relations and a position
which give to men individual consequence and character.
Even the Countess of Lurley stopped one day behind
the screen, as she came into her drawing-room, to ob.
serve him tte--tte with her little boy, playing with
him upon the carpet, and taking the child with fondness
to his arms, as it screamed out with delight at some little
frolic with which Villiers was amusing it.
" You !'' exclaimed the Countess, "you, whom we
are all so afraid of, playing with my child! What can
have happened to you ?" And the lady smiled signifi.
cantly. But Villiers faced the look calmly and steadily,
and only remarked, that persons when happy in them-
selves were generally fond of children ; and that he was,
he thanked God, very happy. And again the lady smiled
significantly; but Villiers shook his head; and he was
not a person whm even the gay and lively Countess
presumed to hanter

It' the servants of the General's establishment had
been examined on the subject of their young master's
change of feeling (and servants in general know more
than any other persons in the house, and, though treated
as unworthy of any respect, yet must be admitted, whe-
ther we like it or no, into our greatest secrets), they
would have brought together a number of little facts,
which they had themselves frequently put into a con-
jecture in the servants' hall, and might have constructed
from it a tale. The groom would have stated, that soon
after the General's illness Villiers had resumed his rides,
but the groom's attendance was dispensed with, and the
horse's head was always turned in one direction. His
master's daily ride, without variation, was along the
road which winds to the north, by the side of the bay;
and the groom also had remarked that the horse, Vil.
liers's favorite Mameluke, never bore marks of having
gone to any great distance. The cook would have com-
plained that now, when the old General was ordered to
dine early, and in his own room, her young master's late
dinner was again and again spoiled by waiting for him.
Frequently none was ordered, and when ordered little
was tasted.
He had also asked her to write out a re-
ceipt for some little delicacies, which she had often tasked
her skill to provide for him (for the servants all were
fond of their young master, though not a little afraid of
him,) on the pretext that he knew a friend who would
perhaps like to have them. The housekeeper, the good-
natured fat Mrs. Boucher, knew nothing that was going
on out of doors, but when bruised fruits and bad vege-
tables were brought into the kitchen, she never ceased
to wonder why her poor little Pauline did not make her
appearance again, with the finest melons and newest
eggs that ever came into the Naples market. And
when the name of Pauline was mentioned, the house-
maid would look significantly and resentfully at Mr.
Pearce, and Mr. Pearce would bite his lips and leave the
Pearce's manner, indeed, had undergone a great
alteration. He could seldom or ever obtain leave to
absent himself from the General's side. If he left the

room, the bell was rung instantly to recall him for some
trivial purpose, to pick up a book, or move a chair, or
what was more frequently the poor old man's real wish,
to amuse him with some of the Naples gossip, which,
partly forged and false, and partly collected from various
sources known only to himself, Pearce was always able
to retail, and to insinuate in the midst a variety of little
hints which it was his object to impress upon the old
man's mind. At last his master's confidence had
reached so far, that he was called on even to open and
read the letters which Pearce brought from the post.
And this advance was a great satisfaction to Pearce, for
it saved him some little trouble, and enabled him to bring
the letters direct from the post to his master, without de-
laying, as he had before been used to do, in his own
little room, with bolted doors, and the keyhole carefully
closed, before he made his appearance with the budget.
He was only surprised, just about this time, to find that
no more letters arrived for his young master; and op
inquiring at the post-office, he was informed that Mr
Villiers had given orders for them to be delivered to
none but himself.
It was about a month after the General's attack of
paralysis that Pearce obtained leave one evening to go
into the country. He was seen to take the road whic).
runs along the north side of the bay. And it was late
when he returned. As the footman opened the door fo:
him, he was surprised to see his face distorted with
passion, his eyes full of malignity, his lips almost blood
with the compression of his teeth. He went hastils
into his room. When the General rang for him ho
pleaded illness; and was heard by Villiers's man all the
night striding up and down the room, muttering inco.
herent exclamations of jealousy and revenge. He made
his appearance the next morning, ill-disguising, notwith.
standing his wonderful powers of self-concealment, the
passion under which he had spent the night. And there
was a fierceness and strangeness of manner in his mode
of addressing Villiers, which almost amounted to inso-
lence, and which Villiers, unconscious ; he was of

what was really passing within him, or of any can :e of
provocation given by himself
, was disposed to attribute
almost to incipient insanity, and desired his own man to
keep an eye upon him. This manner continued for some
days ; and during them Pearce was einployed, as often
as he could escape from the General's room (even to
whom he showed an impatience and violence of temper
which the old man could not understand,) in writing long
letters, which he took to the post-office himself; some
of them, as the clerk at the post-office observed, being
addressed to a female, and the others to persons at
Rome, Lyons, and England. especially to a town called
Hawkstone. Nor was he without receiving letters in
return ; and after perusing them in his own little room,
some he would carefully burn, picking up and destroying
every fragment which escaped the flames; and others
he locked up anxiously in a little box, which he depo-
sited in a corner of his room, under a loose plank in the
floor, over which he never forgot to draw a huge and
heavy bureau. By degrees his manner became more
calm and subdued; a change which he attributed, as he
told the General, to some favorite medicine which the
General had recommended him as an admirable specific
for the head-ache, which he pleaded as a cause for his
alt ed appearance. And the General was pleased and
flattered by his own success in working a cure.
Villiers also he resumed his usual deportment, was still
more assiduous and obliging, even made him an humble
apology for his former manner, and attributed it to indis-
position, a rush of blood to the head, to which he was
subject from a child, asked if he could get his letters
from the post as usual (which Villiers declined): and

CHAPTER XVI.
In the meanwhile Villiers, unconscious that he had
caused suffering to a single human being, was enjoying
what he had never before enjoyed in his life-happiness.
The vision which he had pictured to himselfthe vine-
trellised cottage, the seat scooped out from the living rock,
the gazing on the deep blue sea, the face, the exquisite
face of innocence and beauty, not yet indeed to lie upon
his bosom, but to look up into his eye with wonder and
all but adorationthe mind simple and docile, which he
might mould like was to take from him every stamp of
trththe one idolized object on which he might pour,
unchecked, the whole tide of his affections, -all this
some mysterious hand had realized for him; and earth to
him was now a heaven.
" Will he not come to-day, father ?" almost whispered
the poor Pauline, as one evening the old man and herself
had stood for more than an hour on the rock beneath the
cottage, watching for the approach of Villiers' little boat,
rowed now only by himself, " Will he not como to-day ?"
and she crept into her father's arms, and he felt her hot
tears stealing down her cheek.
My child," he replied, "my darling child ! even
these tears I am thankful for. Your happiness is too
great, and every pain mixed with it is like an expiation
for it. If you suffer as well as rejoice, your joy may yet
be lasting." And as he bent his reverend grey head
over her delicate neck, and gave her his blessing,
Pauline looked up fearfully but fondly to ask him with
her look why he should speak so sadly.
"My child," he continued, "I am old, and have seen
the world, and know what lies in human nature ; and
though now we are living lonely on this little nook of
rock, in better times I have served in armies, and walked

beingsand Providence permitted me to choose for you
the noblest and the best-I scarcely know that I could
fix on one to whom I could consign you for ever with so
much hope and so much joy, as this young Englishman."
And as he said this, he felt the poor girl's face laid closer
on his bosom, as if thankful and proud of his praise.
" But that such a lot," he continued, " should have fallen
upon you, so young, so poor, so destitute of all help'-he
corrected himself, and reverentially taking off his cap,
added" of all help but heaven, this is to me strange and
almost fearful. And I tremble lest so great a seeming
good should be only a temptation, and should end in evil.
And he lifted up her face, and looked gravely and steadily
into her eyes yet wet with tears. "My child, he is rich,
and you are poor ; he is young, and I am old. When I
die, and I shall soon die, will he still be to you all that I
have been ?" And Pauline shuddered, and once more
buried her face in his bosom.
" Have you told him ?" he continued, " all that he
ought to know ?"
Pauline faltered, " Yes."
"Everything !" asked the old man, searchingly.
And again she answered, " Yes. How, father, could
( help it ; how could I hide anything from himfrom
him who loves me so dearly ?"
And Pauline spoke the truth. Almost one of the first
questions which Villiers had put to her, when he dared
to do so, and felt that now their whole souls should be
open to each other, was the one so natural to a devoted
and therefore a jealous heart, and yet so hard to ask and
to answer : Was the hand now to be his own never
devoted to another ?" Villiers knew not how to frame it
-had hesitated-had asked it more by looks than words;
and Pauline understood it, rather by her own wish to
answer it than by his expressions. And though her
reverence for him was so great, that often, when he led
her to speak of herself, she would hide her face, and sit
beside him without the power of doing more than answer

and inquiring eye without shrinking for a moment, she
said to him, that there were things which she wished to
tell him, which he had a right to know, but that she could
do it only in writing. A pang struck to Villiers's heart.
He withdrew himself coldly and proudly from her side,
and walked from the seat where they were resting to
the edge of the cliff. It seemed as if the glory of his
vision was departing, and some rude hand had swept
the brightness from the blossom of his beautiful flower.
But he heard a sound as of a sob near him. And Pauline
stood a little way behind him, as not daring to approach,
her face covered with her hands, and the tears streaming
through her delicate fingers.
" You are angry with me," she said, faintly (and all
his fondness returned). You are angry with me for
not telling you at once. I will tell you nowthis mo-
ment--anything rather than that you should be angry.
I can bear anything but this ;" and she burst into a
flood of tears. "I know," she continued, taking her
hands from her face, " I know what you would ask me.
Never, never! O that you could look into my heart ?
Never till you came."
Villiers's heart leaped with joy. And he sprang for-
ward to catch her to his bosom ; but he checked himself,
for she was not yet his ; and with a superstitious reve-
rence he would not allow even his own affection to
presume on her exquisite delicacy. He thanked her,
and blessed her fervently.
Stop," she said, " you have not heard all; there
has been one who was kind and good to me-kinder than
I deserved. And my poor father is old, and soon will be
unable to work ; and he feared for me, if he should die
and I should be left alone. But when I told him
that I would rather die myself, he did not urge it. And

" You must never ask me," she said, " who it was, for
I could not tell it-no, not even to you ; and I know you
will not ask me.
And as she looked up firmly, and with unsuspecting
confidence, to demand his promise, Villiers gave it
readily, and kept it honorably.
" And now, my darling child," he said, " your father
is calling us. Let us go to him ; and I will read to you,
and you shall sing to me your own dear hymn."
" And you are not angry with me now," she said,
timidly. And as she caught his look of deep affection,
her heart bounded within her, and she sprang o like a
fawn to seek her father and find her lute.
Two years afterwards, Villiers was lying in a miser-
able stifling chamber, bound hand and foot, and his brain
on fire.
And in the midst of a paroxysm of raving, in
which even the stern, sturdy men who were placed to
guard him could scarcely prevent him from bursting his
bands, the voice of some poor singer in the street, led
there as by a pitying angel, commenced the same simple
strain. Villiers caught it, and strove to sit up upon his
low pallet. His eye gazed wonderingly around him ;
and, as the simple music still fell on his car, tears began
to flow ; and visions, far other than those which had
nursed his phrensy, came gently on him.

them both on the smooth, swelling waters at evening,
just as the moonlight began to ripple on the sea ; and a
fairy, gentle voice was singing the same sweet hymn.
And then they were both tending together a sick bed in
a vine-trellised cottage, watching over the patient suffer-
ings, soothing every pain, bearing with every infirmity of
a dying fatherPauline's father, not his own. The
scene changed, and there was a holy chapel-a holy

gratefully to heaven, and blessing God that now he
could depart in peace. But the music ceased--another
thought came upon Villiers ; and with a shuddering
groan he sprang up in agony, and called wildly for his
child ; and the keeper sternly bade him lie still, and not
make a noise.
While these delicious moments, so bright and so
soothing, even when recalled in dreams, and gone for
ever, were gliding on, where was the aged, miserable,

Villiers again, by a good providence (as if a good provi.
dence ever administered to us pleasure, except that it
may nerve us to duties), the General, instead of wishing
for his son's presence, expressed more openly his aver-
sion to him, and frequently passed whole days in his
own room without seeing him. Pearce was acquiring,
every hour, more influence over himwas becoming
more necessary to his comfort ; and from suggesting ad.
vice, and hinting opinions, he had now assumed the
right of dictating to his master. And his master faintly
and timidly succumbed to all that he proposed. Some
thing in this beyond the mere art of ruling, which Pearce
had so deeply studied, might have been discovered by
one who knew all that passed in the long confinement
of the old man's room, to which Pearce unmurmuringly
devoted himself. He felt that it could not last long, and
the gradual approach of success in his grand object
encouraged him to discharge the most wearying and
even offensive offices, without exhibiting more impatience
than was necessary to keep the old man, as he called his
master, in proper order.

particulars. And among all the various arts which he
employed to obtain the knowledge of this important
secret, in conformity with the leading principle and policy
of the religious school in which he had been brought up,
none bad succeeded in throwing clear light upon the
subject, until one day's post, among a number of letters,
brought one written in a coarse, vulgar hand, and
marked prirale. On this occasion Pearce did not pro-
ceed, as visual, direct to his master's room. He retired
first to his own, and there, with bolted door and the key-
hole carefully closed, he found little difficulty in mastering
the secret. He had been employed before in a foreign
post-office, and had there learned much, which he found
eminently useful to him in after-times. As he placed the
packet of letters, as usual, on the little table by the Gen-
eral's easy chair, where he sat propped up with pillows,
his thin, peaked, wrinkled features, peering malignantly
from a large fur cap, and his legs wrapped carefully in
blankets, Pearce retired where he could command a view
of what passed, in a large mirror, without being supposed
to watch him. He saw the thin bony fingers, almost like
claws, of the old man, stretched out to grasp the letters,
which he could scarcely hold. The spectacles were
shifted, and Pearce himself was called to wipe them.
The letters once more were feebly taken, and laid one
by one aside, as the old man scrutinized the post-mark,
till he came to the one marked private. His pale face
became of an ashy hue ; his hand shook violently ; and
casting a cowardly side glance at his obsequious servant,
to see if he was looking, he thrust the letter under the
folds of the blanket. Pearce waited in vain to be asked
to open and read the letters as usual. He then proposed
it himself; but the unhappy old man, in a trembling
husky voice, told him he might go and leave him, for
that he wanted to sleep His bell rang again for Pearce,
about an hour after ; his countenance had then resumed
its ordinary look, and Pearce observed nothing, but that
he must have moved from his chair himself (an exertion
which he had been incapable of making for weeks),

the grate. The look of exultation which Pearce cast
upon his prey, now completely in his hands, was even
heightened, as the old man asked for his son, and Pearce
could inform him that he had been absent fer several
days, and (as he took care to add, maliciously,) that he
was seldom at home now, since the General had become
No one knew where he went to.
This was a falsehood, for this secret also Pearce had
long penetrated. It was a spot wbich he himself had
known-respecting which he had himself indulged
dreams and visionsco-visions far different from Villiers's,
but which never occurred to his mind without filling
him with the spirit of revenge and jealousy almost to
madness.
On that day he said nothing more. Two days after
he was summoned to read a letter from the General's
lawyer, alluding to a power reserved to the General in
some marriage settlement, of leaving his property to
another branch of the family. And Pearce took care
to sigh. And when the General fretfully asked him
the meaning of his sigh, he hesitated, and at last was
compelled reluctantly to lament that Mr. Villiers did not
show as much respect and affection for his father as
became a young man, heir to such an estate. Another
night the General's rest was broken by a ringing of bells
and disturbance in the house, and Pearce took care to in-
form him that it was caused by his son, who constantly
came in late. Another time he went still farther; and
appearing with a face of astonishment and reserre, as if
possessed of some melancholy secret, which he was
resolved to hint, but not to disclose, he permitted the
General to extort from him a confession that there were
sad stories about Mr. Villiers, and he feared he was
going on ill. And a few words were enough to suggest
all that he wished to the old man, whose mind with readi.
ness suspected in others all that he had been guilty of
himself. With vice, indeed, even in his son, he could
readily have borne ; he would have admitted it as a
matter of course ; but when l'earce hinted at something
else, at the possibility of h's son abandoning himself

to an infatuation, as he called it, and throwing himself
away for lite in a degrading connexion, he touched a
chord in the old man's mind which lay entwined with all
his favorite schemes, and awoke his most violent passions.
Mean and paltry as his usual habits were, since from the
extravagances of a luxurious youth he had become calcu.
lating and selfish, he had formed and cherished for years
one plan having a show of dignity--the marriage of his
son with his cousin, Lady Eleanor, and the reunion of
the old family estates of Claremont and the Priory.
We all know how deeply an idea once admitted, and
allowed to shoot out into fancies and dreams, in the mor-
bid indolence of a sick room, or an unoccupied old age,
will take possession of the whole man. To touch this,
to hint a doubt of the possibility of realizing it, was to
throw the General into a violent outbreak of temper.
This had been one of the most embittering subjects on
which he had harped to his son, till even the natural
inclination which Villiers might have felt towards the
project gue way beneath the tormenting and overbearing
indelicacy in which his father dwelt upon it. And in his
heart of hearts he had resolved that no such mercenary
thoughts should ever be connected with that marriage tie,
which, whenever and to whomsoever it should bind him,
he recognized as most sacred and most ennobling. On
the same subject Pearce himself, thoroughly master of
his tactics, had at first indulged his master in assisting
his fancy, and joining in his calculations. And now, as
if seizing on every opportunity to exasperate the poor
enfeebled man, on this he artfully touched each day, con-
triving to separate the two objects, and to present to the
General's mind the possibility of realizing one if not the
other ; and if he could not effect the marriage through
his son's wilfulness, at least of uniting the estates.
There was one difficulty, one prejudice, as Pearce well
knew, most difficult to surmount : Lady Eleanor was a
Roman Catholic ; and though the old man, careless of
religion, could have borne to see her united with his son
for the purpose of uniting the estates in the person of his
own heir, he was not yet prepared to throw his own

property into the hands of a Papist. His prejudices
against Popery were strong and vulgar, of its really
deadly and destructive nature he knew nothing. But he
disliked it-disliked it the more from the vexation which
his union with Lady Esther had brought on him; and

and covered with the huge bureau, in Pearce's little
room, and could then have perused the letters, which,
with the Roman postmark upon them, he had received
from time to tinie, we might have obtained a deeper
insight into the springs and objects of his conduct. But
whatever caution and slowness he had originally shown,
his success became more and more apparent each day.
The poor old man was soon entirely at his disposal.
A hint dexterously thrown in one day, and accompanied
with one of those significant looks which Pearce could so
well assume, revealed to the terrified General that the
secret, which he thought was buried in his own bosom
now, and would be buried for ever in his grave, was
known also to another person, and that person his servant,
In vain he endeavored to persuade himself that his con-
science had taken alarm too quicklythat Pearce's
words meant nothing. Pearce understood it all, and
contrived without delay to repeat the hint, dropping also
a little circumstance, which removed all doubt. Farther
he did not go. He never threatened, or presumed upon
his possession of this knowledge ; though the General
would have purchased his silence by any humiliation.
His attentions were redoubled ; his manner still more
obliging than ever. And the General became bound to
him, and ready to comply with all his suggestions, far
more than any menaces or violence could have made
bim. It suited, however, Pearce's purpose, cautiously to
open the subject of religion. With a most artful and
delicate hand he contrived to touch even the seared and
hardened conscience of his victim by fear. He himself
affected and exhibited a devotional spirit. At times he

tale of superstition, some thoughts which awakened in the
unhappy man fears of a future state, and longings for
more safety in the prospect to which he was con pelled
to look forward. Pearce dwelt with energy and fluency
peace and comfort of his own mind, relieved from
all the burden of past sins by the absolution of his priest,
and secure in the intercession of the Saints. The old
man listened, and wondered at the new tone of his
servant, now almost become his companion ; but the
ideas were not lost. They came home to him more and

peace and comfort which were insured to all who were

signs of change. And the noises became more frequent,

ions, who could scarcely get off their horses to put down
the steps, Villiers sprang out of it, baggard, pallid, and
in the deepest mourning. lle tottered as he entered the
house, and caught sight of the face of a servant, full of
that mysterious gloominess and forced sympathy which
is worn by domestics when death is approaching, or has
already fallen upon a family. The servant opened
gently the door of the saloon ; but Villiers made an
effort to pass by, and proceed at once to his father's bed-
room. But the servant detained him. " Persons wero
with him," he said. And when Villiers asked if there
was any hope, the man shook his head. He would
have asked if the last awful moment was close at hand :
but there is a strange and awful feeling which it is no
superstition to observe and realise when death is near
us, a stillness and creeping of the flesh, we know not
how, which told Villiers that his father was now lying
in his last agonies. The servant left, promising to
come back the moment Villiers could be admitted into
the sick room; and Villiers knelt down, overpowered
with awe, and in that awe almost forgetting his own
misery. But a smothered cry of great agony and terror
from the adjoining chamber struck upon him; and he
could bear the delay no longer. The next moment he
was in his father's bed-room. The curtains of the bed
were open ; by the bed side stood the nurse and Pearce ;
and two priests, habited in their vestments, were pre-
paring to administer the rite of extreme unction. But
it was too late ; Villiers glanced upon the bed, and saw
that all was over. The ghastly features, the convulsed
mouth, the eyes still staring, the hands clutched fiercely
on the bed-clothes, the hair standing on end Villiers
saw it all, and sank again upon his knees in intense
agony; for now, when it was too late, he asked himself
if this might not have been averted.
He was roused from a stupor by the necessity of re-
moving from the room. And as he was passing to his
own apartment which he had occupied before, Pearce
came up to him, and insolently ordered the servant to
prepare a bed for him in the north room. The servant

looked at him, scarcely knowing what he said, and was
persuaded by the old housekeeper to retire and lie down,
though not in sleep.
Sleep, indeed, except in rare and feverish fits, had
not visited him for weeks. The moment he closed his
eyes there came before him that one vision, that pensive,
delicate, exquisitely beautiful face, which had haunted
him so blissfully ever since its first appearance.
But
only once or twice did it appear in all its beauty, radiant
as when he first called her his own, or calm
in the pensive enjoyment of deepest happiness, as when
he sat by her side on that seat of rock, and taught her
lessons of goodness from his own manly, upright heart.
These were the appearances which he dreaded most ;
and by a secret instinct, whenever they approached, he
started from his broken slumber, not daring to face the
agony which would await him on awaking More fre-
quently the vision came in a very different guise ; but
Villiers could bear it better, for there was no deceit in
it, no frightful revulsion from the dream to the reality.
It came pale, and wan, and feeble, but still beautiful ;
sometimes attired as one who, sickening under a fatal
disease, was still able to be removed from her bed, and
propped up with pillows to breathe fresher air ; some-
times with a sleeping child lying in her bosom ;-then
with a few sweet flowers strewed upon her forehead, the
lips motionless, the eyes closed, the head enveloped in its
grave-clothes. But to-night it came in a form more
fearful. The delicate beautiful face came, indeed, and
looked upon him as before, but it changed suddenly into
the horrible and ghastly figure which he had witnessed
on his father's death-bed. It seemed to utter on him
fearful reproaches; to imprecate a curse upon himself
and on his children, with the same voice with which
his father had bade him depart, in the last words which

he bad spoken to him while alive. The eyes glared
frightfully upon him ; claws were stretched out to seize
him ; a cry--the cry of agony which had pierced him
to the heart from his father's room-once more rang in
his ears; and shaking from head to foot, the big drops
standing on his forehead, his heart beating with terror,
and his breath gasping, he struggled out of his sleep and
looked wildly round him.
A clock was ticking on the mantel-piece, and a few
lickering gleams struggled from the dying embers on the
hearth. He sat up on the bed, and, breathing more
freely, attempted, not to sleep again--for this he dared
not do--but to pray for forgiveness for the neglect, the
undutifulness, the harsh, unforgiving spirit, which, as a
son, he had shown to his now miserable father--for the
self-indulgence in which he had abandoned him to the
artifices of a menialfor the proud unbending temper
with which he had kept aloof from him ever since he
had left Rome, receiving no letters except a rare state-
ment of his father's health from a physician; and re-
solved on making no overtures for a reconciliation, lest
he should be supposed to be actuated by mercenary policy.
At the time all this had appeared to him innocent, even
high-minded and just. Now he knew that it was sin ;
and sin the beginning of all othersthe dishonoring of
parents, even of parents who are sinful themselves. And
then for the first time it struck him that the judgments
of God are just. He had forsaken his father for a de.
vice of his own heart, and a desire of his own eyes ;
and the desire of his eyes had been taken from him.
The punishment had fallen just when the sin was con-
summated. And he who had left his father alone in the
world, to sink into his grave in the arms of hirelings,
and with no consolation but the delusions of an anodyne
for a guilty conscience, purchased by an act of apostacy,
and after all snatched from him at the last, was now
himself left alone in the world, stripped of his dreams,
his hopes, his affectionslike a wreck abandoned by its
crew, and tossed idly on the waters.

cause it revealed a duty as well as an enjoyment-stole on
him when he remembered that, widower as he was, he was
still a parent.
And as the fondness of the father awoke in
him a train of softer feelings, the tears coursed each other
down his cheek. He rose, threw his dressing-gown around
him, and, opening his writing-case, among papers which he
never left behind him, and which were carefully labelled
and concealed in a secret drawer, he sought for a miniature,
delicately finished, over which he hung in silence, recal.
ling all the scenes with which it was associated, ---the light
step,--the look of pensive sweetness, varying with each
thrill of affection into deep devotion for himself,the
delights of those hours when he had hung over her as she
sang, or when she had seated herself at his feet, looking
up archly but docilely to hear what he would read or
teach her,--the thousand little acts of love with which she
had solaced the last days of her venerable father (for
she, thought Villiers, with a pang, never despised and
never neglected the author of her being),---the simple
look of wonder with which she had listened to his ques-
tion, when he told her that perhaps poverty might be
their lot ; and would she still love him ?--and then the
lingering illness, the patient suffering, the tears for him
alone, the prayers over the head of her child, the fervor
with which she commended it to him, with her memory
as its safeguard--all these recollections stole out one
by one like stars upon an evening sky, till he seemed
once more to be living in the midst of the realities,
to have an object and a being still before him, whose
presence would rule his life and elevate his thoughts-
whom he might almost adore now, even as he adored her
when living. And his heart, once touched with this
emotion, passed on to a higher region, and to the only
Being who is present always, and can elevate and sanctify
the soul, and whom the heart of man may indeed adore.
He knelt down, and prayed earnestly, not only for
forgiveness of past sins, but for strength to bear their
punishment, and to atone for them, as far as men may
atone, by humility and dutiful obedience for ever after.
He prayed also for a reunion with her whom he had

he felt that it was an object which might absorb him
wholly, and be to him his happiness and life.
He was still kneeling, with his face upturned to
heaven, and the lamp which he had lighted had flickered
and died away in the socket, leaving only the gleam
from the ashes of the wood fire, when he heard a slight
noise in a distant corner of the room, and looking up,
observed a thin streak of slight stealing on the wall. At

behind which it appeared visibly moved. At another
time Villiers would have advanced without a fear to
examine the cause.
But all that he had suffered and
witnessed--the thought of what was lying at that mo-
ment beneath the same roof-the recollections which had
so long haunted himnow chilled him with a superstitious
awe. He remained motionless, and hidden by the huge
chair before which he was kneeling, with his eyes fixed
on the increasing glimmer of light. An exclamation
almost escaped him as the curtain was slowly withdrawn,
and a human face peered out from behind it. It looked
round cautiously--advanced--the whole figure appeared,
and Villiers saw that it was Pearce. His eye glanced
first upon the open writing-case and the packet of papers,
as if he would willingly have seized upon them. Then,
furtively looking around the room, he stole to the bed
side, and, gently peeping through the curtains, started
back, and almost stumbled and fell, as Villiers sprang
up from his kneeling posture, and demanded what he
wanted. An ordinary person would have required
some liitle time to recover from such a shock ; but
Pearce, in emergencies of the kind, was not an or-
dinary person. Prepared and composed in a minute,
he answered that he had heard Villiers moving ; was
afraid that he was ill; had come to see if he could
be of any service. Villiers eyed him with some sus
picion. But Pearce still preserved the same
posure, And on Villiers assuring him that nothing was

the matter, Pearce begged his pardon, and retired through
the regular entrance. Villiers did not return to his bed
till he had examined the passage
behind the
neavy
tapestry curtain, and finding a secret door in the wainscot
communicating with a narrow staircase, he contrived to
block it up with some furniture. But it was daylight
before he was able again to close his eyes.
It was late the next morning before any one would
venture to approach Villiers's room. His bell had not
rung. And it was only the good-natured housekeeper,
Mrs. Boucher, who had courage at last to take him some
breakfast without his asking for it. She found him
dressed ; but so pale, so thin, so thoroughly wretched in
appearance, that the poor woman, after placing the tray
on the table, could not refrain from sittting down in
a chair ; and, hiding her face in her apron, she burst
into tears.
"Oh, sir! Oh, master Ernest !" she cried as she
sobbed violently, " if you had but been here, this would
not have beenif you had but answered the letters !"
Villiers himself was leaning his face upon the mantel-
piece, and the tears streaming down his cheeks. But at
the mention of letters he raised himself up to ask " What
letters ?"
"Ours, sir," said Mrs. Boucher, " which we, that is I
and the butler, made bold to write to you, to tell you
what
was doing."
Villiers had never received any. " I had," he said,
"but one or two letters from here, and they came from
Signor Villetti, the doctor; and they all told me things
were going on well, till I heard from Mr. Beattie, and
then I came here immediately."
The poor housekeeper seemed amazed.
sir," she said, " there has been some foul play, and that
Italian doctor ought never to have been brought here.
It was not we who sent for him, but that manI suppose
we must call him Mr. Pearce now. And the General,
poor man, would never hear of any one else."
And the ice once broken, the motherly, loquacions

had passed in his absence ; how they had been ordered
suddenly to Rome, no one knew why ; but Pearce had
pretended some advice from the doctors ; how, when they
reached Rome, no visitors were admitted but one or
two Englishmen, whom the servants had not seen before,
and, by degrees, a priest from one of the colleges ; how
Pearce had contrived to take the whole management
of affairs upon himself, carefully excluding the servants
from even seeing their master, except when they caught
sight of him as Pearce assisted him down the stairs
to take his usual drive; how, more than once, Pearce
had brought with him a sort of lawyer, and Mrs. Boucher,
on passing the door of her master's room, as it stood
ajar, had seen him with a pen in his hand, and Pearce
standing by to guide it as he signed a paper ;--and then
came complaints of Pearce's increased arrogance and
domineering habits, which none of the other servants
could endure,-just, Mrs. Boucher said, as if he was
master of the house, "Oh, sir !" she concluded, "I
am afraid there has been foul play, and you will find things
very bad."
Villiers scarcely entered into the latter part of the
sentence, but the former struck him to the heart. And
he asked to what she alluded. Upon which Mrs.
Boucher proceeded to enumerate many little facts. As
she passed the General's door one day, she had heard
high words between Pearce and his master ; and when
the General wanted to drive one way, Pearce would
order the carriage to drive another. And the old man
was not allowed to see any of his old friends ; and the
doctor, Signor Villetti, would prohibit him from having
things to eat and drink which he used to be fond of.
"And then, sir," she continued, sinking her voice to a
whisper, and looking anxiously round the room,
day, as I was going up stairs, and Mr. Pearce had gone
out, I was standing just by his door ; , and what should I
see, to my wonder, but the door softly open, and your
poor father himself looked out. It was in this very room
which Mr. Pearce had put him into. And he made
nie come in. He could hardly walk ; and there he sat

me
in that arm-chair ; and there was nothing about him
comfortable, no book or any thing ; and they had taken
away his dog Fido, sir, that you remembera little
ugly thing it was, and always getting in the way. I
remember one night it nearly thre
vn the stairs.
It was the night we got to Rome ; I was coming up
stairs in the dark." And where Mrs. Boucher's remi.
niscences would have carried her no one could have
prophesied. But Villiers recalled her to his father. "Oh,
sir ! I was going to tell you what he told me, and what
I got the butler to write off by that night's post. I
would have written myself, sir, only my handwriting is
bad. And yet I had some good schooling, and my father
was in very comfortable circumstances, and brought me
up well. I used to go to school at the Park-gate-
old Mrs. Bond's, close by the great elm near the Priory
ruins.
And once more Villiers impatiently recalled her.
Mrs. Boucher begged pardon, and at last Villiers learned
from her that the General had complained to her of ill.
treatment ; had said that he was very much afraid of
Pearce ; that Pearce had become a tyrant, and he could
bear it no longer. Only when Mrs. Boucher had proposed
that he should be sent away, the unhappy man turned
pale, and said "No, that could not be." And then the
good woman had ventured to say something about Mr.
Ernest, and that he ought to be sent for. And the Gen-
eral had sremed sad and downcast; and complained that
every one had deserted himthat even his son would
not come near to him. And Mrs. Boucher added, " He
seemed to speak, sir, as if he would have given a great
deal to see you.
And I do think he loved you, sir, though
he was rather hasty at times. But then sons ought
to bear with their father ; I am sure I did with my poor
old mother, who was bed-stricken for years."
Villiers groaned aloud, and shuddered, as he still
stood with his face covered with his hands, and resting on
the mantel-piece. He lifted it after a pause, during
which Mrs. Boucher sat with her hands folded in her
black s'lk apron, and asked her if  he dared not name

his father ; and checked himself to say, " Had there been
much suffering !"
Mrs. Boucher shook her head mournfully, and once
more proceeded. " He had been much disturbed at
nights. A servant, who slept over-head, had often been
kept awake by his groaning ; and there were sometimes
hard words from Pearce, as if he were threatening in-
stead of comforting him. One night he had been taken
very ill, and Mrs. Boucher had been summoned to assist.
It was a long time before the doctor came, and Mr.
Pearce, who seemed extremely impatient for his arrival,
had left the room to hasten the messenger.
" And then," continued Mrs. Boucher, "as the poor
old gentleman looked up, and only saw the other nurse
in the room, he made signs to me to send her away,
which I did; and then, though he could scarcely move,
he put his hands so-together, and shook his head. It
was the most piteous sight I ever saw. He was so pale
and thin, and his hair quite white. And then he made
signs to me to give him his keys, which I did, and he
pointed out one, and making me lay my ear almost
down to his lips, he whispered, "When I am gone,
give this to himyou know whom I mean. He has not
been kind; but I won't be hard to him : let them do
what they choose." And just then Mr. Pearce came
back, and was quite angry that I had been in the room
alone. He took up the keys, as they lay on the bed,
and I never saw them since. Hark, sir ! there is some
one at the door."
The knock was repeated, and Mrs. Boucher bustled
up to make way for Pearce himself, and another person,
seemingly a notary. It was with a face of almost sav-
age exultation, scarcely intended to be stifled, that Pearce
announced to Villiers that he was come to seal up some
drawers. Villiers himself, almost forgetful as he had
been of any other circumstance, in the thought of his
father, was now aroused to demand by what right he
entered on this office. And nothing further was needed
to induce Pearce to enter at once on the real object of
his intrusion; and desiring his companion to open a

a
black portfolio, he placed before Villiers a formal docu-
ment, which he requested him to read. Villiers did read
it-read it with his eyes almost blinded with tears, for
he saw his father's signature, shaken and abrupt, as of
person in the extremity of illness. It was formal,
however, correct, without a flaw, duly signed, and wit-
nessed. Villiers knew nothing of law, but, to all ap-
pearance, it assured him that the menance held out by
his father had been fulfilled, and that he was a beggar.
All that could be left away was given to the Jesuits'
College at Rome, with the exception of a large legacy
to Pearce. The landed property was given to Lady
Eleanor, and Villiers himself not mentioned. He was
a beggar; and the effect was, for the moment, stunning.
That which for months he had thought of, and spoken of
as possible, was realized ; but reality is a very different
thing from imagination and he found it so.
It required, however, but little time for him to re
cover himself sufficiently to return the document, and to
request that he might be left alone, and not subjected to
intrusion upon questions of business at such a moinent;
and Pearce retired, taking care, as he looked him in the
face, to lift up a mass of hair from his own forehead, and
to exhibit a scar, which had been there ever since the
evening when Villiers had last left his father's house at
Naples.
It was a dreary and fearful interval which ensued
between that hour and the day when his father's remains
were deposited in the grave, according to the rites of the
Romish Church. One person only was admitted to him
-Beattie, who was still at Rome, in recovered health,
and to whose judgment Villiers willingly committed the
task of making the necessary inquiries into the validity
of the will. There were moments of stupor, of amaze.

times came a conflict between his conscience and his
suffering. Angry thoughts would rise ; the recollection
of past ill-treatment; efforts to excuse himself; then
recollections of his own joys, and his own sorrows ; then
he was once more sitting on the rocky seat, or under the
shade of the vine-trellised cottage, till he started up to
find himself in his dark, dreary chamber. Once, only,
the vision returned to him again, and again bringing
something like peace--the vision of his motherless child,
and the thought that there was still a centre round which
his affections might gather-a being for whom he might
toil, though in poverty and pain--who might look up to
him, and love him, and cling to him, and cherish him
when he was old and in sickness. But here a pang
shot across him ; for what hope could he have of merit.
ing that filial duty towards himself, which he had him-
self denied to his own parent ? Every thing ended in
remorse ; and even remorse was sweet, for it was real,
and true; it bore on it no delusion. And as he bowed
himself to the ground, and prayed, Villiers began to feel
what religion is; he felt it in its first beginning-sorrow
and shame.
He left his room but once. It was after
every
in the house had gone to bed; and even the nurses, who
were sitting in the chamber of the dead, were appalled
when they marked the agony in his countenance, as he
opened the door and motioned them to withdraw. They
listened at the outside, and heard him draw the bolt and
prostrate himself on the ground, and then all was silent ;
only at times a suppressed groan reached them: but
they dared not enter. And the cold grey dawn strug-
gled in through the curtained windows before he opened
the door and returned to his own room. But from that
night Villiers was an altered man. Even Beattie was
surprised to see the calmness and self-control, the almost
childlike gentleness with which he did and suffered all
that was necessary in the distressing scenes through
which he was obliged to pass. He made only one re
questthat Pearce might be prevented from coming
near him. Every thing else, which, in a former day,

would have galled and stung him to the quick, he now
submitted to patiently and meekly, as under punishment
a punishment which he recognised as just. He re.
quested only a single alteration in the arrangement of
the funeral ; but it was intended to express more respect
and honor for the dead. And during the last melan-
choly ceremonial, except the strong and almost convul.
sive grasp with which he kept his hand within his bo.
som, clasped on that which Beattie knew to be a little
golden cross, Beattie himself would have observed little
in his manner but quiet resignation and sorrow. Vil-
liers, even in his youth, was no friend to scenes and ex-
hibitions of emotion.
The second evening after all was over he was sit-
ting alone in Beattie's room, reading--reading, because
he was expecting every moment that Beattie would re.
turn and bring him information of the circumstances re-
lating to the will. Not indeed that this had ever formed
a prominent feature in the bitter thoughts which forced
themselves on him ; but when at times an almost Quix
otic feeling of contempt for wealth, and insensibility to
his worldly position, had obtruded themselves, the thought
of his child came across himof his duty to others-
and of the necessity for ascertaining and enforcing right
wherever it seemed to have been violated. And he ad.
mitted with Beattie the obligation of obtaining sufficient
information as to the validity of the document. As
Beattie's step was heard coming up the stairs, a slight
pulsation of the heart revealed to Villiers that his com-
posure was not entire indifference ; but it ceased the
moment he caught sight of his friend's face, and saw in
it that the case was hopeless. Nothing, Beattie ex-
plained to him, could be more correct or formal than the
will. He had indeed made inquiries of the servants ;
and from them had ascertained much which Mrs. Bou-
cher had stated to Villiers himself, and which awakened
no little suspicion of unfair influence having been em.
ployed to obtain the present distribution of the property.
Hesitatingly and carefully watching the effect of the sug.
gestion on Villiers's countenance, Beattie added that liti-

gation might be possible ; but Villiers shook his head
reluctantly. And Beattie then added that he had sug.
gested the possibility of this to the parties now interested
in the will, and had not hesitated to express an opinion
that it might be overturned; but he had been met by a
threata threat of disclosures most painfully affecting
the poor General's character; and Villiers impatiently
stopped him, exclaiming, "Never! never!"
He sat down without delay to write two letters,
one to Lord Claremont, to inform him that he had no
intention of endeavoring to disturb the will, and ma-
king one request which he knew would be granted, that
he might be allowed to possess the picture of his mother
which hung in her bedchamber at the Priory. The
other letter was to his uncle in Yorkshire, an old, pen-
urious, singular character, who possessed, however, some
parliamentary interest, and being himself unmarried, had
often shown symptoms of attachment to his nephew,
even to the extent of contemplating him as the heir of
bis property. Villiers asked of him nothing but to ob-
tain some situation or commission in the army, which
might enable him to support himself. And the letters
sealed, he took leave of Beattie for the night, promising
to see him the next day before he left Rome for Naples,
to make the necessary arrangements for placing his child
in some fit and eligible care.
CHAPTER XVIII.
It was not, perhaps, till his arrival in his own room at
the hotel, that Villiers for the first time in his life felt
what poverty was. He was to part with his servant.
And as his servant took his wages, and a donation far
beyond what he might have expected, Villiers was pleased
with the honest hearty way in which the man thanked
him, as having always been a kind and good master

227
He had tasted scarcely anything that day, and his spirit
having returned with the removal of suspense and the
necessity of exertion, he would have asked for something
to eat, but the thought came to him of his child, and of
the necessity of depriving himelf of comforts for the sake
of that dear being, and he checked the order which he
had been on the point of giving. His servant insisted
on remaining to pack his trunks ; and Villiers, who had
been nurtured in habits which made him peculiarly
sensitive to the distinctions of rank, and to the refine-
ments of life, once more felt the reality of his altered
position when he gave orders that his portmanteau should
be carried to the place from which the vehicle of a
courier, with whom he had engaged a place, was to start
the next morning. He was young, and still amenable
to false shame; and as, accidentally, he met an English
acquaintance just as he was mounting the vehicle, and
noticed the curiosity and hauteur with which his friend's
glass was levelled at him, and the cold bow (his circum-
stances being known) with which his own distant
recognition was returned, a momentary chill, followed by
indignation, came over him at the thought of the heart-
less world with which he was now to grapple ; but it
was momentary only. Once more he remembered that
he had been sinful, and was under punishment, and his
equanimity returned.
Side by side with his humbler companion, on whom
but a short time before Villiers would have looked, not
indeed with contempt, but with something of wonder and
curiosity, as a being of a different species (for Villiers
had been nurtured in some of the worst habits of an ex-
clusive English aristocracy), now he exchanged the little
courtesies of fellow-travellers, and, notwithstanding the
oppression on his spirits, endeavored to ask him ques.
tions, and even to take an interest in the willingness with
which the honest and sensible man opened to him his
ideas and history, till he came to explain that he had
engaged in a life which he did not like, and had sacri.
ficed much that he enjoyed, even postponing a marriage
with a young person to whom he was engaged, and

SO
all to enable him to support an aged father, who had
lost everything by imprudence. But as he came to this
part of his tale he observed that Villiers had buried liin.
self in his cloak, and was sitting with his eyes closed
and his brows knit, as if in great pain ; and with a tact
not uncommon even to uncultivated minds which are
familiar with the world, he contrived to stop, and, as the
vehicle was mounting a hill, to jump down and walk by
the side, leaving his companion to his thoughts; and
those thoughts were, as if at every step an eye were
opening and a tongue were planted in every mouth, to
witness and proclaim one crying sin to a remorseful
heart. Just as the vehicle reached the top of the road
which crosses the Monte Albano, and Giuseppe, the
courier, was about to jump into it again, a light calash
drove rapidly round the corner behind them, and nearly
grazing the wheels of the other carriage, galloped on, as
if in great anxiety to reach the next stage before them.
Villiers himself had scarcely noticed it, he was
plunged in thought. But Giuseppe made some remark
on the speed with which the horses were going, and
also on the sinister looks of a single traveller, who had
ensconced himself in the corner, and, as he passed Vil-
Tiers's vehicle, had thrown a large red handkerchief
over his face, which Giuseppe had only been enabled
to see by observing it peering from the glass behind,
as if unwilling to be recognised, and yet anxious to observe.
"I never knew," he muttered to himself, as he once
more seated himself by Villiers's side, "I never knew
any good connected with such quick travelling ; there
is always some mischief before or behind." But Vil-
liers made no reply. And the rest of the journey was
spent in silence. Giuseppe understood that his com-
panion was in distress and sorrow ; and respectfully
forbore to intrude on him, except by little attentions,
which Villiers noticed with kindness, and which left upon
his mind the valuable lesson for after-life-that no class
is so humble in which courtesy and benevolence, and
even delicacy of feeling, do not exist. It did much to
14-awaken a sympathy between himself and his inferior

229
fellow-creatures. Meanwhile, as he receded from Rome,
the sufferings of the past week began to soften and die
away under the iniluence of the open air, the beautiful
scenery, and the rapid motion. His thoughts wandered
forwards ; and though he dreaded the bitter recollections
which awaited him at Naples, the thought of his child,
whom he was going to rejoin, and from henceforth
intended to devote himself to rear, gained on him every
hour. It was the star still left in the horror of thick
darkness which had fallen on himthe spark from which
a fuller light might hereafter be kindledthe centre
round which alone upon earth his memories and his
hopes might gather, and find happiness and duty still.
He thought of it as lying in its dear mother's arms, as
he had first beheld it; as learning to stretch out its little
arms to him, even though unable to speak ; as laughing
brightly at his approach ; as playing with the hair of
his head, and crying to be taken by him and tossed ; as
reviving many a little trace of that face, pensive and
exquisitely beautiful, which had first entranced him ; and
as about to become an image-of himself, Villiers would
have said, had he dared to conclude the sentence : but
then came the consciousness of his sin, of his own undu-
tifulness and cruelty (he would have used no lighter word);
and he could only breathe a prayer that his child might
not be the image of himself.
It was with such a thought in his heart that the
vehicle drove into the dirty narrow street of Fondi. He
had passed it more than once before, and was well
acquainted with the formalities attending passports. It
was therefore with some surprise that he found Giuseppe
detained in the police office for a considerable time, and
with still greater that he saw him come out accompanied
by one of the officers, who informed Villiers that
there was an informality in his papers, and that it was
impossible for him to proceed till they had been exam.
ined further. There was a singular hesitation and
strangeness in the man's manner; and when Villiers
begged to know the nature of the informality, he could
only reply vaguely and impatiently that there was

suspicion, irregularity, and that there must be some delay
" How long ?" inquired Villiers.
Perhaps three days," was the answer.
At another time, Villiers's indignation would have
vented itself abruptly, and not very wisely. But his
temper had been schooled, as well as other defects in his
character ; and after endeavoring to remonstrate calmly,
and to explain, but to no purpose, he took leave of
Giuseppe, and removing his portmanteau, submitted to be
shown to a miserable little albergo, there to content
himself with remaining until the difficulty could be
removed.
On looking round the wretched room, which was all
the accommodation supplied him, he was himself surprised
to find how little such external appearances affect us
when the mind is occupied with either deep sorrow or
deep joy ; especially how estranged it becomes even
fiom the thought of them, when there is a consciousness
within of having acted wrong-of being under punish-
ment. Punishment in a palace is a mockery ; and to
feel that he was suffering a punishment,to resolve on
bearing it manfully, and patiently, and gratefully, and
to look up to the hand which inflicted it with the prayer,
that such a spirit might be perfected within him, was
becoming every hour more and more the temper of his
mind.
In the evening he strolled out to relieve his thoughts,
painfully depressed and overwrought by several hours
spent among papers, and arrangements which were full
of bitterness for the future as well as for the past, and
with only one bright thought of consolation-the thought
of his child. As he returned into the narrow dirty street
of the little town, lose by the Dogana, a crowd was
collected round a door. A few faces, seemingly more
adventurous than the rest were prying into a hovel ; but
the most part, with countenances indicative of alarm and
consternation, mixed with that curiosity and fascination
of terror which is so common in uneducated minds, were
standing aloof, and spreading the news of some disaster
to every passer-by. On Villiers inqniring the cause, ho

found that the first case of a fever, which had been for
some time anticipated, had just broken out, and one of
the persons employed in the Dogana had been its victim.
The
poor fellow was alarmingly ill. But no one dared
to approach him. And it was only on Villiers going
into the miserable place where he lay, and summoning
the terrified by-standers to assist him in moving the
sufferer, and in providing him with some comforts, that
they ventured to risk the infection. It was some relief
to his mind to be engaged actively in a work of charity.
The tending by a sick bed brought back to him the
memory of two other sick beds, both of them associated
with remorse.
In this case there could be none. And
as the only old woman who could be found to remain
with the sufferer as nurse was timid and inexperienced,
Villiers himself sat up with the sick man during the
night. The poor woman, who was a Roman Catholic,
and had, therefore, been brought up in pious horror of
heretics, among whom she had been taught to class the
members of the English Church, was surprised to see him
spend no little part of the time on his knees. She had
been told that Protestants never knelt in prayerthat
they never prayed at all ; and her amazement was
great. The morning came, and the patient was better.
His gratitude was intense to Villiers ; and in expressing
it, he added to him a warning, which surprised him, but
to which he paid little attention. He told him that his
detention had been brought about apparently by a tra-
veller, who had preceded him by a few hours, and who
had had some secret conference with the chief of the
office ; and he hinted to him the necessity of being
cautious, if he had any secret enemy, or was conscious
of offences against the government. Villiers smiled,
and thanked the poor fellow for his advice ; but did not
think it worth while to make further inquiries of him
respecting a suggestion so obviously unfounded. Nor,
indeed, could the man have given him any further infor:
mation than the vague notion which he had gathered
from some incidental remarks of his superior.

when Villiers the next day took leave of him, on receiving
his passport, and with it apologies for the delay, nothing
more passed between them.
It was a bright and joyous afternoon, as Villiers
once more re-entered Naples. The sun was dancing on
the blue waters of the bay. The fringe of glittering
suburbs, which stretched round its magnificent curve,
flashed on the eye like marble. Vesuvius towered in
the distance, curling up a thin wreath of smoke upon
the golden sky. The road was full of gay-dressed pea-
sants, with their brilliant many-coloured costumes and
antique ornaments of gold and pearls. The lazzaroni,
capped and buttoned, were lying about, basking their
swarthy muscular limbs among the painted stalls of
water-melons and summer fruits. The Chiaia was
swarming with equipages, and gay boats were skim-
ming about the bay. The whole spectacle was luxury
and enjoyment. But to Villiers, over it all, there hung a
black, motionless, fearful veil like a pall. He sat back
in the humble conveyance with his eyes closed, his brow
knit, his lips compressed in anguish, and a weight pres.
sing upon his chest, which compelled him every now
and then, to the alarm of his fellow travellers, to heave a
deep groan, and stretch his head out of the window, as
if gasping for breath. He had answered so gently to
their first inquiries, if he was ill, and yet with such firm.
ness, that they at last permitted him to remain unnoticed.
The vehicle stopped on the Chiaia; and Villiers, muf-
fling himself up, called to him, from among a group of
fishermen, an old familiar face, which recognised him
at once. He bade the man see his portmanteau re-
moved ; and having sunk down in a little boat, which
was drawn up on the beach, they were soon launched
upon the bay. The honest fisherman saw, and partly
understood, the cause of his evident anguish ; and though
he remained silent, a bystander might have seen him
dash away something from his eyes as he looked upon
Villiers, and observed the tears streaming down through
the hands in which his face was buried. He held his
arm for Villiers to rest on, as he rose to step from the

boat, at the little moorings, close by the steps in the
cliff, under the trellised cottage, and the seat of rock ;
and Villiers caught at it, for he was ready to fall. But
as his foot touched the ground, a better thought seemed
to nerve him, and he sprang up the narrow path, impa-
tient till he could see all that now remained to him of joy
and hope upon earth, and could clasp his child to his
bosom. He faltered for one moment as he passed the
seat in the rock ; but the next he was at the door of the
cottage. It was closed. He rapped, that Marie, the
nurse, who had the care of the child, might hear him;
but Marie was evidently out. He looked in at the win-
dow, but could see no one.
The cradle was there,
but it was empty. Once more he rapped, but to no ef-
fect; and while waiting in expectation of an answer,
he observed that the flower-bed in the front had been
trampled on, seemingly by men's feet. He was startled
by a little
cry of surprise and dismay from a young girl,
whom he recognised as the daughter of a neighboring
peasant, and who endeavored to run away when she
saw him. But he compelled her to come to him ; and
on inquiring for Marie, the nurse, he could at first ob-
tain no answer. Evidently there was something to con-
ceal. At last the girl stammered out that Marie was
at their own house. And Villiers hurried to it. A
scream of dismay from the poor woman was the first
greeting. The few incoherent words which he could
extract from her were sufficient to inform him that his
last hope was gone.
Two nights before, a false alarm
of fire had been given at the door of Marie's cottage.
Startled from her sleep, she rushed out with the child in
her arms : two men, who had given the alarm, met her
at the door, offered to hold the child while she ran back
to secure her little property ; and while she was hastily
collecting what was most necessary to save, they had
disappeared. A small boat had been seen moored at
the bottom of the steps, which was never seen again

II AWKSTOVE.
It was past twelve on the following night, when a
man and his wife, who had been employed at times in
the establishm:nt of General Villiers while he was at
Naples, and who still lived in the house to take care of
it while untenanted and unfurnished, were coming home
from a rustic fte. As they came within the light of a
lamp which hung before an image of the Virgin-the
same lamp which had first revealed to Villiers that face
which he never forgot--they saw a figure leaning against
the wall, the hat slouched over the face, and the legs
bent as if unable to support themselves. It was evi
dently a person ill. He moaned as they approached :
and suffered them to raise his hat, and to reveal a face
ghastly with suflering of body and of mind, but which
they still were able to recognise as their young master's.
He scarcely replied to their astonished inquiries; and,
on their asking if they could take him home, he sank
down, muttering faintly that he had no home. A passer-
by aided them in raising him, and carrying him to the
house; and, on the arrival of a physician, they learnt
that he was in a high fever-partly the result of infec-
tion, from his watching over the sick man at Fondi, but
aggravated greatly by agony of mind, and the violent
exertion with which he had exhausted himself in en.
deavoring to trace his child.
We need not dwell upon the days and weeks which
followed-on the wanderings of mind upon past scenes
-the incoherent ravingsthe violence with which it
became necessary to coerce him--the wretchedness o.
every thing around him, in a large deserted house, with
none but its two poor inmates to soothe and nurse him ;
and then the dreadful dawning of returning reason, only
to reveal to him again the misery of his lot. Provi-
dentially, with the passing of the crisis there came some
relief to him in the person of his friend Beattie, who
had traced him out, and followed him from Rome. He
watched by him at night ; held his forehead when split-
ting with pain; administered his medicines; read to
him, prayed with him and for him ; led his thoughts
quietly and gently to see the dispensations of an over-

ruling goodness in their true light ; opened to him future
prospects of usefulness and duty; and, by his simple
and unaffected piety, wrought upon the mind of his
friend even more than Macarthy had wrought with all
bis brilliancy and force of genius.
It was one evening, after Villiers, leaning on Beat.
tie's arm, had returned from his first attempt to venture
into the open air, that he asked Beattie if he might now
be allowed to look at some letters which had arrived
for him, and which his physician had prohibited him
from reading before. He felt stronger, and able to hear
it; and Beattie gave them to him. One was froni Lady
Eleanor. She did not say that she was compelled to
write herself, because Lord Claremont had sternly re-
fused to do so : but with high-minded, yet feminine dig.
nity, she expressed her fi:ll conviction that the disposal
of General Villiers's property had been influenced by
the wrong suggestions of others; and her earnest desire
that, if possible, the will might be set aside, and the es
tates revert to Villiers, instead of coming to herself.
Villiers smiled as he pointed out the paragraph to Beattie.
But the first lines which he wrote, when able to take a.
pen in his hand, were to express, not only his admira .
tion and gratitude for his cousin's noble disinterested.
ness, but the impossibility of his permitting any chang,
to take place in arrangements in which he felt it his
duty patiently to acquiesce. Another letter was from his
uncle, dated from England, and informing him that he
bad obtained a commission for him in the army, as the
only thing which he could procure. Another was from
the Horse Guards, ordering him to join the regiment,
to which he had been appointed, in Canada, without
delay. And the fourth was from Pearce, with some
insolent inquiry about a inatter of business, which Vil-
liers read patiently, and replied to briefly without a single
expression of indignation at the insult.
The letters read, he raised his eyes, and looking
steadfastly upon Beattie, told him that he was now ready
and able to bear his answer to one more inquiry. Every
search had been made ; the assistance of the police had

direction. Had any trace whatever been discovered o
the child ?
Beattie shook his head mournfully : and Villiers,

endeavored to compose himself to entire submission.
As he opened his eyes again, he found Beattie was kneel.

as the best mode of soothing and comforting him. And

ment, and to prepare composedly and steadily to enter
on the new line of life to which he seemed to be
called.
CHAPTER XIX.
TWELVE years passed away ; and we may pass from
the sick bed of Villiers to the saloon of the English
ambassador at Florence. It was brilliantly illuminated
for a state dinner on a Friday. The tables glittered with

light radiance on gorgeous pictures, and marble statues
and jewelled guests. The cool plash of fountains,
amidst pillared porticoes and perfumed flowers, mixed
lullingly with soft strains of music. And the exquisite
taste of the noble ambassador, who was a notorious
profligate, threw round the scene an air of refinement and
fastidiousness, which almost oppressed enjoyment. The
gorgeously-dressed domestics moved in silence on the
velvet carpets. Even the creaking of a door or the
derangement of a dish seemed to inflict pain on the sen.

assume
sitiveness of the voluptuous host. Every one spoke in
a low voice, as if a sound beyond a whisper was an
infringement on the solemnity of the festival ; when the
countenance of the illustrious ambassador was seen to
a haughty gloom, as he observed a very ill-
disguised yawn distorting the countenance of one of
his youngest guests in the regimentals of a distinguished
corps. Captain O'Brien really was extremely tired.
He had enjoyed, or rather suffered some little experience
of state dinners, when aide-de-camp to his uncle, a late
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. But with all his habits of
society and good breeding, the
young
vivacious Irishman
was not proof against the somnolent influence of the
ambassador's grandeur. He endeavored to rouse him-
self by obtaining the attention of a very lovely and
elegant woman who sat next him, and whose conversation
bad been hitherto engrossed by an elderly white-headed
gentleman on the other side of her. He observed that
she refused every dish presented to her ; and the second
time that O'Brien offered her some preparation of meat,
she asked for vegetables only. O'Brien trusted she was
not ill; and with perfect unaffectedness she replied
that she did not eat meat on fast-days. O'Brien for a
moment opened his dark animated eyes with some degree
of incompetency to understand her.
" I thought I had the pleasure," he said, " of addressing
an English lady, or, though we are aliens in Ireland, may
I not say, a countrywoman ?"
The lady smiled, and only replied that he was not
mistaken ; but that English ladies might be Catholics.
O'Brien colored, and apologized.
" We are commanded by our Church," she continued,
" to practise these little self-denials ; and I have often
thought it might be very beneficial if other religious
communities enjoined them likewise. But English
Protestants, I believe, have entirely discarded them."
O'Brien knew little either of Roman Catholics or
of English Protestants, in matters of theology.
" One person," he replied, "I knew, who was a Pro.
testant, and who always fasted on Friday. I knew it

well, for it was connected with matters of deep interest
to myself. By the bye," he said, forgetting the solemn
quiescence which reigned around him, and speaking
across the table to an old military officer covered with
orders, "how delighted I am to hear that Villiers has
come into possession of his property again. I saw it in
the
papers this morning."
The ambassador's face assumed a deeper gloom than
before. The old General shyly answered, " Yes," and
coughed, as if to intimate that the subject might as well
be dropped. But the warm-hearted young Irishman had
fallen on a subject very near his heart.
Have
you
heard the circumstances ?" he con.
tinued. " The property was left away by his father to
his cousin, and his cousin has given it back to him; and
there was some statement of a paper being found in a
cabinet. But one thing is certain, that Lady Eleanor
has behaved most nob

voice of condemnation, begged to introduce him to Lady
Eleanor Villiers, who was sitting by his side. O'Brien's
fine features were once more suffused with a very be.
coming flush. But Lady Eleanor soon relieved him
from his momentary embarrassment.
" Mr. Villiers, I presume," she said, " is a friend of
yours?"
"A very dear friend," said O'Brien.
" You must not then think too well of his cousin,"
said Lady Eleanor. "I am sorry to say she has had no
opportunity of acting nobly; and the newspapers, those
miscalled sources of information, have, in this case, as in
most others, been egregiously wrong.'
O'Brien bowed, and was prepared to make some
lively compliment. But Lady Eleanor, with quietness
and simplicity, continued :-
" As Mr. Villiers's friend, you will be happy to hear
that he is in Florence."
O'Brien almost clapped his hands ; but a look from
the ambassador froze him into quietude.

"He arrived this morning," said Lady Eleanor." and
will, I hope, meet us here this evening."
" And may I ask," said O'Brien, " if the statement
respecting the recovery of the estate is true ?"
" It is true," was the reply, "in its principal facts.
But the recovery is simply owing to the law. .General
Villiers, it was only recently discovered, had no power
to alienate the English estates. He had overlooked a
codicil in his grandfather's will ; and to me it has been
a great satisfaction that they should still be retained in
the original line."
" And there was no paper, then," asked O'Brien,
"found in an old chest? The whole story sounded so
like a romance, that I distrusted it from the first."
" There was
a paper found by Mr. Beattie, an
intimate friend of Mr. Villiers, but found some years
back, which implied that the General's will had been
made under undue influence ; and this probably would
have had the effect of overturning the will itself, if it
had been brought into litigation. But you are Mr.
Villiers's friend, and you will not be surprised to hear
that he refused to take advantage of it. There were
circumstances connected with it, which would have in.
volved further discussion of matters which it was more
honorable to the memory of those who are gone to pre-
serve in privacy."
" How like him!" exclaimed O'Brien.
" Lady
Eleanor must pardon me if I intrude such questions ;
but Villiers is the best and dearest friend I have in the
world. And they laugh at me for raving whenever he is
mentioned."
Lady Eleanor was interested in her companion's
enthusiasm.
" Is it possible," he continued, lowering his voice,
"to tell you a very long story without drawing the
attention of this whole solemn meeting ?"
"If you are repeating what is good of him," replied
Lady Eleanor, " you need not be alarmed.
I fear,
generally speaking, it is only scandal which attracts
attention."

HAWKSTONE.
"And may I begin at the beginning ?" asked
O'Brien, laughingly.
Lady Eleanor prepared to listen, and O'Brien, re-
lieved from his ennui, delighted at having obtained the
attention of his fair neighbor, and still more at being
indulged with the full expression of his admiration and
affection for his friend, proceeded, with all the natural
eloquence, energy, and vivacity of a well-educated Irish
gentleman, to recount his story :-
"We were quartered," he said, "in Canada some
years since, when Villiers first joined the regiment.
At that time, and in our own regiment, duelling was a
prevailing fashion. Scarcely any one was allowed to
join us without being compelled to engage in this,
which now I will call detestable, practice of murder.
But then I thought differently. When Villiers first came
out he was just recovering from illness, and evidently in
great distress of mind. At that time I did not know
the cause ; but he was allowed for some weeks to remain
much to himself. And young and thoughtless as we
were, we felt it right to give him some indulgence. But
you must be aware how little young men of high spirits,
and thinking only of amusement, can bear with melan-
wholy and gloom in others. Villiers was always gentle.
manly, kind, and considerate, but he was reserved and
depressed ; and there was a superiority of mind and
manner about him which we construed as haughtiness.
A month or two passed, and we became impatient of his
continued retirement. In particular, we observed that
he never joined the mess on a Friday ; and as this was
a convenient day for parties, his absence became marked.
I need not say how soon, where offence is sought, offence
may be taken. And I, as one of the youngest and most
hot-brainedI will add a stronger word, as one of the
most unprincipled of the partyboasted that I would
compel him to attend the mess or insult him. It was not
difficult to find an opportunity. Lady Eleanor will have
no wish to hear details, of which I shall always be
ashamed. But I did (and O'Brien lowered his voice,
and with the color mounting to his face, hung down his

241
head as he proceeded), I did at the mess-table make
observations which he could not avoid overhearing, and
which led to a gentle expostulation on his part, to sume
insulting reply on mine ; and at last, when he rose to
leave the room, to language for which, in the ordinary
code of society, no reparation could be given but
bloodshed.
"I was sitting in my room late that night, having
sade all necessary preparations in case I should fall, and
wondering that I had not yet received any communication
to fix the meeting for the morrow, when I heard a rap at
the door, and drawing myself up to receive, as I expected,
Villiers's friend, to my extreme astonishment I saw
Villiers hiinself. He was perfectly calm and self-
possessed ; and there was a gentleness and dignity in his
manner which gave to him such a superiority over me,
that I could only escape from it by rudeness. "I am
come," he said, "Mr. O'Brien, (for I was then only a
lieutenant), to express to you my forgiveness for your.
having insulted me to-day as you have done : I am willing
to believe that the act escaped you in a moment of
thoughtlessness. But I am come also to express to you
with my own lips that no such act, whether proceeding
rom thoughtlessness or deliberation, will induce me, I
trust, to comply with that false code of honor which thinks
it possible to wipe out disgrace only by committing either
suicide or murder. When you have been visited as I
have been, you will feel, I cannot doubt, that there is
another code, far higher and far more awful in its chas.
tisements than that of human society, and to which we
are all amenable. By this code I am not only bound 10
abstain from seeking your life in revenge for an injury
offered to me, but I am bound to give you my free and
hearty forgiveness, which I now tender you ; and to seek
the first opportunity, in some legitimate way, of evincing
that this forgiveness is not one of words only, and that
my present act is not the act of a coward. Until that
opportunity is presented I must be content to remain
under the stigma which your act has thrown on me.

had withdrawn.
66. Coward ! hypocrite! fool!' were the first words
which came to my lips. They were repeated by the
greater part of the mess, when the story became known.
Villiers himself was of course shunned and sent to Co.
ventry; and the commanding officer was only prevented
from showing similar feeling by his private connection
with Villiers's family. In the mean time Villiers re-
tired from our society, without seeming to shun it. I
thought his manner was that of a man struggling against
a violent temptation, and suffering under bitter mortifi-
cation. But he was calm and patient in his exterior,
and refused to notice the little acts of insolence and
contempt with which the youngest among us now ven.
tured to molest him. He bore with it for at least six
weeks. At the end of that time my corps was ordered
on an expedition. Our business was to occupy New.
town height, which commanded the river at Toronto, and
the rebels were in great force underneath it. I shall
not easily forget the march we had, in the dead of night,
through the woods, and a morass in which we sank up
to our knees, expecting every moment that the enemy
would fall upon us. It was the most perilous expedition
of the whole war. Here was the heightthere the
river-here we passed through the forest." And O'Brien,
once embarked in his military maneuvres, endeavored
to assist Lady Eleanor's comprehension by ranging bon-
bons and comfitures on the table, much, if we may ven-
ture the pun, to the discomfiture of the refined ambassa-
dor, and not a little to Lady Eleanor's disappointment,
whose thoughts were far less engaged with the military
tactics than with the anecdote of Villiers.
" Just as we were on the point," continued O'Brien,
" of debouching from the forest (debouching, you should
know, means issuing out, and is a military phrase)
just here, by this green bonbon, you see, the alarm was
given, and in an instant we found ourselves surrounded.

I had advanced before the rest, and was cut off from
behind. Four of the rebels fell on me. I received a

up his hand), " which completely disabled me ; and I was
on the point of being cut down between them, when one

make my retreat, and he would cover it. A second
assailant was stretched by him on the ground. But be.

any of our own men, whom he had rallied, could

ing, and only one person with me, who was employed
in bandaging my wounds,--and that person was Villiers.
I was perishing with thirst. He had procured some
water in a hollow stone, and some biscuit, which I after-
wards found was all that he had for himself. And when,
with a mixed sensation of resentment, indignation, and
shame, I interrogated him as to the reason of his pres-
ence, he charged me to be silent, for that we were still
near the enemy's outposts, and that we must wait till
night before we could veuture to move."
" What had brought him on the expedition ?"
"I found subsequently that he had learned, after we
had left our quarters, that we should probably be surprised;
had obtained permission from the commanding officer to
follow with a few men ; had come to my personal res.
cue : and when the rest had been compelled to retire,
he had thrown himself, with me, into the wood, had dis-
missed those who carried me, and had remained himself
watching by me till a reinforcement could be sent, and
I could be removed. And, now, will Lady Eleanor ex-
cuse a stranger, if he has taken up her time with a tale
of such a man?"
"And you both escaped ?" asked Lady Eleanor.
" We lay covered all that day, not daring to stir ;
and in the evening a movement was made by our troops,
which compelled the rebels to decamp, and we escaped
to head-quarters."

" And from that day," continued Lady Eleanor, "I
presume, you date your friendship with Mr. Villiers ?"
" No," replied O'Brien, "not from that day. It
was too noble, too oppressive kindness. What with
shame, and what with gratitude, I could not feel to him
as a friend. I wished to apologise to him publicly, but
he would not hear of it. Of course, he was received
among us again ; and every one spoke of him as a fine,
noble-hearted fellow. But those who have injured sel.
dom forgive ; and I could scarcely forgive him, even for
saving my life by an act of heroism which made me so
immeasurably his inferior. And he knew this; and
never sought to do me any more kindness till I was taken
seriously ill : and then, when all my other noisy com-
panions deserted me, or only came to pay a hurried visit,
and excuse themselves for not staying above a few mi-
nutes, I was left alone, terribly depressed, and would
have given worlds for any society. He never came
near me, however, till one day the nurse begged him
to come, and said she knew I should like it,-and I did
like it. If he had been my own brother, he could not
have been more kind, more affectionate. As soon as he
found that I took pleasure in seeing him, he had his bed
moved into the next room, and was with me constantly.
And from that time he has been my friend. Such a
friend," he continued, looking on Lady Eleanor with his
large full eye suffused for a moment,
But I
must not weary you
with
my
enthusiasm."
Lady Eleanor was not wearied; she was any thing
but wearied; but there was one question which she
longed to ask, but scarcely dared.
"My little observation respecting fasting," she said,
" has brought from you a very interesting anecdote.
Mr. Villiers was then a Protestant ?"
"Oh, yes," said O'Brien ; "he never was any thing
se. But he used to do a number of things which I am
afraid are not very common among Protestants. I know
he associated very much with an American bishop, near
whom we were stationed; and I suspect what he saw in
America very much confirmed him in many of his opin

ions. I have private reasons for knowing that he regu.
larly set apart a tenth of his income, and it was very
small, for charitable and religious purposes; and he
often urged me to do the same. He used regularly to
stay at church."
And the young officer, in using the ordinary expres-
sion applied to the most solemn act of Christian devo-
tion, little thought of the censure it implied upon the
great mass of Christian congregations who do not stay,
but go away.
"1 have known him," continued O'Brien, "ride
twenty miles for the purpose on a Saturday, and return
on the Monday. He had regular hours when he used
to disappear ; and even in the middle of the day I am
convinced that he was in the habit of praying.
I was
young and thoughtless," continued O'Brien, " and have
been worse than thoughtless; but I have learnt from
him lessons which will be a blessing to me to the end of
my life.'
" His Excellency will drink wine with you, sir," in.
terrupted the plumed chasseur of the noble host, whose
indignation at his young guest's vivacity was consider-
ably mollified when he observed the attention paid by
Lady Eleanor, whom his fastidious taste recognised as a
model of refinement, to O'Brien's animated conversa-
tion. The interruption, however, did not prevent O'Brien
from returning to his favorite theme.
" I fear," he said, " that with all his goodness he is,
and has been, very unhappy. I rarely saw him smile."
"Perhaps," said Lady Eleanor, "his unhappiness
may have been the cause of his goodness ?"
" It was not goodness," replied O'Brien, "if I might
trust his own account, which caused his unhappiness
He never recovered the loss of his child and wife."
" Wife !" repeated Lady Eleanor, thrown off her
guard, and her eye lighting up as if a weight had been
removed from her mind. O'Brien looked surprised.
"Perhaps," he said, " I am betraying confidence.

ingly induced him to continue, but knew not how, with-
out betraying the deep interest which she felt in the
tale.
"She was the daughter," added O'Brien, " of an
officer in the Spanish army, of high rank, but who haa
been driven from his country through political disturban
ces in which he had become involved."
"I had heard something of this," replied Lady
Eleanor ; " but I had fancied she was of low birth."
" No, certainly not," answered O'Brien.  They
were reduced to great poverty, and the father supported
himself by his own hands; but there was certainly good
blood."
Once more there was a pause.
" He seems," said O'Brien, " to have doted on his
child, though it was so young. I shall never forget a
scene I witnessed, and which led to his telling me these
facts ; for otherwise he was very reserved, and rarely
spoke of himself or his own affairs, even to his most
intimate friends."
Lady Eleanor begged him to proceed.
" There was a young soldier," he continued, " in the
regiment, who was very ill-conducted and dissipated;
and after a number of reprimands and slighter punish-
ments, it became necessary to have him flogged. Vil-
liers happened to be the officer who was ordered to
superintend the execution of the sentence-never a very
pleasant task ; but though most gentle in himself, he
was remarkably firm when it was necessary to punish.
I have seen him do things, without moving a muscle,
which our greatest disciplinarians would have shrunk
from. In this case something led him to have a com-
munication with the poor culprit before the flogging com-
menced. He heard his story,who he was,-how he

had been brought into his present state. It appeared
that he had been kidnapped from his parents when
young, and had been thrown into every kind of tempta-
tion, and ruined by bad company. I shall never forget
Villiers's face as he came upon the ground after the
interview. It was pale as ashes. His lips were nearly
bitten through. But he took his position,-gave the
signal,-never shrunk, till after the tenth lash, when the
poor fellow uttered a hideous cry, and Villiers dropped
to the ground. He was taken up senseless ; and I never
saw such agony as he evinced when he recovered. In
was this which brought me to know the circumstances
which had occurred to him before he joined the regi-
ment. What made him feel most acutely the loss
of his child was the sense that he himself had been un-
dutiful to his own father."
Lady Eleanor sighed deeply.
" But I am distressing you," said O'Brien, " by these
melancholy reminiscences. And here is the signal for
breaking up our solemn festivities for a more solemn
dinner I never saw.

"Who is that distinguished-looking man ?" asked the
Duchess of San Lorenzo, as she reconnoitred with her
glass the brilliant groups which began to fill the ambas-
sador's saloons on the breaking up of the dinner party.
"Do you mean," asked a lively conceited little abb,
who had attached himself to her side" do you mean
that tall mustachioed Russian bear, who is leaning
against the pillar ?"
No,the one on the other side by the window."
Oh, that slim youth with the long flowing hair and
the collar turned down to expose his Byron neck! That
is the young English lord who writes the verses for the
fashionable albums."
"How can you suppose I mean him ?" pettishly re-
plied the duchess. "Who would apply such an epithet
as distinguished to him ?"
" Is it the robust figure who is taking snuff out of a
gold snuff-box, with a hand covered with gold rings, and

brushing off the dust from his gold brocaded waistcoat ?"
" How can you ask such a question! Do you see
Lady Eleanor Villiers ?"
"If your Grace were not in the room," replied the
little abb, " I should say how can I possibly see any
one else when she is here ?"
Well, look to the right of her,--not the young offi-
cer; that is Captain O'Brien ; but the person in black
-rather dark---Without anything very marked about
him, --so simple and quiet, and yet with such an eye.
See, the ambassador is coming up to him. He must be
some one of consequence, for I never knew our punc-
tilious host throw away such urbanity and condescension
on ordinary mortals. See, Lord Claremont is intro-
ducing him. I declare the ambassador is shaking hands
with him ; and old General Fitzwilliam is moving
towards him. Do find him out and bring him to me."
And the little abb fidgeted away to execute the
duchess's orders, full of the gratitude which he should
excite in the interesting stranger, by introducing him to
the great leader of the fashionable world of Florence,
whose fiat, notwithstanding her frivolity and levity, stamp-
ed consequence on any one whom she condescended to
notice. As he approached Lady Eleanor, Villiers and
O'Brien were conversing with her,--O'Brien with his
usual animation, and Villiers even cheerfully. He even
laughed at some story which the young Irishman was
relating; and Lady Eleanor looked pleased to see him
shake off his gravity. The little abb found no difficulty
in insinuating himself into the group, requesting an in-
troduction, and offering his assistance in exploring the
classical scenes of Florence; all which courtesies Vil.
liers received gently, but with a little distance of man-
ner which might easily have been mistaken for hauteur.
But the abb could not be repelled. He proposed an
introduction to the duchess ; but Villiers bowed coldly,
almost sternly; and expressing to Lady Eleanor his
hope that he had sufficiently done his duty in paying his
respects to the ainbassador, he shook O'Brien by the
hand, and retired, unobserved from the gay throng.

CHAPTER X X.
WHEN Villiers came to Florence, it was for a weck
only, in order to conclude some neces
essary business with
Lord Claremont connected with the restoration of his
property: But the week passed, and matters were still
unsettled : the month came, and he was still there. It
became necessary to fix the period of his return to Eng-
land, and he found himself still postponing his departure ;
each day becoming more loth to leave the place. Why?
he never thought of asking himself. But day slided into
day unobservedly : at last some private business render-
ed it necessary for Lord Claremont and Lady Eleanor
to go for a short time to Venice. Villiers, by Lady
Eleanor's request to her father, was not asked to join
them. It was proposed that he should remain at Flor-
ence till their return; and the good Abb St. Maur, the
French Roman Catholic priest who resided in the family,
proposed to remain with him. Villiers found, to his
surprise, that he would gladly have accompanied his
uncle to Venice ; he found also, to his no less surprise,
that with the departure of his cousin the whole charm
of Florence disappeared ; and that the house, which
before was so full to him of animation and enjoyment
that he could not bring himself to quit it, had become a
dreary vacuity. He was not indeed without thoughts
and occupations which filled his mind ; but even these
had lost their absorbing interest, until, in one of the
blank moments of chilliness which fall on us when a
vacant chair reminds us of an absent being, a light flash-
ed across him ; and the good Abb observed that, after
a silent breakfast, Villiers walked for more than an hour
up and down the same walk in the garden, his eye occa-
sionally glancing up to a particular window, and his
pace hurrying after each glance. The Abb was an
attentive observer ; but he never intruded upon confi.
dence : and except that he looked into Villiers's face
with more of kind and affectionate interest than usual, as
Villiers brought hin his stick and covered his silver hair

with his hat, previous to their going out for their usual
walk, there was nothing to betray what was passing in
the mind of the benevolent and simple-minded ecclesi-
astic. Perhaps, however, something of this might be
gathered from a letter which he sat up that night to
write, and which we can insert at length, because, by
our usual faculty of ubiquity, we were present at the
post-office at Rome when a stout, sinister-looking per-
son, no other than Mr. Pearce himself, came there to
ask for letters for the Rev. Mr. O'Dogherty, then an
inmate in the Jesuits' College ; and by the same faculty
we followed Mr. Pearce into a small house, previous to
his returning to the College, and by means of a process
familiar to himself, were there able to read the letter
with him before it was resealed and taken to its original
destination. It ran thus :-
"My dear O'Dogherty,
" I received your last letter with some surprise, and
reply to it with much pain. But, as a Christian minis.
ter, I cannot hesitate to speak what I feel. I never can
take a part in any intrigue or plot, however desirable the
object may seem. I do not think that plotting and in-
triguing can ever be serviceable to the Church of Christ,
or to the cause of His truth. And, devotedly as I am
attached to our holy Church, I have lamented most
deeply that others have so frequently endeavored to as.
sist and support it by what I must consider artifices
unworthy of such an object. Surely we have suffered
enough already for such conduct. I can well understand
that the person of whom you speak should be an object
of interest to all those who are concerned in restoring
England to the unity of the faith. I have seen enough
of him here to be assured that, wherever he is placed,
he must exercise a powerful influence. His high-mind.
edness, his integrity, his firmness, his conscientious
strictness, his ardent enthusiasm and his command of
property and rank, would render him a most important
convert ; and I should rejoice, like yourself, to see him
received into the hosom of our holy Church. More

2:51
than this, it is my duty, at proper times, and in an open
honest manner, to set before him the truth, and to lead
him, as I may have opportunities, to embrace it. But
this is very different from becoming a spy upon his ac.
tions, communicating his thoughts to others, or under-
taking any secret maneuvres to accomplish such a de-
sirable result. I deeply grieve that you should have
known me so ill as to make to me such a proposition ; for
however cautiously your letter is worded, I cannot read
it in any other sense. And I will frankly declare, that
no zeal for your order, or vow of obedience to your supe.
riors, or prospect of benefit to the Church, can justify
your engaging in such schemes. I must distrust, and
deplore, and deprecate, any organisation, or religious
association, which proceeds upon such principles. It is
founded in falsehood and deceit, and must end in heresy
and schism. You will call me a Protestant ; but my
heart is Catholic as your own.
I would even charge
you to abstain from these intrigues, by the hope which
I have that they are not required ; and that, if all
things are left to the hand of Providence, He will
bring out the end which we all should desire.
His mind is at this moment anything but settled.
He has been shocked in America by the full development
of what is commonly called Protestantism. He abhors
that license of self-will and of private judgment which
casts off all deference to authority, all belief in the
testimony of the Church, and in the social principle by
which the Church, as a body politic, exists. And he is
too acute not to see that it must lead to every kind of
dissension and heresy ; and, with the banishment of
truth, must banish order, and goodness, and religion, from
the world. All this he thoroughly understands, and
requires no one to teach him. Much of it, I suspect, he
derives from early impressions ; much fron his own
generous nature ; and he speaks often to me of an
American bishop (so called), who appears to have exer-
cised considerable influence over his mind, and to have
taken pains to point out to him the working of these
princ ples of mischief in that unhappy country. I have
;

HAWKSTONE.
also reason to believe that he has friends in England, a
Mr. Beattie in particular, whom he consults on these
points, and who is very much tinctured with the new
notions that are springing up in the English Church.
I mention these things that, if your views with
respect to
him are simply to extricate him from error, your mind
may be in some degree relieved. It would be idle, how.
ever, to disguise that he is at present a strict conformist
to the English communion, and carries out its rules with
far more scrupulousness than I have ever observed in
any of his countrymen. He is, indeed, so conscientious,
that I cannot imagine his becoming a member of any
society, least of all of a religious society, without
endeavoring fully to act up to its spirit and its rules.
At the same time, I cannot but perceive that he has
once entertained a strong predilection for our holy
Church ; and though some degree of repugnance to it
succeeded in consequence of circumstances which oc.
curred to him some years back (circumstances, let me
remind you, which had their origin in the artifices and
intrigues then employed to win him over), since he has
been in Florence, and especially since he has seen the
conduct of Lady E., I have reason to think that his
feelings are very much mitigated. He often speaks 19
ine of the possibility of such a reform in the Church a1:3
would restore the unity of Christendom. Unity appears
to be his chief thought. He dreads the anarchical spirit
which is rising up against the truth ; mourns over the
impotency of secular governments to arrest the torrent
of change ; longs to see once more the Church of his
own country reasserting her spiritual power, and gather-
ing the people under her wing. And this, he thinks,
cannot be achieved until its arm is strengthened, and its
spirit renewed, by the restoration of peace and concord
to the whole Church of Christ. So much I am at liberty
to tell you without violating confidence. Nor, indeed, an?
I possessed of his confidence further than that he seems
to take pleasure in conversing with me on such subjects.
You hint at other thingsat the influence which Lady
E. may have upon his mind, and the probability of this

253
winning him over, even if every thing else failed
Once more let me warn you not to engage in such specu-
lations, or in any maneuvres to effect such an object.
If such a union as you contemplate should be ordained
by Providence, I can imagine few more likely to be
blessed, as I have never seen persons apparently more
suited to each other, more pure, more high-minded, more
able to appreciate, and support, and improve each other's
character, and to give a wonderful strength and support
to the cause of our Church in England. But let us
leave such designs to Providence ; let us leave to Him
also to accomplish the great end we have in viewthe
conversion of England. I pray for it as you pray. But
I cannot bring myself to view the Church of England as
you do, or to confound it with that heterogeneous and
fearful mass of heresy and dissent which has overrun
that unhappy country. It has, indeed, severed itself
from the see of Rome ; but so, also, our own Church in
France has denied much that you, on your side of the
Alps, consider essential to a right faith in this article.
The English Church has preserved the creeds, the four
first councils, her apostolic succession (all this, strongly
as you would deny it, I cannot, in common honesty,
refuse to allow), her respect for primitive antiquity,
though individually it may have been neglected, the Holy
Scriptures, and a sound principle of interpreting them by
the aid of the teaching of the Church. I know how
strongly you repudiate such concessions ; but as I differ
from
you
in
many other points, so I lament, and can only
anticipate evil from a refusal to acknowledge in others
palpable good. It is not honest ; it is not Christian.
And sadly as the individual teachers and members of
the English Church have neglected or misunderstood
her teaching, sadly as her rulers may have failed to
enforce her discipline and to uphold her authority, I can
no more charge the sins of individuals upon the com
munion itself than I can reject our own Church, because,
as we all confess, its rulers from time to time have so
deeply sinned. If this spirit of concession and of charity
prevailed among u? - if our own Church 'vould acknow

ledge that the English Church was a true branch of
Christ's Catholic Body, and would seek to restore com.
munion with it by correcting what is amiss in itself, and
by abstaining from troubling the peace of others, I cannot
but believe that the English Church also would rejoice
to see the wounds of Christendom healed, and would not
hesitate to remove anything in her own practice which
might reasonably offend a sister or a mother Church.
But so long as we violently condemn what we are not
called on to judge, and cut off from salvation those whom
the early Church would not have excluded, and confound
those who at most are erring in inferior matters, with
gross heretics and deliberate offenders against Christ's
laws, and send out emissaries to trouble the peace of
Christian communities,--so long I must think that we
are sinning against God, and though a zealous and affec.
tionate son of our Holy Church, I cannot expect that a
blessing will be vouchsafed upon her labors. I know to
what I should expose myself if these my opinions became
generally known. But I am now old, and life bas no
longer any thing to tempt me. I have thought deeply and
honestly on these things ; and when I am called on, I
shall not hesitate to declare my conviction. I pray, as
you pray, for the restoration of England to the unity of
the Church ; but I pray also that we may discharge our
duty in preparing for this great work by cutting off our
own offences. England indeed is important, and you are
right in directing towards her your chief thoughts. Her
wealth, her intelligence, her weight in the councils of
Europe, her science, her command of the seas, her vast
empire, her commerce and her colonies, which would give
Christianity access to every part of the world, her lan-
guage, which is spread over the whole continent, her ga.
gantic resources of every kind, her very position on the
globe, point her out as the strong arm of Christ's Church
as the great sanctuary of Christ's truth. With
England doing its duty for the cause of the Gospel, what
triumphs might we not expect for that Gospel even to the
end of the world? In all this we heartily agree.
But
beware lest your zeal for Rome make you the preacher

255
of another gospel than that which Christ and his Apostles
preached. Seek not to make England a handmaid of
the Pope rather than a handmaid of Christ. Think not
of a spiritual empire over the minds and bodies of men,
but of proclaiming to them truth, and truth only. And
then you will not be tempted to engage in those plots and
conspiracies (I cannot call them by a milder name) in
which none take refuge but those who have objects at
heart which they cannot trust to God's providence to
accomplish, or who have not faith in his power. You
know that I have always remonstrated against any such
means of effecting Christian objects. They have brought
upon us already hatred, shame, persecution, contempt,
and punishment-punishment most deserved, though most
severe. They have arrayed against us not only kings
and princes, but people and priests. They have made
the very name that you bear a by-word for falsehood and
cunning. And the principle on which they were adopted
at the first has led to other acts and other doctrines,
which have roused even bishops and fathers of our Church
to protest against your system as against the Antichrist,
which is to come. Forgive me this freedom. But as an
old and beloved friend as one with whom I have
borne much, and whom I cannot believe to be yet
entangled irremediably in the meshes of a most dangerous
policy,I warn you, and pray for you, that you may yet
be preserved in the simplicity and innocency of Christian
charity. My letter of course you will destroy. And my
secret, so far as my opinions may be a secret, is, I know,
safe in
your
hands.
From
your
affectionate brother in the Lord,
PIERRE St. Maur."

The effect of this letter upon the person to whom it
was addressed, it is unnecessary at present to explain.
One thing also may be observed, that it was not de.
stroyed. The admissions in it were too important to
permit their being lost. And the simple unsuspicious
St. Maur little thought that in making such a communi.
cation to a bosom friend he was betraying himself to a

whole community. In the meanwhile the absence of
Lord Claremont and Lady Eleanor threw him every day
more into the company and confidence of Villiers, whose
respect for his office, for his age, for his singular simpli.
city and piety, and for the absence of all bigotry and
bitterness from the strictness of his religious opinions, was
increased as he became more acquainted with the trials
through which he had passed. By degrees each opened
his mind more freely to the other.' And St. Maur felt no
scruple in suggesting to Villiers all the considerations
which rendered the union of the Church under the
Roman Pontiff an object of such paramount interest and
importance. He pointed out the impotency of any
national church to resist the aggressions of the civil
power. He showed the necessity of its allying itself
with that civil power, if left without any other arm to
strengthen its authority. He recounted the temptations
of Erastianism, and the corruptions and laxity of disci.
pline which such secularity involved. He dwelt much on
the same grand view of Christian unity which Macarthy
had before with picturesque effect, and all the eloquence
of enthusiasm, exhibited to Villiers at Rome. He asked
how doubts could be resolved without some one authori.
tative expositor of divine truth-how dissensions and
schisms could be prevented where doubts were permitted
-how the picture of the Church, as delineated in the
Jewish polity, could be developed except by establishing
within it some visible centre of unity, with one Great
High Priest and one glorious Temple. All the ordi-
nary processes by which the Scriptures have been pressed
into the service of Romish controversialists were familiar
to him ; and he adopted them with a simplicity of faith
and sincerity of conviction which gave, at times, even to
vague inferences and metaphorical analogies, the force
of argument. Villiers listened. And when we brought
forward the result of his own inquiries on primitive
antiquity, and with a noble indignation protest against
the forgeries and falsehoods by which the paval su.
premacy
had been maintained on this ground, the honest,
unreserved St. Maur threw him off his guard at nce,

257
by conceding the point, by allowing the doctrine to
be a mere modern development, but a development of
expediency:
" Development !" repeated Villiers to himself; " De-
velopment !" and he dropped the abb's arm as they
were walking in the gardens of the Palais Pitti ; and
while the old man rested himself against a vase, Villiers
was thoughtfully pacing the terrace before the grand
fountain, which shot up a column of water high into the
air, and then spread it out and developed it in a fan- 'ike
canopy and dome of silver.
CHAPTER XXI.
"DEVELOPMENT !" again repeated Villiers, " Develop-
ment !" as he stood the next morning watching a young
orange tree which was shooting out its tender leaves
from a newly planted stem, when a servant came to
announce to him that a gentleman, with letters of intro-
duction from England, was in the saloon. Villiers's
thoughts were still upon the subject of development,
when he found himself facing a young man with an
easy rather than a gentlemanly address, and a disagree.
able sneer upon a cold sceptical countenance, which
made Villiers, who was sensitively alive to such physi.
ognomies, throw into his manner all the coldness and
reserve which was consistent with his usual politeness.
The gentleman had brought an introduction to Lord
Claremont from an under secretary of state, with whom
he had become acquainted by writing a political pamphlet
in defence of the Irish education system. And he intro-
duced himself by a name which Villiers had never heard
before, but with which our readers are already acquainted,
Mr. Marmaduke Brook.
Mr. Marmaduke Brook was what is commonly
called a man of the world. He had raised himself

258
HAWKSTONE.
froin a comparatively obscure rank to a certain position
by the address with which, both at school and at college,
and in after life, he had insinuated himself into the
acquaintance of persons of rank, and attached himself
to them. As is usually the case, his liberal and demo-
cratical theories were perfectly compatible with a pro-
found and fulsome reverence for rank in itself, and a great
degree of soreness and discontent at the reflection that he
did not possess it. But, clever and acute as he was,
he soon learned that intimacy and influence with the
fashionable and aristocratic world, which constituted
the great object of his earthly ambition, was not to be
attained by mere servility. He affected, therefore, con-
siderable independence ; never condescended to flattery,
except where he saw that this was the only bait which
he could offer; and assumed a tone of equality, and even
of superiority, which threw ordinary companions off
their guard, and in which, however surprised at first,
they soon learned to acquiesce. The same policy he
proposed to follow with Villiers ; but for once in his
life he found himself completely baflled by the simplicity,
but coldness, of Villiers's manners. His talent, how.
ever, and a certain power of accommodating himself to
the tastes and habits of any society, enabled him by
degrees to force himself even upon Vilijers, whose
acquaintance he soon found it was important for him to
obtain. And notwithstanding the repugnance, amount-
ing to antipathy, with which Villiers regarded his selfish
and worldly character, and his avowed principles of
Jiberalism, both in religion and in politics, it frequently
happened that Mr. Brook was permitted to intrude his
company upon the abb and himself after the introduction
of the first day had been attained.
It was on one of these occasions that the abb and
Villiers were standing in the gallery of Florence, watch-
ing a young artist who was copying, on a large scale,
the celebrated " St. John." The ardent intelligent fea-
tures of the boyfor he was scarcely morehad struck
Villiers ; and he had been led, as he usually was led
by such a spectacle, to inquire into bis history, with

66
something more than common curiosity, as if some
secret hope, which nevertheless he knew to be vain, was
still to be fulfilled by the inquiry--as if he were about
to find something which he had long lost. But the
boy's story was still unfinished, when the abb came up
and stood with him, watching the young painter's pro-
gress.
" And you are copying this picture at large," said
Villiers, " for an altar-piece ?"
" Yes, sir."
" And it is to be four times the size of the original ?"
The young artist assented.
Villiers paused a little. " Suppose," he continued,
taking the abb's arm" suppose that in effecting this
enlarged copythis development, you were to insert a
feature, or a color, or a portraiture of your own, what
would your employer say to you ?")
I suppose, sir, he would not buy my picture."
" And suppose," added Villiers, " that in copying the
face
you left the eyes of the same size as the origina.
while you made the nose of the magnified proportion.
what would you produce ?"
The boy laughed, and answered that it would be a
monster.
" You would not call it," said Villiers, " a develop-
ment, but a destruction of the original ?"
Certainly not."
"So that there are two laws," said Villiers, " which
you observe in your process of development,-first, to
insert nothing of your own ; and secondly, to develop
the whole together, not omitting any part ?"
The abb smiled, for he knew what was passing in
Villiers's mind.
" And will not these laws," Villiers continued, turn-
ing to the abb," will not these laws apply to the
office of the Church in developing the doctrine and the
discipline of the Gospel ? Must she not beware of intro-
ducing anything of her own in the pure simple word of
Revelation ? And when she does expand and illustrate
its general doctrines, must she not take care to embrary
66

HAWKSTONE.
them all, to omit none, to bestow equ..l attention, and
develop in equal proportions all alike, lest she make not
a copy, but a monster ?"
The abb assented.
" How far your Church," continued Villiers, "has
observed the first rule, might be a separate question.
But consider only the second. You say that in the
fourth and later centuries the doctrine of the unity of the
Church was developed into the papal supremacy. Were
there not other doctrines which should have been de.
veloped also, and which you have suffered to remain in
less than their original proportionthe doctrine of the
authority of the whole college of the Apostles, of their
Apostolical privileges separately, of the Episcopal power,
of the independence of the civil state, of the authority of
Scripture ? Were not these essentially parts of the sys-
tem of primitive Christianity; and have you not so neg-
lected these, while you expounded the doctrine of the
visible unity of the Church, that they have been over-
laid, as it were, and suppressed under the partial exag-
geration of a single counterbalancing feature ?"
Before the abb could satisfy himself with an answer,
Mr. Brook, who had seen and joined the little group,
ventured, in defiance of Villiers's very cold recognition,
to take a part in the conversation. "You are speaking,
I find, of the new doctrine, which is causing such a sen-
sation in England. It is singular to see how you high
churchmen are coming round by degrees to the truth."
Villiers opened his eyes widely, and looked at him.
" Mr. Brook must excuse me for begging that he
will not apply to me any title but that of churchman. I
know nothing either of high or low; and it is the use
of such party words which has already done incalculable
injury to the cause of truth and peace."
Brook quailed under the eye of Villiers, but soon
recovered himself. " And yet you must allow," he said,
" that there are parties in the Church, and that those
who have adopted what are called High Church views
are also putting forward their doctrine of development."
We must allow," said Villiers, " that a few indi.

But we must be very cautious whom we con-
found with them."
* I confess," continued Mr. Brook, " that I am re.
joiced to see any approach at last to liberality and free-
dom of view. Why is religion, any more than any
other art or science, to be excluded from those improve.
ments and expansions which the progress of knowledge
and civilization must produce? We know how experi-
ence increases knowledge, how prejudices are removed,
and errors corrected, by the advance of time. You
speak of antiquity; but we, as Bacon truly says, are the
real ancients. Surely there is no reason why dogmas
of theology may not be amended and corrected as well
as theories of any other philosophy ?"
"But one reason," said the abb, gravely" that
religion, the Christian religion, is a revelation, and that
philosophical theories are discoveries : one comes from
God, the other from man; one is given to us perfect at
once, the other is imperfect, and perfected only by
degrees."
" Ah !" said Brook ; " but then you take for granted
the fact that your theological dogmasfor instance, your
Athanasian Creed-are revelations."
Villiers colored indignantly.
(6 Mr. Brook will feel," he said, "that, in speaking
to a clergyman, and even to a lay member of the Church,
who heartily believes what he promised to believe at
his baptism, it is at least becoming to speak with respect
of the faith which they profess.
Whether there are not
higher motives for reverence, whether the bare possibil.
ity of such doctrines having come from Heaven may
not be sufficient to alarm us against treating them with
sneers and
sarcasm,
I will leave to Mr. Brook's own
good taste to judge."
Brook had not been accustomed to hear levity on
such subjects rebuked, and he was rather surprised.
But his courage was not daunted.

tention of giving offence; far from i But may I ven-
ture to ask the abb how he proves the fact of the
revelation of this or that doctrine ?"
" Assuredly," said the abb; " by the testimony of
the Church."
" Testimony to what, my dear abb," asked Villiers.
" To the particular doctrine," replied the abb,
** which is called in question---testimony that it has been
handed down from the Apostles; and their supernatural
commission, of course, is attested by their miracles."
" That it has been handed down !" asked Villiers.
Then this would imply that it has been transmitted un.
changed. You must identify it, must you not, throughout ?"
"Certainly," said the abb.
" And is it easy," asked Villiers, to "identify it
without preserving it unchanged? If a messenger
comes to me from a friend with a letter, stating that
he is to bring me a young infant, and, when I ask for
the infant, he produces me a full-grown man"-
" You mean the development of the infant," inter-
rupted Brook, laughing. But there was something in
the illustration which had suggested itself that seemed
co have pained Villiers, and he was silent. The abb
was evidently perplexed, but recovered himself.
Surely," he said, " if you were in India, or some
still more remote country, and a considerable time had
elapsed between the writing of the letter and the arrival
of the messenger, you would not be surprised to find
that the child had grown? You would not doubt its iden-
ity because it was no longer a mere infant ?"
" No," said Villiers ; " because in the child itself
there is a principle of growth ; and its alteration is so
necessary, that it must be implied in the original mes.
sage."
" And is it not so," asked the abb, " with divine
truth ? Has not that also within it a principle of growth?
Was not the seed sown by our Lord upon earth, and left
by Him expressly to be developed, after his Ascension
by the Holy Spirit in the mind of His Church ?"

"Of his Apostles, assuredly," said Villiers. " But
the question at issue is, whether any, since the Apostles,
have been intrusted with the same power of developing
it ?"
"What do you understand by development ?" asked
the abb. "What is precisely the process of it? and
then, perhaps, we may obtain more insight into the
truth."
" I mean by development," said Villiers, "the ap-
plication of a general rule, or a general principle, to the
particular cases which fall under it. Thus the Fourth
Commandment, and indeed all the other Commandments,
are given to us in the form of specific enactments, which
virtually, and by natural implication, contain in them,
like the Trojan horse, a whole host of legitimate infer-
ences and precepts of conduct. The duty of observing
the Sabbath involves the duty of obeying all other pos-
itive commands of God; and the duty of obeying pos-
itive commands in general applies to every instance
which occurs of the kind. So the doctrine of the divin-
ity of our Blessed Lord involves a multitude of other
doctrines ;-as, that he is most humbly to be adored ;
his atonementthat he is to be blessed and loved by us ;
his humanitythat he is to receive from us all such re.
gards and expressions of affection as are due to a perfect
human being, partaker of the same nature with our.
selves. So, also, when two or more doctrines are put to-
gether, from these new relations and combinations will
How out new deductions and conclusions, just as all the

Saltpetre and charcoal, separately, are harmless& com-

" You are right," said the abb. 66 And is not the
whole process of Christian instruction, and of Christian
obedience, such a process of development ? Has Al.

principles of conduct to guide our moral life, and the first
general truths of the Divine nature to embrace in our
intellect, leaving it to our conscience and our under-
standing to draw them out and apply them to our prac.
tice ?"
Villiers assented.
" You teach a child his creed," continued the abb.
" Is he to learn nothing more? You impress on him the
Ten Commandments. Will they alone suffice withou:
some process of development ?"
Villiers shook his head.
" Where, then, do you condemn us," asked the abb,
"if we think, that in the polity of the Church, as in
many portions of its teaching, something, nay much,
may have been left, at the first preaching of the Gospel,
to be expounded and drawn out in succeeding genera.
tions ?"
"Precisely so, precisely!" interrupted Mr. Brook.
" I am delighted to hear you. This is precisely what
we contend for. You think with us, that there is no ne.
cessity to adhere blindly and bigotedly to old formularies
of dogmatic teaching-that new light may from time to
time stream in upon the truth,that we, in fact, in the
nineteenth century, may be much more capable, after
longer experience, and with our increased civilization, of
distinguishing between truth and error than our ancestors
1800 years since. This is the very principle which our
great dissenting divines, and, indeed, all our best modern
philosophers, are anxious to establish, and which what
are called the orthodox churchmen are so peremptory in
condemning."
The abb seemed startled at such zealous approbation
and support from a person whose principles were fully as
obnoxious to himself as they were to Villiers.

ference; it may be necessary that doctrines should be
developed. But it is not the same whether they are
developed by an individual or by the Church. You would
leave them to the tender mercies of private judgment ;

self. With us, this privilege is reserved to a proper ec-
clesiastical authority."
" You object, then," said Mr. Brook, " to our theory,
because it places the determination of truth in the hands
of an individual ?"
" Certainly," said the abb.
" Because," continued Brook, "you think an indi.
vidual is not competent to decide, and that he requires
correction, assistance, external rule ?"
"Certainly."
" And in whom, in the view of a great portion of
your Church, does this power reside ? Is it not in the
Pope ?"
"Certainly," said the abb; "such is the doctrine
of many."
" And in the Pope, as an individual, independent of
Councils ?"
" Not with us," said the abb ; "not with the Gal.
lican Church, but with Jesuits and ultramontanes."
" And you repudiate their view ?" asked Villiers.
" Assuredly."
" And why ?"
" Because I can find no promise made to justify such
an infallibillity."
" Have you not," asked Villiers, "promises as dis-
tinct, and language as decisive, in the opinion of many,
as you have for the papal supremacy generally?"
" We adhere," said the abb," to the practice and
principles of many past generations, in the Church, in
conceding to the Pope great power and authority, though
it may be difficult to limit it precisely.
" But you profess," continued Villiers, " to regard
the whole body of the Church assembled in her Coun-
cils as the authorized expositor and developer of divine
truth-not the individual Pope. The Pope is, with you,
only an important member-a voice in the Church ?"
"Certainly."
" And you condemn and excommunicate us," con.
tinued Villiers, "not because we reject the authority of
the Pope, but because we reject the authority of what you

conceive to be General Councils, and ther fore legitimate
representatives of the whole Church ?"
The abb was unwilling to make the concession, but
could not refuse. He made some observations respect.
ing the importance of recognizing the papal authority as
an element in the tribunal of the Church, but was com-
pelled to acknowledge that it was difficult, or almost
impossible, to define accurately its extent, or to say
when
disobedience became a crime.
" And yet," concluded Villiers, " you do not hesitate
to excommunicate us, and to cut us off from salvation,
because, in our own judgment of the doctrines and prac.
tice of the Primitive Catholic Church, and according to
the practice of our own immediate ancestors, we have
not allowed to the Pope such an extent of prerogative,
in a matter by your own confession never accurately
defined, as he himself would claim. You have done
the same, have you not ? You do not, in the Gallican
Church, allow to him what is claimed by him in Italy.
What right have you to modify or circumscribe his
prerogatives, which we have not in England ? And if
we have committed a deadly sin, are you not guilty like-
wise ? And yet you join in excommunicating us. Is
this Christian ?"
"We are justified," said the abb, " by the general
voice of the Church, which you have rejected."
"I know not," said Villiers, " where you will find
such rejection. It has been our professed and recorded
desire to adhere to the general voice of the Church.
But the voice which we recognize is that of the old
Church of the Apostles, and of the first centuries, not that
of modern days.
And it was not because the Council of
Trent developed Christian truth, but because it altered
and corrupted it, that we discard its decrees."
" You agree, then," said the abb, " that Christian
truth must be developed, and developed by the Church ?"
" Assuredly."
"We have driven away Mr. Brook," remarked the
abb, as that personage retired to join another group at
the other end of the gallery. "Tell me now, for we can

HAWKSTONE.
267
speak more at ease, what are your real objections to our
theory of development."
" First," replied Villiers, "as I before said, that, in
professing to develop, you change and alter. Secondly,
that you claim for those to whom you assign the task of
development an authority and weight as a representative
of the whole Church, when in reality they form but a
part of it. Thirdly, that not content with requiring to
their teaching such amount of moral respect as is fairly
proportioned to the goodness and wisdom of human
teachers, you impose their dogmas as infallible decrees,
and made the reception of them essential to salvation.
Fourthly, that in so doing you transgress the express
commands and warnings of the early Church, which
drew a broad and distinct division between that portion
of the Christian faith which was to be imposed on and
received by all as essential to salvation, and that which,
however true in itself, or correctly deduced from funda-
mental credenda, was not itself established a: fundamental
by God.
Fifthly, that you transgress by the same act not
only the commands of God, but the whole analogy of
the Church. When we would rear an oak, we know
that we must plant an acorn ; and that acorn is itself
the oak in a certain stage of development. But if we
buried a young tree as we bury the acorn, would it
live ? And when we would rear up in the mind of man
the full expansion of Christian truth, we must plant in it
first the general principles, the filaments of all truth,
organized and concentred as in a seed or germ; for
instance, as we find them in the Creed; but not expanded
in a more developed system. In this manner we do not
load the mind with more than it can bear; we do not
exact from it more implicit faith than is necessary ;-
above all, we do not require its assent to the correctness
of the logical faculty in man, as exercised upon Divine
truth, in which attempt it must, by its nature, be liable
to err, and has no guarantee against error from a
Divine promise. We require truth only in historical
testimonythat such and such doctrines have been
received from God. We leave the logical faculty scope

to exercise itself subsequently, and the various ramifi-
cations and details of doctrine to shoot out and grow,
according as they are required, under the care of a
teacher and the labors of the pupil conjointly. But you,
my dear abb," continued Villiers, as he hastened to
close the conversation, on observing the return of Mr.
Brook" you, that is, your Church, would plant in every
mind at once the full grown tree ; and if the mind is
incapable of receiving it, if it hesitates to place as much
confidence in the reasoning of man as in the word of
God, you cut it off from salvation. And thus you
compel the mind either to an unlimited credulity or an
unlimited scepticism. And Romanists, in proportion as
they enter zealously and heartily into the spirit of their
system, and are not saved from it by some happy incon.
sistency, which pepetually embroils and perplexes them,
as in the Gallican Church, must become either infidels
or fanatics."
" And yet," said the abb, "if authority has been
given to the Church thus to develop, and thus to impose
its development on its members
" If !" replied Villiers. " But in that if, how much
is included ! You cannot show me any such anthority
in the Scriptures conceded, to say the least, to any but
the whole Church as the full representative of the Apos-
tolical body; and your Church is but a part. The
Romish see, and those who have acceded to it, form but
a portion of the Christian body, are representatives but
of one Apostle. You cannot produce any such practice
from the Primitive Church ; for I deny that the Nicene
Creed was a development--it was a statement.
no more a development of doctrine than Magna Charta
in its own language was a development of the English
constitution. It was a declaratory law-declaratory of
facts and doctrines already in existence.
And the rea-
sonings of the Council of Nice did not tend to draw out
new positions from the Scriptures, but to justify old.
And if by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit they were
authorised to decide at all on such an essential point as
the amount of credence requisite for salvation, they were
It was
## p. 269 (#281) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
269
6
authorised also to decide that that amount should not be
exceeded. With the anathemas--the most solemn
anathemas-of the Church which you profess to follow
protesting against you, how can you appeal to it? Did
not the half of Christendom separate from you on this
very ground, that you tampered with the creeds ? Either
you are condemned by the voice of the ancient Church,
or, in despising its condemnation, you own yourself to be
a new Church; and with a new Church comes a new
doctrine ; and with a new doctrine where remains the
faith once for all delivered to the saints ?  the tradi-
tions which we are bound to hold fast?' "the Gospel,
one and unchanged, which cannot be preached other
than as it was preached by the Apostle, though preached
by an angel from Heaven ? It is because your doc-
trine of development destroys the very fact of revelation
-because it overthrows the very foundations of truth
and faith, that therefore it is so fearful. And yet upon
it your doctrine of the supremacy is founded, and al
your departures from the faith and practice of the primi.
tive Christianity-departures, as they appear to usare
attempted to be justified. Your worship of saints, your
adoration of images, your terrors of purgatory, the licen-
tiousness of your indulgences, the frightful blasphemy
of your language to the blessed Virgin-everything
which compelled the Reformation, and with the Refor-
mation brought on the frightful excesses to which sec-
tarianism and infidelity have proceeded in these later
times."
" You are still discussing, I find," said Mr. Brook,
as he resumed his position by the side of Villiers with a
mixture of freedom and servility.
66 I must take my
stand with the abb. We find in England that there
are no greater friends to liberty of conscience and gene-
ral toleration than the Catholics."
" Roman Catholics, I must beg to call them," said
Villiers ; " unless, indeed, such a name implies a self-
contradiction."
"Oh !" replied Brook, "I have no objection to any
name. What is there in a name? Words are but

66
signs; and one of the strange absurdities of the present
day is the contest for names.
" You do not think it an absurdity, do you ?" said
Villiers, turning to the abb. " You would not allow
me to call you anything but a Catholic, without remon-
strance, am sure ?"
" Certainly not," said the abb ; " for Catholic is the
title of the Church given to it in the Creed ; and if I am
not Catholic, I am not a member of it."
" And if not a member of the Church," continued
Villiers, " you are not, we shall both allow, an heir of
salvation ? At least, you have no promise or assurance
of it?"
Assuredly," said the abb ; while Mr. Brook lis-
tened with a sarcastic expression of contempt.
You are one, then," said he, " of the new Oxford
schoolthe P
Sir," interrupted Villiers, "I am afraid you are
proceeding to apply to me an expression which I never
permit to be used to me. For the same reason that I
objected to your use of the word Catholic, I must protest
against any one applying to me another word which,
besides that it calumniates a good man as being the
leader of a party in the Church, condemns all who
accept it as being followers of an individual teacher,
instead of being followers of Him whom only we may
recognise as our Master. It is virtually to unchristian-
ize them; at the least it represents them as schismatics.
You will oblige me by never employing it when you are
choosing to describe any religious opinions which you
may suppose me to hold. I beg to wish you good morn-
66
ing."
" You have been rather severe on Mr. Brook," said
the abb, as he took Villiers's arm to assist himself
down the stairs.
"I did not mean to be severe," said Villiers ; I
have no right to be severe on any one.
There is too
much here" (and he put his hand to his heart) " to
humble and shame me, for me to undertake the office
of a censor. And yet I am naturally hasty; and they

271
used to call me haughty. But it certainly is a trial to
me to meet such men; and the present day abounds
with them. I can bear enthusiasm of any kind, for it
must contain good, and only requires to be rightly tem-
pered and directed; but the cold, sneering, unfeeling,
Alippant sophistry which has crept into the spirit of the
day, and which men call liberalism, is---However, we
gain nothing by speaking of it."
" I fear you have offended him," said the abb.
" It is very possible," answered Villiers ; "but I
must risk his offence rather than permit him to indulge
in that tendency to give nicknames, which has done
more harm to the Church, by forcing men into parties
almost in despite of themselves, even than heresy itself.
It is the fomentor of all schism."
"But I thought," said the abb, " that you and all
other Protestants cared little for schism. Surely your
Church is overrun with it ; and what have you done to
prevent it ?"
" My dear abb," said Villiers, " why will you, an
educated, well-informed, and conscientious Christian,
suffer yourself to think and feel of the English Church
as the Romish communion, whether in ignorance or
design, teaches the most violent of her members to
speak; misunderstanding or misrepresenting our princi.
ples, and confounding us with those sectarians who have
gone out from among us, but are not of us ? We, by
the voice of our Church, are as deeply interested in the
cause of unity--are as solemnly pledged to maintain it--
as you are. If we differ in the mode of preserving it-
if we think that the creation of a visible centre of unity
in the person of one supreme bishop is neither consonant
to the divine form of Church polity nor conducive to the
end desired if we would rather adhere to the old apos.
tolical system of the first centuries, than adopt your new
developed theories--and if, owing to your violent attacks
upon us and to our own weakness and individual faults,
we have been unable to retain within our fold a large
number of our sheep, as you yourselves ha re been una.

- this is no proof that we repudiate or despise unity, but
that we have been unwilling to preserve it by a wrong
principle, and unable to preserve it by the right."
" And you will not, then, accede," said the abb,
" to the theory of development ?"
"I think it," said Villiers, " the most insidious,
the most fatal, the most fertile in mischief, of all those
rationalistic principles on which Romanism has built up
its system. Grant this doctrine, and you grant a power
to subvert the faith, to destroy truth, to erect a spiritual
despotism of superstition and tyranny, which must end
in a spiritual anarchy. You grant, I think, the very
principle for which all heretics, and schismatics, and
infidels are clamoring ; and upon it must be charged
those odious excesses and crines which have disfigured
the Christian Church since the Romish supremacy was
established, both in those who have upheld and in
those who have resisted it."
" And yet," said the abb, " you allow the necessity
of some development ?"
" Assuredly !" said Villiers, as they reached the
house, and stopped under the gangway ; "assuredly.
If I were to sum up my own view of it, it would be that
development itself is an operation contemplated by God
himself" (and Villiers removed his hat as he mentioned
the holy name) " in his whole scheme of Christian in-
struction--but development confined properly to the
Church, limited by laws which will prevent it from either
adding, or taking away, or altering, from becoming, in
fact, anything but development--when carried on by
individuals, subject to the watchful control of the Church;
and when enunciated by the Church, to be enunciated
without
any such sanction or enforcement as would
alter the terms of communion prescribed by the Apostles,
or narrow the gates of Heaven, or enlarge the articles
of the Christian faith, which by them were selected as
fundamental, and enforced as essential to salvation. The
Epistles are in this way a development of those forms
of doctrine which were taught to candidates for baptism
before the Scriptures were completed. They were

written by Apostles, of whose inspiration there is no
doubt. And yet even they were not enforced upon
Christians as terms of salvation. The catechumen was
pledged to the Creed, not to the Scriptures. And can a
privilege not claimed by Apostles be claimed by a single
bishop, or by any of their successors ? Let the Romish
Church develop her system of belief as we have devel.
oped ours in our Articles. Let her, if she chooses,
impose her development upon her own clergy and
teachers. She may reason rightly or wrongly, and be
responsible before the Almighty for her error. But she
will not be guilty of the sin with which she is now
charged, of tixing arbitrary conditions of salvation for
which she has no sanction but her own voice, and so
cutting herself off from Christendom by cutting Christen-
dom off from herself. Remove your excommunication,
and
you restore peace and unity to the Church."
The abb sighed deeply. "I fear," he said, " that
these are dreams which can never be realized."
" Let us pray," said Villiers, " that they may
be
realized-realized without compromise of truth.
to earnest prayer who can deny that even this great boon
may be granted by Him who is the  Author of peace
and the lover of concord? But how, I often wonder, how
can you offer to him your prayers for such a blessing,
when
are the daily cause of discord and
confusion ?"
" In what way?" asked the abb.
" In this way," answered Villiers. " You begin
with forming an unauthorized theory of Church unity. To
justify this you are obliged to recur to your theory of
development ; to sanction that, you must claim infalli-
bility, and infallibility being presumed, you cannot es-
cape from intolerance : and thus you place yourselves in
hostility to all around you who are not of you ; and you
introduce enmity, and with enmity persecution, wherever
your faith prevails. For, be assured, it is not possible
for Christians to be deeply and sincerely religious, and
yet to live in love and charity-perfect love and undis-
turbed charity-with those whom they believe to be in

the wilful commission of deadly sin, and abandoning
their own salvation. How can subjects exercise a true
loyalty to a monarch whom they regard as a heretic, and
therefore, perhaps, as worse than an infidel? How can
provinces live together happily and affectionately, as
parts of one and the same empire, when they are dis-
tracted by the claims of a foreign allegiance, involving
the peril of their souls? How can parents and children,
wives and husbands-2" But here Villiers stopped.
A memory of the past came to his mind, and a thought
for the future : and, hastily closing the conversation, he
returned to his room.
CHAPTER XXII.
It often happens that an accidental conversation does
more than weeks of reflection to bring out, and arrange,
and fix principles which shape our conduct through life.
And so it was with Villiers. General, vague, and
desultory opinions, strong, indeed, and permanent, but
not consecutively combined, on the subject of Romanism,
had possessed him for several years. The subject had
occupied his attention, painfully and anxiously, of late.
It had mixed itself with many floating day-dreams. He
felt that it was intimately connected with his future plans
and welfare. But he was remarkable for seizing on the
clue of an argument, and following it out rapidly, and
tracing the connection between its several stages
And his discussion with the abb had led him to a
somewhat connected view of different features in the
system of Romanism, which, separately, he had always
regarded with great aversion. The doctrine of develop-
ment had presented itself to him as a speculative ques.
tion. But excommunication, intolerance, the bitterness
of sorrow, if not of hatred, which the Romish theory
fosters in its children towards all whu differ from them,

:275
and the consequent impossibility of forming any social
union where Romanism is an element amidst contending
systemsthis now pressed upon him with tenfold force.
The remainder of the day after the conversation with the
abb he passed in his own room. It was over the
apartments occupied by the abb, whose own mind was
anxiously engaged in watching every turn of the young
Englishman's opinions and feelings ; and who knew not
whether to augur well or ill for the object nearest to his
heart, as he heard Villiers pacing backwards and for-
wards with an agitated step ; now stopping, as if to
think ; now throwing open his window, as if to calm the
turbulence of his feelings by gazing out on the bright
sky, and cypress terraces of the garden of the palazzo.
More than once the abb caught the sound of a suppresed
groan, as he threw himself on his knees and remained
in prayer,-praying that he might be enlightened in the
truth ; praying as fervently that he might be guided now
in the path of duty, and be enabled to withstand the
strong temptation to which he felt that he was exposed
every day that he remained in a spot where Lady
Eleanor was present. He sent his apologies to the
abb for not joining him at dinner ; and when the abb
ventured to seek him in his own room in the evening, he
met Villiers's servant carrying the letters just arrived from
the post, and preparing his master's travelling apparatus.
" Are you leaving us at once, so soon ?" exclaimed
the abb -- packing up!"
But Villiers did not hear him. He was hastily
opening a letter in Lady Eleanor's handwriting. He
read it; and turning to the abb, said, " I was going
away to-morrow morning ; I have lingered here too
long, and ought to be in England. But this letter must
detain me. My uncle is ill. They are bringing him
here at once, and expect to arrive to-morrow. Of course
I cannot leave him. But," he continued with a deep
sigh, " I must remain here no longer than is absolutely
necessary."
The abb unde 'stood him, and did not press any
explanation.

When Lord Claremont's travelling-carriage drove
into the court-yard the next day, Villiers was on the steps
to receive him. He assisted Lady Eleanor out with
outward calmness ; only she observed that his hand
shook as it took hers, and was withdrawn in a moment.
And her own mind was as much alive as his to every
little sign which might indicate what passed within.
Lord Claremont was assisted to his room. His medical
attendants were soon with him. But when Villiers
waited to see them after their consultation, he was shock-
ed to hear that the illness was of a more serious nature
than had been apprehended, and might probably termi.
nate in paralysis. He was to be watched carefully. The
uncle had done little to win the affectious or command
the gratitude of the nephew. He was a cold, dull, for.
mal, uncharactered man, who seemed incapable of being
touched by anything but the claims of the Whig party
to his vote in parliament, and the influence of his daugh.
ter, to whom he occasionally showed signs of attach-
ment far beyond what could be expected from his selfish,
phlegmatic nature. But Villiers had been taught a les-
He spent the night on a sofa in his uncle's room,
without permitting any one but the servants to know it.
And he was comforting himself while dressing the next
morning in his own dressing-room with the fallacious
hope that the patient was better, when he was alarmed
by the hasty ringing of bells, and the hurry of footsteps
along the passages. Before he could ring to inquire; his
own man knocked hastily at the door, and entreated him
to make haste,-Lord Claremont was in a fit-was
dying. Villiers was in a moment by his bed-side.
The
poor old man lay insensible, and one side of his face
was distorted by a seizure of paralysis. Lady Eleanor,
her hands clasped round him, was chafing his temples,
and though evidently in fearful agony of mind, did not
permit it to render her incapable of giving the requisite
orders. Villiers took his place at her side, assisting her
in all that she did, or hastening the arrival of the phy-
sicians. Half an hour elapsed before they came.
Lord
Claremont showed no signs of recovery, and Lady
son.

277
Eleanor's firmness was evidently giving way. She
neither wept nor spoke, except to ask for something
seemingly required by the patient. But Villiers saw,
by the working of her lips, that the suppression of feel-
ing could not last much longer. The physicians came,
and at their request he led her from the room.
This is not a love-story ; and we have no wish to
involve our readers in the details of love-scenes. Both
Villiers and Lady Eleanor possessed strong minds-
strong both in the energy of their emotions, and in the
control which they exercised over them.
But the strength must have been superhuman which
could have preserved the secret of their hearts wholly
unrevealed from each other at such a moment. Every
word of encouragement and consolation on the part of
Villiers, however anxiously guarded by him, conveyed
volumes to Lady Eleanor's mind. And even the vio-
lence which she put herself on her own feelings, and
the embarrassment with which she listened to him, and
the tremulousness of her voice when she begged him to
return to her father's room and obtain a report from the
physicians, was sufficient to ensure Villiers that hap-
piness was within his reac! , that he needed only to ask
for it and obtain it; but- and with the but, instead of
joy, there came intense risery. He had made no de-
claration. She had uttered nothing like confession. But
both knew what the other felt; and both knew also that
there was a gulf between them which neither could pass.
The first thought of each upon separating was a fear lest
a betrayal had taken placem-a betrayal which, unac-
companied by any farther declaration, might compro-
mise the happiness of the other. The second was a re-
solution to make the explanation instantly, if it could be
done. The good abb was at hand; and he was the
first person to whom, as to her confessor, Lady Eleanor
committed the secret of her affections, entreating him to
take some opportunity without delay of assuring Villiers
of her unalterable resolution never to engage in mar-
riage with one whose religion was different from her

Claremont was better, and the abb insisted on Villiers
leaving the sick room, and coming out for fresh air.
Villiers-distracted, absent, almost vacillating and
recovering from his vacillation only to be filled with re.
morse at his weakness--suffered the good old man to
take his arm. They strolled into the great square; and
the abb led him up into the gallery, as to the place
most likely to occupy and amuse him. He brought him
into the tribune, and soon commenced a conversation
with the young boy whom Villiers had seen there on his
last visit, and who had excited his interest by his skill in
copying the "Si. John." The abb led him on to tell
his story. Villiers became gradually interested in it.
It was a tale not unlike that of his own parents, though
in humbler circumstances. There had been a marriage
between a Romanist and a Protestant--then had followed
the usual estrangement of affection, which ended in bit.
terness and persecution, as soon as religion, which at
first was a mere name both with the husband and the
wife, became a passion and a duty. There had been
the same separation of children---the son following the
faith of the father, the daughter that of the mother.
Then came the sickness of the Protestant father, his
death-bed, and the poor boy's account of his mother's
agony of mind; and the torture and persecution to which
his father was exposed by her relatives, even in his last
moments, to induce him to change his faith, did more
than any arguments could have done to steel Villiers in
his resolution. The father died; the child had received
his last injunctions to remain steadfast in his faith. The
mother, doatingly fond of him, and bent on saving him
from a state, as she conceived, of utter ruin to his soul,
strained every nerve to win him over to her communion.
Her efforts were seconded by all the arts and influences
which could be exerted by the priests with whom she
was surrounded, but in vain. The boy had doted on his
father : his father's last words, last look, the solemnity
and fearfulness of his last hours, had all impressed
themselves indelibly on his mind. He was proof against
reasoning, against prayers, even against his mother's

tears ; until exasperated and in despair, and resolved, at
the suggestion of a priest, to make one final trial of se.
verity, she drove him from her door, and almost threat.
ened to lay her curse upon him. But it was all in vain.
He left her (this had happened in Ireland,) and took
refuge with the clergyman of the parish, who had sup-
ported bim through all his trials. By him the talent
which he possessed for painting had been discovered ;
and he had been introduced to the notice of a nobleman,
who had enabled him to come abroad to study. The tale
was short, simply, but affectingly told. And as Villiers
turned away in thought, the abb made a general re-
mark on the evil and misery of mixed marriages; which
led him to speak of his own particular opinionsof his
own private recommendations to those over whom he
possessed influenceof the satisfaction which he had in
knowing that those in whom he was most deeply inte.
rested-one especially, who was his own chosen charge
(and Villiers understood the allusion), participated fully
in his views, and was unalterably resolved to act on them.
The good abb sighed with affectionate compassion, as
he made the communication ; and there mixed with the
compassion a pang of disappointment at the breaking up
of his most darling hope ; but his conscience reproved
him. And Villiers, thanking him, and giving him to un-
derstand that he comprehended his meaning, assured
him also of his own unchangeable determination to act
upon the same principle, and of his desire that it should
be known.
It had struck twelve the same night ; the light was
still burning in Villiers's room, and his servant was
hurrying backwards and forwards with preparations for
packing, when the abb, to whom a letter had just been
delivered, knocked gently at the door, and hegged five
minutes' conversation.
It was the good old man's last opportunity, his last
effort. Wholly as he had composed himself more than
once to face the disappointment of his dearest hopes, and
to leave Villiers to himself, as the moment of Villiers's
final departure appro iched, he had received another

It was
command from a quarter which he was bound to respect,
and resolved to make one more attempt, to speak openly
and fully, and urge what still remained to be urged, that
the young Englishman might be won over to the Church
of Rome, and (what the abb would scarcely dare to con-
fess to be equally the object of his prayers) might be
united with Lady Eleanor.
no surprise to Villiers to see the abb.
Where minds are severally engaged in the same
thoughts, they fall together into the same acts.
He
placed the abb in an easy chair, sat by his side, took
his hand, and with affectionate respect entreated him to
speak without reserve, if he had anything to commu-
nicate. And the grey light of dawn began to steal in
through the half-closed curtains before that communication
was closed. Villiers, on his leaving the room, threw
himself on the bed, agitated, exhausted, alarmed, uncer-
tain, full of vacillation once more ; and at every wavering
thought came in the vision of Lady Eleanor. He had
gone through the other trials of his faith ; had exposed
the historical fallacies of Popery ; had witnessed and
shuddered at the moral perversions which followed upon
its theory ; had sifted the rationalizing speculations on
which its claims to empire were founded ; one point
remained untouched, and to this the abb had addressed
himself. Villiers closed his eyes ; 'and in a feverish
distracted dream, he fancied himself standing in a vene-
rable cathedral ; the service of the Church of England
fell on his ears. He was kneeling, praying, when the
building shook from its base ; the pillars tottered; the
roof cleft open till the stars were seen through the
crevices ; great masses of mortared stone, fragments
of arches, bosses, columns, tombstones, hurled themselves
around them ; a black chasm yawned beneath the altar
and swallowed it up: the worshippers and priests fled
with cries of terror; and as there gathered round him in
their place a host of frightful demon visages screaming
in triumph, Villiers saw through the distant aisle a
figure--a female figurebeautiful, pure, innocent and
holythe figure by whose side he had watched over

his uncle's bed-beckoning him to escape, and to
escape with her. It was the weakness, the distraction,
the coldness, the irreverence, the approaching ruin of
the English Church, which the abb had bern urging
on his thoughts. A ray of light fell on his eyes, and he
a woke up to the sense of his trial. Alas! how many
bitternesses, how many weaknesses, how many pangs
of remorse and fear crowd often into that moment of
awaking! Till he had raised himself from his pillow,
partially dressed himself, knelt down, read, meditated as
usual, even in spite of wandering thoughts and distracted
affections, Villiers thought of postponing his departure,
of remaining ; of considering all that the abb had
urged, quietly and impartially with him. He would not
see Lady Eleanor, he said to himself, more than was
absolutely necessary. He could command his feelings.
He need not suffer her to know what passed in his own
mind ; and it was cruel to desert her in the moment of
her trial. He was bound to remain with his uncle ; and
to refuse to listen to the truth was obstinacy. He was
bound to give to the objections of opponents a fair and
candid consideration. His hand was on the bell to
countermand his carriage, but his eye fell on the open
Prayer-book on his table--on the words " Lead us not
into temptation ;" and when his servant came, his first
word was to hasten the horses. He went to his uncle's
bed-side, who was still asleep, and much recovered. He
sent Lady Eleanor's maid to ask if she had any com-
mands for England ; but Lady Eleanor only sent a kind
Vorhal message in reply. The carriage drove into the
4ri-yard ; aud when the abb pressed his hand, while
lie yet lingered on the steps, and asked him if he would
think on what he had heard last night, Villiers, with
a deep sigh, replied, "I go to think-go to inquire.-
(tod bless you ; and bring us both to the truth. Drive
And the postillions whirled the carriage through
the gate on its road to England.
As it turned the corner of the street Villiers's eye
caught that of a man dressedit almost seemed disguised

arrived from a long journey, and still in his travelling

" No. 12, one pair of stairs to the left," answered
the obsequious porter, who suspected a stranger of rank,
and proceeded to show him to the narrow archway and
stone stairs which led to Beattie's room. The stranger
tapped, heard the usual words " Come in ;" and as he
stood before Beattie himself, who rose from his large
reading desk, and shaded his eyes from the candle to
receive his visitor, it was some seconds before they
mutually exchanged recognitions.

" Before I answer your questions," said Villiers,
"will you give me some tea ?"
Beattie's tea-things, untouched, stood on a side-table,
and his kettle was simmering on the hearth. And Villiers
was soon installed in a large leather reading-chair, from
which Beattie was obliged to remove its usual occupants,
a heap of follies ; and the solitary reading-lamp having
been exchanged for brighter lights, the simple-minded
Beattie placed his stool by Villiers's side, and asked for
an account of his movements. Villiers repeated to him
everything. When he told him of the recovery of his
fortune, Beattie made no remark, offered no congratula-
tions, only looked on him with more of melancholy,
affectionate interest, as if such an event only exposed
him to more perils and heavier responsibilities. When
he spoke of his feelings towards Lady Eleanor, Beattie
seemed alarmed, but was relieved by the frank and firm
tone in which Villiers declared his resolution never to
unite himself (he was compelled in a low voice to say
" again ") with one who was not united in the same
church communion with himself. But when at last Vil.
liers entered on the subject of his conversation with the
abh, on his doubts, his anxieties, his misgivings, Beattie
covered his face with his hands and sighed deeply.
" Yon saved me once," said Villiers ; " you gave
me peace and satisfaction once : can you give it me
now ?-
-Peace and satisfaction !" he repeated, as if
correcting himself: " alas ! whatever befalls me, that
must be for others."
Beattie did not move. He sat immersed in painful
and anxious thought, sinking, it seemed, as he drooped
his head, under a sense of fearful responsibility. Vil-
liers also was silent. At last Beattie roused himself as
the clock of St. Mary's struck twelve.
" You must leave me now," he said to Villiers,
our hours, you know, do not permit late visitors. You
will breakfast with me to-morrow,

Villiers readily assented ; and at the great gate, to
which Beattie went with him to rouse the sleepy porter,
they parted with a warm but silent pressure of the hond.

now.
When Beattie's servant came to his room the next
morning, he observed that his candle was nearly burnt
out. He must have sat up very late, contrary to his
usual practice. His Prayer-book lay open on the table,
and the pages were still wet with tears. Several
closely written sheets of paper were lying on his desk,
as if he had been striving to collect and arrange his
thoughts. And as the servant knocked at the door of
the little closet which served for his bed-room, he found
him already dressed and at his devotions.
Punctually as the chapel bell commenced he was
taking his usual solitary walk under the avenue of
horse-chestnuts in the garden, when he was joined by
Villiers.
You must take me with you into Chapel," he said.

" And this is owing," remarked Villiers, "to the

" It is owing," said Beattie, " to the good Spirit of
God."
Employing," returned Villiers, " as subordinate

subordinate agency or secondary causes, either in the
Church or in Nature. In either case it tends to reil
from us, or to withdraw us from, the one great Cause.
If we regard ourselves in this light, it engenders either
conceit or timidity; and if others, it gathers us round
them as heads and leaders of party."
" And yet," said Villiers, " you will not deny that

" Assuredly," replied Beattie ; "I honor them my.
self most highly. But you must not forget that other
causes and agencies were in operation at the same time,
without which their efforts would have failed. They
found a field well prepared by others for the seed which
they proposed to sow. The extravagances of an op-
posite system, the rash violence of the enemies of the
Church, the spirit of docility and reverence which cha-
racterises our institutions in this place, were all in their
favor ; but the main arm of their strength was the
Church itself. If they had come forward in any other
character than as her servants, promulgating her avowed
doctrines, sheltering themselves under her authority,
ranging themselves by the side of her great teachers and
masters in days gone by, and promising reverently to
submit themselves to her guidance and control, be as.

for a
more deeply, an i reason more acutely, they have become
generally less attached to their Church ?"
" I think not," replied Villiers.
No," said Beattie, earnestly ; "she may well be
proud of this ; that she holds us in a willing submission
to herself, using no threats, employing no violence-
permitting and encouraging us to examine her declara-
tions freely, and ruling over us, not as a tyrant, but as a
parent. There are some men," he continued, " young
men, very young men, who are clamoring for a sterner,
stricter rule ; for a more imperious, sweeping dogmatism;
more uncompromising exclusiveness. And this
they would call strength and power. But the strength
and power of the Church should be like to that which is
exhibited in the analogy of His works who is the head
of the Church ; and we see nowhere there such marks
of overwhelming despotism. The Almighty sets before
us, in this life, good and evil, blessings and cursings,
truth and falsehood, but permits us to choose, and judge,
and walk in seeming liberty ; and his Church, to be his
minister, must do the same. Too great strictness and
strength in the Church is a sign that there is something
wrong in her constitution or her temperament. There
must be something out of order, some derangement of
forces. But the chapel bell is down. In your time, do
you remember, every one was allowed to straggle in till
the Psalms were nearly over. This, also, you will find
changed in many colleges."
As they returned from the chapel, Villiers could not
help remarking on the improvement which he observed
in the devotional appearance of the young men.
Beattie
corroborated it.
" And do you find," said Villiers, as they sat at the
breakfast-table," that this improvement extends to prac-
tical self-denia! ? Ten years since, if we had been
breakfasting together, as now, on a Friday, we should
not have confined our meal to dry bread ; now, neither
of us feel any difficulty in doing this openly. Is this also
becoming common with the young men ?"
" Not common yet," said Beattie. " But I have ob.

Ten years since I remember a professor of divinity re.
marking to me that there were more dinner parties
among the senior members in Oxford during Lent than
at any other season.
Now I have known many in-
stances of young men giving their large parties early
in the term, that they may not fall during Lent."
"And this is voluntary ?" asked Villiers.
Perfectly so," replied Beattie.
" And done in recognition of the authority of the
Church ?"
"Probabiy," said Beattie ; "for it is done by those
who are not in any way influenced, either by party or
enthusiasm, scarcely by consistent religion, and who,
therefore, can be governed only by a sense of authority.'
Beattie's servant here entered the room with a box, which
had just arrived by the mail.
"I know what this is," he said ; "and you
it opened at once."
Villiers's interest was roused, and his admiration still
more, when Beattie carefully unfolded from its wrappings

gilt, enamelled with Scripture subjects, and inlaid with
gems.
" It is intended," said Beattie, 6 for our college
chapel.
" And from whom does it come ?" asked Villiers.
" This," replied Beattie, "I am not at liberty to
publish. We have fallen latterly into a practice of giv.
ing what we give anonymously, and avoiding subscrip-
tion lists. Ten years since this would have been sent
in the form of a punchbowl, or a coffee-pot, or a silver
corner-dish."
Villiers was silent, but thoughtful. At last he said
" And what is your own opinion of this revival in the
English Church?"
"I lock on it," said Beattie, as the Atheniani
must have looked on the young shoot of olive which
sprang up out of the trunk in the citadel, when it hao
been cut down with axes and burnt with fire. It shows

not only that life is not extinct, but that if not extinct
after such a trial, humanly speaking, there is nothiny
which can extinguish it. It is one of the chief things
which rouses my impatience, when I hear the Church of
England lightly spoken of as weak and perishing."
" And yet other Churches," said Villiers, "have had
their revivals also."
"Surely," replied Beattie ; "the foundation of every
new monastic order in the Romish Church was intended
as a revival. But observe the difference. In other in.
stances the spirit has shot up in some form of novelty; it
has emanated from some individual--has generated a
party. Instead of adhering to existing laws and insti.
tutions, it has delighted to invent new; it has cast off all
restraint, and fed itself with enthusiasm and fanaticism.
Such a revival indicates the weakness rather than the
strength of the body in which it takes place. But the
revival which we have witnessed in our own time has
been, strictly speaking, a revival of the spirit of the
Church, within the Church, under the control of the
Church, encouraged by the niinisters of the Church,
throwing itself back upon the laws and the teaching of
the Church, and placing itself from the first under exter-
nal control and guidance. It is a natural, not an artifi-
cial revival. It has not been produced by stimulants, and
therefore it is as much an evidence of the internal
strength and vigor of the Church as the recovery with.
out medicine of a man at the point of death is a proof of
the strength of his constitution."
" And yet," said Villiers, " the Church of England
since was at the point of death."
So," replied Beattie, " it seemed to us. Threatened
by the people, treacherously protected and corrupted by
the state, robbed of her revenues, mutilated in her
bishoprics, disorganized and enfeebled in those colle-
giate bodies which ought to form her greatest strength,
her authority neither asserted by herself nor recognized
by others, her testimony set aside and supplanted by an
empty rationalism, her education emptied of every thing
which could give it life and power, her churches de

verted, her children running off without a warning voice
into every kind of dissent, and the population swelling
like a running tide around her, and menacing to swallow
her up, like those fabled springs destined to overfl)w
and drown the mortals who forget to keep them under
cover and confined within their proper bounds--such
was the condition of the Church. Who would have
dared at that time to prophesy that it should, within ten
years, simply by the assertion of its own principles, be
more deeply rooted than ever in the affections of its
children, more feared than ever by its enemies, more
able than ever to take its stand as the guardian of this
empire, and to spread out its arm to the most distant con.
tinents as the converter of the heathen ? Yet surely this
is now true."
" And yet," said Villiers, " there must have been
some malformation, some secret mischief, which had re.
duced her to her previous state. Without some radical
defect no Church could so have fallen."
My dear Villiers," said Beattie, after a pause, and
placing his hands on his friend's shoulders, "will you
endeavor to remain for five minutes in this position,
standing upright without moving a single muscle ?"
Villiers stopped (for they were now walking on the
terrace in the college gardens), and endeavored to do so,
but found it impossible.
Or,"
," continued Beattie, " will you try and walk up
to that plane-tree yonder in one straight line without a
single divergence ?"
Villiers shook his head.
No," said Beattie, "it would be impossible ; for
the law of progression, as in human minds, and in indi.
viduals as in societies, is a law of continual oscillation

are human, and cannot escape the m), b by their
recoveries,-recoveries through their own internai
strength, when to common eyes they seemed wholly
lost. Look round on all the churches in the world, on
all civil societies which history presents, and search if
you can find an instance of any human polity recovering
itself from oscillations so fearful as those by which the
English Church has been shaken at times from her
centre. Think what a tremendous shock to all opinions
and all institutions was given by the stroke which severed
her from the tyranny of Rome. And yet, though she bent
for a time beyond her equilibrium, she righted and recov-
ered in her doctrine both the principle of authority and
the talisman of an hereditary Catholicism, without which
she would long since have been fractured to atoms, like
the Protestant communions in Germany.
She was
saved here by the arm of the civil power, which grasped
her (roughly indeed and tyrannically) when she had
shaken off her hold upon the Papacy ; but yet rescued
her from falling wholly into that worst anarchy, the gov-
ernment of self-will. That arm itself was then fractured ;
and the Church fell to the ground, and to human eyes was
utterly destroyed. And yet suffering, and persecution,
and martyrdom, only purified and strengthened it; and
it came out of the convulsions of the rebellion stronger
than beforethe monarchy supported by the Church, and
the Church supported by the monarchy. The Revolution
came ; and the monarchy was split from top to bottom.
It stood indeed, and a superficial view might not detect
the flaw. But the principle of popular election, however
disguised and disclaimed, was admitted into the consti.
tution. And since then the Church has been placed to
contend against it, breaking out as it has done in a
thousand different forms. She has contended with it
under the most difficult circumstances ; her hands tied,
her movements restricted, her principles corrupted, her
resources curtailed, her operations betrayed by the neces-
sity of recognizing a nominal monarchy, which, in reality,
was a democracy. If the monarchy had wholly disap-
peared, her course would have been plain and her oppo.

sition unfettered. But she has fought like a womar
defending her house and husband against robbers ; her
husband himself being all the time one of their accom.
plices, and endeavoring to silence and corrupt her. We
measure strength," continued Beattie, "not by mere
exertion, but by exertion against resistance, and under
disadvantages. Think in this point of view on the very
existence of the Church of England at this day as all but
a miracle."
"And yet," said Villiers, "is not the existence of the
Church of Rome a still greater miracle ?"
"Have you overlooked," said Beattie, " the fact that
the Church of England all this time has been contending
not only with secular powers and popular licentiousness,
but with the strength of the Church of Rome, put out to
crush her as its most dangerous opponent; disguising
itself under every variety of form, and ransacking all its
resources ? Are you not aware how much of the popular
movements against the Church of England has been
fomented by Rome? how earnestly Rome has bent her-
self to destroy us? and still we are not yet lost. Every
fresh degree of power which you think you recognize in
the Church of Rome is another attestation to the strength
of the Church of England, which, single-handed, has
resisted and survived such aggressions."
66 And yet," said Villiers, "think of the enormous
power-of the wonderful organization of the Church
of Rome. Where are we to find this in the Church
of England ? Look at her monastic orders, at her disci.
pline, at her influence on the people, on kings, on learning,
on education, on all that gives power to rulers. Surely
the Church of England, by her side, is as an emaciated
sick man or a mutilated cripple."
" Emaciated she is," said Beattie ; mutilated she
has been. She is weak, and will long continue so-
weak as Samson before his hair grew againas Achil.
les robbed of his arms as the Giant blinded for the
moment. But if even in her weakness she has fought
with the strong arm of popery, and not been yet destroyed,
what will she do in her strength ?''

" And yet," replied Villiers, " surely there is in po.
pery a principle of power and of permanence which no
other polity can realise. Think of the concentration of
its forces round one centre ; of its unity of action ; of its
emancipation from all secular control ; of its sternness,
its exclusiveness, its uncompromising demand of subjec.
tion, its unflinching singleness of aim, the enthusiasm
which it contrives to awaken, both in the ambitious and
the devout ; of its command over the imagination, of the
elasticity of its practice coupled with the immobility of
its theories. Remember how amidst all her errors, and
worse than errors, she preserves axioms of truth, and
misleads her followers chiefly in questions of fact, which
they are unable to examine. Observe how she bends
to her purpose every passion of human nature ; how she
unites the most licentious indulgence with the most
intolerant asceticism. Weigh well the power that lies
even in the extravagance of her claims to empire over
both mind and body ; and when you reflect on the wil.
lingness of weak man to fall down and become the slave
of any one who professes power to govern, and willing-
ness to save, and a divine commission to justify his acts
and fulfil his promises, will you venture to indulge hopes
that any such power can ever be developed in any other
Christian communion, much less in the Church of Eng.
land, which from the very nature of its constitution is
distracted between double principles, and encumbered

" Villiers, dear Villiers," said Beattie, " have you
not shifted your ground ? You have spoken of the
strength of Rome, most truly. But when
you
ask if
such a strength can ever be developed in the Church of
England, tell me, would you wish that it should be de-
veloped ? When I speak of strength in the Church, I
speak of such a strength as a Christian may pray for,

maniac, though a maniac be stronger than a giant. And

Rome, I answer, God forbid ! fr I know not how such
an object could be accomplished without her construct-
ing a system equally false, equally sinful, equally un-
christian. Be assured that truth, that goodness, that
reason, that Christianity, must in this world appear weak
and wavering, compared with bold, unscrupulous, unbal-
anced vice. It must recognize a whole circle of duties,
and this must beget occasional doubt and timidity. It
must be humble, and therefore want self-confidence. It
must cling earnestly to truth ; and truth, in this world of
darkness, lies beneath a veil, and can neither be com-
prehended by our own eyes, nor exhibited to others, ex-
cept mixed up with seeming inconsistencies, which des.
troy its fascination, and perplex and repel those who are
easily attracted by the seeming simplicity of falsehood.
It owes allegiance to an external law, which law is often
difficult to consult, and still more difficult to nnderstand
in its precise application. Hence it must be slow and
submissive. It is passionless, and will seem to want
energy. It is disinterested, and therefore without the
stimulus of selfishness. It is as a stranger in the world,
and the world will not cling to it. It has faith, and there.
fvre despises and throws aside the instruments of human
power. It has no object but obedience upon earth ; and
the voice of a martyr at the stake will sound to human
ears far fainter than that of a conqueror on a field of
battle. And yet, Villiers, strength, real strength, may
be found, even in this form, far greater than in the shape
of an uncompromising, universal, infallible, spiritual em.
pire, which has no foundation for its power but ambition
and intrigue. Look up," continued Beattie," at that
beautiful spire," and he pointed to the spire of St. Mary's,
which rose above them into the clear blue sky from the
midst of its forest of pinnacles. "If you saw two men,
one hurling himself down headlong from the summit of
that spire, and another balancing himself on the point, in
which would you recognise more strength ?"
* Certainly," said Villiers, "I should see no proof
of strength in the act of falling."

object, nor in the carrying out of a single principle, nor

rannical punishment upon all who disobey our will, nor
in any excess or extravagance, whether of reason or of
affection, in which the mind is possessed and carried
away by an idea, instead of possessing and subjecting it
to the control of strict external laws. Even so it is with
the Church of Rome. Its very unity is the proof of
its weakness. It has no doubts ; it admits no opposition;
it sets itself no bounds; it is without scruple, without
hesitation, without difficulty; it can adapt itself to all
circumstances, carry out its one unvaried purpose by any
means, resolve any perplexities, fathom any problem, in-
dulge any inclination, enrol in its body any variety of
character; and therefore, with the physical strength of
a giant it has the moral weakness of a child : and moral
strength and moral weakness are the objects to which
we must look in the constitution of a church.
But a
church which, while it asserts its own independence and
authority, can submit itself to the authority of another
power as equally ordained of God, which can break loose
from a tyranny without falling into a democracy, which
can demand obedience to authority while it exercises and
encourages free thought, which can decide on necessary
questions without intruding on things unnecessary, which
can hold fast an unwavering faith while it disclaims any
right to dogmatise presumptuously, which can feel and
act upon the sense of error and wrong in others, and
yet shrink from harshly judging and condemning them,
which can reverence antiquity and yet admit of improve.

truths, that while equally supported by authority they are
difficult to reconcile by reason, and which will open its
arms to receive her children, not upon terms of her own
invention, but upon the terms prescribed to her by
another,such a church, I conceive, in the very doubts
which she acknowledges, even in the seeming incon.

self-command, a power of vision, and a power of action,

tion. It has pleased Almighty God to place the Church
of England upon the pinnacle of his temple, where he
placed his Catholic Church of old ; and so long as she
is there supported, though with a bruised foot, and trem-
bling hand, and fearful eye, so long I recognise in her
a power which cometh from above, and which none but
God can supply to his own chosen and favored servants."
"And yet," repeated Villiers-(after they had stood
some minutes by the side of the plane tree, from
which a large arm had been recently severed)"and
yet the Church of England is weak; we cannot deny it."
"Yes," replied Beattie, "weak in her organization;
not weak in her principles, or her formularies, or her
theory. In these, for all practical purposes, she possesses
greater elements of power and durability even than the
Church of Rome. Look, for instance, at the very fact
which is too often fixed on as a blemish, and as a source
of imbecility. One of her first fundamental principles
is obedience in all temporal matters to the civil power.
While she asserts her own independence and supremacy
in spiritual things, she allows an independence, and
supremacy, and divine right, to the State in temporals.
Logically, the position is a paradox ; superficially viewed,
it threatens to enslave her. And yet what is the truth?
If you would plant any institution or polity firmly upon
the ground, you must place it upon two foundations. It
must have two feet to rest on, that when one gives way,
or slips, as in this world it always will do, the other may
recover it. Rest all upon a single power, embark all
on a solitary plank, and when that fails all is lost. Thus
in the English Church, allied as she is, or associated, or,
rather, combined and amalgamated, with the State, when
the State becomes weak, or corrupt, or fails in its duty,
the Church is ready to support and correct it. And when

66
the Church is exposed to mischief, then the State is
ready to interfere. We may not be able to measure
precisely the right degree to which these interferences
should be carried. Certainly in all such exigencies there
will be occasional excesses. But through these succes.
sive oscillations the right line may still be preserved ;
and the history of the English Church, the history of
its extension, of its prosperity, of its durability, is to
be traced through a series of actions and counteractions
between the State and itself, and so will continue until
some rash and foolish hand severs the two ; and both
spiritual and temporal power, left to themselves, will fall
without an arm to save them."
I understand you so far," said Villiers. "But if
this double power, this binary construction of influences,
is essential to the preservation of a polity, how is it that
the Church of Rome has maintained her position with
her perfect unity and simplicity of system ?"
Beattie paused, as if in surprise.
" And have you,
then," he asked, " been so blinded by the professions
of Rome as not to see that she also has acted upon the
binary principle, and by it has consolidated her power,
and maintains her existence? What would Rome have
been if she had not employed the civil arm in the first
period of her history? How did she prosecute her ag.
gressions except by the aid of a power which derived
its forces from a source different from her own ? It was
not the bishops of Rome who conquered the empire of
popery, but the bishops of Rome allied with kings and
emperors, who, even while they acted as the ministers of
a church, claimed to themselves supremacy in the state.
Rome indeed boasted, and demanded, and pretended to
rights and authority far beyond the Church of England,
or the Catholic Church of old ; but whenever she prac-
tically succeeded in her objects, it was by an alliance
with some civil power, upon terms as near as possible
the same as those which we recognize in England. And
when the State became weak and impotent, or rebellious,
and unwilling to do her bidding, to what other machinery
do you attribute the power of Rome ?":
## p. 297 (#309) ############################################
AWKSTONE.
297
"Undoubtedly," replied Villiers, - to her monastic
bodies ?"
" Yes," continued Beattie, " to her monastic bodies,
beginning from the first societies of recluses and penitents
to the last grand and fearful conspiracy of Jesuitism.
And what are they but a civil poweran organization,
framed as it was by Rome independent of the regular
government of the Church, having a power of its own,
and a power founded on temporal privileges and posses.
sions--on wealth, character, landed property, talent,
combination, every thing secular? No, Villiers, do not
dream of a state of things in which a spiritual power can
exist detached from a temporal power in some shape or
other, or a temporal power detached from a spiritual.
Keep them combined, yet distinct ; subject them one
to the other, mutually and reciprocally ; be not afraid
of the logical paradox, but try the construction prac-
tically, and you will find it the only source of strength
and permanence."
56 Alas !" said Villiers, 6 where is it to be found
now in the English Church ? Has not the State all but
cast it off? Will she not soon be compelled to stand
before the world with only her spiritual blessings, and
spiritual menaces to overawe her rebellious children ?
And when she is thus left solitary, upon your own princi.
ple and prophecy, what is to be her fate but ruin ?"
Beattie made no reply; but he took Villiers's arm,
and led him out of the gardens into the quadrangle,
and up a flight of narrow stone steps, which landed
them on the leads of one of one of the highest towers in
Oxford.
" Look round you," said Beattie.
And Villiers did look, and gazed with admiration on
that glorious maze of spire, and pinnacle, and turret, and
dark cloistered courts, in which lay green lawns and trim
gardens embedded like jewels, every stone calling up
some recollection of the past, and even the abodes of
common life tinged by them with a sacred gloom.
" Have you ever thought," said Beattie at last, " to

No," replied Beattie, "it was not Oxford-not the
university only, but the colleges of the university, whichi,

The university is a creature of the crown, and can be
destroyed by the crown. He that makes can unmake

these colleges, that the colleges, and through them the
university, were enabled to resist the tyranny and folly
into which democracy would have driven the State, and
turned its aggressions against the Church. But for these
colleges all would have been lost."
" And how," asked Villiers, " do you connect this with
our past conversation ?"

enemies of that Church from without, speak contempt.

These are the piles and buttresses by which we may

and stretched out wherever the work of the Church
is to be done) with which that work is to be accom-

compressing all but Villiers's little finger, he sail,

" Now try with that little finger to force this iron bolt
incu its staple."
Villiers tried, but in vain.
" Grasp it," said Beattie," with your whole hand,

place..
CHAPTER XXIV.
Dax after day passed, and Villiers found himseli still
lingering at Oxford, sharing Beattie's simple breakfast,
ilccompanying him in his evening walks by the side of
the river, dining with him in the hall, and kneeling beside
him in the chapel. He saw few persons beyond the
ordinary society of the common room, for Villiers was
not fond either of exhibiting or being exhibited, or seeing
others exhibited. He had little curiosity to see men who
ivere talked of in the world, merely that he might ob.
serve their countenances, or watch for some peculiarity
of manner or expression, or be enabled to say that he
knew Mr.
m., and Dr.
and Mr. ;
his
knowledge being confined to the formal generalities of a
morning visit. And he cherished a painful impression
that where the thoughts of men are laid open to the
world in their writings, it is as well not to seek for more
close intimacy, lest valuable illusions should be destroyed,
and inconsistencies of conduct be discovered. It may be,
chat Villiers was too proud and independent either to
jead or be led. In the mean time he made his obser-
vations. He remarked in the habits of the place a return
to more simple living ; conversation was more deeply
imbued with a reverential and religious tone. As he
passed through the dark quadrangle at night, he heard
less frequently than in his own daysfar less frequently
-the sound of noise and revelry. The general deport.
ment of the older members truck him as far more

spiritualized and elevated ; and that of the young a
more chastened and subdued. There was much indeed
to please him in the whole tone of the society into which
he was thrown, and in which he was received at once
with a frankness and courtesy, which, while it recog
nized his own rank, asserted also a rank and independence
of their own for those who paid it. And yet, thought
Villiers, these men, in this age of wealth and adoration
of wealth, in which every man's consequence is measured
by his money, possess perhaps only an annual pittance,
scarcely sufficient for the ordinary comforts of life.
Villiers did not remember, that though individually poor,
collectively they were rich, and that while their own
poverty secured them from conceit, their corporate wealth
gave to them a consciousness of position and self-
consequence which secured them from humiliating
dependence. Villiers was surprised to see the genera:
similarity of opinion which prevailed among them, com-
bined with independence of thought. He watched with
pleasure the little interchanges of courtesy which pre.
vented the familiarity of friends from sliding into too
great a liberty. He saw the power which united action
gave them, both in the work of education and in the
furtherance of any object necessary for the good of the
Church. Especially he was struck with the voluntary
deference and respect paid to the head of the society in
which he was living ; and with the absence of all
pretension, or selfishness, or conceit, even in those whose
talents and position claimed for them the greatest autho.
rity. He was even amazed at the liberality. the profusion,
with which demands of charity were answered from men
who had nothing to depend on but their little annual
stipends. When he remarked these things to Beattie,
and asked to what cause he could attribute it, Beattie's
reply was still the same, "to the collegiata principle."
Place men in colleges, he would say, place those colle.
ges under a good system, and let that system he subjected
to a proper superintendence from the bishons of the
Church, and you will form men like these every whare.
" And yet," he continued, with a sigh, "even here

all is not right. There is much still to be done to bring
us to a perfect state, many good practices to be recalled,
many forgotten statutes to be enforced ; and the stream
which was flowing so steadily and so rapidly in this
direction of improvement has met a check, which will
throw it back for years. You observed," he said, "a
specimen of the mischief at work yesterday after
dinner.
"Do you allude," asked Villiers, " to that forward
conceited person who spoke so fluently and so petulantly
in the common room, on the subject of Popery and the
Church?"
** That," replied Beattie, "is one of the leaders,
if such a boy can be called a leader, in the new move-
ment. He has written much which has startled and
alarmed us.
" But he has only just taken his degrees," said
Villiers, with astonishment.
" Not long since," replied Beattie ; " but in this day,
when every one can publish what he likes, and as he
likes, and when he likes, and publish anonymously, it is
in the power of mere boys to circulate doctrines and
rouse fears, the mischief of which cannot be cured by the
oldest and the wisest."
"And when he was speaking so contemptuously of
the Church, and so boldly in excuse for the corruptions
of Rome, was he speaking," asked Villiers, "merely
sentiments of his own, or such as others would share with
him?"
" Sentiments, I hope," replied Beattie," which
only a few-a very fewwould respond to ; but still
be traced even here. But you have been
abroad, and are not well read in the theological public
cations of the day. And yet," he continued, " I fancied,
when you first came to me the other evening, that you
had fallen in with them, and had been yourself tainted
with this new poison."
Beattie covered his face with his hands as he had
done before, and orc? more seemed lost in painful and
anxious thright.

"And what then," asked Villiers, gently, "is this
new theory at which you are so much alarmed ?
Surely such a person as that young man in your com-
room cannot be an object of anxiety. Surely
and others like them, who originated
the movement in the Church, cannot have abandoned it
to such hands, and cannot be unable to control it ?"
Beattie sighed deeply. "I will not reply to your
last question," he said, "because I could not speak
without seeming to condemn; and to condemn is not my
place. We are responsible for all our deeds, for our
silence as well as for our utterance, not to individual
brethren, but to the Church and to its lead."
" And what then," continued Villiers, drawing
his chair nearer
to his friend-- what is this new
theory, or heresy, or what may it be called, which so
alarms you ?"
" Alarm," replied Beattie, " is not perhaps the proper
word. We have no right to be alarmed at any thing
which befalls the Church, in which all that happens
must ultimately work together for its good. Call it
rather vexation ; for so much of these extravagances
proceeds from a silly love of notoriety, that I am afraid
to dignify it with too much attention."
" And what is the nature of the extravagance ?"
asked Villiers. But before his companion could reply,
a step was heard at the door, a submissive knock was
given, and on Beattie's giving the usual permission to
enter, a stout, thick-built, swarthy man, with sunken
and cunning eyes, and his features covered with a
thick beard and enormous whiskers, put his head in, as
if afraid to venture without reconnoitering his ground.
Villiers turned to see his entrance, and as the man's
eye fell upon him he hastily retired, muttering an apo.
logy, and saying that he would return when the gentleman
was disengaged. And though Beattie called after him
to enter, he hurried hastily down the stairs.
66 Who is that man ?" asked Villiers. " Have I not
seen his face before ?"
" He is a stranger to me," said Beattie ;

303
foreigner, I suppose, with a petition. But I was about
to tell you something of our new heresies here." Villiers
resumed his attention, and Beattie proceeded.
" I need not tell you, Villiers, how natural it is, when
power is used against us unjustly and tyrannically, to
rise against it with resentment, and not content with
throwing it back within due bounds, to annihilate it
altogether. None of us should be surprised that the
aggressions of the State upon the Church within these
few years should have produced a tendency in the Church
to reciprocate an aggression upon the State. Perhaps
the seat and beginning of this mischief may be traced to
a dream of spiritual empire and ambition, fostered by the
just claims which the Church has revived to her spir-
itual independence and authority, but exaggerated far
beyond the sanction either of history or reason, and
exaggerated by the natural provocations caused by the
alternate imbecility and violence of our civil govern-
ment. There is a struggle to place the Church once
more in a position of power. It is felt, felt most truly,
that there can be no peace for the country, no safety for
truth, no right encouragement for goodness, no strength
in the government, until the spiritual authority of the
Church is once more recognized. To re-establish it, it
is not necessary to subvert the authority of the State ;
but
young,
rash men, once possessed with an idea, are
carried away by it. They would make the Church the
only power, and subject the State to her. To do this
they must divest the State of its own sacred character
and divine institution ; and they hesitate less at this
profanation, because the powers that be are now wielded
by the populace ; and thus their very hatred for demo-
cracy leads them to adopt the worst theory of democracy,
and, like the Jesuits, they become at once political
radicals and spiritual despots."
Villiers recalled his conversation with Macarthy, but
remained silent.
"When," continued Beattie, "they look round for
means to realize this dream of ecclesiastical empire, they
see that in each single ration the civil power must be

IIAWKSTONE.
stronger than the Church. The only hope for the
Church in such a struggle must be in a close union with
other foreign Churches. Hence the vision of a so-called
Catholic Church, not distributed into various branches
connected at one root, harmonizing in essential articles
of faith, communicating in all works of love, but gathered
round one visible local centre, and formed into a mon-
archy upon earth."
It is a vision," said Villiers, " very natural, very
romantic ; far more easily understood, and seemingly
far more capable of realizing the ends of the Church,
than the true doctrine of a Catholic body, ramifying from
one root, and each branch retaining its individual ex-
istence together with its corporate unity."
" And it fails," said Beattie, "only in a few points
--that it has no sanction in the primitive constitution
of the Church, and on examination is discovered to be
as unsound in theory as it has been proved to be mischiev.
ous in practice."
" It may be so," sighed Villiers.
"But the dream," continued Beattie, "has been once
realized-realized in the papacy ; and hence their eyes
are turned to Rome with a strange mixture of envy and
wonder."
" And this accounts," said Villiers, " for the soft and
gentle terms in which they speak of Rome ; for their
unwillingness to believe ill, or to hear ill, of her."
" Yes," said Beattie ; " while they do not hesitate to
exhaust ridicule and reproach upon the follies of what
they think the opposite extreme (though it is in reality
the same), while they anathematize every thing like
private judgment, self-will, disobedience, want of faith,
irreverence to antiquity, they know so little of the real
history and nature of Popery, and are so completely
blinded by its pretensions, that they would throw a veil
over all the enormities into which popery has fallen by
precisely the same vices, and seem totally ignorant that
the whole of popery (so far as it is a development of the
doctrine of a universal spiritual monarchy) is only
a pre-development of the spirit of dissent -just as

the tyrannies of Greece were identical with their
democracies. "
** Something of this tendency," said Villiers, "was
observable, was it not, in the very earliest writings of
the Oxford school ?"
" Something," answered Beattie. " But it seemed
excused by the violent, thoughtless abuse, which Puri-
tanism had heaped even upon the Catholic parts of the
Romish system, and therefore upon our own Church. It
was necessary to defend what was true in popery. And
we tolerated it more readily from the excess of our
aversion to liberalism, which was then triumphant, and
because the apology for the good parts of popery was
coupled with the most unflinching denunciations and
warnings against the evil."
" And this," said Villiers, "has now been changed ?"
" It has," said Beattie. 66 Followers have learned
to speak softly and gently of every thing in that system,
and leaders have uttered no warning against it."
" And yet," asked Villiers, " however fair and spe.
cious the papal supremacy may be in theory, how is it
that men who are acquainted with the history of the
Primitive Church, and who appeal to its authority, can
reconcile themselves to such a palpable usurpation and
novelty ?"
" In the first place," said Beattie," they are young
men, and not learned men. Their knowledge of eccle.
siastical history is limited, for the most part, to modern
compilations ; and those compilations they have chosen
to sgek in writers of the Romish communion. As for
any deep and accurate knowledge of ecclesiastical an-
tiquity, or the writings of the Fathers, it would be absurd
to expect it from men only a few years emancipated from
their boyish studies, and most of them more disposed to
talk and write than to read and think."
" And yet," said Villiers, "they must have some
knowledge of history ; they cannot be so utterly and
absurdly ignorant as not to know that the Romish supre.
macy is a novelty, and is allowal to be such even by
their own controversialists,"

one
They have two theories," replied Beattie ;
derived from one Romish authority, and the other from
another. One is the right of development; the other,
that even vsurpation may be justified by prescription.
They have fallen thus, in the former, into the worst doc.
trine of the liberalism of the day, in opposition to which
the movement commenced : and in the latter they not
only show themselves ignorant of the fact that in the
English Church the papal usurpations can claim no pre-
scription, because they were constantly protested against,
but they also put forward a maxim utterly destructive of
the very foundations of the Church, and of all positive
institutions of God."
Villiers sighed. " But," he continued, after a pause,
" if these men hold this theory, they must consider
separation from Rome not only as inexpedient, but as
criminal. They must not only condemn the Reforma-
tion and the Reformers, but they must be anxious to
restore the English Church to the Romish communion
without delay."
"Such, I believe," said Beattie, " is the case. Re-
member I am not speaking of any individuals. I will
not be led into imputing motives, or censuring con-
duct, in others ; much less do I mean to say that such
notions are general ; but in some I do believe they
prevail."
" And they must believe," added Villiers, " that the
English Church, on being severed from Rome, forfeited
many great privilegesperhaps even her sacramental
power. Can it be otherwise ?"
** I," said Beattie, " could not find any way out of
this dilemma, which would not also justify every kind of
dissent. But others may. At least I trust they have
some honest solution of the problem, otherwise I cannot
understand that they should be able to remain, as they do,
in the Church of England.
Surely," said Villiers, " you do not mean to say,
that any man, seriously and firmly embracing such a

of the Sacraments, and therefore for salvation? how, even,
can they desire it on the ground of expediency, without
striving to accomplish it? and how can they strive to
accomplish it while remaining within the bosom of our
own Church ?"
"You might have added," said Beattie, necessary
for the validity of their own orders."
" Their own orders !" exclaimed Villiers, springing
up,-"" their own orders! Do you mean that any English
clergyman, any honest man holding such opinions, can
.:ontinue to exercise his functions?"
Beattie sighed deeply:
Seriously," resumed Villiers, " would you have me
believe that there are men, clergymen in the English
Church, who not only profess such doctrines, but, profess-
ing them, think it possible to retain their commission in
that Church, and secretly to use their influence for
bringing it over to popery?"
" You ask me questions," said Beattie, 66 which 1
would rather not answer : but I know that it is not
impossible for clergymen in the Church to hold these
opinions, and to remain exercising their functions in it,
pon the ground that subscription to the articles of that
Church is not incompatible with a recognition of the
Tecrees of the Council of Trent."
Villiers sat for some time silent, as if struck with
amazement.
" Beattie," he said, at last, "what would our courts
of law say to an officer in the Queen's service, who,
when a French army was invading this country, should
not only, as a theory, think subjection to France desi
rable, but should also conceive it his duty to further that
object by every means in his power, especially by the
influence which his commission gave him with the
soldiers of his regiment ?"
6. That he was a traitor," said Beattie.
" And what," continued Beattie, "if, instead of going
over at once to the enemy, he remained under his colors,
only secretly and fraudulently throwing out insinuations,
and projecting plans, and cari ying on correspondences

and assinulating his practices to those of the enemy,
and endeavoring to discontent his soldiers with their
position by repeated sarcasms upon England, and pane-
gyrics upon France, and lamentations over the struggle
by which the freedom of England was to be maintained !
What if he defended hiinself with alleging that he could
not act as an individual, that he waited till the whole
army should throw down their arms, and that in the mean
time he felt himself at liberty to prepare and stimulate
them gently so to do? What if he satisfied his con-
science by pleading that the good of England was his
only object, though he fancied that good to lie in enslave.

"I should say," exclaimed Villiers, interrupting
himbut he checked himself. "No, Beattie," he said
after a pause, " let us not judge others, lest we be
judged ourselves. Let us leave such men, and such
consciences, to the judgment of One who sees the heart,
and to whom they are responsible. I dare not judge
any one."

They did not meet again till the bell was ringing for the
hall dinner. There was but a small party ; and as they
assembled round the great Gothic fire-place, while the
servants were carrying the dinner to the high table,
Villiers was introduced to a foreigner, a French abb,
who had been invited by the same young man whose for-
ward and rash language had attracted his observation on
a previous day. The abb was evidently a man of edu.
cation, quick and acute in his remarks, and keenly bent
upon observing everthing that passed. His manner af
fected a politeness which bordered upon fulsomeness ;

and he showed particular anxiety to become acquainted
with Beattie, and to draw him into conversation. He
threw out many inuendos and covert suggestions, which
might have led to the subject which generally occupied
attention, namely, the state of the Church in England;
but Beattie quietly permitted them to drop, and turned the
conversation to questions of general literature. The
abb was not to be repulsed. He ventured, at last, to
make comments on the characters and writings of some
of the most conspicuous among the leaders of the Ox.
ford movement; and, with a want of tact not unfre.
quently found in a maneuvring mind, he even boldly
questioned Beattie on his own opinions. This took
place in the Common Room ; but Beattie made some
excuse for going to the other side of the fire-place, and
rang the bell for coffee, while the abb, a little discom-
fited, threw himself upon Villiers with similar curiosity,
but was once more defeated by Beattie returning to
Villiers ; and pleading business with him, he took him
to his own room.
" You seemed very reluctant to gratify the abb,"
said Villiers, as they ascended the stairs.
"Very reluctant ?" answered Beattie. "I am not
satisfied with his appearance; and I do not like the ad-
mission amongst us of foreigners of the Romish commu.
nion, who come without introduction and without object,
as far as they profess, but who, I cannot but suspect, are
acting as spies upon all that passes among us at this crit.
ical moment. I am not fond of meeting them myself,
still less of introducing them to our general society, where
we speak often unguardedly, as round our own fire-sides,
while, in reality, we are in a public room, and open to
the observation of strangers In addition to this, I en-
tertain a most serious objection to associating on terms
of familiarity with Romanists. They believe us heretics;
we believe them in this country to be at least schismatics.
In general society we must lay aside the appearance of
such a belief, and act hypocritically; and the hypocrisy
often ends, with us at least, in the opinion that our dif.
ferences are of no moment."

" And would you act in this exclusive manner to all
who differ from you in religion ?" said Villiers.

selves members, and who do not allow myself to be a
member, of the Catholic Church. I know
no other
bond of union in society to which we can trust but the
bond of the Church. And I am sure that to confine our-
selves within the limits and combinations which she has
formed for us is a far safer and a far better security for

overlook these party-walls; and frame a new heteroge.
neous body upon no principle but that of arbitrary fusion,
and the negation of all positive truth. But in the case of
Romanists," he continued, " the inducements to this
caution are, with me, far stronger than with any other
sectarians. I have studied the history of Popery, and
cannot but regard it in the light of an aggressive intri.
guing conspiracy, aiming at universal empire--an em-
pire professedly spiritual, but essentially secular. I speak,
remember, of the popery of Rome ; not of the catholic
elements of truth and goodness which it contrived to
preserve in its system. I know that at this moment, as
often before, the agents of Rome are exerting their ut-
most efforts to embarrass the English Church ; that they
have emissaries in every part of the empire; that their
operations are not confined to doctrinal discussions, but
are deeply mixed up with political movements, even with
insurrectionary disturbances, in England as well as in
Ireland. Such has been their conduct at all times ; but
the present is a favorable moment, and they are turning
it to their purpose with more than common enterprise
and assiduity. There are a few persons among usthe
persons of whom we spoke this morningwho laugh at
all such suspicions, and seem to take delight in playing
with firebrands, and walking about blindfold on the edge
of a precipice. Whether they are right or wrong, time
will show. In the mean time, I avoid, as much as pos-
sible, the society of foreign popish priests. We cannot
meet for controversy ; and I can hold no other voluntary
correspondence with the avowed enemies of my Church

311
but controversy. Where, indeed, a person of a different
cominunion comes and asks for a serious discussion upon
any difficulties which may occur to him, the case is dif:
ferent. For instance, that Jewish-looking man who
came to my rooms the other morning. I like neither
his looks nor his manner; but I have not hesitated to
see him more than once.
" And who is he?" asked Villiers. "I caught but
one glimpse of him, and fancied I had seen him before."
" He tells me," said Beattie, " that he is a Polish
Jew; that he was at Rome (perhaps you may have seen
him there) ; and that a Father Matthias, of the English
college, converted him to Romanism, He became,
however, dissatisfied with what he heard and saw of their
system, particularly with their adoration of images, and
came to England. And here, he says, he has met with
such a number of sects among Protestants, and has been
so harassed by the doubts and difficulties which they
have raised against each other, that he is even thinking
of returning either to Judaism or Popery, if he cannot
be satisfied with the doctrines of our own Church."
Villiers shook his head. "Not a very promising state
of mind," he said.
"I fear not," replied Beattie. " Indeed, few states
could be more unpromising. And there is something in
his look so full of cunning, and, at times, even of malig-
nity, that I should refuse to have any thing to say to him,
except that I do not like to omit any opportunity of pos-
sibly doing good. He seems remarkably anxious to hear
my opinions on Popery, and is at times very abusive
against it himself, with the view, I am inclined to think,
of trying if I am willing to defend it."
" Has he asked for money ?" said Villiers.
" No," answered Beattie. " Had he done this, I
should be inclined to suspect at once that he belonged
to a class of swindlers who not unfrequently obtain ac-
cess to us here under pretence of religious difficulties or
persecutions, and seldom fail to prey upon our unsuspi-
cious benevolence. But he describes himself as provi
ded with means of his own."

Villiers shook his head again. " I confess," he said,
" that, were I you, I should be even more on my guard
against such a man than against an avowed foreign
ecclesiastic. When I was in America I became ac.
quainted with a person who, from circumstances, had
been thrown very much behind the scenes with the
emissaries of Rome. He mentioned to me several in-
stances where most serious evil had resulted from their
intrigues."
Beattie sat musing for some little time. "I scarcely
needed," he said, " this caution.
But many
similar facts
are known to me, and, I assure you, I am on my guard.
And now let us turn to a more agreeable subject. While
I am making tea, will you find out that noble passage of
Burke, in his  French Revolution, where he speaks of
the destruction of the monasteries, and of the value of the
principles of incorporation in the Church, and in society
generally ?"
66 Can it be so late ?" said Villiers, while they were
still discussing the use and abuse of collegiate bodies in
the Church. 6 Is that twelve ?"
And the deep-toned clock of St. Mary's, followed by
strokes from many another spire and tower, compelled
them to separate for the night. Beattie followed him
down the stone stairs, which were already rk, the lamps
having burnt out. The street was empty. But as Vil.
liers passed down to the Angel Inn, where he was stay-
ing, close at the corner of the street which leads into the
dark Radcliffe Square, between St. Mary's and All Souls'
College, two men were standing, with their backs to him,
engaged in deep conversation, but sheltered, under the
shadow of the wall, from the light of the moon. They
were speaking earnestly in French, and Villiers fancied
that he heard his own name mentioned ; and as he turn-
ed to look at them as he passed, he was surprised to see
the Jew in company with the French ecclesiastic whom
he had met that day at dinner.

fring to demand an explanation ; but he resolved to prose-
cute some inquiries in the morning. He went into the
coffee-room to write a letter, which the sleepy waiter
promised to commit carefully to the driver of the mail,
which passed through to Hawkstone at two o'clock in the
morning ; and as he was going up stairs to his room, the
chamber-maid met him, with apologies for having
shifted him to another apartment--one, she said, more
airy and convenient ; the other had been wanted as part
of a suit for a family. Villiers made no rernonstrance.
His new room was preferable to the other. His servant
had moved all his dressing apparatus, as if no change
had been effected. And after trying the lock of a door,
which seemed to lead into an adjoining room, and find.
ing it fastened on the other side, he sat down, trimmed
his candle, and opened his desk to examine some papers.
His
eye fell on a packet sealed with black, and carefully
secured. It contained documents, which he never part-
ed with, full to him of bitter reccollections, and which
yet he never looked on without some gleam of hope that
they might one day restore to him his child. He opened
it, and the tears fell thick upon the papers. The cer-
tificate of his unhappy marriage, memoranda of all the
facts relating to the loss of his boy, as minute an account

tie's care, at Naples, while Villiers himself was lying in
his illness; some family papers of his wife's, relating to
her own birth and connections; and the miniature of his
wife herself, in all her beauty,--Villiers once more, for
the thousandth time, perused and reperused these precious
memorials, until a heavy step passing his door, and on-
tering the adjoining room, roused him from a sort of
stupor, and he prepared to lie down. Once, as he was
undressing, he fancied he heard a slight grating sound, as
if some one was trying the handle or the lock of the door,
but it did not return, and, resting his head on his pillow,
he was soon asleep.
He rose soon" (for it was Sunday morning,) that he
might attend the early Communion with Beattie.

one of the last days which he proposed to pass in Oxford,
and, except the hours of Divine service, he spent the
greater part of it with Beattie. It was a time of deep
and solemn reflection to him; and softened and elevated
by the feelings which Oxford, more than any other
place, breathes upon a Sabbath rest, he spoke unreserv-
edly to his friend of the future as well as the past ; of his
repentance ; his submission to the will of God; his re-
cognition of the hand of Providence in the judgment with
which he had been afflicted; of his earnest desire to
devote the remainder of his life to the service of God and
the Church ; of his resolution to divert his thoughts from
the great temptation which he felt would interrupt that
purpose if he once involved himself in a union even with
the most admirable of women, severed from him by her
religious faith. Beattie listened to him, as they paced
backwards and forwards on the broad smooth level lawn
of St. John's garden, silently, but not without emotion.
"I shall look to you, dear Beattie," he said, " for much
assistance, for advice, for suggestion."
But Beattie shook his head. He was not fond of giv-
ing advice ; and he had no great confidence in his own sug.
gestions. It was one of his first maxims to undertake no
responsibility to which he did not seem obviously called
by the hand Providence.

" But you will come and see me?"
6. Indeed I will."
"And you will not refuse to tell me if I am wrong in
any thing I undertake?"
Once more Beattie shook his head, and sn iled; but
it was a smile of affectionate confidence, that there would
be few occasions for such admonitions.

for me at Naples ; I must have accurate copies of them
taken and placed in the hands of a friendof more than
one friend; for I tremble at times lest I should lose them,
and then all hope would be lost of recovering what at
times I still believe God in his great mercy will restore
to me. I will bring them to you to-morrow; and in your
hands, for the time, I know they will be safe."
Beattie readily promised. Even he himself, though
neither sanguine nor romantic, and notwithstanding the
impenetrable mystery which hung over the loss of Vil-
liers's child, and had bafiled every research-even Beattie,
as he looked proudly and fondly on the noble and almost
sacred character of his friend, did not despair that bles.
sings were still in store for him. He wished once more
to examine the documents, and consult upon them a legal
friend who had enjoyed considerable experience in the
detection of similar cases.
Villiers's arrangements were all made to leave Oxford
for Hawkstone the following day. Once more the mid-
night bell tolled out from the towers and steeples before
he could bring himself to separate from Beattie, and
before Beattie had half concluded all that he was en-
deavoring to explain of the proper organization of the
Church, and of the necessity for restoring it at this time
to meet its tremendous responsibilities, by the restoration
of the collegiate principle, cleared from the errors of mo
nasticism. Once more they roused the sleepy porter at
the gate, who, notwithstanding the nightly disturbance of
his doze, stood obsequiously with hat in hand to open the
wicket for Mr. Beattie's friend.
" I will bring you the papers to-morrow,"
Villiers's last words.
To-morrow came. Villiers rose to go to chapel and
to breakfast with his friend for the last time. He went
to his desk to obtain the papers. Every thing lay as

amount untouched, some rings, private papers, confi.

We have no wish to exhibit characters created for
respect under the influence of mere feeling, Villiers
was not indeed a hero of Romance, with whom every
emotion is a hurricane of passion. He possessed a
wonderful control over himself, and for mere passion
entertained a profound contempt. He therefore neither
tore his hair nor wrung his hands ; but his consternation
was great. He searched through all the drawers-
ransacked every corner--endeavored to recall every
clue by which he might remember where the papers
were mislaid. He had seen them only two nights
before. The notion of robbery was laid aside when he
examined the desk, and found every thing untouched.
His room, moreover, had been kept locked during his
absence, and he had the key in his pocket. Unwilling to
make a charge so vague, which might unjustly expose
the whole household to suspicion, he sent privately for
the master of the hotel. But no light could be thrown on
the loss. Only one person, when interrogated, seemed
to entertain a suspicion. A foreign gentleman, a Jew,
who had been staying in the house, happened to meet
Villiers's
's servant at the door of his master's room, while
he was removing his things to his new apartment. He
had come into the room to ask some frivolous question,
and had looked about him : and on inquiry of the
chamberinaid, it was found that he had complained to her
soon afterwards that his own room was noisy, and had
asked to be moved into the one which adjoined Villiers's,
and communicated with it by an inner door.

earliest
conveyance, and
Slight as
the clue was, it recalled to Villiers's mind the sound
which he had heard in the keyhole the night when he
was last examining the papers,--the mention of his own
name in the street,--all that he had heard from Beattie,
the strange look, which nevertheless seemed to be not
new to him ; and writing a hasty note to Beattie, he
proceeded without delay to London, in the vain hope of
tracing the stranger. It is needless to say that all his
efforts were vain ; baffled and wearied, he was obliged

to resign himself to his loss. And now that all hopes of
recovering his child were gone, he consoled himself
by planning how he should devote more completely him-
self, and all that he possessed, to the service of his
Maker. He had no longer any object in either sparing
or accumulating. Unselfish in all his thoughts, he never
had contemplated his possessions, enlarged as they were
by his uncle's death, as a means of personal aggrandize-
ment. But so long as there remained a possibility of
discovering his child, so long he felt the obligation of
guarding and preserving for him all that he might have
a right to claim. That obligation was now all but de.
stroyed ; recovery seemed hopeless. And after remain-
ing in London for some weeks to make the necessary
arrangements with his lawyers, Villiers, with a heavy
and weary heart, caine down to Hawkstone on the very
night of the fire ; and to that place we must now, after
this long retrospection, carry back our readers.
CHAPTER XXVI.
We trust that our readers will be able to pass from the
grve and sobering thoughts of the preceding chapters
to a more insignificant scene, and yet one not uncon-
nected with them, and will now take their stand with us
by the side of poor Mrs. Crump's arm-chair, and
look out of her bow-window into the High Street of
Hawkstone.
Although Mrs. Crump's afternoon had closed angrily
and gloomily, her prospects brightened up when the next
day arrived; for about twelve o'clock brought an event
in her monotonous life, no less than the arrival of a
strange gentleman at the side-door of Messrs. Silkem's
residence, and evidently a visitor to Miss Mabel Brook
herself. None but persons in Mrs. Crump's position
can fairly appreciate the envy with which at that moment

cation ;
she would have regarded persons possessing, like our-
selves, the privilege of following this visitor into the
house, and of hearing every word that passed. There
is in fact a remarkable faculty possessed by authors-
that of ubiquity, by which they see every thing, and hear
every thing, and can give a most accurate report of all
that
passes
in the most secret and confidential communi.
and as these pages may perhaps meet Mrs.
Crump's eye, we shall not hesitate on the present occa-
sion to take advantage of our privilege, and give her full
information. The gentleman then in question, as Mrs.
Crump perceived, was rather of that age which is most
appropriately described as " the same age with every
body else ;" that is, he was neither young nor old; but
he was portly, of a military aspect, with whiskers, and
even an abridgment of mustachios ; and he was envel.
oped, though the day was by no means cold, in a blue
military cloak, with a profusion of silk cords and tassels
depending from his neck, round which there also hung a
massive watch-guard and chain, which to Mrs. Crump's
admiring eyes were composed of solid gold. He in-
quired respectfully of Mabel's little Abigail
, if this was
the residence of the celebrated Miss Brook ; upon
which the little Abigail, frightened out of her wits at the
sight of so formidable a stranger, hesitatingly replied,
" No-Miss Brook's name was not Celebrated, but
Mabel."
6 Miss Mabel Brook! It is the same personage,"
said the stranger. "Pray present to her my card, and
say that I beg the honor of an interview."
The card was of the most polished character, bearing
on it in full blazonry the title of Major O'Keefe, Hon-
orary Secretary to the Royal and National Grand African
Colonisation and Timbuctoo Civilisation Society, No.
94, Suffolk Street. Before Mabel had had time to in-
quire of her little maid the appearance of the stranger,
or to recover from the trepidation naturally produced by
the approach of such a titled personage, he had himself
followed up the stairs, and even made his appearance
within the door of Mabel's sanctuary. With his hat

gracefully waving in one hand, and the other pressed
respectfully to his breast, he bowed repeatedly; and then
approaching Mabel, he begged to know if he had the
honor of addressing that well-known ornament of society,
that example of genuine benevolence and enlightened
liberality, whose name had reached far beyond the nar-
row sphere to which her beneficent exertions were un-
happily limited ? 6 Was it Miss Mabel Brook whom he
then had the pleasure of beholding ?"
To this overpowering exordium it was impossible for
Mabel's modesty to do more than color and look confused,
and say, "Oh! oh!" and beg that he would take a
chair ; which, throwing aside his blue envelopment,
and studiously displaying not only his massive chain, but
two equally massive rings upon his fingers, as he passed
them negligently through his copious hair, he proceeded
to do.
"Madam," he commenced, "I will make no apology
for thus intruding on hours dedicated to the sweetest la-
bors of an enlightened charity ; but I have been depu-
ted to wait on you by the committee of that noble and
illustrious society, to further whose object I have devoted,
I might say sacrificed, myselfthe Royal and National
Grand African Colonisation and Timbuctoo Civilisation
Society, No. 94, Suffolk Street. You must be aware,
Madam, of the deep interest which benevolent indivi-
duals have recently taken in the fate of Africa. Wil.
berforce, Macaulay, Stephens, Smith, Hopkins, Johnson,
Thompson-hundreds of the most illustrious characters
of the day-feeling the blot which that unhappy country
now makes on the face of the globe, have resolved to
wipe out this dark stain from the age. They propose to
rouse the country, Madam; they will sound the tocsin
throughout the length and breadth of the land; they will
summon together the great, the noble, the learned, the
pious,--all that dignifies human nature and society,
Prince Albert, Madam, himself, and the Bishop of -
and from the platform of Exeter Hall there will forth
a voice which will be heard in the inmost depths of the
spice-breathing forests of Africa, and by the swarthy

natives of the farthest south, saying to them, "Be free!
be civilised! be happy!' Madam
But here, as
he was obliged to pause in order to take breath, Mabe)
also took the opportunity to express her deep sympathy
with the society, of whose formation she had been made
duly acquainted through the public press; and also to hint
at the admiration which the stranger's glowing language
and energetic delivery had already excited in her mind.
"But Madam," he resumed, "I must not longer de-
prive myself of the pleasure of offering to you the tri.
bute to your numerous virtues, which the committee of
our illustrious society have desired to pay you. They
have begged your acceptance, Madam, of this diploma,
which I here present you, and entreat that you will allow
your name to be enrolled among the Honorary Vice-
presidents of the Ladies' Affiliated Association for the
furtherance of our benevolent object."
And with these words, from a pocket which apparently
contained a number of documents of the same shape
and size, the stranger produced a huge sheet of printed
paper, blazoned and adorned with a variety of allegorical
figures, and containing a long and dignified list of visi.
tors, presidents, patrons, vice-patrons, honorary gover-
ors, that is, governors who were not allowed to govern,
subscribers, and supporters ; resolutions moved by Lord
A., and seconded by the Bishop of B. ; and at the bot.
tom, in a copious and most tortuous hieroglyphic, the
signature of Augustus Philadelphus Wilberforce O'Keefe,
Honorary Secretary and Treasurer. But that which
most surprised, and, it must be confessed, most delighted
Mabel, was a letter addressed to hereelf by the body of
the committee, expressing their admiration of her cha-
racter, their desire to show their sense of the benefit
which, in such various capacities, she had rendered to
the cause of true benevolence, and the unanimous ap-
plause with which she had therefore been elected to a
seat at the board of honorary vice-presidents of the La-
dies', &c. &c. &c. The honorary secretary and trea-
surer was not insensible to the favorable effect produced
on the honorary vice-president.

" Madam," he proceeded, " will you now permit me
to explain to you, succinctly but precisely, the object of
our most important undertaking, in which we fervently
trust you will both sympathise and co-operate with us ?"
Mabel bowed, and placed herself in a listening pos-
ture, not forgetting, however, that too ready an accept-
ance, even of such an honor, might compromise her own
dignity, and therefore throwing into her countenance a
cast of critical and judicial severity, to temper the bland.
ness of her general demeanor.
" Our object, Madam," said the secretary (and he
drew his chair closely and confidentially to her side), " is
to pour the light of civilisation and liberty over the vast
regions of Africa--a fourth part, madam, of the habitable
globe."
Mabel bowed assent.
" We feel, Madam, that nothing can reclaim those
miserable nations from their present degraded position,
or put a stop to the horrors of slavery~~
Mabel gave a shudder.
" Yes, Madam, the horrors of slavery ! What
Englishman, what female-what tender, delicate, affec-
tionate heart--a heart, madam, like your own, does not
glow at the name of liberty? How can we release these

pose to develope their resources, to modify their in-
stitutions, to carry out the principles of an enlightened
utility."
Mabel looked all attention.
" To do this, madam, we have obtained from a most
eminent French traveller accurate statistics of the popu.
lation, commerce, manufactures, literature, and religion
of those vast regions; and we find, on authentic calculation,
that by turning the labor of the people into manufactures
and agriculture, more wealth would be created than by
selling them as slaves."
Mabel bowed.

love, the slave trade will be abandoned, manufactures
and commerce will be introduced into the dark regions
of Timbuctoo, and will bring with them all the blessings
of life which they have diffused upon our own favored
shores.'
Mabel here did not bow assent, for the word manu-
factures reminded her that she had just come from the
dying bed of a poor stunted factory child, whose arms
had been crushed in the machinery, and whom his moth-
er, with ten starving children, was vainly endeavoring
to support upon cold potatoes and waterthe father
spending his wages in the intervals of work at the public-
house.
Madam," continued the secretary, " nothing but
knowledge can work this miraculous change. Know-
ledge,' madam, as the great Bacon says Knowledge
is power.' And one of the first debts due by our civili.
sed continent to our unhappy brethren of Africa is to give
them knowledge."
" You intend, I suppose, sir," inquired Mabel, "to
establish schools among the blacks ?"
" Certainly, Madam, certainly-schools of all kinds.
One of our first thoughts, madam. I may mention to you
privately, madam, and confidentally, that a most distin-
guished person has already placed at the disposal of the
society a sum of 1000l. to found a professorship of politi.
cal economy in the great capital of Africa. The Rev.
Dr. Mason, that celebrated writer and divine, has also
been pleased to place at our disposal all the unsold copies
of his lectures on that science (and I assure you they
amouut to a large number of volumes), for the purpose of
circulating them among the negroes.'
"How interesting !" said Mabel. " And pray, sir,
do the negroes understand English ? "
" No, madam, not yet, not exactly : but Dr. Jones,
who understands the languages of all the savage
tribes
both in Africa and in Europe, and has published some

beautiful translations from their literature and poetry,
has undertaken, for a mere trifle, not above three or
four hundred pounds, to render them into the vernacular
tongue, the Ashantee dialect-a man, madam, that, of
prodigious power! wonderful memory ! extraordinary
fancy! His opinion is, that the chapter on rent and
wages will tell wonderfully in opening the eyes of the na-
lives to the true theory of wealth. He has some notion
of publishing a little volume himself, of translations from
an Ashantee poem, one of them a splendid epicwild,
madam, and irregular, wanting in the unities, but sweetly
touching--spirit stirring--the peripateia especially ! "
"I should much like to see it," said Mabel ;
as there
is something so interesting and affecting in the wild life
of the native African."
" Certainly, madam, certainly," said the secretary ;
nothing can be more so. It is to be published by sub-
scription. Would you allow me to put your name on
the list?"
Mabel, however, was prudent and economical even
in her enthusiasm, and was obliged to decline; pleading
the
many
calls on her purse.
" We shall hope, madam," continued the secretary,
"to print it at Timbuctoo. Our expedition takes out a
printing-press - one of our first objects. We shall have
a newspaper, madam, weekly at first, but we do not doubt
of its circulation soon reaching to a considerable extent,
and then we propose to publish it daily; the African

" And are they

been turned to science. We long to introduce into our
own beloved country the same blessings of knowledge
which we would diffuse in Africa ; and what branch of
knowledge more interesting, more valuable, more re-
freshing and expanding to the mind-carrying it, madam,
up to the great Cause of all things, and filling it with
wonder and admiration than the study of Nature, and
Nature's works!"
Mabel smiled, and assented.
" And yet, madam, think, even in this favored land,
and among our own enlightened peasantry, and even our
artizans, how few know the difference between an alli-
gator and a crocodile ! "
Very few," said Mabel, a little alarmed lest any
question on the subject should arise which might betray
her own ignorance of this important point.
"Oh! madam, we look forward to the day when not
only in the Regent's Park, but in every town in England,
there may be a zoological collection--live birds and
beasts of all kinds. We have entered already into a
contract with the proprietors of the Surrey Gardens to

come a branch of trade-open a new line of profitable
speculation. We calculate that the prime cost of one,
all expenses and duties paid, will be scarcely more than
what any private gentleman of moderate fortune might
easiiy afford, if he wished to keep one himself,"
Indeed!" said Mabel.

arms! We have already contracted for 500 stand of
muskets with a great manufacturer at Birmingham, war-
ranted, madam, not to burst till the third time of firing.
Opium, again"
Opium ?" inquired Mabel, rather alarmed. "I should
not have thought it desirable to encourage a taste for
opium among the negroes."
"Oh, madam, not for the world, not for the world ;
it is not with a view to encourage any pernicious habit-
not that, madam ; but commerce, you see, must be free, free
as air. Fetter its wings, and, like the imprisoned eagle,
it pines and dies !"
Mabel was enchanted with the inetaphor, but could
not help reverting to the objectionable character of an
opium trade.
"You see, madam," said the secretary, and he drew
his chair still closer, and subdued his voice into a persua.
sive and didactic tone, you see, madam, the state and
prospects of this country are so alarming in consequence
of our commercial speculations, that it becomes absolutely
necessary for us to look round on all sides, and to provide
means for developing them farther. Capital, madam,
must be employed-otherwise, how could we pay our
National Debt ? Our shipping must be kept up, or what
is to become of our duties? In fact, madam, our whole
existence depends on our manufactures and commerce :
and opium, madam, is one great branch ; two millions
of money annually are invested in t. What would the
Chancellor of the Exchequer say it' this branch of his
revenue was cut a ? No, madam, it is not for us to

interfere with or fetter the natural expansion of trade ; it
will take its own course, and work out its own end, and
nothing but mischief can follow from attempts to overrule
it. The nineteenth century has long since exploded the
old absurd theories of restrictions upon commerce. But
then, madam, do not suppose we are insensible to our
moral influence. It is by showing to the poor natives
our superiority in all points of knowledge, by compelling
them to look up to us for the supply of their wants, that
we intend to acquire a control over them, and lead them
on in the glorious path of civilisation. We take out a
steam-engine, madam, which is to work the gold mines;
gold mines, we know, there are in abundance ; labor
cheap and plentiful ; and the negroes will work almost
for nothing if kept properly in order. Why, in our own
factories children work twelve hours a day for 6d.--and
it will be hard if the negroes in their own country cannot
be induced to do the same. Stimulate their wants,
madam, enlarge their capacities for enjoyment, open to
them new views of advantages, and you will find that
even the negroes will become as industrious, and as civ.
ilised, and as happy, as our own artisans."
Mabel, however, said nothing, for again the word
" factory" had raised up a painful vision before her eyes ;
and she turned the subject by pointing to an engraving
on the diploma, which represented a splendid range of
buildings, with a quay, and shipping in the distance ;
and on the foreground, a lady of most amiable deport-
ment, with a helmet on her head, and a spear in her
hand, sitting in what to ordinary mortals must be an
uncomfortable position, on the tire of a wheel, and
stretching out her hands to a group of negroes, not
attired with perfect decorum, or rather, not attired at
all (for modern art seems to have dispensed with the su.
perfluity. of dress). The above-mentioned negroes were
also employed in carrying some huge bales, carefully
corded, and marked-Messrs. Baldwin & Co. Merchants,
Timbuctoo. Above was a splendid irradiation of light
pouring down from amidst a mass of dispersing clouds.
* This print, I suppose," said Mabel,"is emblematical?"

"Yes, madam," said the secretary, "partly so-a
little device of my own" (and he smiled with conscious
dignity) ; " but partly real. It is the architect's design
for the new town of Albert-Ville on the banks of the
Niger."
" Indeed !" said Mabel. " It is very beautiful."
"Exquisite, madam ; one of the most charming and
complete things which Mr. Plasmer has produced !
Great genius that, madam! very great genius! You
see, here is the Crescent ; Victoria Crescent it is to be
called, in honor of her most gracious Majesty. Here, in
the centre, is the hotel, a most spacious and convenient
house, containing baths, billiard-room, ball-room, theatre
adjoining, admirably ventilated kitchens, tap-room, and
separate spirit-shop at the back for the accommodation
of the natives ; a noble range of houses and warehouses
on the banks of the river :-the whole to communicate
with a railway direct from Timbuctoo."
" Indeed !" said Mabel, "it is a magnificent idea !"
Magnificent indeed," said the secretary, who seemed
as if by this time he had exhausted his eloquence, and
wished to draw the conversation to a practical closing
point. But Mabel's thoughts had before this turned to
one other consideration.
" And I presume, sir," she said, pointing to a central
tower, round which the buildings were picturesquely
grouped, "I presume this is to be the church ?"
"No, madam, not exactly, not precisely ; it is the
tower of the observatory. We are to have an observa.
tory. You are aware how anxious the world of science
has long been to establish a chain of observatories over
the whole earth. They have built one at Botany Bay.
The grand celebrated Association for Science, where all
the philosophers assembled last year, particularly begged
that one of our first things should be to build an observa-
tory, and teach the negroes the use of the telescope.
How delightful it will be to see the swarthy Abyssinian
villagers, with eyes upturned to heaven, scanning the
wonders of the starry world, or calculating the transit of
Venus ! Ho'v elevating to their minds ! how cnrap.

turing the prospect! We may owe even the discovery
of a new nebula, or the just outline of one of the monn-
tains of the moon, to one of those poor creatures who are
now rambling in their native forests, believing, in their
miserable ignorance, that the stars are sparks of fire, and
the moon only three feet round. Sad, indeed, to reflect,
that never till now have we endeavored to give them
juster and more ennobling views! And how delightful
the thought, that at length the clouds of darkness may
be unrolled from their eyes !"
" And where is your Church to be ?" pursued Mabel.
"Oh! why-why-oh!" and the secretary hemmed
and coughed. "Why, madam, you see"and he coughed
again" we have been desirous to rally under one grand
banner of enlightened benevolence all the great and good
minds of the present day ; and to do this without risking
those sad discordances and disputes on antiquated dog-
mas which must intervene, whenever, in these days, the
subject of religion is mixed up with more practical
pursuits. We have therefore thought it better and the
government quite approve of our principle) to leave reli-
gion an open question. But there will be a church,
madarn. Do not be alarmed-there is to be a church."
"I am glad to hear it," said Mabel.
you will have clergymen and missionaries?"
"Oh! certainly, madam, certainly. We have thrown
open the whole field to competition. Any clergyman of
any denomination will be invited to accompany the ex-
pedition. And we rather think of allowing to a certain
number a free passage, provided they bring proper re-
commendations from their respective congregations.
Something, indeed, was suggested by the government
about providing them all land in the colony according to
the number of their flocks : but we really dread mixing
up the clergy with any secular or temporal pursuits ; it
removes them from their purely spiritual duties and
character ; and therefore the committee have resolved
not to hold out such temptations. Besides which, it
would be inconvenient, as the land is of some value, and
may be wanted for commercial purposes."
66 And I suppose

" And have you had many applications or offers from
clergymen ?" asked Mabel.
"Oh dear, yes ! certai aly ; three Baptists, two Pres-
byterians, four Wesleyans, and six Rational Religionists
have sent in their testimonials ; besides one Unitarian
clergman, who intends to open a business in the ivory
and spirit line."
66 Indeed !" said Mabel. " But is not the ivory and
spirit line rather a temporal and secular occupation for a
clergyman?"
"Why, rather so, madam, rather, perhaps ; but then, you
see, the gentleman must live in some way. He cannot
preach and starve. If he is not paid for his services, he
must support himself."
" Very true," said Mabel. 6. But where is the church
to be built-our own church, I mean?"
" Why, madam, this has been rather a difficult ques.
tion for the committee. They have not liked to pledge
themselves exactly to any one religious denomination, as
I before said. They feel that it would be presumptuous
in them to decide on those deep theological discussions
which are now agitating the religious world. They
will have no objection to any clergyman of the estab
lishment building his own church, but they feel it would
be a departure from their fundamental principle to allow
it to appear prominently in the plans of their own ar-
chitect."
Mabel looked rather puzzled.
"Sir James Perceval," continued the major, did
indeed propose at the board, that a church should be
built at the expense of the Association, but it would not
do. Such a clamor was raised, and all the various dc.
nominations came at the next meeting and protested ;
and there was a violent altercation, as there must be
when you bring together into one place or under one
roof a number of persons who differ on a subject on
which they all feel warmly. Sir James was obliged to
withdraw his motion. But he is a Conservative, mad.

strng, they have proposed, by way of preserving peace,
what will certainly be carried. One of the largest store-
rooms in the settlement is to be set apart every Sunday,
and different hours appointed by the governor for the sev-
eral services of the various denominations ; so that they
will all meet amicably under the same roof, and no
undue preference be given. And thus the natives will
have the opportunity of hearing the truth set before them
in all its various forms, without any attempt on our part
to prejudice their minds; the Association undertaking
the cleaning out of the room."
Mabel looked disappointed. But before she could
say more, there was a double knock at the door below,
and the secretary, seemingly most ready to seize the ex-
cuse, rose to depart. Once more he waved his hat most
gracefully, apologised for the long time during which he
had trespassed on Mabel's attention, and trusted that his
explanations had been satisfactory-hoped that she
would as
soon as possible co-operate with the central
committee, by forming an Affiliated Ladies' Association
in Hawkstone, and collecting an annual fundand beg.
ged to know whether she would wish her own subscrip-
tion to be annual, or, as most of the other honorary vice-
presidents had preferred, would make her contribution
immediately in a donation of five pounds, which he
could receive at once, and which would exempt her from
any further trouble. Happily for Mabel, she had pre-
sence of mind to request time for consideration, and the
more so, as, in her own heart, Africa, with all its inter-
esting features, was balanced by a recent proposal which
had been made to her that very morning through the
Rev. Mr. Armstrong and the Rev. Mr. Howell, the Bap-
tist and Independent ministers of Hawkstone, to aid them
in an important work nearer homeno less than the
sending out a deputation from the clergy of the Protes-
tant communions of England to convert the Pope. The
eyes of Protestantism, and particularly of Protestantism
in Hawkstone, by the rapid rise of a new Popish chapel
among them, had been opened more than ever to the
enormities of popery, , and to the fearful strides which it

331
was making in England. And it was thought that a
grand effort should be made to stay the evil at the foun-
tain head, by endeavoring to act at once on the con-
science and understanding of the Papal court ; for which
purpose a deputation of the most eloquent dissenting
ministers had offered their services to go to Rome, pro-
vided their travelling expenses were paid, and their
families maintained by their congregations during their
absence. And it was thought that the presence of so
many distinguished lights of the dissenting interest, dif-
fering in all other points of religion, yet all agreeing
in their abhorrence of popery, might have a salutary
and awakening effect on the mind of the Pope himself.
At any rate, as Mr. Howell said, it would be a satisac-
tion to deliver their consciences, and to preach the Gospel
once to the people in the very bosom of Antichrist.
All these thoughts and reminiscences passed rapidly
through Mabel's mind--a mind capacious enough to
grasp both projects at once, and active enough to organ-
ize committees, and collect subscriptions, for both, if her
finances had permitted her. Gratitude indeed-gratitude
for the honor which she had received so unexpectedly
and so wholly without solicitationbegan to prepon.

girl, once more half frightened out of her wits, announced,
as she held it ajar, that there were two more gentlemen
down stairs, who wanted to see Miss Brook : one was
Mr. Bevan, and the other, she did not know who. Mabel
hastily arranged some papers of school accounts which
she was looking cver, and omitting to put out of sight the
blazoned diploma, which lay open in all its grandeur on
the table, she prepared, with a dignified look of business,
to receive her new visitors. Only, it must be confessed,
she wished the stranger, whoever he was, had come
without Mr. Bevan; for Mr. Bevan, she thought, was
always laughing at her, and would always intrude his
own strange Oxford notions; and, to say the truth, she
was a little afraid of him. She had, however, no time
to ruminate, for steps were heard coming up the stairs,
and presently Charles Bevan entered the room, anl with

an apology for the intrusion, he begged permission to
introduce to her a gentleman, a friend of his, who was
staying in HawkstoneMr. Ernest Villiers.
CHAPTER XXVII.
-
It is not from any wish to tantalize the reader needlessly
that we must revert, at this point, to another personage,
in whose fate, it is hoped, they have not lost their interest
during so many intervening chapters. Ernest's visit to
Miss Brook was connected with the disappearance of
Bentley. He had been directed to Bentley's by Mr. At-
kinson, in order to procure some information on a subject
of great interest to him. Bentley was not at home, and
his housekeeper was beginning to feel uneasy, especially
as he had been seen walking back late in the evening
to the Priory ruins. In default of Bentley, Ernest re-
solved to apply to Charles Bevan, whom he had slightly
known at college ; and Bevan brought him, for informa-
tion, to Miss Brook.
But while all this was passing, what had become of
Bentley himself? We left him at the moment when he
sank senseless under the knife of the ruffian. As his
consciousness gradually returned to him, he awoke to the
sense of a rough jolting motion, apparently through some
unfrequented road, for the boughs of trees crashed as they
moved along. There was a sound of hoarse brawling
water close to him, like a torrent; and as he faintly open-
ed his eyes, he saw above him the moon streaming
brightly through a dense mass of foliage. As he became
alive to a sense of his situation, he tried to rise from the
bottom of the cart in which he was lying, and look round
to discover into whose hands he had fallen, and where
they were carrying him. But on applying his hand to
his chest, he found his clothes saturated with wet blood.
Some rough hand had indeed attempted to bandage up
the wound; but faint with the loss of blood, he sank back,

HAWKSTONE.
333
and had scarcely strength to relieve the uneasy position
in which he lay, with nothing but an old sack to break
the jolting of the cart over the ruts, and a quantity of
hard poles for his support, which by the glittering of the
moon on their points he perceived to be pikes. One
heavy tramp he could hear close at his side, as of a man
attending to the horse. And as he once more endeavor.
ed to rise up, and thought of appealing to him for assis.
tance, a rough voice close at his ear muttered to him " to
lie still, and keep his eyes shut." The voice was hoarse
and hollow, but there was something of kindness in it,
which gave Bentley a feeling of hope. It was also Irish,
with a strong brogue ; and Bentley fancied it was famil.
iar to him. Presently the cart stopped, and two other
voices, as of persons who had just overtaken it, were
heard speaking together in an under tone, as if afraid of
being overheard. Half fainting, and half bewildered,
Bentley was unable to collect his thoughts, to know
what course he should take. But as he opened his eyes
once more, the light fell upon a rough face, begrimed
with black, looking steadfastly upon him.
" He is alive!" the fellow cried, with an oath,
sure as my name's Jack."
66 Is he ?" said another voice. " And what in the
world are we to do with him ?"
Why did not Wheeler put him down the well at
once," said the first?
" He would have laid snug enough
there for ever, and no one the wiser. Who is it,
Connell?"
It's the parson," returned the same voice which had
before told Bentley to lie still, and which he now recog.
nized, as having heard it often when visiting poor Mar-
garet and the boy after the fire.
6 It's the parson."
" These parsons," rejoined the first speaker, " are
always getting into scrapes, meddling with other people's
business. Why can't they let folks alone, to do as they
like? What is it to them what we choose to do? But
them that meddles burns their fingers."
" Hark!" muttered the other, "there's some one
coming."
as

"It's only the water," was the reply.
" And if we do meet any one, what a mess we are
in," said the first, " with a murdered man in the cart, and
all these confounded pikes too. I say, Jack, let's throw
him over at once."'
And Bentley could perceive, by the steep ascent of
the road, and the brawling of the torrent at some distance
below, that they were probably passing along a steep
precipitous bank overhanging the river. His head be.
gan to swim, and he was on the point of making another
effort to rise and cry for help, when Connell's low
mutter was heard again close at his ear, " Lie still, lie
still ; they shan't touch you."
" And you're the fool that begged him off, Connell,"
said the first speaker, "to get hung yourself for your
pains !"
" It's I that did it," answered Connell : "and I'd do
it a hundred times. Didn't he give me to eat when I
was starving, and my wife too ? Didn't he offer sums
of money to any one who would save my poor boy out
of the fire ? Didn't he come and visit us afterwards
often and often, and always a kind word in his mouth,
and something to help us in his hand ? I've done bad
enough jobs in my day to them as was my enemies,
but I do not desert them that's kind to me ; and I
do not intend to desert Parson Bentley; and, what's
more, none of you shall touch a hair of his head."
" Why, he isn't one of your own craft, after all,"
said the first speaker, with a sneering laugh. "He's one
of your heretics, isn't he ?"
"May be," said Connell, "and more the pity ; but
he has been kind to me and mine, for all that."
" Better get rid of himn at once," said the second voice.
" Dead men tell no tales."
Connell said nothing, but laid a whip vigorously
across the horse, which made him move on rapidly.
"Why, you ar'n't the man, surely," said the same
voice, "to mind putting a dangerous fellow out of the way.
You've done such a thing before now."
Connell groaned, and laid on another lash of his whip.
## p. 335 (#347) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
335
" Why," pursued the voice, "they tell me, in Ireland
you folks no more mind popping at gentle folks from
behind a hedge, or knocking at a man's brains with a
flint stone in a stocking, to find if they are at home
or not, than we mind shooting at a cock-sparrow. Eh?"
Bentley heard another deep groan.
Why, you know," continued the speaker, " if your
priest there, or whoever you call him, were to bid you
knock out the parson's brains, here, this moment, you'd
do it at once."
"Ay, but he wouldn't," muttered Connell.
Ay, but if he did, would you do it ?"
" But he wouldn't," said Connell.
"But if he did ?" pursued the speaker.
"He wouldn't," repeated Connell, doggedly; and no
other answer could be extracted from him.
" And what in the world do you intend to do with the
parson ?" said the first speaker.
Connell made no reply.
"I tell you what, Jack," said the other. " There's no
use our meddling with this job any more ; let's stick to
the other cart, and go round by Birking Lane, down the
copse. If Paddy will put his head into the noose, let
him."
" And what shall we say to Wheeler ?" said the other.
" Let Wheeler shift for himself !" was the reply.
" He's a rogue and a rascal ; 38. 6d. and a quart of
beer for this work ; and he gets all the penny subscrip-
tions from the club and pockets them, and no one knows
anything about them. He does not care a fig for any one
of us but himself, with all his fine talk about liberty and
rights.Hark ? again, here's some one on horseback,
sure enough." And the two men fell back and joined
the other cart, which was coming slowly up the hill be-
hind, at no great distance.
Bentley, on hearing the approach of a horse, was
inclined once more to call out and obtain assistance ;
but again Connell's rough hollow voice bade him lie still
and say nothing"all was right;" and he thought it better
to comply.
## p. 336 (#348) ############################################

HAWKSTONE.
"Good night, sir, good night." Why, rather late,
isn't it ?" was all that passed between Connell and the
stranger on horseback. He turned back, however, for a
minute, repeated some kind of password in a foreign
language, and asked if the other cart was coming. Con.
nell said, " Yes," and the stranger once more bade him
good night, in a tone implying a superior education and
habits of society, and rode off. Bentley was now left
alone with Connell; and he was hoping to obtain from
him some information as to his destination ; but Connell,
without speaking, jumped up on the cart, and seizing the
reins, urged on the horse over the rough road, till Bent-
ley, in an agony of pain, was obliged to raise himself up
and entreat him to stop.
" Better not, better not," said Connell.
But on Bentley's entreating him to go quietly, for he
was very ill, he jumped down, and getting into the cart,
endeavored to arrange the pikes in such a manner as to
make a less uneasy bed. As he did this, there was a
strange gentleness and softness about his voice and
manner which surprised Bentley, little used to the con.
trasts of the Irish character. He lifted him up almost like
a child, fastened the bandage more tightly about the
wound, and taking off his own coat, folded it up,
it as a pillow under the head of the sufferer, and then
covered him with a sack.
"Don't be afraid, sir, don't be afraid ; I'm your
friend; I don't forget you ; I'll stand by you; only we
must get on." And once more he jumped on the front
of the cart, and urged on the horse to a trot. Bentley
closed his eyes, and endeavored to compose his thoughts
into prayer ; but his head swam, his senses became
confused with pain and weakness, and he lay gazing up
in the sky with a bewildered sensation of something
frightful in which he was involved, without
any
distinct
perception of what passed, except that a large ball of light

cing about before them, and burning him. Once or
twice he groaned ; and Connell, checking the horse,
turned to ask what was the matter, and tried to arrange the

pillow more comfortably for him. How long he lay in
this state he could not tell ; but the road from the deep
copse-wood, which clothed the steep banks of the tor-
rent, now emerged suddenly upon a wide heath, without
a tree of any kind. Huge sweeping hills, destitute of all
cultivation, spread far before them; but apparently they
were approaching human habitations, for the road be.
came tolerably smooth, and several groups of men passed
by, and exchanged with Connell the same good night,
and the same mysterious foreign password, which the
gentleman on horseback had used before. Bentley's
eyes, however, were now closed in a sort of stupor,
from which he was aroused by the cart stopping, and by
his feeling Connell's arms placed gently under him to lift
him up:
" Now, sir, get upI 'll take you out. Don't be
afraid only for your life do all you are told, and don't
fear, otherwise your life is not worth a straw.I 'll be
with you."
And Bentley, on looking up, found that the cart had
stopped in a little yard surrounded by low sheds and
buildings, apparently workshops ; for large bars of iron
were lying about, and heaps of coal, and tools used in
mining and excavating. The gate by which they had
entered had been carefully closed and barred by Connell;
and once more begging Bentley not to be frightened, he
raised him up softly, and, lifting him out of the cart, half
led and half carried him into a little outhouse, where he
arranged some straw, and, laying him down, covered
him once more with some sacks. Bentley was by this
time in a burning thirst, and he entreated some water,
on which Connell disappeared, but returned soon with a
cupful of liquid, which he declared would do him good
but which, on tasting, Bentley found to be whiskey ;
and he was obliged once more to ask for water. Con-
nell tossed off the whiskey himself, and soon brought
him a broken jug, out of which Bentley drank with
avidity.
Now, sir, lie still here, and I 'll be back presently."
Recovered by the water, Bentley felt his senses be-

coming clearer, and he could look round and observe by
the moonlight the objects around him ; and what was still
more comforting, he could compose his thoughts to pray-
er, and prepare himself for the worst which might await
him. Where he was, he knew not; but there was a
lurid glare in the sky above him, and a rushing grinding
sound as of wheels and machinery not far off
, which led
him to suppose that he might have been taken up into
Hawkstone Forest, among the coal and iron pits ; and it
was a thought by no means calculated to allay bis alarm.
He knew that for several months there had been rumors
of insurrectionary movements among the workmen em.
ployed in this district ; that it was the refuge of the worst
outcasts of society gathered together within the last three
or four years by the opening of the mines, and left with
out any superintendence or control; that it was the
boast of Hawkstone Forest that no policemen dared
come near them; and that as the enormous profits of
Sir Matthew Blake, the proprietor, increased, he was
employing every day a larger body of laborers, and ac-
cumulating a mass of vice and sedition, which threatened
soon to break over and deluge the country with some
serious mischief.
He lay for more than an hour ruminating on these
thoughts, and resigning himself into the hands of Provi.
dence. He would have risen to look round him more
carefully, and to discover any means of escape, but his
wound had become exquisitely painful, and escape in his
present state was hopeless. Just as a clock, apparently
in a workman's cabin near, struck two, a light as from
il lantern appeared in one corner of the shed where he
was lying, and from a door in the partition five or six
men issued out, and came up to the place where he was
lying.
" And so this is he?" said one.
"Yes," said a voice, which Bentley recognized as
Connell's; and at the same time Connell came up to
him, and taking hold of his hand, pressed it hard, as if
to remind him of his former injunctions, and to reassure
him.

" Why, 'tis a bad wound," sail another, stooping
down, and examining the bandages, which were full of
blood. "That Wheeler's a dangerous chap; he'd as soon
stick a man as look at him."
" Well, parson," said a third, who seemed to be the
head, " we've heard you're a kindish man, and never
grudge your help to the poor, and that's more than some
of
your cloth can say; and, may be, though we are re-
solved to have our rights, we've no wish to injure them
that do not grind and starve the people. Now, I tell
you what, you've been fool enough to go spying and pry-
ing into other people's secrets, and have got a knife into
you
for
your pains : do you think that will be a lesson to
you never to talk of such secrets again ?"
Bentley tried to speak, and to remove the notion that
he had any wish either to discover or divulge their
secrets ; but the man put his hand upon his mouth, ana
bade him be quiet.
6. There's one here," he said, " you must thank, it
you hav'n't your mouth stopped more effectually ; bu.
he's told us all about you. Are you willing to take the
oath ?"
Bentley asked " What oath ?"
"Why, our oath-never to tell to any living soul, be
he magistrate, or police, or what not, or friend or foe,
anything you have heard or seen of us."
Bentley replied that he was at their mercythat he
had done them no harm, and never intended to do them
harm-that it was by mere accident he was at the Prio-
ry-and he was willing to do anything, not unworthy of
a clergyman, to save his life.
There was a laugh and jest from several of the party
as he came to the words "unworthy of a clergyman," but
their leader silenced them.
66 You'll take the oath, then ?"
"I will" said Bentley," if it is not an oath to do any-
thing wrong."
"You promise, then ?"
Bentley faintly answered, " Yes." Something in his
conscience whispered, that to take an oath of such a

nature, even under such circumstances, was an act of
doubtful propriety, to say the least ; but he had not been
brought up in a very strict school of casuistry ; his virtues
and his religion had both been matters more of feeling
than of deep reasoning. And bewildered, and alarmed,
and worn out with pain, he consented to do all that was
required.
"Take him up, then," said the leader. And while
two men raised him in their arms, he found Connel]
gently lifting up his head, and once more whispering in
his ear"not to be frightened, and do all that he was
bid." It was with some difficulty that they bore him
through the narrow door in the partition, and wbich was
concealed by a projection of the wall, and difficult to
discover. But the passage widened afterwards, and led
down by a flight of wooden steps, rotten and broken,
which seemed ready to fall under their weight. 
" Take him softly, mind his head, put your hand
under his shoulder," cried Connell, as they lifted him
down the last step : and the leader, from a huge ring
of rusty keys, proceeded to open the padlock of a low
door in the wall.
"Now, then, is all ready?" he asked.
And once more turning to Bentley, he reminded him
of his promise to take the oath, and that his life de.
pended on it. " If you don't," said he, "why it's only
left for us to take care of ourselves; and you may judge,"
he said, " whether we can't easily give you a quietus,
which won't require any oath or any swearing whatever.
And if you break the oath
"He won't," said Connell, " he won't break it. I'll
pledge my life for him-I know he's a man of his word
my life for his we're safe with him."
" He'd better not," said the leader.
66 There was

man, and turned informer ; and I'll tell the parson what
became of him."
And he stooped down, and whispered in Bentley's eai
a few words, which made his blood run cold with horror
6. And now is all ready ?"

HAWKSTONE.
341
"Do not be afraid, do not be afraid," muttered Con-
nell in Bentley's ear, as he raised him to stand on his
feet. " There's no danger-only take the oath."
But Bentley was afraid ; and well he might be. He
stood on the verge of a dark pit or well, down which
hung an iron chain ; above, by the light of one or two
tallow candles, he saw nothing but the roof of a sort of
cave hewn out of the solid rock, and dripping with water.
The men had nearly stripped themselves naked, and
were turning a windlass, by which Bentley saw a low
shallow wooden tub rising to the top of the well. It no
sooner reached the surface than the captain of the gang
bade them put over Bentley a rough blackened smock-
frock : and himself getting into the tub, Bentley was
placed in it like d, supported in the arms of the
other, he felt the chain 'rapidly lower; the glimmering
light of the candles became fainter, the aperture of the
well began to contract; and as the light above fell with
a dimmer lustre on the rough damp rockwork, out of
which the shaft was excavated, the dense pitchy mass
of darkness in which they were sitting themselves,
seemed to rise rapidly above them.
"I have money," said Bentley to his companion ;
" what will you take to set me free ?" as he vainly thought
of propitiating him.
Money have you ?" said the man ;
" then you'd
better give it to me."
" Here," said Bentley, as be put a quantity of silver
into his hand. The man looked on it scornfully, and put
it into his pocket.
" Where are we going?" asked Bentley.
6 You'll soon see," said his companion.  There,
mind your head."
And as the bucket swung against the side of the
shat, he with some difficulty saved Bentley from tho
concussion.
6 Catch hold of the chain. Have you strength to
hold on yourself ?"
" No," said Beattie, faintly, or he was becoming
giddy.
66
## p. 342 (#354) ############################################

HAWKSTONE.
" There nowhere we are," said the man ; and the
bucket touched the ground with a shock which nearly
threw him out. In a minute Bentley found himself
seized by two men, naked to the waist, and begrimmed
with filth ; a third bore two rough-shaped torches, and
with the captain of the gang following, Bentley was
carried along a steep, plashy, descending passage, hewn
out of the rock. The air was stifling. The glare of the
torches fell fearfully on the low ponderous roof, which
seemed ready to crush them as they advanced, and before
them was a black depth of darkness, into which it was
impossible for the eye to penetrate.
" Stop !" said the captain, when they had advanced as
much as a hundred yards in this way. 66 You must wait
here. Put him down."
And resting Bentley with his back against the rock,
they disappeared. Left alone in utter darkness, in the
bowels of the earth, and in the hands evidently of de.
signing and desperate men, he felt his whole soul sink
with alarm. He continued, however, to pray fervently ;
and with every prayer his strength increased, and his
presence of mind returned. As a light appeared in the
direction in which they had come, he almost began to
hope that it was the same party returning ; but it was
only Connell. Once more he brought Bentley a cup of
whiskey, and entreated him to drink it ; and rather than
disappoint him, Bentley placed it to his lips, but could not
swallow it.
" You'll take the oath," said Connell ; "mind you
take the oath. There's nothing in it; only not to tell
that's all. If you don't, you're a dead man. I pro-
mised you shouid take it ; or do you suppose Wheeler
would have let you off? Why, they had you at the side
of the well in the ruins, and were just about to heave
you in when I came back; and I had a regular tussle
with them. But I do not forget, sir, what you've done
for me,and I with no friend in the world, and a mise.
rable wretch that mignt as well put an end to myself.
You'll
pray for me when I'm gone, sir ? you'll pray for
my soul, won't you ?"'
## p. 343 (#355) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
343
And as the light fell on Connell's haggard counte,
nance, there was an expression in it of terror and suffering,
which made Bentley, even in his own alarming position,
almost forget himself in compassion for his poor com-
panion. He had no time, however, to say any thing, for
the captain and the others returned, once more lifted him
in their arms, and carried him along by a continuation
of the same low winding excavation in the rock.
On turning a sharp projecting point, Bentley perceived
a wider opening ; the roof was higher, and supported
by two masses of rock, which had been left to form
natural pillars ; another flat mass in the middle served
as a sort of table, and against the side were fastened
three torches, the red glare from which fell on those men
who stood round it, the lower part of their faces covered
with black crape, and one of whom seemed to start when
he saw Bentley. On the table was a Bible, a skull, a
glass containing a red liquor, a drawn sword, a brace of
pistols, a dagger, and two pikes such as those which
Bentley had seen in the cart. It was not, indeed,
at first that he perceived all this, for the sight so
sickened him that he would have sunk back and fainted,
had not Connell, who was at his side, once more put
the spirits to his mouth, and forced him to swallaw some.
"We'd better make haste," said the man who had
seemed to recognize Bentley ; " there's no time for
speechifying ; and he must get his wound dressed.
Make him kneel down."
And placing him on his knees, and supporting him
they put the Bible into his hand, and proceeded to
administer the oath. It was a strange, awful rhapsody-
strange, in that it mixed up religion and rebellion, blood.
shed and justice, appeals to the Divine Being, with
pledges of crime to man,but binding the swearer,
never, on earth or sea, in winter or summer, in trouble
or wealth, to friend or foe, living or dying, to reveal the
secrets, or do harm or hurt to any member of the society
by whom that oath was administered to him. Bentley
shuddered with terror as he heard the curses imprecated
on him who should violate it; and when at the close, he

heard the most holy names appealed to to give sanction
to it (for even a society of rebels and murderers find they
cannot govern without the aid of some appeal to another
world, cannot rule without professing their belief in a
religion), he was about to make a solemn protest and
remonstrance against such an awful mockery, but Con-
nell pressed his hand, and fear once more predominated
over the voice of his conscience. He could not say
" Amen," as it was uttered in a deep voice by all the
persons present, but he kissed the Bible as it was placed
to his lips, and was about to rise, with a deep sense of
degradation and remorse, when he was forced down
once more on his knees, and each person taking up one
of the weapons off the rock which served for the table,
and holding them close at his breast, he was ordered to
repeat after them, " May these pikes pierce my heart,
and this blood be on my head, if I break this oath which
I have taken !" At the close they put the glass to his
mouth, but Bentley shuddered with horror as the smell
betrayed its loathsome contents, and with unutterable
disgust he threw it from him, and the glass fell to the
ground.
" He refuses it !" said the leader. " Away with
him!"
" He tasted it, he did taste it," cried Connell ;
look upon his lips !" and with some dexterity he con.
trived to smear upon them some of the blood which had
fallen on his own hand. "He's a safe man! I know
he's safe! Take my life for his. I know he's safe!"
And with all the cloquence of an Irishman the poor fellow
began again enumerating all Bentley's kindnesses and
charities, and urging his claims to mercy. "But he's
gone," he cried, " he's clean gone ;" as he turned and
found that Bentley had fainted away.
"Carry him off," said the leader; " we'll hold you
responsible for him."
" Yes," said Connell ; and with the help of one of
his companions he bore him away.

CHAPTER I.
The sun was streaming in through the lattice, when
Bentley awoke to a full consciousness of what had passed
in that frightful night. As he threw his eyes round the
little low whitewashed room in which he lay, he could
recognise nothing as familiar to him; but it was clean and
decent. The pallet on which he was stretched was fur-
nished with a white curtain ; a deal table at the side
contained a bottle and glass, and some linen, which
seemed intended to be used in dressing his wound; an
his clothes had been carefully folded and arranged on an
old worsted-worked chair at the foot of the bed. There
were also on the walls some coarse colored prints repre.
senting saints, and one of the Blessed Virgin with the
Infant Saviour in her arms; and a roughly-carved crucifix
of bone was placed over the chimney ; and lying on the
bed, turned down so as to mark the place, was a volume,
which Bentley took up, and found it to be a book of Ro.
man Catholic devotion>" the Hours of the Blessed
Virgin." Before he could look into it farther he heard
the footseps of two persons coming softly up the stairs ;
and one of them gently opening the door, they both came
in. One was a man-young, but his countenance mark.
ed already with strong lines, and his dress that of one of
the superior miners. As Bentley looked on him he
almost fancied that he recognized his face; and the same
kind of impression seemed to be made on the man him-
self, for he started slightly on seeing Bentley, and took care
to place himself with his back to the light, that his coun-
tenance might be less noticed. The other person was a
female. She was dressed in a habit of coarse black stuff,

only relieved by a square fold of linen of the purest white
round her neck, and a white bandage above her forehead
to confine a black veil of the same stuff with her dress,
which veil hung down and concealed her hair, and all
but a portion of her face. She had a rosary of large
black beads round her neck, with a crucifix of ebony
depending from it; and the singular purity and serenity
of her features, accompanied by a look of abstraction,
grave and solemnized, yet full of mildness, gave to a face
by no means young or beautiful an expression which
riveted the attention of Bentley more than anything he
had ever seen.
"How are you this morning ?" asked the young man.
And he proceeded, with a hand evidently skilled in sur.
gery, to unfasten the bandages of Bentley's wound, and
prepared to dress it anew. Bentley thanked him for his
trouble, and would fain have asked where he was, and
who were the parties before him; but the first attempt
he made to question his attendant was replied to by a
surly admonition to remain quiet : and the burning of his
hand and blackness of his parched lips were enough to
justify the warning against any excitement. With a tread
evidently accustomed to a sick room, and moving noise.
lessly about, without officiousness, the Sister of Charity
(for the female was one of those admirable women) aided
the man in his operations ; and when they were conclu-
ded, and the Sister had smoothed the pillow, and placed
some toast-and-water by the bed-side, they both with.
drew, leaving Bentley to fall once more into a disturbed
slumber. When he awoke he was apparently still alone,
but his curtain had been closed, and stretching out his
hand to put it aside, he saw the same female as before ;
but she was kneeling with her back towards him, and
with her eyes upturned to the image of the Virgin, she
was repeating to herself her devotions, with a depth and
fervency of feeling which Bentley dared not intrude on.
He let the curtain silently fall again, that he might not
interrupt her. When they were finished she rose up and
quietly approached the bed to see if he was still asleep.
Bentley could not but thank her earnestly for her caro

as
of him; but his gratitude was mixed with a strange feel.
ing of suspicion and dislike at being thus brought into
contact with a Roman Catholic, of whom he entertained
all the vague and irrational alarm which has been diffu.
sed among Protestants by the coarse indiscriminate
abuse of everything that is found in their system. It was
irrational, because indiscriminating ; because it made no
separation between the Catholicism and the Popery of
the system, and thus gave as many triumphs to Popery
it
gave to it opportunities of evading just condemna.
tions, by exposing the fallacies of unjust. At one moment
there flashed across him a suspicion that the whole was
a premeditated scheme. He thought of the new chapel
rising at Hawkstone-of the zeal with which he himself
had preached against Popery,--of the importance which
would be attached (for Bentley, like most other adversa.
ries and advocates, rated his own services rather high,
and like most other popular preachers, sank at times into
a little vanity) to the removal of so dangerous a foe as
himself to the corruptions and abominations of Popery.
But to reconcile such a thought with the mere accident
which took him back to the ruins, and with the mode in
which Connell, Roman Catholic as he was, had acted,
was impossible. It was in vain that he endeavored to
draw from the Sister an explanation of his situation.
She denied, and apparently with truth and sincerity, all
knowledge of what had passed, and showed no desire
to hear anything. And again recommending him to re-
pose, she left the room.
About an hour afterwads she returned with some food
for him; and when Bentley, invigorated by it, requested
her to procure a Bible for him, she seemed more disposed
to enter into conversation. A Bible, indeed, was not to
be proured, except an old copy of the Vulgate ; but she
brought him some books of her own devotions, and
among them Thomas  Kempis's  Imitation of Christ ;'
and as she placed them on the table, she could not help
saying, " But, perhaps, you will not like these ; they
belong to us.

them down in despair, while something like an expres.
sion of disgust and indignation passed over his counte-
- And you have no Bible ?" he asked.
"Yes," she replied, " here is one ; but it is in
Latin."
" And you cannot read this ?" he asked.
"No," said the Sister; " but we have portions read
in the chapel ; and we have the Lives of the Saints,
and our  Hours,' and many other devotional works."
Bentley sighed deeply.
" And you are one, then, of those," she replied,
"who believe that every thing Catholic is corrupt ?"
Bentley made no objection to her use of the term
Catholic, for he was little aware of the danger of allowing
it to be thus abused by restricting its application to
Romanism.
"I do, indeed," he said, " lament bitterly over the sad
delusions in which you are lying ; and I would do much
to win you from them.'
"We think," she answered, " that you rather are
laboring under delusions, and preaching corruptions.
You have broken off from the great body of the Church.
beyond which there can be no salvation ; and
you
have
invented new rites and new doctrines of your own ; and
your lives exhibit no high picture of what a Christian's
should be. And instead of being united in that bond of
peace, you are broken up into factions and dissensions ;
and the State, on which you leaned for support, is now
found to be a broken reed, and is ready to pierce your
hand."
Bentley was surprised to hear the mode in which
the Sister addressed him. He did not know that contro.
versial questions made a considerable part of the educa.
tion of Roman Catholics, whether male or female, who
are destined by their Church for positions of trust: and
that the corporate character of the monastic societies in
which that Church abounds, gives to their members
generally a dignity and self-confidence in the importance
of their own position, as well as a sense of honorable
dependence and obedience, which unite the two great

7
elements of what is called good mamiars, and invests
even persons raised from the lower classes with a
superior character and address.
He roused himself,
however, to remonstrate with her on what he considered
some of the grossest abominations of Popery. But her
answer to all he said was steady and quiet. It was the
Church who taught her; she did not like in such matcers
to depend on her own judgment ; she believed what the
Apostles believed, and what the Fathers taught ; and
would not willingly be wise in her own eyes, or trust a
her own understanding.
It was in vain that Bentley referred her to the
Bible. The Bible, she said, was to be read under the
teaching of the Church ; it might easily be wrested to
the destruction of rash and ignorant men, who would
listen to no guidance ; and she could not put upon it, by
her own judgment, weak and fallible as it was, any
meaning contrary to the received declarations of the
Holy Catholic Church. Into all this discussion tho
Sister entered temperately, and yet earnestly, and with a
power of expression and reasoning which excited Bent-
ley's surprise. Still more surprised was he to find that
all his own observations were powerless against her.
He spoke strongly, as he felt deeply; and used expres.
sions which, however just as a description of the form
which Popery assumes in the lowest and most ignorant
of its followers, were neither true nor respectful in re.
gard to the person whom he was addressing. For this is
the great secret of Popery, and the mystery of its
staength, that under the same forms and outward com.
prehension it contains several distinct applications of
itself, and becomes all things to all men, without any
open compromise of opinion. The answer of the Sister
was still the same. She asked Bentley on what autho-
rity he rested his own belief, and he answered, on the
Bible.
She replied, "On your own interpretation of the
Bible, is it not ?"
And when Bentley, though earnest at first in assert-
ing the one clear, self-er ident sense ai the Bible, was
## p. 8 (#364) ##############################################
HAWKSTONE.
compelled to acknowledge that different interpretations
might be and were given and defended, and that each
person must take and must defend his own upon his own
responsibility, she preferred, she said, the opinion of the
Church to the opinion of any individual.
And when Bentley, abandoning his first ground,
threw himself on the authority of the Reformers, she
answered, that she preferred the testimony of a Church
which traced itself to the Apostles, and had continued
firm for eighteen hundred years, to one only two hundred
years old, and which had its origin in individuals like
Henry VIII., Luther and Calvin. Bentley spoke of the
virtues and holiness of the Reformers ; but the Sister
replied by the lives of the many self-denying holy men
who have lived in the Romi Church. She asked if
Protestants could boast of more, or even of as many ?
She contrasted the comforts and indulgences of many
a Protestant clergyman, his domestic blessings and
modern refinements, with the discipline and asceticism
of a monastic life. And though Bentley poured forth
all his eloquence against such corruptions from Gospel
truth, he could not deny, that, in itself, a life of self-
denying religion was higher than one of mere innocent
enjoyment.
" And you are yourself a nun ?" he said ; for, added
to other defects which incapacitated him from entering
successfully into the controversy with Popery, he knew
little of its interior regulations.
"I am a Sister of Charity," she replied.
"And your occupation is 
"To attend the sick, chiefly," she replied, " in this
place. But we have also a school, and we visit the poor,
and give our priest information which he requires in the
management of his flock."
" I cannot but wonder," said Bentley, "that you
have
been allowed to establish yourself here.
Is there not a
law against it?"
The countenance of the Sister underwent a change;
and, almost with indignation, she exclaimed, " And do
you forbid others to do what you neglect to do your.

ness ?
Are not your manufacturers and you: mining
proprieters accumulating thousands every year by the
sweat and the blood of the poor? Do they not draw
them from places where they may be within reach of
religion, and herd them together here without a church,
or a minister, or the Sacraments, or the Bible, leaving
them in the midst of a land which calls itself Christian
in a state worse than heathens-worse, because, without
the knowledge of their God, or the means of approaching
Him, you have given them the knowledge of the world,
and of the devil ? And when we would come among
them, and devote ourselves to their care, you repel us with
jealousy and abuse."
Bentley was silent.
" Will you think," she continued,
horrible accidents necessarily happen in this district ?
Scarcely a day occurs without some loss of life or limb
by explosions, or falls, or entanglement with machinery,
without speaking of the fearful disorders to which labors
like these are subject. Has Sir Matthew Blake, or any
other proprietor who thrives in luxury upon these risks
and sufferings-has he laid by any portion of his vast
wealth, to found even an hospital for those who lose their
strength, or their limbs, or their life, in pampering his
insatiable covetousness? And if we have been sent here
to undertake this work of mercy, are we to be treated
with scorn and contempt ?"'
Bentley was still silent, for many most painful thoughts
were crowding on him.
" But you are weary, I see," she said, gently, as he
sunk back on his pillow; 6 and you must not talk any
more. I was wrong in allowing it. But you are a
Prostestant ; and whenever you hear our religion abused,
will you remember that you were once nursed by Catho.
lic Sisters of Charity ?"
Bentley replied with fervor, that he should never for-
get it. And as she lefi the room he lay back, with less

anxiety, to think over the prospect before him. He
would, indeed, willingly have made use of some of the
devotional works which the Sister had brought him ; but
in the midst of the most elevated piety he was startled
and terrified at the language in which the Blessed Vir.
gin was appealed to, and made the centre of the wor.
shipper's hopes and affections, almost to the exclusion of
the Almighty. And as this frightful instance of the
Mariolatry of the Romish Church was brought back
palpably to his mind, he felt the favorable impressions
die away which had been made by the Sister of Charity.
Why or how it was that he was unable to cope with her
in argument he could not see ; but he felt that his cause
was right, and yet he knew not how to defend it-knew
not, in one word, that the principles of the Sister were,
for the most part, true, but that her facts were false ;
and that nothing but a knowledge of facts could show the
inconsistency between the professions of Popery and its
real conduct-between its pretended antiquity and real
noveltyand so enable the Church to defeat it by its
own arguments. In the midst of these reflections he
once more sank into a sleep, and woke to find the Sister
again sitting by the side of his bed, and another female
in the same dress, but older and more matronly, looking
on him with her.
" He is young, and seems good and amiable," said
the elder Sister. "How sad that he should be lost in
heresy, and cut off from the Church !"
The younger sighed; but Bentley awoke just then,
and they told him that it was necessary to look at the
dressing of the wound. As Bentley prepared himself for
the operation, the same man came into the room whom
he had seen at first, and catching his full face in the light,
Bentley could not refrain from calling him by his name
"What, Cookesley ?" he cried"How are you here?"
But Cookesley stood behind the Sisters, and with his
finger to his lips motioned him to be silent. The Sis.
ters scemed surprised at the recognition, but Cookesley
himself made some remark on Bentley's having mistaken
him, ant, busy with their work of benevolence, they sel.

however, the man proposed remaining a little to make
some medical inquiries of Bentley, and the Sisters with.
drew. He waited for a short time with his finger to his
mouth, until they had gone down stairs ; and then com.
ing up to the bed-side, he suffered Bentley to put out his
hand, which he took kindly as that of an old acquaintance.
"Cookesley," said Bentley, "is it possible this can
be you ?"
" And I may say the same to you, may I not ?" an-
swered the other. " Is it possible this can be you ?"
And he affected to smile, but it was with an expression
of shame and sorrow, which he could ill conceal.
" And what are you doing here in this dress?" asked
Bentley. "Have
you
left London ? I thought you were
walking the hospitals there? When we met last you
were just going there,"
Cookesley affected again to laugh, and said, "Oh,
that's all over; but you see, happily for you, I have not
forgotten the art."
" And your father and mother," said Bentley, " do
they know you are here?"
" Oh, yes, yes, all's right," muttered Cookesley.
But Bentley saw by the working of his countenance
that all was not right; and as the recollection of days
came over him when they had been school-fellows to.
gether and companions, living in the same town, and
associating in all their amusements, he could not help
feeling alarmed at his present appearance under such
circumstances.
" Are you in business here ?" said Bentley.
"Yes, yes, in business; but you must not ask
questions."
And the hard dirty hands and coarseness of dress re-
futed Bentley's suggestion.
Cookesley, however, would not allow him to say more,
but proceeded cautiously to the door, called to some one
at the bottom of the stairs, ordered them to make no noise,
and not to come up stairs ; that the sick person was going
to sleep, and he would watch him for half an hour. And

then returning and bolting the door softly, he came and
stood before the bed.
"" Bentley," he said, with a low voice, " can you keep
up your nerves ? are you frightened ?"
"I am in the hands of Providence," said Bentley;
" and though I know that I must be in danger, I can re-
sign myself to Him."
A slight sneer passed over Cookesley's face at the
mention of Providence.
" Providence has not taken much care of you just
now," he said, "except that you have met with me; and
I can't forget old days."
"Providence will take care of me,
" said Bentley,
firmly ; " I have no fear."
"You have taken the oath ?" said Cookesley.
"I have," said Bentley.
" And do you mean to keep it ?"
" Most assuredly!"
"Your life depends on it," said Cookesley.
" And are you then," asked Bentley, "mixed up in all
these criminal proceedings and plots, whatever they are ?"
did not recognise me," said Cookesley;
" but of course you could not. You didn't like the taste
of our wine, ah !"
"Horrible !" exclaimed Bentley, shuddering at the
recollection. "And you to partake in such a frightful
act of mockery ?"
" It may be mockery, or mummery, or anything you
please to call it," said the other; " but what are your
crowns, and sceptres, and bishops' wigs, and judges' red
gowns, but mockery and mummery? And it does very
well to hold our fellows together. They believe it all;
and we wiser ones-
"O Cookesley, Cookesley !" cried Bentley, "are
you then one of the leaders of these abandoned men ?"
66 I am one of those who can serve you in the scrape
you have got into. How you managed to get into such
a mess I can't tell ; but they do say you grave people do
sometimes commit little indiscretions, like sillier folks !
Eh! Bentley ?"
And so you

And in Cookesley's face there was an expression of
ironical intelligence which made Bentley feel uncom-
fortable.
"What brought you to the ruins at that time of night,
Master Bentley, eh!" and he laughed significantly.
" Mere accident," said Bentley ;
66 I had lost my
watch."
" Mere accident, pure accident !" replied Cookesley,
with the same significant, intelligent laugh. 6. All these
things are mere accident. And so, when that fellow
Wheeler was going to shoot his wife, you, like a gallant
hero, preferred getting stabbed yourself."
And again he laughed. All this to Bentley's mind
was unintelligible ; and he was proceeding to explain
the facts, but Cookesley, looking at a heavy silver watch
which he pulled out of his coarse workmen's trousers,
told him they had no time for joking now.
You must
do something for me at once, or I cannot help you."
" I will do nothing," said Bentley, " unless you will
tell me something of yourself, where you have been, and
what you are doing. I cannot commit myself farther
in perfect blindness as to the hands into which I have
fallen."
" Would you hear my history ?" said Cookesley
" It is short enough.".
" I went to London, as you know ; I carried there
much the same kind of education that young boys get at
school and at home. I walked the hospitals, cut up
bodies and cut off limbs, till I cared no more for the
living than I did for the dead. We had a good merry
party together-Charles Brown, and Harry Morson, and
all that set. My father complained that I spent all his
money; my mother, that I lost my religion. You know,
Bentley, as a boy, I always hated canting and preaching ;
and my mother did nothing else, and my father used to
laugh at her. We spent our mornings in tossing about
dead men's flesh in the dissecting-room, and our after-
noons in dressing wounds and plastering fractures ; and
at night there was the play, and the Shades, and the little
rattlers, and a thousand other little nameless amuse-

ments. And then came the constable ; and then more
applications for money ; and there were other persons
I had to support besides myself; for I, too, have done
foolish things."
And once
more he threw into his
countenance, evidently agitated as it was by the tale he
was telling, another glance of ironical intelligence.
" And all this went on till one daybut never mind," he
said, abruptly, "why look back to what can't be helped ?
You were more fortunate than I was. You were sent to
college, and I suppose there you did learn to be grave
and serious. And I never had any one to take care of
Turned adrift in London-all of us together, all
young, no homes to go to, and all kinds of misery to
witness--why it turns one's stomach, and hardens one's
heart. And that's the best I can say for myself, and for
hundreds of others. How can they expect us to come to
anything else?
And Bentley gazed on the altered,
vitiated, and melancholy countenance of one whom he
had known as a boy full of spirit and promise, and he
saw Cookesley's eyes moisten for a moment ; but the
unhappy man soon cast away the feeling.

little what becomes of me. A few months

And what matters it? Mors eterna quies,' as you know
we used to learn at school, and as our old master, Dr.
Ellison, always repeated when he showed us how the
brain thought, and the nerves felt, and the stomach
lived of itself-- Mors terna quies !' And perhaps my
time is come ; and I've had enough of life. 'Tis but a
poor thing after all."
And Bentley would have followed up the subject,
und spoken to him in a different tone, but Cookesley once
more checked him.
6. We have no time now for talking of these matters.
You are in a bad plight, I honestly tell you ; and though
I can be of use to you, and will be for old remembrance
sake" (and he pressed his hand kindly), "you must do as
I bid yo. Are yo: strong e:10:1gh to write ?"
"Quite," said Bentley, for he fint much better

"Here, then," said Cookesley, "take this pen (I'll
hold the paper), and write to your old housekeeper
that
you
will be home in two or three days; and that you
are staying with a friend, and have sprained your ankle-
that's all."
Once more Bentley felt a little scruple at putting his
signature to a false statement, even under his present cir-
cumstances. But once more the warning of Cookesley
that he was in danger, triumphed over his conscience,
and he wrote the letter.
" We must keep the thing quiet," said Cookesley.
" If they get frightened about your disappearance, and
begin making a search, all is over with you ; it would
be as bad for you as for Wheeler, or for us. Hush it all
up; and in a few days I think we can manage to send
you back quietly. One thing I can tell you is, that you
have had a most narrow escape already ; nothing but
the earnestness of that Irish fellow Connell, and the way
in which he told our people what you had done for him,
and how much you did for the poor, would have saved
you. We've too great a stake just now to trust our-
selves in the mercy of any one.
And we've hands
with us which are ready enough for any job, and would
as soon put a foe out of the way in a dark night by the
side of a coal-pit, as soldiers would in open day on a field
of battle. And, after all, where's the difference ?"
Cookesley," said Bentley, " I entreat you not to talk
in so frightful a manner."
"Pooh! pooh ! " muttered Cookesley. "Mors

nify to either of us ? And now let me give you another
warning. Speak to no one ; know no one ; and do not
attempt to move. I'll do my best for you.

CHAPTER II.
It was about the same hour that Cookesley left Bentley
on his bed, when Charles Bevan and Villiers, to the
extreme interest and jealousy of Mrs. Crump, who was
still at her bow-window, and to the equal surprise and
curiosity of the Miss Morgans, who were assuaging their
noonday appetite by a couple of cheesecakes at Machem's
the pastrycook's-arrived, and knocked at Mabel's green
entrance-door. At the announcement of Villiers's name
it was impossible for Mabel, with all her dignity, to
prevent a slight suffusion of gratified pride and expectation
from mixing with her surprise at a visit so unexpected
from such an interesting and important personage. She
had already in her own mind (having heard early in the
morning of the removal of his incognito) settled that he
was to accept the office of president of the Ladies'
Missionary Society, to become patron of the National
Schools, to revive a dropped subscription of the old
General of five pounds five shillings annually to the
Benevolent Society, to undertake to support Lady Sud-
borne in holding a stall at the next bazaar, and to place
himself in confidential communication with her, Miss
Mabel, on all the important questions of the Hawkstone
charitable and religious associations. She had almost
pledged herself to lay before him at the first opportunity
the papers of the Rome Missionary and Papal Conver.
sion Plan. But Mabel was a person prudent in her
zeal, and resolved for the present to withhold any com.
munication on this subject, until she had discovered
1
## p. 17 (#373) #############################################

17
whether, what she sadly feared, Villiers was an Oxford
man. " An Oxford man," was Mabel's expression ,
for Mr. Bevan had long since warned her against the
vulgar use of the other epithet applied to the opinions
which all men who support the Church are supposed
to hold.
Her agreeeble feelings were not at all diminished by
the frank, kind, and, at the same time, the respectful way,
in which Villiers apologized for his intrusion ; for Charles
Bevan had already explained to him Mabel's character.
And whatever opinion Villiers might entertain of the
soundness of her views, or of the expediency of her mode
of carrying them into effect, he could not but esteem and
be disposed to like her.
" Never," he said to Bevan as they came to the door,
never ridicule individuals who are endeavoring zeal-
ously and honestly to do good, though in a wrong way,
until they have been shown, and refused to follow, the
right way. This way our Church of late years has
failed to point out ; and I admire the earnestness and the
motives of those who, without her aid, are striving to do
good, far more than I condemn their mistakes, or excuse
that inactivity on our part, which is the real cause of all
the mischief. Teach them the right way, and where
there is honesty and zeal we shall have all their exertions
with us."
Bevan agreed, but he felt also that there was a little
rebuke contained in the words ; for he was himself
inclined, though not ill-naturedly, to laugh at individuals
as well as at opinions which he did not approve of, and
to amuse himself with Mabel's inconsistencies rather
more than was quite agreeable to that lady's feelings.
Villiers, older in mind, and sobered down by trials, never
laughed at any one.
"I am come," said Villiers, after the usual introduc-
tion, "to request some information from you, as the person
most acquainted with the subject, respecting the state of
the schools in Hawkstone. I want to place a poor boy
at one ; and both Mr. Atkinson and my friend Bevan
assure m? that cannot apply for advice to any one so

well as to Miss Brook." Mabel inclined her head with
dignity, and begged they would be seated.
" I believe I may venture to guess," she said, "at
the object of your bounty"for she had heard as much
from Mrs. Connell ; and however well bred, she could
scarcely resist the temptation of bestowing her eulogistic
patronage on so distinguished a person.
" Mr. Villiers must be aware of the admiration which
we have all felt for the heroism with which he rescued
the poor boy from his frightful danger."
Villiers smiled; and acknowledged that he was de.
sirous of putting Connell's boy into some good school.
He had found him sadly neglected, apparently accustomed
io very bad company, as might indeed be imagined.
" But there is something about him," he said, "which
has singularly interested mean extraordinary likeness.
And it will be sad if the hand of Providence has saved
him from an early death, only to make him criminal and
miserable in after life."
Mabel gravely assented ; and with a little conscious
importance, she proceeded to turn
over papers, and
tickets, and little piles of bills, and an assortment of
flannels and ginghams which had just arrived for the
choice of the Dorcas Society.
" My list of schools," she said, " is rather long.
There is of course the National School, and the Grey
School, and the Bluecoat School, and Mr. Elton's Aca-
demy for young gentlemen, and Mr. Dawson's Seminary,
and the Establishment at the top of the High Street, and
Mr. Polewell's Commercial Gymnasium. But I wished
particularly to find out a paper (I dare say you have seen
it in the shop-windows)but it was for to-morrowa
grand public examination of the boys at the New Na.
tional Athenum and Polytechnic Lyceum-quite a new
thing for Hawkstone. The plan has been tried in
London, and succeeded admirably. Government have
assisted us here; and Dr. Bray, the celebrated Dr. Bray,
the secretary to the parent institution in London, has
come down. And Mrs. Maddox takes great interest
in it. Indeed it seems as if it would work quite a

my
revolution in our system of education-so easy, and yet
so comprehensive."
" Pray," said Bevan, dear Miss Brook, do not
trouble yourself on my account, for I know the paper by
heart. It has been before my eyes every day during the
last week.
There was
a syllabus of the subjects of
examination in it, was there not ?"
"Oh dear, yes," said Miss Brook.
"But you are
laughing, as you always are," she continued, as she
looked
up and caught a smile on Bevan's lips.
Villiers also smiled, but it was a grave smile, with
no tinge of sarcasm.
" Why will you charge me with laughing," said
Bevan,  when I am by far the gravest person in
Hawkstone ? Besides, I can show you that I am serious.
Did not the summary of the last examination run in this
way :-Analysis of physical sciences-causes, properties,
affinities, attractions, energies ; Fire-ignition, com-
bustion, flame, caloric ; Water-decomposition, fluidity,
solidity ; electricity, magnetism, atmospheric gases,
space, motion ; new theory as explanatory ofhori-
zontal, ascending, descending, reflected, pendulous, roll-
ing, diagonal, rotary and planetary motion ; recapitulation
of moral principles, concluding with rhetoric, ethics,
geology, pneumatics, astronomy, metaphysics, moral
cosmogony, politics, botany, chemistry, history, ancient
and modern, poetry, manufactures, agriculture, mnem.
onics, horsemanship, dancing, arithmetic, geometry,
cookery, the art of swimming, painting, sculpture,
anatomy, music, ontology, and deontology ?"
Stop, stop!" cried Mabel ; "all the latter part is
your own invention."
My own invention !" said Bevan. 66 You know
that every one of these was contained in the paper, though
they might not all have come together in one clause."
" But you are laughing at it," insisted Mabel.
"Mr. Villiers," said Bevan, "saw the paper himself;
and we both read it together."
" I hope Mr. Villiers will not suffer himself to be
corrupted by your sad res notions," said Mabel, partly
66

in sober sadness, and partly in curious inquiry as to the
state of Villiers's principles.
Villiers only bowed, and smiled again.
" I ought not," he said, " to trespass on your time,
which I know is so fully occupied; but my friend Bevan
told ine that you could give me information generally on
the state of the schools and education in Hawkstone.
Connected as I am with it, and hoping soon to be a resi-
dent in the neighborhood, and to take an interest in its
welfare, I am naturally desirous to ascertain the state of
its population and its principal wants."
Mabel was delighted; it was the very thing which
she had anticipated-evidently an overture to her accept-
ing the office of head almoner, and prime minister of
charities to Villiers himself. And once more commenc.
ing an ineffectual search among papers, and linen, and
work-baskets (for Mabel had a work-basket, though she
had no time to use it), she was obliged at last to abandon
the task, and resuming an erect and important secretarial
posture, with pen and ink before her --"Mr. Villiers,"
she said, " would probably like that I should begin at the
beginning. He" (with a stress upon the word) "will,
I am sure, be rejoiced to know that we have established
an infant school lately, and have seventy children in it
already."
" What a frightfully large family!" said Bevan;
all orphans too !"
" Orphans !" said Mabel ; "no, not orphans. I think
Betsy Hatchett is the only one that has lost her mother.
Oh, yes ! there is Jane Jobson ; but I do not recollect any
other. How could you think they were orphans ?"
"I thought," said Bevan, "you and Miss Atkins, the
schoolmistress, had undertaken the care and education of
them ?"
" And so we have," said Mabel; " but that does not
inake them orphans. Their parents are alive for all that."
" Did you buy thern ?" asked Bevan, gravely.
Buy them! What can you mean ?"
"I mean, did their parents sell them to you? How
did you come into possession of them ?"
6 and

HAWKSTONE.
21
Possession of them !" said Mabel.
** How I wish,
Mr. Villiers, you would teach Mr. Bevan not to be so
sarcastic !"
" I am not sarcastic," said Bevan; "I am speaking
seriously. Suppose some morning a policeman were to
come into my room, and find me busy in teaching tricks
to your little dog there" (for Mabel did indulge in the
luxury of a pug dog), " and encouraging it to come to
me at all hours, and to follow me, and not you, when I
called it-taking care of it, in fact, and educating it in an
infant dog's school ; and when he looked at the collar
round the neck, suppose he found it marked, not with my
name, but Miss Mabel Brook's, with a charge to return
it to the owner if lost ;-do you not think he might fairly
ask me how I came into possession of the little animal,
and whether I had bought it ?"
"Little animal!" said Mabel. "It's such a beauty,
only look at its tail! Is it not a beauty, Mr. Villiers ?'.
And Villiers was obliged to stoop down and pat the little
monster; but he did not say it was a beauty, for he never
said what he did not think.
" I hope the poor little thing will never fall into your
hands," said Mabel, taking it up, and fondling it.
" And why not?" said Bevan.
" Because you would not know how to take care of it,
in the first place; then, you would never love it as I do ;
and, I am sure, it would never love you."
" Not if I taught it tricks," said Bevan, " and made
it stand upon its hind legs, and put out its paw, and per-
haps spell a word or two with letters on the ground?
You know there have been reading pigs; and why not a
reading dog? I can't tell
you
how many
tricks I know
which I could teach itto jump up when bidden, and to
wag its tail, and toss up a bit of biscuit from its nose and
catch it in its mouth, and to ring the bell. In short, it
night learn any thing, and become quite an accomplished
dog, highly educated and enlightened, even for these days."
" I do not think," said Mabel, " that teaching a dog
tricks is the way to make him love you. It is leading
it, nursing it, having it with you, taking it out ou your

walks, keeping it constantly with you in your room, talk-
ing to it, as I talk to my little pet. Don't I talk to you?"
she said, stooping down almost to kiss the dog. "When
it looks up to you every day for its food and comfort, and
knows no one's voice but yours, it will love you, and not
before. I cannot tell you how my poor pet whines and
moans when I am away from it, and how it bounds about
and frisks when I return."
"But do let me try the experiment," said Bevan; " do
let your dog come to me every day, and let me toach it
some tricks."
" No, indeed !" said Mabel ; " for if it did not love
you, it would not obey you, or learn any thing from you,
unless, indeed, you had recourse to a whip, which I could
not bear; and if it did love you, why it would not love me.
And I think it ought to love me, for I saved its life.
There were some idle boys going to drown it, and I
bought it of them, when quite a puppy, for a shilling ;
and therefore, as I gave it its life, I think I have a claim
that it should love me ; and it does love me very much."
And the dog put out his tongue to lick her hand.
"I must confess," said Villiers, that Miss Brook's
theory of affection seems as sound as it is deep. It
would scarcely be fair, perhaps, to ask if the fathers and
mothers of the seventy infants entertained the same
opinions ?"
" I am afraid the fathers and mothers," said Mabel,
not exactly understanding the drift of the question, but
feeling that some mischief was contained in it, "I fear
the fathers and mothers have no theory of affection, or
of any thing. They are a most sad, ignorant, profligate
set, who bring up their children to nothing but vice and
idleness. These sad manufactories, Mr. Villiers ! they
have quite ruined Hawkstone. High wages to-day, and
none to-morrow; and the children, as soon as they can
earn a penny, sent to the factories, and the mothers the
same ; never at home by their own fire-sides : so that if
we did not step in, and take the care of the poor little
children, I know not what would become of them. Not

soon as they begin to run about, they are allowed to play
in the streets, where they hear and see all kinds of hor.
rible things. Surely," she turned to Bevan, "you
would not wish such a state of things to continue, though
you do ridicule our infant school ?"
"I must protest," said Bevan, " against such an in-
sinuation, even from a lady's lips. I do not ridicule
infant schools, and I do not wish such a state of things to
continue. But whether infant schools are exactly the
best means of remedying it, I may, perhaps, doubt."
" But what can you do ?" said Mabel.
" Why, having objected," said Bevan," to your plans,
I think I am bound to produce my own; and I will
therefore propound to you my theoryan Oxford theory,
Miss Brook.'
Oh, no, no," cried Mabel; "I will hear nothing
of
your Oxford notions. I know what they will be ;
something about Popery, I am sure." And she looked
inquiringly at Villiers, to see what impression was made
on him by the word Oxford. But Villiers only smiled in
his own quiet way, with a tinge of sadness in it.
" Shall I tell you a story, then ?" said Bevan.
"Oh! by all means," said Mabel, "provided it is not
about some Popish saint."
" No," said Bevan, 66 my story is about a doctor.
There was once upon a time, a doctor, who lived
"In the west of England, of course," interrupted
Villiers, laughingly; "all heroes of tales, in this day,
live in the west of England !"
" Yes," said Bevan, " in the west of England; and
he was called in one day to see a poor man who had a mor-
tification in his chest, and was evidently dying. And in
the same village there lived a lady, one of the most be-
nevolent of her sex, charitable beyond her means, presi-
dent of five societies, secretary to five others, patroness
and superintendent of the infant school, and I rather
think," he added, glancing at the splendid diploma which
lay open on the table, " that she was an honorary vice-
president of the Grand Royal and National African

ing and half offended, " I must not be caricatured in this
way. You know you are joking at me."
" Pray," said Bevan, " allow me to finish my story.
In the same village, then, with this doctor, lived this lady,
who, among her other charitable avocations, had taken
much interest in the distressing state of the poor sick
man, and one morning, about twelve o'clock, she called
on the doctor, and was shown into his private room.
Dr. Morris,' she said, "I have called to speak of the
state of poor Jackson. What is to become of him?
Madam,' said the doctor,  I fear there is little hope ; the
disease is approaching the vitals : and unless we could
expel it from thence, I see no chance of his recovery.'
Well,' said the lady, ' I quite agree with you. But still
something must be done. We cannot allow the poor
man to go on in this way, without some effort to save
him; and the nurse and I have just thought of two plans,
by which, at any rate, some good will be effected. You
say the limbs and extremities are not effected yet.' No,
madam,' replied Dr. Morris. Don't you think, then,'
said the lady, ' it might be as well to save them, at least ?'
Dr. Morris seemed puzzled by the question. Don't you
think,' continued the lady, - you could cut off the arms
and legs-amputate them, you know-and so they would
be saved, at any rate; the disease could not get to them.'
Dr. Morris rose silently, and rung his bell.  Or else,'
said the lady, "the other plan nurse and I thought of was,
without amputation, to apply a tourniquet to the limbs, so
that the blood from the body might not flow into them,
or only a very little now and then ; and so it would not
matter what became of the vitals, and the arms and legs
would be kept quite sound, and we could employ them as
we liked for any useful purposes of society. By this
time the doctor's bell was answered, and, with his assist.
ant, approaching the lady, he begged her to keep herself
quiet, persuaded her, under pretence of refreshment, to
swallow a composing draught, and immediately sent for
her friends, that she might be taken home under their
care, and not to be allowed to escape again."

"But," said Mabel, " we do not separate them wholly
from their parents. They go home every night, and are
at home on the Sundays, and several hours in the day."

quite a little one, worked me the other day, such a nice

And he put his fingers to his lips, as if calculating a sum.
"Pray," he said, "how is it that the mothers are obliged
to send their children so young to school ?"
Because," answered Mabel, rather fretfully, " be-
cause they have so much to do. Many of them have large
families, others have their work in the factories, and it is
impossible for one person to attend to all these things.
You know you must have an eye on children perpetually,
or they get into such mischief."
" Have any of the mothers in Hawkstone," asked
Bevan, " as many as seventy children?"
How can you talk such nonsense ? said Mabel, be.
coming angry " Poor things !" she continued, more
placably, for she could not help laughing at Bevan's
smile! " What would become either of parents or of
children with such a family ?"
" And what then is to become of you, Miss Brook,
and of your seventy children? I have been shuddering
at the thought of your fate ever since you avowed your
condition."
"How you persist," said Mabel, reproachfully, " in
taking every thing I say so literally. I do not mean,
she said-and what she was about to say no one can tell,
for she stopped short, and colored, and laughed" 1
mean, of course, that persons who undertake to educate
children, are their parents metaphorically ; not exactly
parents, you know, but in a figure."
" That is," said Bevan, " finding the parents unable
to educate their children, you undertake to educi le them
instead."
" Exactly," said Mabel.
" And the parents give them up to you ?":
6. Yes."

" And pray, what part is that ?'
Why, to teach them their lessons, and keep them

" And you propose to teach them every thing that is

good, and make them obedient, and dutiful, and religious,
and every thing they ought to be. Is it not so ?"
Certainly," said Mabel, "we wish to make them
good children."
" And pry, have the parents to teach them any thing
else ?"
"Why, yes--no-yes," said Mabel, hesitatingly.
" No, I do not know that they have."
" And pray, do you find this an easy task ? How do
you set about it?" said Bevan.
5 For I assure you I
have had some experience in education, and find it by no
means easy to make persons good, particularly children.
You whip them, of course ?"
" I hope not," said Mabel indignantly. "I trust all
punishment of that kind is discarded with us.
It is not
fear that can make children good."
"Nor, I conclude," said Bevan, " do you find that
learning their letters, or repeating their collects, or sing
ing together the cat purs-the cock crows-the dog
barksthe pig grunts, or jumping about like little
Merry Andrews, clapping their hands, and pretending to
be in play, till they yawn with sleepiness-you do not
find, I suppose, that this assists much in forming them to
virtue?"
"Of course not," said Mabel, angrily. 66 We make
them good by their love and affection to us; we wish
them to respect us, and be grateful to us, and do every
thing we bid them, for our sake."
"For your sake, and Miss Atkins' ?" asked Bevan,
half afraid lest he should offend her too much by his play-
ful interrogatories.
" Not exactly ours only," said Mabel, " but for the
sake of the subscribers generally, and all the ladies who
have helped to establish the school."
"And whom they see," said Bevan,

Is once a month time enough for children to learn to
love persons ?" he asked.
Why will you continue to take my words so lite-

their duty to us, and exciting their affection and gratitude
to us.
" And I know no means but affection and gratitude,"
said Villiers, kindly, coming to her support, " which can
be efficacious, humanly speaking, in education. Miss
Brook will find me on her side."
And Mabel was soothed and pleased with his appro-
bation.
" Suppose, then," continued Bevan, (and Mabel
affected to stop her ears, saying, she would not listen to
any more of his suppositions--they were all equally
bad); but Bevan persevered" suppose, my dear Miss
Brook, some fine morning, these seventy children were
to come to your door, telling you they had learned to
love you very much, and to respect you, and, as is natu-
rally the case with the affections of all young people, that
they now cared little for any one else, and did not like
their parents, who treated them harshly, and were bad
people, nor their homes, which were not half as clean
and airy as the school room; and that you had told them
you would be a mother to them; and that they loved you
much better than their real mother, and would do any
thing you bade them-pray, should you not be taken a
little by surprise ?"
" Indeed I should," said Mahel ; "and my first orders
would be, to go back to their parents, and to honor their
father and their mother; and to remember that I was
only their teacher, and not to be regarded by them in the
place of a real parent."
"Only a metaphorical one," said Bevan, laughing.
" I do not like sarcasm," said Mabel, gravely.
" Will you let me tell you the sequel, then, of the
story of the doctor ?" asked Bevan.
"No, indeed, I do not wish to hear any more."
" But I must indeed," continued Bevan; "Mr. Vil.
liers told it me himself."
" Oh, Mr. Villiers !" cried Mabel, " I did hope to
have had your support ; but I am afraid you are corrupt.
ed also with these sad Oxford notions."
Villiers only smiled, and shook his head.

6 I must tell
you the sequel," said Bevan. " The day
afterwards, the same lady, (for she had made her
escape
by a side door), called again on the doctor, and informed
him that she had taken into consideration the difficulty
of preserving the limbs from corruption, in case they
were amputated; and that she had a remedy which
would remove this objection. She had spoken to an.
other man, who had consented to have the limbs, when cut
off, fastened on to his own body. "And you know,' said the
lady, 'that they may be fastened on quite tightlysewed
on, in fact, and if they cannot be kept alive without be-
ing attached to some body or other, why this will do ;
and so they will still have a body to supply them with
nutriment and life, and to direct their movements.' It
will be as good as their original body, metaphorically,
you know," said Bevan archly.
Mabel was silent, and almost inclined to be seriously
indignant. "I am no philosopher, you are aware, Mr.
Bevan," she said ; " but I only know that the infant
schools have been established by some of the most reli-
gious and good men who ever lived; and I do think we
should exert ourselves to save these poor infants from
being led astray and ruined by the example of their
parents."
"I am sure," said Villiers, as a pacificator, " that
Mr. Bevan will join with you most cordially in this opin-
ion ; and so we must all."
" Most cordially," said Bevan, and he stretched out
his hand across the table in token of an amicable capitu-
lation,"most cordially ; only," he continued, as he took
Mabel's hand, which was very reluctantly given him,
and lay passively in his own" only I must tell you one
more story."
Villiers could not help laughing at his pertinacity.
" There was once on a time," said Bevan-
" Indeed, indeed," cried Mabel, " I cannot stop to
near any more stories; I have heard quite enough : but
Mr. Villiers will excuse me, I am sure. I am obliged to
attend a meeting of the Dispensary Committee at one
o'clock; and, instead of giving him any information

respecting the schools, we have wasted all the time in
hearing Mr. Bevan's sarcasms."
Stop, I entreat you !" said Bevan, one moment;
you must stop, only one more. There was once upon a
time a gentleman, and he lived"
"In the west of England ?" asked Villiers again.
'No, not in the west of England, this time," answer-
ed Bevan, " but at Bagdad; and this gentleman was very
fond of young animals of all kinds ; and one day they
brought him a young lion (it is true, indeed-perfectly
true), which they had found in the reeds on the banks of
the Tigris ; it was not much larger than a cat-quite an
infant, Miss Brook. The gentleman took compassion on
the poor little creature, and was particularly desirous
to rear it up in good sound principles--very different
principles, indeed, from those of its father and mother,
who were wandering about the desert sheep-stealing and
horse-stealing, and exceedingly fond of raw flesh. He
thought the best way to accomplish this would be to
place himself to it in the place of a parent-not a real
parent you know, only a metaphorical one. And as he
had no mamma lioness to give it suck, he constructed a
large leathern bag, with which he endeavored to supply
the little monster with food after its natural fashion. The
gentleman, as I said before, was particularly anxious to
extinguish its taste for animal food, and hoped that by
proper tenderness and management, especially by teach-
ing it to stand upright on its hind legs, and to pick out
the letters of the alphabet, this horrible taste would be
extirpated, and that it would learn to live on milk and
vegetables. It was, indeed, allowed every night, and
once or twice in the day, to be in company with another
grown-up lion and lioness, who were kept in a cage, and
fed with raw meat, which the young one, at those times,
was allowed to partake of: but this the gentleman did
not mind. His reliance was placed on the leathern bag
and the letters of the alphabet. And the young lion
grew, and the old gentleman continued to pet it and feed
it with his own hand and the leathern bag; and when
the Pasha, who knew more of lions than the gentleman,

66 What can you
warned him that it was not so easy a thing to wean them
to live upon potatoes and turnips, the gentleman still re-
plied that his lion could tell the letters of the alphabet,
and would, therefore, soon lose its taste for blood. And
at last the lion became as large as a young donkey, and
could tell every single letter correctly, and the gentle-
man was quite proud of his success; when one morning,
it was found in its master's room, amusing itself with
the remnants of its master's skull !"

"I mean," said Bevan to Villiers, as they went dowr.
stairs after taking their leave, and promising to call for
more information again"I mean that we in this coun

shape of the children of those classes which we have

to crush the instinct which it derives from its parents,
f'bos co apos toxwor?you remember the passage in
schylusthan our leathern bag and our letters of the
alphabet-Woe to us when the child grows up!"
Villiers was silent ; for it was a thought not new to
him, but full of fear and sorrow.
" And yet you must not," he said, "indulge your hu-
mor too much with Miss Brook ; you will give her
offence and pain her. And she is far too amiable a per-
son to treat with disrespect."
Disrespect !" said Bevan, " I would not offend her
for the world! But she is under the influence of the
absurdities of the day. And ought we not to be remind-
ed that infants have been placed by Providence in the
hands of their parents, and belong to them as their
property? That except by parents, or persons fulfilling
all the duties and occupying the position of parents,
they cannot be properly educated ; because the education
of infants can only be conducted through love and venc.
ration ; and their love and veneration, if directed to any
one but their parents, is misplaced, and will only lead to

a dislocation of the first elements of society-domestic
attachment ?"
" It is true," said Villiers.
" And will our education, continued Bevan, "be
placed on a proper footing until we give up our usurped
authority over the infants of the poor, restore them to the
hands of their parents, stand by them ourselves only to
aid and assist the parents in the work of education, and
turn our attention rather to improve the parent than the
child, rather to make the vitals of society sound, and the
spring of life pure, than to save the limbs while the vitals
are mortifying, and to filter the waters of the stream
while the cattle are every hour polluting the fountain
head above?"
Villiers sighed. " I fear," he said, " we have rather
trespassed on Miss Brook to-day. And certainly the
course of conversation led us away from our object.
Will
you call with me again to-morrow ?"
"With pleasure ; and afterwards shall we go to see
that quack exhibition, the Academy, or Lyceum, or
whatever other fine name it bears? You observe how
elassical and Athenian everything is becoming, at the
very time while the same parties, who thus nickname
their modern absurdities, repudiate the notion of encou-
raging Latin or Greek, and talk of nothing but modern
science and utility."
"I am not very fond," said Villiers, " of appearing
as a spectator at exhibitions the principle of which I dis-
approve of. But wishing, as I do, to see as much as
possible of the state of things in Hawkstone, I will de-
part from my general rule. And now are you disposed
for a walk? And you shall tell me what is the condi.
tion of the place in your own mind. Which way shall
we proceed ?"
"I have one favorite walk," said Bevan-" towards
the Priory ruins, if you have no objection. And I wish
to see a poor person on the road."
None," said Villiers. And the two friends (for the
morning conversation, in exhibiting a similarity of prin-
ciple and object, had done more than renew an old ac
quaintance) commenced their walk to the ruins.

* And all this is yours?" said Bevan to Villiers, as they
stood together on the same brow where Villiers had
rested before on his former visit to the Priory.
Villiers made no reply, for he seemed immersed in
thought.
** It is a lovely prospect!" continued Bevan, not
noticing his companion's abstraction. "Look how beau.
tifully the light is falling on that gable with the ivy
drooping down from the broken tracery. See, it is
stealing round that pillar, and throwing it out from the
shadow. Oh! is not that exquisite ?" And he quite
clapped his hands (for Bevan was an enthusiastic admirer
of Nature) as a cloud passed away, and a gorgeous light
fell on the mass of foliage and old gnarled trunks of oaks,
which started out of the red sandstone rock on the bank
behind the ruins. 66 And the rush of that water!" he
exclaimed; "can anything be more soothing and deli.
cious ? But you do not enjoy it!"

longed to any one but myself. Neither of us indeed
would perhaps regard the ruins of a religious house as
the most agreeable object for enjoyment, however pictur-
esque they may be. But men's minds do not seem to
contemplate things now in such points of view. A ruin
is a ruin, whatever its original destination; and break it
up into picturesque groupings, tint it well with lichens,
hang it with ivy, and place it in a good framework of
wood and valley, and the eye once satisfied, no one seems
to care for anything else. I confess I cannot do this.
And I do not enjoy the sight of those ruins, for the very
reason that they are my own."
" And yet property," said Bevan, 6 has its charms
and its uses, if properly employed."
" It has," said Villiers; " and yet the burthen of it
is heavy. When yon reminded me that all this was mine,
I thought of a Being who said the same of this, and oall

the kingdoms of the world All this is mine, and I give
them to whomsoever I will. I have sometimes wished
that Providence had placed me where you are placed, in
the quiet independence of a college life."
"Our college life," said Bevan, " has many charms.
It relieves us from all the troubles and anxieties of an
establishment, gives us a home without many of the dis-
comforts connected with a family, and secures us a degree
of respectability independent of fortune, which is useful to
ourselves, and also, I think, to society, in these days,
when money is everything."
Villiers looked disappointed, and scanned Bevan in-
quiringly; and one who knew the workings of his coun-
tenance might have observed a slight, very slight curl of
the upper lip. " I thought," he said, " that Oxford men
sometimes gave other reasons for their attachment to
Oxford ?
" What more would you want?" asked Bevan,
sedately. "Ease, comfort, independence, respectability,
usefulness to society-where could you have learnt that
any thing more was necessary ? Surely not from this
Villiers, plain, straightforward, never speaking except
exactly as he felt and thought, and never indulging even
in the most moderated irony, still seemed perplexed.
And Bevan perceived and understood his thoughts.
" You wish me," he said, " to speak of other blessings
which we enjoy at Oxford. Do not suppose that I am
insensible to them; but they are things rather to be
known and felt, and acted on, than talked of."
" Yes," said Villiers; "your daily service, the society
of good men, your time for study, your noble associations,
the freedom from temptation, the space you occupy in the
country, as fulfilling its noblest duties, your defence of the
Church, and of all that the Church valuesthese are the
things which I was thinking of. Oxford has long seemed
to me the Thermopyl of the age. And when the bar.
barous host pours down upon us with their gold, and
tumult, and jargon, and parade, it is there that the few
must take their stan: who dare to resist the 'invader
age!"

Whether they will be overwhelmed or not, is in the
hands of Providence."
" And yet," said Bevan, " Oxford is not all that it
should be. It has improved, has been raised from the
lamentable state in which it lay not long since, but it
has many defects. The very enjoyment of its life tends
to make us indolent and selfish, and unable to bear with
the little frettings and roughnesses of life. It makes us
dreamers also, inclined to indulge in theories of what
should be, rather than to grapple manfully with evils as
they are. We have too few duties. Except those who
are immediately engaged in tuition, and the care of the
neighboring parishes (and they are comparatively few,)
we have no appointed work, except to study; and study
by itself, without active duties and occupations to form a
solid foundation for it in the mind, is perhaps an unhealthy
employment. The consequence is, that so few Fellows
of Colleges reside at Oxford ; and even those who would
wish to enforce their residence scarcely venture to do so."
" And why?" asked Villiers.
"They dread," said Bevan," bringing a large number
of persons to live constantly together, who, having nothing
to do but to read, will probably become troublesome,
restless, and even quarrelsome."
" But why not," said Villiers, "engage them all ir!
tuitionallot to them each some portion of the manage-
ment of the students?"
"We cannot," said Bevan, " without diminishing the
emoluments of our tutorships; and, these diminished, we
should not find superior men to devote themselves to
the drudgery of tuition. Besides which, I doubt if we
have discipline sufficient, and habits of obedience, to hold
together a body of Fellows, each in his allotted place.
Our societies are kept together in much harmony and
good will, because few are in residence at a time; and
among those it is effected by a gentlemanly spirit of
mutual accommodation, and by the general habits of
society, rather than by strict discipline. This is one of
the things lost in our day, and perhaps it can never be
recovered.
## p. 36 (#392) #############################################

HAWKSTONE.
" Perhaps not," replied Villiers.
" Indeed it would be hard," continued Bevan, " to
find men who would devote themselves, as the work of
their whole life, to the task of education in a college,
with only the trifling remuneration which could be offered
them under your plan. Few men now think of dying in
a college. Perhaps, as I said before, the life itself is
enervating, and disqualifies us for our task, if continued
too long.
" And therefore," said Villiers, smiling, "you no
sooner obtain a fellowship than you look out for a living,
and resolve to marry?"
" We look out, I believe," replied Bevan, " for a
position where we may have regular and active duties
to discharge, particularly as clergymen. I have heard
many Fellows, as soon as they were ordained, express
theniselves strongly, and I do believe honestly, as if they
felt that a residence in Oxford, enjoyable as it is, was
incompatible with their ordination vow."
" And yet they are needed there, surely," said
Villiers, "to provide learning for the Church, and to
defend it by their writings; even to hold up a high
standard of principle and theory, as well as of couduct,
which is so soon lost in the bustle of the world."
Yes," said Bevan, "if any one would come forward
and appoint us our tasks, and make us feel that we are
following this as our proper vocation, fixed by Providence.
But we have not been accustomed to look at our
institutions in this point of view. And after all, until
we have all our active duties and employments, as well
as our opportunities for study, I fear the attempt would
66
fail. 
" And so, as soon as you can leave Oxford, you all
marry?" repeated Villiers. And there was something in
his tone of voice as if he was sounding the depth of his
companion's mind.
" We marry," said Bevan, "for what else can we
do? You would not wish a clergyman to place himself
in a parish alone, without any one to relieve the solitude
of his fireside when he comes home from his painful, and

wearying, and thankless ministrations ? As a single
man he cominands no station in society ; he cannot
attend to many things which only a lady can properly
superintend. He must be embarrassed, to say the least,
with his domestic arrangements. But there are also
numberless parochial employments in which he cannot
well take the lead, but his wife may. In the present
state of society to be married is, at least, as indispensable
to a parochial clergman as it is to a member of any
other profession, who is never recognised as fixed re.
spectably in life, or even usefully, till he is married."
" And with the marriage," said Villiers, still probing
the real opinions of his companion," with the marriage
comes the establishment, and with the establishment the
house and the furniture, and the hundred knicknacks of
our modern refinement, and the footbay in livery, and the
pony-chaise, and the respectable table, and the spare
room for occasional visiters ; perhaps the piano and the
harp, for you are gentlemen yourselves, and those you
marry have themselves been brought up to these com-
forts; and the position which you occupy in the parish,
or the town, requires that you should live respectably,
and respectability, in modern eyes, is determined by
the
" Horse and gig, you would say," interrupted
Bevan.
" No," said Villiers, for he was fastidiously alive to
vulgarity, and could never enter into the wit of slang,
" by these comforts and refinements."
" It is too true," assented Bevan.

of modern charity, to provide for the wants of his

present system involves a large expenditure by clergy-
men on their own families, it provides also the funds from
private sources ; for so long as the parochial clergy
retain their present respectability (let us use the word as
the world uses it), so long the situation will be filled by
respectable men ; that is, by men who have private
property of their own, and increase it by the little for-
tunes of the persons whom they marry. But lower them
down to a style of living and position in society which,
however good, and simple, and primitive, in itself, would
be wholly unintelligible, and without claims to respect
in modern eyes, and our clergy would soon be filled only
from the lowest classes."
" I am not sure," said Villiers, " whether the funds
brought into the Church in the way you suggest are at
all equivalent to the increased expenditure of the clergy,
entailed on them by their present mode of life ; and per-
haps a different mode of life might provide for them other
resources which are now closed up ; and private bounties
to the Church might flow more liberally, as they did of
old, when men saw that their gifts were not expended
in private, but in public works. But you mistake me
if you suppose I would sweep away our parochial sys-
tem, as it now stands, further than that I would willingly
our clergy, within proper limits, and gradually,
setting the example of more simplicity in their habits
of living ; and from them it would penetrate into other
classes of society. But I do think that on our Church
system, as constituted at present, something else might
be grafted to supply its present defects. We do require
collegiate bodies, and without them our Church will be
scarcely able to retain her position."
"Monasteries," said Bevan, archly.
"No, not monasteries," replied Villiers. " Far
from it!"
" And why not monasteries ?" asked Bevan, looking
up into Villiers's face with an expression of curiosity and
interest," why not monasteries?"
" It would be more fit," answered Villiers, " for me

So neces
to ask you, the learned man of Hawkstone, the history of
monasteries, than for you to ask me. But I have read
that history carefully; and I trust the days of monasteries
will not be revived in England."
" And yet," said Bevan, "think what monasteries
have effected in their generation.
How they opened
a refuge for the scattered atoms of society, the men
without homes or families, and who, without homes or
families, would become only useless, if not mischievous
-how they preserved in the world the form, at least, of
a higher tone of piety and self-denial-how they exhib.
ited, to common eyes, religion and the Church in a
tangible shape, visible and powerful, and clothed with
all the outward ornaments essary to give it
weight, and even to make it intelligible to minds that can
comprehend nothing but sense."
" I have thought of all this," said Villiers.
" Again," continued Bevan, " remember how they
stood between the Church and the crown at the time
when the ecclesiastical power without this support must
have been crushed by the secular arm-how again they
stood between the crown and the barons, and aided the
former in amalgamating the civil elements of society;
and in forming oligarchies into monarchies. Think
again how they stood once more between the barons and
the people, and threw up their great corporations, strong
in property and talent, to protect the people from the
tyranny of their mastersto set an example of kind-
ness and good management-to introduce arts and
refinement, and a refinement, not like our own, divested
of religion, bnt turning all the energies of the fancy
to embody, and illustrate, and enforce, the doctrines of
"I know it all," repeated Villiers, gravely.
" And to our monasteries," continued Bevan,

architecture, painting, sculpture, agriculture, music,
even our ecc esiastical endowments and our parochial
system,-how i uch of all tha' sweetens as well as en.

" With some qualifications," said Villiers, " I admit it."
" And," continued Bevan, sarcastically, "when our
monasteries were swept away, came our poor laws.'
" Yes," said Villiers, with a strong expression of
indignation.
5 And for our monasteries," added Bevan, " we have
now-
"Yes," cried Villiers, impetuously, "we have our
factories and our poor-houses, where, night and day,
Men wake as monks of old, but not for prayer-
Men quail with famine's pangs, but not for God-
Men crush their limbs with toil, but all for gold-
Men live and die in shame, but not for sin.'
66
O England ! England !" And Villiers drew his hat over
his brow and walked on hurriedly.
Bevan followed him in silence, and they both sat
down together on the trunk of a huge oak, which had
been uprooted in a late storm, and lay along the side of
the declivity.
"And yet," said Bevan, gently, " with all this before
you, you would not restore our monasteries ?"
No," said Villiers, "I would not. From the first
they seem to me to have been formed upon false princi.
ples, and to have been the strongholds of Popery; and
of Popery, if I venture to speak at all, it can be only
with abhorrence."
Bevan was struck and surprised. He might have
expected some expression of sorrow and reprobation for
the corruptions of Popery ; but he was little used to lan.
guage of this kind from any one except persons very
different from Villiers. And the warmth with which
Villiers spoke when roused contrasted strongly with the
usual reserve and quietness of his manner. But Villiers,
sobered as he had been by trials, was still a man of quick
and almost passionate feeling ; and without feeling, who
zan move or rule the world?
"I abhor," he said, standing up with his arms folded
on his breast, and looking steadfastly on Bevan-"]
abhor a system which, professing a zeal for religion, aims

mainly at dominionwhich destroys the constitution of
the Church, and with the constitution, its safeguard for
the transmission of truth, in order to raise up a tyranny
where God has appointed equalitywhich pretends to
antiquity and authority, while it forges and falsifies the
documents on which those pretensions are restedwhich,
abandoning its simple duty of witnessing to the truth
revealed to it, thinks only of governing menwhich, to
govern men, consents to employ trickeries, and falsehoods,
and mummerieswhich would hold them in ignorance
and bondage, lest enlightenment in the laity should in-
fringe on the exclusive usurpation of the clergywhich
would sever all the ties of society, separating children
from their parents, and husbands from their wives, and
subjects from their kings, and kings from their subjects,
and rather create a chaos than want a field fitly prepared
for spreading its own dominion. I abhor," he continued,
" that which you abhor, its frightful popular idolatries-
the audacity with which it has tampered with the most
solemn positive institutions of Godthe wretched, com-
promising, expediency-rationalism with which it has
made itself all things to all men, that it may win, not
souls, but bodiesthe laxity of its morals set side by side
with the severity of its discipline--the grasping, med-
dling, covetous, ay, sanguinary spirit with which it has
stretched its arm over the whole world, introducing schism,
and heresy, and rebellion, and murder as the means of
propagating religion, that is, of establishing its own
power. And when I speak of such things," said Villiers,
" I speak strongly; and we ought to speak strongly."
" And yet," said Bevan calmly, " placed by the side,
of dissent, Popery has its fair side. Even compared
with our own Church it has much to admire and imitate."
"Not Popery," said Villiers ; "not Popery. Popery
is the spirit of rule, of ambition, of self-will
, of rational-
ism, of dissent itself; and as such, it has nothing fair.
To serve its ambition, it has made use of religion, and
preserved much that is noble and good, because it knows
chat without nobleness and goodness no rule can long be
permanent. And it is this Catholicism, not Popery,
whi h we admire.

HAWKSTONE.
" It is sad," said Bevan, " that in our own Church
we have not something of this spirit of rule, some of that
worldly prudence which would restore our discipline and
our power."
" God forbid !" exclaimed Villiers. "God forbid !"
He was thinking solemnly on a solemn subject, or the
expression would not have escaped him. "Better any
weakness in the Church, than a scheming, manquvring,
grasping spirit to get possession of men's minds, and
then of their bodies, and then of their wealth, for one
lust will follow on the other. Our Church has indeed its
faults, but they are faults of individuals, not of the system.
Popery sins rather in its system, and its virtues are ex.
ceptions, and individual."
" Are you not too harsh in your judgment ?" said
Bevan.
" And violent, you think," said Villiers. "Every
one, now, who feels strongly, or speaks strongly, is
thought violent. And perhaps," he continued, calmly,
and smiling at his own earnestness, " moderation is
always best ; but I have seen Popery, and know its work-
ings, which those who speak of it with quietness have
rarely done."
And you, then," said Bevan, "are not one of those
who would rebuild these ruins ? You ought rather to
look on them complacently. Does it not delight you,
he said, as they entered under the gateway of the outer
court," to see this old corbel tottering to its fall, and the
rents in that stone roof?"
Villiers did not answer; for he was examining the
structure with a curious eye, pacing and repacing the
gateway to measure its length, and searching in a heap
of rubbish overgrown with nettles for part of the carved
groining which had fallen down.
Observe, ," he said, as they entered the inner court,
" how well they arranged their buildings. The chapel,
or rather church, occupying the most prominent place,
vast, elevated, and ornamented, as the centre and object
of the whole cluster of buildings. Then the refectory,
which stood where that large oriel window is hanging

-just there you see the low stone pillars of a crypt under
it, which, in fact, formed the kitchen and the cellars ;
and all the buildings round-dormitories, offices, and all,
were left low, and almost insignificant. That which
belonged to God was first and foremost, that which be.
longed to man in society was next, that which belonged
to the individual was last and lowest. And now our
houses are palaces, and our churches are barns.'
"Our club houses, at least," said Bevan, laughingly,
are an exception. They represent man in society,
and are splendid enough to represent him as he should
be in that capacity."
" Yes," said Villiers, "but it is a society of selfish-
ness ; merely an aggregation of individuals, with no bond
to hold them together but their own self-indulgence."
They stood now within the roofless chapel ; and Vil.
liers uncovered his head, and Bevan likewise. " Hark!"
said Bevan, "what noise was that ?"
"I heard nothing but the brook rushing," said Villiers.
" Yes, there, again!" said Beran. " Surely there
was a noise up there ;" and he pointed to an old narrow
archway, high up in the wall, against the east end of the
chapel, and close above the iron grated door which led
into the Villiers's vault. Villiers's thoughts were full of
other things.
" It is too early in the day for ghosts," said Bevan,
but Villiers, he perceived, had no relish for any thing
approaching to a jest. And as he stood gazing on the
iron grating, and then, as if recovering himself
, proceeded
once more to pace the chapel in its length and breadth,
as if to take its measurements, Bevan passed out into
the cloisters, and was examining the remains of the wall
which had enclosed the Prior's garden. Villiers had
just completed his survey, and was proceeding to clear
away some nettles which had sprung up, and nearly hid
an old Knight Templar's cross-legged figure, when
Bevan appeared again at the arch of the cloister, and
beckoned him to come that way ; his hand was held up
to motion to him not to make a noise, and Villiers
walked towards him,  Look !" said Bevan, with a low

voice, as he turned the angle of the buttress, " look up in
that corner, by that mass of ivy, under the window ; who
can that be?"
" It is a woman," said Villiers.
" And what can she be doing ?" said Bevan.
*
The church clock in Hawkstone had struck one on
the night after Bentley had paid his calamitous visit to
the Priory ruins. From a starry moonlight sky it had
become overcast with clouds, and a heavy steady rain
was pouring down, while gusts of wind shook the far-
scattered gas lamps, and seemed ready to extinguish
them. The streets were entirely deserted ; and, except
the pattering of the rain, no sound had disturbed the
sleepers in the High Street, except, about an hour before,
a horse's sharp trot, coming in from the road to the
forest. On the horse was mounted a respectably-dressed
person, muffled up in a rough cloak, who, after taking his
horse to a stable belonging to the Masons' Arms, and
from thence passing by a private way into the little
green door of the garden belonging to the Romish priest
at Hawkstone, finally retired for the night to his lodgings
at the post-office. A solitary policeman (for, with manu-
factures and minings, there had arrived at Hawkstone,
also, the necessity of a police) stood at the corner of the
street, with his iron-bound hat and glazed cape gleaming
in the gas light. He also, like Bevan in the ruins, was
struck by hearing a noise ; but it was a noise very
different from that of a clashing of iron ; it was one low
deep moan, as of a person exhausted and yet in agony ;
and then all was still again. The man stopped and
listened, fancying it the wind ; and then, to satisfy
himself, he continued his patrol round the corner of King
Street, till he came within three or four doors from the
post-office. But here he stopped ; for, crouched up on
the step of a door, and exposed to all the pelting of the
rain, was a female figure. His first impression was to
order her to go home. What business had she there
at that time of night? But the poor creature made no
reply, and only continued to rock herself backwards

and forwards, clasping at the same time to her breast
what appeared to be an infant wrapped up in her mother's
shawl.
"Go home, go home," said the policeman ;
6 what
are you doing here?"
And the poor thing opened her eyes, and catching
sight of him, sprang up and fell down at his knees.
" Don't strike mo again-do n't strike me again--do
not murder me, George," she cried ; and then she
lowered her voice to a whisper,--" I wo n't tellindeed
I won't!"
66 What's the matter ?" said the rough policeman;
" what's the meaning of this, woman ?-who's going to
murder you?"
" I won't tell, indeed," she continued, "it's all safe-
only do n't strike me!" and she clasped his knees,
convulsively. " Any thing but that."
" Any thing but what? Get up, my good woman,'
said the policeman, " get up!" And he raised her up,
made her relinquish her hold, and placed her on the step
of the door. As the light from the lamp fell on the face
of the policeman, she passed her thin wan hands over
her eyes, and throwing back her hair from her young
and beautiful face, she gazed wildly, as if to ascertain
where she was. But all seemed to be a dream.
"Do n't be frightened," said the kind-hearted, but
" I'm not going to do you any harm. I
wo n't murder you."
She looked on him wistfully, and then, after a pause,
she said, " Why not? I never did any thing for you.-I
never gave up all for you. Hah!" she cried, as she
seemed to catch sight of and recognize his policeman's
dress. And closing her lips firmly, as if resolved not to
speak, she once more clasped her bundle to her breast,
and seemed rocking her baby to sleep.
" What in the world is the matter with her ?" said a
second policeman, who had now come up:
"I suspect she's out of her senses," said the other.
" Look at her clothes, all torn into shreds. She has evi.
dently been through the woods; and her feet-there-

one of her shoes is gone, and the other is all covered
with blood."
6. There's blood here, too," said the other; and he
pointed out some large spots on the poor creature's tat-
tered gown, together with some bits of mud, which had
apparently been thrown at her.
" How came this?" said the second man, pointing to
the mud, and trying to rouse her from her stupor by
jogging her arm.
They flung dirt at me," she said, " the boys flung
at me.
They called me bad names. But I am not bad

tempted me." And she groaned deeply.
6 What's the matter with you?" said the first man;
" where are you hurt ?"
She remained silent, and bit her lips.
66 Where's your pain ?" said the second, in a kinder
voice, and trying to encourage her. She pressed her
hand to her temple, where there were the marks of a
contusion.
Here," she said, " here,-he struck me here.
There's a great weight here, like lead. Please, sir,
to take it off.
ill."
" Are you cold ?" said the policeman.
And she shook her head mournfully.
" Are you hungry?"
And again she shook her head.
6 Ar n't

feet sore ?"
And she looked down to her feet, which were cover-
ed with blood, but once more shook her head.
" What can we do with her ? " said the first policeman
to the second. "I suppose we must take her to the
station.'
But before they could consult further, she sprang up,
with a shriek which rang through the deserted street, and
chilled their very blood. " Fire! fire ! it's on fire !
He's set it on fire !
Oh, my brain ! " And with both
her hands clasped on the back of her head, she gave
another piercing and horrible cry.
66 What in the world is that? What 's the matter?

Oh, dear me, policeman, what can be the matter ?
cried a voice out of a window, which had just opened a
few doors below. It was Mrs. Jones, at the post-office.
Only a poor woman," said the policeman, "not
quite right in her mind."
Oh, drive her away-pray, pray drive her away ;
do not let her stay here for the world. What business
has she here ?"
"Do not be afraid," said the policeman; and as Mrs.
Jones put up her window, he muttered a curse upon her
for a hard-hearted fool. But another window opened,
and another voice, that of a man, from the same house,
demanded authoritatively, what was the meaning of such
a noise in the streets at that time of night. It was Mr.
Peters, or Pearce, or by what other alias he chose to
pass. The same answer was given. And with some-
thing of an oath at the woman for disturbing his slum-
bers; Mr. Pearce told them to take her to the station !
and closing his own window, retired again to rest. Alas!
how little do people within the houses of a town think at
night of those who are without !
" Would n't you like to go home, my good woman?"
said the policeman.
" No, no !" she murmured weakly, for, as if exhaust-
ed with pain, she had sunk once more upon the step:
" Not home, not home! He'll strike me again ; and it
would kill me.
Oh, to be struck by him!
" Who's him? Who struck you?" asked the second
policeman, pertinaciously endeavoring to extract the
facts, but ignorant of the mode of doing it, and becoming
impatient. But once more she seemed to catch sight of
his policeman's dress, and her lips were sealed.
did not do it," she said, doggedly. "It's false. He
never meant it. 'T was all play. I know he did not
mean it.
Am not I his wife ? Am not I his Margaret,
that he used to love sothat gave up all for him? Yes
-all, all!" And she groaned again bitterly. "He
could n't do it. Go away, go away!" and she pushed
the policeman from her. "Let me get up," she contin-
ued, as the man endeavored to take hold of her, and lead

her away.
" Let me get up. I'm wanted." And shiro
folded her dress about her, as if preparing to depar
quietly. "My baby wants me. I have not given it its
supper. I must go home."
Why, what's this?" asked the policeman, trying
to uncover the shawl which she had enveloped in her
arms, " I thought this was your baby?"
The poor woman looked at him, as he withdrew fold
after fold, but it was with a vacant stare. The shawl
contained nothing but some straw, which she had appa-
rently taken from a barn, and made up to hold in her
arms like an infant.
6 What's this?" asked the policeman, as he uncov.
ered it. And Margaret, letting her eyes wander idly
from the bundle to the man, suffered it to fall from her
arms with an expression of utter desolation.
"I 'm not well," she said. 66 I don't think I 'm
quite right here," and she laid her forehead on her hands.
" Things seem to go round with me. You won't hurt
me, will you? I 'm a poor woman."
" JIurt you !" said the policeman ; no, to be sure
not. You had better come with us, and we 'll put you
into shelter. Here, take hold of my arm.'
But once again she sprang up.
" Hush!" she said,
"it's crying for me; and I waiting here. It's cold. It
wants me. Yes," she repeated, with a low voice, and
shuddering all over, "it 's cold-very cold where they
laid it, and dark and lonesome. And the rain beats upon
it. And I not there to keep it warm. Let me go, let
me go," she screamed.
" There 's its cry again-my
baby's cry!" And bursting, with all the strength of a
maniac, from the hand of the policeman, she rushed along
the street, turned down some alleys, which she appeared
to thread familiarly, and was lost in the darkness of the
night. What passed in the remainder of the night no
one knew. A ottager, indeed, about two miles off, had
been awakened, about four o'clock, by three frightful
shrieks under his window; but he was too terrified and
superstitious to rise and inquire what it meant. The
under-keeper at the Priory also, in going his rounds early

in the morning, had found a bennet torn and dirtied, and
under the bushes, in the same place, marks as if a person
had lain there recently. And it was early in the after
moon when Villiers and Bevan reached the ruins.
" It is a poor woman," said Villiers, as he stood at
the angle of the great north transept, leoking at her.
" But observe," said Bevan, " she has no bonnet ;
her hair is all torn, her gown in tatters, and her feet
without shoes, and swollen, and lacerated!"
She was, in fact, kneeling down on the wet grass, on
a spot where the turf seemed recently to have been raised
and replaced. And with part of the blade of a rusty knife,
which she had picked up, she was digging out the earth
with all her strength. Villiers and Bevan approached
quietly without being perceived.
"I 'm coming," she said, "I 'm coming, my own
darling-wait a moment, I 'm coming. Do n't cry, for
it kills me ! He did not mean to hurt you. I know lio
did not. His own baby!"
And she continued to scrabble up the inould with both
her hands. "I 'm coming, darling, darling! he shan't
Ah! ah!" And throwing down the knife,
and stopping both her ears with her hands" It is that
scream!" she shrieked"its last scream!" And she
sank shuddering to the ground, and lay as dead, with
only a slight convulsive twitching of one hand, showing
that she was still alive.
" Poor thing !." said Bevan, "what can we do with
her?"
"We must take her to a cottage," said Villiers,
* and then make inquiry for her friends. She can scarcely
be a native of this place."
But Margaret heard their voices, and, turning up her
delicate face, beautiful, even disfigured as it was, she
was recognized by Bevan, who had, like Bentley and
Villiers himself, seen her when they went to see Connell
and the boy after the fire.
"What can be the meaning of this ?" said Bevan,
" It 's poor Margaret Wheeler?"
"Margaret! Margaret!" she repeated, faintly. "Yes,

he used to call me his own Margaret; but thai was when
he loved me. Who are you? what do you want ?" and
she turned fiercely towards Bevan and Villiers.
66 What
right have you here, spying out secrets? There are no
secrets. He will kill you too. Go away, go away, T
tell you. He has nothing to do with it. I did it. It
was 1-not he!"
" Did what?" asked Villiers, gently. But Margaret
was again resting on her knees, with her face buried in
her hands, and apparently hearing nothing.
" There is evidently something mysterious in this,"
said Bevan. I wonder if we could find any trace of
information. There is something here." And gently
lifting her pocket without disturbing her, he took out of it
a gold watch, " What can be the meaning of this ?"
said Bevan."Why this is Bentley's watch ; here is his
crest ; I know it by the old fashioned chasing; it belonged
to his aunt. He showed it me the other day as a
curiosity."
"Singular!" said Villiers. 66 Take care of it. But
let us first attend to this poor creature." And with a
quiet soothing voice, he endeavored to persuade her to
get up and come with them.
**Oh! gentlemen," she said, " you are very kind,
very good, if you would but help me. You see it's cold
and wet; and I am its mother. There's no one else to
take care of it. And they have smothered it; and I can.
not get this off." And once more she began to scrabble
up the mould. "Make haste! make haste! or it will
die. It 's crying for me!" she said; and she laid down
her ear to the ground. "I 'm coming, I 'm coming,
darling! Make haste!" And, with all her strength,
and straining every nerve, she tried to remove the turf.
" Help me, help me!" she cried; "help me, help me!
I'm coming, darling-coming, coming!" And her voice
became fainter and fainter, and her movements more
convulsive; and repeating the same words again and
again, till they died on her lips, she sank down lifeless.
As the persons whom Bevan went to fetch were
removing her to the keeper's cottage, which was the

nearest place of shelter, Villiers looked back at the ruins
from a little distance, and observed a man, who had
emerged from the chapel, go hurriedly to the spot where
Margaret had been found, and after hastily endeavoring
to efface the marks wbich she had made, he looked round
as if afraid to have been seen, and leaping across the
brook, he struck off into the copse, and disappeared
among the bushes.
" There is something in this which requires to be
examined into," said Bevan.
6 Yes; and we will do it to-morrow, but quietly,"
was Villiers's reply. " Never make a bustle ; say nothing,
and we shall unravel the mystery."
"I will go back," said Bevan, "and look at the spot,
and then go into Hawkstone and see Mr. Bentley, while
you wait till Mr. Morgan comes out.
He stopped at the keeper's cottage as he returned,
and called Villiers out. He had found, on closer exami-
nation, that the ground had been trampled on as in a
struggle. In one place was the mark of a man's knee -
on the wet clay, and the grass had been stained with
something. Bevan almost feared to say what he thought
But the most alarming thing was a fragment of
a white cravat, with the mark of a bloody thumb on it,
and the initials T. B. in the corner. Bevan was horror
struck as a thought flashed across his mind.
"I must go immediately," he said, " into Hawkstone."
$ Instantly!" said Villiers. And as Bevan, hurried
and agitated, reached Bentley's door and found Mrs.
Alsop almost in tears with her anxiety about her master,
a little urchin brought a note to the door from Bentley.
6. Thank God, thank God!" exclaimed Bevan.
It was Bentley's note, written under Cookesley's
direction.
" And where did you bring this from, boy?"
" From Cuxteth Heath."
" And who gave it youMr. Bentley ?"
" No, sir."
6 Who was it!"
The boy hesitated to tell; and Bevan was obliged to
threaten him.

" It was a man in a drab jacket."
66 A workman?"
6 Yes."
6. Does Mr. Bentley ever go there, Mrs. Alsop?"
66 Not that I know of, sir.
" Has he any friends in that direction ?"
" I never heard, sir."
Why did you hesitate, boy, to tell us about it?"
" The man gave me a sixpence, and told me not to
say anything."
" This is Mr. Bentley's watch, is it not, Mrs. Alsop?
" Yes, sir," said Mrs. Alsop, " to be sure it is. Where
did you find it?"
But Bevan, anxious and perplexed, thought it best not
to inform her.
" This is certainly Mr. Bentley's handwriting," he
observed. " Here are the crossings of his t's, and his y
at the end of his signature. But it seems cramped and
awkward : how the letters straggle ; and the lines are
- not straight. Here, boy, come with me." And he
returned to Villiers, at the keeper's lodge, taking the
poor tembling urchin with him for further examination.
And the result of the examination was, that both gentle-
men sent for their horses, and, late as it was, and near
sunset, accompanied by the keeper and one of his men,
they set forward to Cuxteth Heath.
" It 's a bad place, sir, that heath!" said the keeper,
a thick-set, sturdy English yeoman.  It 's the place
where Jack Roberts was robbed last week. The men
in the forest are a terrible set. But I've brought my rifle,
sir; and I see you 've got a good stick, sir ; and here's
another for you, Mr. Bevan." And the party set out.

CHAPTER IV.
The sun had set for some time behind the huge grey
granite range of mountains which bound the wild district
known by the name of Hawkstone Forest. The shad-
ows of the evening were deepening; and the glare of the
furnaces and iron-works blazed out more luridly upon the
blackened disfigured host of workmen who were standing
about in the steep narrow street of Howlas, the village,
or almost town, of low wretched houses which had sprung
up recently since the opening of the works by Sir Mat-
thew Blake. The men themselves, instead of going
home after their work, or laughing and talking openly in
the street, were gathered together in little knots. One
or two of them had dirty newspapers in their hands, from
which they were reading out portions to groups of others.
Even the women, slatternly and hollow-eyed, seemed to
take a deeper interest than ordinary in what was passing ;
and, with their babies in their arms, forced their way
into the little knots of political disputants, and added their
angry voices to the arguments which exasperated their
husbands against the existing state of things.
" Bread risen twopence a gallon !" sighed Jenny
Ball, a poor wan-looking creature with two young child.
ren hanging about her. " And I've nothing to give them.
And John gone away to find work !"
" Work !" responded Mrs. Jubb, a red-armed and red-
faced virago.
" Where's he to get work? Arn't three
more furnaces to be blown out to-morrow? And what's
to become of us then ???
Let's
go
to-Str:Matthew at once," pfoposed the more
decent and pacific, Mrs. Smith,' who seemed to have
more confidence in the tender mercies of a money-making
age than a longer experience usoald have justified.
"Go to Sir Matthew !!) cried MrsTub5."** What
good would Sir Matthew do you, or ten thousand the like
of him?"
" Is n't it by is," asked Mary Adams, " that he

off, as rich as a Jew."
John," said the first speaker, "did go to the house.
He told me it was such a fine placeall beautiful gar-
dens, and trees, and fine servants ; and just as he came
up to the door, Madam Blake and her children were all
going out in a fine gilt carriage. But the servants swore
at him, and would not let him come up. And then he
met Sir Matthew riding by himself in the park, and
spoke to him, and told him who he was (poor fellow! he
had n't touched a bit of bread that day), and Sir Matthew
fell into a passion, and told him to get about his business.
He left all that,' he said, ' to the agent.
" And the agent deserves to be shot !" cried the
virago.
"And he 'll have his deserts soon!" muttered a
black-looking ruffian, with a quantity of hair about his
face.
" Ah !" murmured Jenny to herself, " it was the
agent drove us here. We never thought of leaving our
cottage while my lord lived on his estate ; and we had
our garden, and kept a pig and a cow; and every thing
went well with us, till my lord went away. And then
Farmer Speed wanted to pull down the cottage, and de-
clared the garden took John from his work. And the
agent did not mind so long as he got the rent; and so we
were turned out on the world."
" And came up to the hills to get work!" cried the
virago, with a bitter laugh. 66 Work for three months, and
then starving!".
" If we had but saved a little," said Mrs. Smith, more
quietly, "it would be something.".
" And love is a poor man to save ?" asked Mrs.
Jubb. Dort-joey grind dowr, his wages to the lowest

"I semen her," said Jenny, " when we had our cot-
tage, my lady and the young ladies used to come and see
us very often. And every Monday morning either Miss
Mary or the clergyman came ; and we gave them six-
pence to put by for us ; and when we were ill, or wanted

some money to buy a cow or the like, there was always
something to look to."
" I should like to see Madam Blake, or her fine
daughters, doing any thing of the kind," cried the virago.
* Why, they 'd be afraid of coming near us, for fear of
blacking their fine gowns."
" They live so far off," interposed Mrs. Smith, in a
mediatorial tone.
" Ay," rejoined Mrs. Jubb, " they do n't like to come
here, up in the hills, where they get all their money from.
It does not do among fine ladies and gentlemen to be a
coal-merchant or an iron-man."
" Madam Blake did come up here once," said poor
Jenny ; " I recollect, just about the time of the election ;
and she rode up in a fine carriage, with some fine ladies
with her. But she did n't speak to any of us, and held
her handkerchief to her nose all the time, as if she was
afraid of catching the plague."
* Ay," continued the virago," I remember, too. And
when my girl Susan, with the young ones, got close to
Miss Julia, madam's daughter, and was looking at her
fine dress, what did Miss Julia do but told her to get away,
a nasty dirty thing, or she 'd spoil her gown."
6 Well! they'll all get their dues very shortly,"
muttered the same ruffian as before.
6 That 's one
comfort."
But further remarks from him were checked by a
burst of uproar from a large body collected round an
orator at the corner of the street. " Down with them !
down with them! down with the rascally tories!"
" That's right!" thundered the speaker, as soon as
the clamor had subsided. "Down with the tories! They
are the men that suck your blood, and grind your life out.
What care they for the people's groans, or the cries of
your starving children, so long as they can fatten in lux-
ury, and keep you all chained like slaves ? "
" Down with them ! down with them !" was again
clamored forth from a hundred voices. 6 Down with the
bloody tyrants ! "
"Sir Matthew ain't a try" cried a voice from the

mob. " No," continued the speaker, " he's worse ; he's
one of your brutal, cheating, palavering Whigs, that are
always promising the people to do something for them,
when they are out of place themselves ; and when they
get in they are worse than the tories, ten times over.
No, my friends! the Charter ! the Charter! Nothing
will do you any good but that. Hurrah for the Charter !**
And caps, and hats, and voices, and hands, all simul-
taneously went up into the air.
" What do they mean by the Charter ?" asked Jenny
of Mrs. Jubb.
"I'm sure I do n't know," was the reply ; " but it's
something, my man tells me, is to raise the wages, and
give us bread for two-pence a gallon, and beer for
nothing."
6 And tea and sugar ? asked Mrs. Smith, who was
remarkably fond of that beverage.
"Oh !" said Mrs. Jubb," tea and sugar is to be sup-
plied by the parish."
" And there are to be no poor-laws.? " asked Mrs.
Smith.
"No poor-laws! no peorJaws !" caught up the mob.
" Down with the poor-laws !"
" And no parsons !
said another voice.
" And no gentlemen!" cried a third. " Down with
the parsons ! down with the gentlemen ! down with the
parsons ! was the universal cry.
" And your bishops !" exclaimed another man, with
a huge head of red hair, and in the dress of a butcher,
with something sinister about his eyes, and a singular
derneanor, as if, with great powers of disguising himself,
he was still not perfectly at home in his dress.
Yes, your bishops!" continued the orator. "I }
just read you here a paper, telling you how much they
grind out from the sweat of the poor. Here 's the Arch.

of York, 90,0001. ; the Bishop of Winchester, 80,0001.;
the Bishop of Durham, 50,0001.- and all for doing
nothing!"
" No bishops, no bishops! No parsons s! Down with

the parsons ! re-echoed the mob ; and it may well be
s'ipposed the substantives were not allowed to stand
alone, but were supported by various very expressive and
not laudatory epithets, which, as we are not writing for
a class of readers who might wish to be initiated in
them, we do not feel it necessary to repeat.
" And yet," whispered poor Jenny Blake to the
woman standing next her, "I've known a good parson.
When we had our cottage and our garden" (and the
thought of it seemed to bring water into her wasted
eyes), our parson Harris (and he was a real gentle.
man, and the son of a Lord) used to come and see us
regularly ; and he'd sit down in our cottage, for I always
kept it clean ; and we had some nice crockery, and two
geraniums, and flowers in the garden, and all com-
fortable. And he'd talk to us quite friendly like. And
when John got the fever, and nobody else would come
near us, Parson Harris came just as much as ever ;
and used to send us wine, and read prayers to him
every day."
Prayers !" cried the virago,; "what's the use of
prayers and such stuff? All cant and humbuga vile
methodistical canting crew!" And poor Jenny was
silenced. But she thought of Parson Harris, and of the
Bible he had given her, and of the advice by which she
had profited, and of the quiet Sunday's walking with
John to the village church through the green cheerful
meadows, and of the change which took place in him
after his illness, in which the parson had contrived to
make him think seriously of many things which he had
before neglected. And she remembered how thankful
she had been, and happy, though she could not exactly
say why, when, in obedience to the parson's injunctions,
they had both come together to partake of the Holy Com.
munion; and had felt more love and confidence in each
other than ever before, because they had now some
foundation for it in the promise of God to bless them.
But at Howlas there were no parsons and no Church.
And though the Methodists had run up a small red-brick
conventicle, with pointed vindows and shutters, in which

Mr. Ebenezer Starling, the shoemaker of Hawkstone,
used to preach every Sunday evening, religion was a
word with which the inhabitants of the Howlas coal and
iron works felt that they had nothing to do. Sir Matthew
Blake was the only power on which they felt dependence.
And as religion had no obvious tendency to lay open new
veins of coal, or to raise the market for iron, or to
cheapen the wages of workmen, Sir Matthew felt that it
was a subject with which he had no right to interfere.
His object was income, and with income he was perfectly
content. We must not, however, do him injustice. He
had lately subscribed twenty pounds to build a chapel-of-
ease at Howlas, on the earnest remonstrances of the
bishop, and representations made by his agent of the
alarming state of the workmen, and of the need of some
moral control over them. And it should also be said in
bis favor, that he had done this even at a time when the
income from his iron-works had dwindled from 15,0001.
to 12,0001. a-year ; and the late cold spring had so
raised the price of early forced strawberries, that Lady
Blake, at her last London party, had been obliged to give
two guineas a pottle for them. Sir Matthew had ob-
served this item in his monthly accounts just before he
signed his cheque for the church which otherwise he had
intended to have made thirty pounds. But, as he properly
said, justice to himself and to his family was the first
thing to be considered. And with such enormous drains
upon his income, and the necessity of keeping up his sta.
tion in society (Sir Matthew had himself in his youth
wielded a pickaxe in the mines which were then his
own), it was, he said, imperative on him,-he felt him.
self, in fact, conscientiously bound to be prudent and
economical.
By degrees, the hearers and talkers in the dirty
blackened streets of Howlas dropped off to their re-
spective habitations, --some to a cold comfortless he th,
round which a knot of ragged children quarrelled over
their scanty meal of potatoes and salt; others to endure

dence or vice, or on the avarice of their employer, but on
their rulers and the laws; all busily engaged in dreaming
of a coming hour, when their own physical powers would
work their relief, and the grand revolution would arrive,
in which all men would have their rightsor, to interpret
the phrase according to its real meaning in their ears,
when every one would have every thing. As the last
knot of talkers broke up, with the breaking down of an
old tub, from which a fluent frothy Chartist orator had
been addressing them, two of the party disengaged them.
selves from the rest, and passed down a dark back lane,
till they reached the open road. Blacker was one ; and
the other, a stout, close-shaven, iron-faced person, whom,
notwithstanding the substitution of a brown for a red
head of hair, and rough corduroy trowsers, and smock
frock, for the butcher's blue apron, might have been re.
cognised by the cunning of his eyes as Mr. Pearce.
" And now," said he to his companion,
6 tell me th:
whole story."
And Blacker, with that mixture of freedom and de.
ference which conceited men exhibit to those whom they
regard as connected with persons superior in rank, and
yet wish to ape and imitate in the hope of obtaining the
same advantage for themselves, proceeded to recount
some of the facts which have been lately placed before
the reader,the sum of them being, according to his
version of the story, that Wheeler had found his wife and
the parson Bentley at the Priory ruins at ten o'clock at
night, when he was removing the arms
that a scuffle
took place,-Wheeler had stabbed Bentley in the side,-
then alarmed at the consequences of a discovery, which
might not only have risked his own life, but have in-
volved the detection of the whole plot in which he was
engaged, he had proposed, with the two men who came
down from the fores with the cart to take away the arms,

that the wounded man should be thrown into the Priory
well ; but just as they were dragging the body to it,
Connell returned, and having, for some reason or other,
some influence with Wheeler, he had begged Bentley off,
on condition that he should be brought to take an oath
of secrecy, and be put under strict guard for some days,
till he could be taken back to his home, if his wound
proved slight ; and thus the whole story might be kept
quiet. The fear that any inquiry after Bentley might
lead to the discovery of the plans, which were expected
to be ripe for action in a few days, was the principal
consideration which induced the reckless brutal Wheeler
to consent to the reprieve of his victim.
Pearce listened to this tale with his brow knit in
thought, and his little twinkling eyes almost retiring
farther into his head, as if that they might pierce deeper
into all its consequences and applications. He did not
interrupt Blacker with a single remark-suffered him to
proceed in his own half-farniliar and half-consequential
tone-permitted him even to lay his hand on his shoulder,
to assume something of an admonitory style, and to
recommend him to say nothing to Wheeler; until
Blacker, presuming on his silence, proceeded to address
him "Now, my good fellow, I would advise you to go
back to Hawkstone, and we will " But at this
point Pearce quietly removed the hand from its familiar
posture, and begged his presuming companion to at.
tend to his own business. " I have not chosen and
recommended you to my friends, Mr. Blacker, for the
purpose of giving us advice, but of executing our orders.
We are perfectly aware of the course which is to be pur-
sued. And you will do well to remember this.... Have
the goodness to tell me, sir, where they have taken the
clergyman to ?"
Even Blacker himself, accustomed to see Pearce in
different situations as well as in different attires, was
thrown back, and taken by surprise at the decided au-
horitative tone in which he now spoke. But Pearce
knew his mana vain, weak, ambitious person, edu-
cated (for, in the present day, who is not educated ?).

who could write, and read, and cypher (for he had been
educated at a National School), and made use of his
accomplishments to write speeches for meetings of
mechanics and Chartists, and to read not only as many
Sunday newspapers as he could obtain, but even a higher
class of publications, on politics, religion, and all the
other interests of life, which a certain class of writers are
now endeavoring to lower to the comprehension, and
submit to the judgment of the people,-meaning by the
people the majority of the nation, as told by the head.
Blacker's ambition was that of a little, bustling mind,
fond of obtaining importance by being admitted to se-
crets, trusted with a little power, and permitted to asso-
ciate with persons above him. He was just the character
which the system of Romanism ould have seized on,
and turned into a pliant instrument in the hands of religion.
And though there were points in his character which
made him dangerous, because those who are fond of
hearing are inclined also to be fond of talking, he pos-
sessed a certain degree of influence with the lower
classes of workmen and his general companions, and
was free from many of those faults, such as drunkenness,
which rendered it impossible for Pearce to trust others.
Having the key to his mind, Pearce knew how to rule it ;
and by alternate confidence and mystery, by maintaining
his own superiority, and at the same time flattering his
tool with occasional panegyrics, and prospects of advance-
ment to a still higher share in the great work before
themand especially by allowing him to have glimpses
of the important part which Pearce himself was playing,
and of his confidential communication with other great
personages-he found it easier, as well as safer, to em-
ploy Blacker for his purposes than Wheeler, whose
thorough selfishness and profligacy placed him beyond
all control. Wheeler, also, he had incautiously admitted
to some part of his confidence before his character be.
came thoroughly bad ; he had even trusted him with
some important papers, which Wheeler was to transmit
to another party. But, with as much cunning as Pearce
hirnself, he had pretended to lose them, and still retained

them in his own possession, with the secret resolution of not
giving them up, in proportion as he found that Pearce
began to distrust him, and was employing Blacker to
perform many important services which had before been
committed to himself. Among these was the distribution
of sundry sums of money, of which Pearce appeared to
have considerable command, though he managed it with
economy and prudence in the prosecution of his plans.
In fact, Wheeler had formed views and objects of his
own, which Pearce would willingly have made subser-
vient to his own, could he have made Wheeler a pliant
and submissive instrument. And when this became
impracticable, the next thing was to remove him.
But, for the present, we must leave the confederates,
and return to Villiers.

rode on.
VILLIERS himself was an active and indefatigable walker;
but Bevan's slight frame, and evident inability to endure
much exertion, suggested to the keeper the necessity of
waiting for their horses at a farm-house occupied by one
of Villiers's principal tenants. The boy, a shrewd cunning
little imp, was then placed before the keeper, and they
The road ran in the same direction with that
along which Bentley had been carried. It rose up from
the rich valley in which the ruins of the Priory lay, and
mounted along the side of a deep ravine, at the bottom of
which a torrent, sparkling at intervals through a hanging
mass of oak and hazel thicket, was dashing over a bed of
limestone rock, and hollowing its passage through a
labyrinth of little caverns and crags. As it ascended,
the view opened over a wider expanse of high table-land,
thinly cultivated, but dotted over with miserable cabins.
At intervals the brown moor was broken by heaps of
coal and slag, and the blackened she is and tall chimney's

63
belonging to the steam-engines, which drew the water
from the pits; and, above all, rose the gaunt jagged out-
line of the mountain ridge, which was known as Hawk-
stone Forest. Villiers, who had known the district as
a boy, when permitted to accompany the keeper in a
shooting expedition, before its solitude had been disturbed
by the discovery of its mineral treasures, was pained at
the change which had taken place.
" And yet," he said to Bevan, " these are the elements
of wealth; Nature intended them to be employed in the
service of man. They foster industry, stimulate arts,
contribute to the comforts of life. Alas! that all this
should be purchased at the expense of so many higher
and holier intereststhat the treasures of a nation should
be supplied by converting its populace into demons!"
And as Villiers uttered these words, he pointed out to
his companion a gang of blackened, debauched, ferocious
ruffians, who were just returning from the pit's mouth
with some carts. The keeper, a shrewd, sensible, En-
glish yeoman, happened to overhear him. He fancied,
also, that he perceived some sign of recognition between
the boy and the people in the road; and, riding up to the
side of his master, and touching his hat, he ventured to
suggest that they should ride on, as the evening was
closing round them.
" It is a dangerous thing, sir," he said, " to make
more show, or say more than is necessary in these
places. This is no regular road; and they may be after
inquiring where we are going. I know these people
here well; and if your honor will trust me, I think I
can manage to find what we want : but we had better
press on. Villiers readily complied with his suggestion.
But just at that moment, and as they were preparing to
cross the head of the ravine, which was there covered
thicker than before with an underwood of hazel along its
precipitous sides, the drivers of the carts seemed to have
received some signal, or else clumsily to become careless
of their driving, and drew across the road so as to startie
the horses, and throw the whole party into confusion.
As the keeper remons 'ated, and was occupied in getting

clear of the obstruction, the boy managed to slide off from
the horse, plunged into the thicket, and before any of
them could recover their surprise, he had let himself
down hy branch and rock to the bottom of the hollow,
and was making his escape through it without the possi.
bility of pursuing him. The keeper and Villiers both
leaped from their horses to follow him, but it was too
late; and, as they turned to vent their indignation against
the carts, which had caused the obstruction and escape,
they observed a sort of significant laugh and chuckle
between two of the most ruianlike pitmen, who seemed
to be captains of the gang.
But the carts moved out of
the way; the men touche their hats as they passed, not
without a look of triumph as at the success of some little
maneuvre; and the keeper, a cool thoughtful English-
man, having calculated the advantages of expressing his
indignation, and perhaps his suspicion, thought it better
to take no notice, and move on.
" There is some mischief here," said Villers to him,
as they rode on. " You understand this district better
than I do. What is the best course to pursue ? Had
we not better go at once to a magistrate ?"
" Magistrate ! sir," exclaimed the keeper;" there's no
magistrate can do us any good in such a place as this.
Why, the whole ground, sir, under our feet is tunnelled
and hollowed out ; and half the people are under the
earth, while the other half are above it. And a pretty
set it is,the very scum of all the worst places in Eng.
land, which has taken refuge here ; and not a soul to
take care of them, or keep them right. Heathens, sir,-
worse than heathens! and miserable, too. It's a hard
life they leadwomen and children, all of them in dark-
ness, and filth, and cold. I have heard some of the
poor children tell of what they have gone through ; and
it makes one's blood run cold." Villiers at any other
time would have encouraged the sturdy yeoman in his
communications, for he knew that much was to be learn.
ed from them. But his increasing anxiety in regard to
Bentley, and his conviction that some mischief had hap-
pened t him, would not allow him to think of anything

we
else. He reproached himself with not having endeavor.
ed to pursue and recover the boy ; but the keeper soon
satisfied him that the attempt would have been hopeless.
The side of the ravine was at that spot nearly perpen-
dicular ; and none but a boy, unencuinbered and accus.
tomed to expert climbing, could have found his way to the
bottom; and even there it would have been impossible
to prevent his escape among the hollows of the rocks.
6. In addition to which," continued the yeoman,
must have left our horses here ; not among friends, sir;
I did not like the looks of that gang. And I suspect
they knew more of the boy than it was convenient to
confess."
"And what, then, are we to do ?" asked Villiers.
" I think, sir," said the keeper, "if your honor will
trust to me, I can find out something about the matter.
I know something of this pit-folk; and one of them, if I
can find him out, owes me a return for a kindness which
I once did him. He is rather a superior kind of man,
better educated than the rest; and if your honor will
keep quiet, and say nothing, he may be able to help us."
They had now reached the middle of the flat moor,
in which the great iron-works of the forest were situated ;
and hastening on as the evening closed in on them, they
came at a turn of the road upon a point, where they look-
ed down on the wilderness of blackened cabins which
had grown up round them. Tall chimneys vomiting
clouds of smoke, which blighted and encrusted the whole
side of the mountains; vast sheds roofed in with iron
plates, and seemingly in ruins ; gigantic wheels turning
and groaning; and levers of steam-engines heaving as
if wearily, but eternally, up and down ; the whole sur-
rounded with rows of squalid little cottages, without
garden or fence, or creeper, or anything to suggest
comfort or give enjoyment; and at their dunghill-piled
doors and fractured windows groups of filthy men and
haggard women, some drunken and others quarrelling
and blaspheming, --such was the picture which pre-
sented itself Villiers looked round, but in vain, for
a spire or pwer-anything indicating a church; but

there was none. Two shabby meeting-houses he pass-
ed; but when he thought of the work necessary to be
achieved, and remembered what he had seen in America,
he had little faith in the power of meeting-houses to pro-
mote either the peace or the morality of the empire.
It was with a heavy heart that both Bevan and himself
followed the guidance of the keeper to a little inn, neater
than any other building, and dignified with the name of
the Blake Arms Commercial Hotel ; and consigning the
horses to the ostler, they waited in a decent parlor the
return of the keeper, who went to search for his acquain-
tance. Two hours passed heavily without his appearing.
Both Bevan and Villiers were too anxious to converse ;
and even the mountain air had failed to give them an
appetite for the meal which the waiting-maid served up
to them. At last a knock was heard at the door, and the
keeper made his appearance. He was evidently dismay.
ed ; and Bevan, whose courage was not quite of so high
a pitch as Villiers's, began to think with regret on the
chances which had led him into such an expedition. The
keeper explained, however, that he had contrived to find
his acquaintance--that he had sounded him with respect
to Bentleyand was satisfied that the pitman knew more
than he was willing to disclose.
"In fact, sir, from what he said, I cannot help fearing
that things are as bad as we thought. I tried him, sir,
by threats, but that would not do ; for he would not say a
word. Then I went to promises, and offered him money ;
but this would not do. At last, sir, I thought it best to
mention your name; and then he told me that he had
been obliged to me for some kindnesses, and that if a
gentleman wished to speak with him, he would not mind
seeing him. But he was a gentleman himself once,
though now he is only a pitman, and would not regard
so much what he said to you. So, sir, if you like to come
along with me to the Horton works, I will contrive to
get you a chat with him: but I think, sir, you had better
come alone ; only, please, sir, I hope you will take care
and not commit yourself, for these are dangerous folk to
deal with."

Villiers promised to be cautious; and, under the
guidance of his keeper, he proceeded to the Horton
works. It was now pitch dark. The streets, if streets
they might be called, were only dimly and partially
lighted by a stray candle or two from an occasional shop
or public-house, and by a lurid glare which spread over
the horizon above the roof-tops. Many more persons
were struggling along them than they had met earlier
in the evening; and shouts of vulgar revelry and sing-
ing were heard from the beer-shops, which occurred at
every step.
"Don't mind, sir," said the keeper, as Villers seeme
to hesitate at the corner of a filthy alley, "don't mind
sir ; Cookesley is a man I think you may trust. He ha:
told me often that he was born to better things."
And it was indeed Cookesley, the same whom we
have met already at Bentley's bed-side, who had become
acquainted with the keeper in some shooting excursion,
and with whom Villiers was now to communicate.
Villiers smiled at the thought of his servant suspecting
him of fear ; and made his way as quickly as he could
through the mud and filth of the nearest approach
to the Horton works. If he had had no other object in
view, he would have been repaid by the sight which met
him at the entrancea sight by daylight only dreary
and offensive, but in the night-time even sublime. He
was groping his way in the dark, and had stumbled and
nearly fallen in crossing one of the tram-roads, with
which the whole ground was cut up; and, in recovering
himself, he had been all but run over by a line of conl-
waggons, which were moving along the path, when, on
looking up, he saw a vast range of cavern-like arches
yawning before him, and within each, in a deep recess,
a furnace, vomiting forth a blast of flame too bright for
the eye to rest on. Above him, ranges of chimneys,
which broke the long line of ragged roof, were themselves
throwing up a roaring blaze and flaming out like towers
and steeples amidst the ruins of a sacked town aban.

selves, mostly of cast-iron, presented vast arches and
framework, which, seen with the glare of furnaces
behind them, showed like enormous cloisters, of which
the interior was partly consumed and partly still on fire.
The noise of wheels, the rushing of the flames, the hissing
of water, the beating and throbbing of gigantic engines
on each side, the clanking of chains, and the deep hoarse
blasts of the furnaces, sounded in Villiers's ear more
awful than any thing he had ever heard even in the
battle-field. Nor was the irresistible suggestion of an
earthly Pandmonium any way counteracted by the form
of human beings grim with intemperance and exhaustion,
and pale as spectres in the glare of the fires, who moved
about in silence ; here tossing about enormous bars of
white hot iron, as if they were so many sticks; here seiz-
ing and passing them from side to side that they might
be pressed under ponderous rollers, which tossed off from
them, as the bars appeared and re-appeared beneath
their jaws, a shower of flakes of fire and molten metal.
in one place half-naked workmen were feeding the piles
of fuel, into which the blasts poured their torrent of
flame ; and in another, with unwieldy crowbars they
were breaking open the furnaces themselves, and pour-
ing out the liquid lava of metal to run in streams of
dazzling brilliancy into a labyrinth of currents. Villiers
stood amazed; the noise was too deafening to hear or to
speak. And the keeper, who was more familiar with
the place, took him by the arm and led him round to a
shed in the back part of the buildings, where a dark
figure was standing against the wall, and spoke to the
keeper on their approach with a manner and language
far superior to what might have been expected from
his dirty fustian jacket, and hands and face begrimed
with filth.

Few persons possessed in a greater degree than
Villiers that tact and knowledge of the world which
enable us at once to see the accessible points of human
character, and to meet them upon that footing on which
they most wish to be treated. His pride was that of
station, and had rothing in it either personal or selfish ;
and he knew that among the poorest of men, reduced by
fortune from their original position as gentlemen,--that,
even where the degradation has been caused by vice,
still there are few things to which the mind clings with
so much fondness as the name and old associations of a
gentleman. It was as much from delicacy of feeling,
from essential good nature, from the confidence which
his own honor induced him to place in others, as from
policy and maneuvre, that he resolved to throw himself
at once upon the feelings which it was possible the
unhappy man before him migh still retain from his former
situation ; and therefore dismissing the keeper, he took
Cookesley's hand, led him into the shed, where a dim
rushlight was burning on a plank, and making him sit
down on the only seat there was, he proceeded to tell
him openly his name and his object. A short-sighted
manuvrer would have endeavored to hide both, and
would have thought it prudence. Villiers hated mystery;
and had no fear, that he should practise concealment ,
and his course was the wisest. Cookesley knew both
before. But the openness and manliness of the commu-
nication, the confidence which it reposed, and the little
marks of respect which Villiers showed when he alluded
to his knowledge of Cookesley's former condition, won
instantly on all the unhappy man's better feelings.
Something of his own self-respect returned on finding
himself treated with respect by a man like Villiers.
" I think, sir," he said, " we had better put out this
light, for I should not like to be seen holding communi-
cation with you here. They would suspect something;
and we are rather a lawless set. Stay, sir, you can come
round with me to see the works. Gentlemen often do
that at night, and then I can answer you any questions
which it is safe for me to do without our being noticed.
## p. 70 (#426) #############################################

HAWKSTONE.
You have put confidence in me, sir. I am sure I may
put confidence in you."
He then proceeded to tell him so much of Bentley's
story as he had heard himself: that he had been found
late at the Priory ruins by Wheeler, and Wheeler's wife
with him ; that there had been a scuffle, and Bentley
had been stabbed ; and that he would have been thrown
into the well but for the interposition of an Irishman,
whom he had been kind to ; and that he was brought
up into the forest, to be sworn to secrecy, and kept there
till he could return without compromising any one.
" He is here, sir ; and I happen to be a friend of his-
an old schoolfellow, though I am now in this plight ; and
I will do every thing I can for him."
Villiers was thoroughly shocked--shocked at the sug-
gestion which Cookesley took care to give of the cause
of the scuffle ; shocked at the narrowness of the escape ;
shocked at Bentley's present situation. 6 Was the
wound dangerous ?" he asked.
" No, sir ; I was myself, as you have heard, bred for
a doctor, and have taken care of it. But he must be
kept quiet."
66 And
I him?" asked Villiers.
Cookesley not only shook his head, but answered,
peremptorily, "No! it would be as much as his life is
worth, and yours also, sir, for you to do any thing of the
kind. They would make away with him at once if they
suspected that the business was discovered."
"But, my good friend," replied Villiers, "a magis.
trate's warrant would surely enable me to find him, and
take him home?"
Cookesley put his hand on Villiers's shoulder, and
whispered to him to be silentthat they were overheard.
And he proceeded to show Villiers some machinery, and
busy him in some information respecting the process of
casting. But two men followed them, and came close to
Villiers, to scrutinize him with a look of suspicion, as
soon as they could do so without exciting observation,
Cookesley led him away.
" I'll walk home with you, sir, myself. It is an ugly

;
path to find, and pitch dark ; and, to tell the truth, I do
not like the looks of those men who overheard you just
now. This is not a place, or a time, to talk of magis
trates and warrants."
He seemed to breathe more freely as they reached
the road which led into the town. But even then Villiers
perceived that he looked frequently behind him, and
avoided opening his lips on the subject of Bentley till
they reached the inn-door, and Villiers asked him to come
in and sit down. He came in, closed the door of the
room carefully, and, taking his seat at the table, he said,
"Sir, I have done you a kindness, and done it at my own
risk ; for, of course, if you were resolved on going to a
magistrate, you might soon lay hands upon me, and so
could others too. But I trust to your honor as a gentle.
man,
that
you will not let my name be known in this af.
fair, in which I have no concern except as wishing well
to Mr. Bentley, and able, perhaps, to be of service to
him, if all things go quietly. But I tell you fairly, that
I can give you no more information ; and I would earn.
estly advise you not to seek for it. If you will take my
recommendation, gentlemen, who know something more
of this place than you can, you will keep yourselves
within doors this evening : let no one know who you are,
or what you want, and get off as early to-morrow morn-
ing as you can. And if you want never to see Mr.
Bentley again, and to send him down to the bottom of
a pit-hole with a dozen holes in his body, I, who know
the hands into which he has fallen, would advise you to
go to a magistrate, and come up here to search for him
with a body of policemen. If you would have him safe,
you must hush up the matter, and not let a soul know it.
Good evening, gentlemen."
There was a mystery, and a seriousness, and, at the
same time, an obvious reasonableness in his words, which
shook Villiers's resolution to make no delay in obtain-
ing a magistrate's assistance. He stopped Cookesley,
as he was taking up his hat, and questioned him once
more on the motives which rendered it so great an ob.
ject with Bentley's assailant to retain him a prisoner
## p. 72 (#428) #############################################
72
HAWKSTONE.
His promise of secrecy had been given; and if the story
of the origin of the scuffle was true, he was himselt
deeply interested in maintaining it. Why not allow him
at once, to return to his friends ? Cookesley would not
remain to listen ; but shaking his head, and saying that
he could answer no more questions, contented himself
with once more repeating his warning to them to say
nothing, and then Bentley might be saved. " But be
assured," he said, " that the first move which a magis.
trate takes to find him, his life is not worth a farthing.
Good evening, gentlemen ; good evening, keeper : you
are an honest man, and I hope you are not playing me
the rogue in leading me into this trap."
Villiers assured him that no advantage should be
taken of his information to involve him in any incon-
venience : and as he went out of the room with him, he
unobservedly slipped some money into his hand, which
Cookesley, not without a slight effort of resistance, was
easily induced to pocket.
So long as he had before him the fine generous coun,
tenance of Villiers, his frank and sincere manner, and
his voice full of truth, Cookesley, fascinated by the mere
influence of his high-minded character, felt no fear at
the breach of confidence to which he had committed
himself. He had, indeed, betrayed nothing beyond what
was necessary to preserve the life of Bentley, for whom
he was really interested. His warning had been salu-
tary and wise. He knew that any open attempt to search
for him or to release him (for he was, in fact, a prisoner,
strictly watched, although his comforts had been kindly
provided for by himself and the grateful Connell, with
the aid of the good Sisters of Charity) would be futile,
and only lead to some desperate mode of baffling all fur-
ther inquiry. But he knew, also, that among the banditti
with whom he was enrolled, and in whose insurrection.
ary movemments he was deeply involved, an informer
of any kind would be soon detected, and unscrupulously
visited with summary vengeance. He had, indeed, been
wisely silent on the principal reasons which rendered
Wheeler and his gang so anxious to keep Bentley in their

hands. They believed, from his presence at the ruins,
that he must be acquainted with the secret of their arms
and plots, and that any inquiry which might be instituted
into the attack on him would lead to the discovery of
Wheeler's crime, and, through him, to a knowledge of
the preparations and plans which they were forming for

istry unfavorable to the projects by which Romanism
was paving its way to gradual exaltation. The brute
passion of the mob, and their love of plunder, was a
sufficient stimulus to render them, in his dexterous hands,
a pliant body, which he could wield at pleasure through
his subordinate agents, without compromising himself
personally by taking the lead. His quick eye, his ready
suspicious intuition, the impenetrable secrecy which he
threw round his own movements, the art with which he
played instrument against instrument, his obvious interest
and influence with some higher power, the facility with
which he extracted and combined information from his
various spies, and the command which his powerful intel.
lect enabled him to exercise over uneducated and vulgar
mindsall this, coupled with his power of disguising
himself, and accommodating himself to any character
which he chose to assume, rendered him an object of
mingled fear and admiration. Each man felt that he
was at his mercy ; and it was Pearce's chief object that
they should be strongly impressed with such a feeling :
and his one great rule of policy was, to obtain over them
severally an entire command, by possessing himself of
some secret which would make them dependent on him
for their safety.
All this Cookesley, far superior to his miserable
comrades in education and mind, however debased by
profligacy, thoroughly knew. He had struggled more

he was thrown, he finally succumbed to hira, as under a
species of fascination. What, therefore, was his alarm
when, as he came out of the inn door, and had pro-
ceeded a few paces down the street, he heard a step fol.
low him, and found a hand seize him by the arm.
" You must come with me, Mr. Cookesley," said the
deep voice, which he immediately recognised to be
Pearce's. "I have something to say to you."
Cookesley actually shook under the grasp of Pearce ;
but he endeavored to assume a tone of indifference, and
followed him into the Black Lion, a little public-house
opposite to the inn.
"Bring a light !" cried Pearce. " Leave the room!
Shut the door! Why do you stand there ?"
And the little waiting-girl, to whom his orders were
fiercely addressed, ran away as fast as she could from
such a ferocious guest.
" Cookesley," said Pearce, coming up closely to his
panic-struck companion, " you are a traitor !"
Cookesley staggered back and sinking down in a
chair, affected to ask him, with surprise, what he meant ?
"I mean," continued Pearce, fixing on him that
steadfast searching look for which he was so remarka-
ble"I mean that you have betrayed Wheeler and his
set to that person at the inn there, Mr. Villiers. And
you know what traitors deserve, and what in this place
they are sure to meet with."
Cookesley endeavored to stammer out an explanation.
"No words," said Pearce, in the same unbroken
tone, "no explanation. You think, like some others,
that you can act without my seeing you. You did not
suppose that I was by, when that fellow the keeper came
to you, or when you were putting out the candle in the
shed, and showing Villiers the worksah !-or when
you talked of magistrates and warrants. Be advised,"
hpe continued. " When you would do a thing which I
am not to see, or speak a word which I am not to hear,

at sea, out of sight of land, and even then beware lest the

have been closeted with them over there, and you have
told them where that poor wretch Bentley is to be found.
How much money had you for this job ?"
To the former part of the sentence Cookesley was
preparing to answer, boldly and firmly, that he had
given no information whatever; but the latter rather dis-
concerted him.
"I must know all," said Pearce. " How much
money did he give you ?"
And Cookesley pulled out three sovereigns from his
pocket. He was preparing to offer Pearce a share, in
hope that it would mollify him, but Pearce thrust his
hand aside in disdain. So
you
think I am to be
bribed like yourself, Mr. Cookesley; and you a gentle-
man born !"
"Gentleman!" sighed Cookesley, "gentleman ! I'm
no gentleman !"for with his courage and self-confidence
sank all his other better feelings, and he seemed to think
that the only escape from degradation was to bury him
self at once in its lowest depths.
"Do you suppose I want money ?" said Pearce. 66 1
that can have the command of hundredsay, thousands !"
And he pulled a pocket-book from his coat filled with
bank-notes.
" And what then do you want, sir
?" asked Cookesley,
"I have told nothing but that Mr. Bentley is here, and
that the best thing is for his friends to remain quiet, and
say nothing."
" And Villiers, then," said Pearce, almost gnashing
his teeth with hatred as he used the word, " knows noth-
ing of the place where Bentley is lying ?"
" Nothing," said Cookesley. "I would not tell him."
" Nor about the arms ?" continued Pearce,
"Not a syllable," said Cookesley, thinking that he
had mitigated his case. But Pearce would allow noth-
ing of the kind.
" Fool! that you were," he said, " to stop short in your
treacheryto think that you could tell so much safely,
and to be afraid to tell all. Do you suppose," he said,

"that Wheeler and his crew will let you off, because,
while only half a villain, you have been wholly a fool ?"
" Villain ! cried Cookesley, starting up in fury, and
recovering his energy. "How dare you call me villain ?"
Pearce stood unmoved, and only smiled.
"Sit down, sit down, Cookesley. Do not make a
fool of yourself with me. You know there is no great
harm in speaking truth ; and what are we all but ?
Would you call us honest men yourself ?" And he
clapped him on the back, with a laugh, and something
of a kindly manner. Cookesley answered, sulkily,
"No!"
" Well, then, shake hands. I only meant to frighten
you. Nobody knows anything of the matter but myself.
And I'll tell you honestly, I have a greater regard for
you than for any of them put together. I like a man of
education. None of your half-sot, half-brute, that could
do nothing but break heads and get drunk. Your secret,
Cookesley, is safe with me. Only take especial care
that that Wheeler does not hear it. He is as dangerous
a fellow as I know; and I would not give a farthing for
your head, if he knew you had betrayed him."
"I have not betrayed him !" said Cookesley, pas-
sionately.
" Hush ! hush ! do not speak so loud," said Pearce.
" It will be just the same with him, whether you have or
not, if he knows you have been with Villiers. But you
are in my care, and I am your friend. So shake hands."
Cookesley, somewhat relieved, and afraid to exaspe.
rate him, gave him his hand.
"Now will you have something to drink ?" asked
Pearce.
Cookesley nodded his head ; and some brandy-and-
water being brought in, Pearce asked for a piece of
paper, and writing a few lines on it in a false hand, he
folded it up, put it in his pocket, and once more shaking
Cookesley by the hand, and telling him not to be afraid,
Pearce left the room.
Any one who observed him would have been struck
by the paleness of his countenance, as he threw off the

restraint which he had imposed on himself in the pre.
sence of Cookesley. His lips quivered-his eyes glared
horribly-his heart beat: and he strode along the street
as if a demon were pursuing him. Then he stopped
short and falteredthen hurried on-then returned upon
Once or twice he took the paper from his
pocket, and seemed on the point of tearing it to pieces ;
but the passion under which he was laboring recovered
its sway, and replacing it, he pushed on across
fields which lay amidst the broken ground that surround-
ed the pits, until he found himself at the gate of a stone
building adjoining one of the most remote works in the
place. A low tap caused the door to be opened, and
Pearce found Blacker, the same man whom he had parted
with on the road, sitting in a low vaulted room by the side
of a cheerful fire, smoking, and with a glass of punch
before him.
" Is all right ?" asked Pearce.
66 Yes."
" Are the women up-stairs ?"
" No," answered Blacker. "I have sent them
home for the night."
Is the fellow asleep ?"
" Yes ; they dressed his wound, and he has been
asleep for the last hour. I've got rid of Burke and all
of them, and now the ground is quite clear." Pearce
leaned upon the chimney-piece, with his arms folded,
for some minutes, in a gloomy reverie. Once more he
took the paper from his pocket, and prepared to tear it,
and throw it into the fire ; but he caught Blacker's
eyes looking on him with surprise, and something like
contempt ; and starting from his silence, he thrust the
paper into Blacker's hand, and bade him go with it
to the Blake Arms. "Give it to Villiers, and bring
him here."
66 And do
you
think he 'll como ?"
" Try," said Pearce. " You know what to say."
The door closed upon Blacker, and Pearce flung him.

and with an air of unconcern walked about ti look at

Scripture subjects which hung on the walls, till he came
to one which represented the Day of Judgment, and the
miseraile man quailed at it, and hurried away to stir
the fire. As a knock at the door was heard, he actually
sprang from his chair with terror ; but it was only
Blacker returned. Pearce gasped for breath as he saw
him.
** You have been quick," he said ; " will he come ?"
" I have not been down," said Blacker. "I came
back to say a word to you. Why, you seem all aghast!"
And he gazed with surprise at Pearce's face, livid with
contending emotions.

His words were interrupted by a faint voice from
an upper room, asking for some toast-and-water. It was
Bentley, whose kind nurse had left him, and whu, waking
in a fever of thirst, and hearing voices below, endeavored
to make them sensible of his want. But he trembled as
he heard the hoarse voices which growled in the room
beneath, and still more when Pearce called out to him to
be still, with the addition of a ferocious curse on him for
disturbing them.

command over Pearce rose with the perception that

hand to Blacker's mouth to prevent his giving utterance
to the horrible word. " That is all! I want nothing

Cookesley has put me into a flurry with his treachery.
That's all, I assure you !" And he seemed relieved
by hearing from his own lips his intention to do nothing
more.
" Shall I then ?" asked Blacker.
Pearce hesitated. " Yes !--No!-Yes!"
" Well, what do you mean ?" said Blacker, surprised.
"Go or not? Why, you do not know your own mind to-
night. I never saw you in such a way before. What are
we to do if you fall into such tantarums as this, when the
day comes for action ? "
He had struck the key, and the resolution was
formed.
"Go!" said Pearce, peremptorily. And Blacker,
as if anxious to avoid farther doubt, left the building.

CHAPTER VI.
In the meantime Villiers and Bevan were deliberating
on the proper steps for them to take. The situation of
Bentley was obviously most precarious, and might be
rendered fatal by any rash movement on the part of his
friends. Under the most favorable circumstances his
character was at stake if the story of Cookesley was
true ; and when they recalled the scene which they had
witnessed at the ruins, the frenzy of poor Margaret, and
the watch which had been found in her pocket, they
scarcely dared to open their lips on the subject. The
keeper earnestly advised them to take Cookesley's advice,
to return home, and wait quietly, while he would, by
means of Cookesley, keep a watch on all that passed, and
endeavor to procure Bentley's safe return without notice
or observation.
" A little money, sir," he said, " judiciously employed,
will do much-much more than a whole body of police
and fifty magistrates." Bevan was much inclined to side
with him ; but Villiers hesitated. It was a compromise
of principle with him to seek by maneuvre what ought
to be attainable by law. He could not bear the thought
of quitting the forest from fear of having violence offered to
them; and he resolved to remain there privately, while
Bevan returned, and to seek some opportunity of obtain.
ing farther communication with Cookesley, and through
him with Bentley. His mind had just been made up,
when the waiter came in with a shabby note, which had
been brought for Mr. Villiers by a person who was waiting
on the outside. Villiers was surprised, but remembering
that Cookesley knew his name, he was less astonished to
find that the note came from him. It was to say that he
had found an opportunity of letting Villiers see Mr. Bent-
ley, if he would come along with the bearer, who was a
trustworthy person ; and again enjoining his secrecy,
and committing himself to Villiers's honor, the writer had
added, in a postscript, that one of the three sovereigns

which Villiers had given him was a bad one; but he did
not wish to make any allusion to this, satisfied that a
gentleman would make it worth his while to run such a
risk for him.
This last allusion Pearce had artfully introduced ;
and it had the full effect of satisfying Villiers that the
note came from the same party who had already exhibited
so much better feeling than could have been expected
from his situation.
" Show the man in," said Villiers.
But the waiter returned, and said that the bearer
would like to speak with Mr. Villiers alone. Villiers
went into another room. Blacker told his tale with ap.
parent openness. He had been sent by Cookesley ;
could show the way to the house where Bentley was
lying ; but beyond that he knew nothing.
* And will you go ?" said Bevan to him on his re-
turn to the room. "Will you trust yourself in such a
place as this to a man of whom you know nothing, and
upon such an expedition ?"
The keeper ventured to remonstrate also, but with no
effect.
" Let us go with you at least," they said.
"No," replied Villiers ; "the stipulation is, that I
come alone ! and if I am to do any good, it must be by
venturing everything."
" You will take my pistols, sir ?" said the keeper.
Villiers at first hesitated. "I know," he said, "that
there is risk; but I must trust wholly to another arm
than my own. No precaution of this kind can save me
if it is His pleasure that I should fall into mischief.
With Him I am safe unarmed; and to Him I shall com-
mit myself."
Bevan, however, urged upon him the duty of provi.
ding human means of defence as well as of relying upon
Providence ; and he consented to take the arms. He
went up stairs for a few minutes, remained humbly upon
his knees in prayer, and returned, calm and composed,
to accompany Blacker, charging upon his companions to
remain where they were, and not to follow him

The clouds which had obscured the carly part of the
night had now swept away, and the stars threw a faint
light on the path which his guide iook. It crossed the
principal thoroughfares of the straggling town, till it fel?
into a tram-road between two walls, one of which
Blacker cleared with a spring, and requesting Villiers
to follow him, he led the way across some fields. Villiers
hesitated for a moment as he looked round on the solitude
of the spot, so favorable to any treachery or violence;
but Blacker assured him there was no fear; and the for.
ward, conceited young man, proul of an oppportunity of
making acquaintance with a gentleman, fell into the
conversation which Villiers opened with a view of ascer.
taining the character of his companion. He found him
talkative, vain, and pert; and evidently full of his own
importance, to which he more than once alluded with an
air of mystery, especially when Villiers endeavored to
obtain from him some information on the subject of Bent-
ley. He threw out hints that it might not be difficult for
Mr. Bentley to get away if he had any friend to help
him ; that he himself could show any person the way if
he had a mind. All that would be wanted would be a
little money. And Villiers felt persuaded that he should
find no difficulty in obtaining his guide's assistance if he
found Bentley capable of being moved. He talked to
the young man in a kind and considerate manner; sug-
gested that his present situation was not one fitted for a
person who had evidently received a good education ;
hinted at his own means of being serviceable to him;
and before they had reached the cottage, Blacker was
congratulating himself that in serving the ends of Pearce
he was at the same time providing for himself a friend
of so much importance as Villiers, and whom he could
now lay under a lasting obligation. He was not indeed
without his misgivings as to Pearce's intentions ; but he
knew nothing of Pearce's feelings towards the person
whom he was conducting; and accounting to himself for
the strange disturbance and paroxysm of feeling under
which Pearce had labored by the anxiety which had
been caused by the discovery of Cookesley's communi.

cation with Villiers, he reached the door of the cottage
where Bentley lay.
Everything was silent around it. A light was dimiy
burning in each of two windows, both of them curtained
and closed, one on the ground-floor, and the other in the
room above it; but no one could be seen ; and only one
person was near, hidden behind a projection of the wall
within a shed, which allowed him to observe what passed
at the door through an aperture in some planks. Blacker
bade Villiers remain, without speaking or moving, under
cover of a heap of rubbish. He unlatched the door cau-
tiously, but the room was empty, the fire burning clear,
and the candle flickering in the socket. He then as-
cended the stairs, looked into all the rooms, and having
satisfied himself that there was no one in the cottage,
even under the beds or in the closets, he brought Villiers
carefully within the door, and led him up the creaking
stairs to Bentley's room, charging him not to say under
whose guidance he had come there.
No eye but one had witnessed the expression of
Pearce's demoniacal countenance, when, after waiting,
breathless and palpitating with suspense for the return of
Blacker, he saw him through the aperture of the door
approach, and Villiers with him. He
sprang up with a
ferocious triumph, but checked himself, lest he should
make a noise. " Fool! dolt! idiot, that he is !" he
muttered to himself, " to be caught by such a feather!
He is mine! I have him in my power! Now what is
to be done with him?" And he threw himself back
against the wall with the look of a gambler whose whole
soul had been concentrated in one throw of the dice,
and to whom it had been successful. Whatever mis.
givings, or relentings, or balancings he had admitted be-
fore, between the desire of obtaining a thorough com.
mand over Wheeler through the means of Bentley, and
the thirst for revenging himself on Villiers, all had now
vanished. The sight of the man whom he hated with
such a bitter hatred-hated as one who had been in.

visitings. He remembered (for even in his paroxysms
of
passion he could still calculate) that he had committed
himself to Blacker farther than was safe, and filled
himself with the very spirit of intrigue ; and conscious
how little any one could place confidence in himself, he
trembled at the thought of permitting any one to possess
a secret which might place him in the power of another.
His mind was made up; and scarcely had Villiers and
Blacker mounted the stairs when Pearce emerged from
his hiding-place. He paused to listen, but everything
was silent. Once he faltered and relented, but the sound
of some person's footsteps coming down the stairs drove
the doubt from his mind ; and the first thing which
Blacker heard, on his entering the lower room, was the
double-locking of the door from without, and instantly
afterwards the barring of the shutters.
" Mr. P--" but he checked himself before he
uttered the word. " Is that you ? is that you? Let me
out."
But there was no answer. He rushed to the back
door, which opened into a little court, but that also was
locked and fastened; he shook it, but the door was firmly
closed. Once more he went round to the front door, and
endeavored to open it, or to induce Pearce, if there, to
undo it ; but both his efforts were unsuccessful. He tried
the window, but it was small; and in a place very subject
to robbery, iron stancheons had been firmly fixed across
it, which defied all egress as well as ingress.
" Is this a joke ?" he said to himself. But a little
reflection on the nature of the game which Pearce with
himself was playing, and on the thoroughly reckless
character of the gang with whom he was surrounded and
identified, prohibited him from indulging such a thought.
He once more shook the door, tried to batter upon its
pannels, called upon Pearce, but all in vain.
He sat
down and rubbed his eyes and his forehead, from which
a sweat was breaking in a cold dew. Then he remem.
bered Pearce's unusual agitation. He recalled to mind
how willing he had been to sacrifice Wheeler the moment
he found him dangerous. A morrent's reflection con.

vinced him that as little scruple would be shown in
sacrificing himself; and, resuming his quick thought and
energy with the emergency, he hastened instantly into
Bentley's room.

cated. And Blacker, notwithstanding his alarm for him-
self, had the thoughtfulness to call Villiers out of the
room, and explain to him the danger of their position, so
is not to alarm Bentley,
" There is no time to be lost, sir," he said. "I cannot
venture to stay here myself, and I would recommend you
to follow my example. It cannot be for any good that
any one should wish to catch us in such a trap as this.":
"I do not leave this place," said Villiers,
66 without
Mr. Bentley; and you must do as you like."
"But Mr. Bentley, sir, cannot be moved; he is too
weak. And if he could, how is he to get out ? Perhaps
I or you might be able to drop out of the upper window;
but he could never do it."
" And what do you apprehend?" asked Villiers.
Surely, in a country like England, we need not fear
any outrage of the kind you seem to suspect ?"
" Sir," said Blacker, hastily, " it is too late to argue.
But I see you know nothing of the state of this part of
the country; and it is all over with me, whether I speak
or not. But we are on the eve of a break-out, and Mr.
Bentley knows all about it; and if he get away home,
everything would come out; and rather than that he, or
any friend of his, should give warning, there are men
here who would not scruple at anything. It is a miracle
that he was not put out of the way at the first, only that
he was always good and kind to the poor, and poor
himself; and we have no war except with the rich."
"Outbreak!" said Villiers, alarmed. "Do you mean
an insurrection ?"
"Yes, sir, I mean a regular insurrection, or whatever
you please to call it. And now, sir, will you think of
moving, before they come and find us here?"

" I do not leave this place," repeated Villiers, " with
out Mr. Bentley."
" Then, sir, you cannot leave it at all, that's clear;
and I must be off. Do not think, sir, that I meant you
any harm by bringing you into this scrape. If you will
follow me, I think I can get out; but if not, you must
take your chanceand a bad chance it is."
Villiers was now alive to the full danger of their
situation. He was satisfied, from Blacker's manner, that
he was not a party to any evil design upon him, and was
himself in peril.
Stop a moment," he said, " while I
return to Mr. Bentley."
In a few words he suggested to Bentley the possibility
of escape, if he could summon strength and courage.
" Could he dress?"
And Bentley, half bewildered and terrified, rose from
the bed and endeavored to put on his clothes, like one
awakened from a dream. He was scarcely conscious of
his wound, or of the weakness which had followed it.
Villiers found his clothes for him lying on a chair; only
one thing was missing, but this the most important-
his shoes. Blacker, who had by this time come into
the room to say that he could wait no longer, was sur-
prised to find Bentley all but prepared to depart. " But
how," he exclaimed, " are we to get him out of the
window ?"
" Look for the shoes down stairs," said Villiers.
And as Blacker crept down, and found them lying
under a dresser, he heard footsteps also and voices close
at the door.
"It's too late," he whispered, " too late--they are
come; better stay still, and make the best of it. I'll
stand your friendI 'll tell the truthI 'll say that
He was going to mention Pearce's name, but the con-
sciousness of his complete powerlessness to resist the
artifices and designs of such a man, for whatever purpose
contrived, struck him dumb. " Hush!" he said; "they
are at the door." And he endeavored to peep behind
the curtain without being seen, and to ascertain how
many there were.

" If there are only two or three, sir, why we may bo
match for them."
His suggestion was right. Pearce, with whom it was
a paramont maxim of policy to do no evil himself which
he could procure to be done by others, and to keep him-
self concealed like a spider at the bottom of his web,
while he threw his nets around him to entangle his
victims, as if by their own agency, the moment he had
fastened the door, had retired to a little distance, and
from thence had despatched a boy, whom he accidentally
met, with such a message to the leader of the gang as
he knew would bring them to the spot. But only three
had
come, and had come unprovided with weapons.
Pearce himself would have made a fourth; but it would
by no means have suited his purpose to take any part
except that of a seeming by-stander in the issue, whatever
it might be. The party were ignorant of the real state
of the case; but were surprised and alarmed to find the
door bolted and barred, and no answer returned to their
knockings. And while deliberating what they should do,
Pearce stole from his concealment, tapped one of them
on the shoulder, unseen by the others, and withdrawing
him to a little distance, said a few words to him, and
then hastily retired. But they were amply sufficient.
And while two of the ruffians remained quietly watching
the door, the other went off for a reinforcement. None
of them said anything but a muttered oath, but their eyes
exchanged looks of the most determined and savage
ferocity; and they shook hands and exchanged signs, as
if to pledge and assure each other of their determination
to hesitate at nothing.
In the meanwhile Villiers had listened, but all was
silent; and thinking it possible that the former might
have been a false alarm, he once more resolved to attempt
their escape. Bentley was dressed, and resting upon
the bed. Blacker stood at the door striving to catch
every sound ; but hearing nothing, he concluded also him.
self that the party had 'etired for some purpose, and that
they might still have time. 6 Follow me," he said.
And he led them into little low carret, which occupied

a small gable at the back of the building.
With a strong
hand he tore away the decayed lattice ; and showing
Villiers a low shed which lay about eight feet under-
neath, asked him if he could drop upon that, and support
himself on the sloping roof while he assisted Bentley
to do the same. Villiers, full of strength and activity,
and, as a soldier, accustomed to exertion of all kinds,
hesitated not a moment. He dropped on the tiles with-
out disturbing more than one, but this rattled and
fell to the ground; and a low growl, as of a mastiff dog
uneasy in his sleep, was heard just beneath them. Bent-
ley himself, now thoroughly master of his senses, slided,
by the aid of Blacker, through the window, and was
received safely in Villiers's arms; Blacker himself fol.
lowed. And creeping along the ridge of the roof, he show.
ed Villiers a water-butt, by which, with care and dexterity,
it might be easy to descend. In this, in fact, there was
but little difficulty.
"We shall then," whispered Blacker, " be in a little
back yard, between the court and the works ; and there
is a gate which we can easily force, and then reach the
open fields, where we can inake play for it." Silently
and steadily Villiers dropped from the shed to the water-
butt ; but as he grasped it, the rotten supports on which
it rested tottered, and nearly gave way.
At this moment
a noise was heard at the door of the building. Before
Villiers could warn Bentley to descend with caution, he
had hurried down, slipped on the edge of the butt, and
the whole with a tremendous crash, tumbled over to the
ground, throwing Bentley upon his face, and deluging
Villiers with the water. Neither had recovered them-
selves, when an immense mastiff, which was kennelled
underneath, sprang to the full length of his chain with a
tremendous barking. He leaped, and tossed, and rolled
over, when caught by his collar, as, maddened with rage,
he flew first at one and then at the other. His kennel
lay close to the gate, which offered the only egress from
the little court into which they had fallen ; and Blacker,
who still hung upon the ledge of the roof, gave himself
up for lost. Villiers, however, heard the tramp of feet

coming up the lane, and bade him jump down without
delay. " We must shoot the dog : I have pistols with
me.' But just as he was taking one out, the animal
threw all his strength into one desperate plunge, his chain
broke, and before Villiers could seize his pistol, the brute
had fastened on his chest, and was dragging him to the
ground. Villiers felt its teeth in his flesh; but he
remained quite cool.
" Open the gate," he said to Blacker, "and do you
and Mr. Bentley get out while I manage the dog, Do
not mind me." And while he was still grappling with
the mastiff, he had the satisfaction to see the gate open.
But it opened from the wong side.
* Well done, growler! Hollo! here they are !"
were the unwelcome words which came from the ruffian
who had opened it. " Well done, growler! hold him
fast!" But at this instant Villiers mastered his pistol,
and fired. The shot grazed the head of the mastiff, but
no more ; and Villiers, finding that it still retained its
hold, threw down the pistol, grasped the neck of the
animal with both his hands, and nearly choking it, com-
pelled it to loose its hold. He hurled it down violently on
the ground, close at the feet of the ruffian who had just
appeared ; and the animal on recovering itself, sprang
furiously upon the man's face, as the first object that
offered, and in a moment pulled him down, roaring for
help, and vainly endeavoring to pacify the animal,
whose fangs were buried in his cheek. Not an instant
was to be lost ; Blacker seized Villiers by one hand, and
Bentley by the other, and dragging them up the steep
side of a heap of slag, so that their figures might not be
seen against the sky, he hurried them into a deep hole
on the other side, and down a rugged path into a nar-
row lane.
Now, run for our lives! straight on," he said.
" Can you run ?" said Villiers to Bentley.
" Yes, yes; make haste," replied Bentley ; but he
was evidently sinking.
"Give him this," said Blacker: and he pulled a flask
of brai dy out of his pocka, and made him take a con.

siderable quantity. " Come on now." And Villiers,
seizing Bentley by the arm, and almost lifting him along
the ground, followed Blacker down the lane.
" If we get round that corner," said Blacker, as they
paused for an instant to take breath, "we are safe."
At this moment they heard steps behind them.
"Go on," said Villiers, " yourself, with this gentle.
man. I have my pistols, and will bar the way against
any of them : hurry on!" And fixing himself in a
favorable position against the wall, he calmly awaited
the pursuers. They came up, running as in chace, two
of them, and armed; each, as far as their figures could
be seen in the dark, of a stout athletic frame. The first
thought of Villiers was to fire at once. He closed his
eyes, uttered a short prayer, and was preparing to take
aim, when he paused to reflect that the life of a fellow..
creature was not to be destroyed until the last emergency;
and that it was better to trust to the protection of Provi-
dence than to an arm of flesh. "I will not fire," he
said, " till compelled." But he had scarcely made the
resolution when a third man sprang upon him from the
other side of the wall; and he found himself disarmed and
powerless, in the hands of-three policemen.
CHAPTER VII.
I'wo hours after that Villiers was standing by the side of
Bentley's bed, at the Blake Arms, watching his disturbed
sleep, and ready to supply him, for the last time, with any-
thing he might want before he himself retired to rest.
His own breast, which had been savagely lacerated by
the dog, had been dressed by a surgeon, but was still
exquisitely painful. Bevan, who had been suffering du-
ring Villiers's absence tortures of anxiety, but who had
not ventured to disobey his injunction to abstain from
following him, had also gladly lain down, with a mind rc.

lieved, and a body wearied with his previous agitation.
The keeper was placed in a doublebedded room with
Blacker, who had declared himself a lost man if he ever
returned to the pits again, and whom Villiers had made
as happy as his anxious position admitted by a promise
of providing for him. The clock ticked gently on the
stairs, and all the inmates of the house lay buried in
sleep, without the slightest apprehension of any danger
-all but one. To the keeper's infinite disgust and
innoyance, Blacker tossed and rolled from side to side,
and finding himself unable to rest, would fain lave pre-
vented the keeper also from sleeping by a variety of
questions, which, however, met no answer but a heavy
Several times he rose from his bed, and opened
the window, stretching out his head to catch any
sound
vhich might come upon the wind. "How I wish," he
exclaimed at last, " that morning were here! Is not
that the dawn?" But at that moment the clock struck
two, and, with a beating heart, Blacker returned to his
pillow.
Villiers himself was not wholly comfortable. Je
ulso stopped on the stairs, to listen if he could hear any
noise in the distance ; and did not forget to lay his loaded
pistols on his dressing-table. He had easily satisfied the
policemen that there was no necesslty to apprehend him,
as running away after committing some offence, which
they had at first suspected ; and he had ordered them to
overtake Blacker and Bentley, which was easily done
just as Bentley was fainting, and Blacker could no
longer support him. Together they carried him to the
inn ; but the conversation which Villiers then had with
the superintendent was by no means satisfactory. Clever,
active, acute, and sensible, the superintendent was per-
fectly aware that mischief was working round him. His
means, however, of detection or repression, were very
limited. He did not hesitate to inform Villiers that he
had privately written to obtain a small military force,
which might assist him on any emergency. But the
whole district was so remote, its population had been
gathered together so suddenly, there was such a total
## p. 92 (#448) #############################################

HAWKSTONE
But this, per-
absence of any resident gentlemen to organize or direct
resistance to a popular disturbance, and the mass of vice,
intemperance, and ferocity, was so fearful, that he ex-
pressed no little uneasiness, if any explosion should occur.
"One thing," he said, " he was assured of, that some 
other agency was employed in preparing for it besides
what might be expected in a population of the kind.
Communications in a foreign language had been traced ;
men of education were frequently seen in intercourse
with the workmen. There was no scarcity of money ;
and he remarked, also, that great efforts were making to
introduce some Romish establishments in the place. A
chapel had been built, and a nunnery:
haps," he continued, " was not surprising, when the
people had been so entirely abandoned by the Church.
Papists were not to blame for endeavoring to give
them some notions of religion. Better to be papists than
heathens !"
And Villiers sighed, as he assented. He pressed the
superintendent to take some refreshment, but the officer
was evidently anxious, and wished to depart. He asked
a second time for Villiers's statement of what had passed,
and what he had heard ; and noted it down upon paper.
As he left the room, Villiers observed that his eye was
making observations on the size of the hall, the position
of the staircase, the direction of the doors.
" You have been a soldier, I suppose ? " said Villiers.
"Yes, sir; in the Second Dragoons.'
" I have been in the army, also," said Villiers ;
and he was a little surprised at the man's answer-
66 Thank God! sir. Then, perhaps, you may be of use
to us.
If you are going to bed, sir, I think I should
advise you to lock the doors of these rooms." He
himself tried the handle of another, which led into the
back-yard.
" This is not a bad place," he said, smiling, " for
a defence, if ever we should come to that. However, I
must not stop. I wish you a good night, sir. If I
should hear any thing, you won't be surprised at my
returning.'

" Certainly not," said Villiers ; and they shook
hands, and parted. Villiers called after him, to ask him
one question.
"Do you think," he said, "it would be advisable for
us to leave this place immediately, and not to wait till the
morning?"
The officer paused to think. But a little reflection
convinced them both that Bentley could not be moved
without inminent danger; and there was no conveyance
in which he could be placed comfortably. There was
also the risk of exposure in a dark night along roads
where it was probable that watches would be placed.
And reassured by the officer's expression of a hope that
there was nothing to apprehend that night, Villiers retired
to his room. A bible lay upon his dressing-table ; and
his mind became calmed as he gave up his usual time to
read the evening lessons, and knelt more than his usual
time to return thanks for the hand which had been
stretched out to protect him in the danger from which he
had just escaped. He thought, also, of the position
which he should henceforth occupy as a magistrate and
a landlord, of his duties, and difficulties, and perils, sur-
rounded as he should be by such a population. The
plans which he had long been forming were now to be
put in execution; and as the evils with which he would
have to contend were brought more closely under his eye,
their magnitude appalled hiin; and the powerlessness of
any single arm to encounter them tempted him at one
moment to think of abandoning them altogether, but, at
the next, they induced him to take refuge from all anx-
ieties in the simple rosolution to do his duty in his own
province, and to the utmost of his means, without vainly
attempting to calculate consequences, which must depend
on a higher power. It was this principle which gave to
all his movements such quietness and composure, even
amidst the utmost activity. It quieted and composed him
now ; and though he hesitated for a moment, he re-
solved at last to undress, and endeavor to obtain some
sleep, instead of lying down, as he had first contemplated,
in his clothes, that he might be ready for any emergency.

At this point it may be well to return, for a inoment,
to the chief agent in all this plot. As soon as he had

triumphant; all his plans had been successful ; all his
instruments had proved docile, and pliant to his hand.
His machinery had played smoothly, stroke upon stroke,
without an embarrassment or a flaw.
As a mere game,
as a trial of skill, an exercise of power, the achievement
was full of satisfaction. But the mystery and secrecy in
which he hugged himself, while he saw his tools risking
their lives, and all at his disposal, without being able to
involve him in their own peril, thrilled him to the quick.
His face almost assumed a cast of dignity from the con-
sciousness of the power which he possessed. His eyes
lighted up as he reflected that, whatever was the result,
the game must turn to his own advantage. It was one
of the deepest, and at the same time the most difficult
and perilous parts of the policy in which he had been
initiated, so to combine the threads of his stratagems
that if one should fail he might easily grasp the others.
Singleness of aim was foreign to all his operations.
With the religious and political plots in which he was
involved he had mixed up his own private intrigues and
revenge ; and he never lost sight of either.
To em-
barrass an obnoxious ministry, to further the cause of
his religion, or, as it should rather be said, of his frater-
nity, to revenge himself on Villiers, to recover a com.

beginning to waver in their dependenceall were in his
mind parts of one great scheme, twisted together like
cords in a single rope.
But the predominant thought at
this moment was revenge. It was very sweet.

to rouse itself, beneath the cold, dark, dreary solitude in
which he had been waiting. And he had drunk-he
who in his ordinary habits refrained from all indulgence
of the kind, lest he should be led to forget, and cominit
himself. He was now fortified. And if in
any
wander:
ing of thought his mind fell upon ideas which made him
falter, he lashed himself into the full tide of passion again
by calling up images of past days, of a foreign clime, of
hopes which had been blighted, of enjoyments which had
been snatched from him, and of insult offered him, by
the man whom he had now within his grasp. And when
such thoughts failed to restore the uncompunctious tri-
umph in which he would fain revel, there was an ano-
dyne ready at hand. He himself was doing nothing.
If blows were struck, or violence offered, he was not the
guilty actor. It would be the deed of others; and his
conscience (such was the morality in which he had been
educated) would remain clear. And afier all, it was for
the good of the Church. He was obeying his spiritual
superior. He could obtain absolution. If any one had
asked him what precisely he expected to be the issue of the
rencounter which he had contrived, he would have found
it difficult to answer; for he had never dared to face
fully the probability which, fearful as it was, lay lurking
at the bottom of his thoughts. He knew that the hounds
whom he had let loose upon their prey were strong,
quick-scented, ferocious, and not to be daunted by any
fear of blood. He believed that their prey itself was
driven into a corner--all but chained to a stake. He
knew, also, that if any accident (for accident he continued
to call it) should remove Villiers from the world, he had
the means in his power of securing wealth and power
beyond his most sanguine wishes, provided only he could
recover from Wheeler, in whose hands he believed it to
exist, a single packet of mysterious and important docu-
ments. This was one vision which opened to him. On
the other hand was the chance, nay, certainty, of involv-
ing Wheeler himself in some fresh difficulty and crime,
which would place him more completely at his disposal,
But there was also a third. He had received that morn

ing orders to hasten, by every means in his power, the:
outbreak which had long been preparing in that part of
England. Its ultimate success was hopeless; its object
idle, so far as the apparent agents and movers were con-
cerned. But for these no care was entertained by parties
behind the curtain, who employed them, as puppets, for
their own ulterior and more extensive designs. An in-
surrectionary movement was required just then in that
quarter to aid a political negotiation, in which the
emissaries of Rome, or rather of his fraternity, were
engaged ; and it was to be procured at any sacrifice.
Pearce knew well how soon a fray may be turned, when
minds are heated and materials well laid, into a rebel-
lion ; and he felt as a man who had set fire to a train,
and was now waiting in safety for its explosion. With
these imaginations he solaced himself while watching
the approach of Wheeler's additional party, his face laid
close to the little window of the shed in which he had
ensconced himself. The delay was shorter than he had
expected. They came in quite sufficient strength to master
any resistance.
He saw bludgeons in their hands : he
had little doubt that more formidable weapons were
concealed about them. His breath heaved quicker as
they proceeded to unbar the door. At that instant the
barking of the dog broke upon him, and he listened on
tiptoe, with his face pressed close on the window, and
his blood almost ceasing to flow. There was a stir at
the door of the house, and figures appeared coming back,
as if in search of something, and dispersing themselves
in different directions. The pistol-shot was fired, aud
he heard a shout. His knees tottered, his breath went,
all his blood seemed to rush at once to his heart and
smother him. The end-was it come ? For one mo.
ment his conscience awoke in all its force, and flew at
him like a tiger; and if any one could have seen his face,
they would have read in it the agony of a damned sou
He staggered into the air, leaned against the door-post,
while the cold wind sweeping across his head, from
which his hat had fallen, revived him, and changed the
"Hrrent of his thoughts ; and in that position he saw the

iverty issue from the house ; and as one of them hastened
jaust, he managed, as if unconcernedly, to ascertain from
him that the prisoners had escaped.
" All ?" asked Pearce.
" Yes, all." His first thought was to thank the for-
tune which had saved him from the gratification of his
wishes. But the demon-spirit rushed back to his heart,
and he felt that everything was a blank. As another of
the pursuers ran past the door-way in which he was
standing, he felt as if he would willingly have joined in
the chase. But even when scarcely master of his rea.
son, he was retained mechanically by the habitual reserve
which he had practised in abstaining from any direct
participation in the plots which he was weaving. At
one time he thought of retiring, and leaving it to the next
day to ascertain results, and discover in what way they
might be turned to his advantage. He had forgotten, in
the thought of Villiers, that Blacker was with him, and
had fled with him, had therefore betrayed himself, or
could betray him, not only to Villiers, but to Wheeler.
Even his mind, under strong emotion, had been unable
to retain all the complication of his manuvres ; but,
like a chess-player who, at the moment when the game
seems decided, discovers a move which had been over:
lookedor, rather, as a gambler stripped of everything,
and roused from his stupor of despair by finding another
piece of gold thrust into his hand to recommence his
play,--he no sooner recollected Blacker than he started
up, and recovering all the powers of his mind, plunged
once more into his calculations of intrigue, and paced
slowly, with his arms folded, before the door of the little
shed. Just as his course was taken (and it was taken
with a rapidity and determination worthy a better cause),
on turning upon his heel to strike down a dark passage,
he was confronted suddenly by Wheeler, breathless, and
infuriated with disappointment and alarm.
"Is this any work of yours, Mr. Pearce ?" exclaini-
ed the ruffian, with an oath. 66 You are a man of many
names and many ways. I say, sir, have you had any
hand in this ? I tell you, you shall answer for it with

your life. There's not a man shall come here stealing
and sneaking about, and like a cowardly rascal putting
other people's fingers in the fire, while he is afraid to
show his face himself, be he who he may. I'll not stand
it, sir! We'll none of us stand it! Hollo! Jack, here
seize this fellow !"
And one of his companions came up, and together
they collared Pearce, and dragged him down the gate.
way. Pearce's blood ran cold within him. Wheeler
was furious, was armed, was half intoxicated. His ner.
vous muscular grasp had seized Pearce by the throat, so
that he could neither move nor speak. He knew that
Wheeler hated and feared him-had imposed upon him
-had obtained possession of documents on which all his
own prospects depended,that he was acknowledged by
all the gangs of ruffians implicated in the approaching
outbreak as their head and captain,that he was full of
jealousy and resentment at the endeavor which Pearce
had made to supplant him by Blacker,that he was des-
perate at the danger in which he was involved by the
escape of Bentley,and had long since discarded every
shadow of scruple at the commission of any crime.
Wheeler's clutch griped him like the claw of a tiger,
and every moment he expected to be struck down. He
stood perfectly motionless ; and Wheeler, finding no re.
sistance, bade his companion go and tell Roberts to find
out that brute Connell, and bring him by the neck to the
" Black Lion," and then come back. He could manage
Pearce in the meantime. And slightly slackening his
hold, so that Pearce recovered the power of speaking,
he presented a pistol to his head, and bade him not stir
for his life. It was not necessary to give such a caution.
Pearce, with his thorough knowledge of human nature,
was perfectly aware that his only course was to avoid
motion, look, or word, which could keep up the excite.
ment under which Wheeler
was laboring. Sand, he
often had said to himselfsoft, yielding, shifting sand, is
the only effectual barrier against the waves of an Atlan-
tic. By a strong effort he threw his mind into a totally
different train of thought, as if all that had happened,

99
and especially all that he had done himself, had never
been ; and by this means he both recovered his coolness
and was able the better to assume the appearance of sur-
prise and innocence. But his first anxiety was to as-
certain whether Wheeler's attack and accusation was a
mere ebullition of drunken passion and jealousy, or was
founded on any discovery of his own communication with
Blacker.
" Mr. Wheeler," he said, calmly (he used this for-
mality in addressing him, knowing that with an exas.
perated mind it is necessary to preserve a distance, and
that too near an approach or affectation of friendship
only increases the irritation), " Mr. Wheeler, you have
just been grievously injured, and like other men you fall
into a passion with the first person you meet, even though
he is a friend. But I know what has happened, and can
easily forgive you. Tell me, is there any chance of
catching them ?"
"None," growled Wheeler; and Pearce knew
that he had gained his first move. He had induced his
enemy to answer him a direct question by putting one
which only required a monosyllable for reply. It was
the first step to a regular parley; and this once obtained,
Pearce knew that he could manage all the rest.
"How many were there ?" asked Pearce.
Three," said Wheeler, sulkily; and his hand re-
laxed its grasp on Pearce's collar.
" Which way did they go ?" asked Pearce. But
the question was injudicious. It roused Wheeler's pas-
sion by compelling him to declare his ignorance, and to
speak at length; and he answered fiercely, with an oath,
6. How should I know ? I believe if there's a man in
this place knows, it's yourself." And Pearce felt the
grasp of his hand tighten, and the muzzle of the pistol
approach nearer to his forehead; but he was assured
that Blacker had not been taken, and his course was
now clear.
"Wheeler," he said, with coolness, "why all this
violence ? What right have you to suspect me of doing
this mischief, when you know that I was the person who

sent word to bring you here? I happened to be here.
I saw two men enter. I barred the door behind them,
and sent off at once to you; and in return for this, here
you are threatening to shoot me.
Put down your pistol,
man, and be calm."
It was his first step to re-assume the tone of com.
mand which he had always asserted over Wheeler as
over others; and to his great satisfaction he found the
charm was not lost. The pistol was lowered, and
Pearce began to breathe more freely. At this moment
footsteps were heard in the lane, and Wheeler moved as
if to look out. A man of less tact than Pearce would
have made an effort to escape. Instead of this he laid
his hand softly on Wheeler's arm, and whispered,
"Stay here, don't move ; it may be a policeman :" and
once more Wheeler obeyed the suggestion. It showed
an absence of fear, and anticipated his own intention ;
and Pearce knew that to obtain submission generally,
we must begin by requiring what there is no objection
to grant. It brought Wheeler's mind also, though only
in a trifling act, into accordance with Pearce ; and thus
it was a step towards a renewal of sympathy. All this
had been taught to Pearce by the men under whose
skilful direction he had been brought up, and still more
by his own practical experience of human nature. He
was once more playing a game-a game of intrigue.-
fishing, as he profanely expressed it, for men, or rather
getting a savage animal whose claw was on his throat
into his net, not by hounds and spears, but by smooth
words and a gentle hand.
" Draw back !" he again whispered.
6. Let us stand
in the shade-closer to me!-here!" and Wheeler
Cound himself drawing to the side of the man whom a few
minutes before he was prepared to shoot dead upon
the
spot. Here was association and communion.
" Are they passed ? " whispered Pearce.
" Yes," replied Wheeler, in a whisper; and this se.
cret communication into which the ruffian was drawn,
almost without being aware of it, completed Pearce's
charm. The pistol was dropped, the grasp on his colla,

removed, and now all that remained for Pearce was
io bend once more to his will, and use as his tool, the
man whom he knew would not have scrupled to be his
murderer.
Wheeler," he said, " it is not safe for us to be here.
Job Stuart's house was broken open last night; and
there are three policemen watching round in this direction.
Let us walk quietly away. Do not hurry--take hold of
my arm.
Wheeler hesitated, and looked at him suspiciously ;
and once more put his hand into his pocket to seize his
pistol.
" None of your tricks, Mr. Pearce ; I know you well.
Leave go my arm."
It was now Pearce's time to affect anger and resent.
ment. He thrust Wheeler's arm from him with just
sufficient violence to indicate passion in himself without
provoking it in his companion. "Go your way, man,"
he said, " go your way.
What is to become of all your
great plans and bold undertakings, if the leader of them
can 't distinguish between his friends and his foes? How
do
you
think
you 'll ever be able to keep your men
together, or do your job, if you give way to these foolish
jealousies and suspicions ? What is it to me whether
you walk with me or not? I am going to the Black Lion.
Do you choose to come?"
And Pearce walked on while Wheeler followed
sulkily, yet unable to quarrel with the proposal, since it
was the very place to which he was going himself, and
where his comrades were assembled. In all this Pearce
had shown the judgment not to think of removing
Wheeler's suspicions by any argument or evidence. He
knew that minds heated and bewildered cannot follow
reason, and do not require it. Like huge rocking stones,
they will vibrate beneath a touch when the strongest
levers are unable to dislodge them. He walked on
steadily at his usual pace, not sorry that Wheeler should
follow, since he knew that even such a trifling circum-
stance as this had an influence upon the mind in infecting
it vith a feelirg of inferiority. At the same time he took

HAWKSTONE.
care that no occasion should be given to rouse Wheeler's
still floating suspicion that he intended to make off and
escape, in which case Pearce was sufficiently assured
that a bullet might probably follow him. He therefore
took care to look back once or twice, and ask, " Well, are
you coming ?" At a corner of the streets where it was
necessary to turn, he stopped and whistled unconcernedly,
and at another he stooped down to tie his shoe, until all
thought of his running away was removed from Wheeler's
mind. But he was scarcely prepared for Pearce's next
step. When he himself came up with him at the " Black
Lion," Pearce entered at once into the long rooma
sort of club-room, furnished with deal tables, and pipes
for smoking, and spitting-dishes, and a gorgeous appa-
ratus of a state-chair, hung with coarse tawdry red and
orange, and curiously surmounted with various devices.
The white-washed walls were ganished with mottoes and
sundry symbols of Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, and
other Christian virtues, for whose encouragement it was
generally supposed that the F. Lodge, like all the other
Lodges of the Hawkstone Odd and Even Brotherhood,
had been established, and in which its members especially
delighted. It was, in fact, one of the religious orders of
the nineteenth century, springing from the same love of
exclusiveness and sociality, bound by vows, useful in an
economical view, giving importance to the poor, and the
dignity of office to the mean. One element was omitted
-the Church. In the room were assembled a number
of pitmen in their better clothes, workmen from the
founderies, and a few better-dressed persons who seemed
strangers; and the president's chair being empty, they
had formed groups, and were severally discussing ques-
tions of politics, with looks and allusions of no very
peaceable significance. It was one,one, it may be
hoped, among the few low associations of the kind, which
had been converted into a political club, and from that
into an organized society for sedition ; and all the persons
present were privy to the designs which were in progress,
and were bound by oaths like that which had been
administered to Bentley in the mine, not only to secrecy,

but to co-operation As Pearee appeared at the door he
was hailed with loud applause. However careful the
veil which he had thrown over his personal objects, and
the separation which he had maintained between himself
and the actual operations of the gang, his influence and
importance were generally known ; and the very mystery
in which he shrouded himself heightened his conse.
quence, while all doubt of his trustworthiness was re.
moved by the command which he exercised over the
leaders. He walked therefore into the room with a firm
and even haughty step, and every one giving way as he
advanced, he took his stand at the top, by the seat which
was destined for the presiding genius of these treasonable
orgies. Wheeler followed, but with a confused and
bewildered air, and would have stepped into the seat of
authority as the president, but Pearce put his arm
before him to prevent him; and arresting him just as he
was on the step, he turned to the assemblage, and with a
rapping on the table, called their attention to what he
wished to address to them. Wheeler paused with the
restto listen. He was more than surprised, he was
astounded, by hearing Pearce, in a fluent off-handed
speech, explain to the gentlemen present the fact of the
escape of Bentley, which few were yet acquainted with,
and the manner in which he had himself been treated by
Wheeler. He then quietly appealed to two men present,
of whom one had received the message which Pearce
himself had forwarded, to apprise the gang that Villiers
and Blacker had entered the house ; the other had
received from him the communication respecting the
necessity of a reinforcement to the party. It had been
no slight part of Pearce's plan to provide himself with
these witnesses from the first, in case his treachery should
be discovered ; and the manuvre succeeded. Wheeler
stood confounded, half angry, half ashamed, yet still
upable to cast away all suspicion, so thoroughly was he
convinced of the depth and artfulness of all Pearce's
proceedings. He looked round to see what impression
had been made, and was satisfied, that although there
was a relucta ice and fear to express any feeling against

some
himself, they regarded his conduct as unjustifiable, and
Pearce's character as cleared. Pearce himself, with an
eye quick as lightning, perceived the state of their minds,
and how far he might count on their support.
Now, gentlemen," he said, after a pause, " I think
you 'll forgive me if I objected to this gentleman taking
the chair of this honorable society, of which friendship
and good-fellowship are the motto, until he had-
"Made an apology," interrupted
voice.
'Pology, 'pology," were faintly uttered by some of the
more moderate of the audience at the farther end of the
room, who sat enveloped in a cloud of tobacco-smoke;
but the demand was not taken up by that general accla-
mation which might have been expected. The men
stood in awe of Wheeler as well as of Pearce, and dared
not irritate either. In a moment Pearce caught his line.
"No," he said, "gentlemen, I want no apology.
This gentleman is your captain, and he was and is still
my friend; but I do want him, before he ascends that
chair, to tell me before you that he no longer suspects
me of wishing to injure him, or of being a traitor to your
noble cause."
" Hear, hear, hear ! hurrah! that's noblethat's just
like a gentleman!" exclaimed the whole room, relieved
from the dilemma to which they had been reduced.
"Shake hands, shake hands !" and Pearce stretch.
ing out his own hand, which Wheeler was obliged to take,
though not without a shrug of the shoulder and a look of
bitter suspicion, he lifted him into the chair, and stood
by him with much the same attitude (to compare little
things and great) with which the protector of a kingdom
might stand by the throne of an infant sovereign, whom
he was permitting to exercise the regal function.
These are little details, but human nature is the samo
in courts and cottages ; and the skill and ingenuity prac-
tised by Pearce in a pot-house, he had learnt from men
who at the same time were practicing the very same
principles in influencing the rulers of nations-rulers in
palaces, as, by the constitution of England, the members
of the F. Lodge have become its rulers in cobins.
## p. 105 (#461) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
105
" And now, gentlemen," resumed Pearce, after a
little pause, during which Wheeler was recovering his
self-importance, "I beg your pardon for intruding upon
you; and as I know you must have some weighty things
io think of, now your excellent captain, and indeed all
of you, have been brought into this jeopardy, I think I
had better withdraw,'
His words were cautiously weighed, that they might
sound as a question whether it would be better or not that
he should leave them ; and he paused for an answer.
" No, stay, stay; we shall want your advice," was
the general outcry; and Pearce did not wait to have it
repeated.
" Well, gentlemen," he said, " since you wish me to
be a looker-on, you know that, though I have business
of my own which prevents me from taking any part in
your proceedings, my heart is with you, and always will
be ; and I certainly am very much concerned that this
vile treachery should have exposed the life of your ex-
cellent captain, and indeed, I may say, the lives of all
of you, as it has. But I should think the best thing would
be to find out at once who is the traitor. Do not you
think so, captain ?" and he appealed, with an aside, to
Wheeler, who, he saw, was becoming impatient with his
interference, and uneasy to resume his own authority as
the first personage in the room. " It's not my business,'
he continued aloud, " to advise, when it would be done
so much better by your own president ; but there is a
person here, I think, who could give him some in-
formtion."
And as a cat would torment a mouse, Pearce, with
his eye looking significantly at Cookesley, who quailed,
under it, and turned as pale as ashes, asked him to tell
the captain what he knew about the matter. Cookes.
ley's heart sank within him, his lips quivered, his eyes
cowered, as he raised his head from his arms with which
he had been resting on the table, and with a supplicating
look at Pearce he endeavored to commence some stam-
mering accounts. It was not the mere sport of inflict-
ing torture, though this raised a smile and a sneer on
VOL 11.-5*

66
Pearce's hard features, but the policy of exercising power,
which induced him to drag Cookesley forward. But he
intended nothing more than to terrify the unhappy man;
and having shown what inischief he could do, to excite
his greater gratitude and dependence, by leaving bim at
last in safety. It was at once his delight and policy at
times to seize one of his unhappy dependants, and hold
him, as it were, over a precipice, threatening to drop him.
He saw, however, from Cookesley's alarm, that it would
not be safe to trifle with it, lest his unhappy victim
should betray himself. He interrupted him, therefore,
before a second word was out of his mouth.
" I think," he said, " you told me that you saw Mr.
Villiers, was it not, come into Howlas, riding with a
groom, or something of the kind ?
" Yes," said Cookesley, hesitating.
" And that, afterwards, he came down to the Horton
works, and asked you to show him over them. Was
not that right?"
Yes," faltered Cookesley, trembling for the next
question, but still hoping much from seeing that Pearce
was himself making up a story.
" And then you thought
it right to let me know what he had said to you ; that
he had been making inquiries about a gentleman who
had met with an accident, and sounded you to know if
you had heard anything about it; and said something of
a magistrate and a warrant ?"
Ay, ay," cried two of the black begrimed furnace.
men from the other end of the room. 66 We heard him
say that, didn't we?" And they appealed to each other.
"We thought there was something in the wind."
" And so did you, Mr. Cookesley, did you not, when
you thought it your duty to tell me as soon as you could ?"
said Pearce.
Cookesley, half exulting like a reprieved criminal,
half afraid, half unwilling to tell a direct lie, and bewil.
dered with the tricks of Pearce, like a fly who felt him-
self entangled in a spider's web, which yet it was too
dark to see, only ventured to assent by nodding his head.
Pearce looked round, as much as to ask if any doubt

could be entertained of the author of the mischief. lle
then engaged Wheeler, who almost growled as he turned
his head to listen to him, in a whispering conversation.
At the close of which, as if revealing the result of a con-
fidential deliberation, he said, aloud, " Your excellent
captain and I know this Mr. Villiers well ; and you
could not have a more dangerous man to deal with-
could we ?" And he turned to Wheeler, who sulkily
assented.
" Now then," Pearce suggested aside to Wheeler,
* find out who is absent."
Wheeler, scarcely recovered from his intoxication
and his passion-alarmed at the personal consequences
of Bentley's escape--cowed and disordered by the mis
take which he had made with respect to Pearce, was to
be recovered and brought up to the proper pitch of energy
necessary for the object which Pearce had in view. And
the proper mode of recovering him was to engage him
in some of the routine duties of his office. He accordingly
began to call over the names; and, in doing it, to re
sume his usual feeling of importance and determination
" Smith."
" He 's sick," answered a voice.
" Corbet."
" He's gone down to Hawkstone to see his brother."
" Connell. Where's Connell? Has any one brought
Connell with him ?" exclaimed Wheeler, furiously, as if
sure of his treachery.
" Connell, sir, I know is away at Barton Mills," said
two or three voices. " He went away at six this morn.
ing." And Wheeler looked as a bear from whom its
prey had just been torn. Four more names were called,
and an excuse given for each. Blacker's came next.
" Blacker. Mr. Blacker."
" Ha!" exclaimed Pearce, loud enough to be heard
by all the room. " Ha, Mr. Blacker! is not he here?"
he repeated ; and he put his finger to his lips, as if in
thought. " Has any one seen Mr. Blacker?"
There was no answer.
" I saw him with you," said a pitman, who knew little

of Pearce, and was therefore little daunted by his presence.
" It was about three hours ago."
" With me?" exclaimed Pearce. And his first thought
was to crush the speaker by one of his most ferocious
looks, and compel him to retract his words. But the
stout steady look with which the huge giant confronted
him, compelled him to alter his course.
" Yes," he said, " about three hours back, was it not,
at the corner of Wych Lane?"
" Yes," said the man.
" I thought at the time," said Pearce, " when he left
mne, that there was something suspicious about him. He
::eemed hurried, and said he had a job to do; and when
lie went away, he went down towards the inn."
" I saw him go into the inn myself," said a stout
Setive lad about sixteen, "and come out again with a
gentleman."
"Ha!" exclaimed both Pearce and Wheeler, as in
incert. And the former again laid his head by the side
ni the president's; and, as the prospect of discovery
opened on them, Wheeler's conference assumed a more
cordial and confidential tone.
Yes, yes," he said to Pearce. " You see, gentle.
men," he continued, speaking aloud, and to the great
satisfaction of Pearce, assuming the tone of energy which
was natural to him, 6 Blacker is a man that we have
for some time had our eye upon; he is quick enough,
and cunning, and conceited, and is always talking of
being with gentlemen, and becoming a gentleman himself.
I know that he has done as much as he could to injure me."
" And you will bear me out," subjoined Pearce, "that
he has not scrupled to tell you many falsehoods of me,

Wheeler gave nis assent, but not without a little
shrug of the shoulders. " Send after Blacker, and find
him out," cried Wheeler. But just at this instant (as if
some secret power, according to Pearce's views, was
aiding his plans,) a man came in, breathless, to say, that
he had just obtained information from another, who had
seen three policemen and a gentleman, with Blacker
himself, carrying Bentley into the inn, and that they
were all there together." There was a dead silence.
" At the inn?" whispered Pearce to Wheeler
they stay all night?"
"Do they stay all night?" repeated Wheeler, aloud,
to the informant.
"Yes, sir, I heard it from the ostler myself. There's
no chay, and the doctor has been up, and the gentle.
man has been hurt, and the sick person cannot be
moved."
"Did you hear the gentleman's name?"
" Yes, they said it was young Mr. Villiers; they 'd
heard it from the keeper there, down in the park, who is
come with them."
The discovery was complete; the whole assembly
seemed thunderstruck. Pipes were laid down; half
tasted pots of beer were removed from the lips; eyes
were turned on each other; and, to the great delight of
Pearce, Wheeler jumped up from his seat with a violent
imprecation, and swore that he would have his revenge.
" You are sure," said Pearce again, aloud, to the last
informant, " that they stay all night? Is Blacker at the
inn?"
" Yes, sir."
There was a pause.

You could not have a man against you who would do you
more deadly mischief than young Villiers. I know him
well. He is almost the only man I should ever be afraid
of, except, perhaps, your own captain, when his nerve is
up."

he should do.

as if carelessly:
" Four or five hundred," was the answer.
" Four or five hundred !" exclaimed Wheeler, fiercely:
" there are four or five thousand-yes, double and treble
the numberwho are with us good men and strong.
Why, this moment, in this town, there are five hundred
who would follow me the moment I gave the word, are
there not?"
And "Yes, yes, follow you, captain, anywhere," was
the shout in reply.
Pearce stretched across, and whispered to Wheeler,
" Did they say, follow you to the inn?"
" Yes," exclaimed Wheeler, fiercely and aloud," to
the inn, or anywhere : wouldn't you, my boys ?"
The words were no sooner uttered than " The inn,

the idea suggested, and Pearce, preserving his counte.
nance in its usual impassive coldness, secretly hugged
himself in triumph.

quising aloud.
" He is quite right : just like himself.
Strike while the iron 's hot. What a fine body of fellows !
and what a man to head them! There's plenty of time!"
And he took out his watch to look at it. He knew that
many mindsmost minds-in moments of indecision,
may be fixed in any resolution by taking it for granted
that the resolution is made alreadyminds that never
like to retreat, or to be suspected of retreating, from any
step on which they have once decided. Wheeler was
cine of this class.

" You'll form," said Pearce, "in three bodies, I
suppose, and attack them at once. Will you fire any
rockets, to let the people in Blackmore know what you
are doing?"
Wheeler pushed him aside. " You are a very clever
man, Mr. Pearce; but I suspect we know better how to
manage these things than you do. We have gentlemen
who have served in the army themselves. Leave us, if
you please, to manage our own concerns."
Pearce received the repulse with the same satisfaction
with which the hand experiences the recoil of a spring
which it is testing to see if it will break. He thought,
however, that a little irritation was no bad mode of con.
firming his instrument in his resolution, and putting him
wholly on his mettle by affecting a little distrust.
6 Would it not be as well," he whispered again,
while Wheeler was busy in giving some orders to one
of the men (he chose the moment on purpose)" would
it not be as well to send round to the works, and get the
men together?"
Wheeler uttered a tremendous oath.
" Confound your interference, sir : am I not doing
the very thing? I wish you would stick to your own
business. I conclude we shall see nothing of you to-
night." And he looked round on Pearce with ineffable
scorn.
Pearce was perfectly satisfied. The men had jumped
up from their seats, and the whole room was in confusion.
Wheeler had called to him three of the stoutest and most
intelligent of the party, and was engaged in giving them
directions. His whole energy was aroused, and he spoke
and acted with a spirit and judgnent worthy of a better
cause, and worthy of the Nationl School, in which his
intellect had been so sharpened and prepared: and just
as he rose up in his chair to make a short but violent
speech to his comrades, Pearce quietly took his hat, and
slipped out of the room. At the door he beckoned a
rough bloated miner to him, and telling him that having
disturbed their meeting, he was bound to leave something
to make them meriy, he put into their hands enough

'teenth century usually do retire, when fighting is about
to commence.
Only one thing remained. He had fired the train,
which he was assured would terminate in the required
explosion ; but with that explosion it was probable that
he should be compelled to remove from the district.
Wheeler himself might be destroyed or driven away,
and with him the chance be lost of recovering the mys-
terious papers. How often did he reproach himself for
having once permitted him to see them! Upon no other
part of his proceedings could he fix the imputation of
being what, with the French diplomatist, he considered
worse than a crimea blunder; and yet, he thought to
himself, it was necessary to explain to him about the
boy. I could never have gained command over him
without showing him some confidence; and if he has
played me false, why (he chuckled as he muttered) it is
only what I have done to him! He despaired of recover.
ing the documents by any influence of persuasion ; he
had tried this in every shape : but Wheeler, though not
aware of all the value attached to them, saw by Pearce's
frequent recurrence to the subject, that they were of
great moment. Himself quick, intelligent, and aspiring,
he growled impatiently under the superiority which
Pearce assumed over him. Before he would consent to
entrust him with any of his own secrets, he had insisted
on being admitted into some of his partner's; and Pearce
had been compelled to show him something which might
explain the nature of his own proceedings, and account
for the mystery attending them, and for his refusal to take
an active part in the more general conspiracy. But
instead of removing distrust, the knowledge thus obtained
had only increased it. Wheeler saw the real nature ou
Pearce's character, and kept his eye fixed on all his
movements, as upon u snarling dog which might at any
hour turn on him and rend him; and nothing but the

113
money with which Pearce supplied him, could have pre-
served the continuance of their connection. He had
taken advantage of a careless moment in which Pearce,
not then sufficiently aware of his cunning, had left the
papers in his possession, to secrete them, and pretend that
they were lost. At one time he had even thought of
making use of them himself; but they were comparatively
valueless without further information, which none but
Pearce possessed; and he was too deeply involved in
the turbulent conspiracy of the district, and too deeply in
the power of Pearce, to venture on such a step. All that
he could do was to retain them in his own hands, as a
sort of hostage or balance-weight, to preserve the equi.
librium of their mutual suspicion. And the more effectu.
ally to prevent Pearce from recovering them, he had
shifted his lodgings; and when it was necessary to meet,
they had met at another public-house.
In this critical moment Pearce was resolved to make
one more attempt. He contrived without difficulty to
find out Wheeler's lodgings ; easily obtained admittance
to his room, on leaving the Black Lion, on pretence of
wishing to see him ; looked round on the closets and
places in the miserable garret, for it was nothing more,
in which the treasure might be concealed; and fixed his
eyes especially on a deal box, closely locked and corded,
in which all Wheeler's little property was contained, with
many other papers of no little importance, besides the
packet in question. He would have been tempted not to
lose the opportunity, but to search at once ; but while his
eyes were furtively seeking for some means of opening
the box, he heard voices in the street, and had only just
time to hurry down stairs, and to meet Wheeler
himself, and, as they were styled, three of his officers
with him. Wheeler looked at him with surprise and
suspicion, but was too full of other things to attend
to him.
" They told me," said Pearce, "that I should find
you
at Blacker's lodgings. Is not this Blacker's lodgings ?"
" No!" exclaim:d Wheeler, with an oath.
"I wanted to remind you," suid Pearce, " that a troop

of dragoons came yesterday to Hakewell Barracks; so
you had better make haste."
" Fool!" exclaimed Wheeler, "to think, we do not
know that!"
And Pearce, having lulled all his suspicions, once
more went his way. He proceeded first to his own room,
where he provided himself with certain cunning instru.
ments, by which he was able to open any lock without
detection ; and then he waited patiently at his window,
listening to catch any sound which might break the still.

E may now return to the inn-door, which Villiers,
startled by the ringing, had hastened down to open.
His anticipation of its cause was too well founded.
The superintendent of police, with two of his men, met
him in the passage ; and a few words were sufficient to
apprise him that the pitmen were mustering their forces,
and that an attack might be apprehended on the inn.
Villiers's first thought was the possibility of transferring
Bentley to some place of safety.
"Was there any
mode of quitting the town?" But the policemen nega-
ived it at once. Scouts had been posted on all the
roads, and round the inn ; and retreat was hopeless
without discovery.
" No, sir," said the superintendent ; 66 if the attack is
made, we must meet it here."
Villiers asked the number of the assailants.
Brown, the superintendent, shook his head. He had
learned that the workmen in nearly all the works were
gathering. They were a sturdy, desperate and ferocious
class, long banded together in a general conspiracy, and
well armed, if not with firearms, at least with weapons
still more formidable for close combathe weapons of

So on.
their own labor ; and, what was still more alarming,
there were among them men who had served in the army,
and were well acquainted with the best mode of planning
an attack.
6 And how much time have we," said Villiers, " to
prepare for receiving them?
"I do not think," said Brown, " that we have mo...
than half an hour. The men from the Binley aud Powhan
works cannot join them in less than that. And it is late ;
and they have had to wake them up."
"Half an hour," said Villiers, " well employed, will
do much. Call up every one in the house. Stop-
not there!" he cried to the man who was hurrying to
the first door on the stairs, "not there ; that's Mr. Bentley's
Do not disturb him till till the last moment. How
many men are there with you, Mr. Brown ?"
"We have but eight, sir. One of them I have sent
up to Mr. Jackson's, to see if he can muster any assistance
among the better sort of people,the shopkeepers, and
But they are a cowardly set; and I have no great
reliance upon them, even if we could swear them in as
constables. They think of nothing but making money ;
and making money is not the best school for learning to
fight for anything, even for their lives."
"Are there any military anywhere in the neighbor-
hood ?" asked Villiers.
" Thank goodness, sir ! was the answer ; a troop
of dragoons arrived yesterday at Hakewell Barracks;
but that is ten miles off. One of my men is dispatched
for them; but he will have to cross the mountain ; and
the road is bad, even if he manages to get there.
"Let us have no if's, Mr. Brown," said Villiers.
" When we have to fight in a good cause, we must
feel sure that all things will turn out well. There
must be no doubting. How long, then, shall we have to
hold out?"
" Allow three hours," said Brown.
" Allow four," said Villiers, "that we may not be
disappointed. Always give time, and prepare for the
worst at once. And ow for our defence."

By this time the terrified inmates of the house had
been roused from their sleep; and, half-dressed--some
shoelesssome with their nightcaps onsome stagger-
ing under the dizziness of fresh-broken dreamsand all
open-mouthed with fright and wonder,were assembled
in the bar and the passage.
There was the landlord, a
stout, hearty Englishman, and his wife, with one maid,
and the ostler, and boots : both of whom appeared to
Villiers's searching eye as men who would stand by him,
and who could be trusted. No stranger was in the
house but a bagman, or, as he would rather be entitled,
a commercial gentleman, who came trembling down the
stairs, with one hand holding up the lower part of his
attire, and with the other dragging after him a heavy
portmanteau. In a very few words Villiers explained to
them the facts of the case ; and insisted that the women
should be immediately conveyed to a place of safety, and
that any others who liked it should retire also.
" We must have none with us," he said aside to
Brown, " but those who are with us in heart, and will
stand by us."
The landlord was the first who answered. He was
the son of an old tenant on the Villiers estate, had served
in the yeomanry himself, and still retained his yeomanry
equipments. " As sure, sir," he exclaimed,
as my
name is Bonsor, I do not leave this house while you and
the sick gentleman are in it! I've heard of Mr. Bent-
ley many a time. He always did what he could for the
poor; and I'll stand by him to the last ; and by you, sir,
for Lady Esther's sake."
Mrs. Bonsor listened to her husband, and then de.
clared her intention of remaining also.
She had full
confidence in her husband's martial qualities, and espe-
cially in his yeomanry accoutrements : she would not
be driven out of her house by any set of ragamuffins.
Besides, there was all the tea and the sugar, and the
larder; and the rum and shrub in the bar; and the tea.

china bowl-the very pride and treasure of her life,

self in her great chair, and declared that nothing should
make her afraid, The poor maid trembled like an as-
pen leaf; but the landlady bade her take courage ; and
she also announced her wish to remain with her mis-

shovel, and vowed that they would stand by the Blake

jured ; and they did not care a straw for all the pitmen
in the forest.
Villiers thanked them all in a manner which made
them more than ever firm in their resolution to stand by
him. He promised that their services should not be lost
sight of; and encouraged them by explaining that he
was himself an officer in the army, and had fought in
sieges and battles before. But in the midst of his little
address he was nearly pushed forward by some
creeping behind him, and striving to reach the door. It
was the terrified bagman.
" I'll thank you, gentlemen, if you please, to let me
out. I'm only a lodger, you know;" und he affecied a
laugh, which fear converted into a hiccup. "I think it
better to go to the Swan. Good night, gentlemen; I
hope you won't be hurt. Here, boots, will

"Money, sir, again," said Brown to Villiers. "Money

their soul is always in their pocket."
It was, however, no time for philosophising-an oc-
cupation of which Mr. Brown, in his vocation, was ex.
tremely fond. Villiers, who, while he was in the army,
had devoted himself with zeal to his profession, and

studied it thoroughly, cast his eyes round the little garri
son which he was now to maintain ; and with that quick
sagacity which indolent men call genius, and wise men
know to be the fruit of patient study and a well-discip-
lined mind, he fixed on the whole plan of defence. The
house was a double one, thrown back from the street,
and connected with the two rows of houses on each side
by a wall which formed a little recess, enclosing three
sides of an open gravelled space.
"Get some pickaxes," Villiers cried to the ostler
and the boots ;  knock some holes in these walls for our
muskets; we can command and sweep the whole front
of the house from these: and here we must take our
first stand. Mrs. Bonsor, will you have the goodness,
with your maid, to bring down as many feather-beds and
mattrasses as you can, and place them against the win-
dows in these two front parlors ; and then pile up all
the loose chairs and tables and drawers, anything you
can lay hands on in the passage here, as well as in the
We are tolerably safe behind, are we not ?"
Brown consulted with the landlord, and found that the
stable-yard at the back was surrounded pretty nearly on
all sides by stables, coach-houses, and other out-buildings,
except the gate, which led into the garden, and through
the garden into the fields. But this was perfectly ex-
posed.
" It may be," said Bonsor, "that they may not come
round, or think of this. We must trust this to Provi.
dence,"
No," said Villiers ; we will trust to Providence all
that is beyond our own resources, but we have no au.
thority for trusting anything to it which we can do our-
selves. Keeper, when they come up, station yourself in
that loftit commands all the garden, and shoot the first
man whom you see coming in that direction."
" Hollo !" cried the landlord at this moment ; " my
boys! I had forgotten you." And two stout hearty
boys, about fourteen and fifteen, who had been overlooked
in the general rousing, now joined the party, half in
wonder, and still more in delight, at the prospect, as they

"Boys," cried Villiers, "here is your work. Do
you see that heap of paving-stones? Carry as many as
you can up to the upper rooms. Quick ! and do not get
in the way of your mother. Mr. Brown, your other
men should be here by this time ; you say they have
plenty of ammunition."
" We have ten muskets, sir," was the answer ;
" besides some sabres, which belonged to the militia ;
and, luckily, the cartridges, which were intended for the
soldiers, I wrote for, came on Thursday."
" Why, sir," said Bonsor, " there's a little barrel of
gunpowder in my cellar, which Mr. Jackson asked me
to take care of for him for a few days, and that will stand
us in some stead."
By this time the other policemen had arrived, and
brought with them the necessary resources.
"You have your own yeomanry arms, Mr. Bonsor,"
said Villiers.
66 Yes, sir."
" Bevan--you, I know, will not like to take a mus.
ket; but you can be of great use to me if you do not
mind danger; you can be my aide-de-camp, and carry
my messages.
And Bevan gladly consented to take a post which
would employ him usefully, without compelling him to
shed blood.

hands the great china bowl from the exposure of the bar
into the cellar.
" We must have this filled with punch," he said,
laughingly, to the good lady, " when we have sent these
fellows back to their pits, and must all drink your good
health in it. I do not know what garrisons would do
without ladies to help them."
And the comfortable landlady, pleased with the com-
pliment from such a nice gentleman, continued to bustle
about with redoubled activity.
"My .poor girl, what is the matter with you ?" he
asked Mary, the housemaid, who, having finished her
task, was beginning to reflect on the approaching danger,
with the tears coming into her eyes. "Why, you have
never been in a siege before, as I have ; it will be a
feather in your cap as long as you live. See, you have
not piled up these things properly ; just help me to move

upon the other, so that if any one attempts to climb over
them he may tumble head foremost into them. Remem.
ber, the next time you are besieged, that light things of
that kind are far better to blockade a passage
than heavy
tables."
"Oh! sir, I hope I shall never be sieged again ?"
was the poor girl's reply. And she would have burst
into an hysteric sobbing, but Villiers, without pretending
to notice it, sent her off with his compliments to her
mistress, to beg that she would provide immediately the
best supper she possibly could in the bar.
excellent round of beef there," he said; " and you
had
better put hot water on the fire. And Mr. Bonsor, you
will produce us, I hope, the very best bottles that you
have in your cellar. We may want them," he said
aside to Brown, "full as much as the little barrel of
something else which it fortunately contains. Charles
X. lost his throne by forgetting that his troops could not
fight without eating ; and I believe that the greatest man
in this day, when a popular tumult is expected in London,
always commences operations by victualling the billets
of the soldiers. And now," he turned to Bevan, " will

in case we are driven from our outposts." He looked at
huis watch. " We have no time, my men, to spare."
And, all setting their shoulders to the work, the bar.
ricade was soon completed.
"And now," said Villiers, as he went from room to
room with the superintendent, examining the preparations,
" I think we have done all that we could."
" And the rest ?" said the superintendent.
" The rest," interrupted Villiers, "is in the hands of
the Almighty; and to him we must commit it.

care they do not become intoxicated.''
" The women are the worst part of the thing," said
Brown.
" I am not sure," replied Villiers. "Occupy them,
make them take a part in what we have to do, prevent
them from sitting down and working themselves into
hysterics, and women may form a most valuable part of
a garrison. I do not think, in the present state of Eng-
land, that Englishwomen must be exempt from facing
such perils as these."
"Very true, indeed, sir," replied the superintendent,
and he added the reflection as an acquisition to his phi-
losophical lucubrations, to be produced on the first oppor-
tunity. He would, indeed, have followed it up by some
additional morality of his own, but Mary came to say
that the supper was ready; and all the little garrison
being summoned together, they sat down to a table gar-
nished with all the delicacies of Mrs. Bonsor's larder,
the richly inlaid round of beef occupying the centre,
and the extremities groaning under a brown-powdered
uncut ham and a cold pie, on which the recreant bagman

ing, with a hearty relish, to resume his attack in the
morning.
"I must quarrel with you, my good Mrs. Bonsor,
said Villiers to his landlady, who, busy and cheered with
the duties of her vocation, had almost forgotten why they
were assembled. " But you do not treat us to any silver
spoons. I hope you have not put away your plate, as if
there was any chance of its falling into the enemy's hands.
With such a gallant little army, and such a defender as
Mr. Bonsor there, I hope it has never crossed your mind
that they will ever penetrate into your bar."
And Mrs. Bonsor, looking with matronly pride at her
husband, who had arrayed himself in his yeomanry
dress
and grasped his yeomanry sword, declared that she
had do fear whatever-only she had indeed put the
spoons into a drawer, from which she proceeded to re-
store them.
"I hope," said Villiers, " you have plenty of hot
water. I have known a house gallantly defended with
boiling kettles."
"Bless you, sir," said the landlady, we are brewing
this very night, and there's a supply of hot stuff enough
for a regiment."
" Well, then," replied Villiers, " we must trust this
to
you, and Mary, and the boys. Have you
all
your paving-stones, my lads ?"
And the boys laughed, and promised to take a good
rim from the upper windows.
Cold, reserved, haughty as Villiers was thought by
those who only saw him in very general society, and
proud as he certainly was by nature, in the present cir-
cumstances, he threw it off entirely. He was animated,
lively, not affable--for that implies condescension, but just
sufficiently familiar with the whole party, down to the
ostler himself, to please, assure, encourage, and confirm
them in their resolution to stand by him to the last, as
the finest and nicest gentleman they ever saw.

cheerful and merry, and almost to doubt if the whole was
not a faise alarm, he left Mr. Brown recounting stories
of bravos defences made by small bodies against large

question.
" You have seen Bentley," he said, " and prepared

" Had you any opportunity - did you allude-
could you satisfy yourself on that dreadful point ?
Was there any truth in that man's frightful tale, or is
it a calumny?"
" A calumnyit is wholly false," replied Bevan. "I
spoke to him openly : he told me enough to satisfy my
mind completely, though he is bound to say no more.
I
will answer for his innocence."
" Thank Heaven!" repeated Villiers, fervently.
" Now I can fight for him with comfort."
He entered the room, and Bentley endeavored to
raise himself from his pillow, but fell back, and could only
take his hand and press it to his lips.
66 You have saved
my life," he said, faintly, "thus far; and the Almighty
will enable you now to save it wholly, if it is His good
pleasure. Would that I could help you ! but I am
powerless.'
" Not powerless," said Villiers. 66 Our time must be
occupied with other things ; but you can pray for us.
" Yes," said Bentley, faintly, "I have done so.
will do so.
It is wonderful how calm and resigned I feel.
( have no fear.
" Nor have I," said Bevan ; " but it will be a comfort
to have prayed together." And with Villiers kneeling
at his side, Bevan took his Prayer-book from his pocket.

HAWKSTONE.
" Read the Confession," whispered Villiers, "and
the Absolution. This may be our last hour. "
" Are you ill ?" said Bevan to him, in alarm as he
came to the end of the Confession ; for Villiers was
kneeling unsupported, but nearly drooping to the ground
-his arms folded across his bosom--bis face buried in
his hands-his whole attitude that of a man sinking
beneath an intolerable load.
" No, no, go on.
And as Bevan closed the Absolution, Villiers had
once more raised himself. His voice joined calmly,
almost joyfully, in the Lord's Prayer. His lips moved
with every petition which Bevan read from the Psalms,
as most suited to their fearful situation ; for Villiers
never rose in the morning, without committing a psalm,
or a portion of it, to heart, as he was dressing.
"Read," he whispered to Bevan, " the Thanksgiving,
for we have much as yot to be thankful for. Read the
prayer for all conditions of men, for we must pray for
those who are with us, who may be called, like ourselves,
before our Maker, suddenly."
But there was no time to do more. A sound, hollow,
deep, and swelling, like the muttering which precedes
an earthquake, struck upon their ears. It was the tramp
of feet, measured, firm, numberless, as of a host. Bevan
calmly gave them the blessing, and they both rose from
their knees. Bentley stretched out his hand once more,
and uttered a fervent prayer for them.
" They are coming," he said.
6. God bless you.
Go to your posts, and Jo not think of me,-only save
yourselves."
They were indeed coming. Villiers had scarcely
time to return to the room where his little garrison was
assembled, to address to them a few words reminding
them of their duty to their Sovereign, and encouraging
them by the prospect of assistance, and still more by the
rectitude of their cause, and the never-failing protection
of Providence, when the assailants, in three regular
columns, issued, without uttering a word, from the three
streets which opened in front of the inn, and drew them.

selves up in a thick mass. As Villiers looked out from
a bow window in which he had stationed himself, he had
expected to see a mob-a promiscuous, irregular, un-
disciplined multitude, whom it would be easy to baffle
and defeat by the exercise of a little prudence and firm-
ness ; but he was startled to see the order with which
they marched, halted at the word of command, and drew
themselves up almost in a military line. He was not
aware how long the movement now made had been
ripening under very expert instructors, and how much
education had done to infuse discipline and order even
into a seditious movement, by inculcating a due regard
to an enlightened self-interest and intelligence. They
had no sooner reached the ground than the silence which
they had observed during their approach was broken by
a tremendous shout, which fairly overthrew poor Mrs.
Bonsor as she was removing her tea-spoons again to a
place of security, and extorted a shriek from poor Mary
which went to Villiers's heart.
" My dear Bevan," he said, " go to those poor women,
and comfort them. Make them do something. Tell
them to get linen, to scrape lint, to boil water, to do any.
thing ; only do not let them remain unoccupied. I can
stand any moh, but I cannot stand a woman's shriek."
In the meanwhile, from the dark ferocious mass of
heads now ranged in front of the inn, came forward a
single person who seemed to act as their leader. It was,
in fact, Wheeler himself ; and calling loudly for the
landlord by name, he summoned him to give up to them
the party whom he was harboring in his house. Bonsor,
with the honest indignation of an Englishman, would
willingly have faced them, and bade them do their worst,
but Villiers held him back.
"No, my good friend," he said, " I am the person
who has brought you into this jeopardy, and it is fair that
I should meet it."
Accordingly he threw up the sash, and, standing
before them, unshrinkingly declared that he himself was
one of the persons whom they were seekirg, and warneu
them, in the Sovereign's na ne, to withdraw. "Mis-

guided as you are," he said, " you are come here to add
crime to crime. You have endeavored to secrete and
confine a person who never injured you, and never
intended to injure you ; and because he has exercised the
right of an Englishman to escape, you now come to vio.
late the laws, and to risk the lives of yourselves and
others. "I warn you to retire in time. At present,
whatever offences have been committed, neither your
names nor your persons are known. That gentleman
whom
you have so unworthily treated knows nothing of
your secrets, and has no intention of betraying them.
He has bound himself by a solemn promise not to do so ;
and in pursuance of that promise he has concealed, even
from me, the circumstances which placed him in your
hands. He is a man, as you ought to know, whose life
is spent in providing for the wants of the poor in
your own
neighborhood; and this is the return which he meets
from Englishmen!"
" Tell them," said Brown, who was standing by his
elbow, " that we are armed, and will shoot the first man
who approaches."
"No, not yet," replied Villiers. "Do not speak of
force till all other words have failed. It is the last thing
of which a mob should be reminded."
And, in fact, the quietness, firmness, and coolness of
his manner, the fluency and feeling with which he
addressed them, and especially his declaration that their
secrets were as yet undivulged, produced an obvious
effect. A wavering and hesitation was observable-
among the mass of heads; and even Wheeler himself
retired to consult with his lieutenants.
" And who are you?" exclaimed a voice from the
crowd.
"I am Mr. Villiers," replied Villiers.
neighbor, who hopes to spend many years in your
neighborhood, and to do you all the good in my power;
but who am shocked and astonished, on my return to
England, to find that Englishmen can so far forget
themselves as to be guilty of such outrages as these.
But it is a satisfaction to remain ignorant of the real

127
authors of them. And such a scene as this I trust never
to witness again."
He proceeded in the same kind but firm manner to
address them at much greater length. It was one of his
first objects to gain time ; and he knew how easily an
English, or indeed any, mob, are led and influenced by a
good speaker. Nor was he disappointed. They listened
to him with less and less unwillingness. "He's a bold
chap,""Is n't he a fine speaker ?""Well, I will
say, he's a man of mettle,""I do n't think he's so
bad, afier all,"were remarks which he caught at
intervals; and it is not impossible but that his eloquence
might have been successful, had not a figure, who had
hitherto kept entirely in the background, hidden under
the houses, now crept up, and mixed with the outlying
stragglers, who were unable to hear what was said.
" Hoot him," said the figure to a boy. 66 Hiss him.
Why do n't you hoot and hiss ?"
" Hoot him," yelled out the boy. " Hoot him, hoot
him," joined his neighbors. And the clamor once
commenced, in a few moments the contagion seized the
whole body, and a din and roar arose which drowned all
that Villiers would have uttered. He saw that the
ground was cut from under his feet. He made signs,
but in vain, though he continued to stand firm and un.
moved, waiting for an opportunity of obtaining another
hearing. Even a mob cannot hoot for ever; and though
the favorable feeling was extinguished for the time by
the physical excitement which had been raised against
him, he might once more have gained an audience, but
the saine figure in the background, who had looked at
his watch, and seemed impatient of delay, once more
crept into the crowd.
"Why do you not have a fling at him?" he said to
the same boy whom he had addressed before. " Here's
a stone."
And Villiers the next instant heard the pane of glass
above his head shiver into atoms. It was like the single
big drop which brings down the whole torrent of the
thunder-storm. No sooner was the sound heard than

there aruse from the dense mass of heads a yell twice as
fearful as before. " Down with him! down with him!"
was the cry; and a volley of stones followed which
shattered every window in the front of the house. Vil
liers saw that all was over. He had been struck on the
head with a flint, and his face was bleeding.
Shall we fire?" asked one of the men, impatiently.
" No, no," said Villiers, "remember my orders,
Let us wait for some more deadly manifestation before
we take life. Are all your men at their post, Mr.
Brown?"
" Yes, sir.
Wait, then, till I have spoken to the mob once

more.
And, taking advantage of a momentary lull, Villiers
admonished them again, in the Sovereign's name, to
withdraw. " I warn you now," he said, " that we are
well armed--thoroughly prepared to shoot the first man
that proposes to enter the house ; and I call Heaven to
witness, that if you still persist in this outrage, your blood
is on your own head."
Before he could finish the sentence, a pistol was fired
from the crowd-no one ever knew by whom-and a ball
whizzed past Villiers, and grazed his ear.
"Now, then," he said to Brown, " all of you to your
posts !" He drew his head within the window, closed
down the sash, and begged Bevan to put up the mattresses
against it again, so as to leave a space from which, with
his own pistols, he could command the entrance.
the only window in the house where this was possible.
" Now go to the side walls. Charge the men to keep
their fire, as I have ordered, and on no account to fire
promiscuously, where they may hurt women or children.
Ask Mrs. Bonsor to come to me; it will initiate her in
her duties to put a little lint on this hurt, which is a mere
trifle." It was done chiefly to relieve her mind by
giving her soine occupation; and the poor woman was
roused from the stupor of terror into which she had fallen,
and began to bustle about, with Mary, for lint and rags,
pleased with the thought of being useful, and relieved

from much of her apprehension for the future by finding
that the first wound was of so little moment. Mean-
while, the firing of the pistol was the signal for the first
attack. Twelve huge savage foundrymen, each wielding
an enormous crowbar, with which they break open their
furnaces, detached themselves from the front of the mob,
and advanced to the door. Two blows were levelled on
it, but failed to demolish it ; but as the third man was
poising his bar, and levelling it against the lock, eight
tongues of Alame leaped out of the side walls, amidst a
volume of smoke and the discharge of musketry. The
smoke cleared off. Six of the ringleaders were lying
dead upon the ground; two others had been wounded;
and, amidst a yell, partly of terror and surprise, and partly
of fury, the whole mass of assailants had recoiled, and left
the space in front of the inn quite clear.
CHAPTER IX.
"I will make one more effort," said Villiers, gazing
from the window on the sad sight beneath him.
" They
have obeyed me well-have singled out the ringleaders,
and marked them. It may be, Heaven will still touch
their hearts, and we may be spared more of this fright.
ful bloodshed." He threw up the window again, and
endeavored to make himself heard. But the moment
he appeared the uproar became terrific : several shots
were fired at him, amidst a volley of stones; and Bevan
dragged him back into the room.
" It is hopeless," he said. 66 When blood has once
been shed, a mob becomes a monster of ferocity. The
battle must be fought out. Bear me witness that I have
done all in my power to spare life."
He had no time, however, to say more.
The as.

selves in a dense column, they rushed, with a hideous

cry, up to the front of the house. Once more the fire
from the flanking walls opened upon them, and every
shot told : Villiers himself, from his post at the window,
fixed upon the most conspicuous of the assailants, and
his aim rarely missed. From the attics the boys hurled
down their paving-stones upon a
mass of heads on
which every missile did execution. The women them.
selves, kindled with the excitement, now joined in the
defence; and, arming themselves with kettles of boiling
water, and pails of scalding liquor from the brew-house,
poured them upon the eyes and faces of the pitmen, till
they shrieked with agony. Body after body fell, and
was trampled on by the advancing column, who, un-
touched as yet by the fire of the musketry, were not
aware of the danger of approaching till they were close
to the house, and there, excluded from retreat, aimed
their ineffectual blows at the doors and windows, and
then sank, and were trodden down in a mass of carnage.
Pressed and jammed together, they were unable to use
their arms, or receive orders. In vain Wheeler and
others in command endeavored to make the advancing
body recede, that there might be scope for a more regu.
lar attack. Everything was confusion and uproar ;
howlings of the wounded and dying; shriekings and hor.
rible imprecations, as the torrents of boiling stuff were
poured suddenly on their upturned faces; blasphemous
outcries, which none but demons would have uttered;
and, rising above all
, threats of the most horrible ven-
geance against Villiers and all around him. At last
their efforts succeeded. The pannels of the door were
smashed to atoms; the windows--the shuttersframe-
work,all were demolished. A breach, it secmed, was
made into the house ; but, to the disappointment of the
attackers, both the passage and the rooms had been so
filled with mattresses, drawers, and chests, and light
chairs, piled up to the ceiling, over which it was impos.
sible to climb, that they were as far removed from their
object as at first. Wheeler himself, furious when he
found himself thus baffled, at last succeeded in forcing
his men back from an unavailing attempt, in which life

After life was sacrificed without their being able to touch
the defenders of the little fortress. Once more the mass
recoiled ; the space before the house was cleared; and
as Villiers jooked down upon it again, now piled with
corpses and heaps of mutilated and wounded bodies
groaning with pain, the clock struck four. Two hours
were past of the four on which he had calculated to hold
out. There was a pause-a silence as awful as the
dead, breathless calm between the bursts of a hurricane.
And Villiers sank into a chair, and burst into a flood of
tears.
Bevan stood by him, with mingled compassion and
admiration, but left the feeling to find vent, without at-
tempting to check it.
" Leave me," said Villiers, " for two minutes to my-
self. Go, if you are not worn out, and see that the men
have refreshments. Send Mr. Brown and Bonsor to
me; and let me know if any one has been hurt."
Bevan hastened on his commission, and Villiers fas.
tened the door, and knelt down to calm and recover
himself, and ask for guidance. He knew that the wory.

otherwise. He came, in high spirits, to congratulate
and thank Villiers, as if all was achieved. But his
courage was considerably damped by hearing the opin-
ion of the superintendent, that another attack would
take place. "If," said he, "they had been a mere com-
mon mob, without object or order, they would have given
it up long since. But there is more mischief in them
than I thought."
"Do you remember," said Bevan to Villiers, " the
young lion we spoke of? Bear or tiger would be the
more proper name.
But this is the monster that England
has been nurturing with her manufacturing system, and
instructing in her alphabet; and even now it is not full
grown."
At this moment the keeper came in. He also
thought the battle was won. " Blacker," he said, " had
come to him, and asked to change posts with him, as he
lid not like. if he could help it, to fire upon his old

friends. And he was accordingly stationed in the loft,
to watch the garden gate. Was it necessary for hiin to
remain there longer ?"
- Absolutely necessary," said Villiers. " You will
observe the enemy have not retreated ; they have
screened themselves behind the houses, but they are still
in full force ; and if they have with them men who know
anything of their business, their next attempt will be
upon the stable-yard, since they cannot get into the house
in the front. Do you think it possible, Mr. Brown, for
us to hold good the side walls, if they attempt to scale
them ?"
Brown thought for a minute, and shook his head.
" We must try," he said ; " but, with their number, I
loubt."
"No one has been hurt yet ?" asked Villiers.
" None.'
66 Have the men had their refreshment?"
60 Yes."
" How are the poor women ?"
Bevan said that he had taken them for the present
into Bentley's room, and comforted them; and that
Bentley himself was now speaking to them ; but that
they were in a sad state. Villiers then gave his orders,
and having placed Bonsor to occupy his post at the bow.
window, he prepared to place himself at the head of
the little garrison in the yard. It was now the post of
danger. He had been perfectly right in his conjecture.
Grady, a savage-looking Irishman, who had been a pri.
rate in the life-guards, and flogged out of the regiment
for repeated drunkenness, was at the head of one of the
columns, and he now insisted on directing the attack
upon
the side walls. "Silence those muskets," he said,
" and the day is ours."
Wheeler himself saw the wisdom of the advice ;
and, though their numbers were thinned, and not a few
had stolen away in despair, it was resolved to adopt it.
Villiers was looking from the window on the heap of
unangled bodies, among which two haggard miserable
women, who had forced their way through the assail.

66 You are
ants, were now searching, with piercing cries, for a son
and a husband whom they missed. He thought of ma-
king an effort to persuade the pitmen at least to remove
their wounded under a promise that they should not be
fired on during the removal. But Brown interfered.
" These men," he said, "know nothing of such
things. They have no trust, and no faith, and no pity ;
and you must leave them to themselves. Hark, sir, hark!
There's no time to be lost. Do you not hear a tramp?
They are coming. Hark!"
And listening, they caught distinctly the sound of a
large body of men approaching.
" It's the soldiers," cried the sanguine Bonsor ; " you
can hear their tread."
" The soldiers," repeated Bevan, o the soldiers !"
and he was hastening off, with the joyful tidings to Bent.

"Stop," cried Villiers, catching his arm.
not sure.
Listen to that shout! Those are not cheers
of defiance."
It was too true. The same dark figure which had so
frequently before stolen into the outskirts of the crowd,
and directed their movements unperceived, when he saw
the determined resistance of the little garrison, had has-
tened to a hut which stood on the top of an eminence over
the town. From this four rockets shot up, which were
answered from Pendeen hill, about three miles distant,
on the side of which lay the great Brocas works; and
the hurrah of the assailants now hailed the arrival of a
strong reinforcement from that quarter. Only a few
moments of suspense were given; but even those mo.
ments were as hours. Villiers alone remained calm.
you all ready ?" he said. " Remember, if we
cannot make good the line of wall, we retire into the
house, without risk."
Make haste," cried Brown ; "they're coming."
And as they hurried down the stairs, the whole mass
of assailants rushed, with horrible yells, into the little
square. Instead of attempting the house, they divided
themselves, as Villiers l'ad suspected, into two bodies ;
66 Are

and, provided with such means as they had been able to
seize, they threw themselves on each other's shoulders,
and proceeded to scale both the walls at once. Wave
followed on wave. The openings made in the inass by
the fire from the loop-holes were filled up, as if none had
fallen. Heads, shoulders, whole bodies appeared on the
summit of the wall along the whole line--some hanging
lifeless across it, as they fell under the bayonets of the
besieged ; others thrust forward by the advancing mass,
and thrown headlong into the court; others dropping
down in the intervals between the line of defenders.
The struggle was fearful. But Villiers saw that it was
hopeless ; and while it was yet possible to give the sig-
nal for retreat, they mustered at the back door of the inn,
and halted. One man only was missing : it was Blacker.
" He's in the loft," said Villiers, "and will be cut off";"
and plunging across the yard, he dragged him down, and
had all but brought him to the steps of the door, when a
fresh body of men burst through the garden-gate. They
fell on him with fury. " Save me!" cried the miserable
man, " save me !" as Wheeler, one of the foremost,
seized and tore him from Villier's grasp. Villiers threw
himself the body, and with his sabre swept a circle
around him, and, placing the unhappy wretch behind him,
he endeavored to cover his retreat into the house. But
it was in vain. The walls were scaled, the yard filled
with ruffians, and, after a tremendous effort, Villiers
found himself driven up to the steps, and was dragged by
Bonsor and the keeper within the door.
" Open the
door," he cried to them, as they endeavored to retain him
in their arms, and to prevent him from exposing himself
in vain. "Open the door. They will tear that poor
wretch in pieces. Let us rescue him." But the firm-
ness of the keeper held him fast. It was too late.
Imidst the roar and outcry they heard one frightful cry,
"Save me !" From the window one of the policemen
saw a figure hurled down to the ground by a group of
fiend-like faces, who fell on it like cannibals on their
prey. And this was the last thing known of the unhappy

was examined, a limb was found, with a fragment of
dress upon it, which was supposed to be his, but all the
rest was indistinguishable. Villiers, absolutely sick with
horror, would have sunk under it, had his attention not
been called to Bevan, who, with nerves far less accus.
tomed to such scenes, had fallen back in a chair and all
but fainted. But this sight, and the necessity of exerting
himself, roused Villiers anew.
" Now, my friends," he said, " we are safe. We
have gained all the time we could have expected by
maintaining our outposts. They cannot touch us here;
and we have only to stand firm for an hour or two longer,
by which time the dragoons will arrive."
" Thank God !" uttered every one present, with a
deep and long inspiration.
Why, Bevan, my good fellow, you of all men must
not give way," said Villiers to him. 66 What shall I do
without
my aide-de-camp? Take some of this," and he
compelled him to swallow a glass of wine. "Now,
gentlemen, half to the front of the house, and half to the
back. Manage your fire well. Let the boys, with their
paving-stones, employ themselves in the attics; and Bon-
sor, hereif Mrs. Bonsor has any large washing-tubs,
and will fill them with water, and put some wet blankets
into them, they may be of use."
He did not tell the landlord his reason ; but he whis-
pered to Brown, " We have little to fear now but one
thing. Look to fire, and be ready to put it out ; but
nothing. Move that mattress closer to the back-door-
now bring that chest of drawers against it-raise it on
the table; those chairs will fill
up
the
passage. Are all
the other lower windows well barricaded ?" and Brown
having examined them with him, they were satisfied that
it would be impossible for an entrance to be effected
without more time than must elapse before assistance
would reach them. He pointed this out to the little party,
and their stations being taken at the upper windows, the
battle once more began.
It is needless to dwell upon the madness and ferocity
with which the assaila its now, like a tiger blooded with

its first prey, hurled themselves against each front of the
house. "The doors and the windows on both sides were
in a few minutes shattered to atoms and torn from their
place. The ground in front of them was piled with
bodies, which fell rapidly under the fire from the upper
windows, and still fresh waves swept up and broke against
the wall, in vain attempts to tear away the mattresses
and beds, which presented a more effectual barrier than
even a wall of stone. Four times Wheeler, who was
leading on the attack in the yard, drew back his men
and paused. Four times they fell again upon the house,
hoping that the ammunition of the little garrison would
be exhausted or their courage worn out.
Their own
fire-arms, not many in number, had long since become
useless by the failure of powder, and the stoutest hearts
were beginning to think of abandoning the attempt, or,
at any rate, of waiting for daylight, and for what the day
might bring. They now felt that the plot which they
had so long dwelt on in secret had exploded, and this
was the first act. They were now committed; but if
this was the beginning, what would be the end? Wheeler
alone was resolved to lose no time. He had kept to him.

Barracks, lest it should dishearten his followers; but
finding the steady and military defence which the attack.
ed were making, he could little doubt that they had
thought of sending for assistance. At any rate, news of
such an outbreak travels fast, and with the morning the
troops would come. He rested gloomily and savage-
ly, like a wild beast at bay, with his back against the
stable wall. Something embarrassed his feet, and he
looked out to see what it was. It was a mangled, dis-
figured head, and he kicked it away with a frightful oath
" So much for one traitor." One of the men brought
him a pot of beer to quench his thirst, but he thrust it
aside, and cursed him for his pains. He was like a dog
caught in a trap, and frantic with pain, whom it is not
safe to approach even to set him free. The men rested
on their arms, and stood aloof from him; when the same
dark figure which was noticed before, once more crept
forward from the gloon and stood at his elbow.

" Captain," he said.
And Wheeler jumped round furiously at the interrup-
tion to his thoughts. "Who are you? Ha!" and he
broke into a savage laugh, in which scorn was mingled
with passion. " You, Mr. Pearce ? Who would have
thought of seeing you where fighting is going forward ?
Are you sure "-and he lowered his voice and ground
his teeth"are you sure this is none of your work ?"
" Wheeler," said Pearce, calmly, " are you not mad
to ask such a question, when you know what I have done
for you this day? Whose fault is this but your own ?
Who permitted your fellows to bring the parson up here
into the forest ?"
Some recriminations only exasperate, but this charged
Wheeler with a fault which he was ready to avow and
lament, and it rather conciliated him.
" Who was it," continued, Pearce, " that managed to
bring you the Brocas men just in time, but myself? And
who can now, if he chooses, put you in five minutes into
the middle of that house, but myself?"
Wheeler stared at him as if asking explanation.
" I tell you, Wheeler," said Pearce,
" that I can put
you, and as many men as you choose, into the middle of
that house in ten minutes-that is, if I choose."
Wheeler stared again; but he was so well acquainted
with Pearce's wonderful skill in observing and collecting
information, and carrying on intrigues, that he believed
it possible for him now to possess some secret means of
executing what he proposed.
"* And you will choose," he said, hastily, you will
choose. How is it? Which is the way?" and he
snatched up the heavy iron bar which he had been
wielding, and was moving to the house.
"Stop, man, stop," rejoined Pearce ; "I may choose,
and I will choose, but it must be on one condition."
" And what is that?" asked Wheeler, impetuously.
I will tell it you fairly, Wheeler," said the other.
" You know that you have in your possession papers of
mine which you have no right to keep, and which can be
of 10 use to you, tho igh they are to me.

to me, and I pledge myself to put you in the middle of
that house within one quarter of an hour, nay, in five
minutes."
Wheeler uttered a violent imprecation.  They are
lost," he cried.
" No, Wheeler," answered Pearce,
Y are not
lostyou know they are not lost; you are me,? such a
fool. Give me up those papers, and
will do what I
promise."
6 You shall do it without," said Wheeler. " Look
here; " and he kicked with his foot against the ghastly
head which lay before him, and even Pearce turned sick
and shuddered. " This is the way we deal with traitors;
and if you refuse to show us the way into that house
now, why you are a traitor, and shall be dealt with
accordingly."
" Hallo, there!" and he summoned some of his men
to seize Pearce. Pearce himself preserved his equa.
nimity as usual. " Send away your men," he said, " for
you know they are of no use. You know that if my head
was to be torn from my body, I would not utter a word
which I did not choose ; and if I were gone, what would
become of your purse, ha? Stand off
, my good fellows,"
he said to the party that approached; "do you know who
I am?" and they fell back, awed by his manner and
gesture.
"Wheeler," he said again, " you have now but a
short time to finish your work in : in another hour or
two soldiers will be here; and unless the house and all
that 's in it are yours by that time, you know that you
are lost. No one will stand by you to be shot down like
partridges. If you cannot take a poor-public house, who
do you think will follow you in any other of your projects ?
Will
you give me those papers ?"
They are lost, I tell you."
No," replied Pearce, "they are not lost. I give
you five minutes for your answer, and then I shall be off."
And he took out his watch, and began to count. Wheeler
remained sulkily silent. The five minutes expired; and
Pearce wished him good night, and was leaving.
I

my box."
" Stop, come back," cried Wheeler; " if I can find
them, you shall have them to-morrow."
Pearce came up to him, and looked him full in the
face. "Do you think I am such a fool as to wait for to-
morrow? I must have them now on this spot."
" They are not here," said Wheeler; "they are in
" No," said Pearce, hastily, "they are not in your
box." He spoke incautiously; and if the other had
observed the vehemence and certainty with which he
asserted this, he might have suspected what was actually
the factthat Pearce, while every one else had been
engaged in the affray, had contrived to return to Wheeler's
room, and there, by means of his ingenious apparatus,
had made himself master of all the contents of the corded
deal box, among which he had not hesitated to select
some documents of even more importance to their right
owner than his own were to himself. He reconciled the
abstraction to his conscience by the plea of necessary
ietaliation. The end justified the means.
Wheeler remained silent again. " And if I do give
'hem to you," he said, at last, " how do I know that you
will show us the way?"
" I will give you leave to shoot me," said Pearce.
" We may do that without your leave, said
Wheeler.
"I can wait no longer," exclaimed the other.
I to have the papers ?"
" Take them, and much good may they do you," cried
Wheeler, furiously. And from a secret pocket in his
rough coat he drew a packet tied with tape, and sealed
with black wax, and flung it at Pearce's feet. Pearce
took it up, carefully examined it, carefully deposited it in
a secret pocket in his own coa, and then told Wheeler
and his party to follow him.

CHAPTER X.
that passage.
There was near to, but not actually adjoining, he north
gable end of the Blake Arms, a long low range of
buildings, which had been attached by degrees to the
main fabric, and served the purpose of scullery, brew-
house, wash-house, and other useful offices. Seemingly,
there was an open passage between it and the house ;
and, externally, it presented no means of access to the
interior. It had, therefore, not been marked as a point
of attack; and as no window opened from the gable, it
lay out of sight of the besieged. Pearce led the
way
to
this range, and ordered them to remove a pile of old
packing.boxes and hampers, which were lying loosely in
one corner. "Underneath," he said, "you will find a
trap-door; that door is the outer entrance to the cellars,
which lie under these low buildings ; from the cellars a
flight of stone steps leads up into the kitchen. And I will
venture to say, that no one has thought of blocking up
It is scarcely ever used."
In what manner he had obtained his information it is
unnecessary to explain. With his shrewdness and talent
for such a discovery, this was one of the least extraor-
dinary of his achievements. He had learned it from
the men who were in the habit of carting coals into the
Blake Arms, and who had often seen butts rolled down
into the cellar through the inclined plane which the trap.
door covered, and had themselves been admitted by the
stone steps into the interior of the house.
And while this was passing on the outside, what was
occurring in the interior of the house ? Few things are
more wonderful than the facility with which the human
mind accommodates itself to any circumstances, however
strange and dreadful. Satisfied that the defences were
sufficient to enable them to hold out for a considerable
time longer-accustomed to the fearful sights, and sounds,
and work of butchery, which at first had thrilled them with
horror, and encouraged by the pause which had been
made in the a'tack, and by the obvious discomfiture of the

assailants, the little party had laid down their arms, and
Villiers had insisted that such as were most exhausted
should endeavor to take some repose, if only for a few
minutes. Mrs. Bonsor and Mary were employed in
carrying refreshments to them, and Villiers, with Mr.
Brown, once more looked round the lower rooms,
strengthening the weak parts of the barricades, and
satisfying themselves that all was right. Two points he
was still anxious about-the possibility of fire and the
failure of ammunition. Against the former he had made
the provision of the wet blankets, and for the latter he
now proposed that recourse should be had to the powder,
of which the landlord had spoken, in the cellar. Brown
went to call Bonsor, that he might show him where it
was to be found. And all three had just reached the
door, which opened from the kitchen at the top of the
stone steps, when they heard voices, a rush, a shout on
the other side within the cellar, and, before they could re.
cover themselves, a crash followed, the panels of the door
fell in, and they found themselves confronting ten of the
most savage of the gang, armed with pickaxes, crowbars,
hatchets, and pikes, and their clothes and faces smeared
with filth and blood. Wheeler was at their head.
Each party recoiled for a nioment at the unlooked-for
encounter. But it was only for a moment ; the next
instant a furious conflict commenced. The steps were
narrow, steep, and without any protection at the sides,
and the communication between thein and the 'raults be.
yond was through a dark, narrow archway, which
admitted only two persons abreast. But for this, all
must have been over at once. It
gave
time to Villiers
and his companions to stop their progress, until the rest
of the little garrison could come to their assistance.
Two of the assailants were hurled off the steps by a tre-
mendous blow from the keeper. Wheeler had aimed
his pike at the breast of Villiers, but the thrust was
parried by the bayonet of a policeman. Brown himself
nearly severed the arm of another pitman from the
shoulder by a stroke of his sabre; and the shots of the
rest of the party, aimed into the dark passage, cleared it

for the time. There was a moment's respite.
66 Block
up this archway," said Villiers. " Here are tubs, boxes;
roll that hogshead to the entrance, and we are still safe."
But before their purpose could be effected, the whole range
of cellars behind was filled with armed men. They
rushed forward like demons, some of them bearing
torches, which threw a lurid glare on the horrible faces
of the throng, others staving the casks and gorging them-
selves with their contents, -all thrusting and forcing on
each other in an irresistible torrent. The foremost, who
had retired within the narrow archway, were driven on
by the rear, whether they would advance or not.
Three of them were struck down. Four more fell under
the fire of the besieged party, who had stationed them-
selves on the stone steps. But the crush carried every-
thing before it. Villiers was driven back, and thrown
down just on the other side of the archway. One of
the policemen was grasped, and hurled from the steps ;
the others were compelled to give way; and Bonsor,
exclaiming that "all was lost ! " was hastening to make
his last effort, and die in defending his wife, when, amidst
the din and clamor of the conflict, all at once, without a
moment's warning, the whole body, besieged and be.
siegers, were wrapped in a whirlwind of fire; there was
a deep, rushing, quivering shock, like an earthquake. A
burst, as of thunder, a crash, gusts and volumes of smoke,
chimneys tottering, roofs splitting, walls opening and
closing again ir huge rents from top to bottom, the ground
rocking under their feet ; then came a pause ; and then
over their heads the showering down of beams and stones,
and fragments of roofs and mangled limbs. All was silent;
and the clock struck five.
When Villiers opened his eyes, he looked up and
saw the grey sky just paling with the approach of dawn,
and visible through a yawning chasm which had been
broken in the crown of the vault. A large stone was
hanging over his head, and seemed ready to fall and
crush him. And stunned and bewildered as he was, he
endeavored to move himself, but a heavy weight was
lying across him. It was a body apparently lifeless, his

143
face to the gro ind; and, by his rough pea-jacket, it was
evidently one of the assailants. Villiers drew himself
from beneath him, and raised himself to look around.
The vault was shattered ; black volumes of smoke were
curling round and round within it, and issuing from the
now shapeless aperture which had formed the narrow
entrance into the cellar. The stone steps were covered
with a pile of mangled, and scorched, and blackened
bodies, among which he recognised Brown, stretched
upon the ground, but still breathing, and the landlord ap-
parently dead, and half-buried under a mass of rubbish.
His thoughts wandered, like those of a dreaming man,
to the scenes in which he had been engaged during the
night ; and at times he fancied that it was a dream, and
that he would awake and find it so. But the cold air
blew upon his face, and he recovered the consciousness
of its reality. He made an effort to move from the
spot ; his hands were unhurt. A pike had penetrated
through the fleshy part of his left arm, but without any
serious mischief; and having been thrown behind the
wall through which the archway opened, he had been
secured both from the blast and the crash of the explo-
sion. For he now remembered the barrel of powder,
and was satisfied that the assailants in their fury, having
begun to stave the casks, had fallen also upon this ; and
the which had glared within the cellar, was suf-
ficient to explain the rest. His next thought was Bent-
ley. He made his way into the kitchen, which had
been dismantled as by an earthquake. The plaster had
fallen from the ceiling ; the shelves had dislodged their
contents ; tables and chairs had been overturned; the
fire had been blown from the hearth, and blazing coal
still lay about the floor ; and a broad rent in the side
wall admitted the light through it.
From this he passed
into the bar, which presented a similar scene of devas-
tation. Part of the staircase had been blown away, and
he was obliged to climb up by the remaining fragments.
But on reaching Bentley's room he found Bevan, with
the two women and the boys, there, and in safety. They
were upon their knees, too horror-struck either to speak

or move.
Bentley himself, who, naturally weak and
nerveless, had acquired strength and fortitude by the trial
10 which he had been exposed, was the most composed.
Bevan, whose heroism, however, had hitherto been nur.
sed in theory, without opportunity of testing it by prac.
tice, was completely overcome. But the sight of Vil.
liers, alive and unhurt, restored them partially to their
presence of mind.
Poor Mrs. Bonsor's first demand
was for her husband. She flung herself at Villiers's
knees, implored him to take her to him, bewailed the
day that she was born, and ihe hour that Villiers had
entered the house ; and then checking herself, even in
the midst of her agony, lest she should hurt his feelings,
she rose up, and snatching a candle, was hastening down
stairs. She had nearly fallen down the aperture which
had been caused by the explosion, but a hand at the
bottom was stretched out to save her, and she was caught
in the arms of her husband, half-scorched, and blackened,
and yet pale as a ghost, and still bewildered in his senses,
but alive. Scarcely before had Villiers seen a sight
which so relieved him. They hastened to the stone
steps, and from a mass of bodies extricated Brown, who,
like Villiers, had been thrown down and trampled on by
the rush, but had been also protected by them in their
fall. One of the policemen was also alive, and had
raised himself from the ground at their approach, and
was shaking his limbs to discover if they were still
sound. The others they were searching for, when a
noise was heard at the front of the house ; and Villiers,
reminding Brown that the conflict might not yet be
over, and that advantage might be taken of the confusion
to effect an entrance, went to ascertain the state of the
He found the yard entirely deserted, but strewed
with the blackened fragments of the outbuildings, and

was also clear. The assailants had fled at the explosion
in all directions. Only a few straggling faces were

that the military would arrive. He sat down at the bow-
window to watch , and the stupor and exhaustion which
follows over-excitement surprised him with a dizziness,
in which he nearly fell from his chair. Once more the
whole scene appeared a dream. The room seemed to
reel round him. Horrible phantoms, visions of the
realities which he had witnessed, Caronged round him,
as in mockery and defiance. He roused himself, drew
his hand across his eyes, and once more prepared to
take his post, in case the attack should be renewed. He
surnmoned Brown, now sufficiently recovered to examine
the state of the defences.
" It cannot be," said Bevan, when Villiers suggested
the possibility that they might still be in danger. "It is
not possible, after what has happened, that they will ven-
ture again."
Villiers cheered him with the expression of a hope
that he was right.
" But it is our business," he said, " to prepare for
the worst.
All may still be lost by neglect. And if
these are the dangers and the enemies which we are
likely to encounter in this country, we must learn perse.
verance as well as courage. Here is Mr. Brown, with
the true spirit of an English soldier, as ready to fight to
the last, now, as he was at the beginning."
Brown cheerfully assented. On examination, they
found that the house itself, though shattered by the ex-
plosion, had not sustained any damage which materially
affected its security. The archway opening which had
been made into the kitchen was soon blocked up. Ana
the little garrison, miserably reduced in number, and
thinking bitterly of those who had been lost, once more
assembled, and Villiers insisted that they should take
some refreshment again. The morning was now break-
ing with returning light; the consciousness and the reality
of danger were disappearing. And assuming a confidence
which he did not feel, Villiers cheered and comforted
them, till they began to think that all danger was past.
And all danger would have been past, if the conflict
had been only with a rude and undisciplined mob. But

And any

CHAPTER XI.
The body which had recoiled from the front when the
explosion took place, and those who had escaped from the
yard, re-assembled at some little distance, in an open space,
which served for the market of Howlas. Dismayed, dis-
heartened, and ignorant of the cause of the explosion,
their leaders lost, and their passion cooled by terror,
they would have abandoned all further attempts upon the
inn, and separated, had not once more the same figure,
which has appeared so frequently, emerged from the sur.
rounding gloom, and insinuated himself into the crowd.
In the mass not a few were found who had been saved,
almost miraculously, from the explosion. They had been
drinking in the cellars, and many of them, though fear-
fully burned, were still in a state of intoxication. There
was no difficulty in approaching, none in representing
al} that had passed as a mere delusion, none in suggesting
the possibility of obtaining more drink. The Swan was
at hand; there was plenty of liquor there. Nothing was
needed but to call for the landlord ; and a rush, no one
seemed to know how or why, was made to the Swan.
The family, already startled from their sleep, and gazing
in terror from the windows, were compelled to open the
door. The mob (for they had now lost all appearance
of an armed force) burst into the passage, the bar, the
cellar, demanding liquor. In a few minutes the house
was ransacked. Those who were before intoxicated
became now frantic, and those who had been desirous in
sober terror to retire were now again inflamed and ready
for a fresh attack. They were ready for anything,

ing in the house; and one, the same boy who has
appeared before, held one in joke to the curtains of the
front parlor. The jest caught, others did the same, and
before any attempts could be made to extinguish the
flames, the house was in a blaze. "Now, then, to the inn!"
was the cry;
66 To the inn!" 66 To the inn!" Some
one had raised the shout from the extremity of the throng,
but it was caught up in a moment. " To the inn!" " To
the inn!" And Villiers, who had heard the uproar, and saw
a glare of light rising up over the roofs of the adjoining
houses, had scarcely time to give the alarm, and to gather
his diminished garrison, when once more the assailants
plunged headlong into the little square. They were no
longer marshalled; there was no word of command, no
alt, no appearance of order. Leaping, dancing, shrie .
ing, howling, more of them bearing in their hands
fragments of burning wood than weapons, and resembling
little but a horde of wild savages in some mad and bloody
revel-tossing their torches into the air, and hurling im.
precations upon all who should resist them, mixed with
obscene shouts and blasphemous curses, they rushed upon
the inn. One party advanced before the rest. In the
midst of them was a wretched man, naked all but his
shirt, whom they had dragged from his bed, at the Swan,
and at his earnest prayers had permitted him, as a jest,
to drag with him a heavy portmanteau. Round him they
danced and screamed, till the miserable being would fain
have closed his eyes and ears to avert the sight and
sounds, which seemed to him a foretaste of his place of
eternal torment. Now they dragged him along through
the mire; then they hunted him before them; then they
compelled him to huy and embrace his precious port-
manteau, which, at last, they tore from him, burst it open,
and in one minute its contents were dispersed among the
mob, and sovereigns were rolling about the ground.
At last, as if satiated with play, a hand was raised
behind him, and he was levelled to the ground.
66 Ha!"
said Brown to Villiers, who were gazing on the scene
from the bow.window, " there is our unfortunate friend

over.
he has neither saved his money, nor has his noney saved
him. But shall we fire ?"
"Not yet," said Villiers ; "the miserable wretches
are intoxicated. Blood enough has been shed already,
if more can be spared; they may be incapable of doing
mischief, and must be insensible to menace." And,
apparently, this was the case. They advanced close up
to the inn, dashed their weapons against the wall, but
made no effort to enter.
" Are there not some boys climbing over the wall ? "
said Brown. "Look, sir, close by the wall that has been
broken down by the explosion."
Yes," said Villiers, " there is a man helping a boy
Look, he is giving him a torch. Let Bonsor have
an eye to the yard. I confess I like these fiery weapons
far less than the pickaxes and pikes. Happily, they do
not seem to have any of their wits about them." And
the mob indeed had not; but there was another near
them who had,the same who was assisting over
the wall the young boy, to whom he had suggested the
exploit.
Surely," said Villiers, a short time after, "I smell
fire. There is smoke coming up the staircase. They
cannot have found means to throw fire into the house?
But he had scarcely uttered the words, when Bonsor
rushed
up
stairs to tell him that the lower rooms were in
flames.
66 All of them ?" asked Villiers.
" Three," said Brown. * They have managed to
throw fire in among the bedding and chairs, and th9
things are too crowded for us to get at it."
It was the first moment that Villiers had felt despair.
But be now sank down, and groaned aloud. Presently
he sprang up, as if ashamed of his weakness.
"Can we make a sally ?" he said to Brown.
Brown shook his head. 66 There are but five of us,
and there are two women and the sick gentleman to
protect, and he not able to walk. It would be certain
destruction."
And at that minute the clock struck once more.
66

149
Three hours !" exclaimed Villiers. "If we could only
gain a little time-half an hour more !"
But the smoke now rolled up the stairs in thicker
volumes.
66 Where are the wet blankets ?" cried Villiers. But
on examining, it was found impossible to use them. The
fire had been thrown in among the loose furniture, and
it was hopeless to attempt to extinguish it.
Bonsor," said Villiers, " close fast the doors of these
rooms. Help me to tear away this part of the staircase.
Now throw down into the opening carpets, rugs-any-
thing which will close it up. You have a cistern on
that floor; get at the pipe, and have water ready to keep
them wet with. If we can stop the communication be-
tween the two floors, we may last out yet."
Why, sir," said Bonsor, " I have often heard my
father
say that this house was built by a man who had a
patent for keeping houses from being burnt. It was he
who built that house in which the king and all his court
drank tea in the upper room, while the under room wa:
set on a blaze with faggots and tar-barrels. He hai
something-mortar, I thinkput between all the joists
of the ceilings, so that the fire cannot get at the wood."
" Thank-"exclaimed Villiers. He was going to
finish the exclamation, but even in his deepest emotion
he hesitated to use the sacred name. He only looked
up reverently, fervently, and gratefully.
help us."
And they proceeded with great energy to accomplish
what he had suggested. The staircase was pulled away,
the aperture filled up. Nothing remained for them but
to sit down and gaze upon each other, while the devour.
ing element beneath them was roaring and chafing under
their feet as if impatient to obtain access to them.
"It's very odd, sir," said Bonsor, who had just suc-
ceeded in turning the pipe of the cistern, so as to give
them a command of water, "but my father, who was
your father's tenant, sir, at Rudgely Farm, when he
built this house, always had a fancy that it would be
burnt some day or other. It's wonderful how things
This may

turn out. Who would have thought, when he had that
mortar put to the ceilings, and this great leaden cistern
built, so many years back, that it would have stood us in
this stead now? It looks wonderfully like a Providence."
And Villiers thought how many such Providences oc-
cur each hour, connecting the most remote occurrences,
and planned by an eye to which there is neither past nor
future in its provisions for the dispensation of justice.
"Why," continued Bonsor, " that leaden cistern itself,
we used to laugh at him for building ; only he would
have it. And it cost him a power of money. He had it
made over the wood-house and coal-house, and built it
upon great thick walls strong enough for a house. I shall
never forget when the bill came in for lining it with
lead. But he made the best of it, and bade us not laugh,
for one of these days we should find the use of it. I do
not know if he thought anything of the kind of doings we
have had to-night, for at that time there were no mines
opened here. But he always had a sort of superstition
about that cistern ; and so have I."
It is wonderful with what avidity minds in moments
of danger sieze upon omens.
The leaden cistern was
something more than an omen. But even in this light
it encouraged them; and the party renewed their exer-
tions to keep the aperture of the staircase closely blocked
up with wet carpets. Apparently their efforts were suc.
cessful. The flames roared underneath their feet; vast
whirlwinds of smoke gushed out of the lower windows,
and swept round them, at times almost suffocating them ;
but their position was still tenable. There was no ne.
cessity to keep watch at the windows; they were pro-
tected from the attack of the assailants by the
the very flames
which were threatening their destruction.
6. Take care, do not waste the water," said Villiers;
" I think the fire is wearing itself out ;" when Brown
came rushing to him in consternation. They had for-
gotten the back staircase. The flight of steps opened in
a corner of the kitchen, which, being paved with stone,
was the last part which the fire had reached. But it had
penetrated there, had crept along the dressers and ranges

of shelves, and had seized the stairs; and volumes of
smoke and flame were now bursting from the passage,
on which it opened upon the first floor. Villiers hastened
to the spot. They endeavored to tear down the wood.
work, but the fire would not allow of their approach.
Water was thrown in every way possible upon the floor;
but their carpets and rugs had all been employed on the
front stairs." And as Villiers was hurrying to Bentley's
room, that he might be removed to the attic, Bonsor met
him, with a face of horrible despair, to tell him that the
leaden cistern was exhausted. Villiers could only ex-
claim "God's will be done! Get your wife and your
boys up stairs," he said ; " there we may make another
stand yet. Brown, help me to wrap Mr. Bentley in these
clothes. Can you walk ?"?
" I will try."
Make haste!"
And supported between Villiers and Bevan, Bentley
was removed into the garret. To this there was but one
staircase ; and, as far as it was possible, they contrived
to block this up in the same manner as before. And
when all was done, they assembled in one of the rooms,
and gazed upon each other's faces. Brown looked at
his watch. It was near six, and broad daylight.
" Is there not an opening in the roof?" said Villiers.
"Go, Brown, and see if the smoke will enable you to
look out ; it may command the road. See if they are
coming."
Brown lefi the room. He had to pass through a dark
sort of closet to reach the ladder which led to the trap-
door in the roof. As he opened the door, by the dim
light which streamed in he saw a figure crouched up in
one corner, and glaring on him with eyes of defiance.
Before he could return or advance a pistol-ball whizzed
past him ; and he threw himself upon the man. The rest
heard the shot, and were with him in an instant. The
miserable man was seized, disarmed, dragged to the
light, and found to be covered with blood,

of the assailants, and not of the meanest class. He, liko
Bonsor and the others, had been stunned, and had re-
covered, but not till the house was on fire. He had been
thrown by the explosion into a dark corner of the kitch-
en, in which no one had observed him ; and when roused
from his stupefaction by the flames, wounded as he was
in his jaw, and in an agony of pain, he had managed to
crawl up the back stairs. It was the only chance of
escape ; and he had hidden himself in the place least
likely of discovery, resolved to prolong his life as long as
possible, and planted, with his last bullet, to shoot the
first man who approached him.
" Villiers, Villiers!" whispered Bentley, as he raised
himself feebly from the mattrass on which they had laid
him, " that is the man who stabbed me!"
It was Wheeler. What would have been the conduct
of the others on such a discovery had they been left to
themselves, it is hard to say. They threw themselves
on him even now, and perhaps would have hurled him
from the window ; but Bentley started up, and implored
them to desist. Villiers himself rescued him.
" Place
him on the floor," he said. " Have you his arms ?"
" Yes."
He bade the policeman stand over and watch him.
" Shall we tie him hand and foot, sir?"
"No," replied Villiers ; "not here--not in such an
hour-not when the house is on fire. Leave him to the
just judgment of the Almighty."
And for a time their attention was withdrawn from
him by a crash underneath. It was the falling of the first
floor. For a few minutes there was a lull in the fury of
the flames, and then they burst forth with redoubled
violence. The smoke began to find its way through the
crevices of the planks, notwithstanding the mode in which
they had been secured by the builder. The heat became
intolerable ; huge flakes of fire swept up into the air,
and fell again upon the roof, and threatened to kindle
that. It was evident that all was over.
" Open that window," said Villiers, " the wind seta
off from that quarter."'

And Brown went to it, and looked out.
In doing so
he roused the poor landlady from the stupefaction in
which she was lying while Bevan and Bentley were
praying:
She had sunk down in one corner of the
room ; her husband had seated himself by her side, and
held her in his bosom. The two boys had nestled them.
selves at her feet, and she had clasped both their hands
in hers; and with her eyes closed, as if she dared not
look on them, she was muttering to herself. Once
she opened her eyes, and saw the poor servant-
maid
crying as if her heart would break. Poor Mary was
alone, without a friend. She herself would perish with
those she loved best. It was a consolation; and she
beckoned to the poor girl to come and sit down beside
them. They were all speechless ; only the mother at
times muttered a few broken words~ To die such a
death! To be burned alive, and they so young! My poor
boysmy beautiful boys! To be burned to death!
Help!" she cried, and rushed to the window. "Help!
help! in the name of Him who died for you! Will you
burn us alive-mother and children-husband and wife-
who never harmed you ?" But her voice was lost in the
roaring of the flames. Nor was there any one to hear.
The crowd had dispersed; all round the house was
empty; two boys only were standing in the yard.
They are young like you," she cried. "You have
a mother.
Would you
like to see her burned to death ?"
and she stretched herself out of the casement, till one
of the boys, with fair hair and delicate features, which
strangely contrasted with his poor dress, caught sight of
her. " There are ladders," she cried, " there are ladders
-put them up here, up by the cistern-here under the
window-for the love of God, for the love of God!"
And the fair boy, evidently horrified, endeavored to
move a ladder which lay on the ground, where it had
been brought by the assailants to scale the walls ; but
his strength was unequal to it. Villiers came to the
window. It was the poor boy whose life he himself
had saved from a similar fate. The boy caught sight of
him, and uttered a loud cry. " Help! help!" he said

to his coarse sturdy companion, who only cursed him tor
And as the poor fellow was endeavoring to move
the ladder, he received a slap on his face from behind,
and the same figure which has so often appeared, ap.
peared once more, and harshly bidding them both come
with him, and not meddle with what did not concern them,
he dragged him away. Villiers saw this; but as he
looked up he saw something else. "They are coming,
they are coming!" he cried; and the troop of dragoons
appeared in full gallop on the brow of the hill. It was a
moment of intense suffering. There was help close at
hand; but it would reach them too late. The low room
was already filled with a dense smoke ; the heat was
intolerable. There were sounds of something falling
beneath them, as the ceiling was giving way, and the
floor in several places seemed sinking. At Villiers's
exclamation they had all fallen on their knees, all but
Wheeler, who, with his face crouched as close as possible
to the floor that he might escape the smoke, lay perfectly
silent, but evidently in great agony; and as Bevan
prayed aloud, his features settled into a horrible ex-
pression of scorn and despair. A few minutes more
inust bring the troops to them; but the delay of a minute
might be fatal, and it might be some time before they
could be discerned. And Villiers rose to go to another
window, and endeavor to enlarge the opening, to give
more air. As he looked out from it he observed the
leaden cistern. It was at a considerable depth beneath
him; but he resolved to venture. The cords of the beds
were taken out, knots were tied in them, one end was
made fast round a bedstead, and in the midst of the
inexpressible anxiety of all who gathered to watch his
descent, he climbed through the window and slided down
the rope. It swung fearfully as it received the weight;
but he had been accustomed in youth to gymnastic
exercises, and, setting his feet against the wall, he
contrived to land himself safely on the brickwork edge
of the cistern. But his foot had no sooner touched it
than he endeavored to spring up again and hold by the
rope. His ancle had touched the brick, and was blistered

with the heat, for the store of wood and coal which were
deposited in the place underneath had been set firo to,
and had acted as a furnace. He clung to the rope
with
all his strength, as it swung backwards and forwards vio.
lently over the cistern ; and as his eyes turned down
they saw a sight enough to appal the stoutest heart, for
the bottom over which he was swinging was full of
melted lead. Even now his presence of mind did not
forsake him. As the rope swung over to the edge he
arrested it with his foot, landed on the narrow brink, all
but lost his balance, and fell backwards into the cistern;
but with desperate plunge he recovered himself, and
the next moment threw himself on the ground. He fell
upon his face, half stunned, shattered, and bruised, but
with his senses still awake. As he rose upon his feet, he
heard the dragoons galloping into the street; and a shout
from the window over his head told him there was not a
moment to lose. In an instant he was in the front of the
house. Some dragoons had dismounted. Together
they rushed into the yard, and the ladder was raised to
the window from which he had himself descended ; it
was the only one accessible. He would himself have
mounted, but was conscious that his wounded arm
and bruised frame rendered him less serviceable than
others. The sergeant therefore ascended the ladder.
The women were placed on it, and reached the ground
safely. Bonsor and Brown were preparing to lower
Bentley from the window next; but just then a part of
the floor began to give way. Bentley entreated them to
save themselves; he was prepared for his fate. He
would wait till the last. He entreated them not to think
of him ; and had nearly persuaded them to let the boys
escape next, when, from the corner of the room in which
he had been crouching, Wheeler sprang forward and
thrust them aside. He leaped upon the window like a
maniac escaped from his keeper. A prospect of saving
his life once more opened ; and he threw himself upon
the ladder-his foot missed he strove to recover himself,
but in vain. He tottened-staggered-clung to itbut
in vain ; and Villiers saw him fall headlong into the

cistern. There was
a cry, such as
one then
present had ever heard before--one of such unutterable
horror, that, for years afterwards, Villiers would wake up
in the middle of the night, as he fancied he heard it in his
dreams, and the cold sweat would stand in drops upon his
forehead. Villiers sprang upon the ladder. The mise.
rable being had fallen upon his hands and knees in the
pool of molten lead ! He saw Villiers, and shrieked to
him to save him. He called him by his name ; but it
was hopeless. He offered worlds to save him.
" Take
me out! take me out? It is a hell! I will tell all--I
you all! Oh, Mr. Villiers, help me! I can tell
you what you would give worlds to know !
your papers-
sI know where your child is ! Help me!
Help me!" And as Villiers, struck to the heart, was
almost plunging to rescue him, the poor wretch fell upon
his face. It was all over. Bentley, Brown-all of them
descended the ladder. They were saved-saved as by a
miracle. They gathered round Villiers, who had saved
them ; but he had fallen against a wall, like one petrified.
" I have seen your papers
!
66 I know where your
child is !" The words rung in his ears" I know
where your child is !" Once more he sprang up the
ladder, in the vain thought that all might not be lost; but
he was dragged back by Brown and Bevan. There
was a crash,-a shock,--the roof fell in, and it was all
over.
"I always thought," said Bonsor to his wife the next
day, " that the leaden cistern had been built for some
purpose !"
CHAPTER XII.
We must now pass over a space of three weeks, during
which Villiers, by the strict injunctions of Mr. Morgan
and Dr. Mayo, was confined to his room at the Priory.
He suffered acutely from the injuries which he had re.

ceived ; and though he submitted patiently and calmly,
the trial was most severe. His own feelings would have
cast aside all thought of bodily anguish in the search for
some clue to the few words which had been uttered by
the miserable man Wheeler, and which in every waking
hour, and even in his dreams, rang in his ears" I know
where your child is !" Even Villiers's patience and
humility would scarcely have been proof against the au-
thority which bound him to quietude at such a moment,
had not Bevan and Beattie, and, with still more judgment
and sagacity, Brown, the superintendent of the police,
undertaken to prosecute the inquiries for him, and en-
gaged in it with an untiring zeal and affection, which
Villiers's conduct and character had rapidly won from
them.
There had been little difficulty in tracing through
Cookesley, who had withdrawn from the outbreak as
soon as he saw the direction which it was about to take,
a connection between Wheeler and the mysterious
Pearce ; for Wheeler, incautious and passionate, had
often suffered himself to speak before his companions on
subjects on which Pearce himself studiously preserved
the strictest reserve. Pearce himself had been traced to
Hawkstone, and even, by Miss Brook's assistance, to
poor Margaret's lodging. But there all clue had ceased.
Connell, and his wife, and boy-all had disappeared.
Margaret, who might be supposed to know something of
their visiter, was lying, in a state of insanity, in the hos.
pital ; and Beattie and Brown were at this time in Lon.
don, endeavoring to procure some aid from the information
of the London police. Their return was expected this
evening ; and Villiers, with the assistance of a stick,
was slowly pacing up and down the long library of the
Priory, while the shadows fell darker and darker; and
at every sound of rustling leaves or moaning wind which
could be possibly mistaken for the crashing of wheels, he
started, and his heart beat, while he listened at the win-
dows,--all in vain. It is a dreary hour, that twilight
before the curtains can be closed and lamps lighted
when nature is darkening without, and all is cold and

vacant within. And Villiers, as he looked round upon
the heavy, gloomy recesses of the library, and then out
apon the range of park, which stretched, without sign of
human habitation, far into the wooded recesses of the hill.
side, thought within himself of solitude. He was rich,
he was master of possessions which the world might
envy. The earth lay before him with all its charms, if
they had been charms to him. The cup of life had in-
deed been quaffed, and its bitterness had been tasted-
exquisite bitterness even at the brim! Still the years of
a manhood full of energy and promise stretched out to
tempt him to indulge in any dream of ambition which rank,
and genius, and power, and influence could dare to form.
And yet upon Villiers's heart there lay a dead, cold,
aching void. He was solitary. There was no one to
share his existence, to renew his being. And though
Villiers knew that the solitude of a Christian was far
other than that of the worldling, the knowledge was not
yet (alas ! how rarely can it be) realised, and incorpora-
ted with consciousness. He was abandoning himself to
a morbid reflection and commiseration upon his own con.
dition, when his eye fell upon the picture of Lady Esther,
which now hung over the fire-place in the library, and it
operated, as it always did, to recall him from himself to
others. He thought of that dreary solitude of the heart
in which his mother's last years had been spent upon
earth. Then his memory glanced upon poor Macarthy,
and on the loneliness which must have fallen upon him
had his life been spared, and he himself had become an
outcast from his own faith and Church, without any
shel.
ter in the Church of England to receive him in that fear-
ful crisis. Then he turned to Bentley, and took up and
tore with indignation, a printed paper which had been
sent to him that morning, and in which Bentley's name
was mixed up with some slanderous and cruel insinua.
tions. And he foresaw that Bentley himself was about
to be exposed to a fearful struggle, in which he stood
alone, with scarcely any but Villiers to support him.
And then his eye fell upon a portfolio of drawings
which la v upon the table near him, and, as if summon

ing up resolution to recall his thoughts from morbid med-
itation upon solitude to immediate practical efforts to
provide a consolation and relief for it, he rang the bell,
and desired the servant to make his compliments to Mr.
Plasmer, and if he had finished his wine, to say that
Villiers would be happy to see him in the library.
Mr. Plasmer, the servant said, had dined immediately
after his return from his walk into the park; and in about
five minutes the gentleman made his apperance.
Now Mr. Plasmer was a fashionable architect and
designer, and had been recommended to Villiers by a
nobleman who knew his reputation, though utterly inca.
pable of estimating his powers of art; and having arrived
from London the same afternoon, he was now ushered
into Villiers's presence. Villiers received him kindly ;
he would have received him cordially ; but there was a
fluency and ease about Mr. Plasmer's manner which
produced the very opposite effect upon Villiers. And
the architect having seated himself, without being request-
ed, in an easy chair, he proceeded to express his admi.
ration of the Priory, and of all that it contained.
"Only a few touches, Mr. Villiers, wanted here and
there; a slight artistic finish to be given to the details ;
a little more rounding off of outline, and you will be
complete, as I was saying to my friend Lord George the
other day."
But if there was one thing which offended Villier's
fastidious taste, it was an assumption of pretended inti.
macy with persons of high rank; and it induced him to
do what he rarely endured to do, to interrupt Mr. Plas-
mer in his sentence, by asking if he had walked towards
the ruins ?
Indeed, yes, Mr. Villiers," replied Plasmer; " and
charming they arewondrously picturesque, and lovely.
What a pity that you cannot command them from your
dining-room windows here."'
"I fear," answered Villiers coldly, " that the sight of
buildings in ruins, which had been dedicated to religion,
would not, from choice, form any part in a landscape
which I should like to co nmand from my dining-room
windows."

" Indeed! No! Ha! Mr. Villiers, certainly not,"
replied Mr. Plasmer, somewhat perplexed to understand
Villiers's meaning,
" I was induced, sir," said Villiers, gravely, " to re.
quest your assistance in restoring and repairing a portion
of those ruins, which I am unwilling to permit to remain
in their present state."
" Indeed! ha! certainly," said Plasmer, " they are
gone a leetle-leetle too far. The east gable requires
a leetle propping. I suppose, Mr. Villiers, you will turf
down the chapel, and plant flowers ? A lady's flower-
garden, judiciously managed, will look charming under
the east window. Some of my new designed Gothic
trellis-work will be quite delicious there."
" No," answered Villiers, with increasing coldness ;
"I am desirous not of turning a consecrated building
into a flower-garden, but of restoring it to a more proper
purpose."
" Ha! indeed! certainly, Mr. Villiers," replied
Plasmer. " Something useful and ornamental too-I
understand. Farm-buildings ? Ha! or a conservatory?
Charming things are Gothic conservatories, in the forid
style. And yet, Mr. Villiers, farm buildings group well
in Gothic. It was but the other day I put a superb cast.

Plasmer; but he still ventured to add, "I was informed
that you were practically acquainted with the details of
Gothic architecture, and could assist me in obtaining
accurate admeasurements and mouldings from the por-
tions which still remain."
" Indeed! ha! certainly, Mr. Villiers," said Plas.
mer, with a self-satisfied smile ;
6 few men of the age,
I flatter myself, are such perfect masters as myself of
the delicate touches, the true taste, the fine theory of a
genuine Gothic style. It was I, sir, that fitted up that
gem, as Mr. Robins judiciously called it, that gem and
jewel of art, Carnation Abbey, on the banks of the
"Thames, at Putney. My stucco, Mr. Villiers, stood
wonderfully well there. When Alderman Hobson
bought it-a dull man that, sir--mere city-bred, no taste,
but abundance of cash"-and Mr. Plasmer, to Villiers's
great annoyance, looked at him with a vulgar smile of
intelligence," he sent for me.  Plasmer,' said he,
'you see this box'-it was a mere square house ; ma-
hogany door in the middle, four windows in front, two
steps, green verandah, round sweep, laurels, Nower-bor-
ders, and distant view of the Thames through the chim.
neys of the gas-works. Nothing, Mr. Villiers, I assure
you; positively a mere nothing. However, said the
alderman to me, "Plasmer,' says he, "my good fellow,
you know next year I am to be Lord Mayor. I do not
care for money. My daughters want a place ; some.
thing of the antique, they tell me. I took them this
summer to see Tintern, and Netley, and Fountains Ab-
bey; they tell me something of that kind, you know.
You are a clever fellow, you know, and can tell all about
it. Arabella will explain to you better than I can. You
may draw upon me, you know.' Well, Mr. Villiers, we
set about it, and we produced, sir-yes, out of that
square four-windowed housewe p'oduced the gem !'

Only a few touches, Mr. Villiers. I had by me the iron
frames of the Gothic windows ready made. We threw
out a charming oriel in the middle-rather heavy for the
wall, but we did it in wood and plaster to imitate stone,
-put painted glass into the drawing room windows
Scripture subjects, all of them, quite appropriate; bought
a lot of armor, which we hung up in the hall-only
ten feet square, but charmingly pretty ; solemn rather-

all that kind of thing
But here, to Villiers's great relief, the servant inter-
rupted Mr. Plasmer's loquacity by bringing lights and
closing the window-curtains.
" And yet, sir," resumed Plasmer, before Villiers
could change the subject, 66 this was but a mere toy. I
used to smile when the alderman talked of the Abbey;
but he was proud of it: and, indeed, though I say it, he
had reason. It was a gem.
But my great work-my

Villiers bit his lip, and made a faint attempt to incline
his head in token that he was listening, but he could
scarcely succeed.

Scripture subjects, and the stalls beautifully executed,
with angels' heads, and pinnacles and pannels-all that
sort of thing, you know. Well, we ranged them round
the sides of the room, and they looked charmingly-quite
in the purest style. Luckily, the billiard-room was next
to the dining-room ; so we knocked down the partition,
made an entrance through a charming arch, with clus-
tered pillars and mouldings, lighted the new room with
lancet windows, and placed the sideboard at the end on
three steps. Gormanburgh-" here Villiers writhed a
little, as unable to bear any more, but Mr. Plasmer wa..
insensible to the movement-"Gormanburgh," continued
Mr. Plasmer," would insist on having a splendid cellaret
He gave capital wines-capital," he repeated, and
unacked his lips ; " sometimes Irank a little too hard
but that was all his friends' fault-men of the turf, you
know-fond of hard living. However, what were we to
do for the cellaret ? when, luckily, I procured a model of
a charming font, the one at Lynn, canopy crocketed, with
pinnacles and niches--all that kind of thing.' Villiers
writhed again, and attempted to stop Mr. Plasmer; but
he was beyond the control of a sign. " As for the side-
board," he continued, " we had it modelled in stone from
Edward I.'s altar-tomb in Westminster Abbey. Gor-
manburgh had some magnificent gold plate, church plate,
which he had bought in Spain when the monasteries
were plunderedchalices, patines, flagons, and that kind
of thing. I recommended him to buy a couple of silver-
gilt candelabra, quite appropriate ; and when he gave
his grand dinners, I cannot tell you how splendid it
looked-all on the al I mean the sideboard." Vil.
liers half rose from his seat, but to no purpose.
" But the best thing after all," added Mr. Plasmer,
imperturbably, "was his pictures. He had some splendid
paintings, which we placed about the room, with side.
boards under them all appropriate, especially three
lovely Martyrdoms, and a magnificent St. Jerome--fine
coloring, delicate flesh-tintsthe expression of agony

sitting over our wine-quite a feast of art. Gormanburgh
was fond of art,  ravir. You understand French, Mr.

end of the room we built a gallery-three pointed arches,

ately fond of music, sacred music especially, and would
always have it played during dinner. The last time I
dined with him we had the Stabat Mater after the first
course, and the RequiemMozart's Requiem-during
the dessert : it was quite delicious ---so soothing--the
whole thing-all in characterso appropriate." Villiers
sat perfectly still and motionless. At last Mr. Plasmer
came to a close.
" But I have reserved one triumph. It certainly.was
the chimney-piece. I had by me a most magnificent
group of carving from the abbey of St. Jacques, in Bel-
gium-old oak, charmingly executedangels, and that
kind of thing-subject, the Day of Judgment; in the
middle a most splendid group of the Virgin and Child,

Stop, sir," cried Villiers, with a voice of intense
horror and indignation.
Do
you
know of what you are
speaking ?"
Poor Mr. Plasmer nearly jumped from his chair.
But Villiers took no notice. He rang the bell, and
ordering the servant to take coffee for the architect into
the drawing-room, he apologised briefly for cutting short
the conversation ; and Mr. Plasmer, though somewhat
dismayed, and wholly unconscious of any offence which
he had comnitted against either good taste or good
feeling, bowed himself out of the room.
As the door closed, Villiers could not help exclaiming,
" And this, then, is art in England in the nineteenth
century! And such is the horrible profanation to which
the romance of religion, without its spirit, is leading
those who ought to make every work of the hand, as of
the mind, minister to holiness and devotion. Art in the
hands of vulgar and mercenary tools, detached from all
high philosophy, from all practical piety, turned into a

puppet-show, or a painted gewgaw, or made a mere toy
for sale at some paltry exhibition-art, which can dare
to place the triumphs of saints and the agonies of mar-
tyrdoms as an object to luxuriate on in a banquet-room-
art, which can rifle churches to furnish drawing-rooms,
and mix, like another Belshazzar, the holiest vessels of
the most awful mysteries with the cups to be drained in
debauchery--art, which rather than forego the decoration
of a room will preserve and admire what the Scriptures
denounce as an idol, and what cannot but be horrible
blasphemy. Alas!" thought Villiers, " if we condemn
as priestcraft, and superstition, and pious fraud, the
employment of art by popery for the purpose of ruling
minds and warming hearts to mistaken piety, what shall
be said of our use of it to generate nothing but profane-
ness?"
He sighed deeply, and then, to relieve himself, he
opened the portfolio which lay before him, and in which,
with his own hand, he had sketched out his proposed
restoration of the ruins of the Priory. There was the
chapel, rising with its lofty roof, its pinnacles, and its
tower, in the centre of the group. Close by it was the
Hall, with its oriel restored, and the porch, with its flight
of steps, and its tall windows, less ornamented than those
of the chapel. Round it, in a little quadrangle opening
to the south under a cloister, were ranged the buildings
intended to be occupied by the tenants of the edifice.
They were low, yet beautifully broken with buttresses,
and dormers, and clustered chimneys; and Villiers,
who possessed an exquisite taste for landscape gardening,
had struck out a few hints upon the paper of a green
sward running in between the buttresses, and sprinkled
with shrubs and trees. At one side he had added a
projecting mass of building, under which he had written
in pencil, School and Dormitory;" and in a separate
group, only connected with the main building by a low
cloister, and looking out upon the south bank, was a
sketch of another set of apartments, under which he had
also written in pencil, " Infirmary."
He was throwing in a few additional touches with his

pencil, when the servant informed him that Mi Plasmer
would be glad to see him again. And befort Villiers
could either decline or accept the offer, the architect
re-appeared. He brought in his hand a large roll of
drawings, and begged, if Villiers had time, that he would
just cast his eye over them, as it might assist them in
their plans for the Priory. And without giving Villiers
an opportunity of resistance, he spread on the table
before him a long regular mason-like elevation of a
building with a centre and two wings exactly alike.
" This," said Mr. Plasmer, " is my drawing for the
new United Anti-religious-distinction College in the
north of Ireland-Gothic, you see, Mr. Villiers, pure
Gothic. Singular what a rage there is for all that is old.
The institution itself quite a novelty, but the architecture
all antique. I took Westminster Abbey for my model ;
scale smaller, but very like, except where the old archi-
tects failed. Centre building, the principal house, dining-
room twenty-eight by eighteen, two drawing-rooms,
folding doors, small study, capital kitchen and offices,
butler's pantry, bath-room, four best bed-rooms-every-
thing complete. Here you have in the wings admirable
and commodious lecture-rooms, museums, library, reading-
room--wings, you observe, regular,three stories,
windows all pointed,
---mullions of wood, --string course,
curbels, bosses, and all that of my new patent stucco,
-stands the weather admirably, Mr. Villiers,we shall
be able to take our mouldings in it at the Priory cheap
As Mr. Plasmer paused, Villiers was coinpelled to
make some reply, and he coldly observed that he was not
fond of stucco in ecclesiastical buildings ; and that every-
thing which might be done at the Priory he should wish
to be real.
" Certainly, certainly," said Mr. Plasmer. " I made
the very same remark to my friend, Sir George, when he
was building his artificial ruinruin, Mr. Villiers, of an
abbey, at Burnham Grove, near Bristol. Sir George,
said I, you must have something real, something to
interest-a tombstone of two, or some fragments from
as dirt."

a name.
Tintern; here they are, quite close to you; mere brick
and mortar, I told him, was not enough for real genuine
taste.
Villiers was silent, and then asked if there were any
rooms for fellows, or any chapel, in the design of Mr.
Plasmer's college.
"Oh, no!" replied the architect ; "n0 new colleges
in the present day have more than a Principal or Presi-
dent, whatever they choose to call him. One person at
the head is quite enough to make a college, if he has such

fessor of Chemistry a Baptist. It was never dreamed of."
" And what is the salary of the Principal ?" asked
Villiers. " With so large a house, he must require a
considerable income."
" Twelve hundred a year," replied Mr. Plasmer.
" The committee have guaranteed him that. They could
not procure a first-rate scholar for less."
Villiers sighed, and begging that the architect would
excuse his wishing to be alone that evening, he once
more rang the bell, and bowed him out of the room.
Much that he had heard would have appeared exagge.
ration ; but his eye glanced on the newspapers on a
table near him; and there he remembered the programmes
of fashionable concerts, in which the most awful subjects,
the Stabat Mater, and the Dies Ir, were blasphemously
made the amusement of gay and laughing throngs, and,
to divert the mind from their solemnity, were inter-
spersed with light airs from operas, and sung by opera
singers under the direction of prelates of the Church.
He had himself seen upon the sideboards of noblemen
chalices and holy vessels, once consecrated for the altars
of churches, and which were now supposed to be common,
because, having been plundered by one hand, they had
been purchased from the plunderer by another. And he
had seen, even in London, houses fitted up in the midst
of Regent Street as if they had been built in the days of
Elizabeth, and in which religious carvings, profanely but
superstitiously designed for holy buildings, were now still

more profanely applied, without a thought of the mys-
teries which they represented, or the idolatry which
they contained, to support side-boards, and decorate
drawing-rooms.
Perchance, thought Villiers to himself, if art onco
more in England is to be elevated and consecrated,
and made the handmaid of religion and truth, it must find
some blessed shelter in some holy place, where the
minds which gave it birth may be nursed up in prayer
and meditation, shielded from the vanities of the world,
and the applauses of a mob, and the bribery of money.
It may be that a religious home is as needful for the
painter, and the sculptor, and the architect, and the poet,
as for the philosopher and the priest.
And he
rang his bell, and desiring two of his servants
to wait in the ante-room, Villiers knelt down in prayer,
and then summoning the attendants, he proceeded in
their presence to fix his signature to some parchments
which Mr. Atkinson had forwarded to him that morning.
They were deeds making over to proper trustees, under
the control of the bishop of the diocese, all that part of the
Hawkstone estate which had been sacrilegiously ob.
tained by his ancestors from the plunder of the Priory,
that it might be employed under the direction of the
bishop, in establishing and maintaining a college of
clergy and others in the restored Priory, for the perpetual
celebration of divine worship, the spiritual care of the
parish, the education of the young, the care of the poor,
the visitation and comforting of the sick, and as a refuge
for the destitute and the penitent.
An iron chest stood in one corner of the room, and
he affixed his seal to it and directed a label upon it. It
contained the great pall, the gilded cup, the illuminated
manuscriptall that he could find among the so-called
curiosities of the house, which had been plundered from
holy places, especially from the Priory.
Another parchinent remained to be signed. It con.
tained a surrender of all the tithes of Hawkstone, which
had been in the possession of the family ever since the
iime of Elizabeth, to the bishop of the diocese, for the

purpose of being applied in the most efficacious and
fitting manner to supply the spiritual wants of the town
of Hawkstone.
And when this had een done, Villiers once more
knelt down and prayed and gave thanks, and rose up
from his knees deprived of one-fourth of his income, but
lightened of a heavy burden upon his conscience and
his fears.
Villiers had scarcely done this, when the noise of
wheels was heard, crushing on the gravel as they ad.
vanced up the sycamore avenue. He endeavored in
vain to interpet by the sound whether they would bring
to him tidings of good or of ill, of hope or of despair.
He was on the point of hastening to the door in eager
expectation ; but, chastened and subdued with sorrow,
and still more with religious resignation, he mastered
his impetuosity, and though his heart beat thickly, he
waited patiently for the appearance of Bevan.
And Bevan it was, accompanied with Brown and
Beattie. But they uttered no cheerful sounds as they
decended from the carriage ; they waited to take off their
cloaks in the hall, as having no object in hastening to
see him; their footsteps moved slowly across the stone
pavement, and the moment Villiers saw their faces, he
perceived that they had made no discovery; their search
had been wholly baffled.
There was a momentary gush of tears into Villiers's
eyes-a cold dead chill of disappointment--a something
of complaint; but he shook it off in an instant, lifted up
his eyes in humble prayer for forgiveness and for
patience, and then exerted himself to dispel the gloom
which hung over his visitors. He rang for refreshments,
and partook of them cheerfully with them; and cheered
with the sight of his self-command, their own hearts be.
came lightened. Only upon Bevan's face there remained
a gloom which could not be shaken off; and when at
the usual hour the servants had been called in and the
full evening service performed, and the rest having retir
ed, he was left alone with Villiers, he proceeded to
explain the reason. Villiers learnt from him that, not

withstanding all the efforts which had been nade to
prevent observation or gossip on the subject of Bentley,
all the circumstances relating to his disappearance had
been made known, and were become the subject of gen:
eral conversation, but mixed up with the same kind of
exaggerations and scandalous insinuations as had been
suggested to themselves. Nor was this confined to mere
gossip. It seemed as if some hand was busily and
bitterly engaged in giving them publicity. The most
virulent attacks had been made upon him in print, the
walls were scribbled over with his name, placards were
stuck about, the purport of which could not be mistaken,
and even the children in the streets were taught to as.
semble and sing songs under his window. Bevan had
at first endeavored to conceal this from him as he lay
confined to his bed, but he had been obliged at last to
communicate it to him, and to urge upon him the neces-
sity of meeting the calumny boldly and openly. But
Bentley was distracted by the remembrance of his oath.
He had bound himself to be silent on all that had occur-
red that evening, and nothing would induce him to break
his oath. In vain Bevan suggested to him that the
obligation of an oath so imposed was, to say the least,
mnost questionablethat the explosion had made the chief
secret publicthat of those who might be affected by
his disclosures, many had perished and others had already
been seized by the hand of justice. Bentley swerved
not. He asked Bevan if he was satisfied with his in.
nocence; and when Bevan gave him a full assurance of
it, Bentley pressed his hand and said that was enough:
the rest must be left to Heaven. He never could violate
his oath.
But Bevan felt that his friend over-calculated his
strength, and estimated too low the nature of the struggle
which he would have to sustain. He trembled for the
consequence ; and though Villiers endeavored to dispel
his apprehensions, and declared his own determination
to support Bentley through any trial of the kind, neither
of them could disguise from himself the difficulties and
dangers which awaited him. Bevan, however, saw that

Villiers was not yet sufficiently recovered to bear more
excitement, and postponing any further consultation, they
parted for the night.
CHAPTER XIII.
The next morning Villiers was seated in the library soon
after breakfast, and was examining with Bevan some of
the old records of the Benedictine establishments in
England, that he might select from them whatever seem.
ed most suitable for carrying his object into effect in the
restoration of a religious community at the Priory. But
they were interrupted by a gig driving up to the door,
and the announcement of Mr. O'Foggarty, who has be.
fore been mentioned as the Roman Catholic priest re-
cently established at Hawkstone, and who, it was now
understood, was to undertake the office of doinestic
chaplain to Lord Claremont during his residence at the
Park, the good Abb St. Maur being about to return to
France. Mr. O'Foggarty was not, as might be expected
from his name, one of those dark, scowling, coarse, vio-
lent men who have been the appropriate growth of May-
nooth, and are the curse of Ireland, as they are the
bitterest enemies of England : those who distribute the
offices and regulate the policy of the Church of Rome
are far too wise so to misplace their instruments. He
was bland, polished, and insinuating in his manners,
liberal in his doctrine, obsequious in his attentions, and
possessed of a fluency of language and of a smattering of
various accomplishments, which rendered him an agreea-
ble addition to society, and enabled him to exhibit to the
few inhabitants of Hawkstone who ventured to make his
acquaintance, a picture of the Romish Church so unlike
the stern, sanguinary, blackened, and mysterious char-
acter with which it was invested to their eyes by the
traditions of the reign of Queen Mary and the novel of

The Monk,' that their wonder was only equalled by
their gratification, and their willingness to know more of
a system seemingly so amiable and so traduced.
Mr. O'Foggarty apologised to Villiers for his intru-
sion with the ease and courtesy of a man perfectly con-
versant with the world ; and Bevan having retired, he
proceeded to explain the nature of his business, which
related to the payment of an annual sum of money, which
had been left by Lady Esther for religious purposes.
Even Villiers, acute as he was in the perception of
character, and fastidiously alive to anything like hypoc-
risy or insincerity, was touched by the mode in which
Mr. O'Foggarty alluded to the character and the trials
of his mother.
O'Foggarty recognised the picture over the fire-place.
and gazed on it silently for a few minutes. He then
spoke of her charities, and of the interest which she had
always taken in the religious welfare of Hawkstone, so
far as she could assist the labors of her own communion.
"Mr. Villiers, I am sure," continued the speaker,
" will pardon me for thus dwelling on the faith and on
the zeal of one who, if human thought may judge, is
now a saint in heaven. Even though he may differ
from the doctrines and system in which her faith was
purified, he, I am convinced, is not so illiberal as to con.
fine the terms of salvation to his own communion."
Villiers was silent. And Mr. O'Foggarty then touched
on the unfinished state of the new Romish chapel, and
after some general professions of liberality, to which
Villiers lent a very cold incredulous ear, the speaker
thought he might venture on requesting a contribution
for it from Villiers, interested as he must be in the wel.
fare of Hawkstone, and having, indeed, on his own es.
tate, several families who were Romanists themselves.
He added, that if it were a matter of principle, perhaps
he might have hesitated in making the request; but that,
as Villiers was already under an engagement to pay a
certain sum towards the same object, any addition to it
would not involve a question of principle.
To Mr. O'Foggarty's evident chagrin, Villiers re.

plied briefly, that to discharge a debt was one thing, and
to make a voluntary donation another ; that his own con-
scientious opinions were no way involved in paying over
to the furtherance, even of a system which he condemned,
that which he only held in trust for it; but that he had
long since felt the solemn obligation of abstaining from
giving any support, however speciously claimed, to any
other religious community in England but the Catholic
Church. " You must excuse me,
he added,
fully employing these words, since upon them my alle .
giance to my Church is founded."
Mr. O'Foggarty endeavored to assume a smile. " And
might I ask," he said, "if, as I must suppose, you deny
the same title to the Church of Rome, and confine it to
the established communion of England ?"
" I have no right," replied Villiers, "and no incli.

such a subject. But believing the English Church to

Catholic. But you will pardon me if I decline such a
discussion, and content myself with stating, thus briefly,
the reasons why I cannot offer you any assistance what-
ever in propagating a system which, even on this ground
only, I must believe to be inconsistent with Christian
charity, and destructive of divine truth."
" And yet," said Mr. O'Foggarty,
a landlord can-
not be indifferent to the spiritual interest of his tenants
and dependants ; and for their sake may I not ask for
some trifling assistance to the funds which are devoted
to their benefit ?"

But it would little contribute to their welfare to
show myself indifferent to religious truths, to assist in
rearing them in a faith which I believe to be false, to
aid in fomenting those schisms which must in the end
destroy all religious belief in Romanists as well as in
others. It will be my duty to take care that the truth
shall be, at least, offered to them, that opportunities of
hearing it, and of studying it, be provided for them, and
that they be warned of the errors into which they have

tates disturbing the peace and harmony of this place by
a system of proselytism, and will endeavor, by the in-
fluence of his name and property, to withdraw his depend-
ants from the faith of their ancestors ?"
"Rather, you should say," replied Villiers, "recall
them to the faith of their ancestors ; for no one who un-
derstands what Christian truth is would undervalue the
principle of hereditary religion. But I am unwilling to
say anything which may seem unnecessarily harsh and
painful to a gentleman whom I have no reason to sup.

"I should have hoped," said Mr. O'Foggarty, " that,
in these enlightened days, Mr. Villiers would have been
more disposed to recognise the principle that each indi.
vidual should be allowed to choose his own religious
doctrines; and that, as the State has no right to interfere
with them, so neither has the landlord."
" Sir," replied Villiers, " will you pardon me for
saying that I have resided long in Roman Catholic
countries, and have had many opportunities of studying
the Roman Catholic system. To me, therefore, I am
sure you will not think it worth while to address such
sentiments, which cannot be the sincere opinion of any
true Roman Catholic; which are in themselves erroneous

to the whole system and spirit of Romanism, that in the
nouth of a Romanist they sound to me--

Villiers paused, and hesitated to finish his sentence,
lest he should use words too faithfully representing his
own indignation at the imposition which his visitant was
attempting to practise on him.
Mr. O'Foggarty, however, was not abashed. "I
conclude," he said, " that Mr. Villiers will not dispute
the principle that laymen, however gifted and however
zealous, are not the persons to whom the task of prose.
lytism has been especially appointed."
" Assuredly," replied Villiers ; " but to laity, as well
as clergy, has been appointed the task of watching over
the welfare of their brethren, and of promoting the glory
of the Almightyif not by preaching in the congrega.
tion, yet by ministering to the wants of the preachers,
and supplying to them the means of executing their
duty."
" Alas!" said Mr. O'Foggarty, " I fear that this
spirit of proselytism can only engender strife, and destroy
our mutual amity. To its virulence and mistaken zeal
we owe nearly all the bitterness of religious life in this
age."
"I should not have expected," said Villiers, "that a
clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church, of which the
distinctive feature and paramount maxim is the unweary-
ing duty of proselytism, would employ such language.'
O'Foggarty slightly colored.
" I do think," continued Villiers, "that to the spirit
of proselytism, indulged by unauthorized persons-prose-
lytism, not to the simple definite faith committed to us by
heaven, but to our own superadded dogmas and opinions
-proselytism, carried on in defiance of that order and
discipline which was established by the Church of the
Apostles, and of primitive times--to this I do think that
we owe nearly all the miseries and dangers which beset
the Catholic faith. But I mean not to give offence, when
I repeat that an agent of the Romish Church is the last
person to condemn such a spirit, with which all his own
ministerial functions in this land must be tainted ; and I
must distinguish from it most strongly the proselytism
enjoinesl by our Lord 'ipon all his disciples-proselytism

to the simple, unaltered, revealed faith of the Apostles
conducted by authorized ministers, and confined within
ihose limits which apostolical practice has laid down for
it."
Mr. O'Foggarty colored still more, but did not abandon
his ground.
" Mr. Villiers," he said, " must be aware (not that I
would venture to suggest to him for a moment any secular
or worldly considerations) that we are not without influ.
ence in Hawkstone. I confess that I had dared to con.
template with hope the prospect of congratulating Mr.
Villiers on that political eminence to which his vicinity
to Hawkstone, and his long family connexion with the
place, justly entitle him, without alluding to personal
advantages of the highest order. A dissolution of parlia-
ment is expected every day."
Villiers's indignation was roused; and by the expres-
sion of his eye, though he remained perfectly silent, his
visiter saw that he had mistaken the string on which he
had touched.
" Far be it from me," he added hastily, " to suppose
that Mr. Villiers would for one moment permit his con-
scientious practice to be swayed by worldly and selfish
motives. This was far from my thoughts. But I did
wish candidly and honestly to indicate, without reserve,

necessary to take in the event of

finish the sentence, which he was endeavoring to round
off in some ambiguous diplomatic phrase. "Mr. O'Fog.
garty," he said, "and every conscientious Christian, will
of course endeavor, in every possible way consistent with
Christian duty, to give weight and extension to those
opinions which he sincerely believes to be true."
Villiers gave signs that he desired the interview to close.
But O'Foggarty had left one string still untouched.
" I see," he said, in a tone in which he wished to
express sorrow rather than anger, " that Mr. Villiers is
prepared to reject any humble aid which our influence
might offer to him in promoting the welfare of this place.

It is not for frail men like us to boast, and yet we cannot
bat exert great power over the minds of our flocks. To
us are committed secrets which are bidden from every
other eye." And as he uttered the words, he looked at
Villiers significantly; but Villiers heeded him not.
" To us," continued O'Foggarty, still fixing his eye
upon Villiers~" to us, mean and unworthy as we are,
is entrusted in the holy Confessional the knowledge of
things which no human power, no arm of strength, no
dexterity of intrigue can detect, but on which the happi.
ness and the fate of many depend. Inviolate as our
secrecy is, we are yet allowed- nay, enjoinedto make
our knowledge instrumental in redressing the injured,

upon Villiers, he dropped his voice almost into a whisper)
* in restoring the lost."
Villiers sprang up, but sank back again in his chair.
"Sir!" he exclaimed, in a voice choked and broken
with emotion, " I charge you, in the name of Him from
whom you hope for mercy, not to trifle with a miserable
man! If you know anything, I adjure you to speak !
Have mercy upon me!"
O'Foggarty's countenance assumed a look of surprise,
as if his words had meant nothing. "I fear," he said,
"I must have touched inadvertently on some secret string
of sorrow, of which I was wholly unaware. I should
apologise for intruding so long on Mr. Villiers's time ;"
and he proceeded to draw on his gloves, and rose from
his seat.
But Villiers also sprang up, and moved to the door ;
and though unable to speak, he motioned to his visitant
to sit down. O'Foggarty still preserved the same affected
look of surprise, but took his seat, and waited as if in
astonishment, for any further communication. And Vil.
liers soon recovered himself.
" Mr. O'Foggarty," he said, more calmly, " will ex-
cuse me, if I ask him earnestly and solemnly whether
the words which he has just uttered bore any deeper
meaning than a mere generality. As a minister of Him
who is the fountain of mercy, he will not trifle with the

wishing," he said, after a pause, "to explain candidly
and honestly, and without any affectation of concealment"
(it is singular how the most artful minds always boast
most of their candor,) " the principles which must regulate
the ministers of our holy Church in their dealings with
those in this country who are acting to it hostilely and
bitterly. Mr. Villiers himself would not expect that,
trampled on as we have been, plundered, and persecuted,
and maligned for years, and now only beginning to raise
our heads from the dust, we should omit to employ every
legitimate means to secure the approaching triumph of
our holy faith. He cannot think us bound to assist the
enemies of the truth."
Villiers was silent, for he was too agitated to argue ;
and O'Foggarly, after a pause, continued, "I will speak
openly, sir, and without reserve; I will offer to you all
the assistance in my power in obtaining anything which
you most covet, in recovering anything which you
have
lost; and my means are great. I would almost venture
to say my success is certain ; but it must be on one con-
dition, that we receive from Mr. Villiers such a friendly
co-operation and assistance in return as may be expected
from the well-known enlargment and liberality of his
sentiments."
He was silent; and Villiers had sunk down in his
seat, and covered his face with his hands. - Do I under:
stand
you,
sir ?" he said at last, or am I interpreting
your words to imply more than they really mean?"
"Mr. Villiers," said O'Foggarty, "may place upon
my words any interpretation which he thinks fit. I have
said all that I am at liberty to say, and my lips are sealed
beyond. Mr. Villiers may best judge whether I have
spoken idly, or am likely to offer what I cannot perform.
But I must not trespass on you longer." And O'Foggarty
once more rose, and his eye turned to an organ which
had just been placed in one of the recesses in the library.

allowed to touch this instrument?" And without waiting
for permission, he opened it, and ran his fingers over a
few keys, and nen, while he fixed his eyes upon Villiers's
face, he suffered the notes to sink into  soft gentle
plaintive strain, at the sound of which Villiers fell back in
his chair, and gasped for breath : it was the hymn to the
Virgin.
" You know all, then," cried Villiers.
restore him to me.-Have mercy upon me!"
But O'Foggarty's face had once more assumed its
look of surprise and vagueness. "I fear," he said, " that
I have agitated Mr. Villiers, by recalling to him painful
associations. I should have been glad of some better
opportunity to lay before him the cause for which I have
ineffectually pleaded. Might I hope for permission to
wait on you to-morrow; or may I even now return with
the satisfaction of knowing that we shall experience
from Mr. Villiers, not enrnity, but friendship ? Shall I
leave you with this list of subscriptions to our poor chapel!

hand ; and a bystander might have seen a faint smile
of triumph derange the composure of his features.

sap the principle of resistance, and he will fall
wholly into our hands." And he waited for Villiers's
reply.
But Villiers rose from his chair; he folded  the
paper without looking at it, replaced it in O'Foggarty's
hand, and requesting him to be seated again, he stood
before him, and said, with a firm voice,
"I wish, sir, to express to you once more, firmly and

openly, and in a manner which I trust will preclude any
further solicitation on the subject, that I can offer no
assistance whatever to your religious operations in this
country. Whether the words which you have uttered,
and which have, indeed, awakened in me painful and
bitter recollections, bear in them any deeper meaning, I
will leave to your own conscience. Your system scruples
not to sever the allegiance of subjects from their sove.
reign, and to make your co-operation in preserving the
peace of nations and the order of society conditional upon
the extension of favor to your cause from governments,
who cannot favor it without compromising their own
religious faith. It would, therefore, be little strange,
that as you deal between the subject and the sovereign,
so you should deal between a father and his child ;" (and
Villiers's voice faltered). " Whether such conduct be
worthy of a ministry of heaven-whether it be an evi.
dence of truth--whether it must not confirm those who
abhor deceit and wrong in offering their most strenuous
resistance to such a system, may be left for your own con-
sideration. I cannot look to it for any aid. I must trust
to heaven alone. We must part, sir, at once ; and I
trust never more to be exposed to solicitations like the
present upon any pretence whatever."
Villiers rang the bell, ordered Mr. O'Foggarty's

certed visiter ; but ten minutes after, when the servant
entered the room, he was found stretched upon the floor,
insensible.
O'Foggarty knew nothing of this. The gig in which
he had been driven to the Priory was waiting at the door,
and in a short time he re-entered his own house in the
town by the same little green garden door which has
more than once been mentioned already. Adjoining to
this, and within the garden, was a small tenement, seem-
ingly uninhabited. And to this the priest bent his way,
and knocking gently at the door of it, was admitted by
some one from the inside into a small but not comfortless
apartment. "So you are returned at last ? " was the
greeting which awaited him from a coarse, smooth-shaven

garty to the inmate of the little mansion, in whom the
reader, without requiring any assistance from us, will
probably recognize Mr. Pearce.
Pearce laughed bitterly. "I told you," he said"I
told them-I told them from the first ; and yet they will
still persist in hoping to secure hin. And now I am
ordered off, and you are to try your smooth words and
persuasive arts, as if they would do any good."
"We must not judge," said the priest, blandly, " by
a singe failure on the first attempt.
The aspect of
things is so different from what it was, and you yourself
have been so compromised and mixed up with this late
business in the Forest, that you must allow the necessity
of withdrawing for a time at least."
"Yes," cried Pearce, sulkily, " I could not well walk
about the streets just yet, and shall not be sorry to be re-
leased from this miserable prison here. But what did
he say?"
And O'Foggarty proceeded to recount all that had
passed between himself and Villiers.

" Yes," replied O'Foggarty ; " and he evidently
felt it."
" And he knows that you know ?"
"Evidently."
" But you did not commit yourself? You did not say
anything that he could take hold of ?" said Pearce.
The other only replied by a contemptuous smile.
"You imagine, I fear, Mr. Pearce, that no one under-
stands these matters but yourself; and yet, perhaps,
there are gentle modes of proceeding more efficacious
than even murder and rebellion."
Pearce moved as if stung to the quick by the sug.

no one dreamed of any other end than has happened.
And we have gained all we wanted, and shall gain
more. Is not the ministry going out? Is not parliament
to be dissolved ?"
" And you will add, I suppose," said O'Foggarty, " Is
not a good blow struck against the parliament church
in Hawkstone? Has your emissary, the printer, been
here to-day?"
" Yes," replied Pearce. "I have given him another
handbill; and I do not think the poor parson will stand
it much longer. They must go to his bishop, and there
must be an inquiry; and he cannot purge himself."
" And have you sent the paragraphs to the papers ?"
"I have," said Pearce, " with capital letters and ini-
tials, and all that. No one can mistake it. The penny
newspapers
will have the whole story at full length."
"Remember," said O'Foggarty, looking grave and
conscientious, " this is entirely an act of your own. It
is no business of mine to throw a scandal even upon a
Protestant and heretic  but if you think it will aid the
Pearce looked with ill-disguised contempt upon his
companion, and then he said, " You do not mean to hint,
do you, Mr. O'Foggarty, that you have any scruple about
throwing dirt where dirt will stick, if it is our object,
and the interest of our cause, that it should stick ?
We
were not used in former days to be so very strait-laced
and particular. Do you affect to regret, if that poor
Bentley should be driven from his parish, and the field
thrown more open to yourself, and your own rigid sanctity
and unimpeachable virtue" (and Pearce smiled bitterly)
" be favoraby contrasted with his peccadilloes, and a
bad name light upon all that he belongs to ? Do you
object to this?"
O'Foggarty affected to look indifferent, but his eyes
twinkled with thought of the advantage which might be
taken of the situation in which Bentley had become
involved.
" I rather think," continued Pearce, " that it is not
one of our maxims to abstain from such legitimate means
of defence and annoyance."

O'Foggarty looked grave. "I cannot," he said,
"interfere to prevent you from doing what you think
may be beneficial to the good cause."
Pearce again smiled in scorn. "No!" he said, " the
Church generally has not scrupled to make use of our
assistance, even when openly she pretended to reprobate
our acts. Where would Rome have been but for our arm?
And how could our arm have saved her, if we had listen.
ed to the old wives' superstitions about means and ends?
All means are justified by good ends ; and all ends are
good which benefit the one great cause.
I think even the
Catholic rector of Hawkstone is a little indebted to us."
" The title is rather premature, is it not ?" said
O'Foggarty ; but he could not avoid smiling at the sound.
" Bah !" exclaimed Pearce, contemptuously ; " you
smooth-faced, soft-speaking gentlemen always think
every thing premature. If we had trusted to such as
you, should we have now our bishops in Ireland, ay, and
our rectors too, and our bishops recognised in an act of
parliament, in the teeth of another act which expressly
forbids it? How was this done but by courage ? You
fancied the Conservative ministers were bold and honest.
We knew them to be cowards; and that with all their
fine speeches, and conditions, and precautions, when they
passed the Emancipation Act, they would not dare to
enforce their own penalties. They served to gull the
people ; and that was all Sir Robert wanted. Ask him
or the Duke now to expel the unlicensed Jesuits, or pro-
secute a Catholic bishop for taking his own title ; and
hear what he would say--though it was his own bill, and
his own promise to the fools who trusted in him."
" I suppose he would say," answered the other sar-
castically, " that the times were alteredthat it was
necessary to legislate according to circumstances-that
however solemnly he had pledged his word at the time,
he had not meant to preclude himself from modifying his
opinions as events occurredthat it is idle to resist the
current of general opinionthat to rule a liberalized
.nation, rulers must themselves be liberalized that he
really could not commit himself to a general principle---

and that he was an honest man and a great statesman,
and had reduced the Three and a half per cents, and
therefore-
" And therefore the people must trust him," interrupl..
ed Pearce. "Bah! for a set of fools! Why the Tories,
or Conservatives as they call them, have done more for
us than all the Whigs put together."
Yes," replied O'Foggarty, "the Irish education
scheme, enlarged grant to Maynooth, endowments in
Ireland, bishops in the Colonies, national education in
England, -all tell for us. And now they talk of their
new liberal colleges in Ireland, as if they had never heard
of us, or knew that to found a liberal college was the first
step to putting it into the hands of the Jesuits. I wonder
if any one of them ever heard a syllable of our history,
or knew how we managed to make our way into them."
Pearce joined in the laugh. "No," he said, " do not
be afraid of being premature. Call yourself at once what
you ought to be. Have your letters directed to you
The Catholic Rector of Hawkstone.' It will compel
that poor old paralytic to call himself the Protestant
rector ; and then any one will be able to see that the
Catholic must be the true, and the Protestant the false
one--any one who has learned his creed. Think what
this one word has done for us--how by using words of
this kind exclusively, and allowing them to no other, we
have prospered already."
The other smiled assent.
" Then," continued Pearce, " build up your chapel
with a tower; have a ring of bells in it. It stands well
just in the market-place. Every one will ask what it
is. Make them call it a church, or, rather, the church
-the Catholic church of Hawkstone ; and when you
speak of the other old building, call it the chapel, or, if
you like, the conventicle. Keep your bells ringing from
morning to night. It is not allowed by law, but who
will dare to say any thing ? People will ask what it
means; and the answer will be that you are at prayers
-three, or seven times a daynot twice in the week
only, as elsewhere."

"My suggestions," answered Pearce, "are very well
worth attending to; and indeed they are not mine-
* Sed qu prcepit Ofellus,

:
No! abnormis sapiens is rather too strong for us ; but
do not mind taking advice. Was it not my advice that
you should get your chapel of a good handsome style-
not like the barns, and sheds, and tawdry meeting houses,
which the establishment has been raising, at 12001. a
piece. People come to look ; and then they admire ; and
then you say that it is the old Catholic stylethe true
Christian architecture; and that you alone possess it ;
and that the design was given by a Catholic--if a con-
vert, so much the better; and that you (mind and lay a
stress upon you) do not like to build a church of that
which cost you nothing. It is astonishing how this tells."
O'Foggarty smiled.

persons who show it kneel down when they enter. If
you are there yourself, do not chatter and laugh, like the
Protestants, as they walk about the aisles of their cathe.

Mind and attend all the public meetings, and speak cha-
ritably, religiously, but, above all, liberally. Sigh over
the distractions of the Church. If you can find any
young men from Oxford, get acquainted with them; lend
them booksfirst Fnlon and Pascal, then Bonaventure,
Liguori, and books like that. Show them your Sisters
of Charity. Deal with them moderately and quietly:
Abjure all images and superstitions. Talk of faith, and
unity, and peace, and the feudal times, and loyalty, and
the middle ages-all that's romantic, you know. They
do not know anything about it, and will swallow all that
you tell them. By-and-by, perhapswho knows ?-you
may even get up a miracle." But the last suggestion
was stated rather too coarsely and broadly for the more
refined subtilty of O'Foggarty, and he moved as if in
disgust.
* Ah!" said Pearce, "you affect to be shocked.
But I ask you honestly-here we are, between ourselves
-am I advising you anything which is not practicable
and practised ? Is not this the way in which we have
prospered hitherto ?"
O'Foggarty could say nothing.
"I do think," continued Pearce, "that some have
managed things rather stupidly. When they celebrate
high mass, they have it placarded over the town, like a
bill of the play; foreign singers Mr. So-and-so to pre-
side at the organ; seats three shilings, two shillings, one
shilling; doors open at eleven o'clock; the Bishop of
Negroland, that stupendous orator, to preach. Now
Protestants sometimes do this ; but I do not think it
sounds well-it is too barefaced. And another

" Yes," said the other. "I stayed at Oxford myself,
nor long since, for a few days, and was surprised to find
how i was fted, and embraced, and questioned ; and how
ready they were to fly into one's arms."
Not many ?
y?" said Pearce.
No, not many," replied O'Foggarty,"a little set,
about half a dozen."
And mere boys ?"
" Mere boys, who had just taken their degrees."
Learned ?" asked Pearce. "Did they know any
thing about us ?"
* Learned!" repeated O'Foggarty.  Bah!" and
they both joined in a hearty laugh. "I would get hold
of a newspaper," said Pearce,"a Whig one would do
all you wanted. Since O'Connell helped them, it is as-
tonishing how popish they are becoming. You may
throw a little dirt, if you like, now and then, where it is
wanted to stick. But I think niore is done by praising
yourselves. Get up good accounts of your festivals
and processions. You have picked up ten or a dozen
old men and women, who subscribe a penny a week.
and you make a confraternity of them for honoring the
memory of St. Bridget, or saying vespers at the altar
of St. Winifred, or devoting themselves to the service
and honor of the blessed martyr Saint Any-body.
Well! you fix a day for the festival, wash out the school-
room, stick up some laurel-leaves in it, dress the poor
people up in their finery, get together as many priests as
you can, and if possible a bishop, and have service. The
next day comes out a paragraph in the paper, headed in
large type, 'Celebrations of the Catholic Church.

phus, the largest church which has been built since the
Reformation, was celebrated the solemn Festival of the
blessed and devoted martyr So-and-So. Early in the
morning the inhabitants were called to their devotions
by the splendid peal of bells from that magnificent tower,
which has been raised at a vast expense, and may fairly
be considered a model of true Catholic architecture. At

bring in the venerated Bishop of Negroland, or whoever
else it may be. Always call your bishops venerable,
and learned, and holy prelates of the Church, martyrs,
and the like. O'Connell does this, you observe. He
kneels down before them in the dirt, and asks their
blessing. It tells wonderfully at a distance. When he
speaks of them, you would expect to see angels, or saints
worn away with fasting, eyes dim with watching, lips
that never speak but in words of peace and blessing.
He talks of them and of the Irish priests, as if they
were his idols, and no one could see them without ado.

And O'Foggarty could not resist the laugh, in which
Pearce joined.

stand it. As for the rest, you can easily manage it.

" Then," said O'Foggarty, with a smile, "you would
not recommend that we should do as they do in Ireland,
and hold a reform dinner in the chapel itself, with the
altar turned into a side-board, and the font into a
wine-cooler ?"
" No," said Pearce, " this would not do in England.
But they may do what they like in Ireland. People here
believe nothing they hear of it."
" No," replied O'Foggarty ; " I heard some one in
Oxford mention this very fact in the set with whom I was
staying ; and they turned up their noses, and declared
that it was false, it must be falsethough the relater saw
it with his own eyes."
" It is a blessed thing for us," said Pearce, "that
they are so unbelieving-otherwise awkward things
would come out. They do work rather too strongly in
Ireland. They manage their election matters, and
their repeal rent, and their politics, rather too coarsely.
We must contrive things with more gentleness in
England."
"We need not fear," said O'Foggarty. "Froin what
I saw in Oxford, if a very demon were to rise up
before
them, and call himself the Pope, they would be ready to
call him an angel, and deny their own senses, and the
senses of others too."
" Because they have got a fancy, and do not choose to
bave it disturbed-is that it?"
" Yes," said O'Foggarty.
" Have any
of them been abroad?" asked Pearce.
" Not that I know of, " answered OFoggarty.
"Somebody has told themthis is their general answer
-or they have read about it in Fnlon or Paschal ; or
they cannot find what they want in their own Church ;
and if
you ask them what they do want, they cannot tell ;
only it must be something exciting, fervent, enthusi-
astic, romantic, and picturesque,-something unlike the
common."
Pearce grinned a malicious smile.
" And they talk about the fathers, do n't they?" he
asked.

come forward and vouch for the statements which the
rest take from them; just as in the advertisement of a
quack medicine, the person cured is always ready to give
his name, if required."
Pearce once more laughed heartily, " A hopeful set.
I must say ; but if they love us so much, why do they nei
come over to us?"
"Ay," said O'Foggarty," that is a mystery; they say
they are waitingthat they cannot come without others
that they must take their religion from their fathers,
and do as their conscience tells them."
Pearce once more laughed, but more loudly than
before, " And will any of them come soon, do you
think?"
"I am sure I cannot say," said O'Foggarty. "They
seem to be out of their senses. If they believed the Pope's
authority, they would come over at once, for they could
not think of remaining out of the pale of salvation ; and
if they believed their own Church, they would not
acknowledge the Pope's, and thus they would not think
of coming to Rome. But some one has told them that the
oath which says that the Pope neither has nor ought to
have any jurisdiction in this realm of England, means
only that he has none as a fact, and that the ought' is
an expletive ; and so, perhaps, they imagine that they
can remain in the English Church, and yet acknowledge
the supremacy of Rome, and that the English Church
says nothing of the Romish in this, as in other points, but
what any clergyman who accepts the thirty-nine Articles
may heartily subscribe to."
O'Foggarty spoke gravely, and Pearce did not laugh;
for even he was surprised, and felt something like disgust.
" And after all, then," he said, " they are only the
merest Protestants, thinking and acting without any guide
or authority whatever, mere Dissentersin fact, private.

They are blind men," answered OFoggarty, "fol-
lowing their own noses ; and this they call faith."
" You must get some converts soon," said Pearce, " in
this place. It tells wonderfully."
66 There is old Mrs. Dennett," replied the other.
"who keeps the little apple-stall at the corner of
King's Street. I have talked to her a good deal.
She is an Irishwoman, and a Catholic, but married a
heretic soldier, and for years has gone to Church. I
think she will come round soon. She is very poor ; and
I have offered her to sweep out the chapel."
" Yes," said Pearce ; "and you must get an account
of it into the papers--the Irish papers especially, and
those which are at a distance; but even close here it
does not uch matter what you say, for no one takes the
trouble to read or believe the contradiction of a bold
statement once put forward well. You must head it-
Conversions to the Catholic Church. Something of this
kind : The Progress of Divine Truth has been singularly
and almost miraculously manifested in this district, under
che sacred ministrations of the Rev. P. O'Foggarty,
Catholic pastor, or, if you like it, rector, of the parish.
On Sunday last a venerable lady was received into the
bosom of the Church with the usual ceremonies. The
Bishop of Eliopolis preached an admirable sermon on
this interesting occasion. The solemn choir service was
under the direction of the talented Mr. Simpson, assisted
by a large and extensive body of performers. The holy
building was thronged with a fashionable and influential
congregation, among whom were many Protestants of
rank, who evinced deep sympathy and admiration.'
Then in the London papers you may put something of this
kind : "We understand that a late important conversion
to the Catholic Church has caused the greatest sensation
in a town not a hundred miles from Hawkstone. The
lady in question is whispered to be of high rank and
immense wealth, as well as the most unquestionable piety
and talent. It is understood that her return to the true
faith has been caused by her dissatisfaction with the
secularity and false principles of the Protestant communion

scruples were infused into her mind by reading, not the
Tracts for the Times, and other works of the Oxford
school, but some sernions of a celebrated vicar of a certain
large manufacturing town, whose name begins with H
and ends with k.'
O'Foggarty could not help smiling. "And what is
the good of this ?" he asked.
Pearce regarded him with a sneer.  You who are
to manage matters in my place," he said"you to ask
the good of this! In the first place, does it not give to
us importance and dignity, and the appearance of success?
and success will soon find followers. Secondly, does it
not encourage our friends ? Thirdly, does it not terrify
the Protestants, and especially the wild Protestants of
Ireland ? Fourthly, does it not drive them into more
extravagance, and more violent abuse of all that we hold ,
and does not this expose them to make false statements,
and thus to ridicule and refutation ? And has any thing
fed and supported us more than the follies of what they
call low Church and ultra-Protestantism? Fifthly, does
it not dishearten those who are still lingering half way,
and prepare them to come over ? Sixthly, does it not
throw suspicion upon our worst and most dangerous
enemies, if their principles are shown to be the cause of
these conversions to us?"
"But why fix on Dr. H.?" asked O'Foggarty.
" Why not on the Tracts for the Times?"
Pearce again smiled sarcastically. "Because," he
replied, " those who put out the Tracts for the Times are
now doing us effectual service; and the less said of them
the better. We must throw suspicion only on those who
are resolved to oppose us, of whom there is no hope, who
will fight against us to the last. Once we thought this

was to be the case with the tract writers; but now they
have thrown off the mask, if they ever wore one, and are
letting their followers run straight forward into our arms
without a word to call them back, or with such a word as
only encourages them to advance by showing how far
they can go, and how near they may approach us, and
yet not leave their own warm shelter: that is, how they
may remain as Catholics, and serve the Pope, while they
are members and even ministers of the English Church.
If they had been ourselves they could not have managed
their plans more cleverly for us, or played more adroitly
into our hands. No, let us say nothing of them."
" And you would not, then," said O'Foggarty, "re.
commend any controversy with these?"
No," replied Pearce, " nor yet with the others. It
is not safe. Development will not go down with these
last, as it will with the young ones in Oxford. They
explode it at once as mere rationalism; and it is not safe
to appeal to the fathers. Even W. made a mistake when
he got on this ground, and was sadly shown up for his
quotations and references. It damaged us terribly. It
you will have controversy, let it be with some hot-headed,
zealous, low Churchman-that poor wretch Bentley for
instance, who knows nothing of history, and professes to
fight with the Bible, and the Bible only, in his hand.
You are sure of driving him into absurdities; for it must
end in his either declaring that every one in the world,
man, woman, or child, learned or ignorant, good or bad,
is able to extract from the Bible by his own eyes the one
truth which it contains, and has a right to judge the Bible
by his own reason, which is just what all the infidels in
the world contend for; and so he will preach infidelity
and this will pave the way for us; or else he must ac-
knowledge the need of some authority to interpret and
communicate the one truthand he knows, and his people
know, of none but ours : any other they have suffered to
be so long out of sight that they fancy it does not exist."
" You are profound," said O'Foggarty"much more
profound than those would imagine who have only seen
you in your red shock hair and
your
butcher's apron."

" I have my wits about me," replied Pearce, other-
wise those who sent me here would not have trusted me.
And the advice which I have offered you is the best
which you can have. But it is getting late, and my
things must be packed. Did you take my place in the
night coach?"
"Yes; I said that Mrs. Rogers would be there, at
the corner of the street, five minutes before starting.
And as it will be dark, you can muffle up your face for
the toothache, and wrap up in this plaid cloak, and no
one will see you.
I have a pair of pattens," laughed Pearce, "and a
cotton umbrella, and a black bonnet. I think I shall do
-do," he continued, " better than you will. Be assured
all their hopes are vain; with all your cajoleries and
softness, you will do nothing here with him. You may
flatter him, but he will despise you; you may make him
suspected and abused for a Papist, as he will be called
by all the luw Churchmen round about, but this will not
tonch bim  he will remain firm as a rock, take my word
for it, and will do you infinite mischief. He should be
dealt with in a very different way." And Pearce, as he
uttered the words, stammered and coughed; and O'Fog-
garty looked grave and sombre, and shrunk back from
his companion's touch.
** Ay, Mr. O'Foggarty," said Pearce, after a pause ;
" when you read more of our books you will be less
sensitive and fastidious. If a good object is to be gained,
we must not falter and stick at the means. I think this
is sound doctrine-our doctrine-is it not?"
But his companion remained silent. 6 You take the
boy with you," he then asked, " from London?"
"Yes," replied Pearce. " He is safely lodged there
with Connell; and I shall carry him abroad with me.
Time will come round when I shall be wanted again

" It is cruel, is it not," said the other, " to take a
boy from his father in this way?"
" Cruel!" exclaimed Pearce, "cruel!" and he ground
his teeth. " They have allowed meand if they had

But he checked himself, and drawing his chair
close to O'Foggarty, who shrank back at his approach,

Did you ever taste ithow sweet it is, how luscious ?
And he looked into O'Foggarty's eye with such a glare
of malignity that the other drew back again from his
companion in fear and horror.
" Tell them," continued Pearce, " tell them that I
will have my revenge. If I can have it by serving them,

them to understand it."
" I will tell them all which you wish to have told,"
said O'Foggarty, rising, and apparently desirous of ex
tricating himself from any longer conversation with so
painful a companion.

gether by certain mysterious ties in the prosecution of
one mysterious work, there was neither cordiality nor real
confidence between them; and shaking hands coldly,
they bade each other farewell. Two hours after, at the
end of the lane, the heavy Highflyer coach stopped to
take up Mrs. Rogers, who, wrapped up in a huge plaid
cloak, and shrouded in a black bonnet and green veil,
appeared with pattens in one hand and a cotton umbrella
in another, anxiously superintending the disposition of a
large holland-covered package on the top of the coach,
and then, without saying a word, ensconced herself in a
dark corner of the vehicle out of the glare of the lamps.
" You have not caught him yet ?" said the coachman
to a policeman who was standing by the door.

" Who?" asked the guard, familiarly.
" Why the fellow that used to walk about in the
butcher's frock, with the red hairthe man who had
to do with the riots-PetersPearce-what was his
name?" The policeman shook his head, the guard took
up his horn, and, to the sound of "Rule Britannia," the
well-appointed, well-packed coach rolled off with a cheer-
ful rumble over Hawkstone Bridge, and out of the town,
on its way to London.
CHAPTER XIV.
We may now pass, by means of that secret key which
opens every lock, and which none but authors possess,
into the back parlor of Mr. Lomax's counting-house.
The reader will observe the front of the mansion itsell,
newly decorated with stucco mouldings and iron railings
the adjoining house converted into the office, to ac.
commodate the expansion of so respectable and thriving
a business. Within all is newclerks, some pert and
consequential, others grave and confidential, perched up
on their lofty stools, with pens in their ears, behind new
shining mahogany desks polished with French varnish;
machines for weighing letters and sovereigns ; subscrip-
tion-books open on the counter ; mysterious drawers, out
of which astonished eyes see sovereigns ladled carelessly
by handfuls, and bank-notes grasped by fifties and hun-
dreds, just as if they were only silver-paperthe whole
a very mine of wealth. How many needy visitors trem-
bled, as they pushed aside the green baize folding-doors,
and faced the ministers of the sanctuary !

street, ---- O, that I were a banker !"
We pass through this outer room into another still
larger and darker, with more clerks, more mahogany
desks, more drawers full of sovereigns and bank-notes.

Beyond is a veiled glass door, and we are ushered into
the private parlor of the great country banker himself.
Mr. Lomax is there, his bald head shining on the other
side of a green table; his face not destitute of intelligence,
but indented with lines of care ; his features neither coarse
nor refined, neither vulgar nor.gentlemanly-something
between them both,-a specimen of the middle classes ;
and his eye keenly scanning each person as he enters,
as if to gauge the contents of his pocket, and the honesty
of his promises. And yet, in some way or other, if that
eye was met by another, it failed to stand the glance,
and generally took refuge elsewhere. And Mr. Lomax
was also subject to a nervousness-a little twitching of
the mouth and hand. He had been subject to it for some
time. The arrival of the po would bring it on-the
sight of a strange face, sometimes even reading the
newspaper. But it was only a trifle-scarcely to be
named, as a drawback to his enviable and influential
position in Hawkstone-as the monied man, to whom
farmer and landlord, manufacturer and shopkeeper, were
all obliged to resort in their respective difficulties-be-
fore whom all the little aristocracy of Hawkstone bowed
downwhom even Lord Claremont had condescended
to visit, preparatory to effecting a mortgage-whose notes
passed current as those of the Bank of Englandwhose
wife was the lady-patroness of the townwhose daugh-
ters the belles of its society,whose very name, in the
eyes of the multitude, was synonymous for credit and for
wealth.
Mr. Lomax was not alone ; his table was surrounded
by six or seven heads, among whom, as the newspapers
word it, we distinguished the lite of the respectable pro-
(essional inhabitants of the town,-Mr. Robertson, the
late perennial mayor before the Reform Bill passed; Mr.
Atkinson, the solicitor; Mr. Morgan, the surgeon ; Cap-
tain Iancock ; Mr. Brown, the great miller. And
just as we enter, Mr. Atkinson is in the act of shaking
hands with Charles Bevan himself, whose presence seems
to have caused in the whole group considerable surprise,
but not a little satisfaction.

"I scarcely expected to see you here," said Mr.
Morgan.
" Why not ?" asked Bevan.
" Because I thought your new Oxford notions would
not allow you to take any interest in politics."
Really," answered Bevan, "I cannot profess to de-
fine what you mean by Oxford notions ; but for myself,
I think it one of the first duties of a clergyman to take a
part in politics-not, I mean, in a mere struggle for place
and power, which is too often called politics, but in
the practical duties of a citizen. The state has give me
a vote for a member of parliament, and I intend to ex-
ercise it, as I hope for the good of the country. I scarcely
know circumstances in which the voice of the clergy may
be so needed, and may do such good, as in a popular
election,"
The little party seemed rather unwilling to enter into
the abstract discussion ; and Bevan therefore took his
chair, and prepared to listen while Mr. Atkinson drew
up his thick ill-folded white neckcloth, and proceeded to
open the business of the meeting.
Mr. Atkinson, the gentleman in the brown kersey-
inere pantaloons and gaiters, in the black ill-made coat
and waistcoat, with the long gold watch chain dangling
from his waistband, the grizzled hair, the grave, sallow,
thoughtful, and reserved countenance, which, however,
when called on, as he constantly was called, to direct
the politics of Hawkstone, assumed even a degree of
elevation and warmth, and exhibited considerable tact
and self-command, and knowledge of the world, Mr
Atkinson, as must be known to any one who has been
within a hundred miles of Hawkstone, was a first-rate
country solicitor, a man of unquestionable probity, of
singular influence, looked up to by all his clients with a
mixture of awe and regard, one who strictly fulfilled the
duties of his position, an attentive husband, a father who
worked hard to provide for his ten children, a staunch
supporter of the Church, a man of irreproachable charac-
ter, and the most important member of the Conservative
party in Hawkstone. And, by his advice, the leaders of

the same Conservative party were now assembled in Mr.
Lonax's back parlor, to see what could be done at the last
moment (for Conservatives usually wait till the last mo.
ment) to arrest the fearful progress of events, which
threatened to install Mr. Marmaduke Brook, the radical,
in the chair of the member for Hawkstone, by the hands
of Mrs. Maddox and a host of dissenting allies.
Their anxiety had been not a little increased by the
late events in the Forest, and by the alarm which had
been caused by the revelations to which it had given
rise. They felt like men who were sitting on a barrel
of gunpowder, knowing that a match was burning near
it, but unable to discover where. "In such times," said
Mr. Lomax, " it became every one who valued the peace
of society, and that which is the object of society,
the preservation of property and credit, to come forward
boldly, and stand by the institutions of his country.
And the obvious step in the power of the Conservatives
of Hawkstone, was to procure the return of a Con-
servative member for the borough on
occasion.
It must be confessed their means were not ample, nor
their cause hopeful. Hawkstone, before the Reform
Bill, had been a notorious horough,-notorious for
the silence, ease, and certainty, with which any two
gentlemen recommended to the worthy electors, that is to
the mayor and corporation, by the government for the
time being, were sure of conforming themselves in a
wonderful way to the sympathies and tastes of all the
electors, and of obtaining their unanimous suffrages
without even asking for them personally. It was noto-
rious also for the excellent turbot and delicious venison
which smoked on the mayor's table twice or thrice a year,
and on General Villiers's as often as he chose to put
himself to the trouble of entertaining, at the Priory, his
accommodating friends and neighbors, and of suggesting
to them that Sir William Booth, the Secretary to the Ad.
miralty, and the Honorable Mr. Murphy, the new Lord
of the Treasury, would be fit and proper representatives
for the horough of Hawkstone. It was notorious also

for the singular facility with which nephews, and cousins,
and brothers, and brothers-in-law, of the corporate body
of Hawkstone, obtained various official situations, as
tide-waiters, clerks, custom-house officers, and the like.
And General Villiers's banking account also exhibited
about once in every three or four years, synchronising
with the dissolution of parliament, a large, mysterious,
but very acceptable item, which to the steward of the
General's estates must have seemed to have dropped
from the clouds.
These, as old Di. Grant, the paralytic rector, used
-nournfully to say, were the good old times--the times of
peace and order, before the torrent of innovation had
begun to menace and sweep away the throne and the
altar, and when Hawkstone lay in blessed repose under
the shade of its ancient institutions. It must, indeed, be
confessed, that, however favorable this shade had been to
the physical growth of the members of the corporation,
and to the pecuniary growth of General Villiers's balance
at his banker's, other things had also sprung up and
flourished under it, which even the corporation them-
selves could not but regard as troublesome fungi. Nor
had the altar, typified by the old grey church, or the
throne, symbolised by the mayor's gilt mace, and the
constable's brass-knobbed staff of office, escaped some.

opinion in all political matters, and especially in the
exercise of the elective franchise, corresponded with the
most undeviating punctuality with the opinions of the
General  Dr. Grant continued, year after year, to preach
his well-arranged cycle of compilations from Blair ; to
diminish gradually the number of services which he
found himself unable to perform without a curate ; to
celebrate marriages, and funerals, and baptisms, with all
decent regularity, to visit the sick when he was sent for,
and the school on the day of examination ; and to give
away his pounds of roast beef at Christmas, and his sub.
scriptions to all ordinary charities, with most lecent

regularity. But meanwhile, pew after pew, however
comfortably arranged, lined with green or red, padded
with cushions, curtained from observation, fell each Sun-
day into a state of emptiness. One after another families
dropped off from their attendance, and others sprang up
who never had attended ; and Dr. Grant was wonder-
struck, and provoked, and exasperated, as he passed by
the new streets in the suburbs, to see bricklayers, with
the inost irritating assiduity, engaged in raising conve-
nient, neat-sashed, slate-roofed, galleried, gas-lighted
structures, and decorating them with two round pillars at
the door, and a portentous inscription on the pediment,-

Church, and attachment to its system, only they pro-
tested against taking part in its services or obeying its

not ill-informed, but which, to Mr. Robertson's great
surprise, instead of undertaking the defence of the throne
and the altar, and eulogising the ancient institutions of
the town, under the motto of " Things as they are,"
adopted, to the infinite disgust of the corporation, a
totally different course. One week came a complaint
against the town-clerk's fees; another brought a remon-
strance against the paving and lighting tax ; then came a
sneer at the head-constable ; then actually an attack upon
the mayor; then words w re bani'ied about of corruption,

bribery, truckling, sycophancy, roguery,--all aimed at
the mayor and corporation. Then followed a denun-
ciation of church-rates; then a call to a public meeting ;
then petitions for reform ; then large assemblages of the
non-electors of Hawkstone in the great room at the Bell,
with speeches, and pamphlets, and placards. At last
three or four of the most influential of the malcontents,
including two dissenting ministers, and Mr. Smith, the
manufacturer, a recent arrival, were seen one fine morn-
ing in a mysterious group on the outside of the Highflyer
coach, hastening up to London ; and, to the mayor and
corporation's surprise and consternation, not unmixed
with anger and contempt, their namnes appeared the
next day in the newspapers as important delegates from
the borough of Hawkstone, who had met to consult with
other oppressed individuals in other boroughs similarly
situated, by what means they might be relieved from
their disgraceful thraldom, as a borough-ridden and cor-
ruption-haunted people. These were but the mutterings
of the stormthe first big drops of the thunder-shower.
At last the cloud burst over the devoted heads of the
mayor and corporation, and the Reform Bill fell upon
them like a thunderbolt.
From the dismay and prostration which this blow
had inflicted on them, the Tory party of Hawkstone-a
few and scattered minority-was just beginning to re-
cover; and Mr. Atkinson was at their head. But
Tories they dared call themselves no longer. Was it
conscience? Was it fear? Was it that an alias was
necessary to escape from the memory of past peccadil.
loes? Had they really become enlightened to the anti-
quated character of their former principles? Or had
they in truth even before had no principles at all-nothing
but the name of Tory, to denote that portion of the con-
stituency who partook of General Villiers's annual hos-
pitality? Whatever was the cause, the name of Tory was
discreetly merged and sunk in the new-coined title of
Conservative. What the precise nature of Conserva.
lism was, no one professed to define. When old Mr.
Roberston was charged with being a Tory, he anxiously

repudiated the accusation. When he was taxed with
Liberalism, he writhed his mouth in disgust. When
asked what he was, he could only say that he was some-
thing betwixt and betweenneither one nor the other.
66 Medio tutissimus ibis" was his motto. He trusted to
Mr. Atkinson; and Mr. Atkinson, though he did not
think it worth while to develope his whole sentiments
or policy to his party, partly because they would prob.
ably rebel, and partly because he thought they had not
wit to understand him, and must consent to follow him
blindfold, or fall a victim to the enemy, cherished his
theory in secret, having borrowed it from high sources,
and confirmed it by due meditation on his practical ex.
perience of life.
Mr. Atkinson prided himself on being an honest
man; and although so long as a dishonest system had
been firmly established under the good old days, he had
not thought it necessary either to remonstrate against or
alter it, now that the corruption had been openly de-
nounced and overturned, he felt that it had been wrong,
and not easily defensible. He therefore resolved at once,
nobly and generously, to give up what it was impossible
that he could any longer retain, and submitted, with a
smiling face and conciliating submission, to the transfer
of the empire of Ilawkstone from the mayor and cor-
poration to the ten-pound freeholders. Nor was he con.
tent with submission. He actually professed readiness
to co-operate with the new system ; and even went be-
yond the authors of the change, who had endeavored to
beguile their opponents by declaring that it was no change
at all, only an expansion of existing institutions; and
himself announced that it was a change, a total alter-
ation, a transfer of supreme power from the king to the
people ; and that though the constitution was destroyed
by it, he would henceforth willingly acquiesce in it, and
proceed to carry out the new principles to their full ex-
tent, though with due caution and slowness. The poor
ex-mayor looked on him with alarm ; Captain Hancock,
who still remained a Tory, shrugged his shoulders ;
Charles Beran gave him vip in despair. But Mr. Smith,

the manufacturer, shook hands most amicably with his
former fue ; and the dissenting ministers even toasted
his health, and smiled significantly among themselves,
when Mr. Atkinson endeavored to infuse into the still-
reluctant members of the corporation his own newly-
developed liberality. They accepted, not indeed very
gratefully or courteously, but as instalments, the many
little pieces of patronage and privileges which Mr. At
kinson blandly placed at their disposal in the town, some
times without consulting the mayor, to whom they pro-
perly belonged. Pearce was Mr. Atkinson's ohject.
The popular current," he said, "could not be resisted.
There was a law of fatality in boroughs as in empires,
by which they must slide by degrees from monarchies
into democracies ; and it was the part of the wise and
prudent statesman not to provoke opposition by resist-
ance, but to accomodate himself to the stream-happy
only if he could prevent the ancient institutions from
being pulled down in a riot, by undertaking to remove
them himself, trowel in hand, brick by brick, and beam
by beam." In this gradual and slow removal Mr. At.
kinson was now busily engaged. Why the ancient in.
stitutions should be allowed to stand-why it might be
the wisdom and duty of a statesman even to risk a battle
in their defence, he had never thought. They were ob-
noxious to public opinion; and public opinion was his
only test of truth. And as fame, popular famethe fame
of being an admirable town-clerk of Hawkstone, of man-
aging its parties adroitly so as to prevent collision, of
improving its finances, and reducing its debt,was the
darling object of the practical solicitor's ambition, he
looked only to the increase of his reputation with the
councillors of the north ward, or the majority of liberal
aldermen, and rejoiced in obtaining the reluctant and
even sneering applause of the radical
newspapers,
who
congratulated him on his enlightened views, or conde-
scendingly contrasted his enlarged policy with the dull
bigotry of his ignorant predecessors.
And yet, if Mr. Atkinson had been called a Radical,
he would have repelled the charge with indignation

He was a friend to the Church, because, as he delighted
to say, its doctrines appeared to him very true, neither
fanatical nor popish, and more calculated than any other
to produce obedient and honest citizens, who would make
the nation wealthy and prosperous by their quietness and
sobriety. At the same time he would not for the world
prevent others from holding their own opinions. And
other forms and doctrines might be true as well as those
of the Church. And toleration of each other's views was
the fittest course for the practical statesman to take. He
therefore not only paid his annual subscription to Dr
Grant's evening lecture, but contributed his guinea a.
year to the Wesleyan school, induced one of his clients
to give a very favorable piece of ground for the erection
of a Unitarian meeting-house, and had held a plate at a
meeting in the town-hall for promoting a Baptist mission
to New Zealand, at the same time that the bishop of that
country was embarking to take possession of his diocese.
He was a friend to the throne; but yet he was almost
struck dumb, when Charles Bevan ventured to refuse
drinking the "Glorious Revolution of 1688." And when-
ever King Charles I. was mentioned, Mr. Atkinson con.
fessed that much good had arisen from the principle then
established, that in cases of tyranny a people might right
themselves. His notion of society was, that it was a
very convenient association for the purpose of procuring
comfortable houses, decent clothes, abundant provisions.
And his abhorrence of radicalism mainly resolved itself
into the pernicious influence which sedition, and rebel.
lion, and agitation generally exercised on the price of
stocks. In his heart, indeed, he little approved of a very
extended education of the poor; for he found that the im-
pertinent boys at the Hawkstone National School paid
little attention to taking off their hats to him ; and Mr.
Smith, the manufacturer, complained bitterly that his
educated factory men, instead of devoting themselves to
develope the resources of the country by persevering
labor for sixteen hours a-day, were prone to read news-
paper, and congregate in debating societies. But edu
cation was a popular watchwori', and therefore Mr

Atkinson surrendered himself to the charm, and even
delivered an address to the Mechanics' Institute of :vbich
he was treasurer; in which address he satisfactorily
showed that nothing could more conduce to the virtue,
chastity, and honesty of the poor than teaching them the
use of the globes; that the greatest enjoyment after six-
teen hours' work was to listen to a new theory of geology ;
and that, indeed, man's highest happiness on earth, and
probably in heaven, must consist in being able to ana.
tomise an ichthyosaurus, give the right name to the or-
nithorhyncus paradoxus, or discover a new nebula under
the extreme point of the last star in Orion's belt.
But we must not detain our readers longer from the
conclave in Mr. Lomax's back parlor; for after a great
deal of discussion, in which all the parties spoke together
at once till they were tired, and Charles Bevan, who had
sat a silent spectator, was about to take his hat and
retire in despair, Mr. Atkinson, who possessed singular
tact in managing a public meeting, and, that he might
carry his own way last, always allowed the others to
have their own way first, and to talk themselves out of
breath and patience, proceeded to draw a written paper
out of his pocket and suggested that he might be allowed
to read it.
" I think," he said, " gentlemen, that we are all agreed
in asking Mr. Villiers to come forward on the Conserva
tive interest." Certainly, was the general exclamation.
* And that he must be asked to take an enlarged and
liberal line, otherwise we shall lose the support of a great
number of votes." There was a reluctant murmur of
assent from a few, broken by a growled "humph !" from
Captain Hancock, who sat, with his rough, honest weath-
er-beaten face leaning on his gold cane, in one corner:
" I have thought the best thing I could do," said Mr.
Atkinson, was to draw up a little address, which he
would himself circulate to the electors, and this would
explain our views better to him than any thing else."
Captain Hancock again muttered " pish !" but the rest
nodded assent. " Shall I read it, gentlemen ?" asked Mr
Atkinson, blandly.

207
" By all means," said the little party.
And even
Charles Bevan resumed his seat, it must be confessed,
not wholly to the satisfaction of the composer of the
address, for Charles was rather hypercritical; and not
many months before, after Mr. Atkinson had taken the
greatest pains in elaborating an address to Sir. Robert
Peel, and had concluded with saluting him not only as
the greatest statesman that ever lived, but as the hope of
the Church, and the "pater patri," Charles had poured
upon his eulogy such a stormi of indignation and ridicule,
that the favorite phrase was obliged to be expunged, and
the panegyric confined to the two points of establishing
the new police, and reducing the Three and a half per
cents ; beyond which, to the astonishment and indigna.
tion of Mr. Atkinson, Charles declared that no one act
of the minister would obtain from posterity, who saw the
consequences of his policy, any thing but contempt and
indignation. Mr. Atkinson, however, was now obliged
to proceed, though not without having before his eyes
the fear both of Captain Hancock's blunt honest" pish!"
and Charles Bevan's more subtle sarcasm.
And he began his address accordingly. "To the
Loyal and Independent Electors of the Borough of
Hawkstone. Thus far he hugged himself with the
thought that no possible objections could be raised. But
he was somewhat taken by surprise at the dreaded
"humph !" from Captain Hancock's corner. Mr. At.
kinson looked up in meek expostulation. , "What possible
objection," he asked, gently, "could be made to this,
the usual and ordinary form of addressing all bodies of
electors ?"
They are not loyal," growled the captain," and
they ought not to be independent. Why do you begin by
a lie ?"
"Not loyal ?" exclaimed Mr. Atkinson.
" 'The
Conservatives not loyal ?"
No," answered the captain ; "there is not one of
them would die for their queen,--and that is what I call
loyal. Has not your own Sir Robert Peel told the House
of Commons, that it is for them, and not for the king,

" My good friend," interposed Mr. Atkinson, you
should consider the signs of the times. This is not a day
when the extreme prerogatives of the crown can be main-
tained. We must soften down asperitieswe must
conciliate. Think of the general enlightenment--of the
extension of newspapers--of the

Captain had thrown himself back in his chair. And
Charles Bevan added : " And of the National Schools
and the mechanics' institutesand the railwaysand
the steam navigation ;--all of which clearly proves that
it is right that this empire should be governed by the
people, and not by their king. Is it not so, Mr.
Atkinson?"
Mr. Atkinson bit his lips, but still endeavored to pre.
serve his bland, conciliating smile.
- And I

added, at length, " you would object to the word  inde.

Bevan, however, made no reply, except to beg him to
proceed. And Mr. Atkinson resumed:

ential body of the
But here the Captain could
not help knocking his gold-headed cane upon the ground.
" Ay," he exclaimed, " what is the meaning of 'influ-
ential body,' and "independent electors ?' Are they
to be influenced, or independent? Which do you mean,
Mr. Atkinson ?"
"I mean, of course," replied Mr. Atkinson, "that
they should give their votes freely, without being guided
by any thing which I, or you, or any other person, might
say to them. Now the Reform Bill has been passed, my
opinion is, that we should all accept it willingly, and
endeavor to carry out its principles. And one of these,
surely, is that voters are to vote independently."
" And what, then, becomes of your influence ?" said
the Captain, rather indignantly,
"Of course," said Mr. Atkinson, " I should be very

far from excluding the proper influence of property :
property is the very end and foundation of society.
"Or of knowledge ?" said Bevan.
"Certainly," replied Mr. Atkinson.
6 Or of goodness ?" continued Bevan.
"Surely," conceded Mr. Atkinson.
"Then," concluded Bevan, " if they are to be under
all these influences, perhaps we may as well strike out
the word  independent'in the heading of the address."
" Will Mr. Lomax have the goodness to put it to the
vote ?"
"I move," continued the Captain, " that "loyal' be
struck out with it; for I hate telling the poor ignorant
people a lie. They will learn by and by to think cutting
their queen's throat a loyalty."
The majority, however, felt no such scruples ; and
accepting the epithets as parts of an ordinary form,
meaning nothing, they overruled both objections, and
Mr. Atkinson continued :
**  Invited, as I have been, by a numerous and influ-
ential body of the electors of the borough of Hawkstone,
to offer myself as a candidate for the honor of representing
it in parliament
But once
more the reader was interrupted by a
grumbled "humph!" and Mr. Atkinson's eyes were
lifted up to the dreaded corner.
"I do not like that  offer myself as a candidate,'
muttered Captain Hancock ; "it is we who ought to ask
him to accept it, not he who should come and ask us to
give it to hin What does he get by it ?"
"Get by it !" exclaimed Mr. Atkinson, rather faintly
(for reminiscences came across him, which turned the
sensitive, liberalized blood, which he had lately imbibed,
into a faint blush upon his cheeks). 66 Of course it is
a great honor to him, and a great advantage, and a
great
But he found a difficulty in finishing his
sentence.
" What!" continued Captain Hancock, " to be kept
all the best part of the year in a nasty town, swallowing

speeches-obliged to give up his family and societyand
to make himself sick with committees, and divisions, and
debates,--and all for the satisfaction of being called
the honorable member for Hawkstone ! Pish! I'll
never give my vote to a man who comes and asks me
to give it him, as if he were going to get a place or a
pension by his membership. And as for the honor !--
why, what is the honor of being the chosen of a mob-
the elect of the ten-pound freeholders--the pet and
favorite of a set of fellows who know nothing, and care
for nothing, but getting their beer a penny a pot cheaper,
or their wages without any labor, and who only send him
to parliament to obtain this for them."
Once more, however, the objection fell upon the
audience without meeting any sympathy, and Mr. Atkinson
continued : ""I come forward without delay to respond to
their summons.""
" You might as well say "answer,' instead of "re.
spond,"" criticised the Captain. But the rest, who knew
liitle of their classics, except what they had picked up at
very third-rate schools, preferred the Latinized word; it
sounded more dignified.
"My principles, continued the reader, "6 are
well known to be those of the present Conservative
ministry.
"What principles are those?" grumbled Captain
Hancock.
66 Oh!" said Charles Bevan, " of course the principle
of having no principles." And Captain Hancock nodded
to him with approbation.
"  I pledge myself,'" continued Mr. Atkinson, "6 to
endeavor to maintain the ancient institutions of the coun.
try, which it is the object of a Conservative government
to preserve.'"
" Had you not better specify them?" asked Bevan ;
" the cathedral bodies, for instance; the Irish Bishoprics;
the municipal corporations; the spiritual independence
of the Church; Church education ; Convocation ; the
Bishopric of Bangor, with a few others?"
Mr. Atkinson looked at him impatiently, but resumed.

B it I shall be most anxious to remove any restraints
which now exclude certain portions of the community
from sharing the full benefits of the constitution."
" That is," said the Captain, "you will keep the gates
of the citadel locked and bolted, and only break a hole in
the wall for the enemy to creep in at the side."
" Your metaphor, Captain, is rather obscure," ob-
served Mr. Atkinson, as he endeavored to parry the
objection with another smile ; " but we must hasten on.
*I desire to see the agricultural interest preserved in its
just rights; and, at the same time, all unnecessary bur-
dens removed from the manufactures of the country. I
inserted this," said Mr. Atkinson, " because I rather
think Mr. Burn, at the silk-mills, is inclined to give us
his vote, if our candidate will support free trade ; and
he looked round for some marks of admiration at his
sagacity. " Mr. Bowler, and the other landlords, of
course, are with us; but I think we must contrive to
conciliate the manufacturers."
"Certainly," said Charles Bevan. 66 And it is so
easy to do this, by making promises which no one could
ever convict you of breaking. "Just rights!''unneces.
sary burdens!'
Of course we must all agree in this.
Pray what are the 'just rights of the agriculturist, and
the  necessary burdens' of the manufacturer ?"
"Indeed, Mr. Bevan," replied Mr. Atkinson, rather
angrily, "I cannot enter into abstract discussions with
you. I must deprecate the introduction of theories and
speculations into plain practical politics. I think it would
be most dangerous for us to commit ourselves to any
general principles, instead of waiting for circumstances,
and guiding ourselves by them."
" Like a weathercock waiting for a wind!" grumbled
Captain Hancock.
Captain Hancock, I must protest," said Mr. Atkin-
son, " against such severe strictures. Will you allow
me to proceed: 'I am, from conscientious conviction, a
firm friend to the Established Church; but I shall always
be found ready to give full freedom and toleration to other
forns of opinion, all of which, if conscientiously main.

between which we cannot judge without assuming an
infallibility impossible to man.'"
But here he was interrupted by Charles Bevan, whose
countenance had assumed a very grave expression of
indignation. He took a small Bible out of his pocket,
and presenting it to Mr. Atkinson, begged to know in
what
page of it he found any principle of the kind.
"Indeed," said Mr. Atkinson, " I am no theologian,
and really cannot enter into your Oxford notions.
very willing to support the Church, but I cannot com-
promise the peace of the country, and condemn others for
the sake of maintaining your exclusive notions. It may
be all very well for theologians; but as practical men of
business, who have to engage in the affairs of the world,
we really must make allowances for differences of opinions,
and not involve ourselves in a war of words for the pecu-
liar doctrines of one class in preference to another."
" That is," replied Bevan, " as practical men of busi.
ness, and as politicians, you must cast away your obliga-
tions as Christians, deny your faith, defy your God, and in
the very teeth of his commandments apologise for, and sup-
port, and propagate, every form of heresy and schism.
" Indeed," exclaimed Mr. Atkinson, rather alarmed
by the severity of the words, "nothing can be farther
from my intention. I am sure Dr. Grant will tell you
that no man is more a friend to the Church than myself,
or more anxious to support it. Have I not given 101. to

want friends but sons. It demands not support, but obe.
dience: and it has no more dangerous enemies than those
who profess to assist it, almost contemptuously pitying its
weakness, instead of recognising and submitting to its
authority."
" But indeed," continued Mr. Atkinson, "I have no
wish to undervalue its authority. And yet, really you
would not have me as a layman trouble myself about its
thirty-nine Articles, or enter into all its controversies
with other sects?"

1 should wish you," replied Bevan, as a Christian
tu trouble yourself with ascertaining the grounds of your
faith, and learning what that Church is of which you
profess to be a member; and then amongst other things
you would learn never to apply to it the name of sect.'
Ay!" said Mr. Atkinson; " Catholics always argue
in the same manner."
"I presume," Mr. Atkinson, replied Bevan, that
you mean Roman Catholics or Romanists. I beg to
assure you that they argue in a very different manner
But this is not the place for such a discussion. May I
beg you to erase from your address all that you have
said about the Church?"
6. Erase ! erase !" exclaimed Mr. Atkinson.  Surely
you would not wish me to leave out the passage about
supporting the Church ?
What will Dr. Grant say?"
" And what will the Dissenters say," added. Mr. Lo-
max," if there is nothing in the address about toleration
and liberty of conscience? They will charge us with
being bigoted and I know not what."
" I think I might add," replied Bevan, " what will
Mr. Villiers say, if you propose to put into his mouth any
sentiments like those which you have inserted ?
" But indeed," remonstrated Mr. Atkinson, 6 these
are not days when we can return to those old exploded
maxims about Church authority and exclusive truth. We
inust adopt larger views, or we shall never be able to
stem the torrent of popular opinion."
" I suppose you mean," subjoined Captain Hancock,
gruffly, "not be able to swim down with it quietly and
comfortably, for I do not see many signs of stemming
it."
"I must insist," repeated Bevan, on the erasure of
those words, or I must refuse my vote at once. If I were
defending my title to an estate, I should not like to trust
an advocate, who rested my title on his own personal
regard for me, and on his own opinion that I was a fit
person to possess it, instead of exhibiting my title-deeds,
and proving that it was mine hy a right independent of
all his own inclinations and opinions. And as a minister

of the Church, I cannot permit its title, as the dispenser
of the one truth, and as the ambassador of Heaven, to
be perilled by resting the support of it upon any other
grounds than an external commission from above, and
thus recognising in it a power which we are not to
panegyrize but to obey."
"Well," replied Mr. Atkinson, "I am sure I am
most anxious to conciliate every one. If you wish it,
and no one objects, I will cut out the sentence. And
indeed these Church matters are extremely perplexing,
and I wish we were well rid of them. I should like, you
know, to express the feelings of Conservatives, that the
Establishment must be supported; but if you are not
content with this, and require more, perhaps the best
way is to omit it altogether."
" By far the best way," replied Bevan. " The Church
will be far safer without than with such help as you pro-
pose to give it." And Bevan looked at his watch, and,
remembering that he had an engagement, he took up his
hat and left the room.
"A very singular young man!" whispered Mr.
Lomax to his neighbor. "Very odd opinions those new
Oxford doctrines," muttered Mr. Robertson.--" What a
troublesome person to deal with," exclaimed Mr. Atkin.
son, looking round more freely, and, now that Bevan was
gone, caring less for the growlings of Captain Hancock
in the corner.
But Captain Hancock still further reliev-
ed his mind by taking up his hat also, and preparing to
depart. He stopped, however, to button his great coat,
and to disburthen his mind of a few words.
"Gentlemen," he said, " and you, Mr. Atkinson,-
you 'll excuse a plain, blunt, rough man for speaking his
mind to you. But I'll venture to tell you, that in the
way you are going on now, you will neither get Mr.
Villiers to be your member, nor find any one worth hav.
ing to help and support you. Englishmen understand
trickery and shuffling. And bad as they may be, and
worse since the Reform Bill than they were before, they
will not have anything to say for any long time, except to
honest, straight-forward persons. When you know your

own minds, and can tell your own principles, and will
hold your own course without being frightened at this,
and driven back at that, or trying to conciliate here and
compromise there, and always leaving a hole to shuffle
out at from every engagement you make, then, perhaps,
you may may be able to return a member for Hawkstone.
But I think you had better begin by dropping your new
nick.name, and returning at once to your old Tory, who
was at least an honest man, and dared say what he
thought, and do what he knew was right. I hate con-
servatism, gentlemen, and so do all sound-hearted En-
glishmen, as they hate a coward and a traitor. I beg to
wish you a good morning,"
And the blunt-spoken Captain closed the door after
him, leaving the litttle conclave partly indignant, and
partly ashamed, and even the prudent, practical, cautious
Mr. Atkinson, with all his skill and tact, crest-fallen and
alarmed, and scarcely able to conclude the remainder of
his address, which, like the beginning, was made up of a
well-adjusted balance of promises and professions-hold
ing out a hook baited for each party, and which the acute
contriver congratulated himself on having happily con-
cealed under an enticing compound of liberalism and con.
servatism ; taking care, as he boasted to his hearers,
not to commit them irrevocably to anything whatever,
and leaving a door open to escape, at any pressure of
circumstances, from any engagement they might make.
The reader will scarcely be interested in hearing
more of their deliberations. But it may be as well to
subjoin the answer, which Villiers returned to the depu.
tation, who waited on him with a request from the party
that he would come forward as a candidate for the
borough, and issue in his own name, as best correspond-
ing with the sentiments of the electors, Mr. Atkinson's
well-concocted address.
" GENTLEMEN,

which you have paid me. I am aware that my connec-
tion with the borough of Hawkstone would naturally

give you a right to claim of me that I should undertake
the duty of representing it in parliament: but, by the
address which you have placed in my hands, you imply
that I must enter parliament as the representative of the
opinions of my constituents, and not as a senator chosen
by them to deliberate, in their stead, upon the interests
of the whole nation.  And as such a theory, however
generally adopted in the present day, is subversive of tho
British monarchy and constitution, I must decline to
comply with it. I will also candidly confess that my
principles will not allow me to adopt the tone of concil.
iation and comprehension, which, it would appear, is
necessary to secure the votes of any large portion of the
constituency. I cannot offer at once protection to the
agriculturist, and a repeal of the corn laws to the manu-
facturer. I cannot profess adherence to the Church, and
at the same time regard dissent with indifference or
favor. I cannot at once promise to maintain the Irish
Church, and to enlarge and give endowments and grants
to its deadly enemies. I cannot uphold with one hand
the British monarchy, and with the other the supremacy
and irresponsibility to law of the House of Commons. In
other words, I cannot profess incompatibilities and con.
tradictions ; and therefore I must beg to decline allowing
my name to be proposed as a representative for the
borough of Hawkstone.
" I have the honor to be, gentlemen,

CHAPTER XV.
It was two days after the meeting of the Conservative
conclave, that Mr. Lomax was sitting in the same back
parlor of the banking-house, his head resting upon his
hands, and his brow furrowed with deep thought. And

speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of

Among the exulting readers, not the least were the
inhabitants of Hawkstone. Hawkstone had been specially
mentioned in the speech as a place which had been fore.

within a few hours. Whole streets were springing up
in the suburbs; new capitalists speculating in its shops.

a new police, decorated with a theatre, enlightened by
Nothing could be more prosperous or
thriving.
And yet, as Mr. Lomax read the panegyric, a little
bitterness mixed with his smile, and he laid down the
paper upon a statement of figures with which he had just
been busied, and which he seemed unwilling to face
again. He turned to another paper lying open before

him ; it was Villieri's answer to the requisition, which
Mr. Atkinson had just left with him, after a long and
confidential communication. And Mr. Lomax's face
assumed the cast of Hamlet deliberating on "To be,
or not to be?" when a gentle tap was heard at the
door ; and Mr. Lomax started up with a vexed and timid
expression of countenance, for he knew what that tap
angured.
It was Mrs. Lomax. And with an ill-disguised
awkwardness and reluctance, she was come, as she often
did come, even into the penetralia of the banking-house,
to request a cheque.
"My dear, you are always pestering me for money!"
was the greeting with which she was received.
a ruined man, and you know it ; and yet I cannot induce
you to be economical."
" My love," replied the lady, " it is impossible to
keep up our establishment without money; and you
have
often told me that you wished us to make a proper appear-
ance. I only want thirty pounds."
" Thirty pounds!" exclaimed Mr. Lomax, whose
drawers were at that moment piled with magical bank.
notes,-into whose iron room, only the evening before,
Mrs. Lomax had persuaded him to take her niece Martha,
that she might see sovereigns tossed about in shovels.
Thirty pounds! I tell you, my love, I have not got
it; and you must do without. Let the bills stand
over.
" Not got it !" replied Mrs. Loinax, with a laugh.
" How can you talk such nonsense, when you have
thousands in those very drawers ?" And Mrs. Lomax
playfully endeavored to open one of them ; but her
husband seized her arm rather roughly, and bade her
sit down. " I tell you what, Maria," he said, " I cannot
go on in this way any longer. I do not choose to let the
world knowbut you must knowthat each year is
involving me more and more in difficulties ; and if I were
to die to-morrow, you and the children would be penniless.
You must alter your way of living."
Mrs. Lomax seemed for a time dismayed by the
66

HAWKSTONE.
219
66
bitierness of her husband's manner, and the evident
sincerity of his words. But she consoled herself with
thinking that he had often said the same thing before, and
had the next day fallen readily into any proposal which
she might suggest for making an alteration in the house,
or giving a dinner to some of the neighboring gentry, or
providing new ball-dresses for her daughters, that they
might maintain their station as the leading belles of
Hawkstone. And as Mrs. Lomax was unable to recon-
cile the inconsistencies, she preferred adopting the expla-
nation most agreeable to her own wishes, and satisfied
herself with the conviction that her husband's complaints
were only a false cry of wolf, caused by a failure in somne
little speculation, or, perhaps, by having partaken too
freely of some recent hospitalities. " The stomach," she
said to herself, was out of order ; and this was enough
to account for those idle fancies and depressions of
spirits. A blue pill would set it all to rights." And
accordingly, whenever, in their private colloquies at
night, Mr. Lomax touched with anxiety upon the dreaded
subject of retrenchment, Mrs. Lomax assured him that it
was all bile, and had recourse to her medicine-chest as
the best panacea for these financial indigestions. Now,
however, Mr. Lomax's gloomy brow, and the sight of
open letters before him, excited in his lady's mind some
deeper misgivings. " Is any thing the matter, really?"
she said.
"Yes," he replied, fiercely, "every thing is the
matter. I am a beggar, Maria, and you are a beggar,
and the children are beggars !" And he put into her
hand a letter which he had just received, and from
which Mrs. Lomax, though little initiated in business,
understood that her husband had just been a considerable
loser by the very rise in the funds on which the Chan.
cellor of the Exchequer had so warmly congratulated the
country:
"Well, iny dear," said Mrs. Lomax, after folding
up and returning the letter, " this is a loss, certainly; but
it is only 8001. Surely that cannot have ruined you !
And another speculation will set it all right."
## p. 220 (#576) ############################################

HAWKSTONE.
* It is not one," said Mr. Lomax, bitterly. "They
have all failed, again and again ; and I tell you I am a
ruined man. We must sell the carriage."
" My dear," replied the lady, " you are taking things
too much to heart. You must not despair, as you are so
inclined to do. Besides, the carriage is but a trifle ; and
what would the world say if they saw you reducing your
establishment. They would think immediately that there
was something the matter; and you could not answer
for the consequences."
"I do not care about consequences," said Mr. Lo.
max, impatiently. "You must give up the carriage and
the horses, and let the girls know that they cannot go to
Brighton this year. And then your servants, Maria-I
tell you fairly, you must get rid of John, and you must
part with your page, as you call him; and the cook's
wages must be reduced. I never can support such an
establishment."
"My dear," replied Mrs. Lomax, whose theory of
domestic management was to soften, not to oppose, and
who, in exercising her empire over her husband, had
adopied the motto "imperare parendo," " of course,
whatever you desire must be done. But you would not
wish to do this all at once. Consider how many persons
there are who would seize upon it, and spread all kinds
of reports. Why you might have a run upon the bank
to-morrow."
6 And so much the better," exclaimed Mr. Lomax,
angrily: " Better to have it all over at once than go on
in this way, dreading every post, and begging and bor-
rowing" (he stopped, and did not add stealing) " in
every corner to save the crash from coming."
"But I thought,
," said Mrs. Lomax, with some dis-
may, " that there was not a more flourishing business
than yours all over the country. Surely the public be-
lieve so; and they must be the best judges."
" Best judges !" exclaimed Mr. Lomax, bitterly.
" What do they know of our losses by bad debts and fail-
ures in speculations? And now, when money is so plen-
titul, how are we to make anything by our deposits ?
## p. 221 (#577) ############################################
HAWKSTONE.
221
66
People think that bankers are as rich as Crsus, because
they have thousands in their hands : but if the money is
not their own, Mrs. Lomax ?"
" Not their own!" said Mrs. Lomax, soothingly.
" But it is placed in their hands to be made use of; and
surely you are at liberty to employ it as you like, and to
replace it when convenient ? Why this is the very na.
ture of credit."
" The very nature of a system," replied the gentle-
man, angrily, "for leading people into debt, and when
they are in debt turning them into rogues."
Why will you talk so wildly, my love ?" said Mrs.
Lomax. Surely you are not in debt; all our bills are
paid regularly every quarter: and as for roguery," she
added, playfully, "what would you say if any one were
to use such an epithet coupled with your name? Who
would allow him to use it ? Why your very word would
pass in Hawkstone for thousands any day."
Mr. Lomax bit his lips till the blood nearly came, but
be said nothing.
My dearest John," continued the lady, "you are
surely taking things too much to heart. This little loss
will soon be put to rights. I cannot help thinking you
ate too much of that mock-turtle yesterday. It is this
which makes you so gloomy. What will the world say,
if they see you looking so miserable and anxious ?''
And at this moment Mr. Lomax felt the necessity of
attending to her suggestions, and of clearing up his brow,
for a clerk came from the outer room, and presented se-
veral papers for him to sign. It was the day when the
half-yearly interest was due on various small deposits,
which had been intrusted to Mr. Lomax with the same
confidence as if they had been locked up in the cofiers
of the Bank of England, and for which the poor but
contented owners were both surprised and pleased to
receive from him their five per cent. with most satisfac-
tory regularity; though parties acquainted with the mys-
teries of the money market did wonder, at times, from
what prosperous speculation the Hawkstone banker could
derive profits so much beyond the ordinary rate of inte-

rest And this morning our excellent friend Mabel had
sent her Grey-School girl to obtain her half-yearly thirty
pounds; and Mrs. Crump had despatched her maid on a
similar errand. And as Mr. Lomas went into his outer
room he was faced by Miss James, with a bright red
flower in her bonnet, and a brighter smile on her face.
coming, as she said to Mr. Lomax, to the very abode of
Cresus and Pluto (Miss James, in her classical instruc-
tions to her little pupils, had made a slight mistake in her
mythology) to obtain the necessary resources for conglo-
merating (by which she meant settling) the academical
arrangements of her establishment. Charles Bevan,
also, had dropped in with a cheque from his mother;
and he was then chatting with Mr. Vincent, who, for
certain special reasons, was desirous of a confidential
communication with Mr. Lomax on the best means of
turning to advantage a sum of two thousaad pounds,
which he had accumulated as a little portion for his
daughter Mary. And to all these several visitants, and
especially to Mr. Vincent, Mr. Lomax's face assumed an
aspect of cheerfulness and benignity, as if paying money
was the happiness of his life, and receiving it a matter
of
supreme indifference.
"What a fortunate man you are," said Mr. Vincent
to him, after having agreed to deposit the two thousand
pounds in Mr. Lomax's hands for a few months, that it
might obtain a larger interest than the funds would offer.
" How comfortable and snug you have every thing.
Here ain I, a poor country clergyman, obliged to scrape
together from every quarter a few pounds to save my
children from starving, while you are rolling in wealth,
and have only to write your name to command thousands.
And what an improvement you have made in your house.
Have
you thrown that other room into the drawing-room,
as you proposed ? I must just go and say how-do-ye-de
to Mrs. Lornax, and admire her taste. Ah!" he con
cluded, shaking his head, "none but you rich bankers
can indulge in such luxuries."
And Mr. Lomax affected to smile with an air of
self-satisfaction; and having shaken him by the hand, he

returned into his back parlor, not without hoping that
his lady had taken her departure.
But Mrs. Lomax was still there. "My dear," she
said, gently, "I hope you are more comfortable now.
I could not help hearing what Mr. Vincent wanted with
you. I am in a great hurry. Would you, if you please,
give me that little cheque? Morris, the upholsterer, is
waiting in doors for it."
Mr. Lomax sat down and took
up
his
pen.
" Now
remember," he said, " Maria, if I give you this now,
I shall expect that you do not worry me again for a
long time. I really cannot go on at this rate ; and if
you do not retrench, things must come to a crash."
"Nonsense, my love!" replied the lady. "How can
things come to a crash; while such men as Mr. Vincent
come to you every day, depositing such sums in your
hands without asking what becomes of it, or trusting to
any thing but your word ? And then there is Mr. Villiers
again : has he opened his account with you yet? They
say he has a mine of wealth ; and is so proud that he
always keeps thousands of ready money at his banker's."
" I have not seen Mr. Villiers yet," replied the bank-
er, gloomily.
"But of course you will see him, my dear-of course
you will call on him. Why do you not have the horses
put to the carriage, and drive over to-day, and leave
your card ?"
Mr. Lomax was silent. He generally bowed with
submission to his lady's more accurate knowledge of
etiquette and society ; still he could not help confessing
that he had heard Mr. Villiers was a very proud and
hanghty man, and perhaps might not like his calling."
" Not like your calling !" exclaimed the ambitious
lady, indignantly. "Surely the great banker of Hawk.
stone is in a position to call on any one, when he comes
into the country, if it were Lord Claremont himself. If
you
do not pay him this attention, how can you expect

rion in society. I do hope you will drive over this very
day. Do you not keep your carriage ? and cannot you
give dinners in as good a style as any one in the country?
I declare, since you bought those silver corner-dishes,
our table is quite as respectable as Lady Sudborne's;
and she does not keep a page-only a butler and a foot-
man ; besides which, she has no epergne, as we have.
You certainly must call on Mr. Villiers; and then it will
be quite proper to ask him to dinner."
Mrs. Lomax, once embarked in dreams of hospitable
elegance and fashionable dinners, scarcely noticed that
her husband was apparently engaged in arranging to
fulfil one part of her proposal, and to call that afternoon
at the Priory. At last he said, "I think, Maria, if you
will order the carriage, I will drive over after two o'clock."
66 And you will have John, of course, in his new
livery," said Mrs. Lomax. " It is so much more re.
spectable."
" Yes, my dear," said Mr. Lomax (and he sighed).
" If one is at the expense of a livery, one may as well
make use of it."
"Pooh! pooh! my love," rejoined Mrs. Lomax,
smilingly. Why will you worry yourself about ex-
penses ; every thing will come right soon. And, indeed,"
she continued, "I cannot help thinking that Mr. Villiers
living at the Priory will be a great advantage to the town.
I dare say he will enter into society, and make it quite
gay, particularly if he is to be the new member."
"He is not going to be the new member," said Mr.
Lomax, mysteriously.
" And who is to be then ?" said his lady. Surely
you won't allow that odious "Irs. Maddox to palm her
radical proteg upon the town." And if any of our rea-
ders are startled by finding such a hostile epithet applied
by one member of the Dorcas Society to an affectionate
sister, they must allow for some bitterness of feeling pro-
duced by the rivalry of fashionable life and political party,
even among the dee minores of a country town; and
must reflect that it was no little provecation to Mrs. Lo.
max's maternal feelings that Mr. Marmaduke Brook, the

clever candidate, should be domesticated at her rival's
house, and should daily parade the town with the pretty
Miss Susan Maddox leaning familiarly on his arm, and
followed by Mrs. Maddox and the plainer elder daughter
-while the mother smiled significantly and exultingly to
the greetings of her numerous acquaintance.
" Mr. Villiers has refused to come forward," repeated
Mr. Lomax, in a tone which implied that he should not be
reluctant to have a still further secret extorted from him.
" And who is to come forward, then ?" said Mrs.
Lomax, catching a little smile, which her husband could
not wholly suppress. Now, you know, my dear John,"
she exclaimed ; "you can tell me all about it.
You
know there is a secret. You must tell me. I am sure
there is something that should like to know."
But Mr. Lomax pursed up his lips, and affected reso.
lute perseverance in silence.
"I must know, I will know," exclaimed the lady,
looking him laughingly in the face, while he vainly en.
deavored to appear unconcerned. "It is something
about yourself, I am sure, John, by that smile-I know
it is," she continued. " Now tell me honestly, is it not?
You are to be the new member that is it, I am sure,
she exclaimed, exultingly ; and she snatched up a note
of Mr. Atkinson's which lay on the table. 6 Here is
Mr. Atkinson's own hand-writing. I always said you
would be a member of parliament." And she proceeded
to read the note, which revealed what her wishes had
anticipated, and contained a strong request to Mr. Lo.
max from the members of the Conservative party to
allow himself to be put in nomination at the ensuing
election.
" And of course you have consented," said Mrs. Lo-
max, triumphantly.
Mr. Lomax shook his head.
" You do not mean," said the lady, " that you have
refused. You owe it to your family, Mr. Lomax, to the
giris especially, not to neglect such an opportunity of giv.
ing them a posi-ion in society. It must be done, indeed.
Why should not you be in arliament as well as that

wretched Quaker-man at Broughton, who has not half
as fine a business as you have ?"
"Where am I to get the money ?" sighed Mr. Lo.
max, despairingly.
" Money!"exclaimed the lady" Why will you think
about money? Have you not the command of thousands,
and no one to ask you what you do with it ?"
" It is not my own," faltered Mr. Lomax, with a groan.
" No, my love, I know that," said Mrs. Lomax, sooth-
ingly. " It is not your own exactly, but it is placed in
your hands to do what you like with it; and you will
always have the means of replacing it, so long as the
firm flourishes, as it does now. And I am sure I cannot
see anything more likely to make it flourish than that
you should be the member. It is so very respectable.
It will give people such confidence."
Mr. Lomax looked miserable, and sighed again.
" Indeed my love," continued the lady, " I inust not
allow you to mope and look wretched in this way. I do
hope you will sit down at once and write an answer to
Mr. Atkinson, that you will be very happy; and then
we must all exert ourselves without a moment's delay
That odious Mrs. Maddox has been bustling about with
her trolloping daughters, for I cannot tell how long,
and canvassing among the poor people. Now I am sure
your influence--the influence of the bank--must be twenty
times greater.

"Stop, Maria, stop, my dear," cried Mr. Lomax.
But Mrs. Lomax stopped her ears instead of her feet,
and laughingly declared that she would not listen.

an advantage it will be for the girls to be introduced into
society as the daughters of the member for Hawkstone.
You do not know what may come of it. I am sure the
admiration which Anne excited by her singing at Brigh-
ton last year was astonishing ; and I should never be
surprised at any thing. By-the-by, they say that Mr.
Villiers is passionately fond of music.
Anne must prac.
tise some duets before he dines with us. What day bad
we better fix on, Mr. Lomax ?

that you should give a series of dinners, as you are to be
the member."
Mr. Lomax was silent.
" I suppose," the lady continued, " Mr. Villiers will
return the call immediately, and then we can ask him for
the next week : and do let us remember, Mr. Lomax,
that we have a select party. Though we do live in the
town, I should not like him to confound us with the com.
mon set of Hawkstone. If you would but have taken
Rosewood Villa when it was to be let, instead of patch.
ing up this vulgar old house in the street, we should have
been quite respectable-as respectable as Lady Sud.
borne herself. However, we must make the best of it."
Mr. Lomax still remained silent.
"One thing I must pray," continued the lady, "that
you do not ask Mr. Morgan. He
may be a very old
friend of your family, and is a very good surgeon, no
doubt, and a very excellent man ; but he is not quite the
person to ask to meet Mr. Villiers, a man of rank. I
will invite Lady Sudborne and Lady Thompson; and if
her young nephew, Sir Joseph Scargill, in the Guards,
is with her, he will be an excellent person ; and then
there is Captain O'Brien, nephew to Lord St. Aubyn
and we met him the other day at the races.
evidently much struck with Anne. And I think," she
said, " we might ask Mr. Bevan. He is not much, but
he is a fellow of a college in Oxford, and that is a res
pectable thing; and he knows Mr. Villiers."
" And Mr. Atkinson," added Mr. Lomax.
"No, my love," replied the lady; " I must protest
against Mr. Atkinson. No one has a greater respect
for him than I have, or more regard for his family. But
professional men are not quite the persons to give a tone
to society; and what I want Mr. Villiers to see is, that
we have a tone, and understand how to do these things.
I should like him to become quite intimate with us, and
to be here frequently ; you cannot tell what may come
of it. And I understand he is extremely fastidious in his
so-iety, and a man of the greatest fashion."
Well, my dear," said Mr. Lomax, succumbing

partly to his lady's volubility and confirmed habits of au.
thority, and partly to certain calculations which he was
making in his own mind with regard to the probable
amount of Villiers's yearly balance, "I suppose you
must have your own way as usual."
" And we must have champagne," added Mrs. Lo.
max, "and every thing, in fact, in the best style, And
you must not insist on having the cloth removed for the
dessert. When we dined at Lady Sudborne's, if you ra-

served it particularly. And even the Maddoxes have
taken to the practice ; it is so fashionable : and I would
not be beaten by them in any matter of fashion for the
world,a mere set of vulgar retired tradesmen."
Mr. Lomax sighed, and cast his eyes upon
the
paper
of figures which lay before bim; but he said nothing.
" And I suppose," concluded Mrs. Lomax, as she
was leaving the room,
- there is no reason why your
standing for the town should be a secret. I will only
mention it to one or two persons. I do not know any
thing," she added, " which will give so much strength
to the bank, and so much respectability to us all. I quita
long to see how Lady Thompson looks when she hears
it. Sir David after all, was only a city knight, though
he did leave her thirty thousand pounds; and, I must say,
she gives herself considerable airs."
And without waiting for a reply, and leaving the
Banker to the mingled pains and pleasures of his inter-
nal contemplations, Mrs. Lomax swam out of the room.
And for us it is unnecessary to follow her, except to
le present one day in the following week, after the visit
to the Priory had been made and returned, and the dinner
invitations, carefully framed, had all been sent, and all
but Villiers's accepted, and Mrs. Lomax's arrangements
had been completed upon the most fashionable and aris.

who was duly informed of them, and to the envy of all
the rest of the town. One only card remained unan-
swered; but it was the card of cards : and Mrs. Lo.

note to her from the Priory, and, with a countenance
blank as night, she perceived that it contained an excuse.
We will not weary ourselves, as Mrs. Lomax wearied
herself, and her husband, and her daughters, with sup-
posing imaginary reasons. Charles Bevan alone knew
the cause. But Villiers had inquired of him respecting
Mr. Lomax's position and habits of living, and then had
written a civil apology. " England," he said to Bevan,
" is on the point of ruin by these idle attempts at style
and fasbion in a class who have not the means; and I,
for one, will never encourage them. By-the-by, will you
tell Mr. Morgan that I shall be detained in the town till
five o'clock to-morrow, and if he will let me come and
partake of his family dinner I shall be very much obliged.
I promised his little boy Harry to finish my story about
the hippopotamus to him another day; and Miss Morgan
was to practice for me that sonato of Cherubini's : and
I like the whole family much--they are so simple and
unpretending."

CHAPTER XVI.
Any of our readers who have ever had the calamity to
be mixed up with the scenes of a popular election under
the blessed representative system of Great Britian, will
not require to be enlightened on the details of the Hawk.
stone election. There were the usual committees, who
assembled night after night at the Bell and the Swan,
and solaced themselves and their labors with the usual
copious libations at the expense of the candidates. There
were the ordinary placards and addresses from Brutus,
and Cincinnatus, and Anti-Corruption, and Verax, and
the hundred other anonymous prophets, who swam forth,
no one knows whence, on such occasions, like rats driv.
en from their holes by a flood. There were the libels
and counter-libels; epigrams and epithets; songs and
parodies. Mr. Brook's friends declared that Mr. Lomax

230
ILAWKSTONE.
was a hypocrite ; Mr. Lomax's committee insinuated that
Mr. Brook, and every one connected with him, were
atheists. Both exhausted the imagination in picturing
the blessings which, if returned to parliament, they
would shower down upon the country, and the calamities
which would follow upon the success of their antagonist.
The Odl Fellows, and the United Brothers, and the
Temperance Clubs held their nightly orgies, to which the
rival candidates respectively resorted, and harangued
the smoke involved and porter-drinking meetings. Each
day the fever became more fierce ; and even the calmest
minds, instead of looking on the troubled ocean from the
lofiy post of contempt, were drawn down into the waves,
and absorbed in the tumult. Mr. Brown, the chemist,
swore eternal enmity to Mr. Hopkins, the miller, because
Mr. Hopkins voted for Mr. Brook, and Mr. Brown was
on the committee of Mr. Lomax. Mrs. Morgan, instead
of receiving a patronising nod from Mrs. Maddox, was
actually cut by her in the street. Even John Hobbs, the
constable, who, as an official personage, voted of course
with the Conservatives, quarrelled with Peter Simpson,
the brever's dray-man, and in his zeal for the good cause
received such a deadly blow upon his nose, that the
mayor, who was punctilious in the appearance of his
retinue, considered him disqualified for the office of at-
tending in his blue gown and with his gilt-knobbed staff
at the borough sessions. Enmity, and envy, and hatred,
and nalice, penetrated into every hotise, and scowled
upon every countenance.
As the great day approached, rumors waxed thick
of bribes, and threats, and cajoleries, and seductions, and
defections, and treacheries, which alternately appalled
each party. Watches from each committee patrolled
nightly round the town, to guard the more timid voters
from assault, and the more needy from corruption. The
public-houses were openedthe processions marshalled
--flags suspended-bands collectedand even battles
fought. And such had been the effect of Mr. Atkinson's
well-managed policy, and of Mr. Lomax's well-distributed
money, that the Radical party began at last to tremble.

HAWKSTONE.
231
And at a meeting of the committee at Mrs. Maddox's,
to the great consternation of that lady, who had long
since resolved to be mother-in-law to the member for
Hawkstone, and to the no less dismay of Mr. Marmaduke
Brook, who had resolved, with equal certainty, not indeed
to carry away a wife from Hawkstone, but to convert
Hawkstone into a means of changing his 15001. a year
commissionership of gutters into a more permanent offi.
cial post of at least 2000). : it was hinted, that unless the
greatest exertions were made to detach Mr. Ball at the
silk-mills from iho Conservative interest, Conservatism
must triumph.
There was only one individual present who heard this
announcement unmoved, and with a smile of nonchalance,
like that of one who held in his own hands the power at
any moment of preventing such a calamitous result. Mr.
O'Foggarty had particularly requested that his name
might be added to Mr. Brook's committee, in order that
he might testify his zeal for the cause of civil and reli.
gious liberty all over the world, and might satisfactorily
exhibit how cruelly the Church of Rome had been tra-
duced by those who represented it as the restrainer of
private judgment, or the enemy of Protestantism. He
had been commanded to forward to Mr. Pearce daily and
minute accounts of the proceedings. And Pearce bad
always assured him that, if it were necessary, he could
ensure at any time the return of the Radical candidate ;
but so long as circumstances seemed favorable, and suc-
cess certain, it was unnecessary for him to move. But
he had sufficiently intimated to O'Foggarty the nature of
the train which he bad laid, to satisfy that gentleman
that the contest could but have one issue. The post that
evening carried another letter to Mr. Pearce, which in.
formed him of the threatening aspect of events; and the
next post brought a reply very brief, but very decisive.
And Mr. O'Foggarty, as he sat by his fire-side with the
letters in his band, hugged bimself, as persons do, when,
in secret and unseen, they await the firing of a train
which is to blow up al. around them, they themselves re-
maining in safety.

He rose early the next morning-very early, tinished
his breakfast sooner than usual, took his hat and stick,
and made his appearance at the door of Mr. Lomax's
bank five minutes after it had been opened. The head
clerk (for Mr. Lomax had returned the night before with a
bad headache from a saturnalia of the Odd Fellows at the
Pig and Carrot, and was not yet dressed) received Mr.
O'Foggarty with a cheerful smile, and was proceeding to
take down a large ledger to enter, as he had been in the
habit of doing for some months past, the fresh subscriptions
to the Catholic Chapel, as he termed it; but his counte.
nance fell, and his blood flowed back with a suiden
revulsion, when Mr. O'Foggarty, with a soft and insinu-
ating tone, and with something of an apology, requested
to receive the full amount of subscriptions which had
been paid in, about 5401: Well trained, however, and
accustomed to dissemble the pains of payment, the clerk,
grasping a handful of Mr. Lomax's notes, proceeded to
ask how Mr. O'Foggarty would wish to take the sum.
But all his self-command was unable to conceal his sur.
prise and dismay when that gentleman, with another
bland apology, requested to have it in gold and Bank of
England notes. The clerk looked up and then down, and
then, with a lingering hand, unclosed a secret drawer,
counted out the sovereigns and the notes, placed them in
Mr. O'Foggaity's hand, and suffered him to retire without
returning his polite bow, or being able in any way to re-
cover from his stupefaction.
A few minutes afterwards Mr. Lomax entered the
connting house with the morning letters open in his
hand, and not a few nervous twitches playing on his coun-
tenance. He bade the clerk take down two or three
ponderous leather-bound vellum folios--ran his eye over
ihe accounts in them--closed the books--opened them
againthen took up the newspaper, but without being
able to read it then looked out of the window-then
started, as the door opened, but recovered himself on
finding that it was only Mrs. Crump's Abigail, who
wanted change for a five pound note ;-and then, after
hearing the account of Mr. O'Foggarty's visit, during

233
which the twitches in the face became more numerous,
he retired into his back room, and there sat down in his
black leathern chair, gazing on the fire.
And while Mr. Lomax was in this posture, Mr.
Pearce, in London, was driving about, in a hired cab,
from street to street in the city, and holding various secret
colloquies with bill-brokers and others. He was evidently
engaged in some deeply interesting negotiation. Nor
were Mr. Lomax's London bankers omitted in his round
of visits. And twice he returned to their house in
Lombard-street; and twice he was closeted with the
head partner in his sanctuary. And that gentleman, with
a face of profound and imperturbable prudence, had more
than once pored carefully over the long files of the Hawk.
stone bank account, and had closed his perusal with an
ominous shake of the head. From Lombard-street Mr.
Pearce had hurried his jaded cab to Mincing-lane; and
there he had entered a paved back court, with a black-
leaved solitary poplar in it, and ascending a flight of
stairs, he had had an interview with Messrs. Harbottle,
the London correspondents of Mr. Ball, the proprietor of
the Hawkstone silk-mills. And this interview, also, had
appeared to terminate with little satisfaction to the cor-
respondents, who immediately, on its coming to a close,
had despatched a clerk-like letter and a variety of stamped
documents to Mr. Ball himself; and Mr. Ball himself,
with a very warm and anxious countenance, had pro-
ceeded with them without delay to Mr. Lomax; and
Mr. Lomax But we must not anticipate.
These various negotiations and mysterious movements
had taken place on the Thursday and Friday; and on
Saturday Mrs. Lomax had felt it her conscientious duty
to press on Mr. Lomax the propriety, and indeed neces.
sity, of giving a sumptuous dinner to Mr. Bowler and
several other of the neighboring gentry; who, though
they looked with no little jealousy on the banker's elegant
establishment, were partly under pecuniary obligations
to him, and partly had no objection to a very comfortable
dinner in the town after the fatigues of the magistrates'
meeting. The dinner had passed--the champagne was

234

pronounced excellent--the dessert was sumptuous. Mr.
Atkinson had delivered a most cloquent harangue to Mr.
Bowler, who was fast asleep, on the increasing prosperity
of Hawkstone'. Mr. Warburton, who was a political
economist, had enlarged on the beautiful system of credit,
on which the prosperity of the British empire was founded,
and by which every one was enabled to bring into play,
and to employ in grand speculations, every thing that he
possessed without the necessity of allowing any part to
lie dead. Many had been the exclamations of wonder
at the thriving state of commerce---
---many the congratu.
lations on the rapid progress of the Hawkstone railway
-deep the admiration at the spirit with which Messrs.
Silkem, the linen-drapers, and Messrs. Brown, their rivals
in the trade, had expended enormous sums in plate glass
and gilded pillars to adorn the streets of Hawkstone;
some wonder, also, was expressed that Mr. Ball, at the
silk-mills, had been enabled to invest so large a capital
in buildings, particularly as the silk trade was flat, and
two other mills were rising within half a mile, which
would probably cause a material reduction in the profits.
But at the mention of Mr. Ball's name, Mr. Lomax, who
had been silent and gloomy during dinner (worn out, as
Mr. Atkinson whispered, with the excitement of canvas-
sing, and the responsibilities of his approaching honors,)
lapsed into more serious nervous twitches than he had
experienced before; and, hastily passing round the rich-
cut glass claret decanters, he proposed that they should
adjourn to the ladies.
To the ladies accordingly they retired. Mrs. Lomax
received them in the gay but rather gaudily-furnished
double drawing-room. She herself, majestic in a splendid
turban and bird-of-Paradise plume, was already practising
the dignified manner which became the lady of the
inember for Hawkstone. ller page, corered over with
sugar-loaf buttons, was dispensing coffee from a large
silver salver. Miss Anne was seated at the piano, pre-
pared, in default of a more youthful hearer, to perform
for the somnolent Mr. Bowler the airs which she had so
studiously practised to fascinate the ear of Villiers. Miss

Lomax, less brilliant in manner and appearance, but not
less ambitious, was enlarging to Miss Mabel Brook, who
had been permitted to come in as a refresher in the eve-
ning, on the delight with which she was looking forward
to accompanying her papa to London when the session
opened on the probability of his taking a house in
Baker-street for themon the prospect of admission into
London society, which their acknowledged station and
rank would then ensure themand she even hinted at
some tickets for Almack's, which, through the mediation
of Lady Sudborne, she felt convinced that they would be
able to compass,
Mr. Atkinson, standing on the bright
copious-flowered rug, with his back to the fire, and his
gilded coffee cup in one hand and his coat-tails in the
other, was congratulating Mrs. Lomax on the prospect of
the poll; and the lady was listening to him graciously and
condescendingly, but without compromising her dignity.
The other gentlemen were looking over some very third-
rate works of art, gorgeously bound, which were dis.
played on the round rosewood table, and seemed disposed
to wish themselves anywhere else; when the street-door
bell rang violently. Mr. Lomax quite jumped from his
chair; and Mrs. Lomax was startled to see his color
change.
" It is only Mr. Bowler's carriage," she observed.
Why, my love, what is the matter? This troublesome
clection has made you quite nervous.
But Mr. Lomax knew that it was not Mr. Bowler's
carriage, for no sound of wheels had accompanied the
bell. But a heavy step was heard coming up the stairs.
and the awkward footman, whom all his lady's care and
refinement could not teach to wear his red plush breeches
elegantly, or to move without creaking shoes, came up
significantly to Mr. Lomax, and informed him that there
was a strange gentleman below, from London, who
wanted to see him immediately upon business.
" Ah!" exclaimed Mr. Atkinson" something, I
suppose, about Horlock's vote."
But he was surprised to see that Mr. Lomax had
turned pale, and could scarcely hold his tea cup.

last the servant was ordered to show the gei'tleman into
the study, and Mr. Lomax slowly rose from his seat, and
catching hold of the chair to support himself, he with
difficulty staggered out of the room.
"I fear, my dear madam," said Mr. Atkinson, " that
tnat troublesome business is too much for our excellent
friend. Nervous excitement thatover fatigue! but he
will soon recover it, when once he is in parliament.
You will go with him, of course, to London ! "
" I rather think we shall," said Mrs. Lomax, with
dignity. "I wish that my daughters should be introduced.
And with their father's position and establishment, I
think it will be right to show them more of the world
than they can see in this little confined spot. After all,
we must confess that Hawkstone is a vulgar place.
Brighton is my delight! Such charming society and
most fashionable too! Oscar," she called languidly, to
remove my coffee-cup, and bring me that
eau-de-Cologne. It is wearying, Mr. Atkinson, this
being obliged to receive, as we do; but our position
renders it necessary. Pray how do you like those vases
-are they not exquisite ?"
Mr. Atkinson duly admired the gaudy expensive
ornaments which stood on the mantel-piece ; and then
he pulled up his thick ill-folded white neckcloth, which
was Mrs. Lomax's aversion, and walked
away to
pay
his
compliments to Miss Anne, who, seated at the piano in
the inner drawing-room, was congratulating herself to
Mr. Warburton on the prospect of her more frequently
attending the Opera in London. " A box," she said,
" is very expensive. But I suppose in papa's new posi.
tion he will think it right to do as others do. He will
owe it to himself and his constituents to support his
position."
Mr. Warburton made no reply, but a little shrug of
contempt. And as Mr. Lomax did not return, and Mrs.
Lomax began to yawn, and the gentlemen from the
country were anxious to return home, the party broke
up.
" Well! we have had a tolerably agreeable party;"

said Ms. Lomax to her eldest daughter, as the last
visitant closed the door. "Every thing went off extremely
well; and I do think the table looked remarkably elegant.
Mr. Bowler admired those corner-dishes amazingly: I
do not think he has any himself."
Miss Lomax yawned, and assented.
" There is only one thing, I think," continued Mrs.
Lomax, " that we want just now, and that is two hand-
some chandeliers for these rooms. We want the gold

Mary, with evident reluctance and signs of weariness,
rose slowly, and proceeded to her papa's study. She
knocked, but no one answered. She opened the door.
The candles were burning down in their sockets; a chair
overturned lay upon the floor; one of the lights flickered
and went out as she approached the table, and the other
burned so dimly that she could not discern what was that
black thing lying on the ground, behind the table. Was
it her father's great-coat? She snuffed the candle and
went to pick it up, and hang it on the chair : but before
she touched it she screamed with terror, for from the
sleeve of the coat a hand projected. Papa," she cried,

the avenue.
The appearance of Mr. Atkinson himself
told at once a tale of unspeakable mischief.
haggard, bewildered, almost distracted; and it was some
time before Villiers could prevail on him to enter the
library and compose himself, that he might explain the
state of circumstances. And when he was able to tell
his tale, it was so confused, so full of dreadful anticipations
for himself, so bruken with exclamations of horror, that
Villiers could scarcely gather what it meant.

At last he learnt the terrible event which has just
been narrated. And his first thought was, that some
aberration of mind, brought on by the fatigues and
anxieties of the election, ha:) fallen on the miserable
victim of a vulgar ambition. But Mr. Atkinson shook
his head. It was something worse-far worse. The
bank had stopped that morning. The solicitor of the
London bank had met Mr. Atkinson at an early hour;
an examination of books had taken place; and it was
found that, instead of possessing property, the Hawkstone
bank had been insolvent for years; and that an enormous
defalcation could already be detected, not without sus-
picions of fraud. Villiers made no remark, but he
remembered the invitation to dinner.
" But this," continued Mr. Atkinson, was not the
worst. There had been speculations and engagements
with the proprietors of the silk-mills, to enable them to
commence operations. And Mr. Ball, of the silk-mills,
was a bankrupt also. And so far as it could be traced,
a system of accommodation bills had been contrived and
carried on for many years, which would now involve
even Mr. Smith at the factory and Sir Matthew Blake
himself. Hawkstone, the prosperous, flourishing Hawk-
stone, with its new manufactories, its brilliant shops, its
railroads, its coal-pits, and its iron-mines, had for some
time past offered a tempting field to the investments of
grasping capitalists and needy speculators; and its
whole existence was a fabric of credit" (accursed credit,
thought Villiers, the child of avarice and mother of fraud!).
* Beneath all its splendid exterior, its flourishing projects,
the ground had been undermined, as it were, and honey.
combed, and a single shock was sufficient to bring the
whole to the ground. There was not a single shopkeeper
in the town," said Mr. Atkinson, "who could calculate
for one day on his own security. Each had been leaning
on the support of another; filling his windows with
plate glass, and lighting his counter with ormolu lamps,
on credit and speculation; and a blow levelled against
one would, in all human probability, prostrate them all."
" And the po vr," asked Villiers, anxiously, are they

likely to suffer much? Were there many notes in cor
culation ?"
Mr. Atkinson, who was really a kind-hearted, bener.
olent man, could not hear the question, over-come and
unnerved as he was, without bursting into tears. His
own door had been beset that morning with a crowd of
terrified, desperate, ruined inhabitants-old men, who
had lost their all ; decrepit women, who had now no
homes to look to but the poor-house ; industrious work.
men, who had saved their earnings for a coming emere
gency, and their savings were all gone. And it was
with some difficulty that he had prevented their misery
and passion from bursting out into some fierce act of
vindictiveness, even against the equally miserable sur-
vivors in the unhappy banker's own family.
" And what of them ?" asked Villiers.
"Penniless," replied Mr. Atkinson, " utterly and en-
tirely penniless ; and chiefly their own faulttheir own
extravagance! But this," he continued, " could be
borne. But there were others, innocent of any fault but
misplaced contidence, whom nothing awaited but the
workhouse. Mrs. Atkinson had been that morning to
see three persons-poor Mabel, the aged Mrs. Crump,
and Mrs. Bevan; and no words could picture the scenes
which she had witnessed."
Villiers groaned aloud. And Mr. Atkinson rose up
and went to the window to conceal the tears which
coursed one another down his cheeks.
Villiers sat down and wrote a note, and rang the
bell immediately for his groom to take it into Hawkstone
to Mr. Bevan.
And now," he said, turning to Mr. Atkinson, who.
by disburihening his mind and giving way to his misery,
had become more composed, you let me speak to
you candidly and openly ?"
Mr. Atkinson, who seemed as if he longed to say
something, and yet could not bring himself to do so, look-
cd up in hope.
" I am aware," said Villiers, "that in your situation
you must require at certain periods large pecuniary ac.

openly, that this assistance must be limited to that sum
which is required by yourself personally to carry on the
necessary machinery of your business; and that I can
offer no encouragement whatever to that system of ad-
vances, and borrowing, and forestalling, which, whether
it prevail among landed proprietors, or manufacturing and
commercial speculators, is one of our greatest curses.
the most sure and certain cause of the destruction with
which England is now beset. I must not presume to
enter into your own private arrangements; but I am sure
you will understand me."
Mr. Atkinson's face lightened up, as if a cloud had
passed away from his eyes. He rose and seized Villiers's
hand with a warmth of gratitude, of which his cool, re.
served nature seemed wholly incapable. "My wife,"
he cried, "my dear wife! I have ten children, and you
have saved them !" and the poor man wept like a child.
But Villiers kindly but calmly begged him to resume
his seat. " Your time," he said, " every hour at such
a crisis must be precious." And he sat down to his
table to write a check.
"Will you name the sum, if you please ?" said Vil.

2000). ?" and Villiers named a sum nearly a third be-
yond what Mr. Atkinson's most sanguine wishes had
calculated on.
Once more he sprang up, and would almost have fall-
en at Villiers's knees.
" Are you sure that it is enough," said Villiers,
"perfectly sure ?"
" More, far more than I want," replied Mr. Atkinson.
"How can I ever repay you ?"
Villiers finished his check, rang the bell for Mr.
Atkinson's carriage, and was about to quit the room on
some excuse, that he might leave the happy man to him.-
self, but Mr. Atkinson stopped him. " Sir" he said, "1
cannot accept this without giving you some guarantee ;
my bond, at least, till I can place in your hands other se.
curities which I possess."
" You can do this, my dear sir," said Villiers, "when
you return home, and can deposit it with my papers."
" And the interest," continued Mr. Atkinson. "1
cannot accept it at less than five per cent."
My dear sir," answered Villiers, " this is not a
moment to enter into questions of political cconomy, and
I fear the world generally would scarcely understand me.
But, I have long since, made it a principle, in such cases
as the present, not to accept interest."
"Not accept interest ! exclaimed Mr. Atkinson,
opening his
eyes to their fullest width, and for a
moment forgetting all his miseries, and all his relief from
thom, in wonder at such a proposition. "Not accept
interest !
Villiers could not help smiling at the astonished and
hewildered aspect which looked up into his face.
" Not accept five per cent. !" continued Mr. Atkinson,

sir."

Villiers looked out of the window, and finding that his
visiter's humble conveyance had not yet been brought to
the door, he did not disdain to explain his meaning
further.
Might I ask," he said, " what profit you will your-
self make upon the expenditure of this sum, applied, as it
will be, to maintaining the regular machinery of your
business? Will it be more than is sufficient to indemnify
you for the time, anxiety, responsibility, and labor, which
you must devote to its proper employment ?"
"Certainly not," was the reply.
" And if it were more," continued Villiers, "if in any
profession, or any business, the profits should, for a time,
exceed this limit, it is an acknowledged principle of po.
litical economy that they must soon be reduced within the
limit by the natural action of competition."
Mr. Atkinson bowed.
" And if," continued Villiers, "I were to lock up this
money in a chest, would it produce me any interest of
itself? Can money grow?"
Mr. Atkinson shook his head.
" Its increase, therefore," said Villiers, "must lepend
on the labor, industry, and talent, which are devoted to its
employment, and ought to be the remuneration of them.
And if I, who do not labor, receive any portion of it, I am
detracting so much from the fair and equitable reward
which Providence has designed for them. I am eating
the bread of idleness, and you are toiling without adequate
compensation. Is this equitable? Is it agreeable to
that Divine law, which has commanded us to eat our
bread in the sweat of our brow?"
Mr. Atkinson, in his agitated state of feeling, was
unable to follow up the reasoning. He could only stare
and look bewildered. And Villiers, feeling that it was
useless to pursue the subject, only added, " Prior to all
such reasonings, a Christian has the most distinct inti-
mations of the will of Heaven on this subject, both from
the Scriptures, and from the voice of the Church; and
this is sufficient to bind his conscience. And I think you
will find, on reflection, that if the principle were generally

acted on, no such fatal calamities would occur as, that
which has now fallen upon us. The refusal of interest
would remove the temptation to give facilities for specu-
iation. There would be no idle members of society
dependent for their daily bread, not upon their own honest
industry, but on the success of speculations in others.
And though we might be less wealthy as a nation, we
should be more honest as individuals, and more safe from
misery and ruin. But I see your carriage is come to the
door, and I must not detain you." And, having shaken
Mr. Atkinson's hand, he contrived, at the same time, to
leave the cheque within it, went out with him to the hall-
door, and saw the wondering and bewildered man, with a
mixture of joy and tears, drive off to Hawkstone.
The same evening, about six o'clock, just after Villiers
had mounted his horse at Mrs. Bevan's door, and rode off
on his return to the Priory, Mrs. Bevan, pale and agi-
tated, and yet not without a mixture of joy on her worn
and anxious countenance, came out, leaning on Charles
Bevan's arm, both silent, both of them with their eyes
filled with tears. Charles left his mother at poor Mabel's
door; and Mrs. Bevan, admitted by the sobbing little
Grey girl, and almost unable to move herself, ascended the
narrow stairs. She tapped, and a low half-choked voice
bade her come in. But no sooner had Mabel caught
sight of her friend than she arose, and threw herself into
her arms, but without speaking ; neither of them could
utter a word. At last, Mrs. Bevan disengaged herself
from Mabel's almost convulsive embrace, and placing her
in a chair, she sat down by her side, and took her hand,
and held it in her own.
Even then Mabel's thoughts were more for others
than for herself. " And you, too, are ruined," she said,
at last.
" How good of you to think of meto come
to me!"
Mrs. Bevan only pressed her hand in reply, and looked
round the room. Stunned and amazed as Mabel had
been with a blow which at once had plunged her into
utter destitution, without a friend who could give her
assistance, or an occupation to which she could look for

245
support, her active, conscientious mind, instead of giving
way to useless lamentations, had, after a long struggle,
recovered somewhat of its energy; and she was resolved,
without delay, to face the worst, and to occupy herself with
necessary duties. It was a cold, cheerless evening, but
the grate was without a fire. Mabel knew that she had
no means to pay for it. A single rushlight burnt dimly
on the table, which was covered with account-books, and
sundry heaps of silver. Mabel was making up the ac-
counts of the various little charitable funds, of which she
had so long acted as secretary and treasurer, afraid to
retain in her hands even a shilling which was not her
own, under the menaces of the coming temptation. The
little girl had brought her tea-things as usual, but, except
a morsel of dry bread, nothing had been tasted; even that
Mabel had grudged to herself, for she knew not if it was
her own.
The little girl was to go home the next morn.
ing to her friends; and Mabel (she had no money) had
given her some comfortable clothing from her own little
wardrobe. She had also asked Mr. Silkem's permission
to remain one or two days longer in her rooms, until she
could look round, and find some shelter or some situation.
But Mr. Silkem was a Liberal, and it was one of his first
principles that every man should take care of number one.
He had, therefore, sufficiently indicated to Mabel, that as
she could no longer pay for her lodgings, it would be only
justice to himself and his family that she should leave it
without any delay for another occupant.
And with a
bursting heart and swell of indignation at his hardhearted-
ness, Mabel had resolved on quitting the house the very
next morning
" And where will you go?" asked Mrs. Bevan,
tenderly.
" To the poor-house," sobbed Mabel.
66 I have no
other home. I have no friends who can relieve me.
Mrs. Bevan could not refrain from weeping.
niy dear Mabel," she said, " you can come to me, at least
for a time.
" But you, too, are ruined," said Mabel ; " you have

not be a burden to you. But it is God's will, and I do
not repine.-I can bear it-I can workI can wash
He will not desert me."
Mrs. Bevan could not refrain from folding her in her
arms, and mingling her own tears with Mabel's. "I am,
indeed, ruined," she said, "and have lost all. But
Charles has still his small fellowship; and he will in.
crease it by taking pupils. And for the present," she
added, means have been supplied us by a hand which
I must not mention, until we can look round and provide
some other resources. And the same hand, which has
been stretched out to us, has made it a particular request
that you would come and take shelter under our roof,
not only you, but others : our house is large enough ; and
humbled, and destitute, and softened as we all shall be by
this appalling stroke, we may even find comfort from be.
ing together."
Mabel looked up, as scarcely understanding her.
"I mean, dearest," said Mrs. Bevan, " that I have
the means at present of receiving you ; and that it is the
wish of the benefactor, to whom I owe them, that they
should be shared with you : you will not, therefore, be a
burden to me, but rather a comfort and assistance. There
are many things which we can do together, which will
be good both to others and ourselves."
" Who is it?" exclaimed Mabel. 66 Who could have
thought of me? It could not be
my
cousin!"
Mrs. Bevan shook her head.
" And I have no claims on any one else," sobbed
Mabel. " How kind! how merciful of Providence !"
And Mabel wearied herself in vain with endeavoring to
guess the name of her unknown benefactor ; but Mrs.
Bevan checked her. " It was the wish of the same per-
son," she said,"his own especial request, that no notice
should be taken of his aid, and no endeavor made to trace
the hand which administered it. And he had also beg-
ged Mrs. Bevan to put at Mabel's disposal a little purse
for immediate necessities, which she was to consider as
coming from a friend, and as belonging not to man but
to God." And Mrs. Bevan placed in her hands a purse

of twenty guineas. For he who was thus the dispenser
of the mercies of Providence was not satisfied with pro-
viding for absolute want, but, like the Being whose min-
ister he was, he had thoughtfully and minutely anticipated
all the little difficulties and exigencies of such an emer-
gency, and endeavored to palliate them all.
" And now I must leave you," said Mrs. Bevan ;
the same blow which has fallen upon us has fallen on
many others. And there is one case of misery opposite
to your own door, which I have been commissioned to
relieve also."
" Ah !" said Mabel, " poor Mrs. Crump! Her win-
dow-blinds have been down all the day; and
my
little
girl told me that she had had a paralytic attack about
half an hour after the failure of the bank had reached
her cars. She is ruined, too ; and at her age-poor thing!
without a friend or relation in the worldnothing but the
poor-house to look to! I was going to her myself," con
tinued Mabel, " as soon as I had arranged these things,
to ask if I could sit up with her to-night ; for her maid is
anything but attentive to her, and thinks of nothing but
her wages."
" I am going," said Mrs. Bevan, " to offer her a room
in my own house for the present. There, at least, she
will be attended to with more care and kindness than
even in her own lodging ; and, together, we might con-
tribute something to her comfort. If we ourselves have
been saved from utter destitution, our first thought must
be to save others."
Mabel caught at the thought of being useful. And
sorrowful, yet calm, and not despairing, and even with a
ray of comfort in their eyes, the two friends embraced
once more ; and Mrs. Bevan proceeded on her errand
of mercy:
No one came to the door to answer the bell, and she
opened it herself. The passage was dimly lighted; and
without making a noise, Mrs. Bevan proceeded up the
stairs. No one was in the poor old lady's room; her
wheel-chair stood in a corner, vacant. The cupboard in
which she kept her sweat cake was open, and a glass

was on the table, as if her maid-servant, or some one,
had been emptying a decanter of wine which stood on
one of the shelves. And, on moving softly to the bed-
room-door, which was ajar, Mrs. Bevan saw through it
the maid herself, upon her es, before a drawer, appa-
rently busily engaged in ransacking its contents. A
low groan proceeded from the close curtained bed, but
Martha paid no attention to it, except to turn impatiently
round, prepared, if it had been necessary, to repress
any murmur or complaint on the part of the poor aged
sufferer by a sharp reply. Solitary-destitutefriend-
less, with no one to watch her seemingly last moments
put an unfeeling hireling, the unbappy lady was lying
on her bed of suffering. Alas! how many round us are
laying in the same state, because the Church has pro-
vided no shelter for them within her own bosom, and
under her own ministering hands! The mistress of the
house came up the stairs, but it was only to express her
complaints and wonder that Mrs. Crump had no friends to
come and attend to her, and to ask how she was to be
paid for her lodgings, and for some things which Mr.
Morgan had ordered, now that Mrs. Crump herself had
lost all her money. Mrs. Bevan had been provided with
the means of answering this question by the same hand
which had provided for the temporary necessities of Ma-
bel. A nurse was sent for, Martha was dismissed, and
the next day, with Mr. Morgan's permission, the poor
old lady was removed to Mrs. Bevan's house ; and Mabel
took her station by her bed-side, watching over every
movement, and answering every request for help, with
the tenderness of a daughter.
The next evening Charles Levan was seated in the
library at the Priory-grave, saddened, chastened with
the blow which he had received himself, and awe-struck
with the storm of calamity, which like thunder from a
cloudlesz sky, had burst upon his native town. Villiers
had been inquiring for his mother and her two charges.
" They are wonderfully well, considering what has
happened," replied Bevan.
" It is singular how engage.

appointed for us, soothes and quiets the mind. When
Miss Brook was asking, this morning at breakfast, how
she could recompense you for all your kindness, my
mother told her that she could not gratify you more than
by undertaking to nurse poor Mrs. Crump. And she
bas devoted herself to it with delight."
" And will it be painful to Mrs. Bevan," asked Villiers,
" to have her house occupied by two such inmates ?"
"My mother," replied Bevan, " has in the first place
no choice. She has been deprived of every thing but
the little which I can supply to her; and my fellowship
is only 1001. a year; and all which I may obtain beyond
this by taking pupils is of course precarious, and cannot
amount to much. But, without considering this, my
mother is a woman of remarkable good sense, of a sin.
cere but deep piety, of practical habits, and active occu-
pations ; and I am sure she would willingly devote herself
to any work, which might be really useful to others, and
sanctioned by the Church."
Villiers remained silent and absorbed in thought. At
last he said, "It is a common impression, that females
cannot be brought to live together under the same roof
without jealousies and bickerings; and that their minds
are rendered frivolous and weak by associating too much
with each other. Do you think that this is the case ?"
I think," replied Bevan, "that if females un fit for a
life of religion and charity, are forced into it against their
will, if they are rigidly and unnaturally bound down by
vows, if they are excluded from moderate intercourse with
others, and treated, in fact, like mere children, as is too
often the case in nunneries of Romanism, then their
minds, instead of being strengthened and elevated, may
be deteriorated, But I cannot see why this should be
the case, where no such strained and artificial system
exists."
" And how many duties there are," said Villiers,
** which can only be accomplished well by females, and
by females associated together in a body!' Take, for in-
stance, Miss Brook's infant school. None but females
can undertake the charge 12 rery young children or coin.

municate effectually with their parents, and teach their
parents by degrees to aid in the work of a sound educa.
tion, instead of neutralising it, or doing worse by their
own examples. And how can one female bear ihis
burden? If there were a body, while they nurtured up
the young under a cloud, as it were, of holy influences
and personal reverence, they would not run the risk of
withdrawing the child's affections from its own parents,
any more than the cloud of saints and martyrs, whom the
Church teaches us to reverence, withdraws us from the
one and only being who is to be the centre of our love;
while to fix our thoughts and affections upon a single
saint, as the Romish system encourages us to do, neces-
sarily tends to draw us from the immediate communion
with our Lordnot to speak of the powerlessness of any
single arm, either to excite reverence, or to enforce obe.
dience, or to communicate knowledge. By-the-by, what
has become of that poor young woman who had the care
of the infant school? I think you told me that she had
also sustained a heavy loss ?"
"She has lost all her savings," said Bevan.
the school itself, I fear, will now be abandoned ; for most
of our charitable subscriptions, trifling as they have been,
will probably be withdrawn. In the nineteenth century
our first retrenchment is usually in our charities, and the
second in our payment of tithes."
" And had the school no funds of its own ?" asked
Villiers.
" None whatever. Who would bestow permanent
endowments on an individual teacher, with whose death
every thing may fall to the ground, or upon a self-consti-
tuted committee of subscribers, under no ecclesiastical
control, who in a few years may become Unitarians or
anything. The very notion of endowments without spe-
cified principles, and a fixed organisation to secure their
maintenance, is an absurdity."
" Not now," replied Villiers. " Sir Robert Peel does
not think so. He has now pledged the State to sanction
and secure the perpetual transmission of property to any
hands, and for any purpose, assuming that it is a sufficient

assertion of principle to have repudjated any principle
whatever. This is the ground they have taken in the
Dissenters' Chapel Bill, as it is called,that the money
was left for the propagation of no specific doctrines, by
men who had no creed, and made it a principle to have
aone; and therefore it may be legitimately applied to
propagate any blasphemy."
Bevan sighed. But his mind was too full of sad
thoughts nearer to himself for him to enter into the polit-
ical question.
" And I suppose the subscriptions to the County Hos-
pital will also fall off," said Villiers, "and the District
Visiting Society, and, in fact, nearly all the charities?
What is to become of the poor ? "
Bevan sighed again. " I am not sure," he said,
"that the District Visiting Societies are the best things
that could be contrived for the poor. The visiters are too
often young and inexperienced. Those to whom the
office might be more safely entrusted are engaged in
family duties ; and the whole system, perhaps, requires
to be more thoroughly permeated with a sound domestic
and Church spirit. It is not equal to the Romish system
of Sisters of Charity."
" They live together," replied Villiers ; " their whole
life is devoted to the task ; they form a religious body in
the hands of the Church ; and thus they have a dignity
of their own, and a proper ecclesiastical character, which
seems very much to correspond with that of the widows
in the early Church. And from living together under
rule, and in the constant participation of the ordinances
of the Church, they acquire a tone of mind which can
scarcely be attained by individuals condemned to a sol-
itary life in the midst of the world. What an admirable
Sister of Charity Miss Brook would have made, with her
benevolence, her activity, and freedom from domestic ties!
And how far happier and more useful her life would have
been than it has been in furthering all the wild enthu.
siastic projects of a religion without a creed and without
a priesthood ?"
"One thing has struck ne much," said Bevan, "in

on
inquiries which I have made, and which seems to explain
one obvious defect in the ministration of our Visiting
Societies. I used at one time to fancy that the poor were
insensible to the value and authority of an external com.
mission. But I am convinced that it weighs with them
much, and renders them far more accessible both to those
who would instruct, and to those who would relieve them.
And the purely voluntary character of our Visiting Societies
gives an appearance of intrusiveness and presumption to
their labor, against which the independence of the poorest
is tempted to revolt."
"What are you founding your opinion on ?" asked
Villiers.
" I think it might be defended," replied Bevan,
general principles. But the facts which principally con-
firmed it in my own mind were communicated to me by a
clergyman who was sent by one of our bishops as a sort
of missionary to the laborers on a railroad. He told me
that he found them sunk in the lowest depths of ignorance
and profligacy. His business was to obtain any oppor
tunities which he could find of speaking to them, and of
reading to them on the Sundays. And among many other
itnecdotes, he told me that whatever abuse he encountered
from them at first, or whatever reluctance they showed to
listen to him, it ceased when he explained to them that he
did not come of himself, but was sent by the bishop. "Ah,
sir,' they used to say, ' if you are sent by the bishop, that
is quite another thing. We thought you were a methodist

think, then," he said, " that if any institution like that of
the Sisters of Charity was formed in the English Church,
it should be regularly commissioned by the bishop of the
diocese?"
"Certainly," said Bevan; "and placed under the
immediate control of the clergyman of the parish. With-
out this they would become either futile or mischievous.'
" Poor Dr. Grant," said Villiers, " would, I fear, be
very much alarmed to hear of such a plan, By-the. by,
how is he, since this second paralytic seizure?"

" He is very ill," replied Bevan. "Mr. Morgan told
me, as I came here, that he was much alarmed for him.
He, like so many others, has lost almost all that he had
-all the accumulations from the profits of the living;
and the shock was too great for him."
" And how should such an institution he supported ?":
asked Villiers, after a pause.
" Partly by a small endowment," replied Bevan,
"partly by the small incomes which the members them.
selves would bring into the common stock, partly by
voluntary offerings, and partly by little payments from
the school. But I think you would find many persons,
such as daughters of clergymen, widows, young females
born in respectable positions in society, and left with a
narrow income, who would gladly take advantage of an
institution well planned, and authorized by the heads of
the Church, and who would devote themselves to works
of benevolence and charity as a corporate body. And
still more inight be found who, though they could not
contribute funds, might render most valuable assistance,
and be easily supported from the common stock. How
many females there are around us left solitary in the
world, without any home for their affections, any definite
object for their labors, any community of interest or of
feeling with their neighbors, any legitimate vent for zeal
and energy, who, with the loss of those external appli-
ances by which the world measures respectability, lose
their own self-respect, or, in the absence of directions
from the Church, throw their religious and devotional
warmth into channels even of heresy and of schism!
What a blessing it would be to such minds to have a
home prepared for them, where the old might retire to a
holy rest and preparation for the grave, nursed with a
sisterly care, and devoted to meditation and
prayer, and
the younger might be trained in the discipline of a holy
obedience and a modest activity, living under rule, and
sheltered from the vanities and temptations of a life
without dignity and without duty."
And as Bevan said this he looked up in Villiers's face,
and olserved that he wis engagea deeply in thought.

At last Villiers observed, " I have often admired that
little grey gabelled building which adjoins Mrs. Bevan's
house. Whom does it belong to ?"
" It is the remains," replied Bevan, " of an old
institution, not unlike the one which we have been
sketching out-a sort of bguinage. The old archway
which led into it is still standing, and there are several
windows with the stone mullions perfect, only blocked
up with brick: The very chapel is remaining in a back
yard; but it is now turned into a cow-house.
destroyed at the Reformation."
" And the river runs close by it, does it not?" said
Villiers, " through that meadow with the large elms in.
it, just under the churchyard ?".
Yes," replied Bevan. "I suppose the site was
chosen from its closeness to the church, that the inmates
might be able to attend the service regularly."
" And you think," said Villiers, smiling, " that Miss
Brook would make a suitable inmate of such an establish-
ment? Where can we find a head?"
6* And once more Bevan looked up; for there was an
evident meaning in Villiers's words beyond the mere
question. " I know one," he said, " who would gladly
devote herself to such a work, if properly commenced,
and sanctioned by the heads of the Church."
" Do you mean Mrs. Bevan?" asked Villiers.
Bevan bowed assent.
"Such an institution might prove a blessed refuge,"
continued Villiers, "to many of the sufferers at Hawk-
stone at this moment. When I think what an awful,
and what a sweeping calamity has fallen upon the place,
I am almost tempted to think that it must have been the
scene of some dreadful sin. The lightnings do not fall,
except where there is something to attract them."
It has been the scene," replied Bevan, " for years
and years, of a neglect of God-of coldness and apathy,
at least, to his honor and glory. It has been haunted
by heresy and schism; and heresy and schism have led
to a refusal of the just means of supporting the public
worship of the Chur:h, to the withdrawal of tithes and

255
offerings, and to the contempt of God's ministers. And
where these crimes have been committed, we have the
voice of the Bible itself declaring that a curse will fall.
And we have added to these sins the sins of civil licen-
tiousness, of disobedience to rulers, and of contempt of
authority. And upon this we have heaped other crimes
-pride, arrogance, covetousness, trampling on the poor,
hardheartedness, defrauding the hireling of his wages,
boasting of our strength and knowledge, and of the multi-
tude of our riches; thinking that no want of punishment
could reach us; vaunting our enlightenment, dishonoring
our parents, tampering with divine truth, sacrificing our
creed and our Church to human policy and worldly in-
trigue. Is not this sufficient to account for such a
punishment ? Where such attraction as this exists, could
the lightning do otherwise than fall? And will it noi
fall soon upon the whole of England, unless it repents of
the same guilt ?"
Villiers sighed deeply.
" And when," continued Bevan, " our unhappy friend
Bentley, as alive as we are to these sins and these perils,
had devoted himself to correct and remove them, he
thought to move the mountain by his single arm; and
rather increased the evil than diminished it by setting
forth self-will and lawlessness in religion as a cure for
self-will and lawlessness in all other things. He, also,
has met his fate."
" And no more tidings, then, have been heard of
him?" asked Villiers, mournfully.
" None," replied Bevan. " He left his lodging the
day before yesterday, sending word to his housekeeper
that he should not return. He must have gone out of
the town early after daybreak, or even before. Indeed,
he had been so insulted and assailed with the most coarse
and virulent abuse, that I can well understand his wish.
ing to quit it unobserved. He took leave of me the night
before in the most affectionate manner, and charged me
to give you what I have already brought you, his small
Bible, as the only token which he could send of his
gratitude and reverence toward you. And though he did

not tell me what he contemplated, I could perceive that
he had resolved on taking some step of the kind, and on
leaving the place for a time, until the storm should blow
over. Indeed, I recommended him myself to go to his
friends. But he has no parents living.
" Poor man!" said Villiers ; " what a cruel position
o be placed in, and how hopeless! What will be his
fate ?"
" To become an outcast from society," replied Bevan,
"a branded disgrace to his profession, a beggar, perhaps,
in the streets, or, at the best, to drag on in some unknown
corner of the earth, a desolate, destitute existence-
trembling at every rumor, and shrinking from every eye,
till he finds a refuge from misery and shame only in the
grave. No shelter is open in our Church for such a case,
no homes in this country, which, when a father and
mother desert us, may take us up, and rescue us from
the cruelty and mockery of the world, in the name of
the father and of the mother of us all. Alas! poor Eng.
land !"
"We must endeavor to trace him," said Villiers.
"Perhaps, even now, some refuge of the kind might be
provided for him. Let us not despair." And Villiers
took up a roll of drawings which lay before him, and
proceeded with Bevan to examine the plans for restoring
the Priory of Hawkstone.
CHAPTER XVIII.
A few days afterwards Villiers knocked at the door of
an elegant modern house in one of the principal streets
of London. The door was opened by a portly butler
in purple livery, attended by two other domestics, who
bore evident marks of the hospitality of the servants'
hall, and not less of the effects and temptations of a
Lonilon life up on that class of domestics. Villiers was

ushered up a broad well-carpeted flight of steps into an
elegantly furnished drawing-room. A lady with several
daughters were sitting thereone at the harp, another
at the piano, another at an embroidery frame, destined
for a gorgeous gilt ottoman which stood in the centre
of the apartment. Morning visiters were engaged in
discussing the dinner party of yesterday, and the ball of
the approaching night. Tickets lay on the table for the
Ancient Concert, and various other places of amusernent.
Mixed with china dishes and elegant bijous, were scat-
tered the latest parliamentary pamphlets, and a variety
of religious works ; and in one corner, on a small table,
lay a manual of family devotion. One picture occupied
the wall over the fireplace, and it represented a very
nleasing, gentlemanly, well-dressed man, seated on a sofa
at an elegant writing-table, one leg thrown carelessly
over the other, and his pen balanced gracefully in his
hand, while before him lay open a letter addressed to
the Right Reverend Father in God the Lord Bishop of
F-
The bishop himself, as the lady informed Villiers, was
at that moment engagedindeed, every moment of his
time was occupied. The old Bishop of M-was so
infirm, that his diocese had been wholly neglected, till
parliament had appointed the Bishop of F-to take
charge of it; and the Bishop of F-, having already
an enormous diocese of his own, containing more than a
million of souls, and occupied chiefly by a manufacturing
population, had vainly remonstrated against this increased
burden. The post, as the lady continued to observe,
brought him such a multitude of letters, that half the day
was occupied in answering them. His secretary scarce.
ly found time to take exercise ; and just now the new
principles and opinions reviving in the Church caused
so many difficulties, and required such nice considerations
and adjustments, that in the bishop's anxiety to support
his conscientious clergymen, to guide the doubtful, to re-
press the hasty, and to satisfy all, he had involved him.

from one class, and the indiscretions committed by ano-
ther, he had been attacked by a serious illness, from
which he was only just recovering.
The young ladies were preparing to engage Villiers's
interest in a more light and agreeable discussion of the
merits of a new French novel, which lay open on the
table, when the portly butler opened the drawing-room
door, and his lordship himself appeared. Villiers was a
man of too much importance to be received as ordinary
visiters, or his clergy. And to the profound, filial, and
almost awful reverence, with which Villiers stood before
him, as if to receive his blessing, the kind, amiable, and
courteous bishop responded with a politeness and defer
ence, which disturbed and perplexed Villiers, he scarcely
knew why. He apologised for having detained Villiers
so long, assured him that he had been obliged to dismiss
four curates who were waiting in London to see him,
and proceeded to the usual topics of conversation in a
morning visit. And it was only when Villiers apolo
gised for intruding on time so important, and requested a
private audience on business of some moment, that his
lordship conducted him to his library. It was a large
lofty room, looking out on the smoky back court of a
London house, full of papers, reports, letters, documents,
pamphlets, plans, subscription-lists ; but it contained no
books. The bishop had no time to read: he was an
elegant scholar, a sound divine ; but study was now im-
possible. The secretary, who was writing at a side-table,
was dismissed. And every five minutes the door-bell
rang, and one after another the butler announced, that
in the next room was waiting the Reverend Mr. Darling,
to consult his lordship on the conduct of his Unitarian
church warden ; the church wardens of Ringold, to com-
plain of their clergyman for reviving the offertory: the
Reverend Mr. Montague, a deacon just ordained, and
placed alone in a cure of three thousand souls, to request
advice respecting the burial of an unbaptized Dissenter;
the archdeacon, to deliberate with his bishop on the use
of the surplice in the pulpit ; the secretary of the Chris-
tian Knowledge Society, to submit some tracts for his

approval; a deputation of dissenting ministers, to request
bim to accept the patronage of a Bible Society ; besides
the bishop's steward, with the accounts of a newly-drop-
ped fine ; and the chairman of the Benevolent Institu-
tion, to solicit nim to preach a sermon in its behalf. Still
the bishop, only once looking at his watch, resolved to
devote at least a quarter of an hour to a man of such ex.
cellence, influence, and importance as Villiers. And
Villiers, though he feared that little could be done in
such a space, endeavored to explain his plans with res-
pect to Hawkstone, and to obtain his lordship's appro.
bation and support, and, what Villiers still more desired,
his superintending and controlling hand. But the quarter
of an hour had elapsed before Villiers could even ap-
proach the principal part of the communication which he
wished to make. And with real regret the bishop heard
his servant announce that the carriage was at the door,
which was to take him to the House of Lords to a com-
mittee of privileges. He offered Villiers a seat in it,
that he might continue the conversation ; but Villiers
thought it better to wait for a more favorable opportu-
nity. And the hour when the bishop was engaged to
the committee of privileges was the same at which Vil-
liers himself had been always accustomed, when in Lon-
don, to attend the afternoon service in Westminster Ab.
bey. He congratulated himself that, as a layman, he:
could enjoy a blessing, from which even the heads of the
Church were excluded by the pressure of business. And
the bishop, kindly shaking him by the hand, and wishing
that he could find in his diocese many more such laymen,
and at the same time wondering and half-doubting whe-
ther or not Villiers himself was a safe man, and unin-
fected with Oxford extravagances, requested him to com-
municate freely with his archdeacon, and promised that
as soon as the pressure of business was removed (when
this was to happen he could not foresee) he would give
attention to his valuable plan.
It was with a chilled and heavy heart that Villiers
took his leave of the amiable man, the elegant scholar,
the sincere Christian, the intelligent, active, zealous ruler

of his diocese, who, but for that presure of business which
absorbed even the hours of devotion, and secularised
even bis elevated mind, might have proved an angel and
apostle of the Church. But his thoughts reverted to
Hawkstone, and he suffered them to become fixed on its
state, its prospects, and his own duties connected with it,
till he found that he had reached the abbey.
That night Villiers had a dream. He thought that
he was on his way to see the good bishop, and to beseech
his guidance and control, as a son would ask for counsel
from a father. But instead of the streets of London, he
fancied himself in an ancient, silent, and almost deserted
cityloaded, as it were, with heavy, quaint. overhanging
houses, mixed here and there with old carved stone por-
tals and sculptured gateways. There were high stone
walls, grey and lichened with aye; richly wrought
churches, standing each in its quiet churchyard; old
massive mansions with court-yards and groves around
them; low modest almshouses and hospitals clustered
round silent cloisters, dim with shade, but sweet with
flowers ; and, in the midst, embosomed in
of
limes, above which the rooks were cawing and soaring
like a cloud, rose the vast, solemn, gigantic towers of an
ancient cathedral. He fancied that he passed down
the solemn avenue of limes, with the tombstones gleam-
ing tranquilly on each side; the low deep portals of the
venerable pile were open, and Villiers reverently entered ;
and as he entered he thought the organ pealed forth its
solemn volumes, and from one of the side aisles appeared
a train of white-robed worshippers, a choir of boys, a
procession of priests, and then one bearing on high a
cross, and another with a crosier, behind whom followed
slowly, with eyes cast down, and hands folded on the
breast, the same good bishop from whom he had parted
in the morning. There was the same lofty brow, the
same benevolent eye, the same dignity and benignity of
I:ien. But there was something else : Villiers felt, but
could not describe it,-a shade, a tone of spiritual life,
thrown over his whole demeanour, as if his very being
were tinged and colored with hours of prayer, of fasting
a tall
grove

of meditation, of study, of holy peace and patient suffer.
ing, and fruitful labor. The beautiful ritual of the church
was chanted forth, but by the whole congregation, not by
a paid choir only. And when the blessing had been
pronounced from the throne, and the little procession wa 3
winding its way back through the long-drawn aisles,
there ranged themselves on each side, the poor, the aged,
the widows, the young, the children of the schools, and
not a few of the wealthy inhabitants of the city, looking
for a repetition of the same blessing, as from their vene.
rated father, as he passed.
Villiers thought that the good bishop saw him, and
beckoned him to follow. And when the procession had
reached a massive deep-arched gateway, the bishop dis-
missed all but his attendant clergy, and taking Villiers
by the hand, led him into a lofty refectory. A table was
spread, simple almost to frugality. The bishop seated
bimself at the head; and beneath him were ranged
twelve clergymen in a priestly dress, who were the hands,
the ears, and the eyes by which he swayed his diocese,
and who never left him. Strangers also and invited
guests were there, for the bishop's palace was the centre
of hospitality to the whole diocese. And the clergy,
when they visited the city, never were compelled to fre-
quent an inn. But there was one table filled with poor,
and other tables occupied by young students, whom the
bishop, with the assistance of his chaplains, was rearing
up, as in a nursery for the Church. And instead of
liveried lacqueys, the little services required were admin-
istered by a few quiet and simple attendants, themselves
in grave attire, and who seemed to be recognised and
treated rather as brethren than as servants. A solemn
grace was chanted, a portion of Scripture read, and then
with sober cheerfulness all were welcomed to a meal,
from which every needless luxury was scrupulously ex-
cluded, and every needful comfort plentifully provided.
And there was grave and even solemn talk, chastened
with benignity and courtesy. And Villiers thought that
the bishop led him on to speak of his own plans and
wishes ; and when the repast was over brought him into

his own apartment, undecorated, unluxurious, but file
with books, and furnished for prayer.
And there ne
listened to the young man's petitions for aid, and his in-
quiries for wisdom. And he intermixed his questions
with answers, now warning, now checking, now advising,
now encouraging, and with promises of aid and counsel
whenever it should be required. And when Villiers was
about to withdraw, he thought the holy man bade him
kneel down, and raising his hands to heaven, implored a
blessing upon his head, and the comfort of God's Holy
Spirit in all his works.
But Villiers was wakened from his dream by the
rolling of a carriage, which stopped at the house adjoin-
ing the hotel, and which house was the palace of the
Bishop of  It was the bishop's agreeable daugh-
ters returning from a London party.
CHAPTER XIX.
And now once more, and for the last time, we may pass
over a space of about eight years, and at the expiration
of that time we may place ourselves in front of the Blake
Arms Inn at Howlas, and observe how the house has
been restored and enlarged, and more accommodation
provided for commercial gentlemen, their gigs and their
horses. Mr. Bonsor also is still there, and his bustling
wife, and even Mary the maid ; but her services in the
commercial room have been supplanted by those of a
waiter, for Howlas from a straggling wilderness of houses
has swelled into an enormous town, black, dirty, filled
with vice, and misery, and poverty, and surrounded by a
forest of chimneys vomiting smoke, and of iron-works
flaming, and grinding, and roaring, and of coal-pits ab.
sorbing in the bowels of the earth half the population
each day, and disgorging them again at night, like naked
demons, exhausted with labor, and ghastly with crime.

Near to it also have arisen a number of vast, many-win-
dowed fabrics, lighted up like palaces all night long, to
celebrate not the orgies of pleasure, nor the solemnities
of worship, but the tortures of midnight labor, Mr
Smith is the owner of one, to which he has removed his
establishment from Hawkstone ; and the dammed-up
mountain stream, or rather torrent, which supplied tho
Hawkstone river, indicates that its manufacturing impor-
tance is duly appreciated.
A horn is heard at the end of the street, and though
there are no less than three other inns, or as they call
themselves, hotels, in the place, Mr. Bonsor's activity
and Villiers's constant patronage and support have given
to the Blake Arms the means of standing its ground, so
that one of the four omnibuses which ply to the new rail-
way station always sets down passengers at the door. The
horn which we hear indicates an arrival of the kind; and.
if we do not mind waiting a few minutes at the door,
watching the movements of some anxious-looking police-
men, who are endeavoring to disperse a knot of sulky,
ill-looking mechanics at the corner of the street, we may
be enabled to witness the arrival. The first who de.
scends from the vehicle is a stout, close-shaven, sinister-
looking person, respectably dressed in black, and bearing
in his whole appearance that singular indescribable as.
pect of mystery and intrigue which is too often found
connected with the looks of the worst specimens of Ro.
mish ecclesiastics. Notwithstanding the impassive, iron-
like expression of his countenance, he cannot prevent a
slight quiver from disturbing his muscles as he seems to
recognise the house ; and he even asks if there is no
other inn. But Mr. Bonsor comes up to him invitingly,
though not without anxiety in his countenance; and the
stranger follows him, though reluctantly, into the house
and asks for a private room, and into this he is followed
by a companion.
To this companion we must now request the especial
attention of the reader. He was young, scarcely more
than about nineteen years of age, but tall, well-formed,
graceful in his movements, so far as a natural instinct

and elegance has not been suppressed and destroyed by
habitual association with evil. His dress was decent,
but foreign ; his hair fair and glossy, curled thick over an
open fore-head; his nose, his chin, the curves of his lips
and of his eyebrows, were all delicately drawn by nature.
A slight and premature moustache gave him the aspect
of a foreigner ---of one, at least, who had been living in
a foreign country. And youth would indeed have been
beautiful in him, but for the coarse lines and swollen
features which, even thus early, indicated familiarity with
vice. The elder of the two travellers, having carefully
deposited on a table a writing.case elaborately strapped
and buckled, and having bidden the younger see that their
carpet-bags were safely removed from the omnibus,
closed the door, examined some cupboards which were
in the room, tried the lock of a door which opened into
another apartment, even looked searchingly under the
sofa, and then seated himself before the fire-place, and,
with his feet raised upon the fender, proceeded to medi-
tate. His thoughts apparently were not of the most
agreeable nature, for his brow worked convulsively, and
his lips at times even quivered ; but on the return of his
young companion he started up, and resumed his usual
composure, though he could not suppress a glance of
contempt, followed by a malignant satisfaction, when the
young man rang the bell, and ordered brandy and water,
which he swallowed greedily, and then with a coarse and
blasphemous oath bade the waiter leave the room.
" And so you are going down to Hawkstone to-night,"
asked the young man, after a pause.
6. When shall you
be back ? and what am I to do in the mean time ?"
" Drink yourself drunk, I suppose,"? answered the
elder, with a sneer.
The young man only laughed, and uttered anotles
oath.
" And what in the world are you going to do here ?"
he said again, turning from the window.
6 What a
mystery you are making of all this! Look there," he
cried; "what is the meaning of those policemen and
:his mob coming up the street ? And why are all the

" Here you
windows of these shops blocked up ?" And with the
impetuosity of a mind delighting in excitement, however
vicious, he would have rushed into the street, but Pearce
(for be it was) siezed him and held him fast.

must stay here," he said ; " if you were to go out, you
might ruin all."

are again at your mysteries ! Of all mysterious men I
ever met with, you are the worst. You have brought
me all the way from Lyons without telling me what you
are about. And then you leave me in this filthy place.
I tell you what, Mr. Pearce, I must know something
more of your proceedings, or you will not find me so
compliant as I have been.'
Pearce, though a little alarmed at the bold and reso-
lute tone of his companion, looked on him sternly and
contemptuously, as if endeavoring to crush his resistance
at once; but the young man met his gaze fixedlyand
even Pearce was obliged to withdraw his eye.
6. You
may do as you like, Master Ernest, said Pearce; "it
matters little to me. I have been your friend through life,
when every one else had deserted you. But for me you
would have starved; and it is in my power, as I have
told you again and again, to make you a great man, and
richer than you have any notion of.
But unless you
choose to put yourself into my hands, and do what ever)
command, you go back into the streets, and beg yo'li
bread."
And Pearce was preparing to leave the room, but the
young man stopped him.
- When shall you be back, then?" he asked.
"Perhaps to-morrow," answered Pearce,"perhaps
not for a week.
66 And I
suppose
I am to remain here ?" replied the
young man, sulkily.
Yes," answered Pearce ; "if you do what I bid you,
and wish me to be of any use to you, you will remain here
quietly, till I return or send for you.
" And what am I to do for money?" asked the other,
Pearce went to the table, and opened his desk to tako

out some sovereigns, but as he was stooping over it the
young man threw himself upon him with a sudden spring
and ferocious oath. " Mr. Pearce," he exclaimed, "I
will see what there is in that desk of yours; you shall
show me that packet of papers.
I will not be trifled with
any more."
But, active and vigorous, and determined as the youth
was, Pearce was too robust and resolute to be taken by
surprise; and with a sudden effort he shook his assailant
from him, threw him to the other end of the room, locked
his desk calmly, and took it under his arm.
" It will not do," he said to the disappointed and pas.
sionate youth," it will not do. Make up your mind to
obey me, or I give you up. The papers are not in that
desk, even if you had got possession of it. Do you think I
am such a fool as to risk the loss of them in that
way - ?"
The youth muttered something sullenly, but Pearce
took no notice of it.
" And what am I to do here?" asked the youth.
" You told me, when we came away from Lyons, that ]
should find plenty to do here ; and that I need not enlist,
if I wanted to have a more stirring life than you kept me
to in France. There is no fighting going on here-is
there, as there was the last time? Is not this the very
house they burned down then ?"
Pearce said nothing.
"I wonder what became of that gentleman," asked
the youth," whom they wanted to get at and tear to pieces
then ? I wonder if he is alive still? I shall not forget
his dragging me out of the fire, down there in Hawkstone,

have done the same thing for him, and have given him
the ladder when he cried out for it in this very house, out
of the garret window, only you boxed my ears, and pulled
me away."
Pearce still continued silent.
" Is there any more of that work going on," asked
the young man,

derhand way-writing letters, and receiving them every
day, and going about in all sorts of strange figures ? Are

you going to have a rebellion ? Is there to be any fighting,
Mr. Pearce, once for all ? Answer me that."
" And do you want to fight?" asked Pearce, quietly.
Anything for a stirring life," replied the young man.
"anything rather than be moping about doing nothing.
I want to see life, instead of being penned and cooped up
as I have been."
" Perhaps," replied Pearce, "there may be more
chances of fighting here than you
think for ; and more
means of seeing life, and of getting on in life, too, foi a
young man of spirit."
"I wish I could find them!" said the youth. But he
was interrupted by Mr. Bonsor coming into the room with
a frightened countenance, and requesting that they would
remove into a back room, and allow him to put up the
shutters.  A mob," he said, "had collected in the
market-place, and was coming up the street; and the
policemen were not strong enough to disperse them, and
soldiers had been sent for: and if there should be
any
disturbance, it might not be safe to be on the ground-floor,
particularly if shots were fired, as they had been three
days before, when two men had been killed."
"A mob!" exclaimed the young man, " fighting !
soldiers ! that's capitaljust the thing !" And once
more he would have rushed out of the room, but Pearce
stoopped him, without expressing the slightest surprise at
the news, or making any further inquiries of Bonsor,
who, nevertheless, without encouragement, except from
the younger of the two travellers, proceeded to enlarge on
the turbulent and alarming state of the district-an out-
break expected every day-special constables sworn in

cavalry and three pieces of artillery sent down to Hake-
well barracks-and the same state of things in other parts

And were, at the same time, pending quarrels and
negotiations which threatened a war with France ; and
Ireland was organised under its priests, ready to take part
in any rebellious movement or foreign invasion. The

upon a dirty newspaper which lay upon the table, and
read out some paragraphs to the same effect; but Pearce
paid no attention to them.
I suspect," said Ernest at last to his companion,
" that you know more about these things than you are
willing to tell every one."
" It may be," replied Pearce, " and it may not."
" And what kind of fellows are they," continued the
young man, " who are preparing for this fun ?"
"Very fine fellows," replied Pearce.
" Do you know any of them ?" asked Ernest.
But Pearce made no reply.
At last he said, " And if you were to know anything
of them, what would you do?"
Join with them, and fight, to be sure," replied
Ernest.
"Fight for what ?" asked Pearce, curiously.
"For anything," replied Ernest ; "for fun-for the
mere pleasure of fighting. What were one's arms made
for-a gentleman's arms, that is ? (and you tell me I am
a gentleman)-not to work upon the roads, or to sit all day
at a spinning-jenny."
" You would make a fine soldier," observed Pearce,
" if you had not been intended for something better. But
now you must come with me ; and if you do as I tell you,
there is no saying what you may find yourself some fine
day. Do
you intend to trust to me or not?"
"I suppose I must," answered the youth, sulkily.
" But I must have some inoney to amuse me.

wonder where you get all your money from, Mr. Pearce."
Pearce, however, made no answer, but put on his
great-coat, and taking his writing-case under his arm, he
made a sign for Ernest to accompany him.

the street." And though his companion stopped, and
listened anxiously to the shouts and tumult which now
reached them from the advancing mob, and would willingly
have rushed into the middle of the fray, Pearce took him
by the arm, and led him reluctantly into the back court.

" All built up again, I see, since the fire," said his
companion. "I remember every place as well as if it
was yesterday. There is the very wall I climbed over,
and here is the wood-house, and the cistern into which
the gentleman nearly tumbled. I cannot recollect what
his name was-can you ?"
But Pearce hurried on without answering : and after
passing through the garden, he led the way up by a bye
lane, and at last stopped before a high whitewashed wall,
in which was a narrow door. He knocked, and it was
opened from the inside. Pearce, stepping in, said a few
words in French to the person within, and then called
to Ernest to enter; and though the young man hesitated
for a moment, and showed signs of doubt and reluctance,
Pearce, with an authoritative voice, overpowered the
suspicion which came to his mind, and they both entered,
and the door once more closed upon them.
The same evening, a few hours after this, there was
seen standing near the ancient Priory, under Prior Silk
stede's oak, and gazing curiously on the scene around
him, a sturdy mendicant, habited as one who had travelled
a long journey on foot, and could second his petition for
alms with a moving and plausible tale of distress, whether
it was the loss of all his little property by fire, or a mur-
rain among his cattle, or a hardhearted landlord. He
had a rough crab-tree stick in his hand, and a dirty, well-
thumhed, and well-signed petition in his pocket. His
black shaggy hair disguised much of his features; but
those who had observed the twinkling, cunning, malig-
nant, but powerful eyes of Mr. Pearce would have found
little difficulty in recognising him again, even in his
present habiliments. And as he gazed on the scene
before him, a dark scowl gathered on his brow, and his
teeth ground together in passion.
And yet the landscape in itself was not one to call
up such feelings in any ordinary spectator. It was ex-
quisitely beautiful-cheerful, and yet solemn. In the

oaks, and carpeted with fern and moss, stood the pile, no
longer in ruins, of the ancient Priory of Hawkstone. A
hand of exquisite taste and feeling had restored it to its
original state, as nearly as was consistent with the pur-
poses to which it was now applied. There was the
quadrang!e surrounded with its low buildings, appropriated
to the chambers of its inmates; and every mullioned
window, and clustered chimney, and jutting buttress, and
sculptured corbel, bore the impress of a master's art.
On one side rose the tower, massive, simple, and grey,
and relieved by the rich oriel which projected over the
gateway, and by a delicately carved niche, surmounted
with a rich-wrought canopy. On the right was the hall,
lighted with tall narrow windows, and crowned with its
louvre. And up to it led a porch, with a rich but low-
browed arch, and flight of broad stone steps, about which
ivy and creepers were already twining, and tinting the
grey stone with the colors of age. At one angle stood
a slender turret, perforated at the top with narrow open
lancets, and from this, at the moment when the mendicant
was gazing on the pile, a silvery bell was ringing to call
the inmates of the edifice to their evening repast. To
the south the quadrangle was open, and admitted the
bright warm sunshine into a cloister green with honey.

ing the whole as with a diadem. The inendicant gazed
on it, and again he ground his teeth in passion. But his
attention was called away by the appearance of an old
but respectable peasant in a green
old
age,
who had met Villiers the first day of his arrival at the
Priory, under Lady Esther's pine-trees. He asked the
usual questions of the beggar, who answered them plau-
sibly, and satisfactorily, and as one who had known
better days; and the old peasant became communicative.
If you want relief," he said, " you have only to go
to the great gate and tell your tale, and if they are satisfied
with it, you will be welcome to a meal and a lodging for

the night. No poor man goes away from it without help,
if he seems to deserve it. And they are not hard in
examining you. Mr. Villiers is not hard either. Many
a time has he told me that he would rather relieve three
rogues than refuse to relieve one honest man. We call
this our Hawkstone poor-house-a very different one
from those you see elsewhere !"
* And is it Mr. Villiers who has built this? :' asked
the mendicant.
The peasant nodded his head.
" And who lives here?" asked the mendicant.
* There are twelve gentlemen," ans vered the peasant
" clergymen most of them. Andere is a head-the
warden they call him. Mr. Beattie is his name. And
they have often other gentlemen staying with them,
mostly clergymen; but some of them Mr. Villiers's
friends, lords and others, who come here to read and be
quiet, generally about Lent time. And there are a
number of other young gentlemen who are going to be

" And are they liked ?" asked Pearce, significantly.
They are Papists, are they not?"
" Papists !" exclaimed the peasant ;
no more than
you and I are Papists. People tried at one time to per-
suade us they were; but we soon found out the difference.
But if you want some supper you had better make haste,
for the supper-bell is down.''
The mendicant hesitated. At last he summoned up
courage, and composing his countenance, and preparing
his tale, he ventured boldly up to the porter's lodge under
the entrance-tower. One of the Fellows (Villiers had
chosen the name as less likely than that of brothers to
shock prejudices by unfounded associations with monas.

and having listened kindly to his story, he called the
porter to bring water for the beggar to wash his hands,

escutcheons of a benefactor or a bishop, were lighted up
at this moment with the last rays of the setting sun.
There was a raised dais, at which were seated about
twenty of the elder inmates, all dressed alike, and in
gowns of a black stuff. At the head of them Pearce,
even at that distance of time, recognised Beattie, and
afraid of being recognised himself, not withstanding his
disguise, he gladly slunk to the end of a table in the
centre of the hall, at which were seated twelve poor
people like himself. It was one of the principles of
Hawkstone Priory to partake of no meal without sharing
it with some of their poorer neighbors.
A simple bui substantial supper was served up to
him, during which Pearce looked round and observed
the other tables filled with scholars, attired in gowns
like the companions. And even Pearce was affected
with their quietness, propriety, and reverential manner.
The attendants also, he observed, were habited like the
rest, though in coarser gowns, and were treated more as
associates in the same community than as hirelings and
servants. The meal orer, a simple but solemn grace in
Latin was chanted from the high table, and closed with
a full and swelling Amen from the whole body; and the
Warden, followed by the rest, two and two, proceeded to
leave the hall. He stopped to say a few words of kind-
ness to a poor old man, who had been seated next to the
mendicant, and he made some inquiries of the mendicant
himself; but with all Pearce's power of dissimulation,
he could scarcely answer them coolly And Beattie
could not help remarking to a gentleman, who walked at
his right hand, on the sinister expression of the beggar's
countenance. The gentleman turned and looked back
on him, and his eyes met those of the mendicant, which
lighted up with an expression of intense hatred, as they
gazed upon the countenance of Villiers. Villiers himself
felt a strange indescribable sensation thrill through him,
and waken, as it were, a whole train of old and strange
associations, which transported him to a distant clime,
and almost absorbed the consciousness of the objects
before him. But he had long since schooled l'imself to

reject from his thoughts whatever inight tend to occupy
him with vain regrets, and morbid imaginations. And
though night after night his dreams brought back to him
the image of his wife and of his child, and he never knelt

if heaven so willed, the lost might still be restored to
him, he never permitted himself to indulge day-dreams.

dicant, but the mendicant had averted his head, and
Villiers then followed Beattie to his own apartments.
" And now," he said, when the door had closed, and
Beaitie had been seated, by Villiers's own hand, in his
massive abbatial chair, -"now I can communicate to you
the object of my coming, before the bell rings for chapel.
He is found at last. Let us be thankful."
66 Who is found ?" asked Beattie.
" Our poor lost friend, Bentley," answered Villiers.
"But I will read you the letter which I received this morn-
ing. And we must lose no time in sending or going to
him, and bringing him here. It comes from Carrington,
up in the most remote part of Durham; and I have heard
something of the writer, who is the clergyman of the
parish."
Beattie composed himself to hear, and Villiers pro-
ceeded to read the letter:
6. Sir,
" I am sure you will excuse the liberty which I am
taking in addressing you. The interest which you have
yourself shown in the unhappy person who is the subject
of my letter, will sufficiently excuse me. I am the rector
of the parish of Carrington, in the north of Durham ; and
as such have been made acquainted with a case of the
deepest distress. About eight years since, a gentleman.
evidently of education and superior manners, but seem.
ingly without means of supporting himself, came into this
parish. He took a very small room in a cottage near
to the church, and for some time secluded himself wholly
from observation, rarely appearing out of doors till dusk,
and shunning every ccnmnication even with the poor

widow in whose cottage he lodged. From her I learn);
ed, after a time, that his means appeared to be exhausted.
He was punctual in his attendance at Church, on every
occasion, but studiously placed himself out of the sight of
the congregation, in the lowest and worst seats among the
poor ; and the piety, yet deep dejection, and shame, and
remorse, which were visible in his manner, could not fail
to interest me. For some time I observed that he never
attended at the Holy Communion. At last, once or twice,
I saw him lingering and hesitating, when the rest of the
congregation was departing; and I made another effort
to see him, calling on him, and addressing him when we
met, as we sometimes did meet, in our walks ; but he
evinced such decided reserve and reluctance to hold any
communication with me, that I was obliged to give up
the attempt, and to wait for a more favorable opportunity.
He did, however, at last, and apparently with a great
effort, present himself at the holy table ; and I shall never
forget the intense expression of awe and misery, and yet
of hope, with which he bowed his head down to receive
the sacred elements. It affected me so much that I could
not refrain from following him to his miserable home
after the service was concluded ; and, without wearying
you with details, it is sufficient to say, that, touched and
penetrated with holy influences, and encouraged by the
sympathy which I felt for him, he commuicated to me,
under a promise of inviolable secrecy, so much of his un-
happy story as he felt himself at liberty to explain. That
person was the Rev. Mr. Bentley, about eight years since
the curate of Hawkstone, and whom, by his own account,
you yourself had rescued about that time from a situation
of great danger. He told me partially the circumstances
under which he had been involved in that danger, and
his history after it. You are aware that advantage was
taken, partly by public scandal, and partly, it would seem,
'y the agency of personal enemies, to calumniate his
character in the grossest manner; and unable to refute
the charges, in consequence of the insanity of the poor
woman to whose defence he was sacrificed, and involved
also in an appearance of mystery, owing to his rigid

275
conscientiousness in observing his unhappy outh, you
are also aware that he was unable to withstand the
storin, and abandoned his post. Although his bishop er.
pressed himself satisfied with his innocence, he was
unable to protect or even to exculpate him in the eyes of
the world. His friends received him with a coldness and
suspicion so galling that he resolved to submit to any
sacrifice rather than remain in dependance upon them;
and he fled here, to this remote and lonely village, not to
live (for he had no means of living), but to sink in silence
into the grave under the fearful curse of a blighted fame.
" After this communication my intercourse with him
became frequent; but it was admitted by him only under
a solemn pledge from me that I would not betray his
residence to his friends. And, though I endeavored to
impress on him that an oath illegally exacted was not
binding, I found that, like many other persons brought
up in his views of religion, while there was considerable
laxity in some points of moral obligation, there was in
others an over-scruplous and superstitious conscientious-
ness, which nothing could overcome. Nor indeed, as it
appeared, was it possible for bim to remove wholly the
suspicions which naturally attached to certain circum-
stnces in the case.
"My own means were so small that I could only
assist him by procuring for him a few pupilsthe chil.
dren of neighboring farmers, whom he instructed in
reading and writing; and in this manner he earned a
scanty pittance, scarcely sufficient to support him. But
from the moment when he had opened himself to me,
and we were enabled to associate together more freely,
a great load seemed to be taken from his mind; and
everything which I have witnessed in him has more and
more confirmed my conviction of his innocence and up-
rightness. The last seven years have been spent by
him in the patient endurance of poverty, and privations,
and solitude; and if Providence had not enabled him to
open his mind to a brother clergyman, I think he must
song since hav! sunk under his sufferings. As it is, his
distresses have brought upon him a painful and lingering

disorder, which wholly incapacitates him from any evi.
tion whatever; and after toiling to the last moment, and
sinking under it, he has now been obliged to abandon
even the little means of support which enabled him to drag
out his existence. During all this time :01 a murmur
has escaped him. He has permitted me ai jast, and with
the deepest reluctance, to make known his situation to
some relatives-surviving parents he has none. But the
replies which I have received have been such as to pre-
clude all hope of assistance. Some few alms I have
been enabled to procure for him ; but these have now
failed; and when I look around I can see no shelter open
for him,no place of retirement, where, if guilty, he
might pass his few remaining days in penitence; or, if
innocent, be shielded from the calumnies of the world,
and the miseries of destitution. For our clergy, as for
our peasantry, we have provided in this country no other
refuge, in want, in sorrow, in oppression, in solitude, and
sickness, and old age, but the poor-house and the gaol.
Happily I have prevailed on him at last to allow me to
mention his circumstances to yourself; and from all that
I have heard of your character-

tiine, now paused; and together the two friends, the
Founder of the college and the Warden, proceeded to
the ha)).
"I have just arranged," said Beattie, "that we
should all meet here before we go into the chapel, and
return here after the service is finished. With so many
young boys under our care, we cannot guard too care-
fully against their entering upon their devotions in a
hurried, unprepared frame of mind. I do not like their
coming into the chapel immediately from their play or
lessons, and still less making their attendance at chapel
a roll-call." And Villiers, whose admiration for Beattie
increased each day as he saw him bringing all his judg-
ment and devotion to bear upon the formation of this new
institution, was delighted to find that all the inmates were
already assembled in the hall, each in his place-grave
and composed, and silent; and after a short prayer
against wandering thoughts and irreverent behavior, they
all proceeded to the chapel.
Whatever holy, peaceful, grateful thoughtsthoughts
of deepest gratitude even in the midst of heavy afflictions
pervaded the minds of others, in the breast of one indi-
vidual, during nearly the whole of that solemn service,
there raged a hell. Placed with other poor at the upper
end of the sacred building (Beattie had selected the place
to mark in some outward form the fact that the poor are
in an especial manner the children of the Church,) he
looked down the lofty vaulted aisle, reverently but not
gorgeously lighted, and lined on each side with rows of
the members of the body, both young and old, attired
(for it was the evening of a festival) in white surplices.
He saw Beattie take the usual seat on the right hand of
ihe entrance, under a richly-wrought canopy of dark
carved oak, and Villiers next to him. And when he
observed the deep and solemn devotion of Villiers's man-
ner during the whole of the service, his heart misgave
him; and he doubted whether any machinations which
he could contrive against such a man could ever be per-
mitted to take effect. There was a full choral service,
in which all the congregation joined ; for church music

forined an essential part of the system which Beattie
had drawn up for the course of instruction : and as the
full swell of the organ blended with the clear pure chorus
of voices, young and old, rose in a cloud of music into
the vaulted roof, and floated along it, almost like the songs
of angels, even the guilty, remorseless, vindictive spirit
of the supposed mendicant lost something of its bitterness,
and became more calm. The beautiful service of the
Church was concluded, the organ once more pealed
forth its full tide of harmony, and the worshippers once
more proceeded to the hall; and there, after another
short prayer for forgiveness for all the coldness, and neg.
ligence, and omissions which might have sinned against
Heaven during the act of worship, Beattie dismissed
them.
One only he called to him from the farthest end of
the hall-one who seemed to withdraw himself from the
rest, as if in deep humility and shame. He had knelt,
too, in the chapel, not within the choir, but in the ante-
chapel. He had knelt on the bare marble pavement, had
worn no surplice, had scarcely raised his head, or his
voice, in any prayer but the Confession of Sin, had re-
frained from joining in the songs of thanksgiving; and,
when the service was concluded, had reverently opened
the door for the warden to retire through, and then had
shrunk back into a nook in one corner of the antechapel.
When he came up to Beattie, although Beattie addressed
him with the greatest gentleness, and Villiers inquired
kindly for his health, he kept his eyes fixed on the ground,
as if unable to raise them in the face of another fellow.
mortal. And there was an expression of sorrow and
shame, and at the same time of meekness and modesty,
in his countenance, which was full of touching interest.
Few would have recognised in the subdued and devoted
penitent the once profligate, seditious, and abandoned
Cookesley.
Beattie begged him to visit the mendicant who was
to be lodged within the walls that night, and to see if
there was anything the matter with himanything which
would require medical advice. And when Cookesley

had retired, Villiers could not help remarking on his
changed character and depressed aspect. " You cannot
persuade him yet," he said, " to take his position among
you. And yet his services, from his surgical knowledge,
are very valuable."
"I have scarcely endeavored to persuade him,"
replied Beattie. " The illness which he suffered subse.
quently to that disturbance at the Forest, and which he
caught during his confinement in prison, completely
sobered him. Bevan told me that he never saw such
an alteration, and that he was astonished to find how
many good points of character came out, which had been
overlaid and buried under the extravagances of a reckless
youth, plunged into the dissipations of London, without
home or guidance. O, when will our. Church think of
our medical students ? When will it remember that with
the healing of the body the healing of the soul is most
intimately joined ; and while it raises hospitals for the
bodies of the sick, when will it also raise by their side
colleges for those who attend to them ? Ever since he
has been here, he has exhibited such gentleness, such
humility, such earnestness, that I have scarcely liked to
disturb a discipline which is productive of such good fruits.
It is of his own choice that he does not enter the chapel
during Divine service. He knows that the profligacy of
his former life is a matter of public notoriety ; and he feels
more satisfaction himself in openly taking his true
position as a penitent, than in endeavoring to maintain
himself outwardly on a level with those who have been
guiltless of such sins as his.
" And perhaps," continued Villiers," it may be better
for the society itself that it should not be compromised by
too soon adnitting into its bosom even the reformed and
converted."
"It may be so," replied Beattie ; " by being brought
into such a refuge as this, he is saved from becoming the
hardened, reckless, impenitent profligate, or the fanatical,
ill-directed enthusiast, which he would have become in the
world after a mis-spent life like his. And he here meets
with so much tend rness, and kindness, and Christian

love from all, that there is comparatively little bitterness
in his position-far less, indeed, than in that compulsory
dissimulation, and almost hypocrisy, which is forced on
us by being placed in false situations at variance with
our real internal character. The early Church would
have excluded him from Communion for a far longer time
than I ventured to exclude him. And perhaps his best
preparation for Heaven is to remain in his present
humbled and anxious state. He has before him sufficient
hope to encourage him in his efforts at self-denial and
improvement, and a sufficient fear to make him watchful
and careful. And he seems to take such pleasure in ren-
dering services to any of the community, and in performing
for them even the most menial offices, that I value his
child-like humility inore than any ease and comfort which
he might find in being relieved too soon from the burden
on his conscience. He has been saved, dear Villiers, as
far as human eyes can see---saved from utter perdition,
and by the shelter of this place. And to have saved one
soul from impenitence and hardness of heart, and to have
brought it to Heaven, under the strict but blessed disci.
pline of such a coinmunity as this, is enough to repay you
for all that it has cost you."
Villiers made no reply, but his eyes were moistened ;
and shaking Beattie tenderly by the hand, he bade him
good night.
6* You have done it," he said ; "it is your
work, under Providence. It is an easy thing to give
money, easy to build walls of brick and stone-easy even
to plan and arrange upon paper an ideal
per:
fection ; but to carry it into operation, to govern and
mould the minds of others, to bear with all the infirmities
of temper, to endure all the hardships and privations,
which in any good form of society must fall most heavily
--not on those who are ruled, but on those who rule ; to
do all this patiently, and unweariedly, and without any
hope of reward upon earth, and to sacrifice for it, what
you have sacrificed, the quietness, and peace, and inde-

And with a full, tender, tranquil sense of gratitude, hope,
and comfort blending with deep sorrow, Villiers was re-
tiring, when Beattie affectionately stopped him.
" Pardon me," he said, " if I ask one question. Shall
you be present at the ceremony to-morrow ?"
Villiers almost started, but answered, at once, " No.
I would not willingly that private and personal feelings
should mix with such a solemn act of religion. Her
mind has been shaken enough already; and all that must
take place should be conducted as tranquilly and privately
as possible. The bishop will be at the chapel at ten
o'clock, and Lady Eleanor will be with Mrs. Beran.
You have saved her, dear Beattie. What a blessing to
have restored such a spirit from schism and error, to the
nmunion of truth! You may witness her restoration ;
I can do nothing but rejoice in it."
Beattie saw that it was a subject on which he dared
not say more ; and the friends parted.
CHAPTER XX.
IF many visions of Villiers's heart had been turned to
emptiness and gall--if his home had been left desolate-
if the delight of his eyes had been taken from himif on
that which had been the hope of his happiest hours he
now dared not even look-if at midnight, in his dreams,
in every waking moment, one black spot hung motionless
before his eyesthe thought of his lost child, and the
agony of contemplating its almost necessary destiny in
the hands of villains--if, when he turned over the pages
of those fearful Parliamentary Reports, which have laid
bare the miseries and sins of the poor and deserted, he
was obliged to close the book in anguish (for his own
child might now be enduring the same fate)and i, now
that year after year had passed away, recovery seemed
hopeless, and the punishment of Heaven to be sealed
upon his own disobe lance to his parent--yet Villiers's

existence was not without its blessings, real, deep,
substantial blessings,and his heart melted into thank-
fulness.
He reined up his horse, which seemed to know every
sound and movement of his master, and to sympathise
with his feelings ; and from the brow of the declivity
which sloped down to the little brook, he looked back
upon the Priory, now gleaming calmly and beauteously
in the placid moonlight.
The heavens were cloudless,
and scarcely a night breeze waved the branches of the
oaks, or stirred the feathers of the fern, which mantled
round his path. Every star appeared in its watch.
There was no sound but the lulling murmur of the brook,
and the faint swell of distant voices mingled with the
deep tones of an organ, rising from the dim-lighted win-
dows of the chapel ; for, on the evenings of festivals, the
inmates of the Priory were accustomed to meet in that
holy building, to fulfil the injunctions of the Apostle-
If any be merry, let him sing psalms ;" and there, ,
reverently and piously, and as a devotional exercise, they
indulged in the holy luxury of sacred music, without any
of that levity and incongruity, which besets its perform-
ance in a theatre or a concert-room.
Villiers listened to the solemn strains as they rose up
into the still night-air ; and he blessed God, who had not
deserted himwho had given him in the place of his
child such an object for his tender caresuch a home
for his affectionssuch a hope of good to all around him
-such a promise of fruit to his labors. He uttered a
prayer for all within its walls; and repeating to himself
the Psalm of David, " O how amiable are thy dwellings,
thou Lord of Hosts" (Ps. lxxxiv.), he once more turned
lis horse, and rode slowly along the brow of the park.
As he passed one of the park gates, near which, on
the outside, stood the blackened ruins of a miserable cot.
tage, which had been destroyed by lightning, Villiers
spurred his horse, as smitten with a sudden pang, and
galloped rapidly along the green sward, as if to distract
his thoughts from some painful subject. The blackened
ruin had reminded him of a tale of horror within it,

which had been brought before him in his very first in.
quiries into the state of his peasantrya tale of poverty,
of misery, of crime, of incest. And when Villiers came
to examine into the condition of his tenantry, and espe-
cially of his cottagerswhen he had visited them in their
own miserable abodes, and inquired into their habits, he
had been so shocked and appalled by the recurrence of
similar tales, that he scarcely ever dared to revert to the
subject, even in his thoughts. It was not that they were
worse than their neighbors ; this in itself aggravated
the evil. But Villiers had often dwelt, in foreign climes,
on the bold, cheerful, innocent, contented, simple-minded
peasantry of England, as they had been pictured to his
imagination. And when he came to look for them upon
his own estate, among those for whose happiness and
goodness he was responsible to Almighty God, he found
- what ?families huddled together in miserable hovels,
without one protection to common decency, and tempted,
even familiarized, with the most horrible crimes. Their
wages were scarcely sufficient to maintain life at its low-
est ebb, without one comfort--one superfluity--one pro.
vision for sickness and old age-one hope of elevation
from the depths of wani-one innocent domestic luxury
to bind together parents to their homes, and children to
their parents. Self-respect had vanished beneath the
crushing, chilling gripe of a relentless poverty,--a poverty
which those who should have relieved it stigmatised and
punished as a crime. Two hideous objects stared them
in the face, as a waiting them at the close of their life-the
poor-house and the grave ; and the grave stripped of all
the blessings which holiness and religion pour around it
to the peasant even more than to the king. They had
been deserted by their clergyman. The parish itself
was the same as that in which the town was situated;
and if the town had been neglected, how much more the
distant and outlying scattered villages !
From that moment Villiers, to whom before the very
name of a manufactory was odious, never indulged in one
reproach even upon that frightful system.
66 Till we,"
he said, "till he agriculturists and Jandlords of England

have wiped off the black blot upon our own fame-have
repented of our own sins, and redressed the wrongs which
we have committed by dealing with the possession of
land as with an instrument for making money, and by
becoming ourselves, not the rulers, the teachers, the
parents, the sovereigns of our tenantry, but their task-
masters, and master-manufacturersmanufacturers of
corn-manufacturers, with the same spirit of avarice, the
same selfishness, the same mercenary calculations, the
same gambling speculation, the same neglect of those
who toil to make us rich, as the manufacturers of silks
and cottonstill we have done this, we are in no condi
tion to censure others."
And his first thought had been to effect thisnot by
acts of parliament (Villiers smiled in melancholy scorn at
the name of acts of parliament), but by example, by self-
sacrifice. Once more he reined up his horse, and looked
down upon a hamlet, or more than hamlet, which had
sprung up in one corner of the park, near to the restored
Priory. He had chosen a spot where the lofty ridges of
the park retired, and left a wide, open vale, surrounded
with gentle undulations, green with grass, and tufted with
trees. The little Hawkstone brook, crossed by more
than one simple bridge, ran foaming through the middle
of the vale; and hanging by its side, and about the de-
clivities, there rose a number of white thatched cottages,
not ranged in rows (Villiers knew that geometrical lines
have little connection with the sympathies and prejudices
of home affections), but scattered here and there, as if by
accident, each having some little peculiarity, a tree, or
knoll, or jutting mass of rock, to mark it to the occupant
as his own home. "Man," repeated Villiers to Bevan,
never can be made what he should be till he possesses
property-something that may belong exclusively to him-
self, something which distinguishes him from others by
some mark more binding to his affections than the
chequer No. 1. or No. 2.
Each cottage also had its garden; and the gardener
at the great house was in daily communication with their
inmates, teaching them the proper cultivation of vegeta-

285
bles, and supplying them, as required, with the most
useful grafis of fruit-trees, and even with the finest flow-
ers which could be grown in the open
air.
Flowers," said Villiers to Bevan, " are the innocent
luxury of nature--the triumph of that exquisite art, which
the poor are as capable of enjoying as the rich. No cot-
tage of mine shall be without its flower-garden."
Villiers did not give them at once any extent of ground
beyond what might enable them to keep their pig, and, if
they manifested sufficient habits of improvement, their
cow, He did not think that to convert the laborer into
a small farmer-a farmer without either capital or skill
to extract from the earth its proper amount of fertility,
was consistent either with sound morals, or sound econo-
my, or sound politics. But he did take care that even
the laborer should have the means, not only of subsis.
tence, but of improvement. Mr. Atkinson, in calculating
their wages, had recommended a certain sum as the rate
most usual in the neighborhood. He feared that by ex.
ceeding it on one estate discontent would be produced on
others. But Villiers authoritatively, and almost sternly,
rebuked him. " Calculate," he said, "not what others
give, or what the laborer, driven to desperation, will con-
sent to receive rather than perish by starvation, but what
he ought to havewhat a Christian should give to his
brother. Ensure to him a subsistence, simple and frugal,
but plentiful and wholesome. It is with his body that he
'abors, and his body we must nurture. Provide for him
some innocent indulgences. Let him have his little
east-days, even his occasional luxuries. What is the
weary monotony of life without some recreation ? And
he who toils with his body must be recreated in his body.
Calculate for accidents, for sickness, for old age.
Teach
him prudence, by giving him wherewithal to be prudent
-something to lay by against the winter's day. Provide
also for the rearing of a family. They whose minds are
enlarged, and their enjoyments varied, may endure life
in comparative solitude, and make a home for themselves
in their studies or imaginations : but for the poor and
uneducated a home is necessary.

ness, by coupling it with the embitterments of poverty
and the dread of destitution. The peasant must educate
his children. He should have the means of sending them
out into the worldnot in a vain effort to rise into a
higher sphere than that in which nature has placed them,
but to gain their bread by honest labor. Lastly, he must
have the means of being merciful and charitable himself,
and of casting even his mite into the treasury of the
House of God. These are the calculations to be made
when we are estimating the rate of wages to the laborer;
and with nothing short of this ought a Christian landlord
to be content."
Mr. Atkinson heard him, and looked up with amaze-
ment, and even doubted whether these new Oxford notions
had not turned Villiers's head; and one day he even went
so far as to consult with Mrs. Atkinson on the propriety
of remonstrating against such extravagance, which must
utterly ruin the estate. But, after the trial of three years,
he found that, instead of being ruined, the estate was
increased in value ; and at last, even the Conservative
principles of the cool, calculating, wary, and practical
agent, gave way to the energy and loftiness of Villiers's
theory.
Nor had Villiers forgotten their recreation. In the
centre of the hamlet he had marked out the village green,
with its tall elm trees grouped about it, its cricket-ground,
its maypole-everything that could recall a second Au-
burn. He had encouraged the villagers to form a little
band of music which played in the summer evenings on
the green, while the old women sat with their spinning.

practised all kinds of athletic games.

coltage, embowered in honeysuckles and roses, which
nestled close to the lowly but reverend village church.
And with Bevan there often came a lady,--simple,
gentle, sensible and refined, and clinging to his arm with
affectionate reverence. And the same delicate and
amiable Mary Vincent, who could not go to a ball to
dance over the sufferings of her fellow-creatures, now,
as Bevan's wife, became his chief aider and almoner in
ministering to the wants of his poor. And this hamlet
was in an especial manner their favorite resort, for here
Villiers was first trying the experiment of transplanting
the better part of that population of the town, which,
having been created by the sudden rise of its manufac-
tures, had been thrown out of employment by their as
sudden fall. When Mr. Smith's foreign speculations had
failed, and his foreign correspondents, having once ex-
perienced that the commodities which he had furnished
them were made up out of rotten materials, had aban.
doned all connection with him, Villiers found that the
bankruptcy of the manufacturers had thrown upon the
poor-rates of the parish a vast body of indigent workmen
reduced to starvation ; and this was the great problem
which occupied his thoughts, and perplexed him with
almost insurmountable difficulties. On a small scale he
was called on to solve the same problem which England
is called on to solve upon a vast one, and which, howevei
it may be staved off for a time by some temporary revi-
val of trade, or by the sacrifice of the agricultural interest,
must ultimately stare us in the face, and be solved
at the peril of our life, as soon as other countries have
learned, as they rapidly are learning, that they need not
depend for manufactures on any but their own resources.
One mode, indeed, was offered to Villiers, not of
removing the evil, but of postponing it, with the certainty
of bringing it ultimately upon him, aggravated beyond all
hope of remedy. The Messrs. Silkem came to him, and
informed him that, being nearly, if not wholly, ruined, by
their past manufacturing speculations, they must stop
payment, and throw out of employment all their work.

taking Mr. Smith's vacant factory, and, by demanding no
rent for it, could enable them to carry on their specula-
tions on a more extended scale. And they supported
their petition by the irrefragable argument that manufac
turers were the very heart's-blood of the British empire
and that Villiers, as an agriculturist, must therefore be
content to be sacrificed in their support. Nor could they
at all understand the reasoning by which Villiers calmly
replied to them--that he had claims upon him for his money
as well as they had for theirs ; that especially the Church
depended upon him for its support, which there was no
probability of its receiving from the manufacturers ; that
the surrender of his claim to rent would only enable and
tempt them to reduce the wages of the workmen, who
would in no degree be relieved by it; and that if ruin
hitherto had been the consequence of past speculation,
future and more extended speculation could only end in
an aggravation of the same evil. Villiers stated this, and
much more ; but Messrs. Silkem had been to London,
and had attended a meeting of the Anti-Corn-Law-League,
at Covent Garden Theatre, and they were wholly unable
to comprehend his arguments. Villiers, however, was
immoveable ; and he astonished them even more by in-
forming them that it was not his intention to allow Mr.
Smith's factory to be again occupied in that manner,
under any circumstances, or at any rent.
He did not
think that any amount of wealth which it might enable
Mr. Smith to accumulate for himself, was at all a com-
pensation for the evils inflicted on a place by bringing
together a manufacturing population, exposed to all the
temptations of such a life, and fluctuating daily between
the extremes of destitution and of self-indulgence,
The Messrs. Silkem and all the other political econ-
omists of the town opened their eyes widely at this an.
nouncement, uttered sundry profound, and not complimen-
tary exclamations on the subject of Oxford opinions, and
prophesied that Hawkstone would be ruined, and that
Mr. Villiers must go to gaol. But Hawkstone had been

was more alive to the duty and expediency of maintain.
ing in those who are called to govern an exterior aspect
of dignity, he thought that, in a crisis like the present,
even this was to be sacrificed to the more pressing ne.
cessity of providing for the poor. "The Church," he
would say to Bevan, " rather than that the poor should
starve, would sell even the vessels of the altar."
But in the meanwhile there lay before him the large,
unmanageable, destitute population of the town; and
how were they to be provided for? Happily he was en-
abled to employ the assistance of Bevan, as the rector of
the parish, and Bevan was not single-handed. His
first thought and plan had been to gather round him a
small body of clergy as his curates, who might live un-
der the same roof, at the same table, and might govern
the parish, large as it was, effectually by their united
labor. And he found no difficulty in accomplishing his
purpose. Oxfordthe maligned, suspected Oxford-sup-
plied him with a number of young men, some already in
holy orders, some preparing to enter them, who were re-
joiced after taking their degree to place themselves un-
der his guidance, and, directed by him in their course of
reading, to pursue their studies together, while they took
a part in attending the schools, visiting the poor and sick,
and celebrating divine service.
At eight o'clock every morning, Bevan himself, with
his seven curates, went in a little procession to the parish
church ; at four o'clock in the afternoon the same spec-
tacle was seen: and though the cold sneered, and the
profligate mocked, and the ignorant and self-willed de.
clared that to worship the Almighty twice a day, as the
Church of their fathers prescribed and commanded, was
mere popery, the better spiritsthe poor, whose only

comfort could be found in religion, and wven the earnest,
sincere Dissenters, confessed that the act was good ; and
many of them came also. Bevan was an admirable
musician ; and in the evenings of week-days, with the
assistance of an able teacher, he gathered round him a
little choir, and soon, very soon, he was enabled to in.
troduce into the solemnities of divine worship as much
music as gave to it its due outward charms, without sa-
crificing the realities of internal devotion to the pleasure
of the ear.
And strange as it may seem to hear of a
body of seven curates employed in a living of scarcely
more than seven hundred a-year, yet the blessing of hea.
ven seemed to descend upon Bevan's means, as on the
widow's cruse.
He also, like Villiers, reduced his establishment and
personal expenditure to bare necessaries. Instead of
furnishing the rectory-house as modern refinement would
require, he gave up all but two or three rooms to his
curates. Villiers enabled him to build on to it, not a
large drawing-room and a best bed-room, but two simple,
ancient-looking apartments, with open arched roof and
latticed windows, one for a little dining-hall, the other
for a library; and until means could be procured for fur-
nishing this with books, Villiers removed into it the the.
ological portion of his own collection. There was a
charm in the community of labor and study, in the as-
sociation of charity, in the regular services of the Church,
in the order and decency of the system of life, in the re-
ligious and tranquil tone that pervaded the whole little
community, which made a curacy of Hawkstone an ob.
ject of desire and ambition to many a young man.
And
Bevan soon found that, instead of being required to pay
eighty pounds a-year to each of his curates, he could
command as many as he wanted, who were satisfied to
devote their labors to him as an exercise for their pro-
fession with scarcely any remuneration whatever, and
whose private means even enabled them to contribute
considerably to the funds of the little association. One
of them died under Bevan's roof-a young man of rank
and priv ate fortune, whom Bevan had rescued from much

evil at Oxford, and had watched over with the greatest
care. And, to the surprise of all, it was found that he
had left a considerable sum for the permanent foundation
and endowment of a body of seven clergymen in Hawk-
stone, to be placed under the control of the rector, and
employed by him in his parochial ministrations.
Even from the first Bevan never had despaired.
Beattie, and Villiers, and himself were in daily commu.
nication; and they comforted, strengthened, and supported
each other.
"Let us plan and commence," said Villiers, " what
is needed for the Church, what is right, what is good.
Even though it seem gigantic in idea and desperate in
execution, Heaven will provide the means. Heaven
never failed a mighty work conceived in faith and nur-
tured with prayer."
And it was with this little body of clergy that Bevan
and Villiers proposed to grapple with the mass of indi.
gence and misery now left in the streets of Hawkstone,
as shapeless rocks and fragments of ruin are left in the
bed of a torrent, when the waters are exhausted, or the
current turned.
The first refuge which presented itself for the most
destitute was the Union poor-house. But this Villiers
steadily repudiated.
66 While I have bread to spare,
he said, "no poor member of Christ's body, no starving
child of the Church in this place, shall ever enter the
poor-house. If their poverty be a crime, the result of
their own fault, and the poor-house is to be the gaol and
place of correction in which they are to be brought to
repentance, a system and place of correction, of which
the Church is not the soul, is not fit to receive them.
And if their poverty be a visitation from heaven upon
innocent beings, far less shall they be doomed for it to
the ignominy, the privation, the confinement, and the
hopelessness of a gaol. No, Bevan," he exclaimed, in-
dignantly, " let others provide as they may for the poor
of their own persuasion ; our children, the children of the
Church, must be fed and comforted in their afflictions, at
whatever cost, by the Church herself."

He selected the families in which he could discern
sufficient seeds of good, and transplanted them into the
hamlet, which has been mentioned already; and three
other little settlements he proposed to form in other por-
tions of the park. And when Mr. Atkinson remonstrated
faintly against breaking up the pasture, and killing down
the deer, Villiers took him to the highest ridge of the
park, and bade him look down upon the famishing families
of Hawkstone, which Mr. Atkinson knew were crowded
into its ruin-smitten streets, and then he pointed to a
herd of deer, which bounded gracefully along the green
grassy glades, and Villiers asked which in the sight of
heaven was most precious, and for which a Christian
ought soonest to provide food ? Some families also there
were, who, having saved a little capital, were anxious to
seek for employment in the colonies, and Villiers willingly
aided them to depart. But he did not send them forth
with only money in their pocket; he opened a communi-
cation with more than one of those devoted men who
have recently gone forth as bishops of the Church into
our distant settlements. He provided for their reception,
at their landing, into the bosom of the Church. Bevan
procured for them from the bishop of his diocese recom-
mendatory letters, attesting their Church-membership,
and entreating the assistance of the faithful for them
wherever they might be. He communicated also with
the captains of the ships in which they embarked, ap-
pointed an agent to receive them on their arrival at the
nearest sea-port, took care that they should not be ex-
posed during the voyage to the contamination and miseries
of which he had seen too many specimens in the ordinary
course of emigration. And it was with many a deep
and fervent thanksgiving that he received from them
repeated accounts of their arrival and prosperity, and of
the blessings and mutual comforts which they had derived
from clinging all together in a strange soil, and planting
themselves in its unoccupied wastes as a body, not as
scattered individuals. Since for this also Villiers had
provided; and when he planned the sending forth of a
little band of emigrants, as far as possible he selected

293
those who were united together by bonds of blood or
friendship. He brought them together, and accustomed
them to look upon themselves as associated in a little
polity. Before they left the country he endeavored to
provide among them for the various wants and arts most
important in an infant settlement. One was a mason,
another a carpenter, another a blacksmith, another a
tailor. And when he was enabled to purchase a large
tract of land in one of the settlements, he immediately
remitted funds to its bishop, that he might build upon it a
church, and plant at least three clergymen together on
the spot, for whose subsequent support he provided by
enforcing in the terms of tenure the full payment of tithes,
and for the necessary multiplication of churches and
ministers, and all the Levitical functions of the Church,
by setting apart in the most favorable positions valuable
endowments of land for colleges. Ile was surprised to
find how little this cost. The purchase of one picture,
the expense of one entertainment in London, the losses
of one night's gambling, even the waste of a stable and
of fox-hounds, would have swallowed up sums which now
enabled him to diffuse blessings all around him.
And by degrees the mass of poverty and misery
melted
away: One rulea strict, severe, almost stern
rule-he laid down to Bevan in all his ministrations of
mercy. Seek out the children of the Church, those who
have not fallen into schism, who are not guilty of heresy.
Even those who have must not be allowed to perish.
But let us take care, while we succor their bodies, to
think also of their souls. Let us not allow them to mis.
take an act of necessary charity as toleration or indiffer.
ence to their sin. Mark in the clearest way you can the
difference between a Churchman and a Dissenter; it
may awaken them to a knowledge of their guilt. And
Bevan found indeed that there was no disposition in
Dissenters themselves to neglect their own poor; and
that he was only adopting an exclusive principle which
had long been enforced by themselves.
But there was still a large portion of the population
which could not be transferred into the hamlets ; and

Villiers knew that manufactures, in some proportion,
were as necessary to the well-being and even existence
of society as agriculture. What he had denounced and
abhorred, both in its spirit and in its consequences, was
the profligate extension of manufactures for the purpose
of accumulating wealth in the hands of a few individuals,
in a boundess fluctuating market, subject to reckless
competition, tempting to every species of fraud, almost
compelling the reduction of the laborers' wages to the
minimum of subsistence, liable to panics, to gluts, to stag.
nation, to all the vicissitudes of gambling speculation, and
thus hardening the hearts of one class by the idolatry of
wealth, and eating like a cancer into the souls and the
bodies of the other. Manufactures, with a fixed market,
Villiers resolved to encourage. He therefore bound down
all over whom he had any influence, to obtain the com-
modities which they required from their own immediate
neighborhood. It was easy to exercise such a superin.
tendence over the sellers that they should not convert this
seerring monopoly into an occasion of fraud and extortion.
And though the buyers might at times have been able to
obtain a better article at a cheaper price from a distant
spot, Villiers cast to the winds the miserable maxim of
economists, that "the first law of prudence is to buy
cheap, and to sell dear."
" The first law of God," he said to Bevan, " is to
love Him, and to do His will. And among the records
of his will I find nu such law, nothing approaching to it,
nothing which does not seem to hold it
up to reprobation
and scorn.
And the second law is to love our neighbors
as ourselves, and to do to every man as we would that he
should do unto us. Let us rather wear this coarse cloth,
rather eat ill-made bread, rather live in an ill-constructed
house for a time, bearing patiently these trifling vexations,
than allow our brother to starve at our doors because he
has not yet acquired perfection in his art ; and this per-
fection let us strive to teach him ; and instead of calcu.
lating how little we can give for the produce of others'
labors, to enable those around us to enjoy their comforts
and to improve their condition, let us rather think how

295
much, we can give without jujury to those other interests,
which Heaven has commanded us to consult. Defraud
not the hireling of his wages; wring not from the poor
all that can be extorted in the shape of cheap prices. You
are purchasing your own indulgences with the blood of
the poor ; for from their wages the reduction must be
ultimately extracted."
And when it was necessary to procure articles, such
as foreign commodities, from a distance, Villiers did not
send, or teach others to send, to the metropolis, and there
purchase them by wholesale, at a cheaper rate. He
gave to the shopkeeper in Hawkstonethe grocer, or
the wine-merchant, or the bookseller-an introduction to
the first wholesale houses in London, where they might
be sure of obtaining what was really good ; and through
the shopkeepers in his own native place he made all his
purchases, insisting on their receiving such an amount
of profit on their outlay as justice demanded, and insisting
also that the same quality of article which he required
himself should be supplied to the poor at the same
price.
But what Villiers was most anxious to encourage was
a system of domestic manufactures, the spinning, knit-
ting,--every thing which could be carried on round the
family fireside. He loved to see the old women sunning
themselves with their wheels before the doors, and the
younger females within employed in works of the kind
under the eye of their parents. And, in cases where
this could not be accomplished, he proceeded to establish
a manufactory of his own in Mr. Smith's deserted build
ingbut a manufactory on very opposite principles to
those which have made nearly one-sixth of England a
sink of misery and vice. Villiers's object was not to
accumulate money for himself, but to provide necessary
comforts for others, and in doing this to discover, not how
little might be given to the laborer, but how much con.
sistently with the object in view. Having calculated the
extent of his market in his own immediate neighborhood,
he limited also the amonint of his production. He esti-
mated the price set upon it, not by the extreme point to

which competition-often dishonest and desperate com-
petition-might be able to drive it down, but by the cost
of the raw material, and machinery, and capital, and by
that amount of wages, which, as a Christian, he felt due
to the laborer. And so far as he could restrict his
consumers to his own market, he could command from
them this price, which, though higher than that of
neighboring districts, was fully compensated by its
enabling the workmen to give a higher price reciprocally
for the produce of the soil. The terms were higher, but
the proportion was scarcely altered, and the money all
circulated in the neighborhood. And in the wages due
to the workmen Villiers calculated much which an eco-
nomist would have rejected with disdain. He dealt with
him as with the agricultural laborer. He provided for
him instruction, hours and means of relaxation, oppor.
tunities of worship, holidays-the holidays of the Church,
enjoyments of various kinds. Mr. Smith's factory, in-
stead of glaring with lights at midnight, and sounding
with wheels both day and night, now enjoyed its hours
of nightly repose, its intervals of daily rest, its Sabbaths,
and its sports. All was carried on under the direction
of Bevan and his curates. The strictest discipline was
maintained in preventing the evils of indiscriminate asso-
ciation ; the greatest care was taken in encouraging
industry, the firmest severity exercised in chastising vice.
Villiers did not indeed make a fortune by it, but he made
others good and happy; and he knew no other use of
money. The economists looked on and smiled in scorn,
and proved by the irrefragable arguments of figures that
a system of restrictions and of confined markets must be
ruinous ; and that in the nineteenth century it was mad-
ness even to argue against free trade, and its necessary
consequence, competition ; but Villiers was not ruined,
and at the end of each year he found his income increas-
ing. Heaven had given the promise, and nature, he
knew not how, realised it.
Such had been some of the economical theories and
acts of Villiers in relation to the unhappy town of Hawk.

soon had the satisfaction of finding a very considerable
impression made upon its population. From a turbulent,
factious, schismatic, irreligious, profligate place, it became
quiet, orderly, decent, and religious. Two new churches.
sprang up, and the old venerable church, reseated and
repaired, was converted, by the zeal of the inhabitants,
almost into a little cathedral. The alms increased, the
irregular associations of voluntary and rash zeal were
laid aside for more ecclesiastical operations expressly
sanctioned by the bishop. One after another the schis.
matic chapels became empty; and notwithstanding the
outcry first raised under the watchword of Popery, at last
Bevan, prudent and cautious in his zeal, and never
seeking to restore a form till he had created the spirit,
with the support of his bishop triumphed over all oppo-
sition. Even Mr. O'Foggarty, baffled and disappointed,
was compelled to make arrangements for abandoning his
mission as a hopeless work. When the true image of
the Church in all its beauty was exhibited to poor as well
as rich, and its true principles were distinctly enunciated
and enforced, not by an individual, but by a body, few
could close their eyes, or withhold their obedience, but
the incorrigible and self-willed ; the rest returned to the
fold from which they had strayed, and Hawkstone was
comparatively at unity with itself.
Again and again, penetrated with all which Villiers
had done for them, the inhabitants entreated him to add
one more obligation, and to become their member. And
they did indeed expel Mr. Marmaduke Brook both from
his seat in Parliament, and from his 15001. a-year com-
missionership. But Villiers would not enter the House
of Commons. He felt that his first duties lay immediately
around him; and until he could accomplish his work
near to his own home, he refused to be distracted from it
for nearly half the year by the necessity of living in Lon-
don. And he had other reasons besides.
He could not join in any act which might restore to
power the avowed enemies of order, loyalty, and religion
--the men whose principles, if not their practice, involv-
ed the overthrow of the monarchy and the corruption and

Whiggism ; but neither could he lift his hand to maintain
in power a party whose conduct, no less surely, threaten.
sed the insensible subversion of all that was holy and
venerable.
At the very name of one man, who then occupied the
helm of the empire, he sickened and turned away with
disgust. He who recognised as the first law of his be-
ing, as the first treasure of human knowledge, as a pal-
ladium of states, and the salt of the earth, divine truth,
the truth of the divine nature as revealed by the Divine
Being himself-he who, instead of asking, with Pilate,
" What is truth ?" had examined and found it enshrined
in a Catholic Churchhe who, having once recognised
in that Church the creature and minister of God, would
allow neither heresy nor schism to tamper with or per-
secute ithe who knew that in divine truth, and divine
commands, and divine promises, there is a power eternal
and omnipotent, and that if man will only boldiy witness
to them, and reverently obey them, even the madness of the
people must be powerless against them-he whose whole
conduct was based and shaped upon the highest of all
principles, and who never acted without a principle wiser
than all expediency, and safer than any cowardice-such
a man might well shrink, with as much repugnance and
loathing as a Christian sinner may feel towards a brother
sinner, from that miserable, compromising, vacillating,
unprincipled policy, which now, under the name of Con.
servatism, had been elevated to the rule of the British
empire. Villiers did not often trust himself to converse
on it, for he bore before him the injunction "not to speak
evil of dignities;" and he was humble and gentle in him-
self, and knew that he had sins of his own to answer for.
But about this time he wrote a letter in answer to an
application for his rote and interest in favor of a gov.
ernment candidate ; and as it has fallen into our hands
we may as well communicate it to our readers :

inposes on me, or to decline to give a vote in the ensu-
ing election. But, in the present aspect of affairs, I can
scarcely exercise this privilege without lending my sup-
port to men, and principles, and measures, which whether
on one side or the other, must be equally offensive to the
great Ruler of all things, and equally injurious to the
country. If you would offer yourself to the electors o
the county as resolved to resist the further aggressions
of democracy upon the church and the throne, and to aid
in maintaining the true principles both of religion and of
loyalty, though you would be compelled to stand almost
solitary in the House of Commons, and could do little
more than witness to truth, like the prophets of old, in
the midst of contempt and unbelief, still you would ulti-
mately effect, under a blessing from Heaven, no little
good; and, whatever still remains in the heart of Eng.
land of reverence, and faith, and courage, would gladly
catch at such a voice, and cease at least to despair of their
parliament and their country. To such professions as
this I would willingly give my support ; but to any one
who identifies his political opinions with the support of
the present Conservative government I must decline
offering any assistance.
" After painful, but careful consideration, I am com
pelled to believe that a statesman cannot be named who
has inflicted on the constitution and welfare of the British
empire more fatal and deadly injuries than the individual
who is now its prime minister.

philosophy, without ultimate destruction to both ; and no
worldly tale.., no industry, no financial ingenuity, no
dexterity in managing a party, can atone for that avowed
and resolute abandonment of all high principle, which
the present government has laid down as the condition
and essence of its policy. To have asserted and intro-
duced this principle as an axiom of government is in

itself a blow to all sound views of political society, from
which it can scarcely recover. Individuals may have
sinned in it before ; but till the entrance of the present
administration into office it has been carefully excluded
from sight, and never boldly avowed, except in the worst
periods of the democracies of Greece.
" In attributing to the individual with whom you have
identified your opinions the serious degree of mischief
which has been expressed above, I wish to speak coolly
and deliberately, and without the slightest tendency to
exaggeration. And the statement is grounded upon this
fact, that great truths can never be destroyed by ene.
mies ; they can only be betrayed by professed friends.
An armed force cannot annihilate my right to a property ;
but one weak concession of my own will extinguish it for
Thus the true and elevated principles which raised
and preserved the British empire, however cast out and
trampled on for a time under the predominance of the
Whig party, remained in themselves untouched and
secured by a protest, as a standard of truth, to which the
better part of the nation might still appeal, and round
which they might hope to rally, and ultimately restore
truth to power. But when those who professed to main-
tian these truths, corrupted, and adulterated, and denied
them, and no further protest was raised in their behalf,
they perished from the face of our laws, and from the eyes
of the people, and are now lost, it may be for ever.
Upon these grounds I charge the Conservatives of
England under their present leader, and not either the
Whigs or the Radicals, with being the destroyers of the
British Empire.
"In their Emancipation Act they established the
principle, that, even where the Church and the truth of
Christ are concerned, governments may yield to fear even
what they confess to be full of sin. They asserted the

power should be given into the hands of opponents. If

servatives courteously, but with no far prospective wis-
dom, retired from the representation of his University.
If it be the very keystone of society, and the pervading
law of all progress in the British constitution, that no
changes shall be made, but only developments, he, the

the Reform Act, has declared that act to be a revolution

Ht surrendered to the House of Commons the right of
the crown to appoint its ministers, when he declared that
since the Reform Act no minister should hold office
without the approbation of the Commons.
He surren-
dered the appointment of ambassadors, when he per-
mitted one whom the crown had chosen to retire from his
post, at the command of the Commons. He has estab-
lished the very height and essence of all democratical
tyranny, by defending the omnipotence of the Commons
against the laws and judges of the realm. He establish-
ed the Ecclesiastical Commission, which has broken up
the outward system of the Church, violated its oaths,
tampered with its independence, destroyed the rights of
private property, dried up the sources of individual en.
dowments, mutilated those cathedral corporations which
should have been restored and revivified to become the
chief arms of its strength, and annihilated Episcopates
And when the Church, awakened from its
trance, has called out for redress and mercy, he has re
fused to listen to her voice. He has rested the defence
of the Church not upon its divine institution and authority
but
upon vile and worthless titles, which may be smal
tered and cast to the winds by the first impugner-upoi
compact, upon expediency, upon his own valueless opinior
of its morality and goodness. And in this he has acteu
as an advocate who, when charged with maintaining a
title to property, should suppress and stifle the true deeds,
and should put forward only forgeries-weak pleas,
for money.

which a breath would blow to atoms. And no defence
can clear him from treachery but the apology of igno-
rance. He has maintained, and resolved to propagate,
a scheme of education, which is emptied of all religious
truths ; in which the teacher, and the State in his per-
son, stands before the pupil as either too ignorant to de.
cide on divine truth amidst contending falsehoods, or too
indifferent to assert it. And he proposes now, it is said,
to sanction the extension of such a system to the upper
as to the lower classes; and at the same time to intro-
duce it into one of the strongholds of the Church, even
into an ancient university of Great Britain, as he has al-
ready insisted on its being recognised in colleges in our
colonies. And he has destroyed the great maxim of the
English law, that endowments shall not be guarded, or
even permitted, by the State, unless they are devoted to
definite ends of goodness and wisdom ; for he has come
forward voluntarily to perpetuate possessions left by men
without any fixed creed, in the hands of others, whose
creed is heresy and blasphemy. These are but some
of the principles which a policy openly repudiating the
assertion of any principle but expediency, shrinking
from truth and from law as from an abominable thing,

CHAPTER XXI.
We left Villiers slowly riding home by moonlight, along
the brow of the park. His heart was full-many other
thoughts were crowding on him besides the recollections
which we have just recalled. And abandoning himself
to them, he allowed his horse to pursue the path most
familiar to him, till the steed brought its master, not to
the gateway of the house, but to the old oak bench, which
commanded a view of Hawkstone, and to the silvery
beech, whose trunk, inscribed with initials not yet ob-
literated, had arrested Villiers's step the first day of his
return to the seat of his ancestors. Under that beech
the horse stoppedit had been long his master's custom
so to do: and through the thick tangled underwood,
which clothed the brow of the steep declivity, an opening
had been cleared away, through which the eye could
rest, not on the windings of the river, or on the grey
tower of Hawkstone Church, but on the distant white
colonnade of Lord Claremont's house, embosomed in its
grove of stately oaks. And Villiers gazed on it mourn.
fully, and yet affectionately and reverently.
" To-morrow?" he thought within himself, " to.

morrow?" And the reins dropped from his hand; and
while the tears gushed from his eyes, he clasped his
hands in prayer.
And at the same hour what was passing with the
usual inmates of that pile on which Villiers was gazing ?
One, who had once been its inmate, the band of death
had already smitten. Lord Claremont lay mouidering
in the vault of his ancestors, within the chapel of the
restored Priory. But Lady Eleanor was still living ;
and at that moment where was she? She was not in
her own mansion, but in a small, simple, bnt solemn-
looking chamber, the latticed oriel of which looked out
upon
the
grey
tower of Hawkstone Church, and the green
meadow, and tall clustered elms, and gently-flowing river,
which nearly encircled the old, once-ruined hospice of the
Bguinage of Hawkstone. Ruined it was no longer.
Its simple gables, its humble wooden cloister, roughly
but quaintly carved, its clustered chimneys, its buttressed
gateway, which shut it out from the too near vicinity of
the town, its dim-lighted refectory marked by the large
square-headed windows, and not left without their little
emblazonments of heraldry and scrolls of textseven
the little chapel, no longer a stabling for cows, had all
been restored-all touched and finished with that ex-
quisite delicacy of feeling, that taste for severe truth
which pervaded every work of Villiers, and which no
mere technical skill, nothing but a deep philosophy and
a Christian spirit, can ever attain in art.
And in that chamber, before an open Bible, her long
beautiful hair let down over her face, her eyes upturned
to Heaven, her hands clasped in intense anguish, her
cheeks wet with tears, Lady Eleanor was kneeling in
prayer. She was praying for light, for strength, for
guidance, for support, now when the hour of trial was
approaching. "To-morrow," she murmured, like Vil-
liers, "to-morrow!" and then, shuddering and shrinking,
she bowed down her head upon the holy volume, and
nearly dropped to the ground. "To.morrow!"that
day of awe!
So absorbed was she in the contemplation that she

did not hear a gentle voice at the door, or, when no
answer was given, the gentle foot which entered the
It was a lady, attired, like Lady Eleanor, in
black, but seemingly not as the garb of mourning. Her
dress was simple, and not uncommon; and yet there was
something in it-perhaps it was the plain cap, perhaps
the broad collar of purest white-which distinguished its
wearer from the ordinary world. Age had stamped her
features with an impress of gravity and dignity, chastened
by a mild resignation. Though her hair, plainly banded
across her forehead, was nearly grey, her manner and
movements still retained activity and strength. She
paused, as on entering the room she saw Lady Eleanor,
and gazed on her with a deep look of sympathy and
affection. But Lady Eleanor heard her move, and looked
round. She did not rise from her knees, but stretched
out her hands to her in silence, and besought her with
piteous looks to take her seat where Lady Eleanor herself
was kneeling. And Mrs. Bevan did so. And bending
down over the drooping figure she clasped Lady Eleanor
in her arms, laid her head upon her own bosom, and,
without speaking, allowed her own tears to fall thick
upon her face.
My friend! my mother! my more than mother!"
faltered Lady Eleanor, "pray for me, for I am in a great
strait. I thought the bitterness of the struggle was past,
but it has come upon me again--an hour of darkness-
now in the last moment. Pray for me!"
Mrs. Bevan made no reply except by stooping down
and pressing her affectionately to her bosom. At last
she said, " I cannot wonder at it. Hardly would the
tempter leave you without one more conflict. But will
you not see some one-some one who could comfort and
enlighten you more than I could ? My son is here. Or
shall I send for Mr. Beattie?"
No," replied Lady Eleanor, "it is too latenot at
this hour of night-not for me. And yet-O my mother!
is it not a fearful, an awful thing to turn aside from the
fai h of our fathers?"
Mrs. Bevan gent y disengaged herself from the almost

convulsive embrace of the suffering convert. And in a
few minutes Bevan, who was in an adjoining room, des.
patched a note to Beattie, at his mother's request, begging
that even at so late an hour, he would come into Hawk
stone. It was Beattie, who under Providence had been
the means, not of exciting, but of deciding those doubts
respecting the truth of the Romish Church, which had
been raised in Lady Eleanor's mind chiefly by the mis-
taken conduct of O'Foggarty. To Beattie, ever since
those doubts had arisen, and chiefly since Lord Clare-
mont's death, she had been induced to apply more and
more frequently, and to look up to him almost as a parent;
and under his judicious and wise instruction she had at
length conscientiously resolved on taking that solemn
step which was contemplated the day following, and
requesting the Bishop of the diocese to admit her into
the communion of the Catholic Church in England.
And Beattie lost no time in following the messenger
into Hawkstone. He had witnessed in the delicate,
elevated, pure mind of Lady Eleanor so much of intense
suffering during the conflict through which she had
passed, that he was prepared to find it recur with even
increased violence now when the trying hour was ap-
proaching. And though he trusted much to the judicious
and affectionate support of Mrs. Bevan, with whom Lady
Eleanor had been domesticated for the last month, he
knew that her acute understanding might suggest doubts
and temptations which could only be counteracted by
one more experienced in the controversy. Beattie had
studied it deeply; and having studied it deeply, he did
not despise itdid not think light of its difficultiesdid
not presume, as so many now presume, to despatch it
with a light word and a bold laugh.
On his arrival at the Bguinage, he found Lady
Eleanor more calm. The paroxysm was past; but the
deep and fervent gratitude with which she clasped her
hands, when he entered the room, satisfied him that his
presence was needed. He took her hands in his own,
uttered a blessing upon her, beneath which she bowed
down her head reverently and humbly, and then he led

307
her to a seat by him. She would have falien on her knees
before him, so intense was her feeling, so deep her
reverence for him; but he entreated her to be composed.
"Dear Lady Eleanor," he said, " these feelings are
natural, and almost necessary-in some sense they may
be even right. And yet in all that you have thought and
done, and resolved to do, you have proposed to yourself
but one object--truth, the truth of Heaven ; and ought
we to admit of any other? But excited feeling of any kind
is scarcely a fit preparation for clearly discerning truth,
least of all in a moment of temptation ; and it may be,
that this agony into which you have fallen, this renewed
darkness and perplexity, is the workthe last work-of
the tempter."
Lady Eleanor only replied by a deep groan.
" You have prayed," said Beattie, "prayed to
Heaven for light and aid. Let us pray together. And
kneeling down by her side, he led up her thoughts to the
great source of all truth, and entreated comfort for her
affliction, enlightenment for her doubts, support in her
weakness, and wisdom for his own ministrations. "And
now," he said, when they rose from their knees, " tell me
in what thoughts and suggestions has originated this re-
turn of doubts which I had thought were long since
dispelled."
"I know not," replied Lady Eleanor, faintly.
cloud of darkness, of bewilderment, came over me, as if
there were nothing in the world true or certain--as if all
religion was a delusion, when the best and wisest of men
so differ in their views. And then came the inemory of
my father, and of her who was to me in my childhood
even more than a motherthat saint in heaven, Lady
Esther. And I thought within myself, how could I meet
them beyond the grave--a traitor, a renegade to the faith
of my fathers. Oh, Mr. Beattie, if you are deceiving me
-or, rather (I meant not that), if you are deceived
yourself! Where is the truth ?-and how can we find
it ? Were it not better to remain where Providence has
placed us at our birth, than to plunge into the dark gulf,
with only the light of our own blinded eyes ?"

are
"It were indeed," answered Beattie ; "it were better,
far better to remain patiently under any system, however
faulty, in which Providence has placed us, than to attempt
escape solely by the light of our own eyes. Others have
fled from Romanism in this way, and their end has for
the most part been destruction. But you are not thus
deluded. Heaven, in making us Christians, as in making
us men, has willed that we should live, and that in all our
deeds we should act, not as individuals, but in society,
under rulers, as members of a body, as children of a
family. Think not that, in abandoning the false system
and the usurping rulers under which you have so long
lived, you are to be left without a shelter or a guide. You
not deciding upon truth and falsehood, right and
wrong, by its accordance with your own notions, without
any thought of an authority by which it is to be decided
for you ; rather you are placing yourself under authority,
aud submitting yourself to your rightful ruler instead of an
usurper."
" I know it," replied Lady Eleanor, " I have not
forgotten what you have urged so often ; and yet when
the hour approaches I tremble and doubt. Am I-am I
fit to distinguish between the false prophet and the true,
the false usurper and the lawful sovereign, any more than
between falsehood and truth, good and evil, in themselves ?
Must not the dimness of my own eyes, and the defilement
of my own heart mix with and pervert my judgment in
each case alike ?"
" They may," replied Beattie, " and they must do so.
But this is the trial placed before us all by Heaven, and
from which we cannot be exempted. This is that exer-
cise of our private judgment respecting which, whether
it be a right or a duty, we need not ask; all that we know
is, that we cannot escape from it. As reasoning beings
we must persevere in it. And we are so far safe from
the evils and sins of the license of human will and of
human reason, when, in determining our course, we
resolve to inquire, not which path seems best to ourselves,
but who is the proper guide for us to follow-not what we
Bhall adopt, but wbom we shall obey."

" And yet," said Lady Eleanor"alas ! all this I
have heard from you before. But you must tell me it
again. Tell it to me, and I will listen humbly."
" I would remind you," said Beattie, " of that great
rule which we laid down for the right exercise of this
choice. I warned you often and earnestly against look-
ing for the test of a true commission from Heaven-for
the seal of your rightful rulers in the Church--to any of
those deceitful marks which are too commonly appealed
to in this day. Look not for it to anything within your
self, or within the minds of others. It is an outward
mark. Deem not that sanctitysuch sanctity as most
attracts the eye of man, or purity, or self-denial, or
asceticism, or much praying, or much fasting, or much
almsgiving, even if they really exist, re a test of truth.
They may be found, and they have been found, in the
authors of many a heresy and schism, and of revolt even
from the moral laws of God, coupled with those hidden
seeds of wilfulness, obstinacy, presumption, and pride,
which are crimes no less than sensuality. Talent,
learning, eloquence, you would not yourself look to.
Providence, who knows our weakness, has not thus left
us to the temptations of our own follieshas not trusted
the criterion of truth to these inward marks, of which so
many cannot be fully discerned, and so many must be
liable to be mistaken by corrupt men ; rather, he has
sealed and marked his appointed servants with an exter-
nal commission ; and for this we must search. In judging
this we are not liable to be deceived by our own prejudices,
or by a morbid conscience. And now recall to your mind
what has so often been urged to you on the comparative
external commission of Romanism, and of the Church in
England."
" And yet," said Lady Eleanor, " sanctity and truth
cannot be separated."
"Not real sanctity," said Beattie, "not real truth.
But Heaven has not confined the appointment of its
ministers to holy men.

waive the question now, whether the Romish Church be
more holy than the English-whether those unhappy
men within the English Church, to whom you appeal,
and who, while they remain in the bosom of their mother,
are treacherously reviling and betraying her, are marked
by such signs of sanctitythat is, of humility, let us say
-self-distrust, meekness, charity, as would constitute
them safe guides of opinion. Whatever be the sanctity
of such a communion, or of such men, it is no infallible
test of a divine commission, as it would give no autho-
rity to preach, or to administer the Sacraments, without
an outward call. O Lady Eleanor, let us not be deceived
by this false plea, which has already torn the Church
into sects, and is the very badge of that rationalism and
dissent against which she must so earnestly strive."
" And yet," said Lady Eleanor, even you have not
blamed me, when I confessed that what I have seen my.
self in Hawkstonethe sanctity of this house for instance,
the self-devotion and charity of its inmates, the dedication
to religion of all the learning, and wealth, and labor, by
which your own community has been restored and sup-
ported, and under the influence of which heresy and
schism are vanishing from your neighborhoodthat all
this has weighed deeply with me, and compelled me to
think of the English Church in a light which it never wore,
where I saw it only secularised and paralysed, and im-
potent for any great work of Christian love. I thought
it could not bear such fruits as those which it bears here.
Are not these marks of its truth ?"
They are marks, assuredly," said Beattie.

comforts, and consolations, and supports.
But let us first
rest our allegiance on a visible external commission.
Even if the Church of England could exhibit no such
fruitseven if it remained for ever maimed and mutilated
in its most important organs, it might be still the duty of
her children to remain in her bosom, or to return to her
from a state of schism, and to endeavor to perfect her

organization, while they reverently acknowledged her
authority, even in her state of weakness. Her deficien.
cies are the deficiencies of individuals ; they are not parts
of her system. As well might we estimate the authority
of our Creator by the viciousness of men, who are his
creatures, as the authority of a church by the sins of its
members, so long as both Heaven and the Church, in all
the formal promulgations of their law, protest against evil,
and command holiness."
Lady Eleanor remained silent, and Beattie continued.
" And now," he said, " call to mind that in all this
fearful conflict between truth and falsehood, still upon
grand fundamental principles the whole of apostolical
Christendomthe Eastern Church as well as the Ro.
mish, the Romish as well as the English--are solemnly
agreed. All with one voice proclaim that Christ has
founded one, and one Church onlymall, that this Church
is founded on the Apostles and Prophetsall, that with
Divine revelation man may not dare to mix any thing
that is human-all, that the Church, from the first day to
the end of the world, must be governed by externally-com-
missioned rulers, preaching because they are sent, and
preaching only what they receive-all, that without the
pale of the Church there is no promise of salvation, and
that they who separate from it are guilty of a deadly sin,
measured and punished in the sight of Heaven, like all
other sins, by the degrees of light against which it has
been committed. With these great truths acknowledged,
a Christian, even in the midst of heresy and schism, can.
not become an infidel. All that he has to guard against
is the falling into either heresy or schism by departing
from the apostolical doctrine, or from the apostolical poli.
ty of the Church. Thus far I am only stating the very
principles under which you have been nurtured in Ro.
manism. As you value your own soul, and the safety of
the Church and of Divine truth, never abandon them.
They are as valid and as true in the English as in the
Romish Communion. The unity of the Church, the
extinction of heresy, the suppression of schism, are ob-
jects not less dear to us, nay, dearer than to any upholder

And it is to save you from the guilt of

on to acknowledge the paramount claim of the English
Church to your allegiance in this land.
" For the guilt of heresy I will for the present waive.
I will lay aside all consideration of what, as an individual,
I believe to be in the Romish system fearful corruptions
of truth, criminal tamperings with the Divine ordinances
-if not amounting wholly to formally declared heresy, at
least filled with such a presumptuous and unevangelical
spirit as to justify the name of Antichristian. Even

were living in Rome, or in a land where there was no
Apostolical Church lawfully constituted and perpetuated,
but one which acknowledged the Romish supremacy,
should argue very differently. Then it would be neces-
sary to examine the question of heresyto consider what
was corrupt and vicious in the doctrines and practice of
that Romish Church of which Providence had made us
members; to endeavor, by lawful, humble, and peaceful
means, to change the hearts of our rulers, and to bring them
to correct what was amiss; to obey them still in all things
lawful ; to refuse obedience only where our conscience, not
leaning on itself, but supported by the external testimony
of the primitive and other churches, denounced the act
as criminal; and to submit without a murmur to any
punishment which might be inflicted on us. This would be
our course of proceeding if we were inhabitants of Rome.
" But in England the case is wholly different. Your
first duty is to detach yourself from a state of schism, to
place yourself under your lawful rulers, just as it is the
first duty of a citizen, who has been seduced into rebellion,
not to cavil at or criticise the laws, but to acknowledge
the authority of his lawful sovereign. When this has
been done, then we may proceed to examine what re.

And by what outward marks we know the
English Church to be our lawful mother and mistress in
this land you have often heard."
Lady Eleanor answered, faintly, " Yes ;" but she
drew her hands over her eyes, as if a mist were hanging
upon them, and sighed bitterly.
Beattie was deeply touched, and even alarmed. He
almost proposed to himself to postpone the solemn cere
mony for which he had so long been training her mind,
and which she had so earnestly coveted. The sudden
vacillation and misgiving struck him at first as inexplica.
ble. But he reflected how fearful is the shock which
unsettles our religious faith, especially one which uproots
a system so deeply entwined as Romanism with the very
life-strings of human nature. And Beattie also knew
that near to us and about us are tempters, whom we
cannot see, and to whom power may be permitted for a
time to perplex and disturb the minds even of saints.
He once more knelt down with her in prayer; for prayer is,
he knew, the first and best (if not the only) solution of all
doubts. And as he reached the close, touched by an
affecting allusion, which brought before her the image of
her Saviour mourning over the rending to pieces of his
Church, she melted into tears, and a weight seemed to
pass from her heart. She looked up, with her hands
clasped fervently, her eyes lifted up to Heaven with in-
tense devotion and gratitude. And as Beattie would
have raised her from her knees, she shook her head, and
her breast.
"No," she said, "it is goneit is past. Blessed
be His holy name! the dark hour is over. Strange that
it should ever have visited me. But it is gone like a
cloud. Alas! that I have sinned in doubt. Pray for me
that I may be forgiven!"
And Beattie did pray.
And at last, calmed and com.
posed, Lady Eleanor rose from her knees, and meekly
and humbly she asked Beattie if she might go over with
him once more the grounds and reasons which had fortified
her resolution to ask admission into the English Church.

able, and clear as ever.
They are permitted," replied Beattie," to visit even
the most favored servants of Heaven; and prayer is our
only protection and refuge against them, and in our mo-
ments of calm and quiet to dwell again and again upon
those truths and facts which are the reasonable foundation
of our conduct. Remember what has so often been
proved, tht man may not dare to disturb either the doc-
trine or the ecclesiastical polity which has been posi-
tively established by an authority evidently Divine--that
it was an acknowledged principle of ecclesiastical po-
lity in the primitive ages, founded if not upon direct apos-
tolical injunctions, at least upon the practice of the uni.
versal Church, as well as upon sound reason, that one
bishop should not interfere with the diocese of another,
or one patriarch with another's patriarchate. The cu-
menical councils are full of intimations to this purpose.
The supremacy which the Pope claims over all other
bishops, and on which alone he rests his title to inter-
fere with your lawful bishops and to withdraw your obe-
dience, is confessed by his own adherents to have been
no part of the primitive system of the Church for the
first four centuries at least. It was not recognised by
one half of Christendom, the Eastern Church, nor by
the ancient British Church, nor by the ancient Irish
Church ; it was repudiated even by early popes as a
badge and sign of Antichrist. It rests on no evidence,
no commission,-on nothing but the assumption of Rome
herself. Its gradual reception by the Western Churches
can be traced step by step to motives and acts of human
policy and short-sighted expediency. It made its way in
an age of darkness, in minds corrupted and deceived,
when the criteria of historical truth were confessedly
unknown and unpractised. Even then it encountered
on all sides perpetual opposition and denial, especially in

315
England, by which protests its rightfulness was contesto
ed, and even the title of modern prescription precluded.
It is made by Rome an essential article of faith, but it is
not found in any creed of the ancient Church, or in any
part of the Bible, except as extracted from it by meta-
phors which might deduce anything from anything. It
is enforced upon the mind, without having ever been de-
fined, so as to become fixed and intelligible. Its extent
is disputed even among Romanists themselves. It varies
in different countries. It is made paramount to all ques-
tions of Divine truth. And if the power of human min-
isters of Heaven be recognised, Romanism cares little
either for articles of doctrine or uniformity of worship.
Rome would have sanctioned our Liturgy, if we would
have acknowledged the supremacy:
"It has been from the beginning the fertile, essen.
tial, unceasing cause of rebellion and bloodshed. It
originated the schism of one half of Christendom from
the other, by compelling the Eastern Church to protest
against a claim which went to invalidate the very foun.
dations of the Christian faith. It resisted every attempt
to reform the Church in the fifteenth century, and thus is
justly chargeable with the heresies and blasphemies
which followed the Reformation. Instead of unity, it
has produced division ; instead of peace, discord ; in-
stead of purity of doctrine, corruptions of the truth, which
are known to be corruptions from having no sanction,
either in apostolical tradition, or in the Scriptures, or in
the analogy of faith. And thus it stands upon no ground
whatever, either of apostolical institution, or of primitive
antiquity, or of expediency. And if we might then ven-
ture to examine it by the light of reason, it is contrary to
the analogy of the Divine nature and operations, and
exhibits rather a retrogression in the development of His
revelations than an advance. It is virtually a restoration
of Judaism. It wants every mark which our blessed
Lord set upon His own divine commission and ministry ;
and the only pretended titles, which even itself exhibits,
are the abuse of figurative language, historical falsehoods,
and exploded forgeries.

" These proofs you have had set before you, as far as
you have been capable of following them, and far enough
to satisfy your mind that these assertions are deserving
of confidence. But if Rome has no title to your allegi-
ance, no ministers of the Church can have but those who
derive their authority from an apostolical source. Once
more revert to the historical proof that the bishops of
England, at this day, are the regular legitimate succes.
sors of those to whom the Apostles committed the power
of ordaining ministers in each church. The chain was
not broken at the Reformation. In casting off the Ro.
mish yoke, and many superstitious practices which had
crept in with it, they only exercised an undoubted right;
they did not sever themselves from the Church, for to
the ancient Catholic Church they reverted for the con-
firmation of their doctrine, and from it they derived their
authority. They did not violate any positive institutions
of Heaven: rather, in abjuring the papacy, and asserting
the due independence of national churches, they restored
the positive institutions of the Almighty, and once more
secured the framework which he had created for the pre-
servation of the truth, and which Rome had broken up
and destroyed. Even if, in the doctrines and practices
which they then rejected, they had cast off any rashly, or
introduced any erroneously, unless these errors were such
as to destroy the essence of the Anglican Church as a
branch of the Catholic Church, still our duty would be to
remain within it, and to endeavor to correct what was
amiss by legitimate efforts, rather than to throw ourselves
into a schismatical body; just as we may not join the
standard of an usurper because our lawful sovereign may,
in some points, have abused his authority. But when
you search for the changes which the English Church
did make at the Reformation, can you find any

did in any way touch the chain of apostolical succession
in the appointment of bishops, Rome has done the same
in her interferences with their appointment. If it de-
parted in any point from the primitive ministration of the
holy Eucharist, Rone has departed farther. If the
Reformation was attended by acts of extortion and robbery,
what was the secular cause of the Reformation itself but
the avarice of Rome? If it was effected by evil men in
the laity, what has been the character of popes? If it
was furthered by the interference of the civil arm, what
has been the history of Rome but a perpetual toleration
cr complaint of the same interference ? If in any way
it encumbered the simplicity of the apostolic faith by the
addition of dogmatic statements, what are the decrees of
Trent and the creed of Pope Pius? If it has been fol.
lowed by heresy and schism, what is the very Reforma-
tion in the eyes of the Romish Church but a heresy and
schism from itself? If it has left the English Church
comparatively mutilated and weak, what is Rome herself
coinpared with her former grandeur ? If its system as a
whole be a change from that of apostolical ages, what is
the system of Rome? And if the motives of this change,
as avowed by ecclesiastical authority, and therefore
chargeable upon the Church as a church, be compared
with the motives of Rome, is it better and more holy to
struggle for the purification of a corrupted faith, or for
the aggrandisement of worldly power ? If England has
sinned, she has sinned to release others from bondage ;
Rome to enslave others to herself."
Beattie paused. He had spoken slowly, deliberately,
and calmly; and Lady Eleanor, with her eyes fixed on
the ground, had drunk in his words with almost suspended
breath. They were only the repetition of what she had
often heard from him before. And now that the strange
paroxysm under which she had labored had passed away,
they restored the whole tone of her mind; and she even
wondered that any cloud of doubt should ever have come
between her and the truth.
She thanked him fervently and reverently. And he
then led her on to speak on her future plans, reminding

her especially of the perils which attend a departure from
one faith to another, where any self-indulgence is allowed
to interfere as a motive, or to follow in its train.
" I know it," she said ; " and my future course of life
is fixed. We cannot suffer deeply and sharply without
tearing up the ties which bind us to earth, whether they
be memories or hopes. All that was bright in life is
now to me dead and dull. And calm, and retirement, and
hours for prayer, and interests of Christian usefulness, are
all that I now long for. For the future this will be my
home. They have promised to receive me among them
into this blessed and holy shelter. Whatever worldly
advantages Providence has vouchsafed to me cannot be
better employed than in ministering to their wants and
extending the sphere of their duties. And He" But
here she stopped, almost choked with her emotions.
" Alas !" she resumed, after a pause,
6 lacerated and
bleeding hearts, which have been passed through fright-
ful ordeals of suffering and fear, are not made for happi-
ness hereafter upon earth. Peace is all which they
can hope for ; and solitude, and silence, and tranquil
communion with Heaven, all which they should covet."
Beattie could not refrain from uttering a blessing
over her head.
" There is another," he said, " who feels
as you do, and rejoices that even in this you sympathise
with himself. Even though separate on earth, hearts,
and souls, and lives may be joined in communion in
Heaven. Blessed are you both, that no doubt or reviving
thought of self mingles with the anxious pains of such a
moment as the presentthat you are fixed and steadfast
in devoting all that Providence has given you to others,
not to yourselvesthat you would rather withdraw your-
selves from each other in this life, to be united more
closely in another, than risk the loss of peace of con-
science, of Heaven itself
, by riveting again those earthly
chains which Providence itself seems to have broken
from you."
" I could not," said Lady Eleanor, " have done other-
wise. I could not take the step on which I have resolved
without making with it such a sacrifice as would prove

319
to iny own conscience that I was not acting froin a
motive of self-indulgence. Even the opinion of the world
it would have been hard to face ; but there is that within
which it is harder still to brave. No, let such an act as
this be at least clear even from the suspicion of self
interest and self-deceit before both Heaven and man."
Once more Beattie gave her his blessing, and pre.
pared to take his leave, promising to be with her the
next day, some little time before the bishop would arrive
at the Bguinage, in the little chapel of which he had
promised to admit Lady Eleanor into the coinmunion of
the Church, at the same time that he administered the
rite of confirmation to some of the younger females, who
were dwelling within its walls, partly under its shelter
from the world, and partly as receiving education from
its inmates. As he left the room he met upon the stairs
one of the Sisters, who was coming out of a little suite
of rooms appropriated to an infirmary for poor women.
It was one whom we have long lost sight of, but not
forgotten-our good friend Mabel-active, energetic,
devoted, unselfish as ever, but now quiet, regular, self-
disciplined, trained in habits of obedience and order, and
reaping the fruits of a well-directed enthusiasm in the
affectionate respect of all the inmates of the house, who
owed to her zealous co-operation with Mrs. Bevan no
small a portion of their happiness and comfort. She was
followed by a female, in a dress not unlike her own, but
slightly distinguished from it. And as her pale, care-
worn, but still beautiful face looked up at Beattie with
eyes in which at times there seemed to wander some
strange memories of past scenes, some fitful glances of a
disturbed reason, Beattie stopped to address her. He
called her by her name, Margaret, inquired for her health
kindly; and poor Margaret, coloring and abashed, yet
grateful for his notice, answered him with reverence.
She had been received into the house only a few weeks
since, on the recovery of her reason, and on her removal
from the asylum in which she had been placed.
An

means of support, scarcely recovered from the shock of

her long illness, her intellect still weak, her feelings
lacerated, she was driven by necessity out of the shelter
of the asylum, to die of starvation. Mrs. Bevan had found
her seated under the little archway of the Bguinage, one
bitterly cold evening-sitting there without speaking,
without asking for help, afraid to make her name known
lest the sad memory of one sin, dong since repented of,
should still steel the hearts and shut the doors of her
fellows against her. And when her story was known,
she had been admitted into the shelter of the holy house,
there to make perfect her repentance, and to become, as
penitents should become, the servant and menial of those
who had not sinned as she had.
Beattie was still speaking to her, when a violent
knocking was heard at the gate, and a demand followed
for immediate admission from a rude voice, agitated
apparently by passion, yet affecting composure and gen.
tleness.
CHAPTER XXII.
Before we can explain the cause of the rude knocking
at the gate of the Beguinage, we must return once more
to the little green gate in the lane of Hawkstone, which
conducted into the garden of the Reverend P. O'Foggarty,
and we must enter even into that gentleman's study.
He was sitting there in company with the mendicant,
whom we left last in the chapel of the Priory. There
were words and expostulations of harsh and angry import,
fierce recriminations, mutual charges, violence of gesture
-every thing which could imply a meeting between
men engaged in some deep plot, and disappointed of their
object by the awkwardness or mismanagement of one of
the parties.
Awkwardness and mismanagement, indeed, there had
been on the part of Mr. O'Foggarty. Notwithstanding

321
his general blandness of demeanor, which indicated
acquaintance with the world, he possessed little of that
real knowledge of human nature for which Pearce was
so remarkable. And in particular, he had been totally
unable to understand or appreciate, and still more unable
to direct, a mind of such exquisite delicacy and refinement
as Lady Eleanor's. He had scarcely undertaken the
office of her spiritual adviser, and established himself at
Lord Claremont's in the place of the good Abb St. Maur,
than she perceived the difference between them, and
penetrated through the veil of assured courteousness and
liberality which he had thought it politic to assume. St.
Maur, in all his ministrations and reasonings, had ex-
hibited the Catholic rather than the Romanist. His
holiness, his simplicity, his charity, true copies of many a
noble and saintly character reared in the bosom of the
Gallican Church, and preserved as by an atmosphere of
personal piety from the contagion of the evil system of
the papacy, had prevented the intrusion of a single doubt
into Lady Eleanor's mind. She contrasted his self-
devotion, his obedience to his Church, his fasts, his alms,
his prayers, his reverence for antiquity, the firm and
unwavering character of his belief, his recognition of
authority and guidance in all his opinions and ministra-
tions, with the selfishness, the individualism, the indul-
gence, the secularity, the bustle, the modern frivolity, the
lawless speculations and arrogant presumption which
prevailed in all that she saw of the religious world of
Protestantism. For into the deeper recesses of the
Church of England she was not able to penetrate. Its
real saints, its noblest children, shrink from the public
eye. They do not appear upon platforms, or congregate
at meetings, or talk loudly, or write boldly. And of that
which was obtruded upon her sight, even in the Church
of England, too much partook of a tone which jarred
upon her delicacy, and, to speak most gently, failed to
satisfy her yearnings for a calm, lofty, ethereal spirit of
unworldliness and devotion. Moreover, all the harsher
and more dubious points of the Romish system, St. Maur
had softened down and veiled from het 'yesnot artfully,

not hypocritically, but by the innocence of his own mind.
Its intrusive, intriguing proselytism became, in his hands,
zeal for the propagation of the faith; its stern, sanguinary
despotism, firmness in defence of the truth; its idolatry, a
healthy stimulus of a fervent adoration; its blasphemous
worship of the blessed Virgin, a holy and reverent
affection towards an image of purity and bliss, transcen-
dant above all human imaginations ; its bold tampering
with the creeds and the sacraments, and the polity of the
Apostles, an economy of prudence and necessity; and its
rationalism and presumption in speaking above what is
written, a reverent care to extinguish controversies and
satisfy doubts. So it is with those who see only the one
side, the illuminated phase of the Papacy.
But O'Foggarty's was a different mind. Worldly,
and unchastened in heart, he had been drilled into the
Popish system under hands which cared for little but the
preservation of an exterior, and for a prudent policy. He
had been taught controversy in that cold, hard, unspiritual
form, which it assumes in the polemics of men whose
object is not truth, but conquest. And instead of that
single eye which, looking outward, sees all things inward
by a faculty of instinctive wisdom, they had initiated him
in a theory of policy and of human nature, carefuily con.
structed upon technical rules, in which the heart had no
place-nothing was left to the full course and impulse of
good affectionsall was calculated-all artificial-all full
of self-consciousness and self-interest. With him, even
the worst features of the Papacy, however dissembled
before others, came out, and were enforced in his pri.
vate communications as parts of the system, all bound
together by the one stern bond of infallibility and su
premacy. And the most delicate and perilous of all his
religious ministrations, that in which art and system
can have the least place, and in which no technical skill
can atone for the want of a chastened heart and single-
ness of mindthe confessional- assumed, in his hands,
a form so utterly repulsive, that Lady Eleanor was com-
pelled to retire from it. ('Foggarty saw his mistake,
and, instead of enforcing her obedience, succumbed to

her resistance, and offered to a :commodate himself to her
wishes. From that moment the spell of his authority
was broken. Only a few days afterwards Charles Bevan,
as rector of the parish, had visited Lord Claremont.
He had seen both the Earl and Lady Eleanor, and with.
out hesitation or circumlocution he had reminded them of
his own spiritual authority over them as their legitimate
parish priest; and warned them against the sin of schism ;
had offered to lay before them the titles on which his claim
was rested ; and had also, on a second visit, declared his
determination, with the consent of his bishop, deliberately
to sever from the Church, by the act of the Church,
all those within the parish, who obstinately and wilfully
should refuse to submit to instruction, and should
continue in schism, and to proceed to a formal excom.
raunication.
It was a bold, and many would have thought it a rash
step. But Bevan was well advised. He had resolved
i hat he would not remain in the painful position in which
many of his brethren had been placed, by being compelled
'o recognise as children of the Church, and to perform the
nost solemn offices of the Church for, those who were in
open rebellion against her. He felt acutely the mockery
and ridicule thus cast on the most awful ministrations of
the Church ; the contempt thus poured upon the clergy;
the blindness and hardness of heart in respect to the
guilt of schism, which was thus encouraged in the igno-
rant and weak; and the total confusion and destruction
which was threatened to the very nature and being of a
Church. His bishop had promised to support him ; and
after a formal and distinct endeavor to obtain a hearing
for his instruction, those whose minds appeared ob.
stinate and incorrigible, he resolved solemnly to excom-
municate.
The effect of this boldness upon Lady Eleanor,
as upon nearly all other schismatics in the parish, was
startling. It made them reflect. It was the assertion of
an authority of which they had never dreamed.

belong to an ambassador of Heaven, and the very claim
of which, boldly and unhesitatingly made, was in itself
an evidence of their truth. O'Foggarty met the menace
with laughter and ridicule. But Bevan's calmness, firm.
ness, solemnity, and depth of thought, strongly impressed
Lady Eleanor. She did not refuse to see him again.
Lord Claremont fell into his last sickness; and she was
left more at liberty to think and to study. And though
in her rare communications with Villiers, he studiously
avoided the subject, she could not but see in him an ex-
ample and image of the Church, to which she recurred
in every doubt, and which attracted her reverence, while
Bevan's arguments acted on her reason.
Neither was
she without another image of the English Church, another
proof of the energy which it could develope and the
holiness which it could generate, in the two religious com-
munities now rising into maturity under her own eye.
Little had she supposed that the English Church could
ever create societies for prayers, for alms-giving, for
fasting, for meditation. She visited frequently the little
sisterhood of the Bguinage ; and there, at her own re-
quest, Mrs Bevan placed her in communication with
Beattie, whose age was greater, and his learning deeper,
and his character more formed, than Bevan's ; and the
work was accomplished. O'Foggarty retired in despair.
" And this, then," said the mendicant to him, "is the
end of your soft ways and delicate words." And as he
spoke his lips curled upwards with a bitter sneer.
O'Foggarty was silent.
6 You have lost him," continued Pearce, "and es.
tranged her. And your chapel is unfinished, and your
school deserted, and you yourself driven to quit the place
from mere lack of support. Did I not tell you it would
be so ?"
O'Foggarty still sat silent, with a vexed and angry air.
" You have ruined every thing," said Pearce.
Why did you not join the new Union Anti-religious
Distinction School, the one on the Irish plan, that the
Government has set up? That would have done some.
thing for us."

"I did," replied O'Foggarty ; "I joined it from the
first, and was one of the petitioners for it."
"And why did not you make use of it, then ?" said
Pearce.
"I did," answered the other. "I got one of our
own Catholics appointed to the mastership; and every
thing was going on well ; only Villiers found out that I
said mass in the schoolroom, and had brought over two of
the young heretics to come to chapel. I got the school
built close by the gate for that very reason ; and he
complained, and the board were obliged to dismiss the
man."
" And then you gave it up ?" asked Pearce, contempt-
nously.
"I did not," replied the other, in anger; "I sent all
my boys there, and drilled them thoroughly, and taught
hem how to attack the young heretics in play-hours, and
what to say; and sereral of them came over to us in
consequence. And I watched every word the new
schoolmaster said ; and if he uttered a syllable about
religion, or any thing connected with the church, I
threatened to bring him before the commissioners, so
that he was frightened, and shut up his mouth. One day,
when our bishop, the Bishop of Eliopolis, came to look
at the school, one of the Protestant boys asked the mas-
ter which was the true bishop, the bishop who confirmed
hin, or the Bishop of Eliopolis ; and the master had the
impudence to say it was the bishop who confirmed him.
I had him up before the commissioners instantly, and he
got soundly reprimanded for introducing peculiar doc.
trines; and was ordered to tell the boys that he did not
know, and that he had been under a mistake ; and that
both were the right bishops. But this could not last long ;
for the boys went on asking him questionswhat they
were to think about this, and about that; and he was
obliged to tell them he did not know any thing about it,
that the man
anuscripts differed, or rather that he knew very
well, but the government did not know, or had not made
up their mind, and would not allow him to tell them.
At last there came a hot-headed curate, ard he began

drilling his boys in controversy, as I did mine, as the only
way of saving them from corruption. And then the
young ones used to fight and abuse each other all play-
hours, notwithstanding the fine exhortation to love and
peace, as papists and heretics, and I know not what. At
last Bevan came to the living, and he took away all his
boys at once, and would not allow one of them to go
near the place ; so it was not my fault that the school did
not answer for us.'
Pearce sat moodily, with his hands before his eyes.
" And to-morrow, you say," he exclaimed, " she is to
apostatise formally ?"
" Yes," answered O'Foggarty, "in the chapel of
that Protestant Bguinage."
" It cannot be, it never shall be !" exclaimed the
mendicant, striking the table with his clenched hand ;
" she does it that she may marry him. Who would trust
a woman's faith, or care for a woman's doctrine? She
is resolved to marry him at last, and that is why she
apostatises. But I have sworn that they never shall be
one; I have that which can stop it even now.
And he rose up passionately, seized his hat, and
scarcely wishing O'Foggarty good night, he hurried into
the street.
The cold wind howled round him as he reached the
open air, but the infuriated man felt it not upon his burn-
ing forehead. A man was standing at a little distance,
who had apparently been waiting for him. And Pearce
made a sign for him to approach. It was Connell. Even
in the paroxysm of passion, the cool calculating mind of
the mendicant had prepared for the worst. He had
brought Connell with him, as a tool always ready in his
hand, and whose testimony he might require, and who
had learnt in his own country to care little for the so-
lemnity of an oath when he could evade it by some vain
form, or stifle conscience by a plea of serving his church.
And now he bade the wretched man follow him, and
watch what might happen. If he should be detained
if any sign of mischief should appear, Connell had his
instructions ready. Pearce had preparid against this

walls, to which he had conducted his young fellow-tra-
veller, and in which that fellow-traveller was now im.
mured, and almost kept prisoner against his will, till the
time for action should arrive. Once more Pearce had
assumed the direction of a deep-laid, long-plotted, insur-
rectionary movement among the turbulent population of
the district. The trains had all been laid, and all was
ready for explosion at a given moment.
" Follow me," he said to Connell ; " wait a little
distance off. If I am detainedif you see any sign oi
policemen, ascertain what they are about ; and if I am
in danger, hasten off to the Forest." Connell withdrew
a little way; and Pearce, once more abandoning him.
self to the full tide of his passion, hurried on.
He strode along the pavement, and nearly threw down
a miserable old woman who was crawling home with a
few sticks, which she had picked up to light a cheerless
momentary blaze in her wretched hovel. Pearce only
answered her cry of fear with a ferocious curse. He
came in front of the house where he lodged before ; and
as he passed, though it was dark, he slouched his hat
over his face. The unfinished pinnacles of the Romish
chapel caught his eye, and once more he uttered a dread.

now,

And the mendicant drew up his figure, and stood for
a moment exultingly, as if recovered from his defeat and
sure of victory. But a sudden chill, he knew not how,
fell upon him-a dreary blank, as if all was in vain ; and
something of a mysterious, superstitious horror, as if a
cloud of vengeance long overcharged above his head were
about to burst upon him. He staggered, and leaned
against the lamp-post.
And at that moment two men
came round the corner, bearing sometbing upon their
shoulders. It was black, oblong, hollowand Pearce
saw that it was a coffin. He shrunk back as it passed,
lest it should touch him; and then to recover himself
from a shock which it had given him, he hurried on.
"I can swear," he muttered to himself, " that she is
still living-in Italy or Naples. It will take time, at
least, to clear it up; and in time something else may
happen. If she will only listen to mewill but put it off.
I can make up a story that he deserted her was cruel to
herthat she ran away from himand then that he
pretended she was dead to deceive his father. Anything
will doanything for the present. I can swear."
And as he uttered the last word he reached the arched
gateway of the Bguinage. He stopped ; hardened as he
was, almost blinded with the wild struggle of baffled and
desperate revenge, he yet feit one last expiring pang of
remorse and fear--a fear, undefined and superstitious, but
which made him shudder. The churchyard lay before
him; its wan tombstones gleaming like spectres in the pale
light of a waning moon. And amongst them he saw a
figure watching steadfastly, silently, moving not, but with
a shadowy hand lifted up as if ready to seize him. Was
it a vision of his fevered blood ? He rubbed his eyes, but
in vain; the figure was still there. He had forgotten
Connell. Almost maddened with a conflict of passions,
he rang the bell furiously. Then he recovered himself
sufficiently to request admittance to see Lady Eleanor, on
the most urgent business; and he assumed a voice of
feigned composure and gentleness. The wicket gate
was opened after a little delay to allow Beattie to pass
out, while Pearce himself was admitted to wait in the

little lodge until Lady Eleanor's pleasure could be
known. But scarcely had he passed through the gate,
and the lamp which burned within had 'flashed upon his
face, than the female who had opened the wicket uttered
a loud shriek, and called him by his name. It was the
voice of poor Margaret; and Margaret had recogniseil
him-recognised the man whom she had always re-
garded in her mind as the tempter and destroyer of her
husband.
" Stop him !" she cried to Beattie.

There was no escape.

CHAPTER XXIII.
THERE stands at one angle of the north side of the
cloister of Hawkstone Priory a square projecting tower
adjoining the chapel, and apparently communicating with
some of those secret passages with which its walls are
perforated. Traditions were rife in the neighborhood of
subterraneous openings into vaults and crypts below;
and a legend is still current of a tale of blighted affection,
in which one of the ancient inmates of the Priory was
supposed to have retired into its shelter after the loss of
a dear-loved wife, a member of the Villiers family, and
to have built this tower adjoining to her last resting-
place in the Villiers vault, that he might solace himself
with her memory, and even, as it was said, might pass,
unperceived, his hours of prayer and nightly vigils close to
her remains, even in the vault itself. Only one or two
persons were supposed to be acquainted with the secret
of these mysterious passages, which were hidden in the
face of the wall by large slabs of stone turning upon
pivots, and opening by secret springs. And the secret
had been turned to account hy he insurrectionary agenta.

who had planned the disturbances in the Forest, and who
had thus been enabled to deposit securely the arms which
they were preparing and collecting. When Villiers had
restored the Priory, he had allowed this tower, as well
as every other part which he could retain, to stand
untouched.
But the low vaulted chamber, which formed its lowest
portion, had scarcely ever been occupied. It was
gloomy, chilly, lighted only by two narrow lancet win.
dows perforated in the thickest part of the wall. And
even when a sunbeam penetrated into it, and fell upon
the rough stone floor, it seemed as if it had lost its way,
and would fain have struggled back into the outer air.
The Priory clock had just tolled twelve that night,
and all but a few inmates of the Priory were asleep, when
a light glimmered at the end of the cloisters, and five
figures appeared. Two of them were officers of justice,
and they led between them a third, habited like a men-
dicant. He was not handcuffed or chained, but his every
movement was watched lest he should attempt an escape;
and his dogged, gloomy, ferocious, but desperate expres.
sion of countenance, showed that he had abandoned all
hopes of it. Those who bore the lanterns were Beattie
himself and Cookesley. The low arched door of the
tower, ribbed with strong oak, and massive with nails,
was opened. The miserable prisoner was led into the
chamber; a dreary, cheerless fire was kindled on the
unused hearth ; a single candle placed on a rude table in
the middle, and a bed having been made up for him in
one corner, Pearce was left to himself. The door was
double-locked on the outside, and the officers took up
their post for the night at the entrance of the prisoner's
chamber.
As the massive door slammed heavily, and rang
through the vaulted room, the wretched man sank down
upon a chair before the fire. His hat fell from his head,
and his hands dropped loosely by his side. He was
seemingly paralysed. Up to the present moment all his
plots and intrigues had been permitted, by a forbearing,
long-suffering Providence, to work almost without ob-

Atruction ; his calculations had all succeeded; he had
become almost careless and rash from repeated success.
That he should now have fallen into a snare, blindfolded
--that, within walls where he conceived no one could
have known him, he should have been instantly recognised
---that seeming accident should have brought together
Beattie and Bevan, at the moment when it was necessary
!0 give orders for his detentionand that Cookesley
himself should be at hand to identify him, and connect
him with the previous outbreak, which he had been sus.
pected of contriving, and for which warrants at the time
had been issued for his apprehension--all this was so
startling and surprising to him, that it seemed as if the
hand of vengeance were suddenly bared to smite him, and
a cloud were rolled away, revealing to him his past
mes, and his approaching punishment. One o'clock
struck, two o'clock, and three o'clock,-still he sat in the
same position, motionless. At last the fire was dying
out, and a cold chill compelled him to move and trim it;
and the movement in some degree broke his stupor, and
restored him to reason.
He looked round the low room
to see if there was any means of escape, but on each
side was a solid wall. The narrow lancets prohibited
all egress, and even they were barred. He climbed up
to them, on a wooden settle, but could see nothing with.
out; but just as he was descending from the one which
looked into the outer side of the cloister, and hung over
the little brook, he was startled by hearing a tap on the
glass. He stopped breathless. The tap was repeated,
and though superstitiously terrified at first, he moved, as
by a species of fascination, to the window. A small pane
in the lattice was shaken and moved. Presently it was
carefully taken out, and a hand was thrust in, holding a
note.
"Is that you, Connell ! " whispered Pearce.
" It is I, sir," was the answer. "But hush, for they
are watching in the cloister."
" How did you find me out ? " whispered Pearce.
" I watched the lights in the rooms all out, and when
this one semained burning, I thought it might be you,

or all will be lost. Let them come with all their strength.
If I am not rescued in a few hours they will be ruined."
He had spoken incautiously loud, and the step of one of
the policemen moved to the door. Pearce made signs to
Connell to retire ; and throwing himself once more upon
the chair, he

saved still," he muttered. "We have escaped from worse
things even than this. They must be here to-morrow-
to-morrow by noon at farthest." And, as if his mind was
relieved, he threw himself on the bed. But he was unable
to sleep. He tossed and started in an agony of alarm at
every sound, till the daylight had pierced into the room.
At last, worn out and exhausted, he took from his pocket
a strong opiate, which of late years he always carried
about him, and sank into a profound sleep. He dreamt
that he was standing on a rock, which looked down
upon a blue expanse of sea, fringed with a line of marble
palaces, and crowned with a smoke-wreathed mountain.
He saw a boat floating upon the waters, and in it two
forms, radiant with youth, and loveliness, and happiness.
And as he turned from the sight he saw, standing by his
side, a black and demon figure, at the very sight of
whom the bitterness of envy and malice gushed into his
heart. He thought that the Evil Being lited him up by
the hair of his head, and bore him over the waters, follow.

along the silver ripple. The arms of that angel pair
were circled round each other, and together they bent
them over a sleeping babe, dropping even tears of joy
upon its innocent and slumbering face.

like a vulture, and tore the child from their arms; and
the boal sank under the eddying water, with a hollow
shriek. But the child was now lying in the hands of the

matted with hair, and armed with claws ; and it sprang
up and clasped himn round the neck, and dragged him
down-down-down-an infinite depth-a depth of dark.
ness and horror; and the waves of the sea surged up
with hollow roars to catch him as he fell : they closed
over himthey boomed above his head. He would have
shrieked out, but the horrible monster clung round his
neck, and choked and strangled him. Down-down-
lower and lower, deeper, and deeperthey sank together!
And he gasped in agony; but still the monster grappled
him, and lay with his grim ghastly eyes staring fiercely
into his. There was a roaring around him, as of innu-
merable torrents, shrieks and screams, the thundering of
many waters, the hiss of ocean serpents, the wild un-
earthly cries of demons in agony calling to him by
name, and bidding him welcome to their place of torture.
He sprang upevery hair upon his head standing erect
with terror, and the sweat ready to drop from his fore-
head. Was it all a dream, or was it real ? There
were the noises still the fearful sounds, shrieks, and
screams, and cries of terror, and voices like those of
fiends calling on him by name ; and his head swam, and
he sank bank upon his pillow. But again he sprang up
in terror. There was thundering at the door of the
tower; and once more he heard his own naine repeated;
and he leaped from the bed, and remembered where he
was, and all that had passed. He looked round, and saw
faces leaping, and climbing up at the narrow windows;
and a cheer of triumph rose up when Connell tore away
the glass, and they could see Pearce himself.  Make
haste, sir," he cried, "make haste; there is no time to
lose-we are herewe have got possession of the place
- but they are comingthe yeomanry will be here in a
few minutes. You must come out at once, or it will be
too late."

" Break open the door," exclaimed Pearce
" how
can I get out without this?
" We cannot," said Connell ; "it is locked. The
policemen are killed ; and we cannot find the keys : they
are battering it now. And at the same moment the
massive oaken door, riveted with iron, and imbedded
deeply on its ponderous hinges, shook from top to bottom
with a tremendous crash.
" Cannot you get out here ?" asked a voice at the
window; and a rough hand endeavored, at the same time,
to tear away the iron stanchions. But they defied the
effort even of the gigantic muscular gripe which essayed
to move them. Pearce answered by a laugh of derision
and impatience. "Break down the door," he said ; "it
is all that you can do." And once more the door tottered,
and bent inward beneath another shock. Again and
again the battery was brought to bear upon the massive
oak; one of the solid pannels was split from top to bottom,
and light could be seen through it; and one of the hinges
had been forced more than an inch from its bed in the
solid stone : a few more blows would accomplish its
destruction. And Pearce, in an agony.of impatience, now
by oaths and execrations, and now with entreaties, was
urging the clamorous throng without to bring to bear upon
it the whole of their strength, ignorant that only a few
hands at a time could be employed in battering the door,
and that the narrowness of the cloister embarrassed their
efforts. Still there was little more to be done. Another
crash was heard, and the upper staple was all but forced
from the wall, when a loud cheer was heard on the out-
side of the Priory, responded to by a wild, irregular, con.
fused cry, partly of fear and partly of defiance, from the
party within the walls. And to Pearce's terror and dis-
may, he heard the cry ring through the cloisters" The
yeomanry are come ; save yourselves !" And the next
moment a heavy weight fell upon the stone pavement;
and the sound of flying feet was followed by a dead silence
at the door.
" They have abandoned me," he cried. 6 Traitors!
cowards ! villains ! they have left me to my fate. Fool

335
that I was to depend upon such cowards !" And he
rushed to the door, and endeavored with a convulsive
offort to tear it from its hinges, but it resisted all his
attempts. Then he laid his face to the key-hole, and
tried to see what was passing without; but the cloister,
one whole side of which was commanded by the door,
was empty. Beyond it there were cries and clamors, as
of a deadly conflict. Shots were fired-shrieks and
screams of the wounded mingled with cheers of triumph ;
but which side was victorious he could not know. Then
along the other end of the cloister came dropping back,
one by one, a few of the rioters, wounded, bleeding-
some of them mutilatedmore than one lying down to
die on the stone pavement. There was another cheer,
and the rear, as it were, of a dense body appeared at the
farthest end, retreating, fighting as it were, their ground
inch by inch. They wavered, gave way, fell into confu-
sion; at last the whole mass turned, and fled precipitately
in every direction And the bayonets of soldiers, and
the glittering of the yeomanry equipments, flashed through
the vaulted cloister.
Once more the insurgents rallied on the open green
sward round which the cloister ran, and which was not
built up towards the south. They formed themselves
into a dense body, seemingly under the marshalling and
direction of one leader. He was young, fair-haired, his
features delicately formed, his bearing full of grace and
spirit, his eye lighted up with animation; and, but for
the lines of premature vice and profligacy deeply engraven
on his countenance, his face would have formed a study
for a painter. He it was who rallied the routed fugitives;
and, armed with a sabre which he had wrested from one
of the yeomanry, whom he had dragged from his horse
to the ground, and left dead with two gashes upon his
head, he defied the advancing military. The next mo-
ment, round the south side of the cloister, was heard the
charge of the yeomanry. They halted, reined up their
horses in front of the rallied party, and their commander,
a tall and noble figure, with a voice of thunder, summoned
the insurgents to lay down their arms, and surrender
themselves prisoners.

" Never! cried the youth,
never, while we have
life!" and he sprang up and seized the bridle of Villiers's
charger with one hand, while with the other he aimed
at Villiers himself a deadly and tremendous blow. At
that moment, if any eye could have penetrated into the
vaulted room, and have beheld Pearce as he gazed
through the fractured crevices, they would have seen his
face for one moment turn white as ashes. Every particle
of blood seemed to have forsaken it; every movement
and pulse of life to be suspended. His eyeballs were
fixed. His hands grasped convulsively the iron ring of
the door, as if they would have bitten into the metal.
Then he sprang up with a cry of madness. Villiers had
swayed himself to avoid the blow, and with one stroke
dashing his assailant's weapon from his hand, he raised
himself in his stirrups, and his sword whirled round like
lightning, and descended upon a head, which it clove
asunder, and covered the horse and its rider with blood
and brains.
It was the head, not of the youthful assailant, but of
a haggard, savage, bloated, yet miserable-looking ruffian,
who had thrown himself in the way, that he might ward
off the blow from the head of his foster-child. Irishmen
never forget their children. And he had even inflicted
a severe wound upon the horseman himself. But his
body fell to the ground; and at the same moment Villiers
recovered himself, and once more grasping his sword,
prepared to prostrate his young antagonist, who had only
retired a few paces to renew the combat more fiercely
from the loss of the miserable Connell. But at that
moment the oak-ribbed door of the vaulted room, already
half torn from its hinges, fell with a crash. The prisoner
within it had thrown himself upon it with the desperation
and strength of a maniac. He tore it from its staples,
plunged across it with a cry that made even the combat.
ants turn round. But at the next spring, which he made
into the cloister, he fell back, staggering against the
wall, and the blood gushed from his body. The order
to fire had been given to the soldiers, and amidst the
thunder of the discharge, the volumes of smoke and

tongues of flame, a ball, irregularly aimed, had glanced
from the stone-work of the cloister, and struck him to
the ground. It was an accidentsuch an accident as
Providence usually employs in executing his justest
vengeance.
CHAPTER XXIV.
THREE weeks had passed from that fearful day. It was
midnight. And in that vaulted cell, stretched upon a bed
of torture, racked with his wound, pale, haggard, his beard
uncut, his hair matted, his eyes bloodshot, and full of a
malignant fire, while his lips quivered with fear at every
sound, the miserable Pearce was lying.
His senses
had now returned after a long delirium of fever, during
which he had made the hair of his attendants stand on
end, and many of them refuse to remain with him at
night, by the horrible phantasms and spectres which
haunted his maddened brain. He imagined himself
already in the place of torment; and even the water
with which they endeavored to assuage his burning thirst
seemed to him as molten lead, administered to him by the
hands of demons. Unable to be moved to prison, he had
been watched over by the inmates of the Priory with the
tenderest care. And by the skill of Cookesley himself
his life had been saved. But it had been wholly im-
possible to extract from him any information, or even to
question him on any thing, lest it might exasperate
or alarm him. Beattie and Villiers also had been
awakened to some suspicion that he was implicated not
only in the insurrectionary movements of the Forest, but
also, in some mysterious way, with the disappearance of
Villiers's child. But Villiers himself had received a
most serious wound, which confined him to his room.
The rioters had been driven off before they could effect
their purpose of setting fire to the Priory, especially to the
chapel, as Pearce had carefully suggested. Within the

chapel all had been gathered who could not jun in the
defence, and not a hair of their heads had been injured.
But Villiers himself, while in the act of levelling his
sabre upon the bare head of his young assailant, had
suddenly swooned with loss of blood, and had ever since
been lying under the same roof within a few yards of
that chamber of agony, in which the destroyer of his
peace and of his child, was suffering the tortures of the
damned.
Pearce had just awakened from a terrifying dream,
and, to his consternation, he found that the cell was in
darkness. Darkness to him was as a hell; and again
and again he had besought his nurse never to leave him ;
but now, during his sleep, she had been called away; and
after sitting up in dismay and terror, he sank back upon
his pillow, almost doubting where he was.
He was
endeavoring to stare through the darkness, and recognise
the place, when his eye was riveted by a sound, and by
the appearance of a slender thread of blue light on the
wall immediately facing him. It widened, became more
vivid, and, to his inexpressible horror, he saw the wall
itself open, and a bright light pour in through it, behind
which, almost senseless as he was with terror, he could
discern a dark, shapeless, shadowy figure, advancing to
him. He uttered a hideous shriek, and would have buried
himself in his bed-clothes; but the figure moved to his
side, and called him by his name. It was a voice which
he knew.
Silence," it said, or you will ruin all. What are
you afraid of? It is only I, O'Foggarty."
Pearce could not recover his breath. His heart beat
as if it would suffocate him, and his lips quivered so that
he could not articulate.
Why, I should never have thought," said his noc-
turnal visitant, "that you of all men were afraid of
ghosts." And he laughed scornfully.
"I have been ill," faltered Pearce. 6 But what du
you want? How did you get here?"
" You," answered the other"you of all men not to
know how I got here! You not to be acquainted with

all these old secret passages which have been useful to
you before this in some of your former proceedings, as
they will be useful to you now! Who are such proper
persons to know all the contrivances of these old places as
the persons to whom they once belonged, and to whom
they must belong again? I have only just got the clue
from abroad, and I have found you out without difficulty.
Do you remember that hollow in the rock, by the bank
of the brook, just by the great Wyche-elm, where the
thorn-bushes are so thick? There is a regular passage
cut under ground, from this room into the Villiers vault,
and through that out into the open air. Only you niusi
understand the springs, and how to move the stones in
the walls."
5. Then I can escape,
" cried Pearce, springing up in
the bed with recovered energy, and resuming all his rigor
of mind and at once ?"
" At once," said O'Foggarty. " Slip on your clothes,
take my arm; there is a horse waiting for you out by the
Prior's oak in the wood; and in two hours you will be in
the Forest, safe. And we shall be safe too ; for it would
not be very pleasant to have you in their handswith the
prospect of your telling all you know." And O'Foggarty's
sneer indicated how little confidence he reposed in the
honor of his confederate.
" And what of Villiers ?" asked Pearce, impatiently.
" Is he alive? They would tell me nothing ; and I have
told them nothing. Where is he? Has he found out
any thing? Did he and the wretch hesitated
" Was any one killed ?"!
O'Foggarty shrank back, as horror-struck. At last
he said, with a low voice, " You have had your revenge.
It is all over, but not with his sword."
Pearce sank back on his pillow, and gasped con.
vulsively.
" How was it?" he muttered. Tell me all. Let me
know all. Revenge is sweet. Tell it me all. I can
bear it. And yet I have lost what was mine-all but
mine. I should have had his
money."
" Jle is not dead yet," said O'Foggarty.  He dies

O'Foggarty's hand, who seemed afraid to move under
his grasp, so completely had Pearce obtained a fas-
cination over all who had once been brought under his
influence.
"I will," said O'Foggarty." But do not crush me so
hard; you will make the blood come."

" He was brought up for trial this day," said O'Fog-
garty. " I was in court at Broughton all the time. There
was no evidence scarcely against him. They did not
know where he came fromcould not identify him-did
not know his name scarcely, for he had been as silent as
you have been ever since he had been taken, and would
not utter a word He behaved like a man, nobly. Oh,

And O'Foggarty proceeded. "The judge talked of

be. And I do believe there were many in the court be.

Pearce. What a man he might have made !"

" I will," replied the other." But had you not bet-
ter keep quiet? Your nails have cut your hands."
"Go on," repeated Pearce.

And O'Foggarty proceeded. "We all thought he
was safe, when the Attorney-General, who was for the
prosecution, rose and said, that if the evidence was not
sufficient, they must then be under the painful necessity
of calling another witness, who had been interested in
the criminal, when a boy, from having saved his life in a
fire, and who had therefore entreated to be spared from
appearing if his evidence was not absolutely necessary."
" He did not know it all, then !" exclaimed Pearce,
impatiently. " How did he find out about the fire ?"
" The gaoler had learnt it," said O'Foggarty. " And
Villiers, though confined with his wound, had wanted to
see the poor fellow in prison ; but the poor

again repeated Pearce.  Why do not
you make haste ?"
" We all looked round," continued O'Foggarty, " and
saw the clerk administering the oath to Villiers himself,
who was sitting at the left hand of the judge, looking
pale as death from his wound. And, I do not know how
it was, he seemed to be shuddering all over, and looked
more like a spectre than a man, as if he had seen some.
thing."
" And did he give his evidence ?" cried Pearce.
"Yes," replied O'Foggarty, "quite distinctly. He
had seen the poor fellow cut down one of the yeomanry
with his own hand. And then he described how he had
been at the head of the mob in the cloister, and had at-
tacked Villiers himself. It was clear as day. The poor
fellow had no counsel ; and he refused to make any de.
fence. Only he said that he had been neglected from
his childhood-left without father or mother-and that
he had been doing rightly, fighting against the oppressors
of the poor, and the enemies of the faith. I saw Vil.
liers's face when he talked of being left without father
or mother. It was horrid to see it."
"Go on," repeated Pearce, exultingly.
" And then the judge summed up, and told the jury
that they could have no doubt that Villiers's evidence
must hang him--and that whatever might be done with

the others, here murder had been committed, and the
law must take its course."
66 Is that all ?" asked Pearce.
"I do not know any more," replied the other," for
there was a bustle in the court. Villiers had fallen
down, and they were taking him out. And I came off
as quick as possible, for it is full twenty miles from here
And I only had the letter to-day about the secret passage,
and orders to get you out without delay. And there is
no time to lose. Get up, and dress directly. Hark !
there is some one coming !"
And at that moment footsteps were heard approaching
along the cloister. And O'Foggarty, hastily closing his
dark lantern, paused, and then, as they came nearer, re-
treated hastily into the passage in the wall, turned the
huge stone softly in its pivot, and, with the clicking of a
spring, Pearce felt himself once more left in darkness.
But the door of his cell opened, and another light ap-
peared. It was Beattie.
No one knew what passed at that interview. The
deep-toned bell of the Priory told out one, two, three,
four, five, and Beattie did not come out of the cell; and
the relentless, remorseless, hardened wretch, even under
this last trial and attempt to soften him on the part of a
long-suffering Providence, counted the strokes with a
greedy ear, as if waiting for a certain time to elapse be.
fore he acted. And meanwhile he listened doggedly and
with a sullen triumph to Beattie, whose suspicions had
been roused by some communication with Cookesley, and
who now with entreaties, and now with solemn abjura.
tions, endeavored to ascertain if the dreadful surmise
which had flashed across his mind had any foundation.
Pearce relentlessly remained silent. He muttered to
himself"Twenty miles !-it must take at least two
hours. It will be all over at eight o'clock." And then
he looked at his watch.
At last, as it struck a quarter to six, the door of the
cell opened, and Beattie, horror-struck, but full of terrified
impatience, was rushing into the cloister. The voice of
the prisoner called him back. " Remember," he said,

"the terms. I will tell it to none but Villiers. He shall
conje here himself. He shall beseech me to do it. He
shall kneel down at my feet. I will put my heel upon
his accursed neck. He shall swear to me never to take
notice of what I tell him, so as to involve me in any
diffi-
culty. He shall sign a bond, here, upon the spot, to pay
me five thousand pounds, and then I will tell him where

" It shall be void," cried the other, with a hoarse
chuckle of exultation.

We will not pass again into that dark chamber with

nial set his foot upon his master's neck, and almost
spurned him; and Villiers bore it all. He remembered
the curse of undutifulness, to be made a servant of ser.
vants. He only looked up imploringly, for his heart was
nearly broken with a frightful apprehension of he knew
not what. He made the promise ; he signed the bond.
And when Pearce had snatched it ferociously from him,
he waited as one powerless, crushed, all but annihilated,
to hear the announcement so longed for, yet now so
dreaded.
Pearce looked once more at his watch, and at that
moment it struck six. " It is twenty miles," he said,
coolly, "is it not to Broughton? It will take you at least
two hours to get there, half-an-hour to start. Take it !"
he exclaimed, and he threw a packet of paper, tied and
sealed with black, into Villiers's hands. 66 Go to the
prison at Broughton ; you will find your son-on the
scaffold!"
They were the last words Pearce uttered in that cell.
Villiers had no sooner staggere 1 from the room than he

to escape.
inn-
Seven o'clock struck at the turnpike gate of St.
Colomb's, about fourteen miles from Broughton, as a
carriage and four drove at full gallop through itthe
horses dropping with sweat-the postillions whirling their
whips, and spurring them till the blood flowedthe ser-
vants behind standing up and waving their hats to warn
every thing in the way from obstructing the passage.
The blinds were drawn. At one point a trace broke,
and a face full of agony was thrust from the window,
ploring,-oh, with what anguishthat they should not
delay. It was Beattie. Another figure was in the
inside, kneeling on the bottom of the carriage, motionless
-speechless. Not twenty-four hours afterwards his
hair, which had been of a glossy black, had turned white
with the agony of those two hours. Beattie endeavor-
ed once to speak to him, to lift him up, to make him rest
his head in his own arms; but the look of piteous en-
treaty that he might be lefi to himself was so earnest, so
full of woe, that Beattie dared not repeat the effort.
There are states of mental torture when we dread even
a touch and movement as much as if the body wero all
one ulcer.
Eight o'clock struck as the carriage whirled round
the corner of the narrow street at the entrance into
Broughton. There was an enormous crowd. The pos-
tillions, ready to drop with exhaustion, were compelled to
walk their horses. In vain Beattie spoke from the win.
dows-entreatedbesought the people to make way.
They were laughing, shouting, hurrying forward in joyous
confusion to the market-place, where the prison stood, to
see an execution ; for to Englishmen an excution is a
spectacle as entertaining as a farce. Two men, contrived
to get, one on each side of the carriage. One was sing-
ing a vulgar ribald song about Ernest some-one--the
name could not be heardwho had killed a yeomanry
soldier. The other was crying his last dying speech and
confession, and thrust it into the windows, Villiers

looked up, and asked if to advance was impossible--if
they could not walk; but at that moment the great bell
of the prison began to tol', and he knew that it was too
late now to reach the spot before all would be over. Ile
rose up, seated himself in his seat, quietly drew down the
blind which Beattie had drawn up in the vain attempt to
urge the crowd to make way for the carriage, begged
Beattie to tell the postillions to take care not to drive over
any one, and, closing his eyes, composed himself to re.
signation. Beattie was astonished, and unable to account
for bis calmness, till he remembered David. It was the
tranquility, not of despair, but of certainty. Any state
was more endurable than doubt. Any dispensation of
Heaven, once sealed, was to be accepted with patience
and submission.
Beattie now ventured to propose that they should not
go at once to the prison, but to the house of the clergy-
man of the town, whom they both knew. But just then
there was a stir and movement in the crowd, which he
could not account for. He looked out.
The carriage
had reached the market-place. In front stood the dark,
gaunt, eyeless wall of the county prison, and over the
gateway was the gloomy erection, towards which Beattie
dared not look. The crowd seemed angry, disappointed;
they were separating, pushing away, with oaths and im.
precations, from the point of attraction. A sudden
movement of the carriage, as it became entangled among
the struggling and fighting mob, brought Beattie's eyes
unwillingly to the point which he had so dreaded facing;
but, to his surprise, the fearful object which he had ex-
pected to behold was not there. The bell had ceased to
toll; and yet the scaffold was unoccupied. Loud voices
began to be heard. "Is it a reprieve ?" asked a woman
close to the carriage-window.  No, I fancy not," was
the answer.
" Then, why do they not bring him out ?"
asked another. "Why do they keep us waiting here all
this blessed day ?" Beattie's heart beat till his breath
was nearly gone. A policeman was standing in the
crowd, who recognised the Villiers livery, and endeavored
to make way for the carriage. Beattie beckoned to him,

He scarcely dared to speak ; but the policeman recom.
mended that they should turn into a bye street. " The
people are coming away, sir," he said. 66 There is to be
no execution this morning."
" Is there a reprieve ?" cried Beattie.
"No, sir," answered the policemen, "not that ; but I
fancy something is the matter."
" Drive on, drive on," cried Beattie to the postillions,
"to the prison."
The crowd made way ; there was nothing any longer
to attract them. The carriage stopped. The line of
constables cleared a passage to the dark portal of the
prison ; the servants opened the door ; and the mob, with
that vulgar unfeeling curiosity which is characteristic of
England in the nineteenth century, pressed and jostled
forward to see what new shape of misery was approach
ing the place of punishment.
" Can you walk?" asked Beattie, tenderly; and tu
his surprise Villiers, as if nerved, and composed, rost
steadily, descended from the carriage, and, only clinging
twice to the iron railing of the stairs, followed one of the
jailers to the condemned cell. Beattie said a few words
to the chaplain, who was standing at the door ; the cell
was cleared of all but the physician, who was watching
the effect of some medicine on a livid corpse-like figure
which lay stretched upon the straw pallet, its face distort
ed with the effect of poison. Villiers knelt down by the
bed, took his son's hand in his ownhis cold, clammy
death-like handbowed his head upon it, but did not
weep. He was dreaming of another place-of a blue
sea, a seat scooped in the living rock, a trellised vine.
covered cottage. His mind seemed wandering. And
then there rose up before him a fair, pensive, exquisite-
ly beautiful face; and then it changed, as in his dreams
it often had changed, into that ghastly, awful face which
he had seen on his father's death-bed. It seemed strange,
but his heart felt light. Anything is better than doubt.
He had found his son,and his son was dead. All
seemed over.
But all was not over. Villiers started, almost in ter.

ror; for the hand which had lain dead and motionless in
his own stirred with a convulsive spasm. Beattie stooped
over the face. The physician held a glass to its lips ;
and then, with a look of hope and joy, he motioned to
Beattie to draw Villiers quietly from the room. He held
his finger to his mouth, to indicate the necessity of silence;
and Villiers, bewildered, unresisting, as one who had lost
all power of thought and action, suffered Beattje to lead
him away like a child.
An awful feeling thrilled through the hearts of
every inmate of the Priory, when, about ten days after-
wards, in the solemn service of the chapel, the prayers
of the congregation were desired for a person, within
their own walls, dangerously ill. No eye, but many
thoughts, were turned to Villiers himself, who kneeling

ed with suffering that his head lay like lead upon his
cushion, so altered with the agony which he had under-
gone that his dearest friend would not have known him-
moved, indeed, his lips to join the deep and fervent Amen
of the whole congregation, but could utter nothing. From
the chapel he passed to a chamber, where, recovered to
life and consciousness, but smitten with the slow and
lingering hand of death, lay his lost treasure-his par-
doned son.
The physicians had ordered that nothing
should be said or done which might disturb him ; and
Villiers therefore sat at a distance, out of sight, or knelt
behind the bed, only drawing the curtain aside when a
fitful sleep stole upon the fevered brow of his boy, and
he could gaze on that face, so beautiful, and now so easily
recognised, without being seel. Others often were
kneeling with him, and among them Bentley, himself in
sickness ; and from many a hean-as from many a lip,
morning and evening, in public and in private, prayers
rose within those holy walls that some token of good
might still be showed upon him who had showed, under
Heaven, so many such tokens to themselves.
And at
times even faint hopes sprang up that these prayers would
be answered by the 'estoration of the sick to health and

strength. His mind gradually returned. His vigor was
so far recovered that he was enabled to be removed into
the open air ; and, placed in a wheel-chair, his head
propped with pillows, he was drawn backwards and for-
wards along the broad terrace which ran in front of the
cloisters, while Villiers himself walked at his side, now
stopping to wipe the moisture from the pale forehead of
the sick youth, now arranging the pillows with a hand of
tenderness, and at times stooping over his face till he
almost touched it with his lips. And then he checked
himself, for still the physician forbade that anything should
be said or done to cause the least excitement. And mean-
while Earnest looked on wondering, but softened almost
to tears by the tenderness which watched over him. His
eye had lost its fierceness ; pain and suffering had oblit-
crated from his beautiful face all the harsher lines of in.
temperance. It seemed as if a noble spirit within him was
struggling to throw off a fearful and unnatural load of sin,
which some hand from without had cast upon a generous
nature. More than once he endeavored to speak-to
say something to Villiers which might show his gratitude.
More than once, with a feeble hand, he laid bare a scar
upon his breast, which had been there ever since the days
of his boyhoodever since Villiers had saved him from
the fire ; and pointing to it, he indicated that he knew
who it was that had then rescued him, and was now
tending him. And then he would take Villiers's hand,
and press it to his parched lips ; and while the tears
streamed from Villiers's face his own eyes were suffused
also. And once-oh, how Villiers's heart melted within
him at that act--when Villiers was taking leave of him
for the night, he made signs for him to kneel down by the
bed-side. And Villiers prayed for his son not yet wholly
lost. And he saw the lips of the sick moving at every
petition, and his eyes upturned to heaven. And when
Villiers rose from. his knees the youth raised his head
faintly from the pillow, and stretched out his hands to
embrace him, and whispered, " If God had given me such
a father, I should never have been what I am!"
The next day Beattie sat by his bed-side, and found

him able to bear conversation ; and the day after, as the
same hour approached, more than once Ernest inquired
when Mr. Beattie would come ; for the words which he
had heard had sunk into his heart, and he longed to hear
them again. And day after day it was still the same.
And as Villiers listened to the accounts which Beattie
gave him of these interviews, his eyes became blinded
with tears; but they were tears of gratitude and hope.
His son was a penitent.
Weeks passed, and though the Angel of Death still
hung over the bed of the sufferer, and the last hour was
only delayed, while the body was slowly breaking up,
the soul within seemed purifying itself, and strengthening,
and coming out, as the moon from a mass of clouds.
And after the terrible sharp agonies of remorse were
past, and some degree of calmness was restored, a change
came over the whole nature of that troubled spirit. It
became gentle, and humble, and tranquil; and at last
permission was given, and Villiers laid the head of his
sobbing boy upon his own breast, and whispered to him.
that he had a father upon earth as well as in Heaven.
And then there was a solemn, awful, but biessed rite
in that sick chamber. And then the room was closed
up-closed to all but one person, who passed the days
and the nights in prayer, kneeling by the lifeless form of
his lost yet recovered son. The day approached when
he was to part for ever with all that remained of bim
upon earth. The evening before, leaning on the arm of
Beattie, Villiers desired to see nimself the place where
those dear relics would be aeposited. The masons, who
were opening the vault, had not been warned of his
approach in time, and they were vainly endeavoring to
conceal from him some object of horror which they had
found on entering the catacomb. But Beattie caught
sight of it, and Villiers too. It was a body all but de-
voured by rats. A lantern, with the candle burnt out,
lay in one corner. All over the pavement were traces
of blood, as if the wretched man had Aed from place to
place before his ferocious assailants; and there were
inarks of bloody bands upon the walls, on one place

especially, where the stones were convulsively scribbled
over with gory fingers, and a spring was found within
the stone, but which had closed from the other side, and
could not be opened. The extremities were wholly gone.
The vitals must have been attacked last. A hat lay at
some distance from the body, and in it was a name; and
Villiers read it. It was the destroyer of his child.
**
"O Beattie ! " Villiers used to say, as, many years
after, evening after evening, accompanied by Bentley,
they paced together the cloisters of the Priory, calm and
sorrowing, yet not without gratitude and hope, for all the
manifold increasing blessings of that holy abode, " will
not the vengeance of Heaven, sooner or later, in some
frightful shape, fall upon those miserable men, who,
'inder the name and in the garb of religion, are rending
asunder, in this country, ties which God has joined, and
tearing the children of this empire from their Father in
the State and in the Church, as my child was torn from
me?"
