The place in which arose the most important
events of the tale we are about to relate, is
situated in Suffolk: it is one of those small but
neat villages, which so frequently present them-
selves to the eye of the traveller in the eastern
parts of this kingdom. Like most of the towns
in Suffolk and Essex, it has an air of rustic
antiquity about it, which produces pleasing as-
sociations of simplicity and peace in the mind of
a lover of the picturesque. The latticed windows

glistening beneath the brown thatchthe wal's

the honeysuckle and the climbing rose tree, wan-
dering over them in graceful clustersthe wicket
of short sticks--the little garden, and the bowering
branches,--are all calculated to produce pleasing
sepsations of tranquillity, repose, and comfort.
Long may the genius of modern improvement,
with its squares and parallelograms, and all its
other insipid and tasteless regularities, spare
these interesting relics of ancient English rural
simplicity, and not convert, as it bids fair to do
ai last, our entire island into a vast London with
its modern improvements! Our elegant edifices
of bricks and mortar-our regular and open
streetsour houses, like a company of soldiers,
all in uniform order, dressed in rank after one
model,- are, doubtless, very fine things in their
way, and very convenient; but they are not adapted
to please the imagination, nor to cheer the heart.
In utterly banishing country scenery, we deprive
ourselves of a source not only of pleasing images
to the mind, but also of the best moral affections.
In substituting art for nature, even in externals,
we ourselves insensibly become cold and artificial
beings. A great city-its' splendid buildings, ,
the abode of pride and of luxury, on the one
hand, and the striking contrast of its narrow
lanes, confined courts, and wretched hovels,
the refuge of profligacy, misery, and vice, on
the otheris not one of the best possible schools

of moral feeling, even in its exterior aspect: but
the countrythe view of nature-even in its least
pleasing forms, harmonizes the soul, and produces
a disposition to virtue.
" Can man refuse to join the general smile
Of nature? Can fierce passions vex his breast,
When every gale is peace, and every grove
Is melody goes
No! and it is therefore we find in general so
marked a contrast between the inhabitants of
towns, and those of the country, and so decided
a balance in the favour of the latter.
The village of Polstead, with its surrounding
scenery, is a sweet relief from the sameness of
the busy towns; a retired and delightful spot,
breathing the true freshness of rusticity. The
inhabitants are laborious, but there are no ves-
tiges of want about them : if money be scarce
among them, their necessities are but few; their
industry produces competence, and perhaps, in
possessing that, the inhabitants of Polstead may
account themselves truly rich.
The scenery all around bears the general cha-
racter of Suffolk scenery, and has few attractions
For those who make tours in search of the bola and
sublime. It has nothing of the gigantic features
of primitive nature, such as we behold it in the
northern parts of Scotland and Wales, or in the
Alpine regions of Switzerland-none of that diver-
sity, which ever and anon astonishes us by
some unexpected spectacle. The traveller is not

surprised and terrified by immense rocks, which
appear to hang in ruins over his head; nor inun-
dated by the sparkling mists which are scat-
tered from lofty and resounding waterfalls : not
suddenly stopped at the edge of a precipice, by
the view of an abyss formed by an everlasting
torrent below, on the depths of which he scarcely
dares to look down; nor does he suddenly
escape from such astounding scenes, to lose
himself in the obscurity of a tufted wood, or
the labyrinths of some verdant but uncultivated
wilderness, There is nothing of all this; but
there is what the lover of English scenery
would delight in :--the hill and vale, picturesquely
spread with fertile fields and luxuriant foliage
the rippling stream, by-road, and green lane
-the farm-house and the cottage--the pointed
spire, peering up from the thick bowers of beech
and elm--of flowing horse-chesnut, ] larch, and
sycamore;while the tinkling bell of the flocks,
the whistle of the passing peasant boy, and the
song of the lark above, shall there be found to
give life to the scene.
The village, when we saw it, contained about
twenty houses which clustered together on the
gentle slope of a hill, the top of which spread into a
pleasant green, on which was situated a neat public
house (the only one in the village); and here the
neighbours occasionally met at fair or dance,-the
old to chat of days gone by, the young for purposes
more congenial to their years. At the bottom of

the hill was a bright sheet of water, at one side of
which passed the road ; and rising from the other
side, the pathway to the village church and church
yard,the walls and grave-stones of which latter
mentioned, could be seen by the passenger through
wide-spreading and majestic trees : waving over
the water, were several willows; and the road,
winding out from a thick grove at one side, passed
down into a hollow covered with branches, and
at the depth of which were to be seen two or
three cottages, from which ascended their chimney-
smoke to be lost in the clear air.
The cottage in which dwelt the heroine of ou:
story, was situated about a quarter of a mile from
the church of Polstead, on the side of a by-road
which diverged from the foot of the village: a
small low wicket shut it out from the pathway,
over which could be seen a green plat before the
door, where the inmates of the dwelling occa-
sionally reclined. The roof was thatched; and
beneath the eaves, above the door, hung a long
ladder, partly covered by the branches of climbing
rose-trees which clung to the wall; the gable end
half fronted the road, and displayed a neat latticed
window which looked out over a garden, hedged
in, and bearing several well-grown apple-trees.
A number of tall elms stood at the front
of the cottage, and a vegetable garden (also in
front) ran alongside the road about a dozen
perches.
The inside of this cottage corresponded with the

outside. There were but four smal rooms,-a
parlour, a kitchen, and two bed-rooms. The
parlour exhibited "the nicely sanded floor." the
polished oak table and white deal chairs, and the
few engravings on the walls from biblical subjects,
more remarkable for their antiquity than the excel-
lence of their execution. On the table was the
family library, consisting of a large Bible and
Prayer-book, an old book of cookery, and "The
CHILDREN OF THE ABBEY," which appeared to
have felt a few thumbs in the course of its
existence: in the kitchen, there was the well-
scrubbed dresser, and the usual set out of shining
pots and pans. You could see, from the out-
side, the neat white curtains of the bed-room
windows; a honeysuckle growing up on the
outside of one, which diffused its perfume into
the apartment, and a white rose tree on that
of the other.
This cottage had been, for more than twenty
years, the peaceful abode of John Martin and his
wife Mary. John was not much above the situa-
tion of a labouring peasant, but, by his industry
and frugality, had contrived to keep himself in a
state considerably above want. He lived by the
labour of his hands, and was in the employ of a
neighbouring farmer. He turned the little pro-
duce of his garden and his poultry yard to some
advantage; and he could say,what many who
cut a more splendid figure on the theatre of life
cannot affirm with truth,--that, though poor, le

was out of debt, and independent. His wife was
like himself, simple, industrious, and faithful:
neither had any ambition beyond their humble
lot; and, without having ever heard the name of
philosophy, they were more contented than phi-
losophers, and far happier than kings. While
John attended his business abroad, his wife
took care of the household at home. They rose
at the first dawn of morning cheerfully to their
respective labours; and lay down at night to that
undisturbed repose, which exercise, temperance,
and innocence invariably ensure.
John and his wife were blessed with an only
daughter, who seemed, in all respects, calculated
to complete their happinessif, indeed, any state
of life, however humble, can ensure this fleeting
blessing. At the period when our story com-
mences, Maria Martin had just entered her
eighteenth year: she was rather under the middle
stature of woman, but her figure was symmetry
itself. Her features would, perhaps, by a con-
noisseur, be pronounced not strictly regular; but
their amiable expression, added to a blooming
complexion, a pair of brilliant sparkling eyes, and
a profusion of shining brown tresses, constituted
her a perfect village beauty: indeed, we may say
that they would have constituted her a very attrac-
tive beauty in any sphere of life. Maria's educa-
tion was rather superior to that of girls of her class
in general; for the father, who was dotingly fond
of her, had pinched his means very considerably,

to keep her for a few years at a genteel school.
We do not mean to say that her accomplish-
ments were of a very high order, or that she
could have acquired any such at the seminary
in question : they were limited to the usual
smattering acquirements of such sources of educa-
tion. She gained, indeed, a very decided taste
for the perusal of novels and romances,"one of
the few branches of female education, that is
generally most completely and successfully com-
municated, and most frequently kept up when
every other thing is neglected.
Maria's disposition was kind, but volatile; she
had all the gaiety and thoughtlessness that belong
to youth and innocence; all her feelings and pro-
pensities were on the side of virtue, by nature
rather than by precept,she was virtuously in-
clined, from good taste and an utter ignorance of
vice. Though lively and thoughtless, she was
devotedly affectionate to her parents, and kind and
compassionate to all. The appearance of distress
would quickly melt her into tears, though her face,
the instant before, had been lighted up with smiles.
The effect, however, was evanescent; and, like
as in an April day, the sunshine rapidly suc-
ceeded to the shower.
Of love, Maria had read much, but knew
nothing. There lived, in her neighbourhood, a
young man, the son of a small farmer, who, for
some vears, had cherished a most pure and de-
voted affection for her. They had known each

other from children, Harry Everton (this was
the
young man's name) having been a constant in-
mate at her father's from a boy. Harry was now
turned of twenty years of age; his person was
good; his physiognomy agreeable; and though,
of course, he had no pretensions to superior
refinement, his manners were neither vulgar,
nor his mind wholy uninformed His demeanour
was mild, modest, and sensible; and his under-
standing was extremely good: but what parti-
cularly distinguished Harry, was the amiable
susceptibility of his heart, and the singleness and
sincerity of all his feelings. He nursed in secret
the most fervent attatchment to Maria; yet was
he too diffident of his own merits to declare him-
self openly as her lover; but it appeared in his
y look and action. The tone of his voice when
he addressed her, the expression of his coun-
tenance, his very gesture, were intelligible enough
to all observers, except the object of his passion:
she, indeed, treated Harry with all the familiarity
of old acquaintance, and the affection of friend-
ship;she looked on him more in the light of a
brother than anything else, and never dreamed
for an instant that they could stand in any dearer
relation to each other. Their dispositions, too,
were very different: Harry was serious and
thoughtful; Maria, at this time, lively, fickle, and
inconsiderate. She was fond of occasionally teas-
ing his good nature in an innocent way, and of
apparently undervaluing his best intentions :-her

volatile nature seemed incapable of feeling or
understanding the passion of love. Harry had
too much discrimination not to perceive the little
impression he had made upon her heart, and too
much sensibility not very severely to feel it: but
he trusted his hopes to time and assiduity, and
consoled himself with the idea that, if she did not
love him, she loved nobody else; and that, at all
events, her feelings towards him were favourable,
though not precisely of the kind that he could
have wished.
Indeed, the fact was, that Maria loved Harry
better than any oneher parents excepted : his
company was always agreeable to her. Her father
was fond of Harry's society, and liked to have
him as an evening guest at his cottage. He
generally used to spend his winter nights there,
and amuse the old folks by reading to them some
interesting story or other; for Harry, though very
plainly educated, was fond of reading, and did
not read badly. Maria generally felt a sort of
blank when Harry did not make one of their
fire-side party: and in the summer, he usually ac-
companied her in her walks; when they par-
took together of such rural amusements
birds'-nesting, nutting, strawberry-gathering, &c.
Though Harry, as I have said, made no formal
declaration of his love, nor any proposal to her
father, yet the neighbours were generally of
opinion that it would be a match; and the young
people were said, in the phrase usual in such
as

THE RED BARN.
11
classes, to keep each other company. The old
folks, too, looked on this with a favourable eye;
so Harry was, in all respects, a very suitable
person for a husband to their daughter. His
father was comparatively well to do in the world;
as he farmed, at a moderate rent, about thirty acres
of very productive land; and was generally con-
sidered, from his skill and industry, to have saved
some money. Harry was his only son, under-
stood the farming business well, and would, no
doubt, succeed his father in all his possessions :
they, therefore, encouraged his attentions to Maria;
indeed, the mother sometimes evinced a little
impatience on this score, and would say to her
husband, "I wish, Jack, that Harry Everton would
ask our Maria in marriage; why don't you speak
to him about it?" But her husband, who had good
sense and a little pride, would say, "My dear,
let the young folks alone; all in good time; they
are going on very well:when Harry has made
up his mind, and knows Maria's, he will not be
backward I dare say; but it is not my place to
speak first."
Matters were in this sort of train, when an
incident took place, apparently trifling, but which
exercised a decided influence on the destiny of
Maria, and determined in some measure the colour
of her future life. She was sitting, on a fine day
in Midsummer, at the cottage door, employed
in needlework, when a woman of a very peculiar
appearance, rather meanly but singularly dressed,

entered the yard: she might have been about
seven or eight and twenty years of age; her com--
plexion and eyes were very dark; her features
regular, handsome, and slightly prominent: $he
was above the middle size; her figure very good,
and rather inclining to fullness. She wore i
brown stuff gown, which, though of coarse mate-
rials, was made and put on with an evident atten-
tion to setting off the fine contour of her waist and
bosom. A very short, old, black silk mantle was
carelessly tied round her neck, and hung over
one shoulder. Round her head was bound a
red cotton handkerchief, not ungracefully, which
suffered some tresses of her raven hair to escape
on each side. The shortness of her petticoats dis-
played a well turned leg and ankle, and her small
foot was set off by a shoe with a very low instep.
Her arms, which were quite bare from the
elbow, though not very wbite, were beautifully
rounded; and her fingers were covered with
brass rings.
"Fair maid," said she, accosting Maria with
a peculiarly expressive smile, "I am dying of
thirst; may I beg a little water?"
Her voice, as she spoke, Maria thought, was the
softest and most musical she had ever heard ; yet
there was an expression in her dark eye, that har-
monized but little with the softness of her voice and
sweetness of her smile: it was a look of the most
searching penetration-of the most painfulscrutiny,
not unmingled with the appearance of design.

There is something in the expression of the
human countenance that strikes the simplest
persons: children, and even animals, are physiog-
nomists in this way. Maria seemed evidently
struck with the glance we have described, and
looked for a moment at the woman without
replying: the latter, perceiving this, instantly
changed the expression of her looks, and, with
an air of simplicity and languor, resumed, "I
have walked twenty miles to-day, in the hot sun
-I am very tired and thirsty ;-do, my dear
child, let me have a little water."
Maria, whose feelings of compassion were easily
excited, sprang up, and saying, "Sit down on
this bench-you shall have somethir.g better than
water," ran into the house, and fetched out a large
bowl of milk and some nice home-baked bread.
"Come," said she, "I give you the best we have
got at present. My father is abroad at work; and
my mother is gone to Polstead, and has taken
her keys, or I should have given you some cold
meat."
"Heaven bless you" replied the woman, "I
desire nothing better than this."
Having refreshed herself, she continued ;-
"Pray, my dear," said she, "were you' born
here?"
Maria answered in the affirmative.
"I wonder at that!" replied the woman; "And
brought up here always?"
"Yes," said Maria; "with the exception of

two years that I was at school in Colchester:
-but why do you
ask?"
"Because," said the woman, "you neither look
nor speak like one bred in the country: I should
have thought you had been, at least, educated in
London."
"I never was there in my life," said Maria.
"More is the pity; but all in good time:-you
were never formed to pass your life in an obscure
spot like this. You have only to be seen, to be
admired and loved. Oh! there's many a gentle-
man, who holds his head high enough, that would
be glad to throw himself at your feet."
Maria, to whom, from her experience in novels,
this sort of language was by no means unintel-
ligible, and whose vanity began to be tickled,
replied, laughing, "Oh, you flatter; I am nothing
but a simple country girl: no gentleman would
think of me."
The other, assuming a more serious look and
tone of voice, said, "You mistake; I can see
more in you, than you can see in yourself: I can
tell you that there are many gentlemen would be
proud to have you for a wife. I can tell you, too,
that the time is not far distant, when you
shall
remember the words of Hannah Woods.
"Good God !" exclaimed Maria, "how can
you tell all this?"
"My dear," returned the siren, "I shall be plain
with you; you have treated me with kindness, and
I shall make you a return. Don't think it is not

in my power: look at me; I am poor, ill-dressed,
and a woman; but I have a gift that riches cannot
buy. I can see into the future; and, if you will,
I can teach you your destiny."
Maria, like other girls, had heard and read a
great deal about fortune-tellers, and fully believed
in their skill: but to see one face to face was
a novelty, and inspired her with some degree
of fear. She looked undetermined, and was
silent.
"You will not, then, accept my offer," rejoined
the Sybil, with one of her enchanting smiles; "it
is disinterested, and I have nothing but good to
tell you."
Curiosity, and an undefinable mixture of vanity,
ambition, and hope, prevailed over her appre-
hension; and Maria assented.
"Are you certain," said the fortune-teller,
lowering her voice, " that we are alone? Is no
one within hearing ?"
"None," replied Maria.
" Then show me your hand," said the woman :
" by your face I already know much; but I must
see your hand."Maria did so.
What a delicate hand !" exclaimed the pro-
phetess; " this hand was never made to be given to
a peasant or a clown.--Ah! I thought so ;-here are
the lines of fortunate marriage, riches, children,
and long lifeno, not very long,but long
enough" She paused.
"But," said Maria, whose curiosity began to

be thoroughly whetted, "can you tell me nothing
more particular?"
"Yes :-beneath this pretty breast you shall
wear a gold watch; these white fingers shall be
covered with rich rings; and this fine hair be
braided with brilliants."
But," said Maria, "may I not know the name,
or at least the condition, of my future lover ?"
"Ah!" said the fortune-teller, with a smile full
of meaning," how curious you are grown all of
a sudden:-at first you hesitated to hear me at
all; now you want to know everything. Well!
I can tell you more; but your own hand is not
sufficient; mine must be crossed with a piece of
silver:this is a form we cannot dispense with."
Maria immediately performed this operation,
and the other continued ;
"Now I can tell you all I know:-in a word,
vour future husband is young, handsome, and rich.
Moreover, you shall see him at the fair of Polstead
next week. Be sure to go there. He will be
mounted on a grey horse, and wear a white hat;
you will know him directlythere will be none
like him at the fair. He will take a proper opportu-
nity of speaking to you-don't treat him with shy-
ness, or refuse to hear him: mark
my
fortune depends upon it-you were born for great
things, and you must act accordingly. Farewell :
-remember the fair;-above all, be secret."
So saying, she arose, waved her hand to Maria,
and was out of sight in an instant.

It is easy to conceive the nature of the im-
pression produced on Maria's mind by the
interview described in the last chapter. Young,
simple, and of course totally ignorant of the
world-her head filled with the marvellous tales
of novels and romances, where girls of low
degree, by the power of their personal charns,
become the wives of men of rank and fortune
and quite vain enough to suppose her own fully
adequate to any conquest of the kind,-she could
think of nothing but the prediction of the fortune-
teller, in whose prophetic power she implicitly
believed.
"So, then," said she to herself, "I am really
to be a lady after all;how delightful! How
elegantly I shall dress! and go to balls and parties
of all kinds. Well! I have often read of these

things, and wished to see them and be among
them :--I can dance pretty well; but then, when
I have plenty of money, I can learn to dance in
the best style. Well! I wonder what kind of
man he is :but she says, young and handsome.
I forgot to ask whether 'ne was dark or fair ;-)
hope he is darkI like dark men ;-I hope he is
not short:but he is rich and a gentlemanthat's
good. After all, perhaps, he may not like me."
(On this she goes to the glass, to adjust her curls.)
"Well! I wish the fair was come-I wish it was
over. I am half afraid to go:then to speak to a
strange gentleman! Lord, I cannot do it ;-but
then I must-it is my fortune. After all, if I
should not see him!but he is sure to be there:
---well! my heart beats at the thoughts of it."
Thus she ran on in her girlish way, agitated by
fear, hope, and anxiety ;-at one time building
castles in the air, and painting scenes of future
splendour and felicity,at another, affected by
misgivings that all was not right, that she might
be acting wrong in going to the fair, and that the
consequences might be unfortunate. Ill-fated
girl! could she have really looked into the future,
she would have seen it in far gloomier colours
than the worst apprehensions of her fancy were at
this time capable of pourtraying!
The return of her father and mother was not
calculated to allay her anxious feelings. This
was the first time in her life that she felt that she
had any secret to keep from them : ner nature

fore, sat ill upon her: she felt that she could not
reveal this affair to her parentsshe had a dis-
tracted, absent airshe answered questions that
were put to her, quite at random-did several of
the simplest things quite wrongly-when sentout of
the room for something, forgot what it was, and
returned without it-laughed immoderately with-
out any apparent cause, and when asked the
reason, felt ready to cry, she knew not wherefore.
Strange to say, all this excited no suspicion in
the minds of the good old folks. Quickness of
perception is not the forte of the English peasant
He must be told everything broadly and roundly
or he will not understand it.
Hints and symp
toms are quite thrown away upon him. To be sure,
we must remark, that whims and inconsistencies
of manner were by no means uncommon with
Maria. The old people were accustomed to this,
and notwithstanding the extreme of the present
case, they did not set it down as anything very
extraordinary
But there was another person to be a witness
of the conduct of Maria, who was a little more
discriminating. Harry Everton soon made his
appearance, to pay his usual evening visit; and the
eye of a lover was too penetrating, not to see at
once the alteration in the manners of Maria.  We
have already said, that Maria always regarded
Harry, as far as love was concerned, with indiffer-

ence.
But the moment she saw him now, some-
thing like a feeling of aversion, almost uncon-
sciously to herself, sprung up in her mind. If she
had ever suspected before that Harry loved her,
she never gave the thought any serious entertain-
ment. But now it suggested itself to her mind,
and produced nothing but a feeling very closely
allied to disgust. For the first time in her life, she
regarded his company as a disagreeable intrusion.
" It is a fine evening, Maria," said Harry, as he
entered the cottage; "are you inclined for a walk?"
"No! Harry," said she; "I am tired."
"Oh, then you have been out to-day!"
"No! I have not."
" How, then, can you be tired ?"
Whyl can't a person be tired without walking
out? I tell
you
I am tired, that's enough."
"There's Sally Hodgson and her brother, and
Tom Morgan and his two sisters, gone a nutting
this evening in Squire Colson's wood; I thought
you might like to go too.
No! I don't like it; I don't like nutting.
"Oh! Maria, how can you say that ? you

"Maria," said her father, interposing," this
is all nonsense :-I say, Harry, finish that story
you began last night; I like to hear you."
Harry began reading, and Maria got up and left
the room.
Her mother followed, and pressed her
to return; but she pretended illness, and went to
bed. The youth soon took his leave, in a state o.
the greatest dejection.
As he went home he was puzzling himself to
think what could be the reason of Maria's very
altered manner. "It is not illness," said he;" for
she was looking as well as usual." His mind was
filled with a thousand vague fears, jealousies, and
suspicions. His way lay through a lonely and
woody valley, beyond which was his father's
farm. On entering this he began again to soli-

The last word "never !" was immediately re-
peated in a deep and hollow tone. Harry started
with momentary astonishment, and for an instant,
-so absorbed had been all his faculties,--forgot
that the place in which he stood was distinguished
by a very remarkable echo. But in the mood in
which he then was, this trifling incident heightened
his melancholy. "Ah !" said he again, "it is too

true; the Echo is a true prophet: she will never
be mine, never !" and again the word "never"
reverberated, in the same mournful tone in which
it was spoken, through the lonely vale.
Very different reflections occupied the mind of
Maria that night, and very different feelings
agitated her bosom. Whatever scruples sh
might at first have felt about what she intendea
to do, were soon silenced by her vanity and the
liveliness of her fancy, which dressed up the
future in such brilliant colours. She remained
awake the whole night, planning how she should
go to the fair, and what preparations she should
make for it. She was determined, if possible, to
go alone; for if Harry or her father should accom-
pany her, she was afraid it might be an obstacle
to the expected interview. As to Harry, she
knew the sensibility of his character; and she
resolved, before the fair day, to give him some
decided cause of offenceto hurt his feelings in
such a manner, as to put his accompanying her
totally out of the question. As to her father, it
was possible that something might prevent him
from going; and her mother, she knew, had no
desire to go to such places. After much reflec-
tion she formed her plan. There was a rela-
tive of her father's, a widow, who resided in
Polstead : this woman had an only daughter, some
years older than Maria. To them she determined
to go the evening previous to the fair, and pass
the night with them: even if her father should go

to Polstead next day, there might be many, means
of easily eluding his vigilance. The art of de-
ceiving is soon learned by the female mind, the
instant it recedes a single step from the path
of virtue.
Having thus settled in her own mind what
to do, she at last fell asleep. But her sleep
was short and unrefreshing, and disturbed by
dreams of all that had passed on the preceding
day, and all the gaudy images of the future,
floating in fantastic colours before her heated
imagination.
Notwithstanding the reception of the night
before, Harry ventured to make his appearance
at the cottage the following day. He had also
passed a sleepless night; and in the course of his
reflections on his intercourse with Maria, found
reason to blame himself for over diffidence in not
having fully declared to her his real sentiments.
Notwithstanding his first depression of mind, at
her strange conduct the last evening, he began to
think that his fears and suspicions might be
without foundation.
True love, indeed, consists almost in a continual
transition from fear to hope, and from hope to
fear. Its very essence seems to be this perpetual
mutability. When hope is swallowed up in enjoy-
ment and confidence, love soon subsides into a
tender voluptuous friendship. When hope is
utterly cut off, and the worst fears are realized,
bove turns to hate, to indifference, or to profound

individual. Harry, however, had not ceased to
"lay the flattering unction to his soul," that he
might yet win the heart of Maria.
struggles with his own diffidence, he came on
that day, determined to take an opportunity of
declaring to her his affection, and hearing his fate
from her own lips. Yet, as he approached the
cottage, he trembled in every limb with apprehen-
sion. "I am going," thought he, "perhaps, to
lose her for ever;" and the ominous echo of the
valley again resounded in his "fancy's listening
ear." But he felt that he could no longer endure
the torment of suspense ; and he "screwed his
courage to the sticking place," and determined
to know the worst.
When he entered, Maria was alone; she was
sitting at a table, with her head reclined on her
hand, and apparently in very deep thought. She
started on the entrance of Harry, and regarded
him with a look of displeasure which cut him to the
very heart. She replied coldly to his salutation. ,
He attempted to begin a conversation ; but she
gave him nothing but short, indifferent answers,
and then relapsed into silence. Harry at last
said, "My dear Maria, what is the matter? are
you unwell ?"
"No!" she replied; "I am very well."
"Have I done anything to offend you, Maria ?"
"No! nothing."
Then do tell me what is the matter 1

" Harry, you are very dull and teazing; I wish
you would leave me."
"Maria! I have come here to-day-" Harry
paused, and found he could not go on. She took
up his last words.
"Well ! I know you have ; and I'd as lief you
had stayed away."
Harry looked steadfastly at her. "Then my
company is disagreeable to you, Maria ?"
"All company is disagreeable to me at present :
I wish you would leave me to myself."
Maria," resumed Harry, with a firmer tone,
"I can bear this no longer-I will not bear it."
"Maria looked at him with all the air of the
heroine of a novel, and said"And pray, Mr.
Everton, who wants you to bear it? It is your
own fault if you will stay to hear what is unplea-
sant. You may go, if you please."
"I will not go, Maria," said Harry, "until-
"Oh, very well, as you please ; but if you
do
not go, I will;"so saying she arose, went into
her chamber, and locked the door, leaving Harry
in a state more easily conceived than described.
He left the house utterly bereft of hope; and
when he gained the neighbouring wood, being
quite unable to controul his feelings, he burst
into a flood of tears. Pride, however, soon came
to his assistance: he saw too plainly that Maria
not only did not love him, but disliked him; and
he felt almost convinced that the true cause was
her prepossession for another. He therefore

determined (until he ascertained whether this
was the fact or not) to absent himself from her
father's house.
Having thus disposed of Harry, Maria repaired
to her relation's house at Polstead. She soon
settled with her cousin that she should come
there the evening before the fair, and spend the
following day. On her return, she easily prevailed
on her parents to consent to this arrangement,
and learned, with no small pleasure, that her
father would be unavoidably engaged at the
farmer's who employed him, on the fair day. The
farmer himself was to be there, and would trust
nobody but old Martin to superintend his work-
men in his absence.
The eve of that important day at last arrived.
Maria chose out one of her prettiest dresses,
which she carried in a bundle, and with a heart
beating high with hope and anxiety, tripped off
to her cousin's; yet, when she took leave of her
parents, she felt a return of her misgivings, and
when her mother kissed her, and said,
bless you, my child, and keep you from all harm!"
the tears started into her eyes.

It may be well imagined by the reader, that
the night previous to the fair was one of no small
anxiety and agitation to Maria. She retired early
to bed, but not tr rest. The first half of the
night was passed in all those varying sensations
and ideas which had occupied her ever since her
interview with the fortune-teller. Her mind was
cast, as it were, upon a sea of doubt, uncertainty,
and confusion. Now elevated by hope, now
depressed by fear; passing with the rapidity of
lightning, from one image to another of an oppo-
site character;sometimes dwelling on bright
prospects of elegance, luxury, and splendour-
sometimes filled with undefined apprehensions of
disappointment and even misery; again thinking
of the affliction of her parents should she make
a false step, and reverting, not without some

compunctious visitings, to her treatment of Harry,
and his probable melancholy, dejection, and
despair.
But she had undergone so much mental exhaus-
tion, that tired nature at last claimed its
prero-
gative, and slumber sealed her eyelids. The
same images, however, which had occupied
her while waking, continued, in sleep, to dance
before her perturbed imagination. Her dreams,
made up chiefly of her waking ideas, had, with
all the fantastic inconsistency and sudden and
improbable transitions peculiar to dreaming,
something like a method and a meaning which
rendered them remarkable.
She at first imagined herself sitting alone under
a venerable oak, which protected her from the
strong sun above : there was a green space around
her, in which a snow white lamb was sporting,
and the birds were singing sweetly on all the
neighbouring branches: the sky above was of
the deepest blue, and the sun in its meridian splen-
dour. On a sudden appeared the fortune-teller,
who instantly seized the lamb, and strangled it.
The sky became immediately overcast, there
was a violent thunder-storm, and the rain fell in
torrents,-from which she was protected by the
close and massy branches of the oak. The fortune-
teller then, without saying a word, beckoned
her to follow her. She obeyed: she trembled,-
but they traversed several green fields together,
and at last arrived, through an avenue of trees, at

a splendid mansion. They entered an apartment
elegantly furnished, where there was a table
spread with the choicest viands and the richest
wines: a very handsome man was seated at the
head of it, who, as she entered, arose from his
seatapproached herand, having informed her
that he had been long expecting her presence,
he took her by the hand and placed her beside
him. He had scarcely done so, when a cry of
fire was heard, and the entire mansion was enve-
loped in flames,
Againshe dreamed that she was sitting with
the very same person in a green arbour, and that
he was making love to herthat Harry suddenly
appeared, pale and agitated, and said in a hollow
voice, " Maria, if you remain here another instant,
you are lost!" She paid no attention to him : her
companion and the arbour appeared at once to
vanish, and she found herself stretched on a pallet
of straw, in a wretched hovel, and a strange man
standing over her with a naked sword.Her last
dream transported her, in fancy, to a long and
barren strand. There she saw standing in line, at
equal distances, the fortune-teller, her companion
in the mansion and arbour, and the ruffian of the
hovel with the naked sword, while Harry stood at
some little distance to the left. She thought the
two first beckoned her to approach them, while
Harry called out loudly on her to desist. But the
man with the sword exclaimed "Let her do what
she will, she must be mine at last." Even in the

in all ages.
very instant of speaking, she thought he was
changed into a skeleton, and exactly presented ,
the imaginary figure of death. With the horror
of this impression she awoke, as the first faint
rays of morning began to gleam.
Maria was far from recovering immediately from
the effect produced by those fearful dreams.
She was not altogether untinctured with what
some would call a feeling of superstition respect-
ing dreams. But, indeed, she might have stood
excused in this, if excuse were necessary, by the
example of many of the wisest and best men
There is no absurdity in sup-
posing that some dreams may be prognostic,
though all are not. There is no absurdity in
supposing that a dream, like other second causes,
may become an instrument in the hands of a super-
intending Providence. "Dreams," says a cele-
brated writer, "are liars which yet sometimes tell
the truth."
Be this, however, as it may, Maria's dreams
were certainly not of the most favourable com-
plexion. They all ended unhappily, and seemed
obscurely to forbode misfortune: they brought
back a return of her misgivings and apprehen-
sions. She began to suspect that she was on the
brink of a precipice, and half hesitated to proceed;
but the predictions of the fortune-teller recurred
to her mind, and, aided by her own youthful hopes
and natural sanguineness of character, soon
banished her doubts and vacillations. She arose

THE RED BARN.
31
determined to obey what she considered as the
voice of destiny, and what was certainly most
consonant with her inclinations.
It may well be supposed that Maria took no
small pains in setting off her person to the best
advantage on this occasion. She dressed herself,
however, with great taste and simplicity. She
was in white. Her beautiful waist was bound
with a green sash, and her new Leghorn hat
was decked with ribbons of the same colour.
Her lovely brown hair hung in clustering curls on
each side of her face, and her naturally fine com-
plexion was heightened, by the vivacity of her feel-
ings, to a bloom that art in vain would imitate.
She did not go out in the earlier bustle of the
fair, but sat for some hours in the window,
watching with intense anxiety all the passers by.
But she looked for a long time in vain ;-many a
rustic and clumsy figure passed, appropriately
mounted, but in none of them could she discern
the slightest approximation to the hero of her
fancy. At last a figure appears, the sight of
which instantly struck her with the most trem-
bling agitation from head to foot. She beheld at
some distance a grey horse and a white hat! the
person thus mounted was riding very leisurely
up, talking to a man who was walking by the side
of his horse. As he approached nearer she had
a more distinct view of him. He was a very hand-
some man, about thirty years of age, well made,

32
THE RED BARN.
and of middle size. He was, properly speaking, ,
neither dark nor fair, though more inclining to
the former than the latter. He was very elegantly
dressed, in the best style of costume usual with
country gentlemen. He sat his horse, which
was a fine spirited looking creature, very grace-
fully, in a style something between the jockey and
military seat, but with an ease and firmness that
announced a man well accustomed to the field.
As he came up towards the window where Maria
was sitting, he stopped to say something to his
attendant, who then walked forward rather
quickly, and as he wheeled round for the purpose
of returning, he looked at the window, and had a
full view of Maria. He instantly halted point
blank, seemed for a moment lost in admiration,
and then, giving her a graceful and respectful
salute, passed on-not, however, without looking
back several times.
It would be quite superfluous to describe
Maria's feelings now. If ever any doubts had
remained upon her simple mind respecting the
truth of the fortune-teller, the appearance of
this gentleman completely dissipated them. She
had, however, but little time for the present to
indulge in reflection, as she was summoned to
dinner by her cousin.
To dinner she went, with what appetite I leave
the reader to imagine. Soon after, she and
Elien Mayberry (that was the name of her

cousin), walked out to see the fair, not without
some little additional attention to the duties of
the toilet.
They were roaming about, amused (one of
them at least) by the different objects which
presented themselves, without anything more
remarkably occurring than the passing saluta-
tions of some of the young sparks at the fair,
with all that freedom of manner which belongs
to the country. Maria was thinking of nothing
but the gentleman with the white hat, whom
she expected every instant to 'meet; but she was
very careful not to make her cousin a participator
of her thoughts.
She could not discern her hero anywhere for
some time, and began to fear that, perhaps, he
had left the fair ; and that she, therefore, should
not see him. However, she was soon re-assured
by his appearance: he was on foot, and accom-
panied by the same person whom she had seen
with him before. This was a young man about
two or three and twenty years of age, of short
person, respectably dressed; and though evidently
not a gentleman, yet in his appearance above
the lowest order. On seeing the girls, they
approached, and Maria's little heart began to
flutter rapidly. The gentlemen accosted them,
and after some complimentary nothings in the
usual common-place way, to which Maria was
too agitated to make any coherent reply, proposed
to them to quit the fair, and walk into a more

retired place. This offer, after some little bashful
hesitation, which, on the cousin's part, was merely
affected, was assented to; and they walked for-
ward through the fields. The gentleman paid the
most particular attention to Maria, whispering
soft nonsense in her ear, while his companion
who seemed a young man of no common shrewd-
ness, was entertaining her cousin very much to
her satisfaction. While Maria's lover (for so we
must call him now) placed her arm gently within
hs, and engaged her very deeply in conversation,
the young man, his companion, drew off her
cousin in rather a different direction. When they
were quite out of hearing, Maria was thus ad.
dressed by her companion :-
"You say you cannot believe that I love you,
how can you think so ?"
"Because our acquaintance is too short; you
have never seen me before this day."
"Oh! charming Maria, you mistake ;--to see
you
for a moment, is to love you. Years, months,
or even days, are not necessary to the growth of
true love: but, if they were, Maria, this is not
the first time I have seen you, though it is the
nrst time that you have seen me.
I have loved
you for many months past, but have had no
opportunity of declaring it until now.'
"Ah," said Maria, "but our stations in life are
so different;-a gentleman like you
"Oh!" interrupted he, "do not speak of that
love knows no such distinctions. In short, Maria

I love youdearly love you: I am ready to devote
myself, my life, my fortune, to you-only say
that you will be mine."
Maria, who, with all her simplicity, had a suffi-
cient share of the coquetry of her sex, did not
choose to give too easy an assent even to proposals
which she deemed honourable, replied-
"I don't know what to say,-I have known
you so little, I have only just seen you: a little
time
"Oh! Maria," said he, "what have lovers to
do with time, except to improve it? I could
not love you better, if I had known you for
years."
"Perhaps not," said Maria; "but you may
love me worse, when you have known me for a
time. Gentlemen, I am told, are very change-
able."
"Some may be so, Maria, but that is not my
character; I never loved before I saw you, and
now I feel I can never cease to love."
"Ah!" said Maria, "but I have only your own
word for that; and I have often read, that
gentlemen don't mind breaking their words in
love matters."
"Maria, only try me; I am ready this very
moment to prove to you the strength of my
affection. Fly with me at once, my dearest
girl! I will take you to my home, and to my
bosom. My fortune is at your feet; my life shall

be devoted to make you happy. You shall want .
for nothing; our days and nights shall pass on
the wings of love: we shall be all to each other.
Do," continued he, pressing her hand, "do con-
sent-come this moment!"
"Oh!" replied Maria, " that would be very
improper; besides, what would my poor father
and mother do, were I to go off thus with a
stranger ? they would die of grief."
"My dear girl, your parents shall be my
special care: say but that you will be mine, and
come to my home at once."
"No!" exclaimed Maria, firmly, " that is
impossible; I can go home with none but a
husband."
The tone in which she pronounced these words,
convinced him that she was not to be won by a
coup de main. He altered his manner, and thus
addressed her :-
Maria, I now see how it is: I was too vain
and presumptuous in supposing that you could love
me;there is someone else more favoured-
you have a lover, and I must despair."
"No," said Maria, "I have no lover."
"Nor never possessed one?" added he quickly
"No!" replied she, with some little hesitati.jp,
"I never have."
Then," said he, with a most insinuating tone,
you do not hate me?".
"Hate you ? no! I hate uobody".

"My dearest girl, do not trifle with me; only
tell me that I am not quite indifferent to you-
that I may hope for your love."
"Well," said she, blushing, "if that will satisfy
you1do say so.'
"My dearest Maria," said he, enclosing her
waist with one arm, "you make me so happy-
and you really have never had another lover?
"Never!" replied Maria, "never!"
The word "never" had scarcely passed her
lips, when a figure suddenly crossed the path-
it was Harry Everton! The fatal word which he
heard reverberated by the ominous echo of the vale,
again struck upon his ear;-it was uttered by
lips on which his destiny depended. He saw the
form of her he so fondly adored, almost enclosed
in the arms of another. He saw the face, upon
which he had so often gazed with unutterable
love, beaming with the smile of complacency
upon a stranger-he halted suddenly, and looked
at her with an air of astonishment and sorrow:
he attempted to speak, but could not; all his
faculties were confounded. She was at first
confused and startled by his appearance; but
soon recovering, she darted at him a look of dis-
pleasure and disdain. He clasped his hands,
and passed on in silence.
This little scene was not lost upon her watch-
ful and discriminating companion. His suspicions
were instantly excited.

" Who," demanded he abruptly,
" Who is
that young man ?"
Only a neighbour of ours, a friend of my
father's."
" Then you know him, Maria ?". .
" Know him? oh yes ! I have known him since
I was a child."
"But why did he not speak to, or salute you,
instead of stopping and staring so impertinently?
And how came you to give him such an angry
look?" demanded the stranger.
"Why," said she, "he did something lately
that displeased me I have broken with him."
"Broken with him! then it was your lover,
Maria, though you told me you never had one."
"I told you true; he never was my lover,--at
least he never said so."
"Maria, I have an eye that cannot be deceived
I know what love is too well, not to see it in
another. I marked the young man's countenance;
-love and jealousy were written on it plainly
enough; but let him take care how he crosses
my path again."
"Oh!" said Maria, "he won't interfere with
you."
"I hope not," replied he, with a smile of con-
temptuous pride; "but," he added, "the young
man must have been your lover, Maria - your
quarrel and his manner prove it.' "
"Surely," said she (not displeased at the

idea of exciting a little jealousy) "you do not
fear him as a rival ?"
"I," said he, drawing himself up, wbile his
dark gray eye flashed with fire, and his lip was
curled with a haughty smile, "I fear him as a
rival? No! but I may chance to chastise him as
an intruder.
Maria, alarmed at his manner, begged of him
to make his mind easy on the subject; and then
explained to him the intimacy of Harry with her
father, and the whole nature of his intercourse
with herself.
"Then," said he, "Maria, you do not love
him?"
" Love him! I never loved him;-I never
thought of him but as a friend."
"Well! my love, it is enough, I am satisfied;
but it is quite clear that he loves you :-that I can
judge from what I have seen, and from all that I
have heard from you. I cannot help fearing
something: he can see you when he pleases: he
is, too, a friend of your father's,--he may do
much with him."
"No," said Maria; "I am sure my father
would not oblige me to marry any one I did not
like. I shall take care, too, that he shall see
but little of me: if I ever liked him as a friend,
I feel that I hate him now. Besides," added she,
you know you can see my father."
Our hero seemed a little startled at the sud-
denness of this proposition; but quickly recovering

the self possession of which he was eminently
a master, replied, -
"Yes, certainly; I can, and will see your
father; but it is impossible for me to do so
immediately. Reasons, my dear Maria,' that I
cannot get over, prevent me from seeing him
for the present. It is necessary for my own
safety, and also for your interest, that our love
should, for a while, remain as secret as possible.
-But," said he, looking up towards the sky,
the evening is coming on fast, and I see your
cousin returning to us. Meet me, my dear
Maria, to morrow evening, and I will explain
every thing to youmy name, my situation in all
respects;and, oh! believe that my heart is wholly
yours; and that we will, we must be united."
Maria, after a little show of maidenly reluct-
ance, consented to meet him; and, after cautioning
her to secrecy, he took his leave, and retired
with his companion, who had just come up along
with her cousin.
The girls then directed their course back to
Poltstead. Maria made very light of this re-
contre to her companion, and treated the gentle-
man's attentions only as a bit of harmless flirtation.
Her cousin was a girl with a plain face, but good
figure. She was very gay, light-hearted, and
volatile; exceedingly fond of all kinds of flirtation
and coquetry with the men, but more for amuse-
ment than with any other more serious view.
When Maria asked her how she was entertained;

"Oh! very well," said she, laughing; "very
well indeed ;-a pleasant, nice young man quite
gay-very good company."
"What was he saying to you all this time?"
" I don't know, I'n sure;a great deal of nonsense,
-but he made me laugh. However, you," she
continued, "you have made a conquest indeed!"
"No such thing," said Maria.
"Do you know," said the cousin, "who that
gentleman is ?"
"No!" said Maria, "do you know? Have you
learned ?"
"I don't know his name, for my spark would
not tell me; but he is a very great Squire, and
has a fine house."
"Well," said Maria, sighing "that is nothing to
me; I dare say I shall never see him again."
"But I dare say you will, for the young man
told me that he was quite in love with you.
"Oh! nonsense,-how you do run on!"
"Ay," said Ellen, "I shall dance at your
wedding; I am sure it will all soon be settled."
After some further conversation, the girls
agreed that they would say nothing about this
meeting to any one; and Maria took leave of her
cousin, and proceeded home.
When they parted, the sun had set for
nearly an hour; light was rapidly fading from
the landscape, and the evening shades grew
deeper and deeper at every step Maria made.

THE RED BARN.
Nothing was heard but the indistinct hum of
winged insects, usual at the final close of a long
summer's day, varied only by the flitting of the
bat, or the distant hooting of the solitary owl
awakening to his evening prey. The moon had
not yet risen, and the sky, that "majestical roof
fretted with golden fire," was of that intensely
dark blue which is never seen in our climate but
in the hottest and finest midsummer. It looked
like an immense overhanging concave, of the
finest deep and polished marble.
Maria crossed the road, and entered a long,
retired green lane which communicated with
another cross road, that would lead her directly
home. She had not proceeded far in this direc-
tion, when she fancied she saw a figure rapidly
gliding on in her front. She lost sight of it imme-
diately, and indeed her glimpse of it was so very
faint, that she dismissed her first imagination
and believed it to be nothing but the dark shadow
of some tree in the distance, which she had mis-
taken for a human figure. She was tripping
lightly along, her mind greatly elevated and
excited by the recollections of the past day, and
by a variety of confused yet pleasing anticipa-
tions of the future, when she arrived at a small
close thicket, which grew at each side of the
path through which she had to pass, in a woody
valley. At this hour, the shade of the trees pro-
duced in this spot almost complete darkness

and the stillness of the tomb was around. The
time and place were not ill calculated to produce
some degree of superstitious awe in a young and
timid mind; but at present this impression was
greatly weakened by the peculiar feverish buoy-
ancy of her spirits. She entered the thicket, and
had got about half through it, when she heard,
uttered as it were behind her, in a deep and
distinct tone, the following couplet :-
" Speed home-speed home,-- with your heart so light,
For we're making your wedding ring to-night!"
She turned, but saw nobody near her; terror
seized her-she stood for a moment as if fixed to
the ground  a violent tremor shook her limbs,
and she staggered a little to one side of the path,
and leaned against a tree, quite exhausted. The
voice was not repeated, and no other sound
occurred to break the surrounding stillness and
repose. At length she recovered her strength,
and left the thicket with rapid steps. As she
proceeded her fears abated, and recollecting the
character of the words she had heard, and which
she had no doubt were uttered by some super-
natural agent, the favourable augury which she
drew from them helped to restore her spirits.
She reached the end of the lane just as the
moon was beginning to peep above the verge of
the horizon.
She was now on the road, on the left side

an
of which, a little way on, was a projecting bank,
wherean arose oak whose outstretching
branches threw a deep shade across the path.
She heard very distinctly the tramp of a horse's
hoofs, and soon saw, emerging beyond the shadow
of the tree into the moonlight, a man mounted on a
grey horse, and wearing a white hat! Her astonish-
ment at this sight was great indeed." Good
God !" thought she, "there he is again ;-what
could have brought him here at this time?" She
felt half afraid to go on, and her heart began
again to beat.
The horseman, however, ap-
proached leisurely, and drew up his horse before
her. The moon threw a light fully upon his face
and figure ; she saw that he was not her lover
of the fair, but an acquaintance of herself and
her father. His name was William Barnard. He
was a very young man, the son of a rich farmer
in the neighbourhood. He knew her directly,
having frequently met her before at and about
Polstead, at little rustic parties.
"What! Maria Martin," exclaimed he," is
this you?"
"Oh, Mr. Barnard," said she, "I was quite
frightened; I thought it was a stranger.
"And where have you been, Maria," resumed
William,
" At my cousin's," said she, "and at the fair.
I am now going home."
"Well, Maria," said he, "I will see you safe

the rest of your way." So saying he alighted
gallantly from his horse, and leading the animal
by the bridle, walked alongside of her.
" You have been at the fair, too, Mr. William,
I suppose," said Maria.
" Yes," he replied, "I was there in the early
part of the day, and bought two horses of Squire
Colson's for my father. We sent them home by
our John; and the Squire, who seemed pleased
with the bargain be made with us, asked farmer
Adamson and myself to dinner. There was one
or two more there, and the Squire's wine was
xcellent. We cracked a few bottles, and here I
am quite comfortable."
Young Barnard was by no means drunk, but
very highly exhilarated by the wine he had
drank.
"Squire Colson," said he, "is a real gentle-
man: he has no paltry pride about him ;-he is
not ashamed to shake an honest farmer by the
hand, and give him a good dinner. A fair day
never passes but he has half a dozen or so of them
to dine with him. If he should put up for par-
liament, he shall have plenty of votes in this
country."
Barnard was then seized with a fit of gallantry,
and began to pass a variety of compliments to
Maria's beauty, which, as she was as much
elevated as himself, though from a different cause,
she replied to with much liveliness.
## p. 46 (#68) ##############################################

THE RED BARN
"I declare, Maria," said he, " you look uncom-
monly pretty to-night; that white dress becomes
you well."
"Mr. Barnard," she answered, "I am sorry
I can't return the compliment. You don't look
even commonly pretty."
"Oh!" said he, "I can't help that; I don't
pretend to beauty. But you know the old proverb
Handsome is that handsome does ;' and I am
ready to do handsomely by you. Upon my word,
Maria, I am quite in love with you.'
"Nonsense," said she; "don't be so foolish."
as he was drawing closer to her, and taking
her hand).
Foolish!" said he, "I think I am very wise."
"That's more than anybody else thinks, I am
sure."
"I care very little what anybody thinks except
you. And all I can say is, Maria, that I love you
dearly ; that I want a wife, and that if you'll
have me, I'll make you as comfortable as you can
wish."
"You want a wife, Mr. William?" said Maria ;
"why you are hardly older than myself: what
would
you
do with a wife?"
"Oh ! leave that to me; I'll tell you
when
you
marry me."
" Then I fear I am not very likely ever to
know."
Well, Maria," continued he, "now let us leave

marry me, I'll make you as happy as a queen.
You know my family is well off, and we shall want
for nothing. Only say the word, and Parson
Boodle shall soon do the business."
" You must be joking," said she.
"Upon my soul," continued William, "I never
was more serious.
I am ready to marry you
to-morrow. I never was more serious in
my
life."
"Well, William! marriage is a very serious
business, and requires a little thinking about.
We are both too young to talk of such matters.
You have a father, and so have I."
" True," said Barnard, "but my father will let
me do as I please, and I am sure your father could
not object."
"I don't know how that is. But let us drop
the subject for the present. I am just at home,
and that is your way.
Well, Maria," said he, "but you'll think
of it."
"Why, I suppose I shall;good night."
"Good night!" echoed he, as he pressed her
hand to his heart and assumed a seriousness of
manner that surprised Maria, "Good night;-I
love you, my sweet girl!I have loved you long-
adored you, Maria. God bless you !-But who is
e you met at the fair to-day?"
He paused. She remained silent, he pressed
his lips to her burning cheeks and she felt that
his was wet with tears. His emotion increased

he broke from her arms, and having mounted
his horse rode rapidly away.
This recontre produced a very strong impres-
sion on the mind of Maria. Although she never
had an idea of Barnard's preference for her, his
declaration of love produced a favourable effect on
her heart. The fact of meeting this young man
on a grey horse, and with a white hat, threw her
into a sort of bewilderment: she began to think
that perhaps he was the person meant by the
fortune-teller. His father was known to be rich,
and there was no doubt but that it would be a
very good match for her to marry his son; but
then she did not meet him at the fair, and he did
not at all come up to the idea given by the fortune-
teller. He was not a gentleman; besides, she had
felt no particular partiality for him: he was well
enough, but nothing to compare with her new ac-
quaintance,who was, indeed, a handsome man,
and spoke and made love so differently. Oh, no!
it could not be William,-it must be the other.
She had just settled this point, when she came
to her father's gate. The moon was now fully
risen in unclouded majesty, and shed a yellower
verdure over all the surrounding landscape. Her
father's white-fronted cottage glistened in its
beams, as if washed with silver,-contrasting
beautifully with the vine-leaves that thinly tapes-
tried its walls, and the dark painted frames of
the little windows.
All was quiet around her home: the birds had

long retired to restthe insect trioe was hushed
-every wood and every field was silent. Not
a breath disturbed the calm serenity of the night,
--not a sound broke upon its profound stillness,
except the distant baying of some watchful dog,
the alert and faithful sentinel of the peaceful
cottage.
Just as she was about to enter, a female figure
appeared by the hedge, and beckoned to her:
she approached, and recognized the fortune-
teller. There was no difference in the woman's
dress from the first time Maria bad seen her,
except that instead of the old black silk mantle,
she wore a handsome French shawl, evidently
the produce of a contraband trade; her head
was covered with a silk kerchief, green and red
mixed, and her handsome waist bound with a
girdle of some dark-coloured morocco leather,
fastened with a plain steel buckle under her left
breast. But, whatever might have been the
reason, she certainly appeared to have taken more
pains than usual in putting on her dress to the
best advantage. Her black hair, too, was arranged
with rather more attention than when Maria had
seen her last; and the latter observed something
like a gem, whether true or false, sparkling on
one of her fingers.
This woman's naturally fine figure, Maria
thought, looked particularly striking on this oc-
casion she stood erect and seemed taller than

before. Her dark eyes beamed with something
like an expression of triumph, and a flush was
observable breaking through her swarthy cheek,
in spite even of the pale reflection of the moon-
light.
"Well! my fair damsel," said she, "how have
you sped?"
"Oh, you have told me all truthI have seen
him," said Maria.
So she detailed the entire of her interview and
conversation with the gentleman. When she
mentioned his asking her to meet him, the other
interrupted her, saying,
"Meet him! meet him by all means; do not on
any account fail. Let nothing prevent you ;-your
fortune will depend on this : fortune may do much
for us, but we must do something for ourselves. Our
fate is partly in our own hands,-fortune gives us
opportunities, 'tis ours to neglector improve them."
"But," returned Maria, "I met another man
to-night as I was coming home; he, too, wore a
white hat and rode a grey horse."
And she then gave her a full account of her
meeting and conversation with William Barnard.
The fortune-teller felt a little surprised, but
was silent, and seemed buried in thought.
"Perhaps," said Maria, "he may be the man,
after all, that is to be my husband;is it so ?"
"My dear," replied the sybil, after a pause, "our
knowledge is limited: we are permitted to look

a certain degree into futurity by our art. We
see the truth, but not the whole truth: I knew,
by looking at your hand, that, sometime on the
fair day, you would meet with a man mounted
on a grey horse and wearing a white hat, who
was to be your husband; but I did not discover
that you were to meet two such personsthat
was not allowed me; and if you ask me now
which of these two persons is to be finally your
husband, I candidly own I cannot tell at present;
-I must go home and consult my books. But
which of them," continued she, "do you like best?"
"There can be no comparison between them,
returned Maria: " the gentleman I met at
the fair is everything that I could desire;-SO
handsome,--so well spoken. William is a young
man I don't dislike, but I should not care for him
as a husband."
"Yes, my dear," said the fortune-teller, "but
girls are sometimes married to husbands they
don't care about: and, as I said, there is no know-
ing exactly at present;- many a slip between
the cup and the lip However, my opinion is,
that the other is your man: I shall soon be able
to know exactly ; in the mean time, don't you
fail to meet him.-But did nothing else occur to
you to-night?"
"Oh yes," said Maria, "I was very much
frightened indeed ;"and she told her of the
strange voice she had heard and the lines which
were repeated.
## p. 52 (#74) ##############################################
52
THE RED BARN.
"Ah!" said the fortune-teller, with a smile of
joyful surprise; "and what was the voice like ?"
"Like nothing human I ever heard," replied
Maria.
I dare say not," observed her companion; "it
was not human."
" What was it, then?" said Maria.
"That," said she, looking mysteriously, "I am
not permitted to reveal : there are secrets of the
other world, which must not be lightly spoken by
those who are favoured with some insight into
them: it is enough for you to know that the voice
was a good omen. Your marriage is certain, and
your fortune is written in the book of fate in
letters of gold. Marry which you may, you will
be rich and happy; but don't faildon't fail on
any account, in your meeting to-morrow evening.
Farewell! you shall see me soon again."
Maria put a piece of silver in her hand, and
they parted.
When the maid entered the cottage, her father
was in bed, and she found her mother waiting
up
for her.
"Well, Maria," said the latter,
to-night-I thought you would have been here
before : your father came home an hour ago, but
he was so tired, he went to bed."
"I stopt at my cousin's sometime after the
fair," said Maria.

"No," said she, "I met William Barnard, who
saw me to the end of thc road."
"Did you see Harry Everton at the fair ?"
"Yes," replied Maria, hesitatingly, "I saw
himI just saw him."
"He has been here this afternoon," said her
mother.
"Here !" exclaimed Maria, and felt alarmed
lest he had mentioned their meeting; " did he say
he had seen me ?"
"No," replied her mother, "he said very
little on any subject. Poor lad, there seems some-
thing the matter with him ;-he looked quite ill
and low-spirited. He and your father came in
together.
"He and my father?" repeated Maria, and her
alarm returned.
"Yes; he met your father on his way home,
and they walked in together."
" Indeed !"
"Yes, indeed!--you seem quite surprised ;-
what is there so very odd in their coming in
together?"
"Oh, nothing," replied Maria.
"I never saw the poor lad look so ill," observed
her mother, " he was as pale as a sheet."
(Here Maria felt something like a twitch of
conscience.)
Her mother continued ;"I am sure there is
something preying on his mind,--he looks like
one that is crossed in love."

- how can you
Maria laughed.
"Ah, you may laugh; but I think, Maria, you
are the cause of it all."
"Oh! mother," said Maria,
say that ? how can I be the cause of it ?"
" That is plain enough,you treated him so
ill this night week ;-I remember he went away
quite melancholy."
"My dear mother," returned Maria," I did
not treat him ill: if he thought proper to teaze
me when I was unwell and tired, let him take
the consequences. I have nothing to do with his
sullen fits, and I am sure I care very little
about them."
" Well," observed her mother, "I am sure poor
Harry loves you very much, and you should not
treat him so."
"Oh, mother, that is all foolishness."
" No, Maria, it is not foolishness. Harry, I am
sure, loves you : he is a good young man, and
both your father and myself would like to see
you n.arried."
Well, mother," said Maria, (who wished
to get rid of the subject, but was afraid to put a
decided negative to her mother's wish), "let us talk
no more about it now. I declare I am so tired
and sleepy, I cannot keep my eyes open-I must
go to bed ;-good night, my dear mother."
So saying, she retired to her chamber, undressed,
and went to bed; although, notwithstanding her
declaration of being tired and sleepy, she never

felt less inclination to repose : all that had
passed that day, between herself, the gentleman,
William Barnard, and the fortune teller, she
turned over and over again in her mind. The
mysterious voice again sounded in the cars of her
fancy; then she thought of the meeting that was to
take place to-morrow night, with hope, with fear,
and with anxiety.
The reader may have already remarked, from
all that we have described, that Maria's feelings
did not, as yet, partake precisely of the character
of love: she certainly liked the gentleman she
had met at the fair better than any other man
she had ever seen. His person and his manners
were both equally agreeable to her ; but there
was as large a portion of girlish ambition and
vanity mixed
up
with her ideas of him, as of any
softer feeling. Be it also remarked, that she was
not totally indifferent to Barnard : there was a
similarity of years, and, at this time, something
of a conformity of temper between them; and,
in case of missing the gentleman, she would not,
in all probability, have made any very serious
objection to accepting the matrimonial offers of
the other.
Maria was employed in such reflections as
these, and sleep was banished from her pillow,
when she heard very distinctly, and evidently near
her window, the following verses sweetly sung
by two male voices :-

THE RED BATH.
1.
There is a pearl within this cot,
Of greater price than wealth untold ja
To win it-ob! be mine the lot,
And I will sigh no more for gold.
II.
There is a flower within this grove,
More bright than any flower that blow
More fragrant than the breath of love,
And purer than the virgin rose. .
III.
How blest, who wins to wear this pearl !
This flower where every sweetness lies;
How blest is be, enchanting girl !
For whom thy gulleless bosom sighs !
To this song she listened with a pleasing asto-
nishment. She arose when it was concluded,
and looked out of the window, but could not
discern the slightest traces of any human being.
The deepest stillness prevailed around, and the
moonlight calmly slept on the hill, the valley,
the meadow grass, and the tall trees around her.
The effect was like enchantment on the mind of
the maiden, and, having listlessly gazed on the
blue arch above her for at least an hour, she
retired to her pillow as from a fairy scene.

But how shall I relate in other cantos
Of what befel our hero in the land,
Which 'tis the common cry and lie to vaunt as
A moral country? But I hold my hand-
For I disdain to write an Atalantis;
But 'tis as well at once to understand,

Without the aid of too sincere a poet.
BYRON,
It will be now necessary to lead the reader a
little forward in our history, and, quitting for the
present Maria and her love affairs, to transfer the
scene of our narrative to London.
Let him, then, accompany us in imagination from
Suffolk to the metropolis-alight with us from the
top of the coach at the Blue Boar in Whitechapel.
We shall not stop to take any refreshment in that
respectable inn, bating one glass of brandy and
water, for which we shall pay eighteen-pence,
and as our business is pressing, we shall walk
arm in arm into the main street. When we have
gone a few dozen yards along that ancient and
polite vicinity, we shall turn up a long and narrow
lane on the north side of the way, the name of
which we choose, for the best of reasons, to conceal.
1

THE RED BARN.
When we have arrived near the end of this lane,
which opens upon the fields, we enter a public-
house of no very respectable exterior. Whether
such an establishment exists at present or not
we cannot take upon ourselves to say, but certain
it is, that it did exist at the period of which we
are writing.
We pass the bar, and the common room where
the chance customers drop in, and, crossing the
yard, we come to an apartment, on the door of
which we see PRIVATE ROOM in very imposing
capitals. Availing ourselves of the privileges of
authors in all ages, we make bold to open this
door and enter, without at all disturbing the
company, or indeed exciting any consciousness
of our presence.
In this room, which is of a good size, is a
round table, which very nearly fills it. At this
table are sitting five persons of no very pre-
possessing appearance. Their costume is neither
altogether that of the town or that of the country.
It is a bizarre mixture of both, or, more properly
speaking, an agreeable compound of the farmer,
butcher, and horse jockey. In reference to per-
sonal cleanliness, and a peculiar species of dan-
dyism, their exterior will be best depicted by the
expressive vulgarism of " dirty swells."
The looks of these gentry were in perfect keep-
ing with their dress. Coarse featured vulgarity,
callous insensibility, sly cunning, oi desperate
ferocity, constituted their leading characteristics;

nor was the expression othe countenance, in this
case, at all a fallacious index of the mind.
They were partaking of the generous beverages
hrewed by Meyx, and distilled by Hodges, and
each was provided with a long pipe, from which
he was puffing volmes of smoke in ominous silence
and solemnity. This silence remained for a little
time unbroken, but was at last interrupted by a
gentleman sitting at the head of the table, whom
we shall take leave to call, for distinction's sake,
the president.
This worthy might be about forty-five or fifty
years of age. He was tall and very robust. His
dark locks were rather grizzled, and his com-
plexion was of that hue which appeared to be
the joint produce of brandy, wind, and weather.
He had a remarkably flat nose, wide and project-
ing mouth, and his small black eyes glistened
like two little fiery points from beneath his mon-
strous bushy eyebrows.
"We muster thin to night," said he; "I won-
der what's become of the rest of our lads."
" Flat catching to be sure," said a stout man
at the other end of the table, in a grey frock coat
and red triped waistcoat, and whose beauty was
far from being improved by the loss of his right
eye. " It is early yet; we shall have some of them
here soon, and I hope with some game."

the left of the president, to his opposite neign-

bour, " have you done a good stroke of business
to-day?"
The person thus styled Captain, was a man
about five or six and thirty years of age, with
very plain and vulgar features, and an appearance
altogether indicating anything but the military or
naval profession. Still, there was an expression
in his face of the most irresistibly droll and
solemn humour. He was styled Captain, in
virtue of his being at the head of a young band
of " appropriators."
"No," said he, "not a great deal,- only half
a dozen silk wipers, brought in by Solomons and
Ikey Jones;-a bad day's work, and therefore I
gave the young rascals nothing. I read them a
moral lecture on their conduct ;-says I, you
young vagabonds, how do you hope to earn your
bread, if this be the way you attend to business?
there is nothing to be done in this world without
industry ;-you were on the very best stand in
London to-day, (they were in Pall-mall and St.
James's street, and it was a levee at Carlton
House, you know). You might, says I, have
brought a dozen wipers a piece, at least. What
do you expect to come to? You will be forced to
turn beggars, or disgrace yourselves by going to
service."
"By Gad, Creed," said the pian with one eye,
"it is a pity that you are not a parson, or a
Achoolmaster.

" God forbid !" replied the Captain ;  I hope
to live and die an honest man."
"You certainly, however," rejoined the other,
. have a happy knack of instructing youth ;the
rising generation will be greatly indebted to you."
"Aye," replied the Captain, "I act upon the
good old maxim, Train up a youth in the way
he
should go, and when he is old he will not depart
from it."
" I suppose, my noble Captain," said the young
man who first addressed Creed, "that you were
yourself so trained up."
"No," said the Captain, "I was not brought
up to the business of macingI took it up from
natural genius. I was bred in an attorney's office,
but I was too honest to succeed in that line. Their
method is too roundabout for me, I like to do
things straight forward ;-besides, I confess my
weakness; I am naturally soft-hearted, and I
could not bear to see so many widows and orphans
ruined by law."
"Yes, Creed," said the man with one eye,
"we all know you have a soft heart and a tender
conscience; but methinks you were not brought
up as an attorney for nothing: you have learned to
keep on the windy side of the law. You make
others your stalking horses, while you bag the
game.
"Your comparison is bad," rejoined the Cap-
tain : "I use them as a sportsman does his dogs ;
they run down the game and fetch it in without
daring to bite"

They have a nibble sometimes."
"Not often; they know the consequences."
"Well, you play a tolerably sure card-- you
keep your neck out of the noose."
"What the devil," said the Captain, "is the
use of a man's head, if it can't take care of his
neck. Our worthy president there, I know, is
of a different opinion, he does not care how often
he runs the chance of swinging, or being shot.
He wants a little of my wit."
" You want a little of my courage, Creed,"
said the president. "If you

revenue sharks at times, all the better, I like to
make the bull-dogs speak."
" Aye, aye," said the Captain, "that's all
mighty fine sport to you, but it might be death to

of peace, although I am a Captain. You're all
for dry blows ;-they may suit your sconce very
well, but they'd give me a headache.

were so very particular as to whom you robbed ;
and as for honour, What's honour ? will honour

a chair; "but it does
very well for me; I'd rather
have it than a wooden one. No, no! honour
can't set a leg, nor put your head to rights after
your neck is stretched ;-damn honour,--I hate
it almost as much as I do law."
"I say, Creed," said the smuggler, " did you
ever come to the scratch in your life ?"
"No," says the Captain, "I can't say
did; I am not bloody-minded -I have no taste
for wounds, bruises, and wooden limbs. And
yet I drew an old rusty sword once."
" Totoast cheese, I suppose," said the smuggler.
"No," replied Creed; "the story is worth
your hearing. I was in Paris at the time--parley-
dood but badly, and was without a tanner. I met
a fellow that had run away from England, after
robbing the Stamp Office of some thousands ;-I
knew him well--he had plenty of blunt, -I asked
him for sone, and the rascal refused. I soon
forined a plan to settle him. He was a stupid
fool, and knew nothing of French, and very little
of anything else. Next morning I put on a loose
blue coat over my other clothes, and an old cocked
hat, which I borrowed from one of my French
cronies, and under this coat I had an old sword
in a black cross belt. I was with my gentleman
before he was out of bed, for I would not be

denied. "Oh l' says he, "is that you ? Yes,' says
I, (taking off my cocked hat, and opening my
loose coat, that he might see the sword and belt),
'and I am very sorry te disturb you so early, but
my business don't admit of ceremony.' In the
name of God!' says he, 'what's the matter ?". Oh,
nothing,' says 1,' only you're found out, that's
all.'  Found out !' says he. "Aye, by my
soul,' says I, 'found out, sure enough;-you have
been traced here, and application has been made to
the French Government, and directions given
that you should be arrested immediately. My
dear friend,' says he, I'm so much obliged to
you,and you have come here to warn me!' By
my word, I have,' says I, "and to do a little more
too. Don't you see my cocked hat and sword ?
you left me so suddenly yesterday, that I had
not time to tell you that I am in the employ of
the police here : being hard up, I was glad of
the situation. And now they have sent me to
arrest you ; here's the order,'and I pulled out of
my pocket a duplicate of a watch that I had
pledged a few days before at the Mont-de-Piet,
for so they call the spouting establishment in
Paris, and as it is under the government, and its
papers are marked with the royal arms, the
duplicate looked exactly like an official paper,
and the fool knew no better. He was horribly
frightened. "Conne,' says I, its very disagreeable
to my feelings, but duty, you know, must be done.
Get up and dress yourself as quick as you can,

- - I repeated, drawing the sword, - for my com 
rades below are in a hurry: we have to arrest
five persons more before twelve o'clock,two of
them are Englishmen,-for like offences. The
government here is determined that no offenders
against the English laws shall escape.'
"On this he got out of bed, and put on his
breeches, quite in a quandary.  Come here,'
says I, opening the window, and you'll see my
comrades below. He looked out, and saw two
very neat lads of my own-friends of mine, that I
had brought on purpose : one was an Italian
barber, that I had known herea regular out-
and-outer. He came to Paris to mace the
French, but they were too much for him, and he
lost all his money. This boy had as much hair
on his face as would have set him
up
in his own
trade of wig making. The other was a man of
colour, a servant out of place, who had left his
master in consequence of some little difference
in money-matters. When my gentleman saw
these, he was still more frightened ;and look,'
says I againpointing to two gens-d'armes that
happened to be standing at a little distance, if
my comrades and myself should not be enough
to secure you, there are two honest fellows ready
to help us.'
" This completely finished him,-he fell on his
knees, and begged of me to let him escape,-
Oh, no,' says I, that's impossible ;-they are
too strict with us. You think you are in London;

but the police here do business quite differently.
If it was known that we let you escape, we
should all swing.'
"My dear friend,' says he, 'do let me escape.
Here's twenty Napoleons for you, and let me
go ;-I have my passport made out for Brussels,
and I shall be off before you can say Jack
Robinson. Why,' says I, what you say is
pretty fair, and if it depended on myself I might
let you off, but there's my two comrades; they
would peach to a certainty.' 'Oh,' says he, 'surely
you can persuade them. Why,' says I, "there's
but one mode of dealing with these people ; you
say twenty Napoleons for myselfsay twenty
more for them, and I'll see what I can do with
them.' "Twenty, my dear friend ?' says he. 'Oh,
not a penny less,' says I; 'I could not offer them
less, and I don't know if they'll do it for that,
but I'll go and see ;-in the mean time I must
lock you in.' So saying, I took out the key of
the door which I locked outside, and went down
stairs.'
"I returned in about five minutes. Well,'
says I, 'I have spoken to my comrades, and
they are contented to let you go, on the terms,
--but we must have five Napoleons more to
give the soldiers.'  My dear friend,' says he,
(for he was damned fond of money), 'can't this
be got over ?'Ob, yes ! says I, 'by coming with
us to the police.' Well, well,' says he, fetching
a deep sigh, if it must be, it must.' So he

counted me down forty-five Naps, which he parted
with like so many drops of blood. Now,' says
I, 'my good friend, be off as quick as you can:
we'll return and say, you have escaped : but, if
you stay in Paris another hour, the devil himsek
can't save you.' He took my advice, and posted
off to Brussels ; took shipping at Ostend for
America, and, contrary to the opinion of every one
who knew him, was drowned on his passage.
Certainly, Captain," said the one-eyed man,
" that is a right good story; but if the fellow
had had one spark of sense or courage, he must
have found you out."
Oh," said the Captain, "I knew my man: a
greater ninny never breathed, or a more miserly
scoundrel ; and he was a greater coward than
myself."
The Captain had scarcely finished his last
observation, when a person entered the room
who was hailed at once with surprise and delight
by the whole company.
" What, Stafford Jackson !-is it
you?
?"
echoed by altogether.
This was a man about thirty, with handsome
features, of the middle stature, or perhaps rather
above it, dressed in a light drab top-coat with
one cape, a black cravat, and a pair of mud over-
alls : he wore spurs, had a riding switch in his
hand, and was well spattered.
"Yes, my boys," said he, "here I am, and a

"Well, what news?" said the president.
" The best of news, Warren, my boy," replied
the other; "we got our cargo over safe; landed
last night, and stowed it, you know where. A
glorious lot of silk and lace. We dispatched off
our lads directly ;-three for London, two for the
North, and two for the West. I took coach at
four this morning as far as Rumford; there a
horse was waiting for me: I mounted, but did
not come the straight road, -I took a little cir-
cumbendibus-you understand medid a small
bit of business after dark,and here I am."
" Well done," said the president, "by Gad!
you know how to do the trick."
"Oh, leave me alone for that;--but I
say,
Warren, have you done all your business here ?os
"Yes," replied the other;"Tim there, and
myself, got rid of the last lot to-day : I'm sure
I'm glad of it,-I want to get out of this cursed
hole."
"And that you shall, my boy," replied Stafford
Jackson; "the Spanker is waiting for you, with
five good hands aboard, and a boy; take her,
and be off to the other side as fast as the wind will
carry you : you are the only fellow I can trust
her with, except myself. And there," continued
he, tossing over to him a small leathern bag,
" there's something to help the freightage, for the
boys on the other side."
" But where's Jack Smith ?" said Warren ;
"' won't he come with me? Jack's the lad for a

tussle ;there's no man, next to yourself, that I
would sooner have alongside of me."
"I expect him here every moment," replied
Stafford Jackson; " he left some hours after me:
but I cannot part with him at presentthere's
business for us to do here."
"Aye," said Warren, "some of
capers,
I
suppose.
You and Jack have the same fault,
--you lose too much time after the girls. I say,
what's become of that little bit of goods you were
along with at Polstead fair ? Jack, too, had a
finger in the pie: he was looking after another
your old
small cargo."
"Oh! mum for that," replied Stafford Jackson ;
but you're mistaken it's for no such business
Smith is wanting at present; he has caught
a regular flat, down in Suffolk; he has had him
in training for some months; quite a young
one, as green as a leek : Jack has given him
some good lessons. The old father of this chap
is rich, and Jack has taught the son the road to
the strong-box: he has plenty of blunt, and
Jack is bringing him up to town for the first
time, where, please the pigs, we shall soon
release him of his burthen."
" Well then, Commodore," said the president,
"I
suppose I may be off immediately ?"
" Not for the world," said Stafford Jackson;
"to-morrow morning will be time enough; I
can't have too many hands to-night. We must
fleece the greenhorn,--he'll be here directly

Captain Creed, you're the man for him; and
Warren, you're as neat a hand at all-fours as
I know, the Captain always excepted."
" Thank you, Mr. Jackson," said the Captain;
I think your own skill that way is not to be
despised."
"Oh!" replied Stafford Jackson, " I never touch
a card now, in company, you understand me?"
" Yes," said Creed, "you bet on the wrong
side, and lose your money."
"Exactly so," said he; "I lost twenty pounds
that way in Chelmsford, three weeks ago, betting
with Jack Smith on an officer of the garrison, at
billiards."
" Aye," said Creed, "but how much did you
win ?"
"A trifle," said Jackson ; "we only divided
five and twenty."
" That is a great deal though," said Creed, "for
an officer to lose,a quarter's pay."
"Oh, not for him," returned Jackson; "he
is a first rate dasher,a captain of dragoons, with
plenty of money."
"I wonder he played with Smith," said the
Captain.
"Oh! for that," replied the other, "he'd play
with a chimney sweeper, or old Harry himself,
he's so fond of the game.

and twenty years of age, now entered. He was

smart and athletic make; his bair, eyes, and
whiskers, were dark, and his complexion of a
ruddy brown: his features were coarse, and
he had, in an eminent degree, what is termed a
knowing look.
"Hah! Smith," said Stafford Jackson, "here
you come at last,-just arrived, I suppose
" You have hit it," said Smith; "we have just
disembarked from the coach."
" We!" reiterated Jackson; " then you
the trout on the bank ?"
" Yes," said Smith, " hooked him nicely; I
have just deposited him at the Three Nuns' Jon.
I came here to give you warning to prepare your
faces to play your parts; I shall now return and
fetch him directly. But I say, my lads, none of
you must know me, except Jackson."
"A word to the wise," said Captain Creed."
Smith retired, and Jackson thus addressed the
party :
"My lads, we must not let out before this
youngster. As he's but newly fledged, we might
frighten him, and he might take the wing. If it's
not our own faults, we shall have many a jolly
pluck at him. We must not go too far to-night:
were we to strip him altogether to-night, it
would not do. I should not object to it, if he had
no more money than what he has brought up to
town; but he can get many future supplies, and
we must not excite his suspicions at the onset.
Moreover, my lads, we must sink the shop as

much as possible. he is not an ignorant man, por
a fool, though young and inexperienced. You,
Creed, are a man of education and the world, and
can entertain him properly: as for the rest of
you, the less you talk the better. You, Warren,
must take a hand at cards."
"The tiller suits my hand better," said Warren.
"Oh! never mind that for to-night," said
Jackson ; "you play well ;-and, do you hear,
keep, if you can, your contraband dialect to
yourself. But, by George, I forgot ! I must uncase
before he comes, that I may look a little decent,
as I must play the flat to-night."
So saying, he divested himself of his top-coat
and mud over-alls, and appeared in a well-made
dark green frock, which showed his fine figure to
advantage, and a pair of dark grey pantaloons,
and hessian boots. He took a key out of his
pocket and opened a small closet, in which he
deposited the top-coat and over-alls.
"Now," said he, "I think I shall do." And
certainly, his handsome and even commanding
features, and gentlemanly person, formed a con-
siderable contrast to the appearance of those
around him.
"By Gad! Jackson," said Creed, looking at
him, "I don't wonder at the girls running after
you,-you are not a bad looking fellow."
" Creed," said Jackson, "if you can't tell
me anything newer than that, you may as well
hold your tongue."

73.
"Gad!" said Creed, "I did not. inean it as
new; but you know, as the Scripture says, 'Out
of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.';
But what's that sticking out of your pocket?"
"One of my tools," said Jackson; "but as we
are to sink the shop, I shall put it
up
with the
other toggery."
So saying, he pulled out a small double-barrelled
pistol, and put it into the closet.
"I have seen that little pistol do some good
work," said Warren," before now."
"Oh," said Jackson, carelessly, "I believe it
has done it's duty, but not better than other
pistols;your own, for instance, Warren."
"Ah!" said Warren, "but for that pistol, I
should not be here now."
"Well, well, Warren," said Jackson,
more of that; I hear footsteps crossing the yard.
It is Jack Smith and the gull: mind,-don't be at
all familiar with me."
His conjecture was right : it was Jack wlio
entered, and with a very young man, apparently
not twenty years of age.
Smith bowed slightly to the company in
general, and, coming up to Jackson, took him by
the hand, and said,
* Mr. Jackson, this is my particular friend,
Mr Barnard.
So saying, Smith and his protege seated thein-
selves beside Jackson,
The latter preserved exactly that sort of manner

to the rest of the company that might, lead the
stranger to suppose that they were merely taverii,
acquaintances, and not to suspect any greater
intimacy between them. As for Jack Smith, he
was even more disiant; for he had told his com 
panion that he only came there because his friend,
Mr. Jackson, occasionally used the house when
in town, as being convenient for his business,--that
his father was a great grazier in Devonshire, and
had extensive dealings with all the principal
killing butchers in Whitechapel : to which he
added, that Stafford Jackson was a very dashing
young man, fond of the amusements of London, had
plenty of money, was as liberal as a prince, &c. &c
When they had sat down, Jackson called for a
bottle of wine, of which he insisted on his two
companions partaking. The rest of the company
were drinking grog.
" Captain Creed," said Jackson, "this is a
very good house: I don't know a better of the
kind in London."
"Nor I," said Creed; "every thing is good and
cheap. It is not always your houses with the
most dashing outsides that are the best. How
do you find the wine, Mr. Jackson ?"
"Excellent," replied the latter ;
the latter; I have paid
seven shillings a bottle for worse port at the
Vest End.Try a glass, Captain."
"Tuank
you, Mr. Jackson, I don't care if I do."
Thi; bottle was soon finished, and Jackson
for another.

The conversation now began to grow more
brisk; and Creed, in particular, told several
anusing stories of his travels,-not, however, pre-
cisely of the character of the Paris affair ; and
Smith's companion began to be gradually excited,
and grew rather lively. Jackson, observing this,
and acting as if the wine had got into his head,
though it was scarcely possible to affect him in
that
way,
stood
up
and said,
"I am tired of this wine : one bottle of it is
enough for a man, this cold weather. Allow
me, gentlemen," addressing the whole company,
" to treat you to a bowl of punch."
* I have no objection, Mr. Jackson, provided
you let others take their turn," observed Creed.
Certainly," said Jack Smith, "that's but fair."
* Oh, no doubt," said his companion.
"Well, gentlemen," observed Jackson, "you
shall do as you like afterwards, but I'll order in
the bowl."
He did so, and a very large bowl of hot and
strong punch soon made its appearance.
This soon wrought its effect: the conversation
grew highly spiritedStafford Jackson made
many
lively sallies, and Creed was unusually comical.
"Mr. Jackson," said Smith, "push the bowl
this way; my friend and I are aground."
"I am called Mr. Stafford Jackson, if you please,
Mr. Smith; my father is Mr. Jackson : that's
the
way we are distinguished from each other."

"Well, then, Mr. Stafford Jackson, let us have
the punch, if you please."
"No," said the latter; " damn me, we must
sink the Mr.; I'll be plain Stafford Jackson."
Very well," said the other, "and I'll be plain
Jack Smith with you: so, plain Stafford Jackson,
let us have the punch.
Oh !" resumed Smith, "we are now aground,
-its my turn now."
" No, Mr. Smith," said the Captain, " 'tis mine;
.-you and your friend are strangers-your turn
comes last."
" Gad!" said Smith, looking round the table,
one, two, three, four, five, I'm afraid my turn
won't come to night, if I am to wait for all of
you.
Don't be alarmed," observed Creed, "our
worthy president there could drink the five bowls
himself, if that was all."
Aye," said Warren, "and five more to the
back of them."
"I believe you," says Creed, "if you had only
time enough. Allow me to ask you what was
the longest drinking bout you ever had ?"
"I'll tell you," said the other ;-it was on the
hgih seas.
Stafford Jackson gave him a look, as much as to
say, "nothing contraband."
Jle replied by a sly wink, and continued.
"I was then in the Norway trade, and used to

near the Orkney Islands, and for three days and
three nights there was such a fog that you could
hardly see your hand. We cast anchor, broached
a cask of rum, and the mate and myself stuck to
our grog for the whole time."
" The ship must have fared well," said Jack
Smith, " while you were boosing."
Oh, there was no fear of her," said Warren ;
" she had hands aboard that we could depend
upon : besides, we ourselves were as sober as
judges."
" Come, Captain Creed," exclaimed Jackson,
" give us a song.
" With all my heart," said Creed ; and sung
with a very fine voice and good taste," Locks
bolts, and bars."
"That's a professional song," said Warren.
"Yes," returned Creed; "I learned to sing it
when I was in the waggon-train."
"He means the waggon," whispered Jackson
in a low voice to Smith, whose companion was
then talking to his neighbour on the other side.
"Now, Mr. Jackson," said Creed, "I call on
you."
"I can't sing a solo," replied Jackson; " but
I'll try a second with my friend Smith."
The latter, who had a good voice and ear, and
was well accustomed to all the pot-house singing
in London, assented; and they sung in very good
style together, the duet of " All's well." Stafford

Jackson, however, was evidently the more scien
tific singer of the two, and his second' was
admirable.
After this, Creed proposed a glee; and he,
Stafford Jackson, and Jack Smith, sung
Van Tunck."
By this time it may well be imagined that
young Barnard was getting tolerably drunk. He
began to be very communicative with the company
in general; to relate stories and adventures con-
nected with himself and his family, and to boast
of his own feats of horsemanship and skill in rural
sports.
"The country," said Creed, "is very well in
summer, and in winter too during the day, but it
must be dull in the evenings."
"Oh no," replied young Barnard, "we manage
to pass our time very well, over a flowing bowl
and a game at cards."
" Cards!" said Creed: "you play, then ?"
"I believe I do," said he, with a look which, no
doubt, he thought extremely knowing.
"Do you play whist ?" said Creed.
"No," replied the other, "not much of that; I
don't like the game: but, for all fours, I'll back
myself against any man in the country."
Or London either, I suppose ?" said the
Captain."
" Aye, or London either," replied the young
fellow.

"Well," said Creed, "I think I can find
your
match in London: I should not mind trying you
myself."
" There's nothing I should like better," said
young Barnard ; "and if we had the cards now,
I'd be your man."
" The cards can be easily procured," said Creed,
" and I have no objection to play; but I must
tell you before hand that I never play high ;-no
more than to give a zest to the game.'
Oh!" said Barnard, " for my own part, I don't
dislike a good bet on the game.
Well," observed Creed, "I dare say you will
find some gentlemen here to indulge you. If you .
like, your friend Mr. Smith and I will play with
you and Mr. Jackson."
"I'd rather be excused," said Jackson;" I am no
player, and like better to look on."
" Very well," said Creed; "then our worthy
president will make one of the party."
"With all my heart," said Warren ; " but, as I
don't know how these gentlemen play, we may as
well cut for partners."
"Why," observed Creed, " I'm willing to take Mr.
Smith, of whose play I know nothing; and can't
you do the same by Mr. Barnard ? but I'm willing
to content you. We can't cut until the cards
come, but here's all the same ; l'll toss with
for choice of partners."
Done," said the other.
They tossed, and Creed won

"Well," said he to Warren, "to show you that
I'm not particular, I'll take young Mr. Barnard :
but let us send for the cards."
The landlord was sent for, and soon made his
appearance. He was a very appropriate figure
for the president of such an establishment. He
was a tall and powerful man, about forty-eight
or fifty years of age ; had been a heavy dragoon,
and was marked with a deep scar, extending
obliquely from the top of his forehead to below
his cheek-bone on the left side.
"Landlord," said Creed, " have you got a pack
of cards ?"
"Yes, Captain," said the landlord, "I have."
"Is'it a new pack ?" demanded Jack Smith.
"No, Sir," rejoined the landlord.
Oh, then," said Smith, " I won't play with it -
I never play with old cards. I say, Mr. Barnard,"
continued he, addressing young Barnard ; " you
and I will go out and fetch in a new pack. The
shops are not yet shut: I know a stationer's in
Whitechapel where I can get them."
So saying, he got up and led off Barnard along
with him.
" Smith's a neat hand," said Creed ; " he knows
what he's about. I say, landlord, is your pack
bound up to look like new ?"
"Yes," said the landlord, "it is new; we got
it to-day : only took the cards out to mark them,
and made it up again as nicely as ever."
"And where is it now?" demanded Jackson,
## p. 81 (#103) #############################################
THE RED BARN.
81
"Where !" said the landlord, "why, in Mr.
Smith's pocket, to be sure,where else should
it be ?"
Upon this they all set up a shout of laughter.
"But now," said Creed, " while they are
away, let's hold a council. Shall we introduce
him to the bones below stairs to night, Jackson ?"
"No," replied Stafford Jackson, "not to-night-
too soon ;-we must fleece him gradually. In five
or six days he'll be without any money:
But he
can get more ;--and more after that. We must
not be too fast with him, lest he might declare off,
-more haste, worse speed."
" Well," said Creed, "I leave it to your better
judgment. But I say, Jackson,-share and share
wike. Fair play's a jewel."
"Yes," returned Stafford Jackson, "you have
reason to use that proverb. -But, Captain, when
did you see me act otherwise than fair? Is there
any man who knows Stafford Jackson, who ever
knew him to put a paltry pound into his pocket
at the expense of his friends ? No, no! the world
is wide;-thank God, there are fools enough for us
all, without preying on each other."
"I beg your pardon, my dear Jackson," said
the Captain, "I did not mean what I said for
you ;but Jack Smith has this young fellow so
much under his thumb."
"Oh!" said Stafford Jackson, "I can answer
for Smith, as for myself. And even if I thought

he could be unfair, I'd soon settle him, notwith
standing our friendship. I'm a very easy going
fellow, but I am not to be trifled with."
"I know that," said Warren; "and it is a pity,
my gallant commodore, that you are forced to
conjure the mocusses out of fellows' pockets in
this numbug sort of way, instead of taking them
boldly, as the right of a brave man, on the high
seas, or,-elsewhere."
"Necessity, Warren," said Jackson, "neces-
sity ;-times are altered. This cursed peace has
ruined us all. Ah! Warren, if there were another
war, you'd soon see Stafford Jackson in his right
element,-on the quarter deck of a privateer,
cleared out for action,--all sails set, bearing down
with a fine breeze on some rich prize, like a
falcon swooping on a dove."
Aye," said Warren, "and if we were in the
South Seas, we should not be very particular as to
the flag."
"By the bye," said Jackson, " there is some-
thing to be done there, even now. And if all
comes to all, and we can muster enough for a
good fit out, it would be no bad spec. But as
matters stand at present, I must, as an old
general, whose name you never heard of, used to
say, eke out the lion's skin with that of the fox."
"Aye," said Creed, "and you'll find the latter
no bad addition. For my part, it's large enough
for me without the other."

Jack Smith and young Barnard now entered,
and, with Creed and Warren, sat down to their
partie quarre.
"What do we play for?" demanded Smith.
"I won't stand more than half a crown on the
rub," answered Creed ; "you may make your
bye-bets as you please."
"I'll have a crown with you, Mr. Warren, on
every game," said Jackson.
" Done," said Warren.
"Who'll bet with me?" said young Barnard.
" I'll have five shillings with you on the rub,"
said Smith, " besides our half-crown."
They played, and Creed and his young part-

Warren won.

Suffice it to say, that after several well managed
fluctuations of fortune, young Barnard arose from

all the money he had about him. Stafford Jack-

But Creed consoled him, saying, that it was all
the fortune of war. Jack Smith conducted his

BEFORE we proceed further with our history,
it will be necessary to let our readers know who
Stafford Jackson and Jack Smith really are, as
they will both be found to have been very prin-
cipal and efficient actors in most of the subsequent
events that we shall have occasion to describe.
Stafford Jackson was the son of a gentleman
of small fortune, residing near Ipswich. He lost
his mother when he was very young, and his
father was a man of a gay and social turn, fond
of his glass, and passionately attached to hunting,
shooting, and all kinds of rural sports. Stafford,
who was a fine active boy, soon learned to
excel in all kinds of country exercises. At ten
years of age he could ride like a young Arab, and
at fourteen could bring down a snipe or wood-
rock with almost as much certainty as his father

Stafford Jackson was sent to school very early,
as his father was determined that his education
should not be neglected. There he made a very
considerable proficiency in all the usual and some
of the ornamental branches of education.
He was, without question, one of the idlest and
most mischievous boys in te entire school. He
past his school-hours in playing tricks of all kinds,
making those who were disposed to idleness still
worse, and preventing those who were inclined to
study from so doing. Out of school he was the
ringleader in every kind of school-boy wicked-
ness,-foremost in robbing orchards, organizing
plans of rebellion, and the like. There was no
boy in the school that could excel him, when he
was about thirteen or fourteen, in boxing, leaping,
wrestling, running, or swimming. He was, there-
fore, regarded by his schoolfellows with great
respect, and some degree of fear; but he had
so much good humour and generosity of disposi-
tion withal, that he was loved full as much as he
was respected and feared.
He constantly received severe castigation for
his various pranks, but never for his lessons : in
these he was always perfect, though he was never
seen to look into a book. His plan was this :-
though he was a boarder at the school in ques-
tion, his father lived so near, that Stafford used
always to go home on Saturday afternoon and
return to school the following Monday. The
great majority of this interval he devoted to hard

study, and as his capacity was singularly good, ho
mastered, without much difficulty, all the tasks
of the succeeding week.
During the vacations, he passed his tine in all
kinds of country sports He always accompanied
his father to the field, and was his companion at
table :even when there was company, Stafford
made one of the party, and at fourteen took his
wine regularly like the rest. Ilis manliness of
appearance and manners, much beyond his years,
and his sharpness, intelligence, and high spirit,
made him a universal favourite with all his father's
friends.
He left school when turned of fifteen, and it
may be well imagined that he did not pursue
very closely the line of study he had commenced
there. He acquired, however, a taste for amusing
reading, from the society of an old gentleman in
the neighbourhood, who was very fond of him,
and who had a large library entirely composed
of plays and poetry, novels and romances. As
many of the latter were in French, Stafford kept
up his knowledge of that language by reading
them, and acquired further facility by conversing
with an emigrant French gentleman, who was a
friend of his father's.
About this time a singular character came to
reside in his father's neighbourhood; one Captain
Carribles, an old gentleman who, during three-
fourths of his life, had been an officer in the navy.
Not being provided with good interest, in spite of

his long services, and the loss of a right arm,
he never arose beyond the rank of a lieutenant ;
and was put on half-pay, to which was added,
after long and patiently memorializing the Admi-
ralty, a small pension. He retired into Suffolk,
which was his native country, and took a pret
picturesque cottage near the sea-side.
Captain Carribles, notwithstanding his disap-
pointments, had preserved an enthusiastic attach-
ment to his profession. He always wore his
naval undress at home, and invariably, when
he dined abroad, was in full uniform. He could
not enter much into the field amusements of
the gentlemen of the neighbourhood, but he
was perfectly at hcme with them over the bottle,
and full of naval anecdotes, which he told very
circumstantially, and with much characteristic
spirit and humour. His cottage was furnished
quite professionally. As you entered the hall,
there was on a table a complete model of a
man of war. The room where he sat, which
he called his cabin, was hung with marine
paintings, pictures of naval engagements, and
portraits of celebrated admirals. Over the mantel-
piece were suspended swords, pistols, cutlasses,
tomahawks, and boarding pikes. A mariner's
compass and a telescope completed the naval
apparatus. Instead of chairs, there were camp
stools; and the table was fastened to the ground
with screws, to keep it steady in case of a hard
gale
## p. 89 (#111) #############################################
THE RED BARN
891
The Captain had a servant, the only one he
kept, who was as great an original as himself.
His name was Tom Squires, a thorough-bred old
tar, with a blind eye and wooden leg. Tom
cooked for his master, brushed his coat and shoes,
and swabbed the decks. Beds there were none
o make, for Captain Carribles and his man Tom
slept in hammocks.
When the Captain had no other company of
an evening, he relaxed a little of naval subordina-
tion, and would allow Tom to sit in the cabin
with him. There master and man used to take
their grog together, talk of old times, and roar
out sea songs in concert, until both were more
than half seas over.
But Captain Carribles' great amusement in
fine weather, consisted in making short cruises
about the coast in a small sailing boat of his own,
nicely trimmed. Tom always accompanied him
on these occasions, although, in consequence of
his wooden pin, he was of little use except to
steer.
To young Jackson, Captain Carribles took an
uncommon fancy; and Stafford, on his part,
equally liking the Captain, they soon became
uncommonly intimate. The youth would pass his
evenings with old Carribles, and soon became an
admirable proficient in grog.
He accompanied
him on his sailing excursions, and, by the instruc-
tions of the Captain and Tom Squires, very
speedily attained some insight into the theory and

practice of naval tactics : he delighted to hear
che naval anecdotes of the old sailor, and became
quite enamoured with the profession. He pes-
tered his father continually on the subject, until
the latter, through the interest of a friend, got
him rated as a midshipman on board of the Camilla
frigate, notwithstanding that his age was rather
beyond the proper time for entering the navy.
Stafford Jackson did not continue in the navy
more than four years. During this time he made
two voyages to the West Indies, and was engaged
in two actions, in which he behaved with the
greatest bravery. On his return to England, the
vessel lay for some time at Portsmouth, and after-
wards at Plymouth and Deal. In these places
Stafford got in with a very wild and dissipated
set of young fellows, and passed all his time on
shore in debauchery, drinking, and gaming. He
drew largely on his father for supplies very in-
consistent with the finances of the latter, and
was over head and ears in debt besides. His
breaches of duty became more and more frequent;
and at last he was sent to the right-about, foi
flinging a dish of fish in the face of the com
nianding officer, in a tavern at Portsmouth.
When the news of Stafford's behaviour reached
his father's ears, he was excessively enraged,
and would not suffer him to come home. The
other, indeed, had no great inclination to do so,
having acquired a most decided taste for an un-
controled life. Being, however, without money (for

91
he could get none from his father), he was obliged
to cast about for some means of existence. We
have already mentioned his talents, when a boy,
for dramatic recitation : these talents he had
exercised and improved occasionally in the Navy;
for the officers of the Camilla sometimes amused
themselves in getting up private theatricals. He
now availed himself of them as a means of sub-
sistence, or rather as a preservation from positive
want, and enlisted in a strolling company.
This mode of life he pursued for a time, and found
it wretched enough. After many vicissitudes, he
was sufficiently fortunate to make a tolerable
engagement with a country manager. He now
played the first line of light comedy, and, with a
versatility not very usual, also distinguished him-
self as a tragic actor.
His stage career, however, proved but short :
the manager, among his other theatrical apparatus,
happened to have a very beautiful wife, who was
likewise a sprightly, clever actress. Stafford
Jackson, being a very handsome and insinuating
fellow, soon got completely into this lady's good
graces : he wrought so far upon her mind, as to
persuade her to elope with him for London.
They accordingly set off together one fine morning,
--having first taken the judicious measure of
securing the contents of the manager's treasury
to defray the expenses of their journey. The
latter took the loss of his wife with philosophical
indifference; but the abstraction of his exchequer

THE RED BARY.
occasioned the breaking up of the company, as he
could not pay the actors' arrears.
Stafford Jackson now entered, for the first time,
on a London life. He soon formed a numerous
set of acquaintances, more remarkable for wit
than honesty. He passed his whole time at
cards, billiards, hazard, and "rouge et noir."
Previously to his arrival in London, he had been
no mean proficient in gaming; but he now became
completely initiated into all the mysteries of that
noble science. Stafford was not one of those
fools who trust their hopes of success to the blind
chances of fortune: he took care to ascertain the
means of fixing the wavering and capricious god-
dess; and he employed them without any scruples
of conscience.
The manager's capital, in such judicious hands,
could not fail to be considerably improved. His
fair rib continued for some time to be the
companion of Jackson ; and they lived in most
excellent style on the proceeds of his new pro-
fession.
But, alas ! human happiness is but a fleeting
shadow: Stafford Jackson soon furnished a striking
illustration of this trite remark. On returning
one night to his lodgings, he found, to his great
horror, that the fair Angelina had sheered off
in a fog under a crowd of sail, with all the move-
ables she could conveniently carry, and his entire
stock of ready cash.
This was a devil of a blow to Stafford, who

93
passed exactly two hours thirty-five minutes
and seven seconds, in cuising and damning the
entire sex. He soon, however, regained his
philosophical composure:
composure: he knew that all
searches after the fair one would, in all probabi-
lity, he fruitless; and besides, he had very potent
reasons against instituting any inquiries that might
bring him and his affairs before the public eye
Fortunately, he had about twenty pounds in his
pocket, which he had won that night, and a good
suit of clothes on his back : reflecting, then, "that
what can't be cured must be endured," he took
fresh lodgings, and determined to prosecute his
profession with increased ardour and assiduity.
Fortune consoled Stafford for the disappoint -
ment of love, and he speedily realized a few
hundred pounds: with these he made a trip to
Paris, to try his luck there, and to amuse him-
self in the French capital. He had other reasons,
too, which rendered a short absence from London,
just at this time, rather convenient than other-
wise: his face was beginning to be rather too
well known, and some of the flats were growing
rather shy of a contest with such a determined
favourite of fortune.
Stafford did not meet with all the success in
Paris that he anticipated: he found many there who
were just as clever as himself, and who met him
on equal terms. He was forced very frequently
to play "upon the square;" and the consequence
was, that fortune treated him in the same way

34
TIE RED BARN
that she does other people: he lost as often as he
won, and began to find that his finances were
rapidly declining.
He now changed his plan of operations. Quit-
ting altogether the public gaming-tables of the
Palais Royal, Frescati, &c., he devoted his
entire attention to cultivating the acquaintance
of the English in Paris. By his gentlemanly
exterior and insinuatiny manners, he succeeded
in conciliating their intimacy; and soon made up,
by private play, what he had lost by public.
It was at this time that Stafford became ac-
quainted with the incomparable Captain Creeu:
he had seen him at the gaming tables, and was
not long in observing that he might be made
very useful assistant for his own purposes.
Creed's appearance and situation, precluded the
possibility of Jackson treating him on a footing of
equality in public; it would excite suspicion, and
prove equally injurious to both. He, therefore, pro-
posed that Creed should act as his servant: the
latter readily agreed to this. Jackson clothed
him in a handsome livery, and master and man
lived famously for a while on the united produce
of their ingenuity and industry.
But an accident soon occurred which rendered
the climate of Paris rather too warm for the con-
stitution of Stafford Jackson. A
young
officer in
the English army, the son of a nobleman, lost a
very considerable sum to him one night, playing
at the game of ecart. A gentleman present, who

THE RED BARN..
was a very attentive spectator of the play, took
the young man aside, and told him that he would
be very wrong to pay the money, for he had
no doubt that all was not fair: the young officer
returned to the table, accused Jackson of foul
play, and refused to pay the cash. It was in
vain that the other stormed, and swore, and
bullied : it ended by the officer putting into his
pocket the pack of cards which had been provided
by our friend Captain Creed, and, walking off,
declared that he would expose the affair all over
Paris.
Jackson, and his worthy valet de chambre,
knew too well that the cards would not stand the
test of examination, and were far too prudent to
await the result: they got their passports made
out immediately for London. Before they set off,
however, Stafford paid a visit to a gentleman of
property, residing at St. Cloud, and told him that
he was going to England, and would be happy to
execute any commands. The gentleman, who,
of course, had heard nothing of the true cause of
Jackson's departure, said that it occurred very
fortunately; that he wanted to send a carriage
to England, and would be much obliged to his
friend Mr. Jackson, if he would take charge of it
The latter, it may be well believed, did not
hesitate: he, and his right hand man, the captain,
travelled in the carriage to Calais; brought it
over; and when they arrived in London, sold it
immediately, and divided the proceeds.

THE RED BARY.
Stafford Jackson was obliged to keep himself
remarkably close while he remained in London:
therefore he took lodgings in an obscure part of
town, and dropping the name of Jackson, called
himself Mr. Stafford. He had a good sum of
money about him, but had not yet made up his mind
what line of conduct to pursue: he felt the necessity
of absenting himself for some time from London,
where he could not possibly carry on operations at
present with any safety; but he could not deter-
mine to what quarter he should steer his course.
While he was in this state of indecision, he
went one evening to regale himself in an obscure
pot-house in the neighbourhood : there he met
with a seafaring man, an American, and entered
inte conversation with him. The American spoke
much of his own country, vaunted loudly of her
riches and independence, and particularly dwelt
on the wealth and splendor of New York and
Philadelphia. Stafford Jackson listened to him
with great attention, and determined in his own
mind on a voyage to America.
He soon got every thing in readiness, and within
ten days was on his passage from Liverpool to
New York.
Stafford Jackson found the New Yorkites, how-
ever unpleasant in many points, to be fully as
much attatched to gaming as he could possibly
desire : but, like the Parisians, they were tolerably
old hands; and our hero did not reap among them
a very plentiful harvest. He was, however, no

97
loser; and as he could not think of returning to
England so soon, he was about to make the tour
of the United States, when a circumstance oc-
curred which altered his determination.
It is not easy for the most peaceably disposed
subject to mix much in New York society with-
out having a duel upon his hands. It
may,
there-
fore, be well supposed that Stafford Jackson,
among
whose vices fear was not to be numbered,
did not escape the usual ordeal. He was called
out by an American Colonel and fishmonger, in
consequence of a dispute arising out of a game of
cards. He went to the field accompanied by an
Englishman, who called himself Captain Brown:
when he arrived there, he found the piscatory
Colonel waiting for him, armed with a blunderbuss
loaded with slugs. Captain Brown attempted to
remonstrate with him about the unfairness of this,
but to no purpose. "Oh! damn the scoundrel," said
Stafford Jackson ; "let him keep his blunderbuss.'
They fired; the fishmonger lodged two slugs
in Jackson's left shoulder, and the latter shot his
adversary through the heart, who instantly dropped
dead upon the spot.
This affair led to a very close intimacy between
Brown and Jackson. The former was a man
about forty years of age, of short stature but
herculean make, with an enormous pair of black
mustachios. This man had received a captain's
commission from the Mexican government, and
had fitted out a small armed vessel to cruise in
O

TILE RED BARV.
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, where he trusted
very soon to be enabled to repay his
expenses
He had come to New York for the purpose of
engaging some additional hands.
As soon as Captain Brown had learned that
Jackson had been in the navy, he asked him to
join him, and offered to make him his second in
command. " We give no pay," said he, "but
there will be a fair division of prizes, and plenty
of them." The proposal was too much to Jack-
son's taste not to accept of it. His wounds were
soon cured, and he and the Captain embarked
and put out to sea immediately.
The crew of this vessel was equally worthy of
the commander and his lieutenant, and of the
peculiar character of the service on which it was
employed. It was a pleasing melange of outcasts
and vagabonds of different nationsMexicans,
North Americans, English, Mulattos, and Blacks.
" These rascals," said Brown, "fight well, but
I have the devil's work to keep them in order."
Well accustomed as Jackson had been, in London
and elsewhere, to the sight of ruffians, he was a
little startled at the first appearance of these
gentry: they realized all that imagination had ever
painted of bandits and pirates.
Jackson soon found that his friend, Captain
Brown, by no means confined his attention
exclusively to the enemies of the Mexican empire.
He was, in fact, no very scrupulous respecter of
neutrality, and paid much more regard to the

99
size and strength of the vessels he met with, thar.
to their national colours. The flag of the United
States, indeed, formed an exception to this rule-
for the best of reasons. Brown knew too well
that the American government would soon find
the means of punishing his infraction of neutrality,
and that he would also lose the principal, if not
the only, market for the disposal of his prizes.
With Captain Brown, Stafford Jackson remained
for nearly two years, during which period they
had several sharp affairs with Spanish vessels,
and committed a vast number of piratical as well
as privateering acts. They had even the audacity
to make two or three descents on different parts
of the Spanish coast, plundering and murdering
for the space of some miles, and then returning to
their vessel.
During their courses they made many good
prizes, and accumulated a good deal of money.
Their conquests, too, were generally made without
any very great expense of blood, as they generally
engaged with vessels of much inferior strength :
sometimes, however, they met with an unexpected
resistance. They attacked a merchant vessel
from Alicant, which, instead of striking imme-
diately, as they expected, saluted them with a
volley, and maintained for a little time a tolerable
fight. It was, however, obliged at last to give in,
and the master and crew, consisting in all of only
eight hands, paid the forfeit of their imprudent
bravery with their lives.

But this affair proved fatal to Captain Brown
He was wounded in his right groin, and died in
two days after, in great agony. Jackson conducted
the vessel to America, and disposed of the cargo
at Boston.
Stafford Jackson now found himself worth three
or four thousand pounds in ready cash. He resolved
to quit the trade of piracy, and return to England,
there to make some inquiries about his father.
He left his vessel and crew at Boston, who, had
they known of his intentions, would not have
parted with him so easily, and travelled by land
to New York, where he embarked for England.
As soon as he landed he set off for his father's
residence in Suffolk. Not being quite certain
of meeting with a favourable reception, he did
not go to his father's house directly, but waited
upon his old friend, Captain Carribles, whom he
intended to employ as a mediator in his favour.
He found the old boy exactly as he left him, in
no wise altered by the lapse of years. He still
retained his foreman, Tom Squires, who seemed
to stand the best of time as well as his master.
Carribles at first did not recognize Stafford, he
was so much altered; but when he told him who
he was, he shook him warmly by the hand, at
the same time alluding, with regret, to his early
conduct. Stafford told him a long and plausible
tale of his adventures, and concluded with say-
ing that he had now realized some property by com-
mercial transactions, and was returned for the

THE RED BARN.
101
purpose of being reconciled with his father, and
sharing his fortune with him. Old Carribles
readily undertook the office of mediator, and
easily prevailed on Jackson's father to receive his
son again.
Stafford's father did not long enjoy the fruits
of reconciliation. He died soon after, leaving
his property (not very considerable) to his son,
who, however improved it by marrying a young
lady in the neighbourhood, with a fortune of two
thousand pounds.
One would have imagined, that Stafford would
have now settled himself down to something like
a regular and respectable course of life. For a
while, indeed, he appeared inclined to do so.
His wife was an amiable woman, and he seemed,
at least, to be attached to her. But his natural
disposition, and the inveterate influence of habit,
proved stronger than her attractions and his own
original resolutions. He began to find himselt
like a fish out of water, and to long for a renewal
of his former irregularities. His was one of those
constitutions to which the stimulus of difficulty
and danger seemed absolutely indispensable.
He seemed as incapable of existing without it,
as the habitual drunkard without his usual
excitement.
He began by making frequent trips to London,
under some pretext or other.
There he recom-
menced his career of vice and dissipation, and
soon got rid of the principal part of the muncy he

had gained abroad, as well as his wife's fortune,
He at last scarcely ever past any time at home,
with the exception of coming down for the pur-
pose
of receiving his quarter's rents, which having
done, he would return to town immediately. His
wife's health, naturally delicate, at last totally
gave way under a series of neglects and insults,
and his repeated and notorious infidelities. She
died of a consumption in little more than twelve
months after their unfortunate union.
Jackson was now pretty nearly at the end of
all his ready cash. His property, however, near
Ipswich, yet remained, and with moderate
habits would have sufficed for his subsistence;
but for his wants it was totally inadequate. He
therefore disposed of it for a sum of money to a
merchant desirous of retiring from business, and
recommenced his precarious and unprincipled
mode of life.
About this time Stafford became acquainted
with our friend Jack Smith, whom we have
already introduced to the reader's notice.
Jack was one of those thorough-paced knaves
that nature seldom produces in complete perfec-
tion. He was unredeemed by the slightest
semblance of any thing like a virtue, unless we
can honour the courage of a ruffian with such a
title. He was the son of a Suffolk cotter, and
having evinced very early an extraordinary pre-
cocity in wickedness, at the age of twelve begar.

robbed him, and ran away to London. Here he
formed suitable and congenial connexions, and
soon became a thief and pickpocket of the most
expert kind. As he ran risks of every description,
all his cleverness could not extricate him out of
serious scrapes. His feet became familiar with
the stocks, and his neck with the pillory. He had
sojourned in Bridewell and the Hulks, and taken
no less than two short trips to the Antipodes.
At the time of which we are now writing, Jack
Smith was connected with a desperate gang of
smugglers down in Suffolk; but he did not, on
that account, relinquish his system of land .
robbing Between the town and country, he
contrived to drive a very flourishing trade. He
was married, and under his house near Polstead he
had a cavern, which was a grand dept for his
spoliations of all kinds.
This accomplished gentleman was known uni-
versally among his companions by the soubriquet
of Beauty Smith,-given him, not in reference to
any physical peculiarities, but to the purity and
moral excellence of his life and character.
At his suggestion, Jackson united himself to
the smugglers, among whom was president
Warren, aforementioned, and by his courage,
naval experience, and superiority of intellect,
soon acquired over them a complete ascendancy.
He was, indeed, eminently calculated to com-
mand desperadoes of any kind : he knew how

both to conciliate their attachment and insure
their respect.
As the period to which we allude was pre-
vious to the establishment of the preventive
service, Jackson and his friends drove a famous
trade. He passed his time between making
smuggling trips, and carrying on in London the
business of swindling in general. When down in
Suffolk, he had accidently seen Maria Marten, or
whom he became enamoured; and, perhaps, it is
almost superfluous to inform our readers, that the
gentleman with the white hat, whom she met at
the fair, and his companion, were no other than
our good friends, Mr. Stafford Jackson, and Mr
John, alias Beauty, Smith.
Such was the foundation on which the innocent
victim of superstition built all her hopes of future
fortune!

with no great expansion of mind, and less know-

education was of that description which such

for centuries, was a main power in producing
England's boasta wealthy and happy farmer-

tion of the young English farmers, exercise so
beneficial an influence on such persons as is
commonly imagined. Without imparting a much
greater quantum of really neful knowledge, the
sort of education to which we allude, is calcu-
lated to produce tastes, and foster propensities,
which are not in the strictest unison with the
peculiar destinies of such people. It is often
adapted to create a dissatisfaction with their rank
in life, and a love of expensive enjoyment above
their sphere, and too often fatal to their true
interests and happiness. It is too often adapted
to detach them from the path of steady industry,
by which alone their success in life can be insured.
Pleasures incompatible with their resources be-
come necessary to their existence, and they have
recourse to means of procuring them alike incon-
sistent with integrity and safety.
William Barnard, with the narrow intellect
and superficial education we have mentioned, was
a man of strong passions and strong mental im-
pulses. These, however, did not display them-
selves in short and violent ebullitions, but rather
operated with permanence and regularity. He
seemed, indeed, incapable of any sudden strong
impression; however, an impression once made was
not easily effaced, but proved a lasting motive to
action Such a character, when its impulses receive
a rignt direction, is capable of much good; and un-

fortunately, when the reverse is the case, is equally
capable of much evil.
His personal appearance was by no means
above his situation in life; nor was it, perhaps,
equal to it, if we take robust health, athletic
proportions, and frankness of demeanour as the
standard. He was below the middle size, lightly
made, and possessed a gloominess and repulsive-
ness of countenance, rarely to be seen in men of
fair and ruddy complexion such as he was.
Barnard rose on the morning following the
night we have described, with his head as little
benefited by the drinking of the previous evening,
as his pocket was by the gaming. He was not
much pleased with the result of the latter, which
left him minus all his ready cash ; but he never
for a moment suspected any foul play on the part
of his worthy friends, and consoled himself with
the recollection, that he was to receive 250 that
morning for the sale of a quantity of corn belonging
to his father. He dressed himself, and coming
down stairs, found his good friends, the all-accom-
plished Stafford Jackson and the amiable Mr.
Beauty Smith, waiting breakfast for him.
* Good morrow, Mr. Barnard," said Jackson ;
"how have you rested last night?"
"But badly," replied Barnard; "my head and
stomach are not all right this morning."
"Allow me to be your doctor, Mr. Barnard,"
said Stafford; "I prescribe to you a bottle of
Boda water, with a glass of brandy in it: nothing

so famous after a night's debauch : it's my regular
morning's dose, without which I can do no busi-
ness."
"Well," said Beauty Smith, "every one to their
taste; for my part, I find the brandy do as well
without soda water
Barnard, however, thought proper to follow the
prescription of Jackson, who, contrary to the ap-
proved practice of physicians, took a dose of his
own medicine; while Jack Smith, with his un-
sophisticated taste, swallowed two glasses of
brandy in its native strength and purity.
Now my gentlemen sat down to breakfast, and
here their different tastes and characters appeared.
Stafford Jackson would have nothing but strong
coffee, a devilled mackarel, finishing with a small
glass of brandy; Barnard breakfasted on tea,
toast, and eggs; while Jack Smith demolished
half a side of a huge buttock of beef, which he
washed down with one quart of the best triple X.
Being each of them now fortified in his peculiai
way, Jackson said to Barnard,
"Well, Mr. Barnard, I will not ask how you
like London, you have seen too little of it yet; and
certainly that little is not calculated to make you
much in love with it. I fear, like myself, you were
something of a loser last night."
" Oh! don't mention it," says Barnard; a trifle
-a mere trifle."
"How much?" said Jackson.
Only thirty pounds," said Barnard.

"I am sorry for your loss," replied the other,
" though I myself lost more in betting on you.
That cursed fellow, old Warren, is always in high
luck. By the bye, I shall have to hand him over
five-and-thirty."
"That's nothing for a man of your property,
Jackson," dryly observed Beauty.
"Not a great deal, to be sure," said Jackson ;
" but more than I ought to lose :you know I am
depending on the old fellow."
* Old Harry, I suppose," said Smith, sotto voce;
then aloud, "Oh, he'll open his purse strings.
What the devil are these rich old fathers for, but
to supply us young chaps with the needful ?-eh!
Barnard, my boy, what say you ?"
"I am entirely of your opinion," replied Barnard.
"Right, my dear boy," said Beauty, "and
I
say, my old cock, we'll show you a little
of London life to-day.-Eh! Jackson, what say
you-shall we take our friend Barnard the rounds
now,
to-day?"
"I shall feel most happy," replied Jackson,
"in contributing to Mr. Barnard's amusement
while he remains in townif," he added, bowing,
"if he has no objection, and is not better engaged."
"Oh," said Barnard, "I am your man; there's
nothing I wish more than to see the varieties of
London life. I have nothing to do except to call
on my father's old salesman for 250, and then i
am quite at your service."
" Then let us consult," said Jackson, " how

110
THE RED BARN.
we shall pass the day ;-the forenoon is rather
dull; how can we get on until dinner ?"
"Why," said Smith, "there will be good fun
to-day, at the Fives Court.
It is for Scroggins'
benefit,some prime bang-up sparring I can
assure you."
Very good," replied Jackson ; "the very
thing: it will amuse our friend greatly; who, as
a countryman, must be fond of all manly athletic
exercises."
" There's nothing I delight in more," said
Barnard.
" Then, Mr. Barnard," said Jackson, "I pro-
mise you a great treat. You shall see some noble
specimens of the science of self-defence. Who
are to be there, Jack, to-day ?"
" Why," replied Jack, "there's Neate and Scrog-
'ins, Cropley and Young Sam, Harry Holt and
Tack Randal, Spring, Langan, and Whiteheaded
Bob,--in short, all the prime lads of the fancy."
" Bravo!" exclaimed Jackson ; "we shall have
some good sport."
" Then let us toddle," said Beauty.
Off they set; and Barnard could not help
observing how very differently Jackso appeared
from what he did on the prtceding night:
he was what is technically termed knowingly
toggedquite in the sporting style.
He wore a
very well made whitish drab surtout, with one
small
cape, a velvet collar, and lined through with
silk. This, though appearing to be a top-coat, was
## p. 111 (#133) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
111
in fact, a regular body coat made to fit tightly, and
show the figure. He wore white cord breeches
and handsome top-boots-a coloured handkerchief
round his neck, with the ends falling down a
little in front. A white hat completed his costume,
and he carried in his hand a small ash switch.
Beauty Smith was habited as he was the night
before.
They first went to where the old salesman
lived, where Barnard entered alone, Jackson and
his friend remaining in the street, as they thought
upon the whole that it was more consistent with
prudence not to make their appearance.  They
knew nothing of the man, it is true, but then it
was just barely possible that he might know
something of them, and might give Barnard some
friendly hints touching the taking qualifications
of his new associates. Indeed, to an old and
knowing hand, their very appearance, especially
that of Beauty, might inspire a very salutary
distrust of the fitness of such companions for a
young country farmer. All these considerations
naturally suggested themselves to the minds of
experienced and reflecting men like Stafford and
his worthy compeer.
Good generals in every
point of view, they were not less cautious in
avoiding an ambuscade and securing a retreat,
than they were bold in pushing for a probable
victory, and prompt in following up a successful
blow.
When they arrived at the Fives Court, the

company had already begun to assemble. It was
of the usual description, consisting of flats and
sharps, pigeons and rooks, gentlemen amateurs
and professional pugilists, young men of fortune
who are anxious to get rid of their money, and
men of no fortune equally anxious to get hold of
it. The former influenced by the ambition of
distinguishing themselves as men of taste and
fancy; the latter once ruined by the same am.
bition, but now living by the fruits of their
experience.
"On commence par etre dupe, on finit par etre
fripon," is a proverb applicable to all men who
engage in the ruinous career of gaming, of what-
ever kind, whether on the turf, in the prize-ring,
or at any games of chance or skill, where money
is depending. The only exception to this rule, is
when they have resolution enough to withdraw
themselves from such pursuits in time to preserve
a sufficiency to live on, or to engage in more
honourable pursuits : but it too generally happens,
that when a young man has lost all his money,
the fascination of his former habits still continues,
and perhaps operates even more strongly than
ever. He cannot quit the scenes of his losses
and his disgrace, but continues to haunt them as
the ghosts of misers are fabled to hover round the
places where their treasures have been buried.
He is led to inquire into the causes of his ruin
and having ascertained them, to put them is
operation upon others. He is led to associate

113
with sharpers and with swindlers, to study their
arts, and to practise their deceptions; and when
he has lost all, he cannot, like the gallant
nionarch of France, have the consolation to except
his honour.
There are, indeed, a few lofty spirits, whose
career will not exactly admit of the application
of the proverb. Those gifted geniuses commence,
continue, and conclude, "par tre fripons,"
having from infancy some peculiar lumps or
bumps, the nomenclature of which we leave to
Messrs. Gall and Spurzheim,--they exhibit
always a decided propensity for cheating, and an
adequate capacity in its theory and practice: if
they ever fail to cheat, the goodness of their
intentions cannot be called in question ;-either
circumstances render an occasional observance of
honesty expedient, or short-sightedness prevents
them from using the opportunity of deceiving. Such
men were the honourable Captain Creed and the
amiable Mr. Beauty Smith. These men would
cheat under all circumstances, and their friends
and companions were just as liable to be plundered
by them as anybody else.
Such, however, was not altogether Stafford
Jackson,-he was of a higher order: he had, it is
true, commenced the business of imposition so
very early, that it became to him a second nature.
But he had many redeeming qualities with all
bis bad ones: he would not exercise bis p
fession at the expense of an associate of h*

kind, or even of any man whom he liked, nr to
whom he was under any obligation. There was
also a dash of chivalry and romance about his
character, which rendered mere common swin-
dling and sharping not altogether to his taste,
notwithstanding his practice of them.
He had a
natural disdain for every thing on a petty and
sordid scale. As indicative of intellect, he hated
little frauds, but admired great ones. Under
similarly favourable circumstances, he could have
hoaxed an entire nation like as Law did the French.
In the corrupt times of the Roman republic, he
could have figured like Catiline, whom he resem-
bled in his inordinate taste for vicious pleasures
and expense, his total want of principle, his daring
courage, and his extraordinary flexibility. In
more lawless times, and more lawless countries,
he would have been the formidable leader of
a band of robbers : in the court of a Charles, he
would have been like Rochester or Buckingham.
In England, in the year 18, he was a smuggler,
a sharper, and a rou.
Disdaining, however, petty transactions, and
not being devoid of generous sentiments, Stafford
Jackson would not have willingly lent himself to
the ruin of a young country lad like Barnard,
merely for the sake of the gain which might
accrue to himself from the transaction. But he
felt the necessity of binding to himself such asso-
ciates as Creed and Smith : he could not do
without them ;there were many things which

115
converse
he either could not, or would not, perform him-
self, in which such men were useful instruments.
He, in fact, considered the generality of men
either as his tools or victims; and no man
possessed better the talent of conciliating each
peculiar character. He had a Proteus-like facility
of changing the phases of his manners and con-
versation. With gentlemen he could be a perfect
gentleman, with blackguards a complete black-
guard ; to the learned he could talk of literature,
to the fair of love; with the politician he could
on politics, with the merchant on
business. He was an adept in the mysteries of
the prize-ring, and a cultivator of poetry and
music. In short, he suited himself to the peculiar
disposition, information, and profession, of every
It was thus that by his courage, rough
bearing, and naval dialect, he won the attachment
of Warren; by his cleverness, quickness, and wit
in roguery, he gained the esteem of Creed ; and
by his pretended total want of every right and
natural feeling, that he obtained the regard of the
amiable and interesting Beauty Smith.
At the Fives Court this day, there was some
capital sparring, which highly enchanted Barnard,
but of which it is not necessary to trouble our
readers with a minute description. The merits of
the various great men who have done such im-
mortal honour to our country in the prize-ring
and Fives Court, and the mysteries of the noble
science, have been recorded by abl
man.

ours, in the inperishable annals of pugilism.
Lo! are not the same written in the chronicles of
Pierce and Vincent? It would be presumptuous
in us to infringe on the province of these great
historians, and vain to emulate their excellence.
We neither possess their profound knowledge of
the subject, nor the incomparable eloquence with
which they can adorn it. The task is far above
us-far, indeed, above all but themselves. The
harmonious name of Scroggins should never sound
in any verse but the mellifluous metres of the one,
nor roll through any prose but the sonorous periods
of the other. None but Homer or Pindar should
chant the achievements of heroes and of gods.
Still, though we refrain with pious awe from
touching the mysteries of the science, we may
be permitted to offer such remarks on the general
effects of its practice as suggest themselves very
obviously to the uninitiated observer.
not be denied that the art of sparring is in itself
both elegant and healthful. It is admirably
calculated to develope the muscles, and to expand
the chest,--to give rectitude to the carriage and
vigour to the frame. The whole business of
training is also improving to the constitution and
general health of the individual. Nor, as an
useful art, is the art of self-defence with the
weapons with which nature has provided us to
be despised. Unfortunately, it may sometimes
be expedient to know it, and necessarv to exert
it, in a metropolis like London. We
We may add
It can-

that its general prevalence may be useful in
equalizing the contests which must occur among
the lower orders.
But when we have said all this, we have said
all that can with truth and consistency be alleged
in favour of pugilism. That it has any tendency
to improve the national courage, is merely visionary.
Englishmen were just as brave before the intro-
duction of pugilism, as they are at present.
No
one will deny that the heroes of Agincourt and
Cressy were as brave as those of Salamanca,
Vittoria, and Waterloo. But what sets this
question at rest at once, is the fact that the latter
were as little indebted to the pugilistic art as the
former,- for the best of all reasons, that the vast
majority of them knew just as little about it.
Moreover, we have been told by experienced
officers, that the few pugilists who had enlisted
in their regiments proved in general the worst
soldiers,
Indeed, on the question of courage we might
naturally expect that pugilism would exercise an
effect totally different from what has been stated.
True courage can be exerted only on occasions
where the danger is great, and the mutual powers
of resistance are at least fully equal. This may
sometimes be the case in the prize-ring; but rarely,
if ever, so in common life. It requires but little
courage to engage in a contest, under the influ-
ence of a confidence inspired by our own strength,
activity, and skill, and in the consciousness that

the result cannot be fatal. Very different is the
feeling, only worthy of the name of courage,
which, produced by intellectual discipline, bears
its possessor calmly through scenes of peril and
of death, conscious of his risk, and conscious of
his weakness.
But though pugilism cannot inspire true courage,
it may foster a feeling very different and very
pernicious. It may feed a quarrelsome spirit,
and give occasion to the exercise of brutal fero-
city. The man who has great confidence in his
own strength and skill, will not always be very
slow to provoke a conflict, where he is almost
certain of victory, nor can the by-standers
always interpose effectually to prevent the unfair
contention. They may stop its progress some-
times, without being able to prevent its com-
mencement from being seriously detrimental to the
unequal adversary.
But the great and crying evil which has arisen
out of pugilism, is its having been made the
vehicle of gaming.
This it is which has so
degraded the character of its professors, and
communicated so strong a tinge of depravity to
all connected with it. A prize-fighter may think
as highly of himself as he pleases, but a race-
horse is incomparably the superior animal of the
two. The latter is influenced only by a generous
emulation of superiority. If he be made the
instrument of the sordid purposes of man, it is
without his concurrence, and he participates not

THE RED BARN.
119
in the debasing gain. The image of the Creator,
and the divine gift of reason, are not obliterated
and perverted in him. But the pugilist hires out
his strength and skill for sale voluntarily; which
would not be degrading, were they exerted for
one useful purpose, but which produce no other
result than degradation to himself, and the most
fatal mischief to society.
Look at the countenances, hear the language,
and observe the line of life, of the professors and
amateurs of pugilism, and who will have the
audacity to declare that their profession and pur-
suits are innocent and useful? If any illustration
were needed of the evil tendencies of the pugilistic
profession, surely we have it in the manners and
conduct of those who cultivate it! The first are
characterized by grossness and vulgarity, the
second by profligacy and want of principle. Let
any man, if he be fearless of contamination, stroll
through the various recesses of midnight and
morning debauchery, with which this mighty
Babylon is infested, in spite of the integrity and
vigilance of the police, and the sapient sagacity of
our pinguified magistrates; who is he most
certain to find there ?-Pugilists, or the amateurs
of pugilism, with their inseparable companions,
--prostitutes, sharpers, and thieves. How many
of the professors and amateurs have fallen pre-
mature victims to the vices and excesses in which
their pursuit would appear inevitably to involve
them!

THE RED BARN
It is become matter of perfect notoriety, that
the battles of the prize-ring are now generally
pre-arranged as to who shall win and who shal
lose, so that the flats must be " gammoned," and
the sharps come off triumphant. This we do not
regret, as it may prove the means of putting i
period to the evil. But what other result could
be expected from men of the lowest birth, of
no education, of profligate habits, and desperate
fortunes, but that they should unhesitatingly sell
themselves to the highest bidder ?
It has been said that pugilism keeps up the
spirit of the people, and the corollary drawn from
this is, that prize-fighting is necessary to keep up
the spirit of pugilism. We have already answered
the first position: but, granting that it were
desirable to keep up this pugnacious temper, we
deny that the periodical exhibitions of the prize-
ring are necessary for that purpose. Man, un-
fortunately, is too well inclined for the said
pugnacity, to need any such incentive. Ay, but,
say our opponents, if you remove pugilism, you
introduce the knife and dagger, as in Portugal
and Italy; or you have a dozen men trampling
upon one, as in France and elsewhere; or the ex-
quisite gouging of the eyes, as in Connecticut.
No, no!-Englishmen have never been a nation of
assassins and cowards.
In all that we have said of pugilism and its pro-
fessors, be it remembered that we allow there are
some honourable exceptions ; but there are very

121
ew in number: still, their conduct is worthy of
the greater credit, when we consider what is, and
must be, the almost inevitable tendency of their
profession.
To return from this, not perhaps unnecessary
digression :-on the different" turn-ups" that took
place this day at the Fives Court, there was
betting to a considerable amount. Our worthy
acquaintance, Captain Creed, was there, and as
be knew well how to bet, was, we dare say, no
loser. Barnard, as might be expected, was no
gainer : he was eased of twenty pounds by his
friends,one, as usual, appearing to lose while the
others won.
Jackson, Beauty, and Barnard, now left the
Fives Court. It was yet early, and Creed pro-
posed to adjourn somewhere for refreshment.
They accordingly went to a tavern not a hundred
miles from the east end of Holborn, kept by a
noted pugilist. When they sat down, they ob-
served two men in the farther corner of the room,
busily employed in drinking ale and tossing
shillings. When our friends came in, they stopped,
and one of them, who recognized Creed as an
acquaintance, saluted him. He was a stout and
portly looking man, about thirty or upwards, with
a florid complexion, and rather good-humoured
handsome countenance. Some conversation en-
sued, and this man asked Creed to join in the
game. Creed said he had no objection to toss for
a bottle of ale, but declined playing for money:

tions to play for half-crowns.
No, Mr. Pinks," replied Creed, "I never toss
for money."
"Will you, gentlemen ?" said the other, ad-
dressing Jackson, Smith, and Barnard.
The former two declined.
"I have no objection," said Barnard, in whom
the ale had begun to inspire some confidence.
The other three, who did not choose that a
stranger should have any of their pickings, strongly
dissuaded him.
Barnard seemed still inclined, and was rising
to move to the other table, when Jackson sprung
up, and seizing him by the arm-

very wrong ;you don't know London, I must
request-nay, I must insist, that
I must insist, that you will forbear.
I will not suffer you to toss with a stranger."
Barnard, over-awed by his manner, sat down.
" Stranger," replied the man who was thus
designated; "I am no stranger to some of you. I
suppose you have caught a flat among you, and
want to keep him all to yourselves."
"Scoundrel !" exclaimed Jackson, "how dare
you cast such an imputation ?
"Oh!returned the other, " don't scoundrel me,
---the name becomes yourself better; and if you
continue this impudence, I'll soon kick you out
of the room."

* Boasting liar ! I'll soon show you the differ-
ence," exclaimed Jackson; and jumping over the
table, with the quickness of lightning struck him
under the right eye. The other was not slow
in retorting, and a regular set-to was about to take
place, when the landlord entered.
Gentlemen," said he, "this room is no place
for fighting-among all these chairs and benches:
I don't know what your quarrel may be, but my
maxim is, when gentlemen can't make up matters
amicably, to let them have it out;they are
always better friends afterwards. I have got a long
room up stairs, in which you may amuse your-
selves if you have a mind ;these gentlemen and
myself will see fair play."
"Come along then," roared out both the com-
batants.
Up stairs they went, and a regular scientific
battle took place. Jackson's antagonist was
rather the superior in size and weight, and exhi-
bited no small degree of pugilistic skill; but the
other was both more active and muscular, equally
scientifie in defence, had better wind, and was a
quicker hitter.
There was a great deal of fine
play on both sides, and for a time the contest
seemed nearly equal. At last Jackson planted
several hits in succession with the rapidity of
lightning, the last of which staggered his adver-
sary,
who fell into the arms of his friend and
seconder. He seemed to be rather exhausted, and
to want wind.
## p. 124 (#146) ############################################
124
THE RED BARN,
I am.
"I will wait for you, Mr. Pinks," said Jackson.
"Now gentlemen," said the landlord, "let me
interfere. You have both done as prettily as
possible-you could not do better had you been
my own pupils. I think you ought, therefore, to
be satisfied and shake hands. I like to see a neat
set-to, but not too much of it."
Said Jackson, "If the gentleman be satisfied,
If he choose to have more, I'm ready."
"No, Mr.Jackson," replied the other, advancing,
" you are a brave man. Give me your hand-I
am sorry for what I said."
"I can return the compliment as to bravery,"
said Jackson, shaking hands with him ; "and I
wish nothing better than to be friends with you.
So come, and let us drown our disputes over a
bottle, at my expense."
"With all my heart," returned Pinks; so down
stairs they went.
In the passage the following conversation took
place between the antagonists, who let the others
precede them.
" But I say, my good friend," said Stafford,
you should not poach on a neighbour's manor.'
" Pooh! pooh!" said the other; "say no more
of that. I did not mean to poach, but I thought
we might just toss a little for amusement."
"Oh! damn your innocence," exclaimed Jack-
son; "I know what your tossing for amusement
is. Is there
Is there a man in London can toss with
you
?
Haven't you made it as certain as sun-rise ?

your hands."
The other laughed, and then asked him, where
he had hooked his fish ?
"He's none of my hooking," replied Jackson;
" Beauty was the bait he bit at. But I'll tell
you more to-night, if you come to Grubb's, or the
Finish: in the mean time, mum's the word."
These two worthies (who, as it appears, knew
each other perfectly well,) now entered a little room
behind the bar, and the whole party sat down to
ale and sandwiches, and lunched heartily. Jack-
son then called for a bottle of wine, and drinking
Pinks' bealth, said " Well, Mr. Pinks, here's may
we never meet again in anger; for damn me if I
don't think I got very well out of
"1 may say the same to you," replied the
other.
" Well, well," said Stafford, "I should not
like to repeat the experiment."
Thus it was that Jackson conciliated every
man. He always threw his own merits into the
back ground, and brought forward those of others.
Thus, in this contest, though he had the most
decided advantage, (and had it continued, his
adversary's short wind must have determined in
his favour,) yet he chose to give the whole glory
to his opponent. If he thought highly of himself,
he kept it to himself; for though he had much
pride, he had little vanity.
Our party having finished lunch, Jackson pro-
posed to pass away the time at billiards, until
dinner.

THE RED BARN.
" But where shall we dine?" demanded Smith.
"At the Sablonniere,' in Leicester Square,
replied Jackson; "you like a foreign dinner, Cap-
V tain Creed."
" That I do," said Creed, with a gastronomie
chuckle.
"Well," said Jackson, "as we are showing
our friend here life in London,' we will also
show him a spice of French living in London.
Mr. Pinks, will you and your friend be of our
party ?"
"I will," said Pinks," with pleasure; but my
friend is engaged."
"Well, Smith," said Jackson, "go you to the
Sablonniere, and order a crack dinner for five,
at half past six o'clock. A private room, do you
mind. And I say, my dear fellow, will you call at
the Gloucester, Piccadilly, and tell them to send
a portmanteau, which was left there for me, down
to Leicester Square, and you can return to us at
the billiard-rooms ?"
"No," replied Smith, "I can't return, for I
have to look after some matters of my own; but I
shall meet you at dinner."
Beauty accordingly went his way. Mr. Pinks'
friend took his leave, and the other four proceeded
to the billiard-rooms together.
The rooms were crowded, as usual, with well
dressed scamps of all kinds, and fools of every
variety of calibre. There was my Lord Roger
Komberkin, and honest Tom Ewer, who differed

in nothing except that one had a title to an estate,
and the other a title to the gallows. In exterior,
in actual property, in virtuous inclinations, and
in understanding, they were quite upon a par.
But my Lord Roger had not shaved the wind
quite so close as honest Tom, whose neck was
once deemed in reasonable danger from the slight
mistake of signing another man's name for him.
But Tom assured all his friends, upon his honour,
that it was done only to save the gentleman
trouble. Tom was believed by one third of the
world, disbelieved by another, and doubted by
another. Fools thought it was truth, knaves
knew it was a lie, and wise men doubted the
fact. Tom, however, jogged on merrily, and
stood cheek by jowl with my Lord Roger Kom-
berkin, as accomplished a gentleman as himself.
There was also the Honourable Stanley Atherton,
who yielded to no man as a horse-jockey or a
player of billiards and ecart. There was little Tom
Higgins, with his green breechesan unrivalled
flyer of kites ; Captain O'Brien, whose brogue
and boots were equally nate; Sir Harry Beaver,
who was bottle-holder to Lord Dwhen he
fought with the Duke of A fifteen rounds
for a thousand guineas, by way of lark, in C-
House. There were the twin brothers, one lite-
rary and the other divine : the literary hero, a
" "fellow in foolscap turned up with ink," a cogger
of other men's thoughtsthe divine a blue-bottle
parson, who preached other men's sermons, and

one of the blessed "unpaid." There was P. G. H.
a decided greenhorn, and T. H. a decided black-
leg. There was the celebrated family of the
Eusthathioi, true western Greeks.
There was
old Lord Cogham, famous for throwing sixes at
backgammon by chance ; and Captain Carne,
one of the real sowls for either macing or malleting.
In short, they were all partly knaves and partly
fools,--not one of them capable of entertaining
a man of sense five minutes with anything like
rational conversation. How inferior to Stafford
Jackson were such men as these ! even Beauty
Smith had more vous in his little finger, than most
of them
Then there were foreign Counts, who had the
best of all right to their titles, for they were of
their own creation ; Russian noblemen, . whose
nobility consisted in their green trowsers and red
whiskers; Chevaliers of that very ancient order,
d'Industrie; Hussar Colonels, whose commissions
were in their brass spurs and mustachios; and
Clergymen, whose livings were on the spot which
they then occupied.
Be it known to you, gentle reader, if you are
not already initiated into the arcana of town, that
the billiard-rooms which we are describing, were
not simply billiard-rooms. They did not merely
sport tables, cues, and balls: but were appro-
priated to far nobler and more important purposes,
as many similar establishments in London are.
There were besides billiards, chess and draughts,

backgammon, the dice of which, in an adjoining
and well secured room, were found extremely con-
venient for the purposes of hazard. Cards too,
it is said, were not excluded from this repository
of agreeable and profitable amusement. The pro-
prietor's motto was
" Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit tile dulci ;"
and accordingly, negus, punch, lemonade, &c.
were procured from a neighbouring house, as well
mired as the nicest connoisseur could possibly
desire.
When our party entered, there was a grand
match playing in that particular room, for 100
guineas the short rub, between Mynheer Van
Hogendorp, a Belgian Baron, and Lieutenant
Colonel O'Kelly, of the Austrian Imperial Guards.
The profoundest silence prevailed; by-bets being
made continually, to a large amount, in low whis-
pers. The players were unrivalled in skill, and
Barnard, who knew a little of billiards, was per-
fectly astonished at the inimitable science of their
performance. What amazed him most was the
lightning-like rapidity with which each game
was won and lost. Indeed, the fate of every
rubber depended entirely upon which player first
got the balls into his hands. When this fell to
the fortune of one performer, the other was con-
sidered to have little or no chance, and the odds
laid in favour of the striker were enormous ; yet
it did sometimes happen that the balls assumed
a position wbich allowed the adversary to use his

cue;
in which case he was sure to win the game,
though ever so far advanced.
Not seeing any chance of amusing themselves in
this room, for the tables were engaged three deep,
our party adjourned to another where the tables
were free. Here a match took place between Jack-
son and his friend and late opponent, Mr. Pinks ;
and, whether designedly or by accident, Barnard
was permitted, in betting, to win back a few of the
pounds which he had lost at the Fives Court.
The dinner-hour now approached, and they
proceeded to Leicester Square. Arrived there,
they found Beauty Smith waiting for them, and
quite transformed as to the covering of his outer
He had taken off his slang dress, and put
on that of a gentleman,though he could not
muster much of the appearance of one, with all
his pains.  Jackson retired to a room, where the
portmanteau he had given charge to Smith con-
cerning had been left, and soon returned equally
metamorphosed in a fashionable evening dress.
"What is the meaning of this change of costume,
gentlemen ?" demanded Creed.
"Why," replied Jackson, "we have a notion of
visiting one of the theatres this evening, or perhaps
the Opera. Our object is to show Mr. Barnard
as much as we can."
"But," said Barnard, casting an eye downwards
on his boots and inexpressibles, "I am not exactly
in trim."
" Never mind, Barnard," observed Beauty, " you

are well enough ;besides, I can lend you what
you want, -we are nearly of a size."
They now sat down to dinner in high style.
Every delicacy that could be procured was on the
table; and their wines were claret, champagne,
and burgundy. All this was quite in Jackson's
taste, for he had the most decided turn for all
elegant and expensive luxuries. His fondness
for these, for all kinds of social pleasure, and,
above all, his inordinate passion for the fair sex,
led him into the greatest expenses; and, not-
withstanding his success in gaming, and his
admirable skill in-" raising the wind," kept him
always more or less in want of money. In fact,
a princely fortune would have been insufficient
to minister to his prodigality ;--in this instance,
however, he knew that Barnard should pay the
piper.
They dined, and got very merry over their
wine-singing songs, cracking jokes, &c. They
did not, however, drink to excess, for doing so
was not to Jackson's taste; nor was it consistent
with the profession of the other gentlemen,
Barnard excepted. When they called for the
bill, it may be supposed that it was of a tolerable
amourt. They were about to settle it, when
Pinks said, with a smile,
Gentlemen, if Mr. Jackson can get over his
scruples, suppose we toss to see who shall pay
this bll?"
## p. 132 (#154) ############################################

" Oh!" said Jackson, laughing, "I have no
objection in the world; it's only tossing for money
that I dislike-and," added he," with strangers.
As for you and me, we have been too familiar
this morning, to come any longer under that
denomination."
"Well, then," said Pinks, "I will begin with
you, Mr. Jackson,two out of three," taking a
sovereign out of his pocket.
We must inform our readers, that, by long prac-
tice, this man had acquired such extraordinary
dexterity in the art of tossing, that he had reduced
it to a perfect certainty. Heads or tails were
alike to him: he could make either appear, just as
he thought proper. In the present instance, in
tossing with Jackson, it suited his purpose to lose.
" Well, Mr. Jackson," said he, "you are clear
of the scrape ;-now, Captain Creed."
Pinks lost again, and also in tossing with Smith.
"Now, Mr. Barnard," said Pinks," it is between
us both; but as you are comparatively a stranger,
I will give you every advantage. These gentle-
men have allowed me to toss altogether, and a
pretty hand I have inade of it; but with you I
will first toss once, to see who shall have the
rst play."
So saying, he threw up a sovereign, and cover-
ing it with his hand on the table, said, "Heads or
tails, Mr. Barnard ?"
Heads," cried Barnard  and tails they were!
## p. 133 (#155) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
133
The first toss is mine," said Pinks. He threw
up the sovereign again, and Barnard then crying
"tails," lost.
Barnard then tossed, and won.
"Now for the conqueror," cried Pinks; and
the result of the third toss settled the dinner-
bill :-as the reader may well suppose, it was paid
by Barnard.
They now broke up. Jackson, Smith, and
Barnard, proceeded to Drury Lane Theatre;
Creed and Pinks took leave, appointing to meet
their friends again, after the play, at Mother H?s.
It was near ten when our gentlemen entered
the theatre; but as, like a vast majority, they
went for any purpose but that of seeing the play,
the hour was of small consequence. They were,
however, in sufficient time to see a portion of the
last act. It so happened that the play was " The
Gamester." Barnard had before seen the pray
performed by a strolling company at Colchester,
and was familiar with the plot. The terrible
delineation, therefore, given by Kean in the
concluding scenes, made a strong impression on
his mind; and one which, if equally lasting,
would not, perhaps, have contributed to further
the pious purposes of his companions.
This did not escape the penetration of Jackson,
who, immediately after the play was ended,
hurried him off into the saloon, where Barnard
soon forgot the impression of the drama in the
## p. 134 (#156) ############################################
134
THE RED BARN.
blaze of elegance and meretricious beauty that
surrounded him.
We, who have long been habituated nightly to
witness the extraordinary scenes exhibited in the
saloons of theatres, look on them with stoical indif-
ference, and even almost forget the first impres-
sion which they made upon us; but on a youth
fresh from the country, the effect is very much the
reverse: to him, the saloon is fairy ground : the
frail beauties that adorn it, dressed in the first
style of elegant and expensive fashion, are like
the houries of Paradise to the imagination of
the enthusiastic Arabian. Their forms and faces,
which, perfect as many of them are, lose their
effect on us, from the ideas of mercenary de-
pravity which we associate with them, have their
full influence on him. Tell him what the women
are, and he will hardly believe you, until he has
witnessed a little of their conduct, manners, and
conversation. These are as little in accordance
with their features as with their dress; and to
hear blasphemies and obscenities, which would
disgrace the very lowest of our sex, fall from the
lips of a Hebe, is a contrast truly hideous.
There is no absurdity, wickedness, or folly, in
the world, that has not found its defenders. Ac-
cordingly, those nightly exhibitions in the saloons
of our theatres,-so disgraceful to our country, so
subversive of public morals, and so insulting to
the modest portion of the sex,have had their
## p. 135 (#157) ############################################

135
advocates. The late Mr. Scott, in his " Visit to
Paris," compares the cases of England and France
in this respect, and gives the preference to the
former. He says that this strong line of distinc-
tion between vice and virtue is necessary, for the
sake of the virtuous part of the community. What
nonsense all this speculative sort of reasoning is !
What is the fact ?-are not thousands of young men
ruined by the system which he would uphold?
are not numbers of young girls in middle life
seduced by the apparent gaiety and happiness of
these unfortunate women, and especially by their
gaudy and expensive style of dress ? and above
ail, by this strong line of distinction which he
advocates, are not these unhappy victims pre-
vented from returning to the paths of virtueis
not the door of repentance closed against them
for ever?
Barnard, when the play was over, was con-
ducted by his companions to that sink of iniquity,
Mother H.'s. There he beheld the same women
that he had seen figuring in the saloon, and many
others. There, too, he beheld that assemblage
of fools, sharpers, and rous, who, as to exterior
all alike, are some of them the dupes, and some
the associates, of prostitutes; many of them
living on the wages of the prostitution of these
wretched women, or allied with them in enter
prizes of robbery and plunder.
There are few places more injurious to the
youth of this metropolis, and to those who visit it

than the place of which we are now speaking.
Many a young man has been sent from this
seminary of vice, to transportation or the gallows.
There are billiard-rooms up stai 's, where cheating
and plundering proceed to an immense extent ;
while below, scenes of riotous debauchery last
till morning. But this, I suppose, is one of the
establishments necessary to be kept up, for the
purpose of marking the strong line of distinction
between yice and virtue! At all events, it ap-
pears, that such is the inefficiency of our laws,
that they are unable to suppress it.
Here our friends were rejoined by Captain
Creed and Mr. Pinks
All the party, with the
exception of Barnard, seemed pretty well known
to most of the ladies who visited Mother H.'s,
However Barnard may have felt inclined, his
friends had such extraordinary care of his morals,
that they prevented him from attaching himself to
any of these fair ones. That would not have at all
squared with their purposes.
He had, they
knew, upwards of 120 about him, and they
were determined that none but themselves should
share the spoil. They encouraged him, however,
in his devotions to the rosy god; and with the
aid of the execrable "old port" of Mother H.,
Barnard's brains began to be in a state most
admirably suited for their operations.
" Shall we go to hell, Captain Creed ?" whis-
pered Mr. Pinks.
"No," said Creed, ' we will first take a turn in

137
purgatory ;-I have no notion of putting money
into the hands of those cursed dealers."
" You are right," said Pinks; " but let us change
the scene."
They withdrew, and just looked into the
Shakspeare Tavern, then kept by a puritan,
ycleped Grubbone whose name, nature, and
occupation, were in the most delightful harmony.
The Shakspeare was then appropriated to simi-
lar purposes as Mother H.'s, but the order of
Cyprians there were rather of a lower cast.
As it was waxing late, or rather early, these
were gradually dropping off ; scarcely any re-
mained except those whose years and faded
beauty had detained them until that advanced hour,
in the faint hope of deceiving the indiscriminating
vision of inebriety. Such places then present a
most melancholy picture, to a mind at all capable
of reflection. The first rays of morning beaming
through the windows struggle with the expiring
artificial light within, and both combined, cast a
horrible reflection upon the pale and jaded-look-
ing countenances of the midnight revellers. The
fictitious colour worn from the faces of the women,
leaves their years and wrinkles exposed to inves-
tigation, and exaggerated by fatigue and excess.
The ravages, too, of disease can then be clearly
seen, and, in short, every defect and deformity
becomes more glaring. Then, too, the unmean-
ing eye of intoxication rolls on vacancy, and the
livid skin and furrowed cheek announce, even in
T

the prime of life, what a wretched slave is the
man of pleasure !
The scene here was not, however, quite so dull
as it usually was at the hour of which we are
speaking : it was enlivened by a contest between
two madmenthe celebrated Bobbins, a constant
frequenter of the place, and another, who was a
stranger, but who could put in the most unequi-
vocal claims to admission on the score of insanity.
Bobbins, who, I suppose, like the Turk, could
bear no brother near the throne, was for turning
the intruder out, but the latter stoutly resisted
the writ of ejection both by blows and vocifera-
tions. He sat himself down in a chair and swore
that he would never walk out. In this particular
he kept his word, for he was literally dragged
out along the ground by the heels, and pitched
into the street.
Our heroes, notwithstanding all they had d: unk,
contrived to demolish a bowl of bishop at the
Shakspeare, after which, as Barnard complained
a little of the state of his "upper works," Creed
very judiciously proposed to adjourn to Ro-
bottom's, and finish the evening over a cup of
coffee. This was to be the last scene of the
drama they had been acting since the morning
before. Here they were to make their " grand
coup," which was to leave Barnard as bare of
cash as a coot's head is of feathers, and, if pos-
sible, to involve him in engagements beyond the
present extent of his finances.

To Robottom's they went. This house is gene-
rally considered as the climax of all that is villain-
ous on the Covent Garden side of town; and, to
say the truth, its pretensions are tolerably well
founded. Nice connoisseurs, indeed, have their
doubts whether or not it be the very worst house
in London. There are others, perhaps, more ex-
clusively devoted to the entertainment of genuine
ruffians of the lowest order; but they are not so
dangerous, because a respectable person can
scarcely, under any circumstances, be enticed
within their walls. But here is to be found an
assemblage of all kinds :-low dressed and high
dressed ruffians-silken and draggle-tailed
prostitutesburglars, boxers, gamblers, and
vagabonds. Here the pickpocket who rises early
to go through the business of the day, sits down
in d'aightful sympathy with the pickpocket who
has sat up all night that he may be up early.
Here the fine lady about to retire to rest, meets
with the market wench lately risen, and redolent
of gin. Flat-fish, too, come in shoals to this
ocean of iniquity; for they are essentially requi
site to the support of its indigenous sharks.
Without the former, the latter must perish, and
the supply of the one will always be found nicely
balanced by the numbers of the other. Such
are the admirable contrivance, order, and har-
mony observable in the works of nature !
It must be confessed, that however revolting
such places as we are describing may be to minds

of taste and delicacy, and however totally unfic
for the young and innocent, they are the proper
places for the philosopher. Here he has an op-
portunity of studying human nature, stripped of
the disguises which it too often assumes in the
ordinary walks of life, and of seeing fully developed
the genuine baseness of man. In the usual occupa
ions of life he is more or less disguisedhe
wears the mask of friendship, of principle, of pro-
fessional etiquette, of conventional decency, of
morality, and religion, for the purpose of imposing
on his neighbour, and henefiting himselfhe
throws into the back ground his brutish appetites
and domestic passions : but in places like these,
his true nature breaks out: we see him as he is,-
brutal, selfish, sordid, unprincipled, and unfeeling;
intent on nothing but the gratification of his
cupidity or his lust; not satisfied with a total
disregard of the feelings of others, but actively
engaged in the indulgence of his malicious pro-
pensities to annoyance. In the truth of intoxica-
tion, we see him regardless of every tie of friend .
ship, relationship, and acquaintance,-devoid of
common decency, and of common sense! Such
we find to be one form of the interesting being
who has the impudence to term himself the
image of the Divinity !
In the upper room at Robottom's, they en

arrival. Whether he was there by accident or
design, "deponent sayeth not."
They got into a private room at Robottom's,
quite snugly, and ordered coffee; after which they
sent out for some brandy, and the honourable
Captain Creed proposed, when he saw Barnard,
whom the coffee had recovered a little, thoroughly
primed, the favourite game of all-fours. This
was immediately agreed to, and by none more
readily than Barnard. As our good friend,
Robottom, was never without a choice pack of
cards, he soon supplied them with their tools; and
'o work they went, heart and hand.
Creed and the one-eyed gentleman played
against Beauty and Barnard, while Jackson and
Mr. Pinks amused themselves by mock betting.
Game succeeded game, and Barnard was a rapid
loser :-at length, being drained of all his money,
he stood up and said he would play no more.
w Oh! Mr. Barnard," said Creed, "let us go on;
you may win back your money, and it is too soon
to retire yet."
"I have no more cash about me," replied Barnard.
That," returned Creed, "is not of the slightest
consequence ;- your security, Sir, is good."
Come, then, Mr. Barnard," said Smith, taking
a gulp of brandy; "let us go to work, and here's
luck."
Barnard took a deep draught, and they set
to, playing for twenty pourds the rubber.
As might be expected, Barnard lost every

rubber; and continuing to drink, became more
and more intoxicated.
" Now, I think," said Creed, "we had better
leave off."
"Yes," replied the one-eyed rascal; " but per
haps Mr. Barnard will give us his bill for the
money he has lost, only for form's sake. It is
just two hundred."
Certainly, certainly," interrupted Smith ; "my
friend, Mr. Barnard, will do that.-What say you,
Barnard, my boy ?"
"Do as you like," replied Barnard, who was
so overcome by the effects of liquor that he knew
not what he was about.
" Rowy," said Creed, calling the worthy host,
"have you got a stamp?" (Robottom was never
without a few of those useful articles.)
"Yes, Sir," replied he ; " for how much ?"
"Two hundred," said Creed.
The stamp was produced, and handed to
Barnard by Creed, who said,
Now, Mr. Barnard, if you will give your
promissory note at two months, it will do."
" Draw up the note," returned Barnard, " and
I'll sign it."
The note was drawn up, and Barnard, with
some difficulty, signed his name, laid his head
on the table, fell fast asleep, and all attempts to
wake him were to no purpose.
"Come," cried Beauty, " let us leave him here,
--he's did - no use in disturbing him."

"I'll be damned if I leave him so, Mr. Smith,"
said Jackson ; " we have done the poor lad's
business pretty well for one nightlet us have
the humanity to take care of his person, however
his purse may have fared."
"Oh, certainly," exclaimed Mr. Pinks, " that's
but fair."
"To move him is out of the question," said
Jackson, "now, in broad day-light.
Robottom, have you got a bed for this young
I say,
man ?"
"Yes !" replied mine host, "if he can pay for
it."
"I'll pay for it, Mr. Robottoni," said Jackson,
"that's enough for you."
Certainly, Mr. Jackson, your word"
"Oh! damn my word, Sir," returned Jackson,
you shan't trust to that,-here's the money for
the bed ; and here," added he, handing him over
two pounds, " give him this when he wakes, that
he may have something in his pocket, and explain
everything to him that has happened ;--and, d'ye
mind, don't forget to give him the two pounds, or
you know the consequences."
"He'll be sure to have it, Sir," said Robottom
Barnard was then carried up to bed, and the
others departed, Jackson muttering between his
teeih, as he went down stairs, "Damn this Life

BARNARD awoke late in the day from that un-
refreshing and horrid sleep produced by intoxica-
tion,-chequered by confused and disagreeable
images of the scenes through which he had passed
the preceding day and night. His head seemed
ready to split open with pain, and the nausea he
felt was almost insupportable. Of ali the miserable
situations with which this happy life of ours
abounds, there is none which, for the time it lasts,
is more horrible than this! The awaking from
intoxication, the sense of physical oppression,
the moral feelings of compunction, the wretched
disinclination to exertion, and the inability we
bring, in such cases, to grapple with business, to
struggle against difficulty, or to face danger,
render man a pitiable spectacle indeed. Such is
## p. 145 (#167) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
145
the effect of occasional drunkenness: habitual
ebriety causes less corporeal inconvenience,
but greater moral evil. It is a vice which must
assuredly blast the fairest prospects : it deprives
prosperity of all its advantages, and renders ad-
versity sordid and disgusting. In his good
fortune, the drunkard is without respect; and
without compassion in his calamity. There may
be vices of greater moral turpitude, but there is
none which so completely degrades the individual.
In pain, in sickness, in poverty, there is still a
possibility of securing respect, and maintaining
tranquillity; but the drunkard is invariably de-
spised, and he dearly pays for a few hours of
brutal stupefaction, in the gloom, remorse, and
horror, of returning sobriety.
Barnard knew not where he was, and had, as
yet, but a confused recollection of what had
passed. He got up to ring the bell, but there
was no machine of that kind in the room; so he
opened the door and called loudly on the stair-
case ;
in
consequence of which, Mr. Robottom
immediately made his appearance.
Barnard inquired what house he was now in, and
Robottom
gave him a full explanation of all that
had passed,-how he had lost his money, given
his note for 200, and got so drunk that he could
not be moved; concluding with telling him how
Jackson had paid for his bed, and handing him
the two pounds with which he had been entrusted
by the latter.

to
Barnard made little or no observations: in
such a state, a man of his character is not much
disposed to talk. A thousand ideas chased each
other successively through his brain, each of a
gloomier colour than its predecessor. He got up,
dressed himself, and made the best of his
way
the " Blue Boar."
When he arrived, he inquired if Mr. Smith
or Mr. Jackson had been there, and was answered
that Mr. Smith had been at an early hour, and
had taken away his things: as for Mr. Jackson
they knew nothing about him.
"Did Mr. Smith leave no message for me?"
said Barnard.
"None," was the reply.
He then retired to his bed-room, and Hung
himself into a chair.
"Well !" thought he; "so this is life in London!
How much better are my own green fields,
exercise, health, sweet sleep, innocent amuse-
ment, harmless mirth !-Ah, Maria !-would I
had never seen London!"
He then bethought himself of the difficulties in
which he was placed :-how to account to his
father for the money he had lost ?-how raise the
sum for which he stood engaged? He was per-
plexed, bewildered, tormented. Sometimes he
thought of never returningof enlisting as a
soldier or a sailor-of remaining to see what he
could do in London :--but no; the thought of
London was horrible.

return home," said he, "and ask forgiveness of
my father;-I will tell him the truth-I will never
touch a card again-I will come no more to this
cursed town-I will attend regularly to my
business; perhaps I shall be happy;" and he
again thought of Maria.
Ill-fated young man! Happy indeed would it
have been for him, had this frame of mind always
lasted-had these resolutions been preserved
unbroken!
With every mind which enters the career of
vice and folly, and which is not originally utterly
depraved, there are times when either conscience,
--that warning voice within,-or our better angel,
interposes to save us from destruction. Happy,
if we attend to the suggestions of the divine
monitor, who, if neglected, soon leaves us to the
influence and counsel of our worst of enemies,-.
ourselves !
Barnard determined then to bid an eternal
farewell to " Life in London"--to that life in the
midst of which is death !-to that life extolled by
artists, authors, poets, and dramatists of a certain
order, and, we lament to say, too successfully;
for, however their style and their subject may
be
revolting to minds of sound principles and good
taste, both have had their fascinations for a very
large class of society,-for a class, in whose
morals and conduct society is very deeply inter-
ested,for the major portion of the youth of the
middle orders.

THE RED BARN.
It is but a short time since a contemptible
and vulgar drama, the characters, the plot, and
the language of which were immeasurably below
all criticism, actually drove insane more than three-
fourths of the youth of this metropolis ; where it
was patronized by rank and fashion, and its dis-
gusting vulgarities listened to, and simpered at, by
female delicacy! It was on the middle classes, how-
ever, that it exerted its most pernicious influence:
the others were above or below its corruptions.
Who forgets the Tom-and-Jerry mania? To a com-
mon observer, its senseless and troublesome ab-
surdity was its most distinguished feature. But, if
we would look for its more fatal consequences, we
must consult the records of Bow Street, the trials
at the Old Bailey, and the "Newgate Calendar." If
such mischief could be produced by a compounder
of vapid farces, we have no reason to think public
morality secure, because her enemies seem to be
feeble. Alas! it requires but little talent to
pander successfully to the vicious propensities of
our nature.
Barnard having adopted his resolution, was not
slow in carrying it into execution. He called for
his bill, which amounted to five-and-twenty
shillings. With the remainder of the two pounds
neft by Jackson, in his pocket, he mounted the
coach, and the next morning saw him at his
father's house in Polstead.
It is now time for us to return to Maria. We
left her, as the reader may recollect, on the eve
of an appointment with the gentleman with the

some
no
white hat, who was no other than our friend
Stafford Jackson. She went to the appointed
place, and remained
time; but
gentleman made his appearance. Stafford was
then far distant, having been suddenly summoned
away by business of more importance to him
than the seduction of a young, innocent, and
foolish girl. He had neither time nor opportunity
to advertise her of his compelled absence.
She returned home, disappointed, dejected,
and somewhat indignant.-Was he, after all, only
sporting with her feelings ?-A different train of
reflection then arose in her mind : she thought
and pondered over the fortune-teller's prediction.
The idea of Barnard and his white hat occurred
to her. After all, he might be the manshe had
no aversion to him. She did not know what to
;-she was perfectly bewildered.
On the other hand, Barnard himself was em-
ployed in a train of thought, the tendency of
which was to lead him to the hopes of an union
with Maria. As, on her part, she had no aversion
to him; so, on his, he felt a very strong growing
affection for her. After some little difficulty, and
much paternal reproof, he succeeded in gaining
his father's pardon for his London freaks, and his
assistance in settling the embarrassments in which
they had involved him. He began to recover his
tranquillity of mind, and to turn his thoughts with
serious resolve upon a settled, steady, virtuous
course of life. With such a plan of a country life,
think ;-

the idea of marriage would of necessity be asso-
ciated, even if no prepossession for any individual
female had pre-existed. But where, as in the case
of Barnard, so decided a penchant had been
formed, it was naturally the very first idea that
would suggest itself.
There was little doubt but that the mind of
Barnard had undergone a salutary change for the
better, after his London excursion. He had been
disgusted with vice and profligacy by their detri-
mental results to himself. Happy would it have
been for him, if the strength of his virtuous
resolutions had lasted, or had circumstances
proved as favourable to their permanence, as
unfortunately they were otherwise !
Barnard dwelt so long on the idea of Maria,
that he at last resolved to seek an interview.
But as, from his connexion with Smith, and other
unfavourable reports of his late conduct, his
character did not stand very high in the estima-
tion of the neighbourhood in general, he had his
doubts and misgivings relative to his eventual
success. "Perhaps," thought he, "she won't see
me: her mind may be set against me, in conse-
quence of my late proceedings." But then he
reflected that, in the last interview he had had with
her, she certainly did not show herself unfavour
able to his pretensions. He never dreamed of
any feelings on her part in favour of another; or
if he did, his thoughts reverted only to Harry
Everton, for whom, notwithstanding general

report, Barnard had his own reasons for believing
that Maria cherished no feeling of love. Also he
was, or thought himself to be, so firmly fixed in
his virtuous resolutions, that he imagined that he
should find little difficulty in persuading Maria of
his sincerity, and inducing her to overlook his late
follies, and to listen to his addresses.
Having thus made up his mind, he determined
to seek an interview with her at once, and
therefore walked over one fine morning to her
cottage ; and, singularly enough, he happened to
wear precisely the same dress which he had worn
on the night of their last interview.
The sight of her cottage produced on his mind
a very powerful effect. It was, indeed, all that
fancy could picture as the appropriate residence
of peaceful innocence, and happy, virtuous,
wedded love. " Alas !" said he, "how delightfully
my days might glide along in a retreat like this,
blest with content and Maria's love : but I fear I
am not worthy of such happiness."
She was seated at the door; and at the sudden
view of Barnard, and more especially of his white
hat, she was not a little startled. Her agitation,
however, though the effect of sudden surprize,
was not unmixed with pleasure. She quickly
recovered, gave him her hand, and greeted his
arrival in most friendly terms.
After the usual salutations on both sides had
passed, Maria said
"William ; I have heard but an indifferent

character of you lately. I am told that you have
been in London, and spending your father's
money."
"How did you hear all this, Maria ?" said
Barnard.
"I am sure I don't know who told me," said
she; " but it is the common report."
" Common report, Maria, I am sorry to say,
is for once right. I have been unfortunate enough
to lose my father's money, and, for a time, my
own peace of mind. But the latter I have
recovered; I am forgiven by my father, and am
fully resolved to go astray no more."
"Such resolutions," said Maria, "are some-
times broken; at least, I have heard so. You,
perhaps, may soon forget them."
66 Never, Maria," replied Barnard, with energy;
" I have received a lesson I cannot forget: I was
never so miserable in my existence : I cannot-I
know I cannot, ever renew such scenes again.
A virtuous life I am determined to lead; and it
only depends on you, Maria, whether it shall also
be a happy one or not."
" How can it depend on me, William ?" said
Maria, with a laugh and a blush.
"Maria," replied Barnard," do not trifle with
me now; my happiness does depend on you. I
am not a man of many words; but I have come
to-day, to renew the proposal which I made
to you before I went to London. I was then
elevated with wine, and in good spirits; I am

153
Dow neither one nor the other, but my feelings are
still the same. I know not much how to make
love, as it is called; but this I know, I can be a
faithful and affectionate husband."
Maria seemed affected by the serious sincerity
of his manner. The fact was, that the disap-
pointment she had experienced with regard to
Jackson sunk rather deeply in her mind, and
produced offended feelings. Had she been fully
convinced that Jackson had wilfully disappointed
her, she would probably have given her hand to
Barnard from a motive something like revenge.
But she was not fully convinced of that; he might,
perhaps, return, and explain his conduct satisfac-
torily She did not like, as yet, to give up all hopes
of him.
On the other hand, she did not dislike Barnard
personally; and other considerations rendered
him, as a husband, not to be despised. The
fortune-teller might have erred, or she herself
might be mistaken ;-at all events, she no
more liked the idea of giving up Barnard alto-
gether, than she did that of giving up Jackson.
Not being able to secure the one, she would
assuredly have accepted the other; but circum-
stances kept her mind in a state of vacillation,
and she gave a temporizing, though not exactly an
unfavourable, answer.
"William," said she, "it is impossible for me
to make up my mind at once, to a matter so
serious as this. Do not press it any more at

little time;perhaps I may
Here she stopped suddenly, and cast down
her eyes.
"Well, Maria," said Barnard, "only let me
have some hope ; let me think that you may yet
decide in my favour : I cannot be happy if you
will not say that, at least."
Then," said Maria, "if that be necessary to
prevent your being unhappy, I do say so; but
more I cannot say.
" It is enough," said Barnard, "and I must be
satisfied; but do not forget that my happiness,
and perhaps my existence, are depending upon
you."
They were both silent for a few minutes, when
Barnard, as if the thought had just come into
his head, suddenly resumed,
Maria, I have one favour to ask of you."
" What is that ?"
"There will be a dance to-morrow in our Red
Barn, the day before we bring home the harvest;
will you come and be my partner ? Your cousin, ,
Ellen Mayberry, will be there, and all the young
people about."
"Oh," said Maria, "I will grant you that
favour with pleasure."
"Well, then, I shall come and fetch you."
" No," said Maria, "I had rather you would
not come here, for my father has, in my hearing
stiongiy spoken against your conduct. I I expect

him now shortly, and therefore you had better
go, I should not like him to meet you now. A
littie time may do away with his prejudice against
you. Ellen and myself will leave this together,
and you can meet us."
"Very well," said Barnard; "I take my
leave.'
As Barnard was going out through the gate, the
first person he met was Harry Everton. There
was a strong cloud of melancholy on his fine
countenance. They passed each other with a
slight salute, for though personally known to one
another, their acquaintance had
never been
intimate. As for Barnard, he considered Ever-
ton as his inferior, because his father was less
rich than his own; and Everton's habits and dis-
position were incapable of any assimilation with
those of Barnard. There was, therefore, so far
from anything like congenial feelings between
them, a sentiment something not very unlike
a decided antipathy. This, it is true, never broke
out into anything like overt hostility ; but it went
far enough, even before this, to betray itself by
symptoms of unequivocal dislike.
Thought Barnard, as Everton passed towards
the cottage, "I wonder what that fellow is about
now ;-I would bet ten to one that he is going
to slander me." The idea of betting did not
produce the pleasantest recollections in Bar-
nard's mind. " Ah!" said he, thinking aloud,
" After all he has some reason to speak against
## p. 156 (#178) ############################################
186
THE RED BARN.
me:
but I do not fear him with Maria ;-I am
quite sure she does not love him. Besides, there's
no comparison between our situations. Yet I have
no doubt but that he has succeeded in poisoning
her father's mind against me."
Harry had not seen Maria since the evening of
the fair. He had studiously avoided going near
the cottage; but he had been led by some cir-
cumstances to suspect that Barnard was paying
his addresses to her. He had also heard some
vague reports relating to Jackson, by no means
favourable. Although he was forced to give up
the idea of Maria's loving himself, yet his affec-
tion was as strong as ever. He came, therefore,
for the last time, to give her the warning of a
friend, and to snatch her, if possible, from im-
pending ruin.
When he entered, Maria was still more startled
by seeing him, than she had been at the sight of
Barnard. But her feelings were very different :
her agitation in the last instance had no intermix-
ture of any pleasureable sensation ; it was com-
posed of fear, surprize, and anger. She addressed
him with a cold and haughty air.
"Mr. Everton," said she, "this is quite an
unexpected visit ;"and her looks announced that
she considered it not less disagreeable than
unexpected.
Maria," said Harry, in a melancholy, yet
firm tone, "I have not called for the purpose of
troubiing you about myself. I have had but too

THE RED BARN.
157
much reason to know that my feelingsthat my
happiness or misery, must be a matter of perfect
indifference to you ; ' but your happiness can
never be so to me. I have come, therefore, to
discharge the duty of a friend, and to warn you
from the precipice over which I see you ready to
rush headlong."
" Indeed, Mr. Everton," replied Maria, you
are very sharp-sighted. For a stranger, you seem
to understand my affairs tolerably well."
"I have, indeed, been a stranger of late," said
Harry; " but I have been so because you evidently
desired it; and, as I said, if my own private
feelings alone were concerned, I should have
continued to be so: but your happiness is at
stake, I know it, and I come to warn you of it."
" Well, Mr. Everton, go on, I suppose I must
hear you out."
"I tell you then, Maria, that you are on the
verge of a precipice; and whichever side you fall
over, it must be your ruin."
"I wish, Mr. Everton, you would speak plainly,
-I cannot understand your fine speeches."
"Well, I will speak plainly :the gentleman,
with whom I saw you at the fair, with the white
hat, I have every reason to believe to be a dan-
gerous and improper character. The man who
was in his company I know to be so."
" All this," replied Maria, "is nothing to me;
I have seen neither of those gentlemen since: and
## p. 158 (#180) ############################################
158
THE RED BARN.
we cannot help if gentlemen will speak to us,
- there is no use in being rude and uncivil."
" It is not, however, from those," continued
Harry, "that I conceive you to be in the greatest
danger;they, I believe, have left the country.
Nor would I, perhaps, have come about them
alone, unless I had seen them again : but there
is another against whom you should be warned.
I mean the young man who has just left you; 
he is the associate of profligates and gamblers,
and is himself a gambler. Beware of him :-
should you marry him, you will not fail to be
miserable,-if, indeed, he have any idea of
marriage."
"Mr. Everton, this is really too much : as if I
could listen, sir, to any one who did not mean
marriage! I consider your language as quite
insulting; and you have no right whatever to
speak to me on such subjects."
"No right, certainly, Maria, except the right
of a friend and well-wisher. As both, I could
not avoid speaking to you on the subject; more
especially as I am about to leave this country;
and," continued he, in a voice a little broken,
"we now meet, in all probability, for the last time
May you never have cause to recollect my last
words with sorrow!"
So saying, he arose and departed.
Maria was not quite so destitute of feeling as
not to be impressed with what Harry had said,
## p. 159 (#181) ############################################
THE RED BARN,
159
but she was too proud to let him perceive that
such was the case. Yet, when he was gone, she
felt sorry for her harshness, and would have
willingly recalled him. She felt for the youth-
she pitied him, for her heart was susceptible to
the most genuine tenderness; and she had seen
the terrible picture of his feelings in his face as
he retired from herthe marked lines of love-
care, the trembling lip, and the bursting eye
labouring to retain its manhood. Her companion
from infancy was Harryshe regarded him with
tenderness, and but for the whirlwind into which
her girlish vanity had thrown her, would have
been happy in maturing tenderness to love. She
now felt her heart for a moment in its right
place, and she burst into tears without knowing
why; but those tearsthat heart could have told
her, had she consulted it,-were shed for Harry
Everton.
Maria soon recovered her former state of mind,
and began to think whether there might be any
foundation for Harry's warning. The absence
and apparent light conduct of Jackson, seemed to
import that there was some foundation for Ever-
ton's suspicions concerning his character. Yet,
after all, they were evidently only suspicions, for
Harry had specified nothing. As to Barnard,
Harry had only echoed the reports which had
come to her ears before; and to which, from
Barnard's evident repentance, sincerity, and
affection for herself, she was inclined to attach no
## p. 160 (#182) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
1
great weight. Moreover, as she could n t be
ignorant now of Harry's attachment to herself, she
imputed his conduct to a feeling of jealousy and
disappointment, and also to the personal dislike
which he bore to Barnard, and to which she was
no stranger.
"No," said she, "there is nothing in it: he
hates William, and is jealous of him ; that is the
reason of his talking so. I have as much reason
to believe William as him." She thought again
of Barnard's unsophisticated earnestness, and was
satisfied.
The case, however, was somewhat different
regarding Jackson ;-concerning him, she would
not make up her mind. What Harry hinted of
him might be altogether true; yet, when she
thought of his elegant person and insinuating
manners, she was loth to give him totally up.
Still, the result of a variety of complicated im-
pressions upon her mind was favourable rather
than otherwise to Barnard ; and this effect was by
no means diminished by the visit of Harry.
Twenty-four hours passed rapidly away, and
the time was arrived to repair to the rustic ball.
Maria was not unstudious of ornament on this
occasion,and what girl of eighteen ever is, even
where her motives are less powerful than were
those of our heroine, for setting off her person to
the best advantage? Maria, indeed, had as large
a portion of the little vanities and coquetries of
her sex, as is to be found among belles of higher
## p. 161 (#183) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
161
rank. The idea of looking well in the eyes of
Barnard did by no means pass uninfluentially
through her mind ; nor was she quite indifferent to
the approbation of the other young men whom she
was likely to meet. For the fact is, that women
are never indifferent to the admiration of our
sex ;-no! not even the most virtuous, and those
whose affections are engaged. In this respect,
the sex is universally alike ;-rank, age, virtue,
ugliness, or beauty, makes no difference. The
admiration of man is a natural homage to the
charms of women, which is never received with
disapprobation. It is not less grateful than was
the steam of sacrifice, or the libation of wine, to
an ancient priest of Jupiter or Bacchus.
But let me do justice to the fair sex, in con-
fessing that a similar feeling is entertained by our
own respecting them. We desire to please them,
as much as they can possibly desire to please
There is no man who entertains for the sex
the sentiments which he ought to do, who is not
gratified by receiving any portion of their atten-
tion; nor does an attachment to one woman,
however great it may be, lessen the pleasurable
sensations with which he contemplates female
beauty in general.
And this is as right and natural on both sides,
as it is assuredly mutual. Those who aver that the
reverse is the case, either know little of the true
character of either sex, or are desirous to impose.
They judge from a narrow standard, and wish to
us.

substitute conventional dogmas, derived from arti-
ficial life, for the genuine impulses of nature. They
labour to diminish the sum of innocent enjoyment,
and to deprive disappointed love of the remotest
possibility of consolation.
Though Maria, as I have said, was attentive to
the tasteful adornment of her person, yet her
toilet did not last quite so long as that of the
more fashionable belles of our metropolis. Its
mysteries, too, would, in all probability, have
better stood the test of elucidation. She needed
not the assistance of art, to repair or improve a
complexion impregnated by health with the
roseate dye of morning, to render more fair a
bosom that already rivalled the virgin snow in
purity and whiteness, or to rectify a shape on
which nature had set the seal of faultless sym-
metry. She was not, however,

antithesis than truth; for the finest person is
susceptible of improvement from the judicious aid

which, from the union of simplicity and grace, was
best calculated to set off the advantages of nature.
Her cousin Ellen now entered. As it is some-
time since we paid our respects to this young lady,
it is as well to mention that her disappointment,
from the absence of her admirer, was not less
than that which Maria suffered respecting Stafford

Jackson. At this our readers cannot be surprised,
as they have not now to learn that her admirer
was no other than our honourable and accomplished
friend, Mr. Beauty Smith! A gentleman of such
refined and insinuating manners, united with a
physiognomy so prepossessing, could not fail to
make a very serious impression on the heart of a
young lady !But, to be serious, the rascal was
not entirely without his good points. His person
we have already described, which was not one of
the worst; and he could, amongst women, divest
himself of that very coarse vulgarity which some-
times distinguished him. He could lie and flatter,
if not in such elegant language as Lotharios of a
higher order, yet just with as much effect on
the kind of women to whom he addressed him-
self. He could be entertaining when he pleased;
and it is not wonderful that he should have suc-
ceeded with a lively but uneducated girl like
Ellen Mayberry, and that she should regret his
absence. This she was more likely to do, as her
plainness, in all probability, secured to her no
great number or choice of admirers.
But the truth is, that any man, however plain
in person or deficient in mind, may, if he please,
secure the affections of some one woman. Tastes
are various; and when we consider that such
amiable and accomplished gentlemen as West-
is country Dick, White-headed Bob, and Frosty-
faced Fogo, have been successful loyers in their
way, we cannot be surprized that Beauty Smith

should be the favourite swain of some congeniai
shepherdess.
The evening had already long commenced,
when the girls left the cottage : it was one of
those mild ones, so common in the decline of the
year, and which succeed an autumnal day of the
description so admirably drawn by the poet of
the Seasons:
"Wben the bright Virgin gives the beauteous days,
And Libra weighs in equal scales the year ;
From heaven's bigh cope, the fierce effulgence sbook,
of parting summer ; a serener blue,
With golden ligbt enliven'd, wide invests
The happy world. Attemper'd suns arise,
Sweet-beam'd, and shedding oft through lacid clouds
A pleasing calm, wbile broad and brown below
Extensive barvests bang the beavy head.
Rich, silent, deep, they stand; for not a gale
Rolls its light billows o'er the bending plain :
A calm of plenty 1 till the ruffled ais
Falls from its poise, and gives the breeze to blow ;
Rent is the fleecy mantle of the sky;
The clouds fly diverse ; and the suddep sun,
By fits effulgent gilds th' illumined field,
And black by its the shadows sweep along.
A gally chequered heart-expanding view,
Far as the circling eye can shoot around,
Unbounded tossing in a flood of corn."
Such was the day to which the still evening
succeeded, dropping from her dewy wings deli-
cious fragrance. The sun, just set, had left a
glowing streak of red, to mark his departure in
the western sky; while, from the opposite quarter
of the heavens, the moon, like a fair and timid
nymph, arose in silent gracefulness from her

ed of silvery clouds. She pursued her course,
sometimes uninterrupted through the deep azure,
sometimes half enveloped in a mass of clouds,
whose broken edges, reflecting her light, might
easily be assimilated in imagination to the
rugged summits of lofty mountains covered with
eternal snow. She gradually assumed a deeper
and more vivid brilliance, which gleamed through
the dark foliage, illumined the recesses of the
woods, or danced in glittering sparkles over the
crystal wave. The air was calm and serene; the
freshness of night fell upon the earth, and cooled
its burning heat. All nature presented a scene
of still magnificence, repose, and beauty. Such
a'scene would tempt one to exclaim, in the enthu-
siastic language of an eminent French poet, to
whose beautiful lines our feeble translation car
render but inadequate justice
Yet for awhile withdraw, 01 sacred sleep,
Thy poppies,-leave to my admiring gaze
This lovely orb of night, tranquil as Ibou !
This pure and melancholy vault of heaven,
This demi-day just risen over nature !
These spheres whicb, rolling through the void immonse,
Seem at this hour to slack their silent course,
As if their beavenly music changed its time,
To mark a march of slower majosty :
This silvery light which in a thousand rays
Sports in the broken mirror of the stream ;
Or casts within these woods, through many a branch,
Uncertain daya mild and soften'd huo
Falls o'er the face of things; the quiet scene
Awakes the soul to meditations bigb.

The lover sighs, the saint and sage adore !"

Barnard and Maria met in a retired spot, Ellen
hariny known her duty too well to intrude her-
self; and they became so interested in conversa-
tion, as to continue rambling until sometime
after the moon had risen. In fact, they had
almost forgotten, for some hours, that they were to
attend the dance in the Red Barn; and when it
recurred to their minds, they were half a mile from
the rural ball-room, in a secluded and lonely part
of the country. This, however, did not much affect
their minds or their speed, and they bent their
way to the Red Barn in the lovers' loitering gait.
This building stood on a hill, and was com-
pletely insulated, there being no habitation near it,
except one small hut or cabin at a short distance.
It was built of wood, and the denomination of Red
Barn was given to it from the colour with which it
had been originally painted.
There was something in the appearance of this
isolated spot, as the lovers (if we may yet call
them so) approached it by moonlight, of a wild
and melancholy character. At least, it seemed,
from the savageness of its seclusion, to be a place
that might be devoted to purposes very different
from a repository of the products of useful
labour, or a scene of rustic festivity. Strong
imagination could easily convert it into the haunt
of the midnight robberthe rendezvous of the
daring smugglerthe secret theatre of nameless
deeds of darkness and of death!

associations would vanish. It was enlivened by
the cheerful strains of music, and rung with the
sounds of rustic revelry. Its interior was spacious,
and well adapted for the lively dance. There
were two little rooms, of equal size, on the right
and left of the entrance ; one for the purpose of
receiving the corn as it was brought from the
field, and the other to hold it when thrashed and
winnowed. The remainder was one open space,
which was now cleared out for the accommodation
of the present party.
That party consisted of the majority of the lads
and lasses of the village of Polstead, and the
neighbouring cottages. Some of the old people
were seated on benches provided for the occasion,
looking on at the dance, and partaking of the
wholesome beverage of malt and hops, unsophisti-
cated by the more active ingredients introduced
into it by "the march of intellect."
If this party was not quite so refined and
elegant, it was, at least, as cheerful and agreeable,
as many of higher pretensions. If there was not as
much grace as at Almack's, there was at least as
much spirit; and some who contemplated the
blooming countenances and pretty figures of the
girls, with their white dresses and green and red
ribbons, their clustering locks adorned with some
simple natural flowers, thought, perhaps, that there
was nearly as much beauty. Let not the reader,
however, imagine for an instant that we are so
unorthodox as to join in opinion with such schis-

matics.No, no! fashion forbid |--Our tenets
are too pure to admit that there is anything
graceful, lovely, or interesting, beyond that very
comprehensive circle which embraces the " haut
ton," properly so called.
As for the youths of this assembly, all that
could be said in their favour was, that they were,
for the most part, tall, well-built, ruddy, good-
looking, young fellows, from the age of eighteen
to three-and-twenty, sons of respectable farmers.
They were full of life, health, spirit, and activity;
and the commanding officer of a dragoon regiment
would have seen much to approve of in their light,
athletic forms. But they were lamentably and
utterly deficient in the airthe "je ne scais quoi,"
of West-end fashionables. They had nothing of
it about them, as our readers may well suppose;
nor do we think that, under any circumstances,
they would be capable of acquiring it. Like the
talent for poetry, it must be born with the
individual, and is never found except among the
aristocratical part of the creation. We have even
our doubts whether our rustic beaux could have
competed with the underbred of Finsbury or
Russell Squares; but we forbear to make up our
mind on this unimportant question, until we shall
have consulted that discriminating oracle of
second-hand fashion, Mr. Romeo Coats.
Barnard and Maria now joined the dance.
Though the former had not much to recommend
him in point of figure, he was no bad dancer.

As to Maria, she performed as well in that way
as any young lady that has not been in France
could do, or who has not had the felicity of pay-
ing her devoirs at the shrine of Terpsichore, under
the auspices of the scientific Mr. Wilson.
In point of beauty, Maria certainly outshone
the other rural belles there assembled. She
looked and felt happy, and her sentiments grew
more and more favourable to Barnard: he on
his part felt, as he then thought, more and more
in luve. Fortunate would it have been for them
both had such sentiments remained unaltered-
had no circumstances interfered to change them,
or had he had sufficient steadiness to resist the
fascination of the tempter !
The first dance had now concluded, and the
young parties were taking some refreshment,
when a figure which arrested instantaneous and
universal attention, entered the barn
a female of dark complexion and commanding
stature. She was dressed somewhat wildly, but
with infinite grace. She wore a sort of turban of
yellow muslin, with a handsome brooch, or rather
gold buckle, in front. From this her raven locks
escaped on each side, in thick and clustering
curls, which also hung down a little way on her
neck behind. She wore a dress the upper part of
which was of crimson stuff, prettily worked,
and admirably fitting her elegant form. It was so
low that, notwithstanding the addition of a tucker,
it did not half conceal ber beautifully rounded,
It was

swelling bosom. The inferior part of her dress was
of white muslin, with a variety of fanciful flounces.
On each arm, which was quite bare from the
shoulder, she wore a black bracelet. A neat shoe
and white stocking completed her costume; the
lower part of which, moreover, was so slight as to
display, when she moved, the fine contour of her
full and lovely limbs. She was, in all respects,
such a figure as would not have disgraced the
chisel of Phidias, or the pencil of Titian.--It was
Hannah Woods, the fortune-teller!
Maria, of course, instantly recognized her, and
was seized with an involuntary trembling. To
some of the company she was known, but only by
sight.
She apologized for her intrusion in easy, un-
embarrassed terms. She had heard, she said, of
the dance, and was come to join in the festivity,
if she might be allowed ; in return for which, she
would tell the young people their fortunes.
They, as may well be imagined, desired nothing
better. The old ones had retired, and there was
now no restraint upon their gaiety.
The handsome fortune-teller addressed each,
telling them something in a manner that seemed half
jest, half earnest. To Ellen Mayberry, for instance,
e said, " You will either be married in five years,
or not at all ;"a prediction of a very safe descrip-
tion, considering the person of the girl for whom
t was intended.
Thus she went round the circle ; but, when she

171
came to Maria, she stopped short, and whisperes
in her ear, "Those are happy who choose best !"
Barnard was the last of the young men to
whom she addressed herself. She fixed her full
black eyes upon him with a languishing air, and
gave him one of her irresistible smiles. "You,"
said she, in a lower whisper, are destined for
something better than a farmer's life : be not too
quick to decide ; losses may be repaired, and
the arms of love stretched out to receive you-
though not where you imagine."
As Barnard looked at her, he thought he had
never beheld so fine a woman; and it is by no
means unlikely that he was right. But her face
and person, fine as they were, derived much
additional attraction from the sweetness of her
voice and the seductiveness of her look and
A man, at the sober age of forty, could
not easily resist such a woman, were he to try:
it may, therefore, be well conceived with what
facility she could kindle the inflammable tempera-
ment of youth.
The dance was now recommenced. Hannah
directed a look of invitation at Barnard, which
he was not slow to comprehend. If he had mis-
understood it, he must have been dull indeed
so peculiar was the expression of her speaking
eye, so intelligible the smile that played upon
her ruby lip. But Barnard was not one of those
dull young men who require to be spoken to in
good round terms-who must be nlainly asked
manner.

before they can understand the wishes of a
woman; neither was he of that cold temperament
as to be indifferent to the charms of female
beauty. On the contrary, he was too much alive
to all such feelings, and too easily led away by
any appearance of partiality on the part of the
other sex. He arose, therefore, instantly, and
having asked her to dance, both joined the merry
throng.
Hannah's style of dancing was very different
from that of the village lasses. There was a
graceful softness, a rich luxuriance about her
movements, strongly contrasted with the lively
tripping style of her companions. Hannah had
studied the art of dancing in a very different
school, and in very different scenes, from those in
which they had learned and practised it. A con-
noisseur in those matters would pronounce that!
there was a little dash of something theatrical in
her manner-something approximating to the
wanton twinings of a columbine, and not at all
characterized by simplicity or modesty. She did
not merely dance with her feet, as young country
ladies are wont to do: every look and gesture
was highly expressive, and expressive of what
certainly does by no means accord with the most
straight-laced notions of propriety. Although
the character of the dance itself was not such as
to admit of much of this kind of embellishment,
yet she did contrive to throw as much of it into
it as she possibly could,
## p. 173 (#197) ############################################
THE RED BARN
173
On Barnard she lavished all her looks and all
her blandishments ; she turned on him ever a
seducing smile, and an eye whose liquid lustre
spoke tenderness and passion. As they passed
along the dance, his hand would every now and
then receive from hers a gentle but very sensible
pressure, always accompanied by a corresponding
glance and smile. Occasionally she would ap-
proach a little closer to him than the rules of the
dance absolutely prescribed, and almost touch
him with that heaving bosom which seemed, as
it were, "panting to be pressed."
All this produced on Barnard the full effect
which it was intended that it should do. His
senses became intoxicated-he could see nothing
but the fascinating object before himhe could
hear nothing but her silvery toneshe could
feel nothing but her tender pressure. He was
under the irresistible spell of the enchantress,
which, to him, was scarcely less powerful than
the witcheries of Armida to the hero of Tasso.
For the moment, he actually forgot that Maria
was present.
She was dancing with a handsome young man,
whose rural gallantry was by no means disagree-
able to her. It gratified the momentary impulses
of vanity; and she paid little or no attention to
the spreading of the meshes in which poor
Barnard was getting fast entangled.
The dance was now over, and the hour of
parting arrived. Hannah was standing by the

174
THE RED BARN.
side of Barnard : she gave his hand a warm pres-
sure, unnoticed by any of the
of the company, and dis-
appeared with the quickness of lightning without
uttering a word; he looked round, and she was
gone. To the rest of the bystanders she seemed
actually to have vanished, rather than to have
made her exit in the manner of ordinary mortals.
Barnard stood for a while in a deep reverie,
from which he was aroused by Ellen's asking
him to return with herself and Maria. He ac-
companied them accordingly to the gate of her
father's cottage. On his way he spoke but little ;
his thoughts were in the Red Barn, and with
Hannah. Her luxuriant form swimming through
the dance was present so vividly to his mind's
eye, that he might almost be said physically to
behold it still. His whole soul had undergone
a complete revuision; and while Maria was
leaning on his arm, her image was fast fading from
his heart.
But she perceived nothing of all this : she
was in high spirits. What the fortune-teller
had whispered to her that evening, admitted of a
double interpretation; and circumstances dis-
posed her to put the construction on it most
favourable to Barnard. She and her cousin
talked and laughed together; and Barnard felt
almost unconsciously to himself that the presence
of the latter was a relief to him. Previously to
the dance he would have thought very differently ;
he would have preferred being alone with Maria :

THE RED BARN.
175
now he would have dreaded it as a source of
embarrassment.
Barnard having left the girls at the gate,
walked slowly back. Now alone, he gave full
scope to his feelings and reflections. The beauty
and fascination of Hannah recurred to him with
treble force. He thought, on the other hand, of
Maria : he felt that this sudden and violent pen-
chant was not quite right;that it ought not to
be indulgedthat it was unjust to her, and
criminal in itself;that the woman who had
excited those temporary feelings was, must be,
unworthy of his regard, and that Maria was alone
deserving of his affection.
With his mind in this state of vacillation, though
more inclined to his original virtuous resolutions
after all, he retired to bed, but not to sleep.

CHAP. VIII.
And must I still be guilty, still untrue,
And when old crimes are purged, still cbarg'd with new ?
OviD,
When Barnard arose next morning, the intoxi-
cation which his senses had undergone the
preceding night, was, in
night, was, in a great measure,
dissipated. His reflections again turned on the
impropriety of his feelings towards Hannah, the
absurdity of supposing a lawful connexion with
such a woman, and the culpability of any other.
The effect produced on him by her beauty and
her wiles was growing fainter and fainter, and
vecoming rapidly superseded by his returning
feelings for Maria. His mind was about to
resume the original rectitude of its position, like
a bow when the string is slackened; or it rather
resembled the waters of a torrent suddenly
checked in their course by some opposing dam, but
which rush forward with increased impetuosity
the moment the impediment is removed

We have said that he was a young man not
very
liable to the influence of sudden strong im-
pressions We did not mean, however, to say
that his senses were not liable to be led captive
oy those transitory influences which operate on
other men; but such impressions were not
sufficient of themselves to impel him to a per-
manent course of action.
For this purpose it
was necessary that they should be reiterated, and
that they should be strengthened by corresponding
circumstances. It was necessary that his senses
should be steeped, as it were, in enjoyment
that he should drink deeply of the poisoned cut!
of pleasure, before his reason became thoroughly
enthralled, and the triumph over his virtue was
complete. It is more than probable, nay, it is
certain, that had the temptation of the preceding
evening been never repeated, its effects would
have been entirely obliterated; nor would he
voluntarily have sought its renewal.
Some little struggle did certainly take place
within him, before he could resolve to give up all
houghts of Hannah. That struggle, however, was
successful; and he now determined to act at once
from his present feelings, to prevent the possibility
of again backsliding, and to make to Maria direct
proposals of immediate marriage.
Accordingly he proceeds at once to the cottage.
He finds her alone ; for, at this hour of the day
er father was always from home, and her mother

generally busily engaged. She was in a temper of
mind the best calculated to receive his addresses
favourably. Of the re-appearance of Stafford she
quite despaired, began to be fully persuaded that
William Barnard must be her destined husband.
and to feel the friendly regard she possessed for
him fast ripening into something like love. The
moment was propitious for his wooing, and his
better stars seemed to smile and promise hiin
success and happiness.
We have before adverted to the person of
Barnard ; and the reader has seen that, in this
respect, Nature had not been over bountiful to
him. But if he imagine that personal qualifica-
tions on the man's part are of the first importance
in a female's eye, he must be very young,
and
very
inexperienced in the ways of women.
Where
love exists, it can discover beauty in deforinity
itself: and where it cannot be said precisely to
exist in full force, where there is calculation and
wavering, and more especially where there is,
as in the case of Maria, a superstitious sense of
destiny, personal attractions, weigh but little in
the scale. Barnard, it is true, did not atone for
their absence by the possession of those insinuating
ways which prevail so far with the softer sex;
but then, the strong manifestations which he gave
of sincerity and affection, united with similarity
of years and congeniality of character, were not
ill-adapted to supply the place of all he wanted, ang

under the peculiar circumstances which we have
detailed, to generate an attachment in a simple
girl like Maria.
Impelled by the full tide of his returning
feelings, Barnard was more tender and eloquent
than usual in the prosecution of his suit. He
pressed her for an immediate favourable answer:
even proposed that she would permit him to speak
to her father, to have the business completely
settled, and a day appointed for their marriage.
*Your father, William," said she, "is in such
different circumstances from mine, that perhaps
he may not consent."
*My dear Maria," replied Barnard, "my father
will do anything to make me happy: he is the best
of fathers. Besides, what is the difference between
our conditions ? My father may be a little richer
than yours, but he cannot think it any degradation
that I should marry the daughter of an honest
man, who, though poor, is by his industry
independent,and such a daughter! Do not, my
dear Maria, refuse any longer;consentwe shall
have the business immediately settled, and we can
be married directly.
He could not, however, prevail upon her to
concede quite so far; but he succeeded in gaining
from her a promise to marry him shortly, if both
parents should consent; but requested him not
to hurry matters.
With this promise he was obliged to rest
satisfied; and he was the more delighted with it, as

He re-
Maria's manners evidently testified the favourable
state of her inclinations towards him
mained with her for more than an hour; and they
might now, in fact, be pronounced declared lovers
But as the conversation of such lovers, when they
feel quite happy, is peculiarly interesting to
nobody but themselves, we shall spare our readers
the infliction of its detail even, though we might
gain, like Anne of Swansy, a few pages by a
contrary proceeding.
Barnard left Maria full of joy and exultation.
He was pleased with himself, and pleased with
everything; yet he did not feel completely satisfied.
He had certain indefinable longings after more per:
fect bliss, which were half inexplicable to himself;
though one would imagine that the scene which
had just passed was well calculated to fortify him
in his virtuous resolutions; and though it cer-
tainly would have had that effect with a firmer or a
colder character, yet with such a man the excita-
tion it produced had some tendency to lay him
open to the attacks of temptation.
The day was remarkably finethe sun, in its
meridian splendour, pouring intense heat, was
such as Thomson thus describes:-
" 'Tis raging noon, and vertical the sun,
Darts on the head direct his forceful rays.
O'er bear'n and earth, far as the ranging eye
Can sweep, a dazzling deluge reigns; and all,
From pole to pole, is undistinguished blaze.
Ja vain the sight dejected, to the ground
Stoops for relief.

And scarce a chirping grasshopper is beard
Througb the dumb mead. Distressful nature pants,
The very streams look languid from afar,
Or through the unsbelter'd glade, impatient seem
To burl into the covert of the grove.
Thrice bappy be! wbo, on the sunless side
Of some, romantic mountain, forest crown'd,
Beneath the whole collected shade reclines;
Or in the gelid caverns, woodbine wrought,
And fresh bedew'd with ever-spouting streams,
Sits coolly calm; wbile all the world, without,
Unsatisfied and sick, tosses in noon."
It was, indeed, an hour in which he who was
exposed to the burning ray, would be tempted to
exclaim, in the language of that poet of whose
unrivalled descriptive muse we have already
availed ourselves--
" Welcome, ye sbades, ye bowery thickets ball!
Ye lofty pines ! se venerable oaks!
Ye asbes wild, resounding o'er the steep,
Delicious is your shelter to the soul,
As to the bunted bart the sallying spring,
Or stream full flowing that his swelling side,
Lares, as be floats along the berbaged brink."
Barnard walked slowly along, thinking of
Maria, and indulging in all the delicious reveries
of the lover, when, after a short time, he found
himself near the Red Barn; and as it offered a
most convenient shelter from the oppressive heat,
and a seclusion where he might indulge his
reflections undisturbed, he entered it, and flung
himself down on a heap of newly-reaped oorn.
A delightfully refreshing coolness pervaded

this place, the windows, while they admitted
air, only allowed a softened shadowy light to pre-
vail, relieving the sight which had been fatigued
by the broad glare of noon.
The isolated charac-
ter of the barn seemed to secure it from intrusion,
and all the country immediately around was still
and silent.
The noon of a burning day like this which we
have described, is not less tranquil than midnight.
The songsters that usually enliven the fields are
hushed, and universal nature, faint with heat,
appears to sink for the hour into deep repose.
There is no time better adapted than this to pro-
duce and cherish voluptuous sentiments in the
mind of the young and idle. It is a dangerous
moment, even for the severest virtue, if Cupid
and his beautiful mother should set temptation
to work. A train of vague and pleasurable sensa-
tions were passing through the mind of Barnard.
He thought first of Maria, and on the virtuous
pleasures of love; then on a sudden the image of
Hannah-of her luxuriant form--of her melting
glance-of her soft and gentle touchof all her
witcheries, flashed across him. He made an effort
to repel the intrusion of such ideas, but did not
succeed: they still floated before his mind's
vision; his imagination ran riot; the place in
which he was seemed to exercise a spell over
himto renew the impressions of the preceding
eveningto stimulate his senses, and to fire his
brain-until at last he almost fancied that she

stood before him in all her dazzling beauty ;-
when, to his unspeakable astonishment, the door
opened, and he beheld with his corporeal eyes
the enchanting reality!
: Language cannot depict the sudden feelings
which seized upon Barnard at the sight of Han-
nah,
She was more plainly dressed than when
he saw her the evening before, but looked, if
possible, more lovely and enticing. A country-
made straw bonnet, the straw of which was left
of its natural colour, with a wide front, was tied
under her chin with red riband, and hung almost
on the back part of her head ;-under this was a
row of narrow lace, which, added to her cluster-
ing curls, gave a peculiar look of youth and soft-
ness to her face. A gown of very pretty striped
cotton, and made remarkably low in front, exhi-
bited her swelling bosom, which seemed ready
to burst from its confinement as she carelessly
threw aside a dark green shawl which covered it
She cast a sort of sidelong glance at Barnard
with her darkly rolling eyes, which penetrated to
his very soul.
"You did not expect to see me here," said she
disclosing a row of the purest ivory, which con-
trasted beautifully with the dark glow that flushed
her cheek and the deep coral of her lip.
"I own I did not," replied he.
" And are you displeased at it ?" she resumed,
sitting down beside him, and taking his hand.
Displeased !" exclaimed he, with all the

energy of growing passion, and returning the
warm pressure of her hand; " enchanting woman!
who could be displeased at seeing you ?"
" William," rejoined the sorceress, "it is
three weeks since you and I first met;long, long
weeks."
"Long!" returned Barnard ; "you cannot call
it
very long."
Long, for this heart," continued Hannah ;
" long, for the bosom that has been burning with
passion for you."
Barnard started, and blushed deeply.
" Yes, for you William-burning with love for
you. There are women I know, who would not
own as much ; but the love of Hannah is as far
above disguise, as her character is above that of
other women.
She looked him full in the face, and dropped
her head upon his shoulder. Barnard pressed his
lips to hers in ecstasy-a short silence followed.
Having thus wrought upon his feelings, the syren
saw that she had the vantage ground, and sud-
denly raising her head, she continued, with well
acted seriousness of manner,-
" Yes, William ! I love you-dearly love you;
but I cannot share your heart with another.
Hannah must have no rival. Before I consent
to give you full proof of my affection, you must
renounce every other woman. I don't want
to bind you in the vulgar chain of marriage
My love is pure and disinterested.

like some who would accept your hand, for the
sake of your wealth, while their hearts were
another's,who wait only for the security which
a marriage with you would give them, to throw
themselves into the arms of their real lover. No!
no! I love you for yourself alone. But much as
that love may be, I will never see you more, unless
you swear to give up every other woman."
Barnard looked confused, and was silent.
"You will not, then?" resumed Hannah ; "Bar-
nard, I know you love another;-weak young man!
that other's heart is none of thine : though she
would take your hand, that she might more cruelly
deceive you--she would wear you as a cloak to
hide her baseness."
Barnard, starting up, exclaimed, "You mean
Maria Marten!"
"Sit down," said Hannah,"I do.-Did you
not see a gentleman with a white hat at the fair of
Polstead ?"
This circumstance had until this moment totally
escaped the memory of Barnard. He had had a
glimpse of Stafford Jackson walking with Maria
as we have already seen from his conversation
with her on her road home; but the adventures
he had since gone through had totally driven the
matter out of his head, and, in fact, he had
not given it any serious consideration at the time.
When he met Stafford in London, he could not
recognize him, for the glimpse which he hard of

him was transient, it occurred in the dusk of the
evening, and besides, Barnard was uncommoniy
ncar-sighted. But now, this incident, thus art-
fully insinuated by Hannah, rushed upon his mind
with full force, and completed the effect which the
sorceress was labouring to produce. The wounded
feelings of jealousy and pride concurred with
the almost irresistible charms by which he was
assailed, and be succumbed at once under the
temptation. Explanation and detail were need-
less. He saw, as he thought, the entire affair at
a glance. Maria was carryiny on a secret intrigue
with the stranger; and she was willing to conceal
her disgrace, and continue her criminality, under
the cover of his protection as a husband. This
accounted, in his opinion, for the hesitation with
which she had at first listened to his addresses,
and her subsequent compliance. All appeared
nothing but an artful train of conduct, for the
purpose of entrapping him.
All these thoughts passed through his mind in
a second; and indignant and ashamed at the idea
of being made a dupe, he hung down his head,
and continued silent.
"Weak young man !" resumed Hannah, with
a smile of pity; "I knew it allI was anxious to
He was,-he is, the favoured lover;"

tenderest tone, taking his hand, and gazing op

to start"and so, William, this is the girl that
you refuse to renounce for Hannah,for one
whose whole soul, whose every thought, is yours?"
" I will never see her more," said Barnard.
"Swear it," replied Hannah.
"I do," cried he; "I swear it solemnly, by all
ihat is sacred."
" Then I am thine for ever!" exclaimed the
syren, and sunk into his arms.
Hannah Woods was a woman deeply versed in
all the arts of her own sex, and well acquainted
with the character of ours. She was particularly
formed to exercise the most imperious influence
over a young man like Barnard, of weak intellect
and strong passions : she knew how to administer
to the gratification of the latter, without producing
satiety. She knew how, too, to adapt the style
of her fascinations to the different ages of her
admirers. With a man of more mature years and
experience than Barnard, she would not have
been so prompt and forward. Such men are to
be caught by affected modesty, by apparent
reluctance, by amorous delay; but with an inex-
perienced youth the case is otherwise. He is
so completely enthralled as after his
passions have been partly gratified: an experienced
woman then has him completely in the toils:
the spell she can exercise over him is little short
of what is fabled of witchcraft. Such was now the
case with Barnard ; his intoxication, his infatua-
tion, was complete. He forgot everything

Wurning liphe pressed her in his arins, and felt
her swelling bosom beat warmly against his own.
For the first time the Circean cup of terrestrial
love was presented to his lips, and he drank deep
draughts of the delicious poison, but only to thirst
for more. The spell was endedthe charm was
perfecthis destiny was fixed for ever; his better
angel fled affrighted, and the triumphant demon
claimed him as his own.
They had met at noon, and they parted not until
the sun's broad disk stood upon the western edge
of the horizon, pouring a ruddier light over the
extended landscape, and dying with the richest
crimson the fleecy robes which began to invest
the eastern sky.Time flies swift indeed on the
wings of rapturous enjoyment !

It is now necessary to explain to our readers
Row a woman like Hannah Woods could have
acquired that evident superiority of education
which she possessed, so much above her station
and which enabled her to exercise so great an
influence as she did over Barnard, in conjunction
with her personal attractions. We are therefore
obliged to give a sketch of her history, which we
shall make as brief as possible, that the main
action of our story may not be long interrupted.
Hannah was the daughter of a captain of a
merchant vessel, who was in the habit of trading
to the West-Indies. Her mother was a woman
of African descent, being two removes from the
Black, or one shade lighter than the Mulatto.
She was an uncommonly fine woman, and Cap-
tain Woods, meeting her in Jamaica, fell in love

with and married her. Hannab was the only
offspring of the marriage.
Her father being in good circumstances, placed
her, when very young, in a genteel boarding
school in the neighbourhood of London, where
she received the usual rudiments of female educa-
tion. He took lodgings, aiso, near at hand for
his wife, where she might remain during his
occasional absences, and visit and inspect the
education of Hannah. This lady, the warmth
of whose constitution was not inferior to that of
most tropical females, formed, while her husband
was away on one of his voyages, a connexion
with a handsome young officer of artillery, whose
friends happened to be her opposite neighbours.
This went on for some time, and one of the very
usual consequences in such cases ensued, namely,
a total neglect of her child. She abandoned her
entirely to the care of the mistress of the board-
ing school, without condescending to interfere in
any way, or give herself the slightest trouble
concerning her welfare.
Another consequence, equally natural, resulted
from this intrigue-Mrs. Woods became pregnant.
Concealment was impossible, and dreading the
immediate return of her husband, she threw her-
self into the arms of her lover, who took her
altogether to live with him.
When the Captain returned, he instituted a
prosecution against the young hero, who had pro-
perty independent of his commission, and he

eceived five hundred pounds damages. Mrs.
Woods continued to live with the artillery officer,
but died shortly after, in bringing into the world
the fruits of her illicit love.
Hannah was still kept at school by her father,
who, from the nature of his pursuits, could ex-
ercise but little surveillance over her education.
She was now turned of fourteen, very finely
formed, and almost prematurely womanly in her
appearance. She could speak a little French,
play a little on the piano, and danced uncommonly
well; but in a moral point of view, her education
was utterly neglected, and no principles of re-
ligion had ever been instilled into her mind.
She was beginning to grow excessively tired
of the irksomeness and restraint of school, when
she was relieved from it by a young gentleman of
fortune, who persuaded her to elope with him
and put herself under his protection. This could
scarcely be called, with any propriety, a case of
seduction, as she threw herself most willingly
into his armsnot so much from any strong
affection for him, as from an impatience si
scholastic restraint.
With him she lived for some time. He was a
young man of fashion and the town, and being
exceedingly fond of theatrical amusements, he
was constantly in the habit of taking Hannah
with him to the theatres, where she also imbibed a
strong taste for the stage.
Among the friends of her protector, was a

toung man of slender fortune, gay habits, and
emarkably handsome person. This youth was
Likewise passionately attached to theatricals, and
himself no mean amateur performer. Hannah
fell violently in love with him, and he succeeded
in prevailing on her to quit her friend.
This gentleman, finding that his means of
living were rapidly declining, determined to try
his fortune on the stage. He failed in London,
but succeeded in obtaining an engagement in the
country, whither Hannah accompanied him.
She also adopted the theatrical profession, and
evinced no small degree of talent. The manager
found her extremely serviceable as a general
actress; but she excelled more particularly as a
stage dancer. At the Opera, or either of the
Theatres Royal, she would have probably made no
great figure; but in a provincial theatre she was
a star of the first magnitude.
She had been for some months thus situated,
when her lover was taken very seriously ill. He
was beginning, however, to recover, when unfortu-
nately he swallowed a dose of oxalic acid instead of
Epsom salts, through the mistake of an ignorant
or careless apothecary, and died in a few hours,
in intense agony.
Hannah was at first quite inconsolable for his
loss; for, in fact, he was the only man for whom,
at any time, she had felt a real attachment. She
soon, however, suffered herself to be comforted

as her small salary was totally inadequate to her
support, after the death of her former lover.
The colonel was a good-natured man, and
treated her with much kindness and attention.
To these she made but an ungrateful return : she
intrigued with all the officers of the regiment; and
at last her infidelities became so open and notori-
ous, that the report of them reached the colonel's
Without suffering his temper to be ruffled,
he coolly informed her of the facts which had
come to his knowledge presented her with
twenty pounds, and advised her to make the
best of her way out of the town as speedily as
possible.
Hannah took his advice, and came up to
London.
Here she attempted to renew her theatrical
pursuit, but without much success. She was
employed, however, as a dancer at one of the
minor theatres; and by this engagement, and a
sly system of intriguing with the other sex, she
managed to live in very good style. Her finan-
cial measures, however, began to be known; and
the manager, whose morality was shocked by such
proceedings, dismissed her from his company.
She now began regularly to pursue the mode
of life adopted by such numbers of unfortunate
women in this great metropolis. She met with
vicissitudes which are incidental to such a course

of living,-sonetimes in splendour and luxury,
and at others in the lowest wretchedness. Her
utter improvidence and taste for
expense, rendered
her occasionally liable to the severest privations ;
and she soon began to be heartily sick of female
u Life in London."
About this time she became acquainted with
Stafford Jackson. That eminent discriminator of
human character, who so well understood the art
of employing others according to their capacities,
soon discovered that Hannah might be made a
useful instrument. He proposed to her, at first,
to become an agent in his smuggling trans-
actions. Her cleverness, education, and manners,
made him think that he could succeed admirably
in the disposal of contraband articles, especially
among the ladies : she accepted his offer, and
succeeded to admiration. It was by his advice
that she assumed the character of a fortune-teller,
as a good disguise in travelling through the
country; and which her features and dark com-
plexion, assisted by the peculiarity of dress, well
adapted her to personate. In this character she
agreed, for mercenary considerations, to become, as
we have seen, an agent in the seduction of Maria;
and this she undertook the more readily, as she had
not the slighest spark of affection for Jackson
himself, and was actuated by no considerations
but those of self interest. She was constantly up
and down between London and Suffolk ; and when
in the latter county, she resided in the small hut

on the road side, within a mile of Polstead, with an
old couple to wliom Smith had recommended her.
Of Barnard she had known something pre-
viously to the night of the dance. She was aware
of the state of his feelings regarding Maria, and
she determined to detach him from her in the way
that we have seen, and thus at once to further
her own designs and those of Jackson. She
hoped to be able eventually to persuade Barnard
to marry her; or, at all events, to draw most
liberally on his property, as long as it lasted.
We must now return to Maria. Her feelings,
after Barnard had left her, were still rather of a
complicated and conflicting character. She had
promised, it is true, to marry him; and when she
gave that promise, it was dictated by her feelings.
But, as is often the case when we pledge our-
selves to a line of conduct respecting which we
have been vacillating, after he was gone she
began half to repent that she had given so decided
a promise. She again ruminated on the possibility
of Jackson's return; and she felt, that if such were
the case, her inclinations would very easily return
in his favour, if he could give any reasonable
explanation of his conduct. But again she dis-
missed this notion from her mind, and reflecting
on Barnard's sincerity and affection, and not
without adverting to his comfortable circum-
stances, she thought there was every probability
of their being happy together.
Such was the tone and temper of her mind
## p. 196 (#220) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
when she sat down to supper with her parents
just after night-fall. They had scarcely com-
menced their humble meal, when a loud knocking
was heard at the cottage-door. It was opened,
and a young man entered, who stated that a
gentleman's postchaise had just broken down
hard by, and entreated old Marten's assistance to
repair the accident. " A hammer," said he," and
some nails will do the business; and we can patch
it up some how for the present."
This man Maria instantly recognized, and felt
no small degree of agitation at his appearance.
It was no other than the companion of her ad-
mirer at the fair, the lover of Ellen, the aid-de-
camp of Jacksonthe inimitable Beauty Smith!
He smiled and winked expressively to Maria,
as much as to say, "He is herehe is come at
last." And she understood him as perfectly as if
he had spoken it in so many words.
Mr. John Smith now proceeded to the post-
chaise, where his friends, Stafford Jackson, Esq.
and the Hon. Captain Creed, were waiting for
him. With the assistance of old Marten and
the postilion, the accident, which was slight
indeed, was speedily rectified; and the gallant
trio proceeded into Polstead, and established
their head quarters at that most excellent house
of entertainment" for man and horse," the "Cock."
The sight of Beauty had wrought a most
astonishing revolution in the feelings of Maria

the man who, of all others, had best pieased her
youthful fancy, whose person and manners were
everything she could desire, and whose fortune
she imagined must correspond with his appearance.
Without doubt, he was fully able to assign a
sufficient reason for his sudden disappearance, and
his neglect of the appointment which he had
himself made. A thousand things might have
occurred: he might have been taken suddenly ill-
some untoward accident might have prevented
him from coming or communicating with her.
After all, she felt that he must be the man whom
the art of the fortune-teller had pronounced to be
her destined husband.
But she had made a promise to Barnard ;-
what would she not have given now to recall that
promise !-how could she possibly have been so
foolish as ever to suppose for a moment that he
could be the person? She recalled to memory
the exact words of the fortune-teller,-" Your
future husband is young, handsome, and rich."
Barnard was certainly young, and might be said
to be richbut handsome! certainly little of
that, except according to his own mode of inter-
pretation," handsome is, that handsome does, " .
a proverb, after all, not strictly applicable to the
general line of conduct pursued by Mr. William
Barnard. She was to see her destined husband
at the fairbut she did not see Barnard at the
fail;lkere was to be nobody there like him. That

might certainly apply to Barnard; but not in the
sense of his superiority of appearance, in which
sense her present sentiments led her to understand
it. "You were born for great things," (as most
women are, or wish to have been,) but what
"great things" could be expected from Barnard ?
he was comfortably off, and that was all. No,
po! it must be the other !
Yet the promise! the fatal promise!-how
could she ever think of making it? But then,
again, how could it be binding ?-if it was not her
fate to be married to Barnard, what signified her
promise ? Promises ought not to be binding, that
are contrary to our destiny, or to our-in-
clinations.
Such were her thoughts as she retired to her
chamber, but not to rest. She sat ruminating
for nearly an hour, sitting at her window gazing
on the tranquil landscape, silvered over by the
pale moonlight. But it was not with the beauty
of the scene that her ideas were busy: it ouly
served to recall the first time that she had met
Jackson, and the sweet strain of vocal music with
which she had been that night saluted.
On a sudden the deep stillness of the night was
brokenand broken by the very same duet wbich
she had heard on a former night under her
window, repeated. The same wordsthe same

the most intense feelings. A pleasing tremor
seized upon her frame her heart palpitated
with joy and fear.
The song was ended, and a figure approached
the window from the garden of apple trees which
it overlooked. This figure was not to be mis-
taken: it was the graceful step, the light athletic
form, the erect carriage of Stafford," There was
none indeed like him at the fair!"the white
hat completed the effect, but he wore a black
crape around it.
He was alone: his companion had retired,
bis presence was not necessary now. He waved
his hand to Maria, and coming directly under the
window, requested her, in a soft whisper, to
descend.
She complied ;-she stole down stairs with
trepidation, and softly unbarred the door. Her
father and mother were locked in the embraces
of that sound repose, which is the constant
attendant of peaceful labour and contented sim-
plicity.
"Dearest Maria," said Jackson, "I am here at
last."
She could not reply : he took her arm gently
under his own, and they walked forth a little
together. At last Maria said,
" I thought I should never have seen you again."
"My dear girl," resumed Stafford, "I have

warning to attend the dying bed of a father. I
had no means of seeing you or sending to you,
previously to my departure, and I did not dare to
write,-lest my letters should fall into other
hands than yours.
You can have no idea of
what I have endured. The melancholy occasion
on which I was recalled was of itself sufficient to
awaken the keenest pangs of sorrow; but added
to the thought of losing you, it wrought me up
almost to madness. I slept neither night nor
day, partook of little food, and when I had laid
my beloved parent in the earth, (for he died in
three days after my arrival,) I was myself seized
with a fever, and for a short time pronounced to
be in great danger. The strength of my con-
stitution, however, surmounted the disorder, and
the moment I was able to leave my bed, I was
about to return here : but the physicians would
not permit me then to move, and it was with some
difficulty that I have at last escaped them, to fly
to you upon the wings of love."
Maria seemed moved by this well told tale,
and expressed her sorrow.
"But, my love!" said Jackson, " I hope that my
absence has not changed your feelings. When I
last saw you, you gave me some hopes that you
would listen to my suit. Has no happier lover
availed himself of the interval to prepossess your
mind against me, and plead his own cause suc-
cessfully ?"
Maria blushed, and was at first silent and

201
if so,
She had too much nature and simplicity
to reply in the negative. She could not make
up her mind to tell an absolute falsehood, though
she was well disposta to conceal the truth.
Jackson saw her hesitation, and said, "Maria,
I fear much that such has been the case,
speak, and pronounce my doom for ever."
The most sincere of the sex will never teli a
man the entire truth in a case like this; nor,
indeed, is it to be expected that they should do
so. The heart of a woman is never thoroughly
known to any man; no! not even to him whom
she loves the best : and, in many instances, it is
very fortunate for the lover that it is not.
." Where ignorance is bliss,
'Tis folly to be wise."
Maria confessed that a young man had made
to her proposals of marriage ; but she forgot to
add, that she had received them with some degree
of complacency.
"Who is he?" enquired Jackson.
" You don't know him, I believe," replied
Maria : "he is a rich farmer's son ; his name is
Barnard."
"I have heard of him," said Jackson : "a
young man of profligate habits, and a most unfit
husband for you.
But believe me, he was not
serious; or else his designs were of an evil nature."
"I can hardly think so," said Maria, "he
ed so sincere."

"It is easy to seem," returned Jackson;  but
I see how it isyou love him, Maria."
"No, no !" hastily interrupted she, her feelings
getting the better of all attempts at female co-
quetry; "I do not love him-I can never love him."
Jackson, who valued Barnard very little as a
rival, and had his own private reasons for being
perfectly easy about him, nevertheless affected
great alarm; and, by his artful, insinuating style,
soon drew from her a full confession of what had
passed between her and him ; though she forbore to
tell him what had been the precise state of her
feelings towards the latter.
"So, then, Maria, you actually promised to
marry him."
angry with
"What could I do ?" simply returned Maria; "I
never saw you but once, and I thought I should
never see you again ; and, besides, I felt a little
you."
This last expression highly pleased Jackson,
who knew very well that anger, in certain cases,
is no unfavourable symptom of a woman's affection.
He continued
"Probably, Maria ; you did not wish ever to
see me again,"tenderly pressing her hand, and
adding, "if my presence is now disagreeable to
you, I will banish myself for ever; but it will be
to that country whence no traveller returns."
Maria was much affected by his manner, and
replied, "Do not speak so;-I am sure I did wish
to see you again."

"Lovely Maria !" he exclaimed, throwing his
arm around her waist ; " you make me the happiest
oi men.
I own you had some cause to think me
unworthy ;-but are you satisfied with my ex-
planation ?"
"I am," returned Maria.
"And will you consent to be mine ?"
"Yes," she replied in a low and tremulous
tone; " I consent to
- marry you!"
" Enough, enough," cried he, in affected rapture;
and kissed with ardour her burning cheek.
Jackson did not think proper to press the
affair
any
further at present, for two reasons :
first, le saw very plainly, from Maria's manner,
that her virtue would not yield except to proposals
which she deemed honourable ;-her conduct,
during his absence, relating to Barnard, was a
further confirmation of this :-and, secondly, it
did not suit his purposes to quit Polstead so soon
as the proposal of immediate elopement would
Tender necessary.
He now, therefore, turned the conversation ;
and telling Maria that it was time she should
know who he was, gave her a long and glowing
account of himself, which it would be as un-
necessary to detail to our readers, as it is to in-
form them that it did not contain one word of
truth. Suffice it to say, that the sum and sub-
stance of it was that he was a man of independent
fortone; and that all he wanted, to render him

completely happy, was the possession of her
sweet self.
After more than an hour spent in this way, and
in mutual endearments, the lovers parted, having
agreed to meet the following night. Maria returned
to her chamber, and Jackson rejoined his friends
at the Cock.
It is proper here to mention that the breaking-
down of the postchaise was not accidental, but
part of a premeditated plan. Jackson had come
down to Polstead for two reasons ;--first, for the
seduction of Maria; secondly, for the further
plunder of Barnard, Smith contrived on the
road, at a place where the postillion was watering
the horses, very ingeniously to derange a spring,
so that the chaise came gently down just in
proper time and place, and thus gained an op-
portunity of securely advertising Maria of the
presence of Jackson; and aorded a pretext to
Barnard for the appeara!ice and stay of that
gentleman, Smith, and Crend, at Poltstead.

OTWAY.
BARNARD had not yet risen, at mid-day; for he
had passed most part of the night awake, thinking
over the scenes of the preceding day; and when
he did sleep, it was but to dream of the volup-
tuous enchantress who had steeped his senses in
forgetfulness of all but herself. Again, he was
encircled in imagination in her clasping arms,
pressed to her palpitating bosom, and intoxicated
by the nectar of her dewy lip. Never was there
a man more utterly, more completely enthralled
by the syren-spells of a fair and fallen angel than
he was.
From these dreams of enjoyment he was roused
by Mary, the servant, who entered his bed-room,
exclaiming,
"Oh, Mr. William, there are two such nice
gentlemen below wanting you."
"Who are they?" demanded Barnard.
## p. 206 (#230) ############################################
206
THE RED BARN.
"I don't know their names, Mr. William ;
(ne of them is the handsomest man as ever I
seed; and so finely dressed."
You are an excellent judge," replied Barnard ;
" tell the gentlemen I shall be with them directly."
Mary proceeded to obey, ejaculating repeatedly,
as she went down stairs, "What nice gentlemen !"
These "nice gentlemen," it is almost superfluous
to inform our readers, were our friend Jackson
and his companion, our still more amiable friend,
Beauty Smith. They were both admirably well
dressed, and the appearance of Jackson was
particularly imposing. He was in a sort of hal
mourning (to keep up the hoax of his father s
death); wearing an elegantly made black coat and
black silk waistcoat, with white summer trowsers.
Beauty was dressed in a more foppish manner; but
contrived, nevertheless, to retain much more of
the Newmarket style about him than that of the
gentleman. His exterior, however, announced
the possession of wealth; and his glorious impu-
dence made up for all the deficiencies.
When Barnard came down stairs, he found his
two friends in high conversation with his father.
Jackson's manners had already advanced him
considerably in the good graces of the old gentle-
man. He entered into a dissertation on farming-
the different qualities of soilsthe value of land,
&c. on which subjects he descanted with as much
fluency as if he had passed his whole life in rural
affairs. He showed no less intelligence on the

topic of country sports, and quite astonished the
old blade by his profound observations on fowling-
pieces, shot pouches, hares, partridges, and
pointer dogs.
When young Barnard entered, the two heroes
shook him very cordially by the hand, and were
warmly greeted by him.
"We were on our way to my shooting-box,
when my carriage broke down just as we entered
Polstead," said Jackson: "but I understand that
there is capital shooting in your neighbourhood;
therefore I am not sorry for the accident."
"Excellent," replied Barnard ; "and I shall be
happy to accompany you on excursions of that
kind."
"Well," said Jackson, "we shall stop at the
"Cock," and make a party to-morrow : to-day
we have not quite prepared for this sport."
But, Barnard, my boy," said Beauty, "we
shall dine with you to-day,-if you will give us
something to eat."
Old Barnard, with all the hospitality of the
genuine English farmer, replied that nothing
would give him more pleasure than to entertain
Messrs. Smith and Jackson; "and," added he,
" I'll give you a plain country dinner; but you shall
have a bottle of the best old port in the country."
"My dear sir," said Jackson, "don't put your-
self at all out of the way for us; we are easily
pleased in the eating way."
## p. 208 (#232) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
Yes," interrupted Beauty; "for my part, I can
manage anything, from a pork chop to a haunch
of venison."
The visitors prolonged this visit more than an
hour; walked over the grounds with old Barnard,
who was quite delighted in showing all his farming
mprovements. They were not less pleased at
all the substantial evidences they received of the
old man's wealth. He showed them his cattle,
pigs, and poultry. He took them to his stable, ,
where there were four capital hunters; and,
finally, they visited the Red Barn, where they in-
spected his stock of corn, which was worth several
hundred pounds. They never, of course, in their
conversation, made the least allusion to young
Barnard's London affairs.
They now took leave, promising to return to
dinner; and Beauty, freed from restraint, gave fu!!
vent to his sentiments.
"Well, Stafford," said he, looking back on the
old man's farm, "here is a pretty prospect for
US .. I told you the old boy was snug. These
dirty acres are no bad things :-we'll turn factors
for the old gentleman: that corn is wanting in the
London market."
Yes," said Jackson ; "and we shall make
out life here, too, pretty well, while we remain..
Creed, too, must come in for a share: I know
that he has no objection 10 a fowl and bacoa at
times.'

"Not he, by my soul !" said Smith. "If he
remains here long, the old chap's pigs and poultry
will soon travel the way of all flesh."
But," resumed Jackson, "all will depend on
our proper management of the young fellow : we
must be cautious and dexterous in that."
"No doubt," said Smith, "but I am sure
that I can wind him over ;-I know every point
about him well. He may think himself capable
of keeping good resolutions; but he has a taste
for pleasure that will be sure to ruin him : besides,
I rather suspect that his business is pretty nearly
done already."
" You mean by Hannah ?" said Jackson.
"I do: it is through her that we shall succeed
best; and I have no doubt that she has already
commenced operations."
Well," said Jackson ; "our part is to get him
into all kinds of fun and gaiety, for the present.
But we must have no gaming down here ;-that
would spoil all: we must make him 'drink deep
ere we depart.'
" Yes," said Smith; "and have him up to
London we must and will : Hannah is the proper
person to do that."
After this worthy dialogue, the two gentlemen
rejoined their adnirable compeer, Captain Creed,
at the Cock; and all three resolved to storm
Barnard's dinner-table on that day.
It is now proper to notice to the reader, the
impression made on Barnard's mind by the re-

startied by it so completely, that his self-pos:
session was utterly overturned. The whole time
they were rattling away with his father, he was on
thorns,-fearful they would mention the London
affair : besides, he could not exactly make out
the true cause of their coming; and their presence
did not revive the most pleasing recollections in
his mind. Not that he personally disliked either
of them ; for Jackson he entertained great respect,
and was Aattered by an acquaintance with a man
of such gentlemanly manners and exterior :
as for Beauty, he had something for him of a
still more congenial feeling. There was a certain
conformity of nature between them, which, though
not yet fully developed in Barnard, led him to like
the society of Smith. But he feared much to
have the subject of his misconduct renewed : and
though, in consequence of his passion for Hannah,
his thoughts were quite averted from Maria; yet
he had not given up, or at least he flattered him-
self he had not given up, his virtuous resolutions
in a general point of view,
Such was the state of his mind when they
parted from him and his father; and he even
regretted that they were to return that day to
dinner. However, there was no help for it now;
and so come they must: but he determined to
take an opportunity of cautioning them not to
allude, in his father's presence, to the late gaming

When the guests were gone, old Barnard in
quired of his son who they were: he replied, that
both were inen of considerable property, and
of high respectability, particularly Jackson ;--
that he had met them in London, where they had
treated him with great hospitality, and that it
was only right that he should now make them
some return. To these he added a few more lies
of the same description, which were well cal-
culated to impose on an easy, ignorant, and weak
man like his father, whose vanity was also
attered by acquaintances so much, apparently,
above his son in manners and station.
Old Barnard now bustled about, and gave his
orders for an excellent substantial dinner. He
was a joyous old boy, fond of good living and a
hearty glass; but very simple in his character,
and quite unacquainted with everything but a
rustic life. It was, therefore, easy for such men
as Smith and Jackson to impose on his credulity
by the dashing plausibility of their appearance.
He was, besides, entirely under the control of
his wife, whose absence at this time (for she was
on a visit at Ipswich) gave him full scope to act. .
Smith, Jackson, and the noble Captain,
how quitted the "Cock," for the purpose of
carrying old Barnard's confidence and good
things by a coup de main. If impudence could
secure success, in any instance, their stock was
amply sufficient for the purpose. Impudence,
however, like most other qualities, takes  tinge

from the peculiar character of the individual.
The impudence of these three heroes differed
much in each of them respectively. The impu-
dence of Jackson was elegant and gentleman-
like; that of Smith, callous and blackguard ;
while the effrontery of Creed had all the dry,
grave humour about it, which was natural to
him.
The unexpected presence of a third guest, and
such a guest as the Captain, equally startled
young and old Barnard. It must be owned that
Creed's appearance, if destitute
if destitute of the "swell'
foppery of Smith, and the elegant style of
Jackson, was at least equally characteristic with
that of either, and far more remarkable.
We have before observed that the gallant
Captain's person was somewhat of the stoutesu,
and much more distinguished for substance than
symmetry. He thought proper, on the present
occasion, to envelope it in a body-coat of light
grey cloth; to which the addition of jet buttons
presented a pleasing contrast.
Ilis waistcoat was
of the brightest canary buff; which colour was
tastefully relieved by a red silk handkerchief
round his neck. His nether man was covered
with white cord breeches, very loose, and light
drab gaiters equally roomy in accommodation ; a
massy gold chain, with two ponderous seals,
hung down nearly to his knees, and a large straw
hat completed this eccentric figure. lle was
followed by two very large and filthy dogs, whose

213
uddy paws can never be forgotten by Mary, the
servant, whose duty obliged her to wipe out their
manifold marks from her highly polished tables
and chairs.
These gentlemen came with the charitable
intention of giving old Barnard "a thorough
benefit," as they called it. While their object was
to dupe the son, they also thought that they
might amuse themselves a little at the expense
of the simplicity of the sire. It was for this
purpose that Smith and Jackson brought Creed
along with them, in such a free and easy style.
When they entered, they found old and young
Barnard waiting for them, also miss Julietta, the
latter's sister :-Stafford, with easy impudence,
taking Creed by the hand, thus addressed the
old gentleman:
"Mr. Barnard, allow me to present to you my
respected and gallant friend, Captain Creed, late
of the Waggon Train, now of the Scarafooca
Rar gers;a worthier officer never smelt powder."
Beauty, at this sally, was seized with a violent
fit of coughing, the result of a desperate attempt
to suppress his laughter. Indeed, the appearance
of Creed was so utterly at variance with all
received notions concerning the exterior of a
soldier, that it required muscles of no ordinary
rigidity to stand the application of a military
character to him: with the Barnard family, how-
ever, it went down as all gospel.
Creed, who seldo'n changed a miliscle upon any

occasion, approached with much gravity, seized
old Barnard's hand, and shook it with extraor-
dinary energy, saying at the same time-
"Mr. Barnard, I am proud to know you: men
like you, Sir, who support the honourable cha-
racter of an English farmer, are at once an orna.
ment and a service to our country."
Creed then shook yomg Barnard by the hand,
and taking off his " chapeau de paille" next
saluted Miss Barnard with much mock politeness;
who returned his salutation, and the more easy
ones of Jackson and Smith, with a gentle and
affected simper.
The party now sat down to an excellent and
substantial dinner. The gallant Captain seated
himself beside Miss Barnard, and amused himseli
by paying her the most fulsome compliments
during the whole of dinner time. Beauty placed
himself at the foot of the table, and commenced
the dissection of a roast goose with a dexterity
that would have done honour to a most practised
anatomist. Jackson sat on the right of the old
man, and opposite to Miss Julietta, who was em-
ployed in alternately ogling his elegant person,
and simpering at the pleasantries of the witty and
polite Captain.
After dinner old Barnard producea some
excellent port wine, to which his guests did ample
justice. The glass circulated freely; and the old
boy began to get extremely merry, and highly
pleased with nis new acquaintances.

Creeu proved excessively entertaining; and he
and Jackson vied with each other in telling tlie
most enormous lies concerning their adventures
in foreign parts. Creed, for instance, told of his
making one of a party at the capture of a whale
which measured five hundred feet in length;
Jackson swore that he believed it, for that him
self had known a case of a whale having
swallowed the long-boat of a man-of-war, with all
her crew. Thus they went on with a variety of
extravagancies; and after Miss Barnard bad
retired, they became worse and worse,-telling
stories of all shades, and singing songs of all
colours, in the midst of a loud chorus. As if
determined completely to astonish the old farmer,
Jackson jumped out of the window after a hand-
some ruddy wench who was passing by: she,
being one of the servants, took refuge in the
kitchen, whither he followed her, and began to romp
violently with all the maids. Beauty, hearing the
noise, ran out and joined heartily in the sport. He
was followed by Creed, who meeting Miss Barnard
in the passage, fell on his kness before her, and
began to make love in high heroics, quoting
furiously from Romeo and Juliet.
This quite
delighted her, although she thought that the
Captain was drunk, which he pretended to be.
He acted that peculiar style of inebriation, which
is agreeable to a woman from the confidence and
elevation which it produces, and presents a good

excuse for any little ireedom or extravagance of
manner which it may give rise to.
While this scene was going on, young and old
Barnard sat staring at each other, not very unlike
two simpletons. As for the old man, he thought
his guests were positively mad; and the young man
did not well know what to think about their
freaks. While they were in this quandary, in
desperate crash was heard in the passage; and
running out to see what was the matter, they found
that Jackson, in pursuing a servant maid who
endeavoured to make her escape through the
passage, had overturned the Captain, who was
kneeling before Miss Barnard. Jackson, the
maid, Creed, and the young lady, were lying at
heads and points in the hall; and Beauty, who
had left the kitchen in search of further mischief,
was riding about tie yard on the back of a very
large pig, which seemed just then very well dis-
posed to carry his rider directly to the scene of
action. Several dogs, (among others those of the
Captain,) attracted by the uproar, now ap
proached, and marvellously increased the con-
fusion. Two of them attacked the animal on
which Beauty was nounted, which ran directly
into the passage, and right against old Barnard,
who, giving way to the shock, fell flat on his face ;
while Beauty, losing his equilibrium, tumbled off
on the other side. Meanwhile, the hoy and dogs
rapidly pursued their course into the back yard,

rapering without compunction over the bodies of
.he fallen.
William Barnard was the only person who had
kept his legs in this scene of confusion ; and
seizing a stout cudgel, he proceeded forthwith to
still the quadrupedal tumult in the yard. Jackson
then arose ; and giving a signal to Beauty, they
both vanished in the twinkling of an eye, leaving
Captain Creed to settle accounts with the worthy
host.
The latter made an attempt to rise, but suc-
ceeded only so far as to support his body on his
right elbow, while Creed reclined opposite to
him exactly in a similar position at the feet of
Miss Barnard. She had contrived to rise up, and
had thrown herself on a bench close by in a state
of great real or affected agitation. It was a scene
worthy of the pencil of George Cruikshank.
As soon as the old man was able to speak, he
said,
"Well! but this is the strangest thing I ever
saw : in the name of God, Captain Creed, are
your friends mad? or is this the way that your
young London chaps usually go on ?"
"My dear Sir," said Creed, with a solemn
drollery of expression, quite irresistible, "I am
marvellously grieved at this affair. The fact is,
that your excellent wine got into the heads of
those young fellows; and there is no accounting
for what the wisest of us will do in such a state
I came out here to cr:deavour to stop their pranks,

if possible, but could not succeed. After all, my
dear Sir, they meant no harm, and will be very
sorry for what they have done when they get
sober. Nay, you may see that they are already
ashamed of it; for they have run off, not daring to
face you at present."
So saying, he got up and assisted old Barnard
to rise. He then turned round, and apologized
in most inflated language to Miss Barnard for the
conduct of his companions,whispering softly in
her ear, that it had interrupted the most delicious
moments of his existence. She simpered a reply,
and said that she entirely acquitted him of all
share in the disturbance.
Creed succeeded so completely in pacifying
both father and daughter, and insinuated himself
so far into the good graces of them both, that he
was invited to stop to supper; and he left them
between ten and eleven o'clock, in a state of high
satisfaction with himself, and a favourable dis.
position to pardon the follies of his comrades.
The next morniny Jackson himself made a par-
ticular apology, and all was soon forgotten.
Young Barnard now passed almost his entire
time with the visitors. The day was employed
in shooting, and making excursions about the
country; the evening in drinking and carousing
at the "Cock." They frequently dined also with
old Barnard, but without precisely renewing such
enes as the one we have been just describing :
but they were extremely gay and pleasant, and

became, all of them, most decided favourites with

ing to draw the mind of William Barnard back
to the dissipation of London. They did not yet
venture to make a formal proposal of the kind to
him: but their whole conversation at the Cock,
and elsewhere, turned entirely on the vast supe-
riority of life in the metropolis-the successive
scenes of endless pleasure that awaited those in
London' who had plenty of moneyand the advan-
tages of living like independent gentlemen with-
out the degradation and drudgery attendant on
labour and business.
Jackson would often say"My dear Mr. Bar-
nard, you have seen nothing of London ; and I
own, the little mishaps you experienced there
are not much calculated to make you pleased
with it: but it is not fair to judge of such a place
as the capital by one or two days' residence in
it; nor is it just to suffer an unlucky accident,
which one night would easily repair, to prejudice
us against any place. You have, I repeat, seen
nothing of London,-nothing of Vauxhall, the
Opera, Concerts, Balls, and a thousand other
enchanting places, where woman shines in her
highest charms,where music, and mirth, and
wit, and gaiety take their eternal round. You are
young, Mr. Barnard, and should take advantage
of your youth, to see and enjoy life. For my
own part, sooner than bury myself in a place

jke this, I would be contented to become a
senseless clod of the valley.
Besides, if you
make up your mind to live here, what can you
do ? nothing but live on the jog-trot life of your
::wher, without enlarging your ideas, bettering
your condition, or improving your property. But,
in London, a thousand glorious and easy modes are
open to a young man like you, by which you may
exalt your rank and increase your riches. . With
the means and the talents which you possess,
you cannot fail to make your fortune, and, what is
still better, to enjoy it like a man."
Such harangues of Jackson's had great weight
with Barnard, who looked up to him quite as a
superior being. The very elevation of the other's
language above the level of his own mind,
wrought a greater effect upon him. Stafford was
older, better educated, more accomplished in
everything, than himself. He was thoroughly
acquainted with life, and must know best what
was the most advantageous mode of conduct.
Beauty, also, was a most powerful auxiliary
in furthering the schemes of the party. He
attached himself more and more to Barnard ;
professed the greatest possible friendship for him,
the most intense regard to his interests. There
was something, too, as we have said, congenial
between them. Their intellects and education
were more nearly on a level, and there was a
similarity of disposition between them. In fact,
it was possible, that a similar course of circum-
## p. 221 (#247) ############################################

221
stances might have rendered Barnard exactly such
a man as Smith. His late good resolutions were,
perhaps, more the result of his rustic bringing-up,
his losses acting on a timid mind, and his fleeting
passion for Maria, than of an inherent disposition
or taste for virtue.
Smith was, then, continually urging him to give
up his rustic life and return to London; and
using all the arguments in his power to persuade
him to that course.
Yet it is difficult to say whether the trio would
nave eventually succeeded, had it not been for
the aid of another, and a far more powerful,
coadjutor in the person of Hannah. She and
Barnard had met frequently since the rencontre
in the Barn which we have described, and this
artful woman had contrived to keep his passions
in a high state of inflammation--never cloying by
too much of her society,always alleging some
pretext or other for shortening their meetings. She
was, also, continually throwing out hints and insinu-
ations that she might be forced, at no great distance
of time, to quit the country ;perhaps they might
meet again, perhaps not,'twas hard to say ; -- no
knowing what might happen. Thus she was per-
petually sporting with his feelings, alarming his
fears, exciting his passions, and keeping him in a
constant state of mental agitation.
When a young man has conceived so violent
a passion for a woman, as Barnard had for Hannah;
- when this passion has been ministered to in such
## p. 222 (#248) ############################################
222
THE RED BARN,
a way as it was by her; and when obstacles,
or apparent obstacles arise, while yet it is in
its meridian ;there is scarcely anything that
he may not be prevailed upon to do, to gain Lis
object. Then it is, that a clever and charming
woman has him completely in her power, and
can persuade hide to do what she pleases. He
remembers the ecstatic but transitory enjoy-
n.ent, from the repetition of which he is now
debarred, and may be debarred for ever !The
thought is madness! He dwells upon the delights
which he has but tasted, until his brain becomes
on fire, and his whole frame is fever! Then let
him meet the woman he adores, and she may turn
him any way she thinks proper !
Such was precisely the state in which Barnard
found himself, returning one evening rather late
from the "Cock." The influence of the wine
he had been drinking was not at all adapted to
lessen the violence of his feelings; for drinking
always gives a heightened colour and an ex-
aggerated dimension to the ideas which have pre-
possessed our minds, from whatever cause arising.
Those who fly to wine, to enable them to forget
their cares and sorro";s, generally find it but a
treacherous auxiliary. Those grievances which
oppress us only during the actual period of
their operation, it may make us forget for the
time; but they must be such as do not make the
deepest impression on the mind. The debtor, for
instance, whose notions of payment are rather

223
vague, may forget his debts, under the influence of
the bottle, when he knows he is safe from arrest
and imprisonment. The drudge of mechanical
and ill-paid labour may thus, when he has a few
hours of respite, enjoy himself in the lap of
oblivion, but, to the lover, wine will only recal
the idea of his mistress, associated with pleasant
or disagreeable feelings according to the peculiar
predicament of the case. The statesman or the
soldier, unjustly branded with disgrace or infamy,
cannot wash the stain from his recollection in the
sparkling bowl. The patriot cannot so forget the
wrongs of his country, or the secret murderer
drown the worm that never dies." The om-
nipotence of wine cannot
-minister to a mind diseased,
Raze from the memory a rooted sorrow,'
Blot out the written troubles of the brain,
And, with some sweet oblivious antidote,
Cleanse the full bosom of that perilous stuff
That weighs upon the beart."
Barnard, as he walked home, was thinking of
Hannah, dreading the idea of losing her, and
worked up almost to distraction by the recollection
of past and the doubt of future enjoyment, when
he saw, not far from the Red Barn, by which his
route lay, a figure which he immediately recog-
nized to be herself, notwithstanding a large dark
cloak in which she was enveloped.
He approached her, and thought that there was
a cast of melancholy over her features, greater

than he had observed before. She took his hand
without speaking, and they entered the Red Barn
together.
They sat down, and Hannah took off her cloak;
she had a white dress beneath it, and looked
umcommonly lovely.
" William," said she, with a deep sigh, "what
I dreaded has at last arrived : I must quit the
country;--we must part, I fear, for ever!"
"Good God! Hannah," said Barnard; "how
can you torment me thus ?-we must not cannot
part."

"We must," she resumed, in the same unaitereu
melancholy tone; "our destinies are not united.

mean?-explain yourself."
" William," she replied, "I am the victim of
persecution, and I must fly. I ar.no fortune-
teller; it was love which made me
that character,love for you, William : it was
folly, of which I am now the victim. I have been
snarked out by the magistrates, and I must go
hence to London."
"Can you not remain concealed here?" said
Barnard : "cannot I find for you a place of
concealment ?"
"Impossible!" she rejoined : " their vigilance is
not to be so deceived; I shorld be discovered and
brought to punishment: I could not surrive the
disgrace of it."
## p. 225 (#251) ############################################
THE RED BARN..
225
"But," exclaimed he, "is there no other way
of settling this business? cannot some interces -
sion be made with the magistrates, and you :
remain here with me, in some asylum of peace
and safety ?"
"No," she answered ; "they would listen to
nothing of the kind. We must fly, my dearest
William ! alas !-what did I say, we ?-no, I must
fly, and leave all that is dear to me behind. We
must never meet again, William-never kiss-
never embrace again."
She put her hands across her eyes, and began
to weep, (for tears are ever at the ready command
of woman).
Barnard was most powerfully affected, and,
without speaking, threw his arm round her waist.
She raised her glistening eyes, and looking up
into his face, said, with an expression of the
tenderest love,
"No, my dearest William ! we must have no
inore -mutual endearments.
It is all over now.
I was vain enough to promise myself years of
happiness with you,-but it was not to be; and
Hannah must now proceed alone through the
world--a poor, helpless, solitary wanderer!"
She sunk upon his bosom. The tone and look
with which she pronounced the last words were
touching beyond the power of description to
pourtray. The tearful eye of a lovely woman is
er bent on any man in vain, (at least I hope
Thrice the firmness of Barnard might have

yielded to the irresistible fascinationthrice his
penetration might have been deceived ;--nay,
such a woman could have persuaded where she
could not convince, and the wisest would have
walked into the snare with his eyes open.
"No! Hannah," exclaimed Barnard, "it
must and shall be. We shall not part ;-I will
follow youI will fly with you, anywhere,
everywhere."
Raising her head, and half encircling his neck
with one lovely arm, she said,
No, William ! it shall not be said that I
seduced you from your parents and your home :
though no parents can love you as I do, or no
home receive you half so warmly as this bosom."
"I tell you, Hannah, you are all the world
to me.
I will fly with you instantly to London.
Exist without you, I cannot."
"Well, William," she replied, after a pause,
" if it must be, I , but we cannot go to -
gether,that might excite suspicion. I will
proceed to London directly, leaving you an ad-
dress where to find me. You may follow as soon
as convenient to yourself."
"Well, be it so." said he ;-" but, Hannah,
though I am not to go with you, you must receive
from me the means of travelling." As he said
these words he drew from his pocket a sealed
letter, which he broke open, and took from it a
20 note, and presented it to Hannah.
" Never, William!" she replied;

injustice to my love. 'Tis true, I am poor, but I
can find the means of getting up to London
without putting you to expense.
Even were
I to walk, I would not do so; and I would go
through much more than that fatigue for you."
" Take it :why should you refuse ? are we
not one?is not all I possess yours ?----you will
only be receiving your own."
After some further pressing on his part, and
well acted disinterested refusal on hers, she was
at last prevailed on to accept the note ; which she
did, saying,
" William, I must consider this as but a loan:
in London I can support myself by my own work.
I have been well educated, and can do many
things to gain a living. Our connexion must be
disinterested."
She then gave him the direction where to find
her. It was agreed that he should follow within
four days, at farthest; and after a long, long
embrace, they parted.
Scarcely had Barnard
Barnard disappeared, and
Hannah, resuming her cloak, quitted the Bam,
when a figure, above the middle size of manhood,
was seen running from the shade of the trees
into the broad moonlight, and crossing the field
towards her, also enveloped in a cloak, with a
foraging cap upon his head. He approached and
addressed her
"Well, have you succeeded, good lady ?-is he
safe within the toils ?-is he oursis he yours?",

"He is mine," said Hannah," as securely as the
triple chain of love can bind him ;-that he shall
be yours, Stafford, will depend upon yourself." ;
"I care not for him," said Jackson, "nor
would I share in the paltry plunder: this head,
and this good right hand, will always minister
amply to my own personal necessities. I would
not dirty my fingers with the gold of the clown,
were it not for the sake of my comrades ;they
must be secured."
"So must I, Stafford; I cannot labour for
nothing: if your comrades are to have the wings,
I must have the body."
"And the soul too, I presume," said he,
" sateless woman! will nothing satisfy you but
bis utter ruin ?"
"How marvellously compassionate you are
grown, Mr. Jackson," retorted Hannah; "but
why not extend your pity to an innocent girl,
whose ruin seems necessary to satisfy you?"
" Fudge !" said Jackson, "there's no ruin in
the case : but you have touched a subject that
concerns me more nearly than the fate of Barnard.
I meet with more difficulties in that quarter than
I expected: your further assistance will, I fear,
be necessary
Well, Stafford, you know the terms I do
nothing for nothing."
"I know it too well," replied he ; "your avarice
is as insatiable as your other passions."
"Beware what you say, Jackson," said Hannah,

THE RED BARN.

her dark eyes flashing fire; "if I desert you, you
will not only fail in your present scheme, but you
shall hear from me further."
"Your threats," said Jackson, coolly folding his
arms, "are like the idle wind. Did I not raise
you from miseryfrom the precarious life of pros-
titution, and place you where your lap shall be
filled with treasure; yet you hesitate to render
me a trifling service, without being paid down for
it. If I desert you, you will be poor indeed."
"Stafford," replied Hannah, "I know you to
be proud as Lucifer, reckless of danger, fearing
neither God nor man. But there is one point
where you are vulnerable, and there I can touch
you ;-a word from me, and Maria is lost to you
for ever."
" Hannah," returned Jackson, " we are neces-
sary to each other : altercation between us is
useless and absurd.What sum do you desire ?"
"Fifty pounds cannot be too much," replied
Hannah.
"Well-well," said he, "you shall have the
money."
"It must be soon done," said Hannah; I must
have this before Barnard can arrive in London."
"To-morrow night," said Stafford, "we shall
meet and arrange the whole,-an hour after mid .
night."
They separated as they had met.--cold and
passionless : there was no love or sympathy
between them. Stafford was like an angel fallen

from his sphere, sullied with terrestrial propen-
sities, though haughty and high crested still. She
was an incarnate fiend, deaf to every inspiration
but that of Mammon.
Hannah glided like a spirit into the valley, and
Stafford passed into the road. as the village clock,
tolling the hour of two, echoed through the silent
fields; while the moon s paie orb slowly sunk,
and left the horizvi iu lemporary darkness.

Jackson, instead of returning to the "Cock
proceeded to the cottage of Maria, resolving to
try the full powers of his eloquence in persuading
her to elope with him directly, and thus avoid the
further intervention of Hannah in that quarter.
It may be necessary to inform our readers that
these lovers had had nightly meetings regularly
since the last which we described, in which
Stafford Jackson had tried all his persuasive
powers to no purpose, she making marriage a
sine qua non of her consent to be his. Still her
attachment to him grew stronger and stronger,
more especially since the unaccountable absence
of William Barnard, of whom she had heard or
seen nothing since the day on which she gave
him an indefinite promise of marriage. This,

though it surprised, was far from displeasing her,
as she considered it a tacit dissolution of her
promise. But Jackson had not given her any
sufficient explanation of the reason of his not
coming openly forward to demand her from her
father. He had only stated in vague and general
terms, that motives of the greatest weight ren-
dered a temporary secresy necessary. Therefore,
though she admitted those clandestine meetings,
yet her reason and her virtue were both still
sufficiently strong to prevent her from proceeding
further.
Jackson had a particular signal by which he
used to advertise "Maria of his approach. This
signal was giving three gentle taps under her
window, which she always left half open, in the

, .
he thought proper, from some whim or other, or
perhaps thinking it would produce a greater effect,
to preface his usual signal by the following song
of his own composition, sung in a gentle but
very impressive style. Stafford, as we have
already seen, was both a poet and a musician;
and the taste and feeling with which he sung this
ballad proved him li vicinaiy singer.
Sweet are the breezes of nigb,
When the forehead is fevered with care,
And sweet is hope's roseate light
When it dawns on the night of despair.
Bnt thy lip is sweeter lar
Than the balmy breath of nigbi,

After this, Jackson tapped thrice at the window,
and Maria immediately descended.
He now commenced, as usual, to depict the
ardour and sincerity of his passion, in the most
glowing coloursto complain of her cruelty and
delayand to press her to an instantaneous elope-
ment, under the promise of future marriage.
She replied gently, but firmly, that she never
could become his under any other condition than
that of an open marriage, and with the cogni
zance of her parents.
"Then," said he, "Maria, I perceive all my
hopes are vain. Cruel girl! you drive me to mad-
ness and despair !-you care nothing for me ;-
you love another."
" It is not so," answered Maria; "I do not
love another ; but I must not act wrongly-I must
not wound the hearts of my parents.
"Maria, you have no confidence in mein my
onour-in my affection."
" Yes, I have too much. Is not my meeting

But you

would persuade me to do what is wrong
-you would take advantage of
my
foolish love."
"Oh, Maria!" rejoined he, "I would only
persuade you to consult your own happiness and
mineto listen to the suggestions of the fondest
and truest heart that ever loved."
"You have told me," said Maria, " that you
have reasons for not speaking to my father now;
but you have not told me what those reasons are.
I have some cause to complain of your want of
confidence."
"Hear me, then, Maria,-my existence is at a
stake ;-the safety of my life depends upon con-
cealment. My love to you, even at this moment,
exposes me to imminent danger in coming into
this part of the country. I stand accused of
murder, and the emissaries of justice are abroad
to seize my person, and bring me to punishment."
"Great God!" said Maria, shrinking from him
with horror, "a murderer !"
" Yes, Maria, I am called a murderer, but I am
not one. I have killed a man, 'tis true, but it
was in self defence; he might as well have killed
me."
" How did it happen?" said Maria.
"I received from a gentleman the grossest
insult which another can receive,-the lie and the
blow: manhood could not bear it;-I challenged
bim to the aeid. We met in a secret place, each

attended by a friend, and a surgeon accompanied
us: we fired, and my opponent fell instantly dead
upon the spot."
"But, I imagine I have read, at least," sairl
Maria," that such cases were pardonable by law."
" True," rejoined Jackson, "when it can be
clearly proved that all has been fairly conducted;
but, unfortunately, in our case, this cannot be
done. The only witnesses we had have unac-
countably disappeared; therefore, until they can
be found, I stand in the light of a murderer, and
must infallibly be condemned and executed, if
brought to trial now."
"Good God! how shocking," exclaimed Maria:
but still you might trust my father--he would
never reveal the secret."
" Maria, I can trust no one but you: my
friend, whom you have seen with me, is in as
much danger as myself. He was my second :
I dare not compromise his life, however careless
I may be of my own. God knows that your
eruelty renders it but of little value ;-) care
little now how soon it may be ended."
Maria was deeply moved,-her feelings were
strongly excited; and had Jackson contented
himself with pressing the elopement only, he
might, perhaps, have succeeded; but he thought
the opportunity favourable for a complete con-
quest. He embraced her-he kissed her; and, ,
impelled by wild passion, urged his suit in terms
that alarmed Maria: she struggled, and springing

from his arms with a sudden strength lent her by
innate virtue, was inside the house, and had
closed the door in the twinkling of an eye.
Jackson stood confounded, ashamed, and in-
dignant. He cursed, at one time, his own pre-
cipitance, by which he feared that he had entirely
lost her; and, at another, his own fatuity and folly
in thus wasting his money, his talents, and his time,
in pursuit of a simple country girl. Sometimes
he thought of giving her up altogether; but,
again, he thought of her charms; and the
difficulties he experienced, increased his estima-
tion of the object he desired, and his ardour in
its pursuit. His vanity, too, was piqued, and he
deemed his honour to be interested in the success
of his enterprize.
Stafford was a man who had been highly suc-
cessful with the other sex;-he had found beauty,
rank, and fortune, easily accessible: most of the
women with whom he had intrigued had met
him half way. He had never before been engaged
in a case of seduction, properly so called ; and
the thought of being baffled by an untaught rustic
country girl, at once perplexed, puzzled, and
enraged him, and rendered him more eager and
determined on her possession.
Such was the train of thought in which Jackson
returned to his inn. He slept a few hours, and,
on rising in the morning, soon settled within his
own mind the plan of operations he should
pursue.
It was first of all necessary to repair the blunder

THE RED BARN.
237
into which his precipitant passions had hurried
him; he, therefore, sat down, and penned the
following billet-doux, which he entrusted to his
worthy compeer, Mr. Beauty Smith, to take an
opportunity of delivering into Maria's own hand,
unperceived by any one else. It ran thus :-
" DEAREST MARIA,
" Can you forgive the error--the madness of
love? I own my crime, but you are my apology.
Who, alas! can look on heavenly charms like
yours,
and preserve his reason? Forgive me-oh!
forgive me, my dearest Maria, and see me once
again. I shall be at your window at the same
hour as when I saw you last; and do give me five
minutes' hearing : I cannotwill not, survive your
refusal; and my death must rest on you."
Beauty took this note to Maria's cottage when
her father and mother were out, and delivered it
to her, saying from whom it came; and, hinting
that he himself ran some risque in being abroad
at that hour, speedily withdrew.
The girl's state of mind may well be conceived,
-though better, perhaps, by my fair readers than
any others.
The conduct of Jackson, the night before, had,
at first, both alarmed and offended her; but she
loved the man--and love, like charity, covereth a
multitude of sins. If he was afraid that his
conduct had lost her to him, she, on her side;
## p. 238 (#264) ############################################
238
THE RED BARN.
was not without her apprehensions that he might
be lost to her. "Perhaps," thought she, " he will
come no more ;" and the idea of losing him was
one preguant with pain. In this state of mind
she received his note, and her feelings in his
favour were renewed. She forgave his audacity,
pitied his dangerous situation, which was con-
firmed by Smith; but still determined not to elope
with him on the mere promise of marriage.
The reader may be surprised at this firmness on
the part of Maria in this point-a girl, otherwise
80 susceptible, so open to the temptations of
vanity, and so simple, and even giddy in character.
It was partly the result of being brought up in a
strict veneration for all religious institutions, and
partly of a little female policy, that led her to
endeavour to secure thoroughly the splendid
establishment to which she deemed herself des-
tined, but now, her affections were engaged,- and
when that is the case, both principle and policy
will in time give way; still time is necessary.
The day, the evening, and the night, had
passed, but passed on leaden wings to all the
parties concerned in this affair. Hannah was
anxious to secure her reward, and be off to
London; Jackson was anxious to bring matters
to a conclusion ; and Maria was anxious to be
thoroughly convinced that he was a man of
honour, and to extend to him her forgiveness.
The midnight hour had stolen by, and the bell
was now tolling one, when Jackson and Hannah

239
met again, according to appointment made on the
preceding night. Characters like them seldom
exchange salutations, or waste time in ceremony,
Jackson abruptly broke silence.
Go," said he, "now is the time; give three
taps under her window-she will think it is I,
and will come down : the rest I leave to your
own judgment and address,-only observe to
impress upon her mind the safety of her trusting
me."
But, Jackson, remember our contract."
Away!" replied he,"my word is passed-it is
enough."
He threw the folds of his ample cloak over one
shoulder, and disappeared. Hannah proceeded
to the cottage.
It may be supposed that Maria was not asleep:
she was up, and in anxious yet fearful expectation
of her lover, though the appointed hour was not
yet arrived. The signal, so well known to her,
is heard, --she descends in silent rapidity-opens
the doora figure appears in the shade--she pauses
-the figure advances, and Maria beholds the
fortune-teller.-Her astonishment was unbounded.
"Great God !" said she, "is this you? What can
bring you here at an hour like this ?
" Your welfare;-I watch over you, Maria, as
the guardian angel over his charge--all hours are
alike to me."
"But that signal how could you learn that!
I thought there was but one

"Is my art nothing, child ?" returned the Sybil;
"is my intercourse with beings of brighter spheres
nothing ?-But let us not waste words, for I have
far to travel ere the morning dawn; nor can I be
always with the children of the earth :-speak,
have you seen him ?"
: "I have," said Maria, "more than once.".
5,6 I knew it before you spoke-I saw it all in
the glass of vision. Spare yourself a further
recital,you have seen him, heard his proposals,
and refused your consent, Maria ! you may, if
you please, dash the cup of fortune from your lips,
but it may not be presented to you again."
Maria was silent and confused. The sorcerers
resumed
" Have you forgotten all that has passed ?
have not all my predictions been fulfilled? Have
you forgotten the supernatural voice that saluted
you from the thicket?"
Maria trembled, yet replied, "But you know I
was in doubt between two persons."
" Let that doubt, then," said Hannah, "be
dissipated for ever : Barnard can never be yours,
he loves another ;-he is irrevocably pledged to
her;--their destinies are sealed above."
Had she said below, it would have been nearer
: the truth.
-1. Maria felt not a little surprised; but Hannah's
words perfectly explained the hitherto unac-
countable absence of Barnard.
" As for him," said she," I never loved him."

" You encouraged his addresses, though," said
Hannah ;
nay, you promised to marry him."
Here Maria testified the utmost surprise, and
owned it was trueand that, from the other's
absence, she thought Barnard might be the man.
"You see," resumed the Sybil, " I know every-
thing; will you trust me now?-he was not is
not, the person : the other is, and yet you refuse
him ;--why do you act thus ?"
"Because," said Maria, "I fear to go without
the consent of my parents; and, perhaps, he may
not marry me."
" Weak victim of incredulity!" exclaimed
Hannah, "why should you doubt him?--he
is young, handsome, rich, and full of honour.
Has he not told you his reasons for conceal-
ment? Mark my words ;it is in your power
to make or mar your fortune; so take your
choice."
" Then you counsel me to accept his offer," said
Maria.
"I do," she replied; "I exhort-I conjure you,
for your own sake, to do so; you will find in the
end that I counsel wisely. Remember, wavering
girl, who it is who speaks to you ;-one whose
predictions, regarding you, have all been fulfilled
-one who has told you everythingone who
holds communion with the world of spirits to
whom the veil of futurity is rent away, and wh
can read your inmost thoughts. Go with him
and be happy--stay and be wretched !".

Maria was, as we have mentioned in an earlier
part of this history, extremely superstitious.
This appeal, therefore, of Hannah, after all the
manifestations she had given of her superior
intelligence, added to Maria's own feelings for
Stafford, proved, for the time, irresistible: she
promised to agree to the elopement with him.
Hannah, having thus gained the object of her
mission, now left her, and acquainted Jackson with
her success.
Maria had but little time to reflect on the
scene which we have just described, when she
heard the three taps repeated under her window;
and going down, found Stafford himself below.
She received him with the most trembling
agitation. He commenced by entreating her
forgiveness for his conduct at the preceding
meeting, imputing it to the desperation of his
love, &c. He then reiterated his prayers that
she would agree to an elopement; and, in her
then state of mind, drew from her a promise to
that effect. Maria told him nothing of the
fortune-teller, for these are subjects that girls of
all classes invariably keep secret from their lovers.
Before they parted, it was agreed that Jackson
should come the following night at eleven o'clock
to an appointed place near the cottage,- that
Maria should meet him there,-proceed with him,
and, -quit her peaceful home for ever.
Jackson returned to his inn, fushed and
triumphant with his success; and Maria retired

THE RLD BARN.
243
to her bed with very different feelings. When sh 
arose in the morning, she began to reflect more
collectedly on the occurrences of the previous
night. She trembled when she recollected the
promise she had given, and trembled still more
at the idea of keeping it. That promise had, in
a manner, been extorted from her under the
influence of the strong excitement of love and
superstition combined. The principles of religion,
and of general rectitude, which had been early
instilled into her mind-hier warm attachment to
her parents, and that rague sort of terror which
every young person feels at the idea of quitting
home for the first time, and of quitting it clan-
destinely,-all concurred to make her regret the
pledge which she had given, and to wish most
earnestly to recall it. When she was no longer
overawed by the presence of Hannah, or persuaded
by that of Jackson, these motives re-assumed their
original force over her mind. The fortune-teller
had certainly given her such apparent proofs of
her skill and knowledge, as had very considerable
weight with her; but then she flattered herself that
this step of elopement was not necessary to the
fulfilment of her predictions in the main ; and the
more she dwelt upon it, the more she felt her mind
abhorrent from the measure.
As for Jackson,his safety, &c., she thought
that he could not be compromised by a private,
marriage, with the consent of her parents. This
last, indeed, was the point which weighed must

with her; for though she did not hesitate to con-
ceal from her father and mother the commence-
nient and progress of this amour, she could
not resolve to take the final step without their
knowledge and concurrence.
In short, the more she reflected on the subject,
the more she was determined against the elope-
ment: her virtue and her firmness were restored,
and she resolved to meet Jackson that night, and
put a decided negative on the matter.
She felt,
indeed, that her own peace of mind required that
she should do so.
Meanwhile, Jackson took consultation with his
comrades, and their whole plan was concerted : he
was to carry off Maria with himself alone, while
Smith and Creed were to remain behind to bring
up Barnard to London to rejoin Hannah. The
public-house, in Whitechapel, was to be the place
of rendezvous for them all to determine concerning
future operations.
However, on the night of the day on which
this matter was arranged, a circumstance occurred
which occasioned some slight change in their in-
tended measures. They had sat in the parlour of
the "Cock" to despatch a second bowlof punch, and
were waiting for the time appointed : it was now
about ten o'clock, when they heard a stentorian
voice, which seemed to come from the kitchen
of the public house, bellowing out-
"My name, d'ye see, 's Tom Tough,
P'ro seon a little service."
## p. 245 (#271) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
245
Jackson suddenly starting up, exclaimed, " I
know that voice;-I cannot be mistaken, -I have
too often heard it overpowering the tempest and
the roaring ocean.-Look out, Smith."
Beauty proceeded to the kitchen, which was
adjoining the parlour in which they sat, and
beheld a fellow in the dress of a sailor, but very
much tattered, with a large oil-skin hat upon him,
amusing a group of ale-drinking rustics. He was
about fifty years of age, of a most herculean
frame, and, had he stood upright, could not
be less than six feet; but habit, rather than
age, had bent his head, shoulders, and body,
into the form of a semi-ellipsis. He had a
wooden leg, or rather, more properly speaking,
a wooden prop under his knee, (for the limb
had not been amputated); he carried his left
arm in a sling, and had a large patch over his
right eye. His nose was unusually broad and
large, and exhibited the blooming hue of a red
cabbage. When he saw Smith, he took off the oil-
skin that covered his head,which was com-
pletely bald everywhere except upon the poll,
where the hair was thick and black, and hung in
strings over the collar of his jacket,--and eject-
ing a stream of tobacco-juice from his mouth, he
made a hornpipe scrape with his best pin, and
roared out,
* Worthy officer, I am a poor sailor-boy without
a stiver ;-help, your honour, an old tar,
timbers are ticklish."
## p. 246 (#272) ############################################

THE RED BARN,
" It is himself," said Smith, as he re-entered the
jarlour; "old Tom Ricketts."
The last words he spoke are enough," said
Tackson; "it is our signal : he comes from Warren
-I must see him."
Shall I hail him, and desire him to come in ?"
enquired Beauty.
" No, no!" replied Jackson, " that would be
suspicious ;-tell him to remain below, and call
for what he pleases."
Smith did so, and Jackson, in a few minutes
afterwards, took an opportunity to go into the
kitchen and fall in conversation with the sailor,
as if by accident.
"Well, ny hearty," said he " you have seen
some service in
your
time."
"Yes, your honour," replied Ricketts, "a few."
"What ship did you last serve in ?" rejoined
Jackson.
" The Spanker, your honouras tight a sloop as
ever sailed :-Captain Warren."
" Have you your certificate ?" said Jackson.
"Yes, your honour, here it is," handing him a
a paper.
.
Well," said Jackson, " I will just look over
it; and, landlord, give this honest fellow some-
thing to eat."
Jackson took the paper and went up stairs
On opening it, he found it was from our ola
friend, President Warren ; and its contents were
as follows:-

" This comes to let you know that the Spanker
is safe in the old cove. We first pushed for
Flushing, and sent some lads up to Antwerp,
where a little business was done : we have
cruised since along the north coast of France
Our cargo is pretty fat; but we can do nothing here
without you : so come with the first fair wind.
Old Blinker, that I left with you in London, told
me where you have dropped anchor ;-let go as
quick as possible.
" Yours,
" WARREN."
"Confound it!" said Jackson,"this is awkward;
but
go I must, or everything will be topsy-turvy
among these dunder heads. But for her:-I
have it,-she must go too. You, Captain, and
Smith, will wait to convoy Barnard, as Warren
would say
Jackson took a pen and ink, and wrote some-
thing on the back of the paper, then going down,
he returned it to the sailor, saying,
"Well, my lad, this is very good, mind you
take
care of it;here's something to help your journey."
" Long life to your honour!" said Ricketts,
giving Jackson a sly wink, to let him know that he
understood his directions.
The hour of appointment with Maria now
rapidly approached, and Jackson repaired to the
place of meeting He had previously prepared

everything for his journey to the coast, and had a
postchaise in readiness : he was in a travelling
dress, and well armed.
He came to the appointed place a little before
the time. Maria was not there. "If," said he
to himself, "she should trick me after all !
Doubtless she is vacillating stillbut surely she
will keep the appointment.--After all, what am I
about? Is not this most egregious folly? Is it not
something worse than folly ? Ah, Stafford ! Staf-
ford! I shrewdly suspect that you are something
not very unlike a villain.--Nonsense ! I love her,
and I will never desert her.
But how do you
know whether it will be in your power to keep
this resolution ? are not your means of living
dangerous and precarious, and does not your
own existence hang by a thread ?Well, I cannot
help it, I must have her."
Scarcely had he finished this soliloquy, when
Maria appeared in view. The instant he beheld
her, he saw how the case stood : she was dressed
exactly as usual, without the least appearance of
any preparation for a journey. But she looked
unusually lovely. Her chesnut hair escaped in
thick and clustering ringlets from under her
bonnet on each side. Her dress was white, and
her slender waist was cinctured with an emerald-
coloured zone. The night was calm, and the
leafy boughs under which they stood scarcely
moved, and the moon was brightly shining.
My dearest Maria," said Jackson, "are you

249
ready to go! but," continued he, looking at her,
* that surely is no dress to travel in ?"
Maria looked down, and did not answer.
"I see how it is," said he, "you mean to go
back from your promise. Maria, this is unkind,
unjust, and cruel.
"Hear me, Stafford," said she, collecting
unusual firmness; "I feel that that promise was
wrong-was contrary to the laws of God, and my
duty to my parents,-that I ought not to have
made it, and, therefore, that I ought not to keep it."
" 'Tis well," replied he, "love has but little
influence over you.
Were your love like mine,
it would surmount every other consideration.
But I see how it isyou are putting me off by
foolish excuses, that you may bestow yourself
upon another."
" As Heaven is above me !" exclaimed Maria,
"it is not so. There is none on earth that I prefer
to yourself; but I cannot-will not do what is
wrong.
Maria," resumed Jackson, in the tenderest
accents, " dearest Maria, will you see me die at
your feet ?"
" Jackson," said she, "I cannot hear you,-
I must not hear you.
"Maria !" he exclaimed, dropping on his knees
and seizing both her hands, "you must, -you
shall hear me."
"I will not," said Maria, endeavouring to dis-
engage herself --" I must away."
KK
## p. 250 (#276) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
" Well then, Maria," said he rising, "I will
compel you to your own happiness ;" so saying,
he enclosed her waist firmly with his left arm,
while he took, with the other hand, a small silver
whistle from his breast, suspended by a black
ribbon, and blew a loud and shrill call. In an
instant three men made their appearance. Two
of them were muffled up in cloaks, with which
they half concealed their countenances ; the third
was an herculean figure, in the dress of a sailor.
These men instantly seized Maria, who was half
dead with surprise and terror, and carrying her
off, put her into a postchaise which was waiting
in the adjoining road. Jackson followed, and
entered after her. The sailor mounted the seat
with the driver, and the two others, waving their
hats, one crying out in French, "Adieu, au revoir,"
rapidly disappeared.
It is now necessary to explain to our readers
how this affair took place. Jackson, who all
along feared the vacillation of Maria, was too
good a general not to provide against the cor-
tingency of her refusal. He had, therefore, sta-
tioned in ambuscade, at a convenient distance,
Captain Creed and Beauty Smith, who were the
two gentlemen in cloaks, and our new and worthy
acquaintance Tom Ricketts, who, divested of his
factitious leg and black eye-patch, and with his
left arm at full liberty, was there in propria persona,
sound of wind and limbs, the broad, bold, and
brazen, ruffian.

While this matter was thus proceeding, Bar-
nard had prepared everything for his departure
for London : and for the purpose of gaining his
father's consent to this measurewhich, after all,
was little more than a matter of forma regular
and pressing invitation had been made to him by
Jackson, and the old man readily assented. He
supplied his son with money for the occasion.
The invitation given to young Barnard seemed,
in the eyes of his father, a thing just in season ;
for the visitors had concluded a bargain with the
old man, by which he agreed to part with corn
and hay to the amount of 178, to be paid for
in bills drawn by "Stafford Jackson, Esquire, of
Jackson Hall, near Truro, county of Cornwall, and
Captain Creed, of the Scarafooka Rangers !"This
corn was to be forwarded to London without
loss of time, and consigned there to the care of
Don Josiah Xiutototle, a Mexican merchant, and
a special agent of Jackson's, while
young
Barnard
was to superintend the arrival and delivery of the
cargo.
A note was left for young Barnard by Stafford
Jackson, explaining that business of some conse-
quence had obliged him to go to Ipswich in a
great hurry, but that he would soon rejoin him
in London. And the following morning, at five
o'clock, the former set out for the capital, under
the sacred superintendence of Mr. John Beauty
Smith, and that distinguished officer of Light
Infanry, Captain Cornelius Creeil.

WHEN Maria recovered a little from her sudden
fright, it was in vain that she attempted to remon-
strate with Jackson on his violent and treacherous
conduct, and implored him to return and set her
free. Her prayers, entreaties, and tears, were all
to no purpose. Jackson answered them only by
protestations of eternal love, and eternal fidelity.
He declared,-he swore, that his intentions were
nothing less than honourable that he was about
to marry her; but that, from her wavering and
distrustful conduct, he found himself obliged to
compel her into a measure necessary to their
mutual happiness.
How far this rhetoric might in the end have
prevailed upon Maria, it is hard to say. Certain

If an
it is that she loved the man, and love will do
muchbut at present she felt both frightened
and irritated by his conduct. The thought of
quitting home in such a manner, the state in
which her parents must be on missing her, and
her vague apprehensions of the future, all rushed
with full force upon her mind, and almost reduced
her to a state of distraction. At the present
moment, and under the influence of such feelings,

opportunity offered, she would not have hesitated
to jump out of the carriage to accomplish this
purpose.
They had now moved rapidly on without inter-
ruption for about sixteen or seventeen miles.
The moon had long sunk below the horizon, and
darkness had overspread the face of heaven. It
was that cold and melancholy hour which precedes
the break of day, in the after season of the year.
The gathering clouds increased the gloom of the
scene, preventing the star light, and the twilight
struggling in its birth, from diminishing the
palpable obscurity. As far as it was possible
to discern, the landscape around was a wide and
barren waste. One of those lonely moors which,

of cultivation, like the ocean rolling between
verdant islands, or the patches of desert which

THE RED BARN.
"A dreary plain, forlorn and wild,
The seat of desolation, void of light."
Just in this spot, and at this hour, the travellers
were suddenly arrested and astonished by a
violent shock, accompanied with a loud crash.
Something had evidently come in instantaneous
contact with a wheel of the chaise; but before
Jackson had time to inquire the cause, he heard
the following dialogue take place outside, not in
the softest tones imaginable.
"Helm's a-lee; shiver my timbers, Tom, but
we have run foul of a frigate."
" Ay, ay, Sir; this comes of navigating in these
narrow guts by night ;--there is no sea-room
here."
"D-n your eyes!" roars a voice from the seat of
the chaise; "there's plenty of sea-room if you
knew how to steer, you lubber."
"D-n your eyes again!" rejoined the former
speaker; "I knew how to steer before you could
splice a hand-line, you great ill-looking porpus."
"Sheer off, I say," roared Ricketts from the
top, " or by the holy Pope we'll pour a broadside
into you ;that's flat. D-n me, I'd sink your
cockle-shell with a two-ouncer."
" Come, come, shipmates," said the first speaker,
in a fine mellow naval tone, "let us not figlio
about straws,--we all carry the same flag here :
this is an accident that will happen sometimes in
these narrow straits,-let us try to get clear as
well as we can."

There is (if I may be allowed to use a figure
of speech bordering on a blunder), a sort of
physiognomy in the human voice, by which
character is indicated. Something there was in
the honest, open, clear, and manly tones of the
last speaker, that would impress any hearer with
an idea of his good nature, sincerity, and courage.
Such, at least, was the impression which they
made on the mind of Maria, who was struck with
a sudden thought that the opportunity of escape
was now presented. Obeying without hesitation
the almost instinctive impulse of the moment, she
cried out,
" Whatever you are, take pity on a helpless
young girl, who has been dragged away from her
parents and her home against her will ;-if you
are men, you will have pity on and help me."
"Halloa, Tom !" exclaimed the last male
speaker, "here's a pirate we've run foul of;--an
Algerine, by Jove! with a prize in tow."
" Aye, ay, master, I sees as how it is."
" Well, Tom, we must try and re-capture :
hang the sailor that would not fight for a pretty
girl, if he was as old as the Royal George."
" So says I, master," rejoined the person ad-
dressed, descending from the gig and coming
round to the carriage-horses' heads.
" Drive on, I say, postillion," cried out Jackson;
"I command you, Sir, drive on."
" I'll be d-d if he does though," said the
person in front, who held back the horses.

go ?"
"If
you
don't let go the horses' heads I'll shoot
you !" roared out Jackson.
"No blustering, young man ; save your fire for
a better opportunity," returned a voice.
"You are highwaymen."
6 You lie !"
Will
you
let
No!"
" Then take the consequences, scoundrel," saia
Jackson, discharging a pistol through the front
window.
He failed, however, in hitting the person
intended. The other descending from the gig,
was just about to fire into the chaise, when he
recollected there was a female within, and checked
himself. Ricketts now jumped from the chaise,
and knocked the pistol out of his hand. They
then grappled.
Jackson now jumped out, leaving Maria nearly
senseless with fright, and rushing to his horses
heads, aimed a blow at the person there with the
butt-end of his pistol. The latter received the blow
on his left arm, and wielding a sturdy cudgel in his
right hand, directed a stroke which, had it fallen
as it was intended, on the head of Jackson, would
have left him in a very ill condition for further
fighting. But he avoided it with the rapidity or
lightning, and, by a simultaneous movement,
tripped up the heels of the other with his foot,
and levelled a blow at the side of his head, which
instantly laid him prostrate. Jackson now striding

over him could perceive, by the imperfect light
from the chaise lamp, that he had a wooden leg ;
and on looking closer, recognized him to be no
other than Tom Squires, the ancient foreman of
his respected friend, Captain Carribles !
But for this discovery it might have gone hard
with poor Squires; for though a powerful man,
his wooden leg and the difference of age rendered
him no match for Stafford Jackson. The latter,
however, contented himself with keeping him in
his prostrate position.
Meanwhile, Ricketts and Captain Carribles (for
it was no other) were engaged in a very unequal
contest. The loss of his right arm, though he
could use his left extremely well and was other-
wise a very powerful man, was a tremendous
disadvantage to the Captain : still he fought
extremely like a tough old tar. Ricketts, how-
ever, soon got the better of him, and was in the
act of planting a blow of a bludgeon that would
have settled his antagonist for ever, when the
giant and now ferocious slayer was himself sud-
denly felled to the earth by an unknown arn.
He was struck in the neck, just under the ear,
and down he fell at the feet of his antagonist
perfectly senseless.
Carribles looked round for his deliverer, and
saw, by the light of the lamp, a tall athletic young
man in the dress of a soldier, with a knapsack of
his back.
L L

Jackson, still standing over Squires, beheld
this scene. On seeing Ricketts fall, he ran tr
him directly, attempted to raise him up, but
found him completely senseless. He looked around,
and saw Carribles engaged in shaking hands with
the soldier, and praising him for his bravery,
instead of following up their advantage.
Jackson was, a man whose presence of mind
never forsook him: he saw at a glance that the
field was lost. His companion was senseless, and
could render him no assistance, and he would
have been no watch alone against three adver-
saries. On the post-boy he could not calculate;
besides, a discovery, in the present instance, and
the being prevented from going to the coast,
would decidedly be fatal to him.
All this, which has taken us up so many words
to explain, passed through Jackson's ear in the
twinkling of an eye. He acted upon it with the
most instantaneous promptitude: having struck
out the lamp, all was involved in obscurity; he
then, by a powerful effort, raised Ricketts in his
arms, and carrying him to a low wall on the
opposite side of the road to where Carribles and
the soldier stood, threw him over it into a field,
and immediately leaped after him.
Old Carribles, after having nearly shaken off
the hand of the young soldier, bethought himself
that there was some more work to do.
"But where are these pirates?" cried he, groping

259
about; "they were here just now, one of them
at least. Holloa, Tom! where are you ?
Ay, ay, Sir," echoed Tom, trying to rise, but
to no purpose "here I am at the forecastle,'
"Come astern, then," roared Carribles.
" I cannot rise without help : bear a hand here,
your honour, and give us a heave."
Tom was not disabled by the present action,
it was his wooden leg which obliged him to re-
quire a hand.
The young soldier ran round and helped Tom
to rise. They then commenced a search for the
fugitives, but, of course, to no purpose : and they
were most confoundedly puzzled to think what
had become of them.
Split my mizen," said Tom, "but I think it
was the old boy himself, and his right-hand man,
Beelzebub I never felt such a grip in all my
born days."
"Stuff!" said Carribles ; "the scoundrel that I
tustled with was flesh and blood,-bone and
muscle, I should rather say, for he was as tuff as
an old oak ;--still my gallant young friend here,
the marine, felled him nobly :-d me, I shall
think better of a red coat as long as I live. But
the rascals have sheered off somehow, so let us
look after the prize."
So saying, he opened the chaise door and
spoke to Maria.
She had recovered by this time,
and to the questions put to her by Carribles, re-

plied, that she had been forced away from her
home, as she suspected, for no good purpose ; and
that she did not know what to do, or where to
stop, until to-morrow.
"Oh! my precious dear," cried the old Captain,
"don't be uneasy about that; I have a snug
little cabin for you to-night, close by, to the right
of the road; there you shall have all the accom-
modations that an old sailor can give you : stay
where you are for a moment, until we ease off
this gig wheel of mine from the chaise. Here,
Squires, clear away the craft, and let the marine
hold the horses' heads."
Tom Squires obeyed, and the Commodore,
advancing towards the soldier, who had posted
himself at the gig horse's head, addressed him
thus :
"And you, my brave red-coated friend, shall
be my guest to-night:-d-n me, if ever I call
a soldier a lobster again. Where are you bound
for, friend ?"
"A long voyage," replied the young soldier,
with a deep sigh; "I am going to the East Indies.
My regiment is at Ipswich, and I am on my way
to join them."
" Well, my boy," said Carribles, , you can
stop with me till morning, you shall have a
glass of grog, and a hearty welcome. D-n it!

a blue coat?we both serve the same king and

country, and we both like a pretty girl equally
well, and don't hesitate to expose our lives to
save her from ill usage.
The young soldier made no answer, but fetched
sigh still 'deeper than before. Carribles ob-
serving this, said,
"Come, my lad, don't be down-hearted; you
have left your sweetheart behind, I suppose : you
will see her again, and if she's a true girl, she
will think of you; if not, she won't be worth
thinking of."
"I have left none behind, Sir, who will think
of me, except my parents."
"Well, then," said Carribles, "you will have
a hundred sweethearts in India, only they are
black ones; so make yourself easy :--besides,
there's a few white ones there too."
" Never !" said the soldier, with peculiar
emphasis.
"I see how it is," said Carribles; "you have
been crossed in love ; but never mind, the lasses
are like eels,they will slip through our fingers
at times. Never mind, I say, there's as good fish
in the sea as ever was caught."
The wheels being now unlocked, Carribles
helped Maria out of the chaise ; and having
assisted her to get into his gig, took his seat
beside her, cheering her in the unsophisticated
language of his heart. Tom and the soldier got
up behind, and away they drove, leaving the
chaise in the middle of the road alone with the

THE RED BARN.
horses, for the post-boy, in his fright, in the
early part of the scuffle, had run aside somewhere
to hide himself.
We must now explain to our readers, how this
rencontre took place. Captain Carribles had
been dining with a friend, at some little distance,
and had sat rather late. Tom Squires (as was
his custom on such. occasions) had brought the
gig to fetch his master home. Carribles stayed
to supper, and Tom was also provisioned by the
gentleman's butler, who was very fond of Tom's
company. Both master and man, on leaving, had
their grog aboard ; and Tom, who was rather out
of lis element on land, and did not understand how
to manage the reins quite so well as the rudder,
had, by steering rather too much to leeward, fallen
foul of the post-chaise, and thus given rise to the
adventure, which, for the present, occasioned the
rescue of Maria.
While all the latter part of this scene was
taking place, Stafford Jackson remained very
snugly behind the wall, listening to what was
going forward. Though forced, for the present,
to give up Maria, he was rejoiced to find that he
had a certain clue to her; for the site of Carribles'
cottage was perfectly familiar to him. He did
not, therefore, despair about her; but his present
business to the coast brooked no delay, even if he
had sufficient force to attempt to reclaim her now.
He, therefore, when the others had departed, again
raised up Ricketts (who still remained senseless),

THE REV BARN.
263
threw him over the wall, followed, and, after
some difficulty, got him into the post-chaise.
He then roared out for the post-boy, who came
crawling out of a neighbouring ditch; and entering
the chaise himself, he proceeded on his journey,
if not with so fair a companion as his last, with
one, at least for the present, equally helpless.
The other party now arrived at the cottage of
Carribles. This original abode, with its peculiar
paraphernalia, we have already described. The
Captain had made no alteration in his establish-
ment from the time we allude to, except the
having hired an old woman as cook and house-
keeper. To her care, the old Captain, immedi-
ately on his entrance, with a delicacy that would
have done honour to a more polished character,
confided Maria, who retired with her; while he
himself, with his two companions, entered the
"state cabin."
Tom Squires now put some salt junk on the
table, and brewed some famous grog, not "too
strong of the water." Maria had begged to be
excused from joining them, and remained with
the housekeeper. During supper, the old hero
dilated on the event which brought the party
together, with as much pride as he was wont
to do when detailing the action of Trafalgar,
at which he lost his arm. Tom Squires also
put in his opinion when he could, with true
nautical warmth; to all which their guest listened

with politeness, but, from depression of spirits,
Juld not join them with his heart. Carribies
erceived this, and wished him to drink, as he
said it," like a sailor."
"Come, my hearty," said Carribles, giving his
hand to the young soldier, "make yourself at
home. Be happy like me. I'll give you a toast,
my boy, May our sailors and soldiers never
meet but in friendship, or part but in peace!
They had just concluded the honours of the
toast, when Maria entered for the purpose of
thanking her noble deliverer, ere she retired to
rest. The young soldier had stood up with his
face to the mantel-piece, admiring the arms which
were suspended over it. His figure was tall,
slight, and elegant, and appeared to much ad-
vantage in a very handsome light-infantry uniform.
He had not yet undergone the military crop, and
his brown hair curled luxuriantly behind his ears.
"Sir," said Maria, addressing Carribles, "I
have come to thank you most sincerely for-
The
young soldier started, and turned round at
the sound of the voice. She could proceed no
farther, but sunk upon the floor. It was Harry
Everton who stood before her!
He flew to her assistance, raised, and placed
er on a chair.
Recovering a little, she exclaimed, "Good
Heaven! is it you, Harry,and in this dress ?"
Yes, Maria !" replied Everton, " this dress is

most suitable to me now. The man who das no
hope at home, cannot do better than go abroad, and
sacrifice his life for his country."
She was overwhelmed with confusion: a sudden
torrent of the bitterest feelings rushed upon her
soul. The early ties of infantine association, and
youthful friendship, recurred forcibly to her mind.
Her feelings had been much changed from those
of her early days: she had learned to love; and
now, at least, she knew how to pity a hopeless
passion, though she could not return it. The
amiable character, too, of Harry; his long and
silent love; the desperate step he had taken, of
which she could not but accuse herself; and the
idea, also, that she might have been much happier
with him than any other;-all served now to torment
and afflict her. After a long and painful pause,
she exclaimed, "Oh, Harry! I am the cause of all
this," and burst into a flood of tears.
"Don't weep, Maria," said Harry, while the
tears started into his own eyes; "your tears un-

"I shall say no more on that subject," said
Harry, resuming his firmness; "such thoughts
ought not to be expressed now.
But I rejoice,
Maria, that you have escaped this night, and that
I have been a partial instrument in protecting you.
I hope, at least, that you will now remember the
warnings of my friendship, which you so utterly
disdained when I saw you last."
" Oh!" said she, "I will-I will ;-do not
do not, talk to me now."
Carribles and Tom Squires looked on this
scene in silent amazement: the former saw how
things were, and was greatly affected : at last he
broke silence, saying,
"Come, come, my children, dry up your tears ;
you may come together yet, and be happy."
"That is impossible, Sir," said Everton ; "she
never loved me--never can love me: I know it
too well, and her happiness is far dearer to me
than my own. Besides, am I not bound to a
distant land ?-Does not the voice of honour call
me away ? Even were her feelings different,
there is now an impassable bar between us ;-[am

self proudly; "have I not sworn to serve my
King and countryand shall I break my oath ?-

"Enough, enough," interrupted Everton; "you
see how it is.--Honoured Sir," continued he, "I
thank you for your hospitality, and must take my
leave."
No, no!" said Carribles, " you must stop
until morning."
"Dear Sir," replied Harry, "I cannot I shall
be late with my corps. Besides, I could not
remain here in my present frame of mind. I
must plunge on into business to forget my feel-
ings. Farewell, Sir ;-farewell, my honest friend
(lo Squires ;)-adieu, Maria," said he, taking
her hand in a hurried manner, and pressing
her wildly 'to his breast, while his voice
became broken with emotion, "remember me as
a friend !"
So saying, he raised up his knapsack, and
rushed out; while Maria sobbed aloud,
Harry! don't, don't go,we may be happy
yet."
The words came too late;--Harry heard them
not-he was gone for ever.
Carribles ran out into the road after Everton,
exclaiming,
"Stop, young man; you have saved my life this
night. Think you that old Joe Carribles ever

him his purse, " to help your voyage.
"Sir," said Everton, putting back the purse,
"I am paid by my King, and I have done nothing
but my duty. I should have assisted any one
else who was fighting against odds, in a just
cause : I desire 10 reward but the satisfaction of
having acted rightly."
Well, well," said Carribles, "my brave lad,
I did not intend to offend you ; but you must
not go without some token of my friendship and
gratitude :-this watch you must take, and a
better never kept time in every latitude."
It was in vain that Harry refused to take the
silver watch: he saw that the old man would
have been offended, it he persisted in bis denial;
therefore, he accepted it. Old Carribles shook
him again and again by the hand, and was about
to urge a hope of Maria, when the youth rushed
away, and disappeared in the gloom of the night.
When Carribles returned in, Maria had retired.
Her agitation had quite overcome her strength,
and she was led to bed nearly in a state of
insensibility by the old housekeeper.
"Well, Tom," said Carribles to his old valet,
"how do you feel now ?"
Sir,"answered Tom, "I'm surtain there's ingins
about somewhere, my eyes water so. I never
recollect the like afore, except when I parted

"Nonsense," interrupted Carribles ; " I have

that tack. But now let us turn in; for hang me

While the transactions which we have just
described were taking place, Barnard and his
two worthy friends were on their way to London.
They arrived there without any accident deserving
of record, and stopped for the first night at the
old quarters, "The Blue Boar. Here on his
arrival the following note was immediately put
into the hands of Barnard by the waiter, who
first inquired his name.
"MY DEAREST WILLIAM;
"You will find me at No. 9, Kepple Street, Edg-
ware Road.
Come, my love, as quickly as you
can after the receipt of this note, for I am dying
to see you.
Ever yours,
6 11 W."

Barnard, on the following day, took coach at
an early hour, and went to the place indicated in
the note. He found it a small but very elegantly
furnished house, and this Hannah occupied alto-
gether, with one maid servant. The latter conducted
him to the drawing-room, where her mistress
was prepared to receive him reclining on a sofa.
Her present appearance struck Barnard, if pos-
sible, more forcibly than ever.
She had entirely
doffed the exterior of humble life, and assumed
that of a perfect lady, which her fine face
and figure most admirably qualified her to
personate. She was elegantly attired in a robe
of pale yellow muslin. Her luxuriant black
hair was most tastefully arranged under a rich
lace cap, and her brown complexion judiciously
relieved by a slight addition of artificial colour.
Hannah was a perfect mistress of the science
of the toilet; and on the present occasion she
had put all her skill in requisition with such
effect, that she looked not only most exquisitely
beautiful, but appeared to be many years younger
than she really was.
On Barnard's entrance, she arose and embraced
him, and placing him beside her on the sofa,
with his hand within hers, said --
"My dearest William, I am so delighted to
see you. Now I trust we shall never part. This
house must be your home from this time ;-all
that is in it is yours-myself included," added
she, smiling, and throwing herself into his arms.
## p. 272 (#298) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
" Hannali, my love, I am content; but only
on condition that I shall bear the expense."
"Do not talk, William, about paltry money
matters," she replied.
"On no other terms can I possibly consent,
emphatically returned Barnard.
" It is no consequence which of us bears the
expense," resumed she ;"as long as we love each
other : what I possess is yours :-however, if you
will have it so, the expense shall be mutual, and
so let us say no more on that subject."
Barnard remained with her for nearly three
hours, during which time she gave him a long
and fictitious but plausible history of herself.
She told him that she was the widow of an officer
who had died in the West Indies. She also
found it necessary to account for the appearance
she made at present, by informing him that since
she returned to London she had been so fortunate
as to recover some prize-money to which her
husband had become entitled at the taking of some
of the French Islands during the war.
To the reader, an explanation of this fact is
almost unnecessary. Her connexion with Jackson,
the money she had made by smuggling trans-
actions, and other modes of finance, which his
penetration may enable him easily to guess at,
will suffice to account for the capacity of her
exchequer.
It was agreed, before they parted, that Barnard
hould return to dinner, bring his luggage from

THE RED BARN.
273
the " Blue Boar," and establish himself in his new
quarters from that day forth. lle begged leave
to introduce his two friends, who had come up
with him from Polstead, to dinner; to which
Hannah, who, as the reader knows (though
Barnard was ignorant of it), was well acquainted
with them, most readily assented.
Barnard accordingly returned to his inn, and
for the first time communicated to Creed and
Beauty the secret of his amour. They rallied him
a little on his good fortune, and complimented
him on the mysterious secresy with which he
had hitherto concealed it. Of course they
accepted his invitation, and Barnard, having
packed up his trunks, returned to dinner with
his two companions.
It was not without some difficulty that the
two beroes preserved their countenances un-
moved, on being formally presented, by Barnard,
to their old acquaintance, Hannah Woods. She,
however, acted the part of a stranger admirably
well, and received them with a most lady-like
demeanour. Still, a very scrutinizing observer
might have discovered something like a smile
on her lips, when she bowed at the introduction
of " Captain Creed, of the Scarafooka Rangers !"
The Captain, however, did not appear in the
costume which his humour had led him to assume
at Polstead ; but actually affected something of
a military dress, and wore a blue frock coat
braided with black, hooked up to the throat
N N
## p. 274 (#300) ############################################
274
THE RED BARN.
Still his appearance was grotesque enough ; for,
by way of being ultra-military, he adopted the
addition of white kerseymere breeches and silk
stockings, wore a white cravat like a field-
marshal, and carried a "chapeau de bras." The
irresistible unmilitariness of his natural air
rendered this assumption most intolerably
ludicrous; and fortunate it was that as they
came along, a coach concealed his person from
the prying eyes of the ignoble vulgar.
It is not less true than strange, that many men,
utherwise not devoid of common sense, display a
taste in dress equally absurd and incongruous.
This is particularly the case with men who have
risen from obscurity, and are desirous of render-
ing themselves remarkable, and of playing a
character for which neither nature nor habit has
fitted them. It is not less singular, that many
men of similar pursuits to those of our noble
Captain, should adopt an eccentric style of dress,
which, one would imagine, must render them
dangerously conspicuous: but folly and knavery
re very closely allied.
The reason of Creed dressing in this peculiar
style now, was that he meant to go that night to
the Opera to superintend business; or, in military
phrase, to take command of his light bobs.
The party sat down to a good dinner, and en:
joyed themselves afterwards over some excellent
wine until about nine o'clock, when Creed and
Beauty departed, leaving Barnard to the full en.

joyment of the society of Hannah,--not without
each of them wishing that, for that evening at
least, he was himself in the same desirable
predicament.
The young farmer became every day more
and more intoxicated with the charms of Hannah,
and more and more pleased with a London life.
He began to acquire a most decided relish for
good living, and drinking good wine; and as
Creed and Beauty constantly visited him, they
did all in their power to maintain and strengthen
this improving taste. He likewise became a cox-
comb in his dress: the flattery of Hannah, added
to the insinuations of the others, having actually
had the effect of persuading him that his person
was agreeable. The idle life, too, that he was
leading, was greatly to his fancy; and, as hour after
hour, and day after day, glided over his buoyant
heart, he felt a greater and greater aversion to the
idea of returning to one of business and industry.
Affairs were exactly in this position, when
Beauty received the following letter from Jack-
son, which he immediately took an opportunity of
communicating to Hannah :-
" From the Coast, Sept. 29th, 18.
DEAR JACK;
"After an adventure of no pleasant kind, which
I shall mention by and by, I arrived at the old
spot, and found, as I expected, everything topsy-
turvy. The vessel, after the cargo was ianded

TUE RED BARN,
had pushed off to the Dutch coast with a few
hands (the only prudent measure that was
adopted). They had, however, been so clumsy
in conveying the goods ashore, and stowing them
away in the place near the Cove, that the Revenue
sharks got scent of the matter, and eight of them
made their appearance immediately after my
arrival. Concealment was out of the question,
so exact had been the information of the rascals
respecting the spot where the goods had been
deposited. There was, therefore, only one mode
left-namely, to fight it out. We were eight in
number also; but I was obliged to dispatch three
to translate the goods. While they were thus
employed, Warren, Ricketts, myself, and two
more, set upon the Revenue chaps in the follow-
ing manner :-we awaited their approach in a
narrow pass on the road, at a particular point
where there are two old walls, one on each side.
The road sinks very deep in this place, and from
it the walls may be about twelve or fifteen feet
high; but, on the other side, in the field, the earth
was raised so much, that a moderate-sized man
may look over the wall. I had eight or ten old hats
fixed on these walls, and placed three fellows
inside with pistols, and plenty of ammunition.
The moon was up, but the sky was very much
overcast with clouds. The Revenue fellows were
marching in a body, well armed. When they
entered the pass in question, Warren, Ricketts,
and myself attacked them suddenly, rushing out

277
from a place where we had been hiding. At first
they made a stout 'resistance, but on my calling
on those behind the wall to come on 'in a body,'
as I said, the three lads there commenced a
sharp fire; when the astonished sharks looked up,
and seeing the hats and the pistols flash, they
threw themselves into complete confusion-for
they thought we had a numerous partyand took
to their heels immediately. Our friends, in the
interval, thus gained time to transport the goods
to a place of safety.
"Now for the rascally adventure which took
place before this. For the present, my dear Jack,
I have lost Maria! we were going on at a spank-
ing pace, when a gig with two fools in it ran right
against one of our chaise wheels. Who, think you,
did the two mischievous asses turn out to be ?-
Why, nobody else than old Carribles and his man
Squires, whom you have heard me mention so
often. There was some cross firing about the
accident, between Ricketts and the latter, when
the girl suddenly took it into her head to roar
lustily to Carribles for help. The old boy and
his man Tom took up the cudgels for her, and
the four of us had a regular set-to. We should
have soon settled their hash, as you may sup-
pose, if the devil had not determined it otherwise,
I had just upset Squires, when in popped a
rascally soldier, and fetched Ricketts such an
infernal blow in the luy, as laid him senseless.
## p. 278 (#304) ############################################
278
THE RED BARN,
I saw, then, it was all up, so I took Ricketts
and got him behind a wall, where we both lay
concealed, until Carribles was off, and Maria
with him. I then took up the huge hulk, who
was still senseless, shoved him into the chaise,
and drove off. There he lay like a sack, and
never recovered until we had got eight or ten
miles farther on, I cursing my unlucky fate the
whole
way.
This accident, however, I shall soon
repair. I am determined she shall not escape
me. No! I'll have her in spite of the devil and
all his angels.
"The goods are safely lodged, Jack, in your cave,
and Ricketts has the care of them. I shall
remain for a while in this neighbourhood, and, if
necessary, write for you and Creed to come down.
I hope you have the young clod-hopper in proper
tune. You inust introduce him to Xiutototle at
the counting-house, and let the matter be managed
so that he shall have a strong opinion of the con,
cern. Hannah, no doubt, has him well meshed by
this time. D-n these women, they are the ruin
of us all !-Believe me, dear Jack,
"Very truly yours,
"STAFFORD JACKSON.
"P.S.-Compliments to the Commander of the
Scarafookas."
Hannah and Smith laughed heartily at Jack-
son's losing Maria ; with which adventure they

279
were not less amused, than they were pleased
with his successful management of the smuggling
business.
Smith and Creed, especially the latter, gained
more and more on the mind of Barnard every day.
The former was peculiarly successful in sapping
and destroying all remains of good principles in this
young man. He wormed himself completely into
his confidence, and was continually hinting the
superiority of his own rascally mode of existence,
to the jog-trot style of Barnard's former life. He
often dwelt upon the shameful inequality that
existed in the distribution of property ;-the in-
justice that one man should revel in every enjoy-
ment, while another was compelled to labour and
privation. Every man, he would say, had an
equal right to partake of the pleasures of this
life; and if he had no hereditary property, it was
proper that he should seek, by any method he
could employ, the means of enjoying himself.
Fortune had bestowed wealth on some men, and
nature had given wit to others; and it was per-
fectly according to the order of things that the
latter should prey upon the former. As for laws,
they were made by the rich for their own protec-
tion and the disadvantage of others. It was the
business of the strong to break, and of the witty
to evade, them. Religion was a mere humbug,
invented by knaves to frighten fools, and worthy
only of the contempt of the wise !
Such was the general substance of the lectures

aily delivered by Mr. Beauty Smith, proiessor
of ethics. The reader must not, however, imagine,
that he let out the whole of his villainy at once.
He took his measures with more caution, and
proceeded step by step. He commenced by
fostering Barnard's idleness, his love of pleasure,
and his taste for gaming. He then demolished
all the outworks of morality and religion, and
brought him gradually to look with indifference
on the violation of every principle of justice and
honour, and with fearlessness on the legal conse-
quences contingent on such violation. In doing
this he had no very difficult task: he found a
ready pupil in  Barnard, whose naturally coarse
and vicious mind only wanted the rays of such a
sun as Smith to bring forth an abundance of rank
weeds. No spontaneous twitchings of conscience
dictated an opposition to the doctrines thus
instilled into him, nor did a doubt of their danger
ever enter his head.
The impression produced on his mind by Smith's
liberal discourses, was mainly strengthened by his
peculiar situation. The funds which he had
brought with him to London were fast melting
away. He lost several small sums from time to
time at play with Beauty and Creed; but the
principal instrument in the dilapidation of his
finances was Hannah. The expensive establish-
ment which she kept up, and which it is almost
needless to hint to the reader, was supported en-
tirely on the strength of Barnard's purse, son

rendered him ready to iisten to any advice that he
thought might tend to relieve his embarrassments.
The reader has been apprized that one of the
pretences on which Barnard came up to town,
was to consign the corn, purchased with bills by
Jackson, to that meritorious but cacophonously
named individual Don Josiah Xiutototle. Barnard,
accompanied by Creed and Smith, waited on the
worthy merchant, whom they found in his count-
ing-house in Three King Court, Lombard Street.
This firm consisted of two partnersXiutototle
and Killgandersthe latter an Englishman. In
the outer office were two clerks, whoin Barnard
thought were about the most ill-looking and
dirty rascals he ever saw. Creed, however,
whispered to him not to mind their appearance,
inasmuch as foreigners of all nations were very
careless as to dress,--and asked one of them,
in French, whether the Don was within. He was
answered in the affirmative, on which they were
shown into an inner room.
Here, seated at a desk of the most awful
height, ramparted round with rails on all sides,
sat, as on a throne of state, the ineffable Xiutototle.
He was a tall stout man, about fifty years of age,
with a complexion like mahogany; wore a bushy
black wig, green spectacles, and mustachios
about three inches long. He was dressed in a
complete suit of snuff-coloured brown, and nad
on a green hat, with a leaf six inches wide, ana a
very low crown. There were piled upon his desk
O()

In reply,
several heaps of what appeared to be gold coins,
and several leather bags were suspended around,
seemingly containing money.
Barnard was about to mention the nature of
his business, but had not time to utter a syllable,
when the Don roared out in a voice of thunder
"Vat you vant, young gentaman?"
Barnard declared his business, but to no sort
of purpose ; for the Don either could not or would
not understand one word he said.
Xiutototle thundered-
" Be plast! be plast! Io not know los Inglas.
Man join me--he come a while agobe plast!"
This language was just as unintelligible to
Barnard, as his had been to the worthy Don.
Creed, however, appeared to understand it ex
tremely well, and said to Barnard" He means
to tell you to sit down: he does not understand
English, but his partner will be here directly."
Down they sat, and the partner, Mr. Killganders,
made his appearance. He was as great an original
as the head of the firm, but in a different way.
He could not have been more than five feet in
height at the most,---but extremely corpulent.
His face was round and red, his hair quite grey,
and his cheeks shaded with a profuse growth of
sable waiskers. With such a person, and such a
ace, he was dressed in the very extremity of
fashionable foppery.
"Well, gentlemen, what's your business ?" (He
spoke with the most astonishing rapidity of intonation

now.
-" what's your business ?-hot day,very hot
day" (wiping the perspiration off his forehead
with a cambric handkerchief).
Barnard explained.
" Aye-aye, very good, -very good. I know
Mr. Jackson -Jackson Hall,good customer, sir,
-good customer,-rich, rich, sir,--rich as a Jew:
very good, sir,very good, sir,your business, sir,
is donedone, sir, to a T. I'll give you the
acknowledgment, sir, in the twinkling of an eye."
He then rushed up to the desk at which
Xiutototle was sitting, and scribbled away like
lightning over a piece of paper.
There, sir," said he-"there; all's right, sir,
Mr. Jackson, sir, is a good man,-excellent
man,-wallowing in riches,-fine mark, sir-fine
mark, sir-your're a lucky man, sir;his bills are
as good as the Bank, sir. Lucky man, sir, to fall
into such hands,--plenty of dibbs, blunt, and
stumpy, sir;--good morning, sir, good morning,--
we must mind business,-excuse ceremony, sir,
-good morning:"
So saying, he literally thrust the astonished
Barnard out of the office by the shoulder, while
Creed and Smith followed, nearly suffocated by
the attempt to suppress their laughter.
"These are strange people," said Barnard,
when he got into the street.
"Yes," said Creed, " odd fishes; but it's the
way with mercantile people, not much cere-
mony: but they are as rich as Crsus. Did

you see all the money bags, and the gold piled
on the desk ?"
"Yes," said Barnard ; "they must be worth a
deal of money."
" Half a million, at the least," replied Creed,
As our readers are not very likely to divine who
these wealthy merchants were, we may as well
inform them : in a few words, the firm of Xiuto-
totle and Killganders was no less than a regular
swindling establishment, supported by Jackson
himself-a place of reference, and a pass to assist
his smuggling transactions. Don Josiah was
personated by an old acquaintance of ours,-no
less a personage than the one-eyed gentleman
who had assisted in robbing Barnard at Robot-
tom's, and was now disguised with wig, spectacles,
and mustachios, and bad his complexion darkened
to a true Mexican hue. The other partner was
a Jew, who had returned from a transportation of
fourteen years;
and trusted to the alteration,
wrought by time, in his hair, his huge whiskers,
and general appearance, to escape recognition,
The "gold," piled on the desk, was nothing but
counters excellently gilt; and the "money" in
the bags was lead and tin.
Matters went on with Barnard, Hannah, and
Company, swimmingly for three weeks, when the
former's finances were approaching to a very low
ebb. Hannah had informed him that the first
division of prize-money which she had received
was nearly gone, but that she expected to receive

285
a turther supply in a few weeks. His own purse
was reduced to a very few pounds. He could
not, however, resolve to give up his present way
of life, nor could he by any means endure the
thoughts of separating from Hannah,--that,
under any circumstances, was totally out of the
question.
He was sitting one morning alone, ruminating
on his condition, and revolving various projects in
his mind, when Smith appeared. He came, as
Barnard thought, extremely -propos, that he
might ask his advice.
"Well, Bill," said Beauty, "how do you do
this morning? Why, man, you're looking cursedly
down in the mouth."
Jack," replied Barnard, "I'm very low spirited."
"Low spirited, man ?-pooh !what's the
matter?-a pound of sorrow never paid an ounce
of debt."
" You have hit it," said Barnard ; "I am in debt,
and cannot pay."
" And do you really think of paying ?" resumed
Smith; "I did not believe that you were quite
such a greenhorn.
What's the nature of
your
debt ?-is it a gaming business ?"
" No," said Barnard ; "I owe money to some
tradesmen."
What!" exclaimed Beauty, "you're uneasy
on that score, are you? You think of paying a
rascally tradesman ?-well,after that,I give you up.
Barnard, half ashamed, answered, "But what
can I do? I shall be arrested."
## p. 286 (#312) ############################################
286
TIE RED BARN.
"Nonsense," said Smith; you can remove
from where you are, and they cannot find you.
But," rejoined Barnard, "I have no money
either to remove or supply my occasions."
"O ho!" answered Beauty, " that's a horse of
another colour: but if you have no money, your
father has ;-apply to him."
"I dare not," said Barnard; "I have over-
drawn on him already. If I thought he would
stand further, I would have no objection to try
the old boy again."
" But he has plenty of cash, William. Now
hear me ;-I will give you my advice, but only
on one condition."
" What is that?" said Barnard.
" That you never prate about paying debts
again. D-n me! I was beginning to be a little
proud of you as a pupilI thought you were a
man of liberal notions ; but that idea of paying
debts was a desperate slap in the chops for your
humble servant."
"Well," replied Barnard,"
say no more about
it. Your advice-how shall I raise the wind ?"
Thus," resumed Smith; "write to your father;
-tell him of the wealth of Jackson, and that
copper-faced Don with the jaw-breaking name.
Tell him that they have offered you the best
price for cattle to export :-he'll send you up a
drove of oxen, and the devil's in it if we cannot
manage to raise the wind then. But you must
write very plausibly,just like a good steady son,
as you are.
## p. 287 (#313) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
287
Humph !" said Barnard, pausing ; "but what
shall I do when he asks for the money?"
"Leave that to time ; you'll win ten times the
sum that the cattle will fetch, and thus make all
square. All you want to enable you to win, is a
good sum to start with."
" l'n afraid it won't do, Jack," sighed Barnard;
" have you no other advice to offer ?"
"Yes,go home-quit the joys of London-
leave Hannah, and go bog-trot, and drink ale for
the rest of your days in the country."
"Not I, Jack," said Barnard, ringing the bell;
"bring me pen, ink, and paper (to the servant);
I will write instantly."
He sat down and wrote to his father, after
Smith's dictation,that he was getting on re-
markably well; vaunted in high terms the in-
mense wealth of Jackson and Xiutototle; boasted
of the admirable connexion to be made through
them; and finished by stating the high prices they
were disposed to give in ready cash for cattle for
immediate exportation, and requesting his father
to send up several head immediately. He con-
cluded his epistle by a moral comment on the
vice and folly which he was of necessity obliged to
witness in London; grieving that he could not,
conveniently with his father's interest, return to
Polstead instantly; and hoping that when he
did return, he should never be again called upon
to quit, for a single night, his happy home, and
a father whoin he so respected and loved !
## p. 288 (#314) ############################################
288
THE KED BARX.
In the course of four or five days the cattle
arrived in London,the representations made by
Barnard of the wealth of the high contracting
powers, having wrought upon the weak and
credulous mind of the old man. Beauty and
Barnard very speedily disposed of them in Smith-
field market, and they brought exactly 320 to the
latter.
The sight of this money aroused the cupidity
of Smith, who determined on having a share of it.
He was annoyed by the idea that Hannah should
have the entire plucking of the pigeon, and was
resolved, at all events, to pick up some of the
feathers. The mode which struck him at the
present time, as most promising of success, was
to seduce Barnard that evening to a gaming table,
where he might himself have a good opportunity
of borrowing a considerable portion of the money.
For this purpose he invited Barnard to dine at
a tavern on the day of sale. He made the hour
of dinner very late, filling up the interval from the
time in which the cattle was sold, by taking him
about from place to place, but always at a con-
siderable distance from his home. They took
sundry pints of ale, &c. with the purchasers of
the cattle, which though they had not the effect
of intoxicating, yet served a little to confuse
the head of Barnard, and render him indisposed
to return home to dinner.
They proceeded to the neighbourhood of Covent
Garden, where they dined and drank pretty freeiy

of wine. In the course of the second bottle. Smith
said to Barnard
" William, how do you mean, now, to manage
wit's this money you have received to-day?"
"Why," said Barnard, who was getting a little
primed with the wine, "spend it like a man, to
be sure, and enjoy myself with my friends."
That is all very well," replied Smith, "and
quite right; but a man should look beyond the
present enjoyment. What will you do when the
money is out ?"
"Trust to Providence," said Barnard.
"Believe me," rejoined Smith, "the less you
trust to Providence the better: Projidence is a
slippery customer, and may chance to leave you
in the lurch. You must yourself provide for the
enjoyment of the future out of your present means.
* Trust the word of a man who knows the world
better than you dothe time for making money is
when you have money : cash begets cash, if the
right way be taken."
" Then what do you advise me to do ?" said
Barnard.
" Try your fortune to-night at rouge et noir, 
I'm sure you'll win."
" But if I should lose ?" said Barnard.
"I have got a system," said Smith, " by which
you cannot lose; besides, don't risk all your
money--hazard only 150. Give me 50 out of
this to play for you, and try 100 yourself,we
cannot both lose. You, I have no doubt, will

win sufficient to enable you to get over all voir
embarrassments, reimburse your father, and enje y
yourself for some time to come. You must do
something to keep yourself constantly afloat, if
you do not mean to return to a dull country life,
and give up every pleasure."
Well, then," replied Barnard, "I will try my
luck to-night :-here's fifty, Jack, for you."
" That's right, my boy; and here's success to
us!"
They finished their wine, and repaired to a
house well known in the West End. This was
the first time that Barnard had ever been in a
regular gaming house ; for hitherto it had been
the policy of his associates to keep him out of
such places, that they might reserve all the
plunder to themselves. Under the passport of
Smith, he easily entered ; and on going up stairs,
he was perfectly astounded with the splendour of
the establishment. The lights, the furniture, the
sideboard spread with cold viands and expensive
wines, surprised him not a little. He observed
around the table many of the faces he had formerly
seen in the billiard-rooms which we have de-
scribed; and in addition to these, many others
whose countenances were expressive of anything
but benevolence and contentment.
The company frequenting all places of this
kind consists of three distinct classes ;-those
who fleece, those who are in a course of being
fleeced, and those who are completely fleeced
## p. 291 (#317) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
291
The first are the old, knowing, cautious players,
wno have long made a regular trade of the game,
and who have no other means of subsistence :
such men may be known at a glance. There are
not many of them young, yet their features are
furrowed more by sordid care than the natural
operation of time. In vain you look into their
countenances for any traces of human feeling :
you find nothing there but the cunning of the
fox, or the ferocity of the tiger. They have long
been accustomed to contemplate with apathy the
ruin of the young, the noble, the ingenuous, and
the brave. Sordid avarice has long eradicated
from their hearts every principle of honour, and
every sentiment of humanity.
The second class is constituted of those young
men who are better provided with money than
wit. Many of these have been originally led by
accident into gaming, and encouraged to proceed
by the fatal fascination of early success; others
have entered into it voluntarily, from the absurd
notion of its practice being necessary to the cha-
racter of a man of fashion ; but the great majo-
rity consists of such as are flattered into the pre-
posterous hope of realizing a fortune by the
pursuit.
The third class is filled up from the second.
When these ur fortunate young men have lost all
their money, and are completely ruined, such is
the effect of habit that they cannot quit the scene
of their destruction. There you may see them,

night after night, overlooking the players, and
when they can borrow a counter, trying their
fortune, and invariably losing. Their appearance
indicates their situation ; their clothes are seedy-
their looks announce a dejected and broken spirit.
Many of them have nothing to eat or drink, but
what, by the liberality of the keeper of the esta-
blishment, is gratuitously supplied to his customers.
From this class some migrate into the first :
others are made useful about the establishment
itself, as decoy ducks, &c. Many are reduced
to the lowest infamy and degradation, destined
eventually to swell the population of our prisons,
to figure on the scaffold, or to wander on the
shores of Australasia.
But it is superfluous for us to dwell any longer
on a subject which has been so often and so ably
handled. Still it must be granted, that every
effort, however humble, to assist in the extinction
of these nurseries of ruin, and hot-beds of vice, is
not only meritorious but necessary.
Barnard and Smith now commenced to play.
The latter was unsuccessful, soon losing the
fifty pounds given him by Barnard, and borrow-
ing fifty more with which he had no better suc-
cess. Very different was the fortune of Barnard.
He had never played at rouge et noir before, and
had not the least idea of the game. He was merely
told by Smith to place his money upon which.

young players, while Smith was losing the hundred
pounds, he won no less than 1800.
Smith was astonished and nettled at the suc-
cess of Barnard: he was vexed to think that the
latter should have won, while he himself had lost.
Though an old and knowing player, Beauty could
not adopt, in the present instance, any of the
means by which he usually contrived to secure
the good graces of fortune. He resolved, how-
ever, that he should be no loser by the success
of Barnard.
By his advice, the latter left off play when he
had won the sum above-mentioned. They went
out together, and Smith dissuaded Barnard, by
all means, from his intention of going home.
It was very dangerous, he told him, to go such
a distance, at that hour, with such a sum of
money about him,-he had better stop at his
(Smith's) lodgings in the Strand until morning,
where there was a spare bed for him.
Barnard consented, and the following morning,
at breakfast, his Mentor thus addressed him :-
"Well, my dear fellow, you have been un-
commonly lucky last night;-I told
you
that
you
would win. I think I am entitled to your thanks
for bringing you to that place."
"You are entitled to much more than these,
Jack," rejoined Barnard ; "and if two or three
hundred are of any use to you, they are at your
service."
## p. 294 (#320) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
" I thank you," said Smith, "but I will not
touch a penny: I do not want money at present:
but allow me to ask you how you mean to manage
with the sum you have won ?"
Why," replied Barnard, "I shall clear off all
my embarrassments, reimburse my father, and
enjoy the rest."
" If you will take the advice of one older than
yourself, and who knows life much better, you
will do no such thing."
" Why not?"
" Because you have now a glorious opportunity
of making a splendid fortune-an opportunity
that may never occur again. Your debtors and
your father can wait awhile,there is no hurry
about them: but if you want to make a good hit,
you must keep your money, for the present, in a
lump."
And how shall I turn it to account ?" said
Barnard.
" There are many ways of laying out money to
advantage in London; but it requires some con-
sideration to choose: meanwhile, you should have
your money secured."
" Secured!" cried Barnard," how do you
mean?"
"I mean," said Smith,  that you should have
it deposited in safe hands ;-you cannot be so
weak as to think of carrying such a sum about
with you. Why, man, there are a thousand ways

" do
in which you may lose it; or even,
if
you
don't
iose it, you may waste and fritter it down to
nothing."
" Then what do you advise me to do, Smith ?"
responded he.
"I advise you to lodge the inoney
in
proper
hands."
" In the Bank ?" said Barnard.
"Fudge and nonsense !" cried Beauty;
you want to lose your money? I tell you no bank
is safe, not even the Bank of England - to say
nothing of the trouble you will have in drawing
your money when you want it."
" What can I do, then ?" said Barnard.
"Take my advice,-keep one hundred pounds
for your occasions; lodge the rest in the hands of
some wealthy merchant, who will pay you a fair
interest for the time he holds it. Thus it will be
safe from accidents of all kinds, as well as from
your own nibbling fingers; and you will have it
in a lump, when an opportunity offers of turning
it to profit."
"Who do you recommend should have the care
of it ?" said Barnard.
"For my own part," said Smith, "I have no
very great acquaintance in the City; but, from all
I know, I think you could not entrust it to better
hands than those of Xiutototle and Killganders."
Barnard still appeared to hesitate; and, after a
pause, repied"I think I had better get rid of
my embarrassments first ;-yes,
I will do so."

Well, do as you like," observed Smith; "it.
is no business of mine"
We may as well inform the reader, that getting
rid of his embarrassments was the very thing of
which Barnard had not the remotest intention.
He was anything in the world but a man of
natural rectitude, though timidity might induce
him, in some cases, to keep in the path of justice.
Nor was he averse from lodging the money through
distrust; but he was swayed by a weak and boyish
feeling of exhibiting his winnings to Hannah, and
pouring the treasure into her lap. This was what
Smith feared ;-he had too much discrimination
not to perceive that principle had no hold on
Barnard : but he was dreadfully afraid of the in-
fluence of Hannah. He resumed the conver-
sation.
"All I want you to do, William, is to secure
your money ; you can draw it out any time at a
moment's warning, for whatever purpose you
may want it: meantime it will be producing to
you a good interest."
At this moment a knock came at the street
door, and Captain Creed was shown in.
"Good morning, Captain," said Smith, "you
are come in good time ;-.your advice is greatly
wanting. Mr. Barnard has been so lucky as to
win 1800 last night, at rouge et noir."
"Indeed!" exclaimed Creed, "that was a
famous hit."
Yes," resumed Smith, "and I have been

advising him to lodge the money for security in the
hands of Xiutototle and Co.; he can draw it when
he likes : they will pay good interest, and he will
have the money in a lump to lay out to advantage
when a favourable opportunity offers. I appeal
to you, Captain Creed, as a man of sense, and
a man of the world, whether my advice is not
right?"
" the very
"To be sure it is," replied Creed ;
best that could be given."
"You see there," said Smith to Barnard.
" But, Captain, he wants to get rid of two or
three hundred, in paying off what he calls em-
barrassments."
"That would be very wrong," rejoined the
Captain, very wrong indeed, Mr. Barnard
Take my word for it, there is a maxim concern-
ing money, which admits of no exception,-it
is this-never break bulk,that is, don't fritter
away a good sum when you have it, which may
be applied to some great and advantageous pur-
pose: besides, as to what you say about embar-
rassments-excuse me, but that is all nonsense
there is no embarrassment but want of money
Debt is nothing;if you have money, you
can live as well in the Rules' as anywhere else,
None but a fool ever troubles himself about his
debts."
"But," said Barnard, "if I pay off what I owe
now, I shall get credit again.

" Pray," rejoined Creed, very solemnly, "have
you been asked for the money ?"
"Yes," said Barnard, " more than once.
"Then, believe me," said the Captain, "you'll
get no more credit under any circumstances.
I know the London tradesmen better than you,
Mr. Barnard, if once they ask you for money,
,
your credit is dished. Payment can't recover
it, and therefore the best plan is never to pay
at all."
"I'll take my oath of that," said Beauty.
"But," resumed the Captain, "what you
have
to consider is your own interest: you have got a
sum of money, which may, with proper manage-
ment, prove the means of realizing a splendid
fortune. Your first step is to place it in a state
of security, and then you can look about you. I
am decidedly of Mr. Smith's opinion."
"I am sure," said Smith, " my dear Barnard, I
would not advise you to anything but for you own
good. It is needless for me to say that I have
no interest in the matter;-) advise you as I would
a brother."
I believe it well," said the Captain, slightly
contracting his forefinger, but unperceived by
Barnard.
"And do you not think," resumed Beauty,
Captain Creed, that Xiutototle and Killganders
are the proper men to lodge the money with ?"
"To be sure I do," replied Creed ; " the best

men in London : their word is good for three
hundred thousand pounds, at any time; and
they are excellent fellows, with all their oddities.
Killganders is the most honourable man I ever
knew, and the most liberal : he has lost immense
sums by his liberalitybut he did not mind it
trifles to him."
"He is a very charitable man, too," said Smith;
is he not, Captain?"
"Oh yes ! very charatible indeed ;-he is a
large contributor to the Foundling Hospital."
"Indeed!" said Smith ; " what a worthy inan!
The fact is, Barnard, you cannot do better than
entrust your money in such wealthy and
honourable hands.'
"So say I, Mr. Barnard," said Creed ; "safe
bind, safe find, as the old proverb has it. You
will be always sure of a good account of your
cash, from Xiutototle and Killganders.'
In short, without dwelling on details, it is
sufficient to inform the reader, that these two
gentlemen finally succeeded in talking Barnard
into the measure proposed by Smith. When he
gave his assent, Beauty exclaimed-
"Now, then, let us go right smack to business :
when a man has made a good resolution, the
next best thing he can do, is to act immediately
upon it. Will you come with us, Captain, to the
City ?"
" With all my heart," said Creed ;and away
they hauled Barnard to Lombard Street.

When they arrived at "Three Kings Court,"
they found the two ill-conditioned clerks in the
outer office, writing away like wildfire. Inquiring
vor the partners, they were told that Mr. Kill-
ganders was alone in the inner office. They
entered, and found the man of commerce seated
at the lofty desk deeply engaged in thought, with
dis head imbedded in his hands, and poring over
a huge ledger. The scene that followed must be
reduced to a dramatic form, to render it perfectly
intelligible to our readers.
Barnard."I have come, sir, for the pur-
pose-

Barnard--(losing patience).-"I have come,
sir, I say, to give you seventeen hundred pounds."
Killganders(starting up).-" Lord, sir, I beg
your pardon,-gentlemen, I beg your pardon.

I'm quite stupid with business. Sir, what inay
you please to want?"
" This gentleman, Mr. Killganders," said
Captain Creed, "is desirous of lodging in your
hands the sum of 1700, being convinced of the
stability and liberality of your house."
"Sir," said Killganders, " he does us honour;
and he will, I trust, find his confidence not
misplacedbut we must wait for my partner.
Eugene !" (roaring out to one of the clerks out-
side, who entered), "when did the Don go out ?"
" Von heure, saar, exact."
" Did he take the phaton ?"
" No, saar; he did but walk to de store, to see
de ten tousan cask of rum put in.'
" Sit down gentlemen, sit down-he'll be here
directly."
Scarcely had'he spoken, when the unutterable
Xiutototle entered.
"Don Josiah," said Killganders, "I am glad
you are come; this gentleman comes to lodge
with us
" To lodge wid us! hah! hah !-we have not
de lodging !"
"He comes to give us money, Don Josiah !"
"Money! hah! hah! ver goodwe take best
care of money ;keep his money fast." .
"No doubt," said Killganders; " we will take
all possible care of the gentleman's money. I
wished you to be present when the tender was
made."
## p. 302 (#328) ############################################
302
THE RED BARN,
" Tender! oh, si! we sall be very tender."
" Have you the money about you, Mr. Bar-
nard ?" said Killganders.
"Yes, sir," replied Smith; "Mr. Barnard has
the money quite ready.".
"Then I will write an acknowledgment," said
the merchant.
While he was thus employed, a lad about four-
teen or fifteen years of age, very badly dressed,
and looking very pale, entered the office. As
soon as Xiutototle beheld him he intonated forth
"Vat you vant, juvenal vello?
Charity, your honour," said the boy..
"Sharitee! sharitee bee dam, Eugene! push
out dis here ladronvat for you let im in ?"
Killganders on this raised his head; and with
more pompous enunciation than usual, said-
"Retire boy, I never give to beggars- I sub-
scribe to de medicity.No charity to give to
beggars; begone, I say, boy."
He now handed a paper to Barnard, who then
reckoned down the sum of 1700, which the
worthy merchant immediately deposited in his
desk.
Depend upon it, sir, we shall take care of this
money for you," resumed he; "we dare not give
you more than the legal interest: but sir, when
you come to draw your money, there's such a
thing as a bonus, sir-I say nothing, sir-time
will tell you shan't find us illiberal, sir. When
you come to draw your money, depend upon it,

303
sir, you'll be very much surprised--won't he, Don
Josiah ?"
Aye, aye; dat he vilver mush soorpreeze
indeed."
Killgander now bowed the gentlemen out of
the office with much bustle and vociferation,
repeating his assurance to Barnard of the great
care with which his money would be treated, and
the surprise that awaited him when he should
come to draw it.
"What an excellent man, this Killganders !"
said Smith.
"A most humane character !" ejaculated Creed.
He has travelled ?" resumed Smith.
"Yes !" said Creed, " from motives of the
purest philanthropy-for the good of his country
and mankind."
Barnard now returned home to Hannah. She
had been very uneasy in consequence of his
absence, and very much annoyed---not in conse-
quence of any feeling for his safety, but fearful
(as was really the fact) that he had been led into
the disposal of the money arising from the sale
of the cattle, in a manner prejudicial to her
interests. When he returned, she questioned him
eagerly as to where he had been, and what he
had been about. He detailed to her all that
had occurred, even to the minutest circumstance,
since they had last parted.
Her indignation at this recital was extreme,
and it was with difficulty she avoided the manifes

tation of it. She even had some thoughts of
disclosing the true character of Smith and Jack.
son to Barnard, and developing the prime
humbug of Xiutototle; but she reflected that, by
80 doing, she would be betraying herself, and
injuring her own interests: she therefore kept
silence on that subject, contenting herself with
remarking that Barnard had been somewhat quick
in his measures, and hoping that all was safe.
He excused his precipitation by the urgent
instances of Smith, and expressed his full con-
viction of the security of the deposit.
Barnard was rather fatigued after his walking
and more especially as he had had but little sleep
during the last four-and-twenty hours : he there-
fore laid himself down for a couple of hours; and
while he was enjoying his repose, his fair partner
took a coach and drove off directly to Smith's
lodgings.
Being informed that he was within, she hurried
up stairs without further ceremony, and found
Beauty and our noble Captain enjoying them-
selves over some sandwiches and a bottle of
sherry.
" Well," said she, "Mr. Smith, this is very
pretty conduct of you!"
"What conduct, Madam ?" said Smith, with
an affectation of surprise.
Why, to urge Barnard to part with his money
in the manner he has done without consulting me.
"Surely, better advice could not be given to

money in a place of safety ?"
"And so the money," said Hannah, "is in the
hands of that one-eyed rascal ?"
I don't know whom you mean by the one-eyed
rascal," said Smith; "it is in the hands of that
most respectable merchant, Don Josiah Xiuto-
totle."
"I am determined, Mr. Smith, that I will not
bear this."
"What!" cried Smith, " you think the money
is not safe :-I assure you it's as safe as a church."
Why," said Creed, "my dear lady, what
better security could you desire, than the ancient
firm of Xiutototle and Killganders ?"
" Besides," added Smith, "you know Barnard
has got an acknowledgment for the money."
Upon which," said the Captain," he can sue
them in any court of law."
He may proceed by common action for debt;
or by indictment, in case of extremity," cried
Smith.
Yes," said Creed; " and call us as witnesses."

Smith and Creed,-using epithets with which we
do not think proper to disfigure our pages. Beauty
allowed her to proceed without interruption ; and
when she had finished, replied, with the utmost
sang froid,"Where's the use of putting yourself
into this violent passion ? I assure you, upon my
honour, that the money is quite safe."
" If you do not believe us," said the Captain,
you can ask Killganders himself, or the Don
with the hard name."
"This is all mighty fine, gentlemen," cried
Hannah ; " but I will contrive to mar your mirth.
I'll have my revenge, depend upon it ;-I'll blow

" And yourself along with us," said Beauty,
quietly.
"No matter !I'll have my revenge.
"Why, hear me, Mrs. Woods," said the
Captain ; "what amazing folly this is ! Revenge!

"Well, but," said Hannah, in a much calmer
tone, " you
you should not have been so precipitate-

should have consulted me, and made me a
party to the affair :-I felt hurt that you did not."
"There was no time to be lost," answered
Smith; "if I had not acted as I have done,
Barnard would have paid his debts, and returned
to the country.
He expressed his full fixed
determination to do so; and I appeal to Creed,
whether we had not the utmost difficulty to
dissuade him from this, and to induce him to
remain."
"There is no doubt of it," said Creed: "he
even talked of leaving to-morrow.'
" What !" said Hannah; "and would he have

"I will weave a triple net around him, which

"Right !" said Smith ; "and our aid shall not

Thus this affair was settled; and the worthy

of sherry together and parted.

SAKPROD.
On the morning which succeeded the night of
Maria's abduction, her parents rose as usual with
the break of day to their respective labours,the
father to the field, the mother to her household
duties. Maria, being an only and much indulged
child, was not habituated to leave her bed for an
hour or two later. The father, on going out, had
observed that the door was not bolted inside; but
as, of course, he had not the slighest suspicion of
the truth, he took no particular notice of this
fact, but attributed it to casual neglect.
Maria's ordinary time of rising was now past,
and, to her mother's surprise, she did not make
her appearance. The latter, however, thought
she might either have slept badly in the early
part of the night, or that head-ach, or some

other such cause, might now detain her in bed.
But when eight o'clock arrived, the old woman
began to get alarmed: she went to Maria's
chamber; and her alarm was not diminished by
finding the door half open, as the girl was
generally in the habit of locking it inside. She
entered, drew back the curtains of the bed, and
found that it was not oniy enpty now, but had
evidently not been tenanted at ail the night before!
To describe the sensations of a mother, on such
an occasion, would be no easy task. Maria was
gone! but how?but when ?-but where? Of
these questions, the second was the only one to
which any answer could be given by her parent
Her daughter had retired apparently to rest at her
usual time, and, therefore, must have gone out in
the middle of the night. That was no time for
visiting her cousin, or any of her female ac-
quaintance in the village:she must have eloped
with some man.
Was it with Harry Everton ?-Impossible !
Harry, the mother knew, had long quitted the
neighbourhood, though she knew not what had
become of him: besides, she knew him to be
incapable of seducing away her daughter ;-he
had no occasion to do so. He might have had
her, with the full consent of her parents, if she
were herself so inclined: but she also knew that
Maria was not so inclined ; that she had a dislike
rather than an attachment to him :-it could not,
therefore, be Harry Everton.
## p. 311 (#337) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
311
Her thonghts then reverted to William Barnard.
She was not ignorant that her daughter had
given some encouragement to this young man.
She herself, as well as old Marten, had no very
high opinion of his charucter: she thought him
very capable of a bad action : but, for some time,
she had heard or seen nothing of him ;she did
not know whether he was in the country or not.
Besides, why should they run away? If marriage
were the object, it might have been brought about
easily without that, if Barnard (as Maria had once
told her) was quite reformed. The match was a
good one, and old Marten might have readily
been induced to give his consent ;but, perhaps,
marriage was not Barnard's object :-she knew
not what to think ; still her suspicions inclined
to rest on him.
The father now returned to breakfast.
"Oh, Jack !" said old Mrs. Marten,
.."
"Gone !" cried the father ; " gone where ?"
"I don't know, I am sure, my dear," replied
she; "her bed is empty, and she has not lain in
it last night."And then she told him all.
The father's astonishment, confusion, perplexity,
and grief, were equal to the mother's. He, how-
ever, indulged a hope that Maria might return
in the course of the day, and all might be ex-
plained: meanwhile, he desired the mother to go
and make inquiries in the village.
When Marten returned to dinner, he questioned
our

his wife on her success. She told him, that of
Maria she could learn nothing. She had not
been amongst any of her friends. But she did
find out that three strange gentlemen had been
stopping at the " Cock,"that one had departed
the night before in a post-chaise, and that the
two others had gone off this morning, and young
Barnard with them. But Maria had not been
seen with either of the parties.
The father did not know what to think ;-Maria
might have been with them, though she had not
been seen :-all was doubt and darkness.
The evening of that day passed, and night
came on; but no Maria appeared. The old couple
sat desolately down to supper.
She who used
to busy herself in getting all ready, sit by her
father, read and sing to him, embrace her parents
before retiring to rest, and beg their blessing,
was not there.
The old couple looked at each
other, words were not necessary to express
their feelings, nor could they give them language.
The mother cried aloud the father buried his
face in his hands, and groaned deeply.
Even in their broken slumbers the painful
thought of their loss pursued them, and the
mother's dreams were frightfully vivid. She
thought she saw her daughter sitting, as usual in
fine weather, at the door, busy with her needle;-
suddenly four men appeared, who, in spite of her
resistance, carried her off hy violence. After
this, she saw her dragged forcibly into a cottage,

THE RED BARN.
313
and the door violently closed. But, strange to
relate, the prominent figure in the dream was
young Barnard. This, indeed, might be accounted
for by her previous suspicions of him.
In fact, there was nothing in this dream particu-
larly remarkable, or which might not easily be
accounted for under the circumstances. But it,
nevertheless, made a deep impression on the
mind of the old woman. She told it to her hus-
band in the morning, and expressed her full con-
viction that Maria had been taken away by force,
and that Barnard was the chief agent in the
business.
That day too elapsed, and the next, and the
next, but no tidings of Maria came;the mother
abandoned herself to the bitterest grief, and the
father was plunged in the deepest melancholy
Everything about them served to remind them
of their lost child. In one corner lay her work,
in another her books. Her singing-birds (for
she had two or three in cages) were
neglected. The kitten received not its milk from
her hand as usual, nor the house-dog his accus-
tomed encouragement from her tongue. The little
shrubs, that she used daily to water, were begin-
ning to wither for want of her care. All, in short,
served to heighten the pangs which her parents
suffered, and to increase their despair.
There was a difference, however, between the
grief of the father and the mother. That of the
latter was open and querulous : but Marten felt
now

like a man;-his eyes, it is true, refused to weep,
but his heart was deeply lacerated. He doated
on his daughterto her he looked as the only
comfort and consolation of his declining years.
To see her happily married, was the first wish of
his heart; and for her welfare he had cheerfully
supported a life of constant labour, and abstained
from all those little indulgences that men of his
age and class in life are usually in the habit of
taking He seldom drank, even in the most
moderate degree, and never joined the society of
his equals at any of their places of meeting.
All his happiness was centered in his humble
home, and his only, lovely child. - The feelings
of such a man may be better conceived than
expressed.
A week had passed in this way, and the old
and miserable couple were sitting one night, in
gloomy silence, over the embers of a declining
fire. The mother first broke this silence by
saying-
"She is gone, Jack-gone for ever. My poor
Maria!--she must certainly be dead: she would
never leave us this way, without letting us hear
from her, if she were alive."
" Mary," said old Marten, " do not talk about
it. I thought to have died quietly and happily
in her arms and yours. I now feel I must go
soon, and very differentlymy heart is broken."
Scarcely had he uttered the last sentence, when
the rattiing of wheels was heard upon the road

without, at a little distance.
The old couple
started, and listened attentively. They both
thought within themselves, without expressing it
" if this should be Maria !"
The vehicle, whatever it might be, was now ap-
proaching the house, for the sound grew clearer.
At length it made a sudden stop, and was pulled
up evidently at the gate of the cottage.
Voices were then heard, but the words were
not distinguishable. Immediately came a loud
knocking at the door ; it was opened by Mrs
Marten, and her daughter flew into her arms!
" Poor thingtake care of her !" cried old
Carribles, who was close behind. " Here she is
back for you, safe and sound. We've got her
now into harbour, clear of pirates, rocks, and
quicksands."
The old father now rushed out, and in a trans-
port of joy embraced his daughter. "Oh, Maria !"
said he, " I have you once again.
The old man could utter no more. The sudden
revulsion of feeling was too much for his aged
frame, and he sunk exhausted into a chair !
Carribles at once drew from his pocket his
travelling flask of brandy, and having applied
some of its contents to the lips of old Marten, he
soon recovered.
"Oh, Maria !" said her good mother, " ' you
have made your father and me so miserable
How cou!d you go off in such a manner ?"
Doar mother," said Maria, "I was taken

away by force, and, but for this good gentleman,
I should not be here now: you have to thank
him for my safety."
"No thanks!" cried Carribles; "I have only
done the duty of an honest tar,-rescued the
weak and innocent out of the grasp of the strong
and the wicked."
" Tell us, my dear child, how this happened,"
said Mrs. Marten.
Maria, with some hesitation, began her story,
and told the whole substance of what had passed
between her and Jackson, from the beginning of
their acquaintance-with the suppressior, however,
of some circumstances. She mentioned how she
had met her lover at the fair, of their subsequent
communication, of her opposition to his proposals
of elopement, and, finally, of her forcible ab-
duction, and rescue by Carribles. She thought
proper, however, to say nothing of the fortune-
teller; nor did she allude to the share which
Harry Everton had taken in her delivery, as she
knew that that would be painful to her parents.
She concluded with telling them that she
should have returned the next morning after her
departure, but that she had been taken extremely
ill; and expressed, in the strongest language, her
gratitude for the kind attentions of Captain
Carribles and his housekeeper.

have kept this acquaintance so secret from your

"I know it, my dear mother," replied Maria 
"I know I was very wrong ;-I will never act so
again: I was very very wrong."
"We forgive you, my child," simultaneously
ejaculated both parents, and strained her alter-
nately in their arms.
The veteran tar was much affected by this
scene: he was thanked in the warmest terms by
the father. Carribles seized his hand, and said,
"No thanks, my dear friend :this is a great
pleasure to me, I assure you : to see honest folks
happy is my delight. But it is not to me
alone -
Here a look of entreaty from Maria made him
pause :she knew he was about to mention
Harry, and she had before requested him not to
do so before her parents.
Carribles took the hint, and resumed
"But, young lady, I think you mentioned the
name of the Corsair who was carrying you off :
what do you call him ?"
" Jackson, sir, is the gentleman's name."
"Jackson-Jackson," cried Carribles; "I should
know that name. What was his other name, do
you know ?"
"Stafford, sir," said Maria; "Stafford Jackson."
" Stafford Jackson!" exclaimed Carribles, at
the top of his voice; "why, shiver my timbers,
but I know the man well : how is he built?"
"Built, sir ?" said Maria.
Aye, girl ; I mean what sort of a man is he?"

THE RED BARN,
"A tall, handsome young man, with dark
brown hair," replied Maria, blushing.
"I know him," said Carribles, " well; the
son of a late respected friend of mine; a brave and
gallant youth, but as wild as the devil : still, I did
not think he would force away a young girl from
her parents. A sailor, too, the rascal has been."
"I believe he meant honourably," said Maria;
" but he wished to be concealed, in consequence
of having fought a duel."
" Just like him," said Carribles ; "he was the
most desperate boy I ever knew, and has all his
life been in one scrape or other, I believe :--but
do you take care. If he mean honourably, he
will ask
you
from
your worthy father here; and
I do not think he would make a bad husband, for
he is a good-hearted fellow, in the main ; but
don't
you listen to him on any other terms."
Mrs. Marten was proceeding to lay on the table
all the refreshment the cottage could afford, when
Carribles interposed, and prevented her hospitable
exertions.
" No," said he; "no refreshments for me-I
must steer home. We should have been here
sooner, but for my grey mare: she could not
mend her pace, if Old Nick was astern of her."
" But, sir," said old Marten," we will make up
a bed for you here to-night, and take care of
your horse ;-there is an out-house where he can
be put, and I will get some hay: it is late for
you, sir, disabled as you are, to go home now."
## p. 319 (#345) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
"No, no, my friend," cried Carribles; " home
I must steer; and as for danger, d-n me, I have
a pair of bull-dogs that will guard me from the
land-pirates : besides, I am alonewhat signifies
my old hulk now? It has been well battered for
five-and-forty years, and will be soon no longer
sea-worthy: d-n them, what can they get of
a cat but its skin?"
Further pressing was of no use: the old boy
would be off, in spite of wind and weather, and every
other obstacle. He shook the parents by the hand,
kissed Maria, told her to take care of herself and
have nothing to do with Jackson, unless he would
splice fairly, got under way, and proceeded
homewards at old Grizzle's usual rate of two
knots and a half an hour.
Maria was now, as she thought, fully resolved
to give up all further ideas of Jackson, unless he
should come openly forward and demand her of
her parents. In forming such a resolution, how-
ever, she reckoned without her host. Like a
great many others, she knew little of her own
character, and of the real nature of her own
feelings : it is much easier to make resolutions
contrary to our propensities and inclinations, than
to keep them. What seems facile enough in
theory, is difficult in practice; and Maria was
like the man of whom Voltaire writes, who rose
in the morning with a full determination to be a
perfect philosopher, considered nothing more easy
than the subjugation of all his passions, and ceded,

THE RED BARN.
in less than an hour, to the first temptation which
presented itself.
Jackson did not make his appearance; yet, in
spite of her resolutions, he was the only sub-
ject of her thoughts. Indignant as she had
been at his violence, (or rather at the violent
measure which he sanctioned, for he had com-
mitted no personal violence himself), the sopbistry
of her love now began to make excuses for it-it
was the strength of his passion--the violence of his
attachment for herself, that induced him to act
as he did she herself was the cause of itand
this idea at once flattered her vanity and excited
her regret. She was now very sorry for her own
obstinacy (for in such a light did her former firm-
ness appear to her mind at present), and she was
much afraid that she had now lost him for ever.
The observations thrown out about him by
Carribles, had no tendency to counteract these
feelings; for, on the whole, they were favourable
rather than otherwise. The worst the Captain
could say of him was, that he was wild ; and
there is no woman who does not think herself
capable of taming any man, when she is once
married to him. This opinion, too, I believe to be
correct in most cases,your marriage is a sore
decayer of your young men's wildness.
The general solitude in which - Maria lived at
present, tended much to nourish and support this
particular train of reflection; and the only society
of which she occasionally partook, served to cor-

roborate it still more :- the society which I mean,
was that of her cousin, Miss Ellen Mayberry.
We have been so extremely busy with the
principal personages of this history, that we have
not had time to look after this young lady and her
concerns: for this enforced neglect, we ask pardon,
and hasten to make atonement. The reader must
not suppose that while Jackson was laying siege
so vigorously to Maria, Beauty had been altogether
idle with regard to Ellen :--no such thing !--the
intervals of leisure, allowed him from the serious
occupation of tutoring Barnard, be devoted to the
relaxation of courtship: thus passing his time in
the manner most suitable to his amiable and phi-
lanthropic character-between the duties of friend-
ship and the enjoyments of love. lle and Ellen
had frequent clandestine meetings : what passed
at those meetings, it is not necessary for our
purposes fully to detail. Suffice it to say, that the
insinuating and tender elegance of Beauty's
conversation completed that conquest over the
fair one's heart, which his prepossessing physi-
ognomy had commenced. She was, indeed, a
girl of a very different character from Maria ;-
one by no means disposed to carry resistance in
love matters to any outrageous extremity, but
who would much sooner capitulate on reasonable
terms, than reduce the assailant to the dernier
resort of storming the citadel.
Ellen was very sorry for the departure of
Smith, who, however, consoled her with the

Her sur-
strongest assurances of his speedy return. When
lie heard of Maria's disappearance, she could
give a tolerably shrewd guess at the cause of it;
but, with the true secrecy of a woman, when her
own interests are likely to be compromised (the
only time when a woman observes secrecy), she
remained as silent as the grave.
After she had heard of Maria's disappearance,
she was in daily expectation of hearing from her,
that she was happily settled, &c. &c.
prise was great, after the lapse of a week, to see
Maria herself; and her surprise was still greater,
when the latter detailed to her every particular of
the transaction : this surprise, however, was
equalled by her disapprobation of Maria's co-
duct; and her comments were not calculated
cither to render her cousin satisfied with the
present, or guarded for the future.
" Well, Maria," she would say, "I am sure you
are a very odd sort of girl ; you love this gentle-
man, you confess, and yet you won't have him :
you actually forced him, by your foolish, stupid
obstinacy, to run away with you--and then your
nonsense in calling out on the road to two
strangers ;-I am sure I should not call out, if I
was in the carriage with such a dashing fellow.
I wish, with all my heart, that somebody would
run away with me."
That I believe," said Maria ; "I could guess,
too, who that somebody is.
"Oh!" said Ellen, laughing, " I'm not ashamed

to own it, I like the young man very well inderd;
and when he wants me to go with him, he'll have
no occasion to use force. I won't die an old maid,
through any foolish scruples, like you."
" But what could I do, Ellen ?" said Maria.
" Do! why, go with the man quietly that you
love, and that loves you, and be happy."
" But my father and mother," said Maria.
"Oh, nonsense! don't you think you would
have made them much happier by coming back to
them well married, or by letting them know that
you were so, than by returning as you have done?
Besides, did you want the man to expose his
life for your whim, and for no use? It's my
opinion that you'll die an old maid after all;
William Barnard is off, and Harry Everton is off,
and now I am afraid Mr. Jackson is off too."
" You don't think so ?" said Maria.
I don't know, I'm sure," said she, "how he
will act; but I think, if I was half so badly
treated, I'd never come back."
" Then, perhaps, I shall never see him again,"
said Maria, with a sigh.
Why," said Ellen, " that may very well be;
for how doy ou know what's become of bin : you
know, from the old Captain's account, that he
was missed quite suddenly the night of the scuffle ;
--he may have been seriously hurt, for aught you
know, and may be dead by this time."
"My dear Ellen," said Maria, "don't
say that,
## p. 324 (#350) ############################################
324
THE RED BARN.
-I cannot bear it; if that were the case, I should
never be happy again."
"Well, my love," replied Ellen, "don't take
it so much to heart,-Mr. Smith has promised to
see me soon, and Mr. Jackson may return to you
also : but, if he does come, I advise you to treat
him better than you did before."
Such conversations, while they militated strongly
against the resolutions of Maria, were but too
much in accordance with her inclinations : they
served to foster her love, to increase her regret
for her firm and virtuous conduct, to make her
wish for the return of her lover, and to prepare
her to cede with greater facility to a renewal of
his propositions: they also had a tendency to
undermine the strictness of her principles, and to
olunt the keenness of the moral sense within her.
Nothing is more dangerous to the youth of either
sex, than a companion, the levity of whose
temper, or the strength of whose passions, dis-
poses them to cast away the restraint of rectitude.
Syni pathetic feeling is soon engendered; and
such is the infirmity of nature, that the con-
tagion of loose principles is propagated with far
more facility than the love of virtue. The virtuous
are more easily corrupted by the society of the
vicious, than the latter are benefited by the
example of the former.
About five or six days after her return, Maria
was walking in the dusk of the evening, in a
## p. 325 (#351) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
325
retired place, at no great distance from the
cottage. Her thoughts were in the train we have
been describing: she was regretting the harshness
with which she had treated Jackson; fearing, at
one time, that she had lost him for ever; in-
dulging, at another, an undefined hope of his
return; and again, with the inconsistency so
natural to woman, trembling at the bare imagina-
tion of seeing him. She commenced to think
aloud,
"I am afraid be is gone for evermy conduct
must have offended him much. Oh! if I coull
see him again!"
"Behold him here!" said a voice behind her;
" the ill-treated, but still constant Stafford."
She turned round, beheld her lover, and fell
into his arms.
Jackson had come prepared to make an eloquent
defence of his own conduct; but what he had
overheard suddenly determined him to change his
mode of operation. Instead of defending him-
self, he turned the tables on Maria, and com-
menced to reproach her with hardheartedness and
cruelty.
"Maria," said he, " dearest Maria, you have
made me truly miserable. Would that I had
not recovered on the fatal night we were last
together !--would that the villain who struck me
senseless to the earth, had given a more effectual
blow! I should not have awaked to the torments
of disappointed love, and the horrors of despair"

326
THE RED BARN.
" What do you mean?" said Maria ; " you
were not hurt that night."
"All I remember," replied Jackson, "is having
been struck to the earth by some unknown hand,
while I was engaged with the villain at the horses'
heads. When I recovered, I found myself lying
by the side of the road, and the honest sailor,
who rode outside the carriage, was stretched still
senseless by my side: the chaise, the gig, you,
and our assailants, had all vanished. I was left
alone on a dreary road-a black and gloomy
morning, in a state of exceeding weakness from
loss of blood, with a helpless, senseless man for
my companion :---for this situation, Maria, I had
to thank your kindness. What a return for love
like mine!"
"Oh, Heavens !" ejaculated Maria ; ( what
have I done ?"
"If you regret it, Maria," resumed Jackson,
"I shall rejoice in what I have suffered ; and
were it ten times greater, I should think it but a
cheap purchase of your affection. I rose," pro-
ceeded he, "with some difficulty, and endeavoured
to recover my companion : I could not succeed
he had been very seriously injured indeed. I marked
the place, and proceeded slowly forward, I knew
not whither, in search of aid : fortunately, I was
soon overtaken by a man in a waggon-cart,-I
told him the case, and requested his assistance.
We returned to where my companion lay, hoisted
him into the cart, I entered myself, and we drove

to the next village. There we were fortunate
enough to procure some medical assistance, such as
it was : but the consequence of what I had gone
through was a high fever, which confined me to
my bed until within the last few days. I resolved,
however, to seek you as soon as my strength
would at all permit, to throw myself at your
feet, to ask forgiveness for the apparent violence
into which the strength of my love had led me,
and to hear my final doom from your own lovely
lips."
So saying, our hero suited the action to the
word, fell upon his knees, and again exclaimed
"Dearest Maria, how could you treat me with
such cruelty ?"
She replied, "I know not--I did not know
what I was doing : I did not know what you
meant to do."
"Oh, Maria! how could you doubt my truth,
my honour, my affection ?-what could I mean
but well? I feel that I could not live without
you; and I thought that the only means of
securing the possession of all that can render life
valuable to me, were those which I adopted.
God knows I have suffered enough for it, both in
mind and body. But I swear by the sacred
power of love, that I will not rise with life
from this position until you say that you forgive
me."
" Rise, then," cried Maria; "I do forgive you,
-rise."
## p. 328 (#354) ############################################
328
THE RED BARN.
" Not yet," said Jackson ; " you must promise
to be mine, or see me die at your feet."
"I do," said Maria, " I will never be another's."
"One promise more," added Jackson, "before
I rise: this our meeting must be a secret ; to
reveal it will be my sure destruction."
Maria, ater a pause, promised not to reveal it,
and Jackson rose.
They walked forward and continued their con-
versation. Jackson inquired into all the particu-
lars that occurred to her after their parting; and
she told him all. When she mentioned the
name of Carribles, and his mentioning his acquain-
tance with Jackson, the latter exclaimed,
"Good God! my honoured friend, Captain
Carribles!what an accident! I hope he received
no hurt:what a mistake!that man, then, at the
horses' heads was Squires, though I knew him
not from the darkness. But there was a third ;
who was he?"
"I know not," said Maria, while her con-
science reproached her for the untruth, and the
colour flew to her cheeks; but it was not perceived
by Jackson.
The latter then informed her that he himself was
living concealed in the neighbourhood, that he
would take immediate measures for their marriage,
which must be private; and again extorting
promise of secrecy from her, they parted, having
first made an appointment to meet again the
following day.

The spot where Jackson, for the present, lay
perdue, was no other than the cottage belonging to
Smith; under which was a subterraneous apart-
ment of very considerable extent, into which,
the smuggled goods lately brought from the coast
had been conveyed, and placed under the sur-
veillance of Ricketts. This cottage was situated in
the midst of a very romantic and hidden dell,
so much concealed that not many persons in the
neighbourhood were aware even of its existence.
It was remote from the road, surrounded on all
sides with shrubs and thick underwood, growing
in such profusion as to render all access to it
extremely difficult to any person not well ac-
quainted with the locality. There was, however,
one narrow path leading to it, which was not
readily discoverable to a stranger. It was even
very possible for a person to pass by the cottage
itself without notice. It lay in a hollow, backed
immediately by a small hill entirely overgrown
with furze and brushwood. It was built so verv
Jow, that the thatched roof, inclining from the hill,
seemed in front within a foot or two of the turf.
The small window was actually on a level with
the ground; and the door, which was at one side,
was invisible at first, being sunk below the surface,
and having a descent to it of a few rude and very
abrupt steps. Notwithstanding this, there was
considerable room inside, as the floor had been sunk
several feet below the level of the soil, and, nde-
pendently of the secret cavern, excavations had

been carried back to some extent in the body of
the hill,
No one in Polstead had the slightest idea of
the purposes to which this cabin was appropriated,
or that it was the property of Smith. He, indeed,
had left the neighbourhood so very young, that
on his return, which we have described, he was
not recognized by a human being. Few, in fact,
had ever known much of his family, which was
very obscure, and had left the place soon after
his original departure. The cabin was tenanted
by a miserable looking old woman, who pretended
to live by knitting stockings, &c. Her appear-
ance did not much invite communication, and the
common people around, who had ever seen her,
were not without their suspicions of her holding
an illicit intercourse with the prince of darkness.
Had they seen the gentleman who was her present
lodger, such suspicions might have received addi-
tional confirmation; for Tom Ricketts might
have well passed, if not for the "Most Low"
himself, at least for an accredited agent of the
court of Pandemonium.
With these amiable companions was Jackson
for the present domiciled. He did not, however,
bestow upon them any extra allowance of his
conversation. He had a very comfortable room,
snugly furnished, there was an abundance of
provisions, and, when he was not abroad, he con-
trived tolerably well to dissipate ennui, with the
assistance of burgundy, claret, and champagne,

331
most assuredly "neat as imported," and perfectly
unsullied by the intervention of the revenue code.
Not that Jackson was a disloyal subject, or bore
any personal antipathy to his most gracious
Majesty; but, like Nanty Ewart, he could not
afford to pay duty.
Jackson and Maria met next day according to
appointment. He commenced a long and round-
about tale of the measures he had taken for their
speedy marriage ;-how, when everything was
done, he would then present himself to her
parents ;-immediately after, they must leave the
country for his house in London. He told her
that he was in daily expectation of the duelling
affair being quite settled, as he had now got a clue
to the witnesses ; but in the mean time the most
profound secrecy was indispensably necessary to
his security.
He then expatiated with vast eloquence on the
unbounded happiness that awaited them. He
painted, in the most glowing colours, the warmth
and purity of his passion, boasted of his own
high sense of honour, and swore that he would
die ten thousand deaths, sooner than take the
slightest step that could compromise her welfare.
Nay, so transcendently sublimated was his affec-
tion, that he had rather renounce her possession
for ever (though that would be worse than death),
than expose her to the remotest chance of one
moment of uneasiness.
By these and such like discourses, he prevailed
## p. 332 (#358) ############################################
332
THE RED BARN.
over all her former resolutions. He got her to
agree to the private marriage, and to entire
secrecy. She who, a day or two before, was
fully determined to hold no communication with
him, unless he acted openly, and consulted her
parents, now completely gave in to all the clan-
destine measures he proposed. Her virtuous
firmness, her moral principles, her filial pietyall
gave way to the ardent and persuasive eloquence
of her seducervanished, like the dew of night,
before the rising beam of morning.
Such is woman ! The creature of present im-
pulses, varying like the camelion, and uncertain as
the idle wind !--of too soft materials to carry the
stern impress of principle, or preserve for a
moment undefaced the broad, distinctive charac-
ters of rectitude. You might as well write upon
the strand, which is washed by the restless
ocean, or on the watery plain itself, as attempt
to fix her wavering will, or determine her unsta-
ble conduct. She is caught, like the mackarel,
with some gaudy bait, and led by the ignis fatuus
of vanity into the swamps of destruction and
despair. Unhappy they, whose interest, whose
honour, whose happiness, are in her keeping; and
yet still more unhappy those, who have never
basked in the sunshine of her smiles, tasted the
nectar of her lip, or sighed within the Elysium of
her circling arms!
There was a poet whose name I know not, but
who is quoted in the illustrations of Martinus
## p. 333 (#359) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
333
By the
Scrihlerus, in the Essay on the " Art of Sinking,"
and who puts this very modest request to the
supernal powers-
" Ye Gods, annihilate both space and timo,
And make two lovers happy ?"
Now this prayer, absurd as it is, in the applica-
tion intended by the author, who speaks of two
absent lovers desirous of meeting, is often
realized to the minds of lovers who are together.
This was the case in the scene we have been
describing between Jackson and Maria.
latter at least, time flew unheeded, while she
listened to the silvery tones and soft persuasive
eloquence of her lover. Nor were her ideas of
space one atom more distinct than her ideas of
time. She wandered on without adverting either
to the extent or the direction of the ground she
was traversing. Jackson, however, was far more
geographically disposed. He contrived, while
pouring soft nonsense into her ear, very artfully
to lead her steps to the entrance of the dell in
which stood the cottage of the inimitable Beauty.
They entered together the narrow path which
led to it; and when arrived at its site, Jackson
made a full stop, and pointed it out to Maria's
notice.
" Dear me !" said she, " what a low roof!"
u Beneath that low roof," said Jackson, "is my
present retreat for retirement and safety. Come
in, my love, and see it."
Maria at first hesitated to enter, but her

no
scruples were soon overcome by Jackson, and the
consented to go in.
They descended the steps, and knocked at the
door. It was opened by the old woman, whose
appearance did not much prepossess Maria in
her favour, though she had been dressed for the
occasion with peculiar care and neatness. There
was a sinister expression in this woman's coun-
tenance which no art could relieve, or
hypocrisy disguise. It was in vain that she
attempted to dress her face in smiles : the mouth
might be distorted into something like a smile, but
the cold pale eye never changed its character of
hardheartedness and cunning. We cannot avoid
remarking here a most excellent provision of
nature. In the great majority of instances, an
evil disposition, and evil habits, give a stamp to
the countenance that cannot be mistaken: it is
hung out as a beacon for the warning of the
unwary; and the wicked carry, like the vagabond
Cain, a mark upon their forehead, that all who
see them may shun them. When this is not the
case with persons whose pursuits are culpable,
we may be assured that nature has given them
some redeeming qualities, and designed them for
better things.
Jackson now led Maria into a small sitting-
room, very neatly furnished : she observed, lying
on one of the chairs, a guitar and a music book.
A small mahogany case, filled with volumes,
very neatly bound, stood on a table next the wall:
## p. 335 (#361) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
335
on another table, in the centre of the room., a
cloth was laid as if for dinner.
Jackson looked at his watch, and said,
"My dear Maria, it is now five o'clock -
your dinner hour is past, and you must stop and
take some refreshment here."
He did not give her time to reply, but ordered
the old woman to bring in dinner, which she did
immediately. The repast was excellent; and
when it was concluded, a bottle of capital wine
was placed upon the table.
Nothing could be more tender and respectful
than the whole of Jackson's behaviour to Maria
during dinner, and after. He did not presume to
take the slightest liberties : not a gesture, word, or
look, escaped him that could alarm the most ap-
prehensive modesty; but all his conversation was
of love, of connubial happiness, of unspotted truth,
and unchangeable fidelity. He expatiated on
these themes with so much eloquence, and ac-
companied his language with looks of so much
affection and apparent sincerity, that his words
fell upon the "charmed ear" of Maria like the
sweetest music, sunk deep into her soul, and
melted her heart to a reciprocation of tenderness.
If she loved him before, she was now most
thoroughly enamoured : his soft and respectful
demeanour had banished all her fears, and she
gave herself up to the full enjoyment of the
society of the man she loved, forgetful of the past,
and careless of the future.
Jackson was not slow in perceiving the deep
## p. 336 (#362) ############################################
336
THE RED BARN.
impression which he had made. He thought the
present was the proper moment to press his suit,
and gain her immediate consent to be his : but
he had seen enough of her character to make him
forbear, even in the present most favourable
instance, to persuade her to yield, without the
preliminary of marriage ; and he was too manly
to try to accomplish his wishes by violence.
Deceit, however, with women, in such cases, he
thought perfectly admissible; and such is the
creed of many honourable libertines, who, in their
ordinary transactions with our sex, are far more
scrupulous than was Jackson.
He drew his chair nearer to that of Maria, and
taking her hand, whispered in the softest voice-
My dearest love, I told you that I would take
measures for our immediate union : I have done
so ;-everything is prepared, and we may be
united this very moment, if you will only consent
to be mine immediately. Do not refuse, my
dearest, only love."
"How is it possible?" exclaimed Maria; "now!
-why it cannot be."
" It can and will, Maria, if you but consent:
there is a clergyman, a friend of mine, near this,
and he will join our hands at once."
"Oh! but," said Maria, "it is so abrupt. My
father and mother
"Dearest Maria," cried he, "have I not your
promise that you will consent to a private
marriage ?-your parents shall know it in proper
time. Abrupt !--surely, now that all is ready,

THE RED BARN.
337
the sooner it is done the better : I cannot, Maria,
I will not, live without you any longer."
He used a great deal more persuasion in the
prosecution of his suit, and Maria's denials and
excuses grew fainter and fainter. At last she
yielded, tremulously saying,
Well, Stafford, I consent,-[ throw myself
entirely on your honour and protection.
" Dearest Maria !" exclaimed Jackson, "now,
indeed, you make me happy!" and folded her in
his embrace.
He arose immediately, took pen, ink, and
paper, and wrote the following:-

completely happy. My domestic will conduct you

He rung a small hand-bell, and the old woman
entered.
"Is Ricketts in the way?" demanded Jackson.
"Yes, sir," replied the woman.
" Tell him to take this note where it is directed."
The old woman vanished.
While waiting for the parson, Jackson did not
roller Maria to indulge in any reflection: he con-

tinued his former strain of amorous conversation,
accompanied with the most insinuating endear
ments. He made her also take another glass of
wine; for wine is a great auxiliary to the lover,--
it confuses the reason, enlivens the imagination,
and excites the passions.
The Reverend gentleman, for whom they
tarried, now made his appearance, and was
presented to Maria by Jackson.
He was dressed in the clerical style : his hair
brushed back from his forehead, both at the top
and sides, and most profusely saturated with
powder, which extended itself over the collar of
iis black coat, and half way down the back : tl.e
coat was very long, remarkably full in the skirts,
and altogether too big for him. His waistcoat, of
black silk, was also very long, with pocket-flaps
reaching to his thighs. His black velvet breeches,
all in wrinkles, were fastened at the knee with black
buckles. Black silk stockings, shoes with very large
buckles, a small white cravat without a collar, and
a bishop's hat, constituted the rest of the outward
He carried in his hand a large silk bag.
It is here necessary to observe, that a few
days before the time of which we are now writing,
Captain Creed received, in London, the following
pithy communication by post.
man,

a small favour. All I wrote to you about, in my

last letter, is settled ; come down to Polstead
immediately on receipt of this, and bring with
you the necessary things. We must afterwards
go to Ipswich, on the business I mentioned.
" Yours, very truly,
" JACKSON."
"P.S. On no account delay, as you love me
and good wine. Not a word to Smith or Hannah."
The gallant Captain, on reading this epistle,
instantly made all ready, took coach for Suffolk,
and arrived in time to attend Jackson's wedding.
In short, the Reverend gentleman, who now
stood before the expecting couple, was nobody
else but himself-Captain Cornelius Creed, of the
Scarafooka Rangers !
" Reverend sir," said Jackson, formally ad-
dressing Creed, "I have sent for you on the
happiest oecasion of my life ;- you must unite
this amiable young lady and myself in the
bands of holy matrimony. Come, sir, a glass of
wine."
"Not yet, thank you, Mr. Jackson," replied
his Reverence; "business of this kind must be
performed by one of our holy calling with dry lips.
I
suppose, Mr. Jackson, you have taken all the
preliminary steps ?"
* Yes, sir," replied Jackson, " I believe I have."
"Have you the licence ?'' rejoined the person.
"Oh yes !" said Jackson, opening a scrutoire,

and presenting him with a piece of parchment
folded
up;
" here it is."
Creed very gravely received the parchment,
took a pair of gold spectacles out of their case
with great deliberation, and clapping them upon
his nose, mumbled over the parchment for some
seconds.
"Stafford Jackson, -um-um; Maria Marten,
spinster,-um-um. You are sure, Mr. Jackson,
the names are right ?"
" Certain," cried Jackson.
"That is wellthat is well, Mr. Jackson ; for
otherwise the marriage might be void. Have you
the ring, Mr. Jackson ?"
"Yes, please your Reverence. "
" That is also well-very well, Mr. Jackson.
And now, young people," continued he, with vast
solemnity, "I suppose you have reflected well on
the grave nature of the contract on which you are
both about to enter ?"
"We have, your Reverence," said Jackson.
" That is also well-very well, Mr. Jackson :
and who is to give the bride away, and witness
the ceremony?"
On my word I have not thought of that, your
Reverence."
"Oh! but you should have thought of that,
it is a form we cannot dispense with : any one
may do it."
"Then," said Jackson, "there is my honest

follower, Tom Rickettsa blunt sailor, but a
good-hearted man."
" He will do very well," rejoined the pseudo-
ecclesiastic.
Jackson now called in Ricketts and the house-
keeper. The former was newly "rigged" in naval
style, --white trowsers, blue jacket, and black
silk handkerchief with sailor-knot.
" Tom," said Jackson, "I am going to be
married."
"God bless your honour !" said Tom; "I shall
be glad to see you happily splicedif I sha'nt,
damme."
"Don't swear, mine honest friend," said the
reverend Captain.
"Beg your Reverence's pardon," said Ricketts ;
no offence, I hope."
"Tom," said Jackson, you must give away
this young lady."
"That I will," cried Tom, " with pleasure;-
but to no one but your honour."
The gallant parson now opened his silk bag,
took out a surplice, and band; and having arrayed
himself leisurely " in pontificalibus," produced his
prayer-book, and read with much solemnity the
marriage service.
Jackson then embraced Maria, who was ex-
tremely agitated during the whole business ;
Ricketts and the house-keeper retired; and the
parson, divesting himself of his canonicals, sat

down to enjoy a glass of wine with the need
married couple.
Now," said he," business being done, enjoy-
ment may follow. When we have discharged the
calls of duty, we may attend to the calls ou
nature: frail flesh needeth refreshment.
and Mrs. Jackson, I wish you both many years of
happiness and prosperity."
" I thank your Reverence," replied Jackson ;
"and in drinking your health, allow me to offer
you a small tribute of gratitude for the happiness
you have been instrumental in introducing me to."
-And he handed over to the parson a bank note
folded up.
"Mr. Jackson," said the Light Infantry ec-
clesiastic, "you insult my friendship. I have
known and esteemed you for too many years, to
require payment for my services : take back'
your money, Mr. Jackson."
" Nay, but, my dear sir," cried Jackson, "I
do not offer you this as payment;- I only request
you to accept of it as a token of friendship."
Oh !" said the parson,
" that is quite
another affair :-as a token of friendship, Mr.
Jackson, I accept your money. Take a pinch of
snuff, sir," (presenting a massy silver box).
Jackson took the box, and taking a pinch out
of it, returned it; but Creed pushed it back to
him again, saying,
"When I presented you the box, Mr. Jackson,
## p. 343 (#369) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
343
I did not mean to receive it again. You have
given me a token of friendship, accept from me
another in exchange : put the box into your
pocket, or I shall be offended."
This was a serious whim of Creed's. Though
a man quite destitute of principle, he was not
incapable of the feelings of friendship; and
Jackson was the only man for whom he had such
feelings. Now, though his notions of justice were
in general so loose, he would not only not plunder
his friends, but he made a scruple of receiving
money from them, without a "
quid pro quo.
Jackson recollected this, and, with a bow, put
the snuff-box into his pocket.
Creed, having helped himself to as many
goplets of claret as he could, without infringing
on Jackson's precious time, now rose and said,
"My children, I must leave you : to-morrow
will be Sunday~ I have to officiate for a brother
clergyman, at Ipswich, and must depart early. i
Good night - I wish you all happiness."
The mock-parson departed; and over all that
followed we must draw a veil.
So fell Maria,- the victim, not of her own
vicious inclinations or passions, but of a course
of systematic deception by which the most
virtuous might have been ensnared. Few girls
of such inexperience and few, indeed, at all-
would have resisted so long as she did : multitudes
would have succumbed in the first instance, i
assailed by so accomplished and insinuating $

seducer as Jackson. And, after all, she was not,
properly speaking, seduced ;-her principles wen
not perverted, nor was she led to act wilfully
against the dictates of virtue: she complied with
nothing but what, to her apprehensions, was
perfectly lawful ;-her only error was in
ceding to a clandestine intercourse in the first
instance, and then swerving from her resolution.
not to renew it. But, surely, in a girl of such
simplicity, inexperience, and susceptibility of
heart, such an error will not be deemed worthy
of the severest reprobation. Many women, who
have preserved their chastity, or at least their
reputation, have been far removed from the pos-
session of such purity of soul as belonged to
Maria ; and if the most prudish of the sex should
be inclined to condemn her, let them examine
their own hearts, and let her "who is without
sin among them, cast the first stone."

LEXIS.
While the incidents, whose description has :
occupied our latter chapters, were taking place,
Barnard'had scarcely ever bestowed even a pass-
ing thought upon Maria. If he did think of her
at all, it was only with feelings of indignation
and contempt.' He thought of her only as a girl
of depraved mind, who would have made use of
him, as a cover for her shame, and a security for
the continuation of her illicit intercourse with
another. Tenderness and regret were not mingled
with his sentiments respecting her. He congra-
tulated himself on his escape, and rejoiced in his
immunity.
But the fact was, that such thoughts rarely
crossed his mind. He was far too much occupied,
and agitated by present feelings and incidents,
TY

THE RED BARN,
to indulge in much reflection on the past. He
was kept in a continual whirlwind of dissipation,
between the pleasures of society, and the bottle,
and the caresses of his syren mistress. Her
iniluence over him became more and more
unbounded, his appetite grew by what it fed on,
and he soon began to think that the true end of
existence was perpetual amusement and per-
petual gratification.
Ir the midst, however, of all this mental
inte ication, an unpleasant suggestion of con-
science would occasionally intrude itself,that
u still small voice" which will make itself heard,
even by the most vicious breast, until a long course
of practical depravity, aided by theoretical per-
version, shall have silenced its warnings. Bar-
nard had been brought up with a respect for the
principles of religion. He had never for a
moment been led to doubt of the truth of Chris-
tianity; and little as his conduct accorded with
its precepts, he was not without a certain reve-
rence for its authority. It was no better feeling,
it is true, than the force of custom and the pre-
judice of education ; but it was sufficient to make
him feel that he was not acting right--to render
him now and then uneasy under a sense of his
misconduct, and fearful of punishment in another
life.
Under the abuse of certain forms and doctrines
of religion, we have heard of many vicious men,
who proceeded comfortably enough in their courge

of criminality, without either renouncing their
faith, or suffering any twinges of remorse. Thus,
with some, the compliance with certain exterior
ceremonies is sufficient to atone for the greatest
vice, and ward off the vengeance of offended
heaven; with others, the doctrine, that where
the faith is correct, and election insured, conduct
is a matter of total indifference, answers the
purpose of quieting their consciences equally
well. But where religion is taught to be insepa-
rable from moral conduct; where the only offering
stated to be acceptable to the Deity is a pure
heart; and where true faith is only admitted to
exist from its natural fruits of temperance, jus-
tice, and charitythere the religious belief must
be demolished, before the mind of the sinner can
be at ease under the weight of his iniquities.
Such was as yet the case with Barnard; like the
devils, he" believed and trembled."
This last check, however, on his career of vice
and folly, was destined speedily to be removed.
His friends Smith and Creed were thorough-paced
infidels. The latter had travelled, was a man
of some education, and a systematic disbeliever,--
having imbibed in France, both froin reading and
conversation, the pernicious dogmas of infidelity.
As for Smith, he had never received any religious
instruction in youth, and had never given the
subject a thought of any kind until lately, when
he suddenly became a proselyte of Mr. Carlile.
The doctrines, of which that gentleman became

so active and notorious a disseminator, were too
suitable to the inclinations and practice of Beauty,
not to be embraced by him with the warmest
avidity: he soon became a preacher and propa-
gator of the new opinions he had adopted; and
when the subject of Christianity was mentioned,
he indulged in the most violent philippics against
our holy religion, and the most blasphemous
ridicule of its sacred mysteries.
The motive and object of persons like Carlile,
who are so ardent in the extermination of religious
opinions, cannot for one moment be mistaken.
They are not actuated, as they themselves give
out, by a philosophic love of truth, and a philan-
thropic regard to the human species : were this
the case, we might pity their error, while we con-
demn it and strenuously oppose its propagation.
But their direct object is the furtherance of their
own sordid interest; and their great aim is to
sap the foundations of morality as well as religion,
and disturb the basis of political order. They do
not hate religion so much for itself alone, and in
the abstract, as because it is the great cement of
moral and social happiness: they would willingly
support any system of superstition, that allowed
them to indulge their gross passions to the full,
and to plunder their neighbours with impunity;
but they hate a religion which enjoins temperance,
soberness, and chastity, justice to our fellow-men,
and obedience to the laws. This we cannot
doubt, when we invariably find the character of

the infidel apostle united with that of the political
incendiary; and that Mr. Carlile's morality is no
better than his religion, will be evident to any
one who takes the trouble of perusing many of
his publications, professedly unconnected with the
subject of religion.
The persons who suffer most from the spread
of opinions hostile to Christianity, are the lower
orders, and the half-educated among the middle ;
the rest, though open enough to the contagion of
infidel principles, have yet, from circumstances,
so many guards over their conduct, that, however
we may deplore their errors, they are not pro-
ductive of such extended mischief. It is un-
fortunate, indeed, for any individual to be desti-
tute of religion ; he is thereby deprived of the
greatest source of happiness, and the strongest
motive to uniform purity of life : but still, men of
certain stations and certain professions, must of
necessity keep up the appearance of decency
The taste which education imparts, may prevent
them from being grossly immoral; and their
interest must induce them to support the system
of social order: but when persons of vulgar
habits and no education are freed from the re-
straints of religion, the most fatal consequences
to themselves and to society may be expected to

abandon themselves to the most dangerous crimes
and the most disgusting and brutal vices.
Barnard, as I have hinted, was not without an
unpleasant twinge now and then, when the idea of
hell suggested itself: but it was nothing but the
base and servile feeling of fear that operated upon
him; he had no horror at the deformity of vice,
no regrets for having quitted the paths of inno-
All the feelings which acted upon him
when he returned from his first trip to London
were gone by, never to return: the seeds of
virtue were blasted and dried up within him ; but
the fear of hell remainedthe only check to the
last extremity of wickedness.
He was sitting one evening with Creed and
Sinith, at the lodgings of the latter, and the con-
versation happened to turn on the fate of a man
who was hanged that morning for murder. The
case was of a very aggravated character, as the
murder had been perpetrated in cold blood, upon
a woman, and with many other circumstances of
cruelty. Creed expressed his reprobation of the
deed in very strong terms, in which he was joined
by Smith, who, bad as he was, was incapable of
sympathizing with a cruel, cold blooded murderer,
" If there be anything," said Creed, "which
deserves hanging, it is an act like this."
"I agree with you," said Smith: "not that I
have quite so much respect for human life as you
have; I would not hesitate to kill those who arcod

n my way, fairly and openly;-but a weak.
defenceless woman l-faugh! it is a stain on
manhood that nothing can wash out but blood.
I almost wish, for the fellow's sake, tha.t there was
a hell."
" I have frequently heard you," said Barnard,
" talk as if there were none; but I am very much
afraid there is, after all."
" Fudge !" said Smith; "all old women's tales
and priestcraft that doctrine might have gone
down very well a hundred years ago; but we are
not to be humbugged that way now, thanks to the
march of intellect,' as my friend Carlile says."
"But how can any one tell," rejoined Barnard,
" that there is not such a place ?"
" I'll tell you, Mr. Barnard," said Captain
Creed; " " because, upon my principle, it is the
height of nonsense and injustice. Half an hour's
roasting would be, I should think, punishment
enough for the greatest criminal that ever yet
existedeven for the scoundrel who was hanged
this morning : but roasting eternally is rather too
much of a good joke."
Yes," said Smith, singing ; " by the powers !
it is rather too bad."
" Besides," resumed Creed, " before you can
prove a hell, you must prove that there is an
existence of any kind after death."
"And don't you believe that there is ?.said
Barnard ;  don't
you
believe that the soul liver
sfter the body ?"

352
THE RED BARN,
" Indeed I do not, Mr. Barnard," replied
Creed; "and allow me to ask you in return,
What is the soul ? did you ever see your soul?
It would be a fine thing, as Voltaire says, if we
could see our soul."
Nu," said Barnard; "I have not seen it, but
we are told that there is such a thing."
"So we may be toll," said Creed, "that the
moon is made of green cheese. "The soul ! a mere
phantom! What is the soul? if it be anything, it
is the thinking power within us.
And permit me
to ask, Mr. Barnard, in what state that power, ,
or soul, is with you, when you are drunk? when
you are dead asleep? when you are very ill ?-
Does it not depend altogether upon the state of
your body-Can you write a letter as well after
a hearty dinner and a bottle of wine, as when
you are cool, collected, and fasting ? ---Don't tell
me about a soul that can do nothing without the
body, or in spite of the body. If its actions are
impeded by the slightest ailment of that body
is it reasonable to believe that it can act at all
when that body is destroyed ?"
"But I recollect," replied Barnard, " to have
heard our parson say, that all you have now
mentioned only proves that the soul and body are
united here; that in the present state the soul
cannot do without the body; but that hereafter
it will be able to do without it."
"My dear sir," said Creed, "what proof is
there of this ? Not one. Before we can believe
## p. 353 (#379) ############################################
THE RED BARN..
353
that the soul can act without the body, we should
have some proofs of its capacity to do so. But
we never see any such thing; therefore we have
no reason to believe it. Until I see one instance
of the mind (which is the soul) acting without
the body, I will never believe that it can do so.
But the fact is, that the soul, or mind, is nothing
but the brain; on the state of which, and the
general state of the body, the thinking power
depends."
Barnard remained silent, and seemed puzzled
and confounded. He was incapable of replying
to the sophistries of Creed, and was, besides, but
too well disposed to receive them. The Captain,
resumed
"You should read on these subjects, Mr. Bar-
nard, and enlighten your mind."
" Yes," cried Smith ; "read Paine's * Age of
Reason,that's the book for you."
" Paine is very good," said Creed, " for exposing
the humbug of the Bible,-he demolishes that in
prime styletherefore
you
should read him;- but
Paine had his weaknesses. He was inclined to
believe in the immortality of the soul. In this
respect, indeed, he was more absurd than the par-
sons. He would only allow himself, and a few
other clever fellows, to have immortal souls, while
tbe rest were to be annihilated. But if

mind at rest or the subjects of Hell and God
Almighty."
"Ay," said Beauty, "and read Carlile's little
book, called, "What 18 God?' If you bother
yourself about such nonsense ever after, I'll for-
feit my head for a halfpenny."
Barnard followed the advice of his two friends,
and soon became deeply versed in all the myste-
ries of infidelity. He sucked in the poison with
the utmost avidity, and it produced its intended
effect, for his mind was a proper recipient for it.
His new doctrines accorded completely with his
mode of life: he congratulated himself on his
escape from hell fire, and wondered at his former
besotted credulity. His mind became, now, fully
prepared for the commission of every excessfor
the violation of every principle-for the perpe-
tration of every atrocity. The fear of hell being
removed, but one check remained- the fear of the
gallows,-a fear which has too often been found
insufficient to keep men virtuous.
Barnard, not finding that any advantageous mode
of employing his capital occurred, allowed it to
slumber, as he thought securely, in the hands of
Xiutototle and Co. The 100, in addition to some
moderate winnings at gaming, kept him in funds
for some little time longer. But his and Hannah's
expensive style of living soon reduced his
exchequer to the last farthing. This, however,
gave him no uneasiness, as he calculated a
securely on the deposit in the City.
## p. 355 (#381) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
365
It may not be amiss to remark here, that the
style in which Barnard lived was far more expen-
sive, comparatively speaking, than that of
persons
who make a much superior figure in life.
Men
who muddle away (to use a vulgar but expressive
phrase) money in taverns and public places in
pursuit of pleasure, do often spend a greater
numerical sum in the year, than gentlemen who
keep regular establishments, and even an equi-
page. The money goes, they cannot tell how;
--they have nothing to show for it, and are
perfectly astonished themselves, when they find
it all expended. The fact is, that they pay for
everything twice, or three times, as much as any.
body else : they utterly disregard the old proverb
"Take care of the pence, and the pounds will
take care of themselves ;" and when they have
lavished their all, they find that they have
purchased nothing but fatigue, dissatisfaction, and
disappointment.
Barnard, now completely short of cash, resolves
to draw on his friend, Xiutototle, for a few
hundreds. He communicates his intention to
Hannah, who regrets the necessity of "breaking
bulk," but, of course, is forced to accede to it.
Away he posts to the City, in the full confidence
of receiving the cash : he goes to "Three King
Court,"hope elevating, and joy brightening, his
crest. The first thing that excites a shadow of
misgiving, is his not observing the names of Xiuto

totle and Killganders on the landing-place, where
they formerly cut so conspicuous a figure. This,
however, makes no very deep impression on hm:
he proceeds up stairs to their office on the first
floor. From there, wonderful to relate, the names
had also disappeared : the doors, too,
too, were
fastened up, and not a trace of a human being,
or  vestige of any notice of the worthy merchants,
to be found!
Barnard, to use the expression of old Moses
Thick, of the "Salisbury Arms," was "struck all of
a heap." He thought at first he must have been
mistaken in the office, and galloped up and down
stairs three times in a vain search for the names of
Xiutototle and Killganders. He went into some
neighbouring sets of chambers with no better
effect; nor could he see any one of whom to
make inquiries.
On coming down into the court, he observed a
fellow sitting at a sort of stall, with the implements
of shoe-blacking before him.-Barnard addressed
him.
" Friend," said he, "can you tell me what is
become of Xiutototle and Killganders ?"
"Who, your worship ?" cried the fellow,
opening a mouth from ear to ear, and shutting
one eye.
" Xiutototle and Killganders," replied Barnard;
" the great merchants who lived here."
"Ah! your worship," resumed the shoeofack,

357
displaying a glorious set of rotten teeth in a
most inimitable grin; "it won't do-I'm not to
done, your worship."
"Done! you rascal; what do you mean? I ask
you if you know anything about Don Josiah
Xiutototle, the great Mexican merchant, whose
counting-house was here?"
" Hah! hah! hah! your worship's merry," said
the Huntite, applying the thumb-nail of his
open
hand to his nose; "but it won't do: it a'n't the
tirst of April ;-I'm not to be had."
Impudent scoundrel !" cried Barnard, "are
you laughing at me ?I'll teach you to laugh the
wrong side of your mouth."
He had just raised his stick, which was about
to descend on the bald pate of the unfortunate
shoeblack, when his attention was arrested by a
figure at the end of the court, which he thought
he knew, On approaching, he recognized to be
that of one of the ragged clerks of the evaporated
firm, whom he had heard addressed by the appel-
lative of Eugene. He came up and spoke to him.
"Your name, I think, is Eugene ;-do you
recollect me ?"
"Oh ees, saar, recollect vel,--Monsieur Bar-
nard, I tink?"
Yes ;-what is become of Don Josiah, and

"Dom Josiah |-hah! hah !-you do not know

" And have you no idea where they are gone ?"
said Barnard.
"Oh si," rejoined honest Eugene; "I suppose

Kill-de-gander to de deble."
" This is a pretty business !" said Barnard ;

" Confound the swindlers !" said Barnard,
walking off in no very pleasant temper.
His reflections were of the most distressing
character, as he walked along,-he had not the
least idea what he could do. He cursed the
foolish advice of Smith and Creed ; and he
cursed his own folly in pursuing it. How should

he manage with his father?-how should be
manage with himself and Hannah ?-he was
thoroughly vexed and bewildered.
In this mood, he turned into a tavern to try
the effect of a glass of brandy. The first person
he saw sitting there, in a box by himself, when he
entered, was Don Josiah Xiutototle !--not, how-
ever, as the Mexican merchant, in masquerade ;
but in his natural character, plainly dressed in
black, as the one-eyed gentleman, or rascal, for
in his case the terms were synonymous.
He professed the greatest degree of pleasure
and surprise at the sight of his good friend, Mr.
Barnard, whom he had not had the pleasure of
meeting for so long a time; inquired affec-
tionately after the health of Mr. Smith and
Captain Creed, and insisted on having the honour
of treating Mr. Barnard to a glass of brandy and
water.
"People may talk as they like, Mr. Barnard,"
said he, "about drinking before dinner; but
drink, sir, with moderation, is good at all times
the hour makes no difference; and men, fatigued
by application or perplexed with care, require
refreshment at all times.
"The last is my case," replied Barnard; "I
never was so perplexed and annoyed in the course
of my life, as I am just now."
"Pray what is the cause of your annoyance,
Mr. Barnard, if I may be bold enough to ask ?"

were
"I have lost seventeen hundred pounds," said
Barnard.
" My God, sir! at the old work, eh!-the
cards. Do, sir, let me caution you against caril-
playing; I have not touched a card since I last
played with you, and then I was, in fact, inad-
vertently seduced to play."
"No!" replied Barnard ; " I did not lose the
money at cards,--that would have been some
consolation to me; I should have considered that
enly as the fortune of war: but I was robbed, sir,
-robbed infamously of my money."
"Dear me! then you were out late in the
neighbourhood of Hounslow Heathor Bethnal
Green, peradventure; or perhaps you
drunk, Mr. Barnard, and went from the Finish to
Mrs. Mendoza's,-dangerous place for young men
with money."
" No such thing !" roared Barnard; "I was
robbed, sir, -rebbed by worthy merchants in the
City."
"Nay, now, Mr. Barnard, you're facetious-
you are trying how far I can be hoaxed.
well! I can take a joke as well as another.
Robbed by worthy merchants !-hah! hah! hah!
-that's a good one."
"I tell you, sir," said Barnard, "I was never
less inclined to joke in my life : I entrusted
seventeen hundred pounds with merchants in the
City; and this morning, 012 going to draw a few

hundreds, I found their counting-house shut up,
and themselves gone, God knows where."
"Oh! my dear sir, I beg your pardon," cried
the one-eyed hypocrite. "I am truly, sincerely
sorry.--Alas! sir, there are many ticklish charac-
ters in the mercantile world. No knowing whom
to trust, sir, now-a-days. No man knows that
better than myself.But, sir, who were these
merchants ?"
" The firm of Xiutototle and Killganders,"
replied Barnard, and then gave a minute detail
of the whole business: When he had concluded,
the other with the utmost gravity observed,
" Ah! sir, how unfortunate it was that you
did not meet me before you lodged your money
with these swindlers. I am acquaintea with
everything in the mercantile world, and could have
directed you where you might have lodged your
money safely. I am myself chief conducting
clerk to the house of Buckles, Bagster, and
Buchanan,' and I have the first commercial infor-
mation of every kind. There would have been
some chance for
you,
if
you
had fallen into any
other hands : but, sir, you have fallen into most
infamous hands. I know this Xiutototle well-,
a greater rascal does not exist, between you und me.
He owed our firm 500, which is gone for ever."
"Then you think," said Barnard, "I have no
chance of recovering the money ?"
"Not the slightest," replied Polyphemus : "I
wish with all my heart I could give you some

hopes ; for I sympathize most sincerely with your
misfortune. But I know the fellow too well, and
his blessed partner, Mr, Killganders. Take my
word for it, sir, you'll never get a rap."
" Then their acknowledgment is of no use,
said Barnard.
"Not worth a button !They have left the
kingdom; and, besides, they had not a fraction of
property."
"But how did they contrive to deceive people ?"
said Barnard.
"I'll tell you," replied he of the single optic.
"In commercial life there are great opportunities
for cheating. I know the history of this firm
well. They entered into business, pretending to
be Mexican merchants of great wealth. They
opened an account at a respectable banking house,
by way of reference. They then drove a famous
trade in bills, so contriving it that all the bills
should become due at once. They began, for
instance, by accepting bills at twelve months,
then nine, and so on, shortening the time until
within a month of the expiration of the year.
Now the bills being all due, the worthy mer-
chants have decamped."
"Then, indeed," said Barnard, "there is no
chance."
"I am sorry, Mr. Barnard," said he, rising
and shaking him most cordially by the hand;
"very sorry for you indeed. But I cannot give
you any hopes. Your money, sir, is gone! lost

to you as certainly as if you had thrown it into
the river. I am very sorry for you, but you
may rest assured you will never see one farthing
of the money.
Good morning, Mr. Barnard,
good morning !-I am truly sorry for you."
The one-eyed gentleman made his exit, leaving,
by some unaccountable lapse of memory, his
friend Barnard to pay the piper.
Barnard now proceeded home with a heavy
heart and light purse, where, on his arrival, further
consolation and sympathy awaited him. He told
the case to Hannah, who of course affected to
be overwhelmed with grief and astonishment.
He consulted her on what he could possibly do,-
and she told him that he had better advise again
with Smith, who perhaps could assist him, or, at
all events, point out some plan to retrieve his
finances. "See him, my love," said Hannal;
"hear what he has to say, and let me know.
Among us all, it is hard if we cannot contrive
something."
Barnard approved of this counsel, and, in per-
suance of it, called on Beauty, whom he found
alone."
"Well, Smith, this is a very pretty affair," began
Barnard; " and I have to thank your
advice for
it."
" What's the matter ?" said Smith.
"Nothing," said Barnard, "but that Xiutototle
is gone off, and my money is gone along with
99
him.

THE RED BAKN.
"Is it possible?" exclaimed Beauty, with a
look of deep sympathy.
" It is too true," replied the other, and told
him all we have described.
" What a shame!" cried Smith; "who'd have
thought it ?-men so well recommended, and
apparently so 'wealthy! You, however, are no
the only sufferer,-Jackson has lost at least
2000 by them."
" How could you have given me such advice,
Jack ?" resumed Barnard.
"My dear fellow," said Beauty,
" am I a
prophet, that I could foresee what has come to
pass ?-am I a conjuror, to dive into men's
thoughts? They have deceived multitudes as
well as you: Jackson has lost his property. I
was weak enough to take a bill of theirs myself,
ten days ago, for 100: it has thirty days to run
yet, and I must pay it or be arrested, for I have
passed it away."
"Well, Jack, I don't know what to do; I have
no money" my father has been writing about the
payment for the cattle;-in short, I am per-
plexed and harassed excessively."
"Take courage, man," cried Jack; "fain
heart never won fair lady: difficulties are the
element of the ingenious. For my part, I love
dearly to be in hot water :-we'll soon strike out
something."
"Can you assist me, Jack, with a little casa?
"My dear Barnard," said Smith, "my purse

is at your service; but, unfortunately, it is very
light just now. Its amount is ten pounds, which
I will most willingly share with you; but that
won't help you far: you want a good round sum."
"How shall I get it ?" said Barnard.
"Before I tell you," replied Smith, "allow
me to put a question or two to you.
Certainly," replied Barnard.
"You know," resumed Smith, with vast
gravity of manner, "the pains we have taken to
enlighten your mind on all subjects of importance.
We (I mean Creed and myself) have introduced
you into real life-; we have given you proper rules
for your conduct; we have tried to beat out of
your head all those nonsensical ideas about
honesty, &c., which you brought with you from
the country; and, above all, we have endeavoured
to root out of your mind that useless of all
things, religion. Have we succeeded, William
Barnard ?"
" To be sure you have," replied Barnard.
" You are certain that you have lost all respect
for that common honesty, which, as a great
author (published by Carlile) well observes, is
one of the suret non-conductors of the best
feelings of the human heart?"
"No doubt about it," replied the catechumen.
Moreover, you are quite rid of your super-
stitious notions, and have no fear of Heaven or
Hell ?"
"I regard them as mere phantoms," said Bar-

nard; "in my last conversation with Carlile, he
settled their hash."
" 'Tis well," said Smith; "now hear me :-
you want money,you cau't get on without a
good sum. There are but two ways of raising it
at present;by chousing your father, or com-
mitting a robbery. Now, I never recommend
the latter, except in a case of absolute necessity."
"I suppose not," said Barnard, laughing;
"but, seriously, how do you recommend me to go
to work ?"
" You can raise no money from your father,
until you have settled for the cattle : you must
pay for them first, before you can draw any more
blood from the old boy."
"Nay, Jack," cried Barnard, " this is ill-timed
jesting. You know I have not a farthing, and
you talk of my paying for the cattle."
"I am quite serious," replied Smith; "you
shall
pay for the cattle, and yet it shall not be a
farthing out of your pocket."
"Explain yourself," said Barnard.
" Don Josiah Xiutototle has swindled you out
of
your money, I think ?"
" Too true : but what of that?"
" He has literally robbed you of seventeen
hundred pounds ?"
" He has, he has," cried Barnard, impatiently
" The worst of it was, too," continued the
imperturbable Smith, "that it was all in havi
cash."

It was, it was; but what of that, in God's
me?"
*Had it been goods," proceeded the inveterate
tormentor, "there might have been some con-
solation; for the goods, you know, might have
been damaged, and not worth the entire money."
" That's true," said Barnard ; "but I don't

"Or if you had only given your bill for the
money, there would have been a good chance,
as you might have shirked payment."
"What are you driving at, Smith ?" cried
Barnard, most impatiently.
"Be easy," said Beauty,
" and hear me. I
don't mention Xiutototle for the purpose of re-
minding you
of
your misfortunes, but that you
may be able to extract some good out of the evil
that has befallen you. The wisest of us may be
taken in, but it is only the fool that cannot profit
by experience. You have got an acknowledgment
for
your money from this Xiutototle?"
"I have," answered the other; "but I have
been told it is not worth a button."
"You were told rightly: in a commercial point
of view it is worth nothing; but it will go
hard if
we cannot make it worth something to us.
Have
you got it about you
"Yes," said Barnard, "here it is.
" The very thing," said Smih; "now you
shall see what it is to be a man of genius: we
will make Mr. Xiutototle reimburse part of your

State that you sold the cattle for 350, which was
the factthat you were about to remit hin. the
money, when you met a person from America,
who proved to you that by investing it in the
purchase of both corn and cattle, to sell again for
exportation, you might make a good profitthat
you did so, and realized a few hundredsthat
this encouraged you to proceed-and, in short,
that you entered regularly into the corn and cattle
trade, made the sum of eighteen hundred pounds,
seventeen hundred of which you lodged for
security with Xiutototle and Killganders (who
are better than the Bank), and that you now send
their acknowledgment to him, thinking it will be
more safe in his hands than yours; and also that
he may have the satisfaction of being assured that
you have not misspent his money."
"This is very well," said Barnard ; " but I don't
see how this is to induce my father to send me
any money: on the contrary, he won't think
that I want money; or, if I did, I might take it
from the deposit."
" You are dull, William,  duller than the fat
weed that rots itself with ease on Lethe's wharf.'

offered of disposing of horses to great advantage:
he has no use for his four hunters-he never
hunts;let him send them up to you. Tell him
another cock and bull story about grain and hay;
-let him send you as much as he can. We'll
raise the wind again, and trust to Providence and
Don Josiah to discharge our debts,the only
thing I would trust to them for."
"I will do it immediately," exclaimed Barnard.
* Do so," said Smith; " and now you will
have no occasion to make excuses to your father
for your stay in London. Business, you know,
must be attended to."
Barnard wrote a long letter to his father, the
substance of which we have already given ; and
the style underwent revision from the critical
hand of Beauty. It was dispatched, and a few
days after it brought back the most favourable
answer from the old man, who was quite over-
joyed with his son's success, and highly pleased at
his address in business, thriftiness, and prudence.
The hunters, hay, and corn, "followed hard
upon." They quickly travelled the road that
the cattle had pursued before, and fetched alto-
gether the sum of 520.
This money Barnard was fully determined not
to entrust to the keeping of any worthy merchant,
nor did Smith use any of his persuasive powers to
that effect at present;-on the contrary, he
au vised him this time to give the money into the

keeping of Hannah ; with which advice Barnard,
without delay, complied.
Hannah, we should have mentioned before, had
given her full approbation to the mode suggested
by Beauty for raising the cash.
It is, perhaps, almost superfluous to inform the
reader, that the seventeen hundred pounds, lodged
with the worthy Mexican, had been equally
divided among the depredators; and that the
present sum of 520 shared the same fate.
Barnard was now very rapidly approaching to
me gulph of irretrievable perdition. His passions
had received the full rein, his principles had been
utterly destroyed, and nothing was wanting but
further embarrassments, and the impossibility of
drawing any more from his father in any way, to
lead him to the consummation of any crime. He
was approximating to the devil with a velocity,
the ratio of which increased in proportion to the
diminution of the distance; and something soon
occurred which lent an additional impulse to his
hellward career.
A week had passed on right jollily, in feasting,
drinking, frolic, and debauchery, when, one
morning, two men knocked at the door where
Barnard lived, inquired for Mrs. Woods, walked
up stairs, and arrested her without ceremony for
the sum of 800. They took her off directly to
a spunging-house.
Barnard was not within at the time this oc-

curred, but returned home very soon.
He found
the servant-maid in the greatest grief and con-
fusion imaginable. She told him the piteous
tale, with all that embellishment of style and
pathos with which the fair sex so well understand
how to give effect to their stories of disaster.
Barnard was thoroughly confounded: he asked
the maid if she knew where her mistress had been
taken to. She answered, that she had heard one
of the men say that they would take her to No. 19,
Chancery Lane, until the business was settled.
Barnard posted off immediately to this address.
Inquiring for Mrs. Woods, he was shown into a
room, where he found her sitting at a table, her
head leaning on her hand, and deep dejection
painted on her countenance. She rose suddenly
on his entrance, rushed into his embrace, and burst
into a flood of tears,
* Oh, William!" said she, "I am truly un-
fortunate."
My dear Hannah," cried Barnard, "explain
this business. How comes it that you have been
arrested ?"
" I will tell you," said she, "in a few words.
My late husband was a very extravagant and
improvident man: he got considerably into debt
with his agent here. After his death, I got a
small yearly pension, and continuing to employ
the same agent, I was foolish enough to become
responsible for my husband's debt, and signed a
hand accordingly. The agent agreed to take so

372
THE RED BARN.
much every year, by instalments, until the debt
was paid. Unfortunately, he has become a
bankrupt, and the persons who now manage the
estate have resolved to arrest every one who
was in debt to it.
The portion of my laie
husband's debt remaining unpaid, and some little
money that necessity obliged me to overdraw,
have raised their claim on me to 800, for which
I have been arrested this morning, and I have no
means whatever of paying."
"But," said Barnard, "perhaps the parties can
be brought to some terms."
"I fear not," said Hannah; "there is one parti-
cular person who directs all these proceedings,
and with him I know there is no chance : he is
the most inflexible and unfeeling of rogues."
" Who is he?" asked Barnard.
" His name is Whitehead," replied Hannah; ;
" he is what is termed a public accountant,--that
is, a fellow whose business it is to make
make up the
accounts of bankrupts in such a manner, that the
quantity of money owing to them shall be
increased, and the quantity that they owe de-
creased, thus enabling them to come better out
of the hands of the Commissioners. Now this
fellow, moreover, has a strong dislike to me; for
you must know that, after my husband's death,
he thought proper to make love to me. I treated
him with contempt, and now he takes this, mode
of being revenged upon me."
"What a scoundrel !" said Barnard ; " but

perhaps be'll take half the money, and our security
for the rest."
"I'll try him," said Hannah; "but I have no
great hopes of success;I'll send for him to come
here."
"Do so, my love," rejoined Barnard, "and
meanwhile I'll go and look for Smith and consult
with him. He's a clever fellow, and may be able
to set us all to rights again."
Barnard then set off for Beauty's lodgings, but
on his arrival there was told that Mr. Smith had
just gone out. Greatly disappointed, he posted
off to the residence of Creed, where he was
equally unsuccessfulthe noble Captain had also
sallied forth for a promenade. He then employed
more than two hours in a fruitless search for them
in all their usual daily haunts. He returned,
fatigued and rather vexed, to Hannah. Her
countenance seemed inflamed with anger, and her
eyes looked red, as if from weeping.
"Have you seen him, Hannah?" said Barnard.
Yes," she replied ; " the wretch has been
here."
" And will he come to no terms ?" rejoined the
young man.
" None," said Hannah, "but such as I would
die ten times over sooner than submit to."
" What are they?" asked Barnard.
"Oh! my dear William, I cannot tell you."
"Nay, but," said Barnard, "let me hear;
perhaps something may be done."

" Yu shall judge then," replied she. "I
offered him half the debt, and security for the
remainder. And what do you think was the
answer of the villain ?"
"I cannot guess," said Barnard.
"He said he had no objection to accede to the
terms, provided I would yield myself into the
bargain."
"I'll cut his throat!" exclaimed Barnard, in a
paroxysm
of
rage.
"My love," replied Hannah," how can you be
so yiolent ?"
" Violent !" cried Barnard ; methinks I am
very mild;curse the rascal, I could stab him in
the dark. I could trample him into paste," re-
peated he, stamping desperately on the floor.
Barnard's naturally unprepossessing countenance
assumed, on this occasion, an expression that
alarmed even Hannah. His face became pallid
and convulsed-his cold blue eye was fixed in
stern regard, and there was something fiendish in
his whole aspect.
"My love !" said she, approaching him, "don't
be thus agitated. This is an unfortunate affair-
I must only go to prison."
Never!" cried Barnard : "I will sacrifice
everything I will do anything first."
"You have already sacrificed too much for me,
William, you shall sacrifice no more.
But I will though : I'll sacrifice my father,
my whole family, and myself. You shall never

go to prison---still less
oh ! curse the
villain !"
"Nay, my dear William, no more of that," said
Hannah.
" Well, Hannah, the scoundrel must be paid,
and shall be, even if I were to die for it. I
have not been able to see Smith,-I must go look
for him again. Farewell, my love; you shall not
see me until I bring your deliverance."
So saying, he departed.
He had not gone
many yards, when he met the very man whom
he wanted most particularly to see, viz. Mr.
Beauty Smith,
"Smith," said Barnard, "I have been looking
for
you
the whole day."
I heard," answered Beauty, "that you were
at my lodgings; but what's the matter, man?
you're looking like a ghost."
Barnard took him by the arm, and explained
the whole business. He concluded by pressing
him earnestly for his advice and assistance.
"William," said Beauty, "this is an awkward
affair; but we cannot discuss it in the street.
Come into Jack Randall's, and we'll excogitate
the matter over a glass of ale. In knotty points
I find ale useful."
"Come along, then," said Barnard.
They entered the mansion of bonest Jack,
(now, alas ! no morethe unsuspecting victim of
genuine Deady), and got into a little room by
themselves. The ale being brought, Beauty took

a deep draught, and then opened his mouth,
which to Barnard was like the oracle of Delphos.
William," said he, " this woman is a source
to you of great expense; it has often struck me
that you'd be better off if you got rid of her alto
gether. A good opportunity now offers. You
can't pay this debt of 800, and therefore you
may as well cut the connexion."
What!" said Barnard, "and let her go to
prison? You can't be serious."
" Let me tell you," resumed Smith, "that
people live better in prison than you think, espe-
cially the ladies ;-King's Bench no bad place for
them. But as for prison, I don't think she need
fear it. I am of opinion that that gallant gertie-
man, Whitehead, would not allow her to go to pri-
son. If you were to quit Hannah, they'd soon
make up matters, you may depend upon it; there-
fore, my advice to you is, to bother yourself no
more about the affair."
"Mr. Smith," said Barnard, " if
"if you have no
better advice than this to offer, you might as well
have held your tongue. I'd have you to know,
that I will never desert Hannah: I love her better
than the whole world ; and if I cannot keep her
out of prison, I will go there and live with her
myself. And as for the scoundrel whom you
just mentioned, I'd tear him piecemeal with
pleasure."
"Oh! ho !" cried Beauty, "I did not think
you were so far gone. As Colonel Oldboy says,

When love gets into the youthful brain,
Instruction is needless, and caution valo.'
But really, my dear fellow, I beg your pardon.
I was not seriousI only meant to try you:
Hannah is a most admirable woman, and well
merits all your affection. But, upon my soul,
this is a ticklish case."
"Can you suggest nothing ?" said Barnard.
"Why, you see," replied Smith, "there is no
use in writing to the old fellow now, and I don't
think we can get any more out of Xiutototle."
"But," cried Barnard, "you must know of
other ways of raising the wind."
"I do, William ; but I am afraid they require
more strength of mind than you possess."
" Why should you doubt me?" said Barnard.
"You are quite sure, then, that you have got
rid of all your moral and religious scruples ?-are
you quite sure that there is no more of the yellow
clay sticking to you
?
"Where's the use of all this catechizing ?"
replied Barnard. "You talked, sometime ago,
of a robbery in case of necessityif it be neces-
sary now
"Stop!" cried Smith, "I am satisfied: you
seem to be up to trap. Now hear me ;-a robbery
is not necessary at present-I mean a direct
robbery--nothing in the way of burglary or arson:
but there is some money to be made in the hill
ine, you understand me."

" I can't
say I do exactly," answered the other
"Then I must speak plainly :-if I had a good
bill I could get it cashed; -your father's, for
instance."
"But my father would not accept," said
Barnard.
"But can't you accept for him ?" said Smith;
"where's the mighty trouble of writing your father's
name across a stamp ?"
"But that's forgery !" exclaimed Barnard.
"Forgery-nonsense !" cried Smith; "just now
you would not stickle at a robbery, and yet
you prate of forgery. Forgery, indeed! do
you
think your father would hang you? I tell you,
BarnardI tell you, you must do this, or abandon
Hannah to your friend Whitehead."'
Enough," said Barnard ; "it is done."
" But," resumed Smith, "we want a thousand
pounds, at least : this is too large a sum to draw
on your father alone for ;-we could not so easily
ngociate the bill. Has your father no friend
whose name you think you might use with safety?"
Barnard paused a while, and replied, "Yes ;
there is Mr. Roper, the banker of Chelmsford,
he is a friend of my father."
"He'll do," said Smith; "and now come home
to my lodging, and we'll draw the bills."
They went accordingly, and drew two bills, one
on oid Barnard for 460, the other on the banker
for 540, and, by an ingenious turn of humour,

suggested by Smith, they made the banker the
drawer on old Barnard, and old Barnard the
drawer on the banker.
"Now," said Smith, "how are we to get these
bills cashed ?"
Why," replied Barnard, "I thought you could
do that."
Why, so I can," said Smith;
said Smith; "but the
person who would do them for me is out of town,
and yo must wait three days for his return :
that's a long time, you know, for poor Hannah to
be immured in that horrible spunging house.
Don't you know any one who would do them im.
mediately ?"
"Yes," said Barnard, "I know two salesmen
who, I think, would cash the bills, as they know
me and know the parties."
"Let us be off to them directly," said Smith.
Not to tire the reader by minuter details, Bar-
nard succeeded in getting the bills cashed. He
returned in high spirits to Hannah, got from her
the address of Mr. Whitehead, and went there
with Smith to pay the debt.
They found that gentleman, after some difficulty,
in a small obscure court in the neighbourhood of
Fetter Lane. Having clambered up a narrow
staircase in a shabby looking house, they knocked
at a door on the second floor, to which they had
been directed, and a gruff voice cried out, "Come
in."
The room was small and dark; and, seated

at a table covered with papers, they saw ap-
parently a very old man, with a profusion of white
hair as coarse as a goat's beard, goggles on his
eyes, and a large loose dressing gown of grey
cloth upon his body. When Barnard saw him,
he recollected his own jealousy, and could
scarcely refrain from laughing aloud.
"A pretty rival!" whispered Smith to him.
"We have come," continued he, aloud, "Mr.
Whitehead, to pay the debt for which you
have
arrested Mrs. Woods."
" 'Tis well," grumbled Whitehead, in a voice of
extraordinary harshness; "I'll take the money,
and write a receipt."
Smith then handed over the money, which
Whitehead reckoned with great care and delibe-
-ation, and then wrote a receipt.
Now," said he, "gentlemen, here is my bill
of costs, for I am an attorney as well as an ac-
countant, and conduct my own actions ;-the
amount is 15 78. 6d., which, if you will please
I will write an order for the discharge of
the prisoner."
There was no help for this, and Barnard, who
knew no better, paid this shameful bill, and re-
ceived the order
"Now," said Smith, "Mr. Pendinger, let me
give you a parting word of advice :-confine your
attentions for the future to your parchments, and
do not meddle with the ladies. Believe me, you
are much better adapted to make an im-
to pay,

woman.
" Let me recommend you, young man," rejoined
Whitehead, " to mind your own business."
" Sir !" said Barnard, getting enraged ; your

" Stop," said Smith, putting his hand on his
companion's mouth; "recollect that you are in
the house of an attorney : he'll have an action of
assault and battery against you before you can
say trap-sticks.Come along."
And who, gentle reader, do you imagine was
Mr. Whitehead, public accountant and soi-disant
attorney ?-Why, no one else but that ac-
complished actor who so successfully had
personated Don Josiah Xiutototle, viz.--the one-
eyed gentleman.
Barnard and Smith now repaired
now repaired to the
spunging-house, and conducted Hannah home in
triumph ; not, however, without first discharging
one of those very moderate bills usually con-
sequent on a short residence in any of those
hotels of cheap and temporary accommodation.
It was late in the evening when they arrived,
and Barnard ordered in a splendid supper from
the nearest tavern, and plenty of champagne.
Captain Creed was of course sent for to partake
in the general rejoicing. He and Smith were
loud in their encomiums of Barnard's generous
and noble conduct; and as for Hannah, her
gratitude and pathos were inexpressible. She

gave
Barnard
many a fatal, languishing, side-long
look of love, while the champagne went briskly
round, and Smith and Creed, with no mean taste
and execution, were singing the duet of "Drink
to me only." Barnard drank deeply both of
champagne and love, and was as happy as
Alexander when the lovely Thais sat beside
him; and though it would be profane to compare
Captain Creed with Timotheus, yet, as he sung
"Is there a heart that never loved ?" his in-
fluence over the enamoured youth was not less
complete than that of the mighty master of the
lyre over the unconquered hero of Macedon.
And, after all, if we could forget the means by
which such moments of pleasure are procured,
we would pronounce them worth all the rest of
existence: compared with such a present, the past
and the future are but tedious, lifeless blanks. We
do not mean to justify the conduct of Barnard,
but, perhaps, there are few of us that would not
have sunk, for a time at least, in the delicious
illusions in which he was immersed. Life is such
a choice of evils, such a perpetual alternation
between ennui and vexation, that to seize with
avidity on the fleeting bliss which so rarely pre-
sents itself, is natural and excusable in man: but
it is the stern decree of fate and nature, that such
enjoyments must be purchased at the price of
honour, and followed by the penalty of remorse.
Man finds out, too late, that the pursuit of pleasure
ends but in pain; and that terrestrial happiness

has not been the object of his existence. This
reflection may escape him in the hey-day of
youth, and the full tide of prosperity; but time,
a monitor that must be heard, will not fail to
inform him of the fatal truth. He whose prime of
life is consumed in pleasure, must expect neither
comfort nor respect in his latter years, and will
descend to the grave without a name remaining
amongst men.

It is almost superfluous to state, that, in spite
of the supplies so nefariously raised by William
Barnard at the expense of his too credulous
father, embarrassment succeeded embarrassment;
and he was daily, hourly, plunged into fresh
difficulties. To meet these, he could not again
venture, for the present at least, on the means
which had hitherto been attended with success.
He was fearful of rousing at once the suspicions
of the old man, of wearing him out by reiterated
experiments, and of entirely cutting off all chance
of any future resources from the same quarter.
The reader, on adverting to our description of
this youth's career, as far as it has gone, will
perceive that he commenced by being a perfect
dupe. He was not, 'however, the dupe of the

385
unsuspecting simplicity of a' mind naturally in-
genuous, but of his own ignorance and inexperience,
united with headstrong passions, and a native
propensity to vicious pleasures, but feebly coun-
teracted by any moral sense, and uncorrected by
education. He then became partly a dupe, and
partly a rogue ;he deceived others, only to be
himself deceived by his associates. To the
latter he had now almost ceased to become a
desirable object of prey; but his taste for vice,
and aptitude for villany, began to render him an
eligible co-partner. In short, he had now
arrived at the conclusion indicated by the French
proverbs which we have once quoted, and finished
by being a thorough " fripon."
Under the auspices of Beauty and the Captain,
he now began to get a good insight into the arts
of sharping and swindling. By these he con-
trived to keep, as the vulgar saying is, his head a
little above water; but the sums he gained in
this manner were altogether insufficient for his
purposes. His cheating was of necessity upon too
small a scale to minister to his own numerous and
factitious wants, and still less to support the ex-
pensive profligacy of Hannah. Avarice, and an
unbounded passion for luxury, were the pre-
dominant propensities of this dangerous woman.
No Eastern sultana could be more insatiable in
her thirst for splendour and voluptuous enjoy-
ment: nothing would satisfy her but the most
expensive diesses, the most exquisite viands, and
3 D

the richest wines. Every day she appeared in
some new costume-each more magniticent than
the last. Her toilet might have rivalled, in ex-
pense and research, that of Agrippina or Cleo-
patra: it was spread with a profusion of cosmetic
preparations, many of them the costly products of
other climates. Expensive vases of cut glass, of
porcelain, of silver, and even of gold, were there :
cabinets of cedar and mahogany, tastefully inlaid,
stood around. All the furniture was of the most
elegant description, and the atmosphere of the
chamber itself was redolent of perfumes.
But though Hannah delighted in all these
luxuries, yet such was her avarice, that she
would expend upon them as little as possible out
of her own private purse: she preferred, as long
as she could do it, making her paramour provide
for wants of this kind. Nor must the reader, for a
moment, imagine that her fidelity to Barnard
was such as to prevent her raising contributions
from occasional admirers. Quite the reverse,-
she was almost every night at theatres and other
public places, where she made many a private and
profitable assignation. The rich and the old of
our sex were the chief objects of her attention;
and while she had the art to manage her intrigues,
without exciting the suspicion of Barnard, he
proved a most convenient cloak for her character
in the deceptions she was practising on other men.
Hannah was utterly incapable of the sentiment
of love. For Barnard she cared nothing, or for

THE RED BARN,
387
any other man with whom mercenary motives led
her to cultivate an acquaintance : but she in-
herited the tropical constitution of her mother,
and that large portion of the animal which in-
variably accompanies the slightest infusion of
Ethiopian blood. In sensual passion she was
scarcely inferior to Messalina herself: she, there-
fore, was not without her secret favourites, whose
herculean proportions constituted a more powerfu?
recommendation, than the elegance of their persons
minds, or manners.
Meanwhile, Barnard dreamed of nothing of the
kind, but thought she was as exclusively his, as he
was hers.
The influence which she possessed
over him increased daily, and his appetite seemed
to grow by what it fed on. He was under the
fascination of a basilisk's eye,
"Beneath whose beauteous beams, belying hear'n,
Lurk searchless cunning, cruelty and death 
And still false warbling in his cheated ear,
Her siren-voice, enchanting, draws him on
To guileful shores and meads of fatal joy."
Barnard, as an additional mode of recruiting
his finances, began to study military tactics,
under the auspices of that experienced officer,
Captain Creed, and made such rapid progress, that
his instructor appointed him to the command of
the Western division of the Scarafooka Rangers.
We may as well, at once, fully explain to our
readers the organization and constitution of this
celebrated corps, at whose existence we have

hitherto but obscurely hinted. The idea of its
institution was not altogether original with the
Captain, inasmuch as gangs and knots of thieves
and pickpockets have fourished from time im-
memorial : but it must be confessed that it re-
ceived great improvement and developement from
his fertile genius. He began by organizing a
small band of depredators, all of them boys under
the age of fourteen : of these he constituted him-
self the captain and patron. To him the young
heroes brought all their boot
which he, through
certain channels, soon disposed of,-paying his
troops a stipulated sum, and reserving to himself
a reasonable overplus. He kept these youths in
their allegiance, by holding the law over thm
in terrorem : and they were prevented from ap-
propriating any thing of consequence out of their
plunder, by the difficulty of disposing of it; for,
in consequence of an understanding with the
Captain, none of the regular dealers would receive
anything from his troop, except through his own
hands, and the attempt to get rid of it elsewhere
would be attended with danger. In consequence
of this, though some trifling article might oc-
casionally be secreted, everything of material
value was duly delivered into the Captain's
keeping
The Scarafooka Rangers, at first few in
number, gradually increased under the energetic
and skilful exertions of their accomplished leader.
They, at last, became sufficiently numerous to be

formed into divisions, which were nominated from
the quarter of the metropolis especially devoted
to the peculiar operations of each. Each of these
divisions was superintended by a lieutenant ap-
pointed by the Captain himself, and who was
obliged to make regular weekly reports at head
quarters. Barnard had now the honour of com-
manding the largest and best disciplined division
of the Scarafookas, whose range of action ex-
tended from Temple Bar westward, as far as the
House of Commons in one direction, and the end
of Piccadilly in the other, including Covent
Garden and the Haymarket.
Our new-made lieutenant was actively em-
ployed in his first campaign, the fatigues of which
were agreeably alternated with the recreations of
love and wine, when a visitor arrived in town,
whose presence he least expected and least
desired. This visitor was no more or less a
personage than his own father. The fact was, that
the old man had begun to suspect his son's rectitude:
he was roused out of his long slumber of credulity
very suddenly, and rather unpleasantly, by that
most unceremonious of proceedingsan arrest. The
reader
may remember that previously to Barnard's
coming to London, in his last conversation with
Hannah in the country, he had presented her with
a 20 note, which he took out of a sealed letter.
This letter and its contents had been confided to
him by his father, to deliver to a person to whom
the money was due. This person, not receiving his

debt at the expected time, and being a very great
rogue, and in league with a still greater rogue, an
attorney, into whose hands he was constantly
playing, instead of applying for his money, had
old Barnard arrested, that he might put costs into
his friend's pocket. This, however, led to an
eclaircissement which opened the father's eyes
a little to the conduct and character of the son,
and induced him to come up to London, that he
might have a personal opportunity of inspecting
into his proceedings.
When a person, naturally credulous, is once
undeceived, the progress of his suspicions is
generally very rapid. Old Barnard began now
to think that it was not at all improbable that
William had been carrying on a regular system
of hoaxing since he left the country. Impressed
with this idea, he determined, before he saw his
son, to make inquiries relative to the firm of
Xiutototle and Killganders. The success with
which such inquiries were attended, the reader
may well surmise : old Barnard could find no
traces whatever of this respectable firm, at the
address which was attached to his acknowledy-
ment for 1700. On mentioning the business,
however, to an acquaintance of his, a salesman,
who had a very intimate knowledge of all City
affairs, the latter put him in possession of the true
state of the case-giving him the history of the
rise, progress, decline, and evaporation, of Xiuto-
totle and Killyanders.
He also stated the pre

cise period of their disappearance, which, on
comparing dates, was foand to be exactly a
fortnight prior to his son's transmission of their
acknowledgment. Mr. Barnard's friend also put
him in the way of finding out his son's address,
by taking him to the porter of the "Blue Boar,"
at which house he knew the young spendthrift had
set up. Half a crown, and the expense of a
coach, soon opened the way to the address of the
youth ; whither arrived, he prepared to over-
wbelm him with reproaches, and give him what
is called in the bowers of Academus a thorough
Jobation.
When he arrived at the house, he knocked at
the door, which was opened by a very spruce
young lady, dressed in the very first style of
London waiting-maidishness : he inquired for
juvenile Barnard, and was shown up stairs. On
his entrance, a scene presented itself well calcu-
lated to astonish the weak mind of the venerable
clodhopper.
It was eight in the evening, and young Bar-
nard was seated with Creed, Smith, Hannah,
and the one-eyed gentleman, at a table which was
covered with wine, fruit, and confectionary. The
quintetto were engaged in deep carousing, and
Barnard was in a pretty far advanced stage of intox-
ication. He was sitting next Hannah, with one
arm round her neck, and the other holding a full
bumper, and was singing, or rather roaring, with
windpipe most dissonant, " Life let us cherish ;"

THE RED BARN.
a volunteer solo: Smith, Creed, and their one-eyed
friend, were amusing themselves by vying with
each other to see who would make the most
expressive grimaces, in which, though the exertions
of the two former were highly praiseworthy, they
were left at an immeasurable distance by him of
the deficient optic. The distortions of this fellow's
countenance were so ludicrously horrible, that
they would almost have bid defiance to the art of
caricature to represent. While the guests were
thus employed, there was in the back ground, at
a sideboard, a servant boy taking advantage of
their abstraction, and guzzling down a bottle of
wine with the most rapid desperation.
When old Barnard entered, he stood astounded
at the scene before him. He was not, however, ,
suffered to stand quietly very long; for, instantly
on his entrance, two large and ferocious dogs,
belonging to Creed, flew at him, and seizing him
by the skirts of the coat, one on each side, held
him fast, until summoned away by the voice of
their surprised master. The party were not less
astounded at old Barnard's appearance, than he
was at the predicament in which he found
them. Young Barnard came to a full stop in his
obstreperous song; the three grimacers resumed
their natural perversion of countenance; and the
frighted boy, who had been guzzling down the
wine, let the bottle fall in his amazement, which
was dashed to pieces on the floor. For some time,
none of them could find their tongues, even

At last yourg
Ilannah was confused and silent.
Barnard contrived to stammer out,
"My father!"
Yes, William," said the old man, " it is your
fathercome in time to find you, as he expected,
destroying his property in drunkenness, (looking
at the wine), in lewdness, (casting a glance on
Hannah), and in gaming, (fixing his eye on a little
table in a corner, on which were three or four
packs of cards and a dice box or two)."
Why, father," replied Barnard, who was still
a little sheepish, where's the harm of a little
amusement ?-I attend to business in the morning."
"You do," cried the sire; "you attend to the
business of cheating and imposing on your poor
old father."
" How ?" said Barnard.
Thus, sirrah," replied the old man," by putting
into his hands securities like these, to induce him
to part with his propertythe acknowledgments
of fraudulent and run-away bankrupts."
"I was myself deceived there," said the son.
"You were not, sir;-you knew, at the time you
sent me the acknowledgment, that the scoundrels
were gone. Nay, sir, no further paltering1
have learned every tittle of the business since I
came to town :-besides, sir, where is the twenty
pounds I gave you in a letter to deliver to Biggs?"
" iJe has it, I suppose," answered Barnard.
" He has," said the old man, "but not the

twenty pounds I trusted to you. Look here, sr,
here is his receipt for the money,here is the
hill and receipt of the rascally attornev he em-
ployed to arrest me."
Young Barnard was dumb-founded, and could
not reply. The father resumed, -
"You are right to be silentyou cannot defend
yourself: the money you got by the cattle, the
corn, and the horses, you need not speak about,
--I see the road it has travelled, and I would not
believe a word you could say. William! William!
you have cruelly deceived me, and I shall never
trust you again : but still, bad as you are, you
are my son; and if you return with me to the
country, leave off your wickedness, and promise
to live quietly for the time to come, I will receive
you and support you : but I will entrust you with
no more money while I live; and when I die, I
will leave you sufficient for your maintenance in
he country, but no more."
William Barnard had, by this time, recovered
from his confusion, and his natural frontless
audacity returned, assisted by the wine that he
had been drinking. He saw, after what had
passed, that he had no chance of duping his
father any more. The kind of life that the latter
had proposed to him was by no means to his taste:
he was too deadly immersed in vice and crime,
too much the abject slave of passion and bad
habits, to dream of returning to anything like
## p. 395 (#421) ############################################
THE RED BARN
395
a virtuous path. In short, he was become a
thorough reprobate, and now, flinging off all dis-
guise, as he found there would be no further use
for it, he answered in his true character.
"Old gentleman," said he, looking at his
father with matchless impudence of face, and
then filling a bumper of wine, "I have the pleasure
of drinking your very good health. I am very
much obliged to you for your kind offer ; but, I
thank you, I have no taste for a country life ;-
I'll stay here, if you please."
Stay here !" exclaimed his father ;  and how
will you support yourself ?"
Oh! don't trouble yourself about that, my
good sir," said the dutiful youth ; "I shall get on
very well."
Ungrateful boy! is this the return you make
for all my kindness? Alas ! I have been far too
indulgent a father to you. You are bent, I see,
on a life of wickedness, which will end in misery,
and you will repent when it is too late."
"Well," said Barnard, "you may talk as you
please, I shall live as I please. I am too old to
be lectured, and I shall do just as I like; so I
advise you to return to the country, and not to
bother yourself any more about me ;-every one is
the best judge of his own business."
Very good advice," cried Beauty, who, with
the rest, had been hitherto silent; "and I recom-
mend you to follow it, old gentleman."
Hab, sir !" replied old Barnard, "is that vou?
## p. 396 (#422) ############################################
396
THE RED BARN.
I have heard of you also; your character is not
quite unknown to me: you have been the means
of corrupting and seducing my son."
"I advise you, my old buck," said Smith, "to
keep a civil tongue in your head ;-you will get
no good by brawling here, I can tell you."
"I have nothing further to say to you, sir," re-
joined the old man ; "but between you and me,
Captain Creed, there is an account to settle.
Yours and Mr. Jackson's bills are now due, and I
trust they will be settled."
" Have you the bills in your own possession,
Mr. Barnard ?" asked the Captain.
"I have," replied old Barnard ; "I did not
pass them."
** If you have them about you," said the Captain,
" I'll pay you now."And he pulled out a hand-
ful of bank-notes.
The old man, attracted by the sight of the
money, pulled out his pocket-book, and said,
" Here they are."
"Let me see them," said Creed, putting on his
spectacles.
The old man's suspicions were too strong now,
regarding all his son's companions, to let the bills
out of his own hand.
"Sir," said Creed, "I see you are afraid to
entrust me with the bills; but you wrong me
much, I am ready to pay both my own and
Mr. Jackson's."
So saying, he reckoned out notes to tne amount
## p. 397 (#423) ############################################
THE RED BARN,
397
of 178. He put into old Barnard's hands five
twenties, seven tens, a five, and three sovereigns.
"Now," said he," Mr. Barnard, here's the
money, and I'll trouble you for the bills."
The old man took the money, reckoned it
rapidly, and delivered the bills.
"Captain Creed," said he, " I thank you ;-you,
I see, are a man of honour, and I wish
you
would
use your influence to persuade this wretched boy
to return home."
"I never meddle in family affairs, Mr. Barnard,"
was the short and cool reply of the Captain.
" Father," said Barnard, "all that you, or
Captain Creed, or anybody can say, is perfectly
useless : I have determined to remain in London,
and to attempt to alter my determination is preach-
ing to the wind. And now that you have got
your money from the Captain, I think you have
nothing more to detain you here."
" Undutiful boy!" replied his father; " how am
I to get the money you have robbed me of, and
the value of the property out of which you have
cheated me ?"
"That's your business, not mine," answered
the youth, with the most imperturbable coin-
posure; " get it how you can; perhaps I inay
pay when it is quite convenient; perhaps not:
but for the present, I think you're only wasting
your time here."
" Unnatural son," cried the old man, deeply
affected by this callous levity, "I ought to curse

you, but I will not yet. For this time I leave
you. Hardened as you are, you may yet repent,
when poverty and wretchedness shall overtake
you.
You will then be abandoned by your pro-
ftigate associates, and you may think, perhaps, of
your unfortunate father." So saying, the old man
withdrew.
We may here remark, that a very material altera-
tion had been gradually taking place for some
months in the character of young Barnard. Perhaps,
however, we ought rather to say, that it was his
natural character which was now coming out,
but the developement of which had hitherto been
retarded by nothing but his rustic inexperience
and that awkwardness and "mauvaise honte,"
which a newness to society must produce, more
or less, in all. But nature had endowed him with
flinty nerves, and the most deternined obstinacy
of disposition. We have seen, it is true, some
traces of feeling about him, on his return from
his former visit to London, and in his intercourse
with Maria ; but the sources of such feelings
were purely selfish, arising from regret for his
losses, and the desire of physical gratification.
But his latter campaign in London had nearly
obliterated all the little sensibility he once pos-
sessed ;-it had lent him a firmer determination
in the courses of villany, and a reckless com-
posure respecting the consequences of his crimes.
Against these he would, to be sure, make such
provision as he could; but in case of failure,

THE BED BARN.
399
he had disciplined his mind to meet the result
with a cool intrepidity worthy of a better man.
This was the cause of that impudent and unfeeling
levity which he displayed in the meeting which
we have just recorded with his father.
Even Smith himself, with all his cool rascality,
could not entirely sympathize with the conduct
which Barnard had displayed on this occasion.
Still less could Creed do so. Regardless as he
was of the rights of property, and the principles
of integrity, he was not without touches of
humanity and natural affection. He had children
himself, whom he fondly loved, and for whose
sake, perhaps, partly, he continued to persevere
in his swindling and thievish pursuits; of friend-
ship, too, we have already seen that his heart
was far from unsusceptible. He was, in fact, one
of those mixed characters of which nature com-
poses the majority of men ; and we rarely find
that persons possessing the talent and the relish for
humour that belonged to Creed, are wholly
devoid of sensibility. He could not look on this
parade of unfilial conduct with an approving eye.
He therefore remained silent, as did also Smith.
But there was another silent spectator of this
scene, on whom it operated very differently : that
spectator was Hannah. She was far from being
in the least shocked by Barnard's behaviour as a
son, but she was employed in calculating whether
now, as all hopes of future finance from his father
seemed to be cut off, it would not be prudent in

her to desert him. The result of this calculati
was, that she determined to persevere in the
connexion, as long as it promised hopes of gain
from any quarter.
"Well," said Barnard, "I think, my lads,
I have dispatched the old fellow nicely:-what
say you ?"
Creed and Smith were silent, but the one-eyed
gentleman resumed, -
Yes, Mr. Barnard, it must be owned that
you enact the dutiful son in good style."
" I'll be hang'd if I care whether I do or not,"
rejoined Barnard.
"Did you ever read the story of Tommy and
Harry ?" said the one-eyed gent.
" Don't tell us about such nursery nonsense,
said Barnard : " but I say, my lads, what are we
to do to-night ?"
"The first thing I advise you to do," said
Creed, "is instantly to change your lodgings."
Why so ?" asked Barnard.
"Because," said Creed, " you have everything
to fear from the irritation of your father. He
may have you taken up to Bow-street, I can tell
you, if he pleases; and you may be certain that
he will look in here again, more especially when
he finds out the manner in which his bills have
been paid."
Aye," observed Beauty," how did you
manage that business ?"
" Time will tell," replied Creed
" A word to

the wise ; but be that as it may, I strongly advise
Barnard to decamp,and that without beat of
drum."
"I am entirely of your opinion," said Smith.
" Then," replied Barnard, " I am off directly;
but I must have your help to move off everything;
and where shall I
go
?"
"I have a house at your service," said Creed,
" at the other side of the water, so situated that
I would defy Old Nick himself to find you out,
if it were not that he is so constant an atten-
dant on your lordship."
" Thank you for that," said Barnard; "but
let us go to work."
"We must manage matters cautiously," said
Creed, "not to excite suspicion in the neighbour-
hood. The best way will be for each of us to go
out separately, at different times;-one can take
a coach, another walk; and, with the help of the
boy and girl (whom you know we can trust),
we'll soon leave an empty house ; which, as all
the world knows, is better than a bad tenant."
" The furniture !" cried Hannah ; "how can
we move that ?-and what can we do without it?"
" Make yourself easy about that," said Creed :
"allow me to direct the line of operationsI am
privileged to do so, from my experience in military
tactics. There is plenty of furniture for you
in my house; therefore we'll sell yours. Go
you, Smith, to our friend in Long Acre,-he'll
down with the dust directy; and he can leave

some one here until morning, and then remove the
furniture. Hannah shall pack up all her's and
Barnard's moveables, and take a coach to the
Golden Cross, where she can manage to change
coaches, and proceed to our destination. The rest
of us can easily carry off all that will not fit in
the coach."
To business these worthies went immediately:
the affair of the furniture was soon managed
Hannah then took coach, and was off with the
best part of the other goods. The rest then
departed, including their trusty servants,-one
of whom had held a distinguished rank in the
Scarafookas, and the other had been an inmate of
another description of establishment, rented by
the noble Captain in a different quarter of the
town. The broker's man was left in the house,
who, at a very early hour, removed the furniture,
and flung the key over the garden-wall.
When old Barnard arose next morning, after a
night of no small mental agitation, he called for
his bill at the inn where he was stopping. On
the bill being brought, he presented the waiter
with a five pound note to change. The latter was
absent for some time, and the old man, getting
impatient, rung the bell. Instead of the waiter,
the landlord made his appearance with a face of
the most profound gravity.
"Where's my change, landlord ?" said old
Barnard
"If I were not convinced sir," replied the

TIE RED BARN.
landlord (who was a very discreet and civil
man), of your respectability, I should be inclinea
to think that you meant to cheat me; but, sir,
you must either intend a joke, or there is some
very serious mistake here."
"Why, what's the matter, landlord ?" replied
the old farmer : "joke! I can assure you I never
had less cause to be merry
in
my
life."
"This is the note you gave my waiter,-look at
it, and read it, sir, if you please."
Old Barnard took the note : and to his utter
astonishment, read as follows.
5.
BANK OFF ENGLAND.
I promise to pay the Bearer on demand, the
Sum of Five Pounds of Chaff, sterling value
received.
HEN. HASE.
Fibe pounds
The style, &c. of a bank-note was exactly
imitated, and several names were scrawled on
the front and back of the note.
The old man turned to his pocket-book, in the
utmost trepidation, and soon found that all the
notes he had received from Creed were precisely
of the same description. This led him to examine
the sovereigns, which he soon perceived were
nothing but gilt counters, and which, by the
way, came from the flash exchequer of Xiuto-
totle and Co.
Old Barnard communicated the whole affair to

TIIE RED BARN.
the landlord, who advised him by all means to
apply at Bow Street for relief. But the old man
who considered that he could not do so withou
involving his son, and whom his weak good
nature still induced him to spare, rejected this
sensible advice. He contented himself with going
to the place where he had been swindled, in the
illusive hope of seeing some of the parties. When
he arrived there, he found, of course, that all the
birds had flown,--and there was a bill in large
.etters on the window-This House TO LET.
INQUIRE OF MR. SPRUCE, AUCTIONEER, HACK-
NEY. This bill had been written and stuck up
by Beauty previously to his departure.
The old man returned; and being prevented by
the salutary counsel of the landlord from wasting
his time in a wild-goose chase after Mr. Spruce,
who, it is needless to say, was what the school-
men would term a nonentity, set out for Polstead
that evening.
The son continued his course of abject de-
pravity, recklessness, and dissipation ; still con-
triving, however, to raise the wind pretty well,
and to minister to the profligacy of Hannah, by
his copartnership with Smith and Creed. The
two latter were now quite above board with
Barnard,-neither attempting to impose upon him
any longer, nor to conceal a tittle of their nefarious

instructors in the art of duping, and far exceeded

ne had been himself originally imposed on-and
how Jackson lived by smuggling, and raising the
wind in many other modes similar to their own.
Even the affair of Xiutototle came out in the
following manner :-
One evening, Creed, the one-eyed personage,
and Smith, were sitting together at the lodgings of
the latter over a bottle of wine. Barnard suddenly
came in, and said,
"Well, my lads, who do you think I have just
seen ?"
" Whom?" asked Smith.
Why, that cheat Killganders," said Barnard:
"he was coming down the next street; and I am
si!ro the villain saw me, for he turned back and
was off like lightning."
At this the three others set up a shout ou
laughter.
" What are you laughing at ?" cried Barnard.
"Would you like to see his partner ?" said
Snith.
"Aye, that I should !" cried Barnard.
" Behold him then!" said the one-eyed gen
tleman.
"Where?" inquired Barnard
"Here," replied the other; "I am his partner,
--was, I should say, rather,the late Don Josiah
Xiutototle."
"You !" exclaimed Barnard; "how can that
be ?"
The entire hoax was then explained, much to
## p. 406 (#432) ############################################
406

Barnard's astonishment, and not at all to his
gratification. He laughed at it, to be sure, and
pretended to treat the matter lightly; but it made
a very deep impression on his dark and remorse-
less mind.
"We tell you this now," said Smith, "as a
pledge of our future sincerity: you must think
rothing of it,-it is the mode in which we treat
all young hands at first. When we find them
good for anything, we undeceive them as we have
undeceived you ; but this is a sort of apprentice-
ship which all must undergo : I have undergone,
it myself,so don't think the worse of us or your-
self on this account."
"Oh! by no means," said Barnard ; "not al
all, I assure youI think nothing about it."
" Yes," observed Creed; "this is a noviciate
which all must serve : but when we find the novice
turn out a clever fellow, like yourself, we teach
hiin our trade, as we have taught you. Lastly,
we inform him of the trick which has been played
upon him; and when we find him take it with
the temper that you do, we conclude him to be
fit for anything."
Barnard was now a dupe to Hannah only.
He had no suspicion of her collusion in the cheats
which had been practised on him; for it may
be
well supposed that the one-eyed gentleman did
not inform him that he had played the part of
Whitehead with as much success as that of Xiu-
tototle. To her, therefore, he was stiii entirely

devoted : how long he was destined to remain so,
will appear by the sequel.
About this time, Jackson arrived in town.
Having passed the honeymoon with poor Maria in
the country, he brought her up to London, and took
lodgings at the West End. He had cajoled her
with a variety of plausible reasons why he should
not yet communicate with her parents; and he
had succeeded in rivetting the girl's attachment so
firmly, that she easily credited anything he said,
and was easily persuaded to any measure which
he counselled.
The place of rendezvous, between Jackson,
Smith, Creed, &c., was, as the reader will re-
member, the house in the neighbourhood of
Whitechapel, where we first had the honour of
introducing him to some of the leading characters
of this history. The private room there was the
secret divan, where the chiefs of the gang con-
nected with Jackson, both in smuggling and
swindling, were wont to assemble. It was pretty
generally visited nightly by Sinith or Creed, and
the one-eyed gentleman ; and latterly by William
Barnard, who, having taking all his degrees, was
now an acknowledged fellow of the society.
The quartetto in question were sitting in this
room in deep confab, at a very late hour in the
evening, and Smith had been just expressing his
surprise at having heard nothing from Jackson
lately, when the very man who was the subject
of discourse suddenly entered, accompanied bv

Warren. All appeared equally surprised and
pleased to see him. After a few questions and
replies, relative to the state of affairs, Smith
arose, and presented Barnard to Jackson with
much ceremony.
"Jackson," said he, "I had the honour of
first introducing Mr. Barnard to you : but I now
think it necessary to introduce him again, inasmuch
as he is not at all the same man that he was when
you first met him in this room ;-he was then a
novicea greenhorn : now he is as accomplished
a cove as any of us, and a worthy member of our
society:allow me now to present to you
Lieutenant Barnard, of the Scarafooka Rangers,
and a privy counsellor of our special cabinet."
Jackson fixed his eye for a moment on Barnard,
and replied,
"Had you not told me of this change, Smith, I
could have discovered it myself: his appearance
is enough,-determination and talent are written
on his countenance."
" In the first, at least," replied Barnard, "I
shall never be found wanting."
"I believe it," said Jackson.
" It must be owned," said Creed, in a low
whisper to Warren, " that he looks like a de-
termined villain. But," continued he, aloud,
"where have you left Ricketts, Jackson ?"
" He is still in charge of the goods in the cave."
"Don't you think," said Smith, "that it was
time that these goods were disposed off ?"

We
"Yes," said Jackson, "I have come to town
to arrange that affair with you all. From your
speaking so freely, I perceive that you have let
Mr. Barnard into the secret."
" Yes, yes!" answered Smith, "he is now one :
of us,-we have no secrets from him now.'
" 'Tis well," said Jackson; "and now, my
friends, I have something to mention to you.
shall have the goods up immediately, but it is
necessary that we should agree on the division oi
the profits."
"How !" said Smith, "surely that requires "no
consideration ; the profits must be equally divideu,
as they always have beenequal justice is oui
motto.'
" I am as great a friend," answered Jackson, " to
equal justice as you are; it is therefore that I
speak. An equal division, in the present instance,
would, I conceive, be anything but equal justice."
"What do you mean?" cried Smith; "how
can that be?"
"I'll tell you," replied Jackson : "the goods
in question have been placed in a predicament:
all has not gone on, in this instance, fairly an
smoothly, as heretofore. But for the exertions of
the brave fellows who were with me, we shouid
have had no goods to talk about; nor, perhaps,
have been here ourselves to talk about anything
else."
"And what of that?" said Smith.
" Thus much," replied Jackson; "that it

would be unjust indeed if those brave fellows
should have nothing extra for their important
services."
Oh !" exclaimed Smith, "I see how it is,
you want to come in for an extra allowance your-
self, Jackson."
"And supposing that I did," said Jackson,
coolly folding his arms, " who, let me ask you, has
a better right to it? Have I not been the whole
soul and life of your proceedings ?--Could you bave
done without me?"
"Could you have done without us, Mr. Jack-
son ?-answer me that," retorted Smith.
Yes," replied Jackson, "I could ; the world
is wide, and there are many men in it as brave
and as clever as yourself, to whom my services
would be acceptable. But you mistake me-I
want nothing additional for myself; however, I am
determined that my brave companions shall not
go unrewarded."
"And I am determined," said Smith, "that
we, and the rest of us, shall not be humbugged;
will not suffer it."
" Indeed!" said Jackson : " you are started
into mighty power all of a sudden; but, fortu-
nately, the thing does not depend on you,-it
will be decided by general consent. And I say
again, that I am determined my brave comrades
shall not go unrewarded "
"Reward them, then," said Smith, "out of
your private purse ; which, no doubt, is wel:

stocked, Mr. Jackson: but remember, you re-
ward them out of the profit of the goods at your
peril. I can tell you that "
What !" cried Jackson, looking fiercely at him;
"do you think to intimidate me? I have been
heard and obeyed by men, amongst whom you
would not have dared to lift your voice; and I can
tell you that you shall not bully me out of my
just intentions."
"There is a way of doing things," said Smith:
"all is not carried in this world by force."
" There are ways of doing things," responded
Jackson, "which cowards and traitors may em-
ploy, but which brave men detest and despise."
"Coward !" exclaimed Smith, rising from his
chair; " do you call me a coward ?"
"Not now," replied Jackson, coolly; "but I
shall call you a coward and a traitor, if you
deserve
it, as you seem disposed to do."
"You dare not for your life call me a coward,"
said Smith ; "you have not a tongue to do so."
"Away, vain boaster !" cried the other ;"I have
not only a tongue to call you a coward if you
deserve it, but an arm to chastise you as a ruffian."
Smith was now attempting to make his way
over to Jackson, when Creed and Warren seized
him by the arms, and forced him to sit down.
The former then said,
"Gentlemen, gentlemen ! this is very foolish
work-very foolish work indeed: if we quarrel
this way among ourselves, we shall be ruined

Union is our only strength, and our only chance
of success; and to see two of the foremost men
amongst us thus quarrelling, is grievous. For my
own part, I am inclined to coincide with the
opinion of our friend Jackson, and think that
something extra should be allowed to those who
have saved the goods : but let me recommend
that the subject be dropped for the present; and
when the goods are sold, let the money be divided
according to general consent. In the meantime,
don't let there be any quarrel between two such
old friends."
"You speak well, Creed," said Jackson ; "I
am contented with the measures you propose.

never meant to quarrel with Smith, but I am not
to be bullied by any man."
"I know that,
" said Creed; "nor did he
mean to bully you. It was only a difference of
opinion; and let me entreat you both to be friends,
and not ruin us by your divisions."
"With all my heart," said Jackson ; "I repeat
that I have no quarrel with him, but the threat
he held out -"
"I meant nothing by it," said Smith ; "it was
only in a moment of anger.
"There's my hand, then," replied Jackson.
Smith shook hands with him, and apparently
acquiesced in the reconciliation ; but the heart
went not with the hand, and rancour took a deep
seat within his bosom.
The party soon broke up, and, in going out,

413
Barrard and Smith took one direction, and Creed
and Jackson another. As the two last walked
along, Jackson observed, -
" I confess I did not think that Smith could have
behaved in the inanner he did to-night."
" Jackson," said the Captain, " you and I are
old friends : I should be sorry to see you wronged
or injured; and I can't help thinking that you run
some chance of being so."
Why do you think so ?" demanded Jackson.
"I have some insight," replied Creed, " into
human character, and some experience of its indi-
cations; and I am very much mistaken if Smith
means any good to you.
"He must be most ungrateful, then," cried
Stafford, "and a fool to boot ;-I have put more
money into his pocket than he could have ever
gained without me. To say nothing of other
matters, he could never have succeeded with
Barnard as he has; and, God knows, he has
gained more by that concern than I have."
As for his gratitude," said Creed, "I would
not calculate much on that: he is a man who
makes no distinction between friends and enemies,
when his interest is concerned."
" But it is not his interest to quarrel with me."
" If he thinks it is, that is all the same;the
prospect of an immediate gain is enough for
Smithhe is incapable of looking farther; neither
has he the feeling to observe fidelity, nor the
sense to perceive its necessity. Young Barnard,

as bad, or rather worse, than Smith : they are very
closely linked together at present, and neither of
them is to be trusted."
" As for Barnard," said Jackson, "I wonder
how you came to trust him: I should not be
surprised if he were actuated by feelings of revenge
against us all."
" Nor I," answered Creed; "but it was
Smith's doing, not mine. I would not willingly
have trusted him, but I was forced to concur.
Men of our profession, Stafford, are obliged to do
many things against our judgment as well as
our feelings, when we have any."
" Alas, Creed! you speak too truly," said Jack-
"Would that I had never adopted such
courses, or that I could dare to relinquish them
even now; but the die is cast, and I fear it is too
late to repent."
" Repentence," said Creed, "is folly,-it can-
not alter what has been done, and seldom can it
better the future ; for one false step in life in-
evitably leads to a thousand others. I, too,
could have wished myself a better pursuit, but it
is vain to think of that now; still, though to the
world we are otherwise, we may be men of
honour amongst ourselves: we are not all, I hope,
equally bad."
"I know it," replied Jackson ; " on your friend-
ship and fidelity, Creed, I know I can depend.".
"You can," said the Captain, " but not so on
Smith: trust me, he is a dangerous man."
" He may be so, but I fear him not."

very unfair."
" Still," said Creed, " beware of him."
Beauty and Barnard, instead of separating to
go each to his home, entered a convenient house
of accommodation, which was open to such as
they at all hours; and sitting down in a private
room together, called for some of their favourite
beverage, brandy and water Smith commenced
the conversation, and began to open his mind
a little freely to Barnard.
Well, William," said he, "what do you
think of Mr. Jackson's conduct this evening ?"
"Why," said Barnard, "I think his proposals

"Shamefully unfair!" ejaculated Smith.
"I see no reason," rejoined the other, "why
these fellows should have more than you."
"Or than you, William," added Beauty.
"As for me," said Barnard, "I don't know
that I can claim anything."
Oh, but I do," cried Smith; "you have as
much right as any of us, now."
"I think," said the other, "that Jackson
assumes a great deal."
"He does," responded Smith; "more than he
has any right to do: he would fain be lord and
master; but that he shall never be, in money
matters, while I live. He talked of being heard
and obeyed by better men than we.

He'll find he has to do with men as
sharp as himself."
"I own, I don't like his manners," said Bar-
nard; "he is too proud and imperious."
"I tell you, William," cried Smith, " you have
no cause to like himself or his manners;now hear
It was through him that you have been
created of your money.

fit. I own that I engaged in the thing, but I was
forced to do so : I was in fear of my life~for he

the first opportunity to compensate you : that
opportunity now offers ;-we can enrich ourselves,
revenge ourselves, and ruin him."
How?" said Barnard.
"The thing is easy," said Smith, " if you
will
only be firm, and faithful."
"Depend on me," answered the other.
"Do you know," said Smith, "that Jackson,
not contented with robbing you, has made you
the
subject of ridicule ?"
The deuce he has ?"
"He called you, in a letter to me,
in a letter to me, 'the young
clodhopper.'" A sardonic smile passed over the
features of Barnard.
"Do you wish to be revenged ?" added Smith,
"I desire nothing more."
" Do you wish to pull up your losses ten-
fold ?"

"No," interrupted Smith; "that would be
poor revenge, and we might pay the price of it
with our lives. I have a better plan, if you will
only join one in it."
"Name it at once," said Barnard.
"The goods," said Smith, "that we were
talking of, are now deposited in a cavern under a
little cottage of mine in the country. No one
unacquainted with the place could possibly find
them out. They are now under the care of one
inan, a fellow named Ricketts, who with an old
woman is the only tenant of the place at present."
" Then your plan is, that we should go down
together, murder Ricketts and the old woman, and
seize upon the goods."
"No," replied Smith ; "how fond you are of
murder! Ricketts is a perfect Sampson in point
of strength, and a devil in the way of despera-
tion. We could not both escape him ;--and even
if we succeeded, there are certain consequences
not so easily avoided."
Consequences are nothing, if the deed be
concealed," remarked Barnard.
"1f" rejoined Smith : " but, at all events,
we could not so well manage the removal and
disposal of the goods. We should be thwarted
and impeded there. My plan is safer and more
certain. You and I shall go down, give informa-
tion to the officers, and receive half the value o

We are
the goods as a reward for our services. Thus I
shall be put in funds, you will be compensated for
your losses, and we shall both be revenged of
Jackson. A warrant will be bad against him,
and he will either be taken or obliged to fly."
"Your hand upon it," said Barnard : "I am
your man.
" There is no time to be lost," said Smith.
"No," said Barnard; "we must be off with
the earliest coach."
" Earliest fudge !" rejoined Smith; we must

young and strong.-We can walk until daylight
and take advantage of the first quick conveyance
we meet. I know Jackson's vigilance too well;
-I am sure he suspects me ; and we must, there-
fore, anticipate his measures.'
The two heroes accordingly took immediately
to the road; and having walked until about six
next morning, found themselves at Colchester :
they then took a post-chaise, and arrived early
in the evening at Stoke, a town situated but a
short distance from Polstead, where they com-
menced operations with the revenue officers.
Smith, however, had done no more than jus-
tice to the promptitude of Jackson ;-quick as he
was himself, the other was still quicker. When
Creed and he parted, he returned immediately to
the public-house where Warren slept. He found
the latter in the act of undressing, and about 10

" Warren, my friend," said he, "you must dress
yourself again, and set off with me for Polstead
directly."
"For Polstead !" cried Warren, in astonish-
ment; "and at this hour?"
"Yes!" replied Jackson, we have not an
instant to lose. I am satisfied that Smith is a
traitor, and means to nose the goods. We must be
beforehand with him, and save them if we can.
It will be a business quite in your way, for I am
sure we shall not part without fighting."
" That is meat and drink to me," said Warren :
"d---n the fellow! I thought as much by his
dark looks. I don't like that pale-eyed younker
neither."
"I am disposed to think that they understand
each other," said Jackson.
"Well, we'll give them as good as they bring,"
cried Warren, huddling on his clothes; "but how
are we to be conveyed, my noble commander ?"
"I have two of the fleetest roadsters that ever
sniffed the wind, in the stable in the lane," replied
Jackson. "We'll ride as long as we can, and
then take post."
"Good !" exclaimed Warren, " though a
sailor, I can ride as well as your landsmen.Let's
be off."
They went to the stable, of which Jackson had
the key, saddled the horses, and were on the
road before Barnard and Beauty, and, conse-
quently, arrived sooner in Polstead.

When they came to the cottage, they deli-
berated as to what measures should be taken for
the security of the goods. Jackson was quite
decided that they should be moved. But where?
and when ?there was but another secret depot
in the country, which was near Ipswich; but
which was now rendered quite unsafe, by the
information which the officers had received, and
which led to the rencontre described in Jackson's
letter. As to the when, no removal could be
attempted until night.
Thus circumstanced, they formed the following
resolution, -viz. that Jackson and Warren should
carry off as much of the goods as possible that
night, to London : leaving Ricketts with the rest
until their return. In the interim they barricaded
the cottage, and remained under arms, to protect
their booty, in case of attack, as well as they
could.
That attack was nearer than they imagined, -
for Jackson, notwithstanding all his foresight and
proniptitude, had no idea that Smith was yet in
the country. His measures were merely precau-
tionary, and pursued under the influence of a
maxim by which he generally regulated his con-
duct, which was to leave as little to chance as
possible. In further pursuance of this maxim,
he made his companions secure on their persons

in that way, and did the like himself

and stormy. The trio were sitting in the cottage,
each of them armed with a blunderbuss, a cutlass,
and a case of pistols. They had left no appearance
of light, having nothing but a dark lantern :
they had even taken the precaution of extinguishing
the fire, though the weather was cold.
While they were thus prepared, a knock of a
very peculiar kind was made at the door. It was
the signal knock, known only to Jackson, Smith,
and Ricketts :- there could be no doubt of the
person who had given it.
No answer was given from within,--all was
hushed and dark, and silent as the grave.
.
The
signal knock was repeated three times with no
better effect.
A low voice from the outside then called,
Betty, Betty, open the door!"
The voice of Smith was recognized by all the
parties.
"Shall we give him one volley?" whispered
Warren to Jackson.
"No," replied he; "rascal as he is, I don't
want to kill him."
Th's was an impolitic clemency on the part of
Jacks"n; for, had they fired, they might, by means
of the darkness of the night, have deceived the
enemy as to their own numbers, and caused them
to retire. This, however, was but a chance, as the
revenue party outside were strong.
"My lads," said Smith, outside, "I see we

must break open the door. Hand me an iron
crow.
Of the iron crow, however, Smith had no oc-
casion to make use ; for he had scarcely uttered
the last words, when the door flew open, wonder-
ful to relate, apparently of its own accord.
The fact was, that Jackson, with all his judg-
ment and foresight, had made one capital error.
This was, in neglecting to dismiss or secure, in
some way, the old housekeeper. This woman was
alarmed for her own safety, and in the dark had
cautiously and silently withdrawn the bolts; and
she suddenly threw open the door, when Smith
called for the crow, and taking to her heels,
escaped.
" We are betrayed, Warren," exclaimed Jack-
son; " that infernal hag has opened the door.
Do you two escape out of the window, if you can,
and leave me here to my fate."
"Never," said Warren; " we'll stand by you
to the last."
"Hah, hah!" cried Smith; "come on, my lads!
-the ringleader himself is here. Now, Barnard,
is your time for revenge.'
Two men immediately rushed down the steps,
and entered the cottage. Jackson, who stood
foreniost in the passage, with the quickness of
lightning, laid them both prostrate at his feet.
"Follow me, my friends," cried he, running up
the steps ; " all we have for it, is to cut our way

423
through them as well as we can. First (whispered
ne) discharge your blunderbusses."
They did so, and wounded two of the other
party. The confusion created by this, and the
darkness, their own knowledge of the paths, and
the ignorance of the others respecting localities,
were all in their favour. They succeeded in
escaping, but the cottage and the booty became
the prize of their adversaries.
Having got to a considerable distance, and the
others being too busy and confused to pursue
them, and not knowing, indeed, what direction to
take through such an entangled country, our three
heroes halted and held a council of war. Short
and speedy were their resolutions. It was agreed
that Jackson should proceed immediately to
London, and get over to Ostend as quickly as
possible; while Warren and Ricketts should
make their nearest way to the coast, and find
some means of joining their associates on the
other side. All were provided with
valuables sufficient for their immediate purposes,
Jackson was now in a very serious predicament:
if discovered, taken, and identified as one who
had resisted the King's officers in the execution
of their duty, his fate would be by no means
doubtful. He threw away his cutlass, and re-
taining only his pistols, struck into a by-road,
by which he avoided Polstead, where it would
not bave been very prudent for him to have
ventured. He walked all night; and at the first
money and

market town he came to, secured a chaise and
proceeded to London.
The goods were now seized secundum artem;
and Barnard and Smith, having settled matters to
their satisfaction with the officers, resolved to
proceed to Polstead, as there was no accom-
modation in the cottage. The former had his
arm tied up, for he was one of the men struck
down by Jackson ; and, although not wounded,
his arm was considerably hurt.
It was a bleak tempestuous night, suitable for
deeds of darkness, and harmonizing well with the
heart which is abandoned to gloom, remorse, and
desolation. It was not a night for the innocent,
the gay, the happy, to be abroad : their place was
in the social circle or the brilliant assembly,
where wealth and luxury create a climate of their
own, and bid defiance to the warring elements
without; or on the downy couch, lulled in serene
slumber, and dreaming of cloudless skies and
verdant bowers, and ever-green islands of the
blest, crowned with eternal summer. But this
was a night for the children of sorrow, of crime,
and of despair. Not a glimpse of moonshine-
not a star appeared : volumes of black clouds,
surcharged with rain, filled the lower atmosphere,
and seemed occasionally to touch the earth, as
they were swept along before the south-east wind.
The storm howled in wild ravings; and a strong
and superstitious fancy might well deem that the
angel of desolation was abroad, wielding the

426
elements, and directing the blast, to visit with
Vengeance the offending children of men.
Smith and Barnard had proceeded some dis-
tance, when a lustrous flash of lightning, bursting
from the bosom of a livid cloud, overspread the
horizon with instantaneous light. It was followed
by a tremendous peal of thunder, reverberating
through the skies: the descending rain then
suddenly fell in an overwhelming torrent.
"This is a dreadful night, Smith," said Bar-
nard; "is there no place near where we can
shelter ?"
" Yes," replied Smith ; "a little to the right
there are the remains of an old ruined building."
Thither they instantly hied. What this building
might have been, is not very easy to decide : it was
of some antiquity, but of little note. At a dis-
tance it appeared nothing but a heap of stones
overgrown with moss. When you came nearer,
however, the remnants of three walls were very
perceptible, and it was easy to observe that they
had been solidly built. The two side walls were
very low; and the back one, which was higher,
stood against a hill, which afforded a shelter
from the east. There was no vestige of a regular
roof, but a sort of shed, rudely formed with
stakes, covered with sods, thrown across the back
part, extended a very little way down the sides :
it was sufficient, however, to afford a temporary
refuge from the storm. The floor of this place was
31

426
THE RED BARN
of a hardened clay; and, in fine weather, some of
the country lads were in the habit of repairing
hither to amuse themselves with a game of fives.
Barnard and Smith took shelter directly under
the back wall : the rain continued to come down
with tremendous violence. Neither of them were
much inclined to speak; for there is something in
such a night as I have described, that makes an
awful impression, however temporary, on the most
hardened minds.
They had been here but a few seconds, when
something very like a deep sigh, uttered by a
human being, was heard.
"Good God! what's that ?" exclaimed Barnard;
" did you hear nothing ?"
" Yes !" said Smith,
very plainly; there is
some one here besides ourselves: speak, or rul
fire."
"For heaven's sake don't murder me," cried a
female voice, in the most piteous tone.
"Murder you ?-no!" said Smith; "we don't
murder women. Speak,-who are you?"
"A wretched, unfortunate feniale, the victim of
falsehood and perjury: and O!" continued the
voice, and seeming to come nearer; "whoever you
are, take compassion on me."
Scarcely had she ceased to speak, when another
electric flash suddenly illumined all around, and
revealed to the eyes of the astonished Baruar,
Maria Marten!

427
" Maria !" exclaimed he.
" Hah!" said she, "I should know that voice
who are you?
" William Barnard," replied he ; " surely you
know me."
"Oh!cried Maria, "this is too much, that
you should be a witness of my shame and misery!"
" What, in the name of heaven, brings you
here?" cried Barnard. "Whence come you?-
whither are you going ?"
" To my grave," replied she ; "the only refuge
now left for the wretched Maria."

come, was not unmoved by her distress : he en-
treated her to explain the reason of her being in
such a situation. After much pressing she did so.
" I have been deceived and cruelly deserted,"
she answered. I have been married since I saw
you, William,at least, I thought so: I was
happy, for a time,-oh! how short a time." Here
her utterance was choked by a convulsion of grief.
" Married !" exclaimed Barnard; "to whom ?"
" No matter," said she, recovering; "to one
whom I--yes! I fondly, foolishly, loved him :
-oh! that he should treat me thus. Stafford !
Stafford ! I did not expect it from you." A flood
of tears came to her relief.
"Stafford !" ejaculated Barnard, " Stafford !--
do you mean Stafford Jackson ?"
" What !" said Maria ; "you know him, then!
Yes, in truth, it was he: I was married to him

here-in the little cottage under the hill. There
we remained for some time, when, about a week
ago, he took me up with him to London."
" And how came you to part ?" said Barnard.
"I know not,-it was his doing. I was
sitting alone one evening last week, in the
lodgings we occupied, expecting his return :-He
always came home very late: I heard a knock at the
door, and thought it was his. The landlady came up
and put a letter into my hand, which ran thus:
DEAR MARIA,
We must part,-ask not why, or wherefore.
You can return home, if you please,-I enclose
you the means of doing so. It is right I should
tell you we are not married ;-he who married us
was no clergyman. Farewell! I shall never see
you again.'
There was a note enclosed in the letter for fifty
pounds."
"And what did you then ?" said Barnard.
"I know nothing of what happened afterwards,
until the following morning : I fainted away, and
was,
I
suppose, carried to bed. Next morning,
the landlady came into my room before I was up,
and told me I must leave her house immediately
-that she had been mistaken in my character,
I must. I told her that I knew not where
She said it was no matter-I must leave
her house. I got up, dressed myself, and looked

for the note which had been enclosed by Jackson :
it was nowhere to be found. When I asked about
it, I received nothing but insult;
-Do you
take me,' said she, "for a thief?' It was very
kind of her to let me go without paying for my
week's lodging. In short, I was obliged to leave
the house immediately."
" And what could you have possibly done then?"
asked Barnard.
"I inquired my way towards the road which
led from London to Suffolk; and, after much
trouble, found out from whence the van departed
for Colchester: I got a seat in it as far as that
town, and the rest of the way I walked. I was
taking a cross road to reach Polstead, to go to my
cousin's, when the storm came on, and forced me
to take refuge here."
This tale made a deep impression on Barnard ;
and if he had feelings of revenge against Jackson
before, they were now doubly heightened. He
turned, and addressed himself to Smith.
Why," said he,"
you never told me anything
of thisdid you know of it?"
"Yes," said Smith, "I knew it all. I was with
Jackson when he first met this young lady, and I
have seen her more than once since; but I did
not think of mentioning it to you, because I was
not aware that you knew her."
"Oh, Mr. Smith !" said Maria," there
too ?but I have nothing to blame you
for."
"I hope not," answered Smith. " I am sure I

thought Jackson meant honourably; but you now
see, Barnard, what a rascal he is in everything."
" Who married them-or, rather, pretended to
marry them ?" demanded Barnard.
"When the affair was finished, I learnt that it
was Creed who acted the part of clergyman on
the occasion," replied Smith.
Barnard's astonishment at this information was
as great as Maria's, and both uttered ejaculations
expressive of their feelings.
"But Jackson is the real injurer," observed
Smith.
" He is, indeed, a scoundrel," said Barnard ,
"and, I trust, I shall be completely revenged on
him yet. But, Maria, you must go home
home; this
gentleman and myself will conduct you : the rain
is now abating."
" Alas !" said Maria, "I dread going home,
after what has passed. How can I face my poor
father and mother ?"
"Don't think of that, Maria," said Barnard ;
" what is done cannot be undone. After all, you
are little to blame : any girl might have been
deceived as you have been. Your parents will be
happy to receive you again : you must forget this
worthless villain.
Would that I could !" said Maria : " but I

sinking frame. After a while, they reached the
cottage, in which a light was still perceptible.
They knocked, and the door was opened by old
Marten.
"We bring you," said Barnard," your poor
daughter Maria.
The old man started back with astonishment;
which, however, very suddenly gave place to in-
dignation, and he exclaimed, on recognizing Bar-
nard,--
" Is it you, villain ? and have you the assurance
to bring me my daughter, after liaving ruined her?"
"You mistake, my good sir," replied Barnard ;
"I am no villain,- I have not seen your daughter
for several months, until to-night, when we met
by accident. But," continued he, looking at
Maria, who was deadly pale, and utterly unable
to speak; " you see the state she is in. Let her
be conducted to bed, and I will explain every-
thing to you."
The mother now made her appearance, and
uttered an incoherent exclamation of surprise and
reproach, at the appearance of her daughter, who
stood weeping and trembling before her.
"For God's sake," said Barnard, " don't speak
to her so : you see she cannot answer you--she
is fainting."
The mother then led Maria away, and Barnard
and Smith went into the parlour with old Marten.
The former told him all that he had heard from

Maria. ne father, lifting up his hands and eyes
exclaimed, when the tale was concluded,-
Oh, merciful God! my poor girl, then, is
ruined !"
" Never think so, sir," said Barnard : " she has
heen unfortunate and deceived; but, in heart, she
is as virtuous as ever."
But," said the old man, "her prospects are
blasted. What respectable man will ever mairy
her now ?"
" It need not be known," answered Barnard :
" besides, no respectable man could think the
worse of her, if he did know it. She believed
that she was lawfully married; therefore the
fault rests not on her."
Well, Mr. Barnard," said Marten, "you give
me comfort, and I thank you. I am very sorry
for what I said to you ;-you'll forgive a foolish
old man.'
"Don't mention it, my dear sir," said Barnard;
" but, in truth, you wronged me. I certainly once
had some thought of your daughter, but it was
in an honourable way;--circumstances put an
end to that. But this gentleman can bear me
witness, that this is the first day I have been out
of London for some months."
"That I certainly can," said Smith; "and,
moreover, I can bear testimony as to the real
seducer."
They now took their leave-Barnard recom-
mending the old man, by all means, to be gentle

with his daughter, and promising him to come and
see him again. Smith and he then went to
Polstead, and took up their quarters for the night
at the " Cock."
A few words of explanation, in addition to the
story of Maria, will serve to throw a complete
light on the very culpable eonduct of Jackson, in
this affair.
When he first formed his connexion with Maria,
he certainly did not intend to desert her. He
was not altogether so abandoned as to have con-
ceived a premeditation of this kind ;-nay, he even
fancied that the strength of his attachment was
such as would render him always faithful to her:
but he most widely miscalculated his own powers
of remaining constant. The fact is, that Jack-
son was, like the vast majority of hackneyed
libertines, utterly incapable of a steady attach-
ment to any one woman. It is not likely that the
most accomplished female could have succeeded
in rivetting his affection ; it was still less to be
expected that a country girl, like Maria, could
have done so. She was not like Cleopatra, whose
" infinite variety custom could not "stale."
Jackson had only regarded her with the eye of
appetite; and when that was gratified, there was
nothing mental to relieve the monotony of
domestication, or to keep up the delusion of the

utterly precludes the possibility of constancy to
an individual.
There was also another very peculiar trait in
the character of Jackson, which tended most
materially to influence his conduct in the instance
on which we are commenting. This was an out-
rageous hatred of the slighest shadow of anything
like personal restraint. He inherited from nature
a sort of savage love of unbounded freedom; and
this disposition had been trebly strengthened by
the vagrant habits of his life. In this respect, he
was a perfect Bedouin Arab; and would have
spurned from him with disdain, if he could, the
most ordinary loads of social life. He did so as
far as he was able : he was never so happy as
when he had no fixed place of abode; when, in
London, he was living in taverns, coffee-houses,
and gaming-houses; when he was flying about the
country on his swindling speculations; or scudding
with full sails before the blast as tumultuous as
himself, and over the waves, as restless and as
inconstant.
There is another point also necessary to notice,
which has much bearing on this question. Jack-
son's finances were beginning to get low,that
is, low in his own estimation, and in proportion
to his insatiable thirst of expensive pleasure: he,
therefore, began to find, or to fancy (which was
all the same), that Maria was both an actual in
cumbrance to him, and a serious impediment to
bis activity. The chain which he had himself

forged, and with which he had fottered his
freedom, began to gall him ; and he was now as
eager to get it off as he had been originally to put
In short, he very soon became tired of
Maria, but he had too much feeling to tell her so
bluntly. Several times was he on the point of
breaking to her the necessity of a separation, but
he lacked the power to do so: bis resolutions,
firmly fixed during her absence, were perfectly
disarmed by a simple smile, or some artless dis-
play of her affection, when she was present.
His mind was kept in a perpetual state of con-
tention, between the imperious passion for restored
freedom, and the sentiments of pity which he
cherished for her. He had resolved, at first, to
leave her behind him in the country. This,
certainly, would have been the wisest and fairest
way he could have acted, independently of
cherishing and protecting her: but she pressed
with such affectionate earnestness to accompany
him to town, that he could not refuse her. But
the same feelings, resulting from satiated appetite,
vagrant fancy, and the untameable impulse to
freedom and activity, pursued him to the metro-
polis, and at last determined his resolution :
still he could not muster sufficient cruelty to in-
flict the wound personally. He chose rather to
communicate bis determination by letter; and
the enclosure of the fifty pounds was, in his ideas,
quite a sufficient atonement for having destroyed
her reputation and peace of mind, and quite a
sufficient salvo to his own conscience.

THE RED BARN.
Much has been written on the fatal effects and
high criminality of seduction; but enough can
never be said against it. Putting out of the
question men of such loose habits and principles
as Jackson, there are many others who would be
shocked by a comparison with him, who yet think
very lightly of this most heinous sin. They con-
sider the deception of an innocent female, at
most, as nothing more than a very venial trans-
gression. But if the criminality of actions be at
all to be estimated by their consequences (and we
are not aware that there is any other more rational
mode of estimating it), seduction will be found
to rank very highly indeed on the list of human
offences. In the most favourable view of the case,
namely, when the seducer does not desert his
victim, still the consequences of seduction are far
from being innoxious. The woman is degraded
from the station which she previously held ; and
the loss of charater, and the weakening of moral
principles, must, unquesionably, exercise a
baneful influence on her general conduct. She
has learned, at all events, to consider chastity as
of little value; and a slight temptation is often
sufficient to render her faithless, even to her
generous seducer.
But this is, indeed, a very favourable view of
the case ; for, in ninety-nine instances out of a
hundred, desertion infallibly follows seduction :
this desertion is frequently unavoidable on the
past of the man, but that does not excuse the act
which led to it. If the seducer could but see,
1

437
distinctly and vividly pourtrayed before him,
the long train of misery and vice which he is
about to originate, he might, in many instances,
be led to pause in the pursuit of his guilty
gratifications. If he could see the blooming
and innocent tenant of the cottage, transformed
into the pale, haggard, and profligate inmate of
the brothel,if he could hear the tongue which
now utters only harmless vivacity and folly,
become the organ of blasphemous obscenity, ---
if he could see the eye, now beaming on
him with love, fixed with demoniac rage, or
rolling in the vacancy of intoxication,-if he
could pursue his unfortunate victim, through
all her successive scenes of misery and de-
gradation, to a workhouse death-bed, and a
parish burial, he might, perhaps, stop before he
accumulated on his own head such a tremendous
weight of accountability. And there is almost
always time enough to reflect; for seduction is
usually, as its name implies, a premeditated act.
For the victims, indeed, of sudden and over-
whelming passions, there may be some excuse;
but for the deliberate seducer there can be
none in the eye, either of man or God : and the
death-bed of such a man, if he have any feeliug
left, is as little to be envied as the death-bed of
his victim.

But now there came a flash of hope once more.-BYRON.
Poor Maria remained, as may be well believed,
for many weeks, in a very low-spirited and de-
pressed situation. Her health became seriously
affected by the agitation of mind which she had
undergone, and her exposure to wet and cold on
the night of her meeting with Barnard. The
foundation of a pulmonary complaint was then laid,
which, though it was not in the decrees of destiny
that it should prove the agent of her dissolution,
did materially injure her health.
In the course of time, however, she gradually
grew reconciled to her home, where she was
treated by her parents with all possible kindness.
Her health became tolerably reinstated, and her
mind began to revert with more tranquillity to the
subject of her lover, and of his shameful desertion

THE RED BARN.
489
of her. Her conscience had not any very many
severe reproaches to make her, for she had con-
sidered herself as a lawful wife, and had acted
accordingly: all she could be blamed for, was the
too credulous facility with which she had listened
to the persuasions of an insinuating and ac-
complished seducer.
But what more particularly came to the relief
of Maria's mind, was religion. This sovereign
" balm of hurt minds," which can administer not
only consolation, but joy, amid the bitterest ills
of lifethis only prop on which the faint, the
weary, and the broken in spirit, can rest with
security, was not wanting to the unfortunate,
though comparatively guiltless, Maria. She had
been brought up in the highest reverence for the
dictates, and correctly instructed in the genuine
principles, of Christianity. With, however, the
levity natural to youth, she had not yet reflected
very deeply on the subject; but adversity, that
tamer of the human breast," led her to think
seriously on what she had been taught, and to fly
for comfort to the one great source of it. She
recollected the invitation of the Deity himself,
when he took upon him a mortal body for the
redemption of mankind,"Come unto me all ye
who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest." To him she fled for refuge, and in him
she found it.
But there was nothing of the fanatica), or enthusi
astical, in the religious feelings which now actuated

the breast of Maria. She did not imagine that
faith released her from the necessity of repentance
for the past, and circumspection for the future;
or that the mere adoption of an orthodox system
of belief, was to act as a garment, like charity,
covering a multitude of sins. No! she was well
aware of the necessity of sincere sorrow for her
transgressions, and stedfast resolutions of amend-
ment. She knew that the faith, which did not
exhibit itself in purity of life and manners, was
barren and worthless, and would stand the pro-
fessor of it in little stead before the awful tribunal
of his Creator.
One of the principle causes of Maria's enter-
taining such just sentiments on the subject of
religion, was the visits of a clergyman residing in
the neighbourhood of her father's cottage. This
gentleman was a pattern of genuine and rational
piety, and of everything, in fact, which the
clerical character ought to exhibit
man in years, and of exceeding suavity of manners:
his whole attention was devoted to his flock, his
entire tiine absorbed by the duties of his profession.
He did not conceive, as some clergymen do, that
these duties were sufficiently discharged by
preaching a sermon once a week, or receiving the
fees for performing the burial or marriage service.
Every hour of his time was devoted to the in-
struction and edification of those committed to his
care; and in such pious attentions, he made no
distinction between the cottage of the peasant

THE ED BARN.
441
and the mansion of the squire. In this respect,
he followed the example of the great founder of
our religion, who considered himself as especially
sent to the meek and lowly.
This gentleman used often to look into old
Marten's cottage. His pious discourses proved a
very great source of consolation to poor Maria :
her case was revealed to him by her parents. He
did not make her any severe reproaches on the
subject; but, while he blamed her too careless and
confiding credulity, he acquitted her of wi ful vice.
Maria, in the way we have been describing, so
far recovered her peace of mind, that she might
almost be said to be more happy than when in the
enjoyment of her delusive hopes. She experienced
a calm serenity of mind to which she was before a
stranger: her present and her previous states were
like the mild tranquillity of a summer's eve, com-
pared with the feverish heat and fatiguing brilliance
of noon. Her health also returned, and with it
the natural charms of her person, now more
interesting from the pensive cast which circum-
stances had thrown over it.
Barnard remained but a short time in the
country, after Maria's return: his business, and
his inclinations, soon recalled him to London.
While he did remain, however, he called several

was that of respectful tenderness.
But a surprise awaited Barnard, on his return
London, for which he was but little prepareri,

and which wrought a very material revolution in
his destiny.
On his arrival, he, of course,
hastened to have an interview with Hannah. It
was night when he arrived in the neighbourhood
of their habitation, which was situated at the end
of a small green lane. As he proceeded up this
lane, he heard voices before him; and, on a nearer
approach, he very distinctly recognized the well-
known tones of Hannah herself: it was so dark
that he could not be distinguished. Hannah and
her companion now stopped at the door of the
former's present residence, as if the latter were
about to take leave of her. Curiosity induced
Barnard to listen for awhile before he discovered
himself, when the following precious fragments of
a dialogue reached his astonished ear.
" He !" said a voice that he could not possibly
mistake for any other than that of his mistress;
"he! you cannot be serious in supposing that I
ever cared anything about him : it was only the
fellow's money that I wanted."
"I can very well believe it," replied another
voice, which Barnard immediately recognized to
be that of the one-eyed gentleman; "for I think
he is as ill-looking a fellow as I ever saw. I should
as soon think you could fall in love with me for
my beauty."
" Yet you were the cause of jealousy in the
fool, nevertheless," said Hannah.
"Oh!" replied he, laughing;
you mean

"
good one. Did you ever know a fellow so hum-
bugged as he has been all along ?"
"What else was he fit for ?" said Hannah :  but
the clodhopper was fully persuaded that I was
dotingly fond of him."
"He has been a good harvest to you."
Yes; but I have now drained himn pretty nearly
of all his cash, and I shall presently have done
with him."
"You had better have a final pluck at him,
when he comes from the country. He and Smith
have got, I am told, their share of the goods for
betraying them into the power of the Revenue
officers."
"Yes," replied Hannah; " Barnard has written
me word of it: when he comes we'll cheat him
out of his remaining cash, and then turn him
adrift. I can't keep up the farce of pretending to
love him any longer: he is not worth losing any
more time with."
The impression made by this conversation on
Barnard may be well supposed. He forbore,
however, to discover himself,being determined to
hear all that he possibly could. After a pause,
Hannah resumed-
"But you have said nothing yet respecting
your last meeting with the old fellow."
** It's all right," answered he; " he is caught,
and you may work his purse now famously. : 1
have told him that you would see him to-morrow
evening, at nine precisely."

TUE RED BIRY,
" Where ?" said Hannah.
"Here," replied the other, "at your house.
But, Hannah, as I have put this job in your wav,
which cannot fail to be a profitable one, you must
behave fairly. Even shares, you'll recollect, is our
agreement.
Certainly," rejoined Hannah ; "you'll never
find me acting otherwise. We have divided the
plunder of Barnard equally, and we'll do the same
with respect to this old fellow."
Very well," said the fellow ; "you'll see him
to-morrow night, and you can easily get a check
or bill out of him."
These two worthies now parted,the one-eyed
gentleman turning the corner of the lane, and
Hannah entering the house.
The first impulse of Barnard was to rush after her,
and suddenly overwhelm her with his reproaches;
but, on second thoughts, he checked this feeling,
and determined to defer seeing her until the
following evening, when he meant to come at the
very hour which he had heard appointed for her
interview with the stranger. He then took his
way back into the City, revolving in his head a
variety of plans of vengeance. He was furious at
the idea of his having been made so complete a
dupe; and still more galled by the biting personal
remarks which had been made on him by Hannah,
and her open avowal of utter disregard, than even
by the loss of all his money.
He thought, at first, of consulting his friend

Beauty, and taking him with him on his intended
visit to Hannah : but then, again, he hesitated at
exposing his own degradation to another; and
the recollection of the very prominent part which
Smith had played in the system of dupery which
had been carried on upon himself, rendered him
very little disposed to seek for his aid and con-
fidence again. He felt quite assured that the
latter had been all along in the secret of Hannah's
baseness, and that he had been as well acquainted
with the Whitehead hoax, as with that of Xiuto-
totle.
After much wavering and cogitation, he de-
termined on proceeding alone to Hannah, loading
her with reproaches in the presence of her new
lover, and unmasking to him her true character.
As a necessary precaution, he provided himself
with a brace of small pocket-pistols for the oc-
casion.
Accordingly, he set out for the place in question
the following evening, after dark, and arrived there
precisely at the hour appointed. Instead of
knocking at the street-door, he climbed over the
garden wall, which was low, and got into the
house very quietly through one of the back
windows; for Barnard, by this time, had pro-
fited so well from Beauty Smith's lessons, as to
be able to enter almost any house in any way but
by the front entrance. He directed his steps
im-
mediately to the drawing-room, suddenly pushed
open the door, and entered.
## p. 446 (#472) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
Hannah was seated on a sofa, in an elegant
sort of half Grecian costume, having one side of
her bosom completely uncovered. By her side, and
with his hand round her waist, sat a gentleman-
like looking man about sixty years of age : on a
table before them stood wine, fruit, and biscuits.
All Hannah's assurance and self-possession
were at first completely overturned by the sur-
prise of Barnard's sudden appearance: she could
not speak, and her paramour was not less
astonished and disconcerted than herself. Bar-
nard stood near the door with his arms folded ;
his countenance was deadly pale; there was a
cat-like ferocity in his light grey eye; but he
was evidently struggling to prevent his rage from
getting the better of his self-possession.
After a pause of some seconds, he uttered, in
a voice of great assumed calmness,
"So, madam, this is the style in which you are
going on during my absence !this is a fine speci-
men of your fidelity and gratitude !"
Hannah, who had, by an instantaneous effort,
got the better of her confusion, now answered him,
in her usual cajoling accent,
"My dear William, I grant that appearances
are against me; but when I have explained,
you'll find that this gentleman is 
" Another dupe of your perfidious art," inter-
rupted the young man; "but I am to be one no
longer. I have bought my experience pretty
dearly ; but my eyes at last are opened."

"Will you only hear me in explanation, Wil-
liam ?" replied she.
"Not a syllable," said he ; "I heard quite
enough last night. I overheard
I overheard your conversation
last night with the blind scoundrel, who has
been so principal a coadjutor in your knaveries,
-the fellow who assisted to cheat and rob me,
and is now playing the same part for this worthy
gentleman here."
This completely stopped Hannah's mouth, and
she could not utter one word in immediate reply.
"Sir," resumed Barnard, addressing himself
to the gentleman, who had hitherto remained in
silent astonishment," had not accident completely
discovered to me the true character of this
infamous woman, I might have addressed you
more roughly. As it is, I only regard you as the
subject of deception, like what I have been my-
self. She has cheated me out of several large
sums of money, by false representations, and by
pretending an affection which she is incapable of
feeling for any one. She is now trying to do the
same by you. I heard her and her villanous
assistant agree last night on the division of your
spoils. I therefore give you fair warning, if
you should be duped by her, it will be your
own fault now. As for myself, I discard her
altogether; and when I tell you, sir, that this is
my house, I hope I need add nothing more to
show you the propriety of withdrawing."

had got into an unpleasant predicament, and

apprehensions, arose for the purpose of taking

flashed fire, and her whole countenance assumed
an expression truly fiendish.
" It is false !" she cried, "as false as hell.
The house is mine.-All he has said is false, and
he is himself a common thief and sharper."
The gentleman's suspicions of danger were
not at all removed by this last assertion. On the
contrary, he thought himself in very unsafe com-
pany, and in a very unsafe situation, at night, in
such a lonely, isolated part of the suburbs. There-
fore, quietly observing that he would leave them
to settle their disputes by themselves, he walked
down stairs and quitted the premises with all
convenient speed.
Ruffian and scoundrel!" cried Hannah,
when she saw that the gentleman was gone; "you
have done me all the mischief in your power, but
you shall pay for it : you shall not live to boast
of this."
So saying, she seized a knife that lay upon the
table, and made an attempt to stab him. But
Barnard was instantaneously upon his guard, and
pulling out his pistols, presented them at her,
crying, "Stand back, or your own life shall be the
forfeit."
She threw herself back on the sofa, quite
overcoine with rage. Barnard resumed.
"Now," said he. "I leave you for ever, I

nave, thank God, spoiled one customer for you
that is some satisfaction for me: and I rather
doubt if you'll find so good a one in a hurry as
him you call the clodhopper."
I did call him so ; and I call him now, to
nis face, fool, dolt, and clodhopper. Did you
imagine that a woman like me could regard you
with eyes of love ? Learn to know yourself better.
It is not for such a caricature on human shape
and features as yourself, to inspire the sentiment
of love. I have made you my dupe, and I glory
in having done so: and I tell
you,
that
you may
also prove the vietim of my vengeance." "
"I fear you not," said Barnard, with great
coolness; " you have done me all the injury you
shall ever do me."
"Don't be so certain of that," replied Hannah.
"I can tell you that you are a marked man,
and that I can bring the gripe of the law upon
you."
"At your own peril be it," said Barnard;
you are yourself as much involved as I am.
A lie!" retorted Hannah: "the law can hang
you; and I can, when I choose, put you in the
power of that law ;-remember your forged bills."
This deadened the force of Barnard's rage : he
assumed a less violent tone, not forgetting to hold
out certain threats against Hannah, which, in
their turn, had their effect; and after some further
violent railing on the part of Hannah, and somo

cool thrusts and parties on that of Barnard,
this virtuous pair separated.
Barnard left her in possession of the house,
which, in fact, belonged to Creed, and contented
himself with removing his own property, which
was of no great bulk. He proceeded into the
City, where he now took
up
his head-quarters.
Thus ended a connexion commenced in passion
and folly on the one side, and mercenary per-
fidiousness on the other, and continued, as long
as it lasted, in profligacy and vice. The conse
quences, however, of it did not end with the
connexion itself. The effects which it produced
on the character of Barnard: did not cease with
their originating cause, which left an indelible
stainp behind it, not to be obliterated by time
itself. It was during this connexion that the
taste of this wretched young man for profligate
expense and sensual gratification became ma-
tured into an habitual, ruling, irresistible passion,
that all his principles of religion and morality
were utterly undermined, and that he became
nearly as careless of the laws of his country as
of the commandments of his God.
The breaking of the connexion did not, there-
fore, alter his habitual course of life in London.
In one respect, indeed, it produced an effect
more injurious, perhaps, than its continuance
would have done. While Barnard was living
with Hannah, his attentions were confined to her

451
alone ; but after their separation he held indis-
crminate intercourse with various women of the
town, many of whom were of the very lowest grades
in depravity and vice. Even the semblance of
marriage, in the illegitimate union with one
woman only, with whom fidelity is observed, is
some preservative of virtue, or, at least, a preser-
vation against the grossest and most disgusting
modes of vice;-it compels, to a certain extent,
some slight observance of decorum and regularity:
but when a man once abandona himself to an in-
discriminate intercourse with vicious women, he
loses every shadow of the sentiments which he
ought to entertain for the sex,-is degraded in his
gratifications below the instinct of many brutes,
-forfeits his own self respect, and all his claims
even to toleration, as a member of civilized
society.
With many of these wretched women Barnard
formed alliances of profit as well as amusement
The plunder of their dupes was shared with him,
and the profits of his knavery with them: they
played into each other's hands, and supplied one
another in turn with customers. Nor were his
male associates a whit more respectable : inde-
pendently of Creed and Beauty,with whoin
interest still induced him to preserve his intimacy,
though he cherished no very good feelings for
either, in consequence of the share they had
taken in his plunder,-he was linked with many

far below both in the depths of crime and pro-
fligacy.
Things went on in this way for some time
longer, when both Smith and Barnard got into a
very ticklish scrape, which induced them to leave
London with the utmost precipitation. This was
nothing more than a case of robbery, the detection
of which would have secured for them, if not the
gallows, at least transportation for life.
They
contrived, however, to escape undetected, and
they took refuge in the neighbourhood of Polstead,
which, from its retired situation, afforded them a
convenient shelter.
Barnard arrived just in time to witness the
expiring moments of his father. The poor old
man was brought to the grave, perhaps sooner
than he would have been by the usual course of
nature, in consequence of the profligate line of
conduct pursued by his son, The pecuniary em-
barrassments to which that conduct had reduced
him, and his distressful feelings at the undutiful
behaviour of Barnard, unquestionably expedited
his fate. The last and heaviest stroke he ex-
perienced was the detection of the son's forgeries
on himself and his friend the banker : this came
on him like a clap of thunder,
The parties, however, who held the bills, en-
tertained a high respect for the old man, and
accepted a compromise which rendered the loss
somewhat less oppressive to him, Still, it fell

453
heavily on the old man's spirit, accompanied, as
it was, with such bitter reflections; and by the
time that Barnard arrived in the country, the
old man's strength was quite exhausted, and he
was on the point of death.
The son, who knew nothing of all this, pro-
ceeded immediately to his father's house; for he
had come down with the determination of playing
the part of a penitent, and adopting an hypo-
critical style of external reformation. When he
arrived, the first person he met with was his
mother, who told him that his father was at that
moment actually dying. Hardened as he was, ,
this news affected him deeply. He requested to
be allowed to throw himself at the feet of his
aged parent, to declare his sincere repentance, and
ask a dying pardon.
When he entered the chamber where his father
lay, the scene he then witnessed might have made
an awful impression even upon a more abandoned
person than himself, and on one whose personal
feelings were wholly unconnected with it. The
old man was stretched upon his bed, his head
raised with pillows, and his daughter also sup-
porting it on one side with her arm; on the other
side, kneeling on a cushion, was the venerable
clergyman whom we have already mentioned,
engaged in fervent prayer. He paused on the
entrance of the mother and son ; the former of
whom then said,
"My dear husband, I bring you our son

454
THE RED BARN.
William, a sincere penitent, who begs for your
forgiveness."
William then knelt beside his sister, and
uttered, in a low voice, "Dear father, do not
curse me!"
The old man's face was so pallid, and his
features so attenuated and drawn in, that he could
scarcely be recognized : he was evidently in the
paroxysm of death. Still, at the mention of his
son's name, his glassy eye assumed something
like an expression of consciousness: he attempted
to speak but could not; he put forth his skeleton
hand, and while the son was in the act of kissing
it, the father's spirit fled for ever.
The reverend clergyman who attended, chose
the present opportunity of impressing deeply on
Barnard's mind the necessity of repentance and
reformation, so To his wild and evil courses," he
said, "it was too probable that his father's death
was partly to be attributed. It was true that, in
the course of nature, he could not have lived
very
long; but his days might have been extended,
and his latter end, come when it would, not have
been embittered by the undutifulness of a son.
Still," added the clergyman,
you may console
yourself by reflecting that your father has died in
peace with you, as well as with all the rest of
mankind. He has not bequeathed to you that
most tremendous of all legacies, a parent's curse :
he has forgiven you, as our heavenly Father will
also forgive you, providing that you sincerely

466
repent and thoroughly reform ; for, without the
last, the first is fruitless. The only atonement
you can make for a past life of impiety and folly,
is a future one of religion and uprightness : you
are yet young, and there is time enough ; and
were you a greater sinner than you are, there
would be yet room to receive you in the bosom of
infinite mercy. Your part is plain to act: you
have still another parent left, -make up, by your
tenderness and attention to her, your want of
duty to the other. That parent, and a sister, now
depend on you for support,-exert yourself to
make them happy, and yourself respectable
You may not be rich, for the pecuniary embar-
rassments you have entailed on your father have
diminished his income; but you will have com-
petence by your own honourable labour, and a
self-satisfaction resulting from integrity and
virtue, which countless millions can never pro-
duce, when they are the wages of iniquity. God
bless you, my son, and reform your heart and
conduct, and make you wise, virtuous, and
happy!"
The old clergyman spoke with an earnestness
and fervency, that made, or seemed to make, an
impression on the young man : probably, the im-
pression was real, for the present; for such a scene
and occasion could scarcely fail to make the
hardest feel, at least for the time. Barnard ex-
pressed his thanks to the minister of God, for his
advice and exhortation, declared the fulness and

456
THE RED BARN.
sincerity of his repentance, and the firmness of
his resolutions of amendment. The old gentleman
then rose and took his leave.
William Barnard now became the head of his
family. The first thing he did was to superintend
the final ceremonies due to his deceased parent,
at whose funeral he was, of course, chief mourner.
He next examined into the state of his affairs, and
found, notwithstanding the dilapidations which he
had himself caused, that enough remained to
support, in decent competence, the remainder of
his family and himself. By proper attention,
exertion, and economy, he still might improve his
income, and recover the losses he had occasioned.
He now put on all the external appearances of
a man completely reformed. He was attentive to
the comforts of his mother and sister, kind in his
manners to them, and to all with whom he was
connected ; temperate in his habits, and most
assiduous in his general application to business.
He managed the affairs of the farm with industry
and cleverness; and, to the eye of the world, ap-
peared, in a temporal point of view, to be doing
extremely well.
He would work occasionally
himself among the labourers, as well as superintend
their operations. He became, too, peculiarly
remarkable for the suavity and extreme mildness
of his manners : he was never known to be out of
temper; and he gained the reputation, throughout
the whole neighbourhood, of being a most kind-
nearted, good-natured young man.
## p. 457 (#483) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
457
But we regret to say that all this was false and
hollow: the impression made upon him by the
deathbed of his father, if any indeed were made,
passed rapidly away. His virtuous bearing was
all external, his piety wholly assumed, his de-
corum a garb for the concealment of depravity;
his mildness, suavity, and kindness of manner, all
acting : he proved a most accomplished hypocrite.
His powers of self-command, and of countenance,
we have more than once had occasion to notice
j
and he exercised them, in the present instance,
to their fullest extent. He thoroughly imposed
on every one, and passed for a model of goodness;
but, in spite of his sanctimonious demeanour and
gentleness of exterior, he remained, at bottom,
what circumstances fully proved him to be,-an
unprincipled profligate, and a cold blooded ruffian.
Even now, while he was daily employed in
acting the part of the good son, the kind brother,
the industrious farmer,, and the amiable ac-
quaintance, he was still closely linked in the
bond of iniquity with his old friend Smith, and a
partner in many of his nightly depredations.
That gentleman passed his time between London
and Polstead ; and, when in the latter neighbour-
hood, he always sojourned, in secret, in the
cottage which was the scene of Maria's seduction,
and made the cave which was under it the depot
of his spoliations. He lived there in such pro-
found concealment, that no one in the country was
aware of his residence, except Barnard. Nor was

he without a companion in his rereat: Ellen, the
unfortunate cousin of Maria, was now his chre
amie. This girl, whose disposition and principles
had never been what they ought to be, soon be-
came thoroughly depraved under Beauty's cor-
rupting auspices : she called herself his wife, and
was the confidante and partner of his villanies.
During his absence, she kept house and watched
over the spoils.
It may surprise our readers, why Barnard, who
was now externally a man of competence and
respectability, should persevere secretly in those
nefarious courses. It may be thought, perhaps,
that he could not want money, and that, situated
as he was, obliged to live moderately in appear-
ances,-he could have had no outlet for profuse
expenditure; and that a country place, like
Polstead, was not likely to furnish the means of
indulgence in profligacy and excess : but those
who are disposed to guilty gratifications, will find
them even in the bosom of retirement. Barnard
and Beauty, in the retreat of the latter, enjoyed
many a secret revel and midnight debauch : there
they partook of the most expensive wines, and
the most costly viands. Barnard, also, had
formed connexions with many women of bad
character, far and near, throughout the country,
which drained him of considerable sums : besides,
be it observed, that a day's journey would,
at any time, bring him to Whitechapel ; to which
he paid occasional weekly visits, under pretence

459
of business. He never ventured to proceed into
London; but in the purlieus of that ancient
vicinity, with which he was so well acquainted,
he found ample means and opportunities of dis-
sipating his money in the society of drunkards
and gamblers, of thieves and prostitutes. Here
he would now and then pass a week; and when
he had got rid of all his money, return to the
country, to be a puritan by day, and a robber by
night.
While in the country, he used to pay continual
visits to the cottage of Maria, who was now living
with all the retirement and strictness of a modest
widow, and might well be regarded by any candid
person as being virtually such. She had now,
to a wonderful degree, recovered her tranquillity
of mind; and passed her time between reading,
working, and attending to household duties.
The old couple had also grown happy again ; and
the cottage had resumed all the air of comfort,
simplicity, and innocence, which it wore before
the departure of its loveliest inmate.
The visits of Barnard, as I have said, were
frequent, but they were secret. From his own
relations he kept this intimacy profoundly con-
cealed: they entertained a most inveterate dislike
to the entire of the Marten family, and more
especially to Maria. They looked down on them
with all that pride of superiority, which, be it
observed, almost always exists in the highest
degree in the lower walks of life. Those, whoni

station has very little removed above the hum-
blest rank, are generally at the greatest pains
to support their fancied dignity, and the most
profuse of their contempt towards those whom
they are pleased to style their inferiors.
Such persons, indeed, present a caricature of
aristocratic pride, which ought to convey a salu-
tary lesson to their betters. Pride of all kinds
is, indeed, equally ridiculous and unbecoming
to the worms called men. Nor is it less useless
than absurdfor the proudest can never hope to
have his claims to distinction allowed to the
extent of his own estimation of them. In fact,
the most deserving never have their claims fully
admitted, and an assuming manner is precisely
that of all others the least likely to vindicate
thein successfully.
It was to Maria, in particular, that the female
part of the Barnard family bore the most decided
antipathy. Her beauty was a source of envy to
them; and her pretensions to dress as well as
they did, an unpardonable insult. This, indeed,
was poor Maria's weak side; and this is what one
female never forgives to another. Besides, their
suspicions had been excited by William's former
attention to Maria, and rumours that he had
intended to make her his wife. This idea was
perfectly intolerable. It was not to be endured,
that a low girl like her should have the presump-
tion to aspire to an alliance with the high fanily
of the Barnards.
## p. 461 (#487) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
461
But Barnard himself had never been troubled
with any scruples of this kind. At the time he
had thought of making her his wife, he never
dreamed of any obstacles arising from the pride
of birth. And even now, though, of course, he
had entirely dropped that idea, he still had a
great liking for her person. His libertine habits
had totally cured him of everything like senti-
ment, which he held in the utmost derision:
but Maria was a desirable object in the eyes of a
general lover of the sex; and, perhaps, more so
now than ever. Her person had acquired all the
tempting fulness of womanhood, her cheek had
recovered its bloom, and her eye its liquid lustre,
Her countenance, though no longer illumined by
the gay vivacity of youth, yet beamed with a
pensive sweetness that was still more interesting
and attractive.
Maria, therefore, was now the cause of Bar-
nard's visits to the cottage. Since he had cast
away the chains of Hannah, he had met no woman
like her. Maria was her equal in beauty; and

stant, delicate, and tender attention, by which
he trusted eventually to succeed.
The hypocrisy, art, and insinuation of Barnard,
succeeded as well with the Martens as they had
done elsewhere. He became a prime favourite
at the cottage, where, when at Polstead, he
usually passed some portion of every evening.
The father and mother became attached, and he
began insensibly to gain ground in the affections
of Maria. At this the reader will be the less
surprised, when he reflects what the state of her
feelings respecting him had formerly been. Had
it not been for the return and interference of
Jackson on the one side, and the interposition
of Hannah on the other, she would doubtlesis
have been married to William, with her own free
and full consent. Nothing is more natural, more
common, or more excusable, than for a young
and affectionate female, deserted as Maria had
been, after the first transport of sorrowful feel-
ings has gone by, to be accessible to a second
return of the tender passion. It sounds mighty
fine, in Novels and Romances, to talk of the
impossibility of a woman's feeling love a second
time; of eternal constancy to a shadow, to a
name! But this is neither human nature, nor pro-
bability, nor fact : if such be ever the case,
-which I marvellously doubt,- I suspect that the
woman who is an illustration of it never felt
love at all. The female who has once truly loved,

463
must love again, if severed eternally, by any cir-
cumstances, from the object of her first attach-
ment. She must always have something to love.
There is, in almost every female breast, an impe-
rious necessity of loying, which must be obeyed.
It is the dominant feeling of her mind, and the
whole business of her life. Men, as a highly
gifted poet well observes, have many other mat-
ters to occupy their attention, to distract their
minds, to console them for their disappointments :
but woman has nothing but love ; and in that one
word is written the entire history of her life.
It would, therefore, have been extremely
natural for any young man, of insinuating manners,
to have gradually won on the affections of Maria,
under the circumstances in which she was placed.
But it was doubly natural that a man like Bar-
nard, for whom she had certainly cherished some
affection before, should do so. Moreover, be it
remembered, that Maria justly considered her:
self most shamefully deceived and deserted by
one whom she had looked on as her husband.
His conduct had been so cruel, that time alone
would have sufficed to wean her thoughts entirely
from him,and finding that she was not really
married, she naturally considered herself free to
accept any man she might like for a husband.
Barnard's visits she soon felt to be habitually
necessary to her.
The state of retirement in
which she lived ; that monotony of existence

which she felt more than formerly, since the
feelings of her heart had been so much excited,
made his presence a relief, an amusement, a
pleasure: they would converse and read together
for hours. Barnard was now by no means an
ignorant man : he surpassed Maria in the know-
sedge of books, almost as much as he did in the
knowledge of the world. He acted, in some
measure towards her, the part of an instructor:
he lent her books, read with her various portions
of history, and works on literature in general.
He, in some degree, formed her taste, and even
corrected her style of composition.
The mind of Maria was flexible, and, like the
twig, was easily inclined. We have mentioned
that, from education and habit, she had a strong
reverence for the precepts, and in the hour of dis-
appointment had derived comfort from the lessons,
of religion : but she had not an understanding
competent to the discussion of its truths, and she
had received them, as the majority do, without
examination : she was not prepared, according
to the advice of St. Paul, to give a reason of
the hope that was in her. Dr. Goldsmith used
to say, that he took his religion from the priest as
he did his coat from the tailor,-leaving the fashion
of the one to the first, and that of the other to
the second. This saying, which would have better
become a worse man, is very applicable to the
greater portion of those who call themselves

THE KED BARN.
465
Christians : that the faith of such should be easily
shaken, by plausible and persuasive sophistry, is
not to be wondered at.
Barnard's notions concerning religion we have
already described : he had graduated in the
school of Carlile, and was one of his warmest
disciples. It is not, therefore, to be supposed
that many of the books which he recommended
to Maria, or the ideas which he inculcated,
were favourable to Christianity. With his own
family and friends, his hypocrisy on the subject
of religion was the same as in everything else;
but with Maria he was more open, because it
suited his own purposes to be so. He gradually
insinuated into her mind doubts concerning the
infallibility of religion. If he did not succeed in
imbuing her thoroughly with his own atheistical
principles, he, at least, succeeded in giving a
material shock, both to the religious and moral
feelings in which she had been brought up.
Although Barnard was not so accomplished, so
handsome, so gentlemanlike, as Jackson, yet he was
a seducer far more insinuating, artful, and sophis-
tical. He did not often allude, in his conversations
with Maria, to her affair with her former lover
but when he did, he always assumed an apologetic
tone for her conduct. He reprobated the other
for his deception and desertion of her, but always
insisted that she was totally free from every
shadow of culpability. He went further, and
upon
himself to defend the propriety of an
took

illegitimate intercourse between the sexes : he
said, that even if she had not been deceived as to
the validity of the marriage, that still she would
not be to blame for having yielded to her inclina-
tions;-that marriage was useful, and, in some
cases, necessary; but still that it was nothing but
a human institution, not founded on the laws of
nature or of God.
The winter had more than passed away, in the
manner we have been describing, and Barnard
found that he had made a very great progress in the
affections of Maria : for himself, his passion for
her possession, united with a certain sort of
vanity in the conquest of a young and pretty girl,
grew stronger and stronger : still he forebore, as
yet, to come to an open declaration of love. But
he soon saw that little else was wanting, and
accordingly he seized a favourable opportunity of
making such declaration.
Maria answered, as he expected, by a confession
of reciprocal attachment on her part. He then
declared that it was his full and firm determination
to marry her, but that marriage must be delayed
for a little time, in consequence of the inveterate
dislike of his relatives to the connexion. Time, he
said, was necessary, either to overcome that
dislike, or to place him in such a situation as tu
be independent of their feelings.
After this eclaircissement, Barnard's attentions
grew more and more constant, and the strength of
Maria's attachment increased. He began to press

THE RED BARN.
46,
her to give him the last proof of that attachment;
and though she refused to do so for a considerable
time, her denials at last grew fainter and fainter.
He told her, that though the ceremony was
delayed, she was not the less his wifethat he
considered her as such in the eyes of heaven-and
that though he looked on the mere form as
nothing, yet the earliest opportunity that should
offer, be swore inost solemnly, that for her sake
--for the sake of securing to her his property, it
should be performed
Still he could not yet completely prevail ; but,
at last, he bethought himself of a method by
which he should overcome all her scruples. He
prevailed on her to consent to meet him by
moonlight at the Red Barn, where they should
go through a sort of religious form-taking vows
of eternal fidelity to each other, and calling God
to witness their mutual sincerity. She listened-
she consented,and they met under the pale
moonlight near the Red Barn, at the spot where
Barnard had, all innooent, at a former period,
wandered with her-ere his heart had been
estranged from virtue and its sweet consequences;
-here, on this spot where he had made the first
step towards the loss of that virtue, and yielded
to the false glare of Hannah's beauty-here did
he now meet his victim with a heart-0, how
changed from its early self !how false-how

pestilence. Here they pledged their mutual
faith in the most solemn terms, each called upon
the Deity to witness their vows; and Barnard, not
content with this, called down the most tre-
mendous imprecations on his own head, if he
should fail in the performance of his oath. He
then pressed her to his heart, saying"Now,
Maria, you are mine for ever!"
"Oh, William !" she sighed, "if you should
prove false ?"
" False !" he exclaimed; "I am as likely to do
80, as to stab this bosom which is now throbbing
against mine.
" If you "
deceive me," said she, " you will
pierce it indeed."
Thus fell Maria, a second time, to rise no more.
In the first instance, she proved the victim of an
accomplished libertine, who, though unprincipled
and vicious, possessed many traits to redeem him
from utter reprobation :though inconstant, he
was generous,though sensual, yet refined,
and though regardless of the rights of society, not
without some sense of honour. In the second
case, she was the dupe of one who had little to
recommend him, either personal or mental, except
a portion of intelligence and artfulness turned to
the worst purposes ; and a gentleness and suavity
of manners, assumed as a cover for inward de-
pravity and secret fierceness. In neither case,
however, could she have heen said to have made
& wiltul sacrifice of her virtue: if she erred at all

409
she erred through weakness; and the worst blame
that the most rigid could have attached to her,
was a want of such firmness and intelligence as
it would be ridiculous to look for in a girl of her
age, circumstances, and rank in life. In the one
instance, she was deceived by a solemn burlesque
of the sacred ceremony of marriage, accompanied
by every circumstance that could impose upon an
ignorant and inexperienced female; in the other,
by vows made and attested in the presence of the
Deity himself. If she had been culpable, what
were her seducers ?

The secret intercourse between Barnard and
Maria was now regular and constant. Their
place of private meeting was always the Red
Barn. After some months, however, the fruits
of that intercourse became so apparent that
longer secrecy was impossible. She revealed her
situation to her lover, and after many consul-
tations, it was agreed between them, that that
should be done which, indeed, could not be
avoided
A full confession was made to the parents of
Maria. They were not so much surprised as
vexed at the circumstance, From the long and
close attentions of Barnard, they had previously
suspected the state of the young people's affec-
tions. He, however, made the same protestations

He swore
to them that he had made to Maria.
that it was his firm intention to make her his
wie the very moment he should be so situated
as to be enabled to do itthat at the present
moment he considered her as nothing else, and
that while he had breath he would cherish her as
such. It was, therefore, agreed between them all,
that Maria's situation should be concealed, which
was easily done, as she lived in such privacy at
home; and that when the time of her accouch-
ment drew near, she should go to Sudbury, a
village not far distant, to be delivered.
Barnard affected a vast deal of tenderness and
satisfaction at the present state of his Maria, and
to be highly delighted at the idea of becoming a
father ; but his real feelings on this subject were
vastly different. The fact of Maria's
pregnancy
filled him, in secret, with the most fiendish rage.
The idea of a burthen being thus imposed upon
him, when he had contemplated nothing but the
gratification of his passions, rendered him furious.
When alone, be abandoned himself to the full
force of these demoniacal feelings. At the cottage,
he was all smiles, soothing, and gentleness: the
instant he quitted it, and thought himself secure
from observation, he was transformed into a fiend.
He would then stamp and swear, indulge in the
gesticulations of a maniac and the blasphemies
of a devil. He could be compared, on such
occasions, to nothing but the arch enemy of man-
kind, as described by Milton, when, after appear-

ing as an angel of light, he abandoned himself,
unnoticed. as he thought, to all the paroxysms
of his fiendish nature, on the mount of Paradise.
I his union of a generally mild and calm, and
even cold demeanour, with the internal com-
motion of the worst passions, was a striking
feature in the character of Barnard. He had it
from his infancy. He very rarely suffered the
ebullitions of stormy feelings to break out-exer-
cising, in this, a degree of self-command which
increased with his increasing years : he could
assume the calmest and the gentlest outside,
while the most malevolent passions were raging
within. One or two instances have occurred, in
which this usual circumspection in company
forsook him ; but they were only momentary.
In this peculiarity, however, Barnard was not
singular,-it belongs to many others, and perhaps
is always characteristic of those whose feelings,
of whatever kind, are the strongest and the
deepest. The outside is no criterion. The earth-
quake may slumber in the deep caverns beneath
the surface of the most placid waters;-the
smiling verdure on the slope of the volcano, and
the snow upon its summits, afford no indication
of the fires that boil within its bosom.
When the time approached, the unfortunate
Maria went to Sudbury, where she might more
easily escape the censoriousness of the villagers
of Polstead, and more readily receive the medical
assistance which her situation required. She was

THE RED BARN.
473
delivered of a fine infant; and when her strength
was sufficiently recovered, she returned with her
child to her father's cottage, where she continued
to live with greater privacy than ever.
Barnard continued his tenderness of manner, and
poor Maria, now almost entirely occupied in the
pleasing duties of a mother, began really to taste
again of happiness. She forgot the sorrows and
disappointments of the past, and began to indulge
a golden dream of lasting contentment, felicity,
and love: but she was too soon, too suddenly, to
be awakened! Oh, happiness, thou fleeting
shadow!thou illusive phantom, ever dancing
before thy pursuer, and eternally eluding his
grasp !Misery! thou only thing below that is
certain and substantialthe never failing in-
heritance of the children of the earth, though
divided among us with no very impartial hand.
Mysterious providence! the largest portion of evil
too often falls t the lot of the virtuous and un-
offending, while temporal good is the possession
of the wicked: but their hour of retribution must
arriveif not here, hereafter. Their crimes are
written with a pen of adamant on tablets of brass;
and the talents they have wasted will be reclaimed
by an inexorable judge, whose scrutiny no subtlety
can escape, and whose rigour no prayers can
soften.
The malignant feelings of Barnard were not
altered by the sight of his innocent offspring. On
the contrary, they were rather increased : he was
3 p

474
THE RED BARN,
perpetually brooding in his gloomy mind over the
burthen which his own unbridled passions had
entailed upon him; and which all the ties of nature,
feeling, and duty, called upon him to support.
This, however, he was determined to do no longer
than he could help it: he knew that as long as
he remained in the country he must do so,
either voluntarily or by compulsion. To leave the
country, at present, or for some time to come, did
not suit bim : he turned his mind to other schemes
of emancipation.
Nor were his feelings, now, towards the mother,
much more favourable than towards the child.
Of all passions, there is none so soon satiated as
lust; and mere lust was all the feeling that Bar-
nard had entertained towards Maria. It is also
the most debasing of all passions, when unmixed
with any finer sentiment: its votary is always
sure to turn with disgust from his victim, when the
brutal appetite is once satisfied ; and if circum-
stances will not allow him to quit her, his former
liking is apt to turn into a deadly hatred. When
this once takes place in a mind of such depravity
as Barnard's, it is scarcely possible to conceive
the enormities it may produce. Demoniacal cruelty,
infanticide, and murder, are the offspring of this
hell-born passion.
Barnard became soon fully resolved to get rid
of a burthen from which he could not escape, and
the idea of which grew more and more irksome to
him every day. But the most depraved seldom

475
determine on crime for its own sake; and even
when the motive to the crime is nothing but a
sordid and fallacious view of self-advantage, they
will endeavour sophistically to persuade them-
selves that the action which they contemplate
is justifiable on some other ground. Perverted
reason is ever ready to lend its aid to unbridled
passion, or heartless depravity: we all of us
easily find cogent arguments for doing what we
like.
Thus Barnard attempted to convince himself
that the removal of the child would be a benefit
both to Maria, himself, and the infant. Being
determined not to provide for it, he soon found
that he could never muster the means without
denying himself the necessaries of life; i. e. the
means of all kinds of riotous gratifications, which
habit had now rendered so necessary to him, that
he could not exist without them. Again, he con-
sidered that to relieve Maria from the burthen would
be right and proper.
How could she support
the child ?--and, as for the child itself, he con-
sidered that he should be doing a kind action in
removing it from inevitable want and misery. He
even called his memory and his reading to his
assistance, and defended himself by the practice
of individuals, and even nations, with whom
infanticide was common, when there was no means
of supporting the offspring. But, above all, he
fortified himself by the reasonings of his infamous
friend, Mr. Carlile, who has recommended the

prevention of child-bearing, in such cases; and
whose theory Barnard would have willingly
reduced to practice with Maria, but that he had
not the audacity to propose it to a girl of her
principles, or so completely to unmask his own
vile character.
As to the idea of committing murder, that did
not at all shock him, especially in the case of the
benevolent murder which he was contemplating.
"What signifies," thought he, "the life of a mere
infant ? a thousand things may occur to destroy it
before it reaches the age of five years. And
what an immensity of pain and misery I shall
save it from, by the mere pain of a moment
nay, probably, without inflicting any pain at all :
children, so young, must have little pain in dying.
And, after all, what is human life itself, at any
age, and under any circumstances? What is its
value?-nothing! it is subject to ten thousand
accidents : the most trifling thing may destroy
it; and go it assuredly must, at one time or other.
An early death may often be accounted happy :
perhaps it would have been happy for me had I
died at the age of this infant."
He was not aware, at the time he made this
reflection, of its entire truth. Unfortunate and
abandoned youth! it would, indeed, have been
happy for yourself, and all connected with you,
had you
not entered the portal of life, or had you
died upon its threshold !
By continually revolving reflections of this

477
kind in his mind, Barnard, at length, came to a
determined resolution of putting an end to the
existence of his own child !
The next question was, how should it be done? -
the coalition of Maria, in such an infernal business,
was not to be expected. That mighty feeling,
by which the system of animated nature is not
less preserved, than by the procreative instinct,-
the feeling of maternal affection, which no brutes
are destitute of, except a few in human shape,
existed in its fullest force in her kind and
gentle bosom. She was completely wrapped up
in the life of her infant: its care absorbed
every
instant of her time, and every thought of her
mind. She doted on it with the most affectionate
fondness : she did not love it less than she did its
wretched and unworthy father.
It happened, rather favourably for Barnard's
detestable
purpose,
that the child was about this
time taken ill. It continued so for some time, and,
being a weakly infant, would, in all probability,
have soon died in the ordinary course of nature:
but the amiable father determined to seize this
opportunity of hastening the mortal crisis, and
expediting the passage of his child into eternity.
Accordingly he went to Sudbury, under the
pretence of purchasing medicine for the child, as
the village apothecary was absent from Polstead
at the time, and even were he present, Barnara
observed that he would not trust to him. When
he returned, he came to the cottage, from which

478

both the old people were absent; and the little
girl, who attended Maria and the child, told him
that the former was asleep. He asked for the
child, and was informed that it was in a cradle
adjoining the room where the mother had just
lain down : he entered, mixed a powder in a
tea-cup, and, taking up the child, administered it
to it.
While he was thus employed, Maria,
waking from the child's cries, looked immediately
through a small crevice in the wall, and saw very
clearly what he was about. Having no other idea
than that he was kindly administering medicine
to the sick infant, she was delighted at his paternal
kindness; and resolving to give him an agreeable
surprise, suddenly entered the room.
" My dear William," said she, "this is kind of
you."
Her entrance was unexpected, for he thought
she was asleep: his presence of mind was over-
turned, and his agitation would have been palpable
to any one but Maria. He stammered out, "Yes!
I have given it some medicine from the doctor."
His hand trembled excessively, and he uncon-
sciously dropped the paper containing the powder.
Maria, turning her attention to the child, did
not then notice the confusion of Barnard. He
made some excuse to quit the room-not being
able to endure her presence.
Scarcely had he withdrawn, when the child
was seized with the most fearful convulsions :
Maria was in the most dreadful alarm, not knowing

THE RED BARN:
479
what to do. There was no one in the house with
her but the ittle girl. She knew that the village
apothecary was absent, and she could have no
assistance: she sent the little girl to look after
William, to try what he could do. In her absence,
she happened to cast her eyes on the ground,
where the paper lay which Barnard had dropped:
she took it up, and, to her unspeakable horror,
she found it labelled "Poison !"
Her next look was upon her infant. The poor
innocent was in the agonies of death : its features
were frightfully distorted, its skin had assumed a
deep livid tinge, and every limb was shaken with
convulsion. In a second or two it expired.
Maria shrieked aloud, threw herself on the floor,
rose again, and hung over the child in the most
intense agony of feeling. She called upon its
name, used the little terms of endearment which
she had been accustomed to apply to it in life,
raised it in her arms, kissed its livid cheek, and
pressed its lifeless form to her bosom. She fell into
an agony of tears.
The girl returned,-her search for Barnard
had been fruitless; but he made his appearance
directly after her entrance. He had withdrawn
for the purpose of re-collecting his self-possession;
but, as he had anticipated the immediate death of
the child, he knew the necessity of his immediate
return. He now came prepared to act his part,-
the cool, hypocritical, whining villain.

6. Traitor! you
Scarcely had Maria seen him, when she
exclaimed,
you have poisoned
oar child! the dear, dear infant is murdered !"
" Poisoned ?" cried he, raising his hands and
eyes.
" Yes, poisoned ! and by you : look here, vi!-
lain !" and she showed him the paper.
He started, but he was prepared for this : his
acting was consummate. He let his head fall
upon his bosom, (a motion which, by the way.
was rather usual with him,) he struck his hands
violently against it, and cried out,
"I am the most miserable of men, Great God!
what have I done? but I will not survive it."
So saying, he rushed over to the mantelpiece.
and seized a brace of pocket pistols belonging to
himself, which hung there. He was in the act of
applying one of them to his head, when Maria
seized his arm.
"Madman!" said she, " what do you mean?"
"To follow my child," answered he.
Maria! I have, I have poisoned the dear infant;
but it was by mistake. I bought a powder at
Sudbury, a medicine for our infant; I unluckily
purchased some poison for rats also, and-oh!
my God! it was the poison I gave to the child,
by mistakeand I am, I am its murderer."
He threw himself on the floor, and groaned
aloud.
Maria was completely deceived by his acting,
and became not less alarmed for her husband, as

she always called hiin, than agitated by the
death of her child. She stooped, and put her arms
around him, saying,
" For heaven's sake, William, do not be so
violent-do not alarm me in this manner. Wc
have lost our child-do not rob me of my husband
too."
Oh! Maria," said he, "I cannot; will not
live,-I am too unhappy !besides, if I do not kill
myself, I must perish by the law. If this be
known, I cannot escape; I had better, therefore,
die by my own hand;"and he again seized one
of the pistols, both of which had dropped when
be threw himself down. Maria wrenched the
pistol from his hand, which indeed, he did not
hold with the firmest grasp, and threw it to the
other end of the room.
"For the love of God, William, forbear," said
she, "or kill me too. It shall not;-must not be
known."
"I am unfortunate," he exclaimed, after a
pause, "but not guilty ; yet it is all the same-
I must equally suffer, if this be known.. I have
no witnesses in
my
favour.'
"Am not I a witness ?" said Maria.
"No," replied he," your evidence would not
be taken. It would be said that we were in
collusion to murder the child.".
"Oh heavens!" cried she, and sunk on a chair.
Much more of this sort passed between them;
and his repeated solemn asseverations, and

parade of mock feeling, succeeded, for the pre-
sent at least, in completely persuading Maria of
his innocence.
They finally agreed, that as the manner of the
child's death was known only to themselves,
they would keep it a profound secret. The old
people were to be told that the child died of
convulsion, so suddenly that timely assistance
could not be obtained.
But the death of the child produced a very
serious effect on the mind of Maria. Previously
to that event she had begun to recover the happy,
cheerful disposition which was natural to her,
tempered, it is true, by such a remembrance of her
past trials, as prevented it from re-assuming the
light and thoughtless character of her early
vivacity. But now a shade of the profoundest
melancholy began to overcast her.
She scarcely
ever left the body of her infant while it remained
unburied, and passed her entire time in sighs and
tears. The jaded passion of Barnard was not
stimulated into renewed activity by this change in
her temper.
He was particularly anxious that the child
should be buried with all convenient speed. He
felt himself neither safe nor comfortable as long
as it remained above ground. He was terribly
alarmed lest the manner of its death should be
betrayed in soine palpable marks on the body.
He therefore urged Maria to its immediate
burial. He told her, moreover, that the bunal

must not take place at Polsteadfirst of all, for
the very obvious and natural reason that it might
be the means of promulgating their connexion in
the neighbourhood, which, for the present, must
be avoided ; secondly, that any examination
of the body, which by some accident or other
might take place, would, notwithstanding his
innocence, put his life, and perhaps hers, in the
most imminent danger. They determined, then,
that the hapless babe should be secretly buried
in the neighbourhood where its ill-fated mother
had given birth to it-namely, near Sudbury.

Maria and Barnard now prepared to proceed

remains were enclosed, and set out together, after
night-fall, on their melancholy mission on foot.
It was moonlight, but the moon was continually
obscured by detached and fleeting clouds, ever and
anon traversing its silvery disk. They seemed
like the scattered fugitives of a retreating army,
as they were hurrying along to join the cloudy
pack which was flying before the north-west
wind : but the air was dry and sharp, with no
symptoms of approaching rain.
Our travellers plodded on their dreary way in
profound silence, through a narrow, lonely,
melancholy road. How different were the feelings

of the two bearers of their first, their last, their
only child! Maria was wretchedand yet
without beirg able to assign to herself a sufficient
cause for her wretchedness. It was not altogether
the loss of her child, aggravated, as it was, by the
mode of its dissolution : this loss might have been
borne. There was a chance of its being repaired,
and a prospect of happier days; but her mind, in
spite of herself, was filled with the most gloomy
presentiments of the future. She shuddered with
vague apprehensions ofshe knew not what-a
death-like dampness hung over her spirits, utterly
subduing all their energy and elasticity. In vain
she tried to rally themin vain she summoned
hope and resolution to her aid. By every mental
effort, she sunk lower than before ; and the tears,
which she would have repressed if possible,
flowed silently down her pale cheeks, as she
slowly paced along.
The feelings of Barnard were different but
was he happier ? Oh no! could the murderer of
his child be happy ?could the extinguisher of
his own blood taste of joy or peace? He was not
quite so callous as totally to escape the scourge
of conscience, or those pangs of feeling which
outraged nature must inflict : but his chief source
of uneasiness was sordid fear. He considered
that his life was no ionger secure: another was
the depository of a secret on which his fate
depended. Even though that other was Maria,
he could not be satisfied : incapable himself of

anything like a pure affection, he did not credit
its existence in others. His decreased, I might
almost say now extinguished, passion for Maria,
was another cause of his distrust: those whom
we cease to regard, we begin to suspect. Besides,
the consciousness of his own guilt, and the fear
that Maria was not deceived by his protestations,
or that though she might be so at present, she
might yet cease to be so, tormented him. He felt
that he must escape-that he must take some
step, by flight or otherwise, to secure his own
safety. He was exactly in that frame of mind
in which a man like him --so disposed, so circum-
stanced-would not long hesitate to commit one
crime to shelter himself from the consequences of
another. His fears were growing thick
and, as he proceeded along, the idea of his being
about to bury his murdered child, made him start
at every noise, lest, by any chance, his crime
might have been discovered, and the agents of
justice be in pursuit of him.
They had now arrived at a very picturesque
part of the country. To the right of the road
which they were traversing, was a very con-
siderable extent of open ground, chiefly pasture-
land and meadow. It consisted of an undulation
of hill and vale, or rather of small rising slopes
and gently sinking hollows: the rising grounds
were all covered with clumps of thick and low
trees, the close masses of whose foliage in the
moonlight, contrasted in dark patches with the sur-
upon him

rounding landscape. It all appeared to be the
work of unassisted nature, for the divisions of the
fields were not marked so as to be visible; and
the absence of all arable land increased this
illusion.
On the right of the road was a thick and
verdant hedge which rose considerably above it,
orto speak more properly, the road sunk below
it, for the ground on the other side was so high
that a moderately tall person standing there, might
be visible for more than half his height : on
that side the moon shone. Along the length of
this hedge, on the field side, were planted, at un-
equal distances, several large sycamore trees.
They had just reached a projecting corner of
this road, where it winded round a little more to
the right, and were proceeding on, when a voice
called out, in a full, clear, deep, and thrilling
tone,-
" Barnard ! stop!"
Terror seized on both the travellers; but Bar-,
nard, in particular, felt the greatest perturbation :
he trembled from head to foot. The cold perspi-
ration fell in large drops from his forehead; his.
teeth rattled within his lips; and his face, which
was naturally florid, assumed a hue of deadly
paleness, rendered still more ghastly by the re-
fiection of the moon.
"In the name of God, William, what is that ?":
exclaimed Maria.

THE RED BARN.
"I know not," cried he, hurriedly; " come
along."
The voice had appeared to come from behind
them as they walked along; but now, on the
other side of the green hedge, close by a sycamore,
and directly between Barnard and the moon,
stood a tall figure enveloped in dark drapery : it
waved its hand, and beckoned to him. He, how-
ever, attempted to disregard it, and was hutrying
quickly forward, when, in a deeper and more
commanding voice than before, it called,
" William Barnard! stop!-I command you."
It would be vain to attempt to pourtray the
agitation of Barnard. The surprise was so un-
expected, and took place under circumstances so
calculated to inspire alarm and awe, that he could
not maintain his self-possession: the strength of
his nerves forsook him, and he trembled like an
aspen leaf. His impression was, that it was an
officer of justice who had addressed him, and that
the avenger of blood had overtaken him.
As for Maria, her confusion and terror were
great, but, of course, she could comprehend or
conjecture nothing respecting their cause.
Barnard was in that state in which a man is,
whose courage is so paralyzed that he has not
even the power to run away; still, even in all
his agitation, the selfish, sordidness of his cha-
racter broke out.
Here," said he to Maria, in a faltering voice,

so take this, (pushing the coffin towards her);-
take it-take it-I must see who calls me.'
Maria, with trembling hand, took the coffin, and
walked slowly on; Barnard returned trembling to
the place where the figure addressed him. It
descended from an open part of the hedge, and
came into the road. He came up: the figure was
enveloped in a large dark cloak. It removed the
hood on his approach, and, to his utter astonish-
ment, confusion, and rage, it proved to be-
Hannah Woods !
Barnard's audacity now returned, and his first
fee.ing was to strike her to the earth; but, recol-
lecting that Maria was within sight and hearing,
he paused, checked his feelings, and listened
patiently
"Barnard," said she, "it is in vain that you
attempt to shun me ;-I must be heard."
"What brings you here?" replied he: "where-
fore do you persecute me?"
"Necessity !" answered Hannah.
"I cannot minister to your necessity," said
Barnard ; "and it may not be for your interest
thus to pursue me."
"I care not-I am reckless,-consequences are
nothing to me now. I see who is with you."
" What of that ?" said Barnard.
Much," replied Hannah; "much more than
you are aware of. But I must see you again, and
talk with you : it is for your own interest, welfare;
and security. Your life is in my hands, William

Barnard ; and if you regard it, you will meet me
to-morrow evening, after dark."
Why should I meet you ?" said Barnard : "I
will not meet you."
" Then you will take the consequences.
I
not ;--if you do not meet me, you shall deeply
care
repent it."
"Where would you have me to meet you ?"
said Barnard.
"At Smith's cottage,there you will find me,
after dark."
"Well-I will meet you; and now let us
part."
"Don't fail, Barnard, at your peril;for your
own sake you will not. Recollect, I hold the
scales of your destiny in my hands, and a touch
of mine can incline the balance. Meet
Meet me, if you
regard your existence."
So saying, she re-ascended, and quickly dis-
appeared over the hedge.
Barnard and Maria now pursued their journey,
until they arrived where the narrow road they
had been traversing struck into the highway.
They crossed the latter, and turned into some
fields, through which there was a path : this
finally conducted them to a lonely, isolated,
uncultivated valley, surrounded on all sides with
thick low brushwood. A limpid stream flowed
through the midst of this little spot, over a sandy
bottom: it seemed to be a place completely shut
out from the rest of nature,-such as the genius

of solitude might be supposed to choose for his
most favorite haunt.
Here Barnard suddenly halted, and said to
Maria, " This is the place where we shall bury the
child ;-remain here for a few minutes, until I
return.'
So saying, he ascended the nearest eminence,
and disappeared through the brushwood.
Maria laid down the coffin, and seated herself
on a broad stone at the foot of the hill. The
wild and barren scenerythe uncertain light of
the moon, as the clouds which successively ob-
scured it flung their dark shadows across the
valleythe silence of midnight, unbroken, save
by the hooting of the owl heard from the distant
woodand the light gurgling of the stream, as
it surmounted some opposing pebbles in its descent
from the bill,--harmonized well with the sadness
of her desolate heart. She looked on the coffin
containing the relics of her beloved infant, raised
her eyes and hands to heaven, and wept bitterly.
Barnard remained absent for nearly half an
hour, and Maria began to feel alarmed at her
lonely situation. He returned, however, at last,
carrying a spade upon his shoulder; how he had
procured it is not known.
He spoke not a word, but proceeded, in gloomy
silence, to dig the grave. The spot he chose for
this purpose, was a little hillock not far from the
source of the gushing stream.
Maria was attentively and silently watching the

progress of his labour. Ile continued to work for
pore than half an hour: she, at length, ob-
served that he was making the grave of a niuch
greater magnitude than was necessary for a small
infant. She noticed this :-
Aye," said he, the grave should be large;"
and he looked at her with a mysterious and unde-
finable expression of countenance. She trembled,
but knew not wherefore.
Barnard finished. He fung down the spade,
folded his arms, and looked intently for some
minutes in the new-made grave. He then raised
his
eyes,
looked at Maria, and then looked down
into the grave again. He now walked round it,
paced up and down a few turns, with his arms
still folded, and with an air of the greatest ab-
straction. He seemed like one who was de-
liberating about something of intense interest, and
could not make up his mind.
He returned to the grave, looked into it again,
and, after a long pause, observed,
" It is large enough."
" Too large," replied a hollow voice, which
actually, to his frighted ears, seemed to issue
from the bosom of the hill.
Maria sunk on the earth with terror,-Barnard
started with the most fearful agitation. When a
little recovered, he exclaimed,
"Who are you?-answer, I charge you."
There was no reply.
Maria and he now listened in trembling silence,

493
for a few seconds; but they heard no sound save
the plamtive murmur of the rivulet.
"Give me the coffin," said Barnard; "we must
dispatch, and leave this place."
They deposited the coffin in the ground. Bar-
Aard covered it with nervous precipitation, and
replaced, as well as he could, the green sods which
he had dug up.
" Farewell, my dearest, dearest child !" sobbed
Maria, as the last turf was replaced on the new-
made grave of the murdered innocent; "never,
never, shall I see you more.
" Come on, come on," muttered Barnard ; "we
are not safe here."
They quitted the valley, and having entered
on the field-path, walked on for some time without
speaking. Maria, at last, said,
"What could that voice have been, William ?"
" I know not," replied he ; probably nothing
but the echo of the place."
" That could not be," said Maria; "I think it
was the voice of a spirit."
"Nonsense," answered Barnard ; "there is no
such thing-let us talk no more about it."
"But who," said Maria," was that who spoke
to you on the road ?that voice I certainly have
heard somewhere before.
"Don't ask me now," said Barnard ; "I'll tell
you
hereafter-I cannot talk at present."
They now proceeded homewards, and gained
the cottage, after an hour's walking, without

further interruption : there they partedBarnard
giving Maria an hypocritical embrace. She re-
tired to a sleepless bed, to bathe her pillow with
tears,-he wended homewards his solitary way,
distracted by a variety of the most fearful re-
flections, and revolving in his remorseless mind
deep and dark designs of villany.
He was haunted, as by a demon, with the
perpetual thought that his life was in danger : he
did not, however, repent him of the enormous
crime which he had committed, but regretted its
imperfect concealment. He believed that Maria
more than half suspected the truth; and the
idea that she, or any other human being, should
be the depository of this dreadful secret, was
terrible to him. lle was already three parts in-
clined to send the mother to keep company with
the child. His extraordinary abstracted manner
at the grave was the result of a sudden impulse
of this nature ; and had it not been for the voice
by which he was startled there, it is far from im-
probable that Maria inight never have returned
from the valley where her infant was buried.
Again, on the other hand, he was greatly troubled
and alarmed at the re-appearance of Hannah :
here was danger from another quarter. He knew
that he was in her power also : she could lodge
informations of a very serious kind against him,
in consequence of his London pranks : besides,
had she no knowledge of his last crime? He
could not account to himself for the possibility of

403
her possessing such knowledge; and you he could
not divest his imagination of the idea that she did
possess it. The voice by which he was startled
in the valley, he was convinced, was hers. She
saw him, then, bury the infant in a clandestine
manner, in unconsecrated gound ;that would be
a sufficient foundation for her to injure him, and
he knew, too well, that she had the inclination.
He resolved, however, to keep his appointment
with her the following evening, that he might
ascertain the full extent of the risk to which he
was exposed, and take the best measures that
eircumstances might suggest.
Barnard accordingly repaired to his appoint-
ment. He went to the cabin which, for some time
back, had been tenanted by Smith, Ellen, and
the old bag who had been originally placed
there as the ostensible occupant. At present,
however, he found nobody there but the last
mentioned and Hannah : Smith, he knew, had
gone up to town some days before.
When he entered, he found Hannah sitting in
the parlour, at a small table, by the embers of a
half-extinguished fire, and with a pale and solitary
light before her, which might almost be said
to render darkness visible. She was poorly
attired, and had lost all traces of her former
beauty : the pleasing expression of countenance,
which she had known how well to assume, had
all vanished. It had given place to a calm, cool,
determined look of recklessness, with a sort ut

chastised ferocity in the eye, which was rendered
not the less alarming from the evident attempt to
restrain and temper it. Her naturally strong
features and swarthy complexion were totally
unrelieved by any artificial aid from the art of the
toilet; and she looked full ten years older than
when Barnard had last seen her. How changed
from what she was !how changed from the
voluptuous syrenthe luxurious Egyptian-who,
aided by all that art, and dress, and manner,
could bestow, had given an added zest to the
Epicurean banquet, the Bacchanalian revel; who
seemed to possess the power of pepetual excite-
ment; whose soft and thrilling accents of love
would strike an alarum to the heart of an an-
chorite; and within whose arins was all that is
fabled of the eternal virgins of Paradise ! The
fire of love, or of simulated passion, no longer
illuminated her eye; it was cold, and dark, and
gloomy: yet her form still possessed much of its
original and native dignity. She was ruined, but
it was the ruin of the archangel.

She rose
at the chance of losing it; and rather than not
gain the point she had in view, would perish in
the attempt.
She raised her eyes on the entrance of Bar-
nard, and said,
"It is well, you are faithful to your appoint-
ment."
Hannah was sitting between two tables,- or
rather, there was a small table a little towards her
right hand, while her left was leaning on the
larger table at which she sat. The latter table
filled the room so as to render it rather difficult
for Barnard to come round to her side.

passion whatever. She repeated, in a deep and -
tranquil tone,
"You are come, William Barnard:-I am glad ,
of it, for your own sake."
Barnard did not contemplate her appearance
and behaviour without a certain degree of alarm:
he saw very clearly that a bullying conduct on his
part would be of no use. He replied, after a
pause,
" Yes; I am come :what would you with me?"
" That will explain," said Hannah, handing him
a letter.
The contents of this letter were as follow :-
DEAR WILLIAM;
"I am pinned at last,--decidedly nibbled.
Information was laid about our last concern, and
I am bagged: the least I can expect, is a trip over
the herring pond. Ellen is here, and sometimes
sees me: she is now a free trader, on her own
bottom: I can't help that. Good bye, my dear
Barnard; keep your sails up, though your
keel be striking the ground. I send you a
lock of my hair : good bye.

I am topped, I'll die game :-I hope you wili
do the same if it should be your luck to go that
way.

"London, Newgate, 10th Feb. 18."

"A pretty epistle," said Barnard, as he finished
it; "but what is all this to me?"
"Everything," replied Hannah ; " you were
engaged with him in this robbery, and your
liberty, if not your life, is in danger. You are in
my powernot only for this, but for other matters.
You are in his also."
Well," said Barnard, "I can't help it ;you
must do your worst."
" Barnard," replied Hannah," you mistake me:
I do not come here to injure you I come as a
friend, notwithstanding all that has passed. I
own that I have once deceived you, but I do not
pretend to do so any longer : I speak to you now,
as a man of sense and of the world. I do not
pretend to keep up the farce of love."
"Proceed," said Barnard ; " I am all attention."
"Smith is ruined," replied Hannah ; "they
are all ruined. You can hope for nothing more in
that mode of life; nor can you live long as you
do at present."
"This is all very true," said Barnard; "I
know I cannot: but what do you counsel me to do ?"
"To raise your fortune by marriage," said
Hannah.
" By marriage !" replied Barnard, and paused
awhile. "Yes; I believe there is something in
that: but how. go about it?-it requires intro-
duction."
" I have a plan," said Hannah, " by which you
cannot fail to succeed ; but my assistance will be

necessary, and I cannot afford to give it for
nothing.
". Name your plan," said Barnard.
"This it is," said Hannah : "you go to London,
advertise in the papers for a wife; I will resume
my character of fortune-teller, and find out some
girls of property, from the addresses to the
answers, whom I will persuade that they are
to be married to a man exactly like you, and
through the medium of an advertisement."
Well," said Barnard, "and, in case of success,
what do you expect ?"
" While I remain here, a protection from want;
and, in case of success in the matrimonal specu-
lation, one hundred pounds; otherwise, William
Barnard, you shall have no assistance from me,
and I shall be forced to make unpleasant dis-
closures concerning you."
Well," said Barnard, "you talk fairly: it is
our interest to be friends--I accede to your terms.
My present means are but scant, but I will do all
I can."
" You have a connexion in this country which
you must break, William Barnard," said Hannah.
"How do you know anything about it?" ob-
served Barnard.
"No matter how," said Hannah, "I know it;
and I know more than that, -your life is not very
safe here, William Barnard."
He started. " What," cried he, "what do
you
know ?"

"Did not I see you," said Hannah, "burying
your child by moonlight, in unconsecrated ground.
What could that be for?"
Secresy," replied Barnard.
"I believe you," said Hannah, expressively ;
" but," added she, "re-assure yourselfI will
not betray you. While you act fair, I shall be
faithful ; but, mark my wordsno longer."
Barnard now departed, having first supplied
Hannah with a little money.
Here was a new
coalition formed between them, very different
from their original one.
That had been an union
of sensual passion and sottish confidence on the
one side, and duplicity and avarice on the other ;
this was a consolidation of interest and exertion
on both sides, for the avowed purpose of undis-
guised villany. There was no love on either side,
but the love of self--no confidence, except that
which, like the courage of a coward, is the in-
spiration of fear.
Matters continued in this state for some time
longer. Barnard could not yet arrange things
so as to be enabled to depart for London, or make
up his mind as to the disposal of Maria. He felt
himself now in a state of double slavery. His
means were seriously contracted, by reason of
the supplies he was forced to advance, and his
mind was perpetually tormented by the though
that he was in the power of two women, either
of whom, by a single word, might seal his
destruction.
## p. 502 (#530) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
Thus situated, he came to the resolution, that
of either of them he must decidedly get rid, by
some means or other. He could not flyhe could
not escape.
His property was in such a state
that he could not convert it into cash, without
some time, difficulty, and trouble. If he were to
withdraw himself from the country, he would
withdraw himself from the present means of sub-
sistence, and resign the indispensable foundation
of his future hopes. Besides, he would leave
himself open to the vengeance of two enraged
females, and his very flight would be a tacit con-
fession of guilt.
He began then to argue with himself, which of
these two females he had better trust to which
of them he should determine to remove. For
that either of them must be removed, and removed
by death, he had fully decided. Was Hannah to
be his victim ? Here he came to a dead pause.
His interest was now obviously connected with
hers. She might always be induced either to act
or to conceal anything, for money. She was abso-
lutely necessary to his future measures. He couid
not do without her. She must be the stepping
stone, not merely to his fortune, but to his security.
Moreover, were he even resolved to kill her, had
he decided that such would be the most expe-
dient measure, could he do it? Here he paused
again : Hannah was a very dangerous woman to
meddle withher genius overawed him.  The
promptitude and determination of her character,

which lent her an apparent ubiquity, gave her, in
his eyes, something of a supernatural cast. iu
plain language, he was afraid of her: the interview
which he bad with her at the cottage, as we have
described, proved to him that she was on her
guard. Every subsequent interview confirmed
this fact to demonstration : she never went un-
armed, and she always took care to let him see
that she was not so. His own life might be the
immediate forfeit of any attack on hers: violence
she was prepared to resist, and he could never
hope to overreach her by art, or lull her suspicions
and win her confidence by smooth-tongued hypo-
crisy.
Hannah was, then, out of tho question ; but
Maria remained. Maria, an obstacle to his hopes
not to be surmounted, but which must be re-
moved. He could do nothing until she was dis-
posed of;she was a clog on his every movement.
She was also a thorn in his side : his life was
especially in her power. He felt convinced that
she was the depository of his most dreadful secret.
There was no safety for him while she lived, -
no peace of mind, no tranquillity, no pleasure, by
day,
-no rest, no oblivion, by night. His agita-
tion of mind was terrible : his health was affected
-his appetite was gone-sleep was banished
from his pillow. The hated cause of all this must
be reinoved.
Had he wavered at all in this, his final deter
egination, a conversation which took place be-

tween himself and Maria, about this time, was
sufficient to fix his decision. Latterly, they had
many altercations. Barnard, from day to day,
had postponed, under a variety of pretexts, the
performance of his promise of marriage : Maria,
wearied of guilt, incessantly urged him to the
execution of it. To her intreaties, those of her
parents were strenuously united. The connexion
was beginning to be more than whispere,
through the village; in fact, it was alma,
publicly known. Maria's character, of course,
suffered severely : she lived very privately; but
still she heard and saw sufficient to convince her
of this fact. If she ever did venture out, the girls
of her acquaintance passed her with a contemp-
tuous sneer, and often with a very audible ex-
pression of their notions of her character. This
preyed deeply on her mind, and she was con-
tinually urging Barnard to do her justice, and
restore her to the enjoyment of her pristine
reputation.
It is needless to say that all this was ex
ceedingly disagreeable to him, and often excited
his anger in no small degree. One day, when
they were both speaking on this subject, the con-
versation turned on the death of the infant. Maria
stated to Barnard that, on the day before, when
she had been at Sudbury, she had gone to the
apothecary from whom the powder which haa
been administered to the child was said to have
been bought. She had gone to him merely to

505
procure some simple for her mother,and that he
told her he did not sell Barnard two powders, but
only one, on the occasion stated by him ; and she
asked Barnard how he could have been mistaken.
This alarmed him :-he replied in his usual
hypocritical strain, and succeeded, at least, in
silencing Maria on this dangerous topic. But
from that moment he felt that he stood on a
terrible precipice. He did not fear Maria herself
-but she might speak of the circumstance to her
inother : the thought shook him with fear, and he
felt that while Maria lived he could not be safe.

SRAKSPEARE.
It is not to be supposed that Barnard deter-
minded quickly, or at once, upon the murder of
Maria. A sudden impulse to commit it certainly
did seize his mind at the burial of the infant :
time, place, and opportunity, then seemed to
concur so favourably for the atrocity. But in the
case of all premeditated crimes, it almost always
happens, that even the greatest ruffians must
familiarize their minds for a time with the idea of
the act they are about to perpetrate. The habit
of contemplating a forbidden action will gradually
render us less averse to its performance, when
good, or fancied good, to ourselves is to be the
result. On every repeated contemplation it loses,
in our estimation, a portion of its natural defor-
mity. It is not in human nature to choose crime

for its own sake. There must be first a powerful
temptation, and the understanding must be
blinded by the passions, before the worst of men
can make up his mind coolly and deliberately to
the perpetration of a great enormity. It is quite
a mistake to suppose that criminals see their own
guilt in the light that others see it. They either
pursuade themselves that the act they have in
contemplation is not so bad as it is represented,
or they are supplied, by the sophistry of self-love,
with the most invincible reason in favour of its
commission.
Such was the case with Barnard. The idea of
his connexion with Maria became every hour
more and more irksome to him. It hung with a
dead weight upon his minda clog without the
removal of which there was no hope of freedom,
no prospect of prosperity. He might fly, it is
true, with some little difficulty ; but if he should
so, what would be the consequence ?the certain
risk of his life. Such a measure would, he was
certain, cause the disclosure that he had so
much reason to dread. There were, he conceived,
but three possible choices for him, and all of them
evil. He might fly, and have his life in perpetual
danger, and his mind in constant uneasinesshe
might remain, in which case he must have married
Maria, and, without getting rid of his fear, have
lived unhappily with a woman he could no
longer love, and must have given up all his hopes
of fortune-or, he might remove the object which

stood between him and present peace and future
prosperity, and trust to management and good
fortune for the concealment of the deed. In an evil
hour he determined on the last. The fiend which
had been long planning his eternal destruction,
now succeeded in achieving the final blow. The
net of guilt, in which he had been long entangled,
had its last meshes now completed. The con-
cluding link wis now forged of that fatal chain
which was to bind him to the throne of the Prince
of Darknessperhaps for ever!
Having made up his mind to the commission of
the atrocious deed, the next thing to be considered
was, how was it to be done ?This question
involved no small degree of consideration. It
behoved him to proceed with the utmost caution,
and to make all possible provision against dis-
covery. Time, place, and manner, were all to be
provided for.
While his mind was in this state of delibera-
tion, another circumstance occurred, which was
not calculated to make him slacken in the execu-
tion of his infamous design. As this circumstance
also will throw some light on another character in
this story, we shall relate it. Sometime before
what we have been now relating had taken
place, Jackson, who had not altogether forgotten
Maria, and who wished still to make all the
further atonement in his power for deserting her,
sent her by post a letter containing 50. He had
met with some success, and his first thought was

509
to impart some assistance to his unfortunate
victim. lle sent the letter from Brussels, where
he then was, and requested that she would write
an acknowledgment of its reception to an address
in London, which he inserted.
It so happened that when the letter arrived at
old Marters, there was no one in the cottage but
William Barnard: he took the letter in, and
evidently felt that there was an enclosure in it.
Without ceremony, he broke the letter open, and
read it; then put the money very quietly into his
pocket, considering it as an excellent windfall, and
threw the letter into the fire.
Jackson, having waited for some time, and re-
ceived no reply from Maria, wrote again. Bar-
nard was not so successful in intercepting this
last epistle as the former: Maria received it, and
read it with the utmost astonishment.
The first thing she did, was to communicate
this discovery to William Barnard. He exhibited
some confusion on the occasion ; but, pretending
to treat the business lightly, said that he sup-
posed it was some miscarriage of the post, and
bade her think no more of it. He told her, more-
over, that he was glad of it, as he did not desire
that she should receive assistance from any one
but himself, and least of all from Jackson.
It so fell out, however, that in a few days after
this conversation with Barnard, Maria Marten
chanced to meet the village postman.
She
stated the facts which we have now related, and,

to her great surprise, he assured her that he had
brought the letter in question to the cottage, and
that it had been taken in and paid for by Mr.
William Barnard !
This conduct, on the part of Barnard, both
astonished and displeased Maria : she thought it
both unkind and unprincipled; and when she
next met him, she reproached him with it. He,
seeing that a denial was of no further use, now
openly confessed the fact.
He said that, in the first place, he did not like
the idea of any communication between her and
Jackson ; and, in the next, that he was, at the
time he opened the letter, in a state of great em-
barrassment, in consequence of a bill of his having
just come due, and for which there was no im-
mediate provision ; he, therefore, he said, had
ventured to borrow the money with the full in-
tention of repaying it at the earliest opportunity.
He had no other means, he said, at that time, of
saving himself from the jaws of a prison ; and he
solemnly swore, that the very instant certain
monies should be paid which were then owing
to him, he would put 50 into her hands, which
she might either return to Jackson, or dispose of
in whatever other way she thought proper.
Maria said that it was not the consideration so
much of the money that displeased her, as the
want of confidence on his part. However, after
some further gentle reproaches on her side, she
heartily and freely forgave him.

But this circumstance, which, in a different
state of things, might have been unproductive of
any effect, whetted his resolution still more to the
immediate execution of his atrocious design : he
felt that every moment's delay was pregnant with
danger. By this discovery, he concluded that he
must have lost every tittle of her confidence-
that she was not in any degree to be trusted
-- and that there was no security for him but in
her destruction.
But how was that destruction to be accom-
plished ? Barnard at first thought of poison; but
he soon relinquished that idea. He was afraid of
detection, and he did not like to have recourse
again to a mode in which he had already partly
failedfailed, if not in execution, at least in con-
cealment: such a failure, in the second instance,
must be fatal. Poison was not difficult of de-
tection ;the purchasing of it was dangerousthe
administering of it both difficult and dangerous. Its
operation was not always to be depended upon :
Maria might live long enough under its influence
to ruin him. Its marks might become so apparent
as to be obvious to detection : a thousand ac-
cidents might lead to discovery; and should any
accident lead to suspicion, that suspicion would
hardly fall on any one but himself.
Poison, then, was not to be thought of: he
must take some mode more certain in its execu-
tion, and more easily concealed.
## p. 512 (#540) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
He also revolved in his own mind where the
dreadful deed which he was contemplating should
be performed. It must not be done in the cottage,
or in any place where the body could not be pro-
perly concealed.
Sometimes he thought of
inveigling Maria away with him to some con-
siderable distance. Then again he reflected
that a long absence would expose him to great
suspicion, and that in any quarter the localities
of which he was not well acquainted with, he
should find a great difficulty of concealment.
The idea of Smith's cottage then occurred to
him. "Down," thought he, "in the cave, the
deed might be perpetrated with safety, and the
body concealed." But then it could not be
done without the knowledge of Hannah,and he
was determined to have no confidante to his guilt,
and least of all such a one as she. He was far
too deeply in her power alreadyhe did not
choose to involve himself any farther there. That
might necessitate the commission of another
crime ; and, steeped as he was in guilt, he still
trembled at the idea of a concatenation of murders
At last he bethought himself of the Red Barn!
He kept the key of it himselfthe place was at
present particularly isolatedhe would be liable
to no interruption--and he could hide the body
there, as he thought, so as to defy the possi-
bility of detection. He imagined, too, that this
place, though possessing many requisites for such
## p. 513 (#541) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
513
a deed of horror, would yet be generally thought
an unlikely place enough for the commission of a
murder.
On the Red Barn he then fixed, as the theatre
in which to perform his bloody tragedy: he also
fixed upon the instruments which he should
employ. He determined first to try the pistol,
and if that failed, to have recourse to the sword.
Respecting the use of the latter weapon, he
adopted a measure which discloses a most marked
trait in his diabolical character: he took a curved
sword, which had been for some time in the
possession of his family, to a cutler in the neigh-
bourhood. He gave him directions to make this
sword as sharp as he possibly could; and though
not called on to give any reason for this, he added,
with careless impudence and levity, that within a
few days he was to be present at a wedding;
and that he intended, merely as a whim, to make
use of this weapon as a carving knife !
Having now made up his mind, digested his
plan, and prepared everything for its execution,
all that remained was to inveigle Maria to the in-
tended scene of action. For this purpose he
visited the cottage, and introduced himself, quite
contrary to his usual custom, the subject of
their marriage. Before this, he scarcely ever
mentioned it, except when it was forced on his
attention by the urgency of Maria or her parents.
Now he commenced it hijnself-telling them that
it had been too long deferred, though unavoidably;
3 u

and that he was now determined that the ceremony
should be performed without delay : still, he
observed, that the greatest privacy was indis-
pensably necessary, to keep it from the knowledge
of his relationsthat Maria and himself must
leave Polstead secretly, and get married at
Ipswich, by licence, to avoid the publicity and
delay incident to being called in church.
The old people and Maria were quite delighted
at his proposal ; and the latter bestowed many
caresses on the hypocritical, subtle, murderous
villain, which, had he possessed any feeling, must
have been like so many daggers in his heart.
Feel them he did, in spite of all his callousness;
but his personal fears, and strong determination
on crime, were not to be overpowered. He ap-
pointed to come the next day to take Maria to
Ipswich, and then withdrew as soon as he con-
veniently could, lest the contending feelings by
which he was agitated should betray him.
As he was returning home, he was met by
Hannah Woods.
" Barnard," said she, "you are losing time
you should be in London."
"I know it," replied he ; " but I cannot go yet
awhile.'
"You cannot resolve to give up this girl, I
suppose?" said Hannah.
"I shall soon get rid of her," said Barnard;
"she is about to leave the country."
For ever?" said Hannah.

THE RED BARN.
515
There was somethiog in the tone and look, with
which she pronounced these words, that disturbed
him. She, probably, meant nothing by them; but
the natural peculiarity of her manner, added to
his own consciousness of premediated guilt, pro-
duced a shuddering feeling through his frame.
"Yes!" he replied, with a voice a little
faltering ; "I hope for ever."
"I hope so too," said Hannah ; "when she is
gone you may be freebut not till then."
No more passed between them ; but this was
sufficient to strengthen him still more in his
diabolical determinations.
The following morning Barnard came to the
cottage about ten o'clock. He then stated that
their departure must yet be deferred for a day or
two;that his mother was unwell, and he could
not, with propriety, be absent until she got better.
He said that they should go on the following
Thursday, if possible.
The fact was, he had been that morning at
the cutler's, and found that his sword had not
been sharpened ; nor could it be finished for a day
or two, as the cutler was unavoidably absent.
This was the true reason why the villain thought
fit to defer their departure.
In the interim which elapsed between that and
the day appointed for the marriage, Maria suffered
very much from mental depression : she could
not tell why, or wherefore; but she had an un-
defined feeling of some dreadful calamity im

516
THE RED BARN.
pending over her. She thought perpetually on
the fate of her poor child, and was constantly
bursting into tears.  Her nights were for the
most part sleepless ; or, if she did at any time
close her eyes, her rest was agitated by vague and
terrific dreams. She would suddenly start from
sleepawakened by some horrid image, too
dreadful to be borne ; and utter an involuntary
scream of terror. Her mother, alarmed, would come
to see what was the matter, and find her trembling
every nerve, and her face bedewed with a cold,
damp, and death-like perspiration
She thought, too, sometimes of Barnard with
an unaccountable feeling of distrust: his conduct,
relative to the money, occurred to her. She then
thought of the child :-could he have intended to
poison the child ?-But no !-that was impossible;
- she could never believe it. Who could be that
mysterious person that met them on the road ?-
Barnard had never given a satisfactory explanation
of that. A thousand little indescribable peculi-
arities in his manner had lately struck her: he
was reserved, abstracted, silent, seemed often lost
in thought, and gave most incoherent answers,
and impertinent to the subject. He would sit
with her sometimes for an hour together without
opening his lips, and then get up, take his hat,
and walk away without bidding farewell. She
also could not avoid observing how careless he
was grown in his dress. This was the more re-
markable as he had hitherto been always notorious

THE RED BARN.
511
for the reverse : he had evinced a strong tendency
to be a coxcombnow he was culpably negligent
even of cleanliness.
She sometimes would ask him the causes of all
this, and what was the matter with him. He
generally replied, that he was unwellthat he
felt his health severely affected; and, indeed, his
thin and haggard looks bore testimony to the
truth of this statement. His florid complexion
had given way to a deadly paleness; and, instead
of having the elastic step and erect gait of youth,
he stooped considerably.
But Maria's distrustful feelings concerning Bar-
nard were merely temporary, and, as it were,
in-
stinctive: her understanding did not concur with
then, and she could not bring herself to think
really ill of him. The fact was, that, with all his
unworthiness and apparently repelling qualities,
the unfortunate girl sincerely loved him; and
against those we love, it is impossible to retain any
permanent suspicion. We cannot help thinking
that they feel as we do; nor can we easily be
brought to suppose that they would act towards us
differently from what we would towards them.
On the Thursday, Barnard came and made
some pretext for deferring their departure a little
longer : his mother, he said, was not completely
recovered, nor was his sister perfectly well. He
did not then appoint any definite day for them to
go, but said that it should be in a day or two at
farthest.
## p. 518 (#546) ############################################
518
THE RED BARN.
On the following day, however, William Bar-
nard called at the cottage about noon : Maria was
then up stairs with her mother, and he sent for
her to come down and speak with him. When he
saw her, he said,
" Well, Maria, I have come for you at last
We must go so get ready immediately."
Why, William," she replied, " that cannot be
I cannot get everything ready. You said yester-
day that it should not be for a day or two; and
this being nearly the end of the week, I am not
prepared."
" Never mind preparation," answered he; "it
is not as if you were going a long journey, or to
marry a stranger.'
" But surely," said she, "a day or two can
make no great difference."
"No, no!" he replied ; " there must be no
more delay: you have been disappointed too often,,
and you must come now."
After some further conversation, he opened a
parcel which he carried, and took out a male
dresstelling Maria that, for the purpose
of
avoiding observation, she should put on that drew;
and that, instead of going out together, they
should meet at the Red Barn, where she was to
resume her female dress, which he would carry
thither. After some more talk on this point, the
measure was agreed to, and Maria went up stairs
to change her dress, while Barnard seated himself
for a few moments by the parlour fire.

THE RED BARN.

Maria went up to her bed-room, where her
mother still was. She laid the dress, which Bar-
nard had given her, on the bed; and throwing
herself into a chair, burst into an involuntary
flood of tears.
" What is the matter, Maria ?" said her mother;
" and what is that dress for ?"
"I am going, my dear mother," answered
Maria; "going at last."
"Going, Maria! where ?"
" To be married," said she; and again wept
bitterly
"Why, I thought William said yesterday, that
you could not go for a day or two ;-how he
changes his mind! And what is that dress for ?"
"I must wear it to escape observation : I shall
put on my own again at the Red Barn."
" At the Red Barn !" said the mother.
" Yes! William and I will meet there ;-we
must not go out together."
Maria !" said her mother, "all this seems very
strange to me. I don't know how it is, but I
don't half like your going now ;-) had a dream
last night."
"Oh, mother"" said Maria, rising, and wiping
her eyes; "there is no use in our talking about
it-go I must : I feel that my character
True;" said the mother; yet I wish it had
been on any other day ;-Friday is an unlucky
day "

"Well, well," said Maria, preparing to dress
herself, "it must be."
While Barnard was sitting below, old Marten
entered, and found him with a pair of pocket
pistols in his hand, which he was snapping and
examining as if to see that the flints were in proper
order. He started at the father's appearance;
but quickly recovering himself, asked him how
he did, and told him that Maria and himself were
now going to be married.
The old man, who had nothing of the feelings
of his wife on the occasion, expressed his entire
satisfaction at the news, but added very abruptly,
" What are you going to do with those pistols,
William ?"
"Oh!" said Barnard carelessly, "I never
travel without pistols. Nothing like being pre-
pared for whatever may happen: but it is getting
late," continued he." God bless you, my dear sir !
I must go out before Maria."
"God bless you, my son !" said old Marten;
"and I hope and trust you will take care of Maria."
" Don't be afraid of that," said Barnard ; " I'll
take the best possible care of her."
As he was going out, he called to Maria to
make haste, or they should be too late. He
received a bundle from her, and directing her to
take a private path-way to the Red Barn, while
he should take the public road, hurried off with
the most unceremnious precipitation.

Maria now finished dressing, and came clown
stairs with her mother. The parting with her
parents was deeply affecting: she was bathed in
tears.
"Don't cry, Maria," said her father;
you are
going, I hope, to be happy."
" Yes," said Maria, " I know I am; but I
can't help crying."
"Husband !" said the mother, "I don't like
Maria's going: I am terribly afraid some accident
will happen to her ;-) had a dream last night."
" Pooh, pooh !" said Marten,  don't tell us
about your dreams--the girl will be happy
enough. Villiam's a good lad, and will protect
her,--he has his pistols with him."
"Pistols!" rejoined the mother: "well, God
protect her !"
The parents then folded their unfortunate child
in their embraces, and pronounced a long, a last
farewell! and Maria crossed that threshold, over
which she was never, never to return.
It was now high noon : the sun shone brightly
in a cloudless sky, and not a breath disturbed the
calm serenity of the atmosphere. Nothing could
be heard but that low buzzing sound which almost
seems to render silence itself more palpable.
How little in accordance was the horrid tragedy,
about to be performed, with such a day!-and
yet, how tenfold more horrible from the contrast!
There was something, too, in the death-like still.

ness that prevailed around, to excite and cherish
apprehension and foreboding, in a mind already
depressed, from whatever cause. It was like the
terrific calm which is said to precede the first
shocks of an earthquake.
Maria felt a most unaonquerable depression of
spirits : she knew the necessity of haste, but her
limbs seemed to fail her as she walked, and
to refuse to obey the dictates of volition-as we
often fancy they do in some frightful dream, in
which we appear to be making abortive efforts to
escape from instant and tremendous danger.
She stopped, and leaned against a tree: the
cottage where she had been born was still in
sight. There it stood-its white walls gleaming
in the sun-light, and partly shaded by the climbing
rose trees, whose more than half-blown honours
were shedding their fragrance far around. Within
a little time they will fade, wither, and die,
thought Maria ;but they were not destined, like
herself, a fairer flower, to be cropped in their
bloom of beauty by a ruffian hand !
The sight of the cottage, and its surrounding
scenery, produced a strange effect upon her mind:
every object about assumed a vivid and painful
distinctness to her eye; and the recollections
associated with it rose in review before her
fancy. In an instant of time, her whole life
passed like a panorama before her mind's eye

all the events that had occurred within so short
a space to excite and afflict her feelings, passed
before her.
She felt a sudden impulse to go back to the
cottage: again, the necessity of her marriage
pressed upon her mind. Something seemed in-
wardly to tell her that, in spite of all reluctance,
she must proceed,that there was no going back
Her heart was sinking within her; but on

It was the voice of irrevocable destiny, and she
obeyed it: her days were numbered,-her last

human atrocity. All was prepared ;--the weapons
of death were ready, and the instruments of con-
cealment.
What were his feelings? Were they calm,
cool, collected kwas he so hardened in guilt as
to have no touches of compunction ?-$0 nerved
in villany as to have lost all conscience ? Not
89 ;-he was still agitated by a tempest of con-
tending feelings; the demon and the coward were
struggling in his bosom; but the former gained
the ascendancy, and the latter was silenced, if
not subdued : he had screwed up his determina-
tion, if not his courage, to the sticking place. He
could not rid himself of the physical sensations of
fear and horror, but he palsied their moral ip-
fluence. While his bosom faltered, his heart
palpitated, and his hand trembled, his mind was
firmly, steadily bent on the execution of his
direful purpose.
Mari now came in sight of the Red Barn-
before the entrance of which Barnard was slowly
pacing, with downast looks and folded arms.
He was like the prowling wolf, awaiting his
unwary victim.
" You have been a long time coming, Maria,"
said he, as she approached ; "we shall be late :
come in, my dear, and change your clothes in the
bay of the Barn. Did anybody see you as you
came?"
No," replied Maria.
" Did you see any body ?"

526
"Not a soul," answered she; " the workmen
are gone home to dinner.-Heavens! how lone-
some we are here, William !"
" So much the better. Come-come in."
They both now entered: Barnard thought himself
quite prepared. He stood apart while she was
undressing, but so as to see her perfectly through
the wide crannies of a partition which stood between
them. She wore a part of her own dress under
the male attire which he had provided for her.
As she was removing the latter, he cocked one of
his pistols.-He looked at her: her lovely hair,
having escaped from the combs which confined it,
hung dishevelled over her snow-white bosom,
while her bright eyes were raised towards heaven
suffused with tears. It was a sight that might
have moved the Prince of Hell himself to pity.
The monster presented the pistol at her through
an aperture in the partition,-hesitatedtrembled
-his arm fell. He was almost wrought on to re-
linquish his design.
But he thought of his murdered child-his
danger--his interest; if he should fail now, he might
never have such another opportunity;-he might
be discovered. By a desperate effort, he rallied
his determination, and suppressed his feelings.
Thrice he raised the fatal weapon-thrice his
trembling hand refused to obey the dictate of his
hellish mind, and fell inefficient by his side. The
fear of missing his aim, and horror of hitting, male
his whole frame shudder: he walked to and fro
in the greatest agitation.

" William," said the ill-fated girl, "come here
and tie this ribbon on my hair."
He approached.
" Heavens !" she cried, "how you tremble,
love !-what's the matter ?"
" Death !" exclaimed the villain; and at the
same moment levelled his pistol at her head : he
fired, and she fell at his feet with a deep and
heavy groan.
The report of the shot deprived him of all
consciousness for a moment : he stood fixed
to the spot in a paroxysm of terror! Cold drops
rolled from his forehead.
Aroused by a deep and piteous moan, he started
up: he ventured to look at Maria.
She was
extended on the earth, but not dead !-it was a
dreadful sight! Her bosom heaved with convulsive
throesblood was Aowing from her neck and
part of her faceher eyes were open, but sightless.
Barnard did not dare to look again, but rushed
from the Barn in horror.
After some minutes in the open air, he recovered
the consciousness of his situation : the imminent,
tremendous danger in which he was placed, flashed
across his mind. Maria was not dead !-she
might recover,-he must then be discovered.
One immediate impulse of self-preservation now
effaced every other feeling, and hurried him back
to the horrible scene.
He returned: Maria was still alive; but the
ball which had entered the neck and come out
near the eye, had deprived her both of speech and

reason: she might have survived several hours in
this state. She was now awfully convulsed ;-her
fair bosom laboured for breath, and her white
limbs quivered. Should she yet live to speak bis
atrocity!the thought was fearful.
There is an intoxication, an infatuation, a mad-
ness, about crime, that in the very commission of
it destroys reflection, and impels almost in-
stinctively the criminal to proceed in his atrocity.
Barnard seized the short sword which he had pro-
vided, in case of the failure of the pistol : he was
about to strike, when the eye-ball of the dying
woman turned horribly upon him! There was no
meaning in the vacant stare; but it was terrific
beyond the power of language to pourtray. He
flung down the sword, and rushed out again.
But his purpose must be fulfilled. He fancied
that he saw some one cross the road below, at a
distance : the necessity of securing himself re-
- verted to his thoughts. He returned, locked the
door, took up the sword again, and, without daring
to look at the dying countenance, plunged the
weapon into her heartthat hapless heart which
orce had throbbed with warm affection for him !
There was no groan,the blood rushed profusely
from the wound, and, with one convulsive stretch,
the unfortunate girl expired!
Barnard gazed in stiffening horror at the dead
hody for a considerable time-he felt almost
senseless, when he was aroused by voices without.
He started-self-preservation restored his half

away. Two of his labourers were passing the
Barn, returning from their dinner to their work-
it was their voices he had heard.
No time was now to be lost: he at first had
intended, after the murder was accomplished, to
make the grave immediately, and had provided
spade and pickaxe for the purpose, but his
powers were unequal to the task. He dragged
the body, with some difficulty, into the chaff-
house; and having locked the Barn-door, left the
place to recover himself a little, before he could
attempt the burial of his victim.

But we must now draw to a conclusion this
melancholy portion of our narrative. We should
not, indeed, have dwelt so much on its details,
had we not considered that the interests of truth,
murality, and religion, required us to do so. It
was necessary to point out the gradations which
led to folly and vice, to the highest degree of
criminality, and to develope fully the extent of
atrocious depravation, which will prevail in a mind
that has once discarded the rules of virtue an

Such was the fate of the unfortunate Maria :

sacrifice to the guilty fears and demoniac cupidity
of a villain whoin she loved to whom she had

Corrow,
On the day which followed the bloody tragedy
which we have detailed, between one and two
o'clock, a postchaise suddenly drove up to the
gate of old Marten's cottage. A great bustle and
loud talking took place between the driver and a
man who sat along with him.
"Come, my hearty," cried the latter, "we drop
anchor here."
"I doant knaw what you mane by drop anchor,"
said the postboy.
" Pooh, pooh! my lad, I mean stop-halt the

Gig! why this bees a chay, mun-gig,

" Well, well! stop, I say, in plain English."
" Well, then, in ple. te llenglesh, I wool."

On hearing this noise, Marten and his wife came
out to the door, to see what was the matter. As
they approached the chaise, an old gentleman put
out his head, saying,
"Ah! Mr. and Mrs. Marten, how do you do?
-how do you do? All heartyeh?
They recognized immediately the protector of
Maria, and our old and much esteemed friend,
Captain Carribles !
The worthy Captain looked as well, as strong,
and as hearty as ever: the lapse of time seemed
to have little or no effect upon his iron frame, nor
could the cold and darkling clouds of age diminish
the warm and cheerful sunshine of his soul. No
envious care, no rankling passion, had contracted
his manly brow; but his open and serene aspect at
once announced a guileless life, and a heart over-
flowing with the best feelings of philanthropy.
Time, which had shorn the honours of his head,
had left his strength unimpaired, and his temper
unaltered : he was like the oak of the forest bereft
of its leaves, but whose trunk might yet for ages
bid defiance to the storm.
"Well, my worthy old folks," said he, as he
descended from the chaise and entered the cottage;
"you must come off directly with me, both of you,
down to my cabin.'
Lord, Sir!" exclaimed the husband and wife;
"what for?why should we go with
your
honour?"
"I'll tell you that," said Carribles, "when we
get home : I have not come here to take you

away for nothing, I can tell youI'll make you
both as happy as your hearts can wish. But
where's my little chargeand how is she ?-
your pretty Maria."
They did not, of course, tell him exactly what
had become of her ; but answered that she had
merely left home for a day or two.
"Shiver my timbers !" said Carribles," but I'm
sorry she's not here. A sweet creature-I'll
make her happy, too : but come along, my good
people, we've no time to lose-come along."
Mrs. Marten made some excuse about her not
being sufficiently well drest, &c.; but the
pressing
and promising manner of the veteran was irre-
sistible.
Nonsense," said Carribles," nonsense. You
are quite well enoughjust as you ought to be,-
so come along. There's room enough in the chaise
for us three ; and there's my honest old shipmate,
To:n Squires, will ride outside, as convoy. Come
along, my dear peopleno time to lose."
So saying, he actually forced them into the
chaise-scarcely allowing the cld lady to put on
her best bonnet, or the old gentleman his Sunday
coat,all wonderment and puzzle, and then drove
off as rapidly as the horses could go.
When they arrived at old Carribles' cottage,
they alighted and entered : his housekeeper had,
by her master's directions, provided refreshment;
to which the old couple sat down, and partook of
heartily. Old Carribles had directed the chaise

driver to remain still in waiting; and all the
while Marten and his wife were refreshing them-
selves, he was rubbing his hands with the highest
glee imaginable.
"Yes, yes !" he would say, "I'll make you
right happy ; but we have to go a little farther yet.
I'll give you an agreeable surprise ;-you shall
see some one that but no! I must not tell
you yetthat would spoil all. D-n it, there's
nothing like making our fellow creatures happy-
when they deserve it."
The old people could not possibly tell what to
make of all this ; they were perfectly amazed and
confounded. But they forbore to ask any questions;
and knowing the kindheartedness of their host,
trusted themselves entirely to his conduct.
Now, my good friends," said he, "we must
just embark again for a short sail, -I will not
keep you much longer in suspense.
suspense. You will be
surprised, I can tell you."
Again they mounted into the chaise, and were
driven along a fine level road for about a mile or
two.  The chaise stopped at a gate which was
evidently the entrance to some rich domain. This
gate formed the centre of a semicircle of stone
work, with the usual architectural ornaments of
such entrances to country mansions; and all was
so thickly overshadowed with wood, that there
was no prospect beyond. The driver, by the
direction of Carribles, rang at the gate, which was
opened by a porter from an adjoining lodge. The

sun.
chaise drove in through the gate, and they pro-
ceeded on a winding gravel road through a thick
shady grove quite impervious to the rays of the
When they had got out of the grove, they
were saluted by the prospect of a fine, extensive,
gently sloping lawn, through which the road con-
tinued in a strait line to a splendid mansion,
situated on the highest part of this spacious lawn.
The house was very lofty, and built altogether of
free-stone, with a handsome portico, pillars in
front, and a double flight of white steps leading
up to the door.
Its situation and appearance
were equally imposing, and it commanded a fine
prospect of the adjacent country. The end of the
lawn, opposite the house, was bounded by low
hills very thickly wooded; on the left side it
was completely excluded from the road by a
continuation, in another direction, of the shady
grove through which they had passed; and on
the right was an open, unbounded, magnificent
prospect of the champaign country, with its
waving fields of green corn, its pastures of rich
clover, and its meadows of tall grass now courting
the sickle of the mower. The country here was
more rich than picturesque, as it wanted the
variation of hill and dale, wood and water ; but
it was a glorious exhibition of cultivation, industry,
wealth, comfort, and happiness. The sun shone
brightly above in the cloudless azure, in harmony
with the smiling scene below, while the deer were
skipping lightly over the smooth and numerous

535
lierbs, and flocks were scattered over the rich
pasture lands far and wide.
The chaise stopped at the foot of the steps:
Carribles and his companions got out, ascended,
and the Captain gave a loud knock at the
door. It was opened by an elderly and very
respectably looking male servant, who had not in
his countenance the slighest traces of that inso-
lence so proverbial, and, unhappily, too frequent,
among the pampered domestics of the rich. He
bowed respectfully to Captain Carribles, who
enquired,
"John, is your master at home ?"
"No, Sir; but he will return in a few minutes;
and he has given directions that, if you called, I
should request you to be good enough to wait."
The servant now showed Captain Carribles
and his two humble friends into a spacious and
magnificent apartment. It had four windows
on a level with the floor, looking out upon the
lawn: they were hung with curtains of the
richest crimson. The mahogany chairs were
ornamented with inlaid brass, and their cushions
were covered with red morocco. A large and
most beautiful round table occupied the centre of
the room; and a splendid book-case was on the
side opposite the windows, with green silk curtains
inside the glass. The mantelpiece was of the
whitest marble, covered with expensive ornaments,
and above it was a large and most magnificent

mirror : another of the same description was or
the opposite side of the room, and the floor was
covered with a rich Turkey carpet. In short,
every article of furniture announced at once both
the wealth and good taste of the proprietor.
The Martens were completely astonished : into
an apartment of such splendour they had
probably never before entered in the whole course
of their lives. Of such places, indeed, they had
heard descriptions, but the effect of seeing is very
different from that of hearing: their senses were
completely dazzled, and their understandings
overwhelmed. They thought to themselves that
this place must be the residence of some noble-
man, or, at the least, of the lord of the manor.
"Well, my old friend," said Carribles to
Marten;
" what do think of this place ?-snug
little box for a single gentleman-eh!"
"Lord, Sir!" replied old Marten, I was never
in so fine a place in all my born daysit is fit for
a king."
"It's not too good," said the Captain, "for the
princely fellow that owns it."
Scarcely had he uttered these last words, when
a gentleman, elegantly drest, entered the room :
he appeared about seven or eight and twenty.
He was above the middle heightof a light but
admirably turned figure : his features were very
handsome, and his complexion rather embrowned
by the influence, perhaps, of a warmer climate.
## p. 537 (#567) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
537
The expression of his countenance was a little
pensive, but it announced a feeling and reflective
character.
When he entered, Carribles arose in the most
abrupt and unceremonious manner, and took up
his hat.
"Now, Mr. and Mrs. Marten," said he, "I
leave
you and this gentleman together. I shall not
interrupt your conversation ; and I trust you will
soon be better acquainted."
On which the eccentric old Captain quitted
the room.
The Martens were quite overwhelmed with
confusion at being thus left in the presence of a
stranger, and of so fine a gentleman: they could
not utter a word, but stood in the most awk.
ward manner imaginable. At last, old Marten,
twiddling his thumbs, began to staminer out by
way of excuse, that he was brought there by
Captain Carribles-he knew not whyhoped no
offence to his honour, &c.
The stranger, who had hitherto remained silent,
eyeing them both with an agreeable and con-
templative smile, now said,
"Is it possible, Mr. Marten, that you don't
know me ?"
"I think, Sir," replied Marten, "I have seen
a face like yours, and I have heard a voice like
yours somewhere, but I don't know your person."
" Have, then," said the stranger, "a few short

years so altered him, that Harry Everton is not
known to his earliest friends ?"
"Good Heaven !" exclaimed the old couple;
" can it be?-is it possible, Sir; that you are

have any doubt about it, look here,"-pushing .
back his dark hair from the side of his forehead,
and showing them a very remarkable mark which
he had borne there from his infancy, and which
was quite familiar to them both.
Old Marten, on seeing this, exclaimed,
" It is, it is Harry Everton, indeed! but
you are so much changed that I did not know
you at first : you are so much darker, Henry, and
also stouter. Besides, how could I think of
meeting you in so fine a house as this is ?"
* True," said Harry; "but, my good friends,
I will soon explain all that to you. In the mean
time, let me ask you how is Maria ?"
"Very well," replied the mother; " she is
gone from home for a few days."
Well," said Everton, "my dear friends, I
have something very particular to talk to you
about; but, first of all, I'll tell you how I came
into the situation in which you see me. But,"
continued he, ringing the bell for the servant,
" we'll call in our worthy friend, Captain Carribles."
The Captain soon came; Harry called for some

ventures, the substance of which we shall
pre-
sent to the reader in our own words, as briefly as
possible.
When Harry Everton took leave of Captain
Carribles on the night, or rather morning, of the
rescue of Maria from Jackson, he of course joined
his regiment without delay. The corps soon
embarked for India, where Harry was very
speedily engaged in active service. He soon dis-
tinguished himself by the steadiness of his
conduct, his attention to duty, and rapid improve-
ment in military discipline, but, above all, by his
courage and intrepidity in the hour of danger.
Thus attracting the notice and approbation of
his officers, he was soon raised to the rank of
serjeant.
In this situation he acquitted himself with the
utmost credit; he was beloved by the men and
respected by the officers. His manners,
His manners, and ap-
pearance, and education, were so far above the
level of his comrades, as to constitute an object of
attention even to his Colonel; and a service
which he rendered to the latter, proved the
cause of his further advancement.
Even private soldiers in India, as is well known,
have a large portion of leisure time on their
hands, except when engaged in actual warfare.
They have their native attendants, and the situa-
tion of a non-commissioned officer among them
has advantages beyond that of a subaltern in

Europe. The leisure that Harry thus obtained
he devoted to the best purposes, namely, the
study of his profession and the general improve-
ment of his mind. He read much, and, among
other pursuits, applied himself to obtain a know-
ledge of the language of the country, in which he
soon made so great a proficiency as to be enabled
to understand and speak it with no small facility.
Colonel Oswald had, of course, a number of
native attendants in his service. The natives of
India are, in general, men of great fidelity, much
to be depended upon, and, when treated with
kindness, susceptible of a very strong attachment;
but, on the contrary, if offended or injured, are
exceedingly inveterate and revengeful. This is
particularly the case when their religious preju-
dices happen to be shocked,
stitious observances become the subject of
derision. It is for such indignity they bear a
deep and lasting hatred against their Mussulman
conquerors.
Colonel Oswald had two servants whom he
unfortunately, though unintentionally, offended
He happened to do something
or other which proved the means to these men of
losing caste, as it is termed. This inspired in them
a rooted malignity and a determined spirit of
vengeance, and they resolved to seize the first
opportunity of assassinating the Colonel.
Before they had an opportunity of executing
this intention, one of them died suddenly. The

other, however, did not relinquish the design,
but determined to perform it alone. There is
nothing to which an Hindoo is more indifferent
than death. This man thought nothing of sacri-
ficing his life for the gratification of his revenge ;
and indeed the loss of caste made him wish for
destruction, as soon as his vengeance should be
satisfied.
Accordingly, one morning as the Colonel was
walking alone at a little distance from his quarters,
this man came behind him for the purpose of
stabbing him with a crees, or dagger. It was the
first opportunity that he had of finding the Colonel
unattended, and, as he thought, remote from any
assistance; but scarcely had the assassin raised
his arm to strike the fatal blow, when a sword
was passed directly through his own body, and
he fell prostrate on the earth. The Colonel turned
round, and beheld the lifeless Hindoo, and
Serjeant Everton withdrawing his faithful wea-
pon from his body. Harry had observed the
native following the Colonel with his drawn
dagger, and knew the fact of his having lost caste
He instantly conjectured what he was about,
pursued him with the rapidity of lightning, and
just got up in time to save the life of bis com-
manding officer.
The Colonel's gratitude to Harry for this service
was so great, that he immediately exerted all the
interest of which he was master, and procured
for the young man an ensigncy in his own corps,
## p. 542 (#572) ############################################
542
THE RED BARN.
The regiment was soon after this affair sent to
Calcutta. The Colonel continued his patronage
of Everton, and, in spite of the fastidious feelings
entertained too generally in British regiments
against deserving officers raised from the ranks,
Harry became an exception to the operation of
this prejudice. Against so decided a favourite of
the commanding officer this feeling was not likely
to exhibit itself strongly; but, independently of
that, so gentlemanlike were the manners, so
respectable the entertainments, and so high the
reputation for courage, of our young Ensign, that
on his own account alone he was highly esteemed
and respected by the entire corps.
Everton was a constant guest at the private
parties of the Colonel, which were always attended
by some of the first military and civil characters
in Calcutta. It so happened that, on one of these
occasions, a gentleman was introduced of his own
This gentleman had, for many years,
filled, with great credit to himself, a number of
offices in the civil department in India, and had
amassed a large fortune. Struck with the identity
of name, he entered into conversation with Harry,
and questioned him closely as to his family and
the place of his nativity: Harry told him ingenu-
ously every circumstance respecting them. The
conversation ended by the old man folding him in
his arms, and saluting him by the title of nephew!
The facts of the case were briefly these :
Harry's father and this gentleman were the only
name.

W sons of a respectabie farmer living near
Yarmouth. The youngest of these sons, Harry's
uncle, was a wild lad, and, when very young, had
run away to sea, and his relations never heard
any
more about him. Harry's father, on the death
of his own parents, had removed to Polstead,
where he settled and married : his brother, by a
series of fortunate incidents, had arrived to the
possession of the rank and property which he en-
joyed. He wrote many times to his family in
England, when he began to thrive in the world;
but, in consequence of the removal of his brother,
the letters never came to hand : Harry's father
had, therefore, long concluded that his brother
was no more.
The first inquiry made by Harry's uncle, was
whether his brother was still living. To this
Harry replied in the negative. When he left
England his father was alive; and such was the
fidelity of this most excellent son, that even
while a non-commissioned officer he contrived, by
economy, to save money, and had remitted several
sums to his father, which were duly received
through the hands of a banker in Suffolk. In
answer, however, to his last letters, Harry, then
an officer, was informed by this agent that his
father had died some time before, that the small
farm which he rented of course reverted to the
proprietor, and the very small personal property he
was worth did little more than suffice to pay the

expenses of his funeral. Harry's mother had
died several years before.
His uncle now grew more and more attached
to him every day. Mr. Everton was a very
worthy man, but not without his prejudices.
One of these was a strong dislike to the profession
of arms,not that he had any aversion towards
the members of the army as gentlemen, but he
disapproved of the pursuit for a young man. He
made his will in favour of Harry, but it was on
this conditionthat he should quit the army.
This the latter consented to, though with some
regret; nor was his Colonel less concerned at
losing him as an officer, nor his brother-officers
as a companion in arms: soon after, his uncle
died and left him in possession of a very large
fortune.
Harry, who had now nothing to detain him from
his native country, determined to return to it.
India, though the place for making fortunes, seems
not to be the best one for their enjoyment. In-
dependently of that consideration, however, there
was another thought which, in Harry's present
circumstances, would have induced him to return
to England.
That thought wasMaria! Never, during his
absence, had he forgotten or ceased to love her:
her cherished image was ever present to his mind
in all his wanderings and changes of fortune, anu
no other could supersede it. Her own ill-treat-

545
ment of him, time, distance, nothing could banish
it; and now the favourable change in his circum-
stances induced him to encourage the idea that,
if she were still single, she might yet listen to his
addresses. He piqued himself on the opportunity
thus afforded him of showing the permanence and
strength of his attachment, and the disinterested
character of his passion.
Full of this idea, Harry, after making all
necessary arrangements respecting his property,
took his passage on board a vessel bound for
England. When he arrived in London, he found
that of necessity he must be detained there some
time in the regulation of his affairs. lie wrote
to his agent in Suffolk to make, if possible, a
purchase of an estate and residence for him in that
county. The latter succeeded in doing so; and
Harry, by one of those extraordinary coincidences
that so often happen, arrived at his new and
splendid mansion on the very day on which the
unfortunate Maria was murdered in the Red Barn,
by the monster, William Barnard.
Almost immediately after his arrival, Harry
called on Captain Carribles. The latter was ab-
solutely in ecstasies, when he learned the good
fortune of his yound friend and preserver. Harry
told him of his feelings and intentions respecting
Maria, if she were still disengaged. The old
Captain shook him by the hand, swore that he
was an honest fellow, and made the proposal that
he should himself go up to Polstead, for the pur-

pose of surprising the family in the manner we
have described.. This is the brief history of
Harry Everton's good fortune.
" Now, my good friends," said Harry, when he
had concluded the narrative of his adventures,
" here you see I am, in possession of all that
wealth can bestow upon me; but one only thing
is wanting to my happiness. If Maria be still
unmarried, and can think of a man who has loved
her so long and so sincerely as I have, I am ready
to bestow upon her all my fortune, and to devote
the remainder of my life to make her happy."
Old Marten and his wife remained silent, and
looked at each other with saduess in their faces.
"What! my dear friends," said Harry; you
don't speak. My heart misgives me ;--she is
married, then ?"
"Oh! Mr. Everton," replied the mother, "she
went to be married yesterday !"
"Then," said Everton, "all my hopes are
blasted for ever! I had thoughtsomething had
told me that we might have yet been happy;--
it was all delusion :-but the will of heaven be
done !"
" Well !" said Carribles, "this is the most pro-
voking thing I ever knew : I had made up my
mind to see the young people happy-I hate to
see any one otherwise ;-I saw them when they
last parted, and 
"Last parted, Sir?" said old Marten.

" It is a melancholy thing," said Marten, looking
at his wife. (Little
Little the poor father knew how
melancholy it was !)
" Indeed it is, Thomas," replied the latter.
" To whom," said Carribles; " to whom, in the
Lord's name, is she gone to be married ?-to that
scamp, Jackson-eh?"
" Oh no! Sir," replied the mother; "to a young
man named Barnard."
Barnard !" said Everton; "I knew him. The
last man on earth I could have wished to be her
husband : indeed, I warned her against him before
I left the country."
"Oh!" said the mother," he is much changed
for the better; and I hope he will make her a
good husband."
"I hope so too," said Everton, with a deep sigh,
"I had much rather Mr. Everton had been her
husband," said old Marten.
" So had I," said the mother.
" And so had I, ten million of times," said
Carribles, "though I know nothing at all about
the other."

" Well, well," said Harry, " let us say no more
of this ;-I wish her happiness, with all my heart
and soul. May she never have cause to regre

The old people now took their leaveHarry
having first made each of them an appropriate
present. Carribles saw them into the chaise, ,
gave the driver directions to take them back to
Polstead, and call at his house, on his return, for
the fare. He then shook hands with them, saying,
"Good bye, my old friends; I hope that youth,
whoever he be, will prove kind to poor Maria : if
he should not, he will deserve to be hanged."
It may be well imagined that the reflections of
the old fold folks, as they returned home, were
not the most agreeable : they regretted much
the loss that their daughter experienced of such a
husband as Harry Everton. But their feelings
were somewhat different : the mother considere
the matter in a worldly point of view, and was
grieved that matters had so far gone with Bar-
nard ; and, had it been in her power, would have
broken off the match : she thought, if that had
been done, nothing would remain but to marry
Maria to Harry Everton, But the father tnought

yery differently: he did not so much esteem
Harry's fortune, as he did Harry himself. He
regretted that they had not been married in the
first instance, and that his daughter had no:
secured so amiable a husband, although he would
not, perhaps, have ever been so rich; but he felt
that, after her connexion with Jackson and Bar-
nard, it would be neither just, nor fair, nor
honourable, for him to sanction a union between

The first impressions in the mind of the
olood-stained Barnard, after the perpetration of his
accursed deed, were horrible; nor did they soon
give way to the natural callousness and depravity
of his disposition : he was disturbed-distracted
-agitated-absent. He went home in the
evening. Had the slightest suspicion existed of
what had been done, his behaviour must have
betrayed him. To the questions put to him by
his family, he replied incoherently. He went
out again after nightfall, for he did not dare to go
to bed,the idea of that filled him with terror.
As he walked along, he shook like an aspen at
every breath of wind, and started at every bush
as if it were an officer or a ghost.
He resolved to try that resource which is so often

551
flown to by the wretched, the remorseful, the
guilty, and which may create temporary oblivion,
though it can never remove the cause of their
sufferings. He walked some distance, and
entered a very low public-house on the road : he
was afraid to show himself at the " Cock" that
evening, lest he might be recognized by some of
the townspeople. By himself, miserable, in a
little room, he sat and drank, glass after glass, of
brandy-and-water with the utmost rapidity ;
but no effect like intoxication ensued. His mind
was in no state for that,--there was too strong a
counteracting principle at work within him. ID
some states of bodily distemper, inebriating
liquors may be drunk to a great extent without
producing their usual and natural effect. It is
the same way when the mind is diseased : grief,
remorse, despair, counteract intoxication, as cer-
tainly as typhus, spasm, or vascular inaction.
But the liquor, which did not intoxicate Barnard,
removed his nervous agitation : he began to reflect
that he had secured himself as far as possible
against the chance of discovery. There was no
living being aware of his guilt: the place, the
time, in which the crime was perpetrated, could
never be suspected. For the concealment of the
body he had done all that, at present, could be
done; the key of the Barn was in his pos-
session, and none could enter there without his
permission. That key he resolved not to let out
of his hands for some time.
## p. 552 (#582) ############################################

Thus he flattered himself ;-no eye had seen
him perform the bloody deed. Wretched man!
an eye had seen him that never winks,-the all-
seeing eye of everlasting justice. There was no
tongue to tell of his misdeeds. Mistaken fool! -
-Murder, though it bath no tongue,
Will speak with most miraculous organs."
He thought himself secure from panishment; but
he was already marked out by the unerring
hand of almighty vengeance. He should escape,
he thought, the trial and condemnation that
awaited him at the bar of his country. He was
a ready tried and condemned at the bar of Heaven!
He, at first, had felt the impulse to fly-to quit
Polstead as soon as possible; but he now altered
that resolution. To go immediately might excite
suspicion ;-he would remain until harvest time,
and see the Barn well filled--the grave weli
covered ; then depart, and rest perfectly secure,
as he thought, from all detection.
Having eased his mind very considerably by
this train of reflection, he continued to drink on
until his thoughts acquired a sort of demoniac
elevation. He had now, as he fancied, securely
removed the great obstacle to his future prosperity,
and a splendid vista of fortune was opened to his
infatuated vision. He possessed, in spite of his
personal defects, a large portion of vanity; and
he looked forward with hope, and confidence, to
the prospect of a matrimniai connexion which

laouia establish him capitally in life: through the
cleverness of Hannah, he thought he could not
fail of succeeding. As for her, he proposed to con-
tinue his connexion with her as long as his interest
dictated its continuance; and when it should
become inconvenient, to cut it short in his own
neat way.
Barnard continued his deep potations until long
past midnight; and now, being firmly nerved and
much exhilarated, but still reluctant to go to bed,
he resolved to visit Hannah in Smith's cottage.
Accordingly he left the public house and proceeded
thither. Late as it was, Hannah had not retired
to rest. She was in the habit of taking but little
sleep: her restless, ambitious, scheming, disap-
pointed mind kept her perpetually sleepless.
She was seated, reading, with a single palo
light burning on the table.
The old hag was
stretched on a pallet, in a corner, fast asleep.
The fire was nearly out, and shed a faint light c!)
all around.
"Ha! Barnard !" exclaimed she, at his entrance
" and at this late hour ?"
" Yes!" replied he; "what are hours to us?
I have gone through much business to-day, but I
could not sleep."
"I am in want of money," said Hannah.
"Take my purse, then," said he, finging it on
the table.
" William," said she, "I must still reproacl: you

with delay. You are tardy: you procrastinate
your fortune."
"I cannot help it at present, Hamah,here I
must stop for some time longer. I cannot yet
raise sufficient money."
" That girlthat girl !" said Hannah.
Name her no more !" cried Barnard, with a
smile of infernal exultation ; "she is disposed of
- she will trouble us no more."
"What!" said Hannah," is she dead ?"
"Dead !" echoed Barnard, starting; "no! she
is not dead she was alive when I last saw her;
but she has gone a long journey."
"Well, well, Barnard, I ask you no questions
about her, I have no impertinent female curiosity.
She may be dead or living for aught I care; but it
18 your business to provide that she interfere with
you no more.
" Make yourself easy about that," said the
ruffian ; " she is safe enough, I assure you.
But
Let us talk no more about her: I will get out of
this as soon as I can muster the means; but I
must stop until the harvest is got in."
" Why?" said Hannah ; "you can get money
enough to go up to London before then, and try
our plan of advertising. You can return, you
know, at the harvest time."
"No, no !" said he, "impossible-I must stay
here. My presence here is indispensable."
They then had some further conversation re-

specting the matrimonialscheme, which continued
until the first rays of morning broke through the
little windows of the cottage. He then returned
home, threw himself on his bed, and through sheer
fatigue slept soundly for two hours.
The following night, Barnard ventured to go to
bed at his usual hour; but he passed a night of
tremendous horror. Scarcely had he closed his
eyes, when the image of the murdered Maria
stood before him : he awaked, streaming with
perspiration and paralyzed by fear, and fancied
that he saw her still. She appeared to his ima-
gination in a standing posture, but with the
fixed and horrible aspect with which he saw her
after her fall from the pistol-bullet. He arose,
walked about, opened the window, and made a
strong effort to dispel his imaginary terrors, and
to calm his agitated mind. He succeeded in
some degree, and lay down again, but not to
sleep: the excitement had been too great. He
tossed from side to side all night upon his feverish
bed-his mind agitated by dreadful thoughts
Sleep seldom came to his pillow, and when it did,
it was but to torture him with horrid visions.
On the following day, however, which was
Sunday, Barnard had wonderfully got the better
of bis agitation, and soon quite re-assumed his
habitual coolness and self-command. At nine
o'clock on that morning, he mustered sufficient
effrontery to call upon the Martens. He found
the mother only at home, who immediately

656

questioned him, on his appearance, as to what he
had done with Maria, and whether they were yet
married ? He replied in the negative to the latter
part of the question ; saying that, on their arrival
at Ipswich, he had got a licence, but he found
that it was necessay it should go to London to be
signed, and that they could not possibly be married
in less than a month or six weeks. As for Maria,
he told her mother that he had consigned her to
the care of a female relative of his own, who
resided at Yarmouth, whither they were now gone.
He had supplied her, he stated, with money; and
she was, in all respects, as comfortable as could
possibly be desired. To her mother's observation
that Maria, during her absence, might possibly
want the rest of her clothes which were at the
cottage, he replied that his cousin would supply
her with every requisite in the way of dress.
As long as Barnard remained at Polstead, he
was in the habit of continually seeing the Martens,
-even sometimes two or three times a-day. This
was no small argument of the callous, cold blooded
cast of the villain's character. How he could con-
tinue in the same scenes where he had so often
wandered with the unfortunate Maria, pouring
false vows of love into her too credulous ears
how he could calmly look on the countenances of
the parents whose child he had basely murdered, -
may seem inexplicable to those whom nature has
ifted with feelings of humanity, and in whom
cucation has produced a becoming horror of

557
crime. But experience and observation teach
vs, that when a certain point has been passed so
the career of villany, every natural feeling
becomes seared or perverted, and the whole man
is metamorphosed into the demon. No feelings, in
fact, remain, but such as are founded on the most
sordid modification of brutal selfishness.
During this time, Barnard invariably used to
tell the unsuspecting parents that Maria was
well, and living most comfortably with his cousin.
He would occasionally leave Polstead for a day
or two, and say that he had been with Maria,
who continued in excellent health. He meant,
he said, to bring her home at Michaelmas to his
mother's farm, and openly acknowledge her as bis
lawful wife.
The mother would frequently express her sur-
prise, that Maria never wrote to her or to her
father. For this, Barnard framed a variety of
excuses. At one time she was too busy to write at
another, she was incapacited from doing so, by
an accident, which temporarily deprived her of
the use of her hand. He was always ready with
some pretext or other, which sufficed to impose
upon the slight discrimination and easy credulity
of the rustic parents.
When the harvest was ripe for gathering in,
Barnard busied himself most actively about it.
The key of the Red Barn had never been for a
moment out of his possession, from the period of
the murder up to this time. He now opened the

Barn, and assisted himself in placing the corn
there,-a thing be had never been known to de
before. That bay of the Barn where the body
had been buried, was the part first filled; and
Barnard took especially on himself the principal
part of that operation. He placed the ground-
work of straw, with the utmost care and accuracy,
and had that portion of the Barn filled as full as
it could possibly hold ; thus, thought he, I am
secure. I shall now quit Polstead, and sleep in
peace. Alas ! how insecure is guilt! Little thought
be that mountains cannot cover it from the eye of
retribution.
That the worm of conscience was secretly
preying on this wretch, in spite of his callous
disposition and assumed calmness, was evident
from many circumstances. That retributory power
never sleeps; it will pursue the criminal, when
human law and justice lag behind. Often did
Barnard, writhing under its lash, contemplate
suicide ; and nothing but a still iingering thought
of hereafter prevented his consummating it.
He now thought that he was completely secure:
the Barn was filled the corn would remain there
many monthsthe body would soon become
thoroughly decomposed, so as, even in case of it
being accidentally taken up, to defy all chance
of recognition: therefore, having raised all the
money he possibly could, amounting to four or five
hundred pounds, he made all preparations for his
immediate journey to London,

559
ile went to Hannah, and made his arrange-
ments with her. It was agreed that she should
precede him to the metropolis ; and an address
was fixed there, where they should meet on his
arrival.
Barnard kept up his systematic, hypocritical
effrontery to the last. When he was about to
depart, he came to the cottage to take his leave
of the old people. He told them, that he was
now going down to the water-side to marry
Maria ; that everything was settled; he had
obtained, after much entreaty, the sanction of his
mother to the match ; and that they should shortly
see their beloved daughter, as his lawful wife,
living with him at his own farm. In corrobora-
tion of this, he had the assurance to exhibit to
them a gold ring, which, he said, was to be the
wedding-ring on the occasion.
On his arrival in London, he had an interview
with Hannah, and they drew up an advertisement
between them, which was inserted in one of
the morning papers. Strange to relate, he was
soon favoured with a number of replies. This
readiness to pick up a husband anywhere, or
on any terms-to rush blindly into the matri-
monial state with a person of whom they could
know nothing,-speaks more in favour of the
disposition of the ladies of the metropolis to
lawful wedlock, than of their prudence or
discrimination.
The replies were submitted to Hannah, who

selected from them a few addresses, and en-
deavoured to get access to the fair writers,-
this took up a little time and trouble; and while
she was thus employed, Barnard was amusing
himself in town.
He plunged into dissipation of every kind, with
a view of escaping from reflection The chief
source of his uneasiness was not so much repen-
tance, or any touches of remorse for his grievous
guilt, as vague apprehensions and fears of dis-
covery, which would still haunt him at times in
spite of the precautions he had taken; and also
certain terrors of punishment in another world,
which, notwithstanding the course of philosophy
he had studied under Carlile, would sometiines
prove very unpleasant intruders into his bosom.
To drown these feelings he had recourse to the
bowl; and in the midnight and riotous conviviality
of ruffians like himself, or in the loveless arms of
some hireling prostitute, he would seek a tem-
porary oblivion from bis torments. But outraged
Nature still asserted her right, and the scorpion
whip of conscience was exerted ever and anon
with unrelenting severity. Sleep seldom rested
on his "penthouse lids;" and when it did so, it
was only to bring with it a train of ghastly images
and fearful forebodings. He flew from place to
place, and from pleasure to pleasure, in vain.
He could find no medicine to rid him of the worm
within, or to allay its secret, deep-felt gnawings.
-He could not escape from himself

In the turmoil of society and dissipation, he
could mask his feelings with outrageous levity,
and contrive for the moment to be callous to
them. But when alone, all his misdeeds would
rise in array before him,-his unprincipled profii:

" His conscience bad a thousand several topguos,

Among his other peregrinations, he called
secretly on his friend Beauty Smith, now under
sentence of transportation. Him he found changed
indeed from what he had been. His well made
and muscular form had lost its roundness and
expression of strength and activity. Long impri-
sonment and uneasiness of mind had worn him to
the bones. His dark eye had lost all its fierce-
ness and its fire, and his bold front no longer
exhibited the tameless audacity of his spirit.
Care had engraven its deep characters on is
contracted brow, and reckless desperation had
given way to gnawing regret. Yet was his lot
enviable in comparison to that of Barnard. There
was hope for him yet. He was no murderer!
His crimes were manifold, but his soul was not
stained with the blood of the innocent. He was

bound, he might atone, by a life of integrity and
good conduct, for all the past. He might become
new man, and a useful member of society.

the best policy. Banished for life, for such a

speaking to you, Barnard, for the last time in my
life; for though I may live many years, I do not
think we shall ever meet again. To-morrow I am
to be removed for embarkation : hear me, therefore,
as you would hear the voice of a dying man.
Take warning ;-leave off our old courses, pursue
a steady path of industry, marry Mari, and you
will be happy! Would I had done so by poor
Ellen in proper time!"
Every word of Smith's sunk like a dagger into
the heart of Barnard ; and, at the name of Maria,
he started, trembled, and turned deadly pale.
They soon parted for ever, and the unfortunate
but not totally hopeless Smith was shipped in a
few days for the Antipodes.
Yet another interview awaited Barnard, to
stimulate his conscience into tormenting action,
and wound him deeply. In the course of his
wanderings through scenes of vice and profligacy,
he bent his course one night to that temple of
infamy, the oyster-shop opposite Drury Lane
Theatre. There, where the gaudy prostitute
covers with the vain splendors of dress a broken
heart, or a ruined constitution, like a tomb
covered with garlands of flowers, or the app.e of
the Dead Sea shore, fair without, but ashes and
bitterness within,--he was about to enter; when
one of these unfortunate creatures, who, from the
meanness of their attire, will not be permitted to
come within that "sanctum sanctorum ," but who,

arm and solicited his assistance,
Barnard was
about to shake her rudely off, in the brutal, un-
feeling manner so characteristic of the swell
gentlemen of London, when, by the lamp-light,
be recognized her features.-It was Ellen, the
chre amie of Smith-the unfortunate cousin of
Maria!
"Oh! William Barnard," exclaimed she, hiding
her face and bursting into tears; "co I live that
you should see me thus?"
She was pale, wan, and wretchedly dressed
the picture of disease, broken heartedness, and
misery--the mere wreck of a London prostitute.
Her figure had lost all its attractions, which had
been very considerable; and her features, naturally
plain, had assumed the sharp outline which is
produced by fatigue, and want, and mental
suffering. Oh! how unlike the healthy, lively,
thoughtless girl, that had accompanied Maria on
the first visit of the former to the Red Barn!
Even the soul of Barnard was touched at the
appearance of this miserable victim of " Life in
London." But when she inquired after Maria,
and expressed her hopes that she, at least, would
never experience such a wretched fate as her
own, the murderer started back with horror
chrust some money into her hand, and hurried
away from her, to hide his head in some low den
of vice, and steep his senses in the oblivion of
ebriety.

Hannah had now succeeded in gaining admission
to two or three young ladies, who had answered
the advertisement of Barnard; and she had
worked considerably on them, in the character
of a fortune-teller. She informed them that they
were to be married to a man exactly of the per-
sonal appearance of Barnard, of which, without
departing too much from truth, she yet gave a
flattering description. On the excellence of his
disposition, she dilated more considerably, and
with much less regard to truth. She stated him
to be an independent gentleman, moderately rich;
and, above all, she particularly mentioned that
they would meet through the medium of an ad-
vertisement in the papers.
This was quite sufficient. Each of them then
separately confessed to Hannah that they had
answered an advertisement of this description,
which they had seen some days previously in the
papers. Their answers, they said, had, however,
been merely those of inquiry as to the person
advertising, &c. Hannah urged them to make
decided appointments to see the advertiser, and
offered herself to undertake the management of
them in such a manner that their delicacy should
be in no wise compromised. They consented to
this, and Hannah now came to report progress to
her worthy employer.
These appointments were kept; but the two
first were attended with no satisfactory resul-

appointment of a heartless ruffian, and the escape
of two innocent though foolish women, an up-
satisfactory result. The first of these was a
widow, with only a moderate life annuity, which
Barnard discovered was not at her own disposal :
this he did not conceive would suit him, and so he
broke off the negociation. The second was a young
lady of good expectations, but who, the moment
she beheld the countenance of the advertiser, had
the good taste to declare off in spite of her pre-
dilection in favour of the occult sciences : it might,
she thought, be her destiny to marry a man who
had advertised in the papers, but it could not be
her destiny to marry so evil looking a fellow as
Barnard. In the third instance, however, he proved
more successful. A young lady, possessed of a
considerable sum of money, in her own control
and living with her mother, met him according to
appointment: they were mutually pleased with
each other, and had several meetings. At last,
everything was arranged between them; and in
an evil hour, a respectable, virtuous, well-educated
young lady gave her hand at the altar to a man
whom, had she known, she would have found to
have been guilty of theft, frgery, and murder,-
one in whom all the feelings which redeem human
nature from detestation and contempt were utterly
annihilated, and in whose bosom nothing reigned
predominant but sordid varice and brutal sen-
suality

rational man could ever bring himself to believe
that marriages could be brought about in such a
manner as this, or that matrimonial advertisements
were ever anything more than waggish and mis-
chievous " jeux d'esprits?" Who could suppose
that any woman of the most ordinary degree of
sense or reflection, after being introduced to a
man through such a medium, and on three week's
acquaintance, would entrust her fortune and the
happiness of her life in his keeping? But the fact
is, the evil does not arise from the want of sense
on the part of the other sex, so much as from the
in hospitable system of exclusion practised by the
generality of families in London. There is a
difficulty of access into private society here for
any man, unless he belong to the immediate
circle of family connexions. By this, the ac-
quisition of many valuable acquaintances is lost;
while, on the other hand, the personal freedom
enjoyed by the younger members of families, of
either sex, enables them to form improper con-
nexions abroad. Greater general freedom of
admission would be better policy: the bad would
be thus detected, by the superior discernment and
experience of heads of families, and soon got rid
of, while the worthy would be cherished. Ac-
quaintances that would not be allowed at home,
are met with abroad, and cultivated simply
because there are
re no acquaintances to be met
with at home. We would say to the heads of

corruption of the former by swindlers and

BARNARD was now settled as a married man,
and filled a station of respectability in the middle
class of life. A station far, indeed, beyond his
deserts : but his profound hypocrisy enabled him
to succeed in establishing a character for steadiness,
sound principles, and good feelings, among the
connexions of his wife, as he had done before in
the country among his own. His acting was as
consummate here as it had been there: his wife
became passionately attached to him, and he
became a high favourite with all her relatives.
During all this time, we must observe that
Barnard wrote different letters for the purpose of
cajoling the old people at Polstead. In one he
informed old Marten that he had married his
daughter, and expressed his surprise at no answer

having been sent to a letter of hers, describing
the same occurrence. At another time he wrote,
that business had called him to London, and
that he was about to take Maria to the Isle of
Wight, and that he had made inquiries at the
post-office about her last letter, &c. In this
manner he continued to amuse the parents of the
murdered girl for many months,-hoping, by this
means, to lull suspicion and prevent inquiry,
until such time as no search or discovery could be
dangerous to him.
Meanwhile his friend Hannah still remained
a burthen on his hands. Her he was obliged to
support, in fulfilment of his contract; and because
he still held her in some degree of awe. How-
ever, he soon grew tired of advancing money to
her, as she could no longer be of any use to him,
and very in patient of the sort of check which
he fancied she held over his free agency. He
would not, however, attempt to rid himself of her
in the way that he had of
poor
Maria ; he resolved,
for the future, to keep his hands clear of all
offences of that kind ; but, as he could not remove
Hannah, he determined to remove himself: and
as no particular business now detained him in
London, he set off, with his wife, to the Isle of
Wight, without making the least previous com-
munication of his movements to his guardian
mistress.
When Hannah, on inquiry, found that he had
departed in this manner, she was excessively

571
enraged. She could not attribute the step he had
taken to any motive but that of getting free from
her solicitations.
In a day or two, however, she received from
him one of those Machiavelian letters, which
he so well understood how to write. Therein he
declared, that in consequence of his wife's fortune
being so situated, that he could not touch the
principal at once, he was reduced to sudden
embarrassments. That he had been discovered
by some of his old creditors, and was obliged to
quit London with precipitation, to avoid being
arrested. He, therefore, was quite unable for
the present to supply her with money; but he
promised that as soon as he could bring his
affairs into any thing like a proper train, she
should have at least 200.
Hannah was a woman of too much penetration
to be imposed on by shallow devices of this
kind. She also knew her man too well for that.
She had herself contributed to the developement
of his talents, and the progress of his education
and she could pretty well appreciate his capabilities
of imposing, and the depth of his sincerity. She
saw clearly that,--to use a vulgar term,-his
object was to "cut her completely;" and she was
fully determined that he should not do so, without
very serious consequences to himself.
There was another feeling which acted in
conjunction with disappointed interest, to stimulate
her desire of vengeance. Hannah, notwithstand-

ing the masculine cast of her understanding, and
her want of the usual tender susceptibilities of
her sex, was, after all, a woman. Now, though
she had never loved Barnard, and though all
intercourse of any tender kind had so long ceased
between them, yet she could not divest herself
of something like a sentiment of jealousy about
him. It was pride, that was wounded and offended
at the idea that any other woman should possess
the place which she once held. She had enter-
tained this feeling respecting Maria; and from
this, as much as any other cause, had she been
urgent with Barnard to put an end to that
connexion. She was, also, the more galled by
this idea, from her present situation; for her
faded charms, and want of money to call in the
assistance of art to repair them, placed her in a
predicament where she could hope neither for
equivalent nor retaliation.
She was sitting one night in a miserable apart-
buent which she occupied, in a court off Drury
Lane, brooding over schemes of vengeance with
regard to Barnard, when a loud knock was heard
at her door. She called out to the person to come in;
and a man entered the apartment, in appearance
thin, pale, haggard, and not very well dressed
With all this, however, there was an air of com-
manding superiority about hiin, that marked him,
even to the superficial observer, as no common
man. Intelligence and resolution wer, written

looked the wreck of something that had been high
and noble.
Hannah looked at him, and beheld with astonish-
ment the ruin of Stafford Jackson !
Nor was his surprise at her appearance, an
atom less. They stared at each other a moment
without speaking, when the following ejaculations
burst simultaneously from their lips :-
" Hannah !"
" Jackson !"
Yes," said he; " it is Jackson: doubtless I
am altered much, if in your appearance I may
see any reflection of my own."
" Times are changed with me Jackson," said
Hannab, "and doubtless with
you
"They are," said he ; "but notwithstanding
that, and the change in our persons, our minds
remain the same ; at least mine does.'
"And mine," said Hannah : "but, Jackson, how
did
you
find out this wretched place ?"
" I'll tell you," said he, sitting down.-"On my
first arrival I went to look for Creed: but him
I was unable to find. I learned, however, that
he was obliged, some time since, to fly to America,
with scarcely any property, that he might escape
the hands of justice. Some say that he had com-
mitted forgery; but I cannot think that a man of
his peculiar caution could so lay himself open.
However, be that as it may, he felt it necessary
to run for his safety."

"I am sorry for him," said Hannah ; "he was
a man of wit, intelligence, and judgment."
" He was," said Jackson ; "and, what was
better than that, he was a kind and generous
friend. It is true, his notion of meum and tuum
were not quite orthodox; but it is no part o
ours to find fault with him for that. Not being
able to find him, I next sought after you."
"How did you find me?" said Hannah.
? Through a girl that lived with you, when
Barnard and you were together, and whom I
met accidentally."
" But how comes it, Jackson, that you are so
much reduced ?"
" Disastrous fortun, and, let me add, time;
I am not what I was. Hope no longer can
inspire me to deeds of enterprise. My spirits
are no longer buoyant and elastic. But I am
reckless of the future, and desperation shall
supply the place of hope."
"But," said Hannah, "speak the particulars."
My fortunes are completely ruined ; my com-
panions all killed or taken. I alone have escaped,
with just sufficient money for a few days."
What led to all this?"
" In brief, I'll tell you. When I escaped to
Ostend, after the rascals, Smith and Barnard, had
betrayed me (of which you, of course, have heard),
I had a tolerable sum of money. With this, I
commenced business ; and travelling through the

entire of the Belgique, proved rather successful.
I went to Brussels after, where there was a run
of fortune against me. I, however, saved enough
from the wreck, and went to Flushing, where I
joined Warren and our crew. We then made
several successful trips; but our last expedition
was fatal."
" How was that?"
" Thus :We purchased a new vessel, our old
one being no longer sea-worthy; expended all
our money on the cargo, which was very valuable,
-and, had all things gone right, we should have
been independent for life, and might have relin-
quished our dangerous pursuits. We pushed over
for the western coast of England, from Brittany.
It was the commencing dusk of the evening when
land appeared; the breeze was favourable, and
we had every prospect of landing safely, near
Penzance, in a secret creek, where we had fre-
quently harboured before. I was on deck, cheer-
fully conversing with poor Warren, when the man
at the forecastle cried out, "A sail, a sail !'"
" What was this?"
" You shall hear : I ran forward, took my glass,
and very plainly descried a revenue cutter bearing
down upon us.
We clapped all sails to, and
bore away before the wind. But she was the
better sailer, and soon coming within range of shot,
fired from a swivel into our stern."
What followed ?"
" I saw there was no further use in attempting

to escape.My lads,' said I, we must fight it
out; only remember that your lives and fortunes
depend upon your courage.' I was answered by
a shout, and we discharged a volley of small-arms
into the cutter; this was returned, and the action
now became very warm. Our fellows fought like
lions, but the enemy were too much for us."
" I wonder that the night did not favour your
escape."
Impossible ;they were too close to us. Four
of our men fell at the second volley. Poor
Warren"
" What of him ?"
"A musket-ball took him down,' close by my
side. He exclaimed, Jackson, I am killed--it is
all over with us-escape
escape if you can.Thank God,
I die on my native element.'-I stooped down to
raise the poor fellow, but he was gone for ever."
" And how did you escape ?"
" They now boarded us. There were only three
of us remaining,myself and two others. One
of them was soon disabled ; the other said to me,
*For God's sake, Mr.Jackson, let us save ourselves;
follow my example;'-so saying, the brave fellow
plunged into the waves,whether he sunk, to rise
no more, or escaped, I know not."
- And you followed him ?"
" I was on the gunwale of the forecastle. The
commandant of the cutter came up and struck at
me with his cutlass. Somehow, he overstretched
himself,--perhaps deceived by the darkness and

shadows--around, and falling against me, we both
tumbled into the sea. Fortunately, he did not
seize me in the water. I was always a good swim-
mer; the coast was near, and I reached it in safety,
and ran along for about a mile : the darkness
favoured my escape."
"And how did you manage for money?"
"I had my purse secured about me, with some
gold in it. I walked all night, my clothes drip-
ping wet. I had on a sailor's dress. Towards
morning, I met the coach for London-mounted,
and got on without suspicion, by acting the part
of a jack-tartold a story that satisfied the
coachman--and when I got to London exchanged
my sailor s dress for the clothes which I now
wear.-But what's become of that scoundrel
Barnard, and also of Smith ?"'
" The fate of the latter is fixed," said Hannah;
* he is now under sentence of transportation."
" He deserves worse," said Jackson, "for his
ingratitude and perfidy."
She then informed him briefly of Barnard's
breaking with herthe renewed coalitions that
took place between them-his late conduct
with a variety of comments upon his infamous
character.
"Mariahave you heard aught of her?" said
Jackson.
She formed a connexion -with Barnard, scon
after your departure-she bore him a son."

"Humph !" said Jackson. " With him, after
me! well, well-I blame her notsuch is the
nature of woman. Where is she and her child ?"
"The child is dead and buried. I overtook
both hei and Barnard, and saw him bury the
infant clandestinely, in a field near Sudbury.
From all that I saw, I have strong suspicions that
there has been foul play there. As for Maria, I
know not where she is; Barnard says, she is gone
to some relation of her's. But his manner is very
suspicious; and I often think that he may have
made away with her somehow. I believe him
capable of the darkest atrocities."
" The infamous scoundrel !" cried Jackson ;
"would I had trampled out his accursed life, the
night of our encounter in the cottage of Smith !"
" You may yet be revenged," said Hannah.
" How ?" cried he.
"Hear me, Jackson. This man and Smith
have been the primal causes of your ruin. I
have a long score, too, against him. Our causes
are the same ; let us join, and we can destroy him."
" The manner ?" said Jackson.
That he murdered his child, I have little
doubtthat he has destroyed Maria, I more than
suspect. But, at all events, he was positively a
party to the robbery for which Smith is con-
demned; and I know other matters which might
go near his life. Let us lay information against
him."

" No," said Jackson ; "I cannot agree to that
-at least, I will not join in it."
" Why not?" said Hannah; "is the fellow
deserving of any forbearance ?"
" I consider not his deserts, but my own cha-
racter, Hannah. I have done much that the
world will blame; but nothing to degrade me
utterly in my own estimation. I have trans-
gressed the conventional rules of society--I have
invaded the rights of property; but I have never
taken a sneaking, cowardly advantage of any
man. My revenge is open. Bring me face to
face with my enemy, and my right arm shal?
avenge my wrongs ;-but I will never descend to
be an informer."
"Well, well, Jackson, I know your high cha-
racter and feelings, and I will not press this
further. An opportunity, no doubt, will yet offer
for our just revenge. But what do you mean to
do now ?"
I must seek some temporary asylum, where
I
may
be secure from the pursuit of government,
in consequence of the fight-live as well as I can
and when the thing is blown over, we shall see
if anything is to be done.'
"Where do you propose to seek this asylum ?
said Hannah.
"I know not yet; but somewhere, I think
in London."
" You are wrong, Jackson-quite wrong; Lop-

don is no place for you: you are too well known
here. I could advise
you
better."
"Speak on," said Jackson. Where can I be
safer ?"
"In Smith's cottage : it is left in possession
of the old woman. A little will satisfy her; and
you can be there in safety. I will accompany you,
and between us we shall yet be able to devise
some plan to redeem our fortunes and revenge
our wrongs."
"I like the idea well," said Jackson ; " and I
will go immediately."
Hannah's principal object, in proposing to go
down to the country, was, that she thought she
could better carry on there her machinations
against the life of Barnard; for notwithstanding
what she said relatively to her being able to
give information as to the robbery, she feared
that she could not give such evidence, on those
points, as would prove fully satisfactory for his
inculpation. But she strongly suspected his
more deadly guilt down in the country, and she
thought it more than possible that she might, by
her intervention, be able fully to develope the
entire extent of his criminality. Independently
of her desire of revenge, she was in this design
also actuated by the hope of gain, for she thought
it probable that some reward might be attached
to the instrument of discovering this horrible
atrocity.

THE RED BARN.

For Jackson she was not altogether devoid of
some feeling, almost like friendship. She there-
fore advised him to go down into Suffolk, partly
with the consideration of his present safety,
partly with the view of her own temporary sup-
port there through his means, and partly from the
desire of keeping up a coalition between them,
which might yet, through the cleverness of both,
turn out mutually advantageous; for Hannah
knew the world too well not to know that little
success is ever to be expected from exertion with-
out coadjutors. It is also to be observed, that she
had no person in the world now to look to for any
co-operation but him.
As for Jackson himself, his motives were per-
haps less defined. He was in such reckless state
of mind, that he probably cared little to what
quarter he directed his steps. The ruin of his
hopes, the loss of his companions, sunk deeply in
his mind. He was growing careless with regard
to uturity, and rapidly acquiring a thorough
distaste for existence. He now felt strongly
what he had occasionally felt before, namely, that
he had made a most erroneous choice in his niode
of life ;that, hurried on by passion and the love
of pleasure, he had madly flung away the pros-
pect of honourable distinctionperhaps of high
rank, of solid happiness, and of peace
of mind.
He felt, when it was too late, that nothing but
steady perseverance in a right path, can secure
all these blessings, and that he who deviates

widely from the prescribed road of rectitude and
prudence, must expect to be entangled in the
wilderness of misery, and plunged into the morasses
of despair.
He was now quite alone in the world. The
companions of his dangershis fraudshis
desperate enterprizes his convivial hours, were
gone ;-many of them to render a serious account
to the Author of their existence for their manifold
abuses of his gracious gifts. In this state of
isolation, the societyeven of Hannah was something
to him. Though no feeling like love had ever
existed between them, nor was very likely to
be engendered under their present circumstances,
yet an analogy in misfortune and downfall ex-
cited something like a sympathy of sentiment.
Guilt and misery produce strange and degrading
alliances, of which truth the coalition of Hannah
and Jackson is no imperfect illustration.
They proceeded to Suffolk, and were domes-
ticated in the cottage This was Jackson's third
visit to this wretched place. The recollections
which he associated with it, were of no very
agreeable kind : it had been the scene of his
deception of the unfortunate Maria, for the
gratification of a fleeting passion, which had
entailed
upon
its unfortunate victim such direful
consequences;it had been the scene of luxurious
enjoyments, purchased at a bitter price indeed

bosom friend, deprived of the fruits of his illegal
gains, and thrown into new vicissitudes, dis-
appointments, and misfortunes, terminating in
overwhelming ruin. To this place he was now

bereft of hope, and sickened of existence. With

the thoughtless, or the careless originator of evils
nust suffer for his misdeeds, as well as the
perpetrator of darker atrocities.
Jackson confined himself, during the day,
entirely to the cottage, and was in the habit of
taking long walks at night, indulging gloomy
reflections of the past, and unfavourable presen-
timents of the future, He would often say to
himself, " Oh! what I might have been !" This,
though an useless reflection, as far as the past
is concerned, is yet the readiest to suggest
itself to our imagination, when we think of
wasted time, of lavished fortune, of golden
opportunities lost for ever; of feelings which
might have proved our own happiness and that
of others, perverted into engines of self-torment;
and of talents abused, frittered away, destroyed,
which might have raised us to eminent utility
and honourable fame. Happy those who make
this reflection when it is not quite too late-

of vice and folly, but that they may still retrace

the pastwho are yet young enough to atone,
in their riper years, for the dissolute disorder of
their greener days.
Such was not the case with
Jackson. His manhood had been as desperate
as his youth was dissolute; and the consequences
had deprived him of the promise of an age of
redemption. What he might have been was,
therefore, a reflection that brought with it nothing
but anguish. He might have been the delight
of his friends, and the ornament of his country
What was he?The mind turns with pain from
the contemplation of the picture.
Some time had now elapsed since Barnard
last wrote to old Marten, and the latter and his
wife had begun to feel very uneasy, anxious,
and suspicious, about the fate of their child.
They were continually talking on the subject.
Her not writing was so strange!she that had
loved her parents ! Never sending for
things which must have been indispensably
necessary to her comfort. They turned over every
particular connected with her disappearance, and
the more they reflected on the subject, the more
were they persuaded that all was not right.
The ever-designing Hannah, without mentioning
her intention to Jackson, contrived to introduce
herself to the cottage of the Martens : this she
found little difficulty in accomplishing. She fre-
quently sat down by the cottage gate, where sne

had first accosted the ill-fated Maria, and con-
versed with Mrs. Marten.
They would talk on the subject of the daughter's
mysterious absence; and, by a series of artful ques-
tions, Hannah soon drew from her every circum-
stance connected with it. One day, in particular, the
following conversation took place between them.
* You say, Mrs. Marten," said Hannah, "that
on the day Barnard came here to appoint the
meeting at the Red Barn, he had his pistols with
him ?"
" Yes; he was snapping them by the fire."
"That was suspicious. You also say that, on
the evening of that day, he was seen descending
from the Red Barn with a pickaxe on his shoulder."
"Yes; but I questioned him on that point, and
he denied it,-said it was another man.'
"But did not the person who saw him, know
him ?"
"Yes; for I have spoken to that person since
Barnard's departure, and he declares that it was no
one else, and that he could not in
any way
be mis-
taken."
Well, you know, if that be the case, he could
not possibly have gone to Ipswich with Maria on
that day."
" That is true," said the mother ; " besides, I
have since spoken to the man whom Barnard
stated to have been mistaken for himself, and he
says he was not in that neighbourhood the whole
of that day."

This," returned Hannai, "is a clear proof that
Barnard is a liar, and meant to deceive you; and
f he did not go to Ipswichas it is quite evident
hedid not-it is very unlikely that Maria went there
by herself. Has anything else transpired, since
his departure, to confirm your suspicions ?"
Yes; I have heard that he told different
stories about Maria to different persons. To one
he told that she was gone to France, and to
another that she was living very near us."
" Have you heard from Barnard since he left
Polstead ?"
"Yes:"and here Mrs. Marten told Hannah
about his letters, and the pretended miscarriage
of Maria's letter).
" Well, Mrs. Marten," said Hannah, "the
suspicion that Barnard has made away with your
daughter appears to me very strong indeed : your
not hearing a word from her-his palpable lies,-
every thing, in short, seeins to prove it. Do
know that I should not be at all surprised if he
had murdered her in the Red Barn, with those
very pistols which you saw him snapping."
"Good God! you cannot think so ?" said the
mother.
" Indeed but I do though; and I think, that if
you would have the Red Barn examined, you
would find it out; for, if he killed her, he could not
have hidden the body with safety anywhere else.'
This niade a deep impresion on the mind of
Mrs Marten, and she had a long conversation

with her husband on the subject. He, however,
could not at all be brought to enter into her sus-
picions of Barnardis being a murderer : he thought
his conduct somewhat mysterious, but could not
believe that he was capable of such villany.
Full of what Hannah had said to her concerning
the supposed murder of Maria in the Red Barn,
Mrs. Marten retired to rest, and remained for
some hours awake, deeply reflecting on the
horrible suspicions excited in her breast. Towards
the middle of the night she fell asleep, and
dreamed a singular dream ;not singular from
its subject, for her waking thoughts had led to
it, but from its remarkable accuracy and prophetic
character.
She dreamed that she was looking in through the
door of the Red Barn, and that she saw the body of
her daughter lying on the floor in the right hand bay,
covered with blood : Barnard was close by, with
out his coat, working alternately with spade and
pickaxe, making a grave. She saw him complete
his work, and, when he had finished, deposit the
body in the earth, cover it over, and then spread
the ground with straw She then fancied that
she entered the Barn-stood upon the grave
removed the straw and the earth with her hands
from the bodyand plainly saw the features of
her daughter ; at which a seream burst from her,
and she awoke trembling with horror. She told
her husband this remarkable dream ; and added

her full conviction that Maria had been murdered
by Barnard, and buried in the Red Barn.
The old man still remained incredulous. "
"My
dear," said he, "dreams are nothing. It was
natural you should dream all this after what you
had been saying to me last night. But I cannot
believe that William Barnard could do such a
thing."
"You may talk as you like, husband," said she,
" but I feel sure it is so."
The
poor old woman passed the whole of that
day in a state of the greatest melancholy and
depression of mind. The following night she
dreamed precisely the same dream as the night
before, without the variation of a single parti-
cular,
Again she spoke to her husband on the subject
and told the second dream ; at which he was
startled, and without hesitation determined to
search the Barn.
Accordingly he proceeded to the cottage of a
neighbour and friend of his, told him what he
was about, and asked him for his assistance. The
other, very much surprised, consented to accom-
So, having procured the key of the
Red Barn, and having entered the place, they
went to work immediately in the left bay, where
Mrs. Marten had dreamed that her unfortunate
daughter lay buried.
The corn had been thrashed out, but the litter

still remained in the Barn. On lifting up the
straw, several great stones apveared in the centre
of the bay, and the earth there had evidently
been disturbed and rooted up. On this spot they
began to dig.
Tbe earth was removed without much difficulty,
it being quite loose and unfirm. They had worked
down about a foot and a half, when they felt
something stop them. They then cleared away
the adjacent earth a little, and, to their astonish-
ment and horror, most clearly discovered the
remains of a human body. It was dressed in
female attire, and a green handkerchief was
observed round the neck -announcing to the
unhappy father the terrible fate of his daughter.
Who can picture to themselves at this moment
the feelings of the unfortunate man? He was
utterly unable to speak; the spade fell from
his nerveless arm, and he would have sunk upon
the earth, had he not been supported by his two
companions, and borne into the open air. .
It was agreed that the body should not be
touched or removed, until information should be
given in the proper quarter.
The wretched father, heartsick, returned home,
and informed his wife of the result of his labours.
He still had some slight hope that the corpse
might not be that of his daughter. The first
question he asked her was, what kind of hand-
kerchief Maria wore round her neck on the day
of her departure.

"A green one," was the reply.
" Then," said Marten, "it is too true : our
daughter has been murdered, and buried in the
Red Barn; and, I fear, by Barnard."
The unfortunate mother hurried off to the fatal
spot, where she beheld the corpse of her beloved
daughter, and identified every article of dress
which remained.-We shall not attempt to describe
her feelings: they can be better imagined than
described.
As she was returning bome, she met Hannah
Woods, and told her all. The latter, affected by
nothing but her feelings of revenge against Bar-
nard, exclaimed, with a look of triumphant malice,
" 'Tis well! I shall have the satisfaction of
seeing the villain hanged."
So saying, she posted away to communicate
the news to Jackson.

Oh, Harry, Harry !" cried the mother, running
out, with her eyes swoln with weeping, " poor
Maria is dead !destroyed by a ruffian !"
But, for God's sake, my good friends," said
Carribles, " tell us about it. How happened this
horrible business ?"
"Come in, gentlemen," said old Marten, "come
in; and we will endeavour to tell you all."
In they went; and the old people related mi-
nutely every circumstance which is already known
to the reader concerning the discovery of the body,
and their persuasion that William Barnard was the
murderer.
When the melancholy and horrid tale was con-
cluded, Everton rested his head on both his hands
and uttered not a word. He appeared so astounded
us to lose for a while the use of all his faculties.
Carribles started up; and with an oath, the profa-
nity of which might perhaps be excused by the
most pious, froin the burst of generous indignation
which inspired it, exclaimed.

"Infernal cuffian !-desperate, abominable mon.
ster!but every search must be made ;---the
tellow cannot shall not escape. Maria's death
must be avenged."
" Avenged, Sir!" cried Everton, starting from
his stupor, as if roused into recollection by the sound
of the last words of Carribles ; " avenged !-yes-
not all the powers of hell shall screen him from
vengeance. I will sacrifice both life and property,
if necessary, to bring the villain to justice ;-
would hunt him even to the centre of the earth,
if he could take refuge there. No spot of the
habitable globe shall be secure for him--I will
pursue him to the remotest corners of the world."
"Well said, my friend," cried Carribles ; "and
I will help you, tooth and nail. Curse me, but I
would hang him myself at the yard-arm, if he
lacked an executioner, rather than that he should
escape justice."
" And so would I, master," said Tom Squires.
"But, alas ! my dear friend," said Everton,
"she is gone,-the young, the beautiful, che
harmless. Never shall these eyes again behoid
her,--she whom to be near was happinesswith
whom I have sat so often in that window-whom,

hand, "I do. I have known what it is to be

young, and to love; but remember that you are
a jnan, and have a duty to perform. You cannot
better prove your affection to the memory of the
deceased, than by revenging her foul and heartless
murder,"
" Enough!" said Everton; "that idea nerves
me again; I will not rest until the ruffian be
brought to justice. Come, my friend, let us
about it straight: let us take the first steps-
there is no time to be lost. My dear old friends,"
said he, addressing himself to the Martens, "let
us dry up our tears, if possible : the destroyer of
your child shall be brought to punishment,-his
life will be but a poor atonement for his atrocious
guilt. Farewell, for a while ; I go to use all the
influence I am master of in this county: mean-
while, bear this in mind-though you have lost a
daughter, that while I live you shall never want
a son."
"Heaven bless you!" cried the old couple,
weeping bitterly.
"Carribles, Everton, and Squires, now de-
parted. Everton expressed a wish to visit the
Barn, to see the body; but his friend Carribles,
with a good sense, prudence, discretion, and good
feeling, highly praiseworthy, would not permit
him. His mind, he said, had already been quite
sufficiently agitated and distressed ; and to view
the mouldering remains of all that h: had dored
when living. could serve no other purpose than to
render him still more unhappy.

The news of the discovery of Maria's body
spread like wildfire through the village and its
peighbourhood. Numbers flocked to the Red
Barn, and all united in execrations against the
perpetrator of so accursed a deed. That the
murderer was no other than Willam Barnard,
every one, who heard the particulars of the
dreadful tale, n.ost firmly believed.
But who can describe the feelings of Jackson,
when Hannah told him the tremendous news
The others who had been connected with Maria,
who had hitherto heard the fact, were affected
simply by horror, or by heart-felt grief-with the
exception of Hannah, who, incapable of pity,
thought of nothing but her vengeance upon
Barnard. But with Jackson, the feelings of
horror and of anguish were mingled with a
deadlier draughtthe bitterness of remorse. He
felt that he himself was the primal cause of
all. He it was who had laid the train which
ended in this dreadful explosion. He it was, who
by a cool systematic plan of seductior, by
unworthy artifice, and base deception, by a
burlesque on the sacred ceremony of marriage,
and by a heartless desertion of the victim of his
wiles, when appetite was sated,he it was, who
had laid the foundation of this dreadful catas-
trophe. He could hardly consider himself as less
guilty than the actual perpetrator of the deed;
so deep, so terrible was the impression made on
him by the story of Hannah.
## p. 596 (#626) ############################################

THE RED BARN.
"Well," said she, " I was right; I guessed he
was the murderer."
Jackson looked steadily at her for several
minutes, without speaking. The expression of
his countenance was awful. He started up, and
struck his hand against his forehead.
" I," exclaimed he-" I am her murderer."
" You !" said Hannah.
"Ay, I! and you too--you assisted ;-we have
murdered her, by first deceiving her."
" As for me," said Hannah, "I am guiltless of
her death; and as for deceiving her, you employed,
instigated, solicited, bribed me to that. On your
head be that portion of the responsibility."
"Yes," said he; "yes, it is too true. It was
this cursed head that planned it all. Why
should I attempt to cast the burthen of my guilt
on its worthless instruments ? As well might the
ruffian who performed the infernal deed, lay the
biame upon the weapon which he used. But
no! the weapon was unconscious, you were not ;
it was no free agent, you were ; you might have
refused. Besides, you are guilty of this murder in
another way. You corrupted Barnard--you led
him into the labyrinth of vice and infamy. You
trained his mind; you led him from one degree
of guiltiness to another, until he was capable !
of this direful consummation of crime."
" Did no one help me, Jackson ?" said the
female fiend, with a sarcastic sneer;" who
originated his ruin ?"

"Not I-you know it was not I !"
" You sanctioned others; you lent your power-
ful influence-an influence that was, probably,
indispensable to success."
Well-be it so. On my head let my por-
tion of it restit is weighty enough. But you
have your share; and a heavy one it is. If
there be, as the wisest of men have believed, a
dispenser of eternal justice, and an hereafter of
retribution, you are deeply, awfully responsible."
"Vain imaginations !" said Hannah; "they
touch me not. I fear not the hell hereafter-the
one that is here is enough."
"That you will yet feel. Mark me-I am
going, I know not whither; but we are not likely
to meet again. I am careless of iny fate : my
offences are great, and I must suffer the just
punishment of them.
Be it so-repentance is
too late. I go to my doombut mark my latest
words. You have passed your life in heartless
infamy; and, for the sordid consideration of gain,
you have ever been the ready tool of villany and
of crime. The hell you speak of here you
will
feel. Deserted and despised of all, forlorn, and
poor, and wretched, you will drag out the remnant
of your days in misery and contempt. Your arts
will no longer deceive : the charms by which
you held fools in thraldom are vanished; the
mental
powers which
have abused will be-
come your torment. Madness will not come to
your relief; and you will preserve a vivid memory
which you

of past guilty enjoyments, with a consciousness
of the miseries of the present. You will finally
be reduced to the lowest degradation that age,
disease, and penury, can cause ; and you will die
without consolation, and without hope !"
The manner in which Jackson pronounced this
dreadful prophecy was awfully impressive. His
sonorous voice was re-echoed by the hollow
cavern over which he stood; the deadly paleness
of his countenance contrasted with his dark bushy
hair, which hung around his face in neglected
profusion. His eye glared wildly on the object
he was addressing, who was perfectly overawed
and struck dumb by the fearful energy of his
delivery. When he had concluded, he seized his
hat and pistols, and hurried forth from the cottage,
never to return.
He directed his steps to the Red Barn. "I
will take," said he," a last view of the sad conse-
quences of my guilty folly."
Evening was approaching. It was the month
of April. The sun, upon the extreme verge of
the west, darted his crimson beams over the land-
scape ; but a mass of livid clouds, with their dark
edges tipped with red, denoted, in the eastern
sky, a coming storm. All the scenery was fami-
liar to Jackson, and associated with the bitterest
recollections of the lost Maria. He took a path
which gave him a distant but distinct view of her
cottage. He stopped, and looked at it. He was
just facing the corner window from which she had

so often looked out on him, in all her virgin beauty,
at their various nightly assignations. He thought
upon
what she was then, and what she was now!
He thought upon himself, too-how lost-low
ruined ! His manly heart sunk under the recol-
lection, nor could he restrain a flood of tears.
He recovered himself, and proceeded forwards
He had a horror of visiting the fatal spot; and yei
he felt irresistibly impelled towards it
He entered the Barn. There were a few pea-
sants there. The body was not yet removed; but
remained for the inspection of the Coroner. It
was in the place where it had been buried. The
earth had been now completely removed from
about it. Jackson approached, and looked sted-
fastly at the sad remains of what he had once
loved, and what had fondly, dearly loved him.
Instead of life, and youth, and loveliness, what did
he behold ?-all the revolting ravages of mortality!
He rushed with horror from the scene : a second
look he could not endure. His feelings were
wound up almost to frenzy, and he proceeded in
a hurried pace along a path which led him far
from the Red Barn-but whither, he neither
knew nor cared.
When he found himself in a wild and silent
spot, apparently far from the haunts of mankind.
he seated himself under a tree, close behind a
hedge which bordered the road. Night had no:
coine on ; but neither moon nor stars were visul.

for the dark clouds which had been gathering in
the east had now involved the whole horizon,
Here Jackson gave utterance to the feelings
which lacerated his bosom :-"So, this is my
handiwork !" said he; "I have been the artificer
of death and ruin. Oh! if I had acted otherwise !
If I had remained faithful to her, even after having
first deceived her, she would have been still living,
and I should have been happy !-She loved me;
-her heart was all purity, and innocence, and
affection. Wretch that I was, to have seduced
her!-doubly so, to have deserted her!"
He then pictured to himself how happy he could
have been with Maria. How he might have re-
tired with her to some remote and sequestered
spot, where, having renounced his irregular pur-
suits, he might have lived, forgetful of the world
and its allurements, happy only in her simpie and
confiding love. There he might have atoned for his
errors by a virtuous course; have lived in tran-
quillity, and died in peace.
"But, no!" thought he again,"that could not be.
I was too deeply immersed to have emerged-I
was too far gone to return. I could not subsist
except as I did.
I had made my choice of fully
and of vice long before, with niy eyes open, and I
was obliged to stick to it. I shall quit," said he,
" the country, which has been the scene of way
vice and folly. I shall fly far away from this scene
of horror, and hide my head in some distant region

of the earth, where I shall not hear the sound of my
native language, or encounter aught that will excite
the remembrance of my country. I will go and
wander with the Tartar of the plain, or the Arab
of the desert ;-or 'I will go, and transport myself
to some remote island in the boundless main,
where the untutored savage roams through his
native woods, untainted by the vices of civilization.
-But, fool that I am! what am I talking about?
where can I go without means? I am a beggar
I have no money, and I know not where to get it.
To get it honestly is impossible ;-I will not get
it meanly. There is but one alternative. I must
get it bravely, though foully.
foully. Yes;
Yes; I have no
hope else. This must I do, and then away from
England for ever."
Scarcely had he made this last reflection, when
the wheels of a carriage came rattling along the
road. The impulse to stop it instantly seized
upon his inind.
It was a moment of dreadful
desperation with him. The risk of his life he did
not valueit was nothing. This attempt might
make him or mar him for ever. He might procure
the means of quitting the country at once. Reason
and reflection were banished from his mind; he
scarcely thought of what he was about, and was
in a state little short of madness.
He started up, clearing the hedge with a single
bound, rushed up the road, met and stopped the
horses, and demanded the purses of the pas-
sengers. A young man instantly opened the door

of the carriage, and jumped out, armed with a
brace of pistols. Jackson called on him to deliver
his moneythat he did not wish to take his life.
The other refused, and both fired simultaneously.
Jackson fell :-he was mortally wounded, but re-
tained full possession of his senses.
At this instant another person descended from
the chaise, and called out-
"What, ho! Harry, have you crippled the pirate ?"
"I believe so," replied Everton ;-for it was he
and Carribles, who were returning in the chariot
of the former. They had, after quitting Polstead
in the morning, dined with a neighbouring
gentleman, with whom they had been consulting
about the immediate measures to discover the
murderer of Maria.
Everton took one of the lamps off the chaise, and
came up to see if the robber were actually dead.
Jackson lay on the road, half reclined on his elbow,
-be was wounded in the side.
"Whoever you are," said he, in a voice which,
notwithstanding his wound, was sufficiently firm,
"you have given me my quietus, and I thank you
for it with all my heart,-it was the best turn you
could possibly have done me now."
"Surely," cried Carribles, approaching, "I
should know that voice-I have heard it before."
lle looked at Jackson's face by the lamp-light,
but could not recognize it: Jackson however,
instantly knew the Captain.

friend !Captain Carribles! Just heaven !-what
an attempt I have made! I thank thee for iny
cieath,- I have been saved from a worse crime
than any I have been ever guilty of yet."
"Who are you," said Carribles, "that know
my name so well? Your voice I have heard
before, but I do not know your person."
"I wonder not at thatmisfortune makes great
changes. She has so altered Stafford Jackson,
that he is not known to him who was his own and
his father's friend."
" Heavens !" cried the Captain ; " is it possible?
are you-can you be, Stafford Jacksonthe son
of my old friend?"
"It is too true," said Stafford ; "and little
cause have I to rejoice in the name.
"Unfortunate young man!" said Carribles ;
" how is it that I meet you in such a character ?
-a robber -a highwayman !"
Misfortune,-desperation,-madness !"
plied Jackson : "my life has been a course of
folly, of vice, of violence; and it is right it
should end thus. Accident to-day led me to
where I beheld a ruin-a dreadful ruin, of which
my own unprincipled passion was the primary
Struck to frenzy by contemplation of the
horrid scene, I rushed away-determined to fly
for ever from my native country; but I had
no money, and, under a momentary impulse of

catalogue of my crimes. But I faint-I am dying
-0! give me a little water."
Carribles was never without a small pocket-
case of brandy about him, and he now applied it
to the lips of Jackson.
"Come," said he, "my unfortunate boy ! my
house is close by,we'll remove you, and send
for a surgeon."
It is useless," said Jackson; "my wound I
feel is mortal ;-I cannot live-I do not wish it."
" You shall not die here, at all events," said
Carribles; "it shall not be said that old Carribles
let his friend, and the son of his friend, die lik 
dog on the high road-however guilty and un-
fortunate he might have been.-Come, Mr. Ever-
ton, help me."
Carribles, Everton, and the driver, now gently
raised the wounded man, and placed him in the
chaise. They stopped the flowing of the blood
from his side, by binding it with handkerchiefs,
and drove quickly to the Captain's cottage; where
having brought him in and set him on a couch,
they sent for a surgeon, in spite of Jackson's op-
position.
" It is useless, my respected---my injured old
friend!" said Stafford ; "my life is ebbing fast, and
will not last his coming. But, before I die, I wish
to confess to you the full extent of my errors ;-1
do not desire that you should think me better
or worse than I am."

He now briefly touched on his irregular life,
detailed his intercourse with Maria, and his
feelings and resolves when he had discovered the
dreadful catastrophe.
Everton listened with intense attention; and
when he had done, exclaimed,
"Gracious heaven! you, then, were the person
I met with her at the fair of Polstead, dressed in
the white hat."
"I am," said Jackson ; "but who are you ?"
"Do you not remember a young man who
passed you in the evening ?-you marked me well
then it was not far from Maria's cottage."
"I do, I do !" said Jackson.
"I am he," replied Everton.
Here Carribles explained Harry's attachment to
Maria, and honourable designs.
"Just heaven!" said Jackson ; "the retri-
bution was doubly due;-I have fallen by the
man I have most injured. Give me your hand,
my friendfor I must call you so :- I thank you
again for my death. I have been very reckless
through my life, both of divine and human laws;
but the injury to Maria, and and its consequences,
are what press most deeply on my heart in this
my dying hour. Those excepted-though I have
greatly offended otherwise, I have never stooped
to aught that was mean and petty. I have betrayed

a thousand others : I foolishly left an honourable
profession, and was then thrown upon the worid,
under the influence of strong passions and of evii
councils. Habit made me irreclaimable, and
necessity forced me to persevere in the course
that folly had begun. But I am going--my course
is run: I am about to render an account of my
follies and my crimes ;-heaven have mercy on me!
-Farewell, my oldmy early friend ! forgive me!
-Oh! forgive me !"
These were the last words that Stafford Jackson
ever spoke. In a few minutes he expired, as he
had predicted, before the arrival of the surgeon.
"Unfortunate boy !" said Carribles, leaning
over him; "you are the wreck of all that was
gallant and high-spirited. Oh, Everton, I used
to love this boy as if he had been my own son
I taught him to sail, to row, to hand, reef, and
steer. A lad of more daring mettle never trod a

all his errors, his heart was generous and noble.
But thoughtlessness, folly, headlong dissipation,
bad company-look, look at their consequences,
Harry. But of you there is no danger-your
principles are too good ; you are too steady in the
paths of virtue and of honour, to need such an
example."
Carribles, after all proper investigation bad
laken place respecting this affair, saw, himself,
the last duties paid to the son of his friend.

MEANWHILE, the infamous and wretched author
of the atrocity nad returned to London. At the
time the body of Maria was discovered, Barnard
was settled with his wife near the metropolis,
where they lived in great respectability. He could
not, however, totally rid himself of his fears, nor of
the stings of an evil conscience. During his waking
hours, he had so far disciplined his mind as con-
siderably to overcome, or at least to suppress,
,
such
feelings; but in the relaxation of sleep, when
reason yielded her empire to fancy, his torments
would return.
He had retired to rest one night oppressed
with melancholy feelingsa dim light burned
near his bed--the house clock had struck the hour
of midnight, and his eyes closed in something
like sleep, and he dreamed that he was standing

in the fatal Red Barn, beside Maria's grave
Suddenly the earth under his feet gave way, and
he fell through it into a place of utter darkness.
The darkness, however, did not long continue; for
a tall figure, in long black drapery, entered,
bearing a flaring torch. By the light of this,
Barnard found himself in a charnel-house, where
heaps of skulls and human bones were piled all
around : the figure with the torch then vanished,
and left Barnard again in darkness. After this,
with the extravagance of dreaming, he imagined
that the torch re-entered by itself, and, moving
across the place, seemed to rest on a heap of
numan skulls. By the light, he now discerned,
seated on an adjoining heap, Maria, with her child
in her arms.
Their appearance, at first, was such
as it had been in their life-time; but a sudden and
horrid change took place :the mother appeared
with the wound in her face, the dreadful staring
eye-ball, and a deep gash in the side, from which
was issuing a fountain of blood :-the face of the
child was black with decomposition; its body was
uncovered, and the limbs appeared half dropping
into dust. Suddenly the ground opened at his
feet, and he stood on the brink of an apparently
interminable pit of darkness : all around the edge
of this yawning gulf, he could discern the horrid
countenances of demons and furies. The earth
which sustained his feet now gave way--flames
arose around him--and he fell headlong into an
ocean of fire.-On this he awaked in an agony of

terror, shrieking aloud so as to alarm the house :
his wife and her mother rushed affrighted to his
room, and found him pale and breathless. He
contrived, however, to muster resolution enough
not to betray himself, and merely complained of
illness,
Notwithstanding the dreadful impression of this
dream, he managed, when he was thoroughly
awake, to recover the appearance of self-possession.
He walked into his garden, and reasoned and
reflected within himself for some time on the
dangerous situation in which he must be placed,
should the body be discovered. The dreain
foreboded something of this-he could not dis-
possess his mind of itit haunted him through all
his reflections, and he almost thought that it was his
death warning. Yet, eleven months had now elapsed
since the commission of the murder, and he must,
he thought, be secure : the body must have be-
come so completely decomposed, as to render its
identification impossible. Even if it should be
discovereda thing in itself exceedingly im-
probablestill that discovery could not hurt him :
he might, indeed, be suspected, but it could never
be proved that he was the murderer. He knew
that no circumstance but the identification of the
body could inculpate him: his life, therefore,
was safe. What had he to fear ?why should he
torment himself with imaginary terrors? What
was conscience?a namea shadowa phantom,
to use the favourite expression of his friend Carlile :

nonsense !~he was perfectly secure-hew
living in seclusion and in comfort-in the enjoy-
ment of a good income, and of a respectable con-
nexion in which he was esteemedwhat was
there to fear for him? It was unwise, then, to
trouble himself. He ought to enjoy, undisturbed
by foolish visions, the happy lot which fortune
and his own cleverness had procured him : to im-
prove
that lot should be his care. Like the rich
man in the Gospel, he was disposed to say within
himself, " Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for
many years : take thine ease ; eat, drink, and be
merry"-but he was soon destined to hear, in a
voice of thunder, " Thou fool! this night thy soul
shall be required of thee:
Calmed, composed, and even exhilarated, by
this train of thought, he sat himself down to
breakfast in company with his wife and mother
in-law, and two other ladies. His conversation
was gayand mirthful; and he was quietly minuting
by his watch the boiling of some eggs, when a
knock was heard at the street door. The servant
came up stairs, and announced that a strange
gentleman was desirous of speaking with Mr.
William Barnard, on urgent business; on which he
desired that the gentleman should be shown into
another room, and immediately waited upon him.
.
-It was an officer of police who appeared before
him, bearing a warrant to arrest him for the
murder! and Barnard's conscience told him so,

ears. He trembled within-his face grew pale as
deathhis eyes almost lost their sight-his lips
became dry-and his tongue faltered, as he re-
plied to the officer of justice that he was not the
murdererthat he never knew the name of the
murdered Maria! But the lie availed him not
truth was written on his front, and the
grasp
of
iron justice was upon him. The fatal weapons
with which he committed the dreadful deed,
his pistols and dagger-were even in the very
apartment where the officer charged him with the
crime, and secured before him. So certain had
he felt that he was out of all danger of being dis-
covered as the criminal-so blunted in his feelings,
that he had hung these very instruments and
memorials of his villany in the apartment to which
he daily resorted !-He was arrested, bound-and
from fancied security, in the comforts of affluence,
dragged before a magistrate, and thence sent to
Polstead, under the care of the officer who ap-
prehended him; where an inquest took place on
the body of Maria, and a verdict was brought in
against hi.n of wilFUL MURDER.
The remains of the unfortunate girl were then
interred in the churchyard of Polstead. The
weeping parents followed her coffin, and Harry
Everton and Carribles appeared as mourners at
the funeral. No stone marks the humble grave
of the innocent victim of seduction and villany;
but long shall the villager recognize the spot where

she lies, pity her melancholy fate, and execrate
the memory of her heartless destroyer.
As the carriage, which was to convey him to
Bury Gaol, rolled away with the criminal through
his native village, where every object was so familiar
to himwhere his innocent hours of boyhood had
been spent-where his happy home lay, from
which he was now parting for ever,-his head sunk
his frame convulsively shuddered-and he threw
himself back on the seat, where he sat completely
overwhelmed with mental agony. "Here,"
thought he, "I might have still been happy-I
might still have enjoyed the blessings of this peace
ful and delightful spot-here I might have still
been respected and beloved by my neighbours and
my kindred, bad not the false glare of worldly
pleasure, and infidelity to my Creator, turned me
aside into the wilderness of vice. And now,
where am I going ?-to quit home, friends, re-
lations-all; to die on a scaffold-execrated by the
world !"
In this train of reflection he remained, until the
carriage stopped at the gate of the Gaol-out of
which he never passed, but to his trial and his
execution.
Thus perished William Barnard, in the prime
of youth. Such was the just and awful vengeance
visited by unerring heaven on the head of a mur-
derer. Such were the consequences of lawless
appetite, of vicious society, of unprincipled folly,

613
and blasphemous infidelity. Such were the con-
sequences of a young man being insnared within
that fatal circle, "Life in London,"-the atmo-
sphere of which is pollution, pestilence, and
death ; where every good feeling grows extinct-
where every bad passion, every hateful pro-
pensity, is cherished. From which, taste, refine-
ment, sense, and honesty, are banished: where
virtue is a scorn, and crime a jest. Where even
our very language itself is perverted from its
proper use : where a dialect is spoken not less
expressive of the heartlessness than of the vul-
garity of its adopters; and which is, at once, the
emblem, the preservative, and, in a great measure,
the source of depravity; for words, after all, are
too often things : nor can certain styles of ex-
pression be adopted with impunity to the
character. The gentlemen, who imagine that they
can habitually employ the language of ruffians,
thieves, and prostitutes, without ceasing to be
gentlemen, are indeed very grievously mistaken;
and the disposition to adopt such phraseology,
from whatever cause generated, argues little for
their taste, good sense, or morality. Such, in
short, only added another victim to the many who
have fallen within the scorching and pestilential
breath of London pleasure.
Neither was Barnard the only victim to this
vicious course, among the personages of this
history. Smith is now wandering an outcast for
ever from his country, on the shores of New

Holland; but he remained, after his embarkation,
a sufficient time in harbour to hear of the dreadful
fate of his pupil, his associate, and friend. The
catastrophe of Stafford Jackson is already fully
before the reader. Creed, whose guilt was not of
the darkest die, is yet suffering the just penalty
of his total want of principle, in a state of the
lowest indigence in America. Warren, a man of
violence, perished by violence. Ellen, a wretched,
houseless prostitute, died in the streets from
starvation; and the one-eyed scoundrel, who
came to be a personal witness of the end of Bar-
nard, was but then beholding what soon awaited
himself.
As for the principal agent in producing the
crimes and calamities which it has fallen to our
lot to describe, the prediction of Jackson con-
cerning her has been pretty accurately fulfilled.
Utterly deprived of beauty by increasing years,
and infirmities, equally the result of former vicious
excesses and present privations, she sunk into the
lowest and most degraded poverty. Haggard,
filthy, and revolting in her appearance, she sub-
sisted, for a time, precariously on casual charity,
often bestowed by the young peasantry around
as much from fear as from pity,for her wild,
withered, and witch-like appearance, was not
ill-calculated to excite apprehension in a youthful
and superstitious mind. She added to the list of
her other vices, an habitual indulgence, as far
as she was able, in drunkenness. After having

remained some time in the neighbourhood of
Polstead, she suddenly disappeared, and nothing
certain concerning her fate ever transpired.
About the time, indeed, of her disappearance, a
female body was cast on the coast in the neigh-
bourhood of Clacton, and some imagined that it
might have been hers; but it was so disfigured by
the waves, as to render it impossible to identify it.
Captain Carribles still survives, and is as
healthy and as happy as ever, except when he
reflects on the deaths of Maria and Jackson. He
maintains the closest intiinacy with his friend
Harry Everton, who is most highly respected in
the country. The latter still remains unmarried,
and is still likely so to continue; for he cherishes,
with a feeling not likely to be soon obliterated,
the memory of his lost Maria.
If, in the earlier portion of this history, we have
dwelt rather in detail on scenes of London life, it
was for the purpose of showing how dangerous,
how fatal, is their tendency. No character which
we have described as figuring there, has failed to
suffer the infallible punishment that awaits vice
and folly. We trust that we have taken a moral
for our end; and if our story prove the minans of
deterring any youth, who is on the brink of the
gulf of vicious pleasure, from being plunged in
and lost for ever, our labour will be recompensed
to the extent of our hopes.

The Murder
OY
MARIA MARTEN.
No event, of a domestic occurrence, since the murder of Mr. Weare
by John Thurtell, has monopolized more of the public interest and
sym-
pathy throughout all parts of the country, than the savage assassination
of Maria Marten, at Polstead, in Suffolk, and the recent trial and con-
demnation of her tiger-hearted assassin, William Corder, at Bury St.
Edmund'sand few, indeed, if any, have been marked with a more cold-
blooded atrocity, a more premeditated execution, or a more callous
minded or pitiless disposition.
The vile murderer was William Corder, who is now condemned to pay the
only earthly atonement he could offer for the magnitude of his offence, and the
wretched victim of his barbarity was Maria Marten. Both were natives
of the county of Suffolk. Corder, the only surviving son of a respectable
farmer lately living in the vicinity of the village of Polstead, and the ill-
fated Maria, the daughter of a poor but industrious man, who supported
his family by mole-catching, and resided but a short distance from the
cottage of Mrs. Corder.
A darker deed, or one more malignantly and barbarously accomplished,
than that perpetrated by Corder, tappily blackens not a page in the
annals of human iniquity; but yet, while reviewing it, this satisfaction
remains to us,that outraged humanity, and the violated laws of God
and man, will be partially, if not fully, avenged in the criminal's igno-
minious and merited death.
In detailing the incidents consequent upon this appalling offence, we
assume the task with much hesitation, and more reluctance. It is an
office from which the best feelings of humanity recoil; but yet, as it is
one the performance of which may give a practical and useful proof of
the baneful fruits of a life of immorality-serve as a beacon to those who,
the slaves of ungoverned judgment, or heated by youthful passion, are
about to make their first step in the career of crime, and warn them of its
certain and ignominious termination,

And did we entertain any doubt of the propriety of its discharge, all

scepticism would vanish on the recollection of the ascertained and incon
trovertible fact, that even a solitary instance of punishment, treading,
though slowly, certainly on the heels of guilt, and it coming within our
own knowledge, and its existence verified by the most conclusive testi-
mony, operates with greater force, and exercises a more powerful in-
fluence over the rule and conduct of life, than a thousand theoretical and
supposititious cases.
Confining ourselves to truth, and repudiating, as much as possible, those
feclings of indignation and animosity, which will spontaneously and almost
irresistibly arise from the contemplation of so unprecedented a murder;
we shall simply lay before the reader those circumstances that have been
under our own observation, and such illustrative incidents as, after making
diligent inquiry, we are convinced are correct.
The barbarous deed, which has more the appearance of a melo-drama-
tic romance, than an occurrence in a civilized country like England, pos-
sesses, inherently, so fearful a reality, that it requires no fiction of the
imagination to add to its horrorsit needs not any embellishment-it de-
mands not any ideal colouringand, in truth, we are so lamentably as-
sured, " that such things are," that to enlarge upon them, or enhance
their horror,-it cannot be enhanced,would be as disagreeable as it would
be superfluous.
The murder itself was discovered as if by the interposition of Provi.
dence. The work, which " shunned the light," was discovered by a
dream, an incident not the least singular in this " crime of mystery," and
a circumstance which not only reminds us of the imaginative tates of our
childhood and the nursery, but one which, were it not so distinctly authen-
ticated, would scarce obtain belief from even the most credulous.
The facts, each simple in themselves, but each furnishing, though a
small, yet a necessary, link in the chain of evidence confirmatory of the
guilt of the accused." His midnight perturbations-his disturbed mind-
his sleepless walkshis singular matrimonial advertisement-his almost
predestinated union with his broken-hearted helpmatethe purposed exe-
cution of the deed of conveyance of the school at Ealing-lane, on the
very morning on which he was apprehended-his forgery on the Hadley
and Manningtree banks to complete the purchase,are all circumstances
which, though viewed individually, may appear unimportant, are yet, when
taken collectively, of great magnitude; have been the instrument of dis-
closing as unmotived and unprovoked a murder as has for ages been heard
of; and testifies, if testimony were necessary,
" That murder most oul will out;"
and that
Justice, tho' balt, sbe's sure,
And will o'ertake the quick-paced criminal."
The first announcement of "the Polstead Murder," for such is the
name by which it is at present characterized, and the appellation by
which, in all probability, the diabolical tragedy will be transmitted to
posterity, appeared in the leading London Journal, " The Times," of the
22d of April
, 1828. A simultaneous account was also given in a country
paper, the "Suffolk Herald;" but as it was, in the ordinary style of country
ournals, overcharged where it was unrequired, and dealt in too much oi
the roniance of paragraph-making, its correctness cannot be depended on;

THE RED BARN.
619
and it is altogether undeserving of notice, exoept so far as it furnishes one
or two subsidiary circumstances (of the accuracy of which we have no
knowledge) which " The Times" has omitted.
In " The Times," the murder was well described as a deed hitherto
unheard of; unprecedented in cruelty; and distinguished by a concentrated
malice that could have only been expected from the head of a demon; and
an outline of the apprehension of Corder, and the grounds on which it was
thought proper to transmit him to Polstead, to await the verdict of the ad-
journed inquest holden on the corpse by the Coroner, Mr. Weyman, was
published.
The announcement alluded to we subjoin; and the interest it created,
though considerable, was raised to an irritable height of excitement, by
the appearance, in almost the entire of the Metropolitan Newspapers, of a
report from the Lambeth-street Office of Police, dated Wednesday, the
23d of April, in which the particulars were given with a great degree of
minuteness, and, as the result has proved, with the utmost fidelity.
To preserve a regular order in the narrative, and to give the reader the
opportunity of drawing his own conclusions, we shall here insert it, as
also the extract from the " Suffolk Herald."
" The Times," April 22, 1828.
"On Tuesday evening, a constable from Suffolk, of the name of Ayres,
made an application at Lambeth-street Police Office, stating that a strong
suspicion was entertained that a most diabolical murder had been com-
mitted in Suffolk, by a person named William Corder. An inquest had
been that day holden on the unhappy vetim, which stands adjourned until
Friday. In consequence of this communication, James Lea, an officer of
this establishment, in company with Ayres, apprehended Corder; and a
few minutes before the office closed on Tuesday evening, he was brought
in custody before M. Wyatt, Esq. the sitting magistrate.
" From the statement, on oath, of the constable Ayres, it appeared
that the murdered woman, whose name is Maria Marten, aged 26 years,
was decoyed, in male attire, on the 18th of last May (1827), from the
house of her parents at Polstead, in Suffolk, by the prisoner, who desired
her to meet him at his Red Barn, promising her that they should go to
Ipswich to be married by license.
" The unsuspecting girl accordingly attended at the time and place ap-
pointed, but from that day to this she had not been heard of. Since that
period, however, many letters have been received by the parents of the
unfortunate girl, from the prisoner, in which he uniformly stated that he
and their child were living most happily together in the married state;
and, in the last letter he wrote, he said that he should soon return and
resume the occupation of the farm. He feigned many excuses for the
absence of the deceased from time to time.
"The mother of the girl at length became alarmed, and the subject
preyed so much on her mind, that she dreamed that her daughter was
murdered, and her body buried under the floor of the barn of the prisoner,
and where he appointed to meet her on the night of the 18th of May.
" The corn, which was in the barn, having been recently threshed out,
the mother requested that the floor might be taken up, which was accoru-
ingly done, and then, to ber borror, she discovered the remains of a sud,

in which was contained the mangled corpse of Maria Marten! The body
was of course in a state of decomposition, but it was identified by the
teeth in the jaw-bone being wanting, which was her case. She was also
dressed in the same male attire as she wore on the fatal night. The pri-
soner was apprehended at Ealing, and in his house were found a passport
for France, dated . the 17th day of December, and a brace of pistols,
which were bought at Ipswich. He said nothing in his defence, and was
remanded until the following day.
Such was the account in " The Times," and, as will be perceived,
though it did not then go into detail, it embraces the principal facts of the
occurrence in a clear and perspicuous manner, and serves as a preface to
what at an after period was developed.
The version of the provincial Journalist is more diffuse, but not so
clear; and wishing to give every information that can throw a light on the
subject, we insert it also.After a very hackneyed and Grub-street kind
of introduction, the editor says, A murder," we leave out his epithets
and metaphors," has been brought to light within these few days, at
Polstead, in this county. The circumstances which have reached us are
these :-Maria Marten, a fine young woman, aged twenty-five, the daughter
of a mole-catcher in the above village, formed an imprudent connexion,
wo or three years ago, with a young man, named William Corder, the
son of an opulent farmer in the neighbourhood, by whom she had a child,
He appeared much attached to her, and was a frequent visitor at her
father's house ; on the 17th of last May she left her father's, stating, in
answer to some queries,  That she was going to the Red Barn to meet
William Corder, who was to be waiting there to convey her to Ipswich,
where they were to be married. In order to deceive observers (Corder's
relations being hostile to the connexion) she was to dress in man's attire,
which se was to change at the Red Barn for her bridal garments.' She
did not return at the time expected; but being in the habit of leaving
home for some days, no great alarm was expressed by the parents. When,
however, several weeks had elapsed, and no intelligence was received of
their daugh'er, although Corder was still at home, the parents became
anxious in their inquiries. Corder named a place at a distance, where he
said she was, but that he could not bring her home for fear of displeasing
his friends ; her sister, he said, might use her clothes, as she would not
want them. Soon after this Corder's health became impaired, and he, in real
or pretended accordance with some advice he said he had received, resolved
on going abroad. Accordingly, he left home in last September, express-
iny great anxiety, before he left, to have the Barn well filled. He took
with him about 400, Several letters have been received by his mother
(a widow) and sister, as well as by the Martens, in which he stated that
he was living with Maria in the Isle of Wight. These, however, bore the
London post-mark. He regularly desired that his letters should be
burned, which request was not complied with. Strange surmises lately
uned circulation throughout the neighbourhood ; and one person stated,
a singular circumstance, that on the evening when Maria Marten dis-
cared, he had seen Corder enter the Red Barn with a pickaxe.
The parents became more and more disturbed and dissatisfied, and
fears were still more strongly agitated by the mother dreaming, on
e successive nights last week, that her daughter had beer murdered
buried in the Red Barn. She insisted that the four should be up-

turned; and on Saturday morning the father, with his mole-spade, and a
neighbour, with a rake, went to examine the Barn; and soon, near the
spot where the woman described, her daughter lay buried, and only about
one foot and a half under ground. The father turned up a piece of a
shawl which he knew belonged to his daughter, and his assistant, with his
rake, pulled out a part of a human body. Horror-struck, the unhappy
father and his neighbour staggered back from the spot. The remains were
afterwards disintered, the body being in a state of decomposition. The
pelisse, shawl, Leghorn bonnet, and shoes, were, however, distincily iden-
tified as those belonging to Maria Marten. The body has been closely
inspected; but, owing to its decayed state, no marks of violence have been
discovered, except some perforations in the bones of the face, as if by
small shot. There can be little doubt but that this unfortunate young
woman fell a victim to her unhallowed passion, and was inhumanly
butchered by the monster on whom she relied for future protection as a
husband. An inquest was held before J. Weyman, Esq., Coroner for
the liberty, on Sunday last, and adjourned until Friday, in the hope that
some intelligence may be gained of Corder, so as to lead to his apprehen-
sion. The murdered remains were buried on Sunday night, in the pre-
sence of an immense concourse of spectators.
" The mother of Corder appears to have been singularly unfortunate ;
and, it may be more easily imagined than described, what feelings must
agitate a parent at the thought that her son has been guilty of so heinous
a crime : but she has long been used to grief and mistortune. About
three years since she buried her husband, and last Christmas twelve
months one of her sons was drowned. Since that period, consumption
has carried off two of her family."
Such is the statement of "The Suffolk Herald," and for the reasons
hitherto mentioned we give it a place in our work. Though the outline
in " The Times" is most accurate, yet it is but an outline, and we shall
fill up the blanks by giving more of the details. On the evening of the
22d of April, Corder was brought before M. Wyatt, Esq., the magistrate
sitting at the Lambeth-street Police Office, in London, in the charge of
James Lea, an officer belonging to that establishment, and Ayres, a con-
stable of Polstead, who was despatched expressly, by Sir Wm. Rowley,
to London, to discover the supposed murderer. Knowing little of the Me-
tropolis, and unauthorised to apprehend a person in Middlesex on a
mere suspicion of criminality, he made an application, on the previous
day, for a warrant of apprehension and the assistance of an oficer, to
Mr. Wyatt. Under these circumstances this was readily granted, and
Lea, as an intelligent man, was selected for the pursuit. "After fourteen
hours most active search, without any direction, save his own sagacity, to
guide him,-Ayres, the country officer, supplying him with no clue, nor,
indeed, scarce knowing where he was, or what measures he should adopt,
-he ascertained that the culprit had recently married the daughter of a
Mrs. Moore, and that he was then, with his wife, conducting, in partner-
ship with Mrs. Engleton and her daughters, the Grove-house Boarding:
school, at the lower end of Ealing-lane, near Brentford. He imme.
diately repaired thither, and on the culprit's being identified, secured him,
and brought him, in the evening, before Mr. Wyatt
, at the district office
His primary examination was short, and merely consisted in his recog-

nition by Ayres, and his production of the under-jaw bone of the unfortu-
nate Maria Marten, which, her frame being decayed and features quite
obliterated, it was thought necessary to exhibit
, in order to the positive
ascertainment of her being the person with whose murder he was
accused.
The examination, as we have said, was brief, but yet not uninteresting.
The magistrate, Mr. Wyatt, was quite shocked with the barbarity of the
crime, and expressed an opinion that scarce any human being, diabolical
as might be his disposition, and murderous his propensities, would be guilty
of so incredible an atrocity. He asked Ayres, what the bone he ex-
hibited had to do with the horrible transaction ? And Ayres replied,
that it was the principal means they possessed of proving that the body,
discovered in the Red Barn, was that of Maria Marten, with whose assas-
sination the prisoner was, on the strongest grounds, charged. It would
hereafter appear, that the murdered girl had lost two teeth, one of them
the eye tooth, in that part of the jaw where these were missing. "The
clothes," he added, " could be sworn to, that remained undecayed, and
which were found where the body was interred; and had it not been,
fortunately, for this discovery, it would, from the reduced condition of
the corpse, and it being literally a skeleton, have been impossible to
identify it as that of Maria Marten."
On this examination nothing more transpired; and, in obedience to
the orders of Mr. Wyatt, Corder was, for the night, detained in the
watch-house, and directed to be again placed at the bar on the following
day, prior to his transmission to Polstead.
While at the bar, on this occasion, he seemed perfectly at ease, and
displayed a self-possession which could hardly be expected from even
those who had the strong support of conscious innocence to sustain them
while subject to so serious and disgraceful an accusation. He was
dressed in a gentlemanly suit of black, over which was thrown a military
Spanish roquelaure; and he leant negligently, and in an indifferent and
lounging manner, on the front rail of the dock. For the Tuesday night
he remained at the parochial watch-house; and at an early hour (eleven
o'clock) on the next morning he was again brought before Mr. Wyatt,
when the following disclosures and proceedings, which in this stage of
the inquiry are momentously explanatory, took place. By them will be
perceived the recklessness of hardened guilt, and from them we may clearly
deduce that " foolish are the wise in their own imagination ;" and that in
the boldness of guilt,-a boldness originating in a temporary impunity,
the criminal will
, with a heedless confidence, overlook even the most ordi-
nary precautions, and preserve, with what may be designated a retribu-
tive fatuity, such unconsidered trifles as will ultimately lead to the dis-
covery of his guilt, and render him subject to the laws, the injunctions of
which he has broken.
The account of the 29th of April, and that which we have spoken of as
having heightened the before aroused excitement of the public, is as
fellows; we give it from the person who wrote it, and was a witness of
what he describes :-
On the night of Tuesday, the 22d of April, William Corder was brought
to the Whitechapel Police Office, under the charge of Lea, an officer of
the establishment, and a Suffolk constable named Ayres. He was then

623
briefly examined by M. Wyatt, Esq. ; and the crime with which he was
accused, was the perpetration of the foulest murder that has beretofore
Founded the feelings of society.
The merciless ofence was committed near a year since; and on the
morning of the day referred to, far from the scene of his iniquitous offence,
and while in satisfied but imaginary security, the culprit was seized, and
made accountable to that justice, the sanctuary of which he had so cruelly
and so wantonly invaded.
The monster's sacrifice was a fond and confiding female, in " the spring
of life," who had borne him a child; whom he had pledged himself to
marry; and who, previous to her deplorable fate, lived in peace and tran
quillity at her father's cottage. It was at an inconsiderable distance from
her murderer's house, and thus afforded him a facility of intercourse,
which, did it but exist, the deluded girl might have been still living.
She was young and beautiful, and in the very " bloom of existence.
Frail she might have been; but that frailty arose not from any pre-
disposition towards vice, but was the consequence of constant importunity,
and the unremitting solicitations which a rustic beauty, and "the flower
of the village," expects and demands. Her fall was natural, and its
penalty most severe; it was enforced by the friend of her bosom, and she
expired by the hand of a ruffian, whom
"She lov'd not wisely, but too well."
For the interests of society, immorality deserves its chastisement; but yet
its executioner, though it may add to its bitterness, should not be the
author of the crime he punishes; and, in the present melancholy instance,
the expiation has been more than proportionate to the deviation from the
straight and narrow paths of chastity.
The unfortunate victim of an overweening vanity was Maria Marten,
and the only accountable motive for the annihilation of a life which its
destroyer had declared he would "support and cherish," seems to be a
fear of her disclosing a former very aggravated and felonious delinquency
of which he had been guilty. It was his surreptitiously obtaining a letter
sent to Maria by Mr. M. (the son of the Lady of the Manor), and
abstracting from it a note of some amount, which he had transmitted for
the maintenance of his illegitimate child. Of this theft she was aware;
and, apprehensive that she would disclose it, he committed the inhuman
crime, which he must expiate at the gallows.
On Wednesday he was brought up for a short interrogation, anterior to
his being transmitted to Polstead, the theatre of his deep dyed guilt.
Judging from his appearance, though there is a cat-like ferocity about
the eyes, and a somewhat sinister expression of countenance, we should
not infer that he had been so cold-blooded a murderer. His age does not
exceed twenty-four years, and his complexion is lightly florid  but this,
while under examination, varied momentarily, and changed from the most
deadly pale to a high coloured crimson; his dress was fashionable, and
appeared to be somewhat studied; and when taken into custody, he, in
conjunction with his wife and a Mrs. Engleton and her daughters, kept a
female boarding-school, of some estimation, at the Grove-house in
Ealing-lane, Middlesex.
Here it
may
be
proper to give some account of the manner in which
be became acquainted with Miss Moore, now Mrs. Corder. On the

THE RED BARN
25th of November, after the murder of Maria Marten, he inserted the
following Advertisement in " The Sunday Times."
"MATRIMONY.-A Private Gentleman, agea twenty-four, entirely independent,
whose disposition is not to be exceeded, bas lately lost chief of bis family by the band
of Providence, which bas occasioned discord amongst the remainder, under circum-
stances most.disagreeable to relate. To any female of respectability, who would
study for domestic comforts, "and willing to confide her future bappiness to che in
every way qualified to render the marriage state desirable, as the Advertiser is in
affluence. Many very bappy marriages have taken place through means sioilar to
tbis now resorted to; and it is hoped no one will answer this through impertinent
curiosity; but should this meet the eye of any agreeable Lady who feels desirous of
meeting with a sociable, tender, kind, and sympathising companion, they will find this
Advertisement worthy of notice. Honour and secresy may be relied on. As some
little security against idle applications, it is requisite that letters may be addressed
(post paid) A. Z., care of Mr. Foster, stationer, 68, Leadenhall-streot, with real
Dame and address, which will meet with most respectful attention."
This Advertisement was not lost sight of by the ladies who sigh in
single blessedness; more than fifty answers were received to it, and
amongst them one from Miss Moore, with whom an interview took place
at the pastry-cook and confectioner's shop nearest the Temple, in Fleet-
street, which shortly afterwards resulted in a marriage with Corder.
Many rumours are afloat relative to his offence, but the only particulars
that can be depended on as far as they have yet transpired, are as fol-
lows:-
foi some years past, Corder, who was a person of some property, and
who, at the time of the committal of the murder, was resident at Polstead,
kept company with Maria Marten, the daughter of a person in humble
cij cumstances in the village. An illicit intercourse ensued from their
acquaintance, and a child was the fruit of their commerce. This, it is
rumoured, was murdered by the prisoner; and the mother being aware
of she horrible fact, as well as of his having obtained Mr. M.'s letter
an: 1 plundering it of its contents, she made use of it as a threat, and
received from Corder a distinct promise of marriage.
On the 18th of last May he called at her father's cottage, and there
expressed his willingness, and indeed anxiety, to have the ceremony
performed; but in order that it might be private, and as much concealed
as possible, he said he was desirous of having it celebrated by licence,
and not hy banns; for that the latter would occasion an unnecessary
notoriety
The following day was that appointed for the discharge of his long-
pledged vow. At Ipswich it was to have been fulfilled; but still, ap-
parently, wishing for an almost impenetrable privacy, he urged the
luckless young woman to dress herself in his apparel, and accompany
him to a part of his premises called the Red Barn. There, he ob-
served, she could exchange them for her own; and there, he assured
ber, he would have a gig in waiting, to convey her, on the ensuing
morning, to the church at Ipswich. Yielding to his representations
,
and wishing to heal her character, which was then suffering by the mali-
gious scandal of a country village, she complied with his request
. Both,
on his persuasion, then left the cottage-Maria by the baek-door, and
Corder by the front; it being, at the same time, arranged that some of
the clothes of poor Maria should be sent back to her father's.

THE RED BARN,
625
Instead, however, of Corder's taking her, as he had assured her, to
Ipswich, he treacherously, and with the most malicious premeditation,
murdered her; and inhumed her body in that part of the barn where it
has since been discovered. No doubt of his iniquitous purpose can exist ,
as on the night when he stated he was with her at Ipswich, he was seen
by her young brother crossing from the Red Barn to his mother's house,
with a pickaxe on his shoulder.
The Red Barn is about half a mile from the Marten cottage. It
stands on the brow of a hill; and in the hollow below, and not a stone's
throw from it is a cottage, at which a shriek might almost be heard.

The spot marked A, is the grave where the body was found, about
eighteen inches under the surface. At C, there are the marks of a charge
of small shot on the side of the Barn, about five feet from the ground,
which appears to have been fired from B, the corn-room; and it has been
conjectured, that while she was changing her male dress for her female
attire, she was shot at from the corn-room, but not wounded, as the whole
charge is evidently lodged in the side of the Barn, and afterwards de-
spatched by stabbing or strangulation. The corpse exhibited marks of
violence on the cheek, as if a blow had been given by some round wea-
fon; and though no ribs were fractured, there was the appearance of the
chest having been beaten inwards, as if by treading or kneeling.
The grave is about five feet long, and eighteen inches deep. It is re-
gularly formed, and was evidently the work of some time. It was,
probably, dug in preparation for the intended victim; and the whole plan
of the murder must have been the result of long previous deliberation
We present our readers with a correct view of the grave, as it appeared a
short time ago.

It is hardly possible to describe the great sensation which this occur.
rence has created. Crowds flock from all quarters to witness the scene
of death, and the Barn is almost torn to pieces by the multitude. The
grave is left open, and has a wild and singular aspect. There are two
cottages within about fifty yards of the Barn ; and it is singular that such
a murder could be perpetrated, as it must have been, between twelve and
four o'clock in the day, and was within ear shot of the houses we have
mentioned; but they were so well known to be in the habit of meeting at
this Barn, that it excited no sort of attention. What became of her male
dress, except the great coat, is not known. The coat was thrown into
the grave, probably from having some marks of blood upon it. The
girl's father had always some suspicions of what had occurred, and has
often walked about the Barn, determined to examine it, but always was
deterred, lest he should find nothing, and be supposed to have raised an
unfounded report.
On the Sunday after Corder committed the vile assassination, he
called upon
Maria's
's mother, and to her earnest inquiries after the situ-
ation and residence of her child, he replied that she was comfortably
settled at home, where he had left her, as it would take more than
three weeks to procure a license, and go through the required fornis.
This explanation satisfied her for a time; bur some weeks elapsing
without any intelligence being received, the agitated parent was more
urgent in her questions, and to calm the importunity, which was now
Decoming most troublesome, another excuse was made-whicn was, that
Maria was most happily settled at the house of an old school-fellow, and
Liet, until her marriage could be accomplished, she was to remain with
ois family at Yarmouth.
Several months passed over, and whenever the parental affection of
Maria's mother induoed her to make a further inquiry after the condition

of ber daughter, Corder's invariable reply was that she was well and
happy; and on two occasions, it being observed that it was extraordinary
she did not communicate with her friends, he met the remark by saying
that her hand was injured by a severe whitlow, which prevented her holding
a pen; that her business, as a milliner, was so pressing, that she had no
time to devote to correspondence; and that all her leisure moments were so
devoted to conjugal attentions, that any communication with her relatives
was a matter of secondary consideration. These vague though plausible
excuses were received as satisfactory, until last September, when he unex-
pectedly left the country, and went up to London. Before his departure,
he endeavoured to guard against the consequences of his guilt; and to
remove all lurking suspicions, he called upon the parents of the murdered
girl, and then told them that he was hastening to his Maria, and that
shortly that union would be effected which had been so long in contempla-
tion. From that time until the day of his (Corder's) apprehension,
the daughter had neither been heard of or seen, nor was it ascer-
tained whether she was secretly made away with, or yet in exist-
Occasionally there were letters from Corder (all bearing the
London post-mark), in which he represented that he was married to
the girl, was as happy as "human wish could make him," and desired
to have his honey-moon congratulations presented to all his friends. The
circumstances that have led to the discovery of a crime, characterized by
an atrocity that, depraved as human nature is, has no precedent, are of a
description at once extraordinary and almost incredible. A few weeks
since, the afflicted mother had a prophetic dream, which demonstrated the
fate of her daughter. The influence consequent on it considerably agitated
her mind; and on two several nights she dreamed that her child was mur-
dered, and that her corpse was buried underneath the right-hand bay (as
she named it) of the further side of Corder's Red Barn. The impression
created by a vision of this nature, the mind, perhaps, being excited by a
previous anxiety on the subject, was proportionately deep; and so much
did it occupy her imagination, that she felt convinced of the truth of its
augury, and her dreams became a topic of conversation between her and
her husband. Her uneasiness hourly increased ; and, after some importu-
nity, her husband was prevailed upon, more from a disposition to satisfy
the suppositions of his aged wife, than from any reliance he placed in the
verity of dreams, to gratify her wishes, and to search the Barn. He
applied for permission to Mrs. Corder, the prisoner's mother, and also to
Pryke, her bailiff, to examine the building, -not, however, mentioning
what his object was. This was readily granted; and he merely said that
he wanted to go there, to see if he could find some of his daughter's clothes,
which he thought might have been forgotten when she was last in the
barn.
The dream proved but too true, for, on his turning up a small portion
of loose earth, at the very spot which his wife had desired him to examine,
he found, not above eighteen inches beneath the surface, the corpse of
his daughter. As may be supposed, but as cannot be described, the
wretched parent was paralysed in feeling, and quite incapable of uttering
a word, or shedding a tear that would give relief to his agonized sensations.
He saw before him the remains of his child;the dream of the mother
was realised; and there lay before him the skeleton of a daughter that was
once lovely, virtuous, and the pride of his cottage.
The fragile remains of mortality were enveloped in a piece of coarse

sackcloth, a circumstance that, in itself, inaicates a violent death, and
also shows a desire to conceal the murderous crime. Maria's clothes
were somewhat perfect, and by them she was identified. Her ear-rings,
& silk handkerchief, a tortoise-shell comb, a Leghorn bonnet trimred
with black ribbon, were almost as fresh as when she left the cottage; and
on her skeleton limbs were found the very shoes which she wore on the
night that she was inveigled away by Corder and so barbarously murdered
Another strange event attendant on this horrifying catastrophe, in the iden-
tification of the body, sprung from the exclamation of Maria's sister, who,
on its being removed from its covering, said, that it could be at once
known whether it was that of her relative, by examining the lower jaw,
in which two of the larger teeth were wanting. The examination was
made, and the deficiency, quite corresponding with that which the sister
had mentioned, discovered.
Information of the crime, and which, from its enormity, has thrown
the village of Polstead into the highest state of excitation, was communi-
cated with the utmost rapidity to J. Weyman, Esq., the Coroner for the
liberty of Polstead. Though resident at some distance (Bury St. Ed-
mund's), he lost not a moment in entering on an inquiry; and, from the
circumstances that transpired on it, he was induced to dispatch a country
constable in pursuit of William Corder. The constable arrived in town
on Monday, and having applied at Lambeth-street for the assistance of
an efficient officer, and advice as to how he was to proceed, Lea was ap-
pointed by the sitting magistrate, Matthew Wyatt, Esq., to accompany
him, and to give the assistance which he required. Lea had a difficult
duty to discharge ;-he was to apprehend Corder, but had not the slightest
trace to where he could be found; he, as he himself states, went from
place to place, until at length, after a chase of many hours, he ascertained
that he had been at one time living on Gray's Inn Terrace; from thence
he tracked him through a number of intermediate places, and finally dis-
covered that he was domesticated at the Grove-house, Ealing-lane,
where his wife superintended a female boarding-school. Some stratagem
was necessary to obtain an entrance; and the officer, fearful of alarming him,
accomplished it by representing that he had a daughter whom he was
anxious to place under the care of Mrs. Corder. On going into the house,
he found the criminal sitting in the parlour, at breakfast
, with four ladies,
unapprehensive that the hour had arrived in which his guilt was to meet
its punishment. He was dressed in a morning gown, and had a watch
lying before him, by which he was minuting the boiling of some eggs. Lea
called him apart, and they retired into the drawing-room: he then informed
him that he was a London police officer, and had to apprehend him on a
most serious charge. He seemed startled at the intelligence; and on
being made acquainted with the character of the offence, he disclaimed all
knowledge of its committal, and denied ever having heard of the wretched
Maria.
Lea, after having secured him, proceeded to search both his person and
drawers, and discovere 1 a number of letters from his sister, and a person
named Gardener; in the latter of which, warnings were given and cautions
held out of a very singular description. He also found a case of deto-
nating pocket-pistols-maker's name, Harcourt, Ipswich, -which are sup-
posed to has been purchased on the day antecedent to the murder. There
were also a powder-flask and some balls, and a passport for France, dated
the 20th of December, 1827; from which it appears that he purposed

leaving this country for the Continent, but, fortunately for Lue ends of
justice, he did not carry his intention into effect, but still, like the moth,
lingered about the flame that was to consume him.
The pistols were inclosed in a black velvet reticule, which has since
been sworn to as the property of Maria Marten, and the same which she
took with her on the night of her going to the Red Barn. There was in
it, then, over six pounds, no account of which had been, as yet, obtained;
but the presumption is, that Corder, to the crime of murder, has super-
added that of robbery, and appropriated the contents to his own use.
Previous to his removal to town, his brother-in-law, Mr. Moore, a re-
spectable jeweller residing in the neighbourhood of Gray's-Inn-lane,
having, by some means, ascertained the inhuman atrocity with which the
culprit was charged, questioned his sister as to the length of time she had
known him before she so irrevocably bound her fate to his ? She an-
swered, for three weeks only : that she first became acquainted with him at
Seaford; that she next met him, casually, at a pastrycook's shop in Fleet-
street; and that her marriage arose out of a matrimonial advertisement,
in which a reference was given to Mr. F., a stationer in Cheapside. The
marriage ceremony was performed in last November, at the church of St.
Andrew, Holborn; and she was then, as now, quite ignorant of his ever
having given any cause for censure.
Mr. Moore expressed an indignant surprise at the hasty and unreflect-
ing manner in which she had engaged in so serious a transaction, and de-
clared, that for his part, he would by no means shelter a person who
could be capable of even imagining so barbarous a crime. At three
o'clock on Wednesday, Corder was transmitted, by the Defiance coach, in
the keeping of Lea, to Colchester, from thence to be removed to Polstead,
to await the result of the Coroner's investigation, which was to be resumed
on Friday.
During his detention at Lambeth-street, his wife, whose impression
then was that the charge against him was that of bigamy, visited him in
the strong room, and remained with him the greater portion of the forenoon
So intense was the interest that prevailed in Suffolk, that Sir William
Rowley, M.P., and one of his brother magistrates, proceeded expressly
to town to lend their assistance towards the discovery of the murderer.
Not alone did an anxiety prevail in Suffolk to develope this mysterious
occurrence, but so much did it monopolize the attention of the metropolis,
that the principal journals in London thought it necessary to send special
reporters to furnish the fullest particulars, both of the incidents connected
with the murder, and of the testimony given on the Coroner's Inquest; and
from their accounts we collect, that the deed, committed under circum-
stances partaking more of the character of fiction than truth, had created
an excitement beyond the power of description, in Colchester, and through
Suffolk and the neighbouring counties.
Corder arrived at the George Inn, in Colchester, at nine o'clock; but
his being taken into custody being anticipated, it is scarcely necessary to
observe, that immense crowds were congregated to gratify their curiosity,
and see the man whose imputed guilt had shocked the better feelings of
humanity. While on the road from London, he conducted himself with an
un feeling levity that indicated the baseness of his mind; and, as he ap-
proached the town he recognized many persons, but they returned not his
salute; and those who had previously known, anxiously shunned him,
and appeared to feel a shuddering on beholding him. No one expressed

the slightest commiseration for his condition; but hisses and execrations,
both loud and bitter, pursued him till he had retreated into a private room
at the George. Lea proceeded to Mr. Smith, the Governor of the Castle,
a building made use of as a place of imprisonment, and requested him to
receive Corder into his custody for the night'; but this he refused, saying,
"I can't take charge of him, for I have nobody to look after him ; and
being charged with so dreadful an offence, it may so happen that he will
lay violent hands on himself, for which I should be held accountable."
Lea then accompanied the Governor to the residence of Mr. Able, a ma-
gistrate, and having explained to him the character of the crime with
which his prisoner was accused, requested that he might be lodged in a
secure place for the night.
Mr. Able said, that the Castle was the most secure; but Mr. Smith re-
plied, that he could not be taken there, as it was out of his the magis-
trate's) jurisdiction; and that, as no warrant of commitment had been pro-
duced by the officer, he must decline receiving the prisoner.
It was next proposed that Corder should, for the short time he had to
remain in Colchester, be confined in the Town Gaol, but it being discovered
that that prison was insecure, the intention was abandoned ; and it was
ultimately determined that he and the officer, handcuffed together, should
remain at the George. The prisoner ate a hearty supper, and seemed to
be very little concerned at the awful situation in which he was placed. He
retired to bed at an early hour, and, for his greater security, it was con-
sidered prudent to tie one of his hands to the bed-post, and lock the other
to that of Lea, with whom he slept. On the ensuing day he arose about
eight o'clock, and partook of a slight refreshment. He was visited in the
forenoon by Sir William Rowley, M.P., and several of the country ma-
gistrates; but to every advance they made towards a conversation on the
crime with which he was accused, he turned a deaf ear. The Rev. Mr.
Seaman, a minister of the established church, also called upon him, and,
prior to his doing so, several considerate individuals furnished him with a
number of serious and religious publications. On his introduction to
Corder, Mr. Seaman informed him that he had been formerly personally
acquainted with his family, particularly his brothers, who were since dead,
and that he was anxious to render him every assistance and consolation
that was in his power; and, with that view, he presented him with a New
Testament and a Hymn book, and earnestly and emphatically directed
his attention to reflection and spiritual consideration. Mr. S. interro-
gated Corder concerning his participation in the murder;the word parti-
cipation is used, because it was confidently rumoured that more than one
person was engaged in the crime ;--and pressed him very closely to confess
his guilt, and disburthen his mind of the weight under which it must la-
bour; but, to every entreaty, he continued obdurate, and replied in the
same words he had made use of during his journey from London"I
shall say nothing now." During the earlier part of Thursday, he occu-
pied himself in writing, and filled two sides of a sheet of paper, which,
scarcely had he done, when he started up in an uncontrollable agitation,
and flung it into the fire. This, since his apprehension, was the only occa-
sion on which he gave any evidence of his not being utterly insensible to
feeling. He wrote, also, a letter to his mother on the Wednesday night,
of which the following is a copy, and of which we lay before the reader
a fac-similo.

" Colchester, George Inn,
* WEAR MOTIER,
"Wednesday Night, 11 o'clock.
"I SCARCELY dare to presume to address you, having a full knowledge
of the shame, disgrace, and, I may truly add, for ever, a stain upon my
family, friends, and late-formed connexions. I have but a few minutes
to write ; and being unfortunately labouring under this unfortunate charge,
I have to solicit that you will receive Mr. Moore on Friday morning, with
whom, probably, may be my injured, lawful and I must do her the justice
to say-worthy and affectionate wife. I have always experienced from
every branch of their family the kindest treatment;-hope and trust that the
same will be returned from you the short time they continue in this part of
the country, which, I am sorry I have to state, is to hear the event of this
dreadful catastrophe. I am happy to hear you are tolerable, considering
the present circumstances. I may, perhaps, be allowed an interview
with you in a day or two; but that, I find, is very uncertain. I must beg
to subscribe myself your unfortunate, though unworthy son,
W. CORDER."
[The words "though unworthy," were erased, but are yet distinguish-
able.)
Addressed"Mrs. Corder, Polstead by Stoke,
Favoured by Mr. Catchpool."
This letter he afterwards thought proper not to send, and intreated of
Lea, into whose possession it had got, so important did he feel were its
contents, to commit it to the flames. This, as may be supposed, was not
complied with, and it was expected to form a part of the evidence
produced on his trial.
In the course of the evening Corder referred occasionally to the books
which had been supplied him, and, at one time, in an incidental allusion to
his wife, he exclaimed"Oh! would that I were as innocent of sin as
she is !" At about nine o'clock two gentlemen arrived at the George, and
having an interview with Lea, told him that, addition to his other crimes,
they had to prefer a charge of forgery against Corder, committed under
such peculiar circumstances as demonstrated that he was a culprit of no
ordinary magnitude, and a person who had head and heart to execute the
most cool, deliberate, and barefaced iniquity. One of the gentlemen, Mr.
Taylor, who is the principal clerk in the banking-house of Messrs. Alex-
ander and Co., the proprietors of several country banks, stated, that on the
Monday week before, a man of respectable appearance passed a forged
check for the sum of 931. on the Manningtree Branch, whose person cor.
responded to an accuracy with the description of that given of Corder.
He was about five feet six inches in height, wore a drab great coat, a
plaid lilac handkerchief, a black dress coat, and blue pantaloons, and had
rather a large nose, a small face, and a ring on the little finger of his right
hand. The check which he produced, and on which he obtained the mo-
ney, was forged, and was in the following form:
"Hadleigh Bank, Suffolk,

time, he privately compared its handwriting with that in the boxy of the
sheck, and found that they must have been written by the same person
Mr. Taylor was accompanied by Mr. Dale, the landlord of the White
Hart Inn at Manningtree;. and, at his desire, they were at once intro-
duced to him, but with the necessary precaution of having, at the time,
several other persons present, in order to guard against any after-doubt
being raised of Corder's identity. On entering the apartment in which he
was confined, Mr. Taylor immediately pointed out the offender, and, ex-
tending his hand in a most marked manner, said to Lea, " That is the
person who got from me, on last Monday week, 931. on a forged check."
Corder, on the recognition, was quite confounded; he lost all that cool
ness and presence of mind which, up to this moment, he had exhibited ; and
on the unexpected announcement of the discovery of another of the deeds
on his catalogue of crime, he suddenly appeared as'if under the influence
of the torpedo, and became powerless both in mind and body; his head
dropped languidly on his bosom, and all his recollection and self-posses-
sion, which were taken as an evidence of his innocence, vanished ere the
lapse of a second; and, in a word, there was, for the time, a pitiable pros-
tration of the physical and mental powers. On his recovery from his
lethargy, Mr. Taylor, addressing him for the first time, said"Come, sir,
pay me the 93l. you have so fraudulently robbed us of: look at me like a
man; don't conceal your face, but view me directly." Corder still re-
mained silent for nearly a minute, and seemed quite unconscious and
abstracted. Memory then resumed her seat, and, throwing his hands
over his eyes, as if with the intention of excluding from his sight an enemy
positive and distinct, and whose declaration of his minor, but not less
capital offence, now appalled him, he sank gradually into a chair which
happened to have been behind him. Mr. Taylor, commiserating his
situation,-a situation which merited not the slightest pity,-closed his
interview, and retired from the apartment.
In the course of the night he communicated to Lea the circumstances,
which were corroborated by Mr. Dale, under which the forged check had
been discounted. On Monday, the 14th of April, Corder arrived, at an
early hour in the morning, at the White Hart Inn, in Manningtree, and
being in conversation with Mr. Dale, its landlord, he mentioned, as the
reason of his coming to that part of the country, his having some business
to transact at the banking-house of the Messrs. Alexanders. This was
situated directly opposite to the White Hart, and Mr. Dale, anxious to
accommodate his guest, though the Bank was not then opened, told him
that if his business was very urgent, he would speak to the clerk, aad
have it despatched before the ordinary hour at which the doors were
thrown open. To this kind offer, for which Corder expressed his thanks,
he replied, that he was by no means in haste; but it turned out that he
was; and while Mr. Dale was shortly afterwards standing at his door,
Mr. Taylor happened to pass by, and he then informed that gentleman,
that there was a visitor at his house, who, he understood, had some busi-
ness to transact at the bank. In about an hour after the bank was
opened, Corder presented the check to Mr. Taylor, and asked for cash
for it.  Mr. Taylor, in reply to his demand, said that he was unac-
quainted either with the drawer, Mr. Atkins, or with Mr. Cooke, in whose
favour it was made payable; and that it was not customary with their
house to discount any checks unless they the parties. This rehuff

no means daunted Corder, and he represented himself as Mr. Cooke ;
nd said that he was a farmer at Wenlam-Hall, and that he had taken
the check, on the preceding Saturaay, from a Mr. Atkins, a butcher at
Stratford, in payment for five head of cattle which he had sold to him.
Mr. Taylor observed, that he had never seen the name of Atkins to a
Hadleigh check before, and that therefore he had his doubts of its cor-
rectness. Corder assured him that every thing was right; that he
was well known in the neighbourhood ; that he kept an account
with the Hadleigh Branch, and that Mr. Dale, the landlord of the
White Hart, could tell him who he was. Acted on by these asser-
tions, Mr. Taylor said, that if such were the fact, and if Mr. Dale
came over and said he knew him, that would satisfy him. Mr. Dale
shortly afterwards came with Corder to the bank, and having known him
by sight, and before seen him frequently,--a circumstance that he men.
tioned,the check was discounted. In payment, he received eighty-five
pounds in five pound local notes, and the balance, eight pounds, in one
pound notes. Corder immediately left the place, and proceeded with
rapidity to the Branch Banking Establishment, at Ipswich, where he
obtained gold for the notes. On the same night, Mr. Taylor had occa-
sion to send to the Hadleigh Bank, and he there ascertained that the
check was a forgery; and also learned that Mr. Atkins, who is a respect-
alile butcher in the village of Stratford, had no knowledge of its being
drawn. The check itself was filled up on a printed form of the Had-
'eigh Bank, and it is supposed that he had obtained it at his mother's, who
was formerly in the habit of keeping an account with that establishment
The only observation Corder made, when convinced that there was a
charge of forgery preferred against him, was, " I dare say they will try
and make enough of it."
In a conversation which took place between Lea and Mr. Taylor, the
former said, that he had it in his power to state a fact confirmatory of
the second charge advanced against his prisoner. When he took him
into custody at his house in Ealing-lane, he removed him to the Red
Lion public-house in the neighbourhood,which by the way was, as if by
a more than usual fatality, formerly kept by the uncle of his wife,and
having there placed him in safe keeping, returned to the Grove House,
and examined it carefully; when he came back to the Red Lion, Corder
asked him, had he not found eighty sovereigns in a private drawer
of his writing desk? He told him that he had not; and Corder then
said, " My wife must certainly have taken them out;" send for her. Mrs.
Corder shortly arrived, and she gave to her guilty husband twenty sove-
reigns, admitting at the same time that she had taken the sum looked after
from the secret drawer of the desk.
At 12 o'clock on the Thursday night, Corder was removed from the
George, under an escort, and conveyed with the greatest celerity to Pol-
stead, where he was accommodated with a bed at a small inn, or
rather public-house, called "the Cock." His departure at so late
an hour was in accordance with the advice of Sir William Rowley, M.P.,
who, with as much prudence as humanity, suggested that it would prevent
the explosion of any popular effervescence, and the congregation of an
incensed and curious public; but independent of this, as the prisoner
would be obliged, in his transmission, to pass under the window of his
aged and respectable mother, it would be an outrage on human nature to
render her perhaps, a witness to the disgraceful ciroumstances in which be

THE RED BARN.
vas placed, while conducting to hos then destination, and passing the roal
in which he had at one time hived unblemished and undishonoured.
On the morning of Friday, the day to which Mr. Weyman had ada
ourned the inquisition, crowds of persons, among whom were some gentle-
men dispatched by the London journals, to ascertain, from personal obser.
vation, the truth of any rumours that might be afloat, visited the Red
Barnthe place where this unparalleled tragedy was committed : it is
situated in a valley, at about a mile's distance across the fields from the
cottage of Maria's parents; this stands on the brow of a hill, and is
rather picturesquely situated; the Barn is of that description which
in Suffolk is called double, and a view of which we lay before the
reader. The discovery of the murdered girl's remains was made
by her father, and a neighbour of the name of Pryke; the dreaming
story possesses some portion of incredibility, and it would, were it not
that the fact has been so well testified on oath, appear altogether unde-
serving of attention. One feature in it would be supposed to have been
taken from the tales of old, and hears a strong resemblance to an inci-
dent detailed in the Romance of "The Old English Baron;" it is that of
the parent directly going to the spot designated in his wie's vision as the
place of his daughter's sepulture. Whether influenced by a supernatural
interposition, or instigated by his wife's entreaties, he, on entering the Barn,
certainly did so; and as, in another part of this work, has been men-
tioned, was assured that his partner's impression was correct, and that
his complying with her wishes was only acting in obedience to the decrees
of an all-seeing Power. Lying on the corpse of his wretched offspring
were a number of loose stones, and on them was placed some earth,
which, probably operated on by the decomposition undergoing beneath it,
had not combined or cemented in so close a manner as, from the interval
that had clapsed since the murder took place, might naturally have been
expected. The first thing that presented itself to the astonished view of
the old man, was a portion of a shawl, which he instantly recognized as
Maria's; and such an effect had the discovery on him, that in a state
almost delirious, he speeded to the clergyman of the parish, when, in a
manner almost frantic, he informed him that they had at last discovered
the corpse of his murdered daughter.
Mrs. Martin, the step-mother, and not the mother, as has been erro-
neously but unintentionally stated, did not accompany her husband on
the occasion of his appalling discovery; and, from this circumstance, great
douot existed among the people in the vicinity, of the veracity of the
announcement that this most wicked event was brought to light at so
remote a period as Eleven Months after its perpetration : these doubts
have, however, now vanished, and the dream or excitement of imagina-
tion created by the mind constantly dwelling on the subject, proves the
mysterious, though unexplanatory, means by which Providence illustrates
the punishment of the dark-minded assassin, and shows, by means in-
scrutable to man, the murdered
Blood of a brother will cry out from the ground."
When old Marten returned, the exhumation was proceeded with ;; but the
lower part of the frame was so decomposed, that it afforded not the pos-
sibility of being identified. Her bust was in a different condition, and
60 remained for some time, but not so long as to undergo the primary
view of the Coroner's Jury: at the bottom of the pit was found a top

soat, which she wore on the day on which she left her father's house,
and on the night on which she is supposed to have been murdered ; it was
quite bloody, and from this it is inferred that it was buried with the body,
The gown, if there had been any, had decayed, but round the waist was
a portion of a pair of stays. The bonnet, ear-rings, shawl, and a comb,
were identified as having belonged to the deceased. On the recovery of
her corpse, it was placed on a door, and while placing it in its position,
one of the hands fell off. From the length of the grave, and its depth,
and the hardness of the soil it was sunk in, several hours must have been
occupied in its excavation. And this, when combined with other circum-
stances, shows a hardihood and a determination in the atrocious murderer,
seldom attendant on the most vicious. The present impression is, that
Maria was changing the male attire for her female, when she was assas-
sinated; and on going to the place of appointment, it was ascertained
that one party departed at the front door, while the other went out at the
back. Corder, at the time, had a gun in his hand, which he accounted for
by saying that he had been out shooting crows.
As a further confirmation of the accused's guilt, it appears that on the
afternoon of the fatal day, he called at a cottage at about 50 yards' dis-
tance from the Barn, and borrowed a spade from one of the inmates.
The corpse was removed to the Cock public-house, where it was sub-
mitted to the inspection of a medical man; and after his having made a
minute examination, he declared it as his opinion, that the os frontis had
teen penetrated. It was tied up in a sack before it was buried, a small
portion of which only remains, which adhered to the neck, and is of the
width of about two inches. On the legs was a silk handkerchief, in a
rotten state, which was thrown over them into the grave. Corder is his
mother's youngest son, and was eonsidered as her favourite. About
righteen months
ago,
his two brothers died, when he fell into the posses-
sion of property of above 10001. in amount, and he then returned to
Polstead, professedly to manage the frm. He then renewed an intimacy
which had previously subsisted between him and Maria, but it is but jus-
lice to say, that he was not the first seducer; she had been before on
terms of an illicit intercourse with a Mr. Matthews, a gentleman of respec-
tability, and a near relative to the Lady of the Manor, by whom she had
two children. She subsequently bore a child to Corder, who having inter-
cepted some letters containing sums of money sent to her by Mr. M. for
the support of his children, and the fact having come to that gentleman's
knowledge, he preferred a charge against him before a magistrate ; but
ultimately was compelled to abandon it, as Maria refused coming forward
o furnish the - required evidence. The child of which Corder was the
kither, died very suddenly; and on being questioned on the subject, old
Marten admitted that Corder had removed its corpse, in a box, from his
cottage at 12 o'clock at night, but where to he could not say; though
his impression was, that it was buried in the barn. Search has been made
for it, but to no purpose. A rumour was very prevalent that it also had
fallen by the hands of Corder, but the grandfather does not eredit it, and
expresses a conviction that it came fairly to its end. Corder's motive
for murdering his paramour, is said to be her having threatened to bring
him to justice for the murder of his infant; but as there is not sufficient
proof of this, it must be taken as an idle rumour.
In further explanation of this revolting murder, we give another

extract; and we do so the more readily, as we are anxious to supply the
most authentio details.
Corder reached his destination at the Cock, at 2 o'clock on the morn
ing of Friday, and had a short but restless sleep. He conversed with
the officer as the chaise was passing his mother's house, on some family
affairs, and alluded to the number of deaths that had taken place within
it for the last two years. About eighteen months ago, one of his brothers
was drowned in a large pond; and before that period, he lost his father;
and since then, his remaining brother. He mentioned his mother with
great apparent affection, and said that he feared not death on his own
account, but did on hers, as he was apprehensive that his disgrace would
bring her to the grave.
The village of Polstead, the vicinity of which has been the scene of
Corder's imputed offence, is a miserable place, and in a most secluded
situation. It contains but one public-house, which was occupied by the
Coroner and the witnesses, and about forty small houses, which are prin-
cipally cottages. The Coroner and Jury, after the latter was impanelled,
proceeded to visit the Red Barn, and on their examination, found, in one
of the doors, some shot marks ; and on the floor some stains of a bloody
hue. Since the murder was perpetrated (and never before, which is an
additional link in the chain of evidence) Corder always assisted in stack-
ing the wheat, and he himself invariably placed the straw and first layers,
over the spot from whence the corpse was disinterred. This was a task
he had never before attempted, neither did he, prior to the May of 1827,
express any wish to procure the key of the Barn; but from that time up
to the period when he left home, he never let it escape from his possession.
Many individuals, who have examined the premises, are of opinion that
the young girl was murdered in some of those dark paths which lead from
her father's to the Barn, and that her remains were afterwards dragged
there, and interred. This supposition, however, appears improbable; and
particularly so, when we fecollect that the Red Barn was the customary
place of jo ir interviews, and that there they had passed many hours
together.
INQUEST ON THE BODY.
The Inquest, which was adjourned from the previous Sunday, again
assembled at half-past 10 o'clock on Friday, the 25th of April, at the
Cock public-house, Polstead; and the Coroner having taken his seal,
the Jury were about to resume the inquiry, when that officer, perceiving a
number of gentlemen in the inquest room, connected with the London
press, interposed for a time, and addressing them, said :"Gentlemen, as
the present is merely a preliminary inquiry, but yet one affecting the life
of an individual, who stands charged with the inhuman crime of murder,
and as I presume
that the purpose
of
your attendance is to give publicity
to the evidence, I cannot, in the conscientious discharge of my duty,
allow you to take notes of the proceedings. It has been decided,
that the publication of evidence affecting the life of an accused person,
before trial, is a misdeme your ; and if I granted a permission or sanction

637
to your giving publicity to such evidence as may be brought before the
Court
, I should be aiding and abetting you in the commission of that
which the law has pronounced an offence. In stating this much, I do
not venture to offer my own private opinion as to the good or harm that
may result from publishing the evidence in a case of this description; but
even supposing that my private opinion inclined to publicity, I cannot,
sitting here as Coroner, countenance that which the law has con-
demned."
A Reporter.1 admit, Sir, by a recent decision, a Coroner has the
power to prevent notes being taken; but he has also the discretion, either
to exercise that power or not, as he might judge proper. Lord Tenter-
den's decision did not extend to the exclusion of the public.
Another Reporter asked the Coroner whether it would not be better to
permit notes to be taken, in order that a correct report of the depositions
on oath might be published, rather than by enforcing an authority very few
Coroners thought it expedient to exercise, that a garbled, and necessarily
inaccurate and incomplete, account of the proceedings should go forth to the
public?
The Coroner. I feel no inclination to argue what might be best, nor
shall I, as I have before said, give my opinion upon the expediency of the
haw; I have found it as it is, and I am bound to abide by it.
Another Reporter.He would take the publication, with its conse-
ruences, on his own individual responsibility, if the Coroner would only
permit him to take notes.
The Coroner.The question of publishing evidence has already been
decided on in the case of Rex v. Flint, the proprietor, I believe, of a
Brighton paper, and the decision was against him for publishing the pro-
ceedings antecedent to the trial.
Some further conversation of an unimportant nature then took place
between the Reporters and the Coroner; at the close of which the former
put up their books, and the inquiry was proceeded with. If there are any
inaccuracies in the report, they must be attributed to the obstacles the
Reporters have experienced, and their being obliged to depend altogether
on memory
The first witness called, was
John Boalham, who, on being sworn, deposed that he was a constable of Polstead;
he had not, at any time during the month of May last, nor at any subsequent period,
informed William Corder, the person who was charged with the murder of Maria
Marten, that he had a warrant for her apprehension for giving birth to illegitimate
children that bad become chargeable to the parish.
Coroner.-The reason I have put this question to you is, that Mrs. Marten, the
mother of the deceased, in her depositions of last Sunday, stated, that the pretext
ibe prisoner, William Corder, made use of to urge bis marriage with ber daughter,
was, that be (Baalham) had told him that the Rev. Mr. Whitmore, the rector of
the parish, and a justice of the peace, bad issued bis warrant tu apprehend her on
charges of bastardy, of which sbe was guilty prior to her connexion with him.
Mr. Humphries, a solicitor from London, here entered the Inquest-room
and informed the Coroner that he attended as the representative of the
prisoner, William Corder; and, in that character, he applied, that his
client might he permitted to be present to hear the evidence adduced
against him, and thus be enabled, with the assistance of his professiona.
adviser, to put such questions to the several witnesses as might lead to his
exculpation of the grave charge which was preferred against him.
The Corner replied, that, in his opinion, the accused could claim na

638
THE RED BAAN
right of being present: within his experience, he never knew of an appli-
cation of the kind being made or granted; and, in now refusing the soli-
citor's request, he conceived himself warranted by the circumstance, that
a party charged with a capital offence was not legally entitled to a copy
of the depositions on which he had been committed for trial.
Mr. Humphries said, that it could not be expected, and, in point of
fact, it was impossible, that his client could meet so grave an accusation
unless he went into Court prepared with something of the evidence which
had previously been advanced against him; and the Coroner must know,
by the statute of " Philip and Mary," that in a case of felony, the
persons charged had a right to hear the evidence given against them on
examination before the justices, previous to trial.
The Coroner asked Mr. Humphries if ne could cite an analogous case
from the books; or one showing that a person accused of murder was
entitled to be present during the proceedings on the Inquest holden on view
of the body of the murdered party ?
Mr. Humphries replied that he could, and quoted the case of Richard
Patch, whom he (Mr. H.) prosecuted to conviction for the murder of Mr.
Bligh. Patch was not only present at the Inquest, but was allowed to give
evidence. The jury, on that occasion, returned a verdict of " Wilful
Murder" against some person or persons unknown.
The Coroner.Patch was not, at the time he was examined, in
custody, therefore I cannot consider this as a precedent.
Mr. Humphries.-Well, Sir, I can give you one directly in point, that
occurred in the murder of Mr. Weare : Hunt and Probert were charged
with the capital felony, but they were, nevertheless, permitted to attend
before the jury at Elstree, and, in fact, their testimony was received by
the Coroner. "Some further conversation took place on the legality of
Corder's witnessing the proceedings between the Coroner and Mr. H.,
which terminated in the latter gentleman saying that he would not then
press the point, provided it was understood that his client would be per-
mitted, at the close of the inquiry, to hear the several depositions read
over before the witnesses were bound over to prosecute. This was agreed
to, and the Coroner then read over some evidence supplied by George
Marke, a lad of about fourteen years of age, and the balf-brother of the
deceased, in addition to that which he had given on the preliminary in-
vestigation ; from it it was collected, that he, the deponent, saw the pri-
soner, he having a bundle at the time, and the deceased, go from his
father's house together, at about twelve o'clock at noon, on the 19th of
May, 1827; his sister had then men's clothes on. He also saw the pri-
soner leaving the Barn about two o'clock on the same evening, and he
then had a pickaxe in his hand.The testimony of Phabe Stowe was
next read; and the only fact of importance which she had sworn to was,
that the prisoner had borrowed a spade from her on the afternoon of the
day on which, there is every reason to believe, that the murder had been
committed.
Francis Stowe, her busband, deposed, that he knew nothing of the spade being
lent to the prisoner. During the foregoing year be had worked for his mother, Mrs.
Corder.
The first corn they had cut down, last harvest, was placed in the layer
where the body was found ; the prisoner superintended its being laid down. On one
day, during the harvest, the prisoner came to him, and said he would give him a one
pound note if he would cut bis throat; but he told him he would do no such thing.
The Red Barn was consiantly kept locked; and helore the wheat was put in, the hay
was well littered down with straw. The prisoner was present when the first and

second loads were stowed away. He never heard of any extraordinary smell being
perceived in that part of the Barn where the body was discovered.
William lonns examined.--I am a labourer, and work for the prisoner's motbor.
During the last-barvest the prisoner directed the laying of the wheats . there was,
before that, a good deal of litter strewed on the floor where the body was found, but
be did not know that it was fresbly laid on, since the barvest before. Last year's
corn was all out before Stoke fair, wbich takes place on the 16th of May. He had
ao recollection of the prisoner's saying to Stowe that he would give him a one pound
note for cutting bis throat. Both the bays of the Barn were littered.
Ann Marten examined.She is the sister to the deceased, and knew the body that
was found to be that of her sister, by the absence of a tooth in one of the jaws, the
clothes, oar-rings, comb, hair, and shoes, which were shown to her, she could iden-
tify as her relative's. On the night before-mentioned, the deceased and the prisoner,
William Corder, left ber father's together, and Corder said they were going to be
married. The deceased was dressed in a suit of the prisoner's clotbes, and on leav-
ing, they went towards the. Red Barn ; when they got there the deceased was to
exchange ber dress for her own clothes, wbich the prisoner took with him in a bundle.
Tbey departed nearly at the same time, one by the back door, and the other by the
front: this they did to escape observation; and arranged that they were again to
meet each other. The deceased was not pregnant at the time.
Thomas Marten - stated, that he was the father of the deceased Maria Marten.
She had borne an illegitimate child to a gentleman named Matthews, and one to
the prisoner, William Corder. He remembered the day when she went with bim
for the purpose of being married; it was on the 19th of last May. The prisoner saic
that be bad got a licence, but that it must be sent to London to be signed, and that
it would be three weeks before their marriage could take place ; in the mean time,
be said, that the deceased was going to reside with a lady, named Rowland, at Yar-
mouth, where she was to remain until the ceremony could be performed. In a few
days afterwards the prisoner told him that the deceased was well and bappy, and was
then stopping at Yarmouth. After a long time bad elapsed, and not bearing from
per, he asked the prisoner why she did not write to her friends,-she being able to
do so? He replied, she was unable, from having a sore hand. On Friday last, be
entered the Barn, in company with a man of the name of Prykm, and, on making a
strict search, discovered the body of his daughter in a bole about two feet deep
The child, which she had by Corder, died very suddenly, and at a late bour of the
night; its corpse was enclosed in a box and taken away by bim to be buried.
Ann Marten stated, that she was the wife of the last witness; and, as she believed,
the reason of the deceased going out with the prisoner in a man's dress was to pre-
vent the parish officers seeing her: the prisoner before that had told her that Baal-
ham, the constable, informed bim that a warrant was issued to apprehend her for
having borne some bastard children; and that he was anxious to marry her, in order
to prevent ber being taken into custody; the warrant, he said, was issued by the
Rev. Mr. Wbitmore. The deceased consented to accompany Corder to Ipswich, where
be promised they should be married. They had some conversation, in the course of
which her daughter said, that i she could arrive at the Bam in men's clothes, she
could then exchange them for her own, and leave the village with Corder unnoticed
by any one. When be left the bouse he had a loaded gun in his band, and a bundle
containing the deceased's clothes; among the articles she took with her, was a
black velvet reticule, which, if she saw, she could recogoizs.
At this period of the inquiry the remains of the deceased were exhi-
bited to the witness, and she distinctly identified the bloody neckerchief
which was found around the throat, and the bonnet, shoes, and ear-
rings, as those which Maria Marten had worn on the night she left
bome.
James Lea examined.--I am an officer of the Lambeth-street division of police in
London ; I apprehended the prison William Cord at the Grove-house Boarding-
school, in Ealing-lane, near Brentford, on Tuesday last. I took him into custody
on a charge of baving murdered a female, named Maria Marten. When I saw him,
I told him that I was a London police officer, and bad come to apprehend him on a
most serious charge, and that then he was to consider himself as my prisoner. Tho
remark he made to me was, "Very well, Sir." I told him, that the cause of his
apprehension was respecting a young woman, named Maria Marten, with whom be
formerly kept company at Polstead, in Suffolk, who had been missing for a length of
tings and that there were strong suspicions attached to him concerning her fate

THE RED BARN
Ho said that he never knew such a person, even by name. I desired bim to take
lumno, and took the prisoner to the Red Lion public-house, at Brentford. On the
way thither, I told him that the body of Maria Marten had been found. He mado
no reply at first, but when we had got about twenty yards, be asked me when it
was found.
William Towns, the foreman to the prisoner's mother, examined.- Last harvest,
the prisoner ordered the bay in the Red Barn to be filled with wheat; I think the
fodder or litter had remained there since the year before. The bay was cleared
of corn last year, before Stoke fair, wbich begins on the 16th of May. William
Corder managed the farm after his brother's dearb.
Mr. Robert Offord examined. I am a cutler, and live at Hadleigh. About this
time last year, or a little before, William Corder came to my shop with a small
sword, with a cimeter blade, about twelve inches long; it had an ivory bandle,
and was mounted with brass. He wished it to be ground, and be made as sharp as
a carving-knife. He said he bad a cousin going to be married, and that he should
sit at the bead of the table to carve with it! I did as I was directed, and he
called for it the same evening, and paid for it.
Mr. John Lawtur examined.-I am a surgeon, and live at Boxford. I was present
when the body was viewed by the gentlemen of the Jury, and made as minute an
examination as I could. I first look off some pieces of sack which covered it; ibe
body was lying upon the right side, with the head forced down upon the sboulder.
There was an appearance of coagulated blood upon the cheek, and there appeared
to be blood upon the clothes and bandkercbies. The green bandkerchief round
the neck had been pulled tight, so that a man's band migbt be put between the
knot and the fold, and under it there was the appearance of a wound from a sharp
instrument, but that part was so decomposed, I can only say that it had that appears
ance. The internal bone of the oroit of the right eye was fractured, as i a pointed
instrument had been thrust into it, and the bone dividing the nose was displaced ;
the brain was in such a fluid state, that I am unable to say wbether it bad susa
tained any injury or not. Such a stab as I have described might have penetrated
the brain. I found no injury in any other part; but there were two small por.
tions of bone in the throat, which might have passed thither from the nose or
orbit of the eye. I think the handkerchief was drawn tight enougb to have carised
deatb; the neck of the deceased appeared very much compressed indeed. I'he
sack bad evidently been tied after the deceased* had been put in head foremost.
I had the mouth of the sack in my band.
Mr. Humphries then proposed, that as the evidence had been gone
through, his client should be permitted to come into the room to hear it
read.
The Coroner ordered the officers to be sent for, and commanded them
to produce Corder.
During the Inquest, Corder had been confined in an upper room, accom-
panied by a constable; and when Lea told him for what purpose bis
presence was required below, he scarcely made a reply, but prepared to
accompany the officer.
Lea then ushered the prisoner into the room, properly handcuffed, and
every eye was fixed upon him. He was enveloped in a large Spanish
cloak, and appeared extremely exhausted and agitated ; indeed, he
scarcely seemed capable of supporting himself from fainting. This being
observed, the Coroner ordered him. a chair, and then commenced reading
the evidence which had been adduced against him. While the Coroner
was thus employed, the prisoner sometimes appeared very much agitated,
and at others so absorbed in thought, as to be apparently inattentive to
what was passing; his mind and body seemed to be completely over-
In a supplementary, deposition, since the exhumation of the body, this witness
gives it as his decided opinion, that a pistol ball entered the neck about the jugular
tein, and proceeded, in an oblique direction, to the eye on the opposite side of
me head, which would bave produced the fracture before alluded to on the orbit.

whelmed. When the depositions taken on the Sunday, when the Marten
family were examined, had been read, Mr. Humphries, the solicitor,
advised the prisoner to retire, and confide in him for the rest, in which
request the prisoner seemed willing to acquiesce.
Before he left the room, the Coroner addressed him, and said, " Wil-
liam Corder, you are charged with the wilful murder of Maria Marten,
and I shall be very happy to hear anything which you have to say, or
listen to any evidence which you can adduce, in proof of your innocence.
You have heard what some of the witnesses have said against you, there-
fore you are at liberty to invalidate their testimony if you can, or be
silent, as you may think proper." After advising with his attorney, ior
by this time the prisoner had become more composed, he rose, and bowing
to the Coroner, as if to thank him for his kind advice, retired with the
officer without uttering a word, and he was re-conducted to his former
apartinent to await the verdict of the Jury.
Mr. Weyman then addressed the Jury, and observed, that, as the evi-
dence was concluded, he would recapitulate the whole of it if they
thought proper, and make such comments upon it as might appear neces-
sary, as he deemed no exertion of his own too great in an affair of such
momentous importance. That a murder had been committed, there
could not be the least possible doubt; and the question for the Jury to
consider at present was not by what instrument or weapon the deceased
came by her death, but merely to say whether there had been suficient
evidence to convince them that the prisoner was the murderer.
Mr. Green, the Foreman, having conferred with his brother Jurors,
informed the Coroner that they did not wish him to read the evidence,
but they begged to be allowed to retire to consider their verdict.
The Jury were then conducted to a separate room, where they remained
for about half an hour, and, on their return, the Coroner inquired whether
they were agreed?
The Foreman said, "Yes, unanimously. We return a verdict of
WILFUL MURVER AGAINST William CORDER."
The Coroner immediately issued his warrant, directed to Mr. Orridge,
the Governor of Bury gaol, to receive the prisoner into his custody, and
him safely to keep, until he be brought to trial at the Assize and Gaol
Delivery for the County of Suffolk, then next ensuing.
Soon after the conclusion of the Inquest, the prisoner was conveyed
to Bury gaol in a postchaise. On bis
On bis way thither, he frequently con-
versed with Lea, the officer, who accompanied him. Among other things,
he said, he could not help thinking that there was some truth in dreams,
and that he believed there was some reliance to be placed in the prog-
nostics of fortune-tellers; for about twelve years since his fate had been
foretold by an old woman, who declared that he had a great number of
misfortunes and troubles to undergo, and that every undertaking in
which he might engage would be unsuccessful
. He added, "AM her pro-
phecies regarding me have come to pass. for everything has been unsuc-
cessful."
He then made repeated allusions to the depositions which had been
read to him by the Coroner, and remarked that they contained several

untruths, and expressed regret that he had not continued in the room
and heard them all read.
During the period of his confinement in Bury gaol, even up to the
time of his . trial, his conduct was uniformly decorous. He manifested
great self-possession, and was to all appearance unmoved, either by the
allusions of scriptural discourse, or the near approach of the awful deci-
sion of his fate.' Occasionally there was an appearance of agitation, but
he quickly recovered his usual serenity, approaching almost to thorough
indifference. His wife, who was far advanced in pregnancy, visited him
daily. Her unmerited affliction excited universal sympathy. The
prisoner was also visited by his mother and sister, we believe, more than
onco.

THE TRIAL
First Day, Thursday, August 7, 1828.
It is impossible to describe the state of confusion which prevailed from
an early hour in the vicinity of the Court. Chief Baron ALEXANDER
(who presided) had given peremptory orders that no person should be
admitted until he had taken his seat on the Bench : the consequence of
which was, that the crowd, composed of a mixed group of barristers,
magistrates, jurors, constables, and yeomen, continued to accumulate, so
as absolutely to obstruct the entrance of the Judge when he drove up, and
created nearly one hour and a half of tumult and confusion, before the
Court was in a condition to obtain that degree of order which befitted the
proceedings.
At twenty minutes before ten o'clock the prisoner was put to the bar.
He appeared to be about thirty years of age, of middle height, of a fair
and healthy complexion, large mouth, turn-up nose, large eyes, which
had a fixed and glazed aspect
, and his features bore rather a smile than
any other expression. He was dressed in a dark-coloured frock-coat
with velvet collar, black waistcoat, and blue trowsers.
The Clerk of the Peace read the Indictment, which charged Willian
Corder with having, on the 18th of May, 1827, murdered Maria Marten,
by feloniously and wilfully shooting her with
a pistol through the body,
and likewise stabbing her with a dagger. The Indictment consisted of
ten counts. The following is an abstract :-

The prisoner listened with the greatest attention to the reading of the
Indictment, occasionally inclining his body forward, and turning his ear
towards the Court; and as the Jury were sworn, he took a small eye-glass
from his waistcoat-pocket, and looked steadily at several of the gentlemen
He was also indicted upon the verdict of the Coroner's Inquest. When
required, in the usual form, to plead, he replied, in a firm voice, to each
Indictment, " Not Guilty, my Lord."

THE RED BARN,
645
A plan of the barn was put on the table of the Court, and at a gnariei
past ten o clock Mr. Andrews stated the case to the Jury. After several
preliminary observations on the importance of the case, in which the
learned Counsel said he should carefully abstain from any remark which
might tend to raise unnecessary prejudice against the prisoner, he pro-
ceeded to observe, that he felt it to be his duty to lay the facts of it briefly
before the Jury, in order that they might obtain a general view of it, and
so be able, as the different circumstances were deposed to, to judge what
was the importance and the bearing of each. The prisoner at the bar was
the son of respectable parents, living at Polstead, in that county. His
father had been dead for some time. Whilst living, he was a farmer, aad
held a farm of very considerable extent in the parish of Polstead. From
the time of his father's death to the period of the transaction into which
they were then assembled to inquire, his mother, first with the assistace
of his elder brother, and afterwards with the assistance of the prisoner
himself, was also a farmer. Maria Marten, the young woman, with
whose death the prisoner at the bar stood charged, was the daughter of
parents in a humbler sphere of life, residing in the same parish. The pri-
soner at the bar and Maria Marten had, from living together in the same
parish, been personally known to each other for some time, but were not
intimately acquainted until a year before the 18th of May, 1827. At that
period an intimacy of a very close nature took place between them, and an
ilegitimate child was the fruit of it. She was not delivered of this child
ai lier father's house ; but she returned to it about six weeks before the
18th of May, with an infant child, of which the prisoner owned himself to
be the father. The child was always a weakly child, and died, as he be-
lieved, within a fortnight after the return of Maria Marten to her family.
During this period of their acquaintance, Corder, on more occasions than
one, was heard to say to her, that the parish thought of having her taken
up for another bastard child of which she had been delivered; and, after
her delivery of a child to him, he was heard to make to her the same de-
claration. They were likewise heard quarrelling more than once, and
especially regarding a 5l. note, which was mentioned between them. On
one occasion Maria Marten said to the prisoner at the bar, "If I go
to
shall
go too." It was right that he should also state to the Jury,
that during this period of their acquaintance, Corder said, repeatedly, that
it was his intention to make her his wife. On the Sunday before the 18th
of May, which fell upon a Friday, Maria Marten (Corder having first
veen to her father's cottage), went to his mother's house. It was there
agreed that they should go the next day to Ipswich to get married. They
did not, however, go as they had agreed. They then arranged that they
should go on the next Thursday; but that arrangement was not carried
into effect. On Friday, the 18th of May, about the middle of the day,
Corder went to the house of Maria Marten's father. At that time she was
up stairs with her mother. He desired her to make berself ready and go
along with him. She said that she could not go then. He replied, "You
have been disappointed several times, and you must go now." Other
conversation, as he was informed, also passed between them on that oc-
casion. It was agreed that she should put her clothes into a bag, and
that Corder should take them to a place called the Red Barn, which was
on a farm belonging to his mother. It was further agreed, that, to escape
observation, she should put on, at her father's house, a male dress; that
she should change it at the Barn for a female dress; and that she should

go from thence to Ipswich to be matred. He should pri ve to them, il be
was rightly instructed, that she put into a large bag several articles of
female dress, which it was not necessary for him to enumerate. She also
put into it a small basket, ard into that small basket she put a smaller
black velvet bag, commonly called a reticule. He would prove to them,
that after this arrangement Corder was absent from the house of Maria
Marten's mother about a quarter of an hour. When he returned, Maria
Marten had put on her male attire, which consisted of a coat, waistcoat
,
and a pair of breeches. She had on, also, part of her own female dress,
namely, a flannel petticoat and a pair of stays, into which she put a jean
busk. She had, also, a comb in her hair, two earrings in her ears, and
two smaller combs in her hair. The prisoner and Maria Marten left the
house at the same time, going out, however, at different doors, but both
taking the direction of the Red Barn. He ought, also, to state, that
she had a green handkerchief tied about her neck. From that period,
none of her friends have seen anything of her, nor have had any accounts
respecting her, save those which had been given by the prisoner at the bar,
and which would shortly be placed in evidence before them. He ought to
have stated, that before they went away, and whilst they were talking of the
manner in which she was dressed, Corder said to her that Baalham, the consta-
ble, had shown him a letter by which he was authorized to take her up for hav-
ing had a bastard child. That constable would be called before them, and he
would tell them that he never had any such letter as the prisoner represented,
and that he had never made any such communication as the prisoner alleged.
It so happened, that on the day on which they left old Marten's cottage to
go to the Red Barn, a younger brother to the deceased Maria Marten,
who was working near the Red Barn, saw the prisoner pass at a short
distance from him to his (Corder's) mother's house with a pickaxe upon
his shoulder. He must now inform them, that the next time the mo-
ther-or he should rather say the mother-in-law-of Maria Marten saw
the prisoner, was at his mother's house. Nothing material passed between
them on that occasion. On the Sunday following, he came to her house
and said that he had not yet married her daughter, though he had taken
her away for that purpose, for it was necessary that the licence should go
up to London. He added, however, that he had left her daughter at
Yarmouth, under the protection of one of his female relations. On a sub-
sequent day in the same week she had another interview with the prisoner,
and she then told him that her son had seen him on the Friday previously
near the Red Barn with a pickaxe on his shoulder. He replied, "I.
could not be me that he saw; it must have been Acres, who was em-
ployed that day in stubbing trees near the barn." Acres would be called
before them, and would tell them that he was not so employed at that
time, nor at any time thereabouts. From this period to the discovery of
the transaction, Corder saw the father and the mother of Maria Marten
very frequently. Corder was absent from Polstead for some time; and on
his return he gave accounts of Maria Marten's living with some friends of
his at Yarmouth of the name of Roland. When they inquired about her
health, he said that she was very well: and when asked why she did not
write, he said, sometimes that she was too busy, and at other times that
she had a sore on the back of her hand, which gathered, and disabled her
from moving her fingers, and consequently from writing. In the interval
between the 18th of May and harvest time, Corder had several conversa-
tions with other individuals respecting Maria Marten; and to these

647
persons he gave a different account of her from that which he had given
to her father and mother. He told one person that she had gone by the
steam-packet to Franee, and another person that she was living at no
great distance from them. He had a very particular conversation on the
subject with a woman of the name of Stowe, to the particulars of which
she would be called to speak. He told her, that Maria Marten did not
live at any great distance from them. In the course of conversation, she
asked whether Maria Marten was likely to have any more children.
He
said, " No, she is not. Maria Marten will have no more children.'
Mrs. Stowe immediately said, " Why not? she is still a very young
woman." He replied, " No; believe me, she will have no more; she
'as had her number." Mrs. Stowe then asked him, " Is she far from
ence ?" He answered, " No, she is not far from us : I can go to her
whenever I like, and I know that when I am not with her, nobody else
is." There was a trifling circumstance which was, perhaps, connected
with the transaction of the 18th of May, and which he would briefly state
to them. From this woman of the name of Stowe, the prisoner, about
that time, borrowed a spade. She could not tell the precise period at
which he borrowed it; but there were circumstances which led her to
believe that it was about the middle of May. She had been shortly
before delivered of a child; and it was in the interval between her getting
out of bed and being churched, that he borrowed the spade. They would
hear her examined, and would draw their own inferences from her testi-
mony. The learned Counsel said that he had now come, in the course of
his detail
, to that part of the transaction which happened in September
last. Corder was then engaged in directing the workmen to get in the
harvest. For some time before the 18th of May the barn had been empty,
except so far as the floor was covered with the old litter. When the wheat
was cut, Corder gave directions that the corn should be laid in the upper
bay of the barn. He was present when the first and second loads were
taken in, and superintended the operation. The keys of the barn were
always kept in his mother's house, and the barn was, besides, not easy of
entrance, as it was surrounded by a sort of outhouses, and was only
approached by a gate that was seven feet high.
After the corn had been got into the Barn, Corder left Polstead. He
was driven, on that occasion, to Colchester, by a man of the name of
BrightTo that person he gave a different account of Maria Marten
from that which he had given to any other person, for he said that he had
not seen her since the May preceding. Before he left Polstead, on that
occasion, he saw her father, and he told him that he (Corder) should have
the pleasure of seeing his daughter soon. He likewise told him that he
had bought a new suit of clothes, in which he intended to be married to
her. About the 19th or the 20th of October, old Marten received a letter
from the prisoner, bearing the London post-mark. In that letter the
prisoner said that he had made Maria his wife. He likewise expressed
his surprise that the old man had not answered the letter which Maria had
sent him upon her marriage, informing him, that when they were married,
Mr. Roland had acted as a father, and Miss Roland as bride's-maid. He
desired that the old man would answer his letter immediately, and told
him to address his reply to him, under certain initials, at some place ir
the city. The father answered the letter, and told him that no such
.etter as he described had ever been received. Corder then wrote backa
that he had made inquiry at the Post-office respecting the loss of it, that

no traces of any such letter could be found in the books of the Post-office
at London, and that he attributed the loss of to its having had to cross
the sea, Maria having been in the Isle of Wight at the time when it was
written. In November last, the prisoner met a gentleman of the name
of Matthews, in London, with whom he had a correspondence, which he in-
tended to place before them. Corder then said to that gentleman, that he
had not married Maria Marten, because his family affairs were not quite
settled; but he added, that he was then living with her in the Isle of
Wight. Some time further elapsed without the parents of Maria Marten
hearing from her; and, in consequence, they became anxious and suspi-
cious about her fate. Their suspicions increased every day, and at last
assumed a definite shape. They were directed at last to the Red Barn.
The father of Maria Marten became anxious to examine it. Accord.
ingly, in the April of the present year, he went to the Barn, and searched
it. The corn was then thrashed out, but the old litter still remained in it.
They searched two or three places in it, and, at length, in the upper bay,
they found a place where the ground did not appear so firm and con-
sistent as it was in other parts of the Barn. In consequence, the ground
was opened, and within a foot and a half of the surface they found the
body of a female. The body had on parts of a female dress: there were
the remains of a jean pair of stays, of a shift, and of a flannel petti-
coat. Under the body was a handkerchief, and on the neck and around
it was a green silk handkerchief. The body and clothes were inspected
attentively by the father, the mother, and the sister of Maria Marten.
They would describe to the Jury the different marks which Maria had on
her person. They would also tell them the natural marks that were found
upon the body in the Barn. Maria Marten bad a large excrescence, or
wen, about the middle of her neck;so, too, had the female whose body
was discovered in the Barn. Maria Marten had lost two of her front
teeth ;so had the female whose body was found in the Barn. The fea.
tures of the body were not altogether decomposed, and the Jury would
hear what the witnesses had to say on that point. They would describe
to the Jury the different parts of Maria Marten's dress, and particularly
with respect to her stays and to her neck-handkerchief. Maria Marten
had, when living, a pain in her side, and was labouring under asphixia.
The surgeons who had examined the body discovered in the Barn, would
tell them that they found considerable signs of inflammation in one of
the sides of that body. He ought here to inform the Jury, that the
body discovered in the Barn remained in the ground until the surgeon
had inspected it. The surgeon who inspected it would tell them that
he found a pistol-ball in the face,-a wound in the neck, and given
by a sharp instrument,--a wound in the face, given by a similar in-
strument,--and a third wound of the same kind, between the fifth and
sixth ribs, which had penetrated the heart. The first surgeon who ex,
amined the body, took the green silk handkerchief off the neck, and
would inform them, that it must have pressed so tight upon the neck as
to have produced death by strangulation.
In consequence of this discovery, suspicion immediately attached to the
prisoner at the bar. Information of the murder was sent immediately to
London. An intelligent police officer was employed to apprehend the
prisoner; and, in consequence of his exertions, the prisoner was appre-
hended at a house in Ealing. The officer, on first seeing the prisoner,
te!d him that he had come to apprehend him uron a very serious charome

649
The prisoner
--jodeed, for nothing less than the murder of Maria Marten. He aske
the prisoner if he knew such a woman. The prisoner said that he did
pota The officer then asked him this question" Did you never know
Maria Marten?" The prisoner replied, " No, never.
then said, " You must be mistaken in the person you are come to appre-
hend." The officer said, " No, I am not mistaken as to the person ;
your name is Corder, I believe ?" The prisoner said it was. The officer
then said again to him, " Did you never know Maria Marten ?" and the
prisoner again said, " Never." The officer then said, "I have asked
you the question twice, and I shall only ask you a third time; " Did you
never know Maria Marten ?" and a third time the reply was, " Never."
The officer then apprehended him. At the time of apprehending the
prisoner, the officer searched the house in which he was living, and in one
of the rooms he found a small black velvet bag; there was something
peculiar in the bag, for it was lined with old silk, and had a broad
selvage round the rim. That bag Mrs. Marten, as he was instructed,
would identify as the bag of Maria Marten. In that bag were found a
brace of pistols. After the officer had returned to Polstead, and had
seen the shape of the wounds inflicted by the sharp instrument, he recol-
lected that he had seen in the house a sword belonging to the prisoner.
He went to Ealing and procured it; that sword would be produced that
day for their exanunation. It had been compared with the size of the
wound in the stays, and in the body discovered in the Barn, and they
would hear what the witnesses said upon that point. He would prove
that some days before the 18th of May, the prisoner had gone to a cutler,
and had given him orders to make the sword sharp. His instructions
were obeyed. The sword was ground; the prisoner took it away; and
he would prove that it was seen in nis possession before he left Polstead.
These were the main facts of the case which he had to submit to their
consideration. The observations upon them would come more properly
from the learned Judge who had to try the cause, than from himself; ani
he should therefore abstain froni entering into any analysis of them.
There was, however, one observation which he thought he might make,--
nay, which he felt himself bound in justice to the prisoner to make to
them. A case like the present always excited much curiosity, and
gave rise to many reports. Now, such reports had no connexion what.
ever with the solemn investigation on which they were then impannelled
to decide. He was therefore sure, that if they had heard such reports,
they would discharge them from their minds, and would come to a decision
on this subject upon the evidence alone. Their duty to the public, to the
prisoner, and to themselves, required, that in the solemn verdict which
they would soon be called upon to give, they should be guided solely by
the legitimate influence of the evidence tendered to their consideration.
The facts which he was instructed to offer in evidence, sifted as they would
be by an acute cross-examination, and commented on as they would be
by the learned Judge, would, he trusted in God, lead them to a right
decision. If, in the exercise of their judgment, they should be of opinion
either that the prisoner was innocent of the charge laid against him in the
indictment, or that he was not clearly and distinctly proved to be guilty of
it, they would do their duty by acquitting him; but if they should be of
opinion that the prisoner was the person who murdered Maria Marten,
they could discharge their duty to God and to their country in no other

way than by returning a verdict of Guilty, without any regard to the
consequences which might flow from it.
The first witness called was Ann Marten, the wie of Thomas Marten, wbo
doposed, that sbe lived at Polstead, and her husband's daughter was Maria Marten.
She had known the prisoner (who lived in their neighbourbood) for 17 years. He
was acquainted with Maria intimately, and used to come frequently to their cottage
for more than a twelvemonth before the 15th of May, last year. Maria became
pregnant in the course of that intercourse, at Sudbury. It was about seven reeks
before May, 1827, that sbe returned to her fainer's house, accompanied by an infant
child, who died about a fortnigbt afterwards. Corder still continued to come to the
house, and admitted that he was toe father of this infant. He used to converse
often with Maria, and when the chili was buriei, be suid he bad carried it to Sud-
bury for that purpose. She remembered bis niore than once talking about a five
pound note, and Maria used to say he had taken away ber bread and her child's.
Maria had had a child previously, wbich was kept by the witness. Mr. Corder told
Maria that the parish officers were going to take her up for having bastard children.
Recollected the Sunday before Friday, the 18th of May. On that evening (Sunday)
prisoner came to the cottage, where be stopped half an hour or three-quarters, and
then went out with Maria ; they both saying they were going to Ipswich early on
the Monday morning, after sleeping at bis mother's house. She returned between
three and four o'clock the same morning, and Corder came again on tbat day, and
said that they should go to Ipswicb on the Wednesday night. They did nut, how.
ever, go at that time, in consequence of Stoke fair, but fixed Thursday night for the
journey, when again there was a disappointment, as he said his brother James was
hourly expected to die. On the Friday (the day laid in the indictment), about 11
or 12 o'clock, Corder came, and went up stairs to witness and Maria. To the
latter he said, "I am come, Maria-make haste--I am going." Sbe replied,
"How can I go at this time of the day, without any body seeing me?" He said,
"Never mind, we bave been disappointed a good many times, and we will be dis-
appointed no more.". After they had this conversation, she asked bim, " How am
I to go?" He replied, "You can go to the Red Barn, and wait till I go to you
there in the course of the evening." Maria said, " How am I to order my things?"
He replied, he would take the things, carry them up to the Barn, and come back to
walk with her; adding, that none of his workmen were in the fields or at the Barn,
and he was sure tbe course was quite clear. Maria's things, consisting of a reticule.
wicker basket, a velvet one, two pair of black silk stockings, a silk gown of the
same colour, a cambric skirt, and other articles of dress, were put into a brown
bolland bag, wbich Corder carried away in bis hand. Sbe (Maria) then dressed
berself in a brown coat, striped waistcoat, and blue trousers, wearing underneath,
her female petticoat, white stays, green and red bandkerchief, a silk one, and an
Irish linen chemise, which the deceased bad herself made.
Witness bad laced on the stays or Maria on that morning, and knew the marks
upon it (wbich sbe described) as well as those on the shoes wbich she wore. He
assigned as the reason for going on that day 10 Ipswich, that Jobo Baalham, the con-
stable, came to him on that morning to the stable, saying he had got a letter from
Mr. Whitmore, of London, which enclosed a warrant to take Maria and prosecute
her, for her bastard children. Witness said, "Ob, William! if you bad but married
Maria befcre this child was born, as I wished, all this would have been settled."
"Well," said he, "I am going to Ipswich to marry ber to-morrow morning." Wit-
ness said, "William, what will you do if that can't be done?" He replied, "Don't
make yourself uneasy, she shall be my lawlul wife before I return, or I will get ber a
place till she can." Maria then went away about half-past twelve o'clock, Corder
first desiring witness to look out to the garden, lest somebody should see tbem going
off. They departed at different doors, Maria in man's dress, and with a hat of pri.
soner's. She wore a large comb in her bair, and a smaller one, having also earrings.
They proceeded together in the direction of the Red Barn, and she saw neither of
them again on that day, nor indeed ever saw Maria since. William Corder, when
he went away, carried a gun in bis band, which he said was charged. Maria had,
besides, a green cotton umbrella, with a bone crook handle and a button. On the
following Sunday morning, at nine o'clock, witness next spoke to the prisoner at ber
own house. She said, "William, what have you done with Maria ?': He answer-
ed, "I have left ber at Ipswich, wbere I have got her a comfortable place, to go
down with Miss Roland to the waterside." On asking him how she was to do for
clothes, he said Miss Roland had plenty for her, and would not let bim provide any

for Marla. He also said he had got a licence, but it must go to London to be signod,
and he could not be married under a month or six weeks. He furtber mentioned,
that be bad changed a check for 201., and given ber the money. On asking hima
wbere she dressed, he said sbe had put her things on in the Barn, and tbat be after.
wards put the male attire into the seat of the couch in which tbey travelled. Witness
had a son named George, and she told Corder that George bad mentioned be (pri-
soner) had not left the Barn as soon as he promised. This be denied, saying he had
left it witbin three quarters of an hour after be parted from her bouse. No,"
" said
witness, you did not, for George saw you later going down the adjoining field with
a pickaxe." "No, no," replied be, " that was not me, but Tom Acres, who bad
been planting trees on the bill." She was in the habit of seeing Corder repeatedly
up to the month of September, sometimes two or three times in the day, and he
iovariably said Maria was well, and living comfortably at Yarmouth with Miss Ro-
land. He used to leave Polstead some times for a day or two, when he was in the
habit of saying be had been with Maria, who continued very well, and that at Mi-
chaelmas be meant to take ber home to his mother's farm. No letter had ever
come from Maria, and when she often spoke to Corder about her not writing, be re.
plied, sbe could not, because sbe had got a bad band.
When he left Polstead he came to take leave, saying he was going to the water-
side for his bealth, and would call at Yarmouth to take Maria wiib him, and be
married immediately. She never saw him after till his arrest, nor had she seen the
dead body; but all the articles of dress were shown to her (which the witness subse.
quently identified as being those worn by the deceased on the day sbe bad last seen
ber). Maria bad always a cough, had a wen on her neck, and had lost a tooth from
ibe upper as well as from tbe lower jaw. Witness attended Corder's brotber's
funeral soon after the 18th of May, where she saw the prisoner with Maria's um-
brella. After the funeral sbe talked to bim about the umbrella, wbicb be denied to
bave been bers, though he said it was like it, but Deborah Franks's, and he was
going to send it back to her. He on one occasion said, that Maria bad lent him bers
at Ipswich, where she had come over with Miss Roland, to save bim from being
dripping wet. He had shown the witness a gold ring, wbich was, he said, to be for
Maria's wedding, and also a brace of pistols which be once brougbt to the house.
Cross-examined by Mr. Brudrick.-Witness was the motber of tbree children.
Maria was her step.daughter, and had an own brother and sister. She was anxious
for Maria's marriage to Corder, although Maria said notbing about it. She was gono
two months at ber last lying-in, and then returned in Corder's gig with the prisoner.
The infant died in her arms, and Corder and Maria took it away to be buried; where
she did not know, but was told it was at Sudbury. Maria used to dress a little fine, and
her sister, as well as witness and her father, olten quarrelled with her about it, which
made ber mostly very dull. There was no secret about their going to the Barn.
Corder used openly to snap the pistol close to the fire. She has seen bim bring
bam or Maria. He used to give her money as the weekly allowance for the child;
and Maria had a quarterly stipend of 51. from Mr. Matthews, by whom she had a
child, and anotber by a third party. She bad never heard from any body but the
prisoner, tuat Maria was exposed to danger by the constables, for having had these
children; and this fear kept ber in doors. When she went away on the 18th, sbe
was crying and low spirited. Corder often came to the bouse with a gun. Sbe bad
been examined before the Coroner. Prisoner called repeatedly to see Maria, and
said that as long as be bad a shilling, she sbould have it. They seemed always to bo
very fond of each other. She repeated the manner in which Corder and Maria left
the house together for the last time, as it has already been given in ber examination
in chief.
During the examination of this witness, the prisoner put on his spec-
tacles, took out a red morocco pocket book, in which he commenced
writing, and looked stedfastly at her. She appeared a decently-dressed
country woman, but never returned the prisoner's glance, or took her
eyes from the direction of the Counsel who examined her. About two
o'clock he ate and drank with mrich seeming appetite.
Thomas Marten, the father of the deceasea, deposed, thut be lived at Polstead, and
was a mole-catcber. Maria was, in May, 1827, about 20 years of age. The last day
be saw ber was on the 17th of May. He went out too early on the morning of the
18th to see her. He knew Corder to have been acquainted with her for a year and
half before tbat time. It was on the 1911 of May he found out his daughter's
having gone away with him; and on the following Sunday he said he wid takon

Maria to Ipswich, but was obliged to go to London about the marriage licence.
This witness then corroborated the evidence of the preceding witness, respecting
Corder's declarations of the name and kind of place he had provided for bis daughter,
and bis subsequent statements that he was in the habit of hearing from her, and she
was quite well, except tbe sore band; and also bis assurance, on taking leave,
that he was going to meet Maria and marry her at the water-side. The witness pro-
ceeded to state, be had afterwards received two letters, which be gave to a gentleman
who bad examined him, and bad since searched the Red Barn at Polstead. It was
on the 1916 of last April.
Here the witness referred to the model of the Barn in Court, and
pointed out and explained all its local bearings.
On lifting up the straw from the Barn-floor, he saw some great stones lying in
the middle of the buy, and an appearance of the earth having been disturbed. On
that spot be poked down the handle of the rake, and turned something up which
was black. On getting further assistance, they discoverd, a little under the ground,
a small round sharp iron, about a foot long, like a hay-spike, and then they came to
the body, and near the head found the handkercbief tied round ber neck, apparently
very tight. The body was lying down, thougb not stretched out. The legs were
drawn up, and the head bent down into the earth. He quitted tbe Barn for balf an
hour, and returned, with another person, to make a further examination. They le;
the body alone until the Coroner and the surgeon came, when they cleared the earth
entirely from the body, and raised it up from the floor. On exumining it in the
ligbt, the mouth looked like Maria's, wbo had a wen on her neck, and been ailing a
year or two with a cough. Underneath the body was found a sbaw) ; the.e were,
besides, earrings, part of a pair of stays, of a chemise, and two combs in the hair.
Cross-examined.-A man named Pryke accompanied witness in this examination
of the Barn, and discovery of the body. They put the rake several times into the
ground before they found it. The body was not removed until the Coroner came.
After the Inquest, the Attorney for the prosecution examined the witnesses upon
oath, in a public-bouse called the Cock. The prisoner, the jury, or a magistrate,
were absent at this time.
Ann Marten (sister of the deceased) deposed, that she was at home on the 18th of
May, when Maria went away with William Corder, the circumstances of which she
described in nearly the same words as ber mother had previously done, particularizing
each article of her dress. Since that time she had frequently seen the prisoner, who
always said Maria was living with Miss Roland, the sister of an old school-fellow of
his, and tbat be was preparing to marry her. Witness bad seen the dead body, when
the Coroner and jury were present. She saw it laid upon a door, and was positive it
was her sister Maria's. She knew it by the things that were on it, also by her teeth,
her mouth, and her features generally.
The witness here particularly identified the clothes as belonging to her
deceased sister, as well as the earrings which were in the ears, and the
combs, &c.
Cross-examined.--Her sister left home on the 18th of May in very low spirits, but
she never heard ber say she was anxious to be married to Wm. Corder. Witness
and Maria sometimes quarrelled, and there used to be words between ber and her
step-mother.
George Marten (brother of the preceding witness), a boy about eleven or twelve
years of age, deposed, after a few interrogatories to ascertain bis competency to take
an oath, wbich he answered satisfactorily, that he saw bis sister on the day she last
left the house, with Cerder, wbo carried a gun in his band, which be said was loaded,
and therefore cautioned witness not to meddle with it. He never saw his sister
after that day, but be saw Corder on the same day, between three and four o'clock,
come from the Barn alone, with a pickaxe, and proceed homewards througb th
felds, He was positive as to his person.
He was not cross-examined.
Phbe Stowe deposed, that she lived at Polstead, and knew Wm. Corder, Her
house was about tbirty rods from the Red Barn, to wbich it was the nearest cottage.
Sbe remembered Curder calling about one o'clock one day in May last year, when he
said, Mrs. Stowe, has not your busband got an old spade to lend me ?s' Sbe lent
him one, and be only said a few words, saying he was in such a hurry, he could not
then shop and talk to her. The spade was afterwards returned; but she could not
say by whom. On a subsequent occasion Corder again called, when she asked him
where was Maria Marten's child. Ho suid it was dead and buried. He also sald

653
sbo would have no more children. Witness said, " Why not? she is a young womar
yet." He replied, " Never mind, Maria Marten will never bave any more children."
What do you go by?" added witness. "Ob," said be," she has had several, but
I'll be d-dif she shall bave any more." Witness continued, " If you are mar-
ried, why don't you live with her ?" "Oh, no," was his reply, " for I can go to
her any day in the year, just when I like." "Perbaps you are rather jealous," said
I," and wben you are not with ber, you think somebody else is." "Oh, no;" said
be," wben I am not with her, I am sure nobody else is."
Cross-examined.-Mr. Corder managed the farm for his mother, and her husband
worked for bim. She knew nothing of who brougbt the spade back, nor did she tell
her husband of ber having lent one. When she was first examined before the
Coroner's jury she did not tell all this. She was also sworn, and gave evidence be-
ore the attorney for the prosecution.
Rachael Buck deposed, tbat she knew Wm. Corder, whom she saw about last
August, when he came to her farm, and said Maria Marten would not be her
mistress, as she had gone to France by the steam packet.
William Marten (first cousin of the deceased) deposed, that he knew Wm. Corder,
with whom be had conversed about Maria Marten, in the barvest of last year. On
asking him where she was, and if at Sudbury, be replied, "No; but I can see ber
every day I please." He then gave witness a pint of harvest beer, and desired bim
not to speak about Maria, lest the people within sbould hear what was said.
Francis Stouc deposed, that he was last year working at barvest under Wm. Corder,
who acted for his mother. Knew the Red Barn, u bere the first corn of that year
was put. Witness assisted in placing it there: the first part was put immediately,
over where the body was found. He remembered Corder's coming to him in the
fields, saying, " I will give you a pound note to cut my throat." He was smiling
at the time, and witness took it to be a joke.
William Downes deposed, that he had been for many years a labourer on Mrs.
Corder's farm, which was managed by the prisoner, wbom be assisted in filling the
Red Barn last harvest in the right-band bay, by William Corder's orders.
Cross-examined.--Knew the prisoner for seventeen or eighteen years; he was a
very good-natured young man to witness, and he never saw bim out of temper.
Within two years, a great number of his family bad been cut oil by death.
William Pryke deposed, that he drove the prisoner, on the 8ih of Sepiember, to
Colchester, and talked with bim about the business of the farm. Maria Marten's
name was mentioned, and he said he had not seen ber since May, but spoke very
bigbly of ber. Wben Marten searched the Barn, witness assisted bim ; he bad is
rake in bis band, and co-operuted to clear away the earth, where they found the body
doubled up and lying on the right side.
Cross-examined.- Prisoner was ill when he drove him over to Colchester; ho
spoke bigbly 10 bim of the poor girl, Maria Marten. He had the care of the Barn
after the body was found, but he never was examined before the Coroner.
Mr. Brodrick.It is very extraordinary that a witness so important
as this should not have been examined before the Coroner, who, by the
way, it ought to be mentioned, refused to allow the attendance of the
prisoner during the Inquest, so that the man is put to the bar for the first
time to hear the evidence against him.
The Lord Chief Baron.-Is it not very unusual for the prisoner not to
be admitted on such occasions ?
Mr. Brodrick.Very unusual, indeed, my Lord; and it is likewise very
unusual for a Coroner who sat on such a cause, afterwards, as an attorney,
to conduct the prosecution against the same prisoner. Most unusual,
too, it is, that the Coroner, while acting as such attorney, should himself,
in a private room, without the prisoner's having any notice of it, ex-
amine the witnesses on oath, and collect their evidence, no magistrate
being present.
Tho witness's cross-examination was resumed, whon he said, that the attorney for
tbe prosecution had exun ined bim on oath at the Cock. Witness furtber said, tbat
William Corder was always n kind-hearted young man,
Mr. Brodrick.- Pray bad you not got a person preaching about this murder in the

The Lord Chief Baron.What! what d'ye mean by preaching? lo
A a sermon ?
Mr. Brodrick.Yes, my Lord; and to a congregation of several
thousand persons, specially brought together, after regular notice in the
parish, to hear this man described as the murderer of this unfortunate
girl.
The Lord Chief Baron.--You don't mean a clergyman of the Church
of England ?
Mr. Brodrick.No, my Lord; I understand he was a Dissenter.
Witness, on being asked the name of this preacher, said that he believed it was

Mr. Brodrick. This was not all, my Lord; for in the very neigh-
bourhood, and indeed in all parts of the county, there have been puppet.
shows representing the same catastrophe.
Mr. Andrews rose to explain the conduct of the Coroner.
Mr. Brodrick objected to his learned friend being heard, unless he pro-
duced the Coroner as a witness. To that he could have no objection.
The Lord Chief Baron.But I have; for the matter has nothing to do
with this trial, and we've enough to do without it. It's an imputation upon
the Coroner; perhaps, but we are not now trying his character.
Mr. Andrews then explained, that it had been arranged by the Coroner,
when Mr. Humphries first attended as the prisoner's solicitor, that though
Corder was not to be present at the Inquest, the depositions were after-
wards to be read over to him, which was done. He believed that the
practice was, that the prisoner should be absent upon such occasions.
Mr. Prendergast said, that the practice was directly the contrary, and
so were the words of Lord Coke.
Mr. Wm. Chaplin was next examined. He produced two letters, wbich he re-
ceived from Thomas Marten.
Whilst Marten was sent for to prove that those letters were the same
which he received by post,
Mr. Brodrick asked him whether he was not the churcbwarden of Polstead, and
the prosecutor in this cause ?
Witness replied, I am.'
Mr. Brodrick.Did you hear the parson preach in the Barn ?
Witness.-No, certainly not; but I heard of the occurrence.
Mr. Brodrick.-And you never interfered to prevent it?
Witness.- I did not.
Mr. Brodrick.- Are there not exbibitions going round the neighbourhood, repre-
senting Corder as the murderer?
Witness, I have beard so.
Mr. Brodrick.- And you've not interfered to prevent them? Is there not a
camera obscura near this very Hall at this moment, exbibiting him as the murderer?
Witness.There is a camera obscura, I believe, about the streets, but I don't
know its natare,
The letters, after being identified by Marten as Corder's hand-writing,
and as those which he received, were then read.

THE RED BARN.
Peter Matthews, Esq.-I generally reside in London. I have relations in the
nolghbourhood of Polstead. I know the prisoner, and I know Maria Masten, i bad
known Maria for some length of time before last year. I had last seen her, I
believe, on the 31st of August, 1826. In July last year, I was at Polstead. I saw
Corder there twice, and once again on the morning of my leaving Polstead. I bad
a conversation with him respecting a note 1 had lost. It was a bl. Bank of Eng.
land note. I put a variety of questions first of all respecting a note and a letter
He said he knew nothing of them. I told him it was a letter of the 3d of January,
1827, in which I told him a 5l. note was enclosed. I have a letter I received from
the prisoner in August. [Letter produced.] I believe tbis to be his hand-writing.
Wm. Gardner recalled.-(Letter shown to him.)-I believe this to be the prisoner's
hand-writing. (Letter read.]
" August 1, 1827.
"Sir, -After a long, restless, and wretched night of miserable reflections, I have
at last endeavoured to collect my weary spirits, in order to fulfil your request--"
When the letter had been read thus far, Mr. Brodrick interposed, and
submitted that it did not relate to the subject-matter of this inquiry; to
which the Chief Baron assented, and the letter was put by.
Mr. Matthews recalled. I received this letter from the prisoner. [Letter read.]
" Sunday Afternoon, August 26, 1827.
"Sir,- In reply to your generous letter, which reached me yesterday, I beg to
inform you that I was indeed innocent of Maria Marten's residence, at the time you
requested me to forward the letter I took from Bramford, and will candidly confess
that Maria bas been with a distant female relation of mine since the month of May.
About five weeks ago, they both went into Norfolk to visit some of my friends. On
Friday week I received a letter from my kindred, who informed me that Maria was
somewhat indisposed, and that they were then in a village called Herlingby, near
Yarmouth. I returned an answer by the next post, and enclosed your letter for Maria,
which I found reached her perfectly safe, as I took the Yarmouth coach last Wed-
nesday, from Ipswich Lamb-fair, and went to Herlingby, when I was sorry to bear
that Maria's indisposition was occasioned by a sore gathering on the back of her
band, wbich caused ber great pain, and wbicb prevented her from writing to you, as
her fingers are at present immoveable. Knowing you would be anxious to hear from
her, 1 particularly wisbed her to write the moment she found herself able, wbieb she
promised very faithfully to do. I gave her a particular account of our dialogue al
Polstead Hall, not forgetting the remarkaole kindness I experienced from you, which
I shall ever most gratefully acknowledge; and likewise return you my most grateful
thanks for your kindness, in respect to your enterprise on my account, wben in Lon.
don. I remain, Sir, your most obedient, and very humble Servant,
W. CORDER.
P. S, I have already enclosed your .etter for Maria, in one of my own, which I
sball post with this immediately, and beg permission to add, that I have fully deter-
mined to make Maria my bride directly I can settle our family affairs, wbich will be
in about a month or six weeks' time. Till that time, Maria wishes to continue with
my kindred. In concluding, if I can at any time render you any service whatsoever,
I shall be most happy to oblige, as I am truly sensible of your generosity.
" For Peter Matthews, Bipfield, near Wokingham, Berkshire."
Mr. Matthews' examination continued.-Was Maria Marten in any way con-
cerned with the five pound note ?
Mr. Brodrick interposed, and the Chief Baron thought it was rather
straining the case, and the subject was dropped.
On the 31st of July, last year, the prisoner stated to me, that Maria Marten was
living somewhere in the neigbbourhood of Yarmouth. Her name was then chiefly
connected with the five pound note. I left Polstead on the oth of August last;
Corder on that morning told me, be bad received a letter from me to Maria Marten.
He said he could not tell how to forward it by post. He did not know what direction
to put upon it. I told him I was afraid he was deceiving me, and I must insist upon
his forwarding it. He replied, be would endeavour to do so ; but repeated that bo
could not tell exactly where she was, but he believed it was in the neighbourhood
of Yarmouth. On the 19th of November following, I met bim accidentally near
Somerset House. I asked if he bad forwarded a letter of mine written to Maria
Marten, and forwarded to him in one on the 2d of September. He said he had.
I told him I was surprised at not receiving any letter, or any answer at all

from ibe young woman. fle told me either that he had written an answer to no,
or that lie thought be bad written an answer. I said, the only letter I had recoived
from bim, was that of the 20th of August (the letter just read). I asked the prisoner
where Maria Matten then was? He said, he had left her in the Isle of Wight. I
told bim that ber fatber bad written to me once or twice respecting her, and that be
was uneasy, not knowing where she was. I inquired of him if he was married to
her? He said, "No ;" he bad not yet settled his family affairs. He had before
assigned that as a reason for not baving married her. I can state positively that
this was on the 19th of November last.
James Leu.-1 am a police officer of Lambeth-street. On the 22d of last April,
I went to Grove-bouse, Ealing, about 10 o'clock in the morning. As I entered, be
came into the hall, out of the parlour. I told him I had a little business with bim.
Prisoner said, "Walk into the drawing-room," and we went in. I then told him I was
as officer from London, and was come to apprehend bim on a very serious charge,
and he niust consider himself my prisoner. He replied, "Very well,'' I told him
the charge was respecting a young woman of the name of Maria Marten, whom he
Had formerly kept company with. I said, she bad been missing for a length of time,
and strong suspicions were attached to him. I continued, "I believe you know
such a person? It was a young woman yon kept company with in Suffolk." He
srid no ; he did not know such a person. I asked him, "Did you never know such
a person?" He said, No; I must have made a mistake ; he was not the person !
wantrd. I said, "No: I bave not made a mistake-your name is Corder;" and I
am certain he was the person. I told him to recollect himself ; I bad asked him twice
if he knew such a person, and I would ask him a third time. He still said, No, be
did not; be never knew such a person. I then proceeded to search his person, and
took Irom bis pocket a bunch of keys. I then took him to the Red Lion at Brentford,
On our way thither, I said, the body of the young woman bad been found in his Red
Barn. He made po remark then. We proceeded some distance, and he asked me,
"Wben was the young woman ound?" I told bim, "On Saturday morning last."
lle made no further reply. I then left bim at the Red Lion, and reiurned to his
house. When I entered, Mrs. Corder showed me up stairs into a dressing-room. 1
opened two writing-desks with two of the keys he had given to mo.
Mr. Brodrick objected that the mere circumstance of the prisoner
having given the witness a bunch of keys, which opened some drawers,
did not warrant the reception of evidence as to any property found in the
house.
Mr. Andrews replied he would obviate the difficulty.
Examination continued. I had some conversation with the prisoner respecting
some pistols I bad found in the bouse. As we were coming to Bury gaol, he said
(to the best of my recollection) that he would niake me a present of them.
The pistols, in a black velvet bag, were then produced, but immedi.
ately put by.
I don't recollect that any thing bad previously passed ubout the pistols. He told
me he had bought them when he was ten years of age, at Ipswich. This was when
I was bringing him to Bury gaol, ar Polstead. I had then been examined before the
Coroner, and my deposition was reduced to writing. I took the prisoner to hear the
de,osicions read over to bim, and mine was amongst the number. I found, in the
dressing room at the bouse at Ealing, a pair of pistols. They were hanging in a
black bug on a nail.
Mr. Andrews again called for the production of the pistols.
Mr. Brodrick objected, that it did not appear that the pistols were
the prisoner's, or found in his house; for non constat that the house was
the house of the prisoner, there being other persons.
By the Judge. They were in my room all the time the prisoner was there.
The Chief Baron. I think I should be straining the point very far,
I rejected this evidence.
The pistols were then produced,
Ezamination resumed.-On the 30th of April, I found a sword there, which I hag

Robert Offord. I am a cutler, residing at Hadleigh, in this county. Last year
the prisoner called at my bouse : this was in the latter part of March, or beginning of
April, 1827. He brougbt a small sword, and said, "Mr. Offord, I have brought a
small sword, which I wish to bave ground as sbarp as a carving-knie, for the use of a
carving-knife." He wished to have it done, and he would call for it that night.
He said he had got a cousin about marrying in about a fortnight. I think I should
know it again.
Lea was then recalled, and produced the sword found in the house which he bad
taken the prisoner. It was in a trunk in the dressing room.
Offord recalled.- Identified the sword as the one he had sharpened for Corder.
It was about two feet in length, crescent-shaped, and perfectly bright.
Offord's examination continued. I ground it up quite sharp. It took a good deal
of labour to sharpen it up bright. The prisoner took it bome the same evening.
Cross-examined.- I will not swear that this was not before Christmas 1826. I
don't keep a job-book, and speak only from recollection. I was working by candle-
light; and so I do at Christmas time.
Re-examined. There are two or three stains which are now on the front and the
side, which were not on it when I delivered it to the prisoner. There are two or
tbree scratches on it. There is a spot or two on it at the back, and some elsewhere
near the point.  I can't say if they were on it when I gave it back to Corder.
George Gardner (looks at the sword).- I have seen one .ike this in Mrs. Corder's
bouse.
Cross-examined.--Tbere was an alarm that Mrs. Corder's house was about to be
robbed, in the spring of 1827. I sat up all night, and this was in the house. There
bad been robberies in the place about the time, and the people armed for their pro
tection.
John Baalham.- I am the constable of Polstead. I knew the prisoner and Maria
Marten. I never had a warrant to apprehend her. I never told the prisoner that I
bad a warrant 10 apprehend ber, or that I had a letter from Mr. Whitmore to appre-
hend her. The cloibes wbicb were on the body where given to me at the Inquest.
I have hud them ever since.
Cross-examined.--I had heard it reported in the place, that Maria Marten would
be taken up for baring bastard cbildren. I bave known prisoner all bis life, and
never knew him out of temper.
Henry Harcourt.-I am a gun-maker at Sudbury, and know the prisoner. In Fe.
bruary, 1827, be came and brought me a pair of pistols to be repaired. I don't know it
these (those which Lea produced) be they. They were percussion pistols, and so are
these. Percussion pistols bave been invented about seven or eight years.
Cross-examined. The prisoner and a young woman took them away. I did not
know her. They called for them on the 5th of March.
Thomas Acres.- I lived some time at Polstead. I recollect Stoke fair in 1827.
I know the Red Barn ut Polstead, and the thistley lay there. I never went over that
field with a pickaxe on my shoulder.
Cross-examined. I don't know wbat I was doing at the time of Stoke air. I
don't know that I worked with a pickaxe at all that year. I wore a velveteen
jacket, and so did the prisoner.
John Lawton.--I am a surgeon. I was present when the Coroner's jury went to
view the body found in the Red Barn on the 20th of April. It had not been dis-
turbed, except that the earth had been removed from tbe top of it. It lay in the
hole in the Barn in which it had been buried. It was in the right band bay of the
Barn. It was, in parts, much decomposed-parts more than others. From my ex
amination of tbe body, I should have said it had been in the ground nine or ter
months or more, had I known nothing of it. The stays, flannel petticoat, sbit, a
bandkerchief round the neck, stockings and garters, and high shoes, with portions
of a L-gborn bonnet trimmed with black. (Produces a silk handkerchief.) This
was found underneath ber hips. This is the handkerchief I took off the neck.
The rest of the articles he mentioned, the witness produced; they were
nearly indistinguishable as to material or form of article.
There was part of the sieere of a blue coat, and the body was in part of a sack
The right hand was on the right breast. She was quite crowded down close together.
It was a female body, a full-growo young woman.
I examined the face. It pas in
a very bad state, but there was an appearance of blood about it, particularly on the
rigbt side of it. I found the green striped bandkerchief round her neck. It was tied
In the usual way, but drawn extremely light, so as to form a complete ground round

659
the neck. It was apparently done for the purpose', as if it bad been putted s: hy some
person. It was sufficiently tight, that I should say, it would bave kuled ary one.
It would bave produced strangulation. The band might pass between the interior
and exterior olds of the handkercbief. There was in tbe neck an appearance of a
stab, about an inch and a half in lengtb; it was perpendicular. It extended deep
into the neck. I cannot say what parts particularly were injured by it, the body was
so putrid. There was a wen on the neck, about the midule of the neck, in irout.
There was the appearance of an injury baving been done to the right eye, an I the
right side of tbe face. It appeared as if sometbing bad passed into the eye, deep into
the orbit, injuring the bone and the nose. I tbink it was done in two ways; by
something passing in at the left cheek, and then out at the right orbit; and there was a
stab also. It appeared as if a ball had passed through the left cbeek, removing the two
last grinders. The brain was in sucb a state that it was impossible to make any thing
out of it. I don't think a ball so passing through would, of itself, cause death; but
with the strangulation, and the stab in tbe neck, would have been sufficient, with
the ball, to produce death. The bone dividing the postrils was quite broken, and
driven quite out of its place, apparently by the ball wbich bad passed through. I opened
the chest, but did not discover any myself. There was an adhesion of the lungs to
the membrane which lines the ribs on the rigbt side. This would, in life, cause
inflammation; and she would have complained of cough with pain in the side. I
found two small pieces of bone in tbe tbroat, wbich might bave fallen through during
the progress of decomposition. They were parts of the interior of the nose, as I
should ibink. The left hand was separated from the body; it had the appearance of
a skeleton band, and would have been produced by decomposition. I should think
that the injuries, without the bandkerchief, would not bave caused death; pos-
sibly they might from inflammation. I have since seen the beart and the ribs.
I have mysel a portion of the head. The ribs and the heart were brought by
Mt. Nairn, a surgeon, to my house. I then saw where something had pene-
trated between the fifth and sixth ribs, and there was a stab in the heart which
corresponded with the opening in the ribs. It appeared to bave been done with
a sharp instrument. That injury would bave been sufficient alone to produce
death. I found a corresponding mark on the shit; the opening in the sbit cor
responded in size witb that of the ribs, I saw no mark on the stays; they were too
nucb decomposed to bave seen tbe opening on them if there bad formerly been one.
have looked at the sword wbicb bas been produced, which appears to fit the wound
Jirongh the ribs and the opening in the sbit. I penetrated two or three inches. It
passed down the wound to that extent. I found one part of the wound wide, and the
viber narrow, so as to correspond with the sword. The ribs were in a very tolerable
slie of preservation. It appeared as if the wound in the heart bad been made by an
11.5! rument like this sword. I fted it also into a wound in the spberoidal sinus. It
irited into it about an inch. I bave examined the wound in the bead witb a
bullet.
On inquiry it turned out that no bullet had been found in the barn;
but he one spoken of was found in the black reticule containing the
pistols.
The bullet fitted the hole. I tbink the bull was first fired before tbe stab. I suw
some blood on the shift, tha stays, the bandkerchief round the neck, the lawn band-
kerchief, and the silk handkerchie, and apparently on the bonnet. I don't recol-
lect any part of a sbawl. I took off the garters; they were made of parrow wbite
tape. 'In taking hold of one of the shoes, the foot came off. Tbe lower and
upper jaw had each a tooth out; but cannot say on which side ; the one on the
right, I think, had been out a long time. I am able to distinguish between the
cavity of a tooth extracted while living, and tbat of one falling out by decay. I have
the head here. (Jaw produced.) This is the jaw, and there are now two teeth
gone : the one on the left, I think, has fallen out since death; the other bas been
out much longer.
Cross-examined.-I am thirty, in October. I have practised twelve months for
myself. I was six years with Mudd, of Gedding. I have never seen a body dissected
wbicb bad been buried pine or ten months. I did not perceive the stab in the ribs,
or the pistol- bullet in tbe Barn,--tbis was because I could not then clean tbe bones
sufficiently to examine so minutely. There was flesh on the face, but greatly de-
composed. In a wound made during life ibe edges gape open: one made after deatb,
gapes very little. I opened the chest and the abdomen in the Barn; when I opened
the chest, I made myself one wound in the heart. I am positive this was not the
wound I have spoken of. The one I made was in the right ventricle, upper part of

it, the other was just at the apex of the heart between the right and left ventricle.
I saw do injury other than I have spoken of: none made by a spade. The weight
of the body might have tightened the handkerchief round the neck in that way, if it
bad been raised up by the handkerchief after death. I took the shift from the body,
bot saw no mark in the shift at that time. I did not look for it till I bad discovered
the wound in the heart. The ribs, when brought to me, had the skin on. I sbould
have made the observations I did, with respect to the body, if it had been taken from
a grave in the churchyard. My judgment is formed from my own observations,
unmixed with what I have heard since. I can speak with certainty that the ball
came out at the eye, from the manner in which the bones are driven; the bones are
very much sbattered. At the Barn, I did not with certainty know whether this had
been done by a pistol-bullet, or was the effect of decomposition.
Re-examined. I have seen the dissection of dead bodies for fifteen years. I could
distinguish between a wound inflicted on digging up the body, and one giren many
months before. I believe that none of the wounds that I saw were done at the
digging up of the body. I did not very particularly examine the hips wben the body
was taken up. The groove round the neck, produced by the bandkercbiel, could
not have been produced by the lifting up of the body by the external fold of the band.
kerchief at the discovery of the body. It might bave been produced by the lifting it
up in that manner just as the person was dying. From the appearance, this must bave
been occasioned at the period of the death of the person. After cleaning the bones
I could see the injury done to them better tban I could before. I bave no doubt it
was done by a bullet at some time or other.
any
Mr. Andrews then proposed to call another medical witness, in order
to corroborate the testimony of the preceding one.
The Lord Chief Baron asked the learned Counsel, whether, after
the fatigue which they had all undergone during the day, he would pro-
ceed further that night. He should conceive that the witness whom
the learned gentleman had called would not be the only witness whom he
would have occasion to call in support of his case.
Mr. Andrews replied, that he certainly had other medical witnesses to
call in confirmation of his case, and not only medical witnesses, but such
others as were necessary to identify the different articles found on the
body discovered in the Barn, as articles of dress belonging to Maria
Marten.
The Lord Chief Baron said, that as that was the case, he thought
the hour had now arrived at which it would be expedient to adjourn
the Court. It was quite evident the case could not finish that night.
There were several witnesses, it appeared, to be examined on the part
of the prosecution ; and after that there was, if he was rightly informed
(but of that he knew nothing), a defence of considerable length to be
delivered by the prisoner. After that it would be his duty to charge
the Jury; and, to say nothing of other inconveniences to public
justice, he must observe, that at the end of that time, he himself should
scarcely be in a condition to make those remarks on the evidence which
would naturally be expected from him. In a civil case, he might per-
haps have been inclined to bave proceeded with the trial to-night; but
in a case of such solemn importance to the prisoner at the bar, and of
such great importance to the public in general, he could not presume
to enter upon an analysis of the evidence, when they must all of them
be so extremely fatigued. Under these circumstances he thought
that they must adjourn till the following morning.
It was of course determined that this adjournment should take place.
The crier then proceeded to swear in the diferant officers of the High
Sheriff, each of whom had to remain during the night in attendance
upon a juror, to prevent all communication (except among themselves)
on the subject of the trial, when one of these officers refused to wait

all vight upon anybody. The crier immediately asked bim whether
he was not a hired officer of the High Sheriff, and whether he was not
acting under bis anthority. The man, not at the moment aware of
the force of his answer, did not hesitate to reply in the affirmative;
whereupon the crier informed him he had no choice ;-he must take
the oath, or else submit to such fine as the Court, when informed of
his conduct, might think proper to impose upon him. The officer
instantly submitted, and was sworn.
The prisoner, who had during the early part of the day maintained an
air of indifference to his awful situation, there being generally a smile
playing upon his features, although his eye had a heavy fixedness, occa
sionally convulsed with a sudden movement, betraying, with a character
not to be mistaken, the emotion under which he laboured during the
delivery of particular passages in the evidence, seemed to have lost a
considerable part of his contidence towards the close of the day. Much
of this alteration may, perhaps, be attributable to the fatigue incident
to his situation. The fact of the alteration was, however, too apparent
to
escape observation. His attention was intensely directed towards the
surgeon during the whole of his examination.
The adjournment took place at half past 6 o'clock in the evening.
The anxiety of the crowd outside during the day was almost unex
ampled. There were few ladies within the Court, the risk of the tremen-
dous rush being perilous enough for the other sex, but the external stone
basement of the windows, particularly that behind the Judge, was filled
by ladies, whose curiosity throughout the day was not damped by the
heavy showers of a thunder-storm which feil in rapid succession, and
pattered upon their umbrellas with a sound which once or twice inter
rupted the business of the Court. Several of the windows were broken
by the pressure of the throng.
Corder was carried to Court between the Governor of the prison and a
single attendant, in a sort of taxed-cart, out of which the prisoner jumped
with great alacrity. There were some hisses from the crowd, but he was
in a moment removed from their presence. It was remarked in the Court
during the day, that he constantly used a small penknife, which he took
from his waistcoat pocket, to mend his pencil while taking notes.
Second Day, Friday, August 8th, 1828.
The arrangements of this morning, for the admission of the public,
were very well managed, and the active interposition of the Governor of
the prison (Mr. Orridge) had the best effect in keeping the officers of the
High Sheriff in their proper places, and preserving the avenues of the
Court from the pressure of that vast assemblage which yesterday poured in
when the doors were opened, with a force so tremendous as to risk the
limbs of those who were not sufficiently athletic for active personal resist-
We understand that the Lord Chief Baron, who was himself car-
ried off his legs in endeavouring to pass from his carriage to the door of
the Shire-hall

the public; and the consequence was, a befitting regularity in conducting
the proceedings of the Court, and the presence of a number of ladies,
whose curiosity (yesterday disappointed) was this day gratified by hearing
the close of the trial.
At a quarter before nine o'clyck, Corder was put to the bar. He was
dressed the same as yesterday, On inquiry, it is understood his age
is
not 40, but about 30 or 32. He rose early in the prison, and was, du-
ring the whole of the morning, before he was brought to Court, engaged in
introducing some alterations in his written defence, which were suggested
to him late last night by his Counsel. Liis manner was collected, his
complexion fresh, and he looked around him at times with seeming cheer-
fulness. He was not, however, so entirely at his ease as he appeared to
be early on the previous day; his head was not so erect, and he repeat-
cdly heaved deep sighs. Immediately on being put to the bar, he put on
his spectacles, folded his arms, and displayed an oscillating and swinging
notion of his body, while he leaned his back against the pillar of the
dock. He hung down his head frequently during the examination of the
witnesses.
During the re-examination of Mr. Lawton, the surgeon, this morning,
who produced the skull of the deceased, which was handed from the
Counsel to the Jury, and exhibited so as to be observable in its fractured
condition to the whole Court, the prisoner, who had just taken off his
spectacles, replaced them, and beheld attentively this painful spectacle;
he inclined his body forward so as to command a full view of the skull;
but, as if the effort to sustain this attitude, and evince this expression,
bad become too great for his nerves, he suddenly flung his back against the
pillar, hastily drew off his spectacles, and evidently laboured under the
strongest emotion. In a few minutes, however, he rallied, replaced ..s
glasses, took out his pocket-book, and quickly wrote a memorandum to
his leading Counsel (Mr. Brodrick), who at once wrote a reply, which
the prisoner read with close attention, and on the signification of a move
ment from the learned Counsel, tore it into the smallest fragments. His
solicitur, at the same time, went to the front of the dock, and had a long
consultation with him.
At nine o'clock precisely, the Lord Chief Baron took his seat, and
hoped the Jury had been as comfortably situated last night as was practi-
cable.
The Jury replied in the affirmative, and after their names were called
over, the examination of witnesses was resumed.
John Charles Nairn, examined by Mr. Andrews.- I have been a surgeon upwards
of a year, and in the profession upwards of twelve years. On the 19th of last May,
I attended with Mr. Chaplin at Polstead : Baalbam, the constable, was present. Ho
disinterred a body in my presence. I examined the cavities of tbe chest of the body
so disinterred.
Mr. Brodrick wished the identity of the body to be proved before the
svitness was examined respecting it.
Bacham was then called. I am parish clerk of Polstead, and screwed down the body
found ir, the Red Barn into the collin. The same coffin was afterwards disinterred
by witness, and contained the same body.
Cross-examined. I was not present when the body was buried, but am sure it was
ibe same body.
Mr. Nairn recalle 1.- I found the internal parts of the chest in perfect preserva-
tion; so much so, that the slightest injury penetrating into it might have been ob
served. The heart was lying divested of its developing membrane. I discovered a
large wound in the back part of the right ventricle. I could not tell if it appeared to

663
be a recent wound. I formed an opinion on it on my first examination, but I subse
quentiy examined it, and I then formed an opinion that it was a recent wound. 1
detached the heart from its connexion with the blood-vessels. I next examined the
external surface of the ribs, and in the space between the fifth and sixth ribs I dis-
covered a wound, about three-quarters of an inch broad. My opinion was, that it
was a wound of long duration, and not a recent one. I again examired the beurt
wben I returned home, and discovered a slight wound, about two inches from the
apex, corresponding with the external wound between the ribs. It appeareu to have
been inflicted by some sbary instrument. [Lea, the officer, produced the sword.]
This sword is the most likely instrument to bave inflicted such a wound. Supposing
this wound to have been inflicted upon a living body, it would, in my opinion, most
certainly bave produced death. I have since inspected the head of the disinterred
body. I have applied this sword to the wound between the ribs, and it corresponds
with the wound to the extent of two or three inches. There are, on the sword,
some marks of discolouration, about the extent of two or three inches. I examined
the wound in the heart, having this sword with me; it might certainly have been
made by this sword. On examining the bead, I traced the progress of a ball enter-
ing into tbe interior and back part of the upper left jaw, and proceeding to the inter-
nal angle of the right eye. From the size of the opening, I should conclude it to
bave been a small pistol ball. This wound might have caused death, but the person
might have survived it. I also found a fissure, opening into the sphenoidal sinus,
corresponding with the vertebr. It was an opening produced by some sharp-pointed
instrument; any sharp-pointed instrument would have produced it. It exteoded
about a quarter of an inch into the sphenoidal sinus. I am not aware of any other
wound on the bead. The wound in the sphenoidal sinus might bave occasioned
death. The sword corresponds with it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Brodrick.--This was on the 19th of May, about a month
after the finding of the body in the Barn. The disinterment of the body, exposure to
the air, and lying on the ground, in another month, would not have caused, in such
a body, much additional decomposition. I found the heart divested of the pericar-
dium. Looki g merely at the heart, and knowing nothing of the circumstances I
bave heard since, I should say that the wound in the right ventricle of the heart was
a recent one. I should have been of opinion, independent of anything but the in-
spection of the heart itself, that one was a recent, and the other a more ancient one,
because the smaller wound of the two bad gaping edges. From the nature of the
wound, I should judge that it had not been inflicted when the pericardium was re-
moved. The apex of the living heart touches the ribs. There are cartilages con-
pecting the ribs with the sternum, and with each other. The bones of the head were
not in a state of the least decomposition. The only parts which were out of their
places were those where the wounds had been inflicted by the bullet. I first saw the
head after the exbumation of the body. It was shown to me by Mr. Lawton, and I
don't know, of my own knowledge, that it was the head of the body found in the barn.
A knife would have inflicted the wound on the beart.
Re-examined.The wound was broader at that part of the ribs adjoining the
sternum.
Mr. Lawton, the surgeon, recalled.- The head I showed to Mr. Nairn, was that
belonging to the body found in the Red Barn. I assisted in removing the hody from
its grave in the Barn, and took off the head myself. I gave it to Baalbam the sumo
afternoon ; a day or two afterwards he returned it. It was the same bead as the one
I took from the body.
Baalham recalled. - The head wbich Mr. Lawton delivered to me was the same
which I returned to him.
Henry Robert Chaplin, examined by Mr. Kelly.-I bave been practising as a
surgeon for four years. I saw the disinterred body in company with Mr. Nairn I
found the chest in good preservation. There was a wound in the right ventricle,
which was first discovered. Tbat wound appeared to be a recently inflicted wound.
I afterwards found another wound on the heart, but whether of recent infliction or
not, I cannot tell from its appearance. I found a transverse wound situate between
the fifth and sixth ribs, wbicb appeared to have been inflicted by a weapon wbich
bad a broad back and a sharp edge. I did not see the sword fitted with it. The
wound in the heart appeared to be a continuation of that between the ribs. The
wound in the beart migbt have been inflicted in stripping the pericardium from the
heart; but if the wound be a continuation of that between the ribs, it could

I sbould think it would not have been a mortal wound with certainty. There was
also a thrust in the eye, wbicb was inflicted by a sharp instrument with a broad
back, and might bave been the same which inflicted that on the beart.
Cross-examined.-The wound on the sphenoidal sinus might bave been inflicted
by a sharp-pointed instrument. It was about the eighth part of an inch. If the
wound in the heart bad been inflicted on a living subject, it would have occasioned
a great effusion of blood, unless syncope instantly took place. From the shock
given to the system, tbere might have been no effusion of blood. It is impossible
to say whether the bullet made its entry into, or its exit from, the eye,
Mr. Lawton re-called, produced the bead; and with the sword and the bead
explained to the Jury the nature of the wound on the sphenoidal sinus, and the
reasons for supposing it to have been inflicted by the sword. It appeared that the
sword entered by the sphenoidal sinus, traversed the mouth at the back part of the
nose, and made its exit by the right eye. The sword, being applied to the sup-
posed course of the instrument, was found to agree with the conjectured progress of
the sword causing the wound. Being applied to the other eye, it was found to be
impracticable to trace any opening from thence into the spenoidal sinus.
Mr. Lawton re-examined. There is a tooth out on each side of ibe upper jaw,
and one out of the lower jaw. One of the upper jaw teeth bad apparently dropped
out; the other, and the lower tooih, must, from their cavities, have been out for a
length of time.
Mr. Matthews recalled.-Maria Marten had an enlargement on the centre front,
which had the appearance of a wen.
Mrs. Marten, the mother, recalled. (Looks at the articles of dress found on the
body taken from the Red Barn.)- These are Maria's combs. I saw her with them
on her head on the 18th of last May twelve months. These are the earrings she
bad in her ears at the same time : they are both of them bers. This is the hand.

was one she had on at the same time; this was next ber throat, and the silk one
over it. Tbis is a piece of a Legborn bat: she bad on a Leghorn bt when I saw

These are the shoes sbe had on. This is the ashen busk in her stays. This is part
of a pair of stays. This is the sleeve of a chemise, the make of wbich is the same as
that she had on the 18th of May, 1827, when she went to the Red Barn.
This witness was so overpowered, either by her feelings, by the
effluvia of the rags, or by the heat of the Court, that she was with diffi-
culty preserved from fainting by the restoratives given her at the close of
her examination.
Lea, the officer, produced the velvet bag.
The Chief Baron.I don't think it is sufficiently traced to come from
any place proved to belong to the prisoner.
Mr. Andrews.The prisoner was apprehended in the house in which
his sword was, and in which was a desk, which opened by a key he him-
self
gave to the officer; and in the same room was found this bag
The Chief Baron.-I think you had better not press it.
Ann Marten, the sister of Maria, recalled. This green bandkerchief is the same
that my sister went away with. Tbis silk handkercbief sbu also had on at the same
time. These are the same shoes. This is part of the Leghorn bonnet, trimmed
with black ribbon. This is a piece of the bonnet she had in the bag when she went
out; she bad a man's bat on her head. These are like the combs she bad in her
the same time. She bad on a pair of earrings ; and these are such ones as
my sister went away with in her ears.
Mr. Andrews stated to the Court, that there was found in the desk,
opened with the key given by the prisoner to Lea, letters directed to
Corder, and also a passport for France for Corder.
The Chief Baron thought it safer not to receive evidence of this, espe-
cially as, in a case of this nature, all doubtful points ought, from the im-
portance of the trial to the prisoner, to be decided in his favour
The prisoner here bowed his gratitude to his Lordship.

Mfarten, the father, recalled. The soll in the Barn is a dryish, little gravelly, and
story soil.
Mrs. Marten, recalled, proved that her daughter wore wbite narrow tape garters.
Mr. Matthews proved ibut Maria Marten wa: able to write very well.
This was the case on the part of the prosecution.
The prisoner, being called on for his defence, advanced to the front of
the bar, took out some papers, and read nearly as follows, with a very
tremulous voice :-
I am informed that by the law of England, the Counsel for a prisoner
is not allowed to address the Jury, though the Counsel for the Crown is
allowed that privilege. While I deplore, as much as any human being
can, the fatal event which has caused this inquiry, let me entreat you to
dismiss from your minds the publications of the public press, from the
time of its first promulgation to this hour; let me entreat you, let ine
dissuade you, if I can, from being influenced by the horrid and disgusting
details which have for months issued from the public press--a powerful
engine for fixing the opinions of large classes of the community, but
which is, too often, I fear, though unintentionally, the cause of affixing
slander upon innocence. I have been described as a monster, who,
while meditating becoming the husband of this girl, to whom I was
evincing an affectionate attachment, was actually premeditating and
plotting the perpetration of this horrid crime. With such misrepresen-
tations it was natural, perhaps, to expect that an unfavourable impres-
sion should have been created against me, and the more so when the
accusation went beyond the present case, and was connected with
other crimes well calculated to excite prejudice against me.
It is
natural you should come to this trial with feelings of prejudice; but as
you expect peace and serenity of mind at home, I implore you to banish
from your minds all the horrible accusations which have been promul-
gated, and give your verdict on the evidence alone. Consider, gentle-
men, that the attorney for the prosecution is also the Coroner before
whom the Inquest was taken; and his conduct, in refusing my being
present at the inquest, is conduct which you cannot approve. Since
my conmittal, the Coroner has been again at Polstead, -has got up
additional evidence. My solicitor pressed for a copy of the depositions,
which was refused. In consequence of these urjust proceedings, I
never heard one of the witnesses examined, and cannot, therefore,
have come prepared as I ought to be. The Coroner, thus acting in
his double capacity, was likely enough, when meditating to act as
attorney for the prosecution, to have entertained impressions inconsis-
tent with the fit discharge of his inquisitorial inquiry; and again, as
attorney for the prosecution, he was liable to be diverted from the ful-
filment of his duties as Coroner; so that I was, in this respect, on the
threshold of inquiry, exposed to disadvantages from which I ought
to have been saved. This, however, was not all: my solicitor remon-
strated; he was not only refused copies of the depositions, but the
attorney for the prosecutiori
, without any notice to me, has visited
Polstead, and taken examinations upon oath, of the different witnesses,
and come to this trial prepared with evidence taken behind my back,
and pruned down to suit the exaggerations of this case. I therefore
am brought to be tried for my life, without any fair knowledge of the
evidence against me. In consequence of this unjust proceeding on the
part of the Coroner, how can I controvert, as I might have done
40

were I allowed to hear the witnesses, equivocal facts and highly
coloured statements, of which I am for the first time informed when
brought to trial for
my
life? Were witnesses to be privately ez mined,
and their evidence clandestinely obtained ? It has been well observed,
that truth is sometimes stronger than fiction. Never was this asser-
tion better exemplified than in this hapless instance. In a few short
months I have been deprived of all my brothers, and my father recently
before that period. I have heard the evidence, and am free to say,
that, unexplained, it may cause great suspicion; but you will allow me
to explain it.
Proceeding, my
Lord and Gentlemen, to the real facts of this case,
I admit that there is evidence calculated to excite suspicion; but these
facts are capable of explanation; and convinced as I am of my
entire
innocence, I have to entreat you to listen to my true and simple detail
of the real facts of the death of this unfortunate woman. I was myself
so stupified and overwhelmed with the strange and disastrous circum-
stance, and on that account so unhappily driven to the necessity of im-
mediate decision, that I acted with fear instead of judgment, and I did
that which any innocent man might have done under such unhappy
circumstances. I concealed the appalling occurrence, and was, as is
the misfortune of such errors, subsequently driven to sustain the first
falsehoods by others, and to persevere in a system of delusion, which
furnished the facts concealed for a long time. At first I gave a false
account of the death of the unfortunate Maria. I am now resolved to
disclose the truth, regardless of the consequences. To conceal her
pregnancy from my mother, I took lodgings at Sudbury : she was
delivered of a male child, which died in a fortnight, in the arms of Mrs.
Marten, als hough the newspapers have so perverted that fact; and it
was agreed between Mrs. Marten, Maria, and me, that the child should
be buried in the fields. There was a pair of small pistols in the bed-
room ; Maria knew they were there. I had often showed them to her.
Maria took them
away
I had some reason to suspect she had
some correspondence with a gentleman, by whom she had a child, in
London. Though her conduct was not free from blemish, I at length
yielded to her entreaties, and agreed to marry her: and it was arranged
go to Ipswich, and procure a licence and marry. Whether
I said there was a warrant out against her, I know not. It has been
proved that we had many words, and that she was crying when she
eft the house. Gentlemen, this was the origin of the fatal occurrence.
I gently rebuked her; we reached the Barn: while changing her dress,
she flew into a passion, upbraiding me with not having so much regard
for her as the gentleman before alluded to. Feeling myself in this
manner so much insulted and irritated, when I was about to perform
every kindness and reparation, I said, " Maria, if you go on in this way
before marriage, what have 1 to expect ater? I shall, therefore, stop
when I can; I will return straight home, and you can do what you like,
and act just as you think proper." I said I would not marry her. lu
consequence of this, I retired from her, when I immediately heard the
report of a gun or pistol, and, running back, I found the unhappy gir'
weltering on the ground. Recovering from my stupor, I thought to
have left the spot; but I endeavoured to raise her from the ground, but
found her entirely lifeless. To my horror I discovered the pistol was
my own she had privately taken from my bed-room. Thero sho
from me.

lay, killed by one of my own pistols, and I the only being by! My
faculties were suspended. I knew not what to do. The instant the
mischief happened, I thought to have made it public ; but this would
have added to the suspicion, and I then resolved to conceal her death.
I then buried her in the best way I could. I tried to conceal the fact
as well as I could, giving sometimes one reason for her absence, and
sometimes another. It may be asked, Why not prove this by wit-
nesses ? Alas! how can I ? How can I offer any direct proof how she
possessed herself of my pistols, for I found the other in her reticule ?
That she obtained them cannot be doubted. All I can say as to the
stabs is, that I never saw one; and I believe the only reason for the
surgeon's talking of them is, that a sword was found in my possession.
I can only account for them by supposing that the spade penetrated her
body when they searched for the body in the Barn. This I know, that
neither from me, nor from herself, did she get any stab of this descrip-
tion. I always treated her with kindness, and had intended to marry her.
What motive, then, can be suggested for my taking her life? I could
have easily gotten over the promise of marriage. Is it possible. I could
have intended her destruction in this manner? We went, in the middle
of the day, to a place surrounded by cottages. Would this have been
the case had I intended to have murdered her? Should I have myself
furnished the strongest evidence that has been adduced against me? I
might, were I a guilty man, have suppressed the time and place of her
death; but my plain and unconcealed actions,because they were guilt-
less,-supplied both. Had I intended to perpetrate so dreadful a crime,
would I have kept about me some of the articles which were known to
be Maria's ? Had I sought her life, could I have acted in such a
manner? Had I, I would have chosen another time and place. Look
at my conduct since Did I run away? No; I lived, months and
months, with my mother. I left Polstead in consequence of my family
aflictions. I went to the Isle of Wight. It is said that the passport
was obtained to enable me to leave England at any time. No; it was
to enable me to visit some friends of my wife's in Paris. Should I
have kept her property, had I anything to fear from their detection ?
In December last, I advertised, in " The Times" newspaper, the sale of
my house, and gave my name and address at full length. Did this look
like concealment? You will consider any man innocent till his guilt is
fully proved. It now rests with you to restore me to society, or to an
ignominious death. To the former I feel I am entitled ; against the
latter I appeal to your justice and humanity. I have nothing more to
add, but that I leave my life in your hands, aware that you will give
me the humane benefit of the law, in cases of doubt, and that your
Lordship will take a compassionate view of the melancholy situation in
which
my
misfortunes have placed me.
The above was the substance of the prisoner's address. It was
delivered, in many parts, in a feeble and tremulous tone of voice, and
under considerable emotion. It is clear, from the pronunciation of
particular words, that the prisoner is not a man of particular education.
He trembled a good deal, but not more than a nervous man would
manifest in a moment of excitement. He read the address from a copy-
book; and, whether from the composition not being his own, or his
being near-sighted, he stammered over several words, and infringed the
order of the sentences. He was heard with the utmost silenco and

attention by the Court and the Jury, and he occasional y drew his eyes
from the book, and fixed them on the jury-box, as if to ascertain the
impression he had made. Towards the closc of his address his roice
faltered, so as, in particular passayes, to be nearly inaudible. His
address, which was delivered between 11 and 12 o'clock, occupied the
Court about 25 minutes.
WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENCE.
Wm. Goodwin. I live in Plough-lane, Sudbury. The prisoner, in the spring of
ast year, came to take apartments at my house. Maria Marten afterwards came
and lay in there. They were there between two and three months. She was
delivered of a child there. The prisoner came once or twice a week to see her, as
well after as before her confinement. When I saw them together, I know nothing
to the contrary of his appearing fond oi her. She went, before or after her confine-
ment, to Mr. Harcourt's, the gunsmith, at Suubury. I remember their leaving my
place, at nine o'clock in the evening, in a one-horse chaise. This was on the 16th
of April. They took the little child with th. 1.
Cross-examined.--I do not know Mr. Harcourt, or Ipswich.
Mary Anne Goo:lwin, wie of the last witness.-I knew Maria Marten, who
lodged with me in March, 1827 ; she was brought by the prisoner. She was con-
fined there, and was there better than two months. l'he prisoner frequently came
to visit ber; he never missed coming once a week. De treated her always with
kindness, and they appeared very much attached to each other. She was generally
in very bad spirits. I heard her say she went for the pistols to the shop where they
Cross-examined.-She went for them alone to Mr. Harcourt's.
Thomas Hardy. I was in the employ of Mrs. Corder last year. In February last
year I saw the prisoner cleaning pistols. I saw Maria Marten on the 13th of May,
with the prisoner, walking across the yard towards the stable. There are two slair-
cases in Mrs. Corder's house ; and a person may go up to what was the prisoner's
room by one of them without Mrs, Corder's knowing anything about it,
Cross-examined. It was nine o'clock in the evening when I saw them going to the
stable,
Lucy Balam.- I lived with Mrs, Corder eleven months, till last Old Michaelmas
day. I have seen a pair of pistols in the prisoner's bed-room, sometimes in a box
and sometimes out of it. The prisoner remained with his mother till about a
fortnight before I left. He always appeared a very kind and good-natured young
Edward Liveing.-I am a surgeon of Nayland, near Polstead, I have attended
him professionally, About this time last year I advised him to leave that part of the
country, and to go to a warm bathing-place, particularly mentioning Hastings, and
the south coast. He was then strongly threatened with consumption. Some time
after that, I understood he was gone.
Thirza Havers.--I have known the prisoner from his infancy. I have always
found him to be a kind and humane man,
Juhn Bugg.-) was the looker of Mrs. Corder's farm, He always bore the
character of a mild and humane man.
Juhn Pryke, (a school-fellow of the prisoner), and Mary Kerscy, who had known
him from his infancy, gave him the same character.
By Mr. Kelly.- Are you related to the prisoner ?His cousin.
By Mr. Brodrick.- and has that circumstance made you more intimately
acquainted with him and bis cbaracter than you would otherwise have been ?-it
has, Sir.
John Borehamn and John B alham gave similar evidence.
At twenty minutes to twelve the Lord Chief Baron began to sum
up the case. He informed the Jury that the prisoner at the bar was
indicted for the murder of Maria Marten, and that the law required
that the mode in which she had come to her death should be particularly
stated in the indictment. The present indictment, therefore, contained
the charge against the prisoner in a great variety of ways. It stated,
that the deceased had come to her death by means of the prisoner,-
frst. by a discharge of fire arms,--then by wounds inflicted by a sharp
mun.

603
instrument,-then by strangulation,-and last of all, by being buried
alive in the ground. This was done in order to have the indictment
supported by evidence in whatever way the evidence might turn out;
and if the Jury s ould be of opinion that the prisoner at the bar had
caused the death of Maria Marten by one, or two, or three of the modes
mentioned in the indictment, then they would have sufficient evidence
to support the purposes of this indictment, and the Crown would have
a right to expect that they would find the prisoner guilty upon it. Be-
fore he entered upon the details of the case, he felt it to be his duty to
advert to something which had been said by the prisoner, as to the
prejudices which had been raised against him both in this county and
throughout the country generally. It was unfortunate, extremely un-
fortunate, whenever such prejudices were raised; for they placed the
life of the prisoner more in jeopardy than the ordinary circumstances of
the case against him. Sorry, indeed, was he tu say, that, as society
was constituted at present, they could not be avoided. Accounts of
this transaction, it appear. d, had a'so found their way into the news-
papers. Those accounts only related to the charge at the com-
mencement of the business: they contained an ex parte statement of it,
without giving the prisoner an opportunity of urying anything in his
defence against it; and t'at was certainly a mischiet, and an injury to
him. The Jury, however, had a more impartial task to perform : they
had to decide this issue by hearing the evidence on both s des, whereas
hitherto the public had heard one side only. "We have also been
told," said the venerable Judge, " that drawings and placards have
been dispersed, not only in the neighbourhood of this town, but also in
the immediate neighbourhood of this very Hall, tending to the manifest
detriment of the prisoner at the bar. Such a practice is so indecorous
and so unjust, that I can with difficulty bring myself to believe that
any person, even in the very lowest class, will so far degrade himself
as to think of deriving gain from the exhibition of this melancholy
transaction,
Another circumstance to which the prisoner has alluded in his
defence, and which I trust, for the sake of religion itself, is a mistake
another circumstance, which I feel myself bound to notice, is the asser-
tion that a mirister of the Gospel, quitting the place where he usually
performed divine worship, and erecting his pulpit near the very scene
of this melancholy tragedy, had there endeavoured to inflame the
passions and to excite the resentment of the populace against the
prisoner, when he knew nothing of his having had any share in it,
except from rumour; thus inflaming them against a crime which was
not then known to have been committed, and exciting their resentment
against an imlividual who was not proved to have committed it. I
cannot conceive any act more contrary to the spirit and the principles
of that religion of which he professes bimself a minister; and if we have
been rightly informed of his conduct, the man who could commit such
an act deserves the most severe reprobation. I do not know who the
individual is who is stated to have misconducted himself so much. I
hope we are all labouring under some mistake on this point, and that
this outrage upon decency has not been committed. I mention it merely
to request you to tear from your bosoms every impression which may
have been made in them from such a source. I call upon you to dis-
miss from your consideration every impression of this case which you

may have derived, either from seeing the statements in the newspapers
or the drawings and placards in the streets, or from hearing the sermon
if I may dignify it by that name-pronounced in the place where, and
on the occasion when, this murder was discovered. It is for you to
decide entirely upon the evidence which has been adduced before you,
giving to the case for the prosecution that weight which public justice
demands that it should receive at your hands, and to the case for the
prisoner that weight which a due regard for his life and interests
equally demands from you. That is my most earnest recommendation
to you, Gentlemen of the Jury; and I trustindeed I am certainthat
you will pay to it requisite attention. The course which has just
been taken by the prisoner, who has been very ably advised, as we all
know, renders it unnecessary fr me to state much of the evidence which
we have now been engaged two days in receiving. If the defence had
taken a different turn from that which it has taken, I should have thought
it my duty to ask you, first of all, whether you were convinced that
Maria Mrten had been destroyed at all, either by the prisoner at the
bar or by any one else; and then, whether you were convinced that the
body discovered in the barn was her body or not. In that case, I
should have pointed out to you how uncertain the identification of the
body was, from the state of decomposition in which it was found; and
yet I should have stated to you that there were some circumstances
tending to prove its identity with Maria Marten: as, for instance, the
excrescence or wen on the neck, and the different articles of dress which
had been spoken to as hers from their not having undergone so much
decomposition as the human substance. All these remarks, however,
are now rendered unnecessary-for the prisoner avows to us in his
defence that the body discovered in the barn is the body of Maria
Marten. I am therefore relieved from the necessity of addressing you
that part of the case, as it is admitted by the prisoner that the body,
the discovery of which has given rise to this trial, is the body of Maria
Marten, for whose murder he is indicted. The prisoner admits that he
buried her in the barn, and we are therefore refieved from one of the
difficulties of this case. The next part of the evidence to which I shall
call
your attention is, that which regards the different accounts which
the prisoner gave, after the disappearance of Maria Marten, of the
various places at which she was living; for those account: have some
bearing upon his defence. I might, perhaps, be relieved fro the neces-
sity of alluding to that part of the evidence altogether, but tle manner
of the prisoner's avowal may, when closely considered, be of seme avail
in enabling us to discover the truth of his statement, that her de.
th was
occasioned by a voluntary act of suicide on her part. I shall nt omit
reading any
of the evidence which has reference to this point,
nless
you, gentlemen, state to me that in your opinion it is unnecessary fit me
to read it."
The learned Judge then proceeded to read the evidence of Mrs.

Corder sand, " Mrs. Marten, the reason I go to Ipswich to-day
because John Baalham, the constable, came into the stable this morning
and informed me that he had got a letter from Mr. Whitmore, of Lon-
don, and that in that letter there was a warrant to have Maria taken up,
to be prosecuted for her bastard children;" the learned Judge observed,
that this was very important evidence, as it bore directly upon the

671
prisoner's defence: it showed that he was endeavouring to seduce her
away from her home, by holding out to her a terror which had no
existence in reality. The Jury would consider how far this was or was
not evidence to contradict the statement of the prisoner. It appeared,
also, from the evidence of Mrs. Marten, that Maria Marten was very
low spirited on setting out for the Red Barn, and had been so for some
time previously. That circumstance ought by no means to be forgotten
by the Jury in considering this case. He likewise called their attention
to the circumstance of Mrs. Marten's having deposed, that Corder
snapped his pistols before he set out for the Red Barn, twice or thrice by
the fire-side, in the presence of the whole familya circumstance which
proved, that at that time the pistols were rather in the possession of the
prisoner than of Maria Marten. The learned Judge then proceeded to
read and comment upon the evidence of Thomas Marten, the father,
and particularly on that part of it, in which the old man said, that in
seeking for the body, he put in a spike about her hip, but that the
smallest end of it was about the size of the end of his little finger, and
that it grew broader as it went upwards. The learned Judge, after
commenting on the evidence given by the other witnesses, till he came
to that of Lea, the police officer, said he was glad to find from his testi-
mony, that the depositions were read over to the prisoner in his pre-
sence, by the Coroner, after the Inquest; and observed, that that was a
point on which he would make a few remarks before he closed his ad-
dress to thein. He likewise observed, that it was very extraordinary, if
the statement which the prisoner had that day made were true, that he
had not said a syllable about it to Lea at the time when he was appre-
hended; but that he had repeatedly asserted, that he never knew any.
thing of any such person as Maria Marten, though he was then formally
informed that he was accused of having murdered her.
The learned Judge again repeated that he was glad that the deposi.
tions had been read over to the prisoner by the Coroner in the Jury-
room at Polstead after the Inquest, as it took away a sting of the accu-
sation which he had made against the Coroner. On coming to the
evidence of Mr. Lawton, the surgeon, he particularly called the atten-
tion of the Jury to the evidence which that gentleman had given re-
specting the fracture of the skull of Maria Marten by a pistol-ball, re-
specting the wounds in her neck, heart, and ribs, by a sharp instru-
ment, and respecting the possibility of her having died by strangulation
from the tightness of the handkerchief round her neck. They had heara
it that day asserted, that this poor woman had committed suicide ; but
even according to the story which they had heard, it was very strange
that immediately on being left alone she should use such various instru-
ments to destroy herself; for it appeared, in the first place, that she
must have fired a pistol at herself, and then, either before or after firing
it, have given herself sundry stabs in very different parts of her body.
It would be the duty of the Jury to consider what credit they would give
to the statements made by the medical witnesses about the stabs in the
neck and in the heart; and then, if they gave credit to them, to consi-
der what inferences they ought to draw from them, as to the story
which had that day been told to them by the prisoner at the
bar. The Jury had heard the defence, in which the prisoner admitted
the body discovered in the barn to be the body of Maria Marten, and to
have been buried by himself. He admitted that the representations which
## p. 672 (#708) ############################################
672
THE RED BARN,
he had made to several persons of lier being alive, after her disappear
ance from her father's cottage, were untrue ; but he said that he had
found it necessary to make them in consq ence of the alarm which he
necessarily felt from a catastrople of the following nature:-He said
that, on the 18th of May, he and Maria set out from old Marten's cot-
tage for the Red Barn, in order to go to Ipswich to get married. That
they quarrelled at that Barn. That she used very violent language to
him." That he told her that if she used such language to him before
marriage, he could not expect to be happy with her : fter marriage. That
he had told her that he would not inarry lier. That he then left her.
That hearing the report of a pistol in the Barn, he returned to it, and
that he then found her there mortally wounded. He likewise said, that
being alarmed at the extraordinary catastrople which he saw before
him, he buried her, and in this manner he attempted to account for the
representations which he afterwards made - bout her being alive. Now,
it was upon the truth of his representations of to-day that they had to
decide ; and he would therefore give no opinion of his own upon the
point.
The learned Judge then read the evidence given on the part of the
defe::cc in support of the mild a:d humane temper of the prisoner. On
closing the evidence as to character, he observed, that he had only one
remark to make upon it; and that was, that, in opposition to direct
evid nce as to facts, it was of no avail; it was only when the balance
of evidence was equal that it proved of service to the accused. He would
not trouble them with many further observations upon
this
case, because
he was sure that their own good sense, after the patient attention which
they had paid to the evidence, would furnish them with all the observa-
tions that wer: necessary. A complaint, however, had been made with
respect to the conduct of the Coroner, which it was necessary to notice.
He was of opinion, that when the depositions, taken before the Coroner,
were read over by the Coroner to the prisoner after the Inquest, the pri-
soner had received all the advantage to which he was entitled as a matter
of right. The object of the Coroner's Inquest was not to charge any
person with the murder ; its object was to ascertain how the death had
happened. The Inquest was conducted by the Crown, as the guardian of
the lives of all the subjects of the country, and, strictly speaking, a person
accused had no right to be present at it. If a man were found guilty of
murder on the Coroner's Inquest, it would be hard if he were not allowed
to know the evidence on which he was declared to be so; but when that
evidence was communicated to him, he had no right to complain. Now
it appeared from the evidence of Lea, that in this particular ca e the
depositins had been read over to the prisoner Corder by the Coron: T.
The prisoner had, therefore, all the information necessary for him to shape
his defence on this trial, so as to meet the evidence to be produced
against him. It was, he believed, usual at Coroners' Inquests to allow
she parties likely to be implicated by them to be present, if they de-
sired it; but not, he repeated, as a matter of right. The real question
for their decision in this case was this,-" Are the representations made
this day by the prisoner true or false ?" If the Jury should be of
opinion that they were true, then the prisoner was entitled to an ac-
quittal. His representation was, that the deceased had shot herself with
his pistols, which she had got into her possession; and the evidence
showed that they were, on one occasion, in her possession at Sudbury,

but there was no evidence to show that she had continued in senarate
possession of the pistols, but much to show that she had not. Thie
fracomer wished to have it supposed that she had carried these
pistols in her pocket to the Red Barn. Now, the prisoner had
seen the mother and sister of Maria Marten, in the witness-box,
and he might have cross-examined them upon that point. But
20 one question had been put to them to show that Maria Marten
had those pistols previously to leaving her father's cottage. So
far as they had any evidence at all respecting the pistols, they appeared to
nave been in the prisoner's possession, and not in hersfor he had
been seen snapping them before the fire. What had struck him from
the beginning of the defence to the end, as the most extraordinary fea-
ture in it, was the manner in which this alleged suicide was committed
often happened that these poor girls, when disappointed in their
expectations, did lay rash hands on themselves; but then the mode of
their death was in general very simple. In this case, if they were
.0 credit the evidence of the surgeons, the wounds inflicted on the hody
of Maria Marten were of a double description. They were, first, the
wounds in the eye, and in the cheek, by a ball; and then the wounds
inflicted with a sharp instrument that was broader on one side than the
other, on the heart and ribs ; and the wound inflicted with a similar in-
strument on the vertebr of the neck behind the skull. It was extra-
ordinary that, instead of hanging herself upon a tree, as poor girls
usually did in such circumstances, she should have used two different
means to kill herselfthe one by shooting herself with a pistol,- which
was a very unusual weapon for a woman to kill herself with, and the
other by stabbing herself with a sharp instrument. The Jury must
decide on the credibility of the medical witnesses, who ventured to
speak as to these two distinct causes of Maria Marten's death, inde-
pendently of the third mode of death by strangulation, to which one or
them had spoken ; and then, if they uecided that the wounds had been
intlicted in the manner in whieh the surgeons described, they must decide
how far it was possible that such multifarious wounds were inflicted
by herself. These were the facts of the case as proved in evidence ;
and he trusted in God that they would lead them to a proper decision
upon it. If they had any doubt upon it, they would give the prisoner the
benefit of it; but if they were satisfied that his representations were false,
and that the crime of murder on Maria Marten had been committed by
him, then it would be their duty, serving their country manfully, and dis-
charging faithfully the solemn oath which they had sworn, to bring in a
verdict of guilty against the prisoner, regardless of the consequences by
which it might be followed.
The Foreman of the Jury then addressed the Court on behalf of lois
fellow-jurors, and said that they wished to retire, as the case required
some time to be spent in deliberation upon it.
The Lord Chief Baron immediately ordered a bailiff to be sworn to
attend them, and at twenty-n
-ove minutes to iwo the Jury retired.
At ten minutes past two they came back into Court, and their Fore
man returned a verdict of Guilly against the prisoner.
At this moment, and in the short interval which elapsed between
de declaration of the verdict and the declaration of the sentence
of the Court, a slight confusion arose before the bar where the
prisoner was standing, relative to the possession of the ristnia 1 whol

the murder was committed: Lea, the officer, claimed them as his pro
perty, in consequence of a promise which he had received from the prisoner
when he first apprehended him; Mr. Orridge claimed them as the pro-
perty of the Sheriff, in consequence of the verdict which had just been
recorded against the prisoner. Mr. Orridge remained in possession of
them, as the contest was stopped by the Crier's proclaiming silence, as
the Lord Chief Baron was going to pass sentence on the prisoner.
The prisoner was then asked, in the usual form, whether he had to
say anything why he should not die according to law. Op his saying
nothing,
The Lord Chief Baron addressed him in the following terms :-
"William Corder, it is now my painful duty to announce to you the near
approach of the close of your mortal career. You have been accused of
murder, which is almost the highest offence that can be found in the whole
of the long catalogue of crime: You denied your guilt, and put yourself
on your deliverance to the country. After a long, a patient, and an im-
partial trial, the country has decided against you, and most justly. You
stand convicted of an aggravated breach of the great prohibition of the
Almighty Creator of mankind, " Thou shalt do no murder." The law of
this country, in coneurrence with the law of all civilized countries, enforces
this prohibition of God, by exacting from the criminal who has violated
it; the forfeiture of his own life. And as this offence indicates the highest
degree of cruelty to its unfortunate victim, and as it is dangerous to the
peace, the order, and the security of society, justice assumes upon it her
severest aspect, and allows no emotion of pity to shield the criminal from
the punishment awarded to it both by the laws of God and by the laws of
I advise you not to fatter yourself with any hopes of mercy upon
earth. You sent this unfortunate woman to her account without giving
her any time for preparation : she had no time to turn her eyes to the
Throne of Grace for mercy and forgiveness. She had no time given her
to repent of her many transgressions: she had no time to throw herself
on her knees and to implore for pardon at the Eternal Throne. The
same measure is not meted out to you ; a small interval is allowed you for
preparation. Use it well; for the scene of this world eloses upon you ;
but another, and, I hope, a better world is opening for you. Remember
the lessons of religion which you received in the early years of your child-
sood : consider the effects that may be produced by a sincere repentance :
listen to the advice of the ministers of your religion, who will, I trust,
console and advise you how best to meet the sharp ordeal which you must
presently undergo. Nothing remains for me now to do, but to pass upon
vou the awful sentence of the law. That sentence is, that you be taken
back to the prison from which you came, and that you be taken thence, or
Monday next, to the place of execution, and there be hanged by the
neck till you are dead, and that your body shall afterwards be dissected
and anatomized, and the Lord God Almighty have mercy on your soul !"
The Lord Chief Baron, who was evidently much affected, then re-
tired froin the Court.

Demeanour of the Prisoner during the Summing up of the Learned
Judge, and the Sentence.
To prevent breaking too much in upon the uniformity of our narra-
tive, we have deemed it right to subjoin to the trial itself an account of
his behaviour during the latter part of it.
The prisoner paid the most eager attention to the earlier part of the
summing up, in which his Lordship stated the indictment, and the neces-
sity the law has imposed, of proving, to the satisfaction of the Jury, that
the death of the person has been occasioned by one of the means laid in
the indictment: but when the Chief Baron told the Jury that if they were
satisfied that the death arose from any one, two, or more of the wounds
inflicted on the body, and that those wounds were inflicted by the pri-
soner, they should find him guilty, his countenance fell, and he was appa-
rently for some time in a state of stupor. He repeatedly bowed during
the time the Judge besought the Jury to forget all the rumours and
reports they had heard, and not to allow themselves to be influenced by
the atrocious fact, if true, of a clergyman having preached to 5000
per-
sons in the immediate neighbourhood of the scene, a sermon, in which
the prisoner was treated as the murderer. The Chief Baron's observa-
tions respecting the probable motive of the prisoner in enticivg the
deceased from her mother's house under the false statement that the
constable had a warrant against her for a bastard child, made the
strongest impression on the prisoner, whose countenance underwent
several changes during the time. At one period, during the statement of
the extraordinary conversation of Corder with Mrs. Stowe, as to the
number of children Maria had, her having brought forth her fated
number, and his observation that " she was where he could go any day
or hour he pleased, and that when he was not present with her nobody
else was," the prisoner appeared almost in a fainting state; a transient
paleness was visible in his countenance, his eyes rolled rapidly in their
sockets, he heaved very deep sighs, and laid his head on the bar against
which he had been previously leaning. In a few minutes, however, he
recovered his self-possession, and resumed his former position, which
was, leaning against the upright post, placing both hands on the spiked
boarding before him, and fixing his eyes on the ground, raising them only
when the Judge made remarks on the evidence. The mention of the
letters seemed to agitate him considerably, and he sighed heavily; but
the feeling quickly passed away, and he seemed to be relieved greatly by
the learned Judge not reading them. He was also much agitated when
the evidence of Lea was read, as to his denying all knowledge of such a
person as Maria Marten; and the remarks of the Chief Baron that he did
not, at once, on being told that her body was found in his barn, acknow-
ledge that he knew her, and that she had destroyed herself, and been
buried there, instead of denying any knowledge of her, caused a momen-
tary faintness and swimming of his eyes. He again recovered himself
but almost immediately on the allusion to his getting the sword sharp
ened, he was near falling, but was upheld by the gaoler. He, however
from this time, evidently grew gradually weaker and less composed.
During the reading of the important evidence of the surgeons, he movea
uneasily from side to side, seemingly unable to maintain liis self-pos-
session without continual change of position. He more than once
drank some cold water, which was given to him by the gaoler

the evidence of the surgeons of the various wounds found on the
person of the deceased, and large drops of perspiration started from
his forehead. The next remarkable change the prisoner underwent
was, to a state of stupor, which continued for some length of time,-his
eyes remaining perfectly fixed and immoveable and his arms crossed.
After remaining some time in this state, he again laid his left cheek on
the post, and appeared to be fainting. Recovering from this syncope,
he laid his head upon his hands, and seemed dreadfully agitated for
some minutes; but from the beginning of the last surgeon's evidence to
its conclusion, he scarcely continued a minute in any one position,
perpetually shifting from side to side, his head generally lying either
very much on one side, or on his breast. From first to last, however,
it was observed that he never shed a tear ; but this may of course be
attributed to his anxious attention to the investigation. One of the
witnesses called by the prisoner, Mrs. Havers, a very pretty young
woman, was frequently in tears during the detail of the evidence. He
seemed to think the learned Judge would dwell at length upon his
defence, and prepared himself, by a vigorous effort, to attend to the
remarks he expected to hear on the subject. When, however, the
Chief Baron passed over his story by a bare statement of its principal
points, and made not a single remark on it, but proceeded to read the
evidence of his own witnesses, he relapsed into his former state of
stupor and faintness, and so continued to the end of the charge. On
the Jury retiring to consider of his fate, he sat down on the bar in the
dock, and leant his head against the beam on which he had previously
rested his back. As each of the Jurymen passed him, he cast upon
them a piercing glance of the most intense interest. During the time
of their absence, nothing could be more disconsolate and desponding
than his appearance. On the Jury returning into Court, he once more
resumed his standing position. On hearing the Foreman pronounce the
fatal word " Guilty," he raised his hand slowly to his forehead, pressed
it for a moment, and then dropped it most dejectedly. His head imme-
diately afterwards fell drooping upon his bosom. During the passing
of the sentence bis firmness still continued in some degree, but at the
close of it, he would have sunk to the ground, had he not been prevented
by the compassionate attention of the Governor of the gaol. He then
sobbed loudly and convulsively for some moments, and was almost
carried out of Court by Mr. Orridge and one of his attendants Indied,
it was evident to all, that at this moment his faculties, both mental and
bodily, were completely paralyzed. It was said, that immediately
after he quitted the dock, he fainted away; but we were given to
understand that this was not the case. Shortly afterwards he was seen
in the lock-up near to the Court, with his head buried in his hands,
which rested on his knees, and labouring under severe mental emotions
After the Court was cleared, he was removed to the county gaol.
The culprit, on his reinoval from Court, made a great effort to rally,
even after the palpable extinction of his self-possession at the breaking
up of the Court: so much so, indeed, that even some of those about his
person imagined his emotion had been assumed, for the purpose of
exciting a sympathy from superficial observers, which even he, degraded
as he was, must have known would be denied to him by every well-
constituted mind. It is even said that some unfortunate females of his
family had been so deluded by representations similar to the pitiful fiction
of his defence, that they were even preparing for his return to that decent

conditior. of society, which he had with such unparalleled atrocity dis
grared and dishonoured by the flagrant violation of all those household
duties which reflect a peculiar character upon the middle classes of
society in this country. But the attempts to sustain this mere physical
insensibility, evidently required a forced excitement; he jumbled himself
into the cart on his return from the Court to the prison, which is halt a
mile distant, more like a man who wanted to escape from the public
gaze, than to invite its attention by any assumption of bravado. The
crowd, who in their eagerness to catch a glimpse at every character,
notorious for good or bad, oppose every obstacle which impcdes the
gratification of this curiosity, had broken the steps of the cart, in their
efforts to get a close peep at the criminal, so that when he returned to
the gaol, he had either to jump to the ground, or be assisted in his
descent. He preferred the former, and alighted upon his legs on the
threshold of the prison, with some appearance, at least, of renewed alacrity.
He had returned, however, to the gaol in a different character from that
in which he had left it. All the presumptions and reservations which
the humane policy of our law sometimes throw around a prisoner whose
life is at stake were removed, and he had yesterday evening to re-enter
the wall of his prison, for the few hours which were counted to him in
this world, as a persun who was no longer to be mentioned among his
species, and whose annihilation was doomed by the common injunction
of every civilized community. This retributive change of circumstances
rem'wed him from a convenient apartment in the front of the prison, to a
cell in the rear, and exchanged a dress of fashionable attire for the com-
mon gaol apparel. The Governor of the prison led him, upon his return
as a condemned criminal, into his private apartment, where he plainly,
but mildly, informed the prisoner be must now exchange the whole of
his apparel, because his (the Governor's) situation with reference to him
had now become one of great responsibility, and he had a serious dut
to discharge, which be was, however, ready to perform with every attention
to the rational wants of a prisoner in his awful situation. Corder imme-
diately exchanged his clothes for those which were supplied to him from
the prison stock, having previously given to his solicitor, from his pocket,
his written defence, and some other papers. His penknife the Governor
took charge of, and a gentleman present remarked to Ccrder, that the
evidence against him was too conclusive to be parried by any external
appearances of evasion, and that it was due to his family and society to
deliver his mind of the facts. To this provident suggestion the criminal
gave no reply, and the only desire he expressed was to be allowed the
society of his wife, who has been for a short time in lodgings in the
town. The Governor repeated to him that he should have every conso-
lation which his situation and the rules of the prison permitted; but that
henceforth he could see nobody except in his presence, or that of one ou
his officers, and that his own clothes should be at his disposal in exchange
for those which he was at present under the necessity of substituting for
tl:em, on the day when he was to be brought out to die. At four o'clock
Cordler received some dinner from the Governor's table, and a clergyman
was sent for to afford him the solace (should he prove susceptible of it)
of spiritual consolation.
His mother and sister were said to be in the immediate neighbournood
of the town, anxiously awaiting the result of the trial; and his wife was,
as we have already said, on the spot, under the expectation, as it was

publicly said, of his deliverance, to which, in pity for the feelings
others, it is no longer seasonable more particularly to allude.
When some allusion was made to the impropriety of allowing him
to retain his penknife (which, however, the Governor took from him
on Thursday), he said that there was no danger to be apprehended in that
respect, for he had no desire to add one sin to another. This was the
only tendency towards anything like confession which the prisoner dis-
closed on the preceding day. Two inmates of the prison, who are re-
presented as being of serious and prudent characters, were to remain in
Corder's cell until the time of his execution. A passage was made
through the wall immediately adjoining the cell, to the open paddock
behind the gaol for his execution.
Bury, Saturday Evening, 8 o'clock.
Corder is confined in a room on the South side of the prison, and he
is rather loquacious than otherwise. Mr. (). sat with him until half
past 10 o'clock on Friday night, and he was very communicative: he
observed that there was some part of the evidence incorrect ;'he parti-
cularly alluded to the boy (George Marten) who saw him come from
the Barn with the pickaxe on his shoulder. He observed that he could
not see him. Mr. 0,, in reply, said that he could not know of it; for
it might happen that a person might see him whom he could not see.
He said that was true; but did not deny having the pickaxe on his
shoulder. Mr. Q. asked how it came to be in the Barn? He said he
could not tell.
In allusion to the sword, Mr. O. inquired whether he had ever been
in the Navy? He replied, that he never intended to make the sea bis
profession: he got the sword for another purpose. Mr. O. inquired
what could induce him to say that there was a warrant against Maria
for bastardy, when, under that impression, he induced her to change
her attire, and accompany her to the Red Barn? To this he made uo
reply; but hung down his head. He again reverted to his Trial, and
said that the evidence was incorrect, for Maria had DIED SUDDENLY. Mr.
0. observed, that it was now useless for him to be talking about it, as it
would only tend to agitate him, and could not be remedied, but recom-
mended him to attend to his spiritual adviser, who, no doubt, would
give him such advice as would direct him to disclose that, which would
be for his benefit in his translation from this world to another. Ms.
Orridge wished him good night, and left him ; shortly after which, he
stripped himself quite leisurely, went to bed, and was sleep before 11
o'clock. He slept most soundly until 4 o'clock, when he was awaked
by one of his attendants stirring the fire. He again went to sleep, and
continued so until 6 o'clock in the morning, when he was visited by the
Rev. Mr. Stocking, the Chaplain, who remained with him until 8 o'clock
He was very talkative with his attendants, and observed to them,
What
way
could it contribute to the salvation of my soul to be telling
my
follies to the world ?" The attendant replied, that it was not neces-
sary for him to make a long confession, but to say that justice had been
done him. Corder said, " Oh, the disgrace which I bring on my
family!" The following copversation occurred between him and one
of his attendants:

Attendant.-Pray Mr. Corder, is it true, that by an
you were first introduced to Mrs. Corder?
Corder.-Indeed it is.
Attendant.Had you many answers to it?
Corder.-I had forty-five; some from Ladies in their carriage.
Attendant.-Well, that surprises me.
Corder.Surprise you; so it may, as it did myself, but I missed
of a good thing
Attendant.--How is that?'
Corder.Why then, I will tell you. In one of the answers which I
received, it requested that I should be at a certain church, on an
appointed day, dressed in a particular way; and, both understanding
what we came about, no further introduction was necessary.
Attendant.-But how could you know, for there might be another
lady dressed in the same way?.
Corder:-Oh! to guard against a mistake, she desired that I should
wear a black handkerchief round my neck, and have
my
left arm in a
sling; and in case I should not observe her, she would introduce her-
self.
Attendant.And did you meet her ?
Corder.No, I did not; I went, but not in time, as the service was
over when I got there.
Attendant.--Then, when
you
did not meet her, how could
you
know
that she was respectable ?
Pue lo von
Corder. Because the pew-opener told me, that such a Lady was
inquiring for a gentleman of my description, and she came in an
elegant carriage, and was a young woman
of fortune (sighing
heavily).
Attendant.Then you saw hier afterwards ?
Corder. No, never; but I found out where she lived, and who sho
was, and would have had an interview, were it not that I was intro-
duced to Mrs. Corder; and we never parted until we were married.
Attendant.-Was that long ?
Corder.About a week.
This is a part of the numerous conversations he held with his at-
tendants. His spirits seem to be volatile ; at one time he appears to
forget his situation, and commences a conversation ill suited to it.
In conformity with his promise, Mr. Orridge, in the afternoon, in-
troduced Mrs. Corder to her wretched husband. She arrived at the
prison at ten minutes to two o'clock, and was accompanied by a Mrs.
Atherstone, an old school-fellow, who has humanely been sleeping with
her since she came to Bury.
Mrs. A. remained in the Governor's office, while her afflicted friend,
attended by Mr. Orridge, proceeded to the heart-breaking interview.
She brought with her, for her wretched partner's perusal, a religious
essay"The Companion to the Altar," the contents of which she
earnestly recommended to his reflection, prior to his partaking of the
holy sacrament.
On entering the cell, she threw herself, in an agony, in his arms; and
bursting into tears, exclaimed, " Well, my dear William, this trial has
terminated far differently from what we all had most earnestly expected."
Corder was deeply and seriously affected at the visit, and passionately
expressed his gratitude for her attachment to him, "

report and evil report," and even to a violont an ignominious death,

son.
For a time he was deprived of utterance; and on regaining a portion of
his habitual fortitude and recollection, he expressed his anxiety for her
future welfare, and his fears of the contumely she would experience in lite.
She entreated him to let no apprehension on her account disturb his
mind, or distract his attention from a reflection on spiritual affairs.
She had no personal fears for the future; " For, oh !" she said, " Wil-
liam, there is a good and merciful God, who will protect me; and to
Him I look for support." She next implored of bim to dismiss from
his memory all recollection of temporal concerns, and to reflect and
prepare himself for the awful account he would be so soon called upon
to deliver up. The interview lasted until half past two o'clock; and,
as we have understood, is calculated to arouse Corder's dormant feelings
(if he has any), and lead to his repentance. Mr. Orridge was present
while it continued ; and, at its close, he delicately intimated to the
prisoner, and his ill-fated wife, that they would again be permitted to
see each other on Sunday at 11 o'clock, but that they must consider it
as their final interview in this life.
Mrs. Corder and Mrs. Atherstone walked both to and from the pri-
The former had a care-worn look, and a most dejected appear-
ance, but yet, considering the situation she is so unhappily placed in,
preserved a greater degree of self-possession than could turally have
been expected. Her dress was plain and unassuming: over a white
gown she wore a brown silk Levantine pelisse, a straw bonnet, black veil,
which was drawn incl

over her face, and completely concealed her
countenance, and on her shoulders was thrown a blue colonial invitation
Cashmere shawl, with a variegated border. Her friend, Mrs. Ather-
stone's, attire was equally unpretending; and while waiting in the Go-
vernor's office, she wept most bitterly. One of the most earnest of
the applicants was a Mr. Moore, at whose lectures he had been for
merly in the habit of attending. Mr. 0. informed him of the request
that had been made, actuated by the idea that perhaps he might desire
the spiritual assistance of a person with who.. he had been
hitherto acquainted. Corder, however, expressed a repugnance to
the visit, and accompanied his refusal with the observation, that
anxious to preserve his wind undisturbed, during the
remnant of his existence, and that seeing strange faces would
only unhinge bim, and that he was quite satisfied with the religious
instruction supplied to him by the Reverend Chaplain. In every request,
Mr. Orridge has consequently proved inaccessible; and did he not
consult the feelings of the prisoner, an Act of Parliament that has
lately passed, and which came into operation on the 27th of June,
would preclude his gratifying puritanical curiosity; or, indeed, admit.
ting any one to an interview with a criminal under sentence of death
for a murderous offence, unless authorised by the order of the Sheriff
or Judge. The Act is that of the 9th Geo. IV. cap. 31; and, among
other things,
" It is enacted, that every person, convicted of murder,
shall, after judgment, be confined in some safe place, within the
prison, apart from all other prisoners; and shall be fed with bread
and water only, and with no other tood or liquor; and, that no
person but the Gaoler and his servants, or the Chaplain, shall have
any access to any such convict, without the permission in writing, of
the Judge, the Sheriff, or his Deputy."
The preparations for the Execution are nearly completed.

APPENDIX.
Bury, Sunday Morning, Eight  Clock.
ABOUT eight o'clock last evening Corder's mental exhaustioni overcame his phy.
sical strength, and he dropped into a calm and undisturbed sleep, which lasted till
three o'clock this morning. We understand, that though he now appears greatly
dismayed at the approaching close of bis mortal career, he never from the first
expected any other termination to this trial. On hearing that his friends, some of
whom are very opulent and respectable persons, were willing to make large pecuniary
sacrifices to ensure him the benefit of all the assistance which could be derived from the
talent and ingenuity of the most able and experienced advocates at the Bar, be wrote
a letter to them, returning them thanks for their kindness, but at the same time
declaring, that the evideni e which had been taken at the Inquest would appear, to all
persons who were unacq painted with the real nature of the transaction, so strong
against him, that it would answer no useful purpose to expend their money in his
behalf. He also stated that he had made up his mind to meet with courage and forti-
tude the fatal destiny which had befallen many other individuals wbo were as innocent
as himself. It appears, from the event, 'hat he has miscalculated his own strength of
nerve; for, from all the accounts that I have been able to collect, it is quite clear
that the elasticity of his spirit is entirely destroyed, and that be labours under the most
poignant distress of mind.
i bas been stated, Viat the defence to which he resorted was, even in the desperate
circunstances of his case, one of the most injudicious that could possibly have been
attempted. After adnitting the identity of the body discovered in the Barn with that
of Maria Marten, the only point of difficulty was removed from the decision of the
Jury. An acute analysis of the evidence might, perhaps, have enabled an ingenious
man to suggest doubts as to the identity of the body, arising out of the state of decom-
position at which not only the body, but also the articles of dress found upon it, had
arrived. But this line of defence was probably abandoned, on account of the difficulty
which the prisoner would bave experienced in explaining the letters which he had
written relative to the existence of Maria Marten after her disappearance from Pol.
stead. Still, to support the indictment, it would have been necessary to show that
the body found was the body of Maria Marten; and, however much appearances migbt
on other points have been against him, it would have been impossible for any Jury the
have recorded a verdict of guilty against him, until they were convinced of the iden.
tity of the body with that of the person alleged to be murdered.
Since bis conviction, various questions have been put to Corder on different parts
of the evidence. Mr. Orridge asked him how he got over that part of the evidenca
in which it was sworn that he had informed Maria Marten that Baalham, the con-
stable, had told him that Mr. Whitmore had got a warrant to have ber apprehended
on account of her bastard cbildren, when it appeared from Baalham's testimony that
he had inade no such statement? To this question he gave no answer, but hung back,
cast a sharp and expressive look on the questioner, and assumed, as he does upon all
questions which displease him, an aspect of considerable ferocity. He was asked by
one of his attendants how he could muster nerve enough to stay alone with thecorpse
in the Barn whilst he was digging a grave for it? and his answer to this question
appears very material; for it was given in the shape of another question, and was to
this effect:--"How d'ye know that such was the case?" On another occasion, he
was asked to confess the justice of his sentence; and his reply was curious. " The
sermons," he said, " which have been put into my hands since I came into this
place, have convinced me that all confession which it is necessary for me to make, is
a confession to my God of the transgressions of my life: confession to man can be
of no good to my soul; I do not like, and I will not make it, as it savours strongly of
Popedom." To another person he said, " Why should I disgrace my family by con-
essing all the follies and transgressions of my youth ? they are, indeed, manifold ; the

confession would hurt their feelings, and would do me no good." It is, however,
expected by those who are best acquainted with him, that though he has not yet made,
he still will make, it conlession of bis guilt before bis execution, if not in detail, at
least shortly in point of fact.
In the hurry of sending off the report of the trial, we forgot to mention that when
Lea, the police-officer, rus under examination, ('order stamped violently on the
floor of the dock, and expressed considerable indignation at the testimony which be
was giving. Mr. Orridge, on returning from the Court with the prisoner, asked him
what part of Lea's evidence had so strongly excited bis feelings. Corder replied that
Lea had sworn falsely in saying that he had made him a present of the two pistols
which he (Lea) had found in the reticule in his (Corder's) house. Mr. Orridge said,
that perhaps, in the hurry and agitation of his feelings, he bad unconsciously made
such a promise. Corder replied, that it was possible be might have done so; but be
did not think it probable. He has repeated this declaration since his conviction, and
pledges the faith of a dying man to its correctness.
An idle story has got about this place, that Corder was at one time a Methodist
parson, and had actually preached a sermon at Polstead. The circumstance has been
mentioned to bim, and he gave it an unqualified contradiction. He says that he did
for some time attend a Methodist chapel, because a young girl whom he admired re-
quented it, but that he had always been too dissolute and depraved to turn his mind
to religious pursuits.
You will bare heard from another quarter that Mrs. Corder received in a feeling man-
mer the distressing intelligence of her busband's conviction, and kindly endeavoured to
arm him against his fate. Another anecdote places in a strong light the propriety of
her moral principles. On the first interview that she had with her husband after bis con-
viction, Mr. Orridge felt himself compelled, in consequence of a new clause inserted
in Lord Lansdown's Act, to inform ber that he must be present during the whole
time of its continuance, lest she should furnish her husband with some means by
which he might effect his own destruction. Mrs. Corder said, "If it pleased God to
take him to himself before the time appointed for his execution, I should be most
happy; but I would not interfere between bis God and him for any consideration. I
would let him meet his fate with submission, rather than afford him any means by
which he might anticipate it.". The meeting between them is described as having
buen of the most tender and affecting nature.
The fate of his aged and widowed mother is deplorable, and entitles her to the
sympathy of every humane and benevolent bosom. She has within a very short pe-
riod been berelt, by the ordinary course of nature, of three sons; the only son wbom
she has left is now to be wrenched from her by the exterminating grasp of public
justice. Can any one bave a greater right to refuse to be comforted ?
Half-past Eleven o'clock, Sunday Murring.
The Conden ned Sermon was delivered in the chapel attached to the gaol, by the
Chaplain, the Rev. W. Stocking. Besides the inmutes of the gaol, there were about
twenty persons present. After the debtors, confined in the county gaol, had taken
their seats, the different elons, who bave been tried at the late Assizes, were ad-
mitted to theirs. The latter were dressed in a coat and trousers of gray frieze,
striped at intervals with two bars of black, enclosing a broader stripe of yellow,
which is the costume of this prison. After the Chaplain had taken his station in
the pulpit, Corder was led into the barred cell reserved for culprits under sentence of
death, by Mr. Orridge and one of his attendants. He wept bitterly as he came
along the passage ; but buried his face in bis bandkerchief, as if anxious to with-
draw himself from the gaze of the curious. His step was anything but firm; and he
bad evidently lost, beyond the power of recall, a great part of that self-command
wbich he exhibited at the commencement of the trial. As soon as he was locked in
the pew appointed for him, be heaved a deep sigh, sat himself down on one of the
benches, and leaned against the side of the pew: he then raised his foot on the bench
before him, rested his elbow on his knee, and his face, which be covered with a wbite
handkerchief, on his hand; and remained in that position during the greater part of
the service. The Rev. Gentleman then read an excellent occasional prayer for
persons in Corder's deplorable situation : he appeared much moved by it; and be-
trayed great agitation, when the Rev. Gentleman bade bis congregation to retlect,
that but for the mediating blood of Christ they might have been shut up in hell in-
stead of in that prison. In that part of the service of the day, in wbich the clergy-
man prays that the rest of our lives may be pure and holy, Corder's emotion was
excessive, owing, perhaps, to its exciting the painful reflection, that the rest of his
Vill was already numbered. Tbe Psalms which were selected for the occasion were
## p. 683 (#719) ############################################
THE RED BARN.
683
the 51st and the 130th. In that part of the 51st Psalm in which the inspired writer
implores God to deliver him from blood-guiltiness, Corder sighed deeply, and sbowed,
by the uplited notion of his hands, that he joined cordially in the prayer. These
two Psalms, which are very affecting, produced no other display of feeling from the
prisoner-so deep and even stupifying was the grief by which he was overwhelmed.
The first lesson read was the usual lesson for the day ; the second was selected with
reference to the prisoner's situation, and was that part of the 16th chapter of St.
Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, which the Church of England, from admira-
tion of its deep and affecting sublimity, bas incorporated into the burial service. The
30th verse, " Why stand we in jeopardy every bour ?" affected him greatly ; but I
was surprised that he betrayed no feeling at that verse in wbich it is declared that th
sting of death is sin; nor at that in which it is also declared tbat death is now swal-
lowed up in victory. At the commencement of the Litany he sighed deeply, and
evidently joined in heart, though not in word, with the supplication to the Trinity
to bave mercy upon all miserable sinners. On coming to that clause in the Litany,
in which the preacher prays that God will show his pity upon all prisoners and cap-
tives, and especially on bim who is now awaiting the execution of bis sentence, he
let his head fall against the wall with a heart-rending sigh.
At the close of the Litany, the clergyman introduced a prayer for Corder, which
affected him so much that he cried audibly. In the closing paragraph of it, in
which God was implored to enable so heinous a sinner to cast himself wholly on his
Redeemer, and, through the merits of his passion and death, to relieve himself from
: the pressure of his sins, he groaned aloud, and half whispered " Amen." This
prayer appeared to make a greater impression upon him than any other portion of the
service of the day. He changed his position repeatedly, but never abstained from
keeping his handkerchief in front of his face. It was the only tiine in which he
joined in the responses, though many of them were most suitable to his desperate
condition. Part of the Gospel of the day struck me as peculiarly appropriate to his
condition; but during the reading of it, and also during the reading of a great portion
of the previous part of the Communion Service, he appeared involved in a sort of
stupor. To the Sermon he paid considerable attention. It was taken from the 41st
verse of the 23d chapter of St. Luke, and was in these words :-"And we indeed
justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath not done amiss."
The reverend preacher said, that these were the words of the malefactor who was
crucified with Jesus, and who, in consequence of his belief in the divine character
of our Saviour, received from him a promise that he should be entitled with him to
the joys of Paradise. He pointed out the bappy result which the words of the text
had produced to the person who uttered them, and said, that he should take occasion
from them to point out the state of mind which a malefactor, appointed to die,
ought to strive with all his soul to attain.
The external demeanour of a persan so circumstanced should be such as not to
give offence to those who should watch his actions at the time of his death ; for the
damage he might then do was irreparable, and he never could have any opportunity.
to repair it by repentance. He ought to endeavour so to conduct himself at the
close of his existence, as to edify and improve by his death those who could have
received nothing but evil example from his lie. A death on the scaffold excited
great attention on the part of the spectators; and whatever was then said or, done
by the malefactor doomed to die, made an impression on their memories, which
rendered it incumbent on him to say or do nothing which could weaken the respect
due from us all to that God at whose tribunal he was going to appear. The inward
demeanour of the prisoner was that, however, to which he ought to pay the greatest
concern. He should endeavour to make his peace with God, and should repent
of bis sins with a repentance not to be repented of. As he could not expect to bring
forward in his life fruits meet for repentance, it was incumbent upon him to reiterate
his prayer for a change of mind, till he became certain it was accepted. He should bow
with submission to the will of God, and throw off that reluctance which too often prevent-
ed individuals from owning the justice of the senteuce with which God visited them.
He should be sensible that nothing was more suitable to his past transgressious than the
ignominious death which he was going to suffer. The ignominy of it would exist
but for a short time, and the pain of it to the mortal body for only a few minutes.
The dark way through which he would bave to travel to eternity, should be that
which troubled him with the greatest alarm. He should prepare himself, therefore,
for that awful occasion, when the dead in Christ should rise again, and when the
great judgment of the Lord should pronounce absolution on the godly, and condem-
nation on the wicked. He pointed out the distressing situation of those to whom
God should say"Depart from me, ye wicked, into everlasting fire," -There Corder
was yiolently affected, and subbed convulsively|--and asked with great enthusiusur.

what would not the wicked give for pre hour at that time to make their
peace with their offended Creator ? Then it would be too late to implore
bis mercytheir eternal state would be concluded on--and the certainty that
there would be no cbange in it would aggravate the intensity of their suffer.
ings.-[Here Corder's emotion was truly distressing-he moved about in his
seat in great mental anguish. ]-It might be that there were some persons
present, who, like the Pharisee, might thank God that they were not murder-
ers, like the unfortunate man who was now doomed to die: let those who made
such comparisons beware,they were odious to God, and dangerous to themselves
Let them guard against such boastings,--for they proclaimed them to be guiltier than
they themselves imagined. They might have strictly adhered to all the laws of the
land; but the laws of the land were not the criterion of a Christian's duty; and
those who made them so, acted more cunningly than wisely for their own spiritual
interests. To wish the death of an individual was often as full of guilt as to inflict
it. Let those, therefore, who thought that they stood, take care lest they fell;
and let them take warning from the death which was now impending over their
fellow prisoner, and endeavour not to do likewise, lest a worse fate should hereafter
befal them.
The close of this Sermon, of which we have given a very faint and imperfect
sketch, was the close of the service for the day. Corder was led out by Mr.
Orridge in almost a fainting condition. As soon as he reached his cell, he staggered
to his bed, on wbich he flung himself, sobbing convulsively for many minutes. in
passing the pew in which we were seated, he dropped his handkerchief from his
face, and nothing could be more altered than the cast of his countenance since we
saw him on Friday last. His cheeks bad collapsed, his eyes were swollen greatly
and his whole appearance was most ghastly. He looked the picture of despair.
CONDUCT, CONFESSION, AND EXECUTION OF CORDER.
Bury St. Edmund's, Monday Morning.
Mrs. Corder bad an interview with her husband yesterday. It lasted from ball-past
twelve to two o'clock, and was, to a spectator, infinitely distressing. Mr. Orridge,
who was present, and who is not unaccustomed to suca scenes, was much affected by
it. The particulars of it bave not yet transpired; but it is understood that Corder
particularly requested bis wie not to marry again, or, at least, if she did, not to ob-
uin a husband as she bad obtained bim, by means of an advertisement; for it was, of
all modes of getting a busband, the most dangerous and imprudent. It is, perbaps,
right to add, that one of the first questions wbich Corder asked his wife, on seeing
ber led into his cell by Mr. Orri ge, had reference to the advertisement by wbich he
guined her. Mr. Orridge appeared to have some doubt whether Corder bad received
so many answers as he said to his advertisement, and, in order to remove them,
Corder asked ber bow many letieis sbe bad herself seen? She replied, immediately,
forty-five.
On lerving ber busband's cell, Mrs. Corder was quite overcome by the violence of
ber leel nas. She fainted away several times, and was with difficulty recovered by the
res!oratives administered to her by Mr. Orridge, who sincerely commiserated her sule
ferings. She was not able to walk to ibe gik which was waiting to convey her to
ber lodgings, but was carried into it by her friend Mrs. Atherion and one of the
pr.son ittendan's. Corder, on ber quitting him, said that tbe biiterness of death was
nuw over; and bas been heard to express a wish that there was a less interval to the
lime of bis execution. Ile likewise says that he found, in Mrs. Corder, one of the
most tender, fuithful, and affectionate of wives.
In the course of yesterd is evening, Mr. Orridge addressed a paper to the prisoner,
impressing upon bim the dii s of making a con!ession of his guilt, of which he said
few people now entertained a doubt. The unfortunate prisoner said that he did not
see any reason why he should make it. Mr. Orridge then reminded him, that in bis
deence he bad imputed to Maria Mirten the commission of suicide ; and if he leit
the world without contradicting that statement, he would be tainting ber memory
with ibe imputation o! u dreadful crime. This argument appeared to make a deep
impression on bis mind, especially as it was strengthened by reference to the first
duty of man"lo do unto iinoiber as he would wish others to do unto bim." The
Rev. Mr. Sheen, the Chaplain to tbe ligb Sheriff, who saw him about ball-past five
o'clock, bad previously uddressed bim al-o upon ine same topics; and the consequence
of these solicitations was, tbat in the course of the night ho made a conession, of
ubich we give authentic particulars.

68!
At hall-past one o'clock last night, Mr. Orridge left Corder; anu soon afterwards
he fell asleep, and slept to all appearance calmly till six o'clock this morning. He
says, bowever, that his sleep was not sound, but disturbed by dreams. He acquired
considerable firmness in the course of yesterday, in consequence of the spiritual
consolation aflorded to him, first of all by his wie, and next by the Chaplain of
the guol (the Rev. Mr. Stocking) and the Rev. Mr. Sheen. I understand that
several methodist preachers applied to be admitted to him, but were refused
admission.
This morning, at half-past nine o'clock, Corder was, by his own request, taken
into the prison chapel to attend, for the last time, divine service. I was present at the
performance of it. He entered the chapel with a firm step, and took his seat in the
condemned pew, as he did yesterlay. He bad, however, laid aside his prison
dress, and had on the same clothes which he wore in Court during the trial. His
appearance was much more composed than I should have expected, after the over-
whelming sorrow and dismay by which he appeared overcome yesterday. This,
perhaps, may be attributable to the ghostly consolation which was administered to
him by Mr. Stocking at an early hour this morning. He did not hide his
countenance, as he did yesterday, in his handkerchief; nor did he shed a single tear.
He exhibited a befitting and not unmanly sense of the awful situation in which he
was placed. On sitting down, he betrayed his inward feelings by a tremulous
motion of his foot for some time, and then rested his head on his hand, supporting
his elbow upon his knee. A part of the burial service was again introduced into
the service of the day; and during several parts of it, he showed by his motions that
he joined in it from bis inmost soul. When the gracious invitation of God for all
that were heavy laden to come to him and rest upon his inercy was read, he opened
bis band slowly, pressed it to his head, and heaved a deep sigh. He likewise exhi.
bited some emotion at an occasional prayer which was introduced into the service,
in which the text of Scripture was introduced that says, "Whoso confesseth his sins
and forsaketh them, shall have mercy." He joined with great ferrour in a prayer
which called upon God to spare bim in the agonies of death, which he was presently
to endure; and to extend to him that mercy which he had not extended to his
departed sister. The latter allusion affected bim deeply, for be raised up his left
hand, gave a convulsive shudder, and struck it with some violence on his knee.
During the rest of the service, which was nearly the same as yesterday, he did not
betray any extraordinary emotion. At the close of it, bis pew was opened ; on
.eaving it, he made a few steps by himself, and then tottered, and seemed as if about
to fall. One of the prison attendants then gave him his arm, and led him back to
his cell. At eleven o'clock, the Chaplain was admitted into his cell, and administered
to him the Sacrament. The remaining particulars of the wretched man's conduct
will be found detailed with great minuteness in the statement which Mr. Orridge
bas drawn up, and which is as follows:
MR. ORRIDGE'S STATEMENT.
Upon William Corder's returning from the Shire-ball, ater he had received
sentence, I took him into my office, and explained to him that I had a melan-
choly and painful duty to perform with respect to him, and that a part of that
duty was to have him immediately stripped of his clothes, and have the prison
clothes put on him. This was accordingly done. I then told him, I thought the
sooner he could forget all earthly matters the better; and therefore, if he had any
request to make, I begged he would recollect himself and do it immediately, and
that I would instantly tell him if bis wishes, whatever they might be, could or
would be complied with. After some consideration, he said it would be a great con.
solation to him if his wie could be permitted to spend the remainder of his time with
bim. This, I told him, was impossible, but that she would be allowed two interviews
with him: he was then removed to another room. The Chaplain (Mr. Stocking) at.
tended bim in the evening; after the Chaplain was gone, I continued with bim till
ball. past ten o'clock. I hinted to bim that his defence, though perhaps ingenious,
could not le believed, and that surely he would feel an inward satisfaction in confess.
ing the truth. He tben declared bis delence was true, and that he had nothing to
conless ; indeed, he said, the confession of his faults would only tend to disgrace his
family more, and could be of no use to his soul; and upon any other question put to
bim respecting the murder during that evening he preserved a sullen silence.
In the course of the evening be mentioned the particulars of his marriage : he
stated that he left home the latter end of September ; that he went to Portsmouth,
the l:le of Wiglit, and Southampton ; that he returned to London in about two
months, and then advertised for a wife; that he had forty-five applications to the ad.
ertisement, and that one of them was from a lady, who wrote to bim to say tbat sba

should go to church in a certain dress, and sit in a particular place; and requesting
bim to go to church with his left arm in a black sling, a black handkerchief round
his neck, and place himself in such a position that they might see each other, and
then judge if a personal interview would be desirable. He said be accordingly went
to the church ; but by some means he had mistaken the hour of divine service, so tbat
he never saw that lady. He said, that after he saw bis present wie be never left her
till they were married ; that from the time of his advertising to his marriage was
about a week. I observed to him that he was a most fortunate man, under those cir-
cumstances, to have met with a woman who had been so kind to him during the
whole of bis confinement. I tben left him.
Mytwo servants told me, the next morning, that he fellasleep abouteleven o'clock, and
slept till after four o'clock; that be did not talk to them. During Saturday the Chaplain
(Mr. Stocking) was several times with him. At other times I now and then hinted
the necessity of confession. In the course of that day he said " that confession to
God was all that was necessary, and that confession to man was what he called Pope-
dom, or Popery, and he would never do it." It was binted to him, some time in the
day, that he must have had great nerv, to dig the hole during the time the body lay
in his sight. His reply was, " Nobody knows that the body lay in the Barn, and in
sight, whilst I dug the hole ;" and would then say no more on the subject, but ex-
claimed, " O God! nobody will dig my grave!"
His wife saw him in my presence for nearly an hour. He expressed much anxiety
about her future welfare : sbe entreated him to forget her, and employ his few hours
yet remaining in prayer for his salvation and eternal welfare. I went to his room
on Saturday evening, about eight o'clock, with an intention of sitting an hour or two
with him ; but he had gone to bed, and was asleep, and my men told me the next
morning that he had slept until near three o'cloek.
On Sunday morning Mr. Stocking was with him early, and endeavoured to lead
his mind to the necessity of confession: he attended chapel, and was very much
affected. About half-past twelve bis wie had her last interview: they were both
very much affected. In the course of that interview he exclaimed,  Well might
Mr. Orridge say, that I was a most fortunate man to meet with such a woman as
He then explained to her that he had told me the way in which they had come
together, and that he had forty-five applications to his advertisement: he entreated,
if ever she married again, to be sure not to answer any similar advertisement, as woful
experience must have convinced her how dangerous a step it was. Tbe parting
scene was most affecting; the poor woman remained in a state of stupor for some
time. Corder was much affected throughout the day, Mr. Stocking had several
interviews with him ; and in the evening the Sheriff's Chaplain, the Rey. Mr. Sheen,
attended him, for which attention he expressed himself as feeling very grateful.
About nine o'clock I sent him the annexed paper :-
" ConfessION.- Confession to the world has always been held necessary atone.
ment, where the party has. committed offences affecting the interests of society at
large.
" He that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth shall have
mercy.
" Surely confession to God cannot be here meant, as no man can hope to hide his
sins from God.  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another.'
(James v. 16.)
" Archbishop Tillotson says, ' In case our sins have been public and scandalous,
both reason and the practice of the Christian church do require, that when men bare
publicly offended, they should give public satisfaction and open testimony of their
repentance. The text in James is a direct command.'
" The Christian doctrine of the necessity of restitution is strong; and if you will
not confess, how can you make restitution to the reputation of your victim ? You
have accused ber of having murdered herself. If you died without denying that
accusation, how do you obey the command to do that to ano:ber which we would
have another do to us?'
" The doctrine of conession which is objectionable in a Popish point of view, is
the private confession to a priest of private vices; but the duty of making acknow.
ledgment of public crimes can have nothing to do with such objections. Even
supposing it doubtful whether a man is bound, after offending society, to confess his
errors to the world, there can be no doubt that he will not do any thing wrong by
conessing. One course is therefore certain the other uncertain. Can a man
hesitate to seize the former?

I begged he would read it attentively, and that I would come to him soon. I went
to bis room a little before ten, and remained in earnest conversation with bim till half-
past eleven: I tolj bim that during the 30 years I have beld my situation, I had the
satistection of assuring bim that no may who hnd been executed during that time had
ever dared to take the Sacranient in sullen silence about bis crime, or without con-
ession; that I well knew, from bis letters that I bud seen, und from other circum-
stances, that the line of defence he had adopted was not the dictates of bis own mind,
at least for a long time after bis commitment; and that I was sure that he would not
and dare not take the Sacrament, and remain silent, or deny being the guilty cause of
the dealh of poor Maria Marten. He then exclaimed, "Oh, Sir, I wish I had made
a confession io you beore; I have often wished to have done it; but you know, Sir,
it was no use employing a legal adviser, and then not follow ois advice." I told him,
that up to the time of bis conviction it was proper; but ibat being over, all eartbly
considerations must cease. He then exclaimed, "I am a guilty man!" I then went
for a pen and ink, and began to ask him the particulars of the oflence, wbich I told
bim the public had supposed him to be guilty of. He said, "Oh, spare me! I can
only mention to you the particulars of how Maria came by ber death; with this the
public must be satisfied; 1 cunuot say more." I then wrote the following confession
nearly in bis own words. I read i: to him atientively, and be signed it witb a firm
hand. I left bim about half-past one o'clock, and my men tell me be lay very still,
and appeared to sleep Ibrough the night.
On Saturday he told a respectable individual, whom I had asked to sit and read to
him, that be was guilty of the forgery upon Messrs. Alexander's Bank, and that he
bad been assured the money was paid : there are some parts of the foregoing state-
ment which he also mentioned to the same individual. He also expressed much
horror at the thoughts of being dissected and anatomized. He also stated, after be
had signed the confession, that he felt great respect for the girl, but that he bad no
intention to marry her at that time.

CONFESSION
" Bury Guol, August 10, 1828.
Condemned Cell, Sunday Evening, Half-past Eleven.
"I acknowledge being guilty of the death of poor Maria Marten, by shooting
her with a pistol. The particulars are as follow :- Wben we left her father's
house, we began quarrelling about the burial of the child,-she apprehending that
the place wherein it was deposited would be found out. The quarrel continued for
about three-quarters of an hour upon this and about other subjects. A scuffle en-
sued; and during the scumle, and at the time, I think, that she had hold of me, I took
the pistol from the side pocket of my velveteen jacket, and fired. She fell, and died
in an instant. I never saw even a struggle. I was overwhelmed with agitation and
dismay ;-the body fell near the front doors on the floor of the Barn. A vast
quantity of blood issued from the wound, and ran on to the floor, and through the
crevices. Having determined to bury the body in the Baru (about two hours after
she was dead-), I went and borrowed ihe spade of Mrs. Stowe; but, before I went
there, I dragged the body from the Barn into the chaff-house, and locked up the
Barn. I returned again to the Barn, and began to dig the hole; but the spade
being a bad one, and the earth firm and bard, I was obliged to go home for a pick-
axe and a better spade, with wbich I dug the bole, and then buried the body. I think
I dragged the body by the handkerchief that was tied round her neck, it was dark
when I finished covering up the body. I went the next day, and washed the blood
from off the Barn floor. I declare to Almighty God, I had no sharp instrument
about me, and that no other wound, but the one niade by the pistol, was inflicted by
me. I have been guilty of great idleness, and, at times, led a dissolute life; but i
hope, though the mercy of God, to be forgiven.

THE RED BARN.
Condemned Cell, Eleven o'Clock, Monday Morning, August 11, 1898.
The above confession was read over carefully to the prisoner, in our presence, who
stated most solemnly that it was true--that he had nothing to add or retract from it
W. STOCKING, Chaplain.
T. R. HOLMES, Under Sheriff.
In answer to a question from the Under Sheriff, he said, " that he thought the
ball bad entered the right eye." He said this in corroboration of his previous state-
ment, that he had no sharp instrument with bim in the Barn at the time he commit-
ted the murder. The Under Sheriff stated that Dr. Probart was with bim at the time
when the prisoner made this last confession.
He is quite convinced the ball entered the right eye.
[Mr. Orridge informed us, tbere were several points in Corder's statement on
which he wished to have further explanation, but that in bis peculiar circumstances
he could not press it; especially as Corder said to him on more than one occasion,
"Spure me upon that point-I have confessed all that is sufficient for public justice."|
THE EXECUTION.
From an early bour this morning, the population of the surrounding districts camo
pouring into Bury; and the whole of the labouring classes in this town struck work
for the day, in order that they might buve an opportunity of witnessing the execution
otbis wretched criminal, which was appointed to take place at twelve o'clock at noon.
As early as nine o'clock in the moraing, upwards of 1000 persons were assembled
around the scaffold, in the paddock, on the south side of the gaol ; and their numbers
kept increasing till twelve o'clock, wben they amoonted to at least 7000 persons.
Nothing could be more decent and orderly ihan their conduct. The majority con-
sisted of men, but we observed a large number of females in the crowd. Two women
must have been there at an extremely early bour, for they were close up to the wood.
work which surrounded the fatal drop. They appeared to be of the lowest class;
but many of the female spectators were of a mucb superior grade. Seated on a wall,
wbich gave a commanding view of the whole scene, were several ladies, dressed in
the first style of fushion. We mention this fact, because it shows the intense curiosity
prevalent in this county respec'ing every action of Corder; for nothing else could
have brought respectable emales to bebold a catastropbe so uncongenial with the
usual kindness and benevolence of the female character. Every building in the
neighbourhood was covered with occupants, and in one of the adjacent fields were
several gentlemen on borseback, expecting the appearance of the prisoner.
At ten minutes before twelve o'clock Corder was brought from his own cell, which
was on the second story of the prison, to a cell on the basement story. He was
there pinioned by the executioner wbo officiates at the Old Bailey, and who was spe-
cially retained for tbis event. He appeared resigned to his fate, though he sigbed
heavily at intervals. After his arms were fastened, he would bave fallen to the
ground, had it not been for the support afforded to bim by one of the constables. He
recovered after a moment from the transient faintness wbich had overcome bim, and
kept ejaculating in an under tone, " May God forgive me ! Lord, receive my soul!"
The executioner was then going to put the cap upon the prisoner's face, when Mr.
Orridge interfered, and said that the time was not yet come. He was then led by bis
own desire around the different wards of the prison, and shook hands with the differ.
ent prisoners, who were assembled at the doors entering into them. As a proof that
be was at that time perfectly conscious of what he was doing, be singled out a pri-
soner of the name of Nunn, sbook bands with bim as well as bis bandaged situation
would allow, and said to bim, "Nunn, God Almighty bless you !" In another ward
he called the same blessing on two prisoners of the names, as we were informed, of
Sampson. The men addressed appeared deeply affected, as, indeed, did most of the
prisoners who witnessed the melancholy spectacle.
After he had gone round the entrance to the different wards of the prison, wbich
are ranged round the Governor's house, wbich is built upon an octagonal base, he pro-
ceeded to the debtor's yard, where be bade farewell to three individuals who came to
zbake bands with him. After he had performed this duty, wbich Mr. Orridge was of
opinion migbt prove beneficial to the juvenile offenders in the prison, the procession
to the scaffold was formed in the usual manner by the Under Sheriff and his attendants
The Rev. W. Stocking, for whose attention the prisoner expressed himself mos
grateful, led the way, reading the commencement of the burial service-"I am the
resurrection and the rie ; whosoever believeth in me shall not die, but have ever-
lasting life." In a few minutes afterwards the procession reached the door-way w bich
opened to the scaffold, and Corder was placed upon the floor, which, when withdrawn,

was to plunge him into eternity. The prospect from the place on which he stood la
of the most beautiful description. The fore-ground consists of softly-swelling bills,
bounded in the distance by extensive plantations, which form a sort of amphitheatre
around the prison. But the loveliness of the scenery bad for him no beanty ; for the
moment bis eyes opened upon it they were to be closed for ever. After he was placed
under the futal beam, Mr. Orridge approached him, and asked whether be wisted to
address the multitude. He gave some indistinct answer, wbich we did not bear, and
Mr. Orridge immediately said to the crowd, in a loud voice, "He acknowledges tbc
justice of his sentence, and dies in peace with all mankind." The executioner then
drew the cap over his face. The officer who supported bim says, that be afterwards
added, when quite unable to stand, " I deserve my fate; I bave offended my God:
may be bave mercy on my soul !" Within a minute afterwards the deadly bolt was
withdrawn, and be was cut of from the number of the living. The hangman, after
the corpse had fallen, performed bis disgusting but necessary task, of suspending bis
own weight around the body of the prisoner, to accelerate his death. At the same
moment, the prisoner, who appeared to be in the last agonies, clasped his hands
lighier together, as if he was forming bis last prayer for the mercy and forgiveness of
offended Heaven. Immediately afterwards bis arms, whicb were raised a little, fell-
the muscles appeared to relax- and bis bands soon sunk down as low as the r pinioned
condition permitted. But life was not yet extinct; about eight minutes afterwards
there was a heario of the shoulders, a slight convulsion of the frame-an indistinct
groan--and then all was still, and no further motion was observed.
The body, after hanging the usual time, was cut down and conveyed in a cart to
the Shire-hall. It was placed on the table in the Nisi Prius Court; and after the
crucial incision had been performed, and the outwurd integuments removed, was
exposed to the gaze of the public. The exact stature of this guilly victim to public
justice was five feet five inches, and the medical gentleman who performed the inci-
sion informed us, that for so small a man he was an extremely muscular subject. It was
to be removed to the hospital the following morning, to be dissected and anatomized
according to the sentence. A cast is to be taken from the features, and the head is
to undergo a critical inspection by a physician of this town, in order that an account
of it may be transmitted forth with to the Pbrenological Soci ty. A galvanic battery
has also been brou ht from Cambridge to perform experimer's upon it.
It is an extraordinary fact, and certainly not to be accounted for on any principle
of reason or common sense, that the rope with which Corder was hanged bas become
an article olarduous competition. We have been informed that it has been sold for a
guinea an inch to the various parties wbo bade for it. We heard, in the course of the
day, that several labouring men bad walked thirty miles to witness the execution: the
account appears extremely probable; for on our return to London, the road was lined
for several miles with persons returning from this melancholy spectacle.
The following fact will give some idea of the intense interest which this trial bas
created in Bury and its vicinity. Thougb two booksellers in the town have each
published reports of the trial, and bave bad their shops besieged by purchasers ever
since its conclusion, five hundred copies of Knight and Lacey's edition of the trial
were sold tbis day in Bury, within a few hours after their arrival from London.
Mrs. Corder (tbe mother of the deceased) bas been so overcome by the disgrace
which the misconduct of her son has brought upon ber, that she has been for some
time unable to leave her bed. Neitber sbe nor her daugbter beld the slightest com-
munication with Corder after his condemnation. His wife is, we understand, in Bury
seriously indisposed. Corder wrote a letter to ber this morning, shortly before the
execution, of wbich we have just been favoured with a copy :-
"My life's loved companion,-I am now a going to the fatal scaffold, and I have
a lively hope of obtaining mercy and pardon for my numerous offences. May Hea-
vens bless and protect you through this transitory vale of misery, and which, when
we meet again, may it be in the regions of everlasting bliss. Adieu, my love, for
ever adieu : in less than two hours I hope to be in Heaven. My last prayer is, that
God will endue you with patience, fortitude, and resignation to bis will. Rest as-
sured his wise Providence work all things together for good. The awful sentenco
which has been passed upon me, and which I am now summoned to answer, I con
foss is just, and I die in pence with all munkind, truly grateful for be kindnesses I
have received from Mr. Orridge, and the religious instruction and consolation from
the Rev. Mr. Stocking, wbo has promised to take my last words to you."
The above was written with pencil in a blank leaf at the end of a vo.ume of Blair's
Sermons, which appears to have been a gift of Mrs. Corder to her husband, from the
following words on another leaf at the beginning of tbe book :-" Mary Corder to
her husband W. Corder, a birthday present, June 22, 1828."
Corder attained bis 24th year on the above day,

:
The warrant for Corder's execution differed slightly from the form to which an
former warrants for the execution of murderers were drawn up. The alteration was
made in consequence of a clanse in Lord Landsdown's late Act for Malicious Injury
to the Person. The old form of warrant merely ordered the body to be given to cor-
geons to be anatomised and dissected ; tbe present form appoints tho bospital at
which such dissection shall take place. In this instance, the body was given to the
hospital at town.
The execution took place on the sout side of the prison, at tw ve o'clock pre-
cisely. A gateway was cut in the wall, through which the prisoner advanced to the
fatal platform, along a stage erocted for that purpose. Some of his fellow prisoners,
who seem to think that life is a jest, and that death is nothing but a drunken
deep, have already cut a joke upon this door-way, by giving it the niokname of
a Corder's otorpol way."

IN ANSWER TO
CORDER'S MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENT.
SIR,
The perusal of your advertisement in the Sunday Times awakened
a feeling of sympathy, as I also have been the subject of the chastening
hand of Providence.
I do not reply for myself, but having the pleasure of knowing a
young and amiable female, in her twenty-third year, and who is highly
accomplished, it occurred to me, that she might prove a companion
suited to ameliorate your present sorrows, and enliven your future
prospects. You request real names and address ; forgive me, Sir, if
under the existing circumstances I withhold both, as I think it would be
an infringement of the female delicacy, to avow them in the present
stage of our correspondence. If you will favour me with an interview
on Waterloo Bridge, between the hours of three and four on the
afternoon of Wednesday next, I shall be able to communicate every
particular to you: that you recognize me, it is necessary to say, that I
shall wear a black.silk dress, red shawl, and grey muff, claret-coloured
bonnet, and black veil; our conversation must commence by your
presenting me with this note. Believe me when I add, that I am
perfectly serious, and have no other motive in addressing you than pro-
moting the happiness of two young persons.
I am, Sir,
Yours very obediently

27th, 1828.
Os taking up the paper this morning, your advertisement was the
rst thing that met my eye, and on seeing the word " Matrimony" 1
laughing said, a gentleman wants a wie, but I suppose he is still in
greater want of money, otherwise he wishes to make himself warm this
cold weath:ry by laughing at the credulity of the female sex; yet surely
no man of understanding can derive pleasure by making fools of those
who are by nature weak, and entitled to protection and pity rather
than ridicule. Having said all I had to say, I fetched a deep sigh,
conscious, I suppose, of my own defects, and again looked at the
paper without intending to do it. I read your advertisement through,
and was not a little surprised on finishing it; for although there may
oe not be one word of truth, yet certainly it wears the resemblance of
sincerity. I really your situation is what you have represented it to
be, allow me, although a stranger, sincerely to sympathise with you;
:hough young I have suffered much by unhappy differences in my own
family, therefore can feel for others who endure the like misery.
I repeat, if your tale is true, upon my word I pity you: if it is a
fiction, I hope my sex may be revenged by your being obliged, at some
future period, to pass a month--one month, in a house of discord.
But if this statement is indeed sincere, I hope ere long you may be
enabled to regain peace and undisturbed tranquillitythat you may soon
tind a lady whose disposition may accord with what yours is said to
be. For myself, I want not a home; I have every necessary and comfort,
though not the superfluities of life, and am far from thinking that happi-
ness is only the attendant on riches. I am content, and strive to
make others happy; the great can do no more, and I with pleasure
look forward to the day which I hope will introduce me to one who
may possess some of those amiable qualities which the advertisement
says belong to you. Do not hold up to ridicule those foibles which are
constitutional in my sex: remember perfection is unattainabile. Rather
pity than condemn; and, in return, I will wish you, whoever you may
be, ani le nappiness you can wish yourself.
And I remain, &c.

SIR,
In perusing the T'imes Paper of Nov. 25th, I observed your adver-
tisement for a partner in the marriage life, where you say any female
of respectability, who would study for domestic comforts, and willing
to confide in you, led me to suppose that fortune was not your object,
which induced me to make the application, though I must say prudence
whispers it is contrary to the rules of decorum, and I believe this is
the first time I have ever deviated from her precepts. I am a female
of respectability, my father has been a very respectable tradesman
and a man of good fortune, but Providence has now placed me in a
more humble situation; I have had a good plain education, but no
accomplishments. If I have been too presumptuous in addressing one
who styles himself an independent gentleman and a man of honour, I
trust this will be buried in oblivion ; but should it be thought worthy
of an answer, it much oblige
Your humble Servant.
P.S. Probably you might like a description of the writer of these
lines ;--she is of rather short stature, slight made, not handsome, dark
complexion, dark hair and eyes, and one who lias not wrote out of
impertinent curiosity, but for particular reasons dare not sign her napie
in this ; but if she have occasion to write a second, you may rely upon
it being signed, should this be answered.

SIR,
Ilaving seen your advertisement in the Sunday Times Newspaper,
I beg leave to reply to it; not from any impertinent curiosity, but
from a wish that what I state may meet with your approbation. I am
the daughter of a respectable tradesman; he is the only one of the
family in business. I have a step-mother, and there is a second family,

therefore, to prevent any disagreement amongst us, I have left my
father's house, and am at this time earning my own living in one of
the first establishments in (not as a milliner or dress maker).
My friends are kind enough to say that I possess a good temper, lively
disposition, and as to appearance passable, not any pretension to
beauty; with regard to property, all I ever expect to be mistress of
will be a small income, left me by my mother; it is sufficient to keep me
independent when I shall have the misfortune to lose my father, which
I hope may be many years ere that event happens. My age is the
same as your own, twenty-four; your being in affluent circumstances
would not induce me to become your wife, unless I found your dis-
position and mine could agree, and that in every sense of the word I
could love, honour, and obey, with pleasure and gratitude. I think I
have said all that prudence will allow. I must add, I think it rather
unfair for you to expect a respectable female would like to give her
real name and address in the first letter she writes ; for although your
advertisement reads very fair, there may be some little trick on your
side; but I am in earnest, and you may depend upon the greatest
secrecy. Should what I have said meet your approbation, direct to
me, post paid.
Monday Evening, Nov. 26th, 1827.
Sir,
By accident I saw your advertisement in the Sunday Times ; its
seeming honour and sincerity induced me to answer it. I feel I am
guilty of an impropriety in doing so without the knowledge of my
friends, but a disposition like the one you seem to possess, will pardon
the indiscretion when you know the situation 1 am placed in. My
father has received an offer from one whose disposition is in every
respect the opposite of my own; I cannot accept it only by sacrificing
every feeling of delicacy and affection, therefore I have taken the only
means that presented of preventing the sacrifice of my own happiness,
or the wishes of my friends. Your disposition seems one that would
ensure the happiness of those who would entrust it to your care.
My friends and family connexions are respectable; my disposition is
naturally candid and affectionate, and would make it the study of my
life to add to the happiness of my friend. I am very young, not yet

SIR,
In answer to an advertisement in the Sunday Times, expressing your
desire of being introduced to a female of domestic habits, and a dis-
position to ensure happiness in the marriage state, I beg leave to state,
I am of a retired and doinestic character, having been always under
the care of an amiable and prudent mother; I have a tolerable person,
perhaps some beauty, nineteen years of age, good tempered, and of an
affectionate disposition. I have resided in London about three years;
my family is very respectable, but owing to some change in circum-
stances, my circle of acquaintance is very limited, therefore I have but
little chance of forming an establishment; this has induced me to enter
into a detail of my own qualifications, - a thing which is repugnant to my
Ceelings.
I feel rather averse to giving my address upon a first communication,
if you answer this application, and are serious in the professions you
make, I shall not withhold it.
I remain, Sir,
Your obedient humble Servant,
Direct for
November 25th, 1827.
When a female breaks through the rules of etiquette, justly prescribed
for her sex, as a boundary which she must not pass without sacrificing
some portion of that delicacy which ought to be her chief charac-
teristic, it must be for some very urgent reason, such as romantic love,
or a circumstance like the present; and in answering your advertise-
ment, I feel that I am in some degree transgressing the law alluded to,
and yet the novelty and sentiments of the advertisement itself, so entirely
different from the language generally made use of (and which alone
induced me to answer it), almost assure me that no improper advantage
will be taken of the confidence I place in the honour of the writer ;
however, as you request that no person will write from motives of
curiosity, I trust that no feeling of that nature actuated you in gireng
me this opportunity ;-but enough of preface.
I need not describe my person, as, should an interview take place,
you can judge for yourself; and for mental accomplishments, I am as
much indebted to nature and good society, as to education; but ficm

my retired habits and present sphere of life, I flatter myself I should
be as well calculated to make a domestic man happy, and to enjoy the
social charms of domestic life, as if I had received the first boarding
school education, and mixed largely in the world of fashion. My
prospects in life were once brilliant, but when misfortune with her
gloomy train of attendants surrounded my family, the scene changed;
but I have still some expectations, although, from the tenor of your
advertisement, I presume fortune is but a secondary consideration; a
companion only is wanted who would sympathize in all your joys or
griefs; one who would return kindness with kindness, love for love; and
as I perfectly know my own heart as far as regards those qualities, I
do not flatter myself when I say that such a companion would I prove,
and where confidence was shown, the fullest would be returned 
pardon the warmth of my expressions, nor think me forward in offering
them, as I am no giddy girl, nor am I a romantic old maid, but a
warm hearted, affectionate girl, whose age qualifies her to pass between
the two characters, being just turned twunty-one. Excuse my saying
more on so delicate a subject; my family are of the highest respecta-
bility. References of course will be given and required. Waiting your
answer,

SIR,
As I was perusing yesterday's Times, I inadvertently cast my eye
on your advertisement, which I am induced to answer, not from a
motive of curiosity, but for this reason,--that from the general tenor of
its contents, it so much resembles my own fate, that I cannot help
thinking that our dispositions would in some measure be congenial to
each other, and I am very sure that time must glide on much more
agrecably when passed in the society of a tender and affectionate com-
panion. To convince you that I am of a respectable family, I will
give you a few particulars, which I hope and trust will be kept secret.
My father was a ; I was left an orphan under the guardian-
who placed me at a school to be educated for a
governess, consequently, I have moved in society perhaps not inferior
to the rank you hold, but by a deviation from rectitude, which was

Ocu..jioned by the too easily listening to the flattery of one whose
vows I foolishly believed to be true, I am entirely deserted by my
family, and banished from society; nevertheless, I flatter myself that
I do not altogether merit such a ate, for I do assure you, that no one
could have acted more prudently than I have done since the unfortunate
circumstance happened, which has very much destroyed my peace of
mind, but I still hope to see better days: I am two-and-twenty years
of age, but have not the least pretension to beauty-quite the contrary.
I have a sweet little girl, who is my greatest comfort; she is sixteen
months old, and is beginning to prattle very prettily. I have no fortune
whatever, but am supporting myself by needle-work at present, until I
can meet with something more to my advantage. I mention these
facts, that you may not be led into any error, for I should be extremely
sorry to act with any duplicity towards any one, and I leave you
to
consider how far your generosity will extend to appreciate my wrongs,
and excuse my past misconduct. I trust that upon acquaintance you
would find that I possess qualities which may in some measure over-
balance, or at least mitigate, those errors which were committed through
an affection which I supposed to be mutual, and at the same time
honourable, but, alas ! have found it quite the reverse. I can only add,
that should
you
wish an interview, I am ready at any time to see you,
either at my own abode, which you will find very respectable, or at
any place you may appoint, appropriate with the circumstance; and
should I prove finally the female of your choioe, you may rest assured
that nothing should be wanted on my part towards the augmentation of
your happiness, and to render your house comfortable.

SIR,
On perusing my paper for Nov. 25th, I observed an advertisement,
the object of which appeared to be the obtaining a valuable partner.
Now, I am not generally disposed to view advertisedients of this de-
scription in a very favourable light, but on calmly observing this I felt a
sort of sympathy, which could only have been imparted by the Disposer
of all events. No doubt, ere this, you will naturally conclude that I

about to iutroduce myself, but this I assure you is not the case; it
s an object more worthy your attention-an object, who I will not
Desitate to say, would render that man happy above all others on whom
she may bestow her heart, as well as hand. A more sincere friend I
have never met with, and many a pang would it cost me to part with
her, but it grieves my very soul to see one so delicate, and possessing
so much sensibility, alone in the world. I have a brother, of whom
I believe Heaven could witness there is not on earth, at least in my
opinion, one more calculated for a partner; his person is elegant and
prospects bright, and he idolizes her; repeatedly has he addressed her
on the subject, but has unfortunately been repulsed. She has often
told me she esteemed him for his worth, and were it possible I could
love him with that degree of warmth of which I know I am capable of
loving, I would bestow on him my heart and hand, but unfortunately
for his happiness I cannot love him, for I will never deceive that man
who is to be my partner for life. I will marry that man, and him only,
whom I could prefer to every other; that man without whom the
world will become a barren waste. She has had, to my knowledge,
several offers of good settlements; but she has told me, when I have
spoken to her on the subject, she could not account for it, but she had
never yet seen that object whom she should feel justified in exchanging
her present situation with, and added, O-
- I have a heart pos-
sessing too much sensibility to entrust it to the care of any man I have
yet seen; recollect my happiness has once been sacrificed to parental
authority. Perhaps you will be a little surprised when I tell you, this
paragon of perfection is a widow of twenty-three years of age; she
lives alone, with a female servant, and has the - business conducted
for her by an assistant since her husband's decease, which has been
about three years. He was a very handsome man, universally respected;
he adored her: she was the faithful and domestic wife. He has observed
to me, although he felt convinced he had only obtained her hand, her
value was above all price ; he was ill above twelve months, during
which time I had, in common with many others, an opportunity of
witnessing her unexampled kindness to him. Although at that time only
twenty, she had the discretion of sixty, and were you only one week in
her company you must adore her, if you possess a heart capable of
loving one who has, in my estimation, everything calculated to make
the marriage state a perfect Paradise. Her disposition is beyond every-
thing excellent. She has property, but to what amount I am not aware.

If the intention of the advertiser be truly such as stated in the

respectability as to friends and connexions, would, from peculiar family
arrangements, be induced to accept the honourable proposals of any

Sir,
In reply to your advertisement in the Sunday Times, Nov, 25th
instant, I must confess, on perusing, I felt rather interested on your
behalf; at the same time I am surprised a gentleman possessing so
many good qualities, in addition to youth and fortune, should be under
the necessity of adopting a mode so public; but there is some apology.
to be made after the reason you give. I am a young person without
parents, possessing a small income ; would of course have no objection
to form an alliance with a gentleman of respectability, gifted with those
desirable qualifications. With respect to myself, I have been well
educated in the usual mode of polite education, music, &c., and seen a
great deal of domestic life, that I flatter myself, having arrived at the
age of twenty-five years, I am competent to fulfil the duties of a married
life. I say nothing of my personal appearance, as I propose ocular
demonstration. You must excuse my giving my real name and

Having been obliged to be out a great deal the last two or three days,

living in the house. At the receipt of your last I thought it was high
time to lay the whole proceedings (from beginning to end) before my
brother, who was exceedingly angry I had done such a thing, but
consented, as things had gone so far, to meet you any day you might
appoint, between the hours of four and six. I sincerely trust my not
answering your letter before has not been the means of anything serious
happening, as I should have been extremely sorry to have occasioned

Your advertisement in the Times paper of yesterday has diet my
observation, and though I feel some repugnance in answering it, yet
circumstances, I trust, will justify the measure. I must now inform
you
that I have been genteelly educated, that my connexions are very
respectable ; I have a widowed mother and only one surviving brother.
Misfortunes of a painful and pecuniary nature have induced me to
reside for the last three years with a lady, with whom I am treated as
a daughter. My education, though genteel, has been quite of a
domesticated nature, and I flatter myself that my disposition will not be
found unamiable to any one with whom I might be disposed to form a
permanent connexion. My friends are kind enough to consider my
person pleasing, and my age does not exceed your own; you will,
however, excuse my giving my name and address, as my ignorance of
the party with whom I am corresponding leads to a similar feeling on
my own part; and until I am acquainted with your name and residence,
you must excuse my withholding my own. Should you be inclined to

As I am at present resident at , your advertisement did not

received opinion of the impropriety of answering advertisements, I will
for once swerve and reply to yours. You must at present excuse my
giving you my address, as this letter is unknown to any one; and should
we eventually become acquainted, I should not ever wish it known,
even to my own family, the way the acquaintance was formed. My
family and connexions are of the highest respectability and character,
mine would bear the most rigid scrutiny. In person I am considered
a pretty little figure. Hair nut-brown, blue eyes, not generally con-
sidered plain, my age nearly 25. My married friends have ofter told me
I am calculated to make an amiable man truly happy; and without vanity
1 think I am, as I am cheerful, domestic, of good education and dis-
position, and have always mixed in good society. In a letter like this
egotism must be pardoned.
Should you consider this deserving of consideration, as I trust you
are a man of honour, and would not sport with the feelings of a young
person of respectability; if you are serious on this subject, any farther
communications you may require I will readily give; if you will direct
