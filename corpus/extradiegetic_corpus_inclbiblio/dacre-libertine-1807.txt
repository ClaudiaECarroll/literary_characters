CHAPTER I.
The painter, who seeks the admiration of
the crowd alone, bestows his chief atten-
tion upon vivid colouring, and striking
effect, desirous rather to seize the ima-
gination by the boldness of his conception,
than to satisfy the judgment by the close-
ness of his designs from nature.

view, should not, in his delineations of
vice, exaggerate, or overcharge the picture,
by unnatural representation; but, tracing
conscientiously, and steadily, its terrible
consequences, aim rather to fortify the
mind, by a lesson of severe truth, than to
astonish, without impressing it, by the
incongruous legends of romance.
It was in that sublimely beautiful part of
Switzerland, which the magic pen of the
tender enthusiast, Rousseau, has rescued
from obscurity, that Montmorency, and
his daughter, retired within their cottage,
listened tranquilly to the raging storm
without. The youthful Gabrielle, in all
the bloom of beauty, and simplicity of inno-
cence, the result of a life passed among
the mountains, free from the contagion of
society, was endeavouring, by the efforts
of her pencil, to rescue from decay the
perishable tints of a flower,

morency was reading, but not aloud, the
Maxims of La Rochefoucault; for,
though he fled from, and hated the world,
he wished not to cloud, by premature mi-
santhropy, the generous dawn of youth.
While thus they were mutually em-
ployed, the latch of the cottage door was
gently raised, the door opened, and a young
man, of an elegant figure, presented
himself before them. It was enough;
Montmorency detested the world, but he
could not refuse shelter to a stranger ;-he
rose immediately, and taking him by the
hand, placed him in his own chair, while
Gabrielle instinctively threw another fag-
got' on the fire, and hastened to procure
some wine.

me to hope that I may find shelter here
for the night; if so," he added, looking
alternately at Montmorency, and his
daughter, but longer at the latter, " how
shall I not bless the chance which has
conducted me hither ?
" Our accommodations here," answered
Montmorency, " are, probably, not such as
you have been accustomed to; for one
night, however, you will, I hope, endea-
vour to conform to them."
The stranger was profuse of acknow-
ledgments ; but Montmorency was silent,
for he had acted only according to the im-
pulse of his heart, and as he considered
his duty. He caused a bed, the best his
cottage would afford, to be prepared for his
guest; hesought to render agreeable to him,

into conversation which might cause him
to unbend, or induce a relaxation from a
reserve now become habitual to hiin, he
motioned his daughter to retire, and point-
ing out to him his apartment, withdrew
immediately to his own.
Montmorency, the present inhabitant
of a small sequestered cottage, in the vil-
lage of Meillerie, buried ainid mountains,
and isolated from the world, was yet a gen-
tleman, in the purest and most positive ac-
ceptance of the terir. His birth was noble,
his ancestry illustrious, for he was de-
scended from the family of the chivalrous
Josselin de Montmorency, who distin-
guished himself in the third crusade against
the Saracens, under Philip Augustus.
Though now bereft of fortune, friends, and
every future prospect, faithful to the sacred
Inemory of his ancestors, he preserved bis
honour unimpeached, and retained too,

amid his disastrous poverty, the genuine
dignity which results from the conscious-
ness of true nobility. But what occasi-
oned this painful degradation in the for-
tunes of the unhappy Frenchman? It was
gaming ! source of unnumbered ills ! insa-
tiate furor which has destroyed the fortune
of millions, and still continues to destroy
them. Montmorency pursued its seductive
allurements, nearly to the gates of ruin;
till then he recovered not from his infatua-
tion; he awakened but to behold around
him a desolate waste ;, while in melancholy
association with himself, deprived of all,
his eye paused in horror upon his unconscia
ons child. What anguish in a retrospect of
the past! He stood, with his beggared off-
spring, alone in the world; friends talked of
pity, but remained aloof, and, in the midst
of a populous city, he soon beheld himself
in the profoundest solitude. Disgusted
with the base selfishness of the world, its

ingratitude, its delusions, its ephemeral
friendship, and time-serving hypocrisy,
he, with scrupulous exactness, proudly
scorning to explain his situation, gave
up almost the whole of what he pos-
sessed, assigning to each what was his
due, and then, with the young Gabrielle,
quitted for ever the haunts of civilised
society, where man, polished and culti-
vated, preys, like a refined barbarian,
upon his fellow man.
Such the leading features of Mont-
morency's history. On abandoning the
world, he had sought to be ever remote
from its observation ; his was no luke-
warm quarrel with, or splenetic disgust
against it; he possessed no feeling that
momentary exhiliration, or brighter
thoughts, might chace; therefore, he
desired a solitude, eternal, and profound,
where he inight live, and die, forgotten

and unnoticed by those he dreaded and
abhorred. Such a situation he had
found amid the wilds of Switzerland,--a
desolate retirement, fenced round by
rugged rocks, where he had fixed his
residence, though with some pangs of the
heart, yet with a prouder feeling than
swells the bosom of the youthful heir
who takes possession of the splendid
estate of his ancestors. His fair daugh-
ter, alone, accompanied him in his exile;
and the
pangs of Montmorency were for
her only, when he remembered that, thus
robbed of fortune, and every future
pros-
pect, she must lose likewise the superior
advantage of polished education, "Yet
can I not" said he, mentally, " be myself
her'instructor? Assuredly I can;" and, in
pursuance of this idea, the best selection

sures. Already, in childhood, from his
tender and patient instructions, she had
acquired a knowledge superior to what
she could have attained from the hired,,
systematic, and mechanical operations of
persons wholly uninterested, but for their
own advantage. She had received, as
it were, the ore refined from the dross; a
polished education, without the contagion
of evil example; her instructions tended
to improve her mind, and to render her
virtuous; and nothing tended to counter-
act their effects. As she advanced in
years, Montmorency depicted to her, in
glowing, but not flattering colours, the
world from which she was excluded, and
which fondly he endeavoured to hope it
would be never necessary for her to
associate with. Availing himself of his
experience, and impressed with the severe
lessons lie had received, he represented

to her, mankind as monsters, from whom
it was happiness to escape.
" There is a world, beyond these sub-
lime solitudes, my Gabrielle," would he
say;
" but seek not to know it, for your
knowledge must be purchased by the des-
truction of your innocence, and the wreck
of
your peace. Society corrupts the heart;
if in retirement, it should be urged that
the active duties of life are not so power-
fully called forth, neither does the com-
paratively limited sphere of existence re--
quire them. Oh, may you never quit this
seclusion! for here alone can you remain
both virtuous and happy." The frequent
recurrence of this subject, wherein Mont-
morency continually presented to his daugh-
ter the worst side of human nature, ever
pourtrayed with increasing bitterness, in-
spired her innocent mind with a feeling
amounting almost to horror of her fellow

creatures; the first wish of her heart was,
to live and die, in the seclusion of her
childhood; and fervently did she concur
in the wish of her father, that never might
she be necessitated to quit it. Whether
the plan of Montmorency was just and
safe, in thus describing all men alike, in
levelling all distinction, and teaching her,
that all should be equally distrusted ; or
whether, by so doing, he did not run a risk
of leaving her open to the wires of the
first accomplished seducer she encountered,
who might appear a being wholly different
from his description, remains to be proved;
but, taking the hue from his feelings, and
trembling with the anxiety of a father, he
had no mode of preserving her from temp-
tation, but by an exaggeration of the dan-
ger to be encountered.

energy of mind, and strength of charac-

ter, that no education could give, and
which to exist must be imbued with the
soul: though a life of solitude inight
never call forth these attributes, yet was it
powerless to subdue them. She reflected
often on the conversation she held with
her father, and sometimes allowed herself
to ask, ". Are all mankind, then, equally
bad?. Can there be no exceptions ?
Surely, surely, my father has been ill treated
by the worldhe has met with ingratitude.
-Or if it be, indeed, a world such as he
describes, if such are human beings, it is
almost reproach to be of the same spe-
cies." Her mode of life, her habits of
gloomy reflection, and the doubts in
which her enquiring mind was occasionally
involved; contributed to throw over her
air a certain melancholy, that, though little
suited to her period of life, appeared in her
beautiful and interesting. This was chiefly
perceptible after conversing with her father ;

an uneasy impression remained on her
spirits, and, like those who entered the
cave of Trophonius, animation was long
after invincibly chilled. The pictures of
Montmorency, sketched ever by the pencil
of a misanthrope, could not fail of deeply
affecting the youthful mind, permitted only
to behold the miseries of social intercourse,
without a reference to its comforts; yet he
persuaded himself, that he was right in doing
thus,--that he did not wish her to hate,
but merely to dread the world; and, fear-
ful lest she should imagine it a heaven,
he verged into the opposite extreme, and
painted it a hell.
The person of Gabrielle resembled her
inind; it was majestic; her noble features
were animated by the sublimity of her
soul; her cyes darted at once, sparkling
intelligence, and grandeur of sentiment;
her fair cheek, unlike the ruddy moun-

taineers', was of the white rose teint; it
spoke a charming pensiveness ; and over
her whole appearance was diffused a
dignified grace that showed a soul at
ease with itself. As a fair lily flourishes
beneath the shielding umbrage of some
spreading oak, so did she flourish be-
neath the eye of a father, cherished by
his anxious love, and shielded by his
care.
Count Angelo D'Albini, the stranger
who had sought shelter beneath
the roof of this peaceful pair, was of
noble family, and possessed of an exten-
sive fortune. His father, by birth an Ita-
lian, had married a young English female,
of considerable rank, who had become
known to him in England, during a tem-
porary residence of pleasure there; un-
able, however, to obtain her hand, but
by consenting to remain in England, he

acceeded to the condition, (for to resign
her was from the question) and fixed his
residence in the place of her nativity.
One son only was the fruit of this mar-
riage; he was the hope and idol of the
house. Count D'Albini lived only to be-
hold him enter his twenty-fifth year, when
he paid the debt of nature, and, in less
than another year, was followed to the
grave by his wife, who had remained in-
consolable for his loss : Thus, in the full
bloom of youth, and pride of fortune,
Angelo beheld himself almost alone in
the world, (for so may he be considered
who has no human being to whom he is
united by the tender ties of consan-
guinity.) These melancholy events ha-
ving so rapidly succeeded each other, fil-
led him with a melancholy, which the dis-
sipation of the gay metropolis was power-
less to divert; he determined, therefore,
to quit the dull round of unsubstantial

pleasures, and irrationaldelights, (the very
repetition of which rendered them dis-

a mode of life, if not more useful, less uni-
form at least, and boasting the charm of
novelty; he resolved on travel, and quito
ting England, he visited Paris, where he
remained till the same frivolous pursuits,
noise, and folly, reminded him of the
scenes he had quitted. He next passed into
Italy; the demon of disgust followed him
there. Failing of finding the variety he
had sought, from change of place, where
the similarity of the scenes, the same
gay nothing's pervading, rendered it 
change of place only, without a change
of pleasures, his thoughts wandered
beyond the careless circle of society, and
in the wills of animated nature, in the
independent majesty of solitude, he con-
ceived that he should find those pure

periencing in the idle clamour of the
giddy world.
Thus, then, he abandoned for a time,
his gay connections, and the crowd of
beings, who, while they complain that
life is short, are ever busily employed in
destroying time, to breathe at large
among the mountains of Switzerland, and
to presume to think, amid the expansive
waste of his silent scenery, and romantic
beauties. Thither, ever accustomed to
yield to his first impulses, and to regard
his own will as law, he quickly trans-
ported himself. For a while he wandered
delighted o'er Geneva's majestic lake; he
coasted along its borders, enraptured at
the rich and varied prospects he beheld,
where nature has done so little, and man
has effected so much; where cultivation
reveals her stores, and where the lately
barren rock now smiles in the green trea-

with joy the first appearance of a human
habitation ; he hastened towards it, and

without otherwise announcing himself,
according to the established custom among
the hospitable Swiss, than by simply lift-
ing the latch which fastened the door, (for
thus easily had he till now insured himself
a welcome) he requested, and instantly
obtained, admission beneath the roof of
Montmorency.
From the circumstance of having been
an only child, the count D'Albini, as is too
frequently the case, was loved by his parents,

like a scarce exotic, tenderly cherished,

content with beholding him an engaging

sought no further; no prominent vices, or
glaring imperfections, had hitherto de-
veloped themselves ; consequently, the de-

mark the limits between virtue and vice.
His heart was by nature generous, and
impassioned; but, proper education having
never corrected the exuberance of these
feelings, they had degenerated into vices,
while the germs of many virtues became
withered in his breast. A good action
was with him an impulse, not a principle; if
he acted wrong, it was involuntarily, from
the want of due reason, or just discrimi-
nation for his guide: when made sensible
of any impropriety of conduct that, in
its effects, had been productive of injury
to others, the regret which he felt was
only to be equalled by his anxiety to re-
pair the mischief. Thus, often his very
faults seemed graceful in him, as they
were accompanied by virtues, which were
attendant upon them, and which could
not otherwise have existed.  Weak, vola-

least thought of dishonor, and a suscepti-

him alive to his error, was continually lead-

ever followed his faults, and
faults again succeeded to the upbraidings
of his conscience : all his sensations were,
however, too transient; his pliable feelings,
like the fickle reed to the wind, yielded
radily, to every allurement; his wishes
were his guides, and the decision of one
moment was ever in danger of being bro-
ken, by the temptation of the next.--Thus
was his character a mixture of good and
evil ; while he charmed the undiscrimina-
ting part of society, by the frankness,
naivet, and gracefulness of his manners,
'he ravished admiration from the wiser part;

CHAPTER II.
On the morning succeeding to the arri-
val of the Count D'Albini at the cottage
of Montmorency, Gabrielle, as was her
custom, rose at an early hour to pursue
her customary avocations. D'Albini, awa-
kening at a time at which it had been
more usual for him to retire to repose, rose
likewise, and perceived from his lattice the
fair daughter of Montmorency tending the
little garden which spread its green carpet
on a small spot of the rugged rock, and
flowered along the sides of a frowning
precipice. Struck with the beautiful
simplicity of her appearance, which, instead
of detracting from, added a singular charm

to her majestic figure, he stepped back a
few paces, for the purpose of contem-
plating her unobserved ; for Angelo did
not pride himself on possessing the vulgar
effrontery which can look on modest beauty
with the bold star of avowed libertinism.
When Gabrielle turned her face towards
him, its sweet and noble expression,
energetically animated, yet devoid of
boldness, conveyed a novel sensation to his
breast; his heart beat; a sensation of
shame assailed him, and this feeling was
occasioned by the reflection of what
women, how different in seeming to the
creature before him, had hitherto attracted
his admiration, and enslaved his senses.
"Ch, daugliter of innocence," he said to
himself, "if all women looked like you,
men would reform, and feeling in the pre-
sence of superior beings, abjure all guilty
thoughts."
## p. 27 (#35) ##############################################
THE LIBERTINE.
27
Such were the ideas of Angelo, and
involuntarily, in a moment, he found himself
at the side of her who had inspired them.
Scarcely would it be imagined, that, ha-
bituated so long to the great world, the
gay and admired Angelo should feel em-
barrassment in addressing a simple moun-
taineer ; yet such was in reality the case,
for the unaffected dignity of innocence
will ever inspire awe in minds the most
unfeeling or depraved. Gabrielle, who
felt only a natural timidity, resulting from
the circumstance of speaking, for the first
time, with any other man than her father,
replied to the confused observations of
Angelo with delicate reserve, yet without
shame, or hesitation ; his admiration
encreased ; and if the peculiar beauty which
belonged to her, had first charmed his
fancy, the unstudied elegance of her
manners now added to that sentiment a
feeling of surprise, and began powerfully
C 2
## p. 28 (#36) ##############################################

to interest the sensibility of a heart erer
alive to the attraction of female loveliness.
In Gabrielle he beheld a woman different
to any he had ever seen; therefore to her
other charins, in his eyes, she added that of
novelty; by her replies to his questions,
and from some few remarks that she
occasionally ventured of her own, he
moreover discerned, that she had a mind,
and that of itself was a novelty greater
than
any which he had ever yet discovered ;
for, till now, he had believed with the
Mahometans, that women had no souls;
in which idea, certainly, he had been
justified in his intercourse with such of the
sex as he had known. Gradually their
conversation assumed an interest; and, as
the eyes of Gabrielle sometimes met in
furtive glances the eyes of the traveller,
mentally she would say 66 and can this
man then recemble those monsters of
depravity, of whom my father has so often

29
spoken? If so, nature, inethinks, should
have fixed some mark upon them, or
rendered them less prepossessing."
Mean time Angelo, more and more
delighted, probably from the dificulty le
perceived of prolonging liis pleasure, was
considering what plea he could invent for
remaining some time at the cottage of
Montnorency. The good Swiss, with
whom he had occasionally sojourned
during his tour, had ever pressed him to
extend his stay beyond the period of his
inclination, but with Montmorency he
feared it would be different; for his
dignified air, his look of proud superiority,
stamped hiin of a class above those beings
ainong whom he had chosen to fix his
residence. With him, therefore, he felt
that unqualified freedom would be mis-
placed, or be esteemed presumption; and
his mind became on the rack to discover
C3

THE LIBERTINE.
what line must be pursued to facilitate his
wishes.
While thus ruminating, Montmorency
appeared, coming froin the cottage. On
beholding the stranger with his daughter,
he involuntarily started, and a shadow of
displeasure passed over his features. He
advanced towards them hastily, and taking
the arm of Gabrielle, was in an instant,
without seeming to purpose it, between
her and Angelo ; on the latter, as he
returned his salutation, he cast a look of
coolness and distrust, as though he would
have said, " You are of the world, and I
dread you." With pain did Angelo observe
this expressive, glance; he felt dispirited,
but not discouraged; he entered into
conversation with Montmorency ;' his
natural politeness, aided by the interest he
felt in gaining the good-will of 'His host,
made it gradually agreeable to him; and by

little
and little, the anxious Angelo
succeeded in drawing him from the in-
trenchment of his reserve: at length he
ventured a remark on the sublimely beau-
tiful situation of Meillerie. Montmorency,
to whom its beauties were familiar,
coolly acquiesced; next he reverted to his
cottage, its magnificent views, the salubrity
of the air ; with equal indifference Mont-
morency acquiesced. " How happy should
I be," cried Angelo, involuntarily looking
towards Gabrielle, " to live and die in
such a spot as this."
A sceptic smile was the only answer of
Montmorency
" Might I hope," pursued Angelo, re-
solved, since he had proceeded thus far, to
make a grand effort, " might I hope, for
permission to remain your guest a few
days?"
## p. 32 (#40) ##############################################
THE LIBERTINE.
Distrust darkened again the brow of
Montmorency ; the sceptic smile was suc-
ceeded by a piercing look ; and, as he half
bowed, lis air of constraint marked how
inimical to his wish was the desire of the
stranger. Feeling it necessary, however,
to make some reply; " You would soon
be weary of this place," he said; " and
be more anxious to quit it, than you are
at present to remain."
Impossible !' exclaimed Angelo, with
vivacity; and checking what further hover-
ed on his lips.
Montmorency looked at him more pene-
tratingly than before.
65 If such be the
case," he emphatically observed, " then
must you have some motive of which I am
not aware."
"Why should
you
think so ?" with deep
embarrassinent, enquired Angelo.
## p. 33 (#41) ##############################################
THE LIBERTINE.
" Because men do not abandon their
Irabits, or their prejudices, without some
strong inducement; that inducement, for
the most part, is the suggestion of some
secret interest."
At this plain language, to which An-
gelo was unused, his ingenuous cheek
became slightly suffused ; and with conse
quent hesitation he replied, " I am not
aware indeed of any interest I could
derive from receiving your permission to
remain with you a short time, excepting?
the pleasure I must naturally experience
from being in such society."
In this answer Angelo had adhered to
truth. Montmorency, sceptic as he was,
felt an emotion of regret at his uncalled-for
severity; and, stretching forth his hand to
Angelo, he said, ". There sceins honesty
in your manner ; though too well I know,

many seem honest, that are not so. Since
you desire it, I will endeavour for a few
days to render your stay here as agreeable
to you as I can."
Angelo bowed with a smile of gratitude
and joy, which lighted up his fine features
with an additional beauty; the preceding
harshness of Montmorency was forgotten,
and an expressive silence spoke his thanks.
No sooner, however, had these few words
of comparative complacency escaped the
lips of the suspicious Frenchman, than
instantly he repented of them, and the
transient ray of sunshine was succeeded
by the most frozen constraint.
Angelo, beginning'now to perceive some
thing of the character of his host, appeared
not to remark this change; he talked on
various topics, and was not discomfited by
the observations, sometimes severe, oftener

just, by which he was answered. On re-
ceiving permission to remain beneath his
roof, he had thought it incumbent on him
to state explicitly his naine, situation, and
rank in life, his motives for travelling, &c.
Montmorency listened in silence, and then
" You are of the great world, Conte
D'Albini, and yet seek a solitude so little
appropriate ? how may this be? for you
are yet too young, too little experienced,
to have become disgusted with society;
consequently, however we might approve
our guest, we could not long flatter our
selves with enjoying his company."
Ah,' replied Angelo," never could I
be weary of society so refined as this ; yet,
Frankly I own, that I am not absolutely
disgusted with the world."

eynic laugh, " I will be sworn you are not;

" We should not be too fastidious about
the things of this life," answered Angelo,
gaily, "I think the world, with all its in-
conveniences, a most bewitching place.
What would you more? Pleasure on all
sides, and pleasure of every description,
courts the acceptance of him who is blest
with independence; the most delicious
fruits for his palate, rational enjoyments
for his mind, lovely beings for his softer
passions, friends for his sober reason."

Montmorency" although I know man-

cruelty, and illiberality; it does no justice
to motives; it decides by effect, and not by
eause; it condemns misfortune, as if it,
were a crime; it worships greatness, as if it
were a virtue; it is uninterested in your
miseries, and interested in your welfare
only, in hopes of pleasure or benefit to
self. Self is the predominant idea, self
is the darling theine, self is the focus to:

we be free from the contagion of example,
and enjoy a comparative felicity."
Oh, cease!" cried Angelo, shocked
at the picture,
" in mercy cease ; let me
partake of your solitude, let me" His
eyes met those of Gabrielle, and he could
not proceed, while she, unknowing why,
blushed deeply as she marked his hesita-
tion. Montmorency observed both; his
penetrating eye caught the lucid beam of
Angelo's, as it withdrew from commingling
with his daughter's; and, in an expressive
voice, he said, "i Do you think then,
Count D'Albini, that my system of self is-
so very erroneous ?"He paused; then
added,-" Do you think that my society
alone would be "charm sufficient to attract
you to this solitude ?"

graceful naivet, " that is asking a most
malicious question. Can it be doubted, that
society, such asitis at present, is too precious
to be diminished, and requires no addition?"
Montmorency sighed, asin his brood-
ing mind he began to revolve over,
and lament, the, various motives and
passions which incessantly actuate the
heart of man. Yet, gloomy and sceptical
as he was, there was a-something in An-
gelo with which he could not avoid being
pleased,a warmth,' a sincerity, an en-
thusiasn, 'resembling what he had himself
possessed, before ill treatment, and long
seclusion from society, had obliterated in
his heart all but the remembrance of
what he once was. While he pitied the
sanguine hopes, and vain delusions, of his
guest, which prompterl him to dress the
world in its gayest colours, he could not
avoid seeing they had their source in a
heart as yet not infinitely polluted; and surely,

thought he, better thus, than one out
of love with the world, disgusted with
human nature, supposing intended treach-
ery in every appearance of friendship,
and, to guard against deception, be the first
to deceive. Montmorency easily perceived
that he had cast a damp over the warm
imagination of the young enthusiast, and
this very circumstance caused him to regard
him with additional interest ; for men in-
sensibly feel a complacency for those who,
appear impressed by their opinions, or con-
vinced by their arguments.
At least
then," thought he, " this youth, so far
from being corrupted by the example of
others, is scarcely aware of their depravity;
ignorance in this case is comparative virtue;
he is not therefore, as yet, to be classed
among the herd." Short-sighted philoso-
pher, as though it were impossible that
man should be vicious from other causes,
than the mere influence of example !

CHAPTER III.
ANGELO succeeded completely in his
views; Montmorency not only yielded
to his earnest desire, of being permitted
to prolong his stay with him for a few
days, but, when at the end of that in-
definite period, Angelo spoke not of
departing, Montmorency, though he
conceived the propriety of the move-
ment, could not compel himself to urge
it. Spite of his systematic reserve, he
began again to taste the charm of society,
of conversing with a human being of
his own sex, of a superior mind, of
polished taste, of manners elegant and
refined; sometimes he reproached him.

self for the irresistible pleasure which lie
took in the company of the being chance
had thrown in his way. Ile feared lest he
should cause him to deviate in his abhor-

cry,
"I cannot be deceived
in this youth; but, if I am, what matter?
I seek no friendship from him ; I place
no reliance, I expect no favor, what, if
he be even 'a villain at heart, which I
think improbable; circumstances will
never place it in his power to make me a
sufferer; the entertainment of his com-
pany I may use without danger, as froin
poison the chemist extracts a salutary
medicine." But Montmorency did not
consider, that confidence grows from:
association; that, from long indulgence
in luxury, it becomes necessary; nor,

from a view of relative situations, could
he pierce into the future, or discern the
probable arrival of a period in which
he might bitterly repent having, in a
single instance, deviated from the reso-
lution he had formed, of never more suf-
| fering' his heart to relax, or his opinion to
vary, in favor of any human being
whatever.
Meantime, the fair and innocent
Gabrielle became sensible of a species
of happiness, different from any she
had ever yet experienced, and which,
from its novelty, delighted. She en-
joyed a sort of halcyon pleasure, which,
to dissipate, it were only necessary for
her to anticipate the departure of Angelo.
When she thought on this, a deep sigh
rose involuntarily from her heart; she
felt a void there, as though suddenly
she had lost a dear friend, --even as she

conceived she might feel, if she were
to lose her father. At this depressing
idea, surrounding objects seemed di-
vested of every charm; occupations,
which formerly had attached her with
interest, now lost their power to please;
nay, often her employment was thrown
aside; and, with her head languidly
leaning on her hand, she contemplated
the image of Angelo, scarcely conscious
perhaps that she had done so, till roused
by his presence into painful confusion.
Unsophisticated Gabrielle ! she knew
love only in its feeling, and knew not
yet that it was love; it was, with her,
a pure emanation of the soul; a refined
mysterious sentiment, that disordered her,
she knew not how, with an emotion she
could not define. In her breast it was
delicacy's self, divested of every degrad-
ing or ignoble idea attendant upon that
passion, in minds less pure, contaminated

too by more intimate acquaintance with
1. its effects on the minds of others. Yet
still in this genuine, uncorrupted state,
was it conceived with a degree of enthu-
siasm, of ardour that, even in infancy,
gave warning of the pitch to which it
- must arrive, if thus proportionably en-
creasing, till it reached its climax; if,
indeed, it be possible to define the pre-
001| cise period at which love may be said to
have attained its climax, in certain minds.
Nor was this evolution in the mind
of Gabrielle surprising; nurtured and
educated in profound seclusion, be-
holding no one in the semblance of man,
save a few Mountaineers, blunt and un-
prepossessing in their manners and ap-
pearance, having no society, save that of
her venerable father, or occasionally of
a respectable female, who resided nearest
to them. The majestic Montmorency,
whose noble, yet care-worn features,

whose silver hair, whitened by the joint
power of grief and age, whose fine figure
yet slightly bending from the same cause,
could scarcely give her an idea of a being
possessing the grace, elegance, and beauty
of Angelo; consequently her surprise be-
ing stronger, the feelings that accom-
panied it were stronger likewise. Thus
total seclusion from the world has its
dangers, if not similar, yet not inferior,
to those that may be incurred by too
close an intercourse with it.
Some weeks elapsed, and Angelo was
still an inmate at the cottage of Mont-
morency; Montmorency endeavouring
to shut the eyes of his mind against the
pleasure he took in his society,
and Gabrielle, in her virgin breast, fond-
ly cherishing the dangerous image that
now revelled there uncontrouled. The

heart of Angelo, too, participated in the
havoc he had caused; a passion wilder,
fiercer, less refined then hers, internally
consumed him ; his
person underwent
some change; he became pale and hag-
gard, while fanned by the breezes of
health, and Montmorency expressed
apprehension, that the keen air of the
mountains, where he dwelt, was too
powerful for him. Thus the mind of
man, by a resistless infatuation, often
blindly leads him to his own destruc-
tion. Montmorency, from extending
his ideas further than his reason could
profit by them, by including in his con-
demnation and mistrust the whole of
mankind, forgot carefully to examine
the limited sphere wherein he moved,
and to guard against those nearer evils,
which he viewed so clearly at a distance.

the course of the heavens, beholds not

in the valley, anticipating the distant
storm, sees not the overwhelming ava-
lanche, that rushes down the mountain's
steep.
One day Gabrielle, overcome more by
the intenseness of her own sensations
than actual weariness, seated herself in
a rocky recess, there to muse in secret
over the terrible feelings that oppressed
her; for the calniness of the first infancy
of her love had now passed by ; it was no
more a gentle and delicious sensation,
but a turbulent and uneasy passion, that
blended itself with every idea, that
monopolized cvery feeling, that made
every former pleasure appear inane and
wearisome, that distracted her mind by
day, and revelled in her dreams by night.
Sudelenly the object of her thoughts
appeared before her.
Gabrielle was

frequently in the habits of walking with
Angelo; often, too, the conversation would
involuntarily become so mutually inte-
resting, that, on her side at least, a pause
of confusion would ensue. She did not
shun him, for she was unconscious of
artifice; but she started and arose, for
she feared lest the tender trouble of her
heart should be discovered through her
eyes. Angelo gently took her hand, and
walked on with her in silence, as he
contemplated the celestial beauty which
innocence diffuses over those with whom
it dwells. Something of vague. com-
punction shot through his heart, as
involuntarily he asked himself the
question, of what he could propose by the
indulgence of the passion which occupied
him? The pang was, however transient,
expelled from his brast by sensations
more welcome, though more dangerous.
He desired ardently to make known

the extent of them to the object that
had inspired them, and to ascertain how
far they were returned.
Though his eyes had already told
the fair girl that no common feelings
actated him towards her, though her's
had already betrayed to him, that the soft
confession was not received without the
deepest emotion; yet, so full of vanity is
the heart of man, that it is not enough for
him to feel that he is loved? he must have
a direct avowal of it, for sweet is the offer-
ing that is accompanied with such incense.
At length, unable to restrain the powerful
sensations that battled in his bosom for
vent, he suddenly stopped, almost resist-
lessly urged to give them expression ; but
he found the attempt vain; for it was
not that pride, dignity, or 'severity,
awed him in Gabrielle; it was her inno-
cence, her agitation, the result of the
urest modesty that was depicted in her

countenance, that he feared to offend,
and which took from him the power of
prosecuting his wish. Unable to declare
his love, unable even to utter a word, he
cast himself at her feet, and, fixing his
eyes upon her countenance, endeavoured
to temper even the ardour of their
glances, lest they should convey to her
chaste bosom anger or alarm.
Gabrielle, ready to sink into the earth,
dared not behold him; her eyes
wandered
round in search of relief, and momenta-
rily fixed upon every object, save the eyes
of Angelo, which she dreaded to encounter.
At this moment, when the hearts of both
overflowed with the sweetest and most
dangerous sensations, when conviction
was on the verge of being conveyed from
each to the other, of the strongest and
most ardent love, at that very moment
Montmorency appeared, descending the

rock on which they were. Gabrielle,
overwhelmed with the first painful con-
fusion that attends the fear of having
acted wrong, hastened forward to join
him, while Angelo followed her foot-
steps, ncertain whether to grieve, or to
rejoice at the interruption, and said in a
low voice as he drew near her, " do not,
dearest Gabrielle, appear as if flying from
me; uneasy ideas will be instilled into the
mind of your father." Involuntarily
Gabrielle slackened her pace, while a
feeling of troubled delight thrilled
through her breast, at the tender appella-
tion bestowed on her by Angelo.
The good Montmorency saw them
advancing together, but saw no more;
three score winters, and the tears that he
had shed, had not improved the brilliancy
of his sight. He began to consider

beings, so little contaminated by the vices

therefore beheld their approach withi
pleasure, unalloyed by suspicion, and
welcomed them with a smile..
Entering immediately into conversa-
tion with Angelo, Gabrielle had sufficient
time to recover herself, and to collect hier
scattered ideas. Angelo had confessed to
her nothing; he had not spcken, but in his
silence there was an eloquence, at least
to her heart, that spoke enough. She
endeavoured to join in the conversation,
but the effort was feeble, and attended
with embarrassinent. Soon, therefore, as
they reached the cottage, she took the
first opportunity of escaping to the soii-
tude of her chanzber. Here, a burst of
tears relieved her full-charged heart; she

followed by a transport so exquisite, that
her whole frame trembled: then unde-
fined terrors, doubts, and apprehensions
succeeded to her happiness; peace ap-
peared for ever banished from her bosom,
and the most gloomy terrors crowded, in
sad perspective, on imagination's eye.
But still, still, her fascinated heart re-
verted to the fond idea, which formed now
the chief, nay only interest of her life;
on that she paused, on that she dwelt,
till the very excess of the delight she
experienced awakened her again to re-
newer pain, to the agonizing thought
of the time when it should exist no
longer, or to the tormenting fear, that
all was even now but sweet delusion,

the virgin surprised by love, and pierced,
as in revenge, by the most terrible of
his darts. Though no direct confession
had escaped the lips of either, yet there
now appeared a sort of mutual under-
standing between the hearts of both;
the words, ' I love,' seemed unnecessary
to be uttered by either, for the meaning
of those words was sufficiently expressed
in their looks, their eyes, their manners
towards each other. Yet, though both
fondly loved, how differently did they
love; Gabrielle, with all the enthusiasm,
purity, and warmth of an innocent heart,
Angelo with all the wildness, furor, and
uncontrolled passion of one accustomed
to give the reins to inclination, and
rushing to attain the object of his wishes.
The love of Gabrielle was such as an
angel necd not have blushed to know;
that of Angelo, such as a mortal should
endeavour to overcome. :

When souls once understand each
other, the reciprocation of love is un-
confined ; it emanates in the tenderest
expressions, in a resistless interchange
of sentiments. Could Gabrielle have
lived always thus, in the presence of
the object beloved, gazing on his counte-
nance, listening to each word fondly trea-
sured, he imagined, that she could have
been for ever happy; but Angelo, whose
passion had increased, not only beyond
his power, but beyond his wish to conquer,
resolved that she must become his.
The constant view of an object
that had inspired him with sensations
so ardent, who was near, and yet

sent sensations obtain the mastery over
every other consideration, that he deter-
mined at once to make known to her,
the state of his mind, while an idea, (as
yet to himself, even vague and indefinite)
of some attempt to prove the extent of
his power over her heart, glanced through
his mind. Hurried on by his invincible
impulses, he seized the first moment,
when he beheld her alone, and, after:
endeavouring, in compliance with her;
evident wish, to converse with, and :
answer her, upon a few uninteresting
topics, he suddenly exclaimed, seizing
her hand, with impatience: :" But: all

fully to comprehend that pangs might be

to love my father, but in loving you, I
sometimes feel a pain."
The eyes of Angelo sparkled with fond
conviction; he gazed in the face of
Gabrielle, and, in a faultering voice, he
said, 6. Will

Gabrielle; " I think my heart is your's,

her bosom..

But though Angelo gave utterance to
the term wife, he meant such as it is un-
derstood only in the language of love, not
as it is considered in the estimation of the
world; yet, to the chaste ears of Gabrielle,
he durst not offer a word bearing other than
honorable construction. Gabrielle paused
a while, and then said, " And from what
you have observed, Angelo, how am I to
infer that
you
wish me to act ?"
" Dare I say, Gabrielle ?-hear me

It was the pure, the guiltless
innocence of Gabrielle ; but, though in-

father. She did not start back, like a
world-taught heroine, in affected surprise,

but she remained motionless at the last
words of Angelo; she remained rooted to
the spot, as though her reluctant feet durst
no longer assimilate their movements to
his. In her countenance was depicted
scorn and resentment; she regarded him
steasily, and the stern expression of her
features gave way gradually to a marked
sorrow, as though she grieved for him,
that he should be a creature so base.
" Poor, poor, Angelo!" at length she
said, and hurried onwards.
In an instant the precipitate Angelo was
sensible of his error; he felt that he was
lowered in the esteem of Gabrielle, and
that he had alarmed the genuine delicacy
of her virtue, and sound principles. He'
rushed after her, and, in the most impas-
sioned language, implored forgiveness.

all the virtue of his mistress, and res-

love, the heart of woman is weak, contrary to
the suggestions of her better reason; when
at length she turned her eyes upon him,
and beheld his countenance suffused with
tears, the deep contrition, and the grief
that was depicted in it, she felt a strong
wish to extend her hand towards him, and
pronounce, " I forgive you, Angelo, and
pity your errors." In all probability, she
would have yielded to the powerful plead-
ings of her heart in his favor, which would
have compromised her own dignity, and

given Angelo too great an advantage
over her, had not her guardian angel,
once more, in the shape of her father,
interposed to prevent this act of weak-
ness, and yet a little delay her advance-
ment in the path of danger.
Now, with the gratitude of an inno-
cent and pious mind, she beheld his
approach ; for, however she might have
perceived him before, under the convic-
tion of having done wrong, she now felt
that his appearance had preserved her from
the commission of an error. To Angelo,
however, it conveyed a two-fold pain;

gelo felt strongly that he was acting a
base and dishonourable part, and the blan-
dishment of his heart could not bring
over his reason to tell him otherwise.
But, though he felt that his passion, if
indulged, would bear down all before it,
either he had not, or would not, find
arguments to overcome it; he had neither
courage to fly, nor to desist, and, while
guilt stared him in the face, while re-
morse pressed heavy on his soul, he madly
permitted its violence to conquer and
drag him onwards.

CHAPTER IV.
To dwell on subjects that cause us to
abhor human nature, and dread to asso-
ciate with civilized man, can surely con-
vey, no pleasure in the perusal, nor,
in
the present system of things, be pro-
ductive of benefit. Let us, therefore,
pass lightly over details that have no
useful tendency, and revert to events,
which almost justified the distrust and
misanthropy that so long had governed
the mind of the unhappy Montmorency,
and which, perhaps, it had been better
for him had he still persevered in. 
Suffice it then to say, that Angelo daily

wishes becoming less formidable. The love
of Gabrielle acquiring fresh force, though
the suggestions of her virtue became not
weaker, rendered the task of conquering
it more and inore difiicuit.

Angelo had
far perceived his
power over her heart, that he had
dared a second time to hazard to her
the proposal of quitting her father's
roof, but this was again received indig-
nantly, with bitter reproaches, and with
tears of burning anguish, to see herself
so fallen in the estimation of the man
she loved ; that at this late period, when
he should have known her better, he
still should presume to think her capable
of sin so abominable. Thus she thought,
yet still she listened to, and forgave
more readily than before the man who
could thus presume. Angelo perceived,

and availed himself of every increasing
advantage, and pressed the subject with
renewed ardour; but no, though far ad-,
vanced in the path of error, though
tottering on the brink of a deceitful
precipice, though feeble from the ex-
cess of her love, she had still virtue
enough to hear this proposal with hor-
ror, and to reject it with firmness. What!
desert her venerable father? the fond
guardian of her childhood, the tender
friend of her youth; abandon him ;
abandon that faded, that majestic form,
which now seemed to stand accusingly
before her? Deprive him of the sweet

thought. Could such an image dare then
for an instant to present itself before a
mind once so pure ? But one step re-

fether. She turned this idea in her mind,
but abandoned it with terror, at having
proceeded so far; the shame attendant
upon such a confession, the dread of
the reproaches, but more of the misery of
Montmorency; above all, a latent unac-
knowledged fear, which shook her inmost
soul, that she should then be for ever torn
from the object of her fatal love, prevented
her from yielding to this safe suggestion
of her better reason.

for ever of the valued treasure of a daugh-

To attempt description of the feelings
of one, who, till this fatal period, had been
sinless, even in idea,to paint the horror

remorse told her loudly of her guilt, while
that guilt infatuated too much to be ab-

complish. The temptation to evil once
admitted, it is no longer easy to repel its
insidious advances ; a dreaded step once
taken, another quickly follows; and the
wretched victim of error seldom awakens,
till repentance is in vain. Thus, with the
unhappy Gabrielle ;-miserable, degraded
in her own eyes, having plunged in an
ocean of guilt, she continued to sail amid
its dangerous straits ; the sun of delusion

roused to the full horror of her situation,
till, like a thunder clap sounding in her
ears, the voice of Angelo spoke of his
departure.
For some moments the power of speech
was denied her ; when, at length, she re-
covered the power, she had not the wish
to speak, a deadly chill crept through
her blood, an universal weakness trembled
through her frame, her mouth became
parched, now her cheek turned of an ashy
paleness, and now flushed with the crimson

she did not even look at

Angelo beheld her agitation ; he took
her hand, " Why are you thus, my love?"

Gabrielle shook her head, but replied
not.

Why, then," proceeded he," this
apparent unhappiness ? you always knew,
fair Gabrielle, that I could not remain for
ever here."
True, true;" faltered Gabrielle, look-
ing at him, and turning hastily away:
" We may meet again, my love, under
happier auspices."
Gabrielle clasped her hands in silent
agony; the tears rolled down her cheeks,
and again she ventured a glance at
Angelo.

He pressed her hand; "Say, then, shall
we go together ?"
Gabrielle withdrew her hand; and, though
Angelo made the proposal, who shall say,
that now, as eagerly as ever, he desired that
she should accede to it?  Oh, Angelo !"
she indignantly exclaimed, "is this con-
solation ?"
Really, dearest Gabrielle, you are not,
yourself to-day ; why thus unkind; why
thus disposed to reject, with scorn, all I can
say?"
" Miserable, yet justly, punished wretch
that I am!" cried Gabrielle, and quick-
ened her steps. Angelo followed, but not
with quite such eager anxiety as once he
had followed her with, when involuntarily
he had offended her; " Come, dearest Ga-
brielle," he cried, "sweet girl, be reason-
able;" then, willing to divert her grief, he

ture ---I would venture now, you will
soon forget me."
" Oh, this is too cruel," exclaimed
Gabrielle, bursting into tears, " Oh God,
I begin to feel that my father, my
dear
father, spoke not too severely of man."
Angelo was affected, not at her tears so
much, but she had interested his feelings
through the medium of his self - love ;
the heart of man is often vulnerable
through that medium, when it can be
touched through no other; he saw that
Gabrielle really loved him, and was tor-
tured at the thought of his departure. He
instantly seized her hand again, and falling
at her feet, implored forgiveness for an
unintentional offence, swore that he loved
her with an unabated passion, and would
not rise till she had sealed his pardon.

Gabrielle sighed, " Where do you go

" To Italy, where certain connec-

my stay desirable for some time."
A weight of ice fell upon the heart
of Gabrielle ; Angelo could talk of being
happy, of being so without her !-A new
world opened to her view; a world of
misery; hur doom--a dreadful doom, seem-
ed fixed; she was no longer what she had
been,- peaceful because innocent. She felt
a wretch, and felt, by anticipation, what
despair would be hers, when left in the
terrible solitude of guilt, to her reflections.
The heart of Angelo was not systema-
tically bad; he erred from the want of
firm principle, and persisted in his errors
from want of energy to combat them. The

such as is frequently met with among
men; some few perhaps better, more
infinitely worse; many possessing his

He had told Gabrielle that he loved her,
and he had told her truth, to the extent
of which his soul was capable, for de-
ception was foreign to his nature. That
he did not love her with that delicate,
refined; and rare affection of which
superior minds alone are capable, waz
not attributable to him as a fault ; he
loved her more than he had ever before

knew not vice, and whose eyes had
never beheld it, loved differently; her's
was an ardent, pure, and unsophisticated
passion, which, having taken root in a rich
native soil, was calculated to exist, while
she existed, strong and immutable. Over
the conviction of her love she shed

artless to be dangerous; he did not
take into his calculation, that Gabrielle,
from her inexperience, required no
artifice to be misled; he did not remember
that from that very inexperience she
would be unable to judge but from
appearance, to penetrate into motives, or
to draw correct deductions ; above all,
he forgot,for he was not of an age
when those ideas present themselves
forcibly to the mind,--he forgot the
danger attendant upon the circumstance
of her being a stranger to man, till one
the most engaging in form and manners
presented himself to her astonished view.
In the world he dreaded, Montmorency
would have been the guardian of his
daughter, because in the mass of man-
kind, he would have prepared himself
to encounter the greater part villains ;

the innocence of the one, and guilelessness
of the other, were sufficient security for
the safety of his child, he did not, in all
the severity of his judgment of society,
conceive that there existed a creature base
enough, under such circumstances, to
repay
his trust with treachery and ingra-
titude: he did not consider that man
became as often base from weakness as
from depravity, and that even the firmest,
and best-intentioned minds are not always
proof against the powerful temptation of
combining circumstances. Thus is it ever
with short-sighted mortals, who, shielding
themselves by the strong habergeon of
caution and mistrust, are assailed in a path
where least they dreamt of danger, and,
vanquished in points which were consi-
dered too insignificant to guard. Thus too
with Montmorency, who, while cautiously
guarding the out-posts, admitted the
enemy into the camp.

Some time had now elapsed since the
departure of Angelo from the cottage
of Meillerie, but its inhabitants were
no longer in the state he had found

In vain did the distracted Gabrielle
endeavour to consider the best steps to
pursue; her mind was chaos, and she
could not organize it to reflect. First,
she imagined to quit the roof of her still
unconscious father, and save him the
dreadful pang that
that knowledge of her
guilt must inflict; but then again, this,

endurance; her form faded, her melan-
choly became uninterrupted by even occa-
sional attempts at vivacity, and the hap-
less Montmorency, catching the infection
of her gloom, resigned himself to a
hopeless woe, which seemed neither to
expect or look for termination but in
the grave.
It was the sight of this awful grief
that increased the sufferings of the
wretched daughter; add to all, Angelo
had now
been three months absent.
During that space, she had heard from
him but once, and that in the first fort-
night after his departure. His letter theni
informed her of his arrival at Naples,
in what spot he had taken up his resi-,
dence, and that his stay in the country

rous connexions of his father, all anxi-
ous to pay him tribute, he could fix no

imagined it would not take place for
some months at least. He concluded by

intreaties to render her mind as happy as
possible, till propitious fate should permit
them to be re-united. To this letter Ga-
brielle had returned an answer, but not at
that time surmising her situation, had
merely expressed her deep sorrow at his
absence, the remorse and anguish which
preyed upon her mind, and conjured him to
write speedily, as his letters alone could
rouse her from the gloomy melancholy
that oppressed her. Unhappily, however,
with this pathetic entreaty on the part
of the forlorn Gabrielle, the correspon-
dence had ceased, and the wretched girl,
though necessarily uncertain of the fate
of her letter, felt too much pride, sup-

posing him to have received it, to trouble
with love-sick reproaches, a man who,
perhaps, desired to forget her. For the
same reason could she not consent to in-
form him, that forgotten as she might
be, her cruel fate ordained that in tender
anguish she should still remember him.
In truth, Angelo had received her
letter, received it too in a brilliant society,
and, retiring a moment, had hastily pc-
rused it; he had kissed it even, and
promised himself that ere he slept he
would answer it.
Overcome with
wine, however, he had retired to rest,
and forgotten his intention; he slept till
late the following morning, and scarcely
awoke in time to attend a party of plea-
sure, which had been planned the pre-
ceding evenirs. Pleasure, pleasure vary-

beauties present, eclipsed the memory of
an absent love ;, another, and another
day, and still something intervened to pre-
vent his writing. At length so many days
had elapsed, that when a spare half hour
did present itself, accompanied by the
recollection of his unperformed promise
to Gabrielle, the gay Angelo took up the
pen,' but suddenly decided, that now to
think of answering a letter so long ago
received, would lead Gabrielle to suppose,
that neglect or indifference alone could
have hitherto caused the delay. He
therefore determined, that he would wait
for another letter, and then answer that
on the instant; and perhaps, the vanity so
natural to man, made him desire this
additional proof of being fondly remem-
bered by the girl, whose superior love he
was so little capable of appreciating.
Meantime, great was the pain, and

bitter were the feelings which this un-
known arrangement, in the giddy mind of
Angelo, gave to the susceptible heart of
Gabrielle; yet did not Angelo intention-
ally inflict this pain, but purely from
not considering that he did so. Had
Gabrielle been with him, had she been
present, it is probable he would have still
loved, admired, and dedicated his fondest
moments to her ; but, immersed as he was
in voluptuous gaiety, he thought not often of
his poor girl of the mountains, who for
him had sacrificed all, and become a
wretch. The idea grew fainter and fainter
in his mind, and when he had leisure to
remember that she did not write, his
pride became offended at the omission,
and he considered himself now justified in
not having answered her first letter. Oh,
man! such is your cruelty and injustice; by
setting first the example of indifference,

Thus was Gabrielle left to pine unno-
ticed. Though Angelo possessed feelings,
they required to be roused; Gabrielle was
absent; her presence might have acted as
a stimulus, for in some respects Angelo
resembled the flint, which, to emit a spark,
requires the strong collision of the steel.

THERE was no human being with whom
: Montmorency himself associated, or per
mitted his daughter, save the female inha-
bitant of a cottage, situated a little way
down the rock on which his own was
built. This female, though amiable, and
by no means arrived at an age when the
pleasures, if any, of life have with some
lost their zest, lived in almost total seclu-
sion, justly considering herself superior
to the many that courted her society, among
whom were not wanting certain indepen-
dent' Mountaineers, who boasting of

the world boast of their gold, did not think
they presumed too highly in soliciting her
hand. But the good Madame Bertrand
had no desire to change her present free-
dom for the controul of a husband ; nei-
ther did her experience in a married life
render her wishful to enter again that state.
She, therefore, mildly declined all over-
tures, and resisted even the earnest entrea-
ties of Pierre Boffuet, the most ardent and
persevering of her admirers, to regard his
suit with more complacency than those
of his contemporaries. This worthy fe-
male, the steadiness and rationality of
whose character operated in her favour
with Montmorency, was occasionally a
guest at his cottage; but soon discovering
his fondness for solitude, and almost hatred
of society, her visits were sparing, and
never long. During the stay of Angelo
there, she had appeared but once; since
his departure, however, she had been

frequently, because her observation easily
informed her, that some secret grief lay
heavy at the heart of Gabrielle, and her
penetration led her to fear that the departed
guest was not unconnected with it. Often
in her walks with the silent and wretched
girl did she long, with the kind solicitude of
friendship, to hint at her apparent unhap-
piness, in order, if possible, to invite her
confidence, not from an idle or unworthy
curiosity, but in hopes that she might be
enabled to administer some consolation.

What would not the forlorn Gabrielle
have given for courage to repose her dread-

shame, horrible shame, prevented her.
Often some complaint, often a word rela-
tive to the subject of her misery, hovered
on her lips, but in the same instant her
heart beat with the increasing throb of
agony, her cheek became dyed with a burn-

perform the terrible office of divulging her
disgrace, cleaved, parched and trembling,
to the roof of her mouth. In the covert
of the woods, in the most solitary paths,
did she then alone dare to vent the lamen-
tations of her despair.
A little before his departure, Angelo, in
one of those moments of fondness, (which
amid the horrors that surrounded, still pre-
sented themselves before her with increased
fascination, and dazzled, as a bright dis-
tant fiame in a gloomy forest, her deluded
eyes,) had given her a medallion, surrounded
with diamonds, which presented on one side
the portrait of his mother, on the other
that of his father, and opening with a 
spring, disclosed within his own, de-
signed for him when a boy, with his
name, age, and date of his birth on the
opposite side. In giving to Gabrielle

from his bosom, where he had ever worn it,
" You, my dear Gabrielle, are the only
girl I ever loved; therefore, you alone
shall
possess the thing which I value most
in the world. It was given to me by a
dear, lamented mother, who idolized me,
a little before her death; because it bore
my picture, she had ever treasured it in
her bosom, and on presenting me with it,
said, " Never, Angelo, part with this but
to one you love as I love you." She loved
me to excess, Gabrielle,-as I love
you
now, therefore do I bestow her gift upon
you. Yet loving you as I do, I would not

Gabrielle took the offering with respect,
and answered, " I swear, Angelo, that I
will never part with this, but to one I shall
love as I do you;" thereby implying, that
she would keep it for ever, as she could
not conceive the possibility of ever loving
a human being as she did him. Angelo
understood her, and accepted, with an ex-
pressive smile, homage so grateful to his
feelings. On his portrait (for though
she often gazed with respectful interest
upon those of his parents, the medallion
was almost always open to gaze upon
his,) did she now breathe those tender
confessions of an unabated love, once
timially whispered to the original; on
those adored eyes, which she fancied re-
garded her with an answering look of love,
as in happier deluding days, shed bitter
tears, that were concealed from all others,
and to that beloved image alone, impart
her plaints, her anguish, and remorse.

The fourth month of the absence of
Angelo now drew towards a close; the
cheeks of Gabrielle became haggard and
pale, and the increasing change in her
slender elegant figure it became necessary
to conceal. Great was her terror, as she
perceived that no precaution would be long
sufficient to elude the anxious observation
of a father; and though, in the dreadful
anticipation of discovery, shame nearly
weighed her to the earth, still she'dreaded
less the confusion to herself than the
raging anguish that, well she knew, would
be inflicted
upon
him.
One night that they were sitting toge-
ther, Montmorency, as usual, reading, and
Gabrielle employed by his side, repres 
sing with her utmost efforts those tears
that rose incessantly to her eyes, Mont-
morency, without looking up, said, " Ga-

venerable and persive countenance, with-
ont her deep anguish bursting forth. She
stood beside him holding the glass; Mont-
morency put forth his hand, took it from
her, and as he was raising it to his lips,
his eyes glanced involuntarily over her
figure. Suddenly, like the lightning's flash,
the alteration struck him ; his eyes shot
rapidly from the figure to the face of his
daughter, and his fingers became nerveless ;
the glass fell to the ground, and, incapable of
giving utterance to his dreadful sensations,
his parched and trembling lips murmured
only," Gabrielle!"
My father !" cried Gabrielle, unable
to say more, as Montmorency, his eyes
still rivetted in horror upon her, sank back
in his chair, and gasped for breath.

Some minutes elapsed in this fearful
state of mutual agony. Montmorency re-
covered first; he struck his forehead in des-
pair !--the whole truth flashed at once
upon
his aching brain-Clasping his hands
together, he suddenly exclaimed, in a voice
which struck horror to the heart of Ga-
brielle,
" Poor girl ; poor girl ; thou art not to
blame."
It was the manner of his delivering
these words, more than the words them-
selves; it was the wild expression of his
countenance, which conveyed so dreadful
a sensation to the heart of Gabrielle.
She ventured, trembling, to take his hand,
and kneeling at his feet, bent down upon
it her fearful face. Montmorency laid his
other hand upon her head, and again
repeated, " Poor girl, poor girl."

At length it occurred to the unhappy
girl, that if her father would be prevailed
on to retire to bed, that rest and tran-
quillity might restore him. She took his
burning hand, " My father, shall I lead
you to your room ?" she said, while her
quick tears dropt upon the hand she held;
Montmorency, however, seemed insensible
to them, and in a faultering voice, she re-
peated her question. He then slightly
started, and arose as it were mechanically ;

Though Gabrielle left the room, it was
only from the idea, a terrible one indeed,
that her presence disturbed the spirits of
her father, which, perhaps, might regain
some composure in her absence; for her-

self, she thought not of bed, but deter-
mived to watch during the night in an ad-
joining chamber. She sat down accord-
ingly as near the door as possible, solitary,
forlorn, and in a state of mind that lan-
guage is powerless to describe. In a short
tiine, unable to rest tranquil, she gently
opened his door, and on tip-toe listened;
by his breathing she knew that he slept,
and, for this happy circumstance, in a
transport of gratitude she kneeled on the
threshold, and kissing the ground, re-
turned thanks to that supreme and mer-
ciful being whom, though deeply she had
offended, she still tremblingly adored, Still,

this was not the only sleepless night
which for months past had been the por-
tion of Gabrielle, she fell into a disturbed
slumber,
Soon she wakened in alarm, dreaming
her father called, and flew to his chamber.
What terror seized her, when she beheld the
bed empty; she hastened from the cottage
into the garden, and with comparative
joy descried him winding down the rock,
with footsteps slow and solemn. His cheek
was pale, his eyes were fixed on the earth,
and his arms were folded on his bosom.
Gabrielle ran towards him, and, with humi-
liated love, offered him her arm. Mont-
morency stopped a moment, looked at
her, sighed deeply, and shaking his head,
as if to' refuse her proffered assistance,
walked on.
The tender, yet reproachful look, the

expression of deep despair and anguish
with which he regarded her, was too much
for the already harrowed feelings of the
wretched Gabrielle, and she burst into
tears. Instantly Montmorency stopped
again, gazed on her with pity, and put
forth his hand. In an instant Gabrielle
was by his side, he spoke not, but accep-
ted the renewed offer of her arm.
During the whole of this miserable
day, Montmorency uttered not a word;
the next passed the same, and the next,
and the next; a certain number of hours he
slept ; sometimes he walked, and sometimes
he sat in a fixed attitude for hours together.
He took scarcely any nourishment, and never
at stated hours. A week, a month elapsed,
yet still no change; and the wretched
daughter at length acknowledged to her-
self with horror, that the inind of her
father was verging on confirmed melan-
choly madness.

.
In this dreadful situation the good
Madame Bertrand was her only conso-
lation. Now, no longer at leisure to
feel for herself, or if she did, hailing her
shame and confusion as expiatory pangs,
she no more refused to acknowledge
what was indeed incapable of further
concealment; she confided then, without
reserve, the whole of her unhappy secret
to this sympathising and only friend,
who promised, and who determined to
render her every assistance in her power.
Together they watched over Mont-
morency, together attended him; but
vain were all their cares; he seldom
repaid them by even a look of recog-
nition, much less a word.
It was the spring of the year, when
Angelo had arrived at Meillerie, and the
charms of the innocent Gabrielle were

divested of her richest beauty, and of
halcyon serenity of mind. Already
had she passed two months of the third
ra that was to usher into life a friend-
less being, whose existence would be
owing to her crime, and who might,
oh! dreadful thought, live to reproach
her as the cause. The progress of time,
by presenting more forcibly to her mind
the view of her guilt, increased her
wretchedness and remorse, whilst the
daily afflicting sight of her father's situa-
tion pointed every pang with redoubled
anguish.
The silence of Montmorency, with the
slight exception of now and then a
vague exclamation, had for long been
uniform; during the day he wandered,

heedless of the weather, among the
slippery rocks, sometimes accompanied
by Gabrielle, sometimes by Madame
Bertrand; when, however, they judged
from his manner, and his frequently
changing his path, that their society
was displeasing to him, or considered by
him as a presumptuous restraint, they
affected to leave him to himself, but
still followed and watched him at a
distance. As evening drew in he returned
home, and, seating himself silently by
the fire, either mechanically took a
book, or folding his arms upon his breast,
fell into an uneasy slumber. He appeared
not to take note of any thing that was
passing around him; his air was usually
wild, or abstracted, and though Gabrielle
could not bear to entertain the terrible
idea that he had utterly forgotten her,
she often more than feared that he did
not always know her,

That once proud and noble coun-
tenance which seemed to disdain, as it
repelled the thought of outrage, that
high and towering figure, which looked
contempt upon inferior beings, and over
which was diffused a sacred majesty
which commanded respect, now how
changed! Where was the expression of
those features ? pallid, wasted, wan, no
bright intelligence, no fierce conscious-
ness of superiority; his very
face bespoke,
even in the wreck of intellect, the deep
humiliation of his soul. His moody eyes,
now burning with a wild mclancholy
lustre, seemed as if desirous to pierce
through space, or, oftener bent on the
ground, seemed fearful to raise them on
the light; over that once open, and un-
shrinking front, now furrowed and con-
tracted, the silver hair hung scattered
and wild ; his figure, no longer haughty
and erect, attired in disorder, bent list-

less and inane; scarcely sensible he seemed
of existence; had he been more so, he
would have desired death.
At length, one evening, after sitting
for several hours in moping melancholy,
he fell into a deep sleep, that lasted a
considerable time. On awakening, the
first object he beheld was his daughter,
leaning over him in anxious solicitude ;
he fixed his eyes upon her, but no lon-
ger with that wild stare they had of
late worn.
When he looked towards her,
he gazed on her a few moments, and
started, as if now first beholding her
altered form ; then, passing his hand
across his eyes, he said, Ah, poor girl!
I remember-10, no, I do not blame
thee,-the fault is mine, all mine ; I feel
it here," he added, laying his land on
his heart ;-" but you forgive your
father, he little thought"-he pressed

his hand on his forehead, for a moment,
as in confusion, then resumed," fool, -
fool, that I was;" then again, regarding
her steadily, he exclaimed," how un-
just, to blame thee, poor girl !--come to
my arms, then, come, and let us mingle
our tears together."
So saying, he stretched forth his
arms; the overpowered Gabrielle rushed
into them, and once more her head
reposed on the paternal bosom. Too
happy, at this joyful return of something
like rationality, to remark the unconnec-
tedness and incoherence of some parts
of his speech, she wept the sweetest
tears that for long she had shed, and
wished even that he could shed some
likewise; but her wish was vain; for
though Montmorency had said, " let us
mingle our tears together," still was his
cheek unwet, and his eyes tearless.

By degrees, Gabrielle recovered suffici-
ently to gaze upon her father ; the sight
of his countenance shocked her, for there
was not in it the feeling air of recovered
reason, but, notwithstanding all he had
said, a fixed and dreary vacuum, a stern
insensibility, that bore no testimony to the
words he had uttered. In vain Gabrielle
endeavoured to rouse him ; if he for a
moment appeared affected by her efforts,
a smile which seemed rather only a relaxa-
tion of the muscles, than an emanation
from the heart, was the only evidence of
it. Still she fondly flattered herself with
the hope that, though for the present con-
fused, his mind would ultimately recover
its, torie, as he had certainly evinced strong
symptoms of recollection.
In a few moments Montmorency spoke
again. Pressing his hands upon his temples,

with a mournful smile.
" Come, my father ;" sobbed Gabrielle,
unable to return any answer to his pain-
ful remark, "come," and placing her arm
under his, she assisted him to rise.

form ;
no, no, poor girl, I want not
your assistance;" and trembling he rose,
leaning but slightly upon the slender arm
of Gabrielle.
She led him to his chamber; when he
reached the side of his bed he stopped,
as if exhausted, and said, looking upon
his daughter, " Gabrielle, I know what
would cure me."
" What, my father ?" eagerly asked
Gabrielle.
" The bursting of my heart !" he an-
swered, with an air of frightful calmness.
Gabrielle felt her blood chill: " Yes,'
he pursued, "
my
heart has become too
big for my breast ;-its bursting would re-
lieve me, and I should, of necessity, be
cured; yes, yes," he repeated rapidly to

of his observation; and Gabrielle, with
dismay, perceived that his senses were
relapsing into chaos. At length she
persuaded him to retire to beci, and when
his head was on the pillow, she seated her-
self by his side to watch, determined
that during the night she would not leave
him.
Montmorency soon fell into a disturbed
slumber, which continued for about three
hours ; at the end of that time he started
up, and looked eagerly around ; he beheld
his daughter beside him, and fixing his
eyes upon her, he said,

struck Gabrielle with a mingled sensation
of hope and alarm ; hope, though it im-
plied mischievous ideas on one hand, yet
announced a power of recollection on the
other. She, therefore, without evincing
terror, replied, " your sword, my father,
wherefore do you need it?"
" To relieve my heart," he cried, em-
phatically; "or I shall never be at ease."
Gabrielle shuddered, and arose ; she
bent over him, and laid his head upon her
bosom. " Compose yourself, my beloved
father, she said, in a broken voice, your
heart will yet recover without the aid of
your sword."
Montmorency looked at her, and faintly
shook his head; then, as if in sudden re-

mournful air.--" Gabrielle," he murmured,

could say no more, but his closing eyes
were still turned upon his daughter, with
an expression such as shewed that reason
had returned in his last moments, to
harrow up the fleeting soul, and double
the agony of death. He made a feeble
movement for the hand of Gabrielle, who
now knelt beside him ; with his cold damp
hand he tremblingly raised, and placed it
upon his eyes, from which the sight was
waning fast, as though he would have
said, " Thou shalt close my eyes." Short
and tremulous breathings heaved his breast,
they became fainter and fainter,---irregular,
now for a moment they ceased, -and
now they ceased for ever!
For a few minutes after the last breath
had issued from the lips of Montmorency,

over his eyes, neither spoke nor moved,

at length she ventured softly to remove
her hand; the fixed features struck a
fearful anguish to her soul. She gazed
upon him, and still dreading to admit the
terrible conviction, placed her hand near
his mouth; she felt no breath ;-upon his
heart she felt no movement ;-a piercing
and distracting shriek escaped her lips;
she rushed wildly towards the door, but ere
she could reach it, overpowered with unut-
terable horror, sank insensible on the
floor.

might have been her dreadful fate, admits
not of conjecture, had not the amiable
Madame Bertrand, who had not seen her
the preceding day, deemed it an act of duty
and propriety to visit her as early as pos-
sible

door she entered; but perceiving no one
in the outer room, she advanced to the
interior, where a scene of horror met her
view.
Well aware of the situation of Gabrielle,

by selfish terrors at an hour like this,
she hastened instantly towards her, and
raising her in her arms, placed her as
well as she could by the side of the bed
where the unfortunate Montmorency had
breathed his last. By slow degrees Ga-
brielle recovered, but awakened to life
rather by the severest bodily pangs, than
the efforts of friendship. To what did
she awaken? to recollections that almost
quenched, in a sea of horror, the feeble ray
of returning reason; yet she did not
relapse into insensibility, for increasing
agony kept too dreadfully alive the sense
of feeling. But of herself she thought
not; it was of her father she raved of the
pangs, the pangs of the heart that she had
occasioned him. Madame Bertrand had
covered over the face of Montmorency;
Gabrielle beheld him not, and the idea of
his death appeared like a frightful dream
to her mind. Alarmed for her; fearing

the consequences that might ensue, even
to the risk of her life, should she
remain where she was, and insist on con-
templating the cold body of her father,
the wish of the good Bertrand was to
take advantage of the present distraction
of her mind, to withdraw her from the
chamber of death; in this she succeeded,
partly by intreaty, partly by stratagem;
and having brought her to her own room,
induced her, without much solicitation,
for the wretched girl was incapable of re-
sistance, to repose on the bed. Steady
and courageous she remained beside her,
and ere long, in pain and in sorrow, the
forlorn Cabrielle ushered on the world a
female infant,

and extended to the unconscious infant.
She watched by her with the most unremit-
ing care, and left her only to facilitate the
means of procuring such assistance as her
situation might farther render necessary.
This she did through the means of her
ardent adnirer Buffuet, who, too happy
in an opportunity of obliging her he so
assiduously courted, ransacked the canton
for such things as Madame Bertrand in-
formed him she required, and desired no
other reward than the permission of visit-
ing her sometimes, during her stay at the
cottage of Gabrielle.
The bodily sufferings of the unhappy
Gabrielle being at an end, those of her
mind increased ten-fold; she beheld the
picture of the past as it was, no longer
confused or distorted by transports of
agony, or bewildered by distraction of
idea; all was before her frightfully clear:
G 3

she contemplated it in horror; and weak-
ened nature, incapable of enduring the
renewed torments of reflection, sunk un-
der such accumulated sufferings; and
fever, with raging delirium ensued, threat-
ening to put a speedy period to the life
which still feebly existed.
Five days had now elapsed since the
death of Montmorency, when Madame
Bertrand conceived it proper that his sad
remains should be consigned to their
parent earth. She consulted with Bof-
fuet, without suggesting aught to Ga-
brielle upon so melancholy a subject, and
agreed with him, that his burial shoukl
not be deferred beyond the following day.
From the time of her confinement,
whatever Gabrielle had said of her father
had been but in incoherent ravings; it
seemed, as it were, impossible for her to

dwell on the idea of his being no more,
and retain her reason; upon this subject
never had she for long been rational;
and when the vague harrowing recollection
of his death darted like the lightening's
flash through her chaotic brain, it
became immediately followed by the wildest
effusions of an horror-stricken fancy.

Madame Bertrand imagined that she might
venture for a few minutes to leave her,

adjoining room, respecting some requisite
arrangements; she accordingly closed the
curtains round the bed, and softly stepped
out of the chamber, drawing the door gently
after her. This movement however, slight as

it was, interrupted the light and feverish
sleep of Gabrielle; she started, and open-
ing her eyes, missed from her side her
accustomed friend and guardian; at the
same time she heard whispering, and
some little bustle in the adjoining chamber,
separated from her's only by a thin parti-
tion, in which was, likewise, the door
which Madame Bertrand had purposely
not entirely closed.
She listened eagerly, and heard Madame
Bertrand
say,
in a low voice, accompanied
by a sigla, " Poor Montmorency; alas!
what now must be the fate of the
daughter thou hast left, of her who was
thy pride ?" The heart of the wretched Ga-
brielle beat hard against her breast, her
cheek fluslied with the wildcrimson of agouy,
when she distinguished the voice of Boffuet,
in reply, " Poor Montmorency, say I too;
he disdained us all when he was alive;

but he is now no more, and his pride
must be forgotten." Gabrielle heard no
more; the scene that was passing in the
next room was now fully revealed to her;
nerving horror lent her bodily strength,
she sprang from the bed to the door, and
I ushed into the room, despair and mad-
ness painted in her countenance. Madame
Bertrand, in dismay, turned towards her,
and sought to force her back; while Bof-
fuet, standing before the pale corpse of
Montmorency, endeavoured to hide it
from her view. Gabrielle spoke not, but
she resisted the efforts of Madame Ber.
trand with an immoveable strength. Her
hands were clasped together in agony;
her eyes started from their sockets; and in
defiance of every intreaty or attempt to
restrain her, she made her way towards the
bed, where she stood gazing, with a wild
and steady stare, on the livid features of
her father, majestic even in death,-on

those features which so fully conveyed the
idea, that he never could survive a stain
upon his honor,-on those features which
bespoke a courage and a pride to be con-
quered only by disgrace!
At length, in a low voice, she murmured,
bending over his body" Oh! God, is it
even so ?-my fatherwhat a wreck !"
Her hands, before clasped, were now twist-
ed together-her whole frame became
convulsed; yet in the midst of these
dreadful workings of nature; her eyes still
strained upon the harrowing object before
her, as some conscience-stricken wretch
gazes on the goary phantom of his dis-
turbed imagination.A deathy film spread
itself over her sight-surrounding objects

prostrate on the bed upon the unconscious
form that lay stretched before her.-In
that state the terrified Bertrand conveyed
her in her arms to bed, exerting a strength
of which her energetic friendship alone
made her capable.
In a situation so dangerous as that of
Gabrielle, it may readily be conceived there
was every probability that the scene she
had undergone must in its consequences
become fatal to her. Thus however it did
not prove; those only who have survived
the most dreadful sufferings, and overcome
the most imminent dangers, know what
human nature is capable of sustaining ;
certain it was, that though for long even
after the violence of her mental paroxysms
had subsided, and the malady of her body
yeilded to the strength and goodness of
her constitution, her recovery remained
more than doubtful; and when some slight

portion of returning convalescence ena-
bled her to quit, for a few hours in the
day, her bed, her appearance bore every
symptom of alarmning atrophy, threatening
soon to terminate her miserable existence.
Yet still she lived, and time and nature
triumphed over the ills of mortality.
Meantime her infant daughter increased
daily in strength and beauty; the good
Bertrand, almost despairing to preserve
the mother, had attended with indefatigable
and most assiduous care the child. Her
plain and benevolent heart, which knew
only what the best feelings, and what
urisophisticated virtue, without the aid
of philosophical refinement, teaches us to
practise, did not calculate whether by
essaying to rear the infant, and preserve
its life, she did not perhaps commit an
error, by reserving it for incalculable
evils, and unforeseen misfortunes. She

were preserved a life would be saved.-
Upon these genuine and simple suggestions
of nature she acted, and the babe more
than repaid her beneficent care, in the
pleasure it gave her to find it effectual.
Gabrielle, in process of time, became
enabled to quit her bed altogether, next
to inhale the mountain breeze, and next
to enjoy it while taking gentle exercise.
Still however, though now perfectly sane
in mind as well as body, a melancholy
gloom oppressed her. Since the fatal
funeral day of the unfortunate Mont-
morency, she had never been seen to smile;
and the afflicted Bertrand, though willing
to cherish hope, sometimes was compelled
to fear, that this unvarying depression
would end ultimately in confirmed and
moping madness. To avert this dreadful

i
result, she exerted every effort to rouse
and call forth her feelings, " Come my
dear Gabrielle, would she say, look at our
child, speak to it-kiss it-see how it
smiles upon you." But at this the unhappy
Gabrielle would mournfully shake her
head, while she gazed sadly upon its
innocent countenance. At other times,
when she seemed totally absorbed, and
her tender friend feared with increased
anxiety for her intellects, she would
endeavour to affect her even, by presenting
to her mind the most painful images.
My dear friend," then would she
say to her, " why this incessant melan-
choly? consider, that though your father
no longer lives, your sufferings have more
than expiated the uneasiness you may have
given him.--Heaven has accepted the
atonement, and when heaven forgives, it
becomes impious to persevere in a grief

that implies a doubt of, or ingratitude for
its mercy."At these words Gabrielle
would exclaim, " Ah, cruel Bertrand, what
tell you me of heaven's forgivenessdare
you outrage the great God, in supposing
that he could ever forgive such crimes as
mine ? Am I not a wretch ?-have
I not sinned against the purity of
virtue ?-did I not disgrace my honorable
father ?-did I not destroy him by so
doing ?-have I not brought his grey
hairs
in sorrow to the grave ?-did he not fondly
cherish meand I repaid him by breaking
his heart ?-What tell you me then of
heaven's forgiveness ? No, no; horror be
my portion, no grief, no reinorse, can
blot out at the bar of holy heaven guilt
and crimes like mine." In speaking thus
she would burst into a passion of tears,
she would weep long and copiously, and
her mind becoming thus in a degree re-
lieved from the vent given to her feel-

ings, she would for some time afterwards
appear less gloomy and despairing.
One morning that Madame Bertrand
had been out, with the little Agnes, for
so had she named her, she found on her
return, that Gabrielle was not in the room
where they usually sat, and she proceeded
to seek her in her chamber; she was not
there either; and as she was retiring, she
perceived that the door which led into the
chamber that had been her father's, and
which for long had remained unopened,
appeared now not perfectly closed.Some-
what surprised, she approached and gently
pushed it, when by the side of the bed
on which the high sould Montmorency
had breathed his last, she beheld his
daughter kneeling, her face hidden on the
coverlid.-She drew near her ; deeply af-
fected, and slightly touching her shoulder,

she said " Wherefore thus; my dearest
Gabrielle ? suffer me to lead
you
hence."
Gabrielle raised her face from the bed
its expression was neither wild nor despe-
rate, but it was paler then death, and
bedewed with tears.". My dear friend
-my kind Bertrand," she said in a calm
and solemn voice, without rising from
her knees, " this is my birth day; the
revered and lainented being who expired
on this bed, kept this day ever with a
little feast, and with fond rejoicing. He
would with a tearful eye of love gaze upon
me-retrace the days of my childhood,
and bless the Almighty that he possessed

" But dearest Gabrielle," cried Madame
Bertrand, while the tears coursed down
her cheeks," such incessant suffering
will kill you."
" How he suffered who died on that
bed, Bertrand," with affecting solemnity,
answered Gabrielle, pointing to the bed

" Leave me, kind Bertrand, -yet stay;

The weeping Bertrand sought near the
child to its penitent mother, who taking
it in her arms was on the point of kissing
it, but suddenly drawing back, exclaimed
- -" No! I who have killed my father,
deserve not, on such a day, the happiness
of kissing my child :-Leave me, leave
me! dear Bertrand, even the sight of you,

sure greater than I merit.-Oh, God." she
added, " as I gaze on her did my father
gaze on me; what if she should curse me
with ingratitude, as I have cursed hin."
So spoke he unhappy Gabrielle, and hiding
her face on the bed, wept in the eloquence
of silent woe.
Madame Bertrand readily perceived that
to attempt to dissuade her from her present
purpose would be both useless and distress-
ing; she therefore, after silently contem-
plating her for a few moments in tender
compassion, quitted with gentleness the
apartment, respecting even the wild en-
thusiasm of her grief.
Steady to her purpose did Gabrielle
remain, fasting, and solitary in the dying
chamber of her father, fixed on her knees
beside his lonely bed, contemplating, with

deep remorse, her past guilt, and its
terrible consequences; and looking to the
future with nought but saddest anticipation.
- Oft, from extreme debility, and remaining
for long in one painful position, did she
feel on the point of being overcome; but
determined not to relax, she hailid sickness,
pain and uneasiness, as expiations, though
slight, for her offences, and resolved to die
rather than abridge an instant of her pre-
scribed time of penance.
Night drew in, and she became involved
in darkness; fancy presented to her, her
departed father, now as sitting with her
in the days of their peace, his eyes fixed
on his book, or raised only to look fondly
upon her ; now she beheld him walking
in unsuspicious confidence with Angelo;
now plunged in melancholy madness, brood-
ing and suffering from the dreadful effects
: of that confidence ;-now, on the bed

before her, she saw him stretched in sleep,
as he appeared the night previous to his
death ; now, starting and looking wildly
round, death closed these visions of sad
retrospection, and she beheld him a cold
and pallid corpse; it receded from her
view; now his holy phantom hovered be-
fore her, she saw it mount to heaven, and
her strained eyes in fancy followed till it
was lost amid the clouds.
Midnight approached ; she raised her
hancis to the throne of mercy, and said,
" Oh, my God! I ask thee not to pardon
me, till bitter misfortune shall have atoned
my crimes in thy sight, if atoned they
may be; but I implore thee to direct my
future conduct, and to chastise me in any
way that, by obtaining thy pardon, may
permit me, after death, to be reunited to
my
father, and obtain his pardon for my
mortal sins." She then arose from her

knees ; though her feeble frame was sink-
ing to the earth, her heart seemed lighter,
and her mind more calm, for she felt as
though she had performed a sacred and
indispensable duty.
Gabrielle had retraced, brooded, and
wept over the past; but she had likewise
imagined a plan for the future; thus,
though still melancholy, she was less so
than before. Such is the power of moral,
over physical feeling ; when the mind is ill
at ease, bodily health is vain, and sickness
often vanishes when that is rendered tran-
quil. With tottering steps she quitted the
chamber of death, and entered that where
the anxious Bertrand impatiently awaited
her.' This excellent creature, anticipating
the enfeebled state to which so many hours
of exhausting penance must have reduced
the scarce recovered Gabrielle, had prepared

fresh her.
for justly
Gabrielle perceived, on her entrance,
this kind attention ; and though it grieved
her to disappoint her tender friend, still,
faithful to the spirit of her resolution, she
firmly, though with gentleness, refused
the smallest refreshment, determined to
conclude the day as she had commenced
it, in abstinence and in
prayer ;
she argued, that when a pain is succeeded
by a pleasure, the memory of the former
quickly fades from the mind; therefore
is its pressure but half sustained. Madame
Bertrand found herfelf as incapable of op-
posing this determination as the first; her
superior mind fully entered into the sacred
conceptions of the repentant Gabrielle
and reasoning as she did, persuasions would,
she felt, be useless and improper. She
therefore accompanied her to her cham

speedily herself, as had been her custom
since the illness and deranged state of
Gabrielle had rendered necessary the un-
remitting attentions of friendship.

CHAPTER VII.
More than six months had now elapsed
since Gabrielle had given birth to a
daughter; the infant, cherished by the
joint care of a friend and a mother,
was healthful as the breeze of the moun-
tain; by the latter, its opening graces were
often contemplated with a sigh and a
feeling of better anguish; and when Madame
Bertrand would sometimes call her atten-
tion, while gazing herself with enthusias-
tic pleasure on its lovely features, she
could not immediately reply, or give to
her praises the well-deserved meed of
assent.

Meantime she had digested and arranged
plan for her future adoption, which she
waited only a favorable opportunity to de-
clare to her tender friend. One day they
were sitting together at the door of their
cottage; the sun was fast shrouding in
bright western clouds his briginter beams;
the shadows of evening were beginning to
gather on the mighty brows of the moun-
tains, her dark grey mantle blended some
with the horizon, while a shadowy pur-
ple was cast on those below. The tower-
ing head of Mont Blanc, father of moun-
tains, invulnerable to the warm visitations
of the parting beam, though decked in
the glittering beauties it bestowed, rose
like a hoary and majestic chief above them
all, retaining still, in an atmosphere of its
own, a flood of dewy light. Gabrielle
gazed on the triumphant scene, so proudly :

rocks, boasting here and there a vestinent

foamy spray, as it battled along, enveloped it
in a thick smoke; she gazed on the eter-
nally varying scene, but it was familiar to
her eyes, and her thoughts were otherwise
employed; she was meditating how best
she might divulge to Madame Bertrand,
who sat beside her, the plan she had in
view. Praising, as usual, the beauty
of the child she held in her arms, and
receiving from the pensive Gabrielle
no reply, at length she said, hastily,

" I am bestowing my thoughts on
her," replied Gabrielle, seriously.

the child, with admiring fondness.
" Poor infant," said Gabrielle, with
a sigh.
" And why do you pity her?" enquired
Madame Bertrand, somewhat angrily,
and kissing the babe with fervour.
" How can you, my dear friend, de-
mand that question ?" replied Gabrielle,
mournfully ; " is she not a wretched,
friendless babe ? no father, no friend !"-
" No friend ?". interrupted Madame
Bertrand, reproachfully.
" True, true my kind Bertrand

to encounter ; should she be thrown upon
the careless world, no father will step
forth to shield, or to rescue her ;-if the
breath of the defamer should blight her,
no father will revenge the insult; or, if
the seducer should destroy her," she
added, faulteringly, "no father will call
him to account. Her birth will not enti-
tle her to respect or consideration ; to
defend her might be even deemed dis-
grace. Ah! my poor child---would---

" Would what, Gabrielle ?" cried Ma-
dame Bertand, sadly.
"Oh, would she had died !" cried
Gabrielle, bursting into tears.

wisdom of Providence ?"
"No;" answered Gabrielle, "I es-
press but the wish of an apprehensive
mortal, nor do I think, dearest Bertrand,
that it is an impious wish; for is it not
better that this babe should die innocent
and happy, then live to become infamous
or miserable? And how, offspring as she
is of a guilty mother, deprived of a
father's protection, dare I presume to
hope that it may be otherwise? Like a
frail lily on a barren heath, she will be
exposed, defenceless, to every storm ;---
she will fall, and be destroyed! Alas!
what reproaches may I not endure for
ushering her into life? Thus then, my
friend, do I say, better for her to die now,
than be reserved, perhaps, for incalcula-
ble ills.

into the grave, with the dreadful conviction
of having destroyed the two beings dearest
to my heart."
When Gabrielle spoke the dictates of
reason and virtue, her friend always found
it impossible to oppose her, and had too
much of both herself to make the at-
tempt; she therefore remained silent, lis-
tening to what further she was going to
add. Gabrielle, after a few moments, re-
sumed:
" I will seek the Conte D'Albini;-I
will seek the father of my child ; that for-
lorn child calls upon me to do o; obstacles

eyes darting fire, and her cheeks burning

Oh, Gabrielle," exclaimed Madame
Bertrand," what is it you would at-
tempt? assuredly I can participate in
your feelings; I perceive your views, and
I admire the noble spirit which would
excite
you to pursue them, but at the
same time I cannot help perceiving the
insurmountable obstacles which oppose
you. How are you to become a tra-
veller, how are you to encounter dangers
of which you have scarcely an idea,
bred and educated as you have been
in the profoundest solitude, and know-
ing nothing of a world beyond these
mountains?"

brielle; " I was but a child, when, with

information still more; thus, though I
have been, as you say, educated in soli-

conception of the world, which you have
acquired from books, and verbal informa-
tion, will be insufficient to guide you
through it; think, think I intreat you,
more dispassionately, ere you attempt to
act ; here we may live for ever peaceful,
and unmolested."
" No, no," answered Gabrielle, " that

intervene to disturb your system ; say then
no more, my friend, and spare me the
mortification of being compelled to shew

will, Gabrielle ; believe that in me this
child will ever find a mother."

evening should injure her tender charge,
she arose and entered the cottage.
Gabrielle remained, still meditating
on her well-digested plan; and organi-
sing in her mind its minuter parts, fully
appreciating, and, perhaps, rather ex-
ceeding in her ideas, the imminent perils
she would have to encounter, by venturing
into the world a forlorn and defenceless
female. She resolved, therefore, to as-
sume the habit of the opposite sex, and,
as a further precaution against discovery,
to change the delicate hue of her com-
plexion, by the expressed juice of cer-
tain herbs, the properties of which she
well knew. Her cottage, and what little
it contained, she decided to convert into
money, and to divide it equally with
her kind friend, previous to her depar-

ing her to remain no longer in the air,
roused her from her abstraction, and
hastily rising, she joined her in the cot-
tage. The evening was past in detailing
her plan at large to this excellent crea-
ture, and in requesting her assistance,
to which, finding opposition vain, she
yielded melancholy acquiescence. Though
shuddering at the evils to which she
might be exposed, she could not, in her
heart, deny that her plan was carefully
and correctly arranged. It was settled
that Boffuet, the still persevering admi-
rer of Madame Bertrand, should be en-
trusted with her intention ; for his as-
sistance would be necessary, as he would
be the fittest person to dispose of the
cottage, and to purchase a disguise for
Gabrielle.
On the following morning, desirous
to expedite her movements, she pressed

Madame Bertrand to apply at once to
Boftuet; to this, though with tearful
reluctance, her friend agreed; and Bof-
fuet, as usual, proud and solicitous to
oblige his mistress, undertook, with the
greatest alacrity, all that was required
of him. So strenuously did he exert
himself, that in a few days every thing
was in readiness for the departure of
Gabrielle, who found herself, by the
disposal of her cottage and its con-
tents, in possession of a sum far greater
than, with her ignorance of the world,
she could believe requisite for her neces-
sities. According to her original inten-
tention, she divided the
money
into
equal portions, and as she presented one
half to Madame Bertrand, she said,
" Here, my beloved friend, is a sum
which is useless to me; to you, who
have my child under your protection, it

more justly belongs; and will, perhaps,
be more necessary."
Madame Bertrand, indignantly put-
ting back the proffered sum, answered,
with a reproachful look, while a tear
trembled in her mild eye, "I thought,
I hoped, Gabrielle, that you had known
me better."
Boffuet, who was present, observed,
while his eyes fastened on the gold, that
with all due deference to Madame Ber-
trand, he humbly conceived her delicacy
was misplaced, as in case of any acci-
dent arising to Mademoiselle de Mont-
morency, her beautiful little daughter
would not be wholly unprovided for,
Madame Bertrand glanced on Boffuet
with an air of scorn and indignation;
but Gabrielle seeming forcibly struck by

this remark, and almost regretting that
she had disposed of the cottage, which
would have been a certain asylum for
her daughter, hastily answered,
66 How
much truth and reason is there in your
words, my good Boffuet, and how infi-
nitely ought I to thank you for your
seasonable anticipation; here, then," she
added, dividing the half she had reserved
for herself in two portions likewise, "I
add this to my daughter's share, and
since Madame Bertrand refuses it, do
you, my kind Boffuet, take charge of it;
for, in case of need, sure am I that
prove a faithful steward."

Boffuet eagerly longed, yet durst not
stretch forth his hand to take the ten-
dered sum, lest he should displease his
mistress; he therefore only said, " If
Madame Bertrand permit, I think, in-

deed, it is an advisable precaution in
Mademoiselle de Nlontmorency."
Madame Bertrand still remained silent,
but her silence was eloquence itself.
" I have only further to observe," said
Gabrielle, perceiving the delicacy of
her friend, " that if my kind Bertrand
will take the gold, she will set my heart
at rest; but if she refuse, I will throw
it down the first precipice in my way.
This last observation, strengthened by
an idea which at the moment struck
the worthy Bertrand, decided her; for
she mentally resolved, that while she pos-
sessed this sum, her dear Gabrielle could
never want ; stretching forth her reluctant
hand, therefore, she said, emphatically,
" It is enough, give me
the gold,
Gabrielle."

Gabrielle was rejoiced, and the counte-
nance of Boffuet brightened, as his twink- 
ling eyes watched the transfer of the gold,
from one hand to the other.
The following day was now agreed upon
for the departure of Gabrielle; Boffuet
left them, and was to return in the morn-
ing, to accompany Gabrielle a short dis-
tance on her way. This, the last evening
that they were to remain together, was
passed in tears by Madame Bertrand, and
by Gabrielle alternately in deep thought
and in administering consolation to her
friend. Their melancholy supper passed
untouched, each tenderly pressing the
other to eat, yet finding it impossible to
practise what they urged.
At length, before retiring for the night,
Gabrielle taking from her bosom the me-
dallion which had been given her by

ment upon his youthful portrait, hastily
closed it, and passed the chain by which
it was suspended around the neck of her
sleeping infant : " This, my child," she
cried, " belongs rather to thee then me,

that such possibility could ever exist; but
I love the child of Angelo, as I loved him-

turning to Madame Bertrand, "be it, I most
earnestly implore, your care to preserve to
my child this only gift, this only memorial
that I have to bestow on her from a father.

expression of his countenance as he viewed

she only added, " From the eyes of all
that you may even think well offor if I
should die before the accomplishment of
my purpose, and this child be hereafter
cast upon the world, it might-it might be
a means of conducting her, or reveal-
ing her to a father !"
" Be assured, I will watch over your
child, and carefully preserve to her this
gift, so justly prized by you from the
united portraits it represents, and from
containing the date of the Conte's birth,
his name, and age, at the period when the
portrait was taken ; particulars which must
ever place its originality and relation to
the family beyond all doubt."

" Therefore is it," answered Gabrielle
anxiously, " that I affix such consequence
to its preservation ; and affixing such cons
sequence, bestow it on my child, rather
than retain it myself. When she is of an
age to understand, should I continue far
away from her, or perhaps no more exist,
for something tells me that these longing
looks with which I now regard her, will
be the last I shall ever bestow on her, oh!

value of this gift, make it an almost
primary object of her consideration, that thus
the impression received in her childhood
may be permanent, actuate her at maturer
age, be daily strengthened by you, and
have all the importance attached to it in her
idea, which will be necessary for its pre-
servation. No more now on this subject,
my dear Bertrand, but let us retire to
rest; for to-morrow I shall rise with the
dawn." Then filling out a glass of wine,

she handed it to her friend, saying,
" Exert, rouse yourself, dear Bertrand,
conquer this excessive grief, let us drink a
glass of wine, and hope that happiness
may yet await us in the happiness of
others.
This very observation of Gabrielle
brought the tears afresh into the eyes of
Madame Bertrand, for did it not evince
how completely she despaired of happiness
herself, by placing her only hope in
viewing that of others ? she forbore, how-
ever, to express the painful ideas she exci-
ted, and said only, while the glass trem-

she could not restrain her tears; yet, anxi-

mind of her friend, she answered, " Ba-

rather that we do not part for long."

endeavouring to collect for our painful

cessary step. Let us then retire at once,

The first streak of dawn beheld Gabrielle
prepared to abandon the once peaceful
asylum of her innocence and youth, and
now, though become the tomb of
her happiness, viewed still with a sensation
of melancholy regret. She was habited in
her male attire, her dark hair fastened
behind in small compass, and her fair com-
plexion changed to a creolian hue with
the juice she had prepared, and of which
she provided herself with a sufficient
quantity. Complete throughout appeared
the transformation, and Madame Bertrand,
as she embraced her, almost started, say-
ing, " So much do you seem changed in
my eyes, that scarcely can I persuade my-
self it is my Gabrielle with whom I am

if by that means your sorrow may be
diminished."
Madame Bertrand shook her head, and
burst into tears; at this moment Boffuet
appeared, and interrupted the melancholy
scene; when Gabrielle, quitting the room,
sought the chamber where Niontmorency
had expired, intent on paying the last sad
duty of a visit to a spot which brought to
her ever mourning mind the icost vivid
and harrowing recollections. Already, as
she entered, a cold chill crept through her
blood ;--o'er the lattice 'the uncropped
vine and honeysuckle twined in unmolested
luxuriance; no one attempted now to
check or to direct their growth ; for it
was not meet, that, when the tenant of
that room was no longer animated, aught
around it should be rendered, as in unholy
mockery, trimly gay; the wild branches
corered the window, and the chastened

light, which gleamed through their inter-
stices, filled the chamber with that sad and
pensive gloom best suited to the sacred
memory of a departed friend. With slow
and reverential step, with inclining figure,
Gabrielle approached the lonely bed ;-she
gazed on it, her eyes filled with tears, and
agonizing retrospections began to crowd
upon her mind. She raised her hands to
heaven, and groaned; plain, in mental
vision, she beheld the martyrd Mont-
morency stretched on the bed before her,
his dying eyes seemed turned upon her. .
" Shade of my father !" she exclaimed,
" I quit your sacred haunts; curse me not
in your wanderings through this deserted
spot,but pity and forgive her, whose
crimes have created the duty which calls
her hence."
She then hurried from the room ; on her
return she beheld Madame Bertrand,

though still wecping, more composed ; she
drew near the bed where reposed her
child, yet calmly slumbering; she knelt
down beside it, and taking one of its little
hands between her's, she imprinted a
gentle kiss
upon
its blooming cheek, and
cried, " Sweet babe-to God I commend
thee; may he look down upon thee, guard
thy innocence, and protect thee from ill ;
may'st thou become happy, virtuous and
honourable; uninjured by the misfortunes,
and unaffected by the errors of thy mo-
ther." Once more she kissed it, and her
big tears settled on the bloomy cheek of
the babe, as the dew of the morning
gems the early and tender rose of spring.
Her emotions became too powerfui ;
she felt, either she must waver in her
resolution, or must instantly fly. Starting
up then suddenly, she exclaimed" Yes
yes, I go my childthy interest calls-
farewell  Bertrand, my friend!" and she

pointed impressively to the child,"

" Yes, yes, rely on me-you may,"
cried the good Bertrand, and sinking on a
chair she burst into tears, as Gabrielle,

from the cottage.

CHAPTER VIII.
The scene is now changed, and passing
over what is not immediately material to
be detailed, we behold Gabrielle de Mont-
morency in Naples, unmolested, and un-
noticed in her male attire; and having no
imbecile fears of her own to contend against,
she had performed her journey without
danger, and with little difficulty. She was
entering on a world, where all was strange
and new to her ; but yet her strong mind
felt no alarm, nor did she suffer herself to
be discouraged; the reflection of her pur-
pose armed her with resolution, and tower-
crested fortitude lent her treble shield.

Determined to dare the worst in the prose-
cution of her duty, undismayed she con-
sidered every
obstacle that might arise, and,
undismayed, planned how to surmount
them.
Angelo had in his letter informed her,
that his stay at Naples would be uncertain.
It was not impossible, therefore, but that
still he might be there. He had named
the place of his residence; at least, the
attempt might be made to gain from
thence some intelligence of him. Gabri-
elle had, under the instructions of her
departed  father, obtained considerable
knowledge in various languages; among
others, the Italian. She did not, there-
fore, find it difficult to make herself un-
derstood, and by dint of enquiry, and the
most patient perseverance, found herself
at length on the spot where he had de-

scribed himself to have taken

abode.
What now were the sensations of Ga-
brielle, as she contemplated the exterior
of an edifice, which contained, perhaps,
the destroyer of her peace and innocence!
but still the being whom her heart, in
despite of herself, most fondly loved.
Trembling, almost overpowered from ex-
cessive agitation, the beating of that way-
ward heart became almost too powerful for
its feeble tenement; she leaned for support
against some palisadoes, near which she
stood, and, for the first time since her
undertaking, her firm soul shrunk at what
she might have to encounter. Almost
in the same instant, however, she became
ashamed of this emotion, higher thoughts
pervaded her mind, and she determined, ere
she left the spot, to be informed whether
or not Angelo still dwelt in the mansion

THE LIBERTINE.
179
before her. It was a late hour of the
evening, lights began to appear in most of
the apartments; and at least she was con-
vinced that it contained some one who
might perhaps, if Angelo were even de-
parted,' give her information respect-
ing him. Now she walked to and fro; and
now paused in eager examination ; prsently
she beheld the door open, and a servant
come forth, who stood beneath the portico.
This was the moment for Gabrielle ; she
hastened towards him, and with as much
indifference as she could assume, enquired
of him if il Conte D'Albini dwelt in that
house.
" He does;" the servant replied, "why
do
you
ask ?"
The heart of Gabrielle beat with redou-
bled violence; but, gathering courage, she

said, " Know you if the Conte wants a
page? if he does, I would willingly
" A page," interrupted the man,
"
how
came that in your head who do you come
from ?"
" I would see your master."
" No doubt you would, but he's not
to be seen," he answered, (with a malici-
ous grin) "no page is wanted here;" and
entering the house the door was shut, with
rude violence, in the face of the disap-
pointed Gabrielle.
Desponding, but not discouraged, she
retraced her melancholy steps to the quar-
ter where she had taken up her residence;
and though mortified for a moment at the
treatment she had experienced from vul-
gar ignorance, she felt
she felt every uneasy

181
sensation more than counterbalanced by
the unhoped for conviction that D'Albini
was still in Naples; the thought of this
was balm for every wound. 56 Ah!" she
mentally cried, " is it then possible,and
shall I again behold that beloved
Heaven" (suddenly interrupting herself,)
" is this the language for a betrayed for-
saken wretch? Oh, let me banish from
my mind ideas so degrading, let me think
of him as the father and protector of his
child, but not as the man who once loved
me, and whom I loved.??
Virtue can slumber, even in the midst
of misfortune, and Gabrielle was still
virtuous, though no longer innocent; she
retired to her melancholy bed, and wearied
by the succession of new objects during
the day, exhausted by fatigue, she soon
sunk into peaceful rest, 'resolving that on
the morrow she would renew her en-

deavors to procure an interview with
D'Albini.
On the following morning, at an early
hour, she bent her eager steps towards his
house; and, now decided that no insolence
should check or intimidate her, she placed
herself beneath the portico, with firm in-
tent to remain there till she could catch a
glimpse of him she sought. A beautiful
English carriage stood at the door, and
from this circumstance Gabrielle hoped
that he would speedily appear. She had
not long occupied her position, ere the
door was hastily opened, and a servant,
whom she perceived was not the same that
she had addressed the preceeding even-
ing, came forth. She was on the point of
speaking to him, when he exclaimed,
" What do you here, boy,---who do you
want?" Gabrielle disdained an answer,
but did not move, when the same man

appearance, and joined his companion.
" Ho, ho," cried he, on perceiving Ga-
brielle,

Cavaliero, after what I said to you last
night? Go, go, get you gone,
for

is coming out."
" I am waiting for him," coolly an-
swered Gabrielle. The men looked at
each other, and he who had first spoken
to her, cried, " Why, stripling
stripling as thou
art, of what service canst thou be?"
and turning to his companion, added,
" He wants to be page to our master, for-
sooth.
" Oh, is it so!" " replied the other,
" Go go, my boy! if you want bread,
you are  light and supple, enlist with the
Lazaroni, you would soon out do the best
of them, I'd warrant you." This observa-

tion was seconded by a loud laugh from
the first man, when, at this very moment,
the voice of Angelo was heard, and the
mirth of his menials gave way to the most
obsequious appearance of respect.
Gabrielle heard too that well-known
voice, and her heart died within her;-
in a few moments he was before her ;-she
dared not lift her eyes, but she felt that his
were fixed upon her, and she was ready
to sink into the earth. In truth, Angelo
was regarding her with attention, and
turning to his servants, he enquired if
they knew aught of the youth, or what
he desired; at this question they looked
confusedly at one another, uncertain what
to reply; when Gabrielle, gathering cou-

tunate orphan, I have no friend, - nor

the request too bold, humbly I would
entreat, that you should take me into your
service."
If I were not in want of a page,"
returned Angelo, with one of those soft
smiles that Gabrielle well remembered,
so interesting a youth as you appear
must ever be an acquisition."
" Do you consent then, my Lord, do
you grant my wish ?" cried Gabrielle,
with undisguised joy.
" I do, most readily;" replied Angelo,

service without other recommenda-
tion than your countenance and appear-
ance. And nothing, surely, could be
more calculated to interest than the coun-
tenance and appearance of Gabrielle ; her
attire, though simple, and that of a page,

dyked with black; and a large Spanish

face, rather added to, than detracted from
its beautiful expression.

" I am going," continued Angelo,
the Corso; enter the house, and on my
return we will have some further conver-
sation." Then seating himself in the car-
riage, he gracefully, with a smile, waved
his hand to the agitated Gabrielle, who,
gazing after him while he remained in
sight, with eyes that in another garb
would have betrayed her, slowly, as he
disappeared, entered the house.
Behold her now in the habitation of her
lover, near his person, and empowered to
watch his every action ; this point gained,
she had leisure to re-consider, or improve
her plans, and decided that she would not

discover herself to him, now that she
possessed the means of doing so when she
chose, till time had developed to her his
present pursuits, and how far, if possible,
his sentiments had changed towards her-
self.
In the capacity of a page, she was
alnost a constant attendant
upon
his
person;
this circumstance of itself produced fre-
quent conversation between them, but,
independently of that, there seemed to
Angelo so interesting and peculiar a charm
in the manners and deportment of the
young Eugene, (for so Gabrielle had
designated herself) that often he unneces-
sarily summoned him into his presence,
and contrived pretexts for detaining hiin,
in order to indulge, without committing
his dignity, in the pleasure he' took in his
society. In the reply that Gabrielle had
made to his enquries, respecting her his-

tory, she had added little of embellish-
ment; she had represented herself as an
orphan, and most truly she was such;
that she was of French extraction, and
having been fondly educated and che-
rished by a tender father, her only sur-
viving parent, was, on his death, which had
recently occurred, thrown without sup-
port upon the world ; that unwilling to
struggle for bread in her native country,
France, it had been more consonant to her
feelings and inclinations, to seek it in
another land; for this purpose she had
travelled into Italy, and, fortunately, as she
would observe, with an animated look
which powerfully affected Angelo, she had
obtained her object far sooner than she
could have presumed to hope. But though
Angelo had heard all this often and often,
he was still unsatisfied, and could not
reconcile to himself, that a youth of
such extraordinary mind, seeming so supe-

189
rior to present circumstances, should have
nothing more peculiar attached to his his-
tory. Sometimes he would make him
repeat his little narative, to discover if pos-
sible some variation; but no, Gabrielle,
ever on her guard, related still the same,
and with a look of interest Angelo would
occassionally suggest his doubts, and seem to
solicit further confidence. Eugene, however,
as we must call Gabrielle, would then
only bow, and reply, with an air of in-
difference, that such was his history.
But a short time elapsed, and the sup-
posed page became so endeared to his
master, that he could no longer suffer him
to associate at any period with his other
dependants, which painful degradation the
mortified, yet determined Gabrielle, had
been sometimes obliged to submit to, and
had endured with that-forbearing patience
that ever attends the consciousness of an

exalted motive. Now, however, this tem-
porary humiliation was at an end; she was
more properly the companion than servant
of Angelo, and was seldom from his pre-
When he rose she attended his
breakfast table, and partook with him the
morning's repast; the hours of noon she
whiled away, by reading to him the newest
productions of the day, or often, sighing
with the tender Tasso, or lovelorn Pe-
trarch, or smiling with the romantic Ariosto.
Sometimes the philosophical works of her
countryman, Voltaire, engaged her, or
history, or metaphysics, and sometimes
even the best English authors; each had
its turn, and at these periods the surprise
and admiration of Angelo would increase.
" Your father must have given you, in-
deed, a superior education," would he
involuntarily exclaim, fixing his eyes upon
her.

" He did his utmost," Gabrielle would
answer, with a sigh, and without raising
her eyes from the book she might be
reading.
Angelo usually dined abroad, or other-
wise had large companies at his house ;
yet even then he felt uneasy, dissatisfied
and anxious to escape again to his youth-
ful companion, in whose society he felt
almost exclusively happy, and who, distant
from these scenes of revelry, adding in
his solitary chamber to the treasures of
his well-stored mind, he fancied superior
to all present. To excuse his frequent un-
looked for appearance, and to prevent
Eugene from surmising the true reason of
his visits, he would say that he felt not well,
that conversation was fatiguing to him, or
that he had drank too much wine, and had es-
caped to avoid drinking more ; then, in his
presence, enjoying his society, the lassitudeor
melancholy of Angelo would speedily vanish,

and books, music, or conversation beguile
agreeably the night, till the hour of repose.
Often on his pillow would he enquire of
himself, and endeavour to trace the cause
of the excessive interest he felt for a
comparative stranger, but he could discover
only the absoluteness of the sentiment,
without being able to ascertain its source,
and, half uneasy at the inexplicable feelings
he experienced, he determined to see less
of the youth, and to treat him if possible
with greater coolness. These resolutions
however, vanished always with the night,
and the next day, and the next, found
him still the same, still irresistibly asso-
ciating with the attractive Eugene, and
becoming more and more attached to
him.
Meantime Gabrielle, blessing the Provi-
dence which had thus early conducted her
beneath the roof of him, on whom her

best hopes were fixed, began to experience
melioration of that deep-seated
sorrow which for long had corroded her
heart; yet hoping nought, nor presuming
to expect aught, her thoughts and feelings
were resolutely suppressed, or concentered
to a single point-the future interests of
her child. Her genuine and unsophisti-
cated ideas of duty taught her that to
ensure protection for the unconscious
being she had been the means of ushering
into life, her whole efforts should be di-
rected, and no sacrifices of self be esteeined
too great to achieve an end so momen-
tous, and so simply due to the object for
whom they were made. Such was the
pure morality of a nature uncontaminated
by association with the world, unbiassed
by its contracted estimates of right and
wrong.
In various ways had Angelo evinced ex-
ex-.

traordinary friendship towards Eugene ; it
now remained to demonstrate still higher
his regard for him, by giving him his con-
fidence. On those days when he dined
abroad, it sometimes happened that he
did not return till a late hour of the
night, or towards morning; and some-
times not till the following day. Gabrielle,
who never accompanied him from home,
knew not whither he went at these times ;
but naturally concluded that convivial or
agreeable society occasionally detained him
thus long. It remained, however, for her
to become more accurately informed.
The departed Montmorency had taught
her to play on various instruments, among
others on the lute; with that was she oc-
cupied when, one evening, Angelo en-
tering her apartment, caused her to cease,
and she arose.

Angelo, " why all this ceremony? will you
never forget the idle distinction fortune
has placed between us ?-Come, I have
something to say to you."
" I am attentive," replied Gabrielle,
immediately seating herself.
" Your secrecy, first," cried Angelo,
with a smile, and taking her hand.
On what subject, my Lord," asked
Gabrielle, faintly smiling in return.
" I am going to give you my confidence,
Eugene,"he paused" I have a mis-
tress!"
Gabrielle involuntarily started; the lute
fell from her nerveless hand, and she was
on the point of sinking, when suddenly

" Poor boy!" said Angelo, looking anx-

Sometimes, my Lord; but this is
the severest pang I have had for some time
past," answered Gabrielle, with a quiver-
ing lip" I feel better now." Angelo still
held her hand, and his eyes were rivetted
upon her countenance ; at that moment
how did Gabrielle bless the artificial co-
souring which veiled from his eager glance
the strong and momentary changes of
her natural complexion.
" I am indeed recovered, my Lord," she
said, withdrawing her trembling hand, and

disdain one whom I regard, and thus I
could often enjoy, at the same time, your
society and the society of her I love."
" Her I love!" repeated Gabrielle to her-
self with horror, and a half-stified groan
escaped her.
" Are you ill again, Eugene ?" cried
Angelo, with alarm.
" No-no, my Lord,-a slight oppres-
sion only at my
breast."
" I will not say any more to you, my

Indeed I will not leave you, Eugene,-

brielle, as Angelo, rising, drew near the
door, and gazing after him, a sigh escaped
her; Angelo turned, but perceiving a
faint smile, which with a heavy heart she
had forced upon her features, he concluded

that the sigh was merely accidental, and
waving his hand towards her, left the room.
Now alone, Gabrielle had leisure to pon-
der over the imprudence of which she had
been guilty ; she justly feared another

must inevitably to suspicion, and might
ultimately defeat her every view; she

over her feelings, and never, upon any
occasion, permit them to overcome her.
True, Angelo had imparted to her a most
painful secret ; but even so, was it not
far better that a secret so material for her
to know, should not have been withheld,
she might otherwise have acted errone-
ously, her plan of conduct wholly undi-
rected by the knowledge of important cir-
cumstances; the chief advantage to be ob-
tained under her disguise, was in the dis-

covery of events, in which he could not
thus suppose her interested, and of which
she must otherwise have remained in igno-
rance.
Perhaps the attempt in her own person
to have banished from his breast a later
passion, might have been vain; her claims
might have been slighted, her remonstran-
ces disregarded ; as a youth, however, the
task appeared less difficult; she would see
this favourite, yes, painful as would be the
effort, she would see her; perhaps she might
discover much respecting her ; she might be
unworthy of the love of Angelo; she might
be even infamous; as a female

convic-
tion of this nature must be useless, for
whatever she might reveal, whatever she
might urge upon the subject, would
in all probability be attributed to envy,
jealousy, or disappointed love. As a youth,

thus some steps would be advanced ;
Angelo would be weaned from an improper
attachment, and then would be the favour-

What grief and anguish filled her breast
to discover that he had not only forsaken
and forgotten her, but that her image in
his heart, or rather, as she believed, in his
fancy, had been displaced by another.
She had thought him cruel and insensible,
she now beheld that he was faithless; but
must this deter her from her purpose? no,
his infidelty to her could not exonerate
her from prosecuting, with undiminished
energy, the interests of her child; why, be-

By the mere force of reason and virtuous
principle, Gabrielle became enabled to con-
quer, or at least repress every personal
feeling, sufficiently to hear without appa-
rent emotion the enraptured praises which
Angelo bestowed upon his mistress, and
even frequently to accompany him to her
house. In proportion as his confidence
grew less restrained, he informed Gabrielle,
" that his fair Oriana was a female of birth
and reputation, an orphan, and a native
of Genoa; that her parents had left
considerable property to herself and a
brother, with whom she resided, and that

inclination alone had prompted them
to fix their residence at Naples : con-
sequently," added Angelo, " as the fair
girl has a severe guardian in her brother,
I am under the necessity of timing my
visits, chiefly in his absence, although it
was with him that my acquaintance
first, by accident, commenced, and
through his means that I became intro-
duced to his lovely sister. I own, from
the first moment I beheld her, I felt a
sensation which, however philosophers
may define it, I know was love; I
repeated my visits again and again ;
her brother was frequently absent; at
length I declared to her the passion with
which she had inspired me; she did not
turn from me with disdain, and I became
speedily convinced that I was far from
being indifferent to her. A most tender
intercourse ensued, and the secrecy with
which it was, and is still conducted,

most strictly enforced by' Oriana, who
has informed me, that independently of
her brother's vigilance, he has it in
firm contemplation to unite her to a
friend of his own, for whom, having
been the associate of his youth, he en-
tertains a decided preference, and who
is daily expected from Genoa."
" But why," asked Gabrielle, having
betrayed no symptom of her keen emo-
tions during this recital, " why have
you not proposed to her brother to marry
her yourself, since, as you say, the Signora
is more attached to you than to him
designed for her ?
Angelo burst into a laugh; "My dear
young friend," he cried, " how very
innocent you are; what! marry the kind

suspicious Gabrielle she once was, now
watchful, reserved, and cautious, suffered
nothing to escape her; she availed herself
of the kindness shewn to her by Oriana,
to be frequently at her house when An-
gelo himself was not there; and in so
doing she besides acted consonantly to the
wishes of Angelo, who considered that
while his Eugene was there, he was not
himself entirely separated from his mis-
tress, in as much as one on whom he
could rely was a faithful witness of her
actions and conduct, which, by relating
to him afterwards, considerably diminished
the pains of absence.
From the circumstance of her having
become an admitted and unrestrained
visitor at the house of Oriana, she made
certain observations which convinced her,
that the statement of the fair Genoese to

she represented as her brother, she soon
ascertained to be no other than a favoured
and most imperious lover, who reigned over
her with a sway alnost despotic. This dis-
covery of a Dios: gross imposture, while
it dismayed Gabrielle at the novel view
it presented of humun depravity, yet cer-
tainly are her more pleasure than if she
had disco;ered a proportionable degree of
virtue, for it pointed out the possiLility of
disuniting her with Angelo, by unmask-

him. Yes, Gabrielle almost exulted, and
wi h alarm a ked of her heart, how it could
rejoice a "the turpitude of any human
bcing.

She resolved for the present, however,
to keep her knowledge secret;

the honor and fidelity of a mistress as

that he does not esteen hir, and I may

of what I know but his secret dislike for
having attempted to interrupt him in a pur-

yet preferred to hiin Fiorenza de Vinci,
the man by him supposed her brother,
and whom once she had passionately loved.
Yet, although she still cherished for him
some sentiments of latent regard, she
liked the society of the young Eugene,
and infinitely admired his person ; so far,
therefore, from deeming his frequent visits
intrusive, she always welcomed him with
the most lively pleasure, and gave him to
understand, she was never more happy
than when in his company.
Sometimes
she would say to him, with a smile, " Eu-
gene, how handsome you appear; in spite
of the darkness of your complexion, you
have the softest and most beautiful coun-
tenance I ever beheld. If D'Albini really
loves me," she would add laughing, and
placing her hand upon his arm, " he
should not send to me so charming a youth
as you are."

Gabrielle speedily perceived, by similar
observations and appropriate conduct, that
in her male character the fair Genoese
viewed her with no slight partiality ; but
although she saw, she would not appear to
see it; and yet did not wholly discourage
it, lest she should become obnoxious to
Oriana, and thereby be removed from the
field of action.
Some months passed on thus, and
nothing material occurred; Gabrielle kept
up with her first and only friend, Madame
Bertrand, a regular correspondence; she
informed her of every circumstance that
took place, and confided to her those
anguished feelings that otherwise were
never breathed but to her pillow. She
confided to her her alternate hopes and
fears, but expressed, along with them,
her determination to persevere in the path

she had marked out, uninfluenced by any
selfish consideration of severe trial, or
deep humiliation. " A wretch like me,"
she would add, " no circumstances can
humiliate to a level with the degradation
in which her own guilt has plunged her ;
nor can any sufferings expiate the crime of
which she stands convicted. Oh, spirit
of my murdered father  could'st thou
look down upon me, perhaps thou would'st
be appeased by the unceasing torments I
endure."
From Madame Bertrand she heard, in
return, of the welfare of her child, of its
increasing beauty, and undiminished
health ; and that the persevering Boffuet

suits." " God," she wrote, " is all suffi-
cient; he would look down upon your
innocent child, he would be to it father
and protector, and render of no import the
neglect of its earthly parent." To these
suggestions, Gabrielle constantly opposed
her duty, the sacrifices that it ordained
her to make for the welfare and security
of the being she had brought into life
defenceless and forlorn, and of the
necessity therefore that there existed
of remaining firm, undiscouraged by
the present errors or misconduct of
Angelo.
Still spell-bound in Naples, the care-
less Angelo thought not of taking his
departure; the bewitching Genoese con-
tinued to engage him; nor as yet did his
love or admiration appear to suffer

One morning, having indispensibly
engaged himself for the day with a
party of friends, and deeming it pro-
bable he might not return till the fol-
lowing morning, he bade Eugene visit
his mistress, and present to her, in his
name, a superb bouquet and a basket
of the finest fruit that could be procured;
to inform her of his intended absence,
and to express to her, in the strongest
terms, his unihappiness at being compelled
to remain away from her so long; adding,
that unaccompanied by her, the charms
of convivial society would be lust upon
him. Painful and severe task for the

unhappy Gabrielle, but frequent wounds
of the same description had considera-
bly blunted the keenness of her feelings
on these points, and she consoled her-
self with the reflection that her humilia-
tion was unknown by any but herself.
She obeyed therefore, in silent sorrow,
the injunction of Angelo, to depart the
moment he was gone, and with a heavy
heart bent her steps towards the residence
of her rival, loaded, for her, with the
delicate offering of fond affection, selec-
ted by him who had once loved her
with equal tenderness. Oh, triumph of

heart, self predominates throughout na-

love which gave to Gabrielle the imagi-
ned fortitude of virtue; moving in the
orbit of him she loved, she saw him,
she heard him, and had strengh to per-

be the actuating principle, but thus it
did not operate with Gabrielle; her deli-
cate love received daily and hourly the
bitterest wounds; had love alone insti-
-gated her, it must thus have become
lessened, and her perseverance enfeebled;
it was her love which, so far from
diminishing, increased the virtue of her
conduct, which had she hated, had been
less difficult to preserve; love such as
her's threw perpetual torments in her
way, sufficient to have annihilated the
most patient affection; but she shielded

lutely her own pangs for the sake of
another.
She arrived at the house of Oriana
with her basket, which weighed far
heavier to her than its contents rendered it,
and entered without ceremony the apart-
ment where she usually sat ; it was empty,
and knowing that it communicated with a
little chamber where sometimes Oriana
retired to enjoy the delightful breezes
from the bay. on which it looked, she
was approaching the door to open it, when
voices from within caused her to arrest her
steps. She listened for a moment, and
heard the authoritative voice of Fiorenza
pronounce the name of Angelo ; this was
sufficient for Gabrielle, she thought hera
self fully justified in attending to what
that man could possibly have to obserye
respecting Angelo, and she drew closer to
the door in order to ascertain, when dis-

tinctly she heard him sy, though in an
under voice,
" If such be the case, why
not consent at once? I repeat, the fool
D'Albini must be loved by you, or you
would not hesitate."
" But, dearest Fiorenza," replied Oriana,
in remonstrating voice," listen to reason;
though the fool, as you say, did tell me
that at his death all he possessed should be
mine, and that he had already taken every
necessary legal step to secure to me, as he
expressed himself, all he possessed; still
it may not be exactly so, and he may per-
paps have only prematurely disclosed his
intentions; in such case, we should gain
nothing by hastening his death; but, on
the contrary, lose all by our precipi-
tancy."

intentions ? Did you not progressively
inform me, as he spoke more decisively?
and ultimately, did you not state to me,

you have been instrumental in procuring
me, you have shared," observed. Oriana,
without attending to the latter part of his
speech.
" It is clear to me, you love D'Albini,"

to notice the remark of Oriana, though
secretly commenting on it with the deepest
rage; nay so wandering and fickle are
you, that I do verily believe you would
prefer to me, even the boy Eugene.".
Oriana burst into a loud laugh, exclaim-
ing, " Oh, now indeed, Fiorenza, vou

thought of this before.?"

" I do not love him !" answered the
Genoese.
" Then why hesitate?"
" I dislike the mode,--poison," lower-
her voice, " is not the safest expedient."
Gabrielle scarcely breathed as she lis-
tened to the increasing infamy which the
conversation of these two persons deve-
loped.
Fiorenza answered with mingled con-
tempt and indignation, " You are en-

measures were more deliberately taken."
" But deliberation in the present case
would lose all; Vincenza was a true
Italian, steady, faithful, to be depended
upon ; D'Albini partakes of the hot-headed,
but cold-hearted, fickle and deceitful
Englishman. Come, Oriana," he conti-
nued, stretching forth his hand, with a
haughty air; " be reasonable, and let us
not waste the time in reflecting on each
other ; I love you more than you are loved

Gabrielle started, and almost fell back-
wards; her head grew giddy, and her heart
became sick; scarcely had she strength
to pay the requisite attention to what was
to follow.

said Oriana, slowly, you will be

" Will you administer it yourself?"
The boy, Eugene, will be with us at

to me, and between you and D'Albini;
he, as usual, with his fond foolery will
desire you to change glasses with him,
and Eugene, as he will be situated, must
unconsciously make the transfer ; thus, you
perceive, allowing the utmost latitude to
your fears, neither of us could possibly
become implicated, because I shall appear
to have intended the wine for you; you
will not even present it to D'Albini, con-
sequently suspicion, if any, must fall on
him who will sit between you."

trembling Gabrielle, " it is intended to
make me the murderer of Angelo--of him

" Leave the rest to me; I undertake
every thing ;-if he hath spoken truly, his
possessions must be your's ;if not,
though by his death we gain nothing, it is
the merited consequence of his presump-
tuous falsehood.''
So saying, Fiorenza arose and kissed
the forehead of Oriana, who taking his
hand to detain him, said, "Well, but if it
be finally determined for to-morrow night,
how shall I be informed which of my
glasses to exchange with D'Albini? I
may

which is destruction myself."

occurrence," answered Fiorenza,

therefore take heed, and remember the
fifth,"
" The fifth ?-very well."
" Yes, for the Count's gallantry is never
sufficiently roused to make the tender pro-
posal of exchanging glasses,' till after
several rounds have been drank."
Oriana laughed, and the base Fiorenza
who had been formerly one of the most
desperate Bravoes in all Italy, and conse-
quently could plan and execute the mur-
der of a fellow creature with as much cool-
ness as he would destroy an insect, stalked
deliberately from the room through a door
which opened on a terrace.
On hearing
this, Gabrielle hurried from her situation
to the further end of the apartment, and
seated herself upon an Ottoman near the
window; a large Venetian mirror opposite

reflected to her, her face and figure, and
as she felt the blood curdling round her
heart, which had receded from her cheek,
she had new reason to rejoice in the arti-
ficial veil that overspread it, and suffered
no trace of paleness to be visible.
In the course of a few moments Oriana-
entered the room ; on beholding her she
slightly started, and exclaimed, " Eugene,
have
you
been here long?"
" Not long, Signora."
" How long ?"
A few minutes."

re-assured voice," why did you

conversation, " which il Conte D'Albini

I literally felt myself overpowered!"

added, seating herself beside him, and
putting back the ringlets from his fore-
head.

" But you are going to remain, Eugene;
are you not ?"
"I will rest a little longer, Signora, if
you will permit !"Gabrielle had in effect
proposed to remain for the day; but the
present unreserved deportment of Oriana
staggered her in her intention.
" You are always so reserved, Eugene,
I protest I think
you
hate me."
Gabrielle averted her countenance, on
which a blush almost pierced through the
covering of art.
" Why do you not answer me, Eugene ?"
asked Oriana, taking her hand.
## p. 233 (#241) ############################################
THE LIBERTINE.
233
" What answer can I make to such an
observation, Signora ?" asked Gabrielle
in return.
u Do
you love me then, Eugene? will
you reply to that?"
" As much as I possibly can, Signora ;"
answered Gabrielle, with truth; but little
aware of the effect these words were
calculated to produce on Oriana, she felt
surprise mingled with alarm, when throw-
ing her arms round her neck, she ex-
claimed, " And I love you, Eugene, more
than I can express! I love you better than
D'Albini, better than Fiorenza,---my
brother," she added, with slight embar-
rassment," in short, so much that I
would sacrifice them both for you."
Gabrielle shuddered at such a mixture
of depravity and deception ; but the incon-

stant Oriana did indeed, at this moment,
prefer Eugene to either of her lorers, and
the deception was towards them alone.
" Come, Eugene," she added, fondly,
say something to me; say again that you
love me."
The embarrassment of Gabrielle was
momentarily increasing ; she was at a loss
how to reply, while Oriana, attributing her
confusion to the timidity of youthful inno-
cence, still gazed with tenderness upon
her downcast countenance. Suddenly the
door opened, and Fiorenza entered the
room ; he cast a suspicious look upon his
mistress, and one of scorn on the sup-
posed Eugene, who felt overwhelmed with
horror at being in the presence of so
dark an assassin, and scarcely considered

had occasioned to the unequivocal lan-
guage of Oriana, she arose to depart, when
Oriana, seizing her by the hand, ex-
claimed, " You must not go indeed,
Eugene, you must remain with me to-day,
I know D'Albini wishes that you should."
" Let the youth depart, Signora," cried
the fierce Fiorenza, in a voice that shewed
he would be obeyed, though he spoke
without passion ; " do you not perceive that
he has not an inclination to remain ?"
" Indeed, Signore, it is impossible for
me to remain," said Gabrielle, but I shall
accompany the Conte here to-morrow
night," he added, turning to Oriana.
" You are certain the Conte intends to
honor us with his company to supper
to-morrow night then ?" observed Fiorenza.

Such I know to be his intention,
Signore, and I shall take care to be of
the party."
" I shall be most happy," replied Fio-
renza; " inform him I have been long
anxious to see him, and hope he will not
fail."
" I will, Signore ;-Signora, farewell !"
" You are very unkind to-day, Eugene,"
cried Oriana, reproachfully.
" Fool!" muttered Fiorenza, looking
on her with an eye of jealous rage, as the
object of her regard closed the door.

CHAPTER X.
GABRIELLE returned home in a state of
agitation and alarm; the commixture
of events too, in so short  space of time,
the conversation she had overheard, and
the subsequent conduct of the Genoese,
distracted and confused her to such a
degree, that, for a certain space, she was
unable sufficiently to arrange her ideas to
resolve upon the line most proper to be
pursued. She easily perceived, from the
observations she had heard, how much the
unguarded Angelo had committed himself
with the base Oriana, in having taught
her to anticipate the period of his death
with pleasure and impatience ; from this

too she saw the extent of his infatuation,
since it could lead him thus far. When
one moment, therefore, she resolved to
expose to him the infamous character of
the Genoese, and reveal to him the plot
meditated against him, she discarded that
resolution in the next; first, lest her mere
assertions should not obtain unlimited
credit ; and secondly, from knowing the
warmth and precipitancy of Angelo, lest
he should instantly fly to his mistress, tax
her with what he had heard, and thus
leave himself open to her blandishments, by
which she might convince him that the
whole was an infamous fabrication ; she,
in such result, as the supposed incendiary,
might be driven with rage from the pre-
sence of Angelo, and these machinating
fiends would ultimately achieve their dread-
ful purposes.
At
length, after long consideration,

alternately dwelling upon and rejecting
every idea that presented itself, she deter-
mined on preserving silence towards
Angelo, to guard him from the mischief
intended, and let him form his own opinion
upon what he should observe.
She passed the day in her chamber,
ruminating and reflecting upon the
proce-
dure necessary to be adopted ; night came
on, and found her still there, and when
the hour of repose arrived, she felt an
irresistible desire to remain up, in case
Angelo should arrive, as sometimes he did
at a late hour, that at least she might
have the happiness of ascertaining he was
at present in safety. Accordingly, taking
a volume of Lorenzo de Medici, she
threw herself upon a sopha to be more at
ease, unfastened her hair, and suffering it
to flow loose over her shoulders, began to
enjoy a moment of peace and relaxation

THE LIBERTINE.
from the consuming cares and agitations
of the day; she soon became deeply enga-
ged with the beauties of her author, and
her mind in a degree diverted from the
contemplation of more gloomy images.
A single curtain of silk separated the
chamber of Angelo from the apartment
where she was; several hours elapsed ; she
no longer entertained an idea of his re-
turn, and though she still held the book
in her hand, she fell into a train of mu-
sing that completely abstracted allattention
from external objects. It happened, how-
ever, that Angelo having unexpectedly
been enabled to make his escape, returned
home, and entered, unheard by Gabrielle,
his own apartment, with intent to retire
immediately to bed, little surmising that
his companion still remained from her's.
He placed his lamp at the further end of

his room, when the tender light that shone
through the curtain became visible, and
convinced that his Eugene must be within,
none other being perinitted to sit in the
apartment adjoituing his; being in a sportive
mood, he felt inclined to surprise him,
and extinguishing his lamp, softly ap-
proached the curtain, to steal on him by
degrees, and not to be heard till he was
For a few moments he remained
looking on her in silence, irresistibly attract-
ed by the sensation of mingled surprise
and admiration which he experienced ;
carelessly and unconsciously reclining,
her hair loosely flowing, and shading in
part her pensive countenance, Gabrielle
presented a figure at once beautiful and
interesting
seen.
" How lovely he is ! mentally ejacula-
ted Angelo, as he gazed ;" yet though he
appears lovely, how little do those fine

and tender features secin to assimilate with
that dark complexion ; what delicacy of
shape too !--what elegance !"
As thus he viewed the supposed youth,
again he felt the warmest sensations of
affection for him rising in his bosom.
" No wonder," said he uneasily to him-
self, " he is formed to inspire friendship
and interest in the coldest heart; whoever
sees him must admire ; whoever knows
him must love." He looked no longer
however, but gently drawing aside the
curtain, he advanced into the room, in an
oblique direction, and gliding behind Ga-
brielle, when she did not dream of his
being in the house, he placed his hands
lightly over her eyes, and cried as he glanced
on the book, Always reading amatory
verse, Engene, you are certainly in love."
Gabrielle at first uttered a slight excla-

mation, but at the soft voice of Angelo
her fears vanished, and gently taking his
hands from before her eyes, she involunta-
rily drew them to her lips and kissed them,
utterly unable, from sudden thought of the
danger that threatened him, to restrain this
impulse of the joy she felt at beholding
him in safety.
Angelo was sensibly affected; he gazed
on her with tenderness, and while tears
almost started to his eyes, he said,
he said, " You
are glad to see me, my dearest Eugene-
this is the happiest moment I have had to-
day."
Gabrielle sighed at this observation, but
answered with energy, " I am indeed most
happy to see you, my lord, and I even
thank
you
for
your
remark."
" What a formal speech, my dear Eugene,

how unlike the tender freedom of
your
action; henceforth, I intreat you, call me
no more my lord, call me only Angelo;
for I consider you my friend, and regard
you as my equal."
" Ah ! what happiness would be mine, if
knowing me he spoke thus, thought Ga-
brielle, " but, my lord, she modestly
observed, " it would not be proper for a
poor, unconnected orphan, whom a happy
chance alone introduced beneath your
roof, to forget the distance that exists
between us."
" No more of this language, Eugene, if
you love me--call me Angelo, and forget
the imaginary distinction you speak of-
the distinction of fortune merely, in all
else you are my superior-ah, my dear
young friend," he added with animation,

fortune more nearly resembled mine, and
my mind your's; you have a firm mind,
Eugene, and mine is weak and wandering ;.
you have virtue, and I am full of errors."
" Ah ! heaven bless and aid him," si-
lently ejaculated Gabrielle; " since he
perceives that he has errors, he will conquer
them; his heart is yet uncorrupted, and I
may indulge the fond hope of his refor-
mation."
" But we are growing too serious," cried
Angelo in a gay tone, " tell me Eugene,"
he added sportively, and twining a lock
of her beautiful hair round his finger,
how is it that you have such luxuriant hair?
one might almost imagine you were a
woman ; absolutely, you must consent to
part with it."

For the first moment, Gabrielle remem-
bered the circumstance of her hair being
loose ; in the deepest confusion she twisted
it round her hand, to fasten it up as usual,
and in an unequal voice said, it fell down
by accident, I know not how."
" Well, let it remain so," cried Angelo,
laughing at her confusion, and withdrawing
the hand which confined it, when again it
fell loose; " let it remain so, it looks
picturesque and beautiful;
Eugene, I had almost forgotten-how
fares the charming Oriana ?"
but pray,
A pang of waking misery aroused
Gabrielle from her fond delusions--she
falteringly answered, " the Signora is
well."
" And as gay, and as fascinating as
ever?"

" Quite so."
" Did she not say aught?"
" She expects you will sup with her
and il Signor Fiorenza, to-morrow night."
" Most assuredly I will, and you like-
wise, Eugene; will you not?"
" I would not for worlds be excluded,
my lord; will you permit me to retire ?"
she added rising.
" Certainly," Angelo answered ab-
stractedly, for his mind was now engaged
with a new image, and new ideas; Gabrielle
moved towards the door, and her heart
swelled with grief. " Good night, my lord,"
she said looking back.
M4
## p. 248 (#256) ############################################

" Good night, Eugene," cooly returned
Angelo.
Gabrielle hastened from the room ; she
perceived of whom he was thinking, and
felt for the moment indignant. " But I
would save, him," said she mentally,
"even though he hated me." She retired to
bed, immersed in plans for his safety, and
meditating on him with tender compassion,
while he retired to his, absorded in fond
fancy of another-that other conceiving
his destruction.
So dangerous and untrue are the blan-
dishments of the wanton, and he who
trusts to them hovers ever on the brink
of perdition. On the following evening
the misguided Angelo, accompanied by
Eugene, attended punctually to his appoint-
ment at the house of Oriana. She received
him with the false smiles of a Circe, and

stretching out her hand, that hand which
was intended to present him ere long with
the draught of death, she softly reproved
him for his absence the whole of the pre-
ceding day. Gabrielle shuddered, and
shuddered still more when approaching her
she whispered in her ear, " I am angry
with you Eugene, nor will I be reconciled
till, unaccompanied by your friend, you
come and ask my forgiveness." To this
she added, unperceived, an emphatic pressure
of the hand, and then exclaimed aloud,
" Conte I have been taxing this young
robber with having stolen the finest peach
out of the basket yesterday, to present it
to his own mistress ; I missed it the moment
he was gone."
Angelo laughed ; " Great Heaven, what
a mixture of depravity and deception,"
thought Gabrielle, as with horror she
looked on Oriana, Fiorenza now made

his appearance; he bowed respectfully to
Angelo, and cordially addressed his pre-
tended sister. Gabrielle glanced towards
him, and trembled; such complicated guilt
was new to her, beyond all that ever her
fancy even could have suggested.
With mingled impatience and dread
she anticipated the hour of supper, while
almost continually her anxious eyes re-
verted from Angelo to his treacherous
hosts, marking their every movement; for
scarcely could she be persuaded that for
the present moment he was safe. Sup-
per was at length announced; Gabrielle
involuntarily started, and a cold chill crept
through her blood; she followed, however,
with seeming composure to the supper
room, and observed, that Fiorenza, seat-
ing himself opposite to Oriana and his
unsuspecting guest, took good care to
leave the seat between them yacant,

waving his hand to Eugene, as intimating
that he resigned it to him. Gabrielle took
the seat, and the supper commenced.
Fiorenza introduced brisk conversation ;
Oriana joined, and they endeavoured, as
much as possible, to amuse Angelo, and
engage his attention. Mean time the vigi-
Jant
eyes
of Gabrielle watched with dread-
ful solicitude each successive glass of wine.
Four rounds had now been drank,--the
supper concluded, --- fresh glasses were
brought, with comfits and fruits, and the
servants all retired.
Now came the fearful fifth round; An-
gelo was engaged in conversation with the
treacherous Genoese, and Gabrielle
ap-
peared listening to them, as particularly
intent upon the subject which occupied
them, though she did not fail to observe
every movement of Fiorenza and re-

marked that after placing his hand for a
moment in his bosom he glided it under
the table, where he suffered it to remain.
Now his dark eyes glanced scowlingly
round, no one seemed looking towards
him-he drew his hand froin underneath
the table, and taking up the bottle, held
it with three fingers only against the
palm of his hand, while as he poured the
wineinto the glass, dexterously from between
his fore finger and thumb, he suffered a sub-
tle and almost impalpable powder to fall
gradually, and mingle with the wine, with
which it thus seemed to incorporate.
Gabrielle experienced a pang of horror ;
had she been ignorant of the plot, so
artful had been the management of the
villain Fiorenza, that not the most suspi-
cious observation could have imagined
aught; 'the other glasses he filled without
moving the position of his hand, and

pishing that containing the poison towards
Oriana, he said, with a terrific smile, and
slightly inclining his head,"
Come,
Oriana, since the Conte will not, your
brother will pledge you."
No, no," cried Angelo, leave your
sister to me, Signor," and lifting his glass
lightly to his lips, he handed it to his mis-
tress, while fondly he looked in her coun-
tenance, and said, My glass for your's,
fair Oriana."
The fair Oriana, with a bewitching
smile, held out her glass to exchange with
Angelo, when," Stop!" exclaimed Ga-
brielle," my Lord; a slight ceremony must
first be performed, which alone can render
the exchange of value to you.".
" What is that, Eugene ?" cried An-
gelo, laughing; while rage, forced into

a smile, appeared on the dark visage of
Fiorenza.
" These glasses, my Lord," pursued
Gabrielle, " have been all brought since
supper,the rosy lips of the Signora have
not yet pressed her's, if therefore you
would
exchange with her, she must first touch it
with that lovely mouth, to add honey to
the wine, and to render it a valuable
exchange for you."
Bravo! my dear Eugene, you know the
laws of love and gallantry, I perceive ;-
fair Oriana, we must be taught by this
youth ; deign then to taste your wine, that
my unworthy lips may press the spot where
your's have touched.
At this unexpected turn, great was the
consternation of the Genoese; she looked
towards Fiorenza, with eyes that said,

C6 Deliver me from this terrible embarrass-
ment." Dark red murder glowed on the
bronzed cheek of Fiorenza! detected
crime sat on his gloomy brow, his lips
quivered with bitter rage, hate, and fierce
disappointment; but he gave no vent to
the tumultuous feelings of his breast.
" Why this timidity, Oriana ?" he cried,
with the look and smile of a deceiving
Demon," you may oblige the Conte,
surely; touch the glass with your lips."
By the emphasis he laid on the word
touch, and by the glance of his eye,
Oriana understood that he wished her in
effect to put the glass to her lips, without
drinking any of the wine; but she was too
dreadfully alarmed for herself to make
this attempt, even though the keen
glance of Eugene might not have dis-

covered the feint; she therefore still hesi-
tated, when Gabrielle exclaimed :
" Aye, ind ed, Signora, why this timi-
dity ?-one should think you were afraid
of being poisoned!" At the same time
taking the glass from her hand, without
Oriana's daring to resist, she held it
- up towards the light, and pursued, " I do
not so much wonder, indeed, Signora, at
your hesitation,--this wine does not in
truth appear most invitingly clear."
At this moment the animated looks, and
gestures of Fiorenza compelling Oriana
into immediate compliance with what they
urged, she exclaimed, with a laugh,
" How absurd you are to night, Eugene ;
I'll not remain near you any longer ;" and
affecting to rise with heedless haste,
she struck, as if by accident, the raised
arm of Gabrielle with her shoulder, when

257
the glass falling out of her hand, immedi-
ately broke, and the fatal draught intended
for Angelo, flowed harmless upon the
table.
Angelo had remained silent during this
scene; there was something in it which he
did not like, yet he knew not what to
think; the words and manner of Gabrielle
excited in his mind a vague suspicion
that some mischief had been intended,
yet scarcely could he reconcile this idea
with reason; for so little inclined was he
to think amiss of any human being, that
he could not conceive a motive sufficiently
black to induce the wish in any one to
deprive him of life.
As the glass fell, his eyes were attracted
to the table, it was strewed with its frag-
ments, upon some of which appeared
a roughness, while in the bottom of
## p. 258 (#266) ############################################
258

the glass, that remained almost entire, a
dusky sediment was clearly discernible.
Angelo took it in his hand, looked at it
with a suspicious eye, yet did not speak,
for he could not endure to believe that the
whole might not be accidental, or that the
tender mistress, who valued him sufficiently
to sacrifice to him her honor, and en-
danger her reputation, could in any point
of view be so false, or so inconsistent, as to
desire his destruction.
The idea was not more abhorrent than
it appeared heterogeneous to him, and
therefore he would not allow himself to
express a doubt, well knowing that if he
did, he could never see her more.
Oriana, somewhat recovered, now that
she had conquered the terror of being
compelled to touch the poison, took up
with seeining indifference one of the

259
fragments of glass, and looking slightly
over it, handed it to the enraged and de-
feated Fiorenza, exclaiming with an air of
innocence, " See brother, this glass does
look strangely, and observe," raising his
glass to the light, your wine appears
turbid as mind did ; does it not Eugene?
let us not have any more from this bottle,
there is some fault in it."
Gabrielle made no other reply to her
observation, that by an expressive look,
which Fiorenza observing, vowed in the
deepest recesses of his guilty heart, that
he would take vengeance on the audacious
stripling. Oriana summoning an attendant,
ordered more wine and different glasses,
then filling some for herself, and some for
Angelo, she carelessly observed, " this
wine appears excellent; come, my lord, I
will with pleasure pledge you in this," so
saying, she tasted the wine, and with a

seducing smile presented her glass to
Angelo, that part towards him which her
lips had touched.
Though Angelo was far from being per-
fectly at ease, he could not resist the
tender blandishment of his mistress ; he
took the wine from her hand, and as he
did so, said, fixing his eyes upon her coun-
tenance, which bore the air of the most
perfect innocence, " Oriana-I drink to
you in all sincerity.
" Conte D'Albini !" exclaimed the wily
Fiorenza, starting up and placing his hand
in his bosom, from which the hilt of his
stilletto became visible, " you lay strange
emphases on your wordswhy that mean-
ing in your looks ? if you suspect there
is more than mere accident in what has
occurred, speak openly your doubts, and

I will at once satisfy you
of
my
honor,
as you must me for your suspicions."
" I have not said any thing, Signor
Fiorenza, to render this conduct necessary
on your part," observed Angelo,"
your
warmth indeed appears totally uncalled
for."
66
From the fierce looks of Fiorenza,
panting to give some vent to his dreadful
rage, Gabrielle entertained a fear, that
foiled in his first aim, he now desired to
provoke Angelo, to resent his words, that
he might have an opportunity, in an un-
guarded moment, of achieving his purpose
by his stilletto. She therefore exclaimed,
"Oh, certainly, Signor Fiorenza you are
too precipitate; il Conte D'Albini never
gives hints, he always expresses what he
thinks. Why not therefore reserve the

vindication of your honour, till he avows
his doubts of it pas
" I perceive, young gentleman," cried
Fiorenza, biting his lips, with a distorted
smile,
you are as prone to teach the
laws of honour, as those of gallantry."
66
" Nonsense !" cried Oriana, and with
that innocent sportiveness she knew so well
how to assume, she added; "
my
brother
was ever passionate and hasty from a youth,
come, sit down good Fiorenza, no one
chuses to quarrel with you."
" What, do you condemn me too,
Oriana ?" cried he, permitting his stern
features to relax; and taking his hand
from his bosom, he presented it to An-
gelo, saying, " Excuse me Conte if I have
been intemperate, but when an Italian
conceives a friendship, he cannot brook

THE LIBERLINE.
263
the idea that trifles or accidental circum-
stances should cause it to be suspected."
Angelo, impressed for the moment by
his words, took his proffered hand, and
Fiorenza re-seating himself, harmony ap-
peared again to be restored.
Oriana exerted every effort to please
and entertain Angelo, desirous of oblitera-
ting from his mind the awkward accident
that had occurred; in these attempts the
gloomy Fiorenza essayed to join, but their
united endeavours could not prevent him
from now and then reverting to what had
passed, nor could he compel himself to
the usual cheerfulness and gaiety he
evinced, when in the presence of his fair
mistress. He therefore earlier than com-
mon took his departure, and, accompanied
by Eugene, returned home.
## p. 264 (#272) ############################################

THE LIBERTINE.
In
any other place than Italy,  circum-
stance like the one here detailed might
have been sufficient ground for the deep-
est scrutiny of the law, for the disgrace or
punishment of the persons convicted, and
of course for a total and eternal breach
between the party : but in this country
the case is different; such occurrences are
cominon, and a lover even ascertaining the
intent of his mistress to poison him, not
only would not feel himself induced to
break with her, but would even continue
his visits to so dangerous an object.-
Pique, anger, jealousy, will sometimes
excite to this violent degree the resent-
ment of the Italian fair, and if the ven-
turous lover has reason to believe that
either of these momentary sensations is
the actuating impulse of his mistress's
attempt, he can forgive her, and entertain
no fears of future mischief: besides, the
mode of thinking on this point is some-

THE LIBERTINE.
265
what reciprocal ; the lover indeed will not
poison his fair one, if he suspects her
: fidelity, but he takes a shorter method ;
he plunges his stiletto in her breast, and
often gives her no opportunity of vindica-
tion. Thus the country stamps the de-
gree of crime, marks the criterion by which
it is to be estimated, and gives the law to
the opinions of the people. In Sparta, it
was ordained to expose to perish in the
forests, those tender infants who gave
no early indications of strength and beauty,
while in more civilized ages, the practice
became punishable with death.
There was a mixed sensation in the
mind of Angelo, which rendered him
i averse to conversing with Eugene on the
events of the night; he feared, perhaps,
that his unbiassed mind appreciated them
more truly than he would' permit his own
to do; and that he might advance such

observations and opinions, as, from their
justness and propriety, might render it next
to impossible for him to continue his visits
to Oriana. So weak was he, and so ex-
travagantly infatuated with this worthless
woman, who, from her pretended inno-
cence and engaging vivacity, had obtained
such an ascendancy over him, that he
could not endure, upon any terms, the
thought of resigning her society; he en-
deavoured to persuade himself, that nothing
hostile was in reality intended against
him, that all was accidental; yet, when
memory involuntarily recurred to the em-
barrassment manifested by Oriana when
pressed to taste the wine, the pretended
accident of its spilling, in which there ap-
peared so much of artifice, he was stag-
gered. To this, however, he opposed in
his mind the warmth of tenacious honour,
and offended friendship in Fiorenza, who

of evil had been designed against him,
would have acted in a way so widely
different.
Yet spite of his wish to think and be-
lieve the best, such was his opinion of the
depth and penetration of Eugene, that he,
at times, almost felt a conviction there
must be strong meaning in the conduct he
had pursued. At all events he could not
resolve otherwise than to speak of it lightly,
to appear to estimate it as a trifle merely,
and thus treating it, continue without in-
terruption his visits to Oriana, though
keeping continually on his guard, and
narrowly observing her future corduct.
Such, too often, the infatuation of the
Libertine, and such his unworthy folly;
his all of feeling directed towards objects,
base or contemptible, as unwilling as he
is unable to shake off the ignoble train-

mels by which he is enslaved.. Vice has
for him more attractions thn virtue; the
superficial endowments of the body, more
value than those of the mind. Thus the
meretricious fair one, who, by empty frivo-
lity, or unmeaning mirth, can wing his
vapid hours with irrational delight, will
ever be in his eyes a greater object of al-
lurement than the faithful friend, honour-
able wife, or intellectual companion.

She came; she found her hero :--silent she rollid her sad
eyes; she was pale as a watry cloud that rises from the lake
to the beam of the moon. Few were her days on Cona.
Her soul was fixed on Oscar; the son of
Caruth was the youth of her love. She forgot the blood of
her father, and loved the hand that slew him!

CHAPTER XI.
GABRIELLE saw, and lamented, the degra-
dation of Angelo : " Alas," thought she,
" me, who loved him, he voluntarily aban-
doned ;-and her, who would destroy him,
he cannot resign." He still persisted in
visiting Oriana, and since he would so per-
sist, Gabrielle would still accompany him.
Though she disdained the infatuation by
which he was swayed, she determined to be
his guardian angel, and save him from fur-

ther mischief that might be meditating
against him, for the sake of his child,
for his own sake,and for the love she had
once borne him, perhaps bore him still.
How much did she now secretly rejoice,
that she had not, in the first instance, pre-
cipitately divulged to him the discoveries
she had made; the weak Angelo might
liave disregarded, or, entangled as he was,
have discredited her assertions; even if,
for a moment, he had listened, the artifices
of Oriana would have soon driven from his
mind all doubts against herself; and how
did Oriana attain this ascendancy? She
was neither surprisingly beautiful, accom-
plished, nor sensible. The modest Gabrielle,
when, with all the humility of self-appre-
ciation, she compared their respective me-
rits, could not but behold herself the su-
perior, weighed down, and degraded, as she
felt, by guilt and shame.

" He must, then, love Oriana," thought
she, " for her contempt of feeling, prin
ciple, and virtue; he must love her for
that boldness of character which perse-
veres, unshrinkingly, in the path of vice,
and which induces her, as he conceives, to
sacrifice for him all self - estimation and
e respect. If such is the way to the heart of
Angelo, I, alas, shall never regain it; but,
no, no, he cannot be for ever dead to all
that is noble, to the superiority of virtue;
he is only dazzled for a time, by the me-
teor glare of passion.Let me, then, still
watch over him ;-let me save him from
threatening danger, and see if his heart be
inaccessible, even of gratitude."
The defeat of the plot arranged between
Fiorenza and the Genoese, so far from in-
ducing them to resign all thoughts of mis-
chief against Angelo, served only to sharpen
against him the malice and ferocity of the

former. Though, in the first instance,
he had desired his death, only from an
idea of the benefit that would accrue in
consequence to himself, he, now that he
had escaped, thirsted for his blood ; for no
whom his death-dealing eye had
marked, had ever escaped the bravo Fio-

" He shall die a thousand times for
this," he emphatically observed to Oriana ;
and to that unprincipled, and subjugated
woman, he, with bitter invectives, attri-
buted the failure of their attempt. She.

cient virtue, to desire to rebel against the

period, and to lend her every power to the
achievement of his purpose; nay,
strike, if he required it, with her own
hand, the fatal blow.

" No, no, I shall take surer aim than by
the hand of a woman," he scornfully ob-

Oriana began to hate her despotic lover ;
but she feared him likewise; and, though
she would gladly have fled from him, she
well knew he would have trace:1 her, even
into the depths of the earth, if there she
could have hidden, and that life would
have been the forfeit of her bold desertion.
Meantime, her hatred of him, and indif-
ference towards Angelo, increasing daily, left
room in her heart for the indulgence of a
warmer sentiment, or rather sensation,
which she cherished, at once, for its novelty,
and for the pleasure she derived from it ;-
this sensation was love, as far as it might
be thus denominated in her breast, for the
youthful Eugene. She pressed his visits
with an unceasing anxiety, and, for his

for him more attractions than virtue; the
superficial endowments of the body, more
value than those of the mind. Thus the
meretricious fair one, who, by empty frivo-
lity, or unmeaning mirth, can wing his
vapid hours with irrational delight, will
ever be in his eyes a greater object of al-
lurement than the faithful friend, honour-
able wife, or intellectual companion.

hesitated to express to him, in the most
animated terms,
the tenderness with

admiration ;-not even when the absence
of other society rendered reserve unneces-
sary. This change of demeanor was no
secret to Fiorenza; and it only impelled
him to hasten his measures, lest, verging
from coolness to disgust, and from disgust
to hatred of his lovely mistress, he should
ultimately forsake her altogether, and thus
rob hiin of his intended
prey.
In truth, Angelo, however he might
wish it, could not drive from his inind the
remembrance of that eventful night, when
the fair Oriana had appeared to so much
disadvantage; it perpetually recurred to
him, even in moments when he was most
inclined to forget it; and, when she be-
stowed upon him smiles full of innocence
and love, he remembered, with an unplea-
sant feeling, that just so she had smiled
and looked, on that very night. In short,
so frank was the nature of Angelo, that

the least ground for suspicion made him
wretched; he could not endure to harbour
it, yet could not either direst himself of it;
he longed to say to his mistress, " Oriana,
explain to me the scene that passed that
night."
Yet, although dissatisfied, tormented oc-
casionally by doubts or vague suspicion, he
kept his thoughts secret from Eugene, for
he dreaded least his penetration should at
once convince him of their just foundation,
and of his folly in continuing to be de-
ceived.
It happened one morning, that Gabrielle,
having been sent by the restless Angelo
on some frivolous occasion to the house of
his mistress, hearing that Oriana was in
her dressing room, proceeded thither, and,
opening the door somewhat abruptly, found
her in tears, with a countenance of rage ;

notwithstanding which, Fiorenza, seated
beside her, was looking on with mingled
indignation and contempt. - As Eugene
made his appearance, Oriana started, and
retired to a window ; but Fiorenza, rising
without apparent embarrassment, observed
to Eugene, " Eugene, I leave you with my
sister; she has been somewhat refractory to
my will, but perhaps your good sense may
succeed in teaching her, that it is her duty
to obey the will of her brother." As he
uttered these words, Oriana turned round,
and cast a glance on him without speaking;
he preserved his countenance unchanged,
and quitted the room.
No sooner was the door closed, than
Oriana beckoned Eugene towards her, who
immediately approached ;-Oriana laid her
finger on her lip, and motioned that he
should ascertain, by examination, that
Fiorenza was not within hearing. Eugene,

vinced her that no one was nigh, feeling a
degree of impatience to know what she
could have to communicate. Oriana, then
taking his hand, said, " Eugene, to what

you
conceive the basest of all wretches,
the bravo Fiorenza,--yes Eugene, you may
look at me with surprise, the bravo Fiorenza,
has desired you to enjoin my acquiescence
in ?"
" I cannot imagine, indeed," replied
Gabrielle.
" Then hear me ;-to the murder of
your dearest friend, the count Angelo
D'Albini."
~ Good Heaven!" exclaimed Gabrielle,
with horror, " what injury has the count
Angelo D'Albini ever comnitted against
Fiorenza de Vinci?"

" He hates him, and that alone would
be sufficient; but there are other causes
which induce him to desire his death;
and-Eugene, dare I trust you?"-
" I think you may," returned Ga-
brielle.
" Well, then," pursued Oriana, drawing
her chair closer to that of Eugene, " Fio-
renza is not my brother, thank heaven!"
This Gabrielle well knew; she affected
no surprise, but, seeming to pay the most
implicit attention, Oriana continued
" He is not my brother ; he calls himself
my lover ; but he is, in reality, the most
despotic of masters ; I tremble in his pre-
sence; he treats ine like an abject slave;

him service, and am too contemptible to do

him ill, he would long since have taken
my life. Fiorenza was formerly a bravo
for hire; he is still a bravo in his heart,
and ever ready to commit, for his own
ends, that which he once executed to
serve the ends of others. In short,

you, for
Gabrielle felt curdling horror creep
through her veins, at the depravity of this
unhappy woman. It was not the murder
then of the innocent Angelo, which appal-
led her; it was the idea only of continuing
for life with a man she now detested, and
who perhaps, had he been as amiable as he
was infamous, her fickle nature would have
wearied of in the same length of time.
For Eugene, whom she now preferred,
she was ready to go any lengths, and here-
after, for another, she would have sacri-
ficed him.
Speak, Eugene," she pursued, pressing
his hand,"

Do you think that, quitting Italy, and flying
to another country, you could be happy
with me?-If Angelo were to dieI should
be richif Fiorenza were no longer liv-
ing, I should be unrestrained ;--I am
indifferent to the first, and the last I
hate."
While Gabrielle felt strong desire to fly
from the presence of such a fiend, she felt,
at the same time, the necessity of curbing
the impulse, and concealing the horror and
disgust with which she was inspired. She
wished to preserve from danger the threat-
ened Angelo; it was requisite, therefore, to
hear all that Oriana had to say; it was ne-
cessary she should propose her plans, and
be wholly unreserved, or a single impatient
exclamation, an unrestrained expression of
disgust or indignation, might defeat, beyond
repair, the great aim she had in view:

temned, to take part with Fiorenza, their
plans would be changed and a dreadful
blow might be struck, when least it was
expected.
When, therefore, she found that the
Genoese remained silent, as if in expecta-
tion of some reply to what she had been
saying, she answered with as much com-
posure as she could assume, " I am grate-
ful, fair Oriana, for the confidence you
have reposed in me, and you could not
possibly have advanced a stronger claim on
my regard, with respect to what
you
have
urged respecting an immediate arrangement
between ourselves; I can only for the pre-
sent observe, I must have time for con-
sideration. The Count D'Albini was the
friend of my unaided youth ; he has heap-
ed benefits upon me, and it would grieve
me that he should die," she added-her
voice involuntarily faltering at the last
word.

Finding herself not absolutely repulsed
by him, for whom she had conceived so
strong a passion, the delighted Oriana
eagerly kissed and pressed his hand to her
lips, when Gabrielle, desirous of modera-
ting the transports of a gratitade so hateful
to her, said, " But, Oriana, you have not
yet been sufficiently explicit; it is intended,
you say, to take the life of the Count; you
have not informed me by what means."
" The means are precisely such as a
bravo would have recourse to; easy from
habit, well tried by experience, the means
are, assassination !" Gabrielle was silent
from dismay, and a dreadful anxiety least
all her ingenuity and courage should be in-
competent to save the unguarded Angelo.
Oriana proceeded.

on to complete the deed: he has promised
them a hundred zechins each, if they do
their business well; for he considers that,
by the death of the Count, he should be
enabled to do that and more; and, if they
fail, provided it be through accident alone,
fifty each. To-morrow night, when the
Count departs hence, they await him, in the
Strado di Toledo; they will distinguish him
by his black cloak, and the white feather
in his hat. Fiorenza will, as usual, ac-
company him part of the way, to obviate
all suspicion of himself; and the word for
the signal of attack will be-Hark!

" Promise me, Oriana," answered Ga-
brielle, with firinness,
that, however you
see me act to - morrow night, you will
not interfere ; and promise to retain secret
from every one what you have iinparted to
me."
"I promise-I swear," cried Oriana, "I will
not even ask your intention, so implicitly
do I rely upon you; but, Eugene, to defend
your own life, if necessary, and for ano-
ther purpose, that I will not now enlarge
upon, accept of this, and place it within
your vest;" so saying, she took from be-
neath a girdle which she wore, a small dag-
ger, the blade of which, concealed within
the handle, might be thrown out at
pleasure, by pressing a small spring, and
presented it to Gabrielle. Gabrielle ac-
cepted the dagger, and said, "
member that you must not interfere, and
for the rest, leave all to me."
" Oriana, re-

" But, Fiorenza !"
" Leave all to me--be only passive."-
It is enough," cried the transported
Oriana, who now rejoiced in the fancied
prospect of the death of the man who, a
short time before, she had passionately
loved. " It is enough ; give me your hand
in token that you will not disappoint my
hopes."
" Here is my hand, Oriana ; I give it you
in token that I will do the best I can."
" You are cold towards me, dear Eu-
gene; but I hope that hereafter it will be
otherwise."
"Oriana, farewell, I must hasten hence."
" Farewell Eugene; fortune favour
yoll ;

Gabrielle bastened home; but when she
arrived Angelo was not there; she did not,
however, regret his absence, for it gave her
time to consider deeply the plan most pru-
dent to be at this crisis adopted. Such
now was her perfect knowledge of the
weakness of Angelo, that she determined
not, even in the present case, to enforce
a belief of the perfidy of his worthless mis-
tress, by any other mode than stubborn
proof; mere assertion, however positive,
she well knew might fail; and she there-
fore decided, that he should find himself
on the very brink of destruction, to carry
conviction to his infatuated mind. Once
already she had preserved his life, and she
flattered herself, by caution, firmness, and
due management, she might render him
again, though in a more imminent predi-
cament, the same service.
She resolved,
however, that first' he should rush even
within the vortex of danger, desperate as
was the expedient; but it was theonly means

effectually to save and detach him from a
dangerous connexion. So reasoned the
firm-minded Gabrielle, and such was the
result of her final decision.
Angelo did not return during the day ;
early in the evening she retired to her
chamber, first leaving on his dressing table
the following lines, closely sealed, and
written in a hand as little resembling that
in which she had once addressed him as
possible.
" Angelo, to-morrow night, at the house
of Oriana, your life will be in danger. I ask
you not to credit what I write, but do not
entirely disregard to visit her according
to your intention, for it is
proper
that
you
should, and I will accompany you. All I
desire of you is, to attend to the following
conduct; the first time that I quit the room,

till my return, the second time; take heed
that
you follow me speedily, and, what-
ever you think, be under no apprehensions
for the result.
" EUGENE."
From the tenor of this note, Gabrielle
icadily conceived that Angelo, after read-
ing it, would seek her in her chamber;
in this she was not mistaken ; finding she
had retired, Angelo, as soon as he returned
home, unable to find pleasure in remaining
up alone, sought his chamber, when the
first thing which fixed his attention was
her note upon his table, which, instantly
opening, he read, and hastening to her
apartment. Eugene," he cried, "I
find you have not retired to rest; but
had it been otherwise I must have disturbed
you; you have written me the strangest
notewhat, I conjure you, is the mean-
ing of these mysterious lines ?"
" Dear Angelo," returned Gabrielle,

could I have undertaken to explain to you,
succinctly, the purport of those lines, I
need not have written them."
" But, Eugene," replied Angelo, " you
evidently know more than you have ex-
pressed; if you have, really, a regard for
my safety, and wish to preserve me, you
cannot, surely, hesitate to inform me more
fully of my danger, in order to convince
me of the absolute necessity of being on
my guard."
" That observation, my Lord, is suffi-
cient to shew me, that by revealing to you
all I know, I should gain nothing; I must,
therefore, persist in adding no more to what
I have already said, entreating you only to
pay attention to that."
" Surely, then, Eugene," answered An-
gelo, hastily, " I am not wholly inexcusa-

ble in attributing your present fearful warn-
ing, to some pious superstition, to the re-
"cent effects of a fantastic dream, or vision-
ary presentiment."
" Be it so, my Lord; deign only to
observe the slight request I have made you,
and your danger will, at all events, I hope,
prove no more than a fearful dream."
When Angelo found that neither ridicule
nor entreaty, could draw from Eugene fur-
ther information, he desisted, with appa-
rent indifference, but in reality with the
most extreme anxiety at heart; for some
foundation, he well knew, must exist in the
rational strong mind of Eugene, beyond
mere idle superstition, for the warning he
had given; and this conviction, added to
the doubts that yet continued to exist in
his breast with respect to Oriana, induced
him to regard, with increasing unacknow-
ledged suspicion, her kindness, and the

consideration she evinced towards him.
He determined, therefore, that he would
neither slight his intimation, nor refuse
to yield implicit attention to the request
he had made in his note; he parted coldly
with him, however, foiled in his object
of provoking an explanation from him,
and retired to bed, with a mind by no
means perfectly at ease. Still he desired,
and hoped, that no confirmation of sus-
picions, detrimental
detrimental to his mistress,
might ensue; for finding in Naples no
other fair than Oriana, who appeared
exclusively attached to him, his vanity,
equally with his regard, and the amuse-
ment with which she filled up many of
his idle hours, made him most anxious to
- preserve her. Such, not unfrequently, are
the only ties which cement dangerous
connections, which yet resist the united
efforts of reason and of virtue, and are

The following evening was an eventful
one for the rash unwary Angelo ; though
his mind, ill at rest, was teeming with sus-
picion, he determined to be faithful to his
engagement with Oriana, because he
would neither have the appearance of
yielding to a mere unsupported assertion,
or of evincing cowardice by remaining
absent; any imputation on his natural
courage he could not have endured; sooner
would he have run the risk of a meditated
attack, and trusted to fortune for victory,
or deliverance. At the appointed hour,
therefore, accompanied by Eugene, with

mony, he had for some time past maintained
a slight reserve, he repaired to the resi-
dence of his mistress. She appeared so
charming, and welcomed them with so
much vivacity, that already Angelo began
to feel his doubts dissipating like fogs
before the sun, and looked towards Eugene
with an eye somewhat expressive of re-
proach, which did not however occasion
the latter to change countenance. Fio-
renza, who was present, received them like-
wise with the utmost cordiality, and a
collation, light and elegant, was prepared
in a chamber, brilliantly illuminated, which
resembled more an earthly palace fitted up
for the reception of a heavenly visitant,
than the baleful den of treachery and
murder ! To the raptured eyes of An-
gelo, Oriana appeared as one of the fabled
Houri, and the bright fantastic
appearance
of the room, in which her figure lightly
moved, reininded him of those brilliant

pictured abodes, where eternal pleasures are
said to await the true followers of Mahomet.
Mean time, while mirth and jollity
prevailed, while the infatuated Angelo
pledged Oriana, in repeated goblets of
juice, that to him seemed nectarean, and
Fiorenza pledged him, thus inducing
him to drink double what either of them
took, Gabrielle rose, and quitted the
room, anxiously noted by Oriana, but
seen almost with indifference by Angelo.
He had not been long gone before Fio-
renza remarked his absence; remarked it
with pleasure, but not with surprise, for
Eugene had been frequently in the habit
of retiring early, leaving Angelo still at the
table. He now considered, with fiend-
like exultation, that, wholly unprotected,
and unaccompanied by any, save himself,
his unconscious guest would be entirely at

defender, he might give him, unsuspected,
a mortal wound, This," thought he,
will be the easiest fool I ever marked for
vengeance."
While thus Fiorenza congratulated him-
self in the undoubted prospect of success,

dity inspired by the greatness of her pur-
pose, hastened to the Stado di Toledo, and

suddenly exclaimed,
" Hark!" Instantly
two fierce and gigantic masks rushed froin
beneath an umbrageous portico, and, with-
out pausing for a moment, seized on the
brave, collected Gabrielle, and pointed
their daggers to her breast.
Stop, Claudio ! stop, Piombino !" she

cried;" I am not he you want, but the
page and confidant of signor Fiorenza,
and bring you, from him, a message. You
perceive, he gave me the word of attack;
a somewhat hazardous mean indeed," she
added laughing, " that I might discover
you at once;--now then listen, for I must
be speedily back.
This cool and firm demeanor had the
desired effect; what Gabrielle advanced of
her being the confidant of Fiorenza, ap-
peared undoubted, from her proving her-
self to be perfectly in the secret of the
assassination, of the signal of attack, and
even acquainted accurately with their
names. Without either speaking a word,
they conducted her rapidly up
the
steps
of
the portico, which appertained to a dila-
pidated house, and, bending close to her
ear, one of them, in whispering voice, de-
manded the message of Fiorenza.

' Fiorenza," she answered in a low voice,
following the lesson given her, "is, as you
may conceive, upon the rack; D'Albini
has not as yet left our house, and, indeed,
it does not appear probable that he is in
haste to depart, for the bewitching Oriana
rivets him too closely for the impatience of
our good Fiorenza. Quitting the room,
therefore, he gave me a look to follow him
quickly, and when I joined him, he said,
" Hasten immediately to our friends, Clau-
dio and Piombino, and tell them from me,
that they must quit (curses on the delay of
the fool D'Albini,) their present con-
cealnent, and lie in ambuscade, on the
opposite side of the street, in some con-
venient spot, which you will mutually
agree on, and describe to me."
" And why--wherefore is this ? cried
they both together.

"Will you not give me time?" answered
Gabrielle, impatiently. "In less than ano-
ther hour," said Fiorenza, " the moon will
be precisely in a situation, obliquely, to illu-
mine the Strado di Toledo ; it will appear
over the tops of the houses opposite; con-
sequently that side of the street, on which .
they now are, will be as light as day, while
the side opposite will be enveloped in
shadow."
" By the mass, and by my faith, a most
excellent suggestion," cried Claudio,
in a low tone.
" Aye, by the holy Saint Severino, a
most necessary precaution," observed Piom-
bino; " in good truth, though fear would
be a bad thing in us, it is good for our
employers, for it sets their brains working
for such means of security as our high
mettle would disdain to think of."

" Come, come, Signors, I am in haste;"
cried Gabrielle; " let us cross, and iden-
tify the spot where you are to lie in wait."
" Well you go on, and we will follow
you separately, with solemn serious pace
as Cavalieros should."
So saying the Bravos separated; Ga-
brielle crossed at once, and awaited them,
and each came up to her from opposite
ends of the street. A convenient spot was
soon found, and determined on.
6 Here
then, you will remain," obseryed Gabrielle;
on this spot, too, Fiorenza and his gay
companion will encounter you much earlier
than on the other side."
" Aye, aye; we shall be here to wel-
come the enamorato, and save him many
useless steps on his way
home."

One word more then," said Gabrielle,
" and I go:" then, lowering her voice,
as our signal has now been used, for
the greater security, Fiorenza would wish
it changed; the word of attack, instead of
* Hark!" to be, " Who calls !" And to
preserve him from even the shadow of sus-
picion, it will be myself who shall give it."
" We'll answer you," cried Claudio,
smothering a laugh.
" Another precaution," said Piombino,
with a sneer, " by our brigh lady! fear
teaches a man wit to save himself, let what
will betide."
Well, well, what matters that to
you?"-observed the more crafty Claudio,
in a significant voice, "it does not teach you
manners I think ;-you are paid to obey
orders, and be silent."
## p. 36 (#318) #############################################

THE LIBERTINE.
Aye, aye, very true indeed," cried
Claudio, with mock solemnity.
" Well, Signors," cried Gabrielle, " all
is now settled; so farewell, and success
attend those who perform their duty." So
saying, she hastily left them, and retraced
her steps, with doubled eagerness.
On entering the house of Oriana, she
repaired immediately to a small anticham-
ber, where visitors usually left their cloaks
and hats, where she knew Angelo's to be,
and where she hoped to find Fiorenza's
likewise. In this room a lamp was generally
kept burning, though sometimes, as no one
ever sat there, it was forgotten ; this night,
however, as she had expected, she found it
lighted, and discovered immediately the
cloak and hat of Angelo, while close by
it laid Fiorenza's; at which trifling circum-
stance she involuntarily shuddered; her

first care on beholding them was to reverse
their situations; she placed the hat and
cloak of Angelo upon the chair which
Fiorenza's had occupied, and, in return,
placed Fiorenza's where Angelo's had been;
this done she extinguished the lamp, and
returned to the supper room.
When Fiorenza again beheld her, he
started; he had supposed that she had re-
turned home, and that he should be safe
from even the shadow of an interruption,
in the prosecution of his dreadful purpose.
Gabrielle perceived his rage and displea-
sure, but, with an undaunted look, seating
herself close beside him, a situation she
never took, she whispered in his ear, " I
have discovered your plot ; quit the room
immediately; I will follow you, and ex-
plain."
What language can convey an idea of

the look of the dark assassin at these words.
His cheek, although bronzed over by the
changeless hue of repeated crimes, and his
ferocious eyes, though veiled in the eun-
ning guise of treachery, sufficiently betray-
ed that he heard what had been addressed
to him; he looked at his unwelcome com-
panion ;-he beheld him with surprise, yet
calm and collected; a movement expressive
of his acquiescence, was sufficient for his
watchful eye:-he rose, and quitting the
toom, Gabrielle followed, but not till she
had caught the eye of Angelo, and an im-
pressive glance had said, "Have a care
that you remain not long behind." His
answering look assured her of his com-
pliance.
Gabrielle found the fierce Fiorenza
impatiently expecting her, without the
door of the supper room; she seized him
by the arm, and leading him towards

the antichamber, said to him in a hurried
voice, " Fiorenza, I have discovered your
plot-ask me not how--for I have no time
to waste in useless explanation.".
Fiorenza interrupted her" I can hear
nothing," proceeded she, hastily, " attend
to me, for the moments are precious. You
think me the friend of il Conte D'Albini;
but believe me, I have no reason to be at:
tached to him. You desire, and have cun-
ningly planned his death, guess whether
I wish to prevent your intention, when I
have not revealed my discovery to himself;
or whether I wish to dissuade you, when I
inform you, that Claudio and Piombino
threaten to betray you,

will

mise them two hundred zechins each, in-
stead of one. They think it hard, that they
should have all the hazard of the work,

running any risk, will be enriched for life."

Fiorenza was again about to speak, but
Gabrielle resumed, " Words are vain,
since you cannot now deprive me of what
I know; hasten at once to Claudio and
Piombino ; the Count is deeply engaged
with Oriana; it may not yet be too late to
bring thein to terms, and to secure their
services for this night. Come, while you
waste time in consideration, you gain
nothing, and run the hazard of being
momentarily betrayed ;-take your cloak
and hat, and let us depart." So saying,
she opened the door of the anti-chamber :
the room was in darkness, and the deep
the crafty Fiorenza, for once bewildered
and confused, mechanically sought for his
hat and cloak in the place where he had
left them; but taking up Angelo's instead,
which Gabrielle assisted him to put on,
he rushed from the house with the fury of
a madnan, and with a speed, up the street,

that the resolution of Gabrielle could have
alone enabled her to keep pace with.
Angelo, deterinined, at all events, and
from curiosity as much as any thing, to
comply with the enforced request of
Eugene, had risen from table, notwith-
standing the fascinations of Oriana, soon
ater his departure. He gained the hall-
door just as it had closed upon him and
Fiorenza, and perceived them walking up
the street with the utmost rapidity. While
they hurried to the Strado di Toledo, not a
word was exchanged on either side ; Fio-
renza secretly determining, that, in case he
discovered the smallest treachery in Eugene,
he would immediately sacrifice him to
his revenge. When Angelo perceived that
Eugene was in company with Fiorenza,
his mind felt a sensation of suspicion, ,
bordering on alarm ; for he could not pos-
sibly conceive a motive for their being

together at this hour in the street, and,
seemingly, with some urgent purpose in
view; he quickened his pace, therefore,
determined to pursue them at a small dis-
tance, without making himself heard.
They now came within a few yards of the
spot, where Claudio and Piombino, un-
known to Fiorenza, were concealed; when
Gabrielle, suddenly halting, said, in a low
voice, "Fiorenza, I think some one bids us
stop."
" Nonsense;" in a gloomy voice, mut-
tered Fiorenza, " they are not on this side;"
and proceeded hastily a few steps. Gabrielle
followed. "I am certain I hear a voice.'
Fiorenza now paused; for the consciousness
of guilt made him fearful.
6 Let us not
appear dismayed," whispered Gabrielle ;
and moving a few paces, she, in a loud
voice, exclaimed, " Who calls?" When in-
stantly the assassins, springing from their

hiding places, with daggers drawn, plunged
them at once into the breast of Fiorenza,
who attired, unknown to himself, in the
cloak and white-pluined hat of Angelo,
which he had described to them, that they
might immediately identify him, rushed
justly, and unexpectedly, upon the fate he
biad destined for another.
Groaning, staggering, and falling to the
ground, he exclaimed, in a dreadful voice,
Oh, hell! I am betrayed. Claudio!
Piombino ! can it be your daggers that I
feel?--your comrade Fiorenza!" Pain pre-
vented him from proceeding. when the
bravos, hearing the well-known voice of
their former comrade, perceived, in an in-
stant, that the pretended Eugene had de-
ceived them, and, wild with rage, turning
short upon him, were on the point of im-
molating him to their terrible vengeance.
At this moment, Angelo, who had paused

THE LIBERTINE.
only when he observed them pause, rushed
swiftly towards them, and drawing his stiletto,
threw himself before his beloved Eugene,
who feebly defended himself in such unequal
combat, with the dagger given him by
Oriana. Nerved with super-human strength
and courage, at perceiving the imminent
danger of the youth he idolized, Angelo
did wonders. One of the ruffians fled, but
the other, making a feint at him, thrust his
stiletto into the side of Eugene, and, ex-
claiming, " Fiorenza, thou art revenged!"
sprang after his companion.
Great now was the horror and dismay
of Angelo ; but his all of care, his agony,
was for Eugene, who, writhing with pain,
and fainting, was near falling to the earth.
Supporting him in his arms, he called
aloud for help, and as his eyes wan-
dered eagerly round in search of assistance,
they, for the first time, dwelt upon the

prostrate Fiorenza, whom he beheld ha-
bited in his hat and cloak. A sudden ray
of light burst upon his mind; "Oh, my
beloved
young friend," he exclaimed, "this
scene of dreadful mystery begins to de-
velope itself to my senses ; but, alas, too
late, since thou art thusfor if thou diest,
I will not survive."
Gabrielle answered not, for she was in-
capable; but the expiring voice of Fio-
renza muttered, in return, "Oh, I have
not long to live; let my soul be breathed
out in curses ! Eternal curses seize that
misleading dastard ; tortures, death, and
perdition, be his portion D'Albini, thou
hast escaped ; but may destruction over-
take thee ;-may thy best hopes be
blighted ;---may despair end thy days in
this world, and may'st thou meet damna-
tion in the next!" Then, heaving a deep
groan, he gnashed his teeth with agony,

-curses:
and exclaimed " Oh! yet a moment, to
gall thee with stinging regret, and bitter-
ness, to turn to laughing contempt thy
past pleasures. Dupe and fool; Oriana,
whom thou thoughtest exclusively thine,
was one of whom many had tasted; and
was mine ere thou knewest her! Ha!
she loved thee so well, in her fair arms she
would have lulled thee to repose with poison !
She is now rejoicing in the hopes of thy death.

"With the last remaining strength of
unyielding villainy, he sought to drag his
anguished body to the feet of Angelo;
the struggle of craving vengeance, and
fierce despair was, for an instant, success-
ful; he grasped his dagger in one hand,
and, with his feeble arm upraised, he
sought to pull him downwards; the effort
to do so was vain; death stiffened his
nerves, his arm fell palsied, the clenched
dagger dropt harmless to the ground, and,

with a shivering groan, he expired. Mean-
time several persons, who had been roused
or attracted by the exclamations of Angelo,
came running to the spot; he briefly ex-
plained to them as much of the affair as was
prudent, and implored their assistance for
Eugene, who, bleeding profusely, and una-
ble to move, was conveyed immediately to
his house, while others, following his di-
rections, bore the body of Fiorenza to his.
Gabrielle being laid upon a bed, a sur-
geon was instantly summoned; who,
although she was insensible, conceiving
it requisite that not a moment should be
lost, prepared to examine the wound. At
this juncture, the cessation of motion, and
the secret operations of nature, caused ani-
mation to return. She opened her eyes,
and perceiving the surgeon near her, on
the point of uncovering her bosom, and
Angelo watching over her, she became im-

mediately sensible of her situation, and of
what had passed ; and, seeing that a dis-
covery of her sex was now inevitable, her
natural inodesty taking the alarm, she,
in a feeble voice, begged to be left, a single
moment, alone with Angelo. The sur-
geon reluctantly complied ; and when every
one had retired, she stretched forth her
hand to that unfaithful lover, who, at this
very moment, when she was nearly expiring
for his sake, was dearer to her heart than
ever, and, in trembling accents, said, " An-
gelo, look at me."
Angelo, bending over her, answered,
" Ah, my beloved Eugene, I behold
you
with anguish."
You behold Gabrielle de Montmo-
rency!" faltered she; " that
" that Gabrielle
whom
you
abandoned to her fate,- whom
you made a mother, and who, for that cause,

deserted her home, to seek you in an un
known land ;who has this night-this
night-risked her life to save your's."
" Oh, God! oh, gracious heaven! what
do I hear !" exelaimed Angelo, overpow-
ered, and casting himself on his knees
beside the bed, " can it be possible, that
I see before me Gabrielle de Montmo-
rency ?"
Cannot you pierce through this thin
disguise, Angelo ?"
Ah, those heavenly features, so long co-
vered by an artificial veil ; that look ! yes,
yes,
I behold thee now, beloved Gabrielle;
Oh wretch ! oh monster, that I am! what
sufferings have I caused thee--never, never,
to be forgiven:" and bursting into a pas-
sion of tears, he covered his face with
his hands. At this moment, the surgeon

return
" Leave the room, then, dear Angelo,"
whispered Gabrielle, "you can
again." Angelo rose, he kissed the hand
of Gabrielle, while his emotion prevented
the power of speech, and hurried from the
chamber. He was no sooner gone, than
the surgeon inspected the wound of the
suffering, but heroic Gabrielle, when, to
his infinite surprise, he, by the delicacy of
her formation, ascertained her to be of a
sex opposite to what she appeared; he ut-
tered no remark, however, for he possessed
just notions of propriety; but his com-
passion was excited--and the respectful gen-
tleness of his demeanour increased. On
examination, it appeared to him, that the
stiletto of the ruffian had simply glanc.d

across the ribs, without having affected, in
the least, the nobler parts. In consequence
of this discovery, he observed, with plea-
sure, (for the unfortunate Gabrielle could
not fail of inspiring with interest all
who beheld her,) that her wound was far
from being dangerous, and that her recovery
would depend chiefly upon herself, in re-
maining tranquil, and not suffering bir
mind to be agitated. This agreeable in-
telligence being communicated to Angele,
he rushed, spite of every prohibition to the
contrary, into her apartment, and eagerly
approaching her bedside, he clasped his
hands, while the tears started afresh from
his eyes, and said, " Dearest Gabrielle, I
do not desire you to speak to me, nay,
I
will not allow you ; suffer me only to watch
over you, and to remain by your bedside till
morning."
The poor heart of Gabrielle fluttered

with delight; but she shook her head,
reluctantly to deny a request so agreeable
to her.
" It is in vain, dear Gabrielle, for I am
resolved, and to induce your immediate
acquiescence, I swear to you, that if you
object to my watching in your chamber,
I will not, nevertheless, retire to repose;
but will remain without your door all night
listening to your breathing."
" I will not oppose your wishes, then."

Say no more ;to be permitted to gaze
on you will now be sufficient." So saying
he half closed her curtains, and seating
himself by the side of the bed, maintained
a profound silence.

had undergone, notwithstanding the pain

she felt,--the present moments were, to
Gabrielle, moments of comparative de-
light;-the man who had brought on her
the inost terrible disasters, who had inade
her a inother, without having made her a
wie;---for whom, too, she had quitted the
once happy solitude of her almost native
mountains;--whom friendless, and unaided,
she had wandered far to seek ; --found
futhless, and unthinking of her;--pas-
sionately attached to a woman, infamous at

appalling obstacles;-to have rescued him
from the worthless wanton that had en-
slaved him; to have saved his threatened

her vile associate,-and, ultimately, as she
fondly presumed to hope, have recalled hiin
to love and duty, securing, thereby, the
protection of a father for her child, -all this

was a matter of the highest exultation to
the grief-worn breast that, for long, had been
insensible of auglit, save the pangs of deep
remorse, corroding cares, and bitter humi-
liation. Fair visions of the future danced
before her eyes in bright array, and she
promised hersell, that the turpitude and in-
grittude of his false inistress being now
mude manifest to the deluded Angelo, he
would for ever banish froin his breast a
libertine passion, and become once more
the being that in the days of her innocence
she had fancied hiin.
Angelo who, in most instances, was the
creature of the moment, warm, susceptible,
and impetuous, vicious, not in principle,
but from want of firmness to be otherwise,
conceived for Gabrielle, (who had now ap-
peared before him in a novel and romantic
point of view, and consequently wore in his
eyes all the charms of a different object,

a passion, if possible, stronger and inore
ardent than the first with which she had
inspired him; his enthusiasm too was
powerfully awakened in the retrospect he
took of her conduct,her unshaken for-
titude, her heroic courage, her perseve-
rance, he, too, the actuating cause of such
conduct, in such a wounan, -for liim called
forth such extraordinary exertion of mind,
such strength of character, such diguity
of soul, his vanity roused, still added to
his enthusiasn, and increased his rege-
nerated passion.
Dethroned from his
mind with contempt and hatred, was its
late insiduous sovereign; he no longer con-
sidered her but as a vain, unattractive, fri-
volous, and abandoned female, too worth-
less to be even a foil for the matchless Ga-
brielle, and alsnost abhorred himself to
have been so long deluded by her. She
now appeared to his fickle and unsteady
mind, all that was most disgusting; above

all, she was no longer new, while the long-
neglected, and almost forgotten Gabrielle,
decked by her sudden re-appearance, and
under such circumstances in all the at-
traction of a most bewitching novelty, as-
sumed in his fancy charms of which he had
never thought her possessed, and which
he would never have discovered, had their
intercourse continued uninterrupted.
Such is the libertine; his vitiated ap-
petite requires continually the poignant
and extraneous inducements of ever-varied
povelty to prolong, or to renew it; his pas-
sion can only be kept alive by artifice,
obstacles, or perpetual interruption. How

soul, where each finds in each all that a

preciated, is omnipotent, requiring neither

never-dying flame.
In process of time, as Gabrielle re-
covered, she appeared before the en-
chanted Angelo, in her fair native form,
From beneath that brown complexion,
which resembled the withering leaves of
the autumn, emerged the pale-tinted
rose, which greets the early spring, and
her forehead disclosed once more the hue
of the delicate lily, which, like herself,
fragile and fair, flourished in the valleys
she had left. Now, without fear that
he would distrust, or disregard her in-
formation, did she reveal to him all she
knew of the infamous Oriana; her base
plots, her dark machinations, her trea-
chery, imposture, and ingratitude; she
explained to him likewise that admi-
rable conduct, which had appeared to
him so mysterious on the eventful night

of the poison, and which had first shaken
liis opinion of his unworthy mistress; and,
lastly, she informed him by wliat stra-
tagems, perseverance, and courage, she
had preserved his life from becoming
the
prey
of her, and her vile co-adjutor.
Angelo listened, and at every word his
heated fancy glowed with increased pas-
sion and admiration, for he now wor-
shiped Gabrielle. Perpetually he inter-
rupted her to throw himself at her feet,
to vow to her an eternal gratitude and
fidelity, and to implore her forgiveness
for the past.
How gratifying, how delightful, was
this exuberant renewal of an unhoped-
for tenderness to the heart of Gabrielle!
But her strict principles and unshaken
duty would not permit, that, with this
alone, she should be satisfied, and, sel-
fishly elate at the returning fondness of

a truant lover, neglect or forget interests
so much higher, so much dearer to her
than her own.. She therefore, though she
heard and felt, nay heard and felt too
deeply, the ardent expressions of Angelo;
she would not permit herself to reply to
them, till first she had proved his feel-
ings, and discovered the degree of
purer affection, which might exist in his
heart for the child, whom, though he had
never beheld, still claimed him by the
sacred title of father.. . Thus, when An-
gelo, one day, with all that animation
which his enthusiastic fancy constantly
lent his language,, was speaking to her,
of his passion, she, having lent for long,
a pleased, but silent ear; suddenly said,
when the wounds of her heart opened
afresh, and put to flight, as unholy,
every thought of bliss, "Angelo, you
do not ask me of
my.
father!". Angelo
paused, and blushed; it was a subject

on which he had not dared to touch,
for he trembled to think of his self-ac-
knowledged baseness, and the injuries
that he had heaped on the head of the
noble Frenchman. It was his misfortune,
not a peculiar one, to feel his errors
without power to withstand them. At
length he faltered, "Dare I, dare I, ask
Gabrielle?"
" He is dead !" with brief solemnity
returned Gabrielle.
" Dead!' cried Angelo; striking his
head, as conscience whispered to his
quick sensibility, that he had had a share
in hastening the calamitous event.
" Dead !" replied Gabrielle, in a voice
still more solemn. "I, Angelo, broke
his heart."
"You-you.!" faltered the conscience-

stricken Angelo ;-"you, his pride and
delight!"
" Once, once," cried Gabrielle, hastily,
and bursting into tears. " Once, oh
Angelo, before I knew you;-but, after-
wards, his disgrace, his curse, and his
destruction !"
Oh, Gabrielle! spare me, for God's
sake!"
" Hear me, Angelo; can your sufferings
in listening to what is past, equal mine who
endured that dreadful past? I broke the
heart of Montmorency; the knowledge of
my situation struck him like a thunderbolt,
and though it proved not instant death, it
for ever palsied his faculties. Oh! Angelo,
it destroyed first the mind, the glorious,
the susceptible mind, of my father, sensitive
and shrinking from the breath even of

dishonor; next the havoc extended to his
body, and laid him low. Oh! that dread-
ful scene!-dare I, can I, ever enjoy peace,
while memory retains its power over my
mind? To be happy, even to know a ces-
sation from misery or remorse, would be
a crime!" Here her strong sensations, her
bitter recollections of the past, of the death-
bed of her beloved father, rushing, by the
power of detail, with renovated anguish
over her mind, incapacitated her from pro-
ceeding; and, in an agony of tears, she fell
back on the sopha; where she sat..
Oh! for the sake of mercy, Gabrielle,"
cried the penetrated Angelo, casting him-
self on his knees before her, " spare us,
spare us both, this dreadful recapitula-
tion."
" No, no, Angelo; what are these pangs
compared with what we ought to endure?

will they recall the murdered Montmorency
from the grave? from that grave into
which we precipitated him?" At this,
Angelo hastily hid his face upon the sopha,
and remained eloquently silent. Painful
conscience had recorded the accusation of
Gabrielle, and the words he would have ut-
tered expired on his lips. Gabrielle beheld
his keen emotion, without attempting to
calm it; in a faint voice at length he said,
while his eyes streamed with tears, and his
hands were clasped together, "Oh, daugh-
ter of Montmorency, what reason have
you not to curse the hour when first those
eyes beheld me! but for me, you had been
ever innocent and happy."
" Andand Montmorency would have
been still living," added Gabrielle, with an-
guish.

misfortunes, which I alone occasioned, was

Oh, Angelo, did you not know the
daughter of Montmorency possessed no
grovelling mind? You abandoned, and
left me to my fate ; you ceased to write;
was it for me, then, to sue for attention to
my miseries even from their author ?---was
it for me to call forth his useless, his in-
sulting commiseration, or hi cold re-

appal me."
The affectingly solemn voice in which the
remorseful Gabrielle had thus appealed to
the feelings of her lover, so awed and pene-
trated him, that he had no power to in-
terrupt her; but now that she paused, 110W
that he dared to look upon her, in griev-

his feet,--now that he dared, not longer
than a moment could he contemplate her;

sentence.

the same touching voice, and bending
over him, "I had the protection of a

me; but I disdained his care, broke from

a scorpion, even to his heart's core. For
the love he bore me, and for the pride he
took in me, I brought down his grey hair:
with sorrow to the grave, ---weighed him
down in anguish, and bitterness of soul!
oh, Angelo, your child is a daughter.
Shield her, then, with watchful care; she
may not prove to you the ingrate and the
wretch which I proved to mine;---but,
if you desert, if you abandon her to the
contamination of the world, to the varied
miseries of life, then will she become, if
possible, more guilty and more unfor-
tunate, though in the eyes of Heaven
more pardonable, than her wretched
mother"
"Oh; I swear-I solemnly swear," cried
Angelo, starting from the ground, and
raising his hands and eyes to heaven, his
soul inspired by the animated colouring

which the high - wrought feelings of
Gabrielle imparted to her language, " I so-

that beloved daughter of whom you speak;
and if ever, becoming a wretch, greater
than I have yet been, I neglect the sacred
vow which I have made, may the hand

my soul quits its carthly tenement, it may
rise to heaven unaccompanied by the crimne

the care and example of such a mother,"
"My example !-oh, Angelo!"
"No more, dearest Gabrielle; you refine
too deeply;" and the impetuous Angelo,
raising her from the ground, and seating
her beside him, proceeded with increased
animation, "Say, where and how is our child
situated ? -Can I not soon behold her ?
" I left her," replied Gabrielle, with a
deep sigh ; " beneath the fostering care of
an excellent and worthy friend, where she
is now safe and happy,

this subject ; at present
I must leave you ;my head burns, and
my ideas are confused ;-I wish to ar-

Angelo durst not offer opposition to the
movements of Gabrelle ;-he faintly ex-
pressed regret, that she would not grant
him a few moments more of her society,
yet suffered her to depart.--Already his
quick susceptibility, and conscience, which
will not be silenced, had whispered to him,

71
why Gabrielle felt not satisfied or happy;
no obstacle existed to his union with her ;
yet in all the exuberance of his fondness
he had not proposed to join his fate indis-
solubly with her's.No; the contaminated
principles, the poison of example, the
freedom of conduct, unrestrained by early
precept, or, strict inculation of the right
and the wrong; the ignoble, and libertine,
delights in which from his youth he had
indulged; the idle sneers, loose jests, and
contemptible ribaldry, against the first
of moral institutions, of his companions in
debauchery,all concurred to inspire the
deluded Angelo, though possessed of mind
and feeling above the herd, with a dread
and abhorrence of marriage, such as scarce
any earthly inducement, at the present
juncture, could have given him the courage
to overcome. Yet, he loved Gabrielle,
loved her to the highest degree of which
his nature was capable; but his love had in

of impetuosity than depth ;--it resembled

Gabrielle, when she retired to her pillow,
too well discovered why she was neither
satisfied nur happy.

she, "and he is justified." And with this

CHAPTER XIII.
The female who has once erred, and who
does not hate the author of her error,
should beware of confiding in her own
strength, or relying on the firmness of re-
pentant virtue ;for her, there is no safety
but in flight; and if she desire to retrieve
her path, she should never behold him who
caused her to wander aside. This, with-
out further comment, may be sufficient to
illustrate, that the protracted residence of
Gabrielle, beneath the roof of her lover,
was attended with those fatal consequences
against which no human foresight or reso-
lution could have shielded her, who lin-

gered in so much danger. Gabrielle knew
not the extent of the hazard she ran, till
that knowledge became useless, and bitter
self-reproach, and horror, roused her from
her delusive security. When the mind is
unwarily led to the commission of deep and
irretrievable error, it seeks, naturally seeks,
to reconcile itself to what is past recall.
Thus was it with the unhappy Gabrielle.
She sought to persuade herself, when the
first sensations of remorseful agony were
somewhat abated, that Angelo was now al-
tered; that, indelibly impressed with the
remembrance of the misfortunes that he
had heaped upon her, he would never more
neglect or forsake her; but, in endeavours
to expiate the past, remain for ever fond,
faithful, and sincere. Yet, still soruething
remained behind which would not bear the
touchstone of argument, or refletion;
why, if such were his feelings towards her,
hesitated he to bind his fate eternally to

hers ? Ah! This was a thought which,
like an intrusive creditor, was hastily dis-
patched with an evasive reply ;-but, inde-
pendently of such refinement of scrutiny,
the conduct of Angelo was such, certainly,
as to allow the indulgence of sanguine
hope.
Time stole on, and two years elapsed
of a re-union that, had Gabrielle possessed
less virtue, or sensibility, might have ren-
dered her for the present happy, and tran-
quil as to the future. Angelo became the
father of a son, and his conduct was
characterised by the best and finest attri-
butes of the husband, and the parent ;
as a husband, he was tender, attentive,
domesticated
a father, fond, to
idolatry, of his child: Gabrielle endea-
voured to banish the terrifying idea, that
her children would live to reproach her
for giving them existence, and to indulge

the flattering hope, that the effects of
her errors would never be extended to
them.
my dear
At the commencement of their re-
union, Angelo had expressed an ardent
wish, to behold his daughter, and in-
treated Gabrielle, that she would propose
to Madame Bertrand, to quit Switzerland
for ever, to bring their daughter with
her, and to reside with them. "But no,"
wrote this excellent friend,"
Gabrielle, I will neither quit our peaceful
retreat myself, which almost induces me
to forget there is such a place beyond, as
the busy world you resitle in; nor, if I
inay be allowed a voice, shall our beloved
child quit it either.Ah, my dear young
friend, be not offended with me, if I would
venture to insinuate, thai, though you
have at present every reason to be satis-
fied with the conduct of D'Albini, and

you, in all but the name, yet that name,
so far from being an inconsiderable idea,
or unnecessary to ensure the happi-
ness of your situation, is the only thing
which could render it either prudent, or
safe, for me to resign your daughter to
you.At this time, she is taught to re-
spect a fond, though absent mother;
her juvenile mind conceives of you
the
highest sentiment of which it is capable;
why then would you desire, unneces-
sarily, to give birth to, and gradually to
impress upon it, different and perplexing
ideas? Trust me, D'Albini has not yet
passed the fiery ordeal,---the season of
folly is not yet at an end. If his re-
formation were perfect and sincere, he
would not hesitate, nay, he would be
anxious, to rivet by those bonds to which
mankind have justly affixed the idea of
virtue and propriety, your present

union, to preclude from himself the
power, or the possibility, of forming
other ties. Till then, or till age shall
have taught him, with a smile of con-
tempt, to look back on the follies of
youth, rely not wholly, nor securely upon
him; nor snatch your child from the
positive safety of her present asylum, to
introduce her, perhaps to misfortune, but
certainly to danger, for which
you
would
suffer unavailing repentance and
re-
morse.
"You have already with you, one child,
my dear Gabrielle; if children are a bond
of union between the sexes, is not one
child sufficient to ensure it?
If it is not,
one is too much; and miserable would
be the fate of more. Thus, then, let me
implore you, forego your wish for the
present. Consent to wait, at least till the
character of D'Albini is more fixed; till

it has stood the test of time, and till
you have better ascertained his prin-
ciples of action; then, if you will insist,
you shall be at liberty to reclaim your
daughter."
This letter produced upon Gabrielle a
most salutary effect; her mind, which pre-
sent peace had rendered hopeful for the
future, was now taught to look within
itself, and admit the painful probability,
that this comparative felicity might not
last for ever ;-the idea made her tremble,
and even over-clouded the peacefulness
of the present; it humbled her mind from
the vain and insecure eminence of san-
guine hope; it prepared her, by anticipation,
tor
any future blow, and taught her, with
rational and pensive eye, to regard and
appreciate passing events.

of future fickleness, or indifference; yet
unalloyed pleasure was not thus conveyed
to her heart, for she could remember, with
pain, that the eyes of a lover are but an.
uncertain index of his soul, `and never
presage the future to her he seems to
love. She did not communicate to him
the too just observations of Madame Ber-
trand, but merely that she desired ear-
nestly to be perunitted to retain, yet a little
longer, the child, that froin infancy she had
nursed and cherished. Angelo formed
no objection to the request of Madame
Bertrand; he possessed one child, and le
possessed its mother, and he could endure
to resign, for a wbile, to a dear and
sincere friend, the one he had never
bcheld.

additional example, to the many he had
already had, of the danger resulting from
an association with those females, whose
depravity forms their only rule of action,
and who never admit, for a "moment, the
influence of feeling, honor, or a shadow
of principle, to regulate their conduct.
Humiliated, foiled, and entirely defeated,
atonce in her views and calculations, the rage
of the abandoned Oriana knew no bounds;
she breathed only death and vengeance;
and her chiefest desire was to inflict the
first with her own hand, upon the sup-
posed Eugene, who, in that character, had
obtained knowledge, so complete, of her
infamy, and used that knowledge only to
circumvent, and render it abortive. No-
thing so much excites the
rage
of an artful
and unprincipled mind, as the idea of having
been deceived, and of having betrayed its
inmost guilty workings. The superiority

of virtue never strikes them in a point of
view so manifest, and so detested, as
when it possesses the resolution and the
power to frustrate their evil machinations.
That virtue should be combined with
policy, and be endowed, at once, with
the energy and ingenuity to confound vice,
and to entangle it in its own snares, seems
to be a sort of supererogation, and a detrac-
tion from its own peculiar prerogative, as if
it were incompatible with virtue to be wise,
and vice alone, from its superior cunning,
should ever triumphantly bear off the
palm. In such case, virtue would be
weaker, and have fewer means of defence
than vice; consequently, it would be the
latter that ever would be lord of the ascen-
dant.

that, with all its stinging and mortifying
concomitants, she had in that experienced
the most aggravating disappointment, be-
came to her matter of most serious mo-
ment, and regret. Fiorenza had been
throughout her meretricious career, when
personal regard for her had ceased to ex-
ist, and assumed, as he pretended, the
more valuable character of a regard for her
interest, as a sort of tutelar dmon, ad-
vising, forwarding, and directing her in
plans, of his own suggestion, to the injury
and destruction of others, for her, or
rather his advantage ;-and Oriana, though
she duped the unwary, was herself the
dupe of superior artifice.--Still his death
left her alone in the world ;:in the prosecu-
tion of her desired revenge, who could have
participated with, or assisted her, like Fio-
renza? But she was sufficiently imbued
with the spirit of her late master, to de-
termine on it, if necessary, singly, and.

unaided, though she should perish in the
attempt.
During the two years which the objects
of her hate and envy had continued to
exist in seeming happy union, beneath her
eyes, her revenge had not slumbered, nor
had her vigilance relaxed; every mean that
the vilest artifice, and the most determined
resolution to insure could suggest, was
instantly had recourse to. Now, calum-
niating anonymous letters accused them
to each other of the blackest crimes and
intentions, and mutual treachery. Now the
allurements of love, in the form of tender
confession from some susceptible Italian fair-
one, appointing an assignation, were held
out to the vanity and warm temperament of
Angelo.--Now, similar arts were practised
against the unshaken constancy and firm
principles of Gabrielle ;--and now, in de-
spair at the failure of every attempt,

various pretexts of urgent occasion were
contrived to delude each, separately, from
home, at various hours of the night, for
the basest purpose of destruction-secret
assassination !
Hitherto, however, every machination
had proved abortive, either from exciting
suspicion, or from being detected in
time. These two persons, at this junc-
ture so dear to each other, had neither
inclination nor leisure to punish a feeble,
though malicious enemy. Suspicion of
aught that appeared equivocal, had now
become so habitual to them, that, added
to their perfect knowledge of the infa-
mous Oriana, they considered themselves as
sufficiently protected from her power to
injure them, and from the possibility of
being betrayed by her into a situation of
danger.

hours among
It was with the utmost difficulty, indeed,
that Angelo could ever be induced from
the long untasted charms of domestic
comfort, but at the earnest solicitations of
Gabrielle, who, with her usual fine sense,
could endure that he should sometimes be
amused, even out of her society; he was
occasionally prevailed on to pass a few
friends of his own rank of
life, rendered agreeable to him by simi-
larity of disposition and long association.
One night that he was returning home late
from a select party of male companions,
with whom he had dined, and in convivial
converse, heightened by the juice of the
grape, in social gaiety passed the evening,
he imagined he heard, at a short distance
from him, female plaints.
Ever: alive to the impulse of humanity,
he stopped immediately, and listened ; a
young mournful voice continued to bewail,

and he soon ascertained that the object
could not be far off. Instantly conceiving
it possible there might be some cause of
grief which he could remedy, and dis-
tressed at hearing the accents of sorrow
from a tender female, in the streets at this
unseasonable hour, he hastened onwards,
and soon discovered her who had attracted
his attention, seated beneath a portico,
leaning on the cold step, and weeping
bitterly: he advanced towards her, and
remarking that she was extremely young,
his compassion encreased, while in a sooth-
ing voice he enquired the cause of her dis-
tress.
" Alas, Eccellentissimo Signore, she re-
plied, timidly raising her eyes, and instantly
again looking down, "neither you nor
any one can assist me, for my misfortune
is beyond the reach of aid."

" But what misfortune," asked Angelo,
can occasion a young and innocent girl,
as you appear, to be unprotected in the
streets at this hour of the night ?"
Oh, do not ask me, Eccellentissimo
Signore-do not ask me, for it reminds me
of every thing."
" Reininds you of what?" enquired
Angelo.
" I cannot, no, I cannot bear, Signore,"
cried the young girl, suddenly,
suddenly, " that

" Till-till-"she answered, burst-

marry Castro Nardi, the old fisherman;
lie has asked me of my father, only to beat
and misuse me; to make me carry his
fish to market, and half kill me with blows
and hard treatment, as he did his first
wife; and he is so old and so ugly, Signore,
my heart rises against him. No, no, I will
never return home, never, sooner than
inarry Castro Nardi."
This artless narrative sensibly affected
Angelo, though, at the same time, he could
not avoid smiling at its simplicity; he
persuaded the young girl, however, to

ing on the consequences that might ensue.

his intention of marrying her to the hated
Castro Nardi.
" Will you, indeed, Signore?" cried
she, hastily rising, and displaying, suddenly,
to the astonished Angelo, beneath the feeble
rays of the lamp, some traits of a counte-
nance that seemed of most surpassing
beauty, " if you will promise to call upon
my father, I will return home immediately;
he could not, sure, refuse such a Signore as
you," she added, timidly, " whatever he
should request."
" Well, well, we will try," returned An-
gelo, with a smile; " but see first how he
receives you to-night; perhaps he may
relent, and there may be even no occasion
for

intercession."

" How can I, Signore? For I should
like to inform you, after all your kindness,

" Well, then," stammered Angelo, who
felt he was verging on the confines of
wrong, " well, then, you can meet me, if
you please on the hill of Pausilyppo,
near the church of Santa Maria a Fortuna."

Angelo returned home; he walked
quicker than usual, for his mind not being
perfectly at rest, he cought, by rapidity of
motion, to escape those reflections which
could not be shaken off. He clearly felt,
that, in having promised to meet the young
girl, he had acted decidedly wrong, and
conscience told him, that to keep a pro-
mise improperly made, wonld be still more
wrong. But the sophistry of inclination
urged in reply, that, however hastily, or
injudiciously a promise were given, that
nothing certainly, could
could excuse the
performance of it.
66 And I need never
see her again," added Angelo to himself;
" then why not inform Gabrielle of the
whole?" demanded conscience, " and if
aught, in a mere case of humanity, requires
to be done, act in conjunction ; since Ga-

brielle, under such circumstances, would
not hesitate, but unite with you in the de-
sire to render service. And why," objected
his worser reason, "run, unnecessarily,
even the chance of rendering Gabrielle
uneasy upon a subject, in itself so trifling,
and which may be concluded, for ever, in
less time than it would take me to relate
it? I am growing ridiculously conscien-
tious."
So argued Angelo, who forgot, in the
midst of his delusive reasoning, that " Vir-
tue is arbitrary, nor admits debate." Ga-
brielle, in consequence, received no infor-
mation ; Angelo retired to rest, harbour-
ing concealment in his mind from the
friend of his bosom; he endeavoured,
therefore, to persuade himself that he did
no wrong; and this very toleration jarred,
in a degree, those delicate fibres of affec-

95
tion, which are ultimately broken and de-
stroyed by repeated disloyalties to its faith.
Morning came, and as yet only half de-
cided, Angelo prepared to keep his appoint-
ment; still undecided, he found himself at
the spot agreed on, and did not fully know
that he had determined, till he beheld,
bounding towards him, the heavenly beauty
he was to meet. Thus progressively are
men led on to evil; too weak to be more
than negatively virtuous, nor firm enough
to resist from the first the temptations of
vice.
The moment the irresolute Angelo
beheld Paulina, his doubts and hesitations
vanished; unknowing, with alacrity, he
flew to meet her, and involuntarily held
out to her his hand. Paulina, with a mo-
dest diffidence, gave him her hand, and
advanced, raising her eyes of cerulean blue,

to the countenance of Angelo. If he had
been struck with amazement, at the slight
view he had of her charms the preceding
night, he now felt that sentiment in a
stronger degree, and was absolutely cona
fused with admiration, as he looked upon
her. Paulina was simply habited, her
dress, indeed, bespoke that the lovely
wearer was not rich; yet this
very
circum-
stance, joined to her modesty and the
blushing innocence of her deportment,
gave hier only new and exquisite graces in
the eyes of the susceptible Angelo.
Seeming unconscious of the admiration
she excited, in simple and artless language,
she related to Angelo her success with
her father; she said that he had received
her kindly, his anger being over, and pro-
fessed himself grieved for the rashness he
had been guilty of, but absolutely refused

swearing by the holy virgin, that she must
marry Castro Nardi.
Thus, Signore,

descen to speak with himn at last." An-
gelo promised her, that whenever her father
should name the day for her nuptials, pro-
vided she informed him of it, he would
make use of such arguments as should
cause him speedily to resign his intentions,
by convincing him that it would be for his
interest to do so.
Here, as this was alone the given motive
of the meeting, the interview might have
terminated ; but, not so, Angelo felt him-
self irresistibly drawn on, and he endea-
voured to believe it was compassionate in-
terest merely that influenced him in the
fate of a beautiful girl ;" he prolonged the
conversation, and was only recalled by
the observation from Paulina, that she
must hasten home. Angelo longed to

ask, the fair girl when he should behold
her again, but honor and conscience made
for once successful opposition. He resigned
reluctantly the hand which a second time
he had taken, and returned home with
less alacrity than he had departed
thence.
No appointment existed for the en-
suing day, yet Angelo mechanically bent
his steps towards the spot; the lovely
Paulina, however, was not there; he mea-
sured back his way, restless and disgusted,
and could not avoid feeling that he was
so. The succeeding day, he renewed his
attempt, and was more successful; he
persuaded himself that he neither wished,
nor expected to see the fair object who
had so much interested him; yet, spite
of himself, his eyes wandered eagerly
round, and, with a sudden joy, he beheld

her at a great distance, holding a small
basket on her arm.
Involuntarily his pace quickened; he
sought to restrain his feet, but the prin-
ciple that actuated the movement was
too strong for mechanical regulation,
and he found himself at her side, con-
fused, perturbed at his own sensations.
The fair Paulina, however, received him
with joy, though timid, unembarrassed,
and affected not to disguise the pleasure
she felt at beholding him. She offered
him some fruit from her basket, and art-
lessly observed that she had gathered and
brought it out, on purpose for him, in
case chance should procure her the plea
sure of meeting with him. How Angelo
admired this bewitching simplicity! He
admired it too much; and the conflict
between a sense of duty, and the feelings
he experienced, kept him silent. Pauline

and seeming unconscious of an idea that
she ought to suppress.-Again it devolved
on her to pronounce the parting, and
again the uneasy, conscience-stricken
Angelo, bade her a reluctant " farewell."
Weak, deluded man; each day he
became more deeply entangled in the web
weaving for his destruction; each day
his misguided sentiments acquired fresh
strength, and his peace and happiness
diminished. In vain he represented to
himself, that the course he was pursuing
was not imprudent merely, but disho-
norabie, and base; and not more disho-
norable and base towards the injured
Gabrielle, than towards the innocent
object that had allured him. What could
be foreseen as the result, but the misery
of the one, and the ruin of the other?
Could he act consistently with honor, to-

no; for honor to one, must inevitably be
baseness to the other.
Sometimes these reflections spoke so
powerfully above the weakness of his
heart, that he determined he would no
more behold the fair girl who had excited
this commotion in his breast; but these
resolutions were, unhappily transient,
displaced when he beheld her by opposite
thoughts. Then he would endeavour to
persuade himself, that simply conversing
with a young artless girl, to while away
sometimes a few moments which would
not have been better employed, could
not surely be a very momentous crime.
But these moments might have been
more innocently employed, and conse-
quently better. Besides, it was not the
conversations merely, but their tendency

and effect that made the danger, and ledi
progressively to the crime.
On those mornings when Angelo did not
behold Paulina, he became influenced for
the day; he was fretful, restless, and
uneasy. Gabrielle began to observe a
change in the naturally gay and happy
disposition of Angelo; she attributed it,
in a great degree, to the uniformity of
his life, and solicited him to go frequently
among his friends, and to seek amuse-
ment. Moreover, she studied, by every
possible attention, to increase his com-
forts at home; but vain was every effort;
the dissatisfaction and gloom of Angelo
became daily more apparent, and peace
having dwelt with them so long, now
spread her fair wings, and fled their ha-
bitation.
The interviews of Angelo with Paulina

were now become habitual. Gradually he
struggled less against the pleasure he ex-
perienced in her society, but he sought to
dupe himself into a belief, that that
pleasure was harmless, because it contained
no positive injury to any one, and because,
being unknown, it could not even convey
an imaginary one. He would not acknow-
ledge that he loved, but simply that he
was charined with Paulina. For a time he
thus aimed to deceive his reason, but soon
could no longer conceal from himself the
depth and extent of the sentiments with
which she had inspired him.
One morning that, deeply affected by the
soft smiles of his child, and the gentle
unvaried kindness of Gabrielle, he had
taken himself more severely to task than
usual for the system he was now pursuing,
yet even, while he so arraigned himself,
was walking on to the accustomed spot

wore
to meet Paulina, and she perceiving him
at a distance, hastened forward to meet
him; when taking his arm, with that in-
nocent familiarity which
such
charms to Angelo, she said to him, after
a short silence, with an air of melancholy,
" Signore, I shall certainly be obliged to
marry
Castro Nardi,--and I hate him
more than ever."
This subject for some time past had
not been touched on, it appeared even to
have been forgotten by both, but now that
it was thus revived, and introduced by
Paulina, the feelings of Angelo, at the
moment, convinced him how much he
loved. The most beautiful, the most in-
nocent, and delicate of creatures, become
the companion of a vile fisherman ; be sub-
ject now, perhaps, to his disgusting tender-
ness, and now, to the unfeeling brutality
of savage ill treatment.
The idea was

sacrilege, it could not be endured, and An-
gelo swore, with an emotion that could ne-
ver have been excited by compassionate in-
terest merely in the fate of a lovely girl, that
such an unheard-of impious sacrifice must
not, nor should not be.
"But, Signore," cried Paulina, in a
mournful voice, though her eyes sparkled
with delight, at the warmth of Angelo,
" if you were even to succeed with my
father, and prevail on him to forego his
intention of marrying me to Castro Nardi,
even then,
-should not be hap-
py."
" And why not, lovely Paulina? what
could then remain to afflict such inno-
cence ?"
" If 1,-if I,- Signore,"she stopped
confusedly.

too was silent from conflicting emotion.
The blood which had been kindling in his
cheek, from the commencement of Pau-
lina's speech now, at its conclusion, had
mounted into a crimson blush, and his
heart beat with violence against his bosom
as he falte red to himself, "She loves
me!"

sumed Paulina, timidly raising her eyes to
his face; " I hope that I have not said
any thing to offend, or
Offend me, sweet girl !No, no !"
crieil Angelo; "you have given me only
too much pleasure-pleasure which I trem-
ble to feel--yet know not how to repress."
This being above the comprehension of
Paulina, she merely said, with a smile, and
gently pressing his hand to her lips, " It
is enough for me that you are not offended
-for worlds I would not offend, or pain
you!"
" I believe it, indeed, sweet girl!"
answered Angelo, not daring to look at
her : " But, for the present, I must leave
you ;--I must fly from you !-To-mor-
row we will meet again."

Paulina cast down her eyes, and in a
broken voice she said, " Now then I see
that you are indeed angry with me;-for
never, never yet, did you propose to leave
Paulina."
" Oh ! distraction !!! cried Angelo;
pressing her in his arms, and as suddenly
releasing her. " No, no, sweet Paulina,
I am not angry; believe me, I am not, but
I must leave you, I have no power to con-
verse with you any longer." So saying he
kissed her hand--pressed it for a moment
to his heart, and tore himself away.

ANGELO returned home; his head and
heart filled with the wildest anarchy
of sensation--passion, remorse, delight,
and wretchedness; he now began to see,
too plainly, the error he had been guilty of,
in trusting himself so frequently in the so-
ciety of a fascinating object; but felt, alas!
that it was now impossible to recede; and
though his vivid imagination presented to
him images of horror around, he felt that
he must inevitably rush among themy; for
the long-smothered passion, that now
flamed in defiance of reason and honor
in his breast, had too furiously burst forth
to be restrained; he had fled-hastily fled,

and so far, for the moment, had struggled
successfully against the dangerous voice of
delusion, from the lovely and too captiva-
ting Paulina. But with dismay, and bitter
regret, he acknowledged, that he could
never more be capable of such resolution.
The remainder of the day, and the whole
night, he passed in misery and self-
accusation, but above all in thinking of
his love. The images of the injured Ga-
brielle and his unconscious child stood
before him in melancholy and reproachful
seeming, but above all towered that of
Paulina ; now that he had discovered she
loved him, to aim at victory over himself
was vain, and though he felt his error, the
seducing conviction of her tenderness, so
innocently avowed, relaxed his energy, and
incapacitated him even from the attempt.
On the following morning, according to
promise, he hastened, with trembling

eagerness once more to behold her; she
was not on the accustomed spot-he waited
with agonizing impatience-but she did
not come-he wandered to a considerable
distance-his straining eyes sought her in
every directionall was vain--and, in a
state of mind raging with grief and disap-
pointment, he was compelled to abandon
all hope of seeing her for the day, and re-
turn homewards.
The idea which tortured him most was,
that the tender and artless girl, affected at
his seeming coldness of the preceding day,
in hastening from her, could not find cou-
rage to encounter him again, and in the an-
guish that this thought inspired, he accused
himself of unnecessary cruelty and insen-
sibility towards her, and too great severity
towards himself. In consequence of this
impression, the weakness of his heart ob-
tained a triumph over his better reason,

and he determined, when next he beheld her,
by yielding with less reserve to the sweet
influence of her love, that he would endea-
vour to retrieve her happiness. When the
gloomy day, which he had passed without
feasting his eyes upon her beauty, had ex-
pired, and the sleepless and perturbed night
had likewise passed away, he repaired at an
earlier hour than usual to the hill, and
soon had the now unspeakable happiness
of beholding her on whom his mind was
fixed. He saw, and flew to meet-but
how was his happiness converted into sor-
row and alarm, when he observed that beau-
teous countenance suifused in tears.
" Heaven, my beloved Paulina !" he
exclaimed, seizing her hand, "why these

" Yes, yes, to the hateful Castro Nardi ;

upon the face of Angelo, with an expres-

I will speak to him."
" Will you ; will you, indeed ?" cried
Paulina, clapping her hands and smiling
through her tears, " Come, then, let us

The warm, precipitate Angelo put forth
his hand; Paulina seized it, and flew with,
rather than led him to a retired spot, where,
situated on the borders of a thick wood,
and almost hidden by trees, rose a lowly
hut, but seeming the abode neither

stopping, looked at Angelo with a timid
blush, and, pointing to the cottage, said,

" Can you ask me such a question ?"

said Angelo, reproachfully; and Paulina,
without waiting for more, hurried on, and
raising the latch, she entered the cottage,
whither Angelo followed, unhesitatingly.
At the further end of the room, em-
ployed in mending a fishing net, sat the
father of the fair Paulina, whom age and
ugliness rendered less forbidding than the
stern ferocity of aspect which fully conveyed
the idea, that such a man could remain for
ever inflexible to the pleadings of youth
and beauty, and insensible to the feelings of
humanity. An aged female, his counter-
part in expression of countenance, was bu-
sied over the fire; as the door opened, the
eyes of both momentarily glanced towards
it, and though Paulina came accompanied
by a stranger, the man did not arise, nei-
ther did the female relax her employment.

wondered in secret how so celestial a crea-

not wish that you should marry ine to Cas-

" Ho, ho!" cried the fisherman, Mez-
zotetto, interrupting his daughter with a
hideous grin, " this, then, is the Signore
that has turned your brain, and promised
you that he would make me alter my will;
well, then, Signore," added he, with inso-
lent contempt, looking towards Angelo,
and still continuing his employment, "hear,
now, what I am going to say; for when
I've told you my mind, I shall not speak
another word, though you stood here till
night. This girl, whom you are so oblig-
ing as to interest yourself about, is not to
be sold, like other poor girls, to any Signore

marry my old friend Castro Nardiand
more than that, she shall marry him to-mor-
row. You have heard my mind; neither
all your gold will move me to change a
tittle of it, nor all your fair speeches
to say another word."
Angelo was indignant at the insolence
and abruptness of the fisherman, while
Paulina appeared covered with confusion
at such language being addressed to him,
and knew not where to hide her head;
but indignant as was Angelo, when he
looked at the lovely girl, he suppressed his

rage, and condescended, for her sake, to
address her father. This he did in a gen-
tle and persuasive accent, representing to
him the cruelty of the sacrifice he was
about to make; and, notwithstanding
what he had observed, offering, upon con-
dition that he would abandon his purpose,
to make him any compensation he would
require.
It was in vain, however, that Angelo
thus descended; the fisherman answered
not a word; but when he found that, still
entertaining hope of effecting a change,
he made use of different arguments, and
various inducements, he suddenly rose
from his chair, and opening the door of
the hovel, looked at Angelo with a signifi-
cant nod, and pointed towards it. The
indignation of Angelo now

to strike.-Paulina flew towards him, and
seizing his uplifted arm, whispered at the
same moment, " Save me!"
This recalled his self-possession ; con-
tempt took the place of rage in his breast;
he looked tenderly and expressively at
Paulina, and with a glance of scorn at the
savage Mezzotetto, he quitted in silence
the cottage.
Soon, however, the remembrance of
the insolence he had met with was dis-
placed by considerations more momentous,
and of deeper interest. If he did not
devise some prompt means of saving Pau-
lina, on the morrow she would be immo-
lated at the shrine of grossest barbarism,
by the most unprecedented and savage
obstinacy ; every exertion would then be
vain. " No, no;" said he, quickening
his
pace, in the attempt to justify himself

for the keen solicitude he felt; nature
and common humanity forbid that such a
sacrifice should be permitted'; it becomes
a duty to endeavour to prevent it, and I
will use my best efforts." As he proceeded
he considered the means of putting his
designs in execution: a thousand various
plans suggested themselves to his heated
fancy, and in turn were eagerly embraced
and rejected.
At length, after deeply pondering, he
decided that he would return about night-
fall to the cottage, seek some means of
seeing Paulina, and not leave the spot
till he had sucecded; then, if she still
stated her father to remain inflexible,
withdraw her at once from a power he so
much abused, and place her in some secure
asylum. But withdrawing a young girl
from her parents, and placing her in ano-
ther asylum, becoming responsible for

her future fate, entailing new duties on
himself, and new difficulties ! How after-
wards to dispose of her? These refiec-
tions entered not the giddy mind of An-
gelo, or if they did, he repressed, and
would not allow himself to attend to them.
One difficulty which presented itself, and
which gave him most consideration to
surmount, was where, if it should be
necessary immediately to withdraw her,
he might for the present place her.
Suddenly lie recollected that a man,
wlio had formerly been his servant, but
who was now married and lived in the
suburbs, near Pausilyppo, would with ala-
crity perform any thing he should require,
and in his house he determined, till a more
eligible situation could be discovered, to
place her. Thus far arranged, his mind
became somewhat lightened; for, on the
impropriety, rashness, and danger, ex-

clusive of other considerations, of in-
volving himself in an affair of this nature,
he would not for a moment think.
Anxiously passed the hours with him till
dusk came on,
he left his home, no
longer pleasing to him, because of the re-
proaches it conveyed to his heart, and
wrapped in the concealment of a loose
cloak, directed his steps towards the hut of
the fisherman.
By the time he arrived, it had become
dark; he approached the lowly hovel, and
through the crevice of the shutter espied
a light within ;-drawing still nearer, he
could perceive what was passing ; he ap-
plid his eye to a small aperture, and be-
held the fair Paulina, with her father and
moiher, seated round a table, in jovial
supper, and apparent good fellowship;
the muther was laughing heartily; the
sternness of the father's features had con-

siderably relaxed, and the ever-beautiful
Paulina wore upon her's a triumphant
smile.
" How is this?" said Angelo to himself,
pausing in dismay, when the idea sug-
gested itself that the lovely Paulina had
consented to become the wife of Castro
Nardi, and thus had re-established the
harmony which appeared to reign among
them: he trembled at the thought, for he
felt, if so, that his interference would be
undesired; and however in the morning
he had pretended to himself, that duty
and humanity alone called him to active
exertion, in this case he now felt that if
that duty existed no longer, he should be
miserable, for that he had a motive still
more powerful to impel him. While he
still continued gazing, but without being
able to distinguish their conversation, he
beheld Paulina rise from the table, and ap-

seem to listen as for some sound with-

This movement revived his hopes : he
quitted instantly the window, and ad-
vancing towards the door, ventured gently
to tap against it.Immediately an answer-
ing tap from within convinced him he had
been heard ;-his heart boundedand he
remained immoveable against the door,
listening for every breath, and at every
slight movement supposing Paulina would
appear. At length, sick at heart with the
delay, once more he looked through the
casement, the lamp was extinguished, and
the only light which remained was emit-
ted from the wood fire, which still con-
tinued to blaze on the hearth. Neither
the father nor mother of Paulina were
longer visible, but in a few moments he
beheld herself, like the goddess of night,

The words so artlessly expressed, "after

Angelo; he drew the hand of Paulina

reason! honor! all, all was lost, in the
overpowering delusion of the moment;
he pressed Paulina in his arms, and now
felt, beyond the power of sophistry to
prevent, how much, and how completely
he was, and had been throughout, the
slave of the most consuming passion!
All further hesitations, all further struggles,
were now from the question; he seized
the hand of the bewitching girl, and led
her rapidly along, till they reached the
abode where, for the present, he desired
to place her. Arrived, by the help of
certain arguments that speak in a lan-
guage ever most convincing to vulgar
minds, the possessors of the house, who
were besides under extensive obligations
to Angelo, received, without a single
question, and without the slightest demur,
the lovely Paulina beneath their roof; for
indifferent were they to the fate of youth

and innocence, careless respecting its sa-
crifice or preservation, further than their
own interest might be concerned.
Here, then, in a tumult of love and
agitation, the rash imprudent Angelo left,
reluctantly, his beauteous charge, after
giving every order for her accommoda-
tion, and tenderly promising that he would
see her early on the following day. He
had now entered too dreadfully deep in the
path of error, to think even of retracting ;
his whole thoughts were of Paulina.
She agitated his heart with the strongest
emotions of passion ;-his brain she filled
with eternal anarchy ;-he visited her
daily ;-he could enjoy no happiness when
ont of her presence ;the hours he passed
not with her, hung heavy with dis-
gust ;--and perpetual fears tormented him,
lest the beloved of his heart should be
discovered in her present asylum, so ineli-
gible, so unworthy of her, by her father,

or perhaps by Castro Nardi; but, above
all, lest Gabrielle, that injured Gabrielle,
of whom he dreaded to think, should
learn his apostacy, and seek in person to
convince herself of the truth.
These were the ideas that racked and
disquieted him, and were some alloy to the
guilty pleasures he enjoyed. One morning
Paulina informed him, that on the prece-
ding evening she had observed two men
walking to and fro, beneath her window,
one of whom, she was almost certain, was
her father. Angelo, alarmed, felt all his
fears on the point of being verified ; his
mind became filled with a thousand differ-
ent plans for the security of his cherished
prize; he would have moved her instantly
to another habitation, but remembered
that all places might be equally insecure
beyond the moment.

How much, however, were his apprehen-
sions increased, when on the following
morning she told him, with a countenance of
alarm, that so late as after his departure the
night before, standing as usual at the win-
dow to catch a last glance of his person, she
beheld a female of a commanding figure,
and wrapped in a loose mantle, issue as it
were from the house, (though of that she
could not be certain, as the situation of her
window prevented her from having a view of
the door,) and follow him at a slow pace
as long as he remained in sight, still keep-
ing a short distance from him.
This intelligence struck him with dis-
may far exceeding what he had yet felt,
and it was not diminished when he sud-
denly remembered, that on returning home
last night, Gabrielle was not as usual sit-
ting up for him ; but on enquiry he had
learned, that she had retired early to her

own apartment. Instantly this vague as-
sociation of circumstances struck him with
the idea that she must have watched his
steps, traced him to the house, remained
till she saw him leave it, and then, follow-
ing him home, have returned secretly to
her own apartment. He immediately con-
cluded, therefore, that he was betrayed to
her by the very persons with whom Paulina
was placed, and whom, although he had
not confided to them aught, might, if they
chose, inform her of sufficient to excite her
jealousy and suspicion.
These reflections filled him with con-
fusion and perturbation ; he perceived the
necessity, so deemed by him, of taking
instantly some certain measures to pre-
serve Paulina from the dreadful conse-
quences of discovery. To his terrified
imagination it now appeared that she was
beset by danger, and that not a moment

Paulina, who appeared to read in his varying
countenance the distraction of his n ind,
affectionately pressing his hand to her bo-
som, said, " Ah, dearest Angelo,' work we
were in another land; any where that I
might behold you happy, and at ease."
Angelo, who had been revolving in his
mind the best plan to follow, was roused by
this sentiment-he looked at Paulina; a
dreadful idea glanced through his brain-
he trembled to pursue it, more still to in-
dulge it; yet, involuntarily, in an eager
voice, he exclaimed, "Could you, could
you be happy with me in another land,
Paulina ?"
"Happy!" returned Paulina, with an
air of reproach, and fixing on him, with
the softest tenderness, her dark blue eyes,
" Now surely, Angelo, you have asked

doubt that I could be happy with you on

in a savage forestany where."
" Oh, say no moresay no more,"cried
Angelo, pressing his hand to his forehead,

me, and make me more a wretch than I
am ! Did I bid you be silent ? Could I?
Oh, repeat again what you have so sweetly
said."
Nay, dearest Angelo, look not so
wildly, and I will repeat, that I could be
happy with you any where; without you, no
where."
Tis done,"cried Angelo, starting up and
gazing upon her; this, this is the work of
fate; such transcendant beauty as your's
should never have been thrown in the

be enslaved by it ;-but-but the die is
now cast ;" and, pressing her in his arms,
" mine you are by choice, and mine now,
in despite of every consideration, you shall
continue to be; not fate itself shall have
power to break those ties it hath so closely
entwined.-I leave thee, Paulina, for a
short time; I leave thee--heaven be thy
guard meanwhile."
Like every determination, however rash,
wild, or imprudent, which entered the er-
ring mind of Angelo, he dwelt on this
with a spirit of infuriate ardor and adhe-
rence, which, till put in force, allowed him
repose neither night nor day. To quit
Italy with a girl whom scarcely he could
be said to know, but whose uncommon per-
sonal beauty had fascinated his senses and
enslaved his reason, who was devoid of
the divine charn which alone adds interest

compensate, nothing but a graceful naivet
of manner, or expression ; all this appeared
no longer a plan of folly and of danger,
or replete with injury or baseness to others;
his violent and uncontrollable passion
carried all before it, and superseded every
consideration of reason, honor, or duty.
" It is in vain, it is in vain," he would
say to himself; " I respect, I venerate the
virtues of Gabrielle, but I adore to dis-
traction the too beauteous Paulina. Lov-
ing another, then, I can no longer make
her happy; to remain with her, while my

and the cruel idea of robbing him from
Gabrielle, to make him the innocent part-
ner of his intended flight, for the moment
suggested itself and was paused on: "but,

father is guilty." Then, urged by a re-
proaching conscience not to inflict upon
the unconscious Gabrielle an unnecessary
pang, he would reluctantly consider, for a
moment, the feasibility of his still continu
ing with her, and whether it might not
be possible to retain, secure and unmolested,
the fair object of his love, without depart-
ing from Italy ; but soon this idea he re-
jected, on the plea of future discovery, if it
were not already certain ; then should he
have to encounter bitter, because merited

alternative of departure.
Once decided on this point, home be-

intoxicated with the beauty of Paulina,
resolved, yet involuntarily hesitating to
strike the dreadful blow upon the head of
the wretched Gabrielle, his blood in an un-

remorse, he became impatient to fix at once
the cruel moment of departurefor the
consciousness of intended crime was still
more dreadful than the commission of it;

The fatal step was taken; suddenly and
secretly, with Paulina he quitted Naples ;-
he deserted the unhappy Gabrielle ! he de-
serted his child! he yielded to the seduc-

It will now be necessary to go
few steps of this history, and return to
Oriana, whose vengeful rage, and una-
bated malice has been in a former period
alluded to, and stated to have remained long
abortive. But though such was in reality
the case, and although upwards of two
years had elapscd in fruitless machina-
tions and vain attempts, Oriana was not
to be thus baffled ; obstacles which long
since must have discouraged a less vin-
dictive mind, seemed but to add fuel to the
hate which burned in her ; she still con-
tinued to watch every movement of the

objects of her long-desired vengeance ;
the desire of vengeance was the predc-
minent sensation of her soul, and for
that she seemed to abandon every other
consideration.
Not even her regard for the op-
posite sex had now a power of detach-
ing her mind, for any length of time,
from the contemplation of her highest
aim. In every blooming youth she be-
held a second
second Eugene ; the remem-
brance of the shame and disgrace she had
suffered was excited afresh; and she .
trembled lest deception might lurk, and
she again commit herself. Against Ga-,
brielle were her lonr-continued turbu-
lent emotions chiefly indulged. Angelo,
whom she had never loved, she did not
now hate suiliciently to desire above
every thing his destruction. She consi-
dered him merely as a means to work the

She knew him to be fickle, variable,
ardent, and susceptible ; and it
upon this knowledge that she chiefly

mischief she meditated.

Wearied by a recourse to arts and strata-
gems hitherto unavailing, she determined
upon organising a system which should
be so perfectly regulated in all its parts,
and so indefatigably persevered in, that
no human foresight or skill should be
capable of circumventing it. Oriana
was truly a Genoese, cunning as they all
are, inured to hardships, patient, and
persevering, above the rest of the Ita-
lians; and, naturally poor, they make up,
by an indefatigable industry, for the
niggardliness of fortune towards them.

There is a celebrated proverb respecting
them, that they have a sea without fish,
a land without trees, and men without
faith: perhaps women may be included in
the latter stricture, which could not be
better applied than to Oriana.
When a child, she had been placed by
her parents with the wife of a poor fisher-
man, living in a hut by the side of the
Bonzevera, to be nursed;

pected to have received for the care

left their forlorn infant upon their hands,
they determined, though sorely smarting
under the lash of poverty, and bitterly
disappointed, to endeavor to do the best
they could, rather than abandon to de-
struction an unoffending child.
Oriana accordingly remained with the
fisherman and his wife, who did not find that
the addition of her slender support rendered
them poorer than they were before. Nor
when the wife of the fisherman, a few
years after this event, presented him with
a daughter, did they look with altered eye
upon
the little Oriana, or turn her adrift;
they brought her up with their own
daughter, and still contrived to live.
When Oriana arrived at an age to com-
prehend, she was made fully sensible, but
without reproach, of the obligations un.
der which she existed to her benefactors,
and she promised, that if she lived she

or
would endeavour to repay to the atmost
the kindness she had received. This
pro:
mise, without entering more minutely than
is necessary into her history, the unhappy
girl faithfully kept. In process of time,
when requiring no longer their protection
care, but towering above them in
meretricious splendor, she did not add in-
gratitude to them, in the catalogue of her
vices; she did not forget, or consider
inferior to her, the obscure guardians of
her early youth, but transferred them from
the wretched hovel where long she had
existed with them, to a commodious and
comparitively sumptuous residence; be-
stowed on them a share of her comforts
and advantages, and suffered the tide of
her fortune to flow in a degree towards
them.
In consequence of this, the fisherman

both from gratitude and early habit to
her, who, from a deserted and dependant
orphan upon them, had become their bene-
factress; and it would have been a task of
difficulty for Oriana to have proposed to them
that which they would have hesitated to com-
ply with. These were the persons then,
who in the organisation of her proposed
plan presented themselves to her mind, as
ready and willing assistants, and fit and
perfect instruments for
for carrying into
execution her cherished vengeance, too
long delayed. Hastening to them, there-
fore, soon as her ideas were sufficiently
arranged, she first exacted from each an
oath of secrecy, and then imparting to
them as much of her views as she con-
sidered necessary, she explained to Mez-
zotetto the part she desired him to act,
and in what way he could best forward the
hope of vengeance, burning at her heart,
which long she confessed had destroyed

(from being unaccomplished) her every
pleasure, and which, if remaining much
longer thus, must hasten her, in despair,
to an untimely grave.
Mezzotetto, his wife, and daughter,
the latter of whom was intended to act a
most conspicuous part in this infamous
drama, at hearing this last declaration of
Oriana, prayed her to dismiss such
gloomy thoughts, and to rely upon them
wholly, entering with the deepest interest
into the sentiments of their adopted child,
sympathising in the bitterness of her in-
sulted feelings, approving of her determi-
nation to revenge the outrages she had
sustained, and promising to go hand in
hand with her, in whatever she should de-
cree; and unhesitatingly exert their best
efforts to meet her views.

This was no more than Oriana expected;
sh,e thanked her father and mother, how-
ever, for such she would still continue, to
their great satisfaction, to call them, for
the aid they so readily offered, and bidding
them farewell, departed with the utmost
exultation, accompanied by Paulina Mez-
zotetto, their daughter, whom they cheer-
fully resigned to be governed by her will
and pleasure.
Paulina was some years younger than
Oriana, and bore the appearance of being
still younger than she was.
Her beauty
was of that peculiar cast which may be
termed heavenly, for her face accurately
resembled all that the finest painting has
suggested, or the imagination conceives,
of the Angel; her form possessed a sylphic
delicacy, and that want of careless ease
which in another might have been the
resu't of ignorance, or vulgarism, but

151
seemed in her the graceful timidity of
innocent beauty. It appeared as though
nature, in a freak, had determined to
combine all that was beautiful and perfect
in an obscure individual, but to give lier
neither mind, heart, nor soul, that she
might show how gloriously she could em-
beilish a casket, which yet should contain
nothing. The loveliness of Paulina's
person was, indeed, the only quality of
beauty she possessed.
Frequent coininunication with Oriana
had early corrupted her principles. She
had praised her exquisite beauty, and this
had excited a confusion of ideas in her mind,
which inevitably laid the foundation of her
future depravity, from having taught her
to value this cherislied beauty, as her
highest merit, and most valuable possession.
She had entered eagerly into the designs
of Oriana, yielded implicitly to all she had

proposed, and in the prospect so pleasing
to her ignorant and contaminated mind, of
being called into action, though only as the
tool of another, she hoped that a field
might be opened for herself, wherein her
beauty might procure her similiar advan-
tages with these appearing to be enjoyed
by the vile and miserable Oriana.
Accordingly the Genoese had found it
no difficult task to instruct so willing a
pupil in the part she was to act. Paulina,
whose natural cunning was on a par with
the depravity of Oriana, readily compre-
hended, and as readily acquiesced in all that
was required of her. Every arrangement
then being accurately made, and their plan
of action put in train, the Genoese expe-
rienced a sensation of joy in the prospect
of at length scattering and destroying
those she hated, such as long had been un-
known to her breast; for the continued
contemplation of her desired and insatiate

revenge had literally deprived her of
peace
and rest; already she led the life of the
tortured upon earth, racked with never-
ceasing pain.
How her dire hopes became realized,
how her arts succeeded, and how justly
she had estimated the weakness of Angelo,
has been seen; assisted in her efforts, and
powerfully seconded by the seducing
auxiliary of matchless beauty in the person
of Paulina, her triumph was complete, and
the full measure of destruction, full even as
the craving vengeance of her soul could
desire, heaped upon the head of the mise-
rable Gabrielle.
To her, unconscious as yet of the hor-
rors bursting over her, we now return. It
was long ere this unhappy victim of early
rror and misfortune suspected the full ex-
ent of her misery; true, she had long seen,

and seen with pain, that Angelo had
differed strangely during the last few
months from the excellent and tender An-
gelo that for two years preceding he had
uniformily been; but this change of de-
meanor she attributed to almost any thing
but the true cause. She knew that Angelo
had a propensity to deep play, that he loved
wine, and that when he had indulged in
the latter, he was but too apt to fall into the
error of the former. She conceived it
pro-
bable that he might have lost considerably,
and she was in this case too delicate and
too high minded to remark his varying de-
portment,now restless, now abstracted,
now fretful, or reserved. She fondly flat-
tered herself, that kindness and attention
would recal him to himself, and that, if cir-
cumstances were as she suspected, they
might ultimately even prove beneficial, by
operating as a severe though radical cure
against all future similar excesses,

155
What still more tended to exclude every
idea of a different nature, was the doting
- fondness with which he still continued to
regard his child, and sometimes with an
enthusiasm of tenderness, even till the tears
started to his eyes. Little did she surmise
the real source of those tears, which were
excited at the thought of soon ceasing to
behold him, or of becoming a wretch still
viler, by snatching him from the bosom of
a mother. Even in his moodiest moments
he would play with him, and fondle him
with a mixture of pain, and eager delight,
such as to dispel for a time his guiltier
thoughts.
Never could Gabrielle suspect so far the
honor and faith of Angelo, as, situated
as he was, to suppose for an instant, that
any other female could attract, much less
employ his attention,-for the insinua-
tion of the base Paulina to Angelo was
wholly unfounded :-Gabrielle had neither

suspected, nor had ever watched his move-
ments; the fabrication was at the instiga-
tion of the fiend Oriana, for the purpose
of inducing the deluded Angelo to hasten
every measure, and to commit himself be-
yond the power of redemption. Gabrielle
was besides so rational, so liberally just in
her conceptions, although so enthusiastic
in her feelings, that she could make infi-
nite allowances for the variations of manner,
conduct, or disposition. She considered
Angelo as a firm and faithful husband, who
was fond in spirit, rather than in profession;
not as a lover who, with a new object, is
all rapture and tender endearment. Su-
perior sense, and finediscrimination, taught
her, that the female who desires to be hap-
py, must forego all the idle gratifications
of vanity, or foolish 'egotism; and that
the female who loves, and is beloved, may
readily sacrifice these nothings at the shirine
of reason.
## p. 157 (#439) ############################################
THE LIBERTINE.
157
Thus, then, when at last the fatal truth
burst upon her, it came like the light-
ning's flash, which for a time dries up and
palsies every faculty. Angelo had been for
some time past in the habit of returning
home at an extreme late hour of the night,
but had never yet remained absent for the
whole of it. Still, when the first night
elapsed and he did not return, Gabrielle
in her mind palliated it, for she considered
that he might have been by some friends
prevailed on to dine at a distance from town,
and afterwards not to venture back over
some unfrequented road, at an unseason-
able hour. Thus, though she experienced
a slight pang at the inattention of Angelo,
once so unusual with him, but now, alas ! too
frequent, she did not suffer much uneasi-
or alarm.
When the following
morning arrived however, noon, evening,
and night came on, and still no appearance
of Angelo, the thoughts of Gabrielle were

of some terrible cause for delay, some un-
foreseen accident or disaster. How could
a mind so generous, so noble, and so con-
scious in itself of not meriting the cruel-
est injury that could be offered woman,
suspect for an instant the real cause of An-
gelo's absence ?
At length the second night passed away,
and Gabrielle, now alarmed and agitated
beyond endurance, imagined nothing less
than midnight assassination.
Her thoughts wandered to Oriana ;
she dismissed in horror the idea ; again and
again they reverted to her, fixed on her,
and could not be withdrawn. Angelo did
not return; who but her could desire or
plan his death? Yielding to a sudden im-
pulse of despair, scarce knowing what she
intended, and incapable of consideration,
she determined to see her. The thought

159
and the execution were almost one, she
flew to her house with a wild rapidity, and
on gaining admittance, burst immediately
into the well-known apartment, where
usually Oriana sat : there she beheld the
fierce machinating fiend, who, calm and
triumphant, was exulting in idea over the
hayoc she had caused. Gabrielle stood be-"
fore her-gazed upon her for a moment;
she read her fate in her eyes, and clasping
her hands together, with pale and frenzied
countenance, she exclaimed, " Tell me-
tell me, I conjure you, where is Angelo!
Where is
my
husband !"
Oriana cast on her a glance, in which
all the dreadful passions of her mind
were depictedhate, malice, ruthless re-
venge, and barbarous triumph; then,
with a smile which language cannot de-
scribe, she said, " Angelo D'Albini is not
with me you perceive, Signora ; where

else he is, no doubt himself will soon
inform you."
" Oh, lives he, lives he to inform me?"
wildly exclaimed Gabrielle; "sure, if he did,
long since I should have known."
" It is quite impossible, you know, Sig-
nora," observed Oriana, with a cutting
coolness, " to account for the caprices of
men ; in all probability the Conte is still
living ; but as he .once preferred you, and
then me, and then you again, you be-
ing condescending enough to receive him,
it is not impossible but he may now prefer
another to you. However, fear not, perhaps
he
may return to you again still."
At this horrible insiruation, and the air
with which it was delivered, the most dis-
tracting ideas presented themselves to Ga-
brielle, who knew not on what to fix. That

Oriana was informed respecting Angelo, she
could not avoid believing ; but to the hint of
his infidelity she attached not :he smallest
credit, conceiving that Oriana merely inti-
mated this to delude and give her pain.
From her obdurate and malicious coun-
tenance, however, she clearly beheld she had
nothing to expect; to interrogate her would
be vain and she therefore merely said,
while her towering spirit gained for a mo-
ment some ascendancy over the anguish of
her heart, " Wretched woman! though
I shudder at your depravity, I disdain your
insinuations, and despise your malice;
Angelo has so long escaped your abomina-
ble machinations, I trust in heaven he may
escape them still, and, to the confusion of
your hopes, unchanged and uninjured
soon return.

struck with horror, hastened from her
presence; "not to you, not to you," she
repeated, and her demoniac peals of
laughter continued to echo in her ears
till she had escaped beyond the verge of
its sound.
The next step of the distracted Ga-
brielle was to make application to all
those friends of Angelo with whom she
was acquainted, for some intelligence re-
specting him, but in vain; not any of
his friends had been lately in the habit
of seeing him; and now for the first
time it was, when Gabrielle called - to
mind his perpetual absence from home,
that something like suspicion glanced for
a moment across her mind. Where, then,
could he have been, if, as it appeared,
not among his friends ? Wonder, alarm,

.but to await the moment that should
explain to her his mysterious disappear-
ance, his present fate, or future intention.
At length this anxiously desired, yet
terrible moment arrived, the moment
which was to give her information of the
man, who having first involved her in
the most dreadful misfortunes, prepared
now to give them a climax ; to let her
behold, traced by his hand, those hor-
rible characters, which were to reveal
to her his perfidy and ingratitude! A
letter, post-mark of Calais, was the form,
in which this cruel communication met
the astonished and almost incredulous
eyes of the bewildered Gabrielle. At
each line she read, her heart beat with
increased violence-dreadful ideas of
her own situation, and the future fate of
her child, like horrible phantoms gleamed

dalliance had palled, missing the refined

lamented his vices, had not the fortitude

The unhappy Gabrielle, whose fall had
been beard by a domestic in the next room,
was conveyed immediately to bed, and every
means administered to restore her senses; but
her mind had received a blow which reason
could not overcome; violent fever and de-
lirium seized her, and she was speedily
reduced to a state such as made it impro-
bable she would long live to deplore, or
smart under her manifold injuries.
Angelo in the mean time proceeded to
England, reached London, and there esta-
blishing himself for a time, the stings of re-
morse and uneasy reflection were blunted by
the frivolous gaieties in which he indulged,
by exhibiting the beautiful Paulina to the
ephemeral futterers of the day, by hearing
the praises bestowed on her person, and by

exciting her idle wonder, and shallow ob-
servations, at the scenes so new to her.
But it is impossible to be always im-
mersed in amusement, which soon ceases
to be esteemed so, when the spirits become
exhausted; it is impossible to gaze always
upon a lovely countenance with equal ad-
miration, for the senses becoming satiated,
the heart requires something more-some-
thing to interest, to delight, to fix beyond
the moment.
In a union like that of
Angelo with Paulina, where passion and
the wandering senses were alone the basis,
the rapture of enthusiasm soon cools, the
effervescence of the senses subsides, indif-
ference succeeds to ardour, and to indif-
ference disgust.
In such an union, too,
where there is no solid foundation for the.
mind on which to rest, there are inevita-
bly many moments and many hours,

love in this instance we may not call
it, must be vacant, oppressive and inane.
The mind cannot be for ever on the stretch,
the calm and social pleasures of intellectual
intercourse are necessary to refresh, and to
invigorate it, and then alone can it be truly
said that love becomes a rational, blissful,
and refined enjoyment.
Though still intoxicated by her match-
less beauty, the eyes of the misguided
Angelo opened by degrees. He still
beheld before him those enchanting fea-
tures, and that blooming form, but he
saw nothing beyond them, and even those
he saw daily with decreased admiration, be-
cause daily they became more familiar in
his sight. He could now discern, e'en
through the delusive charms of that beau-
teous countenance, a dearth of every finer
quality of the mind; but time convinced
him soon it wanted not the more ignoble
characteristics of cunning, and mercenary

selfishness; for Paulina, having now gained
her aim, and satisfied Oriana, was no
longer anxious to appear to Angelo the
thing she was not. Her modest deport-
ment, bashful innocence, and timidity,
gradually, nay quickly, vanished. She
became bold, tyrannical, capricious, and,
presuming on the misplaced fondness of
Angelo, extravagant and ridiculous in her
requests. Thus, while she disgusted him
by her extreme folly, she made him wretched
by the conduct she pursued, and painfully
awakened him from the dream of enchant.
ment by which he had been misled.
Now then it was, that the ill-fated Ga-
brielle appeared before him in the full per-
fection of her real beauty ; never, till this
time, had he so fully appreciated her; she
stood before him, decked in the bright
glory of her various virtues ; she held his
forsaken child in her arins, and regarded

him in mournful accusation. From this
vision of pain, because of happiness
scorned and cast away, he hurried in an-
guish to Paulina for consolation ; he saw
still that fair face, but he saw in it those
traces of a grovelling and worthless mind,
which experience had revealed to him ex-
isted, disguised no longer by the transitory
siniles of artless innocence.
"Oh, is it possible!" would he men-
tally exclaim, in regarding the altered ob-
ject before him, " is it possible, that I
could ever have been so deceived? Can
this be the soft creature, whose trembling
innocence, whose blushing simplicity, ex-
cited first my love? No, no, it cannot be
her, but some fiend rather, who, to pu-
nish me, has assumed her form.

mistress Oriana, was utterly incapable of

towards Angelo a perfect indifference;
respecting his pride and his feelings as
little as she did his happiness, took every
opportunity of mortifying the one, and
of insulting the other, by the most flagrant
levity of deportment towards such of his
friends, as, to divert the vacuum of those
hours he must have passed in her society
only, he thought it expedient to invite.
Indeed she did not disguise from Angelo
that she prefered the conversation of other
men to his, and gave as her reason, with
an appearance of archness, but real sin-
cerity, that she was weary of continually
regarding the same object. Thus had he
the mortification of seeing himself foiled
at his own weapons,-fickleness and love
of novelty.
A few months elapsed, and a perfect
revolution having taken place in the mind
of Angelo, he decided, in the bitterness of

guilty heart to the deeply injured Gabrielle,

CHAPTER XVI.
When the conduct of Paulina became in-
supportable to Angelo, which it frequently
did, he would rush from the house, and, a
solitary being in the midst of society, seek
out some temporary amusement to, lrown
the uneasiness and dissatisfaction of his
mind. Often, rather than return home,
he would wander for hours about the
streets, dreading to encounter the fierce-
ness of Paulina's resentment, on some
frivolous pretext, or for some alledged
ault, of which he would be unconscious.
One night, that her procedure had

177
been more than ordinarily violent and
disgusting, he had left her abruptly, and,
quitting the
house, determined to
remain out to a late hour, prefering any
discomfort attendant on that plan, to
the misery of enduring her society, in
such a temperament of mind. When at
length he gathered resolution to return,
Paulina, to his infinite joy, was not to be
seen ; concluding she had retired to her
apartment, he hastily sought his own, too
happy to have escaped a scene which he
had anticipated with pain and apprehension.
As he entered his rcom, a letter on his
dressing table attracted his attention; he
took it up carelessly, and with astonish-
ment read thus :
6. COUNT,
" I never loved you, and why I pretended
to do so, you may at one time or another

richer and more agreeable; with him I quit
England, which, but for reasons stronger
than my regard for you, I had never entered.

;
This rude and illiterate scrawl over-
whelmed Angelo with the deepest indigna-
tion; and, true to his nature, no sooner
did he find that the worthless Paulina was
lost to him, 'than she appeared before him
decked in her thousand charms. In the
first heat of passionate regret, he deter,

mined to pursue her ; but suddenly he
remembered, with a thrill of real delight
that superseded every other consideration,
that he was now wholly at liberty,
disencumbered of one whom he had long
learned to view with other eyes than those
of admiration, more humbly, more earnestly
than ever, to sue the forgiveness of the
injured Gabrielle. On this idea he dwelt
with delight, that he should once more
behold her, and that she would look on
him with pity and tender pardon.
Ever sudden, variable, and precipitate,
he penned in the enthusiasm of the
moment, ere he retired to bed, a letter
to Gabrielle, which he resolved it should
be the first act of the morning to dispatch,
and with sentiments less of regret for
Paulina, than fear lest Gabrielle should
still remain inflexible, he sought repose-

its purport :

This letter on the following morning he
e gerly dispatched ;-a week, a fortnight,
a inonth elapsed, and no reply. Steady for
once beyond the impulse of the moment
to the object he had in view, and perse-
vering beyond his nature, because he could
roi avoid perceiving there was that which,

merited perseverance, he wrote again a letter
more pressing, more imploring than before;
yet still no answer arrived; and, with the
deepest grief, though not wholly unmixed
with an indignant feeling at the insensibi-
lity of Gabrielle, and the immoveable con
tempt she evinced towards him, he in the
mortified pride of his despised humility,
resolved that he would address her no more,
nor recal again to her remembrance one
whom she appeared so desirous to forget.
" Ah! too surely," thought he, while
stinging jealousy and the most griev-
ous regret still tore his heart at the

affections upon another.She loves with-
out remorse, for she considers that I have

native goodness, unwilling to wound me
by an avowal of her sentiments or conduct,
she preserves an entire silence, hoping it
may prove sufficient explanation to me."
Sometimes disgusted by the inanity
and unprofitableness of the amusements in
which he plunged, to banish, or at least tem-
porarily to dissipate the melancholy which
possessed him, he would paus on the idea
of quitting England, returning to Naples,
and of presenting himself, unlooked for
and unannounced, before the eyes of Ga.
brielle. "But wherefore, wherefore" he
would suddenly exclaim-"perhaps un-

willing to be mine, but bestowing on
another that love, those tender assiduities,

have been, I cannot so humble myself at
the feet of her who despises me."
Suffering thus, in some degree, the
merited punishment of his conduct, for
the present we leave him, and revert to
the situation of Gabrielle..
The
purpose of the infamons Oriana
would have been but half answered, if
Angelo, deluded but for a moment only
by the arts and beauty of Paulina, whom.
she well knew, beyond a certain period
would be incapable of detaining him, had
then followed the impulse naturally at-
tendant on his restoration to reason, and
returned humbled, repentant, and implo-
ring, to the feet of the forsaken Gabrielle.
Therefore, to obviate the possibility of
such a result, it was requisite for her to
gain constant intelligence of the move-
ments of Paulina from her own hand,

185
that she might be thereby prepared for
those of Angelo. Thus, when Paulina
informed her, that, not only weary to
disgust of Angelo, she desired to make
him weary of her, and, subsequently, of
their mutual dislike for each other, and
of her determination to quit hin for
one more suited to lier taste, Oriana
justly anticipated that he would imme-
diately endeavour to effect a re-union
with Gabrielle, and prevail on her to for-
give the past; thus these two persons,
so abhorrent to. her, and at the idea of
whose happiness she sickened, might,
and would be, ultimately restored to each
other, and her machinations would have no
other effect than that of cementing them
in bonds still closer than before. Her
mind became racked with jealous malice
- and "corrding fear; she put in requisi-
tion every
power of mischievous in-
vention she possessed, determined; if

possible, to prolong for ever the period
of their mutual misery.
Gabrielle had for an attendant about
her
person, a female who was far more
fitted to have been the attendant of an
Oriana. With this female the plotting
Genoese contrived to procure acquain-
tance, and by gifts, promises, and the
offer of taking her into her service, if
dismissed by Gabrielle, prevailed on her
to undertake, without hesitation, what-
ever she required of her.
Through the means of this woman she
was duly and accurately informed of
whatever concerned her mistress, even to
the merest trifle; and, when she learned
from:Paulina, her informant on the other
-side, of the effect which her altered con-
duct appeared to have produced upon him,
she gave strict charge to this perfidious
menial to keep vigilant watch for any

letters that might arrive, directed for
Gabrielle, and bring tirem instantly to
her. This part of her infamous requisition
was but too well fulfilled; every letter
which arrived from Angelo was readily
yielded to her by the inferior domestics,
for the purpose of conveying them to
Gabrielle, which she as regularly carried
to. Oriana, who thus became possessed
with the knowledge of those tender and
remorseful sentiments with which Angelo
was inspired, and that he cherished for the
injured Gabrielle a love stronger than ever.
Her rage and hatred increased at this
discovery; bitter envy, and burning desire
of redoubled vengeance, shook her breast,
and her wild and ferocious sensations could
only be temporarily allayed by the horrible
exultation which she experienced at re-
ceiving one of those invaluable epistles
which would have restored the unconscious

Gabrielle from the brink of the grave, and
destroying it with an infuriate violence and
malice truly infernal.
The effects of a fine constitution,
strengthened by a long residence among
the health-breathing mountains of Switz-
erland, triumphed, though slowly, over the
ravages of a most desperate malady ; for
some months even she continued in a state
fluctuating, as it were, between life and
death, an alternate increase and diminu-
tion of fever, delirium, and of moping me-
lancholy. At length she was pronounced
- to be free from danger, though her weak-
ness continued such, notwithstanding this
declaration, as to threaten, momentarily,
that the trembling spark of life must be-
come extinquished. Gradually these symp-
.toms yielded to returning strength, and,
: with returning bodily strengh, became re-
newed the strength of her superior mind,

A short time further elapsed, and the
wretched Gabrielle aroused herself in horror
from the state of calm despair into which she
was sinking. She beheld, that if some
means were not speedily adopted, herself
and child must perish, literally of want;
for, though she could now bear to review
the letter of Angelo, (the only one which,
having arrived prematurely, had not been
intercepted by the base minion of Oriana)
and consequently knew that her drafts to any
amount would be honored by his banker's
agent, she disdained, with the noble spirit of
a Montmorency, to avail herself of the com-
passionate liberality of a man who, at the
same time, could so cruelly outrage her
feelings ;she scored to owe that to the
dictates of his honor or humanity, which she
could owe no longer to his love.
Thus she was determined to perish,
rather than be indebted to him for the
## p. 190 (#472) ############################################

means of existence, and, when she regarded
her child, and burst into a flood of tears,
her resolution did not alter, and she ex-
claimed, " Yes, my boy, we will perish to-
gether ; thou shalt lie on my bosom, and
die with me, for surely the crime of
per-
mitting thee to die, would be less than
that of prolonging, by unworthy means,
thy existence, deprived as thou now art of
every hope and prospect of a father's pro-
tection-we will die together then, and
thus wilt thou escape the protracted mi-
series, the want, and the misfortunes, that
are in store for thee."
By degrees, however, her fine reason
began to assert itself, and to prevail over
these gloomy and despairing thoughts.
Her rational and sublime piety, too, taught
her, that, feeble mortal as she was, she
should not dare to take the sceptre from
the hands of fate, and mark out the for-

191
tunes of another. It taught her, too, to rely
upon the supreme wisdom, which is all
competent to the protection and direction
of its creatures, and not presumptuously,
because of the wanderings or errors of a
mere mortal, doubt the mercy of God,
or limit his power to save, in conjunction
only with man. The child, forsaken by its
natural father, would find a superior one
in heaven, and, yielding to the holy in-
fluence of divine religion, which ever
inspires hope, and soothes the soul, she
now resolved to exert her energies anew,
and call into action those powers of mind
with which she was so superlatively gifted.
It was but for the finely organized mind
of Gabrielle to make a successful effort
over the weakness of nature, it was but
for her to acquire fortitude enough to
take a review of circumstances, to oppose
the better line of action to the worse, and

to decide then, with a spirit and judge-
ment equalled only by the promptness of
execution.
Having then acquired the firmness to
pauise with unshrinking eye upon her si-
tuation, she beheld immediately all that
was requisite to be performed,---she saw
that want, absolute want, must shortly ap-
proach, yet proudly resolving to adhere to
her first principle of owing nothing to the
charity of Angelo, she, as a first means of
retarding the advances of the gaunt fiend,
gave up her sumptuous residence, and
discharged her attendants; this was not
only a plan of wisdom and necessity, but
a plan likewise to her of great though
unsuspected advantage, for it proved the
ostensible means of ridding her of the
perfidious snake whose treachery had
caused her to drink so deeply of the cup
of misery. She then, unaccompanied

but by her child, whose tender age ex-
ceeded scarce three years, quitted Naples
so secretly, and so disguised, as to elude
even the indefatigable vigilance of Oriana.
The small sum which remained to her,
after having defrayed every demand, she
flattered herself would be sufficient to bear
them to England, whither she had decided
to go; and far from weakly shuddering at
the venturous attempt,

said she mentally, " when still younger,
and far more a stranger to the world than
now I am, quit my once happy mountains,

innocence ?---to seek him for the sake of
his child, that he might protect and
cherish it, when I, worn out with calamity
and ceaseless remorse, should be no more?
And shall I now, when the dangers and
the difficulties are comparatively slight,
shrink at doing less than I have already

done? No; to his children I will implore
Angelo to be just; let their mother be co-
vered with obloquy, despised, and unpitied
by the world; but let them be saved, and
she will die content."
Amid the gloomy reflections of the
unhappy Gabrielle, it was no small consola-
tion to her, that the young Agnes, uncon-
scious of her mother's sorrows, was still
happy, and protected by a tender friend.
How did she now in silent, though pro-
found gratitude, bless the wise counsels of
the excellent Bertrand, that had said to her,
" Wait, wait till experience and the
test of
years
shall have confirmed to you
the truth, and unvarying constancy of
Angelo: wait, wait till at the foot of the
altar, unhesitating, and for ever, he shall
make you his, and give himself to you.
Then, and not till then, can he become

eligible as the firm guardian and eternal
protector of his daughter."
Mean time, the deceived and ill-fated
Gabrielle (who was following, from a rare and
refined principle of duty, the man whom
she believed hated and shunned her, who
in more than six long months had never
even written to her a line of condolence,
dictated by some little humanity, or slight
remaining interest in the fate of one he had
once loved), pursued without much danger

with horror, that by the time she reached
England, owing to her little acquaintance

she had scarcely the means of defray-

with
agony, "if I do not immediately
discover Angelo, how shall I be enabled

from inevitable expences, and the chica-

the spoils of the inexperienced stranger,
in state utterly destitute of the
mcans of procuring for her innocent Fe-
lix a morsel of food, to pacify those
wants which every moment she expect-
ed would break forth in impatient de-
mand. On her arm she held a small .
basket, in which she carried some fruit
and a little bread, a fond precaution she
had all along taken for him, which now
she became desirous of reserving as long
as possible, dreading lest ultimately he

should experience, at his tender age,
the
pangs of hunger.
From the animated description which
Angelo had frequently given her of Lon-
don, of the number and variety of its
streets, and of the situation of his own
particular residence there, she felt not so
infinitely appalled at the alarming prospect
before her as otherwise she might have
been, for she flattered herself that she
should soon be enabled to trace him by
inquiry, and then her cares would end.
Hope for a time sustained her; nor was
it till she found every inquiry vain, and
her foreign accent treated with derision
by some, and contempt by others, that
the full horror of her situation stood
with terrifying aspect before her.
It was the depth of winter, rainy and
cold, when she entered London ; it was

growing dusk, night rapidly advanced,
and, a forlorn stranger, she continued to
wander about the streets, an object of vul-
gar curiosity to some, of insult to others,
but of pity to none.
1
At length the idea of attempting to
procure a lodging for the niglit suggested
itself to her mind. Desperately bold at
the horrible prospect of passing the night
in the streets, she made several attempts
at houses where her knowledge of the
English language suflicientiy informed her
that lodging might be procured, but in
vain; she could gain no admittance, for her
apparel, though plain to the last degree,
was foreign, and though singular, too
humble and too uncostly for the well-fed,
purse-proud, and mercenary wretches to
whom she applied to grant her entrance.
She appeared too, a miserable, unfriended,
and desolate being, consequently an ob-

ject of suspicion, and unfit to be shel-
tered by the outrageously good, or coldly
prudent.
Some, after a rude unfeeling examina-
tion, observed, "They never admitted
foreigners;" others objected to the equi-
voque of her unprotected appearance;
while others, still more inhuman, after
hearing the nature of her application,
closed the door instantly, without reply.
Now, galled and agonized, even to an
excess of stupor, for the height of an-
guish precludes acute sensation, she seated
herself, with a calm despair, on the step
of a door, and taking her child in her
arms, laid his little head upon her bosom,
hoping that in slecp he might forget the
calls of hunger.
Her basket, now most dearly che-
rished, she placed beside her, as desirous

of not calling his attention towards it;
but the watchful Felix was not to be thus
eluded; he had fasted several hours, and
unusual fatigue had sharpened his appe-
tite; he cast his eyes upon the well-
known basket, in which Gabrielle, dur-
ing their journey, had constantly carried
fruit, and things to please his childish
taste, and stretching his innocent hands
towards it, plainly informed his mother
that he would have it opened.
How did the heart-wrung Gabrielle
yield to his request? Not with the tender
and natural feclings of delight, with which
she usually supplied his wants, but with
a tearful eye, and a tremulous hand, that
with parsimonious accuracy divided the
slender portion, intended but for cne
intermciliate repast. As with
scious glee the little Felix eagerly de-
voured the scanty allowance, the firmness

of Gabrielle nearly failed her, for she
dreaded that he would ask for more;-
and if so, unless Providence befriended
her, when next he asked he could not
have any thing. Her fears, however,
were happily disappointed; his appetite
for the moment satisfied, or rather allayed,
he had leisure to indulge the softer call
of nature, sleep; and, laying his head
upon the bosom of his mother, he fell
into the profound slumber of innocence.
At this happy result, for happiness is
always comparative, the grateful Ga-
brielle burst into a flood of tears, and
pressed him with rapture in her arms.
Now, at the suggestion of reviving
hope, strengthened by the moment of
pleasure she had experienced, she deter-
mined to make a last attempt to procure
shelter for the night. She arose accord-

ingly, and walking a few paces, stopped
at the first house which denoted lodgings
to the passenger. With trembling hand
she applied to the door, from the humble
appearance of the house auguring that
she might gain admittance; she was de-
ceived, however, for treatment similar
to that she had already met with,
again awaited her. Hopeless she turned
away, and was retiring hastily from the
spot, when a female, of vulgar and un-
prepossessing form, standing at the ad-
joining door, enquired of her, in a voice
though far from soothing, still more
gentle than any she had yet heard, if she
sought a lodging?
" I do," Gabrielle, in a broken voice,
replied.
" But can you pay for one?" asked the
woman,

in her passage, glanced upon the fair
hand of Gabrielle; " you have got a gold

The eyes of Gabrielle gazed upon the
ring to which the woman alluded; it was
of plain gold, of little comparative value,
but given her by Angelo as a marriage
ring. But Angelo was perfidious, and her
child was in danger of remaining unshel-
tered for the nightthe struggle was
momentary, she sighed, drew the ring
from her finger, and said, " Admit me."
The woman took the ring; her door,
invulnerable to intreaty, opened to the
power of gold-opened even wide, and
admitted the houseless stranger. Up a
narrow winding stair-case slowly she
followed her hospitable guide, who from
poverty had taken its last mite, ere she
would yield it sufferance: she was con-
ducted into a small and meanly-furnished
room, where stood a iniserable single
bed.

Gabrielle, thankful to have obtained

for the night, expressed her gratitude to
her hostess, and laid her sleeping Felix
upon the berl. The eyes of the woman,
with vulgar curiosity, not compassionate
interest, were rivetted upon her, and her
tongue involuntarily yielding to the in-
fluence of the former, she sought, by
various questions and inuendos, to induce
Gabrielle in some degree to gratify it.
But Gabrielle was not so disposed, she
desired to place no confidence, nor wished
for yulgar uninterested participation in
griefs like her's. To avoid, therefore, the
necessity of replying, she approached the

With the vulgar, poverty,
panied by superior manners (considered
pride ) is ever sufficient to excite their
dislike, suspicion, and presumption :
there was a native elegance about Ga-
brielle, which contrasted with her humble
appearance, made her an object of remark.
The vulgar can never reconcile an union so
extraordinary, nor ever fail of attaching to
it the idea of some misconduct or de-
pravity: true to the class of beings to which
she appertained, this woman viewed Ga-
brielle with so much illiberal suspicion, that
she resolved to remain awake for the night,
in order to keep a strict watch upon so
doubtful a guest, lest she should perpetrate

some mischief, or in return for her impru-
dent hospitality, for which she now severely
arraigned herself, plunder her, and endea-
vour to escape.
So determining, for the sake of security,
she seated herself in a chair by the fire,
starting every now and then from an un-
easy doze, to assure herself that all as yet
was safe. Thus passed the night ; morn-
ing at length dawned ; the woman roused
herself from the forgetfulness of a few mo-
ments, into which she had irresistibly
fallen, and perceiving that it was light,
conceived that her unwelcome inmate had
had sufficient benefit for the small con-
sideration she had given, and likewise that,
to the letter, she had fulfilled her promise in
permitting her to remain for the night;
night had now certainly elapsed; she
therefore immediately rose, and approach-

brielle, who for several hours having found
it utterly impossible to obtain a moments
oblivion of her cares, had just at this
time fallen into a light slumber ; a rough
shake, intended gently to rouse her, caused
her to start up in affright.
" Come," cried her hostess, with a
constrained smile; "it is now morning,
you see I have been as good as my word,
I have given up my bed to you all night,
and I would advise you to rise at once, and
endeavor to find out some lodging that
may suit you."
Gabrielle arose, indignant but silent,
for she felt the uselessness of expostulation
with such a being, whose very look spoke
the narrowness and insensibility of her
soul :

hospitality, and once more beheld herself
a desolate and unsheltered wanderer.
This day passed as the former had done,
in vain research, and fruitless enquiries
after Angelo ;-towards evening a drizzling
rain came on, and again she was appalled
with the prospect of passing the night in
the streets. Food had not entered her lips
during the day, nor for almost the whole
of the preceding one ; famine and the
most terrible of deaths stared her in the
face:-already she saw herself perishing, ex-
hausted by want, unnoticed and unknown,
in a foreign land;-horrible ideas overcame
her; and, heart-sick, fainting and on the
point of sinking to the earth, she leaned
against the wall of a house for support.

to the craving appetite of her child. He
had wept, demanded, and intreated for
more; alas! the wretched mother had
it not to give. Weakened by exhaustion,
wearied with crying, he had fallen into a
slumber; scarce able to stand herself, she
held him in her arms, and dreaded with
indescribable horror the moment of his
waking, when more loudly and more
impetuously his innocent voice would cry to
her for food, which again she must en-
dure the racking agony of not having to
bestow.
" But at length his cries will cease,"
said she in despair, " and he will be at
peace. -Oh, Angelo - cruel Angelo,
could'st thou but behold us!" The
rain rapidly increasing, she wrapped him
in her cloak; and now, in stern hope-
lessnes, awaited the climax of her fate,

While she stood, her fair arm uncovered
to the inclement wind and rain, support-
ing to her bosom her unconscious child,
a gentleman passing by, struck by her for-
lorn appearance, and the extreme delicacy
of an arm, which though emaciated gave
intimation of something superior to what
that appearance conveyed, stopped for a
moment, and in a gentle voice asked her
if she stood in need of aid.
The accent of the stranger struck to
the heart of Gabrielle with such powerful
effect, that she was incapable of reply.
He appeared to pity her confusion, and
ei attributing it to the probability of her
having been differently situated, he drew
from his pocket a purse, and presenting it
to her, said, " If you require present
assistance, take this ; should you desire
further-here is my addressinform me."
So saying, he passed on ; the purse, which

voice of distress, and one which even
then seemed not unfamiliar to him, An:
gelo turned hastily round, and perceiving
the female he had just spoken with
lying apparently senseless on the ground,
he raised her in his arms, whilst her child,
hurt and awakened by her fall, in a
low mournful cry, expressed its pain
and terror. Always humane, Angelo
conveyed the insensible Gabrielle into a
house, while he dispatched some per-
sons, whom curiosity, rather than com-
passion had drawn around her, for a
carriage.

Now at leisure to satisfy the anxiety he
felt, he approached Gabrielle, whose large

recover her, her face and figure were

her knees, pressed and kissed her cold
hands, and giving way to the effusions of
his despair, swore that if Gabrielle did
not recover, he would die at her feet.
Prostrate he remained on the ground
beside her, and no entreaties could move
him thence.

Mean time the little Felix, whose alarm
having been soothed, was happily disco-
vered to have sustained no injury, came
hastening, fast as his tender limbs would
allow, towards his mother;--soon as Angelo
beheld the boy, his anguish was for a mo-
ment directed into another channel. As
the innocent, in surprise and fear, clung
round the knees of its mother, and looked
with fond enquiry in her pallid face, Angelo
seized him in his arms, and with convulsive
agony pressed him to his breast. Felix
first cried aloud, and struggled to get loose;
but finding he could not, gazed earnestly
upon him, when it seemed even as if faint
recollection glanced across his infant mind,
for he submitted without reluctance to his
caresses.

known voice of her child dimly striking on
her ear, or whether by the unaided

operations of nature, Gabrielle opened her
languid eyes, and beheld before her the two
beings dearest to her in existence. She
endeavoured to raise herself in her chair,
but her power was unequal to the effort,
and again she sank back.
To behold that she lived, that Gabrielle
lived, though it nearly distracted him with
joy, recalled to Angelo his energies ; he
sprang instantly from the earth with hands
clasped, and eyes overflowing with tears of
wild delight; his heart, late oppressed
with despair, now throbbed with almost
agonising bliss; he took but one more kiss
of her pale hand, and then was capable of
hastening the movements for her departure.
Supported by a couple of females, who had
humanely admitted her into their house,
Gabrielle was conveyed to the carriage
which awaited her, and Angelo, trei-

boy in his arms, first making a suitable
compensation to those who had lent their
necessary assistance.
Now, with his recovered Gabrielle, has-
tening to his own residence, he placed his
beloved Felix on his knee, and laid the head
of his still-fainting mother upon his bosom.
Thus they proceeded in a silence uninter-
rupted but by his own eager exclamations,
now of bitter self-reproach, now of ten-
derness towards the injured, long-lost object
of his love, now to his child, who seemed
to have forgotten his hunger in innocent
grief for the situation in which he beheld
his mother.
At the door of a sumptuous habitation
the carriage stopped; Angelo bore into his
house the fragile form of her who alone of
all women he yet continued to love. There,

a chamber, and placed in bed ; and eager
then again to behold her, he entered the
room, which for a few moments he had
quitted, and gazing upon her with stream-
ing eyes, he seated himself in silence
beside the bed, having closed the curtains
that she might repose. When every one
was withdrawn, Gabrielle, with feeble
hand, drew aside the curtain; this move-
ment was sufficient, and Angelo in an in-
stant was on his knees by her side, covering
her hand with kisses, while he deluged it
in tears.

his breast. Gabrielle sought not to assuage
the remorseful anguish of those sensations
that were distracting Angelo; she wished
him to feel the full enormity of his guilt,
and of the miseries it had entailed
upon
them; but the thought of her beloved child
was chief in her heart, and waving her hand
towards him, she faintly cried" Felix-

Angelo recalled, rushed from the room,
and in a few moments returned, accom-
panied by the child, whose long abstinence
from food began to be severely felt by him,
and the fervid glow of his cheek was dis-
placed by a languid paleness.
Quick as thought a table was covered -
with various refreshments, and Angelo,
who knew that by attending first to the
wants of her child, he acted most con-
formably to the wishes of Gabrielle, placed
before him such things as he conceived
most appropriate to his tender appetite ;
and while eagerly and anxiously he was
in:ent upon satisfying it, he prevailed ,
upon the enfeebled Gabrielle to take a
little wine, which with treinbling hand,
and cheek crimsoned by compunctious
reflection he held to her lips. By deg.ces,

guished entreaty pressed her to accept,
she felt enabled to sustain a little con-
versation ; and still more capable did she
feel of compassing the effort, when in the
explanation of Angelo, even in the midst
of his self-reproaches, she discovered how
comparatively short a period to what she
had imagined, he had remained in his un-
happy delusion.
Rejoiced at this soothing conviction,
her long oppressed heart beat with in-
creased emotion; her weakened spirits
rose to the degree of pleasure, and she
conld bear to listen to, and even touch
upon the terrible events that had inter-
vened since their separation. Oriana, the
fiend Oriana, was' mutually and justly
recognised' as the author of the delusions
of the one, and consequent misfortunes of
the other; and though no decided proof of

long line of incident, and combining
circumstances apparently trifling at the .
time, no doubt remained in the minds of
either; further too was the idea con-
firmed by the treatment which Gabrielle
described herself to have experienced from
the Genoese, when a distracted wretcha
she had flown to her, as her last hope of ac-
quiring some information of him who
had abandoned her, and by the sudden
change of conduct and manners in the
worthless Paulina.
Thus then, mutual and perfect explana-
tion ensued; Angelo had written re-
peatedly to Gabrielle, and received no
answer; and these dear letters, a single
sentence of which would have breathed new
life into her soul, she had never even beheld.
"Oh, Angelo, Angelo !" cried Gabrielle, in
a voice that for the first moment conveyed
aught like reproach, "why, why, were ever.

Gabrielle shed a tear upon the burning
cheek of the repentant Angelo.She
gently pressed his hand, which wildly held
her's, and in that moment, so dear to both,
the happiness of him who was forgiven,
was equalled only by the happiness of her
who forgave.
Gabrielle forgot, or at least forgave the
errors of the past, and once more the sun-
beams of hope pierced through the gloomy
shadows of despair. But far, far inore for
her children than for herself, did Gabri-

lover, and found him still unchanged. She
could not disguise from her proud and
superior mind, (and with a pang at her
heart she admitted it) that Angelo had
sadly wandered from his allegiance to
her; "and too surely," thought she,
" when the imagination is suborned, the
heart, for a time, wanders with it, and
partakes of its illusionthe senses can-
not stray entirely alone." These painful
ideas she would endeavour to check and
to repress, least pride, gaining the ascen-
dancy over duty, should lead her in selfish
disgust or re-entment at the bitter con-
viction, to leave unfinished the glorious
and noble resolution she had so far pur-
sued. To quit in angry, inortified self-

society from being injured by her errors,

longer the wandering creature of temp-

he was sobered into the domestic husband,

No longer now the ephemeral, but pas-
sionate admirer of every novel face,no
longer to be attracted by the blandish-
ments of the meretricious part of the sex,
or artifices of the wary prude, Gabrielle
began to behold in him the being she had

save one--the eternal misery, the eternal
remorse of her first error, and its dread
consequences, in having precipitated to
his grave her high-soul'd, honorable
father!

the joyous certainty of protection for her
children, protection from him who best
was entitled to grant it-to whom they
owed that they were called into exis-
tence.
The only shadow of error in the present
conduct of Angelo was his continued love
of play, but that, so long as he preserved
himself from embarrassment, Gabrielle
was disposed to deem as an amusement,
rather than a destructive habit, which, if
pursued, alnost invariably involves in ruin.
Short-sighted mortals that we are, this
very propensity, viewed by Gabrielle in a
light so comparatively trivial, was of itself
sufficient to blast, in a single instant, those
fairy fabrics of future happiness for her
children, on which her mind delighted to
dwell.
Five years elapsed, and found Angelo

still unchanged; at the termination of this
period, he remained what at its com-
mencement he had become. His dis-
position, and the fine qualities of his heart,
which had seemed but in their germ, ap-
peared mellowed only by the fostering
hand of time; that which in sincere love
and penitence he had commenced, had
grown insensibly into a conduct of system,
and become dearest and most congenial to
his heart. Such is the influence and
power of virtue, that when once its dic-
tates are in sincerity adopted, it becomes
agreeable to the heart of man, as it is best
for the sanity of his soul, and for his tem-
poral happiness.

and beauty; but while the doting eyes of the
father could discern in him no fault, the
ap-
prehensive eyes of the mother scrutinized
more deeply; she beheld him lovely and
engaging, but beheld with uneasiness an.
uncontrollable impetuousness of manner,
a boldness and presumption, with, most ma-
terial fault of all, a tendency to deviate from:
the truth in the occasional relation of
events in which he might be concerned.
But when Gabrielle expressed sometimes
her anxious sentiments upon this head, the
partial father laughed, and would tell her
that she refined too much, that she must
not look for excellence like her own, even
in her children; or otherwise, with more of
exultation than regret, attribute all to early
indications of spirit and superior genius.

cherished but long unseen daughter, Ga-
brielle, who had till this period temporised
with, and yielded reluctantly to the tender
intreaties of her excellent friend Madame
Bertrand, still to retain her, became now
absolutely impatient, and resolved seriously
to demand her, and in such a way that
should not have it in her power to evade her
further.
It was almost a year since Gabrielle had
last heard from her, in answer to a request
that she would only quit Switzerland for a
few months, and be herself the guardian of
her adopted child to her parents. In her
letter then, Madame Bertrand had informed
her, that softened at length by the long
attachment and persevering solicitations of
M. Boffuet, she had at last consented to
become his wife, and stated the event to have
taken place a few weeks previous to her
writing. " Ah, dearest Gabrielle," observed

this excellent friend, "it is no longer then
purely for the sake of societyor for the
tender love I bear to Agnes, that I desire
to retain her, but from higher considera-
tions.-Alas! forgive me, if even yet my
mind is not satisfied to resign her to you!
*Tis true, indeed, the constancy and attach-
ment of D'Albini hath now undergone
very considerable test, and hath remained
unshaken; he is happy with you, and feels
a pride in acknowledging by his conduct
that he is so.Why, then-(for am I
not your friend, and may speak freely),
why then hesitate to confirm to himself,
far as by earthly ties it could be confirmed,
the happiness he now enjoys ?
Why is it, that still wavering, procrasti-
nating, irresolute, he prefers to linger through
life with you, in a feverish, unsatisfactory
union, valuing, esteeming, and loving you
as a wife in all the dearest attributes of one,

ignominy, then no longer shall I hesitate to
resign to hiin a daughter."
So, in the very last epistle received from
her, wrote the just and rational Bertrand.
Gabrielle in her heart allowed, and there-
fore was too honest to deny, that she felt
the severe, incontrovertible truth of her
observations, but still her confidence in
Angelo was such, that no doubt could
for a moment harbour there. She wished to
believe, that delicacy, joined to a conviction
of its being completely unnecessary as a
stronger tie, prevented him now from pro-
posing to her the form of marriage. " An-
gelo is so sincere a convert," said she men-
tally, " that there is no danger of his re-
lapsing into error, however unshackled he
may be. So well do I know that noble
nature, that sure am I, if he suspected
within himself the possibility of ever wan-
dering, he would instantly unite him-

self to me by the strongest of all possible
bonds, in order to operate as a check upon
his conduct."
But Gabrielle erred in this instance, from
want of proper discrimination, and erred
likewise in thinking the best of the man
she loved. She erred in the first instance,
because neither her education, her know-
ledge of, or commerce with the world,
placed before her mind, in a point of view
sufficiently strong, the absolute necessity
of marriage between those persons who
form an intercourse of sincere attachment,
who desire to live for each other, and who,
in consequence of such intercourse produce
to the world human beings, who will call
them parents, and to whom therefore they
owe it to involve them as little as possible
in the consequences of their mutual error,
by sooner or later endeavouring to give
them that consideration in the world, to

237
which, from the mode of their birth, they
would not be immediately entitled.
She erred too, in her conception of
Angelo; for he in effect feared marriage,
more than he loved Gabrielle, or consi-
dered his children's estimation in society.
Never had he even named marriage to her ;
he would not either allow himself to revert
to it even distantly, or in perspective, in
her presence or in solitude. From the
libertine pursuits of his early youth he
had conceived a prejudice against it--from
his. subsequent knowledge of the worst
part of the sex, judging from them of the
whole, a disgust, and ultimately a dread.
!
It is one characteristic of the libertine,
that he detests marriage, for it is the im-
mutable consequence attendant on the
long pursuit of vicious and ignoble
pleasures, which unhinge the mind, and

unfit the soul for 'the calm delights of
virtue.. Thus, though the excellent con-
duct, superior mind, and personal attrac-
tions of Gabrielle, rivetted to her in un-
wearied fondness the heart of Angelo, yet
had he once ventured to have set the seal
of eternal union upon: that fondness, he
would haye felt himself no longer an in-
dependent being; and the idea of a formal
duty would have pressed so heavily upon
his mind, as to render irksome and dis-
pleasing, that very conduct, which,
pursued from inclination alone, wore
varied and unfading charms.
But Gabrielle judged not thus, her
opinion was regulated by her love, and by
her wishes : pursuant to her determination
- she wrote to Madame Bertrand, and insisted
that it was now absolutely necessary that
Angelo should behold his daughter, that no
more time should be permitted to elapse

ere she took strong hold of his affections,
which could be only done by appearing
before him, and remaining constantly
under his own eyes.
" I have two children," added Gabrielle ;
66 the one that is not with me is no
less dear to my heart than the one that is
continually in my sight; but with Angelo
it may be otherwise, for he has never
even seen his daughter, while I, though
I should never behold her more, bear her
sweet infant features in my mind,---re-
member, as though it were but yesterday,
those bitter hours when you held her in
your arms, when I gazed on her indeed,
but did not see her; and remember too,
what, never while life endures I can
forget, the scene of horror and despair in
which I gave her birth, and which is im-
pressed upon my heart in characters that
are indelible.

propriety, must no longer sway me, as
they are answered in my mind by con-
siderations which outbalance them."
To this letter Gabrielle expected a
prompt and acquiescent reply, while
Angelo, with his natural impetuosity, fixed
his ardent hopes upon the prospect of
speedily embracing a daughter, whom he

longed to behold. Several weeks elapsed
however, and no answer arrived; Ga-
brielle allayed her impatience, in the fond
hope that Madame Bertrand was pre-
pairing for her a delightful surprise, and
that she would suddenly appear before
them with the anxiously-expected Agnes.
But when at length such a time elapsed,
as to render the indulgence of this hope
no longer rational, Gabrielle, half indig-
nant at a conduct which when assuining to
itself the right of dictating to ber best and
dearest feelings, and of combating those
intentions which she felt the importance of
fulfilling, appeared rather an abuse, than a
prerogative of friendship, prepared to ad
dress her again, but in style more decisive
a letter suddenly arrived, which at once
ended their hopes by plunging them in
despair-it was as follows:

" To be brief, scarce had the laws of
marriage rendered his my slender pro-
perty, than the man changed, and changed
not gradually, but at once. Soon was I
deprived of my few accustomed comforts,
debarred even of necessaries, and by the
line of conduct which the selfish and
hypocritical Boffuet assumed immediately
that he obtained a right to dictate to mine,
it appeared as though he was desirous of
hastening me to the grave, that he might
have uncontrolled possession of all, but

she to expect in reality, but useless re-
gret and bitter repentance?
" To proceed however ; I could have
borne perhaps with patience the infainy of
his conduct, though unlooked for towards
myself alone, but that which struck me
to the heart, which destroyed me nearly,
was the gloomy and illiberal eye with
which he regarded my idolized Agnes.
His contracted soul, ever thirsting for gold,
desired to appropriate wholly to himself
that snm which you forced on me in his
presence, at your departure, and which, in
an unguarded moment, I had acknowledged
to have preserved still untouched for our
Agwes.
" At the same time that he desired to
appropriate to binnself this little sum, which
foudly I had anticipated at my death to
double and treble, by the whole of what I

possessed, he still could not endure that
the innocent child should remain beneath
the roof. Every little indulgence, each
little dainty that my fond love had pro ,
cured for her, drew from his heart so
many drops of blood; but perceiving that
his base and grovelling insinuations pro-
duced no effect upon me, he quickly
abridged, and soon entirely deprived me of
the means of continuing a conduct which had
ever constituted iny chief delight. Each day
he became a meaner and more vulgar
tyrant; each day he loudly arraigned me
for my folly and obstinacy, in persisting to
burthen him with the support of a child
whose parents were willing and anxious to
receive her.

untarily makes me, that under such circum-

stances when last I wrote, I should still
have refused to deliver up your child-but
oh, spare, I implore you spare me! I now
see, alas, that I carried my zeal for the
future welfare of that child to an
pardonable length, that it would have been
more prudent, and more just, to have
yielded to your requests, but unhappily I
conceived that you were more enthusiastic
than refiective ; Jed away more by your
desire to behold your child, than by your
conviction of the propriety of withdrawing
her from me--and that it was better our Ag-
nes should suffer some slight discomforts in
her childhood, than become perhaps the
victim of neglect and misfortune at maturer
years. But ah! let me speak the whole truth,
and acknowledge what conscience at this
moment whispers--it is, that the more
miserable I became, the more I needed the
cheering and beloved society of the only
eing near, who felt an interest for me.

At length the conduct of Boffuet
grew so
intolerable as to render existence almost a
curse to me. He assumed an absolute
right not only over all I possessed, but the
right to direct my slightest movements and
actions. His cheerless
penury
became such
as to chill me to the heart; his savage pard
simony exceeded conception; and on the
innocent Agnes he looked daily with
deepened gloom and malignity; the bez
loved girl dreaded to approach him, tears
were almost always in her lovely eyes; my
heart wied within me to behold her youth-
ful sorrows, yet to have expostulated with a
being obdurate and insensible as Boffuet,
would, I felt, only aggravate our mutual
unhappiness.
One day, ah,let me hasten to conclude,

cottage in order to breathe at liberty, for

Buffuet. I left our Agnes playing in the
garden, while the savage Botfuet, was as I
conceived, immured in his room, hatching
fresh plans to torture and distress. Finding
herself alone, and as she believed unob-
served, the innocent child, from whoin
every
little indulgence was restricted, busily began
to gather some grapes, to satisfy with glee
her childish appetite. Instantly Boliuet,
who from a window in his chainber could
perceive all that passed in the garden, de-
scended furiously, and seizing Agnes by the
arm-inflicted on her-can I, dare I speak
it to a tender mother, when even my own
heart rises at the thought, the brutal chas-
tisement of several blows! This done, he
quitted the garden to procure, as he said,
a whip, which hung in his chamber, still
further to inflict on her such punishment
as should make her remember the crimi-
nality of theft.

" Abominable, base, and pretended con-
struction; theft in her own mansion in
the mansion of her infancy, where all it con-
tained had by me been long and fondly re-
cognised as her's; it was the loss of the
grapes, and not the theft which the gro-
velling and malignant soul of Boffuet led
him to revenge.
"Whether, however, it was the terror in-
spired by the anticipation of cruel chastise-
ment, or the resentment inspired by that
already received, for Agnes had been nou-
rished in the bosom of tenderest indul-
gence, and was ever unused to the voice of
reproof even, till the infamous Boffuet
made it familiar to her ear, I know not ;
but when he returned into the garden, he
could no where perceive the object of his
savage and intemperate wrath ; vexed to the
soul, and boiling with disappointed rage,
he sought the cottage throughout, swearing

that when she appeared, he would make
her repent of her temerity in attempting to
escape him.
He returned then to his chamber, az a
tyger disappointed of prey would return to
its den. Hour after hour elapsed, and
Agnes did not appear; her escape, which
when I learnt I had first been tempted to
rejoice in, I now began to view with sensa-
tions of the deepest alarm; towards night,
when she did not return, my anxiety knew
no bounds, I ran about distracted from cot-
tage to cottage, I called her among the
mountains, I shrieked forth her name in
the valleys; I bent over the edge of the
steep, and looked for her mangled form
down the dizzying abyss; I heard not her
voice, I saw her not, I beheld no traces of
her.

all terror of the tyrant Boffuet in the agony
which rent my heart, I flew to his chamber,
and upbraided him in the bitterest language
my feelings could suggest, of having driven
my child, the rightful owner of the
cottage in which he lived, of having driven
her from her home, which but for him she
never would have quitted. Savage with fury,
and impatient at reproaches to which he
was unaccustomed, he started up, and swore
that if I did not instantly retire, he would
thrust me out of the house, which I should
never enter more, adding that although I
presumed to consider it as mine, it was so
no longer, but lawfully appertained to him,
and that no one should remain in it that
was not agreeable to him.
Mad with indignation and contending
feelings, I rushed from his presence, and
sought again, in the dead of the night, the

parting with

fastened round
her neck, and which contained in it do-
cuments, (as you justly considered them)

enquired of me concerning it; I told him
it was lost, and after that, conceiving that
the best mode of preserving it would be
to place it in the bosom of our daughter,
for no depository of mine was respected by
him, I did so, and easily managed to con-

Boffuet, and trembled if his savage eyes

the vain hope, at every break and each suc-
ceeding line, to discover a ray of hope to
save her from absolute despair.But no,
her loved Agnes, the hoarded treasure,
which, like a miser, she considered that she
possessed, although she did not enjoy,
which so long she had fondly anticipated
to claim, was gone, was vanished! a
moment had blighted her best hopes, had
rendered vain to the object for whom she
had risqued so much, the firm perseverance
with which she had endured distress, dan-
ger, grief, and mortification; had ren-
dered vain too the reward with which her
courage and sufferings had been crowned,
in securing the protection she had sought,
the protection of a father for her cherished
child !The reflection was too much, and
her acute agony burst forth in loud
cries, which summoned Angelo, in trem-
bling anticipation of ill, to her apart-
ment.

Gabrielle could only hold out to him the
fatal letter; she could not speak: Angelo
glanced hastily over its he read the relation
of that terrible disaster which caused her
distraction, and forgetting his own grief
in the wilder agony of her's, he made
every attempt to soothe and to console
her; the idea which pressed heaviest on the
mird of Gabrielle, vented itself in the re-
peated exclamation of, "Oh! if still she
lives, what will be her fate, wandering
about the world, unprotected, unclaimed ?""
Angelo had never seen his child, con-
sequently his affliction was less severe than
that of her mother, which for some time
appeared insensible to every representation
that could be made. He resolved, however,
as the only step now to be pursued, to set
on foot every possible enquiry, not in Eng-
land indeed, for there they must have
been fruitless, but in Switzerland, on its

at these places, intreating them to diffuse
enquiry, and make it as general as they
possessed the power of doing, but with
the exception of concealing such circum-

unnecessary to divulge in the pursuit.
This then was immediately entered
upon, and followed up with a spirit and
an interest, such as shewed the high de-
gree of estimation in which Angelo was
held by all who had an opportunity of
knowing him. This active perseverance
too tended in a degree to divert the bitter
anguish of Gabrielle, by mingling it with
the fever of hope, while its suspense

into absolute despair.
All however proved vain ; at the end of
several months they found themselves at
the precise point from which they had sat
out, in total and complete ignorance of
the fate of their child. Nothing now was
left for the parents but the most hopeless
and melancholy conjecture, and no alter-
native but that of trusting to time for
some developement of this most mys-
terious and lamentable occurrence.

Time crept on, and all hope of disco-
vering their child faded gradually and
sorrowfully from the minds of the
parents. Felix had attained his tenth
year, and on him alone rested now their
fond expectations. But the mind of the
mother would often revert with a sigh of
bitter regret to the probable fate of her
beloved Agnes, who would now have
been for her so sweet a companion, and
filled up with delight many moments
that were necessarily devoted to solitude;
for Felix was more the companion of his

father than her, and though a lovely
and engaging youth, he needed that ur-
banity, softness, and docility of manner
which fondly she imagined in the gentle
creature she had lost. The idol of his
father, it was not unfrequently that she
beheld insufficient her mild and rational
controul to restrain the impetuosity of
his manners, the wildness, and often
serious impropriety of his conduct. But
Angelo, who contended that all this was
but the ardour and spirit of youth, and
that it would yield to the soberer influ-
ence of judgment and increase of years, ,
loved not that she should check the boy;
for in the fulness of a proud self-love he
would remember, that his son resembled
what he himself had been at his age.
Thus by the mismanagement, and of-
tentimes imprudent interference of An-
gelo in his presence, many errors were

suffered to take deep and fatal root in
the heart of Felix, which the anxious
vigilance and salutary reproofs of his
mother might have timely extirpated,
but would at all events have rendered of
little influence in his future general cha-
racter. Still she entertained hopes that
unremitting perseverance on her side,
and the ultimate prevalence of increasing
reason over early folly, on his, would
correct the imperfections of his present
disposition, and render him all that her
anxious love desired to behold him as a
man.
The hopes of Gabrielle were however
doomed to be frustrated, for the conduct
of Felix, his inattention to her counsels,
and disobedience of her commands, ori-
ginated in a source deeper far than any
of which she was aware ; for while she
considered as the wandering of the head

merely, the errors of her child, they
sprang from a heart corrupted and con-
taminated by the baneful influence of
surrounding circumstance.
In the domestic establishment of An-
gelo, was a female named Milborough;
she had been originally hired to attend
exclusively upon the infant Felix, and to
keep a guard over him, excepting when
under the eyes of his parents. As Felix
grew older however, and required no
longer the vigilant care of a nurse, Ga-
brielle conceiving a regard for the wo-
man on account of the attention she con-
sidered her to have bestowed
upon
her
charge, retained her still in the family to
officiate as a personal attendant upon
herself. Nothing could be more gentle,
modest, and unassuming than the gene-
ral conduct of Milborough, nothing
more treacherous, base, and diabolical

than her heart: nothing could equal
the propriety of her deportment but the
depravity of her principles; nor any thing
the conciliating anxiety she evinced to
obey the smallest of Gabrielle's desires,
but the secrets malign, and unprovoked
hatred which she bore her.

Possessed of a profligate intriguing spi-
rit, she veiled it with the profoundest art,
and under the guise of an inoffensive pla-
cidity, concealed a mercenary and deceit-
ful soul; all she said, and all she did,
bore the stamp of candour and disin-
terestedness; her countenance was never
ruffled by impatience at reproof, she
heard all with submission, but felt with
rancour, and revenged with bitterness.

not strictly conformable to propriety and
virtue, this woman had discovered that
marriage was not the tie which bound in
a union apparently so indissoluble those
persons who gave her bread; and far
from closing her eyes and ears, as duty
dictated to a menial like herself, against
a secret thus betrayed, she spared no
opportunity of endeavouring to confirm,
by prying curiosity, and unobserved re-
mark, the truth of what at first had been
but vaguely made known to her. She
soon gained, or conceived that she did,
proof sufficient to convince her. From
that moment, those bad principles with
which her soul was imbued were called
into action ; she no longer bore towards
Gabrielle the smallest respect, viewing
her no more in the light of a superior,
though she still appeared to do so; for
it is an invariable maxim with vulgar
minds, when they discover aught amiss

in those above them, immediately to
place themselves upon a level with them,
to consider all inequality at an end, and
establish their own claims to distinction,
merely upon a comparative view with
their errors.
Thus was it with Milbo-
rough, who not taking into her narrow
conception the superior birth, merits,
or high qualities of Gabrielle, saw sim-
ply an unjust difference in their present
stations, and imagined when she beheld
her unpolished figure in the glass, that
her title to rank and opulence was in no
way inferior to that of her mistress.
This ignorant and presumptuous idea
laid the foundation of a train of evils at
once mighty and incalculable.
The commands of Gabrielle, now that
she beheld her in a light so humiliated,
no more enforced obedience from her as
a duty; consequently she obeyed reluc-

tantly, for they galled and offended her;
and she made herself amends for her
condescension by every means in her
power. Being from her situation
(which her interest would not permit
her to resign) so placed as to be neces-
sarily subordinate to Gabrielle, she from
first thinking herself degraded by obey,
ing her, ultimately hated her who com-
manded; yet this low born upstart
presumed to consider Gabrielle a mark
for envy, therefore for hatred ; and in
proportion as her high and superior
virtues manifested themselves, support-
ed by a steady dignity, the result of
conscious nobility of mind, as well as
birth, the hatred of this reptile in-
creased with every foul aggravation
which low minded malice could con-
ceive, venting itself in secret, unsus-
pected, but dreadful mischief,

Though at the period of her entering
the service of Angelo, Felix tenderly
loved his mother, yet Milborough, from
being constantly with him, acquired a
sort of second love in his heart, whicle
soon usurped the place of the first,--an
undue and irrational influence on his
mind likewise, such as vulgar cunning
suggests, may be easiest obtained over
youth and inexperience. It was by
yielding ever to his follies and caprices,
acquiescing with a smile in his wild-
est sallies; by indiscriminate indul-
gence, improper temptations to disobey
the anxious or rational injunctions of
his mother; flattery, inducing him to
commit faults for the purpose of raising
her consequence in his eyes by conceal-
ing them, and gaining his confidence
and affection through the channel of a
perverted gratitude.

had committed one day a slight error for
'which Gabrielle considered it necessary
to reprove him, but did it in the mild-

into tears, and sought his flattering nurse,

his distress. Felix, certain of being pir

looking at her indignantly,---" my mo-

and, instinctively as it were, he withdrew
her arm from round his neck.
Why, Felix, you are too young to
understand indeed, so let us say no more
about it."
But the curiosity of youth is not so
easily appeased; this the artful Milbo-
rough reckoned on, and when a few mi-
nutes after Felix required an explana-
tion of what she had meant by saying
his mother was "nobody," her eyes
sparkled with the exultation of malice,
and her base heart rejoiced at the
thought of the revenge she was taking
upon the excellence, and imagined hap-
piness of Gabrielle, which she died to
frustrate.

"Oh, but my mother says I must never
have any secrets from her," answered
Felix.

"Pho,nonsense," returned Milborough,
putting her arm round him again, which
action, his curiosity now on the stretch,
he did not again repulse.--" Now
listen."
The little Felix opened his ears to
drink in the base pernicious communi-
cations of the abandoned Milborough ;
and she availing herself of the deep at-
tention with which he listened, made as
clear as she possibly could to his childish
capacity, that there was a certain cere-
mony called marriage, which if not duly

and regularly performed between two
persons deciding to live together, the
female lost all consequence in society,
and was regarded as an unfit companion
for other females, honourably married ;
hat the children, likewise, were never
considered by the world as entitled to
any distinction, but on the contrary; and
that therefore they were not obliged to
honour or obey a mother whom no one
honoured or esteemed, and who had so
little considered in her conduct their fu-
ture welfare or estimation in society.
"Thus, Felix, you perceive I was right,"
she concluded, "in saying that your mother
was nobody."
Felix was silent, his mind was confused,
he felt something like painful conviction,
and this conversation made a deep im-
pression. Above all, he remembered a
sensation of uneasiness which he had ex-

perienced at that part of Milborough's
discourse wherein she had made an obser-
vation respecting the opinion which the
world entertained of children situated as
he now understood himself to be.
A frequent recurrence to that most
infamous insinuation produced a baleful
effect
upon
his character: he endeavour-
ed, child as he was, to divest himself of
all pride, conceiving from what Milbo-
rough had said, he had no right to pos-
sess any, and in so doing unfortunately
divested himself of that pride which is
the foundation of every virtue, the pride
of principle. As he grew older, the de
,
structive effect of this idea produced
daily more lamentable consequences.
He lost all self respect, all solicitude for
properconduct; he said to himself, How,
ever good, honourable, or virtuous I may
be, 'no one will look at me, or think me

worthy notice." Thus is it but too true,
that however injurious may be an excess
of pride, to be wholly devoid of it is to be
devoid of every virtue ; for when we
despise ourselves, we are indifferent to
the approbation of others, to the noble
distinction of superior worth, and all that
gives consideration to the man.
Unhappily for Gabrielle, she knew
not the corruption that had been engen-
dered in the heart of her son ; she knew
not the dreadful sentiments that there
had taken root, or her anxious counsels,
her just and animated representation of
that wherein true virtue and dignity
consist, depending solely on the mind,
and on the heart, towering singly and un-
aided, neither to be raised or depreciated
by surrounding circumstances, but mak-
ing in itself the nobility of the indivi-
dual; had she but been aware, she might

have destroyed the evil in its germ,
and
applied the remedy ere it had proved in
vain.
Her who had been the nurse of his
childhood, as Felix advanced to maturer
years became the friend, the adviser of
his youth, the faithful depositary, and
often partaker of his secret follies and
intentions; he now understood perfect-
ly, from the frequent questions he had
proposed to Milborough, and which she
ever answered with unwearied readiness;
from combining in his naturally intelli-
gent mind such ideas as presented
themselves, from observation, or an in-
quisitiveness of spirit, all which at first
he had found it difficult to comprehend.
From the joint operation of these cir-
cumstances his respect for his mother
gradually decreased; with it decreased
his love likewise, and involved with the

dereliction the finer and better qualities
of his soul; for filial love and respect
cannot causelessly quit the young mind
without depriving it of some of its best
and brightest virtues.
The abandoned Milborough rejoiced
in the train of mischief she was secretly
laying, which in time she hoped to see
explode, causing dreadful and unspeak-
able havoc. The boyish partiality of
Felix for her increased rather than dimi-
nished with his yearsshe was so gentle,
so yielding, so ever ready to acquiesce in
all his wishes however difficult to be at-
chieved; she appeared too so happy when
she could compass for him any point he
desired, so delighted to favour or oblige
him. Being frequently the companion
of his father, he would sometimes in the
plenitude of youthful exhiliration speak
of her in terms of highest praise. An-

gelo would listen with a smile; he was
not surprised at the fondness of a young
boy for the woman who had been a kind
nurse to him in his childhood, but he was
wholly incompetent to judge of the merits
of Milborough ; she did not come within
his sphere,and he had scarcelyever bestow.
ed on her a moment's attention. Induced at
length by the reiterated observations of
the youth in her favour, he one morning,
when she entered the room where he was
sitting with Gabrielle, raised mechani-
cally his eyes to her face.--He beheld
there an expression of modesty and in-
genuousness which pleased him, and suf-
ficient attraction to obviate the charge
of ugliness, an attraction which, though
devoid of youth or beauty, boasted a
sort of charm independent of either.
Felix, who had remarked with plea-
sure that his father had noticed Milbe-

rough, seized the first opportunity of
their being alone to ask him if he did
not think Milborough handsome.
" Not particularly so," was the reply
of Angelo; " but since she has deported
herself so well towards you, tell her from
me, that whenever she chuses to marry,
I will give her a sufficient portion to en-
sure the good-will of her husband."
Felix, delighted at the idea of having
so pleasing a communication to make to
Milborough, and hoping that it would
infinitely raise his consequence with her,
hastened when he left his father to iin-
part it to her. Scarce had Milborough
heard him to an end, ere an idea flash-
ed across her mind which tinged her
cheek with the fire of exultation; she
beheld in the munificent promise of An-
gelo, not merely what it proposed, but

far more that it implied; disguising her
joy however, she with an apparent mo-
desty and humility entreated Felix to
return her most grateful thanks to her
lord, but with an air of embarrassment
added, that she had no intention of ever
marrying
That night, sleep was a stranger to
the eyes of Milborough ; visions of as-
piring hope floated before her ; extra-
vagant presumptuous calculations filled
her brain, and she wondered at her dul-
ness in having so long failed to see the
road which lay most open for her to opu-
lence and grandeur, but above all, to
compass that destruction in which un-
ceasingly she had longed to involve her
envied hated mistress. The casual no-
tice of Angelo, and the intimation sent
her by him through Felix, formed the
basis of her present golden dreams.

Since he had deigned to listen to her
praises, and so far acquiesced in their
justice as to send her a special embassy
proving his disposition in her favour,
what might she not in reason expect ?
Well she knew she could not appreciate
too highly the estimation in which she
was held by Felix. He possessed an
unlimited influence over his father,' it
was only therefore to render him volun-
tarily or involuntarily, no matter which,
the medium of introducing her more
fully to the observation of Angelo, and
her most sanguine anticipations might
be easily fulfilled.
Pursuant to this idea, she redoubled
her attention towards the son, and threw
herself, as much as her department in the
family would allow, without suspicion,
in the way of the father; she endeavour-
ed by every artifice compleatly to estrange

at first directly refused, but yielding to
the entreaty of his son, he at length con-
sented, and promised, laughing, that he
would accompany him to the room ad-
joining hers for that purpose, at the time
mutually agreed on. When the hour
arrived, Angelo had forgotten his pro-
mise, but at the vexed remonstrance of
theimpetuous youth, he yielded acquies-
cence, and followed him to the appoint-
ied spot. A small glass window fixed in
the door which separated the two rooms,
was usually covered with a curtain, but

was artfully laid, had drawn. this cur-

sufficiently, while it appeared the work
of accident, to give an insight into the

her and Felix, she should be informed of
their entrance, and know when to begin
her song. No sooner had she received from
the unthinking boy the necessary hint,
than she commenced by carelessly hum-
ming an air, not without taste, which at
intervals she interrupted, as more intent
upon heremployment, which wasembroid-

ally she entered on the song of the air she
had been humming. The subject was
simply interesting and artfully chosen.
It related to the concealed love of a maid
in lowly station for a lord of high rank,
and it painted her secret anguish in
mournful expression, and melancholy
tone, to which she managed to give pe-
culiar effect, and concluded with the
death of the maid from her hopeless pas-
sion, in consequence of the marriage of her
lover with another.

While she sang, so apparently uncon-
scious that any human being was nigh,
Angelo, whose expectations she had com-
pletely surpassed, for he had attributed
the praises of Felix merely to his want
of taste in the science, found himself first
involuntarily drawn towards the artfully
contrived aperture, better to catch the
notes of her voice, and next rivetted there,
by the well arranged figure and pleas-
ing countenance which displayed itself
to his view. He continued gazing near
a minute after the song was ended, and
was only roused from his intentness by
the gentle voice of Felix, who pulling
him by the arm, in the spirit of boyish
mischief whispered, "Let us break sud-
denly in upon Milborough, my lord,
and tell her we have heard her song,
she will look so frightened and confus-
ed!"

" No, no, Felix," replied Angelo,

father forward, half reluctant, half care-

suddenly before her, Felix laughing im-
moderately at her confusion and alarm,
so well affected as to deceive even him-
self. But since Angelo had for the first
time entered her apartment, she was de-
sirous to avail herself of the auspicious
moment. On their sudden entrance the
frame had fallen from her hand, she
started up, and appeared in the greatest
perturbation; now she trembled violently,
seeming unable to sustain herself, attempt-
ed to catch at a chair for support, and
failing, staggered and fell to the ground,

Angelo, somewhat flushed with wine,
had given inconsiderately into the frolic
of his son; but now seriously sorry for the
terror he had occasioned a weak and
timid female, he instinctively attempted to
raise her from the ground, in which Felix,
no longergay and laughing, mostearnestly
assisted. At length Milborough appeared
to recover, she wasraised from the ground,
but seeming suddenly to perceive that it
was the hand of Angelo which held
hers, to assist her, she swiftly withdrew
it with a slightexclamation of alarm, and,
glanced on him a look, in which love strug-
gling with apprehension, and pleasure
with trembling timidity, were artfullycon-
trasted. Angelo observed the expressive:

natural character remained unchanged,
at least in principle ; ever open in a de-
gree to the blandishments of women, he

his vanity was still susceptible of being
flattered by their admiration, as his heart
to be influenced by their charms.
Thus Milborough, whose look had pe-
netrated immediately to his self-love, be-
gan to wear additional attractions in his
eyes; he now fancied there was meaning
in the expression of her song, and while
vanity faintly whispered that she dared
to entertain an affection for him, self,
love extenuated her presumption, and
bade him pity, rather than despise her.,
Honour and propriety would have dic-
tated to Angelo at this imagined disco-
very, an unvarying countenance, ex-
cepting of increased coolness, and a
speedy departure from her chamber,
which if not expressive of his disgust,
must have convinced her at least of the
total impossibility of his supposing that

such a look directed to him, could con-
tain the slightest meaning. But no, true
to the latent principles of his nature, of a
character that wanted energy, firmness,
and decision, that was ever acted on by
the influence of circumstance, or the mo-
ment, and was devoid of the dignified
fortitude which can resist adventitious
temptation, he suffered more softness to
be visible in his looks, more interest in
the tone of his voice, more tenderness in
the assistance he gave; but all this was
urged by pity, and by the delicacy which
a woman coninands from a man, who dis-
covers that she unhappily cherishes an
imprudent passion for him. Instead of
hastening from her room, as soon as possi-
ble, his stay was prolonged; nor did he
quit her till he beheld bier perfectly

pressed in the gentlest accents, that by
the following day she would suffer no ill

Milborough seeming overpowered with
confusion, scarcely lifted her eyes from
the ground; and when Angelo rose for
the purpose of departing, she arose like-
wise, for he had compelled her to sit in
his
presence, and seemed incapable, from .
a sense of the honour conferred .apon
her, of returning her faltering acknow-
ledgments for such condescension.

ho would not have believed, after so
long a period of constancy and perseve-

of Angelo were for ever at an end ? Far
otherwise ; the errors of the libertine are
too frequently so imbued with the cha-

reason, and to end but with the life
of the wretched being they tyrannize

of the unhappy Gabrielle ? On accident
alone; no meteor presenting itself to his
eyes, no attraction offering, he walked
directly forward, nothing occurring to
lead him astray; he sought not temp-

Novelty, in the form of Milborough,
presented itself to Angelo, and he was
incapable of resisting the attraction: it
is not age that checks the career of folly
in the libertine--no, his follies then be
come vices, they degenerate into depra-
vity ; his feelings become vitiated, and
he possesses no longer that choice deli-
cacy of taste attendant on the pride of
youth. Thus, from having been in an

unguarded moment, by the influence of
an idle boy, induced to pay a slight
share of attention to a presumptuous
menial, he found himself involuntarily
interested, drawn frequently upon vari-
ous pretexts to her apartment, and each
time of seeing her, that she occupied,
when out of her presence, an increased
portion of his thoughts. Her artful
deineanour tended greatly to strengthen
those at first vague impressions; in it he
saw, or fancied that he saw, a deep
concealed love struggling with the pro-
foundest respect, and most invincible
timidity. If he entered suddenly, she
started, blushed, and trembled, forgot
her employment, hesitated, and knew
not whether to stand or sit. If she
chanced to meet him, which she likewise
endeavoured to do as frequently as pos-
sible, she stood still, seeming undecided
from confusion whether to pass him, or

turn back. Angelo was convinced by these
appearances, and while he compassion-
ated an unhappy love, he involuntarily
thought with tenderness of her who loved.
Mean time the conduct of Milbo-
rough towards Gabrielle was widely
different from the respect she evinced
for Angelo, and from what it had
formerly been to herself; it was such
precisely as a vulgar mind, impudently
elate in anticipated good fortune, must
manifest to one, whose high superiority
it had presumed to envy.' Gabrielle,
mild as she was, became incensed at this
change in the manners of a domestic,
who had so much reason to persevere in
a proper line of conduct, and she taxed
her with her presumption in terms, for
her, unusually severe. At her just reproof,
the countenance of Milborough wore an
audacious expression, between a sneer

and a smile of triumph, and she deigned
not to utter a sentence in mitigation of
her faults..
It was the aim of this intriguing wo-
man to bring as early as possible her
plans to bear ; she desired to provoke
Gabrielle to dismiss her from her service,
and while, to induce this result,she sought
by the most unqualified insolence and
offensive demeanour to try her patience
beyond endurance, she caused Felix to
represent to his father that she felt
such symptoms of indisposition, as
announced premature decay

tears, lamenting death only as it would

deprive her of the happiness of seeing
her dear Felix a man.
This was sufficient to hasten Felix, who
for this worthless being possessed anaffec-
tion far greater than for his amiable mo-
ther, to disclose to his father her most im
portant secret. Angelo, with a momentary
flutter at his heart, saw it was for him she
pinedhe felt interested ; and half deter-
mined in his mind, that if Gabrielle, who
was incapable of so unworthy an act,
should dismiss the poor creature on ac-
count of ill health, to make it a point to
do all that humanity required of him to
promote her comfort. Thus did he seek ever
to blind himself to the real motives that in
certain particulars actuated his conduct.
He formed immediately a pretext for
paying her a visit, and in the plenitude
of a deceiving self-love, he conceived, on
regarding her, that her cheek looked

paler, and her form reduced. This idea
gave an additional victory to that slow
undermining power she was gaining over
his heart, and caused him, when he dis-
covered the increasing interest which he
felt for her, to excuse himself with the
vain reflection, that she was a female
formed for a higher station than the one
in which fortune had placed her.
While her mean and treacherous influ-
ence was thus gaining ground in the
mind of Angelo, her conduct became
daily mere insufferable' to the , pride
and feelings of Gabrielle. She at length
determined to dismiss her, but in con-
sequence of her having been, as she be-
lieved, a tender nurse to. Felix, she de-
cided, first to inform Angelo of the va-
rious causes, she had received from her
of provocation, and to ask his concur-
rence in her intention. Accordingly

she took the first opportunity of intro-
ducing the subject, expressing at the
same time her regret that the ingra-
titude of the woman at so late a period
of her service, should have induced her
reluctantly to entertain an ill opinion of
her heart. Ere she had half concluded,
Angelo interrupted her, and while his
conscience smote him for the thought
he cherished, he hastily exclaimed,
"Why not at once discard her ?"
" I intended to have informed you
such was iny wish," observed Gabrielle.
Why ask my concurrence, upon
such a trifle," he faltered with a slight
blush:-" do itdo it this instant, if
you choose.".

proposal, (for though she had sometimes
been obliged to think severely of An-
gelo, she had never yet thought humbly
of him,) dropped the subject as unwor-
thy further discussion, simply resolv-
ing to put her purpose in immediate
execution. Thus in a few hours Mil-
borough received orders to quit the
house; she only smiled at the mandate,
and prepared to obey with alacrity.
While she was busilyemployed, Angela,
led by one of those impulses he never
knew how to resist, entered her apart-
ment. Milborough, who had fully ex-
pected this visit, nevertheless affected
surprise, forgot as usual in what she
was engaged, and in the utmost agita-
tion stood still. Angelo, scarcely con-
scious of the purport of his visit, re-
garded her with some embarrassment;
he felt humbled, and ashamed of the
situation in which he found himself, yet

" And do you so much regret that,
Milborough," said Angelo, in a sooth-

she knew when to be silent. Angelo's

held, unworthy Angelo! and causing
Milborough to be seated, he said in the
low voice of a man who is conscious
that he is saying what he ought not,

that although you quit this house, I
shall ever remember you with gratitude
for them the tenderness you have evinc-
ed towards my son, andand"

"Of love then, Milborough," cried
Angelo, with a smile. "But whither do
you go from hence? inform me at once,
for I hear Felix coming towards us."
" I hear him too, my lord," said Mil-
borough with a timid glance ; "and

gelo approached his ear, and the rest
of her communication was whispered ;
when, unwilling that just at this moment
Felix should behold him with Milbo-
rough, he glided hastily through the
door that led into the apartment where
first he had become debased by attending
to her. Miserable Angelo! how art thou
sunk, when even from the presence of
thy child; thou fliest in confusion !
Triumphing in the folly of the one, and
the miseryshe was preparing for the other,
the worthless Milborough quitted the
house of her benefactors, where for years
she had possessed all the comforts of po-
lished life, and been cherished as the hum-
ble friend and well wisher of the family;
in return she had insulted the wife, se-
duced the husband, and corrupted the

A newra of folly, or rather of vice, in
the life of Angelo, now presents itself; the
vice no longer of youth either, but of
maturer years, the most unworthy, the
most inexcusable, of all his former vices.
If in the seduction of Gabrielle might
be pleaded an impetuous love, excited
by her manifold perfections ; if in for-
saking such excellence, might be pleaded
his natural fickleness, allured by the
sprightliness and affected simplicity of
an Oriana ; if further outraging a love
and sentiments of which he was unwor-
thy, he could presume to offer in, exte-
nuation the ravishing beauty, youth,

could he urge, when neither youth,
grace, mind, nor manners, could be ad-
duced as the attraction? What but a
cureless depravity of taste, which being
satiated by that which is good, seeks to
excite anew a sickly appetite, by a refer-
ence to that which is bad ?

Milborough possessed nothing, impar-
tially considered, to charm or to allure;
she was neither beautiful nor young,
nor from her birth and education could
she possibly be even elegant; in all pro-
bability she would for ever have passed
unnoticed by Angelo, had she not intro-
duced herself to his attention by flatter-
ing his vanity. Instantly he discovered
in her a thousand charms, which she
possessed not, and which, but for that
single inducement, he never would have
conceived her to possess. Now he be-

came weary of the sameness of being
virtuous, though he was only negatively
so, and longed again for the meretricious
pleasures of guilt.
Thus then, after the departure of the
-worthless Milborough, his feet wander-
ed from home towards her habitation;
her joy at beholding him, though
decorously she desired to veil it, scarcely
could be concealed from his view. The
first decisive step once taken, the suc-
cessive ones were easy, and followed ra-
pidly; visit produced visit; from fre-
quency, grew familiarity, from famili-
arity a fixed and settled intercourse that
ultimately involved the most terrible
consequences.
For a time Milborough continued to
pay court to the weak side of Angelo,
which her keen vulgar cunning had dis-

covered to be an inordinate vanity: this
mode of conduct had first drawn him
towards her, and now rivetted him, and
when at times his own polished education,
refined knowledge of customs, and pro-
priety, would discover to him the gross
inaccuracies of Milborough, he would
excuse himself for being pleased with
her society in the fancied conviction of
her possessing an excellent heart, and
in the flattering belief that if he were
to abstain from seeing her, she would
die of grief. But when once a vulgar
mind gains an ascendancy over a weak
one, its obsequiousness ends, and the
fawning flatterer becomes a most insuf-
ferable tyrant; its requisitions are those
of profound folly, ignorance, and bound-
less presumption; and such trammels
are more difficult to be shaken off than
those of wisdom or of virtue.

Such was Milborough: she waited
patiently till she beheld her empire se-
cure; that it was so she ascertained by
increasing gradually her demands upon
Angelo; and finding each time that they
were complied with without a single re-
monstrance, although she well knew at
the time, they were such as he must
find it difficult to compass; for exam-
ple, among other things, she once desired
him to procure for her some jewels which
she remembered to have seen Gabrielle
wear, promising that she would return
them immediately that she had used
them once, and he might then replace
them from whence he took them, ere
Gabrielle could perceive that they
were missing. The imprudent Angelo
complied with this most insolent de-
mand, when to his confusion she after-
wards laughingly refused to resign them,
and observing his embarrassment, vowed

like a fury that she was determined to
keep them, or never see him more.
Angelo, in the true spirit of the liber-
tine, who requires a zest even to what he
loves, was terrified at this threat; for
though he might have endured a sepa-
ration with indifference, had he found she
trembled at the thought, yet when she be-
came the instigator, he discovered in her
charms which he had never seen before.
But what resource had he in the dilemma
in which he had unwarily involved him-
self? Unwilling to lead Gabrielle into
the error of suspecting any one unjustly,
unwilling to appear or to acknowledge
himself a thief in her eyes, he had then
only this alternative. He caused a set
precisely similar to those he had deprived
her of to be formed in paste, and replaced
them in her cabinet ere, domestic and
unadorned as she ever was, she had mis.

sed them. Oh ! passion, when indulged
for a worthless object, to what degrada-
tion wilt thou hurry man!
Mean time Gabrielle who had been for
some time in ignorance of this disgrace-
ful connexion, and who could not possi-
bly suspect it, from having been accus-
tomed to appreciate too highly the pride
and dignity of Angelo, now heard of it
from all with whom she had any ac-
quaintance, who scarcely even imagined
it a secret from her; her own servants
were fully informed of the odious truth,
and though they seemed indignant at the
infamy of Milborough, and treated their
mistress with increased respect, it was
perhaps more from envy (which ever
exists among the vulgar against each
other) at the good fortune of the former,
than sincere and generous sympathy in
the outrage offered to the latter.

Indeed, the low minded Milborough
did her utmost to impress upon the mind
of Gabrielle, that these reports were far
from being unfounded : she had an ele-
gant establishment, and she disguised
from no one, that it was the Count
D'Albini who enabled her to support it;
she had an equipage emblazoned with
his arms, servants wearing his livery,
and with these her base and insensible
soul led her to parade in unblushing
triumph past the door of her former mis-
tress, in hopes of at some period attract-
ing her attention. Sometimes she even
carried her shameless audacity so far as to
force into the seat beside her, the weak,
degraded Angelo, who, fearing to re-
fuse, was borne along to catch the view of
her he was so cruelly insulting, yet not
unblushing, but trembling like a cul-
prit who hides his head, with shame,

Gabrielle saw, in silence saw, the
career of Angelo, at a period of life when
the wild horses of folly slacken their
course, and reason, becoming powerful,
calls them from the chace; when the
soul desires to rest from vain and ignoble
pursuits, and experiences in the calm of a
reformed and virtuous life, more hap-
piness than was ever found in the palling
irrational excesses of youth. She lived
in the firm and pious hope, that each
day would convince him more deeply of
his misconduct, and that better reason
must speedily prevail over what she
considered the last ebullitions of expiring
error.
Bitter adversity, frequent disappoint-
ment, had so rationalized as it were the
firm mind of Gabrielle, that she now con-
sidered events rather in a philosophical
point of view, as resulting from an ine-

vitable necessity, and not therefore to be
deeply or vainly lamented. In the pride
of her youth and beauty, bitterly had
she felt the derelictions of Angelo ; but
now with a huinility that rendered her
but more exalted, placing the rich trea-
sures of her mind from the question, and
estimating her personal charms even far
below their real standard, she remember-
ed that she was no longer so young or so
attractive as formerly, and that the pas-
sions, tastes, and inclinations of men out-
living, from their habits and mode of
education, those of women, would some-
times lead them to pursue to a late pe-
riod of life the means of indulging or gra-
tifying them, and that therefore they
were not to be too severely arraigned for
faults almost implanted in their nature.
Thus did she endeavour to excuse in An-
gelo, not only to herself, but to others, a
conduct for which all who knew her

despised and condemned him; and this
she did, still cherishing hope, that her
patience, toleration, and forbearance,
must have ere long its effect over a good
and honest heart, which still, spite of
his errors, she believed Angelo's to be.
Neither could she think, as at first she
could not credit who it was that had at.
tracted Angelo, that an object so every
way despicable could continue to de-
tain him in the path of evil.
But when at length hope faded from
her bosom, and still she perceived that
his degradation continued; heart-sick and
wretched, she shut herself up in her
chamber; and a native pride which few
could understand, and which she inhe-
rited from her noble father, made her-
refuse to see any one whose pity must
have humbled, and whose unfeeling con-
dolence she would have deemed an insult.

soon, that in flattering herself the dread-
ful misconduct of Angelo would be but
of short duration, she possessed not
a just knowledge of human nature ; for
the errors of later years are far more in-
veterate than those of youth. She per-
ceived likewise that what little decorum
he had for a time thought fit to observe
towards her, and which had been with
her indeed a strong ground of hope (for

demeanour succeeded, not more cruel and
unworthy, than it was offensive to deli-
cacy and propriety. He was now sel-

possible the sight of the injured Gabri-
elle, but if accidentally they met, he
seemed impatient, and his manners were
constrained, or coldly polite.. What al-

ternative for her under circumstances
so hopeless ? She still remembered she
had a son; atsome future period she might
be assured that she had still a daughter;
she decided then at once to remain un-
shaken, to bear and to forbear with the
father for the sake of his children.
Such was her resolution, a resolution,
as she conceived, of duty and necessity.
But soon she found that even on this
principle she might be justly exonerat-
ed from further endurance of the treat-
ment of Angelo, from the sacrifice of
her best and tenderest feelings at the
shrine of that duty which had ever been
the invariable motive of all her actions,
and to which she was still willing to be-
come a martyr.

rior mother but little affection, bestowed
allof that sentiment which he was capable
of feeling on the abandoned Milborough,
for whom he pined in secret, and whom
since her departure from the house he
had not seen. In vain did the unfortu-
nate mother seek in the eyes of her son
for some shadow of respectfully tender
commiseration; in them she beheld,
often a restless roving expression, but
at all times an indifference to her. There
was no eloquent sympathy in the tone of
his voice ; in his manners, no soothing
gentleness ; from him too was she com-
pelled to turn with a deep drawn sigh
of anguish, but in that sigh remembered
that though unhappily he loved her
not, he was her son.
Such became the boundless and auda-
cious extravagance of the worthless Mil-
borough, whose aim it was as much to

reduce Angelo to beggary, to destroy
Gabrielle, as to enrich herself, that the
magnitude of her demands sometimes
anticipated, and even exceeded the re-
ceipts of Angelo. In his absence she
kept the lowest society, such as was
most consonant to her birth, ideas, and
former station, and indulged with them,
in the most expensive and riotous ca-.
rousals. As a man is rarely singly vi-
cious, that is, vicious in a single point
alone, Angelo, to support and gratify
the unlimited profusion of this woman,
found an excuse for resorting with in-
creased ardour to what had ever been a
favourite pursuit of his, the vice of
gaming: success had attended him often,
when as a pleasure merely he yielded
to the propensity, but now that he re-
sorted to it as a mean, while Milbo-
rough was draining him on one hand,
this was impoverishing him on the other.

Loss succeeded to loss, and his perpetual
failure, so far from inducing him to with-
draw, ere certain ruin should ensue, ren-
dered him desperate, and caused him to
persevere, in the delusive hope, that one
fortunate throw would speedily retrieve
all. He was mistaken however; fortune,
fickle like himself, repaid him in kind,
and fled from him when most he court-
ed her.
It now remained only for the artful
Milborough, who had found the pliant
Angelo acceding, whether remonstra-
tingly or otherwise, but still acceding
to her every request, to propose to him
one which in insolence and depravity
should far exceed any which she had
hitherto proposed. It was not enough
for her, that by the most ruinous ex-
cesses, and shameless profligacy, she
was shortening the life of Gabrielle, as

she was abridging her means of exist-
ence, but she desired to injure her in a
deeper degree, or rather to destroy her
at once.
Aware that though she had weaned
the love of Felix from his mother, yet
aware likewise of her extravagant fond-
ness for him, and considering that while
he was no longer in the sphere of her
attraction, nor capable of being conta-
minated by her influence, nature and
the exquisite goodness of his unhappy
parent might prevail in his heart, she
determined to deprive Gabrielle of him,
whom groundlessly she feared might
prove a consolation to her in her misery;
and for this purpose she demanded of
Angelo, in that flattering fawning tone
in which she usually solicited favour's
of him, and which, strange to say, sel-
dom failed of producing its effect, that

he would permit, as the highest gratifi-
cation he could confer on her, that the
boy Felix might visit her for one day,
adding, " I know you will not refuse
me, my dearest Angelo: you never look
so captivating as when you grant my re-
quests." Angelo, with a pleased smile,
while he absolutely considered her the
most engaging female he had ever
known, replied that he would think of
what she required, secretly determining
in his mind, without the smallest com-
passion for the feelings of the insulted
Gabrielle, that he would surprise her
that very evening with the sight of her
favourite Felix.
Nothing could equal the sycophantic
insidiousness of Milborough, when she
wished to gain a point with Angelo, no-
thing her base deceit; she could be
compared only to the snake, which

gently coiling round the victim it wishes
to destroy, twists tighter and more
tight till its firm grasp can be no more
disputed, and agonizing death ensues.
Possessed of no internal dignity, no
high-mindedness, the most abject mean-
ness of conduct conveyed no unpleasant
feeling to her heart: she flattered, and
fawned, and crouched, when desiring
a favour ; she was arrogant, and daring,
and insufferable, when she had obtained
itpassing rapidly from the extreme
of slave to tyrant. But if by a most
unusual chance she did not immediately
obtain it, if Angelo dared to hesitate,
then she had another line of acting in
reserve ; she ranted, stormed, and threat-
ened that if he did not instantly com-
ply, she would quit him suddenly, and
he should never hear of her more; thus
artfully bringing before him as a mis-
fortune, that which would have been for

him the greatest good that could have
befallen.
Faithful to his intention, the degraded
Angelo left her for the purpose of re-
turning to her with Felix. As the youth
was frequently a companion in his ram-
bles, to the edification neither of his
head nor heart, his going with him from
home excited no remark from Gabrielle,
but pleased her rather, from the so na
tural conviction that he could not be
going to Milborough.
Felix neither asked nor cared whither
he was going; he was going from home,
from under the same roof with his ever
melancholy mother and his vivacity spee-
dily revived, thoughtless and wild. An.
gelo made no observation with respect
to the object he had in view, till they
arrived at the door of an elegant habi.

tation; as soon as they gained admit-
tance, he ran up stairs, bade Felix fol-
low, and in a moment he was in the pre-
sence of Milborough, who receiving
him with open arms, scarcely knew how
to express the exuberance of her joy.
Felix was now happy, he was with
Milborough; he thought indeed she ap-
peared less handsome, because less
easy
than in her homely attire, but she was
more sprightly than his melancholy mo-
ther, and towards him at least was un-
altered. Too young accurately to un-
derstand, he yet surmised something of
the truth, and easily perceived that his
favourite Milborough was likewise, as
he had often wished her to be, a favou-
rite with his father; he looked upon her
as his indulgent mother, who never ex-
erted over him any authority like his
severe one, as he had been taught to

consider the mild and gentle Gabrielle,
and who, if she could see him happy,
would never disapprove of the means by
which he became so.
The education of the youth, independ-
ently of his little application, was, through
the eternal procrastination and care-
lessness of Angelo, but very slightly im-
proved; he feared to damp his young
energies by ponderous and oppressive
study, he remembered that he himself
had never been pestered with school
learning, and that he had parents (to
the full as inconsiderate towards him as
he was now towards his own son,) who
would not suffer him to quit home, or to
clog his sprightly genius, but procured
for him a private tutor, under whom he
made sufficient progress to qualify him
for the rank and situation he was to
hold in society; while from his mother

he learnt affability and sweetness of
manners, from his father, polite and ele-
gant demeanour. Such then he insisted
should alone be the education of Felix.
Thus is error transmitted from father to
son, and frequently perpetuated to the
destruction of successive generations.
A private tutor, Angelo observed, might
be always obtained; mean time he could
himself impart to his son some necessary
instruction, and it was useless to de
prive himself so precipitately of an en-
tertaining companion and pleasing asso-
ciate, of whom he was so extravagantly
fond.
Thus, then, on Gabrielle devolved the
task of fitting his young mind for future
study, by imbuing it with a love of sci-
ence and thirst of further knowledge.

and careful hand of a father, she desir-
ed to impart to her Son, and fully ade-
quate was she to the task: but Felix
soon perceiving that no one but her at-
tempted to restrain him, (for Angelo,
uninindful even of his own arrangement,
had no leisure as yet to give instruc
tions which he could at any time im-
part,) and that his avocations with his
mother detained him frequently from a
pleasurable excursion with his father,
or from some entertainment prepared for
him by Milborough, conceived, from
the imprudence and improper conduct
of those around him, a disgust for stu-
dy, which, at the insinuations of the do-
mestic traitor, Milborough, who might
have differently exerted her influence,
was easily transferred into a dislike of
her who taught. Thus, from the pecu-
liarly unfortunate situation in which she
was placed, Gabrielle perceived by slow

degrees, and with an anguish inexpres-
sible, her power over the mind of her
son on the wane; he no longer attend-
ed to her implicitly, or if she succeeded
in rivetting him for a moment, Angelo
would too frequently call him off for
some more agreeable, but more unprofit-
able pursuit. Felix by these means was
induced rather to shun than court her
society; and, in dismay at finding herself
the only tyrant of the youth, her firma
perseverance relaxed, for she felt that
those instructions must be useless which
were never received but with reluct-
ance. Thus was a fine field left open for
the suggestions of ignorance and depra-
vity; for where wisdom and virtue were
not suffered to take root, the weeds of er-
ror sprang up apace.
Milborough had asked of Angelo that
he would permit Felix for once to visit

ed, would not have answered her pur-
pose; she therefore having obtained pos-
session of the youth, would no more suffer
him to depart, but assured Angelo laugh-
ing, that having long this idea in view,
she had had an apartment in readiness
for him, for some time past. Angelo was
confounded; he declined entering into any
dispute with Milborough before his son,
but flattered himself that he should
easily prevail upon her to give up so in-
decorous and extravagant a caprice at
another opportunity.
Mean time Felix, rejoiced to excess,
was permitted to remain, and the aban-
doned Milborough carried as usual her
point.

CHAPTER XX.
The unhappy Gabrielle, immured al-
most always in her solitary chamber, worn
out, and nearly heart-broken with cease
less suffering and disappointment, felt
that with her intellectual energy so long
upheld, (but now rapidly sinking)
her physical strength was decaying like-
wise, and that long thus she could not
continue to exist. The few who, attract
ed by her singular worth and merits, had
made it a point to call themselves her
friends, captivated more by the desire of
appearing liberal and high minded than
from any real admiration they were ca-

73
pable of feeling, she had from the humi-
liating dereliction of Angelo refused to
see, for they had been his friends before
they had professed themselves hers; and
her genuine sense of delicacy and honour
shrunk from the impropriety of hearing
animadversions passed upon him on her
account, or from the contemptible mean-
ness of seeking to inspire pity by the
gentle resignation with which she en-
dured insults, that she could have wish-
ed unknown for ever to any but her-
self.
2
Thus, she was almost isolated. Angelo
she scarcely ever saw, and Felix when in
her presence appeared not employed by
any thought so much as that of escap-
ing from it. Now, of beholding even
him sometimes, she suddenly found her-
self deprived ; where could he be? A
dreadful idea glanced across her mind,

he must be with his father:--should she
condescend to inquire of the servants if
he had returned and departed again
alone?---No, to no eye could she volun-
tarily betray her grief, and mortifying
ignorance of the movements of those so
near to her. She determined then to
preserve silence, but vigilantly to watch
for the moment when Felix should make
his appearance, and question himself as
to whither he had been.
But in vain she was silent, in vain she
watched. Felix appeared no more. The
anguish of her mind became intense, she
felt almost certain where he lingered, and
had half determined to address Ange-
lo by letter upon this dreadful subject,
when with his usual constrained air he
suddenly appeared before her.

the moment she beheld him, incapable
of restraining her emotion, while he
cooly bowed ;" Angelo, oh ! let us wave
all idle ceremonies for the present, I
am too sick to attend to them, tell me,
and tell me truly I beseech you, where
is my son ?your son?"
"Really, Gabrielle, this is such an ex-
traordinary salute that--that I,"he
stopped embarrassed.

Gabrielle, seizing him bythe arm--"away

"Oh God!" interrupted Gabrielle,
clasping her hands, and bursting into
tears" is it thus then that you treat me,
Angelo !--But no matter," she pursued,
endeavouring to throw firmness into her
voice, and to collect herself; "inform me
only of my sonI claim a right, sir, to
be informed
upon
that subject."
Angelo was awed, and shrank into him-
self; he felt that Gabrielle had justice
on her side, and that he had not. Like a
culprit summoned before a judge, comes
to defend a bad cause, and seeing his ac-
cuser before him is struck dumb by the
power of conscienceso Angelo, when he
raised his eyes to the accusing form of
the injured Gabrielle, felt how truly
guilty he was, and remained silent. "Ga-

mined not to utter any, for she felt their
inutility, since he who is not just from

the voice of reproof; but finding that he
still preserved a confused silence, she in
a firm voice repeated her question.

mered Angelo.

Angelo was silent; he looked aside. Ga-
brielle fixed on his varying countenance
her sad, yet searching eyes, and uttered
in a voice of solemn anguish,
" He is with Milborough."
Angelo started, as if in horror that it
should be so--so true is conscience. He
inade no reply.
Your silence is sufficient confirina-
tion," pursued she in the same impressive
tone : "now then, Angelo, ere it be too
late, return him to me."
That cannot be," said Angelo.
" Cannot be !--cannot be !" shrieked
Gabrielle,again overpowered by the vio-
lence of her feelings"Oh Angelo, An-
gelo," she continued, falling on her knees,

and raising her clasped hands towards
him, "I conjure you, not by your present
love, but by the love you once had for
me.--I conjure you for the future wel-
fare and happiness of your child, -if you
consider aught that is most valuable to
him in existenceI implore, I beseech
you, let him not remain with that
woman : ---destruction, yes eternal de-
struction must ensue, not only of present
but of future life his soul will be sacri-
ficed. Angelo, I implore you listen to
my prayer, return him to me ere he be
lost beyond redemption."
The heart of Angelo throbbed vio-
lentlyhe was' affected by her solemn
adjuration, but he desired not that she
should perceive it; he looked at Gabri-
elle for a moment, he durst not longer,
he endeavoured to raise her from the
ground as with averted face he said,

"In aught else command me, Gabri-

from her knees with a countenance of
fire, and looking sternly upon Angelo,

curse yourself for this !rememberre-
member---that he will curse you like-

" Frantic .woman!" cried Angelo,
roused to a consciousness of guilt, and
therefore of rage, at her awful prophe-
cy,
" Frantic woman! he is my sonI
have a right to do with him as I will,
and who dare dispute my pleasure?"
" His mother," answered Gabrielle in
a firm voice," she dares--sir, he is any

an interest in him !.!.
"Yes," interrupted Angelo, with a
bitter smile, more than he has in you !"
"The more my misfortune ! the more
my misfortune!" cried the wretched
Gabrielle in a voice of anguish, and
bursting into tears, " Cruel Angelo, I
little expected this reproach from you;
but still I will spare you."
Angelo, shocked at the observation
that had escaped him, detesting him-
self for his unworthy cruelty, found his
feelings of bitterness increased by his
self-contempt, and hastily cried, "Well,
madam, this scene is unnecessarily pro-
longed, I have other avocations."
Ah yes, too well do I know that you

pursued, endeavouring to subdue her
suffocating emotion,  hear me but a

claim my son, to be considered as the
mother of my child, grant me but this,
for surely you will not deny me all. Suf-
fer me once more to behold him, let me
take of him a last farewell, it may
enable me to exist a little longer under
this most cruel misery.
" Well," said Angelo, who though
he had not been generous enough to
concede for his past unfeeling insinua-
tion, yet desired to make some 'amends,
"Well, be it so then; I will bring him
to you presently."
" Let me see him alone."

tear struggling from its confinement,
fell hastily down her cheek, ' " I pro-
mise that he shall do nothing unwit-
tingly.""
Well, that conditional promise will
do," observed Angelo, while the incon-
siderate remark conveyed an added pang
to the lacerated heart of the mother.
Angelo prepared to depart; she sought
not to detain him, and he left the room,
promising that she should presently be-
hold her son.

Slight was the hope which Gabrielle
ventured to cherish from this promised

interview; her sole dependance was on
the power she might possess of working on
the feelings of the youth ; though he loved
her not,.,she determined to leave no means
untried to snatch him from destruction ;
the cruel remarks of Angelo, indeed, left
no room for: sanguine reliance, and
while her conscience proudly whispered
to her, that she had done, every thing to
deserve the fondest, affection of Felix,
she felt that even the consciousness of
virtue abates not the pang which is in-
ficted on the heart of a mother by a
child's ingratitude.
Theslavish and degenerate Angelo, re-
turning to Milborough, almost feared toin-
form her of the promise into which he had
catered; but at length he found courage
carelessly to insinuate that Felix must
return home with him immediately. No
sooner had he spoke than he beheld all

the fury gathering in the countenance
of Milborough ; she repeated the word
"home" contemptuously, and vowed
that the youth should not be suffered to
quit her presence, even for an instant.
But the word of Angelo was pledged,
and subject as he was, he resolved to
abide by it, and for once even to assert
himself; he therefore retorted upon Mil-
borough, expressing that his pleasure
should be obeyed, who had immediate
recourse to her usual violence upon all
occasions when Angelo presumed to op-
pose her. In a passion of rage he ex-
claimed, that as she had obtained pos-
-session of the boy by fraud and artifice,
she should not be permitted to detain
him by presumption :and violence, and
that if she persisted in her present oppo-
sition, he would not only depart with

him immediately, but she should never
behold him more.
No sooner had Angelo spoken thus,
than the fury sunk into tame submission;
she wept, and attributed her warmth,as she
termed it, to the ardent affection which
she bore the youth, and her fears of
trusting him out of her presence, lest by
some unforeseen event she should be de
prived of him for ever ; she concluded
by imploring of Angelo, that if he
determined to fulfil his purpose, he
would first suffer her to be a few minutes
alone with her beloved Felix. To this
the imprudent Angelo readily assented.
The youth, who had witnessed the alter-
cation respecting him, and who secretly
hoped that Milborough would prove
triumphant, accompanied her with ala-
crity from the room.

She employed the moments allowed
her by Angelo in steeling him to the
dreaded influence of his mother, and
exhorting him not to be seduced by her
pretended fondness and eloquent speeches;
for the wretched Milborough was well
aware of her own vulgar incapacity,
and that every triumph she gained over
the heart of Felix was obtained by means
most vile and reprehensible." Do not,
my dear lovely Felix," added she in her
illiterate jargon, "let yourself be pre-
vailed upon by fair promises and fine
acting to live again with your mother,
for youknow well how she used to damp
your spirits, and check you, my dear
boy, till my heart bled for you, and she
could never bear to see you happy. It
would be all the same again in a little
time, and you would wish yourself in
your grave before the end of a month.
Nobody, my dearest Felix, loves you as

I do, and nobody never can, not even
your father;all my happiness is to see
you happy." She pursued in a faltering
voice, and calling in the aid of tears,
which she suffered to trickle down her
cheeks, that their effect might not be lost
upon the youth, " and I am certain if
you do not return to me, I shall die of
grief; I feel it."
The youth embraced her with an af
fection due only to a mother, and vowed
that he would return to her, loving her
as he did a thousand times better than
his natural parent: indeed his senti-
ments were too much in unison with
those of his infamous adviser; she had
taught him to consider his mother, not
only with the utmost disrespect, but as
a severe and implacable judge, from
whom it was requisite to conceal the in
nocent indulgences which she bestowed

upon him; as a harsh overseer of every
pleasure, which as requiring none her:
self, she thought unnecessary for youth;
he was taught, in short, to regard her as
an enemy, rather than a friend, and a
capricious tyrant, rather than an anx-
ious mother. Above all, the vile Mil-
borough failed not to impress upon his
mind, what she had so often laboured
to effect, that his mother was no more
entitled to his veneration, from the
purity of her conduct, or her esteemed
rank in society, than she was to his af-
fection, for her kindness or indulgence;
adding, that she was now far inferior,
even to herself, inasmuch as the Count
D'Albini no longer considered her as
his wife. Thus, prepared with hypo-
critical caresses, and manifestations of
regret, she suffered him to depart with
Angelo, who had begun to grow impa-
tient, purely from the desire of getting

rid of an affair, in which he now regret-
ted to have involved himself. He ac-
companied the youth to the door of his
insulted mother, without making to him
any other observation than that when
she permitted him to depart, he should
expect to see him again, where of late
he had resided. To this remark, Fe-
lix promised acquiescence, with an ea
gerness that embarrassed and somewhat
shocked even Angelo: then, faithful to
his agreement, of not being present at
the interview;" when the door opened he
waved his hand, and left him. -
Felix walked leisurely up stairs, for-
getting, in the indifference or rather re-
luctance with which he performed his
task, the animation so natural to youth,

termediate space in the most painful
anxiety, had heard his arrival, and heard

his subsequent slow step upon the stairs,
which struck upon her ear as the knell
of death, and nearly deprived her of the
slight portion of hope and firmness
which she had been endeavouring to
acquire.
The door opened, the youth bowed
slightly and advanced. Gabrielle half
rose from her chair, to meet him, but
his cool and settled countenance, his un-
affectionate air, checked her instantly, and
again she sank down, merely stretching
forth to him her trembling hand, which
partaking the agitation of her whole
frame, was covered with a cold dew.
Felix approached, and took her hand;

sibility.
The anguished mother fixed her eyes
upon his youthful countenance, so
youthful yet so hard to her,upon that
countenance on which so often she had
gazed with fond delight, so fair, so
health blooming, surrounded in grace-
ful luxuriance by bright auburn curls,
while her's, sad contrast, was pale as death
itself; an unwiped tear rested upon her
frozen cheek, she resembled a broken
down lily upon which some remains of
the torrent that bowed it to the earth
still hangs. Her son raised his eyes to
that face in which sadness and despair
were so vividly depicted; he raised his
eyes, but cast them down again slowly-
his heart was 'unmoved.

durst not grant it its usual latitude,
" will you not speak to me?".
" I thought it was you, who desir-

" But, my dear love, after so long an
absence, have you not any thing to say
to me?"
"Not so very long 'an absence," re-
turned the youth with an insensible
smile, which was answered by a deep-
drawn sigh from the heart of the mo-

in an irregular voice, yet affecting noti
to notice his confusion.

you that I have. Do you not remember,

were extremely young, how fond you
were of me?, the care I took of you,
how I studied your happiness, your
pleasure ?" Tears hindered her from pro-

ground when having scarcely strength

unblushingly he acknowledged to prefer
to her! The thought was agony, was
horror, and she wept aloud.
Felix observed her intense anguish,
but he made no effort to allay it ; so es-
tranged was his heart from her, that he

patience only, at witnessing a grief by
which he was unaffected, and which
cast a gloom over moments that might
have been more pleasingly employed.

that his love, respect, and filial feelings
towards her had been for years undermin-

destroyer. " Grief, anguish, compassion,
were the predominant sensations of her
mind; she felt not anger, but acute re-

is my duty to command it, it is

lity towards a mother will subside:

My dearest child, say you will remain
with me; you shall have no cause to

But you say it is my duty," ob-
served Felix, the poison of Milborough's
base principles fermenting in his mind :
" it is not my duty."
Well then, my love, forget the term,

garding him with tearful eyes, willing
upon any terms to save him from com-
pleat destruction.

Felix interrupting her.

Felix,whose feelings were not refined
either by nature or education, did not
conceive, when he saw his mother rush
from the room, that what he had last
uttered could have produced such an
effect. His stubborn silence had been
now broken, and he rather expected from
her some reply; for a short time he re-
mained in the apartment she had so
abruptly quitted, supposing that she
would speedily return, and fearing to
go unbidden lest he should be again sub-
ject to a future similar interview. When
however he found that she neither re-
turned, nor sent any one to him, he con-
sidered himself at liberty to depart, and

the stairs, though he had only walked up,

he felt, when from beneath the roof of
his injured mother, his constraint va-
nishing, and his vivacity returning ; while
the joy with which he rushed into the
house of Milborough, formed a forcible
contrast to the reluctant step with which
he had entered hers.
The abandoned Milborough received
him with an exultation that she could
not disguise; he related to her the issue
of his visit, and all that had passed during
its continuance; for the conduct he de-
scribed himself to have pursued, he re-
ceived from her profuse caresses, and
unbounded expressions of gratitude, for
preferring her to his mother, and for
having so faithfully kept his promise of
returning to her.

on the wane, he recruited it by plentiful
libations to the rosy god.

One night, having lost to a consider
able amount, goaded on by rage, by a
despairing hope, and that resistless im-
pulse which ever actuates the real game-
ster, he drank off a bumper of the Tus-
can juice, and then, inspired with a false
courage, determined in a phrenzy, to
push fortune to the utmost, end not to
quit the table whilst a possibility of
staking aught remained, till he had en-
deavoured at least to cover the whole of
. his losses. He persevered, he was reso-
lute, and his resolution cost him dear;
he staked to the amount of every guinea
he possessed, he followed it up by all
he could call his, the house in which
Gabrielle still continued to drag on her
lingering existence, his equipages,

horses, plate, &c. and it was not till
he discovered that nothing more remain-
ed which he had a right to stake, (for
the house in which Milborough resided
was not his,) that he recovered his
senses to lose them again almost imme-
diately in madness of a different descrip-
tion, and torush a pennyless beggar from
the abode of ruin which late as that
very
night he had entered in comparative
affluence.
The chief of his property had been lost,
or rather transferred to one person that
person his dearest and most intimate
friend, one with whom he had sometimes
played with success, but more frequent-
ly to manifest disadvantage; he was steady,
politic, and cool, and found it no difficult
matter generally to come off conqueror
from one who was rash, inconsiderate,
without sufficient judgment to direct,

and without patience to abide by the
little he possessed. This friend, who,
though a man of the world, possessed
some feeling, perceiving the confusion
and horror of Angelo painted in his
countenance, seized him by the hand, and
cordially shaking it, bade him not let
dame Fortune obtain a victory over the
spirit of his soul, adding that he might
settle the affair between them at his lei-
sure, as it was furthest from his wish to
trouble or inconvenience him.
Such the language of the world, such
the consolation of their friendship ; and
even Ellesmere, the successful gamester,
possessed a greater share of feeling than
usually belongs to that class of beings,
who not only remorselessly strip each
other of all they possess, but attempt
neither to hide their exultation nor
speak' a word of consolation, however
vain, to the wretch they have driven

to ruin and desperation. In a state of
madness, such however as left him of
sense sufficient to feel his woe, Angela
reached the only spot which strictly
speaking he might presume to enter, the
abode of Milborough; he rushed into the
room, where she was sitting carelessly
singing an air with Felix ; one hand he
pressed to his burning forehead, the other
was stretched wildly towards them, ,as.
bidding them cease ; his glazed eyes wan-
dered around, his cheek glowed with a
feverish red, his brow was writhed, his
hair dishevelled, his vest torn open, and
his whole appearance the wildest image
of frenzy and despair, personified in the
ruined gamester;
" For Heaven's sake, what has hap-
pened, Angelo?" exclaimed Milborough,
starting up. Angelo made no reply, but

gazing on her, burst into a convulsive
laugh.
" Good God! he is certainly mad,"
cried the unfeeling Milborough, rushing
toward the bell.
Stay, Milborough," he exclaimed,
violently seizing her arm, roused by her
remark, and the action which accompa-
nied it," I am not yet quite mad, but I
soon shall be ; I am ruined, stripped of
every guinea I possess ; I have not," he
cried, raising his voice to frenzy, "no,
I have not wherewithal to procure bread
for to-morrow,"--and at the horri-
ble conviction, his eyes rolled wildly
round.
At this explanation the countenance
of Milborough suddenly changed, her
selfish terrors gave place to other ideas,

but no less selfish ; had Angelo spoken
for ever, he could not have said more to
her than was confirmed in the few words
he had uttered in the short sentence," I
am ruined !"After the pause of a moment,
her countenance again underwent a
change, she drew near him; and taking
his hand she said, " Is this all, my dear-
est Angelo ?"
** All!--all!" interrupted Angelo, " is
it not enough 5"
"Certainly it is dreadful, but notsuffi-
cient to throw you into despair. One
lucky cast might yet retrieve all, per
haps."

not told you that I am beggared! that
I have no longer a claim to the chance of
another cast 1--oror do you think I

would, like a coward, have retreated?"
added he, breathing the desperate defi-
ance of the gamester,
"Well, well, my dearest Angelo, com-
pose yourself, a glass of wine will do
you
service. Fly, Felix, and procure some
wine for my lord."
Angelo with a desponding groanthrew
himself into a chair ; wine was brought,
Milborough poured him out a full
goblet, and presenting it to him, entreat-
ed that he would drink ; fevered with
heat, and his mouth parched, mechani-
cally he took the wine, and swallowed
it.
By dint of persuasion she prevailed
on him to drink a second glass, a third
and fourth then rapidly followed : from
the madness of despair, Angelo was pass-

ing fast into the madness of intoxication!
his cares began to assume an aspect less
terrific, and the
and the exhilirating hope
which is inspired by wine, caused the
future to appear less gloomy; by degrees
his moody despondency vanished, and, as
had been the secret aim of Milborough,
he applied spontaneously to the bottle
for that seducing influence, which sweet-
ly blinded him to the frightful reality of
his situation.
Milborough now ventured carelessly
to revert to it:" But, my dear Angelo,".
she observed, "surely every thing is not
as bad as you think; you have sufficient,
I trust, to cover all; then you might re-
tire upon a little."
Upon nothing, you mean! I can
never redeem myself.")

But, my lord," cried Felix, " could
you not collect all you have at present
in your possession, and make your esa
cape to the Continent"
Angelo, nearly intoxicated, irritable,
and still alive to a certain sense of ho-
nour, looking fiercely at his son, seized
him by the arm, and for the first time
in his life inflicted on him a blow, and
inflicted it unjustly, for assuredly it was
no fault in the youth, that education had
not instilled into him proper principles,
or given him correct ideas.

of fire ; it was the first correction he

rushed to his eyes ! Milborough glanced
at him significantly, and affecting not
to notice the violence of Angelo, ob

throwing down the key, ." I know too

.-"Well," said Milborough, carelessly
taking up the key, which she twisted:
round her finger, "it will at all events
be a satisfaction to calculate;" so saying
she went towards the door, when sud-
denly returning, she exclaimed, " But I
forgot, I must not leave you, Angelo, I
shall have you getting gloomy again ;
come, take another glass of wine, and ba-
nish care."
Angelo heaved a sigh, and hastily
drank off the wine ; then leaning his head
upon his hand, he remained absorbed in
gloomy silence :- he had returned, ha-
rassed, fatigued, exhausted, at an un-
usually late hour ; it was now getting
dawn; his eyes were closed, his ideas be-
came confused, his heavy head dropped
from his hand, and he fell into a pro-
found slumber.

No sooner did Milborough per-
ceive that the wine had taken its desired
effect on him, than silently she rose and
beckoned Felix,(who was sternly brood-
ing over the blow he had received,) from
the room. Rising, involuntarily with
caution, he followed her out.
"Go," said Milborough in a whisper,
"if any of the servants remain up, tell
them they may retire, afterwards come
to me to the chamber of your

your father."

Felix left her, to act as she had de-
sired, while she, hastening to the chamber
of Angelo, remained at the door waiting
his return. In a few moments Felix ap-
peared ; Milborough placed her finger
on her lip, and in a low voice he said,
"I found only one servant up, and he
was in so deep a sleep that I could not
awake him."

"I am sorry you attempted it," said
Milborough, hastening as lightly as she
could down the stairs to the room Where
Felix informed her the servant was sleep-
ing;and then gently locking the door upon
him, retraced her steps to the chamber
of Angelo, still accompanied by Felix.
Having entered, she closed the door;
approaching his cabinet, she coolly un-
locked it, and taking thience all the gold
she could find, together with jewels to a
considerable amount, among which were
those that had appertained to Gabrielle,
and which she had obtained from An-
gelo by fraudulent artifice, she
them into the hands of Felix, saying,
" Let us at all events secure these from
the Count's creditors; it would be a pity
they should obtain all: as for these
jewels they are mine, and they have no
right to them."

: Felix acquiesced readily in her idea,
and accepted the things from her hands.
"Now then," said she, "Felix, be light
and cautious; descend the stairs--for we
quit this house for ever."
"Whither to go?" inquired Felix.
Far from hence, but where we shall
be safe."
" And my father " cried Felix, half
anxiously, half resentfully.

Felix frowned, and blushed with in-
dignant shame, at the recollection. " It

was without provocation," said he, and
hesitated no longer.
Milborough stepped lightly towards
her chamber; she wrapped herself in a
cloak which covered her entirely, and di-
vested her dress of all attraction; she then
proceeded down stairs with almost
breathless caution. Felix followed; they
reached the hall ; Milborough remained
a moment to secure about her own person
the jewels with which she had loaded
him, then silently unlocking the door
she closed, without venturing to shut it,
and proceeded with rapid pace along the
street.
As it was the height of summer, and
perfectly light at an early hour, they
passed along completely unnoticed and
unopposed. The object of Milborough
was to get by the quickest possible con-

qeyance to Dover, to arrive ere suspicion
could surmise her route, and from thence
embarking for the Continent, her fears of
pursuit would be at an end. In all
she had proposed, she succeeded even
beyond her most sanguine speculations;
she reached Dover early, and without
interruption, and a little time after found
herself in perfect safety on the shores
of France. Here, for a time, with her
youthful and misguided companion, let
us leave her, and return to the wretched
but justly punished Angelo.
A few hours after the departure of
Milborough, he was awakened by a vio-
lent noise ; opening his heavy eyes, he
found himself lying on the floor, and the
expiring flame of a taper burning in
the socket and emitting a faintirregular
light through the closed apartment.

f
The noise which had reused him still
continuing, he instinctively started up, and
hastened towards the spot from whence
it seemed to proceed : it was a loud
knocking, and appeared to come fromthe
lower offices of the house ; he followed
the sound, and soon discovered that it was
occasioned by his servant, who awaking
in alarm, and endeavouring to quit his
situation for the purpose of retiring to
bed, found his intention frustrated by
his inability to open the door, which had
been fastened upon him; in consequence
of this discovery, conceiving robbers
were, or had been in the house, in the
greatest trepidation he had essayed his
utmost to make himself heard. Angelo
having emancipated him, began to re-
cover his senses; he now clearly remem-
bered that he had not been in bed
for the night, but could by no means re-
concile to himself why he should have

been suffered to remain asleep upon the
ground, alone too, and not have been con-
veyed to bed. His whirling head informed
him that he had drank inordinately, and he
concluded, that overpowered with sleep,
he had fallen on the floor. But as this
was a circumstance by no means unfre-
quent with him, and he was in such
cases always attended carefully to bed,
why had he been now abandoned
with this most singular neglect and in-
difference?
Rage began to kindle in his bosom,
and hastily he sought the chamber of
Milborough, to upbraid her in the se-
verest terms for the impropriety of her
conduct, and the want of regard she
had evinced for him. He had questioned
the servant with respect to his confine-
ment, but receiving from himonly the most
unsatisfactory replies, that he neither

knew nor could surmise, he dismissed him
with intemperate revilings for his stu-
pidity, and hastened to the chamber of
Milborough, expecting from her ex-
planation of this circumstance and of
her own apparently unfeeling neglect.
Entering her room, with anexclamation
of reproach on his lips, he perceived
immediately, that she was not there, nor
had even been in bed! For a moment,
he stood amazed, then swifty retreating,
sought his own apartment, unknowing
what to expect. There the first and only
object which struck him, was his cabi-
net open, and its assemblage of drawers
dragged out to their fullest extent, and
completely empty! At this alarming
sight involuntarily he struck his fore-
head with his clenched hand, as an idea,
too dreadful to indulge, glanced like
lightning through his brain! He rushed

trembling towards the cabinet, examined
it nearer, brought every drawer com-
pletely forth, and cast them on the
ground, as if he desired some stronger
confirmation than visual sense could give
him of the dreadful view which presented
itself! It was but too true; he found in.
deed that he had been plundered of all
they contained, and, aghast with horror,
he stood for a moment unable even yet
to credit that he was perfectly awake.
All his gold, his jewels, even to a far
greater amount, had vanished ! his
dreadful situation, stern and unrelenting,
was revealed before him, and with a
bitter cry, rushing from the room, he
flew into every apartment, loudly voci-
ferating the name of Milborough, and
hoping still, in the midst of his despair,
that in some remote corner of the house
he might yet discover her, even though

manacled, and dying perhaps for assist-
ance; all, any thing, but that she should
have fled in a moment like the present!
In vain he called, in vain he searched,
Milborough answered not; his fears then
reverted to his son ; he sought his cham-
ber, he was not there either, he replied
not to his agonized repeated call; that
sinking overpowered on a chair, be
clasped his hands in horror; the whole
truth, the fearful truth, broke without
mercy and without reserve upon his
mind; no longer could he doubt Milbo-
rough was his plunderer, his son the
companion of her flight !
While thus he remained, the servant
he had with anger so unjust dismissed,
rushed into the room, and with a counte-
nance of terror, observed that he had
discovered the door of the hall to be

epen, that he apprehended the worst, but
had not courage to search the house
alone. "Go, go I know," cried the sick
and fainting Angelo,"I know allretire."
The wild abstraction of his air
alarmed the servant, who precipitately
obeyed, and left the room. Gloomily
musing, he still remained immoveable;
ruin was certain, it could not be accumu-
lated, nothing now could make it more
than ruin, and he felt in that state, when
the mind, conscious it has reached the
climax of woe, is incapable from that
dreadful consciousness of dreading aught
as an increase.

Some time did the wretched Angelo
continue thus tottering as it were on the
verge of madness, yet struggling to be
reasonable; now wildly his thoughts
dwelt on Felix, his boy so fondly yet
so injuriously loved. Why had the
monster robbed him of his son, his dear-
est treasure? Confused, bewildered, as he
was, the suggestion was obvious. She
had made Felix the companion of her
flight, to evade the probability of pur-
suit; for with that vile artifice peculiar
to such as her, justly and cunningly

had she calculated, that however An-
gelo,aroused from his infatuation by her
conduct, might determine to pursue her
with justice, when he reflected that by
so doing he must implicate his son, who
must of necessity have been privy to the
transaction, of which too she could
adduce proof, he would abstain al-
together from the attempt, anxious ra-
ther, however deep a sufferer he might
have been, to give as little publicity as
possible to the event; besides, he might
hope by his forbearance towards her, to
induce her to remand voluntarily the
youth to him; whereas if he listened
only to his revenge, she might not only
secrete him for ever, but through him
bring dishonour upon his name.
,
Suddenly Angelo started up from the
supineness of despair; he remembered
the obligations under which he existed,

and the necessity there was for his see-
ing Ellesmere that day. It was requi-
site he should impart to him the whole
of what had happened. With this idea
pressing on his mind, he hastily rush-
ed from the house, but scarcely had he
gained the street than it was displaced
by another, which preserved the ascen-
dancy; his first purpose was forgotten,
the image of the unfortunate Gabrielle
stood before him. Should Ellesmere, as
he was certainly entitled to do, have
waved courtesy, and promptly insisted
upon his right, she might at this mo-
ment be even destitute of a homne.
Something like a sensation of horror
and remorse shot through his heart;
quick as lightning he directed his steps
towards the spot where she had continued
to linger, and arriving at the house,
with impatient violence assailed the door.

the servant without an inquiry, and
bounding up the well known long desert-
ed stair-case, sought unannounced the
apartment where Gabrielle usually sat.
She was not there, and he heard the
voice of the servant behind him, who in-
formed him she was in her chamber;
thither he hastily proceeded, and burst-

| Gabrielle, pale, emaciated, the image
of settled hopeless melancholy, lay ex-
tended upon a couch, almost too feeble
to move. At the sight of Angelo, so
long estranged from her eyes, and with
air and countenance that spoke some dire
ill, her weakened nerves were nearly
over powered, a hectic blush of terror
and agitation flushed her hollow cheek;

She rose, and leaning on the back of
the couch, like a pale spectre she stood
immoveable.
"Hear me! hear me, Gabrielle!"
cried Angelo ; and in the effort he made
to explain to her the truth, reason a lit-
tle recovered her empire, "I have no
longer a house, nor you a home; I am
become a beggar! you are so likewise!
This house, together with all I once pos-
sessed, last night became forfeit, and now
appertains to Ellesmere! Say then, have
you no pity for me, Gabrielle! can you
not feel?Pity, did I say! ah, what
would it avail to a wretch like me, ruin-

into a chair beside him, devoid of ener-
gy, and his senses again began to wan-

Gabrielle became sensible of renovat-
ed strength, her firm elastic mind rose
beneath oppression, with towering
dignity; her faintly throbbing heart
beat quicker, her languid pulse with ac-
celerated motion ; she was no longer
feeble; with steady step she approached
the nerveless Angelo, and laying her
burning hand upon his arm, she said,
"Tell me, Angelo, why in this moment
have you thought of me? what have
you done with Milborough? where is
my son?"
Why question me thus?" returned
Angelo without raising his eyes from the
ground, "but if you would knowm-where
one is, there is the other likewise; learn
moreover, and triumphboth have plun-
dered me of all, and filed!"
Gabrielle spoke not ;
not; she raised

Heaven, while the expression of her
fine countenance was,
God! thou
hast punished him enough; now is it for
me to sooth !" The loss of her child
conveyed an acute pang to her heart;
but the youth loved her not, and, all ex-
cellent, all amiable as she was, it was
not in nature for this reflection to be
wholly without effect. Angelo she be-
held before her, in a state such as
implored oblivion of his errors; her
noble soul forgave that unconquerable
yet unjustifiable pride imbued in his
very nature, which, guilty as he must
feel himself, had not yet permitted
him to acknowledge his culpability
and sue- for pardon at her feet; she
knew well his was a mind which re-
quired to be softened, rather than re-
proached into submission.
In the moment of adversity, he had

thought of her; she was now all he pos-
sessed, and cruelly as he had outraged
her, he did justice to the magnanimity
of her mind and feelings. He had ap-
peared before her a wretch weighed
down with crime and misfortune. He
might have yielded to a sense of shame,
and shunned her still; but no, he had
humbled himself in her sight, by per-
mitting her to behold him thus punish-
ed, his conduct to herself avenged, and
had beseeched the pity of her whom
most he had injured.
These noble sentiments, these liberal
constructions, too liberal indeed towards
Angelo, whose weakness in the hour of
adversity, requiring the aid of firm and
energetic friendship, had had equal, if
not superior share in precipitating him
into her presence, awakened her heart
in his favour; and with the benignity of

a pitying angel she bent over him in
compassion; consolation appeared to her
to have become a duty, and in a sweet
soothing voice she said" Angelo,
arouse yourself, despair is impious; Since
your situation is such as you have de-
scribed, let us consider only what remains
to be done."
Angelo raised his lurid eyes, and fixed
thern upon Gabrielle ; he be held a coun-
tenance which resembled that of a sor-
rowing Madona, his heart was acutely
touched : "And is it from you then, oh,
ill-fated daughter of Montmorency !" he
cried, " is it from you that first I hear
the voice of consolation ? Oh, Gabrielle !

"No, Angelo," replied Gabrielle," at
this moment I can cherish against you
no feeling of bitterness. I am myself
a wretch meriting severest punishment,
my crimes exceed yours, and I hail mis-
fortune as salutary chastisement, as a
proof that God has not wholly abandon-
ed me, but would purify me for future
life, of which otherwise I should be too
unworthy! If I grieve, Angelo - if I
grieve, it isthat you should be the in-
strument of my punishment." Again
her pale face, her humid eyes were raised
to Heaven, and she seemed wrapt in the
fervour of her divine conceptions.

but be merciful as you are above me!
Deign only to reproach' me," he added in
a voice of bitter anguish, and bursting
into tears.
Gabrielle was recalled to earth; she
gazed upon her first love, upon the de-

Angelo sprang from his attitude of
despair to throw himself at her feet; he
embraced her knees, and kissed them with
frantic ardour, and raising his eyes to
her countenance, he cried," Gabrielle, I

your fair youth to destruction ! I have
now become a wretch in misery as well as
crime, beggared in every present and fu-
ture hope! Dare I then say itit is
only now I feel that fully I appreciate
your exalted virtue ! it is only now,
when such appreciation is but mockery
to you, that it breaks upon my benight-
ed soul, as the sun first sheds his dazzling
rays upon the sight of him who has been
for long in dreary blindness ! Here then
solemnly I swear to Heaven, that I will
dedicate to you the residue of my worth-
less existence. Gabrielle, look down upon
me, now sunk into most abject misery;
I pledge myself in the sight of the God
whom through you I have offended, to
make
you mine at his holy altar, should
you even yet deign to accept me. I pray
that he may visit me in all the thunders
of his wrath, if ever more I deceive,
abandon, or betray you."

" Rise, Angelo," cried Gabrielle in a
mournfully solemn voice;"I accept your
penitence,and would rather become yours
at this moment, than in the height of
your prosperity. But hear me, I am now
childless, I have no dear interests superior
to my own thatrequire my consideration;
above all I feel that though I should to-
morrow become your wife, Heaven would
not grant me long to enjoy a title that
once would have sounded so sweetly in
my ears !I feel --yes, I feel, that the
death of my father will be, by a just
Providence, avenged upon me!I too
am dying of a broken heart."
Angelo uttered a loud cry; his breast
became filled with remorse, and penitence
dawned
upon
his soul.
"Angelo!" said Gabrielle, in that tone
of voice which is firm from the long accus.

are once again returned to me, I shall not

: Angelo could not restrain his tears; he
sobbed, but Gabrielle could no longer
weep; she made no effort to check the
tears of Angelo, for she conceived that
they preserved him from despair.

In the midst of this scene, the door
opened, and a servant "announced the
name of Ellesmere; on Angelo it operated
like a thunder-clap, but Gabrielle bade
that he should be instantly admitted.

Gabrielle arose at his entrance, and invo-
luntarily a wed by the dignified grace of
her appearance, he bowed profoundly to
her, and advanced to Angelo, whom
he seized familiarly by the arm." D'Al-

that I had no desire to incommode you.

for him, in return for your polite atten-
tion, that this house and all that appears to
meet your approbation, will be at your
disposal by the evening."
Oh, by no means," cried the man of

upon the pictures," oh, by no means ; no-
thing on earth would tempt me to incon-
venience one of the softer sex, and par-
ticularly so fair a creature as yourself,"

Ellesmere was what is termed a po-
lished gentleman; he perfectly understood
the hint of Gabrielle; and he had wit
enough to perceive that idle compliments
and presumptuous admiration might of-
fend, but could not flatter her ; bowing
respectfully therefore, he moved towards
the door, and as he opened it, he said,
"D'Albini,we remain friends, I hope, in
spite of what has happened !--Ah, wil-
lingly would I give 'all Fortune's fa-
vours," directing his
directing his eyes towards Ga
brielle," to be even now situated as you
are."
Angelo endeavoured to command his
voice, his pride came to his aid, and he
replied, "Undoubtedly we remain friends,
why not?"
"Give me then your hand," cried El-
lesmere, " in token of amity."

With a sick smile, Angelo stretched
Forth his hand, and the friend who had
rendered him a beggar, shook it as cor-
dially as though he had been asking him
to dinner, bade him adieu with precisely
the same smile as he would have worn
to congratulate him on some good for-
tune, and would have felt as much interest
in the one, ashenow felt regretat the other.
No sooner had Ellesmere departed,
than Gabrielle, with that prompt energy
which had ever marked her youthful
character, determined to employ the few
hours that remained till evening, in the
service of him who now possessed onearth
no friend but herself. For him she forgot
anguish long endured, whose baleful ef-
fects were for ever remediless, feebleness,
pain, indisposition, and this with only the
most desolate prospects before her, as
the reward for her highest exertion. She
persevered nevertheless, and with an

alacrity no way inferior to what his best
conduct might have claimed, adopted
such measures as she conceived best cal-
culated for a speedy and prudential
arrangement.
From Angelo she now enquired more
particularly of an affair that had been as
yet but vaguely related, when it clearly
appeared to her that in saying he had
lost all, he had not exaggerated. Under
these circumstances it was only to sub-
mit with patience to what was unavoid-
able ; and while Angelo, plunged anew
into despair, by the detail of the ruin-
ous transaction in which he had been en-
gaged, remained incapable of action,
Gabrielle, a powerful instance of the
superiority of mind over matter, was
busily employing herself, feeble as she
was in body, in hastening the means of
final settlement, and departure from an

abode, which no longer considering
their's, her pride revolted at remaining in.
Since the desertion of Angelo, she had
retained only a couple of domestics in
her own service'; these she found herself
empowered to discharge to their satis-
faction, and without their having a wish
to remain where gloomy desolation had
spread her pinions and prodigality no
longer reigned. Her next consideration
was to seek some shelter for the night ; it
was impossible immediately to procure a
situation, such as might suit with their
present circumstances; she therefore de-
termined to postpone this attempt till the
morrow, and to avail themselves for the
present of some temporary accommoda-
tion, since to remain where they were an
hour beyond the appointed time was too
repugnant to her feelings.

Thus, ere the arrival of evening, her
vigorous management had arranged every
necessary step, and they were enabled to
take their departure from an abode which
she at least could not view with aught of
tender regret, from a recollection of the
happy hours she had of late passed
within its walls.

The primary source of her endurance
in unparalleled suffering, was not in a
mean, selfish, or ignoble passion, which
crouched most abject beneath ill treat-
ment, and which no indignities, no
cruelty could alter; not in such source
did it originate, but in her duty to her
children ; to bear and forbear, for them,
she deemed not disgrace, but glorious
martyrdom ! Fatal and unforeseen events
had exonerated her from this sacred and
painful duty, fraught throughout with
bitterness and severest trial.
Firm and unshrinking she had bared
her bosom to the darts levelled against it;
now she beheld him who had loaded her
with remorse and anguish, beheld him dis-
tressed, agonized, humbled to the dust. It
was not surely in the most abject nature
still to love! it could belong only to the
most noble still to pity! Such was Ga-

brielle's, she could cherish neither hate
nor revenge against him she had loved
once, neither could she still love
when her firm mind had received,
conviction that the object was at heart
unworthybut this precluded not pity,
and she felt it a duty incumbent on her to
perform from that, all that the profound-
est and most invincible love could have
dictated. Exalted was the soul of Ga-
brielle, and beautiful her religion, which
taught her charity towards every one's
errors but her own.
Thus then the unhappy Angelo re-
ceived from her unwearied attention ;
she sought as much as possible to detach
his mind from dwelling on his situation,
and exerted herself to cheerand to soothe
him by such reasoning as was suggested
by the divine influence of fervent piety,
that looks not with a vain sorrow upon

the afflictions of this life, but extracts
from them the sacred hope of future
better existence, for which sorrow best
purifies the soul !
All was however vain: Angelo possess-
ed not the towering mind of his com-
forter, he could not rise superior to the
influence of situation, he felt himself a
wretch within and without, surrounding
circumstances filled him with dismay,
and his conscience loaded him with rea
proach.
Nature by degrees became over power-
ed, he sunk into an alarming malady, and
incapable of opposing by energy or rea-
son that useless regret and ceaseless re-
pining which aggravated his disorder,
he was compelled to resort to his bed,
from whence never more he expected
to arise. Mean time Gabrielle, who la-

boured under a malady far more dange-
rous than that of Angelo, the malady
of the heart, who had been for long sup-
ported by her energies alone, now found
it necessary doubly to exert herself, and
to become the nurse and attendant of An-
gelo, as she was his only stay and hope..
It was requisite however to call in
medical aid, and this, together with the
additional expences incurred by his
illness, began to shew the alarming pro-
bability that such calls might ensue as
she would be unprepared to answer.
During the desertion of Angelo her
expenditure, never prodigal, had been
considerably abridged ; it was owing to
this circumstance that she had been hi-
therto enabled to compass the difficulties
that had occurred, and to assist Angela
when he no longer possessed resources
45

THE LIBERTINE.
for himself. Her rational and anticipat-
ing mind, had not failed to suggest to
her, that in order to preserve themselves
from future dreadful embarrassment, it
would be necessary that some plan
should be resorted to, to prolong their
present trifling means of subsistence.
The whole treasure they mutually
possessed were the jewels of Gabrielle,
and a small sum in specie. These of
themselves could not long suffice, and
hence the necessity conceived by Gabri-
elle of concerting some plan for future
support, ere the present means should be
entirely exhausted. The illness of An-
gelo, however, deranged and frustrated
her intentions; already she had found it
requisite to part with a few of her most
inconsiderable ornaments; and learning
from the physician she had employed
for him, that he conceived him in a state

THE LIBERTINE.
155
which would render it prudent to call
in other advice, she perceived there
would exist an inevitable occasion for
parting immediately with the most va-
luable ones.
The recovery of Angelo being a pri-
mary object, she determined that every
consideration should yield to it, whether
of calculating prudence or otherwise.
As soon therefore' as the physician who,
after visiting him declared his opinion
to Gabrielle, had departed, she returned
into the chamber of Angelo, and ap-
proached his bedside.
With that eager anxiety, which in
sickness is naturally manifested towards
one whom experience has proved to be
the only earthly being interested in their
welfare, Angelo, soon as he saw her,
stretched forth his feverish hands, and

in a faint voice exclaimed, " Oh, Gabri-
elle, tell me, am I to live or die?"
Live, assuredly," she replied with
a celestial smile, and tenderly taking his
hand. The indisposition of Angelo was
chiefly occasioned by the indulgence of
a useless and consuming grief, which
he had neither fortitude nor energy to
repel, rather than any real bodily ailment.
It was a strong affection of the nervous
system, accompanied by deep depression
of spirits and extreme irritability, which
rendered his malady more alarming than
dangerous.
Frequently trifles would overcome
him so much that he would burst into
tears; thus the feebleness of his mind in-
creased his physical debility, and ren-
dered him incapable of the smallest
exertion.

Now that he beheld Gabrielle stand-
ing beside him, and looking upon him
with that tender benignant countenance,
he was suddenly struck with the remem-
brance of the evils he had brought upon
her, and could not avoid contrasting his
conduct with the generosity and magna-
nimity of her's toward him; the im-
pression was too strong for his disorgan
nized feelings, tears rushed to his
eyes, and incapable of restraining his
emotion, he sobbed aloud. Gabrielle,
infinitely affected, sat beside him, and
endeavoured her utmost to sooth: by
degrees she succeeded, and when she ob-
served him calm, she said, " Angelo, it
will be requisite that for a short time I
should leave you ; will you promise me
that you will endeavour to sleep? I shall
then have the satisfaction of knowing
that you will not want any thing during
my absence."
## p. 158 (#178) ############################################

:"What, are you going to desert me
too at last?" cried he, in a mournful
voice.
" But I will return immediately; will
you not trust me, Angelo ?"
" And if I should die in your absence,
who will care for the wretched Angelo ?
who will visit his coldcorpse? - noone, no.
Ah ! who would ever have thought such
could have been my fate?" At this he
shed bitter though silent tears, while
Gabrielle almost wept to perceive such
lamentable imbecility of mind; but
fearing to increase by joining in this vain
depression, she subdued her emotion,
and cried, "Oh, my dear Angelo, you
must conquer these melancholy ideas;
believe me it is a weakness, wholly un-
worthy you. If you desire that I should
not quit you at present, most certainly I will

159
not; yet if for a few moments you
could
permit, I should rather, for sooner or
later I must;I will procure you an
attendant during my absence."
"An attendant!" exclaimed Angelo,
" what !  would you leave me to the
mercy of hired wretches ?--Oh, my God!
let me die at once, if such is to be my
lot."
Gabrielle, who had arisen, now pa-
tiently resumed her seat beside him; she
thought it useless and improper to irri-
tate him by further argument, and se-
cretly determined that if, as she hoped,
he should fall into a slumber, she would
seize that opportunity of escaping
to dispose of her jewels, and return
home with all the speed in her power.
Angelo remained silent for a consider-
able time; Gabrielle flattered herself he

was asleep, and to ascertain, she made
a gentle movement to rise. Immedi-
ately Angelo with a violent start drew
the curtains aside; his face was pale as
death, over which his dark hair hang-
ing dishevelled, gave him an air of wild-
ness.
" Gabrielle! for God's sake do not
leave me yet," he cried; "I think I
shall be better in a little time, and able
to bear your absence; but will you not
inform me where you are so desirous of
going ?"
From the air of alarm visible in his
countenance, the idea now first struck
Gabrielle that he really apprehended she
intended if possible to escape from him,
and desert him. Feeling for the horror
with which such an idea must impress
his weakened mind, and anxious that

161
for a momenteven he should not continue
to indulge it, she decided rather to ac-
knowledge to him the real object of her
mission abroad, though under other cir-
cumstances she would infinitely have
preferred the concealment of it, lest it
should give to his heart a pang she could
spare him. Looking at him with a smile
therefore, she said, " Since you are so
desirous of knowing my motive, I will
not disguise it from you, and then I
hope you will have no further hesitation
at parting with me for a few mo.
ments. I have some jewels, which are
altogether useless to me, in our present
state--my object is to dispose of them,
as--as I have occasion for money."
Angelo with a sudden spring raised
his weak frame in the bed; he fixed his
eyes upon Gabrielle with a wild stare,
his features were convulsed, and in a

jewels do you mean?"
")
"I will shew them to you, answer-
ed Gabrielle, wishing to divert his emo-
tion, which she attributed solely to the
sad necessity she had inferred of part-
ing with her jewels, and rising, she ap-
proached a small trunk in the room,
from which she took those she had in-
tended to dispose of, and brought them
to Angelo. The instant he cast his
eyes upon them he uttered a groan of
anguish, his lips quivered, he clasped
his hands together, and sinking back, he
faintly murmured "They are false !
they are false !"
" False !" cried Gabrielle, who be-
held with horror, if Angelo spoke rea-
son, her best hopes destroyed ; " False,
said you?"

"Oh! yes, yes," groaned the agonis-

Overcome by his terrible feelings, he
made a frenzied attempt to spring from
the bed, and cast himself upon the floor?

Alone, unaided, Gabrielle applied
herself to his restoration ; by degrees he

lutely exhausted, Angelo at length fell
into a sleep, deep and profound as the
sleep of the tomb.
Gabrielle seized that opportunity of
leaving the room for a moment, and
without 'quitting the house, found she
could procure for him an attendant, one
of those persons who, in offering their
services for the sick, have no other idea
than of the emolument to be thus deriv-
ed, and whose sources of livelihood are
in the misfortunes, sickness, and distress
of others. This being, Gabrielle was
however glad upon any terms to hire,
and every step she took convinced her
more and more of the necessity there ex-
isted of obtaining some speedy means of
compassing her encreased ex pences.
As the mind of Angelo could not at
this juncture be considered in a state

)
of sanity, the introduction of a stranger
into his apartment could excite noun-
pleasant feelings.
With a heavy heart, Gabrielle then
proceeded to gather together such
other ornaments as she still possessed,
and made a selection from them of those
she considered most valuable, and ca-
pable of supplying present exigencies.
Reluctantly then resigning to the care
of the attendant the still sleeping An-
gelo, she hastily departed to dispose of
them the best she could.
Unfortunately for her, however, she
discovered that the worst possible period
of attempting to obtain money, is pre-
cisely that in which it is most needed.
Those to whom she applied, easily per.
ceived, that though she wished to ob-
tain for her jewels the utmost that she

could, in default of obtaining what
she wished, she must of necessity take
what she could procure;
this was
enough, the extremity so dreadful for
her, was their harvest, and that advan-
tage was unfeelingly reaped from her
distress, which perhaps had not other-
wise been thought of; for one half of
the world lives and flourishes by the
misfortunes or follies of the other half.
Thus she was compelled to accept a
fourth part only of what she had flat-
tered herself with easily obtaining, and
returned to her chearless home with
a heavier heart than she had left it, and
her mind filled with gloomiest foreboda
ings of the future.
At length the physicians who had
been called in, either in compassion for
the evident embarrassment of her situa-
tion, or under apprehension that their

attendance and advice must ultimately
remain unpaid, informed her that they
had ascertained the malady of Angelo
to arise solely from an undue irritation
of the nerves, that it was more of the
mind than of the body, consequently
irremediable by the art of medicine, and
that they therefore could be of no fur-
ther service:
1
Such being the decision of the physi-
cians, Gabrielle was once more deter-
mined to undertake alone the charge
and restoration of Angelo; she dismissed,
therefore, the attendant she had tempo-
rarily hired, (who in daily expecta-
tion of his death had anticipated from
the anguish of Gabrielle, and her con-
sequent indifference to worldly matters,
noinconsiderable booty, of which she was
thus disappointed,) and enacted herself

tendant, and by her judicious manage-
ment and tender care had seen the hap-
piness of beholding Angelo in a gradual
state of amendment.
He recovered perfectly his reason, and
his body being so much debilitated by
sickness, he was no longer subject to
paroxysms of delirium.
In a short
time he became enabled to quit his bed
for several hours in the course of the
day, and ultimately to forsake it altoge-
ther. But this change was not produc-
ed by magic, it cost the patient perse-
vering Gabrielle infinite pain, distress
of mind, and the privation of almost
every comfort in existence; her care
was unremitting, indefatigable, she
scarcely slept by night, or rested during
the day, and intent on procuring for
Angelo every nourishment that might
restore his strength, she almost forgot to

take any for herself, and remembered to
do so only, when her failing powers in-
formed her, that in order to support him,
it was necessary she should support her-
self.
But the time was now arrived when
the sufferings of Gabrielle were to exceed
all she had hitherto experienced. Till
this period, though want had gleamed in
perspective upon them, and well slie
knew that it must approach, if some
means of keeping it at a distance were
"not devised, still want in perspective,
and immediate want, are widely different,
-for the one is only imagined, while the
other is felt; one excites' apprehension,
and the other despair."
Gabrielle had now parted with every
article of value she ipossessed ; next she
had parted with all which the most rigid

necessity did not compel her to retain,
and now having nothing more left which
might be bartered for subsistence, she
with a shudder beheld that the gaunt
fiend was rapidly approaching, and that
if exertion were not instantly made to
elude its fell grasp, soon it would over-
power them.
Yet it was not for herself that Ga-
brielle felt or shuddered; to her, death
would have been but a transition from
perpetual misery to eternal peace, she
would have hailed it with joy, em-
braced it with eagerness; but for the
sufferings of another, she had not forti-
tude to die ! all her anxiety was for
Angelo, all her indifference for her-
self.
1
As Angelo was however now so much
restored both in mind and body, he would

permit her to leave him sometimes, and
even with patience endure her absence.
Thus when Gabrielle beheld that their
means were so rapidly decreasing, and
that ere long they must completely
cease, she one day quitted him with the
resolution of not returning till she had
obtained some mean of certain subsistence,
and to shrink from nothing, not in itself
dishonourable, that might enable her yet
a little longer to support with the for-
saken Angelo the burthen of existence.
With this purpose therefore settled
in her mind, though undecided as to the
mode of pursuing it, she wandered along
the populous streets, musing as she
went, unobserved, or if observed, unno-
ticed; for her air bespoke unhappiness,
and her attire poverty, appearances not
calculated certainly to attract the plea-
sure-seeking eyes of the world. Who,

Passing a print shop, accidentally she
raised her eyes; she beheld in the win.

so placed as to strike the beholder to the
best advantage ; involuntarily she stop-
ped, for she had an exquisite taste in
drawing, which the departed Montmo-

prove, and an idea had flashed across
her mind that induced her hastily to ap-
proach the window: she inspected the
prints, and a modest sense of her own

pulse which actuated her, timidly she
entered the shop.
The cold money-getting face' of the
man within damped in an instant her
rising hopes and deranged her ideas,
she was aroused however by the com-
plaisant inquiry of what she desired,
and forcing herself by an effort to over-
come the emotion of shame, so naturally
felt by a noble mind when for the first
time it beholds itself in the novel situa-

ing countenance of the man who sells his
goods, and receives for them money, this
person's changed suddenly to the proud,
consequential, and imposing counte-
nance of the man who purchases, and
gives money; for there is a wide differ-
ence with beings of this description, be-
tween the act of receiving even the merest
trifle, and that of giving it; the first
still leaves them in the rank of the per-
son obliged, the latter places them in
the important and unusual light of hav-
ing conferred a favour.
Of these opposite positions the per-
son whom Gabrielle addressed was per-
fectly sensible; he therefore in a careless
and familiar tone replied that he had no
objection to oblige her if she was in dis-
tress, though he had already more ap-
plications than he could attend to, and
more hands than he knew how to

the difficulties of the times were great,
and that he could not undertake to pro-
mise any great consideration for the very
best style of painting.
All this the proud daughter of Mont-
morency bore, for she felt that her
pur-
pose was good: the difficulty of compas-
sing that which required to be done, al-
ways strung her energies anew; she ac-
ceded therefore to the hard terms and
mercenary stipulations of the shop-
keeper, with an anguished smile, and
returned home with employment suffici-
ent for several days.
Gabrielle was again in a novel situa-
tion, that of labouring for a livelihood;
still she acquitted herself, as hitherto
she had done, to admiration. " Oh !

late, "could'st thou look down from thy
bright abode, thou would'st not disap-
prove; this would not have vexed thy
mortal pride to heart-breaking, for in this
there is no dishonour!"
As she reflected that had she at this
juncture been reduced to absolute
want without the means of procuring
even the morrow's meal, Providence
would thus have assisted her, and ward-
ed the horrors of such a day; she felt
her heart glow with gratitude to the
throne of beneficence, and with a plea-
sure such as for long she had not expe-
rienced.
Thus are we ever the creatures of im-
mediate predicament; the circumstance
which at one time to anticipate might
have overwhelmed with despair, proves in

joicing ; events take their hue from the
moment, and are only good or bad ac-
cording to their comparative relations.
Who could have imagined that the
talentsof Gabrielle,cultivated beneath the
tender care and elegant instructions of
her father, would ever have availed her as
a mean of livelihood, or that she should
consider herself fortunate in procuring
with difficulty the opportunity of ren-
dering them "such ? Yet thus "it was,
though only a few years back she would
have viewed the bare possibility of pre-

gering belief.

rounding ills. But Angelo was incapa-
ble of emulating her, incapable even of
attempting to do so; he could only gaze
with wonder and admiration, without
being animated by a portion of her hea-
venly fire; so true it is that great minds
only can bear adversity. Gabrielle,
though thus she laboured and exerted
herself more for the benefit of the unhap-
py imbecile Angela than for herself, en-
deavoured with her genuine delicacy, to
disguise that it was absolutely for sup-
port that she did so; she worked with
cheerfulness, and sought rather to im-
press upon his mind that it was chiefly
for amusement she thus occupied her-
self.
She dreaded he should feel that he
depended upon her for subsistence,
and her superior soulshrank from weigh-
ing him down with such a sense of ober

ligation, and from a gratitude that, far
from pleasing, would have distressed and
shocked her.
But Angelo could not be for ever
thus deceived; he beheld the incessant
toil of this noble but unfortunate being;
he beheld too that it was for him she
toiled; the sense of his own unworthi-
ness pressed heavy on his heart, and
while it filled him with a profound me-
lancholy, still further incapacitated him
from what he would have considered a
fruitless exertion to cope with or join
his efforts to hers.
Often would he gaze upon the down-
cast, pale, and fading countenance, 'to
which the gay flower she was painting
and decking with all the animation of
nature, formed, as it bloomed beneath
her hand, a garish contrast. Often

would lie consider that while calling into
artificial life by the magic of her pencil
the frailest productions of nature, she
was herself withering fast into real de-
cay, perishing while she bade them
bloom. Often then would he burst in-
voluntarily into a passion of tears, throw
himself at her feet, seize her wan
hands, kiss them, and regard her with
an anguish that defied the power of
words.
In the mean time, however, the most
active exertions could not balance her
expences: as Angelo appeared still de
elining, she could not resist the desire of
procuring for him every delicacy that
she conceived likely to tempt or allure
his sickly appetite, and though she lived.

more and more inadequate, for though
a miser, she was such to herself alone.
One evening that she was as usual bu-
sily employed, she felt a sudden weakness
coming over her, her eyes grew dim, her
head giddy, her trembling fingers relax-
ed their hold of the pencil, and unable to
conquer the overpowering sensation, she
sunk back in her chair.
Angelo, terrified, flew to her assist-
ance; she made an effort, and with a lamin
guid smile entreated him not to be
alarmed; scarce had she uttered the
words,' ere her heavy head, in which a
thousand bells seemed jingling, dropped
upon his shoulder, and her senses fled.

temples and cold hands, shed over her
torrents of tears, and in bitter anguish
accused himself of having murdered the
. most angelic being upon earth; but had
he known the true cause of Gabrielle's
indisposition, what then would have been
his sensations, what his self-reproaches ?
The truth was, that intent as usual upon
Angelo, and regardless of herself, she had
expended almost the whole of the trifling
sum she had in the morning obtained, in
the purchase of a delicacy of which she
knew Angelo to be extremely fond; it was
however expensive as it was rare, and
Gabrielle determined not to partake of
it, that the gratification might be' pro-
longed to Angelo.
Yet howevade his earnest persuasions?
Theidea suggested itself of affecting that
she had taken refreshment while abroad,
and was incapable of accepting more,

though at the same time nothing had
been further from her intentions, as such
she would have deemed wanton expen-
diture, after having already gone far be-
yond what her slender means might au-
thorize ; and she promised herself that
she should find no inconvenience in dis-
pensing with an occasional meal, as long
as by so doing she could procure some
indulgences for Angelo.
But Gabrielle, neither apprehending,
nor respecting the delicacy of her nature,
acted more in conformity to its spirit
than to its strength. In considering only
the first, she over rated the last, and from
dispensing in the commencement with
one meal less a day, and sensible of no
immediate injury, she next dispensed
with two, and ultimately often with
any. This was one of those days, on
which she had not tasted food, and had

been without from an early hour on the
day preceding. She had walked, ex .
erted herself, added by various ef-
forts to her exhaustion, and had ventured
without allowing herself the smallest re-
freshment, to resume, as soon as other
cares had been completed, her occupa-
tion. Nature however was no longer ca-
pable of enduring such cruel imposition,
and sunk beneath theextraordinary efforts
she required from it.
When by degrees she recovered from
her swoon, she became sensible of the
cause that had induced it, and yielded to
the entreaties of Angelo that she would
take a little of the wine she had procur-
ed for him, which was one of those
luxuries she still persisted in obtaining
for him, and ever as resolutely refused
to partake of. For the present however
she consented to relax in a slight degree

the severity of her laws against herself,
and, as Angelo supported her in his arms,
accepted froin his hand a small portion
of the wine, which considerably revived
her, and she became enabled to rise from
the bed, but still so much enfeebled
as to be under the necessity of abstaining
more reluctantly from her employment,
though she was sufficiently imprudent to
hazard the attempt.

From this period Gabrielle grew daily
worse, yet determined to persevere till the
power of doing so should utterly for-
sake her. She disregarded the strong and
faithful warnings of nature, which on
every exertion, however trifling, appeared
on the point of being over powered, and
still pressed and goaded it beyond its
capability of endurance. She felt a ra-
pid internal waste, her strength failing,
and every indubitablesymptom of hasten-
ing decay.
The origin of her malady was certain. .

had communicated to her body in an
alarming degree; the least movement
fatigued her, to bend over her employ-

ing to suffocation, to walk was an effort
carcelyendurable, and her only moments
of comparative ease were when for a
few hours she allowed herself in a re-
cumbent posture to seek the benefit of
repose.
She now became so extremely feeble,
and was so frequently obliged to inter-
mit her occupation, that she clearly per-
ceived she must speedily relinquish it
altogether. On this subject however
she was spared consideration; for having
one morning, with infinite pain, dragged
her weary limbs as far as the residence
of her employer, for the purpose of con-
veying home the fruits of her labour ;

them from her, looked coldly in her lan-
guid countenance, and carelessly observ-

this cruel remark, shrank back, yet ti-

the man, in answer to her observa-
tion, "all I know is, you work too slow
for me, and I can't pay you above half
price any longer."
: Gabrielle answered not, for though

she despised the brutality of the man,
she easily perceived that remonstrance
must be lost upon him, and that he was
one of those vilely selfish beings who
have no other idea than that of traffick-
ing with distress, and think all fair that
may be reaped from the urgent necessi-
ties of the unfortunate: she did not
therefore notice his insinuation, for well
she knew the pain and labour which it
cost her to compleat what she did for
the miserable consideration which she
received; to have performed it for any
thing beneath that, much less half, as
this being had intimated, would, she felt,
have been absolutely useless. Stretch-
ing forth her fair hand therefore, she
accepted the wretched pittance, which
was her due, and without deigning to
utter a syllable, left the shop.
Now was her situation indeed dread.

overtake them, that nothing could delay
its rapid strides ; she entered their sad
abode with tottering steps, and a heavy
heart, almost incapable of further ex-
ertion, had she even retained her em-
ployment.
Angelo was dismayed at her appear-
ance ; she looked the chill image of
breathing death, or like some shadowy
phantom bearing the false semblance of
life and reality.
In tender accents he enquired the
cause of her seeminganguish; for though
her pallid aspect was familiar to him,
there was an expression of distress in it
at present, such as, owing to her perpe-
tual exertions to appear cheerful in his
presence, he had not for long so evident-
ly perceived.

Her fortitude half succumbing at the
sad prospect she now anticipated for An-
gelo, she looked in his face with the wish
to smile, but burst into tears.
"Ah, tell me, beloved Gabrielle, what
has happened !" exclaimed Angelo.
Nothing, nothing, poor Angelo;
nothing has happened, but the time is
at length arrived--we must starve toge-
ther!"
Angelo, who had scarcely during this
period of distress experienced aught
which could be termed privation, and
whose mind therefore could not be like
Gabrielle's, familiarised to the idea of
want, remained for a moment stupified
with horror at her words, and the man
ner in which she had uttered them.

tude of Gabrielle, could not reason like,
nor think with her; life, however bitter,
was preferable in his estimation to death,
the idea of which, as usually to weak
minds it is, was terrible to him, viewed
with repugnance and dismay. He cast
himself in despair upon the ground,
and could offer no consolation to her
who had so long veiled from his eyes,
though fully revealed to her own, the pic-
ture ofhorror now displayed before them.
Oppressed by the strong power of ima-

death upon him, and again were the
waning powers of the hapless Gabrielle

better thoughts.

without shrinking the scene before him.
He beheld indeed that the best hope
now was, death bringing a speedy termi-
nation of their remediless woes; it was
death in its apprehension, rather than the
settled thought of death, which appalled
him; it was its slow approach which he
dreadedthe
pang of seeing it advance,
that he wished to be spared, and he prayed
in his heart that it might overtake him
suddenly, and without warning, or that
in unconscious slumber, his trembling
soul might pass into eternity.

wretched pair, when not only their
means of procuring further subsistence
were totally at an end, but when they

horror for Angeloto Gabrielle, of pious
resignation, firm hope, and blissful anti-
cipation of a future, better state.

mariner in the storm, who to the last
moment indulges hope, nor amid the
crashing wreck resigns it, till dismayed
he sees rushing towards him the moun-
tainous surge which must envelop him in
its fathomless bosom. So till this day,
vainly, weakly and unreasonably, had
Angelo indulged the fond hope of some
unforeseen event, some blest occurrence
to turn the tide of fate, and preserve
him from the catastrophe, so dreadful
and incredible to his mind, of perishing
from want.

at each other in silence--night followed,
and as the darkness spread around them,
Angelo started from the fixed attitude
of despair in which he had been gazing
on Gabrielle, and clasping his hands
together, exclaimed, "Now indeed have
I lost all hope, the crisis of our fate
rapidly approaches, God enable us to
meet it with courage;" then in a deep
gloomy voice he pursued, " Gabrielle,

"Come then, my dear friend," cried
Gabrielle, "so be it; for myself, I will

praying of the Almighty to judge it with
mercy."
Angelo threw himself at her feet, he
laid his head upon her lap, and covered
his eyes with her hand, as if desirous
to shut out for ever all earthly objects,
and be spared the pang of death.
Soon as he wished, deep sleep over-
powered him.
The apartment was
in gloomy darkness--yet the inspir-
ed soul of Gabrielle saw lighther
thoughts ascended to eternity, and re-
velled in the infinity of space. In the
heaven of heavens she fancied she beheld
her father, that he looked down smiling
upon her, and with outstretched arms,
and in a voice which seemed to her rapt

there, for of myself I have not power to
move."
Angelo, who was somewhat refreshed
by sleep, bore the enfeebled Gabrielle
in his arms to the bed, and seated him-
self beside her. This day the sun shone
upon them, but its splendour was mock-
ery; Gabrielle gazed not on it through
humility, for she wished not that its
cheering beams should exhilarate her.

soul, or recall her to earthly pleasure,
while Angelo closed his eyes upon the
brilliant visitant in the bitterness of an
impatient despair.
Hour after hour rolled on; the dusk
of evening again advanced, a sense of
pain from long abstinence began to be
acutely felt; their sufferings by th ost
terrible of deaths were necessarily pro-
tracted, and gradually increased, while
their termination was contemplated, by
the one with an invincible fortitude, by
the other with sensations of an indescri-
bable horror that amounted almost to
madness !
The light was now such that they
could merely distinguish each other.
Gabrielle in a faint voice murmured to
Angelo, to raise her head from the pil-
low. Trembling with anguish and alarn,

he obeyed, conceiving from the tone of
her voice that her last moments were ap-
proaching. He supported her in his
arms, shie rested her head upon his
shoulder, and gazed on him, though
without speaking, with a grateful placid
smile. She laid her spread hand upon
her heart, her eyes of celestial blue
were raised upwards with an animated
expression, her countenance was that of
a saint inspired with a holy fervour, while
her soul seemed gently passing like a
breath from earth to heaven !
Angelo looked upon her with the
wild aspect of moody terrible despair,
on perceiving that he must still survive,
yet with an anxious wish that her fleet-
ing breath might be delayed till his
might mingle with it, and their souls
together pass the threshold of mortal
life ; for he dreaded the thought of dy-

ing as it were unprotected in his last
moments, so tremblingly did he hang on
Gabrielle, even in death.
While thus they remained in each
other's arms, a slight noise was heard at
their door. Gabrielle, whose thoughts
had already parted from earth, wish-
ed not that they should be recalled to it;
she desired to die; and to return to life
and to the world, would have been a
painful effort; she heeded not there-
fore the noise, either by look or move-
ment.
Mean time it was repeated, but with
increased violence. Angelo started in-
voluntarily; it continued still louder,
for their door had been secured, that no
one might intrude upon or witness their
anguish and distress. The attention of
Gabrielle was dragged again to earth,

she made a faint movement, Angelo laid
her head gently upon the pillow, and
fast as his debilitated limbs would al-
low, approached the door, opened it, and
in a voice almost inarticulate from pas-
sion struggling with weakness, he cried,
Who dare intrude here! and interrupt
our last moments !" at the same time
staring wildly upon the intruder, and
holding the door in his hand, as if un-
willing he should enter.

called itself to the mind of Angelo, "I
perceive you know me not; I have, how-
ever, letters and papers of consequence
for you, which I could deliver into your
hands alone: with the utmost difficulty,
after having been several days in search
of
you, I have been so fortunate as to
trace you; and if I judgearight, you will

Angelo now perfectly recognised the
voice of an old associate, but his travelled
heart shrunk from contact with him,
and in faltering accents he replied, his
native pride still. operating, " This is
no place for you, it is the chamber of
misery, of death!--I will dispense with
your entrance, you can have no papers,
no letters that nowconcern me."
" Pardon me," returned Fitzarden,
"and allow me a word only, to convince
you to the contrary. Ellesmere is no more,

duel from his most intimate friend, who
had attempted to seduce his mistress: no

had before related to me, he confessed
that in that awful moment he felt the
bitterest reinorse, from the reflection of
having, as he feared, completely ruined
you, since you had suddenly vanished,
no one knew whither; and that he could
not die easy, unless he made you restitu-
tion of the whole of what he had obtain-
ed from you on that memorable night,
and at every former period. "Promise
mne, Fitzarden," he added, "that
you
will
not neglect my dying request, that you
will not rest till you have discovered his
retreat, and re-instated him in the full
possession of his own." I faithfully
promised; he lived to see the requisite
instrument executed, which was to con-
firm
you in the possession of your right,
and then expired in comparative tran-
quillitythough deeply deploring his
manifold errors, yet in the hope that he
had retrieved at least the effects of one
most baleful." Fitzarden concluded;

Angelo endeavoured to speak, hope had
dawned upon his soul, and with it had
returned, more strongly than ever, the
desire of life.
The attempt, however, that he had
made to speak, from the confusion of
ideas that pressed upon his mind, and
his extreme debility, overpowered him.
He staggered towards the bed, where
the silent Gabrielle still lay; he essayed
to express himself to her, but could not;
the words evaporated in a hollow mur-
mur, and he sunk exhausted on the bed.
Fitzarden, now considerably alarmed,
called aloud for lights and some assistance.
Angelo was presently restored, though
appearing in a state of the utmost debili-
ty; but for the unhappy Gabrielle, her
last hour seemed to have arrived, and it
was considered almost a forlorn hope

to summon the immediate aid of a phy-
sician.
Without making enquiry, the situa-
tion of his former gay companion was
sufficiently evident; to Fitzarden; he
clearly perceived that he was reduced to
the most abject distress, and as he cast
his eyes around the cold desolate a part-
ment, he could not avoid contrasting
it in his mind with the sumptuous dwell-
ings in which formerly he had been ac-
customed to behold him. The view of
the dreadful change produced by a fa-
tal indiscretion, struck a salutary terror
to the heart of the young man, and he
started to reflect that his own habits
were at this period such precisely as
D'Albini's had long been: thus reverts
ing to self, and what might be his own
fate, he felt his commiseration in -

crease for the unhappy beings before
him.
: A physician now arrived, and was
conducted instantly to Gabrielle; he felt
her pulse, looked in her death-like
countenance, on which the finger of
want had imprinted traces deep as those
of sorrow, and pronounced with an
unusual delicacy and sincerity, that her
malady was the result of intense ex-
haustion, and that nourishment, not
medicine, was alone capable of restoring
her..
At this declaration, however compas-
sionately veiled, that the tender and an-
gelic Gabrielle was expiring from want,
Angelo, unable to restrain his acute emo-
tion, burst into tears. Such was the an-
guish of his feelings, that but for im-
mediate assistance he would have supk

into a state worse far than that from
which he had just been recovered.
Despair and eternal repining had
made on his countenance a havoc al-
most equal to that which want and
hidden anguish had made in that of Ga-
brielle; and again as Fitzarden pressed
him to take some wine, he gazed upon
his sunken cheeks, and hollow eyes, and
could not avoid remembering the gay
hours when, glowing in the bloom of
health and careless vivacity, they had
pledged each other in repeated goblets,
not, as now, to restore exhausted nature,
but to sink it rather in enfeebling sen-
suality, or, plunging into the vice of
prodigal excess, to fit themselves for
pursuits that sober reason could not
have tolerated.

been administered to Gabrielle, she once
more opened on the light her faintly
beaming eyes.-Angelo supported her
in his trembling arms; while Fitzarden,
in whose soul the scene before him
awakened feelings which he was un-
conscious of possessing, and whose mind
was impressed with the most delicate
respect for Gabrielle, joined his entrea-
ties to those of Angelo, and earnestly
besought her to take some nourish-
ment.
Gabrielle found herself compelled to
yield ; the cup of existence was again
presented to her lips, she wished not to
taste of it, for her sad mind foreboded
that as heretofore the sweets that it
might contain, would bear no propor-
tion to the bitter with which they would
be mingled; yet to repel life was equal
to the crime of seeking death ; she re-

membered that she was the creature of
her Creator, and as her piety had given
her the resignation to die, it now in-
spired her with the fortitude to live.
She recovered by degrees; with her
Angelo recovered likewise, for he saw
that for this time he should be spared
the remorse of beholding her die for
him. His was not a mind to antici-
pate distant events, neither to dive deep-
ly into remote origins, or causes ; the
simple position of not having to accuse
himself at this juncture of the death of
her who had sacrificed so much for him,
who had famished that he might feast-
to be spared a reflection so bitter, so
accusing, was of itself sufficient to ex-
hilarate his soul, while the idea, then
shining forth in added lustre, of his fair
future prospects, conveyed a feeling of
renovated bliss. Fitzarden would not

211
leave them till he beheld them in a
state widely different from that in which
he had found them; Angelo, ever easily
depressed, now animated to a pitch of
extravagance, while a feeling of plea-
sure at his joy, chastened by her stronger
reason, shone through the lovely mind of
Gabrielle, as the mild light of the soul,
or like a tempered sun-beam diffusing
around a soft and tender brilliancy.
Fitzarden promised to return on the fol-
lowing day, but previous to his visiting
them, to arrange for their reception an
abode somewhat different to that whichi
they at present occupied.
" But was not this good enough to
die in!" observed Gabrielle to Fitzar-
den, as he rose to depart.
" I know not that," answered Fitz-
arden, who involuntarily gazed on her

with admiration; " for such a being as
you it was not even good enough to die
in; yet indeed," added he, " virtues like
yours are of themselves independent,
requiring neither living pomp nor mau-
soleum !"
" Who talks of death!" cried Angelo,
with a laugh, it must be life, be-
loved Gabrielle, long and happy life,
for both you and me!"
The feeling's of Gabrielle told her a
less flattering tale, but she faintly smil-
ed in compliment to the wild hopes of
the sanguine Angelo.

CHAPTER XXIV.
A few days now beheld them rein-
stated in all their former comforts, such
at least as depended upon ease and afflu-
ence alone : but while other subse-
quent sufferings had diminished in the
mind of Angelo the feeling of deep
sorrow for the loss of a son, and then
again by an unexpected deliverance from
those sufferings, made him almost for-
get the evil in the good, the heart of the
sensible Gabrielle fondly yearned after
her children, in anxious conjecture of
their fate, and in the eager desire to be-
hold them ere she died; for sadly she:
## p. 214 (#234) ############################################
214
THE LIBERTINE.
foreboded that if this period did not soon
arrive, speedily must she resign the lin-
gering hope.
And well and truly did she forebode;
that tender and susceptible soul had re-
ceived a cureless wound, which time
might aggravate indeed, but which it
was powerless to heal. Great and ter-
rible, even from early youth, had been
her sufferings, almost unintermitting;
one misfortune had been succeeded by
another, and each more dreadful than
the last. Those blows which render
some hearts callous from their frequen-
cy, had lacerated her's beyond recovery;
yet it was not that she wanted firmness
to repel, but she had likewise sensibility
acutely to feel.
Such, such on a virtuous, delicate,
and sensible mind, are the consequences

THE LIBERTINE.
215
of early error, deeply, unceasingly, yet
unavailingly deplored.
Now that Angelo was restored to the
rank he had formerly held in society, he
determined to renew to Gabrielle the
offer of his hand; for his vices were in
consequence of the weakness of his
heart, and not of its depravityof the
insufficiency of his reason to direct him
right, and not of his desire to do ill. He
reverted therefore with complacency to
the idea of making Gabrielle his wife,
and with that pleasure which never fails
to accompany in a mind not utterly de-
praved the desire of retrieving in some
degree the faults that have been com-
mitted, he felt, with becoming emotion,
how little was this late and insufficient
compliment calculated to recompense
in the thousandth part, the conduct she
had pursued towards him.
## p. 216 (#236) ############################################
216 THE LIBERTINE.
He seized therefore the earliest opa
portunity of fulfilling his intention, and
in justice to him be it said, with a fal-
tering and confusion resulting from the
consciousness of how much earlier he
should have made the tender of that
name and title, she had ever equally as
now deserved.
" When I was young and foolish,
Gabrielle," said he, I knew not your
worth; Ioutraged, injured, and insulted
you : when I became beggared in for
tune as in happiness, I felt a wretch so
wholly unworthy of you, that to have
then pressed upon you the offer of my
hand, would have merited that you
should reject it with contempt; but now
that I am no longer in adversity, though
bettered by the lessons it has taught me,
and capable from the point of view in
which it has revealed your excellencies

217
of appreciating, though not yet equal
to your merit, the heavenly treasure I
possess in you; now if you will suffer
me by repentance and future care to ex-
piate in a slight degree my past errors
towards you, then, beloved Gabrielle, will
you give me but one more proof of the
superiority of your nature, even in that
difficult task, the forgiveness and obli-
vion of injury.
Gabrielle gave
her hand to Angelo in
token of acquiescence : confused ideas
pressed upon her mind, she wished
not to damp his animation, nor the
hope which sparkled in his eyes, fondly
bent upon her, by giving them utter-
ance; therefore looking with kindness
on him, she remained silent, while she
admitted without pain to her mind the
conviction that long she should not live
to possess by name, what in a su-

perior degree she had ever been in cha-
racter.
Angelo was permitted to fix an early day
for the ceremony of rendering Gabrielle
his wife; he desired to invite the whole of
his friends ( so esteemed) resident in Eng-
land, to witness what he termed the cele-
bration of his day of triumph ; but from
this public display the pride and delica-
cy of Gabrielle shrunk repugnant, know-
ing too well that it would be considered
by others the day of her triumph! It
was enough for her to receive in secret
thetardy avowalof her merits; the morti-
fication of having been so long unappre-
ciated, or deemed unworthy,and ofaccept-
ing at length what had been ever due to
her, was by her deemed no proud triumph;
to be exhibited before idle witnesses,
who could neither feel nor understand,
none either, but the contrary. In secret

had been her sufferings, her injuries, and
indignities; of the atonement which
it was proposed to make for thein she
had her own sentiments, and she deter-
mined that secret too should be her ac-
ceptance of it.
The day now drew nigh on which the
marriage was fixed to take place. Gabri-
elle, still languid, feeble, and becoming
daily more exhausted, reclined upon a
couch from morning until night, and
on the arrival of the day, she was so
ill as to be incapable of the least exer-
tion.
Angelo with his usual impatience was
wild at the idea of being under the
necessity of postponing the ceremony,
which Gabrielle no sooner perceived than
in order to tranquillize him, she declared
her determination that no indisposition

!
on her part should retard it.It took
place accordingly; she received his
vows and gave him hers in return; and
Angelo, as he embraced, and hailed her
by the name of wife, experienced a feli-
city purer and more extatic than ever
had been afforded him by the highest
gratification of meretricious passion.
Such is the power of virtue over the
heart, that even a long course of vice
will not render us wholly invulnerable to
its divine influence ; yet if indeed there
be a human being so far sunk in depra-
vity, as to prove an exception to thi
remark, lamentable indeed must be his
state.

But the performance of a sacred cere-
mony had no power to call back to Ga-
brielle her departed health ; it had no
more power over her weakened body

221
than over her towering mind her ; fear-
ful malady continued to increase, and she
appeared but as a fair anatomy, the sha-
dow of her former self. Angelo, who
perceived that of all his worldly friend-
ships Gabrielle had alone remained
by him in the hour of adversity, viewed
her at length as she had always merit-
ed to be viewed, and could not con-
template the possibility of losing her,
without feelings little short of distrac->
tion.
Now as the prospect of her danger
increased, his anguish and his fears in-
creased likewise ; he ransacked the king-
dom for advice, he collected around
him a host of doctors : all proved vain;
and in despair of the power of medicine,
he yielded with the eagerness of a last
hope to the counsel which directed him
to convey her from the dense atmosphere

The patient uncomplaining Gabrielle,
who took without a murmur the vain
medicines which the terrified solicitude
of Angelo pressed upon her, who listen-
ed with a placid and resigned smile to
all that was proposed, who yielded with
the softness of an angel to every scheme
suggested for her amusement, or the re-
novation of her health, acceded without
a word of opposition, and without a
thought of hope, to the present entreaty
of Angelo, that she would at least con-
sent to try the effect of a purer air.
As if he had obtained a certainty of
prolonging her life, of restoring her
from wasting sickness to bloomy health,
he seized her acquiescence on the instant,
as fearful she should retract, and by the

eager impatience which he evinced in
preparing for the journey, if he distress-
ed and incommoded the enfeebled Ga-
brielle, he at the same time conveyed to
her mind the reflection that she was now
more than ever dear to him ; though why
she was so, she wished not to dissipate
the pleasing delusion by inquiring.
In the highest human mind, self-love
will a little operate ; true, the conviction
could not restore her drooping health,
but it spared her the pang of witnessing
in the last stages of her existence a root-
ed heart-breaking indifference to her
fate.
With Angelo, to decide and to act
was the same thing; he immediately left
London, and by easy stages arrived in
Devonshire, there hiring a beautiful
cottage which commanded an uninter-,

on this spot would be crowned with
success; expressing himself to her with
his wonted animation, he exclaimed,
gently seizing her in his arms,"
my love, come, recover your bloom! you
must--and the brilliancy of those eyes;
smile upon me, and let me see that al-
ready you feel yourself growing better !!
- Come,
As if in obedience to his wish the pale
countenance of Gabrielle became suf-
fused with a faint hectic blush, and un-
willing to damp the animation of Angelo,
she said, " I do, AngeloI do feel
growing better," she smiled too, but her

smile was hopeless, and the momentary
fire which sparkled in her eyes, was in
the blest anticipation that she would be
better, not in this world but in a future
state.
Several weeks she lingered, at the
earnest wish of Angelo, in this lovely
abode. It was the close of spring, and if
hope of health could be conveyed to
the sick soul bending to the tomb,
this was the season to inspire it; or if :
life could be breathed into the cold
form of death, this too was the season
in which the miracle would have seem-
ed less ; but amidst all this, amidst its
mild verdure and budding beauty, the
heart of Gabrielle was incapable of being
elated, it was still calm, still patient
and resigned, for she felt that no second
spring could it ever be her lot to be-
hold!

One evening when for the time of year
it was uncominonly, but not oppres-
sively warm, Angelo prevailed on her to
sit without the door of their cottage,
and inhale the refreshing breezes from
the sea; she as usual acquiesced, he led
her forth, and debility compelled her
immediately to sit upon the rustic bench
which had been placed for her accommo-
dation. She leaned back, and Angelo,
with his arm round her waist, tenderly
supported. lier of whom now he felt
alnost the full value.
Nothing could be more beautiful than,
the prospect before them; it was nature,
not in her most fantastic or magnificent
attire, but in her simple, lovely and most
interesting garb ! she was not as a fierce
and sovereign mistress decked in her
robes of state, and awing by her frowns,
but as a gentle maid, wooing and irresis-

tibly winning admiration by her dim-
pled smiles. Gradually sloping hills,
dales, and blooming valleys, charmed
without confusing the senses, pleased
without fatiguing the eye; before them
the green expanded bosom of the sea
seemed swelling in soft acclivity, and as
if respectful to the sun beams glittering
upon it, (making it a sheet of liquid ra-
diance,) only gently smiled, and undu-
lated, sending to the shore at intervals its
low rushing waves, that in hollow mur-
murs seemed to speak their gratitude,
Gabrielle sat for a while silent, her
dim shining eyes fixed on the prospect
before her; mournful, yet not unpleasing
ideas crouded on her mindshe shed a
few tears, but they were not tears of an-

She paused for a moment, then added in
a voice, low yet firm, " Angelo! never
more on this earth shall I behold the
glory of the setting sun!"
My beloved," cried Angelo turning
pale, and half fearful that her senses
were forsaking her, or that her language
was ominous of approaching death, "my
beloved, talk not thus, nor let so fair
an evening inspire you with melancholy

The voice of Gabrielle, sweetly so-
lemn, sunk in the heart of Angelo,
but it deprived him of hope, and hegaz-
ed upon her with tearful eyes. It was
getting dim twilight; to his inspired
fancy, she appeared as an embodied
spirit ! he dared not even take her hand,
such was the sacred awe of his feelings,
and though her words rived him with
anguish, he waited in hallowed silence
for what further her aspiring soul should
dictate to her lips!

She resumed: "You are silent, Angelo;

prosecution of my last desire !"
"Oh, Gabrielle!" cried Angelo sink-
ing on his knees before her, "beloved of
my soul, talk not thus, I implore you, of
your last desire! of quitting me at this
moment, when you are more dear to me,
more valued than at any former period
of my past life! Oh! no, I will not pro-

upon her knees beside him, and joining
his hands together, held them in he.'s.

" Now swear !" she cried,

attend to what I have required of you!

tenement of clay, will struggle in agony
for mortal life! and e'en when parting
hence, will still be steeped in anguish,

" God! I thank thee!" cried Gabri-
elle, extending her fair arms to heaven,
and looking upwards with a smile of en-
thusiastic gratitude; then kissing the
forehead of her husband, she added,
"Raise me, dear friend, and lead me into
the house."

Angelo obeyed, but rather carried
than led her light emaciated form into
the house; she retired early to bed, and
slept with composure during the night.
On the following morning Angelo
entered her chamber ; she was sitting up
in her bed, supported by pillows; the

mine, shone brightly into her apart-
ment, and with singular pleasure was

she regarding alternately its chequered
beams upon the floor, and the fair pros-
pect without, while a variety of birds
gaily singing and joining in concert
their small melodious throats, seemed
striving at once to inspire her with joy and
hope, and to serenade the rising morn!
Poor Gabrielle was gazing with that
melancholy anxious look that evinced
her consciousness it was for the last time
she did so; and this feeling, whether in-
spired by the anticipation of death, or
absence, ever gives an indescribable
charm to the most trivial surrounding
objects. . Angelo approached her bed-
side, and tenderly enquired how she
felt.
" Well!" replied she, " calm, easy,
just as I wish to feel !" A pang struck
the heart of Angelo 'at the peculiar ex-

tered this; but endeavouring to conceal
his feelings, he said in a gay tone, "Since
you have awakened so early, Gabrielle,
you may as well enjoy the fresh morn-
ing breeze."
"I would with pleasure," she an-
swered, "but I feel too feeble; and per-
haps if I could, it might be wrongfor
it might give me a longing to inhale it
again!"
"A longing that you might easily
gratify, my love," interrupted Angelo.
" No, Angelo! I have seen the sun
riseI shall never see it rise again, nor
shall I behold it set !" She reclined her
head upon the pillow, and remained si-
lent, while Angelo turned to the win-
dow to hide his g'ushing tears:presently,

from her gentle and regular breathings,
he believed that she had fallen into a
slumber; he gently approached the bed,
and perceiving that her eyes were closed,
sat down beside her. :
She
slept for about an hour, but not
composedly; her countenance frequently
changed, her muscles now and then
worked with a tremulous motion, and a
cold dew broke out upon her fore-
head.
Suddenly she started and awoke, as in
trepidation and horror! she gazed with
a wild bewildered air around, seeming
anxious to collect her scattered thoughts,
and recover from her strange confusion !
Angelo, infinitely alarmed, took her hand;
at this she started anew, made an effort
to speak, and gazed on him with a look
of patient anguish on finding she could

his, and now relaxed their holdnow a
thin film gathered over her eyes, and
now with a wild vacancy involuntarily
they opened wide! now the colour fled
from her lips, rushed back for a moment,
then forsook them altogether! Her
breathing became short and irregular,
and the terrified Angelo laying his
hand upon her heart, found its pulsa-
tions to tally with it. He instantly
dispatched some attendants for the phy-
sician, who daily and vainly had visit-
ed her, and the moments passed in wait-
ing for his arrival were past in anxious
trepidation by Angelo,

she could not speak, but her fixed and

an expression, such as convinced him

something that she wished to say to
him.
The physician at length arrived; no
sooner did he behold her than, turning
to Angelo, he whispered, "I cannot
give you hope! her last moments are ap-
proaching." He drew near the bed-side
of Gabrielle, and raising her head he
poured into her mouth a few drops of a
restorative quality. Gabrielle faintly
struggled, an effort of nature aided the

Angelo had not words, he looked on

to his mind the terrible truth that she
was gone for ever! He continued gazing
on her cold body with a mingled sen-
sation of agony, despair, and stupefac-
tion!---at length he turned
away
his
eyes, as if to convince himself that they
had deluded him only with a frightful
vision, and that when again he looked
upon her, he should behold her breathe!
but as he turned, he encountered the so-
lemn looks of the physician, who, think-
ing that he read in the countenance of
Angelo something like an expression of
doubt, uttered the slow and dreadful
sentence- All is indeed over!"

ward the door, with intent to seek some
weapon of destruction, he was opposed
by those around, when in the wildest
fury he beat his breast, tore off his hair,
and as if determined on death, dashed
himself upon the floor, shrieking forth in
bitter cries the name of Gabrielle !
Then suddenly breaking from those who
held him, he sprang to the bed, fran-
ticly he embraced the inanimate form,
sacredly beautiful in death! he called
upon her in a frenzy of agony, till los-
ing all command over his voice, it wan-
dered into a latitude of horror scarcely
human! His senses failed him, and the

to resist, desired that he should be im-
mediately conveyed to bed, and for that
purpose was he raised from the body of
Gabrielle.
At this movement his paroxysms re-
turned, he struggled like a maniac, now
crying aloud that he would die beside
her, now piteously entreating that he
might be permitted ! but nature could
endure no more, he became again over-
powered, and sinking into insensibility,
was borne from the spot.

knees by her silent corpse, he would fling
his arms around it, hiding his face upon
the covering which overspread her.
At length it became necessary to rouse
the wretched Angelo from the profound
indulgence of a grief unmixed with other
thoughts, by harrowing intimations re-
specting the funeral of her he mourned.
At first, on this dreadful subject he could
not listen, and such was the effect it
produced on him, it was thought impru-
dent at that juncture to pursue it; but it
was requisite that it should be again
revived, and, in anguish of heart inex-
pressible, was he compelled to give such
directions as he could, that the body

for herself, but in patient acquiescence to
the desires of others, the gentle Gabrielle
had gone for the renewalof health, was she
removed a corpse, conveyed again to
that which she had quitted, and interred
with funeral pomp in the same vault
where long had peacefully slept the pa;

daughter to their bosoms, who honoured

had been admired; for it was not in na-

to her singular perfections. Thus, though
it could not be said that a weeping mul-

who did, shed over it the tear of heart-
felt sorrow, the tear which most her ho-
vering spirit prized.

Angelo, forlorn, despairing, heartsick,
considering himself a bankrupt in every
happiness that life could now afford, re-
fused, when the cold remains of her he
had at length truly loved and appreciat-
ed far as his nature was capable, were
laid in the earth, refused for many days
to be seen of any one; and when at length
the intrusive officiousness of friendship
(so termed, but which is in reality only
the impatience of the vain and weak at
sorrows, which, incapable of alleviating,
they consider it a tax to behold) compel-
led him from his cherished solitude, he
appeared for a short time again among
them, but with a melancholy and reluc-
tance that soon rendered his society un-
sought by the many, and unprized even
by the few; for the world can grieve
only for personal misfortune, and fly
from miseries not their own.

Solitude for a tune was the only balin
which the heart of Angelo did not reject;
there he could bring before him the
fair image of Gabrielle, when first in
"he blooin of youthi and innocence he had
beheld her; next, as in Italy, when in the
habit of a youth, she had hovered near
him unknown, his guardian angel.--Now
forsaken, dying, he beheld her a desolate
wanderer, perishing in the streets of ano-
ther land; then raising for a while her
languid head, but drooping it soon, never
more to revive; now her wasted form glid-
ed before him, with accusing air, and
now stretched on the bed of death no
to arise, he beheld the meek
devoted victim of his perfidy and crime.
Thus the remorseful Angelo passed
liis hours, till, as his grief became less
powerful, his mind of itself looked
out for consolation ; he yet sought it
not in society, he sought it not in a repew-

al of his former habits, he sought it not
in gaiety or amusement; and , when
again he opened his lattice on the
world, the remembrance of past scenes
rushed so forcibly on his mind, that he
fed it in a paroxysm of renewed grief.
The house where Gabrielle had resided,
it distracted him to enter; the country
where she died, had inspired him with un-
ceasing horror; the streets through which
her sad remains had passed, wore the air
of depopulation ; he felt an oppressive
gloom over his soul, if by chance he ap+
proached them; without her who was
departed, all England appeared in his
eyes but a frightful wilderness, or the sad
mausoleum, of her whom it entombed.
Unable to rest, he determined on quita
ting it altogether, and, the last injunctions
of Gabrielle being ever present to his
mind, to bend his course towards Italy,
in the faint hope that chance perhaps

might furnish' him with some tiding's
of the fate of one, if not both his chil-
dren;' or, at all events, in his present
absolute uncertainty, it was a spot as
justly calculated as any other to au-
thorise such a hope, and might claim the
preference of being first explored.
In pursuance of this idea, and deriving
a melancholy pleasure from the reflection
that he was now on the point of obeying
the dearest wishes of his departed wife,
and of performing to her sacred memory
the promise he had made, he hastily ar-
ranged every requisite previous to his
departure, and taking leave of Fitzarden,
and a few only whom he esteemed his
friends, he embarked for Calais, having
so far varied the commencement of his
route as to resolve on passing through
Paris, previous to visiting Italy; con-
ceiving that by so doing, instead of

crossing a barren space of the Mediter-
ranean, he multiplied his chances of in-
formation upon a subject now the nearest
to his heart.
He soon arrived at this hot-bed of fri-
volity, vice, and unmeaning profligacy,
where, as he had been before, and made
a host of acquaintances, he was presently
surrounded, and forcibly dragged into a
vortex of dissipation. At first, as here-
tofore, every thing in the shape of mirth
or gaiety was hateful to him, but by
degrees his mind yielded to the attrac-
tion, and he further reconciled himself
to something like participation in the
universal rage for idle amusement, in a
country where folly and fashion give the
law, in the reflection that by so doing
could he alone hope for the remotest in-
telligence respecting those he. sought.
Thus he roamed from theatre to theatre,

froin one party to another, from town to
country, in the environs among the gar-
dens; yet of those who were ever upper-
most in his thoughts he discerned not the
sinallest trace ; and began to resolve on
speedily quitting a place which since it
had ceased to inspire him with hope,
inspired him only with disgust.
It happened that a gay young noble-
man, named St. Evremond, one with
whom he had formerly been in the habits
of associating, called on him one morn-
ing: (while solitary in his chamber he
was ruminating whether from Paris he:
should go as he first intended to Italy;
or otherwise to Switzerland, in the vain
hope that Madame Bertrand might be
enabled to give him some intelligence re-
specting his lost daughter )., and per-.
ceiving his: extreme dejection, proposed

accompany him to a fair Englishwoman,
whom he had lately, formed acquaint-
ance with, and whom Angelo, as he
considered him more than half an Eng-
lishman, might "probably be pleased
to converse with.
Having lost the best and loveliest of
her sex, Angelo had not at this juncture
a thought to throw away on woman;
but the name English woman caused in
him an involuntary emotion, for it was
by England that Gabrielle had become
his bride, and in England where now
her cold remains were laid ; he could not
avoid asking of the Marquis de St. Evre-
mond, what he knew concerning the fe-
male, and how long she had been in Paris.
" She has been among us some time,"
St. Evremond replied, " but I have not
known her long. Iwas introduced to her

by de Vainville, my friend and yours; all
I know of her, is, that she supports a
splendid appearance, and is visited by
most of our savoir vivre, both old and
young, and by many of our ladies, whose
rank and situations are such as to give
them a license for doing what they please,
and who can venture to set formal rules
at defiance. All are pleased with the
society she contrives to draw to her house,
and with the choice entertainment,mirth,
and gaiety, that are always to be met
with there ; yet I believe I may confi-
dently assert, that no one knows, any
more than myself, from whence she de-
rives her sources, or even cares. more
than I do; pleasure being the object of
life, what matter how it is obtained?"
" True," thought Angelo to himself,

the moment that the observation was not

long since had been most decidedly so to
himself. Well," cried he aloud, " I
will attend you then, for I have a curi-
osity to see this fair one.""Ah ! fort
bien, au rvoir," cried the gay Marquis
running out of the room, "I have a
thousand important things to perform,
and above all must hasten to the rehear:
sal at the opera, for I am every thing
there; so adieu."
The evening found Angelo prepared
for his destined visit; the Marquis was
true to his appointment, and they de-
parted together. They soon arrived at
the elegant residence of this vaunted fair
INN, and were ushered into an apart-
ment richly furnished, gaily illuminated,
highly perfumed, and filled with a mul-
titude of those gaudy butterflies, who
wander about in search of pleasure, in-

different,as St. Evremond had aptly said,
where or how it might be obtained.
" There," cried he to Angelo as heen-
tered," there is the goddess of this terres-
trial heaven : do you not observe how she
is surrounded, absolutely encompassed
by a crowd, yet towers above them all; dd
but regard, Counta majestic height!!!
Angelo looked forward, and beheld the
tall: figure of a woman, fancifully but not
tastefully attired, and who, whatever
might be the attractions of her form,
could rank neither delicacy, nor elea
gance among them. Her face was not
towards them, and St. Evremond promi-
sed his companion that he would pre-
sently make his way and introduce him.
But now the female turned, and was mov-
ing towards them ; St. Evremond called
the attention of Angelo ; he had already
caught a glimpse of a countenance not

unfamiliar to him, and was turning faint.
She drew nearer ; Angelo looked with all
his powers of vision. Bedaubed with
rouge, covered with frippery, bloated
and disfigured, but not completely dis-
guised, he beheld before himthe

The abandoned Milborough had be-

petrified with alarm, but promptly re-

wholly unconcerned.

" That is more than I can undertake
to do," returned Milborough ; " the

me, and has been for some time."
"5. Abominable woman! this prevari-
cation shall not avail you; if you do not
instantly say where you have secreted
the youth, I will publicly expose you,
and bring you to punishment."
Milborough burst into a loud laugh.
" Why, what would you gain by that?"
exclaimed she ; :" no one here would

would you gain? Besides, how can you

if already his young mind had yielded to
-vice, who had been his betrayer ? Be-

Angelo started back, and gazed on
Milborough as in wonder that such
frightful depravity could exist in human
nature. He beheld the countenance of
the fiend, fierce, bold, exulting; he
essayed to speak, but could not ;so
tremblingly alive was he to disgrace or
exposition. Milborough had touched a
string which vibrated to madness; his
strength seemed equally with his power
of speech to be failing him; scarcely
knowing what he did, he made a desperate
effort to recal his waning faculties, and
breaking through the surrounding throng
he rushed like a maniac from the house.

Pursuing his original intention, he di-
rected his course to Italy; nor till he
breathed the pure air of his father's
native country, did he begin to revive
from the dreadful effects of the blow he
had received, or feel lighter of the
weight of woe that had oppressed him.
Arrived at Naples, again he was at

of demons who tormented him, to be
received with joy, among friends who
loved him. His mourning habit, his.

By degrees the unhappiness of An-
gelo diminished, though a corroding an-
xiety to discover his children still re-
mained, and actuated him to use every
effort; all however proved unhappily
fruitless, every inquiry vain, to
dispiriting degree; and in despair he
began to believe that the curse of
Heaven was visited upon him and that his
offspring, unnoticed, and unclaimed were
doomed in sad dishonour to wander
through the earth. At length, after
remaining a considerable time at Na-
ples, the project of seeking Madame
Bertrand in Switzerland again occurred
to him; but when he prepared to put his
plan in execution his courage failed,

had first blighted the hopes of that
youth, destroyed that innocence, mar-

come a villain, though not a deliberate
one perhaps, beneath the roof of trust-
ing hospitality;the deep conscious-
ness of the wrongs he had commit-
ted, was too strong for the heart of
Angelo, and his mind was too weak to
endure the retrospection of them 'amid
scenes and in shapes, so harrowing.
He had not fortitude to inflict upon
himself the renovated pangs of con-
science, nor to bow beneath those
pangs as just, or hail them as expia-
tory; to feel that he was a wretch was
already too much ; to have it confirmed

His friends (some of whom were suf-
ficiently interested in him to endeavour
to read his, mind, and consequently
discovered its anguished workings, ) dis-
suaded him from the idea altogether,
and proposed instead that he should
address Madame Bertrand by letter on
the subject nearest his heart, and which
would answer every purpose to be gain-
ed equally with a visit. To this al-
ternative Angelo, appearing convinced of
its eligibility, yielded with secret joy,
happy to have an excuse for sparing
himself those terrible pangs, which,
on 'anticipation only, had already
shaken him to the very centre. In

as the nature of circumstances and the
occasional intrusion of sad remem-
brances would permit; every one studied
to cheer and amuse him, and none
more than those who, having known
Gabrielle, appreciated in a degree the
greatness of his loss, and sympathized
in his grief : in short, there was no-
thing which could render his residence
in this country otherwise than plea-
sing.

the contest, carried on with obstinacy
by her, was repaid with violence and
equal obstinacy from him, till wearied
by her stubborn perseverance, and im-
patient at her presumption, he one day,
during a furious quarrel, plunged his
stiletto in her breast : she languished
for a time under the wound, and then
expired in agony, while the dastard
who had inflicted the blow hastily,
secured the whole of what she posses-
sed, and fled. Such had been the fate
of Oriana, who had ended her career
of infamy, by a miserable death, and
whose dissolute life had merited no
better catastrophe.
A letter was dispatched to Madame
Bertrand, or rather Boffuet, and Angelo
awaited her reply in anxious impatience;

to renovate his hopes. In it he had only

of having never yet heard the least tid-

hour of her departure ; bitter lamenta-
tions, that opened afresh his own wounds,
for the death of her adored Gabrielle,
(which event he had in his letter made
known to her) ; horrible apprehensions,
vividly pourtrayed, which conjur-
ed too before the mind of Angelo, the
most appalling images of what might
be the probable fate of her dear lost child;
and then, with that pardonable egotism
so natural to human nature, did she revert
to her own unfortunate situation, the
folly she had been guilty of in marrying,
at her years, a brutal, selfish and pas-
sionate wretch like Boffuet, and the
merited punishment of harsh and cruel
treatment which she had in consequence
experienced.

Some short time farther baring now
elapsed, notwithstanding his agreeable
situation in Italy, and that no other coun-
try could have for him equal charms, An-

paradise, and to return to England, where

test information of either, he resolved to
traverse all Europe in search of them,
and even to penetrate into other quar-
ters of the globe, if the shadow of a
probability offered that researches so
distant might not prove ineffectual.
So long as he was inactive, he considered
that he was not obeying the injunctions
of the sainted Gabrielle, and in the midst
of those little festivities with which his
friends sometimes contrived to enter
tain him, suddenly he would start up,
and rush from the gay scene, as consi-
dering that he was not pursuing her last
desires, and secretly accuse him self
of a sacrilegious negligence. Such was
the high influence and triumph, though
late obtained, of virtue and excellence,
over the wandering and unsteadymind
of a libertine.

It was in vain for those who prized
the society of Angelo, and desired to
retain him among them, to represent to
him the wildness of his proposed plan,
or seek to impress upon his mind, that
the ideas of Gabrielle in entreating
him to think of his children, and endea-
vour to trace them, never extended to the
length that he imagined; he persevered
in his determination, alledging that he
should not religiously fulfil her, dying
request, or his promise to her, if while he
had life, he desisted from the unremitting
search. He fixed then a period for his
departure, and while the time 'rapidly
approached, his friends, anxious at least
to procrastinate it,imagined an endless
variety of entertainment, calculated to
have dissipated lesser cares, and have
shaken resolutions less firm.

some of the beautiful environs of Naples,
he beheld at a slight distance before him
a young female, who though veiled from
head to foot, betrayed a figure of such
exquisite symmetry that involuntarily he
was attracted towards her. Angelo was
no longer young, and tumultuous pas-
sion for the fair had long ceased to agi-
tate his heart; yet still was he not insen-
sible to their attractions, and was an
enthusiastic admirer of beauty, without
being a lover.
Desirous if possible to behold the fair
countenance which he conceived must
appertain to a form so divine, he quick-
ened his pace, and had nearly reached
the object of an idle curiosity, when by
accident she stumbled and fell. Angelo,
no longer entertaining an idea but that
of rendering assistance, flew to raise her
from the ground, and with the most de-

licate attention offered his services; the
veil of the fair incognita had fallen
aside, and discovered a countenance which
exceeded if possible the expectations
which her figure had raised. Without
being absolutely what is termed beau-
tiful, there was in it an expression which
surpassed beauty's self, and conveyed to
the mind an idea of loveliness, such as
its most enthusiastic imagery could never
have conceived. Angelo gazed with an
admiration that almost deprived him of
the ease and self possession acquired by
long intercourse with polished society;
while the
young female modestly, thank-
ing him for the assistance he had ren-
dered her, turned in another direction
from that in which she had been walk-
ing, for the purpose of returning home.
This movement recovered Angelo, and

liarly his own, which no time could di-
minish, he offered her his arm, entreat-
ing that she would deign to lean upon
it, till she had in some degree recovered
the agitation occasioned by her acci-
dent.
" Indeed, Signor," answered she with
an enchanting avet, and deeply blush-
ing, "if it would not materially incon-
venience
you,
I would accept your kind
offer, as in truth I feel so much hurt as
to be scarcely capable of walking."
The heart of Angelo felt an emotion
of pleasure ; he presented his arm for
her acceptance with an air of respectful
interest, and requested that she would
support herself wholly upon it. A fe-
male needed his assistance this was
enough for the highly bred and polish-

his language, and not to embarrass or op-
press, evenby his admiration, one who had
honoured him so far as to believe she ran
no risk by accepting his protection.
The fair female consequently found
herself at ease. The appearance of Angelo,
though strictly elegant, was no longer
that of a young man ; this circumstance
contributes likewise to increase her con-
fidence; he spoke little, but that little
with delicacy and reserve, seeming scarce-
ly to exact a return; he confined himself
to general observations, or adverted to
such topics as the most lovely and inno-
cent female might have participated in
without a blush.
At length, at the entrance of a small
villa, which had nothing in its exterior
to recommend it, but a modest simple
elegance, the fair' stranger stopped.

Angelo knew women well; by this
time he had acquired experience, and
was well versed in their various arti-
fices. A new light broke upon his mind,
he gazed upon the fair creature before
him with altered eyes; she appeared in-
nocent, but it must be delusion; he be-
held in her no longer a virtuous female,

in a favourite and retired villa, as the
soft companion of their lighter hours.
Immediately at this conception, whether
just or unjust, and which had its source
in the prejudice of Angelo against the
sex, from his knowledge (with a single
exception only) of the worser part, his
real respect vanished; the discovery
which he considered he had made, ar-
rested on his lips theavowal of his name,

further of the lovely stranger.
With a gay air therefore, but devoid
of levity, he observed, "I trust, Signora,

to the favour I have solicited."
or Gratitude commands that I should
see you again, indeed, Signor; but I
know not if it is warranted by a strict

Angelo deeming this a flight of af-

answered: " The idea is every thing,
Signora; the feeling which would prompt
you to admit me is a virtue; how then,
in yielding to it, can you be guilty of an
impropriety?".

cried the young female,gracefully waving
her hand, as she entered the house. An-
gelo returned her courtesy with a smile,
" She will not say she wishes to see me
again," said he mentally, "but it is suf-
ficiently evident without." Impressed
with this idea, and others no more favour-
able to the fair incognita, he slowly re-
traced his way home.
The next morning he failed not to be
punctual to his self-invited appointment;
he beheld her walking in the garden be-
fore her house, and was not displeased
to remark that she received him with an
air of pleasure; she invited him into the
house with that mixture of frankness and
politeness that, while it placed him en.

improper familiarity. Thus, though sur-

The interior of thie dwelling corre- -

inhabitant was visible, save an ancient
female domestic. Still would cruel sus-

Why did this lovely creature live in
such profound solitude? why, if a re-
spectable female, did she not inix in so-

of appropriate companions ? why, this"
air of mystery? why, if her sources of
livelihood were such, and her means of

That her situation was such as he had
at first suspected, he still continued to
believe, and still therefore was unwilling
to acknowledge himself for who he was ;
for the present he had evaded rendering
his name, by having first recognized the .
fair stranger in her garden, and having
addressed her while there. But desirous
as he was to wrap himself in conceal-
ment, knowing how easily the jealousy

My naine, Signer, is Ida," returned
the young female, slightly blushing.
" Ida!" repeated Angelo, with an
air that seemed to say, "and nothing
more?"
" Ida," she replied again to his in-
quiring glance.
" Ida only," thought Angelo; "more
mystery!"
"But, Signor," added Ida' timidly,
"I hope I am not incorrect in asking
whom I have had the honour of con-
versing with ?"
Angelo was wholly unprepared for

this natural question, for with the pride
incidental to man, he thought it only
right that his own curiosity should be
gratified, while he did not infer the ne-
cessity of gratifying that of others in
return. But Ida, with all her unassu-

swer; and Angelo, in confusion, seeing
no longer the possibility of escape, me-

Angelo was instantly sensible of the

fusion the card of a friend, (which he
had accidentally about him,) in lieu of

was about to explain, when the idea
suddenly struck him, that by permitting
her to remain in her error, he was hidden
beneath an impenetrable veil, while at
the same time he promised himself that
he would neither disgrace the name of his
friend, nor make an improper use of the
covert which it lent him. It was not that
Angelo shrunk from the probability of a
duel, for he wanted neither courage nor
bravery, nor that he dreaded secret as-
sassination ; but he wished not at this
period to have his name involved in a
ridiculous affray about a woman, or
unnecessarily to be pointed out as a rival,
when at present he felt no inclination to
become one. Further he reconciled his
mind to the practice of the deception, in
the reflection, that Ida observed mystery
towards him, in having given him only
half her name.

But thus yielding to the temptation
to act with duplicity, was under any

punishment duly proportioned to the
dereliction from honour and propriety.

CHAPTER XXVII.
A day now scarcely elapsed that the
fair Ida was not visited by Angelo. Un-
consciously he had abandoned all thought
of hastening his departure, and felt him-
self gradually and irresistibly attracted
towards this newly discovered magnet.
Still, however, the fair: one was only
Ida to him, still her manners were the
samefrank, and graceful, and deli-
cately modest; all around her still wore
the self same air, and still impenetrable
to the foot of other man than himself,
appeared her fair abode. Inclined to
suspect, yet unable to ascertain; invo-
luntarily admiring, yet afraid to trust,

Angelo revolved in vain in his mind some
means of deciding at once the real cha-
racter of the mysterious recluse; he
could not deny but there shone in all her
actions a beautiful simplicity--yet was it
real? or was it not rather merely as-
sumed?
Having dined one day with a party of
his gay associates, and enjoying in the
unrestrained spirit of conviviality, his-
wine and ices in the fresco, it occurred
to him, as he found his vivacity elevated
to a higher pitch than it had ever been
since the death of Gabrielle, that he had
never yet visited his beauteous solitary
at a rate hour of the evening. As he:
pondered on this idea, and continued
drinking, he determined, exhilarated as
he was, that the present would furnish
him with the opportunity he had long
sought of ascertaining her character in

its true light:should he, as he expected,
be refused admittance, he should imme-
diately infer that her lover was with her,
and his suspicions would be at once con-
firmed; but should he, on the contrary,
be admitted, and find her as heretofore
entirely alone, then, by a change of de-
portment towards hier, would he prove
if she were really the innocent and vir-
tuous creature she appeared to be.
Thusis it with manif a female wears
the semblance of being virtuous, if even
calumny's self cannot prove her other-
wise, then do they require some proof
stronger even than truth itself; but if
being not equally wary as virtuous, if
unable to resist or circumvent various
temptation and ceaseless manuvre, at
length she fall, then do they despise
her for her weakness, triumphantly and.

of their assertion, that " she could
never have been virtuous."
Flushed with wine, heated in the an-
ticipation of expected victory, Angelo
stole silently from his companions, and
bent his steps towards the residence of
Ida. Instantly he was admitted, and
found her alone; he approached her with
an air gayer than usual, and was re-
ceived with the same artless and undis-
guised pleasure as ever by her."Ha!"

to obviate the idea of impropriety in
receiving his visits, attributed this un-
wonted vivacity to an overflow mere-
ly, of animal spirits, and thought not
of an attempt to repress them. This
forbearance, while it strengthened his
suspicions against her, emboldened him
in the pursuit of his intentions ; his
respect began gradually in appearance
to diminish, his language became more
tender and familiar, and his looks de-
clared to Ida that he entertained sen-
timents which she had been incapable
of suspecting

Mortified, indignant not less at his

herself, and in so doing, a portrait
which had been concealed in her bo-

would have fallen to the ground, but

chain, exclaimed,

severity to me!- let us see at least the

near the light; he held it to his eyes,

to the pale agony of terror, had reco-
vered from personal apprehension, and
found her feelings attracted in a dif-
ferent channel. With eager glances,
and in an irregular tone, anticipating
she knew not what, she replied to the
question of Angelo" It was a mother

give."

" Her name ! her name!" gasped An-
gelo.
" Gabrielle de Montmorency!"
Angelo flew towards her, he clasped
her to his breast, while Ida,stilltrembling,
unknowing what to think, endeavoured
to withdraw from his strict embrace.

cried Angelo in agony, and almost suf-
focated' by conflicting emotion, horror,
confusion, remorse, "II am your
Father--your name is not Ida, but
Agnes."
Ida shrieked, and nearly fell to the
ground her father caught her in his
armagh-she feared no longer, she reposed
upon his bosom. With transport, then,
how much more pure and delightful,
did he press to his heart as a daughter
her whom he had viewed with other
eyes, and sought for the ignoble pur-
pose of unhallowed passion.
Agnes was the 'first to recover from

justly alloying the refined delight he
would otherwise have felt in the reco-

artless effusions, now felt his heart-strings
suddenly contract, and uttering a cry of
renewed anguish, he said,

He covered his face with his hands, and
bursting sobs rent, without relieving his
heart. Agnes respected the renewed
anguish of her father; she did not speak,
but laying her - head upon his bosom,
mingled her tears with his. Angelo
pressed her with a sacred fervour to his
heart; through his eyes, misty with
tears, he gazed upon those lovely and
noble features, which often he had fan-
cied bore a fugitive resemblance to
those of the departed Gabrielle, such as
when first he had beheld her ; now, he,
discerned in them an evident correspon- ;
dence with those of that angelic being,

though still the animated expression of
her entire countenance more nearly re-
sembled his own.
When the excess of their mutual feel-
ings had somewhat subsided, Angelo
found that he had a thousand inquiries
to make, that he was on the rack to
know how his beloved child could be
thus situated, seemingly alone and un-
protected, and by what mystery she was
enabled to appear thus independent of
the world. But the hour was late, and
now the father of her he had lately be-
held with feelings and sentiments so op-
posite to those of the parent, was trem-
blingly alive to even the semblance of
impropriety in the conduct of his daugh-
ter, and punctilious to the slightest trifle
that might concern her fame. So, often
with the libertine, whose moral feelings
are seldom outraged by seeking to de-

stroy the wife, sister, or daughter of
another, yet who are ever on the watch
to guard their own, and up in arms if the
shadow of an insult be cast upon them.
Thus then, Angelo resolved to sacrifice
his longing anxiety for an explanation
from Agnes, to the interest he now felt
in her reputation, and tore himself away,
determined to wait till the following
day for its gratification, and the solu-
tion of every uneasy doubt that involun-..
tarily preyed upon his mind.
He scarcely slept during the night,
or if he did, momentarily started up, in
the thrilling remembrance of having
found a daughter ; now in the terror that
she was being torn away from him, and
now in the painful thought that all was
but delusion. Her probable situation
sometimes presented itself to his mind;

he shuddered at the idea of what she
might have encountered, or burned in
the agonizing apprehension that she
might be infamous. Now he pondered
on her seeming lovely innocence, and
now writhed in anguish, lest it should
have been the prey of the seducer. So
passed the hours till morning, for which
he waited with intolerable anxiety, and
as soon as his sense of decorum, influ-
enced as it was by strong impatience,
would permit, he hastened to the abode
of his daughter, almost yielding to the
superstitious dread that he should no
longer find her there. But the fair
Agnes was at her door, eagerly expecting
him; yet the delight with which she re-
ceived him was mingled with embarrass-
ment, and in her fine countenance he
read the traces of uneasy sadness.--He
looked at her, and unknowing why, his
heart misgave him ; he took her hand

with tender seriousness, and led her into
the house.
The impatience of Angelo to learn
the particulars of her situation, was
controlled by an invincible yetinexpli-
cable sensation, that made him shrink
from inquiry;he longed, yet dreaded
to hear, and feared he knew not what.
The manner of Agnes too was far from
tending to reassure him; it was hesitating,
distressed, confused; her eyes filled mo-
mentarily with tears, and her cheeks
weredyed with blushes at every word lie
addressed to her, when there seeined no
visible cause of emotion. At length
-Angelo could support no longer this
dreadful uncertainty; he determined to
lead at once to the subject' so near his
heart, and to know the truth, even
though death or madness must ensue.

he almost fancied he could behold the
heart of Agnes beat beneath her robe,
while his too throbbed with violent and
answering emotion, he took her hand,

obtain her confidence. "Begin your re-

present. He considered me as an in-
truder in his house, and one whom it
was not incumbent on him to support,
in consequence of which he scrupled not
to seize every opportunity of depriving
me of food."
Already the heart of Angelo bled at
every word uttered by his deserted child,
the child whom he, rich in every luxury,
possessing ample means to cherish and
protect, had abandoned even before she
was born, and resigned to the mercy of
strangers, who, insensible to the tender-
ness of parental feelings, could without
pity aggrieve and wrong her. Terrible is
the thought to a fond parent, that his
tender child is left among those who love
it not, and to Angelo, though late in-
flicted, this pang was not to be for ever
spared. Perceiving the grief she excited
in her father, yet knowing well, keen

as it was, it was the least, alas, which,
she must cause him to suffer; she hasten-
ed over this part of her narrative, and
proceeded to later events.
" It was not however till extreme
terror in the apprehension of a threat-
ened severe chastisement from the un-
feeling Boffuet, for a trifling fault, that
knowing it would be impossible ulti
mately to escape his vengeance, which
would acquire increased fury only, from
being delayed, I seized an opportunity
of flying secretly from the house, un-
knowing where to bend my steps, and
indifferent if I but escaped the dreaded
punishment. I wandered about among
the most unfrequented vallies, and
mountains I had never trod before, till
as the shades of evening came on, I sat
myself by a little rivulet behind the

jecting part of a rock ; alarmed at the

alarmed at the idea of returning, and
yielding to childish weakness, I could not
restrain myself from weeping bitterly.
Presently I heard footsteps approaching
the spot; dreading lest it should be Bof-
fuet in pursuit of me, I started up, and
with the wildest speed began to ascend
the rock, when a gentle female voice
arrested my flight." Do not be alarmed,
my child, -do not fly."
I ventured to turn, and beheld an ele-
gant female leaning on the arm of a
gentleman, whose tender and compassio-
nate looks helped to dispel my fears
and induced me to stop. The lady drew
nigh, and taking my hand, gazed ear-

reconcile himself to the idea. On ob-
serving this, I, who desired ardently to
remain with them, for Madame Bertrand
had always told me that perhaps I should
never see my parents, and that they had
agreed to let me remain with her, yet
inspired with courage, for the thought
of Boffuet was appalling to me, and in
remaining with her I must remain with
him likewise ; this terrible reflection was
enough ; I cast myself on my knees

but unwilling to prejudice her tender
friend in his daughter's estimation, whose
love for her alone had led her into the
error of this otherwise inexcusable con-

forbore remark. Agnes proceeded.
"Well, I yield," cried the Baron,
" but upon one condition only, that
should we ever learn her parents desire
to reclaim her, we may unhesitatingly
return her to them."

bracing me again, " I consider her now

happiness, it was the idea of the suf-
ferings of my dear Madame Bertrand,
when she should find that I no more
returned. I longed to give her some
intelligence respecting my situation, but
fear lest the tyrannical Boffuet, for the
purpose of making me endure some
horrible punishment, should insist on
my being restored, was sufficient to deter
me from, and make me shudder at the
thought.
** I shall pass over, my dear father, a
period of several years,during which time
I was treated by my protecting friends
in every respect as their daughter, and
was universally esteemed as such. They
gave me the name of Ida, which had
been that of an only beloved daughter,
who had died in their arms at nearly
the same age as myself, when first I

became known to them. Thus was I as
happy as circumstances would permit,and
no inquiries respecting me having from
that period reached them, they had no
other idea but that of considering me
for ever as their own, the Baroness
frequently assuring me that she was
uncertain which she most loved, her son,
still absent at Gottingen perfecting his
education, or myself.
56 But although I was unclaimed by
my parents, perhaps even my existence
unknown to them, act a day elapsed that
they were absent from my mind; of my
sainted mother I loved to think, I re-
membered and cherished all that
Madame Bertrand had told me concern-
ing her, and considering her as something
above mortality, I even addressed my
prayers to her, and in fond enthusiasm

conduct.
" That beloved portrait which Madame
Bertrand had informed me her dear
hands had placed round my neck, when
for the last time she saw me, I gazed
on every night with the holy fervour of
a bigot, kissed and piously worshipped.
It was all I could call mine, it was al-
most my only care. If accidentally I
stumbled, unmindful of the pain or
injury I might feel, I examined eager-
ly my portrait; if that was safe, I was
indifferent to every other consideration.
In sorrow it consoled me, in sickness it
cured me, if despondent I but gazed on
it, hope and pleasing prospects danced
in my view. I lamented that it was only
the gift of my dear mother, and that

gaze on that of the Countess D'Albini,
and would endeavour to persuade myself
that it was hers, or resembled her at least.
I had shown it to the Baroness Stein-
haussen, as a miser shews his gold; scarce-
ly could I endure that she should touch
it. "My dear child," said she to me,
-- you will lose this valuable ornament,
and it is not impossible but that at
some future period its possession might
be material to you; give it into my
hands, I will carefully preserve it for
you; you run great risk indeed in carry-
ing it thus about you."
"Ah, dear madam", cried I, by
accident I can never lose it, I guard it as
it were my life, neither fraud nor violence
could wrest it from me, but if that were
possible, I should never live to regret its
loss ; do not then desire me to resign it

grateful acknowledgment for the hap-

the son of the Baron Steinhaussen;

" Retire, and leave me with Ida," cried

Miserable am I, that a creature every
way so worthy, one whom I tenderly
love, can yet never become in reality my
daughter. Listen to me with patience,
and I will explain to you some particu-

aware, and which will sufficiently show
you, how impossible it is for Darlowitz,
consistently with honour and duty, to be-

any but Julia Falkenheim, to whom he
is affianced." At these words I covered
my face with my hands and groaned,
for I considered Darlowitz as already my
husband.
" Hear me, my child," pursued the
Baroness, endeavouring to subdue her
own emotion" the Baron Steinhaussen

his ruin, and perhaps have exiled him
in shame and sorrow to a land where he
might live unknown. Under these cir-

our family, which is more noble than his,

ever his claims upon his fortune, upon.
condition that he would promise his son
in marriage to Julia, adding that if he
would accede to this proposition he
should consider the honour that would
be done him more than an equivalent for
the debt.
Though the family of Falkenheim is
not so ancient as ours, it is highly re-
spectable, and Steinhaussen after some
consideration yielded to the terms pro-

cancelled, and Darlowitz became the
betrothed husband of Julia. Think,
then, my dearest Ida, how impossible
it is for the Baron at this late period,
to think of retracting without appear-
ing at once the most contemptible and
dishonourable of mankind. Should he
discover the attachment of our son
to you, and the mutual vows which
you have uttered, I am convinced he
would die at once with rage, or be
bowed down to the grave with shame
and disappointment."
"What could I reply to this? It was
evident the Baroness desired me to say
the words, " I resign your son ;" and
perhaps, had I considered niyself alone,
I should have yielded to the sacrifice.
But I remembered the powerful ad-
juration of Darlowitz, the wild yet.

" At this rash communication, which

this violence, he vowed, fervently vow-

alone separate us, and reiterating his
vows to me, dared to oppose them as a
shield to the despair and indignation
of his father.
The fearful emotion of the Baron
Steinhaussen, and the shock his mind
had received, threw him into a raging
fever and delirium ; and in a few
days his physicians announced that his
recovery was next to impossible.

from his knees, and with a solemn air

terminate a life that grief had already
so much endangered. By proper ap-

" Though I had resolution to debar
myself of the sight of my lover, I was
not equal to the harrowing idea of re-

the wife of another. I wrote therefore a
few lines to the Baroness, intreating
that she would come to me without
the knowledge of Darlowitz. She has-
tened to obey my request, when I com-
municated to her the anxious desire
which I felt to quit an abode, where
the heart-wrung sacrifice I had made
was continually present to my mind ;
adding, that when removed from be-
neath the same roof with Darlowitz, he
might think less of me, and more of Julia
Falkenheim.

No, indeed," he replied with a
frightful smile,

Mademoiselle, I must tell you. Madame
Boffuet, poor woman, could never attend
like another wife to the concerns of her
house. One day I had been out, and return-
ing home required my dinner; I found
nothing prepared, and Madame Boffuet
no where to be seen. In a fit of rage I
flew to her chamber, there I found her
shut up weeping over this very letter.

an uncontrollable passion I threw the

immediately to quit her chamber, and
attend to her domestic duties."
" Poor Madame Bertrand!" exclaim-
ed I, " dear persecuted friend !" when
perceiving the brow of Boffuet begin-
ning to lower, I added, " Ah! had
that letter but been preserved, I think
I could have forgiven the loss of all
the rest."
Oh, but I was glad to destroy my
old tormentors, the letters," answered
the unfeeling Boffuet, " it was the only

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Angelo had recovered a long lost
daughter ; but how recovered her ? The
fond gratulations of the father were
checked by bitter anguished reflections
on the past; and while he wished to
remember only that he had found a
child, he was doomed to feel that she
could never be his boast. Her who
might have flourished a fair blooming
rose beneath the fostering hand of a
parent, was blighted by the storm,
and broken by the foot of the stranger.
Conscience whispered that the fault

was his, and that he who forsakes in
infancy his offspring, must not hope
to be blessed by them in glorious pride
upon a future day !
Angelo viewed his daughter with the
fondest affection ; he idolized the lovely
artlessness of her character, admired her
singular beauty, and was charmed with
her just and noble sentiments ; yet still,
still he could not triumph in her.
In the midst of her brilliant qualities
his tenacious eye discerned a blemish,
and such was his pride, selfish and un-
just, that he could not bear to ac-
knowledge to the world that this
long-lost, long-sought daughter was
not perfect ! that the child, left for
years unaided on the wide desert of
the world, had fallen a prey to inevi.

the idea of passing her on society for
a creature perfect in character as in form,
lest in an evil hour her secret should be
betrayed, and he be covered with a
dreadful shame, which, however me-
rited, he felt that he could never sup-
port.
Thus tremblingly alive was the li-
bertine to his own dishonour, and
thus minutely sensible, could he feel
and judge of a calamity that he had
entailed upon many a doting parent,
fond husband, or honourable brother,
whose best hopes might have been fixed
upon
the fair female he had destroyed.
To a very few and select friends
therefore alone was Agnes by the ap-
prehensive Angelo introduced, and even
those he examined with a lynx-eyed
fearful anxiety, lest in the innocent
looks of the lovely. Agnes they should

read what he so trembled to have
surmised. Even the homage which was
paid her, yielded him a pleasure al-
loyed by an impatient and uneasy
dread, lest some accident should 'oc-
cur to prove her unworthy of it, and
change it into scorn ; if (indeed any
could have viewed with scorn a crea-
ture like Agnes), or when informed of
her story, have beheld her with other
eyes than those of a respectful pity.
No one indeed could
indeed could think of his
daughter half so severely as did Angelo
himself.
Often did he pause on the idea of
quitting with her the world, and bury-
ing himself in a profound retirement,
where," thought he, " I might with-
out fear or restraint admire the virtues
of my Agnes; no worldly considerations
would then intervene to cover my elreek

His was not a
mind to be thrown upon itself; frivo-
lous habits and long residence in so-
ciety had unfitted him for the delights
of solitude, which, so far from posa
sessing any charms to him, appeared re-
plete with horrors.

clusion for his daughter only, while
he shuddered at it for himself. Could
he induce her to leave the world,
where he durst not exhibit her in the
proud light he wished, he would pro-
cure for her some elegant retirement,
and consider himself supremely happy
in her acquiescence. Thus with an un-
becoming and morbid pride, did he
shrink from accompanying into society
the child for whose errors he alone
was accountable, and with a selfish
weakness still more unpardonable at his
period of life, - hesitate to abandon a
world from which yet he wished to
exile a young and lovely being, that
but for his own conduct would never
have given him cause even for this sha-
dow of reproach.
Such had been the extremity to which

his pride had prevailed, that he had
ordered Agnes to address the Baron
Steinhaussen in a letter which he dic-
tated, thanking him for the protection
which had been so long afforded her,
and simply intimating that an occur-
rence of recent date had rendered it
longer unnecessary for her to avail
herself of their continued bounty; re-
questing at the same time, that it
might be instantly withdrawn. Thus

currence to the name of Darlowitz, and
all mention of her having found

From that period the name of Stein-
haussen was hateful to him ; and when
Agnes would sometimes innocently
dwell upon the kindness they had
demonstrated towards her, the impa-
tient looks of her father would spee-

dily shew her that she 'touched upon
a string which vibrated only discord :
by degrees, therefore, she dreaded,
without knowing why, and ultimate-
ly ceased altogether to allude, to
them.
It became necessary however to de
cide: either Agnes, being constantly with
her father, must at once be unequivo-
cally introduced as his daughter, or
else some other situation must be
thought of for her ; for in this desul-
tory and unsettled state, liable to a
thousand inconveniences, subject to
eternal alarm, it was impossible to
continue. One day when she was sit-
ting in the same room with him, An-
gelo, who had long had it in contempla-
tion to propose to her a plan on which
he suffered himself to dwell with pe
culiar complacency, thought he had

now discovered a mode by which, with-
out appearing to desire it, he could
lead her on, not only to yield but
joyfully to accede to what he had in
view.
Agnes, my dear child," said he ten-
derly, taking her hand,"among all those
of my friends whom you have seen, which
do you prefer?"
"I have no preference for any one,
my dear father," replied Agnes, " but
I esteem them all equally."
" And is there not any one among
them, Agnes, that you could esteem suf-
ficiently for a husband?" Agnes started
back, and the colour forsook her cheeks,
then with her native artlessness she cried,
tears rushing to her eyes, "Ah, my dear
father, I only implore you, talk not to

me of marriage ; I hope and trust that
your daughter cherishes no sentiment
which should be banished from her breast;
but ah ! she feels that her heart cannot be
offered to another--thatthat it has been
wedded once, and can take no second
husband."
Angelo bit his lips, and his determi-
nation to pursue his purpose acquired
fresh strength.

a serious air, " him to whom your heart
was wedded, is now the husband of ano-
ther."
" Tis true," cried Agnes, bursting into
tears, " and I love him for the virtue
which caused him to become so."
" It is a point," replied Angelo, with
increasing gloom, "that I have no de
sire to hear discussed.'

"Oh ! my father," cried Agnes in a
mournful voice, " I feel nothing which
you ought not to hear confessed."
" It is enough," replied Angelo.

if not"

too should you expiate the offence of
having entertained them."

on her knees, and raising her hands to
heaven, " have I been so long in error
then, and has conscience failed to reproach
me ? can I be indeed the guilty creature
which my father represents me? Ah! if
it be indeed so, in the gloom of a con-
vent let me hide my head ; if I am inno-

The heart of Angelo smote him at the
pious and artless appeal of the daughter

her from the ground, hesaid, ,

Angelo paused; the picture which he
had drawn pleased the imagination of
his daughter, and soothed without
alarming her mind. For her, monastic
seclusion had no terrors; with the
charms of the world she was but little
acquainted, she saw too that her father

servation. If she remained in the world she
might at some future period be pressed
again to marry, an idea from which,
above every other, her unhealed heart
revolted ; by yielding to monastic se-
clusion she preserved her fidelity to her
first love, she yielded his place in her
heart to no mortal image, but to that of
God alone!
It was this last reflection which rais-
ed her to enthusiasm. Religion and
obedience spoke through the medium
of an unconquered love, and while in-
fluenced singly by that, she believed
it was to them, she yielded : she embra-
ced her father, and in an animated voice,
with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes,
exclaimed," Do with me as you will, my
father! you have recovered your daugh-
ter, you rejoiced when you did so, let
her not prove that she is unworthy of

your love by being hostile to your
wishes."
With a mixed sensation of pleasure
and remorse, Angelo returned the fervid
embrace of the innocent Agnes, who
little surmised the complex movements
of her father's heart, or the secret springs
which actuated his conduct. The strong
power of her first love made perpetual
seclusion seem easy to Agnes, and robbed
it of its repulsive terrors ; but pure
indeed must be the love which takes re-
fuge in religion, and innocent the ten-
derness which may be animated by devo-
tion !

CHAPTER XXIX.
Having so far compassed his purpose
in gaining the acquiescence of the
gentle Agnes, Angelo, unnecessarily ap-
prehensive that she might retract, or
desire at least to do so, hastened every
necessary measure, and shortly esta-
blished her in the convent della Tri-
nita delle Monache, one of the most
splendid receptacles in all Italy for
the daughters of the nobility, and ac-
counted one of the richest in its or-
naments, and pictures. But to remain
in Italy during the whole year of her
noviciate, was a circumstance which

would materially derange the plans of
Angelo, who was now desirous of quit-
ting it as early as possible.
He confided to an intimate friend
his embarrassment, who instantly
proposed to exert whatever influence
he possessed individually, and all be-
sides that he could command, to pro-
cure a dispensation from the Pope for
limiting the time of her noviciate to
six months. Angelo hailed this idea
with rapture, and immediately put
in motion every engine to facilitate
it.

He was soon given to understand that
he need not doubt of success, and he
resolved therefore to remain in Naples
during the indispensable period, to vi-
sit his daughter in her convent, but
never permit her to leave it, lest inter-

course with the world should make the
contrast on her return to it appear
too forcible, and give her a distaste
to the idea of passing her life within
its gloomy walls.
Thus, while Angelo hushed, without
appeasing his conscience, in the re-
flection that he was faithfully perform-
ing his promise to the departed Ga-
brielle in seeking their children, while
he exulted in the idea of having dis-
covered one, and how her spirit, could
it look down, would bless him, he did
not, or would not think, what must
have been her feelings had she still lived,or
what if from her sainted abode she could
ha ve viewed his actions, to behold
him forcing his only daughter, in the
pride of youth and beauty, into the
wretched gloom of a convent ! -to look

to punish with unfeeling severity for
his own pride's sake (what yet had
originated in his own guilt), a crea-
ture who might still have done him
honour, and who was formed to have be-
come an ornament to society. Was this,
ah! wasthis! fulfilling the fond wishes of
the tender mother ? was this to cherish
and protect the daughter whom Pro-
vidence had directed to him, that he
might atone to her, for his past in-
justice ? that he might triumph in
her, and that she might prove a so-
lace to his age! was this his atone-
ment ? his gratitude ? to despise the
mercy he had received, and with sa-
crilegious pride, hasten to bury her
in the profoundest gloom ?
But Angelo examined not so nar-
rowly the secret recesses of his heart;

he took not to himself the full shame
he merited ; he was not impartial in
self-investigation ; he loved not to view
his actions in the worst light, conse-
quently considered his conduct as nei.
ther heinous nor unjustifiable.
During the six months previous to
the confirmation of the devoted Ag-
nes, he visited her daily. When a
young girl is once within the convent
walls, no artifices are spared to induce
her to desire to take the veil; a mo-
nastic life is painted to the eyes of a
novice in all these fascinating colours
calculated to excite the most fervent
enthusiasm of an ardent mind. No-
thing trivial, nothing earthly is suf-
fered to intervene ; all appears celestial,
sublime, above mortality! the imagi-

expected II Conte D'Albini to bestow

The period at length arrived ; the
fair Agnes, resigned, composed, forming
no wish to the contrary, yielded to
every ceremony, submitted her meek
head to be despoiled of its treasures
of waving gold, exchanged her white
veil for a black one, and immolating

its pleasures also, bowed before it a

before the appointed time, he made his
appearance before Angelo; he was wrap-
ped in a loose coat, a large hat was pul-
led over his eyes, and his purpose being
to have only alast look at Ida, heagreed
to remain almost behind Angelo, during
the short moment he was to remain.
They walked on in silence to the con-
vent, Angelo not even deigning a look on
his despairing companion,--they were
admitted, approached the grate, and the
fair Agnes was informed that her father
awaited her. Instantly she obeyed the
summons, and drawing near the grate,
put through her hand for her father.

veloped in a sable veil, as the fair moon

him one of his fleetest horses, promising
that he would take every possible care

Arrived in Rome, Angelo awaited there
only till he might receive some intelli-

to lose no time in embarking immediate-

which he desired once more to revisit,
and thence proceeding immediately to
England.

within their precincts; that nevertheless
they desired for their own sakes to ren-

some delicate compensation to their house
in the form of a magnificent offering:

happy to find that another, and one of
whom he had an high opinion, would
have acted as he had done, and this re-

of human misery increased !
Agreeably to the advice of his friend,
Angelo de parted from Rome, first how-
ever thanking him for the valuable letter
he had sent him, which he declared to have
lightened his soul of half its oppression;
then stating to him his intended move-
ments, observed that he should make no
stay till he arrived at Paris, where he
hoped to find a letter waiting for him,
informing him of the welfare of his
daughter, respecting whom he entreated
him to enquire daily.
In justice to Angelo, however, be it
said, that though he decided to visit
Paris, before his return to England, it
was not so much to diversify the scene,
as his friend expressed it, as to gratify

perhaps through the medium of the in-

way through France without relaxing

necessary rest till he arrived at Paris;
when allowing himself only a few hours
of repose, unable to controul his natural
impetuosity, he hastened to the abode
of the Marquis St. Evremond, chusing
rather to enquire first of him concern-

St. Evremond, with the utmost noncha-

abode of that nature was most proper

and as after one visit to la belle Angloise,
you saw as much of her as you could

her, and therefore it became the fa-

once she had decreed this, to notice her.

Angelo heard the relation which baf-

regret, but on that account. He felt
so surprise that a dreadful habit, by
which he knew her formerly distin-

consented to accompany him to this re-

the most terrible woe! though not with-

might be so much more agreeably spent.
When they reached the Bictre they
inquired concerning Milborough, but
were answered, that no one could be per-

that rendered it improper for her to be
seen. By dint of high bribery however
they were secretly admitted. The in-

their shrinking sense; mournful cries !

attracted pity from the hardest heart!
there the wild unconscious solitary
whispered aloud his secret of fancied
importance ! here the lover reproached
in bombastic strain his mistress who
was not by ! and there her who had been
forsaken, implored the compassion of
him who heard her not, and who had
long since forgot that he had ever
known her! -Oh! human nature ! to
what an abyss of woe art thou reduced,
when the fine chords of the mind are en-

madness -Oh! most pitiable of calami-

Here the sight which met the eyes
of Angelo, whose nerves were less rigid
than those of the Frenchman, was almost
more than, with all his just abhorrence
of her, he could endure.
:
Sitting half naked on some straw,
secured round the waist by a massy
iron
chain to a ring in the wall, raved in wild-
est madness the insensate Milborough !
The garments that partly covered her,
(for in her paroxysms she had torn them
almost to tatters) exposed to view that
wretched person, bearing evident marks
of the treatment she had necessarily re-
ceived. Her hair fell around her in wild
disorder, her starting eyes rolled rapid-
ly in their sockets, her cheek was hag-
gard and pale, and in her whole aspect
there was an expression of savage fierce-
ness, that shocked rather than interested
the beholder.

took possession of her, and she made an
attempt to rush towards him! Failing of
course, from the confinement of her
chain, she uttered a fearful yell, clapped
her hands together repeatedly, and burst-
ing into a loud discordant laugh, which
echoed through the terrible abode, and
seemed multiplied by a thousand others,
she leaped and danced with antic move-
ment, and struggled to escape, till, ex-
hausted by a violence that the strength
of madness alone could give, she sunk
exhausted down.
Unable to endure a repetition of this
horrible scene, and finding it vain to
expect aught like reason (in which

wretch so lost, he precipitately left the
spot, resigning to a fate dreadful, yet
justly merited, her who had barbed the
keenest arrow for the heart of Gabrielle,
the envenomed poison of which had
festered there, and sapped the source of
life! Her who had rendered him de-
testable in his own eyes, and who had
filled his breast with remorse, excited a
feeling of melancholy, but no compassion
for her state, in the breast of Angelo.
Men love not the remembrance of
their crimes ; firm friendships can be

hence the wicked have no sympathy for
each other in the hour of adversity.

their souls, may draw them resistlessly

continue to pay Agnes every attention,

From Verospi he had heard more-

an appearance of youth and elegance,

" True," answered the robber in a low
voice, " but we can meet death only

darted away with inconceivable ve-

Angelo pursued him with his eyes at
far as the darkness would permit; he
could not reconcile his profession with
his appearance, and though he had re-
ceived convincing proof that whatever
he might think, they were not incompa-

he had been on the S-

at the question; " for what purpose do

thanking Angelo for his information,
they rushed off at full speed in the direc-

Chagrined and distressed that he had
been so explicit, gladly would Angelo
have retracted all he had said, and
wistfully did he look around, vainly

felt some interest, he yet secretly hoped
that he would be able to elude his pur-

spirit of the animal on which he was

was not irrational.
Some few days after this adventure,
which had so unusually impressed the

diurnal print that the highwayman who
had for Bome time past infested the

two gentlemen, and was supposed to
have committed other similar offences,
