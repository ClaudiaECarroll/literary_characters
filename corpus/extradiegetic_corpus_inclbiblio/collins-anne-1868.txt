THE LANGTOXQ, TANNERS-
" TEPHEN !" exclaimed a shrill-voiced young lady of thirty-
ve, " what are you doing now 1 "
This was Stephen Langton's aunt, Harriet, his bitterest foe,
his perpetual persecutor. She was a lanky personage, with
reddish hair, bluish eyes, no eyelashes to speak of, and a gure
whose waist might be anywhere. Her utterance was always a
whining scold. Every incident of life was to her a subject of
complaint. She was the terror of the whole family, except her
father; and, as old Stephen Langton, the tanner, had never been
known to fear anything, he was not likely to begin with his own
daughter. She was uiet enough in his resence, awed by his
stormy voice and rea y hand. 'l'en years efore, for some slight
opposition to his will, he had boxed her ears in the presence of
a gatherin of his neighbours, among whom was the only young
man who ad seemed to take a fancy to her; and she was W61
aware that he was just as impetnous as ever.
Little Stephen, a bright-haired, blue-eyed boy of eleven, was
coiled in a window-seat of the old wainscoted room. A book
was in his hand, Bunyan's " Holy War ;" he was reading for the
twentieth time of the siege of Mansoul, that city whose besiegers
never relax their e'orts ; but ever and anon he looked across the
street to the windows of a. large quiet housejust opposite.
The house in which the Langtons lived had instead of a front
door a wide archway, through which waggons laden with oak-
bark and raw hides entered, and wagons laden with leather
came out. To the right, as on passed under this archway, was
the dwelling-house; to the eft, a shop fronting the street, and
spacious warehouses; behind, a courtyard, stables, gardens,
orchards; and farthest of all the tanyard, which was bounded
at the foot of the hill by a stream, which it greatly deled The
house was old and large, with lofty rooms and closets innumer-

able ; the front parlour was the principal living room of the
family. It had two windows; little Stephen was in the window-
seat to the left, while at the other sat his grandmother, bolt
upright, knitting stockings. She sat there from morning till
night, never rising to join in any of the meals, which were served
on a small table at her side. She occasionall uttered some brief
oracular sentence, of which no one took the s ightest notice. She
had been stupeed years before by her husband's brutality.
Her ndson Stephen was an orphan. His mother died at his
' birth ; is father w en he was ve years old. Stephen did not
realise his father's death. He often loitered through the Cathe-
dral Close and under the school cloisters, and along the meadowy
margin of the river Idle, in the ho of meeting him. He was a
strange dreamy b0 , whom his unc es and aunts despised, because
they could not un erstand him. Nor did he et on at all with
his cousins, of whom there were several of bot sexes ; for. Miss
Harriet excepted, all the Langtons were married and prolic.
Miss Hamet oiciated as schoolmistress to all but Stephen.
He was rather older than any of his cousins, but his aunt's reason
for giving him up was his pertinacity in asking questions which
she was unable to answer. So he was sent just now to an old-
fashioned da -school in which boys and girls were mixed, and
where he ha positively managed to fall in love already. There
is nothing strange in that; but it so happened that Stephen's
little love-fancy was destined to colour his whole life.
" What a lazy boy you are !" went on Aunt Harriet. " Have
you no lessons to learn'l You learn nothing at Miss Martin's."
" Not very much, aunt," said Stephen. " She never will
answer my questions. I asked her to-day whether she didn't
think Christian in the 'Pilgrim's Progress' a very bad man for
running away from his wife, and she called me a wicked boy, and
made me stand on the form."
" She ought to have given you a good whipping, sir," said his
aunt. " What had that to do with your lessons? Go and learn
your spelling directly."
" He's a very tiresome boy," said his grandmother in her
oracular way.
Stephen got u , took Carpenter's Spelling-Book in his hand,
and retreated. it was a soft summer evening, and the boy
wandered down through garden and orchard into the tanyard
beyond. Thence he found his way to the brook, and strolled
along its margin through the meadows, which were rimmed with
the fainting ush of sunset. He loitered and dreamed. With
this child the difference between reality and dream was indis-
tinctly marked. His waking fancies, his dreams of the early
morning, were often more real to him than his ndfather's
stern presence or his maiden aunt's endless scold. e read over
and over again all the books that he found readable among the

he would have had " Robinson Crusoe " and the " Arabian
Nights "would have voyaged with Sindbad, and gone under-
ground with Aladdin. But the only books he could nd were
Milton's "Paradise Lost" and the works of John Bunyan, and
these he almost knew by heart. He loved to identify himself
with the characters. He had, it must be confessed, great sym-
pathy with Satan in the epic, and liked to fancy himself the
exploring arch-end, win 'ng his way through chaos. But often
he was Abdiel the faith ul, or Ithuriel, with the keen spear of
truth; and this very evening, as the sun sank to the verge, he
had ima 'ned himself Uriel whom John beheld from Patmos.
He reve led also in Ezekiel's visions, and in the A calypse.
Otten his imagination upbuilt that glorious city of go] with its
twelve gates, each one rl, and its clear river owing from the
great white throne, mystic atmosphere of peace and joy.
As tonight he mooned along, dreaming of an t ing but words
of three syllables, a shout amused him to rea 'ty. It was the
voice of his cousin Charles, a youngster about a year his junior.
" Hullo, Steve ! Where are you going? Supper's ready.
Aunt Harriet's been looking for you everywhere."
" All right," said Stephen wearily. " I'm coming."
"She isn't in a temper, I don't think. You'll catch it. Grand-
father isn't at home."
Mr. Langton would not tolerate his daughter's scolding, so his
presence was alwa s a relief to the children.
" Where is he 7' asked Ste hen.
" Gone down to the Half-h oon to smoke. Aunt asked him if
he'd be late, and he told her to mind her own business."
Stephen heartily wished she would.
The boys entered the parlour together. Bread and cheese and
cider made up the supper, and Uncle Tom and Uncle Charles,
both of whom were their father's partners, and lived on the pre-
misss, were pegging away at it. So were their wives and children.
SO was Aunt Harriet, looking very unamiable.
" Stephen," she said, "you are the most tiresome child. Why
can't you come in at the right time? I've a great mind to send
you to bed without supper."
" Oh, let him have something to eat and drink," said Uncle
Tom, who was the genial uncle.
"Better give him a ood horse-whipping," said Uncle Charles,
who was the erce unc e, and ogged is own children unmerci-
fully.
" He's a dreadfully troublesome boy," said the oracular voice
from the side-table.
" Come and sit by me, Steve," said his blackeyed and black-
haired cousin Mary, a pretty little girl of eight.
Stephen accepted the invitation, and was suffered to eat his
su per in peace.

to look after them ; the old grandmother had also retired. The
two uncles and the maiden aunt were holding half-whispered
converse, the men being supplied with long pipes and hot brandy
and water.
"That boy, Ste hen, must be sent to boardin school," said
Aunt Harriet. " e's very much in the way at ome, and he
ought to be learning something."
" So he ought," said Uncle Tom ; " but then it'll cost so much."
" Not above twenty pounds a year," said Aunt Harriet. " And
he must be brought up to be a clerk or something. He'll never
make a tanner."
" I don't mean that he shall," said Uncle Charles.
" Why not "I " asked his brother.
" Why not? As if there weren't enough besides him to make
tanners of ! D'ye think that tanyard 'ill keep a regiment of
Lengtons 'l "
"That's true," said Tom, whose intellect moved more slowly
than his brother's. " Well, where had he better go?"
" I've thought about that," said the aunt. " You know Parson
Sadbrooke, that was drowned bathing. Well, his school at
Kingsleat is going on. I saw Amelia Sadhrooke at market to-
day, and she said her mamma, as she calls her, the affected thing,
had hired another young parson to teach the school."
" But why should we, who are Dissenters, send the boy to a
Church school 1 " asked Uncle Tom.
" Oh, he's very young yet," said Miss Langton.
" It can't matter much for the present, and Amelia says they're
going to be very cheap." 
" What's the person's name 7" asked Uncle Charles.
0 " She did tell me, but I forgetsomething like Verily; for I
thought of 'Verily, verily, I say unto thee.' But he's a very
clever young man."
"Is he?" said Charles Langton. "Well, I hope he'll make
the youngP scamp of some use. I suppose father won't object."
"Not e," said Harriet. "I'll ask him about it to-night, if
he's not very late."
Presently the men also went off to bed, and Miss Harriet sat
alone, reading a battered copy of Baxter's " Saint's Best." The
Langtons of this generation were very religious. The family had
a curious habit of being very wild in one generation, and very
tame in the next. Its present head bore the reputation of being
the most thorough reprobate the Langtons had ever had amongst
them ; women and wine, horse-racing and cock-ghting, had
im overished without taming him; at sixty-ve he was just as
rec less as ever, and his mad orgies and desperate deeds were
proverbial. So his sons and daughters had all shown exemplary
iety, externally at least: he being a regular church-goer, they
llad unanimously deserted to a peculiarly rabid conwnticle, and
their Calvinism was of the most rigorous type, and their idea of

the future world for all who differed from them the hottest poe-
aible. It might be predicted that their children would relapse
into the old gentleman's ways.
Aunt Harriet waited about an hour for her father. He came
at last, earlier than usual, bringing in with him a strong smell
of tan and tobacco. He was about ve feet nine inches high,
very broad in the shoulders, very deep in the chest, with arms
and thighs and calves of muscular proportions. He wore an old-
fashioned dee - ocketed blue coat with brass buttons, but almost
all the rest oi) is costume was leather. The long waistcoat was
leather, tanned with the hair on it; he wore leather breeches
and top-boots. He came in, riding-whip in hand, ung himself
heavily into a great leather chair which he always occupied, and
exclaimed
" You up Harry'l Then get me some hot brandy and water,
and be quick about it."
" The kitchen re is out, I ex ct, father."
"The kitchen re be d Light it again, if that's all.
What good are you '8 "
Mr. Langton's frequent oaths may as well be imagined in his
future conversations. There is this to be said for him, that he
always apologised if he happened to swear in the presence of a
clergyman.
His daughter soon returned with the brandy and water.
"A nice Christian young woman you are for an excuse," said
old Inngton, to whom his children's devotion to Dissent was
supremely ridiculous. " Does your snivelling parson teach you
totell lies to your father? It used to be ' Honour your father
and mother' when I was a boy."
"I was afraid the re would be out, really, father."
" Were you! More likely afraid I should drink too much
brandy. Children would like to keep their fathers in order
now-a-days. Can't do it with me though, can you, Miss Harriet?
And, now I think of it, what are on stoppin u so late for to-

" Nothing, father, nothing at all. I was reading."
The truth is that, nding her father unusually cantankerous,
she was afraid to enter on the question of Stephen's going to
school, lest he should decide against it from sheer caprice. But
she could not quiet the old gentleman.
" Reading, miss? eh? ho, no, that won't do. You haven't
been seeing a sweetheart, have you? No, you're too old for that,
I'm afraid. Perhaps there is one toomen are such asses ; come,
where is he? In the clock 2 "
" Well, father, if you must know," she said, " I wanted to have
a word with you about Stephen's going to school."
" Upon my life !" exclaimed Mr. Langton, bursting into a roar
of laughter, " this is good. Oh, I like you canting people.

and all for no purpose in the world. l've a great mind to send

and give you a precious good tanning before his face. I WILL,

He slapped his mighty st upon the oak table, and lay back
in his great black chair lauvhing a Titanic laugh. But it was
no joke to Aunt Harriet. if little Stephen had seen her, he
would have felt that he was avenged.
" Don't, father, don't ! " she cried, bursting into tears, and
throwing herself at his feet in an agony of terror; for the vehe-
ment old man's caprices were uncontrollable by public opinion,
and he was quite as capable of castigating his daughter as if she
had been a quarter of a century younger than she was. So she
was in mortal fear, and could say nothin but" Don't, father,
don't; I'll never do it again"just as if Ehe had changed places
with her little niece Mary.
But the old man had laughed himself into a better temper.
" Never mind, Harry, I'll let you off this time. And now
hold your blubbering and tell me what's all this about Steve."
" We all think he on ht to go to a good school, father. He's
getting a big boy, and he s learning nothing."
" Well, isn't Charley getting a big boy too '1"
"Charles isn't as quick as Stephen," she said. '
" That's true," he said emphatically. " Charley 'll be just such
another fool as his father. Well, where d'ye mean to send the
lad l "
" To Mrs. Sadbrooke's, at Kingsleat. She's going to keep on
the school."
" Oh, you've had sense enough to choose a Church school, have
you? Well, he may go as soon as you like. When does the
school open 1"
" This day week, father."
" Very well; Tom can drive him over. He needn't go to Miss
Martin's again. Now get me some more brandy and water, and
be off to bed."
Aunt Harriet obeyed orders this time with exemplary prom -
titude. When she got up to her room she almost fainted; s e
had obtained what she wanted, but she had been thoroughly
frightened. And, with strange mental obliquity, she blamed her
poor little nephew for her sufferings.
" He'll have a week's holiday, the little brat," she thought to
herself ; "and I' can't have him to lessons, he's so terribly trou-
blesome and dgety. Well, I'll write and ask Mrs. Sadbrooke
to call, and I'll tell her he must be kept strict, and well punished

Thus amisbly meditated Miss Harriet while she unlsced her
stays ; and when she ot to bed she found sleep impossible, and,
if she fell into a half oze, had horrid dreams of the minister and
deacons of Bethesda Chapel in full assembly, and her father,
horsewhi in hand. ready to give her the threatened " tanning."
Meanw ile Stephen, sound asleep by his cousin Charles, was in
Fairyland, and the Queen of the Fairies had a pretty infantile face,
with tender brown eyes, and a little outing rosebud of a mouth,
and glossy curls of chestnut haira ace of which he dreamed by
day and night. And in the morning Stephen had his pleasantest
time: for a clangorous bell always awoke him at six, when it
called the men to work in the tanyard ; and he had a delightful
hour of morning dreams, in which will and fancy united to pro-
duce visions most exquisite ; and when dressed, if he went to the
great window on the staircase, he could see at a window the very
face of his dreams, fresh and rosy from its morning bath, and a
plump dimpled hand was kissed to him. All this took place in
its usual order on the following morning; and Stephen came
(10va to breakfast as joyous as a young lar , eager for Gesang mid
Loft. Even his aunt s acidulated countenance did not make
him uncomfortable. ' -
Old Mr. Langton seldom breakfasted with his family. He had
a large back parlour, looking out upon the courtyard, whence he
could watch the trafc to and from the tanyard. On a sideboard
in- this room he always keptaround of salt beef, and imme-
diately below a barrel of home-brewed ale; and at about six
o'clock, after two or three slices of the beef and about a uart of
the beer, the old tanner went forth to his day's wor He
thoroughly knew his business. He was the best tanner in the
county, and the Langton butts were famous in those days when
leather lasted longer than most things. He kept everybody hard
at work, his two sons not excepted. The worst of it was that he
spent his money faster than he made it.
In the midst of breakfast on the present occasion, however, the
old gentleman strode in, sat down in his great chair, and said to
Mary Lsngton, Uncle Tom's daughter
" Polly, draw me a mug of ale."
Mary was his favourite child; a sweet little creature, whose
perfect temper and wondrous docility made sage gossips remark
that she was too good to live. She went for the ale, while Aunt
Harriet looked on in some anxiety, remembering the scene of the
previous evening. The thirsty Old tanner poured the contents of
the tankard down his throat, and then said-
" What day is Steve to go to school, Harry 1 "
" Next Thursday, father."
Ste hen's blue wondering eyes were very wide open.
" 1 right: I'll drive him over; I want to goto Kingsieat.
What do you think I heard last night at the Half-Moon, Tom 3"
" Good news, I hope 1" said his son.

"Not particularly good, nor yet had either. Devil Branc-
combe's back at Kingsleat"
" Not living at the house l " said Tom.
"Nothimy could live there buts rat," said his father. "No,
he's taken the old place at the top of the street."
"What can he want down here 7 " asked Charles.
" I don't think he's likely to tell you, or me either," said his
father. "But I shall like to see the Squire ; so I mean to drive
Steve over to Widow Sadbrooke's, where he's going to school I
suppose you've no objection, Harriet l "
Stephen seldom listened to anything anybody said, being occu-
pied with his own dreams; but now he had been wide awake,
drinking in the amazing news. He wasn't at all sorry to go to
school, lint for two things. He couldn't expect to meet his
father at Kingsleat, and he should never seeher. Like most
precocious boys, he felt indistinctly conscious that his intellect
required guidance which it did not receive. And the atmosphere
of his grandfather's house oppressed him, and Aunt Harriet
tortured him. Still, to his temperament, in every day there
were long hours of happiness. And he was haunted by one
vision from which he must be entirely severed.
Breakfast over, Aunt Harriet summoned all the children to a
room upstairs, where she acted as schoolmistress. She called
Stephen to come also, but her father said
" Let the boy run about these few days. He don't want your
lessons now."
So she gathered her little tribe, who sat upright and unhappy
round along table, at the head of which Miss Harriet herself
took up an imposing position. A portentous pile of books was
before her, and close to her hand lay a rod ravished from the
branches of that most beautiful silver-rinded tree, whose pendu-
luus boughs the oet loves to see kissing the stream. It had
been well uxd, t at rod, and found farther use this morning,
Poor little Mary, whom no human being had ever equitably
accused of doing wrong, was the chief victim ; what schoolmaster
or mistress ever found any diiculty in discOVering faults worthy
of punishment in children whom they wished to punish? Now
Mary Langton was the only one her grandfather ever petted;
whence Miss Harriet's plagose propensity. The boys whispered
to each other that aunt was as cross as two sticks, and had got
out on the wrong side of the bed: we, who know what that
charming person had endured, have no need to form theories
about the matter. 'Twas a happy moment for those young folks
when, red-eyed, red-earcd, hot, and stupid, and sore on various
parts of their bodies, they escaped at twelve o'clock. I should
like to know what will happen in the next world to those who
tyrannise over children in this.
Meanwhile Stephen was having a delightful dreamy morning.
Finding himself free, he went down to the cathedral, and sat in

the nave, listening to the music of the choir. Then he went
away across green meadows to a weir on the Idle, where he
stripped, and got under the swift fresh tumbling water, and had
a most delicious douche-bath. Then he lay in the shadow of a
great lime-tree on the bank, drinking in the buaut of the sunny
morning, and the music of the gushing water, an dreaming of
his fairy sweetheart
Only a few months earlier. a pretty little girl, about six years
old had come to Miss Martin's academy. She was the daiutiest
little thing, daintin dressed. Ste hen thought he had never
beheld such a gem of beauty. A ootman was wont to bring
her in the morning and take her home when school was over;
but one day the footman dill not come. It was a frosty morning,
and the r fellow had slip d on a. slide and sprained hi!
ankle. e little girl set off a one ; Stephen followed her a few
paces 011'. The ground was dumb with snow; and, in a wide
open space which she had tocross, the
making huge snowballs, and occasion y pelting the sengers.
Those school boys were the dread of all at er young
folk in Idlechester; they were athletic, audacious, heroic; they
had distinguished themselves that morning by attacking the
young ladies of Miss Christy's seminary, who were walking deco-
rously three and three, and putting the governesses to ight
with well-aimed snowballs, and actually kissing one or two of
the prettiest girls. Stephen Langtm was too sensitive and
imaginative a boy to have much physical courape. His delicate
nerves shrank from a black eye or a demolishe nose. He was
not uncommonly called a coward. Now, when the schoolboy
rioters saw a pretty little girl coming, they surrounded her in an
instant, and sat her upon the top of a monster snowball, about
six feet high. It was a damp and chilly elevation, and she began
to cry. Stephen rushed forward to interfere, and was greeted
with a sharp smack in the face, and cries of "Young snob."
"If I'm a snob," he exclaimed to the boy who had struck
him, "you're no gentleman, or you wouldn't behave so to a
young lady."
The argument, stran e to say, found a hearing; the child was
liberated, and Stephenamd the leasure of bringing her safely to
her father's house. It was the large house exactl opposite his
grandfather's; but a house of quite a different character. No
business ever intruded there. A small lawn divided it from the
street. Ste vhen would have left his charge at the front door, but
the young dy would not let him. "Come in and see papa,"
she said; and in a few moments he was sitting in a superb
library by a noble re, with a slice of marvellous cake in his
hand, and a glass of some strange nectar by his side. And the
young lady of six, who melted oil the snow from her silk frock,
and watched him eat, was no other than our heroine

CHAPTER II.
In mom was normrsr.
NNE'S father sat by the re also. I A slender man, of middle
height, a thoroughbred gentleman, with abundance of crisp
curly hair, as white as the snow which lay in the streets. His
countenance was mild and calm, his prole ure Greek, his
hands were transparently white, with long slen er lbert-nailed
ngers, which seemed intended to do some work of extreme deli-
cacy and difcmmd indeed such was their occupation. Mr.
Page, a man of n fortune, devoted himself entirely to the
study of botany, and was one of the greatest authorities in the
science. He did not, however, adhere entirely to the hortus sicqu
de artment; he had in his beautiful gardensthe wonder of
Id echestera unique collection of foreign and unusual plants,
and his conservatories were unequalled by an private gentle-
man in England. A leasant odour of exotic owers strove for
the mastery with the ragrance of Russia bindings in this library.
The signs of opulence and taste in the room struck'Stephen's
sensitive fancy with delight. The boy had never seen so many
books, such beautiful pictures, such graceful plants, and gorgeous
blossoms. The silver salvers and richly-cut decanters amazed
him ; so did the luscious cakes and rare wines. To Stephen this
was Fairyland, and sweet Anne Page its proper queen. From
that time he dreamt of her night and day. She was the lady of
his visions.
Mr. Page was very kind to him, and thanked him for taking
care of Anne, and told him that he had known his mother very
well (which he had to his cost), and asked him to come and see
him when be pleased. And Ste hen and the little girl struck
up an immediate friendship. S e showed him all her dearest
toys. So, in the course of time, it became an understood thing
that the footman need not fetch Anne from Miss Martin's~
Stephen would take care of her. And he used to bring her home
regularly, and often go in with her, and on half-holidays loiter
with her through the paths of Mr. Page's gardens, wondering
always at the strange beauty of the tropical plants in his conser-
vatories, of the foreign birds in his aviaries.
Stephen left the banks of the Idle that morning in good time
to fetch his young mistress at twelve from Miss Martin's, and as
they came homewards he told her the news.
" 0 Stephen!" she said, "you mustn't go. What can I do
without you '3 "
" I am afraid I must," he said sadly.
" Well, I shall ask papa," she answered, being at the age when
childhood believes in papa's omnipotence.

Mr. Page, of course, told his young friend that going to school
was the very best thing for him, and then sent him over to ask
his Aunt Harrietto let him stav and dine. That amiable lady
snarled something about Anne Page being " a pert little hussy,"
but ve permission. And for the brief, the too brief week
whic intervened, Stephen and Anne had plenty of pleasant play
in Mr. Pa 's glorious gardens. It was an Elysian period to the
visionary oy.
Years before, Mr. Page had very deeply loved,a little blue-
eyed fair-haired irt called Am Wexford. Keen-sighted in
most matters, he did not perceive ow foolish a creature he had
taken to his heart. He told his love, and she accepted him:
she was not the 'rl to refuse some thousands at year, though she
privately remar ed to her gossiping acquaintance that he was
old enough to be her fatherhe was about ten years her senior.
Though engaged to him, she reserved the right of irtation, and
was abetted therein by young Langton, who didn't mean mar-
riage, but who liked irting with a pretty girl when it was not
very dangerous. Now the contrast between Mr. Page and young
Langton was a very strong one. First of all, Langton was about
Amy's own age. And then Mr. Page was a courteous and cere-
monious wooer; his love was mixed with reverence ; he treated
this commonplace little biped in etticoats as if she were Spenser's
Una or Shakespeare's Miranda ; e kissed her hand much oftener
than her lips. Langton was of quite another sort. He ulled
her about and romped with her to her heart's content. e met
her by moonlight alone, and walked with his arm round her
waist, and lifted her over stiles like a baby, and kissed her at
every pause in the conversation. So, fully intending to marry
Mr. Page, Amy Wexford took every opportunity of irting wit
Langton.
Now it chanced that there was a Christmas party at Mrs. Wex-
ford's, and of course there was abundant mistletoe. The scene
was rather trving to Mr. Page's sensitive delicacy. Girl after
girl was seized and kissed so thoroughly that he felt disgusted;
especially disgusted when Amy, whose retty lips he touched as
if he feared to take away their bloom, su mitted toas much oscu-
lation as anybody would give her.
" Now, another kiss, Miss Amy," said Langton with a hoarse

And he caught the unreluctant maiden in his arms, and ope-
rated as if he were washing her face.
" You takerreat liberties, Mr. Langton," said Mr. Page sternly.
" Do I l at's Miss Amy's affair. Isn't it, Amy 1 "
"Of course," she said. " Why, it would be ridiculous not to
have some fun at Christmas time."
" I think you have had too much of that sort of fun," said
Mr. Page.
' " Law, do youl" said Imngton. "Why, Amy would give me

" Of course I would," she said, and turned up her mouth for a
kiss with perfect readiness.
Mr. Page's eyes were opened. Love had blinded him, but now
he saw clearly.
" That is quite enough," he said. " I wish you good-bye, Miss
Wexford."
He had loved her a myriad times better than she deserved, and
it was well for him that he discovered her character in time.
She, disappointed at the loss of fortune and position, took posses-
sion of the tanner's son, whom she did not suffer to escape from
her entanglements. She was dead now; and Mr. Page thought
with some slight tenderness of her blue eyes and bright hair,
which were reproduced in her son. And thus it was that he took
a fancy to Stephen Langton.
T111112 children had a happy week. They played at wooing very
pret ' y.
"I like you, Stephen," dainty little Anne would say.
" And I love you, Anneoh ! so much."
" Well, if you love me, tell me a story."
Stephen was great at telling stories. They were a ueer mix-
ture of Milton and Bunyan, the tanyard and the cat The
children were sitting on a grassy mound, under a great acacia,
whose pendent masses of bloom were musical with bees. Opp0<
site was an oval grass-plot, as smooth as a billiard-table, with a
fountain in the centre playin upon a graceful fernery. In the
clear basin shoals of gold sh darted to and fro, while some white
doves drank at its marble verge, looking as if they too were
marble, and cooed melodiously.
"If you love me, tell me a story, Ste hen."
Was ever such request, so made, re used! Ah me! to have
the gift of poetry, and sit in summer with the girl you love, and
murmur some sweet passionate tale, and see its sadness moisten
her delicious eyes ! What can be pleasanterexcept perhaps an
anchovy toast, and a bottle of good port, and a gossip with an old
crong over your cavendish'l
" nce upon a time," said Ste hen, "there was a fallen angel
who got tired of the place where e was."
" But what's a fallen angel, Ste hen? And where was he 1 "
"You mustn't interrupt," said e gravely ; whereon the little
maiden pressed her lips very close together, and looked demure.
" So," he continued, " he got a suit of clothes made that would
hide his wings, and came and opened a large shop in High
Street."
" Oh dear! " exclaimed Anne, " how strange I"
"And the shop," roceeded the young dissour, "was full of
the most delightful t ings, di'erent from anything that anybody
else sold. And the bishop came, and he sold him a strong scent

that kept him from falling asleep in service. And the bishop's
wil'o came, and he sold her a fan all diamonds, and the feathers
of beautiful birds, that fanned her without her moving it. And
the dean came, and he sold him a machine that made the most
beautiful sermons you ever heard, and he had nothing to do but
read them. And the precentor came, and he sold him a most
beautiful voice that sang in the psalms like an angel. And an
ugly cross woman came, and he sold her something to wash her
face with every morning, and it made her quite pretty, and
young, and good-tempered, and she ot a husband. And a
gentleman fond of hunting came. and e sold him a horse that
would jum over every wall, or hedge, or river, and never gait
tired. An the prettiest little girl in Idlechester came, and e
sold her a doll that hugged her round the neck, and kissed her,
and called her momma, and spoke nicely when it was spoken
" 0 Stephen !" said the little listener, " how very, very
charming 1" .
"And a little boy who was going to school came, and he sold
him a looking'glass in which he could see what his sweetheart
was doing whenever he looked at it."
" (1)h ! what a nice story !" exclaimed Anne. " Is it all
true D
"Wait." said Stephen, "there's a great deal more. By and b
the people who bought all these nice things ot so pleased wit
them that they forgot everything else, and di n't attend to their
business, and didn I: even go to church re larly."
Stephen, it may be observed, was a C urchman b instinct,
and never went near Bethesda, exce t when compelle by Aunt
Harriet. He used to walk off to church close after his grand-
father, so that his persecutor did not dare to speak. And he
spent many a dreamy hour in the cathedral.
"So," he continued, "the city got to be very wicked. And
late on Christmas Eve, when the angels that watch over cities
come down to see that there is nothing wicked about on Christ-
mas Day, two of them were going down High Street."
" 0 Stephen ! are there angels to look after all cities '1" '
" Yes," said the boy, " and people too. You've got one to take
care of you, I'm sure, Anne."
" Have you ever seen any of them'l" she asked with curious
awe - .

"0 Stephen ! I should be so frightened." And the child
hid her face on his breast.
"They wouldn't hurt you, dear. But let me go on. Two
angels were walking down High Street, and through the shutters
of the bad angel's shop they saw a light. And the peeped in,
and there he was, making more things to sell. So ey knocked

at the door, and he came out with a candle in his hand, and one
of them, called Ithuriel, just touched him with a long sharp
spear he carried, and he turned black and ugly all over, and he
and his shop went off with a tremendous bang that woke all the
maple. And in the morning they found that all the things he
sold them had disappeared."
"What a dreadful story, Stephen! I don't like the end. I
liked the rst part. Why dont the good angels come'and set
up shops 1 "
Holiday prattle of childhood, so silly and so sweet ! Oh! that
the Chronicler of Clovernook had dreamt the truth, and that we
could walk back through the weary paths of the years into the
charmed region of infancy ! ,
Stephen's ha py week came to an end too soon. On Sunday
he was allowe to go to church with Mr. Page and his little
daughter, and to dine with them afterwards. y the time the
last da had arrived, he had almost forgotten Aunt Harriet,
whom e saw only at breakfast, and in t e evening. But the
last day did come, and at night he took leave of his friends.
Little Anne had a prayer-book to 've him.
" I asked papa," she said, "to uy me a magic looking-glass,
but he couldn't get one." 7
Although Stephen had forgotten Aunt Harriet, the lapse of
memory had not been reciprocal. She did not like to offend Mr.
Page, for she knew her father wished to be on g00d terms with
an inuential neighbour; but she sorely grudged her nephew
his holiday. And she did not forget to invite Mrs. Sadbrooke
and her daughter Amelia to tea, at which meal the iniquities of
the younger generation were solemnly discussed. Aunt Harriet
was charmed to nd that Mr. Vellelly (verily that was his name)
was highly recommended as a " good disciplinarian "-dreadful
words land that she and her three daughters intended to main-
tain strict supervision over the morals, and clothing, and clean-
liness of the " young gentlemen," and that there would be very
'few holidays, and not too much to eat. Aunt Harriet thought
she had found a model school. Then Mrs. Sadbrooke communi-
cated her delight that Mr. Vellelly was much itted with the
small-pox, and uinted abominably, so that t ere was little
fear of either of er daughters falling in love with him; and
whispered her dread that her youngest girl, Matilda Jane, a
gay young thing of twenty-ve, was irting with John Daw,
the junior usher, who was about eighteen, and came without
any salary; and muttered under her breath a threat of awful
punishments she would inict upon Matilda Jane if there was
any truth in it. She was a vixenish little Woman; and she
and Aunt Harriet got on as pleasantly together as a ghoul and
a vampire.
" Law, mamma," said Amelia, " there's nothing in it. Matilda -
Jane's steady enough. She thinks Mr. Daw a mere boy."
## p. 15 (#25) ##############################################
MR. PAGE THE BOTANIST. I5
" Boy or not, she'd better mind what she's about. I'll have
no nonsense."
"I certainly wouldn't,"-said Aunt Harriet, with her usual
amiability.
" Well, you know, mamma," said Amelia, who possibly had
some sli ht sympathy with her sister, "Matilda Jane's of age.
She can 0 as she likes. She's her own mistress."
" Is she, indeed?" almost screamed Mrs. Sadbrooke. "Not
while she's in my house, I'll let her know. She may go away if
she likes, the huss ; but if she stays in my house, and talks to
that John Daw, I' --well, you'll see what I'll do. You'd better
tell her so ; it'll be a warning to her. And don't you be imper~
tinent to me, Miss Amelia, or you'll nd out you're not your
own missus, though you are thirty years old."
" I am very sorry, mamma, really," said Miss Sadbroolte.
"Oh yes! That's the way with girls now-a-days. They
say something impudent to their betters, and then say they're
sorry, and expect everythingto be forgiven and forgotten. Why,
when I was your age, I durstn't have opened my lips in such a
way." -
" Well, mamma, I've apologised ; what more can I do? You
needn't go on all the afternoon."
" You hear that, Miss Langton. She's apologised, and I
needn't go on. No, Miss Amelia, you needn't trouble yourself
to apologise, as you call it, any more. I'll not forgive you,
depend upon it. You and I will have a word or two together
when we get home. I don't allow myself to be insulted, I assure
you, Miss Harriet."
" I think you are quite right," said Miss Langton, while
Amelia Sadbrooke, who had risen from her chair, had turned to
the window. Few people would have cared to hear the squabble
between mother and daughter, but Aunt Harriet thoroughly
enjoyed it, and mischievously speculated on the pains and penal-
ties awaiting the delinquent~ It was not with any special anxiety
for miti ation that, as the ladies went to dress, she whispered to
Mrs. Sa brooke
" Don't be too hard on r Amelia."
" Oh no," replied that dy, in a tone and with a compression
of the lips that spoke volumes.
"She'll keep Master Stephen in order," said Aunt Harriet to
herself when they were gone.
Meanwhile he, anticipating no ill, was in the Elysium of a
tpmnquil summer garden, telling dreamy stories to Sweet Anne
age.

CHAPTER IIL
m amuscounns er BREAKFAST.
OLD Mr. Langton drove a fast-trotting mare, which did the
eight miles from Idlechester to Kingsleat in feWer minntm
than any other horse in the county could have done it. But Mrs.
Sadbrooke's establishment was on a byroad, about a mile and a
half out of the wa , The tanner decided to go to Kingsleat rst,
wishing to catch t e before he left home. '
It was a divine summer morning, and the freshening mist had
not yet been blown from the wide meadows. Stephen, as he
mounted into his grandfather's high-wheeled gi , was conscious
of two faces watching him. At the parlour wintfow of his home
was Aunt Harriet, looking at himwith malignant delight; while
in the balcony of the rst oor 0 posite stood his fair princess,
her curly head scarce so high as the railing, and kisse her hand
to him between the bars. As the mare trotted swiftly along the
beautiful road from the city to Kingsleat, it seemed to Stephen
as if on his left hand a row of en s ered at him above the
hedges, while on his right a line of love y cherubim smiled upon '
him with tender brown eyes. ~
Kingsleat, at that time a borough town returning two members
to Parliament, had one long steep street, crossed about halfway
down by a quaint old archway. At the bottom of the street was
the sea; at its very top a large house of red brick, which Mr.
Ralph Branscombe had just taken furnished. High above lay,
amid the bills, the vast ruined manor-house of Branscombe,
where the family had dwelt from time immemorial. ' Once lords
of the manor, holders of all Kingsleat, and no small segment of
the cathedral city, they werenow comparatively poor. A goal
old house, the De Branscombesa house that had given England
warriors and Idlechester prelatesbut too wild of blood, too
erce and restless, to succeed in quiet times. The present head
of the family, who was commonly known as "Devil" Brans-
combs, had outdone all his predecessors. He had run awa with
women, and fought fatal duels, and acquired as thorough y bad
a reputation as any gentleman of good blood could desire. Com-
monly he lived in London, or rather in its suburbs, at a pleasant
villa on the Thames, which he had craflily fortied against
bailiffs ; but he had just reappeared at Kingsleat, after an absence
of about twenty years, bringing with him his son and his daugh-
ter, Raphael and Claudia.
Langton the tanner was one of the few tenants he had left;
he had mortgaged the tanyard, but not sold it; and in his riotous
youth, when Kingsleat and Idlechester had rung with his wild

exploits, Laugton, though a good many years older had been his
constant associate. So, when he heard that the squire was at
Kingsleat, the tanner decided to pay him an early visit ; and his
mare brought him and his grandson to the house just as the
Branscoinbes were sitting down to breakfast
They were a remarkable group. Ralph Branscombe was more
than six feet high, with abundance of crisp iron-grey hair, and a
owing beard and mighty moustache of the same colour. His
eyes were dark and deepset, his nose like a hawk's beak, his
complexion bronzed by years of outdoor exercise. He looked
just what he was, an awkward customer, a man who knew a thing
or tWo.
Raphael Branscombe, a young man of about three and twentv,
was a marvellous contrast to his father. Guido could scarcely
have done justice to his angelic beauty. His long fair hair was
parted in the middle; his languid dreamy gaze seemed to be-
token a poetic nature ;
" As smooth as Hebe's his unrazored lips."
He was below the middle height, and his gure was exquisitely
graceful. Yet this youth was an unequalled procient at athletic
sports. That he could dance delightfully any one could see;
many a girl had thought it the most delicious moment of her life
when he whirled her wildly in a waltz. Angelo had among his
pupils no eye so quick, no wrist so lithe with the rapier. He
was a dead shot with the pistol, a daring rider across country,
a magnicent billiard and card player. Somebody had called
Ra hael Branscouibe " the Seraph," and the name stuck to him.
e was a thorough Sybarite. His attendant, Louis, who
accompanied him ewrywhere, had surrounded him with mate-
rials for breakfast. Claret jug and coffee pot were close at hand;
a chicken capitally grilled had been set before him; sardines,
eggs, pdte' de foie gras, were picturesquer grouped around him.
As he lounged lazily in his gorgeous dressing-gown, you would
not have suspected the latent energv of his character.
What a delicious accompaniment to the breakfast table is a
pretty girl, fresh and fragrant from her matutine bath, dressed in
some cool pure print or muslin! Claudia Branscombe was far
more than a pretty girl, she was a vision of wondrous beauty.
Not quite eighteen, she had yet developed the full ripeness
of womanhood. Her abundant black hairas she looked at
herself in her morning mirrorfell upon shoulders of marble
whiteness, yet with a rosy ush, of form most perfect. Idalian
Aphrodite had not a fairer bosom, nor did her cestus encircle a
sweeter waist. Claudia's was lliat rare complexion which lets
one see the life through the esh. Her black eyes fringed by
long dense lashes, varied endlessly ; they could be sad, or erce,
or joyous, or lled with an inetfable longing for love. Her

hewitching little mouth could be imperious, or persuasive, or a
thousand other thin ; in re it looked simply kissable. She
had not yet acquire the son riquet of " the Panther," by which
she was afterwards known.
Thou h Ralph Branscombe of that ilk was a poor man, he
always 'ved like a prince. A groom s rang to the head of
Langton's mare; a footman in liVery gave 'm admission.
" Show him in here," said Ral h, hearing who it was ; so the
tanner and his grandson entered 318 breakfast room.
"Ha, Langton," said Ral h, "l'm glad you've not forgotten
me. These are my son an daughter, babies when you and I
met last. And that's a son of yours, I suppose."
" grandson, Squire," said the tanner. " I'm taking him to
school.
" Let me give you some breakfast, Mr. Langton," said Claudia.
" 1 don't fanc you'll persuade my old friend to eat our sort of
breakfast," said lph. "John, bring a tankard of ale."
The tanner might have echoed the song of the thirsty member
of Parliament -
" You may talk about measures of every sort ;
The best measure of all is a silver quart."
The foaming uid descended into his chasm-like throat with
marvellous speed.
" I only just dropped in to pay my respects, S uire," he said.
" If I can do anything for you I shall be very gl ."
"I know you will," said Ralph, "for the sake of old times.
And if I want anything I'll ride over and see you. We shall be
here till August, when my son and I are going to the moors, but
I think my daughter will stay on."
" Won't the young lad nd it dull, all alone 1" asked Langton
" Kingsleat's a slow p ace."
" It is not lively," said the Squire. " But she'll get some
society at her uncle's."
" Well, his reverence isn't very gay ; and as for Miss Winifred,
folks say she's a regular saint."
"An you don t think saints amusing, eh 3 " laughed the
Squire. " Well, no more do I. What do you think of the pro-
spect, Claudia i "
" I shall manage, papa. Where does this nice little boy go to
school, Mr. Langton At the Grammar School? "
" No, miss, to a parson's widow's, Mrs. Sadbrooke's, a mile and
a half out of town." '
" How charming! I shall drive over and see him. May I have
him here for a holiday, Mr. Langton 3"
"Oh yes, miss, whenever you like. I'll tell Mrs. Sadbrooke."
Lanwton, who had ears before followed his young landlord as
faithfully as a feud retainer, did not dream of refusing any-

thing to a daughter of the house. It may be imagined that
Aunt Harriet's temper was not improved when she heard of the
arrangement
Claudia had taken uite a fancy to the boy. She made him
sit on a stool by her si e, and gave him a hothouse peach, and
smoothed his fair hair gently with her soft white hand. And
when he went away with his grandfather, she gave him a kiss,
and slipped a half-sovereign into his waistcoat pocket, and told
him she would be sure to come and see him. Here was some-
thing fresh for Stephen to dream of.
A in the mare started at her long easy trot for Mrs. Sad-
br00'e's. As he drove along, old Langton was muttering to
himself. " Well," he thought, " the Squire hasn't chanced much.
He looks as Well as ever, and he's as wild as ever, I bet. And
that daughter of his, isn't she a beauty? What a ash in her
eye, too! 1t'll take a man, and no mistake, to tame her. And
as sweet a temper, to look at, as you'd wish; not like Harriet,
now, as cross as two sticks, and as cowardly as a cur. I wonder
what that Miss Branscombe would say to anybod who told her
he'd give her a tanning l" Here the old man bro e into a loud
laugh, rather astonishing both the mare and his grandson. " A!
for that ho , or young man, I can't make him out. He don't
look like a ranscombe. He's as handsome as a girl. By Jingo l"
he exclaimed aloud, "I believe I've guessed it. He is a girl
in man's clothes, and the Squire's up to some devilry." And
struck by the magnitude of his supposed discovery, the old man
relapsed into silent thought.
Soon the gig entered the gates of Mrs. Sadbrooke's establish-
ment. It was a long low house, pleasantly situate among mea-
dows. Three or four boys, early comers, were lounging about
the playground, not having as yet summoned energy enough to
nd themselves any occupation. Mr. Langton and his grandson
were shown into a stiff parlour, thoroughly scholastic in its
arrangements, where the widow and her three daughters sat in
silk dresses and with smiling faces to receive them. Little Ste-
phen, if he had ever read of an ogrc's den, would have recognised
the ogresses at once. But who, under that lavish amiability of
exterior, would have guessed at the widow's threats to her eldest
os ring'l Who would have thought that Amelia, and Arabella,
andP Matilda Jane were all in mortal terror of their mother?
The three sisters were very much alike ; but Arabella, the middle
one, was the roundest. She had a round head, set upon a round
bust, which again surmounted a round mass of petticoat. How
much of this sphericity was natural, and how much articial,
none but her own family knew.
The greetings over, and the fortunate pupil introduced, cake
and wine were brought in and Mr. Vellel y sent for. Seedcake
and a whitey-brown uid representing sherry Were hardly to Mr
Langton's taste, so he remarked that he generally drank ale.
## p. 20 (#30) ##############################################
20 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
" Oh, we have some excellent ale," said Matilda Jane, the live-
liest of the family, and forthwith jumped up to fetch it herself.
The unlucky tanner took a good draught of it without much
ponideration, and then made a face which plainly expressed his
ee ngs.
" Good day, Mm Sadbrooke," he said, rising from his chair at
once. " I'm very busy, and can't slay to see Mr. What-d'ye-call-
him. Oh, by the way, if Miss Branscombe of Kingsleat wants
Sieve for a holiday she's to have him whenever she likesmind
t at."
He was gone before the ladies could remonstrate against a
request so subversive of discipline. He drove his mare at her
fastest trot straight to the Half Moon at Idlechester, where he
drank three or four tumblem of hot brand and water at a rapid
rate, " to save myself from being poisone ," as he told the land-
lord, Winslow.
" I thought that wash had given me the cholera; I did
indeed."
When Mr. Vellelly arrived, too late to see the impetuous old
tanner, Mrs. Sadbrooke was down upon him retty sharply.
" Reall , Mr. Vellelly, I think you might be ready to see the
parents 0 pupils when they calL It is a. part of the duty that I
pay you for."
" Perhaps he stopped to titivate himself," giggled Matilda Jane.
"That will do, miss," said her mother sternly. "Now, Mr.
Vellelly, take this young gentleman to the schoolroom, and please
to keep ready in future to come when you're sent for."
Whereupon munt master and pupil.
" That young man isn't active enough for the place," said the
widow. " I can see I shall have a deal of trouble with him. He
wants waking up."
" He's a great stupid," said Matilda Jane.
" Perhaps you'll not be quite so quick in making remarks,"
said the widow to her youngest daughter. " I don't allow inter-
ference, you know."
Soon after the ladies dispersed.
" There won't be any more boys to-day," said Mrs. Sadbrooke,
"so I may as well look after their linen. You come and help
me, Arabella. And you two girls know what you've got to do."
Matilda Jane did, at an rate. Watching an opportunity, she
slip ed away from her el er sister to an orchard at one side of
the lhouse, on which no windows looked out. Here she found,
quite by accident, Mr. John Dew, who, strange to say, embraced
her, and called her his darling.
" Hush, John," she said ; " don't talk loud. If momma should
nd it out I don't know what would happen."
Miss Matilda Jane, in her eagerness to meet Mr. John Daw,
had forgotten a certain a erture in the house. It was not a
window, but a square wire opening into a pantry, half under-

und. Amelia, suspicious of her sister, had con-*enletl herself
In this pantry, and could see and hear the lovers with facility.
Having satised herself, she quietly 'slipped round into the
orchard, and caught them in a tender moment. Mr. Daw, I
regret to say, ran away instantly.
" Well, upon my word, miss, this is nice behaviour. And after
I told ma there was nothing in it; and ma slapped me for taking
your part~ Well, I shall 0 and tell her at once."
Amelia didn't mean it, ut the instinct of tyranny was strong
in her, and she wanted to get her sister under her thumb.
" Oh, don't, Meely, "'as the reply. " I (1 do as much for you
day. Now, don't be cruel."
'Well, I think you're a stupid thing to care about that Daw.
But you 0 and mend all the stockings directly. and if you do
plenty 0 work I mayn't tell ma at present You know what
you'l get if I do."
" I'll run away from home, I declare I will," subbed the
unhappy Matilda Jane. "I won't stay at home and do all your
work because of being afraid you'll tell."
" Run away, you great goose, without a sixpence, I suppose !
You go and do what I tell you, or else I declare I'll call ma. at
once. '
Whereupon the luckless young lady wiped her eyes and betook
herself to a long day's stocking mending.
When the tanner and his grandson had left the Branscombes'
breakfast. room, the Seraph gave a sigh of relief, and said
" Upon my life, that old gentleman's loud voice is fatiguing.
Louis, bring me some hock and seltzer, and mind it's iced."
"He's a ne old boy," said the Squire. " I've found his strong
arms useful before now."
"Yes," said Raphael, "he'd make his wa in a row. But,
Claudia, what do you mean by getting up a irtation with that
blue-eved child? He's much too young for on." 
"I like that boy's face," she said. " e's a dreamy poetic
child. I shall pet him, when I nd it dull here. And now,
Raphael, go on with your breakfast ; you seem too lazy to eat."
"I am. I shall smoke. Leave me alone, Claudia, that's a
good girl. I can't stand your op ressive endearments."
For she was standing behind is chair, and passing through
his hair her fair white hands. But she lighted a cigar for him,
givino it a whi' herself by way of introduction, and said-
" Trhere. T hat's a beauty, Raphael."
At this oint there entered two other members of the family,
the Rev. IBalter Brauscombe, Rector of Kingslent and Canon of
Idlechester Cathedral, and his daughter Winifred.
The advowson of the living of Kingsleat, about eleven hundred
a year, was still Ralph Branscombe's property. He wanted
Raphael to take orders, and in time succeed his uncle, but the
Seraph declined. .

"No, sir," he said, " Uncle Walter's example sufces for me.
I'm not a saint, and I couldn't be a hypocriteand I'm sure I
don't know which he is. I can't give up billiards and (carte', and
one or two other things you know of. And I hate work, and
talking, and poor people, and sick people, and old women.
Couldn't do it, sir, for an archbishopric.
But the Rev. Walter Brnnscomhe did it well. His prebend
brought him a couple of thousand a year besides the living. and
he had a fair fortune with his wife. so he was in capital condition.
He lived as well as a canon and rector ought; he gave liberally
to the poor ; and he always had money to spare when his brother
wanted a hundred or two. The head of the Branscombes gave
him the living, and it was his duty to help the head of the
Branscombes. He was a most eloquent, but entirely unaffected
preacher; had a noble voice, and read the liturgy like a Kemble ;
was High Church, but not ridiculously high. He was a tall,
dark, slender, thoughtful-looking man, with very black hair and
inscrutable eyes. And being a widower of uite a re-marriage-
able e, he was naturally in favour with the adies of Kingsleat
and I lechester.
The Seraph had nicknamed his cousin Winifred "the Saint."
She was a very pretty girl indeed, looking a great deal more
like Raphael's sister than Claudia did. She had been in a High
Church nunnery, and liked it; had lived on bread and water,
and scrubbed stone oors, and got up to sing anthems at unearthly
hours, and worn sackcloth next her delicate white skin, and licked
the dust at the lady superior's feet, and made liberal use of a
discipline. She had dreams, by and by, of establishing a sister-
hood much more rigorous than any existingwith staler bread
and atter water for food, and more oors to scrub with older
brushes, and anthem-singin at unearthlier hours, and rougher
sackcloth for chemises. an dirtier dust to lick, and scourges
with more knots in the whipcord. Meanwhile, as the rector
wanted her in his parish. she stayed at home; and very useful
she was in the parish. Nobody ever district-visited, or Dorcas-
meetinged, or Sunday-schooled with such enduring, never-inch-
ing energy. She always dressed a little like a nun, but the style
suited her, so Raphael declared she did it on purpose to be
admired.
Father and daughter now entered together. They were warmly
received. The Branscombes were one of those ne old families
that always stuck together. Between Devil Branscombe and the
saintly rector there might seem few points of contact; but theirs
was real brotherhood nevertheless. 'And Raphael, under his
languid insouciance, Claudia, amid her capricious c uetries,
Winifred, with all her parochial and ecclesiastical cares, ad all

"Ah, Winifred, you little nun, have you got any tracts for
me 7 " said the Seraph. " Come, give me a cousinly kiss; I know

you think it wicked, but you'll like it all the better. What a
pity you've got High Church notions about cousins not marry-
ing ! Providence evidently intended you and me for one
another.
" Don't tease so, Raphael," said his sister.
" Oh, the child likes to be teased, don't you, Winny?" And
he drew her on his knee, and began untying her bonnet strings.
" Only she always thinks it necessary to go home and do a lot of
penance after. Do you wear a hair shirt now, you silly little
saint?"
By this time he had remove". her bonnet and demure cloak,
and laced on the table a basket she carried.
've a great mind to box your ears, you tiresome boy," she
sat .
"Try, my child," said the Seraph. He held her two wrists
easily in his left hand, and with his right bent down her pretty
head until her lips met his. It was a charming picture, and
Ralph Branscornbe said
"Whata pity you can't afford to marry your cousin, Raphael!"
" She wouldn't have me, sir," he said.
Retaining his pretty prisoner, he began to ransack her basket,
taming out n on the table a host of tries, which Claudia
examined and aughed at. At last they came to a stratum of
etters.
" Now, Winny, I shall read your love-letters," laughed
Claudia.
" N o, no, no, I won't have that," she cried, vainly struggling to
esca e.
"llh, but saints don't have secrets, do they, uncle?" asked
Claudia. '
" Certainly not," said the Seraph. " Now, Winny. I shall let
Claudia read all your letters unless you give me another kiss."
Of course he received his bribe, and thus the cousins laughed
and chatted, while their fathers talked seriously enough on the
sub'ect of ways and means. With their converse we have
not ing to do at resent. Devil Brauscornbe ke t his head above
water for a good, many years to come, as rea ers of this novel
will nd.
"' You're a heavy child," said the Seraph at last, springing up
suddenly, and placing her on a couch.
Then he snatched up her letters from the table, and put them
in his dressing-gown pocket.
"How you do worry Winifred !" said Claudia. "I wonder
she ever lets you touch her."
" She can't help it," said the Seraph. "She's madly in love
with me. She wouldn't be happy if I didn't touch her."
And he caught his cousin by the waist, and forced her into a
wild waltz round the room. '
" Do give me my letters, Raphael," she said, when it was over.

" Yes, I did."
" Why, there are seven of them. What a correspondence for a
little girl like you ! Do you tell your father confelsor who
writes to you, and what about?" . '
" N ow, Raphael, don't be wicked."
" Come, confess to me. I'll give you absolution, and the pen-
ance shan't be too severe."
And he forced her to kneel to him, hut did not get much
confession from her. And at last she got her letters back. '
When they were gone, and Hal h had left for a ride, Ra hael
came over to his sister's chair and ooked into her beautiful lack
eyes.
" You've got very nice eyes, Claudia," he said, "but you don't
see well." .

" That sly little saint has got a sweetheart. Didn't you notice
what a state she was in about her letters? And my uncle, Wise'
old gentleman, doesn't know it. What fools men are when girls
choose to deceive them !"
" You seem to think you see pretty clearly,'I said Claudia
" I mean to look after you, my pet," he replied.
CHAPTER IV.
s'rarnna s'r scuoor.
FROM what we have the pleasure of knowing of Mrs. Sad-
brooke, it may be supposed that she kept her departed
husband in excellent order. N ow that he was de arted, however,
he formed a ne imaginary court of appeal; is o inion was
quoted on subjects on which in his lifetime it certain y wouldn't
have been asked ; and when Amelia or Arabella. or Matilda Jane
was particularly "aggravating," and the widow had not su'lcient
energy to take more violent measures, she always told the delin-
quent to remember " her poor dear father."
That reverend gentleman had been a very obedient husband
and a very bad schoolmaster. He lltltl quaint old-fangled notions.
He read long Latin prayers morning and evening, and made the
boys repeat in turn long Latin graces before and after meals.
He knew nothing, and taught nothing. Mr. Vellelly, having
less authority, was of course rather worse. The boys' food was
of good quality, but scanty. One thick round of bread and
butter, and one cup of milk and water for breakfast and tea;
dinner of meat and pudding, with the understanding that there

was no udding for the boy who had two plates ol' meat ; a little
hit of read and cheese for supper. On Saturdays bread and
cheese instead of meat for dinner. The boys were not starved,
but certainly under-fed ; and I fancv this is the case with a very
large number of middle-class schools. Our middle-class educa-
tion is in a semi-barbarous state even now.
Stephen, notwithstanding his Aunt Harriet's kind intentions
towards him, did not get into trouble. He had a good memory,
and learned his lessons easily. He was popular among the boys,
for they soon discovered his tale-telling faculty, and he spun
them interminable yarns in the bedroom. He was averse to
athletic sports, and used to wander about the country in dreary
loneliness. The boys were not kept within bounds, but might
wander where they pleased, if they were unctual at school and
meals. Some of the elder ones, strong ucolic lads of sixteen
or seventeen, used to follow the Duke's hounds in the hunting
season, carrying poles to leap the hedges and brooks. But
Stephen lived apart from all their robust fun, and dreamed his
dreams, and saw weird phantoms, and told strange tales when
a?! moonlight poured through the easements upon their little
a.
One reason why he escaped Mrs. Sadbrooke's notice was, per-
ha s, that she was dreadfully worried about Matilda Jane and
Jo n Daw. For that young lady had been caught more than
once. and had been subjected to such indignities as her mamma
could invent and apply, but all to no pu ose. The widow
thought of sending her usher away; but then e was very cheap;
besides, he was the son of her butcher, who was very amiable in
matters of credit, and whom she did not wish to offend. So an
impartial historian must record that Matilda Jane's delinquencies
interfered with Mrs. Sadhrooke's duty to the rest of her estab-
lishment, and that several young gentlemen escaped oggings
which they would inevitably have bad if her mind had been at
peace. It was a remarkably mild half year.
Our poor little friend's turn came at last, and I must say he
deserved it. Mr. John Daw was not popular with the boys ; an
usher just out of bo hood never is. Now Mr. Daw, being ena-
moured of Matilda ane, gave up much time to his toilet, and
used immense quantities of pomatum. Stephen's class were read~
ing thedrus, and they came it n the fable of " Graculus Super-
bus"" The Vain Jackdaw." he pun was irresistible ; Step en
wrote " Graculus Superbus" on a wiece of paper, and afxed it to
Mr. Daw's coat. Of course the awluvard boy was caught, and the
angry usher boxed his ears with fury. This, however, did not
satisfy him, but he did not venture to excite eneral laughter by
a com laint to Mr. Vellelly; so, when Step en was writing a
copy t at morning, he passed behind him and jogged his elbow.
A huge blot was the result. Stephen was sent up to Mr. Vellelly,
and came back to his place with the dreadful words in his ears

.
" You will stay down this evening."
Now ogging, as public schoolboys know, is a mere nothing,
whatever it once might have been; and the pleasant author of
" Etoniana" tells his stories about it as if it were quite agreeable
as a reminiscence. But middle-class schoolmasters haVe been
in the habit of using the rod with extreme ferocity. Vellelly,
however, was not one of the severer operators. Notwithstanding,
little Stephen Langton, sensitive and timorous, fancied some-
thing far more dreadful than the castigations of Aunt Harriet,
though that lady was in my belief worse than the schoolmaster.
Moreover, there was an air of awe about it. The victimsand
there were about half a dozen most daysremained below after
prayers when the rest went to bed. The punishment was admi-
nistered with pomp and ceremony in the presence of the whole
household, a man-servant taking the part which at Eton is per-
formed by two collegers. Stephen had heard his schoolfellows,
after the iniction. creep up in the dark and go sobbing to their
beds. The anticipation was too much for the imaginative child.
He determined to run away.
It was a half holiday. All the boys would be rambling far
and wide, and his absence would be unnoticed till tea was served
at six o'clock. What he should gainor loseby running away,
Stephen did not consider. Distance lent enchantment even to
his Aunt Harriet at the end of the walk. So, when dinger was
over, he started. "f
As he passed out of the playground, Hugh Thurston'noticed
the trouble on his countenance. Hugh was the leader of the
school in everything athletic; a ne handsome boy, always ready
to jump, or ght, or swim, or run, but quite devoid of scholastic
tendencies. He had often protected Stephen from the bullies of
the school; and, as is natural, liked him because he protected.
Off on some wild holiday expedition with three or four harum-
scarum followers, the ne young fellow paused at Stephen's
tragic look.
" Why, Langton, what's the matter 7"
" Oh," said Stephen', " I've got to be ogged this evening, and
I'm afraid."
" Bah, you little blockhead, what is there to be afraid of '3 It's
rather nice, when you're used to it. By Jove, I'd forgotten all
about i but I believe I've got to be ogged this evening, and
you see ow much I care. Old Vellelly can't hit hard."
And away went young Thurston with a ying leap over the
nearest hedge. doubling his legs well under him, as is the wont
of a born leaper. But Stephen, unconsoled, ursued his way
along the lane, and emerged into the hi h was, and made for
Idlechester at his fastest walk. He he traversed about four
miles, and was walking along with eyes blind to all outward
sights, and ears deaf to all outward noises, when he was suddenly
arrested by a hand on his shoulder. It was Mr. Page's. That

gentleman was taking a quiet stroll, with a keen eye for any-
thing that grew wild in the hedgerows, when he saw his young
acquaintance coming headlong towards ldlechester.
" Wh , Stephen, where now?" he said.
"O h r Page !"
" Come, my little friend, tell me where you are going."
" 0 Mr. Page ! I've run swag."
" Have you, indeed l " he sai , taking the excited child's hand.
'i And why have you run away '3"
"Because I'm to be ogged tonight," said Stephen, "and 1
don't like it."
Mr. Page took the boy into a wayside inn which they had just
reached, called for a glass of water, and poured into it a few drops
from a stop ered phial which he took from his pocket.
" Drink t at, Stephen," he said.
Stephen drank it, and was refreshed. Mr. Page then sent him
away, in the care of a buxom maiden who had brought the water,
to wash his face. When he returned, cool and fresh, his bene-
factor said
" Well, Stephen, you don't want to be ogged, it seems i "
" No, sirnot at all."
" Most little boys have to endure it," said Mr. Page. " It isn't
very unrileasant, so far as I can remember. But did you ever hear
of the 1th that didn't like being fried, and jumped out of the
frying- 11 into the re 1"
" I 'nk I have," said Stephen.
" Well, in boy, it appears to me that's your case. Don't you
think that i you go home to our aunt you will very likely get
two whi pings instead of one i"
Poor 'ttle Stephen was appalled at this view of the subject.
He had not for a moment considered the kind of reception with
which he was likely to meet. He remembered the hard and
stinging qualities of the palm of Aunt Harriet's hand, and won-
dered whether the birchen rod could be more painful. And
then, to endure both!
" You must Igo quietly back again," continued Mr. Page, with
an amused sm' e. " And you must hear your unishment like a
little hero. And I'll walk part of the way wit you."
So, with innite kindness, he led the young runaway back
again, and took leave of him at the turning towards the school.
" You won't tell Anne about it, sir, will you 'i " said poor
Stephen.
" I shall tell her I met you, and we had a pleasant walk toge-
ther; but I shall not tell her you ran away for fear of being
ogged, or else she might think you a coward. And you won't
be a coward, will you, my boy i "
" No, sir," said the youngster bravely, and walked towards the
school, where he arrived in good time for his bread and butter
and milk and water, and ate with excellent appetite. And by-

and by came eventide, with its calm promise of refreshinglrest;
and the bread and cheese for supper; and the long unintel 'gible
Latin rayers in the dimly-lighted schoolroom. And then the
boys w 0 had no unishment to endure went OH to bed; and
Stephen was left ehind, one of four, to meet his fate. The
scene would have been worthy of Rembrandt's pencil, for its
effect of light and shade. The schoolroom, a later addition to the
house, had many windows on three sides; and the bright moon-
light so resolutel forced its entrance, that the few tallow-candles
were almost use ess; and the forms of the schoolmaster and
usher, the schoolmistress and her daughters and servants, were
dim, sha eless, indistinct. Boy after boy came up for punish-
ment; ugh Thurston rst, taking it as a matter of course, and
gathering himself up with an easy buoyancy of manner when it
was over. Last of all came Stephen, who walked in a dream
to the place of sacrice. He felt himself placed in position,
kneelin on a form, and leaning over a desk towards the window
at the head of the schoolroom. He felt Tom, the man who
blacked the boots and cleaned the knives, divest him of that
portion of his apparel which interfered with the operation. He
jelkthough he could not seeMr. Vellelly's arm rising through
the air to descend u on him. But at that instant he sawsaw
through that moonlit window on which his eyes were xeda
dreadful apparition of a drowned man, naked, covered with river
slime. An he shrieked, in a strange wild voice-
" I see Mr. Sadbrookc's ghost I "
The effect was terrible. The widow and her daughters screamed
and fainted. Mr. Vellelly's birch did not descend according to
his intention. Stephen got to bed uncastigated, and Hugh Thur-
ston, incredulous of spectres, patted him on the back, and ex-
claimed-
" That was a clever dodge."
But Stephen, with his mind's eye, had seen that ghastly
spectre, as his ushed face and strainina gaze bore witness ; and
when, in the lon narrow moonlit chamzlmr, he told what he had
seen, even brave ugh Thurston shuddered on his bed.
The widow did not get over her shock until a hearty su per
of cold roast pork had been followed b some gin and water, 0t,
sweet, and strong. The three young adies looked with longing
eyes on this potent and enticing but forbidden mixture : a glass
of it was offered to Mr. Vellelly, but that excellent young person
declined it. And there was much discussion about Stephen
between them. Mrs. Sadbrooke was of opinion that the boy
had seen something. Amelia reminded her mother that Miss
Langton had warned them of Stephen's awful wickedness.
Arabella, fat and frightened, agreed with the widow. Matilda
Jane thought Ste hen had done it to esca e punishment, and
declared he was a ear clever boy to think 0 such a thing. Mr.
Vellelly agreed with Matilda Jane on the rst point, and advised
## p. 29 (#39) ##############################################
STEPHEN AT SCHOOL. :9
that Stephen should be well ogged the rst thing the next
morning, when he could not very well pretend to see any ghosts.
Final] , the matter was left unsettled.
An the next morning brought another element into the dis-
cussion, in the shape of a letter from Aunt Harriet, to say that
she should come over that day to see Mrs Sadbrooke, and in uire
concerning her nephew's progress. She would be at the so 001
at about four in the afternoon.
"How very lucky !" said the widow. "She will be just in
time for tea, and we can deside what shall be done with this
naughty boy."
" This naughty boy " had been remembered by one other lady.
Claudia. Branscombe, deserted by her father and brother, had
managed to exist at Kingsleat. Not a day passed without her
being seen, on horseback or in her pony carriage, moving in some
direction or other. She was pretty often at ldlechester, shopping
and paying visits. She had icked up a most sympathising
crony there in Mrs. Bythesea, tge Bishop's lady, who was only a
few years her senior. She was an earl's niece, and the Bishop
had married her for her beauty and her connection, when he was
rector of a Londorgtparish. He was forty-two and she was seven-
teen at that peri ; they had been married seven years, but
were childless ; and she was a latitudinarian in her habits as he
in his theology. She was a retty vivacious little thing, with
abundant auburn tresses, whicli) escaped in picturesque profusion
from beneath her jaunty straw hat ; and she contrasted well with
the darker, deeper-bosomed, more assionate beauty of Claudia
Branscombe, as the latter young lady drove a pair of frisky
chestnut ponies through the streets of Idlechester.
Claudia, eager for a new sensation, had set up a tandem cart
t for Lilliput, and had gradually got the {risky chestnuts into
the way of it. And on the very morning after Stephen's spectral
adventure, she had for the rst time ventured to take it over to
Idlechester. She drove down rst to the Rectory, and tried to
induce Winifred to go with her, but that saintly little personage
was far too timorous. So away she tooled by herself, with only
a Lilliputian groom behind, and took the chestnuts through the
Hioh Street in gallant style, and drove on to where the Bishop's
Pa ace stands greenly niched in a silvan bend of the river Idle.
Old Langton, the tanner, standing on the steps of the Half-Moon,
said to the landlord
"There, you'd know that was a Branscombe."
She pulled up at the palace portico. Her boy-groom went to
the leader's head, and she sprang to the gravel. The Bishop's
wife came ying out to see the new equipage, of which there had
been much talk already.
" Now, Cecilia," said Miss Branscombe, "I am going to take
you back to dine with me. It's no good to refuse ; run and get
ready."

" What will the Bishop say 1'
"Never mind the Bishop. We'll take him by storm." And
she hurried Mrs. Bythesea upstairs to dresswhich done, they
both descended to the sancti sanctum episcopi.
The Bishop, a thorough ladies' prelate, delightedly welcomed
his wife and her beautiful companion. He paternally patted
Cecilia's cheek, and ressed a paternal kiss (he was obliged to
stand on tiptoe to do it) on Claudia's calm white forehead. He
had just been horribly pestered by a Low Church vicar, who
wanted him to prosecute Archdeacon Coningsby for heres .
The contrast was a prodigious leiief. The Bishop positive y

Cissy I shall send her to school again : she can't keep her
accounts, and is really good for nothing but to be looked at; and
you are always leading her into mischief, Miss Branscombe."
"I'll take the greatest care of her this time, and bring her
home to-morrow in capital condition."
"Well, take her awa . 'm the most powerless of prelates:
I can never say no to a y. Good-bye, Cissy; be a good child
I wish I could go with you."
"Come, my lord, incog.," said the daring Claudia, "disguise
yourself in crinoline, ou've got an apron already."
The good-humoured Bishop dismissed them, and away they
drove through Idlechester. Langton still stood on the Half~
Moo: steps, and Claudia thought rather remomefully of little
Ste en.
"P He shall come and dine with us," she said to herself.
" What a good boy the Bisho is," she said aloud to her com-
panion. " He's just the sort ofliusband I should like."
" He's much too good for me," said Cissy, with a half sigh, " I
am so silly; and he never scolds, though sometimes I feel that
it's his positive duty to box my ears, or something of the kind.
You know, Claudia, I have always been such a child. Perha
if I had children of my own, I shouldn't be uite such a baby. '
" Don't be melancholy, Cis. Everybody li es you as you are.
I'm going to take you to the very queerest placea school,
where there's a nice little boy that I'm going to take home to
dinner."
A little before four o'clock Aunt Harriet drove into Mrs. Sad-
brooke's gates in a high gig, drawn by an animal of the cart-horse
character. The old tanner trusted nobody but himself with his
fast-trotting mare. She was cordiall welcomed; the four ladies,
all in rustling black silk, were to receive her; and over
many cu s of tea they talked about tephen. .

As to Stephen, released from Aunt Harriet's bony grip, he

Claudia, extravagant minx, had given him a sovereign. "And
ain't she a retty girl? Why, Polly Simcox is nothing to her ! "
Now Po 1y Simcox was a red-faced lass who came round twice
a week with a basket of tarts, and whose ruddy rotundity the
boys greatly admired. So Claudia ought to have been attered.
" Well," said Aunt Harriet, when they were gone, "I think
that young woman's impertinence is perfectly abominable. I
never was so treated in my life."
"I should complain about it to Mr. Langton, if I were you,
dear," suggested Amelia.
But this was just what Aunt Harriet didn't quite see, for she
felt sure that her father would say Miss Branscombe was right.
At the same time, she was not disposed to confess her position to
the Sadbrooke family. She was happily relieved from her dii-
cult by the volatile Matilda Jane.
" 0 you think that Miss Branscombe pretty 1"
"Pretty!" exclaimed Arabella. as if there could not be the
slightest doubt that Claudia was intensely hideous.
"She's extremely forward," said Mrs. Sadbrooke. " If we'd
been a set of gipsies, she couldn't have treated us worse."
" She'll come to no good," said Aunt Harriet.
"As for the Bishop's wife, I wonder she can go about with
such a ighty piece." said Amelia.
" What carroty hair that Bishop's wife has got 1 " said Matilda
Jane, in contem tuous criticism of tresses whose profuse beauty
would have ma dened a pre-Ra'aelite painter.
But, unhindered by criticism, the chestnum brought Claudia
and her companions to Kingsleat in good time for dinner. And
then, for the rst time in his life, Stephen dined. At the Bratis-
combes' there was never an deciency in supply or in style.
The soup, the turbot, and Lbster sauce, the roast saddle, the
birds, the Amontillado and iced Clicquot, were all as good and
as well served as if Devil Branscombe had been there himself.
I will not say, as if the Sera h had been there, for the Seraph's
critical power was known and dreaded at home as well as abroad.
His audacit and accuracy were beyond his years ; he would have

She ceased. After a while a clock on the marble mantelpiece
struck ten with silver strokes. She came and sat by Stephen on
his sofa, and passed her ngers through his hair.
" Now, Cis," she said, " you give us some music.'I
" I'm too tired, child," said the Bishop's wife; "and it's no
good playin or singing after you. Dont you think it's nearly
time our little friend went to bed 'I " 
" Oh no ; he need not get up early, and I want to talk to him.

" That was Aunt Harriet." ' -
" Indeed ! Why, she Idokedijps if she had come over on pur-

" I think she had," said Stephen gravely.
" What a funny little fellow he is, Cis !" she said. "What
are you going to be when you are a man, Stephen? A tanner,
like your grandfather 'l "
" No," he said decisively. " A poet.'I
Both ladies lauvhed.
" A poet !" Mrs. Bythesee~ " Do you know what a poet
is 'l "
"Yes," said Stephen. "Milton was a poet. He saw what
other people could not see."
" And can you do that l" asked Claudia. .
"I Yes," he said. " I saw Mr. Sadbrooke's ghost the other
nig it. '
"What an odd child l" exclaimed the Bishop's wife. " I hope
he won't be waking us 11 in the night with his ghosts."
" I am not at all afrai of ghosts," said Stephen, in a matter of
fact way. " I am used to them. They don't do an harm."
The ladies were rather puzzled how to deal wit this young
punter-naturalist, so they proposed to go to bed. .
"We must nd a bed for this child somewhere," remarked
Claudia.
It was a quaint spacious house, with rooms opening into each
other, and Stephen was snugly ensconced in a small room

between two larger ones, in which slept Miss Branscombe and
her friend. And, being undressed, he had to put on a wondroust
frilled night-gown of Claudia's, which Went down far below his
feet. Thus robed, he sank into the softest of beds, and lay
dreamin awake. And Cis and Claudia chatted a little; and
then they began to disrobe ; and
" By degrees
Their rich attire crept rustling to their knees,"
as Mr. Keats has it; and then Claudia felt disposed for a romp,
and be an to tickle her fair friend, who screamed, and gig led,
and at ast ran awa to her own room ; and then Cis came incl:
again for another c at, and whispered to Claudia, " I do believe
that child isn't asleep ;" and then they talked for half an hour
or so about the Idlechester ople, and Kingsleat people, and
who was going to marry wgzm; and then the Bishop's wii'e
grew misc ievously inclined, and gave Claudia a sharp pinch,
and ran away to her own room, and tried to fasten the door; but
Claudia was too uick for her, and pushed the door open, and,
being a good (lea? stronger than the Bishop's wife, threw her on
the bed, and tickled her warm lump ribs until the suppressed
"laughter could be controlled no ongerI but burst into a shriek ;
and then, giving her a farewell slap, she wished her good night ;
and then passing through Stephen's room, she said, "I do declare
that child isn't asleep yet, and it's 'ust twelve," and stooping
over him, gave him a kiss; and nally, she sank into her own
soft nest, and was soon tranquilly asleep.
But the little boy lay long awake, happily awake, thinking of
all he had seen that daycontrasting the sordid school, and its
scolding women, and its eternal punishments, with this large
beautiful house and the tvm lovely creatures with whom his after-

millrace ; the very delight of life makes us mourn life's eetness.
Ah, that we could have learnt the value of time when we had
more of it to spend !
Five years passed and Stephen was sixteen. He had spent
most of his school-days at the establishment of a certain Dr.
Wood, who got his degree at Erlangen. Wood was a tall man,
with a black mane, that caused him to look alarmingly lion-
like. He was unrivalled as an advertiser and a castigator, and
had by those two arts contrived to get to ther about a hundred
and twenty pupils. As he was a erfect y uneducated man, and
not given to ex end money lavish y in tutorial salaries, it is not
to be sup ti) that his alumni were over-well taught. But
Summer ale ourished, and the boys were compelled to use
their memories, if none of their higher faculties, and Ste hen
learnt the Church Catechism, the Eton Latin Grammar, an the
rst six books of Euclid, so thoroughly by rote, without under-
standing a word of either, that he never forgot them again. In
course of ears the meaning of certain parts of them gradually
discove itself to him, and he always associated his duty to-
wards his neighbour with a severe ogging he got on Monday
morning for not being able to remember the catechetic details of
the said duty on Sunday evening.
Wood, being a big man, was of course married to a sharp little
vixen of a wife. Mrs. Wood altogether transcended both Aunt
Harriet and Mrs. Sadbrooke: hers was no whining scold, but
a short, sharp objurgation of far more terrifying moment, fre-
quently followed by the rapid ap lication of a very vigorous
hand. The way in which she would collar a refractory young-
ster, reverse him over anything handy, and snatching off his
slipper, apply it violently to the tenderest part of him, was really
marvellous. Quick in sight, in speech, in motion, Mrs. Wood
was the ruling genius of the school; she pervaded it; she kept
everybody in order, not forgetting her husband. He, in fact,
was merely a negative man, big, stupid, strong, and wisely
obedient to his wife.
Ste hen, beyond the elements of learning we have mentioned,
icke up nothing at Wood's. But to know Euclid, and the
techism, and the Eton Grammar by heart is something, at any
rate. The favourite game at Wood's was football, played on a
wide common about a mile from the school: Stephen, who was
growing ridiculously fast, had not wind enough for this glorious
exercise. But the boy, though quiet, was not unpopular. His
ancient story-telling talent was not lost; it was his wont to
begin a tale on the rst night of the half year, and to continue
it right away to the end. Schoolbo s love these interminable
stories, with episode within episode, 1i e Chinese balls within one
another. Moreover, our young hero had taken to rh ming, and
Wrote love~1etters, acrostic and elegant, for his school ellows, and
once or twice obtained half-holidays fora clever-ish copy of verses.

80 he (got on among the boys comfortably enou h, and rather
enjoye his school days. It was customary to en each term at
Summer Vale with public recitations; and when Stephen was
deemed old enough to lay Mark Antony in "J nlius Caesar," and
actually had the deli lit of addressing his "Friends, Romans,
countrymen," to Mr. e and his dear little daughter, among
other auditors, he was appy boy.
For Mr. Page did not forget him. In the vacations, Stephen
was more at Mr. Page's house than at his grandfather's. Anne
was still his little sweetheart ; her lustrum had not brought her
beyond childhood's delicious days of love and truth; and her
governess, Miss Marsden, had not been able to spoil her. For
though that excellent young person, like most governesses, had
faith in learning facts by heart, and believed that music and
dancing, drawing and French, were far more important than the
classical literature of England, she was fortunately prevented
from having her own way. Mr. Page superintended his little
' 1's education, and would make her read an essa of Elia's, or
earn a lyric of Herrick's or Shelley's, when Miss alsden would
have been dosing her with French verbs, or setting her to learn
by rote the names of all the rivers in Euro . And when Stephen
had his holida s, lessons were suspende , and the two oung
people renewed their garden ramb es, or strolled throng the
cathedral close, and by the river marge, while Stephen told his
stories as uently as ever.
But there were others to whom this lustrum had brought a
change. Old Langton was a trie heavier than before, and sat
longer and drank more after dinner. His sons were slightly
altered; his grandsons were learnin to be tanners, Stephen of
course excepted; his wife still sat y the parlour window and
uttered oracular sentences; and his daughter Harriet was perhaps
rather more mistress than ever, in consequence of his growin"
indolence. Little Mary Langton was still the sweetest-temper
and most obedient of girls, and still Aunt Harriet's patient vic-
tim. Her father and mother seemed to have given her up to the
strong-willed virgin, who was too crafty to tyrannise over Mary
in the old man's presence.
Of the Branscombes, Idlechester and Kingsleat knew little.
Claudia had long re'oined her father and brother in London.
She was the queen 0 that fast world in which Devil Branscombe
lived. Her rare beauty and wild wit brou ht crowds of adorers
to her feet. Willing to irt to the utmost, s e never went beyond
irtation. Many a foolish boy lost his heart to the Panther-
as some coiner of nicknames had called herand his money to
her father at the various games which occupied the nights at his
villa. Claudia was the ayest creature in town, apparently:
nobody dressed so superb y, or rode so daringlp, or rove such
nies as the Panther. Nobody had such a wil , Witching, reck-
ess way. Her career was all triumph. But there were moments,

I know, when Claudia's dark eyes filled with tears as she
thought of what might have beenas she looked back upon
wasted ears, all gaiety and frivolity, without one touch of love.
The v. Walter Branscombe was as placid and popular as
evera model Rector of Kingsleat, and a model Canon of the
Cathedral And Winifred grew more and more saintl . People
fancied a halo or rainbow around that prett head of em. She
was still a little too extreme in her big -churchisrn for the
Rector. There was a young clergyman, good-looking and uent, .
and possessed of a little money, who had started drowsy Idle-
chester by attem ting to establish monasteries and nunneries,
and by walking the streets in a costume between that of a ballet-
girl and a blue-coat boy. He called himself Father Remigius,
and to him Saint Winifred was wont to confess. Almost simul-
taneously, a new dissenting sect had arisen in the city: a little
vivacious garrulous man dropped suddenly from some unknown
art of America, and called rniself " The Angel of the Church
in Idlechester," and established his callus in an unoccupied loft~
His energy soon brought him feminine followers, and among
them was Aunt Harriet~
Such was the position of some of our acquaintances when
Stephen, a lanky ad of sixteen, came home for his midsummer
holidays. Aunt Harriet didn't like his arrival at all. He had
got beyond her, unpleasautly. He had grown so tall that she
could not reach to box his ears, and she had grave doubts whether
he would uietly submit to co ml punishment. $0, per-
force, she 1e t him alone; and he id not trouble her- much, for
he s ent most of his time, happily and not uselessly, at Mr.
Page s. But on one occasion he contrived to get in her way. It
was a sultry, drowsy forenoon, and Stephen was for some reason
spending it at home. He sat in the parlour window-seat, with
his long legs in a chair, reading Chapman's Homer, a loan from
his benefactor on the other side of the street. His grandfather
came in hurriedly and said-
" Steve, run upstairs, and tell your aunt I want her."
Ste hen obliged; and found Aunt Harriet in the well-known
schoo om, but with only one pupil. his quiet little Cousin
Mary, who was about two years younger than himself. Mary's
e es were red with weeping, and she looked altogether so miser-
a le that when her persecutor had gone downstairs, Stephen
tried to console her.
" What has she been doing to you, Polly 'l" he asked.
" Oh, it's always the same, ' sobbed the poor child. " She gives
me such long lessons I can't learn them, and such a lot of serving
to do I can'tpossibly get through it, and then she beats me for
not doing it.
h"?thy, she doesn't always beat you," said Stephen, "does

"Very nearly," said Mary. " I've got all these tasks to learn

by twelve o'clock, and she says she'll whip me if I make a mis-
take, and"
But Mary did not proceed, for Aunt Harriet had entered the
room, and was regarding her with a terrible look.
" So, miss," she exclaimed, " you dare tell such dreadful
storiesyou dare "
And she rushed towards her oor unresistin victim, to inict
condign unishment. But Stephen intercepts her raised right
arm, cate ing it by the wrist ; and not being ready with a speech
appropriate to the great occasion, exclaimed
" Why don't you hit one of your own size '2"
Never before had Aunt Harriet su'ered such an indignity.
She was speechless with rage. The sudden shock of open rebel-
lion made her hysterical, and she at length gave utterance to .
shrill shriek that was heard throughout the house. Old Mr. '
Langton, who was just coming out of the 1garlour, walked heavily
upstairs to see what was the matter. ntering the room, he
looked with considerable astonishment at his hysterical daughter,
his sobbing granddaughter, and especially at his grandson, who,
commonly the quietest of boys, seemed now daring and deant.
" Now then," he said, "what's up? "
"It's Aunt Harriet," said Stephen promptly. " She's always
pitching into poor little Polly, and I went and stopped her."
The tanner swore a sonorous oath, after his manner when
annoyed.
" You ever lay our nger on little Polly again," he said to his
daughter, "and '11 break every bone in your skin. Stephen,
you're a good lad ; here's half-a-crown for you. Cheer up, Polly -
come along with me ; I'm going down to the farm, and you sh
ride with me."
Luckless Aunt Harriet was left solitary in the schoolroom,
thoroughly defeated.
Of course this incident in nowise sweetened her temper to-
wards Stephen. So one evening, not very dissimilar in its
events from that in which the boy's fate had ve years before
been decided, she called again her two brothers into council.
What was to be done with him? Neither of them had any sug~
gestion to make.
" He's been at school quite long enough," she said. " It's time
he Was earning something."
"He's a likely lad," said Uncle Tom; " but we've got boys
enough about the place. Better apprentice him to some trade.
There's Stokes the druggist wants a rentice."
" That costs money," said Uncle C arles. "I haven't got any
to s are ; I don't know it" you have."
" wonder if he'd do for teacher in a school," said Aunt
Harriet.
And she produced a. copy of a certain monthly periodical called
the "Evangelical Magazine," wherein she had noticed an adver-

tisement to the effect that the Rev. Edward Hooper wanted a
junior assistant" salary moderate." There should be modera-
tion in all things ; why not in salaries?
"He's too young for that work, I should think," said Uncle
Tom. " Why, he's only a boy himself; how's he to keep other
boys in order 7"
" Well, there's no harm in trying," said Aunt Harriet. " He'll
be o our hands, you know, and 1 should think the wages would
pay for his clothes."
" I'll write to this Mr. Hooper," said Uncle Charles, who
rejoiced in a ne owing manuscript, and was the chief corre-
spondent of the establishment.
He wrote accordingly, and received an early reply.
Mr. Hooper was a Congregational minister in t ie large village
of Eastford, about twenty miles from Idlechester. He received
six pupils and wanted a tutor to look after them out of school
hours, and to teach the younger ones. The salary he offered was
ten pounds a year to begin with. He should be in Idlechester
on Saturday, and would call on Mr. Charles Langton.
He kept his ap ointment. He was one of the kindest and
simplest of men, t is Dissenting minister. He was not clever,
and he knew it; but he was thoroughly good, and he did not
know it. He received half a dozen pupilsall he had room for ;
and though they did not learn very much, they led a very ha py
life, having plenty to eat, and not bein perpetually subjected to
physical torture. He saw Stephen and; t 1011 ht him young, cer-
tain] but that was a fault that would men every day.
"Iywish I was as young," he said in a pleasant tone, that was
not intelligible to sour Uncle Charles and acrid Aunt Harriet.
" He is tall for his a e," said Mr. Hooper. " There is only one
of the boys as old, and e will go away at Christmas. My young
friend need not tell anybod how old he is."
So Stephen was engage for the end of the holidays; and
Aunt Harriet, after seeing the minister's good-tempered face, felt
doubtful whether she had obtained her end. She wanted her
objectionable nephew to be uncomfortable, and had pictured to
herself a sordid establishment like Mrs. Sadbrooke's.
Stephen himself, not knowing recisely what he ought to
think of his destiny, consulted Mr. age. That gentleman gave
him kind encouragement.
" I have heard of this Mr. Hooper," he said. " Indeed, Lumley
the bookseller, whom I deal with, has a boy at his school. You'll
be very comfortable there. Your great difculty, young as you
are, will be to maintain authority; and that difculty you can
only conquer by experience. And as you will have plenty of
time and of books be sure that you study; work at Latin, and
Greek, and Mathematics ; try to educate yourself: self-education
is difcult, but it is the best sort of education."
So when August came Stephen got upon the box of the East-

ford coach at the Half-Moon Hotel in excellent spirits. Little
Lumley, the bookseller's son, went down with him. Old Bur-
rouhs, the coachman, was a character; he told the most incre-
dib e stories about the places through which they passed, with
an air of grave truthfulness; he was a skilful birdcatcher; and
as they drove through miles of woodland, he kept up a perpetual
conversation with the feathered dwellers in the trees. N 0 man
could wile a nightingale so well as Burrou he ; so he always had
two or three of those delicious birds at his ouse at Eastford, and
a whole college of canaries hard at work learning to mock their
music. The trade in these canaries, bought at about a shilling
each and sold at half a guinea, was quite a protable affair for
old Burroughs. Need I say that one of his best performers was
very soon singin away for the benet of sweet Anne Page?
Mr. Hooper's amily consisted of his wife, two boys, and two
girls. The boys were lazy, good-tempered little rascals; the elder
girl, about Stephen's own age, was at school at Idlechester.
tephen, who now found himself promoted to "Mr. Langton,'
was soon very much at home ; his natural quickness of intellect
caused his pupils to forget his youth ; and, having considerable
talent for mathematics, wherein the worth minister was rather
slow, his utility was quickl recognised. e had plenty of time
for reading, and followed . Page's advice, giving himself an
education which was of necessity irre ar and desultory, but
which perhaps suited his temperament tter than a more rigo-
rous training. And then, by way of recreation; there were long
walks through a ne country, on one side densely wooded, on
the other rising into bold chalk downs that stretched leagues
away through half a dozen shires. On those free hills Stephen,
who had been growing too fast, found health and strength ;
and the delicate child whom Claudia Branscombe had petted
rapidly developed into an active athletic specimen of the human
race.
By and by Miss H00 r, having nished her education, came
home permanently. W at else she may have learnt I know not,
but of irtation she had become an absolute mistress. No sooner
did she see Ste hen than she determined to victimise that young
gentleman. Nldw Stephen, though at eleven he had felt a kind
of poetic love for sweet Anne Page, and though that pretty child
was always his visionary princess, causing him to write many
puerile verses, some of which found their way to the Idlechester
Chronicle, was tardy in his development. Like Philip Hewson,
in Clough's poem, he took a long time to understand the relation
of man to woman. Miss Mary Ann Hooper found him quite a
clod. He could not make out what she wanted. It was exces-
sively provoking. There he was, a ne-lookin young fellow,
living in the same house with her, and she coul not make the
least im ression on him. She did not believe he knew the
colour 0tP her eyes. She contrived innumerable opportunities for

irtationgot him to help her in her studies. to mend her its,
to listen to her singin ull to no purpose. If Stephen had an
a statue he could not ave been less impressible.
At last a wonderful opportunity arrived. The village of East-
ford had not many amusements, so any that offered were seized
with avidity. It was announced by placards and the sonorous
utterance of the bellmanthat a Mr. Villiers, with no end of
letters after his name, would give, at the Mechanics' Institute,
a series of lectures on mesmerism. Mr. Hoo r went and all his
establishment. The audience were deligh . Mr. Villiers was
marvelloust uent, and if he dropped a good many h's, what
matter? He brought with him a couple of sub{ects-a bi man
to do the enduring art of the business, a smal boy to o the
intelligent parts. he big man had pins stuck into him, and
sniffed strong liquor ammonia, and kept his legs outstretehed,
while two or three heavy peo 1e sat upon them; the small boy
read with the back of his hea and the soles of his feet, and told
young ladies their Christian names, and described the interiors
of (people's houses. Then Mr. Villiers went in for phrenology,
an gravely advocated the importance of ascertaining what
children's heads contained before educating them. The Rev.
Edward Hooper was delighted, and brought the lecturer home
to supper.
After sup rthe man of science became most agreeable, and
fairly earne his hot gin and water. He mesmerised one or two
of the boys, who had been allowed to sit u on this great occa-
sion, and performed remarkable tricks wit them. He mes~
merised Ma Ann Hooper, and that young lady made two or
three credits le attem ts at clairvoyance while in the trance.
He tried to mesmerise tephen, but gave him up with the remark
that his was the mesmerising temperament, and that he would
make a good operator. And so uently did he talk about the
value of phrenology as a guide to educators, and of mesmerism
as a remed for disease, that the worthy minister bought a
manual, an a ma ped-out head, and resolved to analyse his
boys' intellects, andp to mesmerise all the sick people of his con-
gregation.
So mesmerism and phrenolo  became the fashion; and
Stephen, himself insusceptible o the mesrneric inuence, found
that he could mesmerise almost anybody. The thin puzzled
him a good deal. He could not get it out of his hea that all
these people who went into trances, and did astonishing things
while entranced, were in reality shamming. But why should
such a number of people join in the imposture'l And some of
them were highly respectable, and indeed notorious for their
extreme gravity. It was not likely to occur to him that a young
lady of a somewhat rigorous Dissenting sect, and educated in the
strictest propriety, might erhaps like to pmtend to be mes-
merised in order to have a little fun without being scolded for

ull'
it. Besides, there was the fact that good Mr. Hooper contrived
to e'ect several cures. One paralytic old woman actually walked
to chapel after his manipulations, not having walked previously
for years. It was very odd. Stephen bought treatises on mes-
merism and neurhypnotism, and studied the Zoiat, and the Critic
-a journal which at that time went in for mesmerism. I believe
it went in for everything imaginable by turns, till at last it went
out altogether.
Sitting in the schoolroom one summer afternoon, Stephen was
solving equations. He had a knack at such numerical conun-
drums, and so liked them. The schoolroom was at the back
of the house, on the rst oor; there was a door down a ight
of steps to a courtyard, and from the windows were seen Mr.
Hooper's chapel, a rectangular building of red brick, and its
rather picturesque grave-yardsa capital prospect for a professed
ghostseer like Stephen; but his developing animalism had
tended to lessen his connection with the preternatural world, and
he had not seen a ghost fora long time. There came a tap at
the inner door of the schooh-oom, and Miss Hooper entered.
"0 Mr. Langton," she said, speaking in italics, " I hope I
don't disturb your studies, but I've got such a bad headache, and
I want you to mesmerise me, and see if you can cure it."
Ste hen professed strong doubts as to his ability to operate,
but iss Hooper was quite sure that he would succeed. So she
placed herself in a chair, and he stood over her and manipulated.
Always provided that a man is not weak in the back or in the
eyes, mesmerising a nice "id is rather a pleasant amusement.
Bending over her, holding er hands in yours, you gaze into her
eyes, and her fragrant breath ascends towards you. Stephen
was rather weak in the back, thanks to his quick growth; but
his eyes were all right, whence doubtless his mesmeric success.
And so, after he had looked into Mary Ann H00 r's eyes for a 
minute or two, those orbs lled with tears, and t e lids gradu-
ally closed over them, and the youn lady was mesmerised.
When Stephen saw her lying back in her chair, satisfactorily
entranced, it occurred to him that he should like very much
to know whether she was really mesmerised or only shamminv.
How should he ascertain? He began by utting her through
her facings, according to Mr. Villiers formu a. He touched her
organ of combativeness, and she tried to box his ears; of tune,
and she sang; of philoprogenitiveness, and she hugged an ima-
ginar baby ; of veneration, and she dro ped upon her knees and
said er prayers; of amativeness, an I am sorry to say she
embraced him. He comatised her arm, and then pinched it
rather sharply, and she didn't scream. She was the most docile
of subjects. But was she really in the mystical trance of

trying to invent a decisive experiment. At last, though a bash-
ful youngster naturally, he thought of something which it seemed
to'him must surely solve the problem. It took him some time
' to make up his mind to do so daring a deed. However, remem-
bering that it was all in the cause of science, and summoning to
his side that royal nphorism, Hom' soil gut ma! ypmsehe posi-
tiver took o' one of Miss Mary Anne garters ! She did not
inch, and.the truth of mesmerism was established.
It, shall I say lought to have been. Stephen, having begun
to be see tical, found it difficult to con uer his doubts. And he
argued t us: Miss Hooper pretends to e mesmerised. If she is
shamming, she would not like to be convicted of shamming.
Now, when I took off her garter, if she had allowed her modesty
to terminate the imposture, her character for truthfulnes would
have been lost. But now, when she wakes, or pretend? wake,
she may of course wonder what has become of th rticle in
question.
And then Stephen had to decide whether he had better put
the garter, on again, or not. At last he resolved to retain it ; so
he locked it up in a rickety quadrupedal desk which was his
post of authority. And the next thing that he did was to start
for a walk, without awakening his patient. He was determined
to see whether, if left alone, she would wake of herself, a thing
which, according to the mesmeric theory, he had learnt could
never happen. 0 away he strode down the long zigzag street
of Easti'ord, leaving Miss Hooper alone.
Now, to reveal a humiliating truth, Mary Ann was shamming.
And, when she heard Stephen's departing ste upon the paved
courtyard below, she arose from the chair in w ich she had acted
her part so well, and stretched herself, feeling rather cramped,
and reected bitterly on Ste hen's stolidity.
" Well," she said to herse f, "he shan't mesmerise me again in
a hurry. 1 never saw such a stupid fellow. The idea of his
leaving me here asleep! Well, I'm not going to stay till the
be a come in, or perha s papa."
So off the oung l y went; and when Stephen saw her in
the evening, e merely hoped that her headache was better.
There was no irtation to be got out of him evidently, even with
the potent aid of mesmerism.
No; Stephen, even when the 111sz had twice passed over
his head, was a mere boy still. His growth was slow, both phy-
sical and mental. In due time he came of age legally; but of
age individually he was not, until events suddenly brought out
his latent powers, and aroused his dormant energies.

CHAPTER VI.
OF AGE.
BY a garden fount which we have seen before, on a turfen
. mound beneath an acacia, are two whom we know. Sweet
Anne Page leaned idly avainst the tree, her broad straw hat in
her hand, her beautiful' air touched by the tints of sunlight
that dropped throu h the long light leaves. Stephen looked
down into her calm brown eyestranquil eyes, beneath eyebrows
of a Iperfect arch, and a fair smooth foreheadand said
" 0 you love me, Anne?"
It was a grave question to ask this charming child at the
threshold of her seventeenth year ; but no blush tinged her fair
cheizk,d nor did the lids drop over those tender eyes, as she
re 1e 
I')' You know I love you, Stephen."
Then he stooped, and pressed his lips to hers. He had never
asked her this uestion before, but, as she said, he knew she
loved him. And her father also knew it, and was satised. He
had faith in Stephen Langton, as well as liking for him. So, in
these halcyon days, the boy and girl enjoyed their love-dream.
It was the honeymoon of the heart; Stephen was trustful, and
ine'ably content. Anne was sweet, sweet, sweet. No coqpetry
about her, no teasing tendency, no desire to quarrel wit her
lover for the delightful leasure of making it up again. No,
Anne Page realised the de icious old word, sweetheart. She was
allJove, to the very core.
Yet, do you know? I doubt whether either she or Stephen
had yet learnt what love meant.
As they strolled in the shade from one garden pleasaunce to
another, they were joined by Mr. Page.
" Stephen," he said, "I want you to drive over to the Kings-
leat Library, and ask Mr. Lonsdale if he has a work whose name
I have written down. It is very rare, but I think it may be
there. I would not interrupt your pleasant conversation, but I
don't feel quite well enough to go myself. Anne should go with
on, but we are expecting Miss Branscombe, and she must be at
ome to receive her."
" I will go with pleasure, sir," said Stephen; and just raised
Anne's slender white ngers to his lips, and then went off to
order out the phaeton. .
Miss BranscombeClaudia Branscombe, unmarried still, though
new advanced in her third decadewas coming to stay with her
young cousin. It has not yet been mentioned that the late Mrs.
age was a half-sister of Devil Branscombe's and the Rector's, a

food many years younger than they. And Stephen had not
ong been gone when Claudia arrived. Time had rather n' eued
her beauty; and, though akeen eye might have perceive that
the freshness was gone which lay upon her cheeks ike the dewy
bloom on a peach in those days when she romped with the
Bishop's wife, yet there was beauty enou h left for a multitude
of ordinary women. And verily the Pant er's was such a lithe
' lissom lea ing beauty, such a erilous charm, such a magic of
delicious aring, of deant tameihssness.
Devil Branscombe was in difculties, nobody knew exactly
where, and he didn't mean that anybody should. The Seraph
was at Bagneres de Luchon, making love to a princess, or some-
thing of the sort. He had a penchant for princesses. So Claudia
had invited herself to Idlechester~and here she was.
"Oh you quiet little darling l" she exclaimed to Anne Page,
as that young lady showed her the arrangements made for her
comfort. " Why, you have grown quite a pretty girl ! And you
are so delightfully youngyou've all the fun to come. Now,
you sly uss, tell me, has anybody ventured to fall in love with
on et "
y ltydid not take Claudia long to nd out her cousin's love-
secret.
"Stephen Langton," she said reectively, when she had elicited
the name. "W11 , that's the nice little boy I took a fancy to
when he was at sc ool somewhere near Kingsleat. A blue-eyed,
light-haired little fellow. who used to see ghosts Is he old
enough to fall in love? Dear me, why, he was a mere baby."
" He is ever so much older than I am," said Anne, rather
indimant at her lover's being talked of as a child.
" s be really 1 Then how old must I be, Cousin Anne? Tell
me that. Old enough to be your mamma nearly, little one. And
where is Mr Stephen Lungton now '1"
" He's gone to Kingsleat for a a. You'll see him at dinner."
" And does he see ghosts sti 1 But there, I won't tease you,
Anne," she said, kissing her. " He only sees babies in your eyes,
1 su ose, as some old poet says."
" hat do you mean?" asked Anne.
"Why, don't you know? Look into my eyes, dear. There,
don't you see a pretty little girl in each ?"
" I see my owri reection."
" Well, that's what I mean. But you see it a great deal better
in Mr. Stephen Langton's bright blue eyes than in those black
ones of mine. Be sure you try when he comes back."
The Kingsleat Library, to which Stephen was gone, was an
ancient institution. Its Librarian, Mr. Lonsdale, received two
hundred a year and a residencea very quaint residence indeed,
the principal sitting~roon1 being over an archway which crossed
the steep street of the little town. By the founder's will, the
Librarian was of necessityagraduate of Oxford ; and the appoint-

ment was vested in three persons, the Rector of Kingsleat, the.
Mayor of Kingsleat, and the Head Master of Kingsleat Grammar
School. After the Librarian's salary was paid, allahe surplus
funds went to the purchase of books, of which the choice lay
with the Librarian alone, the statutes directing him to make a
complete collection of the best English literature. The library
was a remarkably good one, but very little used; only a few of
the more thoughtful inhabitants of Kingsleat ever sat in its quiet
rooms, whose wide windows opened on a pleasant garden. Not
long before there had been an attempt to turn Mr. Lonsdale out
of his situation as Librarian, and made by no less a personage
than the Duke of Axminster. Kingsleat was a ocket borough
of that haughty Duke's; but of late years the e ectors had once
or twice ventured to dis ute his will, and had succeeded in
returning one member 0 their own choice. It looked very
much as if his grace would have to content himself with selecting
only1 one of the two members. This sorely annoyed the proudest
f t e ducal rank. He turned out with slight ceremony a good
many luckless shopkeepers who had dared to vote against his
nominee, and he was anxious to revenge his defeat on several
others, among whom was Mr. Lonsdale. Now the three trustees,
the Mayor and Rector and Head Master, if unanimous, could
dismiss 'the Librarian. So the Duke sent Mr. Drax, the great
Mr. Drax, to those three gentlemen.
The Mayor, a respectable tea-dealer, would do anything to
oblige his grace and Mr. Dra'x. Mr. Drax might consider it
settled, so far as he was concerned.
The Rev. Walter Branscombe dined pretty often with the
Duke, when that nobleman was at Beau Sejoura little gem of
a place near Kingsleat, which the Duke much affected. And a
haunch, than which
" Finer or fatter
Never ranged in a forest, or smoked on a platter,"
came not seldom from the Duke's deer- ark to the Rectory. So
the Reverend Walter was not slow to c oose between the great
potentate and the Librarian, and assured his grace's agent of his
willingness to punish Mr. Lonsdale for venturing to have political
opinions contrary to those of the Duke.
Mr. Drax had knowingly left the hardest part of the negotia-
tion till the lust. Dr. Winterthe " severe Winter," as his
upils called himwas a man who chose to think for himself.
e was a St. John's College man, third wrangler of his year, and
a most elegant writer of Greek iambics. Under his resolute and
brilliant rule Kingsleat Grammar School had beaten in university
honours the larger establishment in the cathedral city. He was
a determined opponent of the modern slop y system which teaches
a little of everything; he held by his c assics and mathematics
with an obstiuacy which lacerated the hearts of the trustees, who

OF AGE. 49
were terribly afraid of him. When he preached before the uni-
versity he chose as a topic, "The Irregular Element in the Church,"
and horried the orthodox by maintaining that the Apostle Paul
was the rst of the Dissenters. He had written a book whose
theologic teaching was popularly believed to be abominably
heretical; but luckily it was in classical Latin, and so the
erudite editors of the Record and Morning Advertiser could not
criticise it. He had published a pam hlet, subjecting to merci-
less analysis one of Bishop Bythesea's charges; and had roduced
a dreadful Greek epigram on the Dean's marriage. is keen
logic, dry humour, and sound scholarship made him more than
a match for any op onent he was likely to encounter in the
narrow arena of the iocese of Idlechester.
The great lawyer was tall, big-headed, white-waistcoated, cor-
pulent. The doctor was a middle-sized man, nervous and active,
always in capital condition, from being a lover of long walks.
Mr. Drax called at the grammar-school just as the morning walk
was over. In came Winter in cap and gown, the former battered,
the latter a mere fragment of its integral form. The solicitor
opened the case very cautiously.
" Pardon me, Mr. Drax," said the doctor, when he had uttered
a few sentences, " but this is a serious matter. If I understand
aright, the Duke of Axminster has some complaint to make
against Mr. Lonsdale's conduct as Librarian. Any such com-
plaint must come to me directly from the Duke himself. I
cannot listen to lawyers or agents in such a matter."
Mr. Drax was bafed, and the Duke was extremely angry.
But he did not give it up. There hap ened a few "'th'ks later
to be some ewlesiastic festival at I lechester. The Duke
attended, contrary to his custom, and much to the delight of the
Bishop, his sole object being to meet the doctor. He thought
that the immense honour of being courteously addressed by M)
great a prince as himself, would completely subjugate this school-
master. There was a cold collation at the Palace. As the great
man sat, with rubicund expressionless face and lassy unin-
terested e es, at the right hand of the Bishop's la y, he asked
our little riend Cis to point out Dr. Winter. She indicated the
doctor's keen and thoughtful face half-way down the table. The
Duke sent a footman to ask the doctor to take wine with him.
The doctor assented, of course. His grace fancied that, when
luncheon was over, Dr. Winter would be drawn towards him by
some social magnetism, but nothing of the kind took place. At
last, by a series of skilful evolutions. the Duke and the doctor
were somehow brought together ; and after a few commonplace
observations, his grace began to talk of the luckless Librarian
Dr. "'inter cut him short at once.
"It is not a matter to be discussed here, your grace must
admit. I will make an appointment to hear what you have to
say, if that seems desirable."

anal-i
The Duke of Axminster was lled with silent rage. This con-
tumacious pedagogue was the rst man who had ever thwarted
him. Still he rsisted in his project, and invited Dr. Winter to
lunch at Beau ejour. The Duchess and the Lady Gwendoline
Araminta were all smiles and sweetness. You might almost have
thought the ounger lad in love with the middle- ed school-
master. Dr. inter like claret, and the Duke gave him a bottle
whose bouquet was like a lyric of Anacreon's. The doctor
enjoyed his wine, and was much amused, for he knew well what
was coming.
It came. Of course the Duke of Axminster, a cabinet minister,
accustomed to perorate in stately periods in the House of Lords,
put the uestion with lofty plausibility. But Dr. Winter was
too keen or him. He soon brought him to admit that Mr. Lons-
dale's sole crime was voting against the Duke's nominee.
" If Mr. Lonsdale had not done his duty," said the doctor, " I
hope that I, in common with the other trustees, should have dis-
covered it without your grace's kind interference. But I really
think it would be hard to nd so able and conscientious a Libra-
nan."
So the Duke was foiled utterly. As Dr. Winter was taking his
leave, he said
" Your was at Eton under Keate, I think 'I"
The Du e replied afrmatively, little thinking that he was
furnishing material for a biting e igram, which should describe
him as too great a bully for even heate's untiring birch to cure.
Such Was his fate, however; and Winter did not conceal the
cajoleries to which he had been subjected in order to induce him
to persecute Mr. Lonsdale; and the affair did a good deal of harm
to the ducal inuence. Mighty magnates like the Duke of
Axminster ought not to run the risk of being laughed at.
At the Kingsleat Library, whither he often went for Mr. Page,
Stephen had made acquaintance with a youth nearly his own
a Humphrey Morll, a nephew of Dr. Winter's. The doctor,
w?) had no children of his own, had made a scholar and mathe-
matician of this voung man, who was now at Cambridge, at his
uncle's college. orll was born full of talent and ambition, and
had already made up his mind to go to the bar, and to enter
Parliament, and to occu y a high position. He was full of faith
in himself, of disbelief in failure. He and Stephen took to one
another naturally, but Stephen could not hel envying those
trained and ractised faculties which enabled is friend to do
exactly what e wanted to do. Lord Stanley once talked of men
who are described as having great command of Ian 9. , when
probably it would be more true to say that languagetlilafe a great

over it as a man has over a runaway horse. Now there are men

too strong for them, and who, pu osin to do a certain thing,
are constrained to do something e se, w ich may perhaps be a
better thing. Mr. Robert Lytton, better known as Owen Mere-
dith, put this fairly in the line" Genius does what it must, but
talent does what it can." As, however, he seems to have borrowed
everything he ever said, I suppose the remark really belongs to
somebody else. Well, Humphrey Morll knew his own powers
accurately, and always did what he attempted to do, whi e Sle-
phen Langton, making vain endeavours in everv direction, seemed
alwa s stretching towards the unattainable. e was too apt to
ascrize to his defective and desultory education what really be-
longed to his idiosyncrasy.
Stephen and Hum lire met to-day at the Library, and the
latter asked his friend) to drive him to ldlechester, where he had
some business. So the started to ether, and talked as they
went, and Ste hen told liumphrey oi; Miss Branscombe's advent.
"Ah !" sai Morll, " I recollect those Branscombes. A queer
lot, rather. But this Miss Branscombe must be getting quite an
old woman."
" Well, yes. I remember her ten years ago or more, when she
came and took me away from schoolshe and the Bishop's wife.
She used to drive two ponies tandem. I suppose she must be
very much altered."
And Stephen fell to considering whether the beautiful Claudia
of his vague reminiscence was likely to have developed into a
creature like Aunt Harriet.
" Are you going back to that dissenting parson's at Eastford 'l"
asked Humphrey.
" Yes; there's nothing else for me to do. I suppose you'll
write to me from Cambridge now and then?"
" I believe youand send you all manner of university news,

In the cool bar parlour of the old Half-Moon they were served
with their amart' aliquid by " Jack " Winslow. J ack's real name
was Emily; and she was the only daughter and spoilt child of
the rotund old landlord; and she was a ne irting brunette,
given to wildish tricks, but without a morsel of harm in her.
Her father was the rincipal owner of the mail-coaches on the
Eastford road, and s e used occasionally to drive the rst stage
down, and come back with the up coach, very much to the dis-
gust of sober and timid passengers. But old Winslow couldn't
be persuaded to interfere.
" I've given her her head," he used to say, "and I ain't strong
enough in the arm to ull her in."
" Well, J ack," said umphrey, " how jolly you look ! It cools
one to come in here and see you this broiling weather."
" You're alwa 5 cool enough, Mr. Morll," she said.
" Well, and w at's the news, J ack'l Have you upset the coach

y " I'm not quite such a du'er as you are to drive," she said.
"Why, I thought you were going to let the doctor's old pony

and Greek better than you handle the rib one, or you'll be
plucked, safe as e s."
"Come, Hump ey, it's no good," said Stephen, "Jack carries
too many uns for you. What is the news, Miss Winslow, if you
happen to ow any T"
For Jack was Idlechester's chief gossip, and picked up all the
fragments of intelligence.
"The only thing I know isn't news to you, I expect, Master
Stephen. Miss Claudia's come to town, and gone to Mr. Page's.
I saw her come in by the coach."
" How was she looking 2" asked Hum hrey. " Very old 1"
"Old! No; prettier than ever she id. I never saw such
eyes or such hairor such a gure, for that matter. She is a
beauty, if ou like."
"Why, tephen and I were just saying how old she must be
gettinv. How old is she, Jack 1"
"I don't know. Five-and-twenty, perhapsthough she don't
look it. Father, how old is Miss Claudia'l'
For the burly landlord had just come in from the bar, with a
tumbler in his hand, and something in the tumbler.
"How old'l Well, there's Master Raphael, he was born just
afore I married, that's over thirty years ago. And then there
was another boy, as diedClaude, they called him. And when
the gal was born, they called her Claudia, after him like. Oh,
she's about eight-and-twenty, I should think. Time she married,

" Pei-ha s her father's like you," said Jack, "and don't want to

The old gentleman laughed uprouriously.

"Why you hussy," he said, "anybody might have you for a
lcrew of baccy and a light."
"Come," said Stephen, "we must be off. I'm rather curious
to see Miss Branscombe."
So the young men departed, and Stephen, depositing his
friend at the door of the bookseller's in High Street, went on to
Mr. Page's. It was approaching the dinner hour. The ladies
were lounging in the garden, where an occasional breeze iresh-
ened the drowsy sultry atmosphere. Ste then delivered his mes-
sage to Mr. Page, and went in search of t em.
He found them in the very nook where he and his sweetheart
had talked of love that morning. Claudia. leaning back against
the acacia, caught in the lacid darkness of her eyes a light from
the unclouded heaven. Sweet Anne Page was gazing at her, as
if in marvel at such surpassing beauty. So siient were they,
that Stephen, who came towards them across the turf, heard not
a sound save the plash of the fountain, and the low coo of a
brown ringdove on an acacia bough.
Claudia greeted him pleasantly, though it was hard for her to
recognise in this tall youth the little boy whom she had etted
years before, and for whom her night-dress had been a \\'or d 1011
long. Both remembered the incitlent distinctly enough: to
Stephen indeed that snatch of holiday came like an oasis in the
deSert of long unhappy school-days. After a while the conversa-
tion grew freer and more uent; and Claudia began to talk
in that sparkling style which only women who have seen
society can command. It was amazing to Stephen, just of an
age to court that difficult learning which is called knowledge of
the world ; while to the innocent bahyhood of sweet Anne Page
it was all very wonderful but very unintelligible.
To a youth of the poetic tem erament, who has once or twice
plunged in the ocean of thong; t, but who stands shivering on
the verge of the ocean of life, there is no deVeloping p0wer like
that of a beautiful and brilliant woman, older than himself,
learned in the world's ways. The bright-winged buttetv,
which one well might deem a mere caprice of beauty aluid
summer's pageant, has its uses in the world, and bears fertility to
many an unnoticed ower which otherwise would never ow to
fruit. Even so, the buttery fancies of Claudia fertilised t e rest-
less imagination of Stephen Langton. He learnt from her some-
thing of the brilliant life of the su reme souiety in a great capital.
He heard from her piquant lips sqzetches of men and women of
renown, men and women whose fame was unknown in stagnant
Idlechester. She knew the great poet, had chatted with the
reat statesman, had irted with the famous philosopher, hail
een the daring heresiarch's partner in the Lancers. To Ste-
phen all this was an apocalypse. To our sweet Anne Page
it was an enigma as unsolvable as the epitaph on Elia Laelia
Crispis.

And Just at this time it happened that Anne had scanty time
to try and understand, for Mr. Page had another visitorhis
mother. The old lady resided in the North, and was averse
to travel, but she had taken a sudden fancy to see her grand-
child, and arrived at Idlechester within-a very few days of
Claudia BranScombe. Anne's grandmamma monopolised her;
whence it happened that Miss Branscombe and Stephen were
thrown very much together. Both en'oyed it. Claudia liked
the innocent, unspoilt freshness of the oy's oetic mind; while
Stephen derived a startling stimulus from laudia's suggestive
conversation. He hardly knew himself; he felt like the aloe,
whose century's sleep is succeeded b a sudden oral develop-
ment, consummate and colossaL e found himself forming
opinions where heretofore he had doubted, and measuring his
own capacities with the capacities-of men whose greatness he
had deemed vaguely gigantic, and panting to join the hot conict
from which hitherto he had shrunk in dismay. As yet his fair
ideal had been a calm life in this sleepy old cathedral cit , with
sweet Anne Page to lay her loving cheek by his, and dwe with
him peacefully.
He had felt, with Tennyson's eaters of the lotos-
" There is no joy but calm I"
But now there came upon him, sudden, strong, irresistible, the
wandering spirit of Odysseus; he longed to see many cities of
men, and to know their manners; t e charmed song of the
Sirens breathed itself upon the wind which reached him from
- those shores remote; he pined for the perilous fruit of the tree
of knowledge of good and evil.
I am afraid he almost forgot sweet Anne Pagepretty little
plump innocent ignorant Anne, in dutiful and affectionate attend-
ance on her doting old grandmamma. He and Claudia were
inseparable, It had long been his wont to spend almost his
whole day at Mr. Page's during the vacation. So he used to
come across to breakfast, and after breakfast to stroll with
Claudia in the beautiful gardens or beneath the great cathedral's
icy shadow; and after lunch to drive her on some leasant road
in Mr. Page's quiet phaeton, very different vehicle rom that fast
tandem-cart to which he had clung in his boyhood; and after
dinner again to loiter with her through the dim' garden alleys,
odorous and cool. Of course there were days when this delicious
monotony was interrupted. Claudia had to go todinners and
evening parties, and to kee up her acquaintance with Mrs.
Bythesea and other fair frien s ; but Stephen had, on the whole,
a very joyous tranquil time \during those sultry summer days,
and its result u on him was wonderful. Morally and intellec-
tually he cam 0 age.
Years after the remembrance of that halcyon time was dear to

him, and he celebrated it in sonorons Spenserian stanzas, "hereof
1 quote the last only :
" Could I arrest swift Time upon his ight,
And from his seat drag down the Chariotcer
Never yet weary, this same golden light
Should always brood on woodland, wold and mere
Always this perfect climax of the year
Should ll poetic breasts with endless mirth
Always the white sky should he tempest-clear
And, like a sea on which no storms have birth,
Summer should always sleep upon the shores of earth."
Now, although all Idlechester was of opinion that Stephen
Langton was a mere boy, and a very silly insignicant boy. it
could not pass by without remarking his intimacy with Miss
Branscombe. Claudia herself, havin dined one day at the
palace, when the Bishop was in Lon on attending the House,
received a slight lecture from Mrs. B thesea on the subject.
Bishops'wives of necessity ow grave an decorous more rapidly
than other women; andglr verily believe, with all Claudia's
daring, she would not now have ventured to throw her friend
upon a bed and tickle her. But she wasn't going to stand lectur-
ing, at any rate.
"Look here, Cis," she said in reply, "irtation is my profes-
sion. When I come down to this dull place I just irt with a
good-looking bov to keep my hand in ; it doesn't hurt him, and
it pleases me. What do I, who have lived in London, care for
the empty scandal of a wretched little country place like Idle-
chester'l' >
" But really, my dear "
"But really, my dear," interrupted Claudia with impetuous
mockery, " you have grown into quite a lecturing old woman.
You're not half such fun as you were ten years ago. I shall do
just as I like, Cis, and if you don't bother I won't quarrel with
you ; and if you do, I declare I'll make love to the BishOp when
e comes back, and you know he couldn't resist me, and you'd
cry your eyes out with jealousy."
Mrs. Bythesea was the only person who dared say a word to
Claudia, but Stephen got chn'ed by several members of his
family. His cousin Charles had grown up a provincial dandy,
awkward and smart; his cousin Henry, Uncle Tom's eldest son,
had developed into Vulgarity and dissi ation. Each of these
young gentlemen had his jest about Step en's being sweet upon
liss Branscombe; but Stephen (who, you see, was im roving)
declared he would horsewhip the next who said a wor to him
on the subject, and they were silent. He could not, however,
horsewhip Aunt Harriet, who one day denounced Clandia's con-
duclti 21s shockingly improper. Stephen, cunning rascal, promptly

"I wonder you don't tell my grandfather what you think of

'l'hat amiable lady knew better.
Walking down the High Street in search of amusement that
afternoonfor it was one of those on which Claudia had an
engagementhe loitered into a bookseller's shop. There he met
Humphrey Morll, looking at the London papers. They left
arm-in-arm, and Humphrey said
"You look savage, Stephen. What's the matter I "
"Oh, I don't knowpeople are such fools. That absurd aunt
of mine has just been abusing Claudia Miss Branscombe, I mean
-just because she doesn't nd my company very stupid."
" Well," said Morll, "from all I hear you and she are pretty
thick. I don't suppose you'll fall in love with a woman old
enough to beI won't say your mother, but your auntthough
she is deucedly pretty; still when two people are inseparable
there's sure to be gossip. And, if I may ask, do you call her
Claudia when you're talking to her 1 "
"I believe I do," said Stephen with some hesitation. " But
there are such a lot of consonants in Miss Branscornbe." '
"Egad! that's good. Come, let's have a drop of seltzer and
Mandy at Winslow's. It's atrociously thirsty weather."
I don't think Ste hen had beenat the Half Moon since the
day on which Clan ia arrived. Jack Winslow received him
with a very low curtsey indeed, and asked him when the mar- '
riage was to come oif.
" There, you see, Humphrey," he said savagely.
" Take care, Jack, or you'll get into diliiculties with this young
gentleman ; he's erce this morning."
"Well, but," said she, " I'm not to blame if peo le talk when
they see a ne couple preparing for the person. must listen,
you know."
"Go and get the seltzer, Jack," said Morll, "or there'll be
mischief done. Oh, here's Winslow. I say, landlord, that
dau hter of yours is getting saucy; you don't keep the whip
ban of her."
The Hebe of the Half Moon re-entered with the icy nectar.
"I don't mean any harm, Mr. Stephen, you know," said she
good-naturedly.
" Oh yes, I know that ; but I'm tired of such foolish gossip."
" There's plenty of it going," said Humphrey; " why, Jack, I
heard that you were sweet on little Tranter, the druggist's ap-
prentice."
As Stephen, having parted from his friend, strolled homeward
alone, he bitterly reected on the immense mass of vulgarity and
stupidity in the world. Sensitive and dream natures, easily
excited, are easily depressed. In Mr. Page's Elysian gardens,
with Claudia's low voice in his ears, or Anne's brown eyes xed
upon his own, Stephen experienced delight ine'able; but the

empty folly of this afternoon's gossip proportionately tortured
him. He loved Anne Page, he said to himselfyes, certainly
he loved Anne Page; and he was charmed b the wisdom and
wit of Claudia Bransconibe ; but what was eit er the one or the
other to his stupid cousins, to Aunt Harriet, to that impudent
Jack Winslow?
And then he thought, how soon it must end ! To go back in
a week or ten days to Mr. Hooper's, at Eastford, and his old
monotonous grind. "'as he to do this, after Claudia's stimulant
converse? Was he to turn away from the great movement of
the world, of which she had given him brilliant glimpses, and
subside into teaching a little obscure dissenting school! What
else could he do? There was literaturebut all his literary
etl'orts failed. Humphrey Morll could sit down and write
exactly the sort of magazine article that an editor wanted; he
couldn't. He felt helpless, powerless, in the hands of the Parcze.
Those grim old ladies who rule the destinies of men held him
as rmly in their grip as Aunt Harriet used to in those days when
his greatest dread was her avenging rod. Surely the Moira were
the maiden aunts of mythology.
" We look before and after,
And pine for what is not,"
sings the divine lyrist. The ever-forgotten and ever-recurring
lesson of time is that what we dread seldom happens, but that
evils unforeseen take its place. And yet men will persist in tor-
turing themselves about an uncertain future; in adding imagi-
nary vexations to the real annoyances of the world. Here was
Stephen worryinglhimself about silly rumoursabout Eastford,
whither (though e little imagined it) he was never to go again
and the real calamity at that moment impending, with all its
train of misfortunes, was wholly undreamt of. But the next
morning brought the news
Mr. Page was dead.
CHAPTER VII.
MR. men's WILL.
LGERNON PAGE died of disease of the heart, a malady for
whose fatal ending he had long been prepared. His loss
was felt at Idlechester. Of immense advantage to country towns
is the residence of men of culture, who stand aside from.the main
oves of ambitious life, and steadfastly and silently follow their
avourite pursuits. Time was, within the remembrance of many
of us, that certain citiesnotably York and Bathhad certain

t can"
famous names connected with them. As a consequence such
cities had a society devoid of that provincialism which Mr.
Matthew Arnold denounces ; and those whom necessity compelled
to reside there, were greatly beneted by the rened and classical
atmosphere of the upper social stratum. But now, scarcely a
great writer or artist can be named who is not a Londoner, or a
dweller in a home county, so that London may be accessible to
him; whence the society in country towns sinks to the level of
those residents whom occupation keeps there. Even Edinburgh
feels the centralising ower, the centripetal forceand Messrs.
Blackwood have settle quietly down next door to Messrs. Long-
man, and the chief Scottish periodicals, from the Edinburgh
Review to Chambers's Journal, are published in London.
In this way, Mr. Page's loss was felt in Idlechester. Of good
birth and easy fortune, with high scientic rank, his social re-
serve had not prevented him from exercising much quiet in-
uence. Great men in his own special line were his f uent
visitors. His incom arable gardens attracted others, who ew
nothing of scienticgmtany, but could appreciate oral beauty.
Perfectly independent, above ducal insult or episco al patronage
or decano-capital intrioue, he set a rare and protable example 01
an unostentatious yet 'beral and thoughtful life.
How can any pen describe the terrible grief which his death
caused sweet Anne Page to suli'er'! It was perha s the worst
time for this child, alreagy motherless, to lose her ather. Just
on the verge of womanho , she had especial need of the guidance
which he alone could have given. Hers was sorrow beyond
words. Claudia found herself powerless to console her poor
little cousin.
Mr. Page, knowing his precarious tenure of life, had made his
will years before, an left it in Mr. Drax's custody. That gentle~
man, and Ralph and Walter Branscombe, were named Anne's
trustees. She was directed to reside in the house at ldlechester
until she came of age, unless her marriage occurred before that
time, and a thousand a year was set aside for her maintenance
during her minority. A sealed document accompanied the will,
and was not to be opened until her coming of age, unless she
should marry before that time, when it was to be read imme-
diately after the ceremony. Funded roperty producing ve
hundred a year was left to Ste hen angton. Legacies of a
thousand pounds eachwent to t e three trustees; and if Anne
died unmarried before the age of twenty-one, two-thirds of the
property went to Ralph Brauscombe, of Brauscombe, esquire,
and the remainder to the Reverend Walter Branscombe. The
whole amount disposed of by the will was about four thousand a
ear.
y I suppose Stephen Langton was more surprised than anybody
else at his good fortune. He knew that his benefactor was will-
ing to give him his daughter, but he did not know that in his
## p. 59 (#69) ##############################################
MR. PAGE'S WILL. 59
thoughtful kindness he would also give him independence. It
was the very gift he needed. It saved him from the necessity of
sordid toil, and strengthened him to act with courage when cour-
age was requisite. It is very contemptible, doubtless, but poverty
too often makes social cowards of the best of us. Stephen could
now isolate himself from the weary vulgarities of his relations.
There are always quaint corners of 1!. Cathedral town where the
peaceful and picturesque mingle. Stephen found old-fangled
apartments in a dark olygonal old house in a queer tra ezium
called Little College green. There he took up his abo e in a
suite of three rooms, all on the ground oor. The front room
looked on the green, and was long and narrow; the two back
rooms occupied the same space, in length, as the front, and gave
on a garden such as one sees in ecclesiastical towns, and nowhere
else. A garden where the scandent plants have'stems as thick
as a man's leg, and the ivy is a monster of vegetation ; and there
are two or three ap le-trees, mossy, gnarled, decrepit, bearing
few fruit, but of suc quality as Covent Garden never knows,
notwithstanding its monastic name. Stephen had besides a
dark dec sh-pond, with two or three enormous carp in it that
came to im for bread crumbs. He used one of these back rooms
as a bedroom ; the other, accessible only through the bedroom,
was devoted to his books and his cigars. For these bachelor
quarters he paid half a guinea a week ; which was thought rather
a high price in Idlechester, in those days before railways. He
could not at this time see much of Anne Page, who had naturally
fallen into the hands of her relations, Claudia, and \Vinifred, and
Winifred's father. So he wrote a little, and studied a little, and
dreamt much of that distant wondrous world whose existence
Claudia Branscombe had revealed to him.
Meanwhile Mr. Drax had made a communication to the Rev.
Walter Branscombe, and that excellent clergyman desired to pass
it on to his brother. But how? Claudia had no idea where her
father was. Devil Branscombe did not believe that girls could
keep secrets, so he kept his own. Raphael might know; but
where was Raphael? But her father had told her that, if she
wanted to communicate with him on anything important, she
was to send to the Times this advertisement
"' Good morning, Papa ! "
It was some time before she recollected this direction; when she
thought of it she did it at once, and a day or two brought her a
letter from her father, telling her to address him, "L. M. N.,
Post Ofce, Guernsey." So she wrote, enclosing a note from her
uncle; and the consequence was that the brothers arranged a
meeting at the Dolphin Hotel, Southampton.

hostelry, from which you could look up and down Southampton's

long, busy, plicturesque High Street, Devil Branscombe met his
clerical brot er. You can always get a good bottle of wine at
the Dolphin, and there stood between them a claret-jug, holding
excellent Chateau-Latte. And thus they conversed :
"I told Drax not to pay over that thousand pounds to your
account at Coutts's, not knowing how you might stand there,"
said Walter.
" I don't think you often make a mistake. My account must
be a ood deal over-drawn. The thousand will be useful for
imme iate expenses."
"So I thought, and brought it with me in notes. Claudia
doesn't want any money just now. She's been living for nothing

er.
" What in the world made Page leave young Langton any-

" Langton is engaged to his daughtera mere babyonly six-
teen ; we can do anything with her."
" What do you propose to dol"
" Listen a moment. Drax "here the Rector dropped his voice
involuntarily" Drax has told me the contents of that sealed
codicil. It leaves the whole roperty in this way: If Lang-ton
and the little girl are married half of it is settled on each of
them. The same thing is to take place if she declines to marry
him. I'But, if he declines to marry her, she gets the whole pro-
" '
" ls the codicil valid, do you think 1 "
" Well, if not, it is no good for us to upset it, as of course the
child would then get everything unconditionally."
"I don't see anything to be done," said Ralph Branscombe
meditatively.
"I do," said the Rector. "That boy showed sym toms of
being taken with Claudia. What if she were to marry im 1 "
" What good would that be? It would leave the little girl
inde ndent."
" ut suppose Raphael were to marry her ! I should think he
would have no difculty."
"By Jove! I shouldn't have thought of that arrangement.
Well, what do you want me to do 'I "
" Write to Claudia; or, better stilL see her, and tell her to
marry young Langton. She has fascinated him already, I fancy."
" My Claudia's too good for the young lout," said Devil Brans-
combe. " But it seems a ne combination. I ought to see her
to ex lain it to her. I tell you whatleave it to meI'll come
to Id echester."
" Is it safe 2 " asked the Rector. -
" No; that's the fun of it. If it was, I wouldn't come. I'll
manage the affair."
A few days later than this, as old Langton the tanner, in the

dusk of evening, was looking round the tanyard, he became
aware of a tall man on the other side of the brook. Rather to
his surprie the stranger splashed across the shallow stream, and
coming up to him, said
" Well, Langton, how are you 1"
" Why, it's the Squire !" exclaimed the old tanner in astonish-
ment.
" Ay, my old friend, here I am," said Devil Branscombe.
"And now, will you do me a good turn? Get me quietly into
your house, and let me slee there a couple of nights, without a
word said to anybody. Wi 1 you '1"
" I shall have to tell one of the women folk, Squiremy
daughter Harriet. She's so cursed sha , she'd be sure to nd it
out ; but she won't split. And there's t e spare bedroom looking
out on the street; you might be there a twelvemonth and no-
body know. None of the maids go there ; only Harriet."
" That will do capitally," said Ra] h. "I'll trust any daughter
of yours, my old friend. But how s all I get in?"
"That's just what I must get Harriet to manage," said the
tanner.
And Harriet managed it extremely well.
The " best bedroom," an immense chamber on the rst oor,
occupying half the width of the house, had not been tenanted
within the memory of this generation. But to have used it for
any other urpose would have been sacrilege. It was the pride
of Aunt arriet's heart. She gave it periodical dustings, and
kept it always in as good order as if she expected a visit from the
Queen. And as she never, except at lustrations, allowed any
one but herself to enter it. it was a erfect place of concealment
for Devil Branscombe. Here he ound himself that evening,
with wax-candles burning, and the best beda great bed of
Ware, almostprepared for his reception. And, when every-
body else was in bed, Aunt Harriet brought up for him a copious
su eran uncut ham and an enormous home-made loaf, and a
mtg ty tankard of her father's ale. He rather enjoyed his posi-
tion. It was a curious change after rusticating in Guernsey, an
island more picturesque than social, where he smoked on the pier
all day and played 100 or billiards at the club all night. Here,
snugly hidden, he looked down upon the familiar High Street of
Idlechester, and upon the house in which his brother-in-law died.
He saw Stephen Langton call t0'inquire for his sweetheart in the
early forenoon, and turn sadly away when told that she did not
feel well enough to see him. He saw the Reverend Walter and
his pious daughter, "'inifred, enter the house; and by-and-by
he saw the Rector go away again, Winifred remaining. He saw
Claudia come out for a stroll, beautiful as ever in her sable attire,
and little dreaming that her father's eyes were upon her. He
saw scores of faces that he knew, and criticised the changes time
had brought them. And so amused was he at his whimsical

ition, that he wrote a long letter to Raphael (who was at
enice), describing all that he saw, and fully explaining the
Rector's subtle schemes.
Not till the second day did he decide to act. Then he requested
Aunt Harriet to communicate cautiously to Miss Branscombe
that she wanted to speak to her.
"Don't say a word to her about me. Bring her up here at
once. Won't she be astonished ! But if she screams, by the Lord
Harry, I'll forfeit a ten pound note."
Miss Harriet Langton acted on her instructions, and Claudia,
considerably surprised, walked across the street, and was shown
into the parloura room little altered since we rst knew it,
except that there was no bright-eyed boy dreaming at one win-
dow, no oraculnr old lady knitting at the other. Old Mrs.
Langton was dead. Being asked to walk upstairs, Claudia could
scarcely do less than comply ; and she certainly was rather
amazed to nd her father comfortably sitting in one of those vast
bedroom easy-chairs which arrided our ancestors. Aunt Harriet
left them alone. '
" Lock the doors, Claudia," said Ralph Branscombe. " You
look surprised to see me. I came over from Guernsey on purpose
to have a talk to you."
" I'm very glad to see you, papa," she said, seating herself
oppositeto him. " You are looking uncommonly well."
" Yes, I don't wear badly, and I've been very quiet lately. But
we must talk of business, child; I think you can do a good thing
for us all."
" I am ready to try," she said ; " but I ho c it doesn't involve
playing cart, for that's a thing I never cou d do properly."
" I want you to marry that young Langton"
" What ! " she said, " why, he's a mere boy, pa a."
" So much the easier to manage. But come, \\' at difference is
there between you? seven or eight years, perhaps. It is a mere
trieand you don't look above twenty, really."
" You atter, Mr. Branscombe. But what good should I do by
marrying him? He's only got ve hundred a year." '
" That's not the oiut. We have discovered the nature of
that sealed paper of ages. If Langton marries your little cousin,
the are to rave all the property ; and if she should refuse him,
eac is to have half ; but if he declines to have her, she gets the
whole." 0
" Well, I don't see."
" Why, if you get hold of young Langton, Raphael can marry
the girl.'
"0h, indeed. Well, it's a brilliant ideaUncle Walter's, I
guess. Let me thinkif I marry Stephen, we shall have about

"And you want to get away at once, of course, hccause it is
dangerous. Well, I'll sacrice myself, if Stephen will have me.
He's a nice boy after all."
" How long will it take you to land him i" asked her father,
in angler's hrase.
" %,m0nt or two, perhaps. What shall you do in the mean-
time '
" Go to Baden, I think, and try a new martingale. Poor Page's
grousand will last some little time, as of course I shau't pay any
cbts."
"But, papa, if Raphael marries Anne, won't it be possible to
make things square, and live quietly again 1 You must be dread-
fully weary of this hide and seek."
" We'll try what can be done," he replied.' "I think my wild
oats ought to be nearly sown."
Claudia left him, and he watched her cross the street to Mr.
Page's. He stood looking thoughtfully out of the window for
some time, and by and by noticed a stout seedy man ass slowly
up the pavement, giving what seemed a significant glance at the
opposite house. He was just the sort of man one associates with
writs, and Devil Branscombe feit an uneasy sensation. The man
was followed at some distance by two other men ; one of these
looked like an Essex or Salisbury Street lawyer; the other Ralph
Branscombe knew too well. He was a shrewd and resolute ofcer
who had been in pmsuit of him for a year or two.
"By Jove," he said to himself, " those beggars have traced me
somehow. How the deuce have they managed it? Luckily they
don't seem to guess I'm here. I'm glad Claudia was safe across
before they could see her."
At that moment he started; for his door, which he had not
locked after Claudia, was suddenly opened, but the person who
entered was only old Langton.
"There are sharks abroad, Squire," he said. "I've just seen
Laurie, the Sheriff's otlicer, looking very knowingly at Page's
house ; and two other fellows followed him, and they went away
tcgether. I was standing at the gate, and saw them. The others
are London chaps, I guess."
" I saw them, Langton, and know who they are. How shall I
get away? They'll watch all the coaches."
"I've got an idea, Squire. There's a night mail that passes
the cross roads :1 way towards Eastford about tWQ in the morning.
It goes right over the downs to Salisbury. It's fourteen miles,

about; my mare '11 do it easy in an hour and a quarter. Shall
I drive you over to-night'l "
" The very thing," he re lied. " We can start after your
Italrlaoplei1 are in bed. It wont do to go from the High Street,
ow.y ."
"No," said Langton, "I thought of that. We can have the
trap down in the back lane, and walk across the tanyurd."
" But how will you get the mare round there? And who'll be
in charge of her till we come?"
"Ah," replied the tanner, " that's a puzzler. I can't trust her
with everybody, and besides, any giddy boy won't do."
After a pause, he resumed
" I think I see what to do. The mare and trap are in the
Half Moon stables luckily; I left them there when I drove in
iwith a commercial the other day. I'll manage it, Squire, never
ear."
Away went the loyal 01d tanner to the Half Moon, and called
for ale. Jack Winslow served hing looking as piquant as ever.
"Jack," he said, " you're not timorsome, I know. I want on
to take out my mare and trap to-night at a quarter-past twe re,
and drive down to Lane End, and wait for me and a friend.
You must do it all yourself, and not say a word to anvbody
before or after. It's a matter of life and death almost. You're
not afraid 'I"
" Not likely. I'll do it. It will be a jolly lark. I'll be there
' to a minute. You won't have the lamps, I suppose 'l"
th" Np, certainly not. And if anybody interferes with you down
ere'
" He won't interfere with anybody else for some time. Don't
be afraid for me, Mr. Langton. I can take care of myself."
The tanner was on tenter hooks till his family were gone to
bed that night. But they were all off in capital time; and he
and Ralph, after a sti' glass of brandy and water, made their
way into the tanyard at the hour appointed. There was neither
moon nor stars, and it was pitch-dar .
"Keep right behind me, Squire, and put your hand on my
shoulder. There are lots of pits about here, but I know my way
blindfold." ,
'A tanyard is not a nice place to walk in at nights, the pits
being divided by very narrow pathways, awkward enough by
daylight, while the lime its, in which the hair is scorched from
the hides, are so surroun ed by a white deposit, that when quite
full, they can hardly be distinguished from the rm earth around
them. As the two men advanced along a ath so strewn with
soft tan that their footsteps gave no soun , Langton became
suddenly aware of a light moving in front of them. He stood
still for a moment. It was evidently a lantern.
"I verily believe those villains are prowling about here, Squire.
What can they be after at this time of night 7"

"Perha 5 they want to nd some place to hide and keep
watch," w ispered Ralph.
" I'll be hanged if I can make it out. But come along quietly,
and be ready for a row. We shall have to meet them, they're
rigiit in our way."
he lantern which the approaching party carried carefully in
front of them served to expose them to Ralph and the tanner.
There were two men only, who turned out to be the lawyer and
the London ofcer. Laurie, the local man, was not interested
enough in the capture to undertake midni~ht reconnoissances.
They carried their light low, and stooped as they walked to make
out the path, and did not notice any one approaching till the
tanner collared one of them with his strong right hand, and
exclaiming
"Thieves, by Jingo l" swung the unlucky intruder into the
nearest tan it. The lantern was smashed; the other man was
so a'righte by his perplexing position that he went down on his
hands and knees, groping for the path ; and Langton and Brons-
combe, kicking him out of the way, pushed forward down the
hill, crossed the brook, and were soon at Lane End.
" That poor devil won't be drowned, I ho e," said Ralph.
"Drowned, no !" said Langton. "He'l be tanned, though.
There isn't much stuff in that pit, but I doubt if he'll get out
hill the morning, unless the other rascal has sense enough to help
1m."
" 1 ex ect he'll be afraid to move." said Ralph. " It's adeuced
awkwar trap to be caught in. Your men will probably nd
them both there in the morning."
Which turned out to be the case. You have probably never
fallen into a tanpit, reader. I have, and I assure you it is not
nice. It was the lawyer who got in. and there he was found at
about half-past six, up to his arm its in tan. The bailiff, more
fortunate, had scrambled to the s oping side of a bark stack,
where he had slept, but he had not strength enough to get his
companion out, and so they had to wait till the men came to
work. Everybody roared with laughter at the professional en-
tletnan's plight; but the old tanner told him it would do im
good, substituting a healthier smell for the bad odour observable
in low attorneys. He had a great mind, he said, to give them
into custody for trespassing, and on suspicion of theft.
Ralph and his guide found the trap standing at Lane End, the
mare now and then giving an impatient stamp of her forefoot.
Jack Winslow jumped out, and it was not so dark that Devil
Branscombe could not recognise a petticoat.
"By Jove ! Langton," he said, " why, who's this 'I "
" You know her well enough, Squire ; it's Jack Winslow."
" Egad," he exclaimed, " you are a trump, Jack ; 1 must give
you a kiss for this. Why, there isn't another girl in England
Would have had the pluck to do it."

So Ralph Branscombe pressed the buxom barmaid's lips, and
sprang into the trap, and away went the mare with that long
swinging trot into which the tanner broke the animals he drove.
Meanwhile Jack Winslow walked fearlessly up the lane, and
through the stable entrance to the Half-Moon, and found her way
to her bedchamber.
" I didn't think it was the Squire," she said to herself while
disrobing. " Well, he's a gentleman every inch, though they do
say he's so wild, and he's just the man I'd marry, if he was young
enough and would have me."
How these wild men fascinate women of all sorts !
" I'm well out of that, Langton," said Ralph, as the mare went
merrily along.
" Yes; they were on the scent, evidently. Downright fools to
come into the yard by night, though. I suppose those Londoners
had never seen a tanyard before."
" They won't want to see another," said Ralyh, laughing.
"What a thorouvh trump that little Winslow gir is! I gave
her a kiss, but i'd have given her a handful of guineas if I'd
thought she'd take them."
"You'd have mortally otl'ended her," said the tanner. " Send
her some trie when you're safea bit of your hair in a locket,
or some such truck, and she'll be delighted."
" I will," said Branscombennd he did.
A night drive in ne weather is always pleasant, and is pecu-
liarly exhilarating when you have just succeeded in eluding
some imminent evilwhen ou feel safe and free after long sus-
pense. So Branscombe an Langton were in high glee when
they reached the cross roads. The mare had gone like the wind ;
it wasn't half-past one, and the mail came by at two. They
knocked up the landlord of the little inn, and the kitchen re
was resuscuated, and something hot and strong pre ared Ral h
Branscombe for his ride over the great plain. O ! those 0 d
coun inns, with their generous kitchens, their strong home-
brewe ale, their great itches always ready to be sliced and
broiled, their fresh eggs, their wholesome neat-handed waitresses!
. Steam has annihilated them; and I am one of those who nd no
consolation in the gaudy coffee-rooms of the Magnicent Hotel

CHAPTER VIII.
rm: raxrnsa's woolxo.
LAUDIA had undertaken a task of double diicultydiicult
for Stephen, ditiicult for herself. Perhaps she rather under-
estimated the difculty, so far as Stephen was concerned. He
was a boy, she thought, and boys are seldom true to their rst
love fancy; and surely she was far more bewitching than that
little Anne Page. But she looked her own difculty fairly in
the face; she was old enough to know her own need; she re-
quired, as old Langton had said to himself ten years before, a
mm to rule her; she was well aware that a miserable life
awaited her if she married a person her inferior in strength of
will, in force of character. She should have her own way in
such a case; but she did not want her own way ; she wanted to
be obliged to accept the way of a man she worship ed, a man
she loved and feared, a man at who~e feet she crouc ed, a Very
tame submissive panther indeed. Knowing all this, she felt that
the sacrice she contemplated making for her father was of no
common magnitude.
I venture to think that the neoteric novelist is generally a
trie too fond of little girls. I meandon't be offended, young
ladieschildren of eighteen or nineteen, infantile heroines, who
are very pretty, and fresh, and nice, but who can by no possi-
bility have any denite character. Watch, as I have watched, a
girl's development from seventeen to twenty~ssven, and say if
from her peculiarities at the former age it is possible to judge
what she will be at the latter. It is 'liard to understand why
-retty creatures fresh from the nursery are rpetually chosen as
heroines. They are seldom such in real li e, and it would be a
dreadful bore if they were. Only boys and foolish elderly men
think of marrying girls of eighteen or thereabout. Perhaps the
truth is that the Woman in her young primethe woman in that
delicious decade which begins at twenty-veis rather too diffi-
cult a subject for the average novelist. So he gives us lamb
instead of four-year-old mutton.
Claudia tried hard to persuade herself, in direct contravention
of her own judgment, that it would give her satisfaction to have
a husband who would do her will unreasoningly. And such a
spouse she expected in Stephen. That word "obey," which our
wise liturgists put into the mouth of the marrying maiden, is
a great trial to Womankind. They know by instinct that it is
what they ought to do to be happy ; yet they shrink from it as a
timorous bather shrinks from his header into the sea on a cool
fresh October morning. Shy creatures, whether panthers or

fawns, they y from the hand of their master; yet to be mas-
tered is their destiny, their felicity.
Having decided to sacrice herself for the good of the Brans-
combes, Claudia rceived the necessity of so occupying Anne
Page that she mig t not monopolies Ste hen. So she encouraged
him to bring his friend Humphrey orll to the house; and
Humphrey was both useful and ornamental. Humphrey was
llle the modern Admirable Crichton. He could do anything.
e went in for winning a fellOWship and a lady's hand in pre-
cisely the same business-like way. He knew how to talk. In
brilliant verbal foil- play with Claudia he achieved great success ;
but he showed a preference for teachin rett little Anne a few
innocent elements of the science called know edge of the world.
So the two couples paired off, a good deal ; Claudia instructress
to Stephen, Humphrey ludimagister to Anne. We must watch
both processes.
In time Stephen had nearly exhausted Claudia's information
of that world-stratum called society. He was apprehensive, as I
have said; and, having a prehended, he began to exercise his
forgetive faculty. He comgined the social elements learned from
Claudia into dramatic and romantic scenes. Farther, he imagined
himself in the untried arena, and feltthe daring young dreamer
-as if he need fear no one there. But, as Claudia ceased to
teach, she began to learn. What, it may be asked, could this
brilliant creature, a social expert, learn of a boy like young Lang-
tonl Much. A oet of the day has described a young lady who,
being christened liouisa, and being rather fast, has been rechris
tened " Unlimited Loo," in rhymes like these, so far as I can
remember them :
" Loo's a voice most delicious to carol
Mr. Tennyson'p songs to the harp ;
She can manage a light double-barrel 5
She can angle for trout or for carp :
So wisely she talks about science,
You'd think her a regular blue :
She sets every rule at deance
And we style her Unlimited Loo.
" She can pull a stroke-oar on the river,
Like that muscular hero, Tom Brown 3
She can ride, and at fences don't quiver
Where many a hunter goes down ;
She's plucky, but vastly more pleasant
Than most of the nursery crew ;
She can shoot, dress, and carve a cock pheasant,
This wilful Unlimited Loo."
New Claudia had all Miss Loo's accomplishments, and was
quite as unlimited 3 but there was one thing whereof Claudia

had a ladylike ignorance, and that was literature. I don't of
course mean contemporary literature i.e., Tennyson, Tup er, all
the new novels, and the Saturday Review. She knew not ing of
the classical literature of this or any other nation ; and here she
found a teacher in Stephen. He, being omnivorous, had read
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Flet-
cherhad gone lart'ner aeld, reading all that is best in the lite-
ralure of Greece and of Romehad mastered Spanish, Italian,
German, French, and could quote for her Calderon, Cnmoens,
Ciiiabrera, Goethe, or Heine and Alfred de Musset. I do not
meat: to say he had scholarly or accurate knowledge of any one
of these languages ; he had not. But he had, in that apprehen-
sive laculty of his, a power which enabled him to understand
great poets more thoroughly than many a rfect scholar. Porson
was the victim of false quantities to the ast, though he taught
us the laws of Greek verse. Peacock, whose al ebra has well
been styled "The Ivanhoe of Cambridge," coul not solve an
equation problem. Stephen Langton could scarcely write a
grammatical phrase in any tongue save English ; but he tested
authors as diverse as Aristophanes, Anacreon, Heine, Branger,
with most appreciative palate.
Now Claudia Branscombe's policy was transitive from the bril-
liant social mood to the Platonic and psychological. And here, as
I have said, Ste hen was so apt as to astonish heralmost to
alarm her. She became rather afraid of the boy's progress being
too rapid. Learned in the love-lore of the poets, he was rst
lecturer and then im rovisator. The noble library furnished
abundant material. leasant mornings of autumn vanished but
too swiftly in its easy chairs or out beneath the lealage of the
gardens. Let me sketch but one such morning.
Humphrey Morll had brought Anne Page to that seat beneath
the acacia where Stephen had declared himself her lover, and
was teaching her chess. It was a most barefaced pretext Anne
couldn't learn the moves, and wouldn't try; her retty white
hands played with the white ivory ; her sWeet chee ushed as
she listened to Humphrey's gay joyous spirited talk. A capital
talker, Humphrey; never dull or taciturn or melancholy, like
Stephen ; always ready with easy conVei-se that had perhaps very
little in it, but was enlivening and effervescent, like the foam of
champagne. So they were pretending to play chess, and Hum-
phrey was chattering, and Anne was listenlng dreamily, delight-
edly. "'here were the other twain'l
There was a cool shady seat under the tent-like greenery of
a superb plane-tree: "such tents the patriarchs loved." On a
mimic lake, tranquil and pellucid, swam a very otilla of unusual
water-fowl, ranz aves in tm. The mound on which rose the
plane sloped to this lakelet. Claudia sat upon the turf, a volume
wide open on her lap. Stephen looked over the fair white page,
and with eager nger pointed to the lines-
## p. 70 (#80) ##############################################
70 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
"Ah ! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his gure and no pace perceived ;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived ;
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred !
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead. '
" Very poetic attery," said Claudia; " but even Shakespeare
was too weak for time. The fair face faded. Who was s e, I
wonder 1"
"She is immortal in his verse, at any rate," said Stephen.
" But nobody believes that beauty's summer is dead."
"It is melancholy to think that what poor beauty one may
have is stealing away every moment just as certainly as the
shadow moves on the dial."
"Heraclitus remarked that you never twice cross the same
stream or twice look on the same face. Yet," went on Stephen
da1"ing boy !" you seem to me the very same vision of beauty
that dawned upon me at that sordid school."
"Don't talk of it," she interposed hurriedly. "Why, there
have been ten April perfumes in ten hot Junes burned since
then! I could almost cry, Stephen, when I think how dread-
{ullyn old I am growingand you, why you are just beginning to
me.
There certainly was a misty moisture in those wondrous black
eyes of hers.
"You are not altered," said Stephen. "I could fancyI do
sometimes fancythat the whole time is a dream, and that I
shall wake up in the morning a little boy, in that snug room at
Kingsleat, with your night-dress on. I remember now what
wonderful frills it had."
"You were a wicked little boy," she said, turning round upon
him with a ash of the liquid black eyes. " What business have
you with my night-dresses?"
"Ah!" said Stephen, throwing himself back upon the soft
green turf and closinv his eyes, "it is a dream, I know. I am
not on the grass un er a lane-tree: I am half asleep in a
delicious bedhalf asleep, rawsily dozingand you are going
to get into bed in the next roomand before you do, you will
stoop over me and give me a kiss. I know you will."
Why, Claudia, Claudia, what can this impudent boy mean?
Is he not a trifle too recoce'l ls he forgetting sweet Anne Page?
Or is it only that faci e humour which ever coexists with poetry'l
A momentous problem.
Claudia looked down upon him. His eyes were closed; the
leaf shadows of the plane uttered over his boyish face ; his lips
were half parted, expectant. She stooped, and her abundant
black tresses showered over him, and she pressed her lips to his.
She could not resist the impulse; it was magic, magnetic. He

caught her before she could rise again, and gave her kiss for kiss.
Springing to his feet, he laughed merrily, and exclaimed
" Then come kiss me, sweet-and-twenty."
He could see Claudia blush a rosy redshe who blushed sel-
dom indeed. And Claudia could feel the warm blush tingle and
redden through her every limb. What had she done 1 She was
laying with edged tools. She was afraid of this boy, whom
litherto she had regarded with tolerant contempt. She was
afraid of herself and of him.
"vaet-and-thirty, you mean." she said. "Now, vou must
not do that again, Stephen, or I shall be very angry. You are a
naughty boy."
He stooped over her, caught her two hands in his. and looked
right into those great black changeful eyes. There was a strange
expression in theman almost piteous expression.
" Why. Claudia," he said, "there is no need to be angry. We
went back a few years, that is all. I was a or little schoolboy
again, and you Were the kind and beautitliil vision that came
suddenly to give me one day's pleasure. And you gave me a
kiss of your own free will, you must admit."
" You are cruel," she said, looking away from him. " Let me
go. I am tired of this child's play."
She rose to her feet, imperious and angry as the virgin goddess,
that dav the luckless hunlsman beheld her white-skinned beauty
in the Ga phian waters. If Claudia had been at this moment
a goddess don't know what might have chanced to Stephen.
You see, being very angry with herself, she naturally vented her
ire u on him.
" on should go back to school again if I had my way," she
said, ,j' and learn better manners. I wonder at. your impertin-
ence.
" My dear Miss Claudia," said Stephen, " will you listen for a
minute? You are unreasonably angry with yourself for being
so generous as to recall old times by giving me a kiss, and so you
Eretend to be angry with me. Now what harm in the world
ave you done or have I done? In point of fact you were only
kissing a little boy in one of our own night-gowns."
Claudia thought it best to augh. She knew it was ridiculous
to quarrel with Stephen for her own mistake.
"I'll never kiss you again, sir, never," she said.
" Don't make rash promises," replied Ste hen. " I really
think that in order to console me for the sco ding I have had,
you ought to give me one more kissor at least let me take one.
shan't be able to believe you forgive me, else."
I think I may leave the reader to guess how this overture was
received.
Claudia could not for a long time decide whether Stephen had

u-~>4.
any touch of feeling towards her. His manner perplexed her.
With Anne Page he assumed the rights of betrothul, and tacitly
treated her as his future wife, giving her indeed Sliulll lectures,
and making suggestions as to her conduct, all which Anne took
with sweet submission. But he appeared to prefer Claudia's
society, and lost no occasion for a quiet conversation with her,
and wrote verses for her, and left Anne Page for Hum hrey )Ior-
ll to amuse. He, nothing loth, amused her, and Ettle Anne
seemed quite content. Winifred tried once or twice to make her
jealous of Claudia; but Anne could not feel jealousy.
" He likes Claudia's company," said Anne, " and why shouldn't
be enjoy it? We love one another, you know, Stephen and I;
but we need not always be talking about it."
" It appears to me," said Winifred, " that neither of you cares
about the other. If he runs away with Claudia, I suppose you'll
take up with Mr. Morll."
"Claudia is much too old for Ste hen. She is like a mother
to him," said Anne, with a touch otP demure spitefulness.
Winifred only wanted to make a little mischief. She and her
father watched Claudia's me with much interest, and he ed to
see her successful; and I suppose, if they had witnesse that
scene under the plane-tree, they would have felt certain of her
triumph. The Panther felt no such certainty.
When they parted, she went to her room, and kneeling on a
stool at the window, looked out upon the garden. There was
still upon her cheeks the remnant of that angry blush, like the
rosy streaks in the west that mark where the sun went down in
splendour. She hit her beautiful nether lip; she clenched on
one another her small white hands; her bosom panted beneath
her bodice ; her great black eyes had a lurid light in them.
" Shall I gain him'l" she soliloquised. "I don't know. He is
a strange boy, with something about him that I cannot under-
stand. He made me kiss him just now. I believe he could do
it again, this moment, though I hate him for it. Yes, I hate him
sometimes. I like him a little new and then ; but he shall not
have such power over me. Why, I could have cried with s ite.
Oh ! if he was only the little puny boy he was when I knew iim
rst, I'd whi him to death almostl declare I would. Hateful
creature! \ hen I marry him he shall pay for all this. I'll
make him my slave. Can I 7 I willI must ; he shall submit
to my will. To think that this mere boy should be able to
make me hate him so. I wonder what Cis would say, if I told
her !"
The idea of the Bishop's lady's probable amazement made our
Panther laugh. She grew less moody. She bathed her fair
cheeks in fragrant water, and cooled away the excitement which
had so thrilled every nerve of her body. She looked out upon
the garden; Stephen and Humphre and Anne Page were
grouped together by the fountain ; umphiey was throwing

pebbles into the water; Stephen, holding his sweetheart's hand
in his, was saying something to which she eagerly listened.
"No; she shall not haVe him," said the Panther to herself.
i' I willnnot be deed by two children. They cannot know what
ove is.
So through the leasant autumn weather she did her utmost
to charm him. S e wasted upon him a myriad times the art
which had been triumphant with admirers of far greater preten-
sion. It was a strange game they platedshe conscious, Stephen
unconscious. Day after day passed delightfully, yet the Panther
could not he sure of her prey. His very innocence foiled her
his boyish love for sweet Anne Pagehis reverent admiration
for herself, reverent, though, as We have seen, chequered with
irreverent incidents. And the great term time of Cambridge
came rapidly on, when Humphrey Moriill Would be away, and
her work would be retarded by Anne Page's company. She re-
solved soon to make some decisive move. It was most important,
for her father's sake, to win this game ; and, besides, she was now
too excited in the pursuit to relinquish it.
"hence it hap ened that, after much reection, she xed upon
an evening for t at purpose. Eager in her enter rise, she was
yet cool and considerate. " This boy," she said to erself, "can-
not believe that I really love him, as I want him to believe; he
thinks me beyond him ; I must prove to him that I am not so.
He will fall at my feet and worship me, when once he erceives
his good fortune. As yet he is afraid." And so she deci ed upon
time and place, and on a plan of action.
There was a lecture at some Idlechester Institute, by one of
those wandering geniuses who skim the froth of other men's
minds, and retail it for a few guineas nightly. I rather think
it was on chemistry; and sweet Anne Page, having a pretty
childish liking for seeing potassium aming upon ice, and hear~
in; the explosion of oxyhydrogen s- ap-bubbles, asked Stephen to
take her. But Stephen was too busy, he said ; the foolish fellow
was hard at work on a magazine article, which of course was
eventually refused; so he suggested that Humphrey would be
glad to go. And thus it was arranged.
\Vhich our wicked Panther knowing, that afternoon in the
garden she reminded Stephen of a translation he had promised
her of those delicious verses of Chiabrera's
" Belle rose porporine,
Che tra spine
Sull' aurora non aprite :
Lia ministre dein Amori,
Bei testori
Di bei denti custodite."
Cunning as Eve her grogenitrix, mother and mistress of many
tricks, she knew well at the young scribbler could not refuse

her his rhymes, whensoever she desired them; and so she desired
them this very evening. And so, when Humphrey had taken
Anne away to their chemistry, Stephen arrived with his MS,
and began with more uency than felicity-
" Ruddy Roses ! not the blossoms
Whose sweet bosoms
Morning wets with crystal dew ;
But lip-roses
Where reposes
Love, and music trembles through !"
And of course the Panther's lustrous eves brightened with admi-
ration; and of course he read more of his polyglottisms, all about
loveleave the boy alone for that. But by and. by Claudia
interrupted the readings with
" Ste hen, how old is Anne Pge l"
" In her seventeenth year," he said.
" And when are you going to marry her 'l "
"That," he replied, " depends on her guardians. If Mr. Page
had lived, he would doubtless have wished her to wait a few
ears.
"And you are in no hurry?"
" Why should I be? We are both very young. It would be
wrong to hurry her. She is scarcely old enough to know her
own mind? "
" Are you ?" asked Claudia with some emphasis.
"Well," he said, rising from his seat, and walking up and
down the room, " I think I am. You know I have been in love
with her for ten years at least," he continued, with a light
laugh.
"Stephen," she said, with a very low inection of her most
musical voice, " Stephen, do not make a mistake in this matter.
Do not mistake a mere childish fancy for true love. You young
poets rhyme about true love without dreaming of its marvellous
power. Oh! it is something so delicious that the delight is on
the very verge of agony. It is too divine for us to enjoy it fully,
and that is why its course can never run smooth. The gods envy
those who love. Be careful, Stephen."
" Why, Claudia," he said, astonished at her vehemence, " have
you ever known true love, then 2"
"Shall I tell you a great secret, Stephen? No," she said, play-
fully utting her pretty nger to her lip, " no, you cannot be
trusted. No, I won't tell you."
"You ma trust me," he said. " I should ve much like to
know that t ere is any one whom you think wort loving."
"Oh! there is," she said ; " there is."
There was a pause. At length she said--
" Come here, Stephen. Kneel down. I don't want you to
look at me while I tell you my secret."

He knelt at her foot, and buried his face in her lap, as if they
Were playing forfeits. She ran her delicate ngers through his
bright crisp curly hair. He was very patient. At last she said-
" I am afraid. Can't you guess, Ste hen l"
"I can only guess that he is a verv a py man," he answered,
iryilpu to raise his head and look at her ace. But she would not

" He is too happy," she said, " too fortunate. He cares nothing
for me. Oh, I cannot tell you, Stephen l"
" How you delight to tantalise me," he said.
" Listen, Stephen, listen," she whispered. " Tell nobody. For-
get that you have heard it." She bowed her head towards him,
so that he felt her breath upon his hair. " It isyou I love!"
Still she held him in his sweet prison ; then, as with a sudden
revulsion, she pushed him from her, saying
" Go awayyou despise me, I knowgo away directly."
She buried her face in her hands, and sobbed passionately.
Stephen was astounded. With all her apparent passion, he
could not believe her. He had never dreamt of loving Claudia.
of being unfaithful to sweet Anne Page. He was thunderstruck,
yct scarcely credulous. '
" Claudia," he said. "what have you told me 'l"
" Stephen," she replied, standing erect, and looking upon him
fearless v, with dilated orbs of living light, " I have told you the
truth. I am foolish enough, wicked enough, to love you, though
I know you can never love me. Perhaps you some day will
love as madly, and then you will know how vain it is to strive
to repress such love. 0 Stephen, Stephen, my darling, pity
me !"
She threw herself upon him. She ung her arms around him
wild] , and clung to him. lip, breast, and lissom limb. She
kisse him as Cleopatra might have kissed broad-fronted Casar
in her youth. He could not help returning the pressure of that
irresistible embrace. For a half-minute, it may be, locked in
each other's arms, Stephen and Claudia forgot, or seemed to for-
get, everything but love. So Hero and Leander may have clung
together ere {be bold swimmer sprang into Hellespont on his
return.
But the Panther felt that she had not triumphed. She had
miscalculated her power over him. And she was not surprised,
when that vehement embrace was over, to hear him say
" Claudia, this is very terrible. I pity you."
Yes, this was her humiliation, only too well deserved, she felt.
She had vainly exhausted all her resources, even those which no
woman should stoop to use. She had offered herself to this boy,
and was rejected. Even the secret might not be kept; he and
Anne Page erhaps would talk of her with a pitying smile as
" poor Claudia." Her hau hty temper chafed at the numberless
probabilities which crowd her imagination. If Raphael should

fans to this contemptuous boy years before !
"I wish I could love you, Claudia," he went on, breaking the
silence, " I owe you a great debt of gratitude."
This was worse than all. Every word he uttered, though
intended kindly, lled her with deeper shame, with hotter ire.
She hit her lip till it bled ; she clenched her beautiful hands till

her life at that moment to e revenged upon Stephen. Oh, to
torture him with some intense ingenuity of torturesomething
beyond all that the In uisition ever invented !
Hum hrey Morll's ock was heard at the front door.
" Tel them I have a headacheanything," she said, and was
gone in an instant.
So Stephen told them he had called in to hear their account
of the lecture, and that Miss Branscombe had a bad headache;
and Anne Page ran away to see if she could do anything for her
cousin ; and Humphrey criticised the lecturer's theories, and
laughed at the awkwardness of his experiments, and was learned
upon isomeric substances; and by and by Anne returned to say
that Claudia was coming presentl , and they must stop to supper,
which they did ; and Humphrey orll announced his intention
of performing a chemical experiment superior to any at the lec-
ture, and accordingly, being furnished with a lobster and some
anchovies and olives and capers and lettuce and endives and
various condiments, made such a salad as only a rst-rate operator
could produce.
Claudia came down looking radiant, and supper went off with
joyous gaiety. .
" Chemistry," said Humphrey, "is a wonderful science, if one
only knew something beyond its mere facts. I want to know
why two gases form water, when mixed in given roportions--
why chlorine destroys colours and odourswhy laughing gas
intoxicates you. What we call science is only classied ignor-
ance."
"Then it is just as well to be ignorant without classication,
as ladies generally are," said Claudia.
" What a beautiful colour the vapour of iodine is i" said Anne.
" I don't think I ever beheld anything so exquisite."
"If I recollect," observed Claudia, "it is very much the colour
of Stephen's eyes."
" Ironical attery is cruel," said Stephen, who was rather sur-
prised at Claudia's gaiety.
" How strange " said Anne, "that that stuffwhat did he call

" How sol" asked the Panther.
"Why, look here. Two elements, oxygen and hydrogen are

should there be a third malignant element that takes delight in

extracts her true love from the water, and so violently as to set

sion? Chemists only say' Oh, potassium has a great afnity
for oxygen.' To me it almost seems like the jealous work of a
living creature, just as if Rosaline, the scarlet-lip ed beauty
whom that rascal Romeo deserted for Juliet, had to lowed him
in wild anger, and killed both Juliet and herself."
"That is the action of potassium, is it?" said Claudia. " The
chemical type of a jealous woman. Curious! Anne, the lec-
turer did not tell you all this, did he 1 "
"No, it is some of Mr. Mortill's fantastic eculation. He is
fond of odd notions. I think he would have een an alchemist
or an astrologer if he had lived in old times."
" I believe in both sciences," said Stephen.
"I believe it is getting late," said Humphrey. " Come, the
ladies are tired of us."
They rose to go. Claudia took an opportunity to approach
Stephen, and whispered in his ear with singular distinctness
" I hate you, Stephen. You shall never marry Anne Page."
He gave her a sorrowful look, and then went away with his
friend. But not home, as yet; it was a night of glorious moon-
light, and they paced the cathedral close, solacing themselves
with the enchanted weed.

fain would win to read this storv.
Raphael Branscombe was in the silent city; not because, like
Contarini Fleming, he was drawn thither by some magic impulse,
but simply because be rather liked it. And though, again un-
like Contarini, the Sera h had no special redisposition for con-
s iracies, he had a won ert'ul genius for a venture. He was in
the midst of one now; or perhaps 'tWere better to say it had
reached its acute, and Raphael was getting a little tired of it.
The Seraph was singularly una tered since we saw him at
Kingsleat so long ago. He was boyish and beautiful as ever.
No trace of heard or whisker marred the feminine curves of
cheek and chin. You might have thought that he drank the
elixir of outh. He lay back in his chair at breakfast, according
to his old custom; and Louis supplied him abundantly with
coiiiestibles; and he gazed languidly through an open window
towards a palace on the opposite side of the narrow canal.
in that alace dwelt two En"lish ladies, the Countess of
Shottesbroo e and Lady Emilia rlilastings, her oungest daugh-
ter. The elder lady was an average countess owager, unplea-
santly hard up. As for Lady Emilia, I am tempted again to
quote a famous poet
" Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,
On her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-ower on its bed,
O'er the breast's superb abundance where a man might base his
head."
Yes; Emilia was very much "such a lady." She reminded
me often of Browning's Ottima, or of Byron's Dudu
" Being somewhat large and languishing and lazy,
Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy."
She had driven a good many people crazy in her time; and
was at present occupied in doing the same kind act for a young
Mr. Bouwrie Hudson, a millionaire of ve and twenty, whose
father was generally belieVed to have been a tailor, and whose
nenornen, according to some wicked wit, had been given him
cause he lodged in Bouverie Street. Hudson was a very
agreeable affable innocent young fellow, who was maddened by
Lady Emilia's sleepy beauty. The Countess encouraged him;
he would be a capital match for her daughter; but he could not

80 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
succeed in awakening the slightest amount of interest in those
great drowsy eyes of hers.
Even now, as Raphael lounged over his late breakfast, Mr.
Bouverie Hudson was in attendance on the lady of his love.
He had arrangedla morning stroll in a gondola, if I may use
such a phrase, to see some church or palace or island of the
lagoonsI forget what. And the hour had come, and the Coun-
tess had already dressed to start, and Lady Emilia declined to
move.
" I am so weary of it all," she said. " And it is so hot."
And she sank back in her chair the very picture of lassi-
tude.
" It will be pleasantly cool on the water," said the Countess.
"O mammal don't try to persuade me. You know what an
indolent creature 1 am. You go with Mr. Hudsonyou'll enjoy
it, I daresayand bring him back to dinner."
She sighed with the exertion of saying so much. Her invin-
cible indolence made her quite an autocrat. So the Countess of
Shottesbrooke and Mr. Bouverie Hudson started together, the
young gentleman looking anything but happy.
Their gondola had scarcely left the steps when Lady Emilia
so far exerted herself as to 1186 from her seat, and fasten to the
blind of the balcony a morsel of rosy ribbon. Then she actually
went and dressed herself, and, returning to the saloon, sat watch-
ing by the window.
"Confound the girl!" murmured Ra hael to himself, as he
saw that silken signal. " Louis, the gen ola."
-He repared to go out, though in leisurel fashion. Having
lighte a cigar, he also fastened a strip of ri bon to the blind.
When Emilia saw it, she sprang up with a prom titude, and
trip ed down the marble stairs with an agility, whic you would
not ave imagined in her.
Raphael's gondola. shot rapidly across from one palace portal
to the other. When the Lady Emilia had entere it, away it
oated through these lab inthine canalswhat matter whither?
A sunny atmosphere 0 delight seemed to surround Emilia as
she lay back on the cushions alone with Raphael. They were .
silent for a lon time. At ast Raphael, having nished his
cigar, half rose rom his seat, and looked upon the lady's face,
and kissed her drooping eyelids.
" So Hudson is teasing you still, my child 1 " he said.
"Yes, and mamma encourages him dreadfully. Oh, I am so
tired of it all. I wish I had never seen you, Ra hael."
"Why, you silly little thing," he exclaim , "what next?
You know that an hour with me on these quiet waters is worth
a year of our slow lazy life? What have I taught you, come!"
"You ave taught me to love you, Ra hael. And I wish I
had not learnt it. And I never know w ether you love me or
not."

"That is a question on which no young lady should permit
herself to have a doubt."
" lIo you love me, Raphael 'l " she nsked eagerly.
" How many times have you asked me that, Emilia! And
how many times have I told you that 1 don't care very much
forlgnybody but myself 7 When will you learn to know me,
e n
" I don't like you when you jest in this way," she said. "If
you don't love me, why do you kiss me 'Iwhy do you "
"Because I like it," he replied. " You are very niceand
you love me, I know, which is very pleasantand I like to oat
in a gondola with my arm round your waist, and our charming
had on my shoulder. And if I um satised, w y should not
you be, my pet T"
" But this can't go on for ever," she said, in speech far more
ranid than his; for she was eager, and he was cool and calm.
" 'ou know it can't ; what am I to do?"
"For ever," said Raphael meditatively. "No, indecd. Per-
haps an eternity of it might get monotonous, but I am not yet
very much fatigued. Oh, if I could only stay in one place
without being bored, and you could always be beautiful and
young. it would be very tolerable here in Venice."
And he kissed her lips this time. And then he lazily lit
another cigar.
"But, Raphael," she said, after a long pause, "what am I to
do? Tell me. You haven't told me 'I "
" Marry Hudson, 1 should think."
"Oh, now you are cruel !" she cried passionately. " You
know I hate that man."
"Which need not revent your marrying him. He warships
you. Come, child, e reasonable; you know I can't marry;
you know you must marry money. Here is this good-tempered
young fellow as madl in love with you as you are with me.
Make him happyan be as contented as you can manage to be
yourself."
" Raphael, you are a end !"
," Don't be abusive. my pet, or I won't give you another kiss
this morning. Was it my fault, you little fool. that you fell
passionately in love with me? Why, you were like a ripe peach
you dropt into my hand, you know you did. I have told you
all this before ; you need not make a man talk so much this hot
Weather. There! my cigar is out."
Emilia was half smiles, half tears. So foolishly she loved
this man that she could not be angry with him. She was his
slave. She could have thrown herself on the ground at a word,
for him to tread upon her. I believe she would have cast her-
self headlong into the canal, if Ra hael had hidden her. And
now, while he talked with this coo cynicism, she clung to him
with servile love.

"If I could marry," resumed the Seraph, after a while, "I
would marry you, Emilia-and that is more than I ever said to
any woman before. If either you or I had a clear thousand a year,
I would marry you. I don't know that I should be happy; I
think not ; if I know myself at all, I should desert you in about
six months. But you would be happyfor a week or two."
And he hummedhe had a capital tenor voice, Raphaela
stanza of Murger's song
" Yesterday seeing the swallows whirl,
Summer's guests in a happier clime, ,
I thought once more of the darling girl
Who used to love mewhen she had timo
'When she had time 1' "
"Ah! " said Lady Emilia, with a sigh, after another pause,
" what would in brother say if he knew? "
" My dear girl," said Raphael, " you are in a fanciful state this
morning. Be calm. I like repose. If you Worry yourself your
eyes will lose their brightness, and your cheeks their colour, and
your bust its divine curveand then you won't catch me in a
gondola with you again in a hurry. Your brother the Earl is as
gallant a boy as ever livedand if he knew, why, I sup ose he'd
kill me, for it wouldn't be gentlemanly for me to kill im, you
knowand I really shouldn't so much care if I felt sure there
was a Venice in the next world, and a pretty Emilia ready to
love me. But the parsons, who ought to know, I suppose, don't
give one any such ideas, I'm sorry to say."
The well-disciplined gondolier, who knew the value of time,
had brought them back to where Lady Emilia dwelt. Raphael
gave her a farewell kiss.
"Good-bye, child," he said. " Go and tell mamma, like a
dutiful daughter. that you think you'll marry Hudson, if he'll
make a good settlement on you. I'll make you a wedding pre-
sent. Run away."
She ascended the stairs. He, returning to his palace, found
that the post had in the interval arrived, and that there was a
letter in his father's well-known hand. Better say "st," per-
haps; Devil Branscombe wrote a most characteristic and un-
mistakable st, and sealed his letters with a vast shapeless
splash of wax. whereon a muzzled masti' and the motto "Cave! "
seemed equally characteristic.
"Whats the row now 'l" said Raphael, breaking the seal.
The letter was dated from Idlechester. " By J ove," said Ra hael
to himself, " the old gentleman has taken a queer fancy." hus

in his house in the High Street, comfortably shut up in a front
bedroom, and watching all that goes on at poor Page's opposite.
Amusing, rather. Nobody knows I'm here, though Walter knew
I was coming; settled it all with him at the Dolphin at South-
ampton. Very fair wine at the Dolphin, for a countr inn.
" You'll say, what the deuce is it all about? Wel , Page left
his money so that half of it will go to old Langton's grandson, if
we don't look sharp. Your uncle, who's got his wits about him,
suggested the best way out of itClaudin to marry young Lung-
ton, and then you to come over and marry Page's little girl. She's
very pretty, I hear; and, as you've had your ing,it can't matter
much whom you marry. She's got close upon four thousand a
year.
"So I want you to come and meet me and talk it over. I
shall start for Guernsey as soon as I've talked to Claudia. I saw
her go along the street just now. Wouldn't she have been aston-
ished if she had known who was looking at her i R. B.
"P.S.I mean to go to Baden or some such place, and see if
I've any luck with the thousand Page left me. He might as
well have made it ten. I shall wait for you in Guernseyhut
be as quick as you can, for I'm tired of the infernal hole."
"That's your game, is it, old gentleman?" said Raphael.
"Under the circumstances, perhaps I'd better not hurry in self.
You can't spend much money in Guernsey, at any rate. low-
ever, I must go to talk to you, that's certainand it will be a
ne opportunity of dropping that little Hastings. She's getting
tiresome, poor child. As to Anne Page, why, she must be a
mere baby yet~ So much the better perhaps, in some reSpects.

"Her ladyship has left Venice, sir," said Louis promptly. " 1
have just heard it."

" Left, eh!" solil uised Raphael. "I wonder if there has

shall go to Rome for a day or two, and then I think of crossing
to Corsica. We'll start this evening."
There had been a row. We left Emilia slowly ascending the
palace stairs. When she reached the saloon, to her amazement
she was received by her mother.
" Well, Lady Emilia Hastings, pray where have you been! I
thought you were too indolent to move."
" I suppose one may change one's mind, mamma."
" Oh, of course ! At the same time I presume I may inquire
where you have been, and in whose company 1"
" Whom do I know here?" asked Lady Emilia. " What do
you mean by ' In whose company '5" "
" I mean," said the Countess, " that for a young lady of your
rank to be alone in a gondola with a man whose character is
so bad as Mr. Raphael Branscombe's is sufcient to ruin her
reputation."
The girl was taken by surprise. Though the noiseless laby-
rinthine canals of Venice. with their mysterious gondolas, are
the natural home of intrigue, yet the secrets of the Venetian
waters are not always ke t. Gossip exists there, especially
among the resident Englis ; and the Countess had that very
morning encountered another dowager who knew more than her-
self of her daughter's movements. So she had hastily returned,
nding some pretext for the alteration of her design, and dismiss-
ing Mr. Hudson till dinner-time.
" If Mr. Branscombe has so bad a character," said Lady Emilia,
" why do you let him come here?"
" It is impossible," said the Countess, " to exclude an English-
man of fashion, whom you meet everywhere. But if he were
the most virtuous man in the world, it would not justify you in
going out with him alone."
" Not if I were aianced to him 'l " she asked.
"Wh , that would be worse than all," the Countess almost
shrieke . " He has no money; he is a pauper, and is far too
clever to marry a pauper. Emilia," she said solemnly, " 1 don't
know how far you have gone with him, and I have no wish to
know, but we shall leave Venice at once, and you will accept Mr.
Hudson."
" Never," said Emilia.
" You will," re lied her mother rmly. "Otherwise I will
write at once to ward, and tell him of your intrigue with this
Mr. Branscombe."
The threat was effective. The young Earl, his sister knew
well, had a high notion of the family honour. Sans pour ct sans
reprochc himse f, and descended from a stainless ancestry, he was
certain to hear of her doings with indignation.
" Good heaven !" she thought, "and Raphael would be killed.
He said he could not defend himself. It is dreadful."
Poor girl, she was aWakened from her indolent languor now.

She loved this man, who was utterly unworthy of her, With the
most absolute love. And if she sacriced herself to a man for
whom bllr cared nothing, it Was to sm e Raphael lrom her brother's
vengeance.
" Mamma," she said faintlv, " I submit. Now leave me alone,
please." She sunk back in her chair, and wept as if her heart
would break.
The Countess, heedless of her daughter's tears, went away
smiling at her own success.
That dav the happy Hudson, after a charming dinner, received
from the Countess a hint that he might speak. And he spoke,
finnkly and fairly, like a ne foolish young fellow as he was;
and Lady Emilia intoxicated him with an indolent Yes. But
uh, poor child ! she shuddered at his delight, and shrank from
the lips that touched her oWn. And. before they started for
England. she wrote a note to Raphael. which came to him through
a gondolier, after she was gone. It was a very little note :
"DEAR causn BunsenI have obeyed you. I should not
have had courage, but mamma found out that I love you, and I
was afraid Edward would kill you. I don't know what she knows.
Forget me, please. Emma."
"Poor little rogue !" thought Raphael, when he read it.
" That's all over."
He went, as he intended, to Rome; having written to his
father to say that he was on his way to Guernsey. Rome hail
not at that time become quite such a suburb of London as it now
is. People had not begun to write
" Jemima was cross, and I lost my umbrella,
That day at the tomb of Cecilia Metella."
There was no croquet at the Aldobrandini. Story and Weld
had not written their dreary books, nor had in friend Mr. Locker
set up as Laureate of the eternal city. Rap ael only stayed a
day or two; there was, of course, nobody there: and he took
wing to Naples, to look once more upon its voluptuous bay and
the pale cone of Vesuvius. Ra hael, a thorough Epicurean, in-
tensel enjoyed ne scenery. ll his tastes were exquisite. If
he ha possessed any kind of ethics, he would have been a very
good sort of fellow

CHAPTER X. '
on as ISLAND.
I DO not know what drew Raphael Branscombe to Corsica. I
am disposed to think it was destiny. When a man does a
thing inexplicable not only to the world but to himself, he is'
perhaps drawn into one of those currents of life which seem often
to interfere with its main tidal movement. If any one had asked
Ra hael why he was going to the mysterious island of revenge
and) of conquest, he certainly could not have told. The idea had
only occurred to him when he heard that ZEmilia had left Venice;
but he made up his' mind instantly, although he knew that his
father was anxlously awaiting him in ignite another island, ea er
to start for some place where he coul get rid of that unlucsky
thousand pounds. ,
Raphael crossed in a sailing-boat from Livarno. The Tuscan
channel is sprinkled with lovely isletssporades of the Italian
sea. Passing out of sight of Livorno's crowded harbour, lying at
the foot of Monte Nero; assing Meloria, a solitary rock with a
shattered tower, by whic was fought the sea ght which de-
stroyed the Genoese republic ; passing Gorgona and Capraja,
where one remembers Dante's execration against Pisa
" Movasi la Capraja e la Gorgona,
E faccian siepe ad Arno in an la foce,
Si ch' egli annieghi in te ogni persona,"
and where one also naturally thinks of anchovies : passing Elba
too, where men vainly thought to imprison a Titan ; the voyager
approaches Bastia. Raphael entered the harbour, with its dark
am hitheatre of mountains, at eventide. The rst words that
he eard through the dim light upon the quay were Ammazzatol
ammazzatol A Corsican had become rather excited in conversa-
tion with a friend, and had stabbed him with three strokes of a
dagger; ammuzalto con tre colpi di pugnale. The sbz'rn' were
after him ; he had ed to the macchia. He who once ies to the
mcclttia, the wild mountains and forests of Corsica, is a bandit
for li e
Raphael was rather amused than alarmed by this ominous re-
ception. After some trouble he got into a locanda, where, by the
smoky li ht of an ill-trimmed oiLlamp, he supped on wheaten
bread an cheese of ewe's milk and ery Corsican wine. He got
slight rest that night. In the early morning he strolled down to
the beach, and dipfped in the divine wave, and feasted his sight
with the islets o Gaipraja and Elba and romance-empurpled
Monte Cristo, afar ami the haze. Then, an experienced traveller,
## p. 87 (#97) ##############################################

he went to the sh-market to lonk for breakfast ; and was recom-
mended to try the murena, the best of all sh, which resembles a
serpent of porphyry : and gazed with delight on the innumerable
piscine forms of the Corsican waters. Thence to the fruit-
market on the Piazza Favaleni, where the peaches, apricots, green
almmlds, pomegranates, Muscat grapes from Cape Corso, gs,
magnicent melons, were crowded in profuse abundance. Beau-
tiful young girls bring them in baskets on their heads, whose
abundant tresses are hidden by the picturesque mandile, a head-
dress older than the Tarquins.
Raphael thoroughly enj~yed all this. He had with him but
one book, a favourite comrade of travel. a Tauchnitz Odyssey,-
he read it by the sea in Corsica, and thought himself in Ogygia.
Do not fear, reader, that I am going to follow him ste by step.
Forgetting his eager father, he went to Fabiani. the bookseller,
and bought of him Mztrmocchi's topographic Work on Corsica.
He climbed the green mountain Cardo, and looked down upon
the Mediterranean, whose hue, as Dante said, is color del oriental
2airo, and crushed out as he climbed the odour of those myriad
owers and herbs which caused Napoleon to say at St. Helena,
"I should know Corsica with my eyes shut, by its fragrance."
Then from Bastia he traversed Cape Corso, and entered the
beautiful stalactite cavern of Brando, and rested in Luri's en-
chanted valley, tasting its wondrous wine, and crossed the Serra
to Pino on the Ligurian Sea, and ascended to the T0wer of
Seneca, where the Stoic and poetaster expiated his ambitious
love by eight years' exile, exclaiming
" Hie sola hac duo sunt, exsul et exsilium,"
and returning, sailed the coast to Vesovato, whence Murat, "a
great knight and a small intellect," made his last attempt to
recover his lost kingdom, and climbed through the chestnut
groves and festooned clematis to lofty Oreto (010s), where he
found no locanda, but frank hos itality. A peasant, in brown
smock and Phrygian cap, gave llim soup of vegetables, goat's
esh, and peaches, the pretty daughter waiting at table, and
wondering at the stranger. After supper he went to the church,
standing on the verge of a steep rock, whence there is an incom-
arable view over chestnut-covered mountains and an island-
otted sea; and there meeting the Cur, enjoyed a delicious glass

Giulia, a merry maiden of sixteen, who did not know her own
age, but knew she looked very pretty in the faldetta, and so
brought it out and arrayed herself with it for the wanderer's
amusement. And the next day, with the peasant as guide, he
rode through the chestnut forests of Orezza, where a family can

live if they possess six groats and as many chestnuttrees, to
Morosaglia, the birthplace of Paoli.
Ferdinand Gregorovius, in his delightful book about this
romantic island, says that it contains men of Homer, of Plutarch,
and of Goethe. Raphael found some of each amono the goat
herds of Monte Rotondo, where the wild waters 0? the milk-
white Restonica foam endlessly, and the herdsmen store their
cheeses in the very caverns of Polyphemus ; on the dizzy steep
of Bonifuzio, whence you see the lanal on Sardinia's northern~
most cape, while on the islets below lie half-hewn columns which
were meant for mighty houses in the Home of the Caesars; above
all, at Isola Rossa, whose blood-red island clili's and gray Pisan
towers and hosphorescent sea delighted him. He echoed the
poetic travel er who exclaimed, "Verily, I swear I have reached
the magic shore of the Lotus-eaters." As you enter the town
there rises a fountain in an open space, where is a bust of Pauli,
who built the place under a re from Genoese gun-boats. Chil-
dren were playing there; one of these, a beautiful boy' about
eight years old, showed him the way to a little coffee-house.
Here a merry young landlady Chilina Benvenuta, made him an
abundant supper of sh and fruit, and gave him leasant songs
to the guitar as he sipped his wine on a marble hench outside,
gazing at sunset on the sea.
"By the ghost of Odysseus," he said to himself, "here will I
sta awhile, though I eat nothing save murenas and mulberries,
an though the head of the house of Branscombe never reach
Baden."
He stayed. He sailed on those charmed waters in a boat
called the Fantasiaa poetic name; he loitered on the three
red cliffs, and on the snow-white sands streaked with sanguine
coral dust, and along by the little nunnery in a garden by the
see, where dwell the Sisters of the Madonna alle Grazie. And
he made the a uaintance of a ne old Corsican, kingly as Alci-
nous, who dwe t among his olive grounds and vineyards and
mulberry gardens in Homeric simplicity, with only a grand-
daughter as companion. Angelo Montalti made the Englishman
wondrously welcome, and gave him broccio cake, and trout from
the hill-streams, and goats esh dressed by his own hands, and
fruit from his multitudinous trees, and the fragrant but too ery
wine of his own vineyards, while sweet young Fiordilisa Montalti
stood and served the guest in primzeval fashion.
Fiordilisa, the lil of Isola Rossa, was slender and shapely, and
full of maidenhood s ure simplicity. She looked upon Raphael
as Nausicaa on that lfhnious wanderer of the elder world. She
would have delighted an Italian painter with her hair of Apollo's
auburn, and her eyes of Athenes colour, and her uent exils
form. A child; no more; but how beautiful a child! Those
bare round warm white arms ; those hands, snowy as the delicate
braccio; that liquid Italian voice, which at eventide rang sweetly

in the wild plaintive vocen'; that dainty rosehud of a mouth,
honey-sweet for the kisses that are to comeRaphael found them
only too attractive. And Raphael always coveted the beauty
which he row.
It was an out-door life at Isola Rossa. On the seashore or in
the sea itself the children of the village played in happy crowds.
At night, sometimes outside the little locandn, sometimes in a
great green orchard of Angelo Montalti's, full of grey olives and
old gnarled mulberry treesthere was idyllic song, sometimes
playlul, sometimes touched with divine melancholy. The young
girls and boys Would improvise couplets, as in Fra Lippo Lippi-
" Flower o' the broom,
Take away love, and our earth is a tomb."
" Flower o' the quince,
I let Lisa go, and what good's in life since 3"
" Flower o' the rose,
If I have been merry, what matter who knows?"
" Flower o' the clove,
All the Latin I construe is arm, I love."
" Flower o' the thorn,
Joy of the midnight is sorrow at mom ! "
Or sometimes
" Amo un presidente,
Sta in letto senza dente ! "
" Amo un cameriere,
Sta in letto senza bere !"
Oh, what a ripple of lau hter from gay voung lips at each
successive distich! Raphael, sensitive to all sWeet inuences,
thought he had never known any enjoyment so near ert'ection.
He forgot Venice, and poor beautiful Emilia, soon to e tied to
her millionaire; he forgot sweet Anne Page, whom he was ex-
pected to marry; I regret to say he forgot Devil Branscombe,
who used to stalk up and down the cacodorous old pier at
Guernsey, and into Redstone's shop, and through the market to-
wards Cadic's for his cigars, swearing in muttered thunder at his
recusant son and heir.
" You should buy land, signor, and settle among us," said the
coqduettish Chilina one morning, as Raphael sat over his breakfast
un er a great mulberry tree which shaded the cam. Then she
san

Raphael smiled at the notion of his buying land, but Ul-

" If I were obliged to remain here I should want to be away.
I en'oy being here, because I ought to be somewhere else."
C ilina laughed merrily, showing the whitest teeth in the
World.
" You are as bad as my husband," she said; "he is always
wanting to go to Paris. What is Paris like? Is it much larger
than Corsica? Is England in Paris 1 "
Raphael had often to reply to questions such as these. After
giving such explanation as he could, be lit a cigar and started for
Montnlti's, lazily loiterin ' along the sands, and gazing where
birds innumerable haunte the blood-red cliffs.
Angelo )lontalti was about seventya ne athletic old patri~
arch, full of spirit. The history of Corsica, the noble career of
Paoli, the marvellous triumphs of Napoleon, were his favourite
subjects of converse with the stranver. Raphael found him amid
his olive and orange trees, with rl~'iordilisa, fresh as the dewy
dawn, by his side. And he also this mornin said
" Why not remain among us, Signor Ra'ae le'l Camillo Sali-
ceti is dead ; his house is to be soldthe white house with the
green blinds under the great chestnut trees where the little river
Ostriconi enters the sea. ' '
"Ah! that would be charming," said the Lily with delight
" You will stay, will you not 'I " '
" I will stay," he answered, " till I am obliged to go. It must
be soon, I fear. And I am happier than I ever was, or shall be
again."
" And you y from happiness?" said Angelo. " Thus all men
do, so I cannot wonder at you. But stay while you and
when you abandon us we shall regret you."
I wish I had the magic pencil of Millais to paint that old gray
house with its orchards by the sea, and the aged Angelo, and the
beautiful child, and Raphael standing under the golden-fruited
and urple-berried leal'age. I can see it all ; I can hear Fiordi-
lisa's ow sweet voice, more musical than the coo of a dove ; but,
reader, I want you also to see and hear.
" I want to sail this morning in the Fantasia," said Raphael.
" Will you come, Fiordilisa? Will you come, Angelo?"
1'1 2 you, Fiordilisa," said Montalti. "I have many things
to o.'
So away tripped the beautiful girl for her faldetta, and she
and Raphael went over the white coral-veined sands to where the
lateen~sailed boat had been pushed out by a couple of shermen;
and soon they were outside the ruddy islands, whence the long
peninsula of Cape Corso, and the little town, and the three mag-
nicent mountains behind it, Santa Angiola, Santa Susanna,
and rugged Feliceto, with villages clinging to their steep side
made up a glorious landscape. Raphael steered: Fiordilisa trail
her ngers in the sparkling sea, and murmured a low song.
"Sing, Lisa," he said, "so that I may hear you."

"After you, Signor Raffaello," she said. "You rst."
So he sang, in that luscious tenor of his
" Come to the garden, Minna, my sweet !
FoamleSs and calm is the violet sea :
Oh, thy dainty lips and thy nger tips
Shall be stained with the fruit of the mulberry tree.
" Heat of the noontide, Minna. my sweet !
Chains back the winds from their wandering glee,
But the air is cool is a forest pool
Under dense green boughs of the mulberry tree.
"Loop back thy tresses, Minna, my sweet !
Those rich brown ringlets uttering free ;
And the summer shall ush thee with brighter blush
Than the ruddiest fruit of the mulberry tree.
" Summer and Love, 0 Minna, my sweet !
Are angels twain who dwell with thee :
Lo! now they pursue us, and merrily woo us
Forth to the shade of the mulberry tree."
The song died across the windless wave. The Lily of Isola
Rossa looked at the singer with madid eyes and lips half parted.
Raphael, only too skilled in such devil's diagnosis, saw in those
moist orbs and tremulous lips the rst sym toms of love.
"Now, F iordilisa, I am going to tack. ,hen sing." And she

Raphael could resist no longer. He drew the beautiful crea-
ture to himself, and kissed her with passionate kisses.

"Will you be my wife, Lisa1" he said.
Fiordilisa sank upon his breast. She was won, this Nausicaa
of Corsica. She gave herself to him with utter love, with a
child's faith, in the simplicity and purity of her nature. And,
as he steered the Fantasia shorewards, with the Lin of Isola
Rossa lying in his arms, and gazing into his dream inscrutable
eyes, Raphael thought there might be a worse te than to
dwell upon
" Some unsuspected isle in far-oi! seas,"
with a creature so divine as Fiordilisa. Love had breathed a
soul into her, as into Undine; she was no longer the childish
little Corsican village girl, but a maiden of romance, t bride
for the knightliest wooer; and Raphael knew that, amid all his
many amours, he loved never so truly, never so worthily.
He ran the Fantasia ashore. He lifted the little beauty over
the shallow water to the sands. They walked together, slowly
and llglinigly, to old Montalti's. It was a delicious afternoon in
that 
" In which it seemed always afternoon."
They entered the gray gateway, and the patriarchal Corsican
advanced towards them under the fantastic trees. As he ap-
proached, the Lily ran forward and threw her arms around him,
and kissed him. Then she ran away; for it was nearly dinner
time, and dinner was her care.
" Signor Montalti, I love your granddaughter," said Raphael.
Old Angelo looked surprised.
" She is a child," he said. '
" How old is she 1" asked Raphael.
"She is sixteen". Well, perhaps it is not too young. Her
mother married at sixteen. But will you stay among us, Signor
Ra'aelle 'l "
" I will stay among you," said Raphael.
"Zl'hen I say nothing against it," said Angelo. "She loves
ou I)
y "She does."
" It is well. You are wiser than we and wealthier, and when
I die, you may desire to leave Corsica. But do not sell the old
house of the Montaltis."
"Do not fear," answered Raphael. "I belong myself to too
old a race not to respect old memories."
Raphael Branscombe, a complete Epicurean, with whom in-
dolence was a passion and eneretic action only an occasional
impulse, abandoned himself wholly to the delight of love. How
pleasantly they dined that day, the two men at table, as usual,
and Fiordilisa waiting upon theman island princess of the
primaeval time ministering to Nestor and Odysseus I How her

fair face ushed as she looked upon her herothe wanderer she
had won !
" Now," said Angelo, utting aside the green wine-ask, whose
sole stopper was a vine- eaf, " now will I show you there is wine
in Comes."
The old man descended into a cool crypt, and brought thence
a stone jar, holding about three quartsdark red its hue, its form
Etruscan. He poured the wine into the great globular goblets,
an oily amber liquid with a strange sparkle in its depths.
" It is of the year in which my son Angelo was born
F iordilisa's father. He would be thirty-ve if he lived now."
The Seraph had tasted wine in his timein as many places
and of as many qualities as most men. But never had there
passed his lips anything to equal this old wine of Corsica, which,
ery in its youth, had mellowed into nectarous perfection. They
drank to the happiness of the bridal that was to come.
It was xed earlya. month from that day. And, when the
day came, a Tromta or triumphal arch of greenery and owers
arose opposite the Casa Montalti. And Fiordilisa, mounted on
a snow-white pony, gaily oaparisoned, passed under this archway
amid a joyous procession to the little town. And girls from the
balconies of Isola Bossa strewed owers and grains of wheat as
the bride passed; and guns were red, and the mandoline and
comamusa played as they went to the church. And, after the
venerable priest had r ormed the ceremony, there was a gay
festival at Montalti's ouse; and a baby, in swaddling clothes,
with numberless ribbons and owers, was placed in Fiordilisa's
hands, and they sang
"Dio vi dia buona fortuna,
Tre di maschi e femmin' una l"
Raphael, in whom the dramatic faculty was strong, entered
into all this with consummate felicity. When the revel was
over, and the sweet night of autumn fell with its veiling mist
u on Isola Rossa, Angelo Montalti said to his son-in-law
" 'aelle, you should have been born a Corsican"
But F iordilisawhite, slender, fragrant, as the snowy hyacinth
-is gone to her chamber, and the silence of sleep falls on Isola
Rossa.
Previous to his bridal, Raphael had sent his faithful attendant
Louis to England for money, telling him also to go to Guernsey
and make the best excuses e could to Ralph Branscombe for his
son's delay. Louis was de atched before anything was known
in the village of his masters marrying design, and was directed
to wait for orders in Paris. For the astute Raphael, without con-
templating bigamy or anything of the kind, thought it advisable,
at least for the present, to keep his marriage unknown. He did
not send any such notice to the Times as this :
## p. 94 (#104) #############################################

"On the 19th of Se tember, at lsola Rossa, Corsica, by the
Abbate Malaspina, Ra hael, only son of Ralph Branscombe, of
Branscombe, to Fiordillisa, granddaughter of Angelo Montalti."
But he actually wrote out such a notice, to see how it lookedll
and laughed heartily as he thought of the sensation it woul
cause in society. What would his father say, and his uncle, and
Claudia, and Lady Emilia, and a thousand others who knew
him? And who did not know the Sera hwho, at least, that
was anybody I Satan's rude remark to It uriel and Zephon was
strictly applicable here.
So away Went Louis on his master's affairs to England. And,
having done his London business, he found his way to Guernsey,
and told Devil Bransconibe a long story of his own invention
about his master's being taken ill in Sardinia, and being so anxi-
ous about the delay that he insisted on his valet's leaving him to
explain it to his father. Which the old gentleman believing,
only swore a little at Raphael's stupidity in going to such out-of-
the-way places. and told Louis to make haste back to his master,
and intrusted him with the following characteristic note :
" DEAR RarnanL,-What the devil do you fall ill for just now 2
Look alive and get better, and make haste home and marry that
little girl. I shall still wait here for you; it's leasant in the
cold weather: and I'll be hanged if you can spen anything, for
claret and brandy and cigars cost nothing, and there isn't a pretty
woman in the place. So I've put a couple of hundreds into this
letter, for I'm better off just now than I have been since we
cleared out young Ranthorp, who was so spoony on Claudia.
"Louis says I may expect you in a tortmght; so, mind, I
expect you. R. B."
Louis had thought it best to make such an assertion, in order
to keep the old gentleman quiet. Moreover, he knew nothing of
his masier's intentions, and judged, from being ordered to await
him in Paris, that he meant soon to leave Corsica. So the valet,
having faithfully fullled all his orders, and sent Raphael his
letters and remittances, took holiday in Paris, waiting patiently.
And Ra hael and Fiordilisa spent their honeymoon at Isola
Rossa. T e Seraph felt no ennui. He found his child-bride in
all things rfect, exquisite. She worship d him; he had been
worshippede before, and by highborn Eng ish maidens; but the
royal dignity and primaaval simplicity of this daughter of romance
delighted him far more. Born far beyond the weary world of
fashion and irtation, the Lin of Isola Rossa was a creature of
poetry, poetic even when she milked the goats, and made the
white balls of cheese-curd and came with bare round arms to
serve her grandfather and husband at the table. Ay, a simple
mythical Ionian poetry surrounded her, as she came sometimes
through the breezy shadows of the orange-orchard with a basket

was liberal ; for though poor in London, Raphael found himself
opulent in Isola Rossa, and liberality was a characteristic of the
Branscombes. He made friends of ever body, and we: t out sh-
ing with the shermen, and astonishe them by the skill with
which his rie brought down the cli' pigeons, by the daring with
which he swam far out to sea. He brought Fiordilisa down on
moonlit evenings to join in the merry music outside Chilina's
cotl'eehouse. And when the old shoemaker of Calvi came over
with his sixteen-stringed atom, the same which Gregorovius
heard in his wanderings, and improvised a wondrous serenata
which told how
" A stranger to Isola Rossa
Has come in is fortunate hour,
And he sees the sweet maid of Montalti
In the shade of the mulberry bower,
And he woos the fair darling whose tresses
All golden fall down in a shower
On her shoulders of rosy white marble-
Our Fiordilisa, the ower "
then Raphael laddened the old man's heart with a gift such as
a chieftain of t e Odyssey might have bestowed on Demodocus.
So Raphael was popular in Isola Rossaand old Angelo
Montalti was happyand sweet Fiordilisa was happy with that
transcendent happiness which no pen can describe, but which
the girl's heart feels when Eros has entered the warm white nest
of her bosom, which heaves to the utter of his wings. She
drank perilous draughts of the vintage of love. There was no
prophetic troubadour to sing to her
" Ay, quench thy deep thirst, ere the moment has own
But once in the lifetime of mortals 'tis known
But onceand old Care, an inexible churl,
Will darken the days of the prettiest gir "
And so the charmed hours ew by joyously, and all was tranquil

as he enjoyed the sh and fruit of Corsica, missed his old luxuries.
And a few chaste gems for Fiordilisa, which an aesthetic crony of
Raphael's had been requested to choose forhim. All these came
to Ajaccio by the steamer from Marseille; and Raphael sailed
in the Fantasia round the coast to fetch them. Wilful Fiordilisa
longed to go, but he would not let her; and as they shoved off
from the white sands the retty creature wept at this rst part-
ing. The sagacious man of the world knew that to accustom her
to partings would be wise.
'Tis myth, doubtless, that Ajaccio was founded by A'ax ; but

having received his letters and packages, and written to Louis a
letter of three words"Wait at Paris "and visited the Casa
Buonaparte, and passed one delightful evening on the Place du
Diamant, looking on the glorious bay, again started for Isola
Rossa. His sole companion was the husband of Chilina, the
merry young landlady of the coffee-house. Marc Antonio, though
a sherman, had never voyaged as far as Ajaccio before, and
thought that Paris could not be grander. The Corsicans are a
stay-at-home peo le, except when they turn banditti. And
Fiordilisa and ina were waiting on the sands where the
saucy Fantasia, as good a sea-boat as my old friend Harry
Waring's Secret, came ashing round the red tongue of land on
the left. As she ran in upon the sands, the eager girl sprang into
the shallow water towards Raphael.
" My God !" he said to himself, "how the child loves me l"
They went home to dinner, Marc Antonio bringing up the
packages, which Raphael had not opened. And when the plea-
sant, simple meal was over, he said-
"Now, Lisa, you shall see what they have sent me."
She knelt upon the oor, opening package after package, while
old Angelo and Ra hael sip ed their wine, and Marc Antonio,
who had just brought up the ast, stood with wonderin eyes.
" Books !" she exclaimed. "Oh, what a number l by, you

ness.
"Here is what will suit you better," said Raphael to Fiordilisa,
sprinkling her with the Frangipanni of Piesse.
\" Oh, how sweet!"
And then she found a superb Cashmere shawl, which she threw
gracefully over her shouli ers; and then Raphael opened the

casket of jewellery, and fastened round her beautiful throat a
necklace of Oriental pearls, almost as white as her skin.
" You will make her vain, Ra'aelle," said old Montalti
rel .
" H: has done that already," she said ; " he has loved me."
A brooch of emerald, the very colour of the Mediterranean;
abrilliant set in dead gold, to sparkle on her white nger; a tiny
watch, with heavy gold chain, that seemed too massive for her
delicate neck: these were some of the beautiful gifts which
Raphael lavished upon her in loving profusion. Marc Antonio
went home and told his light-hearted little wife of these un-
precedented splendours; and lsola Rossa that evening and all
the next day had a most delightful theme for gossip and for
marvel.
" The Englishman is a great prince," said Marc Antonio with
an air of profound belief.
" He is a hero, and our friend," said Chilina.
Pleasantly passed the ying hours for Raphael and his beauti~
ful bride. But at last there arrived from Paris more despatches
3f various kinds; and, when he had read them, he said to Fior-
ilisa
" My ower, I must leave you for awhile."
"Oh why, Raffaelle'l"
" My father is ill at Paris, and wants much to see me. I can-
not disobey his desire; you would not wish me to 7"
"No, Raffaelle," she said, though her beautiful bright eyes
were dimmed with tears. "You must go. Go sour, and soon
return."
1': Byly darling, yes. And you must be very happy for my
sa 'e.
"I will try," she replied. " I shall think of nothing but your
return. Oh, how I shall watch for the Fantasia when Marc
Antonio is gone to meet you at Ajaccio l"
So Raphael departed for Ajaccio, and caught the Marseillo
steamer, and made no pause upon his journey until he reached
the Hotel Bristol at Paris. There he arrived late in the evening,
and ordered supper, and sent a messenger with a note to Louie's
Quarters. That prince of valets made his appearance on the
mstant.
"I am going to England, Louis," he said. "Be ready to
italrt to-morrow morning. I hope you have enjoyed your long
0 ida ."
"Payssably, monsieur," was the reply. "I prefer being in
attendance on monsieur."
"We shall have to cross to Guernsey, Louis," said Raphael.
" My father is still there."
" Would not monsieur prefer to go to St. Halo, and cross by
the Jersey steamboat 'l "
"An excellent idea," said Raphael.

CHAPTER XI.
ANOTHER WOOEB
SHORTLY after the chemical lecture, the Rev. Walter Brans-
combe, having to return to Kingsleat, took his ward with
him. Claudia of course accompanied him, and they settled down
at the Rectory. This ste was in contravention of Mr. Page's
will; but the Rector an Mr. Drax were both of opinion that
though Miss Page was directed to reside in the house at Idle-
chester, it was quite allowable for her occasionally to visit her
relations. The suggestion was Claudia's ; she recommended
Anne's being as much as possible separated from Stephen Lang-
ton. .
"I thought," said her uncle, indirectly referring to the plot
which he had suggested to his brother, "that you might like to
see him yourself now and then, Claudia." 
" I despise the boy," she said, viciously emphatic : whence the
Rector, whose acumen was considerable, at once guessed that
she had tried and failed.
Ah, that oor Panther ! how she vexed herself, tortured her-
self, over t e a'air! To have offered herselfshe, whom so
many had vainly wooedt0 a mere boy, and to be refused!
She wept tears of rage in the solitude of her chamber. She
vowed to be revenged on Ste hen Langton. Whatever ha
gened, he should not marry nne Page, she was thorough y
etermined. But she felt powerless to do him injury, and all
her indignation recoiled upon herself, intensifying her punish-
ment.

expect Raphael to come and wed the little heiress. And, indeed,
she was a trie afraid of the Seraph's arrival. He was almost

mg what had occurred between her and Stephen. Altogether,
Claudia was anything but happy.
At length, however, something occurred to render the Panther
a little less miserable. It was a ne December day, and the rst
akes of a snow-storm were descending. Claudia and Winifred
sat together in the drawing-room, which looked out upon the
stee deserted street of Kingsleat. The Panther was listlessly

interminable letter. At last the former spoke
"Really, Winifred, the scratching of your pen is Very irri-
{stingi "Who in the world will read a letter of such prodigious

"86h, it will be read !" answered Winifred.
" Now do tell me to whom you are writing at such unconscion-
able length. I won't say a word to Uncle Walter."
"My father is quite welcome to know all about it," she replied
indignantly. " As you are so inquisitive, I am writing to Father
Remigius. He is my confessor, and when I am at Kingsleat I
confess to him by letter."
The Panther burst into a silvery peal of laughter. It was
quite a relief in the monotony of Kingsleat to have anything so
ridiculous to laugh at.
" My goodness 1" she exclaimed, "what a number of sins you
must have committed to ll all those sheets ! I had no idea you
were such a dreadfully wicked girl. Do let me read it, Winny,
I am sure it will be more amusing than Paul de Kock, though
he is great fun about calepons."
" I am ashamed of you, Claudia," said the Saint. "I would
not let vou see it for the world."
" We l, is there anything about calepons in it 'i "
At this interesting point of the colloquy the door opened, and
a servant announced Sir Arthur "'illesden.
" Dear me, Sir Arth ur," exclaimed the Panther, rising from her
chair to meet him, "how glad I am to see you! You are Wel-
come in this desert. This is my cousin Winifred."
Sir Arthur was a ne young fellow, an awful swell, whose
brains and morals had all run to whiskers and moustache. He
was just Mr. Tennyson's "oiled and curled Assyrian bull." He
had been very wild in his time, and had kept racehorses, and
other beautiful animals, and had played cart with Devil Brans-
combe in that villa by the Thames where the Panther presided
at the little suppers, and now he was in the hands of the
Hebrews. He had come to Kingsleat entirely to see Claudia,
on whom, to use his own elegant English, " he wasawspoons,
rather," and had been vainly racking his brain all through the
journey to invent some ostensible reason for coming. But she

she asked him no questions.
" It'sawa dull place this, rather, I fanc ," he said.
" Dismally dull," said Claudia, " suicidall ull. Winifred and
I were just drawing lots who should drink udanum rst, when
you interrupted us ; weren't we, Winny 'l "
The Saint looked aghast.
" It would be shockingawfor two suchawdivine crea-
tures to commit suicide."
" Thank you, Sir Arthur," said the Panther. " Thank you for
Winny too ; nobody ever tells her she's divine except her father-
confessor. Now you're here, you must stay to luncheon, Sir
Arthur."
" Very happyaw," said he. " No particular funawwalk-
ing about in this infernal snow. Horrid bad wine at theaw
Mitre, where I'm stopping."
" You shall have a good glass of wine here," said the Panther,
"and then you shall tell me all the news of the town. Papa
and Raphael are both on the Continent, and I hear nothing from
anybody."
" Is-awthe Seraph all right?" he asked.
" Oh! he's unite seraphic, I expect," she answered. " But, posi-
tively, I dont know: I haven't heard from him for an age. I
am in some hopes of his coming down here."
"Do youawknow his address? I owe him a monkey on
the Leger."
"No," she said. "I daresay he'll be very glad of it, for he's
always hard up."
" Awso am Iso's everybod , I think."
Winifred was rather perplexe by this offhand confabulation.
She didn't know anything about the Leger, and hadn't the least
idea what a monkey meant, and had no notion of any cherubim
and sera him except those in the Te Deum. I fear the fast youn;y
ladies o the day will think her ignorance exaggerated; but I
can assure them it is true to the letter.
So Arthur Willesden stayed to luncheon, and to dinner, and
astonished the Rector by oorinv a couple of bottles of his nest
port, and being none the worse ibi- it.
" Don'tawhnnt at Melton for nothing," he remarked.
" That's the place to learn to drink ort."
The young baronet, thouh he ro e sixteen stone, was a rst-
ight man in the shires, and never funked anything. He was a
cool head, like Raphael, but his was the coolness of unconquer-
able stolidity. The Panther, to keep Anne Page in the back
ground till the Seraph's arrival, had'ordained that that young
lady should dine at midday, and only appear at dessert : she
had also ut her back into short frocks and frilled trousers, very
much to ier indignation. These alterations had been made on
the removal to Kingsleat. Sweet Anne Page was very indignant

about it: she thought herself quite a woman, being nearly seven-
teen, and engaged to be married ; but Claudia was resolute, and
her will, as we know, was pretty strong. So Anne, who was very
fresh and pctile, really looked about twelve in her infantile cos-
tume. When she entered the dining-room, shy and bashful, on
the present occasion, Sir Arthur exclaimed
" Awwhat a pretty little girl ! Come here, my dearaw
and 've me a kiss" He was sitting near the door, and had
actua ly pulled her on his knee and kissed her before she was
aware of his intention. The poor child burst into tears.
" Don't be silly, Anne," said Claudia. " If you cry, you shall
be sent to bed."
The Panther could not t at Stephen, but she could persecute
his poor little sweetheart or his sake, and she did so mercilessly.
lIf hSte hen could have known it, she would have been de-
i te .
gSir Arthur Willesden stayed at the Mitre for a long time,
much to the landlord's satisfaction. "He carried on a continuous
irtation with Claudia. He was always lunching or dining at
the Rectory; but, as the Rector kept ecclesiastic hours, he used
to sup at the Mitre about midnight, and lay billiards with whom-
soever he encountered. He seldom ost. Raphael, the best
amateur in England, had made him pay for his skill in the '
,zame ; and now the baronet made sad havoc with the fast young
fellows of Kingsleat. But then they were delighted to lose
money to a baronetand so distinguished a barouet as Sir
Arthur Willesden. Why, his name was in Bell's Life every week !
Hadn't he won the Two Thousand with Isosceles, and run second
for the Derby'l And he actually condescended to win their pru-
vincial unaristocratic half-crowns at 001 !
Meanwhile, Stephen was melancholy enough in his Idlechester '
lodgings. The Rector had courteously informed him that he
considered Anne Page too young to be regarded as actually
engaged to him; that, in fact, her education had been greatly
neglected, and it was requisite that she should pass her time in
the schoalroom ; and that correspondence was not to be thought
of. Ste hen was of course obliged to acquiesce, and to have
faith in is fairy princess. Such faith he had: and it consoled
him prett well; and he named his studies after his desultory
fashion. t was des erate y dull work.
He wanted a conjiiiante. Humphrey Morll was away ; and
besides, he had always shrunk from talking of his engagement to
Humphrey. Ste hen had a chivalrous idea of women. Spenser,
or Sir Phili Si ney, or the Earl of Surrey could not have put
them on a oftier, purer pedestal. But Humphrey professed to
be a man of the world; e had lax and cynical notions about
Women; he thought Anne Page a nice little girl enough, but
much too young for any practical purposes. So, had Humphrey
been in the cathedral city, Stephen would not have conded in

him. And having no friend in his own family, Stephen was at
lenih driven to tell his difculties to Jack Winslow, and found
in t e vivacious barmaid a warm sym athiser. Even she, how-
ever, thought Anne very young to e anybody's sweetheart ;
but she was highly indignant at the Rector's interfering with an
arrangement which Mr. Page had sanctioned.
One frosty forenoon Stephen, utterl weary of writing and
reading, with which his uncontrollab e thoughts perpetually
interfered, strolled down to the Half Moon and solaced himself
with a tankard of bitter ale and a cigar. He often met his
grandfather there, who would hail him with " Well, Steve ;" but
deemed him too much a ho fora sustained conversation. But
this morning business was s ack, and the bar-parlour empty, and
the fair barmaid had leisure to gossip.
" I should write to the young lady," she said, " if I Were you."
" Mr. Branscombe prohibits it," he replied.
" What right has he or an body to come between you and Miss
Page, when her r dead dither wished her to marry you? I
would write, I he 1 you."
" But then," ur ed Stephen, "they 'probably examine the
letters, and I shoul get her into trouble.
" Ah, that would be a pity. But I'll tell you what; I'm going
'over to Kingsleat to see my aunt one day next week. You write
a letter, and I'll see if I can't get her to have it so that no one
shall know."
This project delighted Stephen, who had the letter ready in
good time. Wednesday was market day at Kingsleat, and was
the day Miss Winslow chose for her visit. To her honour be it
said, t at she allowed Stephen's a'a'irs to take precedence of her
own. Before visiting her aunt she took a walk through the
crowded High Street, and was rewarded by seeing Anne and her
governess returning homewards after a morning stroll. At this
moment occurred to J :ick what before she had not thought of
that, though she knew Anne by sight, Anne probably did not
know her. This was perplexing. However, she decided to
watch for an opportunity.
Kingsleat Street is very steep. Very slowly did Anne and the
governess walk up it, Jack Winslow following. By and by Miss
Iarsden looked into a bookseller's shop at some new print there
exhibited ; and Jack, with reat promptitude, gave Anne a gentle
touch, and showed her the etter. Instinct told her it came from
Stephen ; she took it, and her hand returned with it to her muff ;
and the kind-hearted messenger was gone before the governess
turned from the window.
But slack, Kingleat Street is narrow as well as steep. By ill
fortune, Claudia was descending on the other side, and her keen
glance took in the whole transaction. She crossed the street and
addressed Miss M arsden.
" If you are not tired," she said, " will you go to old Mason's

in East Street, and tell him Winifred can't come to see him to-
day 'i I'll take charge of Anne."
The governess obeyed. Claudia had promised the Saint to call
for her on this old bed-ridden client of hers, whom she supplied
with broth and sermons. The other two walked slowly to the
Rectory.
" Come up to my room, dear," said the Panther, in the hall ;
" I want to speak to you."
Anne followed her cousin, devoid of suspicion. though anxious
in the p05session of a letter which she eagerly desired to read.
"Sit down, child," said Claudia, " and take off your hat; I
have something to say to you."
Anne did as she was bid, putting on a table that stood in the
centre of the reom her mu' with the precious letter in it.
Claudia also disrobed; and, having done so. took up the mull",
which she held carelessly in her hand. Out fell the letter.
Claudia picked it up.
" Why, Anne, my dear," she said to her cousin, who was in a
state of consternation, " where did you get this? Who is it
from '1"
Anne was too thoroughly consternated to reply. Claudia broke
the seal.
" 0 Claudia! please don't read it !" cried Anne Page eagerly;
" it is only for 1m: to read."
" Indeed," said the Panther coolly. " You evidently know all
about it. I see it is from Stephen Langton, with whom you have
been forbidden to correspond."
Claudia read it. It was a good letter, loving et trustful,
eager yet atient, boyish yet manly. The Panther 'd not love
Stephen, at what would she not have given for such adelter
from him? Oh! the bitter pain of reading it! Oh! the thirst
for revenge it caused in her jealous heart ! Having read it, she
folded it up and at it aside.
"0 Claudia, ear!" cried Anne, with straining eyes, " you
will let me have it now, won't you 't"
" Certainly not," she re lied. " I shall show it to your uncle,
ilznd shall then send it bac to the writer. It is a most improper
etter.
Poor little Anne !
But, after all, was not Claudia most to be pitied? Every word
of that loving letter had gone keen to her passionate heart, a
barbed arrow, which would not be withdrawn. She was athirst
for revenge.
" Sweet is revengeespecially to women "
according to Byron's version of J uvenal.
" I am very much ashamed of you, Anne," she continued, after
a pause, "a mere child like you. I could not have believed you

were so sly and cunning as to carry on a clandestine corre
spondence. '
Anne was silent. She was too prostrated to defend herself
from such a charge, or to plead her father's authority for her
engagement to Stephen. I think Claudia's feelings of revenge
ought by this time to have been satised, but it is a passion in~
satiable. And, by evil hap, the Panther's eye can ht among the
ladylike tries upon her centre table, among smel ing-asks and
inkstands and gem-cases and bonbonnires, a small jewelled riding-
whi . She took it up.
"801116 with me to your own room, Anne," she said. " I shall
punish you, and you will go to bed."
Poor little Anne! Have you ever seen a w catch ies,
reader'l Sweet Anne Page was as powerless in the ands of the
Panther as a y in the clutches of a wasp. I don't think Claudia
hurt her very much, but the humiliation was too cruel. What
young lad , engaged to be married, would like to be whipt and
sent to be even if she deserved it'l And really our poor little
heroine did not deserve it.
Claudia felt a good deal better on her return to her own room.
She put the letter in an envelope and sent it back to Ste hen.
And she told what had occurred to her Uncle Walter and ini-
fred, who mildly approved. And when, at dessert that day, Sir
Arthur missed " that prett child," she said
" Oh, she has been naug ty to-day, Sir Arthur. She has been
sent to bed."
It was an ineable luxury to Claudia to humiliate, to perse-
cute, to subject to mental and physical pain, the girl for whom
she had been rejected b Stephen Langton.
About the middle 0 the month Humphrey Morll appeared
on the scene from Cambridge. As the Rector and Dr. Winter
were on good termsand as Claudia. had encouraged Humphrey's
visits at dlechesterit would have been difcult to prevent his
having some intercourse with Anne Page. But the Panther had
no such intention. She wisely considered that the great thing
to be done was to e'ace from her cousin's mind the memory of
Stephen. Humphrey, she thought, was not dangerous ; and
Humphrey could occupy Anne with a little harmless semi-irta-
tion till Raphael's much-desired advent. Accordingly, Anne's
schoolroom imcprisonment was relaxed, and the governess went
away to spen her Christmas with her relationsthat is, if
governesses have relations ; and Humphrey Morll used to look
iAnrtplretty often at the Rectory, though not quite so often as Sir

Humphrey was ambitious and astute. He did not know
that any engagement, authorised or unauthorised, existed be-
tween Stephen and Anne, although it was clear to him that there
was some sort of understanding. But, if he had known of their
betrothsl, he would have cared little, deeming all things fair in

love and war. To this young man, eager above everything to
rise in the world, it had occurred that to marry Anne Page would
be of immense service to him. He knew that gold has a power of
oatation in the ocean-0f life akin to that of cork in the actual
ocean. He had conversed much with the little Page at Idle-
chester; had done his best to open her mind ; and had come to
the conclusion that it would not break her heart if she did not
marry Stephen. He reSolred to carry his operations somewhat
farther this Christmas vacation. And as the Rector was alwa s
busy, and Winifred busier, and the governess absent. and t e
Panther greatly occupied with the Assyrian baronet, Humphrey
had ample op rtunities.
He was rat er astonished the rst morning, when the charm-
ing child entered in her short frock and frilled caleg'ons. But he
did not exhibit his astonishment. "'inifred and Claudia and
Sir Arthur were all present: he awaited his op rtunity. It
soon came. The Saint had parochial business w ich took her
away. The Baronet wanted to skatehad heard of a pond halt
a mile out of town where the ice was capitalwould Claudia
comet Wouldn't she? The Panther skated superbly; and by
good hap, her maid, Margot, remembered where a pair of her
skates might be found. Humphrey found himself left alone
with sweet Anne Pagewhich was just what he wanted. They
soon became condential; and by and by Humphrey ventured
to ask the reason of her infantile costume.
" Oh, I don't know," said Anne, blushing. "Claudia wants to
make me out a baby. I suppose it's because she's not very young
herself."
" I have no doubt," said Humphrey, " she would very much
like to be as young and as pretty as you are. But you need not
care about it. You look a very charming little girl : only, you
know, one fancies you are not too old to be taken on one's knee
and kissed."
" Yes,-that horrid Sir Arthur Willesden positively did it one
day at dessert. It's just like Claudia, irting with that man, all
because he's a baronet."
" You don't seem very fond of your cousin, Miss Page?" said
Morll.
"Fond of her ! If you knewbut oh ! I couldn't tell you. I
detest her."
" What ! isn't she kind to you? No one could be cruel to you,
surely."
"ldon't know what you would call cruel," said the young
lady. " I only know I should very much like to do to her what
she did to me."
" 'What was it?" asked Humphrey in the kindest tone. " Tell
me. Let me try to help you. No one ought to be cruel to
you."
This sort of thing was successful at last; and Anne, with much

blushing hesitation, conded to Humphrey the fact that Claudia
had actually whipped her; but she would not tell the cause,
though he tried very hard to t at it. And he advised her
never again to submit to any suc indignity, but to ring the bell
for the servants, if Claudia threatened her. Which she promised
to do, though with a conviction that her courage would fail in
the Panther's presence. '
" By Jove !" said Morll to himself, as he walked towards the
Grammar School, " that is a verdant little party. I don't wonder
at her knocking under to Miss Branscombe, though; she's enough
to terrify anybody at all weak-minded. I'll tell you what, sir"
he was talking to himself, a habit of his" I think I'll marry
that child. She doesn't care for Stephen. He's too philosophic
and poetic for her. Shell marry anybody who'll put her in

man that's with her. I'd rather have a girl with a character;
but then her money's worth having. If I get it, I can make
myself Lord Chancellor. By Jove ! I'll marry her."
Humphrey Morll adhered to the policy which he had marked
out for himself. He devoted all his spare time to Anne Page.
He won her condence, and consoled her under her persecutions.
Not that she was very much persecuted: Claudia was too fully
occupied to trouble herself about her; but she was still treated
in the childish fashion, which she disliked. Humphrey was not
far wrong in his judgment of her character. Stephen had mag-
netised her by his imaginative power; but she had just come to
an age when the material excitements of the real world attracted
her more than Stephen's poetic visions; and Humphrey stimu-
lated her fancy with pictures of London life, balls and evening
garties, the undreamt delights of the Opera and the theatres.
e knew well what he was about. She " drank the milk of

it would be delightful to escape from the nursery into the
wondrous independence of married womanhood. Therefore she
listened to Humphrey with much attention. Stephen, she
thought, would never take her beyond Idlechester; he said
nothing about those gaieties which Humphrey so elo uently de-
scribed. I am sorry to say that, as a result of all thisfhumphrey

And Steqhen was away; she never saw him; she dared not

In mid-January Humphrey left "his little wife"as he
already styled her, unrebuked, and Miss Marsden and Mangnall'l
Questions returned. And Sir Arthur "'illesden went to town,
leaving' the Panther plenty of time to look after Anne. And,
when the car had advanced a little further, Claudia one day
received a etter in a hand she had not seen for an age. Thus
it ran :-
" No. , Cursors S'rumrr.
"Drum CLAUDIA,I have just returned to England, after a
few days with the old gentleman, who has got the gout, and is
delightfully erce. I've a deal to do in town, and I want a long
talk to you about the position of affairs; so come up and let
us converse. Start at once ; that's a good girl.
RAPHAEL."
Claudia always obeyed her brother; besides, at this period, she
desired the diversion of a tri to London. So having received
this letter at the breakfast our, she at once announced that
Raphael had returned, and that she was going to London to meet
him, and that, no doubt, he would come back with her. Her
uncle and cousin were delighted at the news, and Anne Page
opt netl her ears.
" You will like your Cousin Raphael, Anne," said Claudia
condescendingly. " He likes pretty little girls."
Miss Page by no means admired Miss Branscombe's condescen-
own.
The Panther was to start early the next morning ; that night
she and Winifred had a talk, part of which Anne Page over-
heard*for " little pitchers have long ears." This was the part
" Look after Anne, "'inifred," said the Panther. " She s very
sly. You remember when I caught her corresponding with
Stephen '1 "
" You've not found her out in anythinrr since, have you 7"
"No," said Claudia, laughing. " I think this little instru-
ment"Anne could guess what she took up" ave her a lesson
in the subject that she hasn't forgotten yet ut perhaps she
will begin playing her tricks again when my back is turned."
"Do you think Raphael will like her well enough to marry
her 7 " asked Winifred.
" I don't see why not," said the Panther. "She's pretty, you
must admit, though it's a very babyish prettiness. She'll improve
by and by. Won't he keep her in order if he does marry her !"
"Perhaps she won't have him," suggested Winifred.
" Pshaw! she'll fall in love with him directly. The dear fellow
is irresistible," she said with a laugh. "Besides, if she was
troublesome, I'd make her have him."
This was what Anne Page heard, an interested and terried
eavesdropper. Whence it happened that the mail-coach that took

Miss Branscombe townwards, carried also a letter which branched
off somewhere to Cambridge.
"DARLING Houransr,Cousin Claudia is gone to London,
and Cousin Ra hael is coming back with her, and I am to marry
him. I hate im. Nobody can help me but nu, Humphrey
dear. I am dreadfully frightened, dreadfully. our own little
wife,  ANNE Peon."
Which epistle, in due course reaching St. John's College, took
a certain undergraduate rather aback.
"What's to be done now, sirl" said Hum hrey to Moi-ll in
the solitude of his rooms. "I mustn't let this little party sli
through my ngers. That Miss Branscombe's so determined, she'
compel the little fool to marry him, and Anne is such a little
fool, she'd do it if they threatened to whip her for refusing, and,

down there, you're done, Mr. Morll, that's obvious. An , as
you've got no money, I don't quite see what you're to do. Sup-
pose we have a ipe together, and ruminate."
The result of his rumination was that he started that very day
for Idlechester, and rather astonished Stephen Langton by look-
ing him up in Little College Green.

APHAEL acted on his valet's advice, crossed from St. Malo,
and, spending as little time as possible in Jersey, took the
mail-steamer for the sister island. And, as he walked up the
steps of the ier at Guernsey, one of the rst gures that caught
his eye was is father's tall and portly form. Ralph Branscombe
was enjoying his customary matutine stroll.
" Well, sir," said Raphael, walking up to him, "here I am at
last, you see."
"Ah," responded his father, looking at his son from head to
foot, as if to ascertain whether he was really the right rson.
" Well, I'm not sorry to see you. You don't look as if you 0. been
quite as ill as that rascal of yours pretended."
" He's a capital liar," said Raphael. " I don't think I have had
even a headache since I had the pleasure of seeing you last."
" And may one inquire how you have been amusing yourself 3"
asked Devil Branscombe.

"I found some rather shy game," he replied. " Oh, I have
been amused, I assuri- you. But, with your permission, I'll go
and have some breakfast; I'm as hungry as a hunter."
Ralph Branscombe took his son to his rooms on the Esplanade.
At rst he lived at Marshall's Royal Yacht Club Hotel~iu those
days a pretentious gloomy place, where, with the usual fatuity of
hotel-keepers, you were charged six shillings a bottle for wine
that you could buy at Greenslade's, just opposite, at eighteen
shillings a dozen. When he had decided to wait for his son in
this ha py island, beyond the reach of temptation and creditors,
Ralph 'ranscombe took apartments. They were kept by an adi-
pose widow with a couple of daughters, one of whom was so ex-
cessively handsome that the old gentleman was almost tempted
to make love to her.
"And how do you get on in this tranquil island!" asked
Raphael, after he had nished his breakfast, skilfully manufac-
turing a cigarette the while.
" It is slowconfoundedlv slow. And the people are the
queerest lot you ever saw. They have a tremendously exclusive
aristocracy, Tuppers and Careys and Brooks and Dobrees, who
won't look at the unhappy natives that don't belong to their set.
Sixties they call themselves ; can't guess why."
" Got about sixty pounds a. year each, perhaps," suggested
Raphael. "But what is the place good for?"
" Well, there's scenery, you know, and sea-bathing. And the
sh is capital, and so is the fruit. And claret and cognac and
cigars are cheap. And there are some deuced pretty girls."
" These are recommendations," said Ra hael meditatively.
"That was a pretty little party who brought in breakfast just
now, but she'll be awfully fat. at forty, How do you spend your
evenings '1"
" There's a club," he replied, " and two or three of the members
have satisfactory ideas about van-john and 100. I have been
teaching them oker lately."
" You don't dine out, I suppose?"
" The aborigines have not yet reached that stage of civilisation.
From what I hear, they invite people to tea."
" Frightful barbarism i" said Raphael. " Well, about this
marrying scheme of yoursor the Rector's rather. That little
Page is a dumpy child, isn't she, just out of the nursery."
" She's pretty," said his father; " Claudia thinks her charming.
And four thousand a year is worth having."
" True. I'll go over and see her, and if she's not very bad style,
I may marry her. Will Claudia marry that young Langton 'l "
" She agreed to the arrangement."
"I don't half like it. She's too good for that sort of fellow.
However, I'll see all about it when I go down there."
" You'll stay here a day or two, I suppose," said Ralph. " It's
a luxury to get some one to talk to."

their creditors, and prefer Jemey, which is a free and easy sort
of place. By the way, there's a man lately come that you may
know perhaps, young Hudson; he married a sister of Shottes-
brooke's."
" By Jove," exclaimed Raphael, " what brings him here 'l Has
he got his wife with him?"
"I believe he has. They are lodging up at a place called the
New Ground. Do you know much of him 1 "
1 " Nlever spoke to him. I used to know Lady Emilia
s iglit y."
That evening the Branscombes went down to the club, and
very shortly Mr. Hudson was for the rst time introduced. A
very negative young fellow was Lady Emilia's husband; but
gold gloried himdeied him in the eyes of some people. He
had a very great belief in himself, and always found plenty of
toadies to encourage that belief. His inordinate vanity throve
ophthe attery of men who dined with him and borrowed money

There was not any very lively play this eveningsome old
fogies had settled down to whist ; Devrl Branscombe, despairing
of anything faster, had joined a party. Raphael was smoking
patiently. At last Hudson exclaimed
" Confound it, this is uncommonly slow. Is there a billiard-
room anywhere '2"
" Upon my life, I don't know," said Raphael, "I only came
here to-day, and unless I see some improvement, I think I shall
be off a ain to-mon-ow."
" Well, there must be a billiard-room," said Hudson. " Let's
go round to the hotel and ascertain."
"I have no particular objection," said RaphaeL "Are you a

lik'WVe'll put a sovereign on the game," said Hudson, "if you

"Just as you please," answered Raphael carelessly.
Hudson was an average player, and the Seraph had not
touched a cue for some months. The former went ahead at rst ;
but when he was thirty-seven to Raphael's thirteen, the Seraph
made a break, and scored his fty. with perfect ease.
" I must give vou odds," he remarked mildly. This sort of
thing didn't suit Hudson, who liked winning. So after another
game, he said
"Suppose we go up to my rooms, and see if we can gut some
supper? I daresay my wife nds it rather slow."

"Very well," said the Seraph. "I have met Lady Emilia
before now. I used to know the old Earl."
" By J ove." observed Hudson, " she'll be delighted to meet an
old acquaintance."
" Shouldn't wonder," soliloquised the Seraph.
The New Ground is a rectangular iece of turf, with gravel
walks and some tolerable trees. The houses in its vicinity look
as if they had been built for barracks. There are two or three
occupied as lodging-houses ; and in the largest of these, a corner
house, Mr. Hudson had taken apartments. From the windows
there was a ne view over the sea, a mile distant. He and
Raphael toiled up Smith Street and the Candie Road, and at
length reached this elevated part of the suburbs. When they
entered the drawing-room there was no one there, although lights
were burning.
h " Can't be gone to bed yet," said Hudson. "I'll go and fetch
er."
" Don't disturb Lady Emilia on my account," urged Raphael
with great indifference.
Mr. Hudson found his way to his wife's room. I regret to say
the lady in question was "in a temper." She had not been many
months married ; she knew no one in the island; and she had
been sitting in solitary weariness while her husband lost his
sovereigns at billiards.
Bouverie Hudson was a good deal afraid of his wife. She was
a thorough aristocrat ; she was divinely beautiful ; she was
aristocratically indolent. He felt his insignicance in her re-
sence. He was particularly proud of her, feeling that he ad
purchased one of the nest women in the marketa London
Circassian of high price. But he was not particularly fond of a
tle-d-tte with her.
" I have brought you a visitor, Emilia," he said.
" Have out How kind ! Some vulgar young islander, I
suppose, w o wants some supper."
" Why, no. He may want some supper, but he's neither vulgar
nor young. It's a gentleman you know slightly."
" Indeed ! Well, I hope he is rather more amusing than you
are. Tell me who he is, that I may judge whether he is worth
the trouble of going downstairs again."
"It is Mr. Raphael Branscombe," said Bourerie.
She did not reply for a moment ; the news had been sudden.
Then she said languidlr
" Ah, he will he a change. "'ell, go down and entertain him.
I will come presently." This she uttered in her most lazily im-
perious tone.
But, when her husband had left her, she locked the door,
threw herself on her knees at the foot of the bed, and ex-
claimed
" Oh, my God, why have you let this man come here? What

{051 l1and yet how I hate you ! What shall I do? What" shall
0 ' 7
At last she arose and cooled her eyes and forehead, and threw
a lace shawl over those white marble shoulders, and descended,
looking like a queen ; and very calm and steady was the voice in
which she said
" I am glad to see you again, Mr. Branscombe."
Supper was served, and over a good bottle of claret the Seraph
and Hudson got on amicably enough.
" By the way," said Raphael, "isn't there an island called Sark
one ought to seea place with cliffs and caverns, and that sort
of thing 7 "
"Oh yes," said Lady Emilia. "Suppose we go across to-
morrow, if it's ne. Your father will join us, I daresay, Mr.
Branscombe."
"To-morrow is rather too sharp," said Hudson. "We shall
have to take provisions; there's nothing on the island but lob-
sters and rabbits." '
"Very well; suppose we x it for early the next morning."
said Raphael. "My man, Louis, is a. capital caterer; he shall
look up provisions. We'll inquire about a boat the rst thing
to-morrow."
Thus it was arranged, the Seraph and Hudson making an
appointment to meet in the Market before breakfast; and then
he started for the Esplanade, having parted from Emilia with
just one pressure of the hand.
"She's a wonderfully ne woman," thought Raphael to him-
self, as he smoked his cigar, passing beneath the Bailiff 's garden
wall; "and she cares about as much as I do for that prig of a
Bouverie Hudson; but I must be careful. \Vhen those languid
creatures get possessed with the devil of love, they are infernally
troublesome; and there's Anne Page waiting for me, and poor
little Fiordilisa."
I think at that moment the Seraph wished himself back at
Isola Rossa again.
Louis was waiting for him. Devil Branscombe had not yet
got away from his whist. The Seraph gave his valet some orders
about the Sark expedition and dismissed him. Then he sat by
the window, watchingthe moonlight upon the sea and a ood of
glistening silver, and reflected on his position. It was rather an
amusing one.
By and byhe heard a tap at the door, and said, " Come in !"
-entered the widow's prettiest daughter. She wanted to know
what time he would like to breakfast.
" What's your name, child 1 " asked the Seraph.
" Ellen, sir."
" Ah. And pray, Miss Nelly, what time does my respected
father generally hreakfast'l"

" About twelve, sir."
L '; Amazing old gentleman ! And what time do you breakfast,

" At eight, sir."
" Good. Then you may bring me up a cup of coffee when you
breakfast, and mind you make it strong ; that's a good girl, and
mind you bring it yourself, for I know you'll look so con-
foundedly fresh and pretty in the morning, you'll give me an
appetite."
llen blushed. She was onl nineteen, this little girl, though
her line development caused er to look several years older.
There's a good deal of irtation in those islands, and she was not
wholly ignorant of the art. And the Seraph's unique beauty of
person fascinated her.
"Come here, Nelly," he said. She approached him, and he
7. ve her what he called a fraternal kiss. "There, good night,
'ttle girl. Don't forget the coffee."
His father, who had let himself in with a latch-key, had been
an amused spectator of this brief scene.
" You get on fast. Ra hael," he remarked. " I fear you don't
improve. Now, Ellen, off to bed, or I'll tell your mamma of
your naughtiness."
"The Hudsons and I are going to Sark the day after to-
morrow," said the Seraph. " Will you come? How can we get
a boat 'l "
" I can nd you a clipping little cutter-yacht that will just do.
I want to see Sark, but certainly shouldn't have made any great
effort in that direction."
The following day the necessary arrangements were made:
'and the party was increased b two persons. These were a Mr.
and Mrs. Wugk who, notwit standing their user name, were
tolerany Eng ish Wugk was a musician of emish descent,
but born in En landa man of real genius as a composer,
but unutterably azy. Mrs. "'ugk was a native of Guernsey,
and one of the most charming of the island beauties. Ralph
Branscombe had made Wugk's ac uaintance at the club; and
encountering him in the Market, en isted him for the trip. He
was a capital comrade, knowing the island welland of course
Lady Emilia would be glad of a feminine companion.
So in due time they started, a pleasant party; and were
landed in Sark, an island where landing is difcultso difcult
indeed that the Lords of the Admiralty are said to have come
there on a tour of inspection, and to have gone away again
without discovering where the harbour lay. The legend is not
incredible ; the tunnel by which you must approach the interior
is quite invisible from the sea. I have always fancied that
Circe's mystical island must have been very like Sark. But

Naftel, who has done upon canvas, for its cliffs and boys, what
words can never do. Its caverns are wondrous. The Gouliots
are famous for their pulation of zooph s, many very rare;

olive-green, hides the rugged walls. But the Boutiques are
transcendent] ne. After scrambling through tortuous pas-
sages in half- arkness, it is glorious to come out upon a platform
of rock beneath a Titanic ortal open to the ocean. Surely the
sons of Poseidon dwelt in t ose colossal halls, and looked forth
upon the solitary waste of waters. Does that single white sail

Our par stayed longer in the island than they at rst in-
tended. T e wind chan ed, so that they could not easily get
back to Guernsey-and t ey thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful
loneliness of the place. It is a charming islet for lovers of lazi-

culina skill, and produced a marvellous variety of capital
dishesrzrom these materials only.
One day they started to see the Boutiquesall but Devil

You go along a broad green terrace above the sea; t e steep
grassy slope beneath grows steeper as it descends to the brink of
the cliff. This is on your right ; presently you pass an opening
on your left, which gives you a view right through the island.
A little farther the. path narrows and grows steeper; and then
you have to descend and reascend in a way which Alpine club-
men would think a trie, but which perplexes weak nerves.
Hudson and Lady Emilia were in advance ; then Wugk and his
wife; nally Raphael.
Suddenly there was a pause.
" I can't stand this," said Hudson. "I'm getting giddy. You'd
better turn back, ZEmilia."
"Indeed I shall do nothing of the kind. I came out to see
the caves, and I mean to see them. If you are 'ddy, go back
and wait ; Mr. Wugk will take care of me, and h r. Branscombe
of Mrs. Wugk."
Hudson acceded to this arrangement; but presently Mrs.
ank's courage also failed, so Raphael brought her back and left
her with Hudson.
" Lady Emilia can't come to much harm now," said the Seraph,
" as there will be two of us to take care of her."
The trio made their way through the caverns, standing at last
upon a great ocean-threshold, with a gateway of giants above. It
was a strangely beautiful way to approach that vast stretch of
hyaline. A sail or two, far offa seamew or two, nearer at hand
-no other sign of life. The golden sunlight slept upon an immea-
surable waste of blue.
To return was found rather harder work than entry had been.

They were getting on very well, however, when Lady Emilia
felt faint, and was unable to proceed. After some little discus-
sion, Raphael said
" You see, she's afraid to go on. We must get a boat round.
I'll go and see to it, if you'll stay with Lady Emilia."
" No, no," she said. " Let Mr. Wugk gohe knows the island
better~he will be quicker."
And Wugk, seeing no objection to the arrangement, went.
" Well," thought Raphael, " she is determined to have a tti-d-
le'tc with me. I deserve a scolding, no doubt, and 1 supp05e she
means to give me one."
He found her a comfortable seat of the everlasting granite, and
then lighted a cigarette.
" Why did you come here, Raphael?" she asked after a time.
" Not to see you, child I had lial duties to perform. Hav-
ing erformed them, I mean to be o'."
"I wish you were drownin in that water, Raphael. I should
like to watch you sinking, an know that I could save you if I
liked."
" And not do it, of course, amiable girl ! Tell me now, what
harm have I done you?"
" Did not you make me love you? Is that no harm, when you
cared nothing for me, when I had to marry another man i"
" Well, you don't seem to have much love for me now ; and as
that is the case, and as you have a husband with plenty of money,
1 again say I have done you no harm."
" \Vhat, there is no harm in remorseno harm in lyin beside
a husband I detestno harm in being a murderess! am a
murderess, if longing to do murder makes one. I want to be
away from these tempting cli's. I fearoh, 1 fear I shall push
him over the brink some day."
" Really, Emilia," he said calmly, " you are very foolish. You
are a perfect child to talk all this nonsense. Hudson seems a
very good fellowtry and be comfortable with him."
" Yes. that's itthat's the way you talk. Oh, why couldn't I
guess all this before I loved you? You win a woman's love-
you win a woman who is your slave, who would die for you,
who cares for no other creature in the wide world, and then you
crush her and throw her away, caring no more for her than for
the end of a cigar. Oh, I know now; but why can't girls know
in time, before they begin to love men with the beauty of devils
and with ten times more cruelty l"
Raphael was taken aback by this torrent of words. He said
nothing, but wished the boat would come round; and by good
luck so it did, within ve minutes.
"If I kill him it is your doing," she whispered, as they ad-
vanced towards the boat.
"Tired of waiting?" shouted Hudson cheerily. "Catch me
going to see caverns again !"

Next day the wind shifted, and they got back to Guernsey, no
murder having as at been committed. And the day after,
Ra hael took the mail-steamer to Southampton, resolving to leave
La y Emilia to her own devices. And, as we have seen, Claudia
heard of him from Clarges Street.
CHAPTER XIIL
m ELOPEMENT.
SWEET Anne Page was exceedingly dissatised with what she
had done. She was a timorous creature, and had written
to Humphrey in a fright, and now was in a fright as to the
result. Anne was a plazasitic planta clinging creature, unable
to stand alone. Her eart was a treasure of sweetness, which she
was glad to bestow on any one who seemed to deserve it. Hum-
phrey Morll had accurately estimated her receptive and reective
character. With Stephen she was thoughtful and dreamy ; with
Humphrey she was gay and vivacious ; and at both times she was
happy. But now her letter had lled her with remorse and
terror. She thought of Stephen, whom her father had deemed
worthy to wed her. With a pang of regret she thought of Hum
phrey, to whom she had offered herself in sudden fear, with utter
dismay. What should she do? Of whom should she ask coun
sel? If Claudia had not left Kingsleat, I believe Anne would
have thrown herself at her feet and confessed everything, for she
had faith in her cousin, while she feared her; but for her uncle
Walter and Winifred she had only fear, no faith.
She sat in the schoolroom at the Rectory, thinking of these
things, in her hand some dreary volume of lessons, which she
was sugposed to be learning. Not a word was visible to her
trouble eyes. Stiff Miss Marsden sat opposite her, doing some
ridiculous feminine work. The forenoon was a bright one, soften-
ing towards spring; and poor little childish Anne, if there had
been anybody to love and guide her, would have been as good and
as happy a girl as you would wish to see on a spring morning.
Immured in a schoolroom, tortured with long lessons, threatened
with a marriage to some one she had never seen she was
thoroughly miserableQ Anne always dreaded people she did not
know, and always loved people whom she knew ever so little, if
they would let her. If the Raphael Branscombe who terried
her could have entered at this moment, he might easily have won
her from both her boyish wooers.
" Are you ready with your lesson, my dear I" asked the gover-
ness, in the chill voice of the species.
## p. 117 (#127) ############################################
AN ELOPEMENT. "1
Anne started, conscious of her naughtiness. She did not even
know what. book she had in her hand. It turned out to be a
work by the ingenious M. Le Page, with this sort of thing in it
"Josphine, je viens d'inviter M. L. a doiuuner, qu'as tn a nous
donner'i Du jambon, des coielettes, du fromage, et de la creme
avec le cafe. 11 v a en has des mufs tout frnis, on pent ajouter
une omelette." Breaking down over "jambon," Anne burst into
tears.
"You are not well, my dear, I am afraid," said the governess.
" Have you a headache? Would you like to go and lie down i "
Anne $55811in to the proposition, lad to obtain solitude.
When she reached her own room she ocked the door, and sat
down and tried to think ; but she was in no state to decide what
she ought to do. Alwa 's trustful and irresolute. she was at this
moment pliant as a ree . She could come to no decision. There
was no one she could ask. She could only moan and sob, and
wish sometimes for Stephen, sometimes for Humphrey, sometimes
even for Claudiaand often, ah, how often, poor child, for her
lost father.
There came a tap at the door.
"They can't let me alone," she murmured frett'ully. " I shall
have to take some gruel, or some senna, or something. I am very
wretched."
She opened the door, and there entered not, as she expected,
her cousin or the governessbut the parlour~maid, Rebecca.
She was a wonderful smart young person, with a. fly-away air,
and a taste for cherrv-coloured ribbons. Humphrey, guessing
that the wearer of such nery was corruptible, had made her his
messenger by occasional half-crowns, and on this occasion she
brought Anne a letter from him.
"My poor little pet, I will save you. Come down into the
garden t is evening at eleven, or as soon after as you can. Becky
will open the side-door for you. Don't be afraid. Put on your
bonnet and shawl, as it is very cold.
" Just tell Becky to sayyesYour loving
" H unrnnsr."
" Yes. Becky," said Anne emphatically, so delighted with de-
nite guidance that she did not hesitate a moment.
"You've been crying, miss," said Becky familiarly. " I
wouldn't, it I were you. There's nobody dare put upon you,
,now,Miss Claudia is gone. You're a better lady than any of
em.'
This well-meant speech was made in consequence of Humphrey's
orders to Becky to advise Miss Page to keep u her spirits ; but
as she went downstairs the. ighty cameriste sai to herself
"Silly little chit! "'hat does she want crying there like a
baby i I'm sure 1 don't Wonder at Miss Claudia's whipping her.

I wonder what Mr. Humphrey can see in herbut there, she's got
money.'
And Becky tossed her cherry-coloured cap-ribbons, and thou%ht,
if she had money, how the young men would all be after er.
And by and by she managed to slip out and convey the afrma-
tive monosyllable to Morll, who was lying perdu at a public-
house near the Rectory, and who gave Becky a sovereign and
certain directions to which she romised attention.
Humphrey, as we have said, ad one straight to Idlechester,
and to Stephen's rooms. He found is old friend in a dreamy,
melancholy mood.
" Well, old boy," he said, " you seem dull in these queer rooms
of yours. Do you stay here all day? Why don't you wake up
a little 'l "
"Oh, I go out often enough," replied Stephen. "But I am
rather dull, I confess."
" No wonder. And it's entirely your own fault ; our money
makes you independent. Why not go to college you'll be
jolly enough there."
" I don't want to be jolly," said Stephen. " But what brings
you here in the middle of term? Anything the matter 'I "
"Well," said Humphrey hesitatingly, "the fact is this. I
want you to do me, if you can, a great favour. I want to borrow
two hundred pounds for about three months. And you must
trust to my honour : I cannot tell you what I want it foronly
there's a lady in the case."
"You can have it to-morrow morning as soon as the bank

" I'm going to stay here," said Morll, "and, what's more, I
mean to sleep on your sofa, if you'll let me. I don't wish it
generally known that I am not at Cambridge And, by the way,
if you are going out at all, stroll down to the Half Moon, and
hear if anybod talks about me. I got oh" the coach half a mile
from town, an don't think I was recognised."
Stephen did as he was told, and found that Humphrey had not
quite succeeded in maintaining his incognito.
"Why, there's an old friend of yours in town, Mr Stephen,"
said Jack Winslow. " How is it he's not with you I"
" I have no friends, Miss Winslow, old' or new," Said Stephen
solemnly.
"l'h, don't talk such stu' ! But you can't mean to say you
haven't seen Mr. Morll'l"
"My dear Jack, I regret to nd that you are losing your
sanity. Is it incipient D. T., and must I warn that respectable
old gentleman whom you condescend to acknowledge as papa
that it is time you were sent to the County Lunatic Asylum"!
Your head should be shaved, and you should be put in a strait
waistcoaL" '

" What nonsense you are talking ! I tell you Mr. Morll came
in by this evening's coach, and I want to know what he has
come for."
"I should think you did. So should I if I thought he was
here. Is it likely he'd leave Cambridge in the middle of term l"
" I don't know what's likely," said Jack. " 1 only know
Harry Tipper says he saw him."
" Did you ever know Harry drive that last stage sober? Says
he saw him ! Saw old Vosper the butcher, that wei ,hs tWenty
stone, and thought he was such a genteel young man, e must be
fresh from the University."
Thus cunningly did Stephen attempt to conceal his rival from
observation, little guessing the direction of Hum hrey's designs.
And the next morning he drew from the ban' two hundred
pounds, which he handed to his friend; and Humphrey got
quietly away, leaving Stephen under the impression that he was
going back to Cambridge. Instead of this, he made his way to
'Kingsleat, and entered into negotiations with his old ally of the
cherry-coloured ribbons.
The evening was dull at the Rectory. The evenings always
were so, now that the brilliant Claudia had departed, and there
was no "swell" baronet dropping in to irt with her. The
Rector and his daughter lived le'te-d~te'te. and with the dessert
entered our little friend Anne, demure and infantile, plump and
petile, still in the short frocks and fringed pantaloons to which
she had been relegated by the perecuting Panther. When they
went to the drawing-room, Winifred was wont to sit by the tire
and read some saintly book, while Anne looked out of the window
till it became too dark to see anything. Then the Rector came
and had his co'ee,-and read the London morning paper, which
reached Idlechester about eight o'clock. He was a taciturn man,
who seldom found in his journal anything to talk about. Some
children would have found pabulum in the books. illustrated
and otherwise, in which the house ubotinded. Stephen, for ex-
ample, would have been only too content to be thus let alone
but Anne was a social creature, who pined for a loving voice and
a protecting arm. She did not care to read, but would listen
by the hour if any one read to her. Her sweetness was like the
fragrant spirit of the limoncina tree, which yields itself to the
cares~ing hand.
This evening seemed interminable. Anne thought the Rector
would never come to the drawing-roomthat he would never
have nished his Morning Chroniclethat the time for prayers
would never arrive. But it came at last; and, as the Rev.
Walter Branscombe's sonorous voice read the evening lesson,
Anne was fascinated by the cherry-coloured cap ribbons gleamine
amid the line of servants. But at last there was an end; an
Anne, after the ordinar evening embraces, was, according to
custom, accompanied to er room by Miss Marsden, who always

made her kneel down and say a hymn in her presence. And in
time the governess departed, and Anne waited in a frightful
state of dgettiness, of ine'able terror, for eleven o'clock to come,
and for Becky to assure her that all was safe.
It was about ve minutes past the hour when Becky cautiously
opened the door, and found Anne in a terrible state of alarm and
antici ation. .
" ow, miss," she whispered, energetic in the ex ectation of
future sovereigns, " slip on your cloak and bonnetit's a dread-
fully frosty night. Mr. Humphrey's waiting."
Anne could do nothing for herself. Becky wrapped her up
and led her trembling down the back stairs to a side door which
opened on the rden. She could scarcely stand. But waitin
at the door was umphrey Morll, who took her in his arms and
kissed her.
"My darling!" he said, "I want you to come with me. I
have a carriage waiting. I will make you my wife to-morrow."
She did not understand him. She lay almost insensible in
his arms.
" It's no good talking to her, Mr. Humphrey," whispered the
practical parlour-maid" she's frightened to death almost. You
put (per in the coach and take her awayand that's what
on o."
y Humphrey acted on this excellent advice. He lifted Anne
into the postchaise, and o' it ew along the hard, frosty road.
Becky Went back to the house, fastened the side door with quiet
deliberateness, and did not look at Morll's parting gift till she
reachgd her room. It was a ten-pound note, and she had expected
only ve.
" Well," she said, " he's a generous young fellow, and deserves
a better wife than that poor thing. She is a baby, if I ever
saw one."
Becky had locked the door of Anne's room, and removed the
key. It was Miss Mnrsden's custom in the morning. when her-
self dressed, to go to her pupil's room, and see that she was pro-
perly attired, and cause her to repeat another hymnthe most
punctual of young persons, she never failed to be at Anne's door
at eight precisely.
The door was locked, and Anne did not open it.
"The child must be ill," said the governess. " How silly of
her to lock her door. I must tell Miss Branscombe."
But Winifred was in her bath, and did not mean to be dis-
turbed for anything, and, when the governess reiterated her raps
at the door, exclaimed in an unsaintl y way
" Wait, can't on 1"
When her to' et was a trie more advanced, she threw on a
loose wrapper, and, appearing on the landing, said to the gover-
ness
" Well, what is it?"

"Miss Page's door is locked, and we can't make her hear. I
am afraid she's ill. She complained of headache yesterday."
" Pooh ! There's nothing the matter with hershe's very sly.
Tell her you'll punish her if she doesn't open the door."
Miss Marsden conveyed the threat, but of course nothing came
of it, and at last. the Rector was aroused by the unusual noise.
He had the door forced open. We are already aware of what he
was likely to nd.
There was poor little Anne's bed, unsle t in. The room was
tidy as usualjust as tidy as when she ha knelt down and said
her hymn to the governess the night before. There was nothing
to prate of her whereabouts. Nor could any creature in the
Rectory, except the maiden of the cherry-coloured cap-ribbons,
guess what had become of her. The Rector was utterlv per-
plexed, and could not tell what in the world to do. He felt no
disposition to publish abroad the fact that his ward was miss~
ing, so at length he determined to wait awhile, and see if she
returned.
But during the morning the rumour of her disa pearance
travelled beyond the Rectory walls into the town of ingsleat.
And it encountered and coalesced with another rumour, which
was that a ostchaise with four horses, from the Mitre, had taken
M r. Humphrey Mortill and a female companion a stage out of
Kingsleat, on the North road.
As when acid meets alkali, and neutral salt is formed, so these
two rumours combined to form a thirdthat Mr. Mortill had run
away with Miss Page. The Rector heard this at last, and started
for the Mitre to question the landlord of that ancient hotel and
posting house. On his way he was joined by Dr. Winter, who
rad heard the same rumour, and had started on the same errand.
Stout, old, rubicund Dawson, when these two magnates of the
town, both clergymen, and one a country magistrate, came to
ask him what he knew of the matter, would have turned pale
if it had been iossible. He told them all he knewwhich was
that Mr. Morl had engaged post horses late the previous even-
ing, and that they started between eleven and twelve, and that
they had since returned. A postboy was called in, and stated that
they took Mr. Mortill and a lady to Radford, and that he got fresh
horses at the Bell, and went on immediately.
"Didn't you think there was something wrong, DaWson," said
Dr. Winter, "when a mere boy like my nephew ordered post-
horses I"
"No, sir," replied Dawson. "The young gentleman has
always been so very steady, 1 took his order just as soon as if it
was yours."
The two clergymen left the hotel, convinced that the thing was
done, and that no interference could avail.
" You call your nephew a mere boy," said the Rector. " Is he
of age 1"

I22 SWEET ANNE PAGE;
" He is twenty-two," said Winter. " This is a sad business for
you, of course, but for me it is worse. That boy was my adopted
son ; I thought him incapable of meanness and dishonour ; I
hoped that he would have a noble career. Now 1 hope never to
see him again. I thank God he is not my son."
" You are too harsh, my dear friend," re lied the Rector. " He
is a fine intelligent young man, and thong his conduct has been
inexcusable, I would not give him up altogether. Young men are
not always amenable to reason when there is a lovely girl in the
case. He may have a ne career before him yet."
" I cannot agree with you." said Dr. Winter briey.
The Rector went home, with a great deal of corres ondence on
his hands. He wrote to Mr. Drax and to Raphae . Winifred
poured out her indignation to Claudia in a letter inexplicably
crossed. The Panther's feelings on receiving it may easily be
imagined. And Raphael was not at home that morninghad
gone off to Richmond the revious afternoon, and had not re-
turnedso that she could nd nobody to sym athise with her,
but walked up and down the Clurges Street rawing-room in
im otent anger. The idea of that little Anne Page serving them
sue a trickand with Humphrey Morll, too, whom she had
believed quite safe. And now Stephen Langton, who had rejected
her, would be almost a rich man, with half Mr. Page's money.
Claudia could not resist telling Sir Arthur Willesden of the atlair,
when the baronet paid a morning visit.
" Awby Jove ! " said the baronet, " how interesting ! Why,
Miss Pageawwas quite a child I thinkshort frocksaw~
and all that sort of thing. I wishawthat I could be the hero
-swof an elopement, Miss Branscombe."
"Do you? I wish I had the heroine of this elopement here,"
said the Panther, looking an thing but amiable.
"Wellawlet us hope s e will never repent it."
" She will; she shall. She shall be sorry for it every day of
her life."
Claudia did not quite see how to full this tremendous threat,
but felt that she should like to realise it. Sir Arthur, nding his
charmer in rather a terrifying humour this morning, did not pro-
long his visit.
Raphael did not see his sister till late. He dined out, but
found her awaiting him at eleven, when he returned. She
brought out her news at once.
" Anne Page has run away with young Morll, Raphael !"
He looked rather pleased than otherwise.
" When did that happen 'f " he asked.
" The night before last. They must be married by this time."
" Of course. It does young Mortill credit. You see he was
not quite such a fool as you thought him, Claudia. Well, I need
not 0 down to Kingsleat now."
" on take it very coolly."

Claudia did not reply. She was always a little alarmed when
Ra hael approached this subject.
'he news did not take long in travelling to Idlechester.
Stephen, loungin" past the Half Moon in the afternoon, was
called in by the andlord, who had just heard the story from
some of the Kingsleat folk. He was perfectly astounded. Him-
self trustful and worthy of trust. he could not believe in Mor-
ll's havin thus acted. And to borrow money of him for the
purpose ! t was incredihle.
Alas, the incredible is too often the truees cially when
human character is the basis of our incredulity. tephen found
the evidence too strong for him. He sat down in the inn tar-
lour, and drank a glass of port wine which kind-hearted ack
Winslow got for him.
" It can't be true," he said to himself.
"It's no good to take on so," said the bright-eyed barmaid,
eager to console him. " There's as good sh in the sea as ever
came out of it."
" I shall never marry, Jack," he said. "I believed in Anne ;
I can never believe in anybody else. And I trusted Morll too ;
he was my friend. There is no such thing as friendship in the
world. or love either."
" What ought I to do, Jack?" he said after a time. " I'm a
mere boy, you know; I don't know what a man ought to do. I
suppose Mr. Branscombe now would shoot him."
" Don't talk in that cruel way," she said. " The Branscombes
ain't men and women. from all I hear ! they've no hearts in their
bodies. You leave Mr. Humphrey alone ; you'd only break Miss
Anne's heart if you were to kill him ; and perhaps you would be
killed ourself.'
" I should like that," said Stephen calmly.
A day or two later, when letters had arrived from Humphrey
pl)ausible letters, admirably concocted, but which deceived
no dythe great Mr. Drax xed a time for reading the sealed

codicil, and Stephen found himself the possessor of an additional
two thousand a year. He wanted to decline it in favour of her
whom we must now call Mrs. Morll, but Mr. Drax assured him
this was out of the uestion.
"Humphrey Mo 1 is better off than he deserves," said the
lawyer, and his auditors fully agreed with him.
When the rst shock was over, Stephen thought a great deal
about Claudia. He recollected her threat that he should never
marry Anne Page. Had she contrived this elopement'l It seemed
impossible, but he had learned to doubt impossibilities. And
then he vividly recalled the Panther-"s beauty and brilliancy
and that strange moment when she un herself into his arms
and wondered whether she really hated im now. The idea of
being loved by such a creaturea woman wholly different from all
other women of his experiencea woman whom he found him-
self comparing with those imperious and terrible beauties who
lived in the maddening atmos here of the Home of the Caesars
was in itself a fascination. e did not love her as he had loved
the honey-sweet girl who had been stolen from him; but how
ne it would be to tame such a glorious creature, to possess her,
to make a slave of one who seemed born to be mistress and queen.
It was a cruel lust of conquest that lie feltnot love.
And having ascertained that she was likely to remain in
London, he resolved to go thither. Stephen had never seen
London; his world lay Within a radius of twenty miles or less,
round Idlechester Cathedral. He would go to London. He
communicated his intention to the great Mr. Drax, whom in his
boyhood he had regarded with reverent awe, but who was now
assiduously affable to his young client; and Mr. Drax recom-
mended him to go to the Cha ter Coffee-house in St. Paul's
Churchyard, and wrote down or him a few memoranda of
guidance.
I suppose, in describing the effects of Anne Page's evasion,
I have permitted time enough to ela se for her to reach Gretna
and become Mrs. Morll. She was he pless when the post-chaise
started. Humphrey held her in his arms, and corn orted her,
and at Redford, where they rst changed horses, he made her take
a little brandy. He had no fear of pursuit, feeling pretty sure
of about eight hours' start. At the rst possible lace, and after
daylight had arrived, he purchased some addition we pages for
Anne ; he had taken her away with only alight cloa thrown
over her ordinary dress. It was a cold, long, dreary ride; but
with hot coffee at every stage, he contrived to keep her from
freezing; and she slept in his arms like a child through a great
part of the 'ourney.
At last t ey crossed the Border, and reached the dwelling of
the blacksmith priest, and were welded together in his rough
fashion, Anne rather unresisting than consenting. In the pre-
sence of a strong will she was powerless. She was doing wrong,

she knew ; she dreaded to think of Stephen, of Claudia ; but she
could not 0 pose Humphrey. So Mr. and Mrs. Morll duly
reached the Jflush Hotel at Carlisle, and sat down together to an
excellent dinner, amid the suppressed amusement of chamber-
mnids and the like. For be it remembered that Anne was still
in frock and frilled calepons, looking uite a child. But this was
a trie, which by the landlady's kind el was soon amended.
Humphrey wrote a series of letters to t e Rector, to Mr. Drax,
to his uncle, to Stephen. The Rector replied formally and cere-
moniously, expressing his extreme regret that his niece's character
had been injured by a runaway marriage, and 110 ing that Mr.
Morll's future conduct would in some degree ero 'e amends for
his imprudence. Mr. Drax communicated the contents of the
codicil, whereat Humphre was very angry, holding it a great
shame that Stephen shoul have half the property. Dr. Winter
wrote a curt severe letter, in which he disowned his nephew
entirely, and requested him to refrain from writing to him.
Stephen Langton made no answer.
From Carlisle, Humphrey had one to Wetheral, a beautiful
village on the divine river Eden, w ere he found uiet lodginvs.
He was too shrewd to spend much money in trare ling until he
could grasp his wife's'property. So he spent a few quiet weeks
at this place, which 'ordsworth has immortalised, and which
De Quincey loved. The red railway bridge over the Eden had
not then been built; the only way across to Corby Castle was by
Mr. Ho'vard's ferry. Belted Will Howard has forded that river
in the rare old days; and there have been border ghts there;
and perchance Su- William of Deloraine, good at need, has
splashed into the roaring torrent.
" To the peers of Scotland woe ! when the strong shafts y like snow
Such the shout of long ago
Time of slaughter.
"Ah, the dream is all forgot. One sole beauty of the spot,
Changing ever, changes not

moon.

CHAPTER XIV.
srnrnnn IN LONDON.
STEPHEN went to town by the night mail. He took no
leave of his relations, which caused 'Aunt Harriet, when she
heard he was gone, to talk of his "black-hearted ingratitude ; "
but indeed his brain was in a whirl, Anne Page's unfaithfulness
had been so sudden a shock, that he could not collect himself
after it. He would hardlv have taken formal leave of his kind-
hearted condante, Jack Winslow, if that young lady had not
been on the spot when the coach started. Indeed, Jack generally
saw the mail 011', and occasionally, as my readers are aware, drove
a stage herself.
In a very dreamy state was Stephen Langton. Idlechester,
with its beautiful river, its mighty minster, with patulous elms
of immemorial growth about it; its picturesque High Street and
Market Cross, in those days unrestored, for Gilbert Scott had not
arisen; Mr. Page's house, with its gardens that seemed a frag-
ment of Elysium; his grandfather's house and tanyard, and his
grandfather himselfall these things seemed a part of his er-
sonal identity. But now, in the broad moonlight, on the ox
behind four hourses, racing along the London road with wide
stretches of undulating chalk down lying bare beneath the moon
on either side, Stephen began to think that the Cathedral City
was a dream of the pastthat there had been no reality in his
visions of the Close, the river, the tanyardthat even Claudia
Branscombe and Anne Page were creatures of the element. Here
are four lines of a poem that the young gentleman had sent to
Fraser (then in the vigour of its hot youth), which may show
something of the state of his mind-
" And I long through the gloomy gate of the unknown world to go,
Where truth is whispered, perohance, by angels under their
breath -
For I know ncit whether the dreams I dream are dreams or no,
Or whether to die is life, or whether to live is death."
Strange fancies had he nurtured in those quaint rooms in
Little College Green ; and he had read the opium-dreams of De
Quincey, and the lever~faucies of Hoffman. And now, as the
long panorama of down and Woodland, of slee ing villages and
towns, swept swiftly by, he looked upon Idlec ester as a dream
upon the present as a. dreamand marvelled whether he should
still dream on without hope of wakeuing.

" STEPHEN IN LONDON. 1:7
Lo! 0 Huh in the EastAurora rising bathed in one tinglin'v
blush from the couch of 'l'ithonus. Early, before the sordi
smoke has had time to veil the beauty of the sleeping city, the
mail enters London. Stephen saw it as a great poet had seen it
from Westminster Bridge, and thought with Wordsworth, that
"Earth has not anything to show more fair."
The man who has not Icoked upon London when
" The City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning "
when, in an intense calm that may be felt, "all that mighty
heart is lying still," has yet to see one of the most pathetic and
majestic sights the world can show.
Stephen, dismouuting at one of those dear old Holburn hos-
telries, was with his luggage rattled in a ramshackle hackney-
coach to the Cha ter Coffee-house, and, being cold and still, and
having a ne hea thy capacity for sleep, very wisely went to bed.
.\Ir. Drax did Well to send him to a place like the Chapter.
Young men were seldom seen in that home of middle-aged
rlengymen and old port; there was nobody who could lead the
\"erdant young visionary astray, whereas, if he had been landed
in a Covent Garden hotel, he would soon have been introduced
to the vulgar vice of the metropolis ; and Stephen was of a tem-
perament only too easily misled. The eye creates beaul , and
music is the product of the ear. Stephen's imaginative Kiculty
was of a quality to paralyse his judgment. Any clever hetaim
might ruin him.
He locked himself into his room with a feeling of intense
satisfaction. He always felt a delight in the isolation and inde-
pendence of the bed-chamber. There, without interruption, he
could indulge in sleeping. or in waking dreams. Elia has de-
voted a delightful essay to the praises ot'bed ; but the majority of
us do not half enjoy that delicious locality. Thomson, perhaps,
best understood its luxury, its innite resources; and to read
The Castle of Indolence in bedthe rst part, 1 mean, before the
vexatiously-virtuous knight arrives to disturb the enchantment
of the placeis a great treat. Well, Stephen, within that quaint
old comfortable den in the shadow of St. Paul's, built for himself
a city within a citya microscopic London of the imagination,
widely different from the real capital; and he dwelt with his
visions till nearly one o'clock, when he descended to 100k for
braikfast.
The coffee-room, amber in its prevailing hue, was deserted. A
noble re was burning ; the morning papers lay on a table near
it; Stephen contentedly seated himself thereby, and rang for
breakfast. Frederic, the head waiter, the most urbane, not to
say ecclesiastical of waiters, awaited his orders. Young gentle-

men were rather out of place in this dignied atmosphere; but
this young gentleman was recommended by Mr. Drax, of Idle-
chester, a good customer, an attorney that did business for
bishops and deans; so Frederic patronised him. He gave him
the hottest and strongest coffee in a silver ewer, the richest
cream, the greenest watercresses, the freshest eggs, the thinnest
slices of the ruddiest and most toothsome ham. Stephen took
his ease in his inn with as much gusto as if he had been Jack
Falstaff or Dr. Johnson.
" Would he dine at home i" asked Frederic. He would, and
on that affable waiter's suggestion, ordered dinner at sixa bit
of sh and a rump-steak and oyster-sauce, and then he started
to see London. His rst few ste s took him into the great
Churchyard. Why should not he egin by seeing St. Paul's?
He entered, and, by an expenditure of about ve shillings, man-
aged to see everything, from the catacombs to the hollow ball at
the summit. As he climbed the rude staircase by which the
visitor passes through the monstrous timber ribs on which the
dome is constructed, he thought of Piranesi, the architect, who
in his fever dreams imagined himself climbing endless stair-
cases up through interminable heights of architecture. Stephen
reached the ball, and looked from its rectangular openings u on
the Lilliputian world below. Now that London is so ovsrcrow ed,
why should not a colony nd airy lodgings in the skeleton of the
dome of St. Paul's?
I scarcely know what places the young explorer did not see
that day. He went eastward as far as the Tower; he went west-
ward as far as Piccadilly. He returned to Faitleul1's cosy quar-
ters dead beat; so long a walk over avement had thoroughly
tired him. But Frederic had remembered him; his table was
laid, and, by the time he had eaten his steak and drunk for the
rst time some of the famous London stout, Stephen was himself
again. The waiter, who had taken a fancy to him, actually
allowed him to have a bottle of 15s. port; and our hero, sipping
this nectar and cracking his lberts, almost forgot Anne age
and the tragical fact that his heart was broken.
Although the other occupants of the coffee-room were chiey
clergymen, they were not devoid of vivacity. Stephen watched
with much interest a party of three who dined at a table near
him. One of these, a man nearly ft , but bearing his years as
if they were a light load, was evident y facetious almost beyond
endurance. then the sweet 0' the night came on, and the duller
folk retired, and the trio in question had begun to smoke, their
laughter had scarcely any intermission. Every now and then
Stephen caught snatches of strange rhyme, as thus-
" Sow your poetic oats
Not to say wild oats ;
Give up the petticouts
On which this child dotes !'

STEPHEN IN LONDON. 129
By and by these three gentlemen and Stephen were the sole
occu ants of the room ; whereupon the Rhymer said
" rederic, bring the materials for a bowl of punch. And," he
continued, addressing Stephen, " if you, young gentleman, are
not afraid of a splitting headache in the morning, perhaps you'll
come over and join us 7"
Ste hen expressed his pleasure.
"Ylduth," said the unknown, "seldom enters this mahogany-
coloured room, or sees dignitaries of the Church drink good
punch and make bad verses. But it may not be unprotable to
you, my young friend, of whose name I am ignorant '
" Stephen Langton, sir," he interposed.
" An excellent ecclesiastical namethe name of a man to whom
England owes much. It may not be unprotable to you, Mr. Lang-
ton, to learn by actual observation that clergymen are human."
"Some clergymen," remarked one of his friends.
"A timely ualication, my worth frre. The priesthood are
indeed divisib e into three classes ; t ey are either men, women,
or ends. Now my endish brother would excommunicate me
and send meyou all know wherefor concocting this wonderful
bowl of liquid headache ; and my womanish brother would pray
for me hysterically ; but you, my manly brethren, will right
manfully help me to drink it."
The punch was worthy of its maker, whose humorous eye
twinkled as he tasted it.
" Will it do, Mr. Langton 'l" he asked.
" I never tasted punch before," said Stephen frankly. " It is
delicious."
" Frederic," said the Rhymer, "see that'the doors are shut, or
my bass voice may wake some of my sleeping brethren. I am
about to sing a song which I did into English 'from Branger the
other day. 'Tis called The Keys of Paradise."
He had a noble bass voice, and did justice to the rather hete-
rodox lyric.
" Noble Saint Peter lost, of late,

Why not tell us your story 1 You n('('ll not name names, as the

"I don't suppose," said Stephen, "it will do me any harm.
The simple truth is that I was engaged to marry a young lady,
with the approval of her father; that, on her father's death, her
guardians declined to allow me to see her; and that my most
intimate friend, having access to her, persuaded her to elope
with him."
"You are laudably laconic," said the Rhymer. "I hope the
event has not turned you into a Byrouic misanthrope. How old
was the lady l"
" Nearly seventeen."
"Ah! a child. You can't blame her. She is too young to
know her own mind. And the man you call your friend was not
your friend. Friends are few, Mr. Langton. your own friend.
fake your own part. That is the best advice I can give you.
And now, if it is not too late, and nobody objects, and the punch
is not exhausted, I'll tell you a short story."
The offer was received with enthusiasm.
"A young man whom I knew fell in love. He was the son of
a perpetual curatewhich happily does not mean a man doomed
to perpetual curacy. The lady whom he loved was the only
chi d of the lord of the manor, a many-acred buronet. She was
beautiful beyond the imagination of man, of course. Cola va
sans dire. When I last saw her she was a very puffy old per-
sonage.
"The hero of my story, whom I will call Smith, to save
trouble, was much given to dreaming. He dreamt one night that
a Greek book in his father's library lay open before him, and
that on one of the pages a single line stood out in rel letters, and
it was revealed to him that if he uttered that line thrice his lady-
love would come to him, wherever he was. But he could not,
when he awoke, recollect the line; and as he knew exactly as
much Greek as Byron's Donna Inez, it was not quite clear to him
how to look for it. He felt sure, however, that if he saw the line
he should recognise it.
"Now, though Smith was a dolt, Smith's father was very much
the reverse, and was the possessor of a very fair library, wherein
there was much Greek. Smith astounded his father by suddenly
taking to the study of Greek. It was in a curious fashion. though.
He took the rst Greek volume on a given shelf, seated himself
(he was a lazy rascal) in an easy chair, and looked carefully
through it for a certain line. Smith's father was amazed to see
his son read Greek so rapidly. Being a very Low Churchman,
and a rm believer in all manner of miracles, he began to think
his son had the gift of tongues. Smith rattled away through
Esch lus, Sophocles, Homer, Herodotus, Pindar, and Plato, and
a good man other fellows in the same line of business, at a pace
unparallele

"But, as the Irish proverb hath it
'Patience and perseverance
Found a wife for his Reverence ;'
which, as priests of the Latin schism can't by any possibility have
wives, was rather a hard matter. And so at last the mighty line
ashed upon Smith. This was it :

I'm not at all surprised at Smith's recognising it.
" Having recognised it he toiled hard to learn it by heart.
This did not take him above an hour and a half. He carried
away this famous line in his brain, and when he went to bed that
night he uttered the spell.
"At the rst utterance of the magical verse there was a sound
as if water were being poured into a vessel.
"At the second utterance of the magical verse there was a
strong smell of brown Windsor soap.
" At the third utterance of the magical verse the walls of the
chamber opened, and the lady entered, sitting in her night-dress,
with her feet in hot water." ,
Here the Rhymer made an obstinate pause.
"Did she speak] " asked Stephen "What happened '2 "
"I know nothing more. The canon says, Solua cum sold non
prrzsum'itu'r ware. The young man is now a bishop, and pretty
often in hot water himself."
Soon after this queer tale had been told, they went to bed, the
Rhymer telling Stephen that he should be glad to meet him at
breakfast. The other two gentlemen were off by an early coach
to distant country parsonages.
Stephen awoke the next morning with the great-grandfather
of headaches. He was young, you know, and unaccustomed to
punch. Much icy water scarcely remOVed the leaden o pression
on his brow, and he felt thankful that the breakfast our was
late. His new ac uaintance had ap ointed eleven.
And at eleven t ey met. Every ody else in that sedate hos-
telry llZi-ll breakfasth long before. With the sagacity which
experience confers, the Rhymer ordered Stephen to begin with
the soda and brandy, and then recommended im some anchovies
done on toast. To his amazement, our young Iriend found he
could eat. As to his companion, his appetite was Homeric.
And, having elicited from Stephen is position in the world,
and his utterly indenite designs, he proceeded to give him some
excellent advme. As it turned out entirely useless, it is scarcely
worth while to record it here. I am sure my readers would not
take any of it.
They were long over their breakfast. The Rhymer, as I must
continue to call him, for Stephen was unable to extract his name

from Frederic or anybody else in the establishment of the Faith-
full, had nothing to do all the morning, and so, as he said, could
indulge his laziness. So the ripe and thoughtful clergyman,
whose humour years had not destroyed, and the mere boy,
dreamy and poetic, full of wonder as to what years might give
him, gossi ,ped loiteringly together over their coffee.
Amid t eir gossip entered a singularly handsome young man,
of the middle height, dressed in the utmost fashion. The affable
Frederic approached him, somewhat awed by an aristocratic ap-
parition of an order that coffee-room seldom saw.
" \Vaiter," he said, "is Mr. Langton staying here?"
" This is Mr. Langton, sir," said Frederic.
Ste hen came forward.
" , Mr. Langton," said the stranger, "you have forgotten
me, no doubt. You were a boy when we met. My name is
BranscombeRaphael Branscombe. I heard you were in town
from our friend Drax, and I thought you might be puzzled
sometimes how to spend your evenings, so I thought I'd ask you
to look in upon us when you want amusement. Claudia and I
are at No. - Clargas Street. Claudia told me to say she would
always be glad to see you."
Which was quite true. When a note from Mr. Drax informed
Raphael. among other things, that Stephen was in town, he at
once said-
"I shall look up that boy. Claudia ! "
"What for? " asked the Panther, well aware that her brother
seldom did anything without a reason.
"Well, apart from the fact that he would be an exceedingly
good match for a certain young lady whom it is my duty to get
married" (Claudia winced), "there is never any harm in the
acquaintance of verdant boys with money."
" Don't victimise him, Raphael," leaded the Panther.
"You have still a tendresse for int. have you? \Vell, why
should all old Page's money go out of the family? Send him a
message, child."
"You may tell him I shall always be glad to see him."
" Very well. Don't. be surprised if I bring him home to
dinner.'
Raphael drove his mail-phaeton eastwardspecially to call on
Stephen. And, after the speech already narrated, he sat down,
and called for a int of claret, and the three entered into desul-
tory converse. aphael perceived that the Rhymer, whoever he
might he, belonged to a higher order of mind than he commonly
encountered ; while the Rhymer studied Raphael with much
interest, as a variety of the human animal entirely new to him.
I wish he'had had to describe him rather than I.
"Let me give you a drive, Mr. Langton," said Raphael.
"London is famous as possessing the most beautiful suburbs of
any city in the world. I've a pair of horses outside that want

exercise, and I've nothing in the world to do this morning, so
~vou'll be doing me a service by accepting."
Stephen acce ted. Raphael took him through Brompton and
Fulham, across utney Bridge, that villainous old structure, up
the hill to the heath, and then away to the right through Rich-
mond Park, across Richmond Bridge, and along the banks of the
Thames, through Twickenham and Teddington and Hampton
Wick to Hampton Court. He put his horses u at the Toy, and
showed Stephen the Palace, and then they ounged into the
Tennis Court.
" a Y, '
" ou play'l said Raphael.
" Ah ! that's unlucky ; 'twould have given you an appetite for
a. bit of luncheon. Here, marker, come and play."
Having beaten the marker with innite easefor, as I have
said, Raphael was master of all gameshe proposed that they
should lunch. So they returned to the Toy and refreshed them-
seIVes, Stephen all the while wondering at his companion's cool
and skilful style of doing everything.
Returning, Raphael drove northward through Weston. getting
into the Uxbridge Road somewhere near Hanwell, and making
his way through Ealing and Acton to homewards. It was a long
and pleasant drive; there was life on the great roads in those
days before steam; and it was past ve o'clock when Raphael
pulled up in Clarges Street.
" We dine at six," he said to Stephen. "Come in. There
will be no one but my sister, who'll forgive your dress. Come to
my dressing-room and wash your hands."
Stephen presently found himself in the drawing-room alone,
his companion having excused himself to look after the wine.
" I'm always my own butler," he said in his airy fashion.
So Stephen lay back in a soft chair of ruddy velvet, and
looked at the hot caverns of re amid the coals in the grate, and
dreamt. His heart was pal itating with a dread of Claudia, whose
last words had told him t at she hated himand with a long-
ing to subjugate and tame her, a wild and beautiful and queenly
creature, with all the subtler of womanhood, and all the strength
of manhood. His quick brain went off in its usual way, com-
bining, plotting, imagining scenes, and with the vanity of inex-
erience, fancying his victor won. He was a new AlnSt'hl'. As
ie mentally revelled in a ne dramatic situation. in which the
Panther was sobbing at his feet, the silence was disturbed by a
rustle of silk, and a voice which he had never forgottena voice
that he had heard imperious and imperial, that he had heard
broken and beseeching, that he had heard whispering passion-
ately in his ear the strong temptation of an olfered lovesaid
calmly
. " How do you do, Mr. Langton?"
And they were seated opposite each other and talked. And

STEPHEN IN LONDON. I 35
he looked in vain into those great black eyes for either the soft
light of love or the angry glare of rage. And he thought to him-
self, "Ah, me, what do 1 here? This woman is wise. I am a
chihl. 1 am a fool. I am lo~t"
Yes, Stephen Langton was wise enough to think thus.
In the calme-t and most commonplace way did Claudia
Branscombe talk to Stephen concerning the news of Idlechester
and Kingsleat. Lightly did she refer to Anne's elopement, quot-
ing the ancient proverb anent marrying in haste and repenting
at leisure, and saying-
" Poor child ! A mere baby, and now Mrs. Morll. I hope the
young man will be kind to her; but his conduct shows that
he is selsh, and selsh men have seldom much kindness."
" Only a brute could be unkind to her," said Stephen.
"Vl'hat, are you in love with her still? You were very for-
tunate to lose her. Your own characterexcuse my frankness-
has not yet much stability, and if you hal married her it would
have been terrible for both. You would have been likewell,
comparisons are odious," she said, laughing. "But I think it
was well for you."
" Possihly," said Stephen. "One is not always perfectly satis-
ed with what everybody else professes to think the bes: thing
that could happen. I had a certain faith and loyalty which
Mrs. Morll's conduct his shattered. I have now to recommence
the world on a new principle."
"Don't you think," asked Claudia, "that you ma be hasty
in condemning the whole of our sex because one litt e girl has
been unfaithlul l "
"Ah, I wish I could tell. Nothing except experience will
enable me to correct an error of that kind. Can you wonder that
I am in a state of utter uncertainty 7 "
" I don't wonder, but I think you would be wise not to come
to hasty conclusions. However, it is an unimportant matter to
every one but yourself."
Raphael Branscombe presently joined them, and dinner was
announced. A good dinner, we may he sure, at an establishment
of which Raphael was the head. From the oysters and anchovy
salad t0 the ice-puddingfrom the dry Sillery to the Chateau
Yquem-everything was perfect. Stephen, whose capacity for
enjoyment was enviahly complete, dived like an emperor.
By and by the Panther retired, and Raphael and Stephen were
left alone. Their conversation was curious. Neither understood
the other. Ranhael regarded Stephen as a mere greenin-rn, a
foolish, inexperienced boy, who could be enticed into any kind
of extravagance or absurdity; whereas Stephen had in him just
so much of the oetic faculty as enabled him to detect what was
false and for; , to shrink from what was ridiculous. Stephen
thought Raphael a marvellous specimen of the human race, for
beauty, for skill, for general clevernessnor ever suspected in

him that astucity which lay at the base of his other qualities.
The game, therefore, which these two were playing, unconsciously,
so faras one of these was concerned, was singular. Each imagined
he knew the other's cards and didn't.
" Do you intend to remain long in London 1 " asked Raphael in
the course of conversation.
" I really have no decided intention," said Stephen. " It seems
to me that for a man without any denite object in life, London
is about the best place to live."
"Well, I don't see why you should have no object in life,"
returned Raphael; " but that, of course, is your affair, only if
you think of remaining in town, you should belong to a club,
and I'll put your name down at the Chandos, if you like."
" I shall be very glad," said Stephen.
"And what are you going to do this evening?"
"This evening !" replied Stephen in some amazement, looking
at his watch. " Why, it is ten o'clock now. I thought of going
back to the Chapter Coffee-house in about an hour."
"Just the time to begin the evening," said Raphael. "How-
ever, nobody can wonder at your inexperience, seein that you
are fresh from an old-world place like Idlechester. ilht if you
don't mind making a night of it, you and I will turn out pre-
sently, after a cup of tea."
" I am at your service," said Stephen.
"And if you mean to remain in town, don't stay at that place
in St. Paul's Churchyard. Let me nd you rooms somewhere in
this part of London."
Stephen assented, Raphael rang the bell, and sent for his valet.
When Louis arrived, his master said
"Find Mr. Langton rooms somewhere between this and St.
James's Church. Let them be comfortable, but not extravagant.
See that the cookery is good. And if you know a fellow who
would do as Mr. Langton's valet, tell me."
" I know precisely the man," said Louis. " His name is
Auguste Lancel. He is ust seeking employment."
"Very well. Let me see him to-morrow. I can judge," he
said to Stephen, "whether! he is t for anything; and if he is,
you can see him."
" I am sorry to give you so much trouble."
" You don't give me any. It amuses me. I am delighted to
be able to help anybody so thoroughly ignorant of the world as
you are."
" That's no great compliment," said Stephen.
"Well, I'd willingly change places with you. You're about
ten years younger than I am; you're good-looking and clever,
and tolerably well off ; you've got the world before you, and are
quite ignorant of both the bright and the dark side of it. You're
an uncommonly lucky fellow. I should like to be in your
position."
## p. 137 (#147) ############################################

" Meanwhile," said Stephen, "1 shall he laughed at for my
ignorance."
"Why not! Those who laugh at you will be people who
overestimate the value of their own knowledge. I think 1 know
the world as well as most men, and I have longhpeen of o inion
that it is not worth knowing. Honestly," said phael, " envy

. They passed to the drawing~room, where the Panther gave
them coffee; gave them also music and song. Have we not
heretofore heard the passionate melod throb through that white
throat of hers? I don't. quite know ow she felt that evening.
For this supercilious boy her kirtle had fallen in vain; he had
refused her, he had itied her. Now, the love which caused him
to refuse and pity er was wholl frustrate. Now, he might
think otherwise. Now, also, the p ot to which, for her father's
sake, she had pledged herself, was frustrate. True, if she married
this boy, there would be money enough to live at ease ; and he
would be a docile husband. But as I am analysing a lady's
thoughts, I must here remark that there arose to disturb her
calculations a vision of a handsome baronet, superbly apparelled,
magnicent in moustache.
Strange to say, Sir Arthur Willesden had made an impression
on Claudia. I really had hoped that my Panther was above
womanish weaknesses not so. You see, she wanted to be
tamed, to be tyrannised over, to be lashed into obedience. The
man to do this came not : she, with wistful eyes desiring a mas-
ter, imagined strength of will and stern resolve in this Sir Arthur
Willesden, simply because he was big and muscular, and looked
as if he could knock down an ox. 'Tis the way with woniankind;
if they cannot nd the right man they endow some utterly wrong
man with the requisite characteristics.
Well, this night Claudia was a'able to Stephen, and sang and
played for him, and chatted pleasantly with him, and expressed
a hope that he would not let Raphael lead him into mischief.
Raphael's practical reply was the production of some remarkably
fine carendish.
"By mischief, my sister means smoke," said Raphael; " but
she doesn't object to it."
She did not, as we know.
" Is that wonderful old grandfather of yours still ourishing 'l"
asked Raphael. "I remember his bringing you to see us one
morning at Kingsleat, heaven knows ow many years ago.
Claudia petted you, and I scolded her afterwards for falling in
love with you."
The Panther looked erce.
"My grandfather is in very good condition," said Stephen,
"though he is growing old like the rest of us. I as~ure you, Mr.
Branscombe, I have often eat difculty in assuring myself
that I am the unfortunate ttle schoolboy whom your sister

petted. Indeed, I am sometimes doubtful as to the reality of
even later events."
" He's not such a fool as he looks," thought the Seraph. '
" He has not forgotten," thought the Panther.
No : he was not a fool, this Stephen Langton ; nor had he for-
gotten. He could not comprehend Raphael B'ranscombe's friendly
interest in him and his affairs ; but he knew there must be some
reason for it, and he waited for time to reveal that reason. And
he had not forgotten even the avour of the peach which the
beautiful Claudia had given him so many years agoor the
touch of her lips when he lay in bed at Kingsleat, and she
and the Bishop's wife curvetted like a cou le of young llies,
unrestrained by his childish presencestil less that moment
when she had thrown herself into his arms, and he had rejected
her. Nothing did he forget; but he could not understand on
what terms they were to meet in future. Were they enemies or
friends, or coldly neutral?
He did not know. Did she?  ~
Stephen made a night of it. It was midnight when Raphael
and he left the Panther to her own devices. 'l'hev went away
to the Chandos Club, where Raphael gave Stephen his rst
lesson in billiards, and introduced him to a very select circle of
leasant fellows, given to bad habits. It was exactly six when
e reached the Chapter Co'ee-house, and went to bed. It was
two in the afternoon when he came down to breakfast the next
day.
Raphael did not resign his oice as uardian and guide. In
a very few days Stephen found himself comfortably established
in rooms in J ermyn Street. with Auguste Lancel in attendance ;
and he very much enjoyed his new style of life. He seemed to
take to it naturally. Dressed by the most fashionable tailors,
Stephen Langton, if he had suddenly appeared in the High Street
of ldlechester, would scarcely have been recognised by Jack Win-
slow or his aunt Harriet. The Panther was quite amazed at his
development.
And not the Panther only. Humphrey Morll, having ar-
ranved all matters of business satisfactorily, came from Wetheral
to ondon with full intent to conquer the world. He had mar-
ried Anne Page, as he intended; why should he not carry out
his other intentions? True, he hadn't as much money with her
as he ex ected; and for this he often, with a want of logic of
which a. amhridge man should have been ashamed, blamed his
unoifending little wife. But a couple of thousand a year was
a good start, and Humphrey was resolved not to lose a single
chance. His ambition was almost a mania. He came to town,
and took a house in Mesopotamia, which Lady Morley christened
Cubitopolis. He entered himself at the Middle 'lemple, and
took to the study of law with avidity. He left his wife a good
deal alone, of necessity. When Stephen knew of their being in

town he called at once, and his unfaithful sweetheart was
astounded to see him so comphte a man of fashion. The Pan-
ther also called, under Raphael.s orders, and found Humphrey,
who chanced to be at home, excessively glad to find anybody who
would occasionally entertain his wife in his absence; and the
result was that, all previous occurrences apparently forgotten, Mr.
and Mrs. Morll, and Mr. and Miss Branscombe, and Mr. Lang-
ton, associated very freely and pleasantly. Raphael, however,
did not call on the Mot-fills for some time after their swim] in
Londm. When he did, and it was over, as Claudia and he Were
walking homeward, the Seraph said-
" What a devilish pretty little thing she is? I wish I had seen
her in time."
Sweet Anne Morll was at the same moment thinking that she
had never seen so fascinating a man as Mr. Raphael Branscombe,
but she did not mention this idea to her husband.
CHAPTER XV.
an. an nus. nonrtnn
HUMPHREY MORFILL and his wife, in Mesopotamia, were
not perhaps as happy as they ought to have been. And
the reason was tolerably clear. Humphrey, to begin with, had
never loved the pretty little infantile creature whom he had mar-
ried. Indeed, it may fairly be stated that he had never loved
any one except himself. His sole object had been to obtain a
wife with money, and in this he had succeeded. Sweet Anne
Page, on the other hand, had lived all her life in a delicious
dream of love ; she was a child still, and did not know what love
meant; but she assuredly ex ected a kind of chivalrous defer-
ence which Humphrey Mortil did not give her. In truth, he
gave her something very different. He was her tyrant. He had
already regretted the position in which he had placed himself.
More than once had he considered it an inexcusable blunder to
have sacriced that ne intellect of his for a couple of thousand
a year. The thing was done, but he could not help behaving to
his bride as if he thought she ought to be ashamed of heiself.
Of course the poor child, who at any rate fancied she loved him,
could not comprehend his horrible baseness.
Still he managed to make her extremely unhappy. He treated
her in a very childish fashion. The method of the marriage had
made him master of the money. and he took the earliest possible
opportunity of showing her that it was so. He soon taught
her to consider herself dependent on him. Gladly would she
K
## p. 140 (#150) ############################################
I40 - SWEET ANNE PAGE,
have been dependent on any creature who showed her the love
for which she craved eternally; but this Humphrey would show
her none. Indeed, he had none to show.
I do not blame this man. There are beingsI suppose I
must say human beingswho do not know the meaning of love
the utmost to which the can rise is affection. The passionate
love wherewith a man (w o is a man) can love a wife, or a sister,
or a son, or a daughter, is to them unintelligible So much the
better for them, perhaps; who knows? Never is there great
love without great grief. I fancy Humphrey Morll belonged to
this classto this pitiable or enviable class, I know not which.
At any rate, he was a man capable of being extremely ati'ec-
tionate, and uite incapable of loving. Ah me, that terrible
incapacity! on who have loved, and have through your love
been compelled to endure grief unutterable, torture such as
would have maddened Prometheus-
" The vulture at his Vitals, and the links
Of the lame Lemnian festering in his esh "
take my word for it that this is innitely better than not to have
tasted
" The cruel madness of love,
The honey of poison owers, and all the measureless ill."
And you a'ectabmta men and womenif indeed there be any
affectionate womenGod help ye all ! Why were ye not cows 1
ruminating animals? chewers of the end 1
Little Anne would, I think, have been happy enough with
even an aectionate husband, if only her husband had not been
tyrannical. But Humphrey was a tyrant of the coolest order.
He were no glove over the steel gauntlet. He was her master,
and took every opportunity of letting her know it. So Anne
was wretched enough; and you cannot be surprised if she was
extremel glad to see anybody who was not her husband, espe-
cially as er husband spent long matutine hours at the Temple,
with an eye to the Solicitor-Geueralshipet cetera.
So she welcomed Claudia, whom in her babyhood she had
feared. She had learned that a petticoated tyrant with a riding-
whip is more endurable than the tyrannic husband whose frown
is torture. As to the Panther, it must be confessed that her rst
visit to the Mesopotamian terrace was not satisfactory. She felt
that she had been rather severe to her little friend. She thought
the best way of dealing with the matter was to laugh it off ath
gether. She managed pretty well, but there was a little prelimi-
nary shyness. It is not everybody who has the coolness of the
Emu boy who happened to dine with Keate on a long-standin
invitation on the ver day when that best of head. masters had
had to administer a ogging.

MR. AND MRS. MORFILL. I4!
"I have not seen you for a long time," said the Doctor.
" Not this side of me, sir," responded his promising alum-
nus.
But Anne, who had quite forgiven the Panther her triing
tyrannies, was delighted to nd any one who would comfort her.
Poor child ! she wanted comfort. Naturally dull, the dreadful
fact that Humphrey had married her merely as a matter of con-
venience had not yet occurred to her. Naturally obedient, she
had not thought of rebelling against the routine to which he had
condemned her. And here, I regret to say, Claudia was her ac-
complicenay, her prOmpterin naughtiuess. Claudia told her
that, as the actual owner of the property on which her penniless
husband lived, she ought to have plenty of enjoyment. Thereby
Claudia gave a considerable amount of trouble to Mr. Humphrey
Morll, who spent a great deal of his time in proving to his wife
that it was necessary to avoid extravagance. A little pleasure,
pleasantly given, would have satised her. She was not exorbi-
tant in her demands. If he had loved her, he could have sup-
plied what she needed with innite ease. But love teaches lessons
not to be learnt elsewhere.
Stephen was too proud not to visit her. Between them there
was no explanation. Indeed, Stephen would not have listened
to a word. He had made up his mind that love was a swindle,
a sell. He had come to consider religion cant, and morality a
myth. It is a mental and moral disease this, to which young
men of any brain are subject, and which they take with special
readiness, if they happen to encounter a disa pointment. They
argue from the articular to the universal in elicious deance of
Aldrich. My riend Stephen, having been 'ilted by a plump
child of the most infantile character, came to t e terribly tragical
conclusion that all women were false. He had never known a
woman. But if ever he had been right in arguing from sweet
Anne Page to every creature that wears petticoats, would that
have justied him in denying the inspiration of the New Testa-
ment? I am inclined to think not.
Raphael Branscombe saw a good deal of Mrs. Morll. As
Humphrey spent his mornings at the Temple, Anne, weary of her
loneliness, took refuge with her friend the Panther. The Seraph,
discovering this, and having a constitutional tendency to amuse
himself, was wont to lounge into his sister's apartments, and talk
to Anne. Claudia, we know, had plenty of morning visitors, so
Raphael had ample time to irt with this innocent child. And
he did it. And it looked very much as if she liked it. One
evening, as he was smoking alone in his sanctum, Claudia made
her way thither. It showed the Panther's daring. Raphael had
strictly prohibited all invasion there. But Claudia, at about
midnight, majestic in a rustling purple silk, entered the room in
which the Seraph sat. It almost surprised him; I cannot say
more.
## p. 142 (#152) ############################################
I42 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
But he merely removed from his lips the amber mouthpiece
of a hookah from which he had been drawing cool draughts of
fragrant smoke, and said
"Well?"
The Panther was not easily shut up. She settled herself tidily
and gracefully in an easy chair, and said very deliberately
" I want to speak to you, Raphael !"
" Talk away, child," he replied.
"What is there between you and Anne Page?" she asked
perem torily.
"A usbnnd, my dear," he said. "At least, if by Anne Page
you mean your nice little friend, Mrs. Morll."
"Ra hael," she said with eager earnestness, " I implore you tc
leave 1 em alone. Poor little Anne! She has married a man
who does not love her, and she has not learnt the meaning of love
herself. Don't be cruel to them, Raphael. I know how danger-
ous you are. They have done you no harm."
The Seraph rose from his seat, dropping the mouthpiece of his
hookah and stood with his back to the fire. He seemed to deli-
berate for a minute or two. Then he spoke.
"Claudia, I thought better of you. They have done me no
harm! They have sim ly deprived me of a pleasant and ample
income which I could have commanded. If I had seen Anne
Page ten minutes before she ran away with this young fellow, do
you think she would have gone? She's a mere child; a man
need not be proud of winning her; she would have said yes to
any man."
"Then why be vexed about it?" said the Panther. "She is
not t to be your Wife. And there are plenty of girls with twice
the money who would be glad to marry you. Why not leave
her alone 'l "
"Are you a Branscombe, Claudia?" asked Raphael. "What,
do you think I care for the silly child and her two thousand a
ear? Not but what, pretty as she is. I might have married her
ad I seen her in timebut I care no more about it than I care
what l shall have for dinner to-morrow."
"Then," said Claudia. after a pause. "why do you waste so
much time upon her? Why do you make her like you 7"
Igaphael gave utterance to a sardonic laugh, but made no
rep v.
" Tell me," said the Panther.
" Tell you what, child 1"
"Whv you irt with that poor little Anne Morll till she
wishes her husband was hanged."
"' My dear Claudia. I shall continue to think you are a Brans-
combe, even against the strong evidence to the contrary you have
'ust given. But you are a strange girl, and I think you had
etter go to bed."
" What do you mean 7"

" Simply that you are losing that piquant perspicacity which
used to distinguish you. Here you are asking me why I irt
with your little bride 7 Have you ever asked a out why he chases
mice ; or, if that simile is not poetic enough for your taste, can
you tell me why a falcon kills smaller birds? If you desire to
remonstrate, Claudia. by all means lecture your lrirolous ippant
little friend. Cry IVare hawk. Give her the very best advice,
moral, religious, social. I hope it will do her good."
" 1 can't think what you see in her," said the Panther medi-
tatingly.
" Dear me, can't you? Why, a plump morsel of esh and blood
and loveliness-that's all; and that's enough to tempt any man
to delicious morsinnculae. She's not a marVel of the jungle, like
youa terror to mild mena creature to be tamed with a wrist
of steel and a lash of wire. No ; she's all love and melting sweet-
ness, like a candied conserve of the East."
" Well, I shall warn her," said Claudia.
" Do, and discharge your conscience. If you warn her against
me, and make her afraid of me, you will increase my amusement,
and I doubt whether you will decrease her danger. That is an
affair entirely for your consideration. Meanwhile, my dear
Claudia, permit me to say that I warn you."
" Oh, you're not going to frighten me," said the Panther,
frightened all the while.
" You mistake me. I do not wish to warn you against advis-
ing your friend. I wish you in that to do exactly what you
deem wisest. But I warn you against too intimate a irtation
with that blockhead Willesden."
" What do you mean 1" she exclaimed indignantly.
"Be calmthat's a good girl. I have not the least fear that
vou will do anything silly. The men of our family have always
een sans pour, and the women sans 'rcprrwhe-an excellent way
of dividing the old motto. But \l'illesilen can't marry, you

prudent; I don't see what there is to admire in such a large
awkward mass of jewellery and Eau-de-Cologuebut that's your
affair."
" Well. good night, Raphael," said Claudia ; " I shall warn her."
And she did. She got her into her bedroom at her next visit,
and told her it was very wrong to irt so much with Raphael.
Anne became mntinons.
" Flirt 2" she said " What do you mean by irting? I merely
talk to Mr. Branscombe, and not half as much as you do to Sir
Arthur Willesden. You seem to forget that I am a married
woman now."
"Mr. Morll wouldn't like it," said the Panther, amused at
her little friend's assumption of dignity.

" Then Mr. Morll should not leave me alone all da , without
any amusement, and come home to his dinner as stupi and cross
as he can be. He is living on my money, and he ought to know
better."
The meekest little women in the world get a spirit in them
when conscious of possessing money.
" I mean to do just as I like, Claudia," she continued. " Mr.
Branscombe is very pleasant to talk to, and he won't eat me, I
suppose, though he is your brother ; and I really think you had
better attend to your own affairs."
Claudia was both amused and amazed at her friend's rebellious
spirit. Being a wife, the young lady considered herself in a
rank above all unmarried women: she thought it impertinent
of Claudia to venture to lecture her. Marriage had conferred a
funny kind of dignity upon her; so the Panther's lecture had no
effect, save perhaps to increase Anne's interest in her intercourse
with Raphael, b reason of its appearing perilous.
As to Ra hae when Claudia eft him on the evening of her
lecture, he ell to soliloquy.
"I rather like the little girl," he said to himself. "She's a
dainty pet. Emilia is a ne woman, no doubt; and Fiordilisa
is a girl out of Shakespeare, as poetic as she is beautiful ; and, by
Jove ! I wish I was back with her in Isola Rossa. But this little
Morll is such a lump of sweetness; she'd melt in a fellow's
mouth like a ripe greengage ; and then that villain Morll stole
herstole her from me, too, the unprincipled reprobate. 'Twould
be a ne thing to revenge myself upon him by carrying o' his
wife."
So Claudia's remonstrance rather increased her brother's
tendency to irt with Mrs. Mortill. And, a few davs later,
he made a movement in advance. The scene was laudia's
drawing-room ; the Panther was singing divinely for Sir Ar-
thur's delectation; Raphael was talking in low tones to
Anne.
" How delightfully your sister sings !" she had said.
"Not half so delightfully as you talk. I could listen to your
pretty prattle for ever."
" You speak as if I was a child," she said.
"So you are, and a very charming child, too. Why, you are
not ashamed of being young, surely?"
" If I am old enough to be married, I ought not to be treated
like a child," she replied with petty fretfulness.
"I never said you were old enough to be married. But never
mind : I'll treat you with the greatest respect in futurejust as
if you were fty.'
" Oh no ! Don't do that."
"I shall see you to-morrow morning, I supp0se. Claudia is
going to be out all day. By the way, can one ever nd Mr. Mob
ll at home i "

"Very seldom; he generally goes to the Temple the moment
breakfast is over."
"And you are all nlone'l Well, I think I shall call to-morrow
morning, and see if I can nd him."
"I don't think it will be any use," said Anne, " unless I tell
him to wait at home for you."
" Don't on any account interfere with his business for me."
And she did not. By some curious caprice, Humphrey lounged
longer over his breakfast than usual that next morning. He
found something in the neirspaper to interest him. Anne
thought he was never going. But he went at last, after 'ving
orders about the dinner two or three times over. He li ed a
good dinner after his worknot what Raphael would have called
a good dinner, but something full avoured and substantial.
None of your delicate entre'cs and curious wines for Mr. Morll:
leg of mutton, sirloin, steak, Reid's stout, Carbonell's fruitiest
portthese were his favourite eatables and drinkablea. He was
not rened. He liked onions.
In the course of the morning Raphael appeared, regretted that
Mr. Morlill was not at home, and sat down for a chat with Mrs.
Morll. She was looking very nice. There was a rosy ush,
and childish freshness, about her; a deal of pink in her print
dress, of coral and cream in her complexion, of loving innocence
in her soft glance. Raphael thought her the prettiest specimen
of babyish beauty he had ever seen.
" I should like to put you under a glass case, Mrs. Morll," he
said, " and keep you in my own room to look at."
" Make me a prisoner, as Humphrey does. I'm sure I wish he
was anything but a lawyer ; he slaves at it night and day, and I
get no pleasure at all."
" What would you like '1 You ought to be playing Les Graces
with a dozen other little girls upon a green lawn under shady
trees."
"That's the way with you all," she said, with a provoking
pout. "You talk to me as if I was a baby. Hum hrey
always does. And Claudia used to at Kingsleat ; but I'm getter
offlthan she is; I am married, at least, and I don't think she ever
wi 1 be."
"Don't you sometimes wish yourself unmarried?" said the
Sera h, laughing.
" ndeed I do, every dav of in life. What induced me to
marry Humphrey I can't think. should have been better off
with Stephen."
"You should have waited for me."
" Oh, you're too old. And you think me a mere baby, I know."
"I think you the most beautiful creature I ever saw in In
life," he said seriously. " And as I have said before, your youth
is only too valuable a possession. We all get old fast enough.
But you will always be young, I believe."

"You are laughing at me, Mr. Bransconibe. You think I am
not 't to be anybody's wifeonly t for a hoop or a skipping-
ro .'
261 wish you were my wife," he said. "I wish I had seen you
in time."
" You vain being! So you reallyhave conceit enough to fancy
that I should have liked you better than Humphrey "I"
She sprung from her seat, and danced round the room, laughing
and clapping her hands.
" I am sure you would," he said. " More than that, I am sure
you like me better now."
" Go awa ! go away! You are getting naughty. I shall ring
the bell an order ' Mr. Branscombe's carriage.' "
'1; Don't you think you could be serious for a minute?" he
sai . 1
" No, not half a minutenot a second."
She had taken a long scarf, and was vainly trying to use it as a
skipping-rope.
"liow, do sit down, just for a moment. I want to talk to
ou.'
" But I don't in the least want to talk to you. I think I shall
send out and buy a skipping-rope. I wonder what the dignied
Mr. Morll will say when he comes home to dinner if he nds
me skipping in the Square."
Raphael rose from his seat, and tried to catch her arm ; she ran
away. He followed her. In a moment the chase had become
exciting. The room was large, with much heavy furniture in
it, in the regular Mesopotamian style; so there were plenty of
opportunities for dodging. But the young lady's foot caught in
a rug ; she almost fell ; and before she could recover herself
Raphael had overtaken her.
She was an infant in his grasp. He coolly took her hands in
one of his, and returned to his chair, and made her sit upon his
knee.
"Now, young lady," he said, " you are my prisoner, and I can
punish you for all the trouble you have given me."
" Oh! let me go, let me go, please. If Humphrey were to come !
l'll scream, Mr. Branscombe, I will, positively."
" No, you won't. Come, I want a quiet talk, so sit still and let
us have it."
" Let me go to my own seat, then."
" And run away again ? Not exactly. No, you'll stay where
you are. Come, let me at your hair back out of your eyes."
Her abundant hair has fallen over her brow amid their romp.
He smoothed it gently back. Then he kissed her forehead, bring-
ing up a blush to brighten all her beautiful young face.
"0 Mr. Branscombe, you are very, very wicked ! Let me go,
do please let me "o l "
" No, child. I want to ask you a question. Look at me

" Very well, I promise. Do you think," he asked slowly and
deliberately, " that if you had met me in time, you could have
lov--d me? '
Anne's iu'ight young beauty was reddened this time by a more
vivid blush. Her long eyelashes drooped to veil her eyes. She
did not speak.
"Answer !" he said in a passionate whisper.
She said not a word.
"Answer!" again he said. pressing her close to his breast so
closely that it was almost pain.
For sole reply she hid her face on his shoulder, and burst into
a passion of tears.
"O my darling !" he exclaimed. "My poor little at! My
sweet low !" And all the while he rained kisses on ier brow,
her eyelids, her lips. And all the while she clung to him,
quivering with ecstasy. She did not want to escape now. She
lay in his arms like a bird in its nest.
"Kiss me!" he exclaimed, in the imperious tones of passion.
"Kiss me ! Speak to me ! Call me by my name 1"
She kissed him with clinging kisses, honey-sweet, fragrant as
the jasmine's breath. And she looked at him with bright, loving
learless eyes. from which all tears had pamd. And she said, in
a low voice like the coo of the doves that haunted her father's
lilechester garden
"I love you, Raphael."
CHAPTER XVI.
ISOLA CHESTER.
STEPHEN found that he was spending a good deal of money.
It was expensive to be patronised by Raphael. Not that
the Seraph deigncd to borrow money of his friends, though quite
willing 10 win money of them at anv game they might c1100se to
play. Debt with him was a ne art, and he had the rare capa-
city, however great might be his difculties, of always providing
himself with ready money. How he did this I don't pretend to
say. He was, however, an extravagant man to associate with;
he denied himself no luxury ; he rode the best horses, drank the
best wines, dressed in the best style. Stephen imitated him in
all this. He was by no means satised with himself. But the
shook of Anne Page's elopement had completely upset him; he

lived a. false factitious life; he sought pleasure, careless what it
cost.
One day they were talking of Mrs. lforfill. Stephen had called
in Clar es Street ; had entered for a brief visit Claudia's saloon,
where 'e encountered his lost love, and then he and Raphael
strolled into Piccadilly.
"That little girl who jilted you was looking particularly nice
this morning, old fellow," said the Seraph.
She was; only a few days had passed since the scene of my
last chapter, and in Raphael's presence she looked the very
essence, the consummate ower, of beauty.
"Don't talk about her," said Stephen, "she is as heartless as
she is prettya cruel coquette from the cradle."
' "An abominable little irt, certainly," replied the Seraph.
" I pity Morll."
" Why pity him? The fellow never cared about her. He got
her money, which was all he wanted."
" Only half of it, my boy," laughed Raphael. "You got the
rest, I'm glad to say, and are spending it like a prince. But
come" into Hatchett's, and have a glass of sherry. I've got an
idea.
" You have no special affection for the young lady," said the
Seraph, as they sat overlooking
" Piccadilly~shops, palaces, hustle, and breeze,
The whirring of wheels and the murmur of trees."
" I despise her utterl ," he replied with emphasis.
" And your friend, 3 orll l "
" Him I both despise and hate. He has taught me to disbelieve
in both love and friendship."
"What, my friendship ! " said the Seraph. "That's too bad.
Well, shall I teach on to believe in revenge l"
" It is useless. can't horsewhip the fellow, or shoot him,
because she preferred him to me."
"There is another mode of revenge," said the Seraph deli-
berately, leaning back in his chair, and sipping his sherry
"through her. Upon my word, I feel very like )Iephistopheles
talking to Faust. You're a philosophic fellow, Langtondo you
think that though I look like a human being, I may he a demon
without knowing it? They called my father Devil Branscombe,
you know. I think there is something endish in my blood."
Stephen felt dis osed to think likewise. We know his dreamy
fantastic nature. e began to speculate whether this marvellous
friend of his. so handsome, so daring, so cooll wicked, so regard-
less who suffered while he enjoyed himself, ad not a touch of
Asmodeus or Mephisto in him. And Claudiawas she a fiend ?
Was that scene of passion, which he could never forget, 21 dia-
bolical temptation 'i

"You're off at a tangent," said Raphael. "Leave metaphysics
till you smoke your midnight cigar, and tell me if you would like
to see Morfill punished through her."
" I should ; they both deserve it."
"Then it shall be done. You. hate Morll. Idon't ; he's not
worth hating. But he foiled me, and I'll punish him for it. I
intended to marry Anne, in which case you'd have hated and
despised me, I guess."
" You were not my friend," he replied sadly.
" That's true. Well, if you agree to assist me, the thing shall
be done. It's two o'clock; I shall want another accomplice; we'll
call on Miss Che=tershe'll be at breakfast."
"Who is Miss Chester 1"
"You'll see, my friend. You have not yet learnt everything
worth knowing in London. We have not far to walk. Mind,
you are under my orders."
They left the hotel, and turned northwards till they came to a
very quiet street indeed. It seemed to lead nowhere in parti-
cular. Even now the erce trafc of London has not invaded it.
It was tranquil and respectable. And at the dark green door of
a very elegant little house Raphael knocked. The tidiest of bright-
eyed maid-servants opened to them, and recognising Raphael with
a smile, showed them at once into Miss Chester's breakfast-room.
She bad "hair like sea-moss," this girl who lay loosely appa-
relled in the easiest of chairscurious coloured hair, whose hue
depended on the light in which you saw it. And her eyelashes
were very dark and long, and her eyes were a strange giinting
green, and her month, not very smell, was exquisitely expressive.
But her long white throat, and the curve from her shell-like ear,
were unusual in their beauty, and her white hands had the same
slender sinuous length and grace. and so, indeed, had every art
of her form. And in her expression there was a strange bleu ing
of laziness with sauciness. Such was Isola Chester.
" Ah ! Seraph ! how do? Brought any good news? Friend of
yours 't "
"Yes ; and a very good fellow. I want you to like him."
"That's easy. He looks only half baked. What's his name 'l "
" Langton, my pet. Now, don't chaff him, but let's have a
talk. Why don't you eat your breakfast 'I "
"I can't~ I'm seedy, and don't feel well by any means."
" I wish you'd talk English, Isola. I can't understand half you
say, and as to Langton, you might as well talk Hebrew to him.
And now, Miss Chester, perhaps you'll kindly give -me your
attention."
"All serene," she said.
"My friend Langton \vu'lts you to dine with him at Greenwich
to-morrow. Will you go 'I "
"Like a bird," she answered ; "but why doesn't he make it to-
day? I've nothing to do."

"That's his affairand mine. Perhaps he'll take you some-
where, else to-day, if he's disengaged. But you mustn't talk
slang.'
" No, I Won't," she said. " I'll talk as tall as you please.
It's a beautiful daysend for horses, and let us ride some-
where."
"I don't mind that," said the Seraph. "Put on your habit.
We'll go round to the stables, and see what we can get."
1 " I don't understand your plan," said Stephen, as they walked
a ong.
" You will, to-morrow. We'll ride down to Richmond to-day,
and give her some dinner at the Star. and to-niorrow you must
be at the Shi at Greenwich with her at ve o'clock. I'll manage
everything e se."
"But why not explain your scheme 1 "
" Because I like mystery, and because I may have to vary it.
It won't hurt you, I suppose, to eat your sh in the company of
a pretty girl."
" She is singularly pretty," said Stephen. " I never saw any-
body like her. But I wish she would talk intelligibly."
" I'll make her. She can talk as good English as you or I, or
Mrs. Morll."
, Isola Chester looked charming on horseback. She had a grace-
ful seat, and a delicate hand,and the prettiest gure in the world.
It was a tine breezy spring day, and the ride to Richmond was
delightful, nor less so the dinner. Miss Chester condescended
to talk her purest English, and Stephen got on very well with
her.
" You must See Isola home," said Raphael as they rode back to
town. " I've an engagement this evening connected with our
little plot. You will he punctual at Greenwich to-morrow 'l "
" To the minute," said Ste hen gaily, for the iced champagne
and Isola's etl'erVescent chit-c at had aroused him from his cus-
tomary gloom.
" I hope it will be as jolly a dinner as to-day's."
" No fear," replied the Seraph, and turned his horse's head in
another direction. Stephen and his companion broke into a.
canter, and soon reached Miss Chester's residence.
"Come in and smoke a cigar," she said, as he lifted her from
her horse. " It's early."
Having given him what she declared to be "a capital weed,"
and installed him in an easy-chair by the re, she went o' to get
rid of her habit, and soon returned in the loosest of luxurious
wra pers, of some soft and delicate material, made so as to reveal
the beauties which it seemed to conceal. She looked at Stephen,
who was gazing dreamin at the re.
" What are you thinking about, Curls 7" she asked. It was a.
custom of Miss Chester's to confer nicknames on her acquaint-
ances, and Stephen's curly hair had already suggested one for him.

" I was thinking of Branscomhe," he answered.
"Ah I now, it you can explain that mysterious Sera h to me,
I'll thank you. What does this dinner at Greenwic inennl
You're not spoons upon me. 1 know, so it can't be for my 5 the."
" What do you mean by spoons 'l" inquired Stephen, laughing.
" Oh, you verdant child ! Why, you're not in love with me.
You're a ways thinking about somehody else. Shall I tell you
your fortune? I've got a pack of cards here."
And with the words she began to spread-the cards upon the
table, and to utter certain preilit-tions. Suddenly she stooped.
" Oh 1 I can't tell you," she said. " There's murder and mad-
ness, and all sorts of dieailful thin . ; and you won't marry the
lady you lore, nor yet the lady that lzdves youyou'll marry"
"I shall never marry at all," interrupted Stephen. "Put
away that nonsense. Tell me how long you have known Raphael
Branscomhe i"
"What! hasn't he told you? Well, I don't know why he
should, either. Do you like him l"
"You ask me questions ln:IE:l(l of answering mine," said
Stephen. "Yes, I like him. \Ye are great friends. But he
puzzles me."
" I should rather think he did," said the pretty Isola, stretch-
ing her arms lazily above her head. so that the loose sleeves fell
back to reveal their round whiteness. " He puzzles everybody.
He's what the Scotch call not canny. I don't like being alone
- with him. I'm always expecting he'll disappear with a strong
smell oi briinstone."
" How long have you known him?" asked Stephen again.
" How old do you think I am I"
" Eighteen. perhaps."
"Sixteen. Mr. Langton; not a day more. I've got the certi-
cate of my birth; it's almost the only thing my mother left me.
And the Seraph has known me just ten years. He bought me
when I was six."
" Bought you 1"
" Yes, bought me. My mother was a tramp, and she fell down
and died on the great Bath road, at the comer of Maidenhead
Thicket. I've seen the place often since. There's a little inn close
by. Mr. Branscomhe was driving pust' and he pulled up to ask
What was the matter. for I was like a. little mad thing. "'ell' they

young fellow in the neighbourhoodhis name was Pringle
was spoons upon me. I didn't care twopence about him; but
the fun of it was, he pretended to make love to Charlotte Newton,
one of the governesses. You see, I had to be there all the holi-
days, and the Miss Mellishes, who kept the school, used to go
away for a trip; so Miss Newton, who was their niece, had to
take care of me. And we took long walks together, and young
Pringle joined us, and he was cunning enough to make her think
he admired her immensely, and every time he used to slip a
little note into my hand, which, of course, I answered. Poor
Miss Charlotte ! she uite thought he'd marry her, and he was a
gentleman farmer wit a good deal of money. She was a large
fat girl, and tremendously 1plrlrlilud of her lum shoulders, and
she used to go out to meet ' in a very ow ess, with just a
scarf thrown over it, which she could drop to her waist, just to
exhibit those shoulders of hers. Oh, I never shall forget poor
Charlotte Newton's shoulders !" 
And Miss Chester laughed melodiously.
"Well, at last, Fred Pringle proposed that we should amputate
our mahogany "
" What 'I" asked Stephen.
"Oh, I forgot your ignorance. Why, that we should cut-go
away together. And he xed a lonely art of the thicket, where
he said a carriage should be waiting. e wrote this to me, you
know, having told Charlotte that we were to meet him there
next day. They had got on very fast, and used to kiss one
another, and what I principally thought of was the spree of
seeing Charlotte in a rage when she knew that he wanted
me and not her. You see, I'm a remarkably nice party,
Curls."
"Very nice," said Stephen" to look at."
" Ha, ha! One to you, sir! Well, we walked to this lace,
and Fred met us, and a carriage and pair was waiting. And you
may imagine Charlotte's fury when he told her that he and I
were going in it, and that she might go back alone. She rushed
at me, and called me all the names she could think of, and tore
off my bonnet, and boxed my ears so that I felt it for a week
after. But Fred got her away, and he and the driver tied her to
a treeit was a horse-chestnut, I rememberso that she shouldn't
run away and give an alarm. Didn't she bite and scratch, that's
all? She was as strong as a donkey, Fred said. I shall never
forget it."
Again the fair Isola indulged in a tinkling burst of silvery
laughter.
" So then you ran away with Mr. Pringle'l" said Stephen.
"Yes, Curls, I did; stu id little fool that I was. But before
I started, I 'ust thought 'd ay Miss Charlotte out for boxing
my or litt e ears. So I pu led the scarf away from her great
fat oulders, and got a bunch of nettles, and made her tingle a

little, I promise you. What an object she must have looked
wln-n they found her !"
Again the wicked musical laughter.
" ltother cruel, don't you think 7" said Stephen.
"I don't know. I didn't hurt her as much as she hurt me, I
expect. Nettles only sting a little. Let's have some sup er."
t was one o'clocka verv excellent supper hour. lso a rang
the bell, and a charming ittle supper was served. But why
chronicle suppers, even if one's hero enjovs them? And is
Stephen Langton my hero? \Vell, if he is,l am not bound to
follow him at all hours, or to ask whether he was not rather in a
maze when he said good-bye after supper to his mysterious and
very unconventional acquaintance.
Stephen drove Isola to Greenwich next day. He had had a
brief interview with Raphael previously. The pretty creature
looked desperately fascinating. It would be hard to chronicle
the ever-changing colours of her eyes. And he took her to a
pleasant room looking out upon the Thames, where a table was
aid for four.
Raphael,when he left his companions on the previous evening,
had gone straight to a certain Meso otamian terrace, where dvvelt
a young wife whom he held in t e hollow of his hand. For
Humphrey Morll had gone out of town for two days, and sweet
Anne Page was alone.
The ambitious husband, eagerly pursuing alight that could
yield him vantage, thought little of his pretty, lonely, desolate
wife. Somebody else thought of her, though.
Yes, Raphael, reckless of consequences, came in upon her late
that evening, and told her she was to dine at Greenwich with
him next day.
She was just in the state to do anything with him or for him.
She was subjugated, magnetised. And on the following day she
met him by appointment at the Pantheon, and he took her down
to the Ship on the box-seat of a drag, behind four horses. As
they pelted along past China Hall, he said
" on will meet an old friend at dinner, my pet."
"tho?" she asked, with some alarm.
" Oh, a very good old friend, you ungrammatical child. But
- daresay you have forgotten him. You'll forget me in a week
or two."
" You know I can never forget you for a moment, Raphael,"
she said reproachfully.
"Charming child! Well, you'll enjoy your dinner, and the
society theteat. I wish that infernal fellow, Morll, hadn't run
away with you." 
He gave the off-leader a vicious touch of the lash under the
ear, with a wish that it was Humphrey he was hitting. His
com anion only sighed.

154 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
There they found Stephen and Miss Chester waiting for them,
and for dinner. It was a queer meeting.
"Mrs. )Iorlllliss Chester," said the Seraph, introducing
the two It dies. " You'll like one another. Langton, you don't
need any introduction here, I know."
"Not the slightest," he replied, and walking over to his old
sweetheart, gaVe her a kiss before she knew what she was about.
" Come, Curls." exclaimed lsola, " that won't do."
"Oh, We're old friends," said Stephen. "Mrs. )lorll was en-
gaged to be married to me, but liked somebody else better."
Poor little Anne could not unders'and all this; she kept as
close to Raphael as po<sible. Very soon dinner was served, and
a nescient observer might have said it was a perfect party of
four. Raphael, the very ideal of a handsome end, sat opposite
Stephen, the very ideal of a poetic young Englishman; while
Anne Mortill, the simplest and most innocent-looking creature
that ever got beyond the doors of a nursery, faced Isola Chester,
the fascinaiing Bohemian, a wild young "tramp" dressed in lady-
like perfection. Ay, it was a queer party.
Whitebait! Brown bread and butter! Hock in green glasses !
Sweet little lasses! Who has not had this effei-Vescent experi-
ence'l But this resent affair was rendered more piqnant by
circumstances. ere was sweet Anne Page dining between her

dreaming; and now and then piinhing himself to ascenain
wherher he was awake or asleep. Here was the Sera h, amused
as Mephistopheles, having, I verily believe, brought t ese people
together just for the sake of seeing how they behaved. At any
rate, if he thought to humiliate Anne he was mistaken. He for-
got her infantile ignorance of the world ; he forgot her love for
him, which made everything right that happened in his presence.
She was in Elysium; Isola was in Greenwich, dinian at the Ship;
Stephen was in N ephelococcygia, and 1 really don't know where
the Seraph was.
" What do you think of this, Baby Morll '1"
She had found an ap osite sobriquet for Anne at once.
" It, is very nice," replied Anne. " But I don't care much about
wine.'
" Dear child, it prefers pap," said Isola. "I never saw such a
ullet. Why, Seraph, what do you mean by bringing your baby
ere without her pyjamas."
" Don't be im udent, Isola," said Raphael.
"Don't you. l didn't come here to he sat upon. Wake up, old
slow-coach, there ; he's as grave as an earwig, and looks as dazed
as if he saw a ghost."
"Quiet, my child," said the Seraph in his own style.

" It appears to me," said Stephen at this point, " that you are
coolly monopolising the conversation. Now, look here, Brans-

"I say, Seraph," said lsola, "the short hours are getting long
again. Let's go home."
This proposition was accepted. Raphael put his three com-
panions inside the drag, leavin" Stephen's trap to its fate. He
rlropt Stephen and Isola at the tlatter's residence. He took Mrs.
Mgr-ll to Mesopotamia, and then he drove home, as sober as a

his friend, which was several days after the dinner at
Greenwich, " I don't see \\ hat goodor rather what harmyou

" And I'm sure I don't," said Raphael. "But I suppose you'll
admit that it was a very amusing scene. Isola was in her element,
and wasn't Baby Mortiil mystified'l"
"Oh, it was amusing enough. I enjoyed it. I should like a.
similar divertisrment about once a week. But you know you
talked gran-lly about revenge, and all that sort of thing. And
when I saw you had brought Mrs. Morll down With you, I
thought you really meant something."
" My dear Lahgton, I thought exactly the same ; but one can-
not always control circuniszances. l fancied I had a ne com-
bination ; at tne last moment it eluded me. Still, as I said, we

can at any moment now develop a row with Morll."
"How so?"
"Simply enough. By some amazing chance, he does not seem
to have heard of his wife's late hours in his ahsence. But
nothing is ea~ier than to make him aware of them; and then,
as your little friend Isola would say, there'll be the devil to

managed to mistake you for me. But that wouldn't do; he
might shoot you."
" So he might you," said Stephen.
" Might he '3 " returned the Seraph,laughing. " Egad, I'll give
him leave when he likes."
" Well, what do you mean to do now?"
" I mean to wait a little. Are you in a hurry for your revenge,
old fellow 'l "
" I should like to see him properly punished, I confess," said
Stephen.
"Exactly. Well, I'm in no immediate hurry. You see Baby
would be thrown on my hands, and I don't know that I want
her. If she brought her two thousand a year with her it would
be another a'air. If I were in love with the child, or if, like
you, I had been, it would alter the case. As it is, I'm getting on
easily enough in London, and am in no haste to do something
which might oblig'e me to go to Paris or Rome."
And he thought of Venice and Isola Rossaof Lady Emilia
Hudson, whom he had met a day or two beforeof his wife,
Fiordilisa, whom he might never see again. Ah, how fared the
Lily of Isola Rossa'l
" Flower of May !
Who wooed thee and won thee, is far, far away."
"I don't want to inconvenience you," said Stephen. "I was
only led to speak by your own roposal. You, of course, can't
feel as I do. You onl cared for or money. I loved her years
ago, and love her stil . If I had your ower over her I'd take
her away with me, and keep out of Mor l's way till he was tired
of seeking her, and then come suddenly forward, and meet him,
and kill him, and then abandon her to her fate."
" Ah," said the Sera h, "that's ne melodramatic revenge,
suitable to the Surre si e. I wonder whether one could manage
to make Morll thin she was gone away with you 'I That would
be ne. You could take her, acting for me, and I could stay
at home and give Morll excellent advice, and put him off the
scent ; and then at last we could let him nd us, all three toge-
ther, and so situated that he wouldn't know which of us he ought
to ght, you or me. By Jove, Langton, that's not so bad a notion.
Will it suit you i "
"My dear fellow, I don't care what I do. There's no amuse-
ment for me in London. I'll do anything you tell me if we can
punish Morll. I'm tired of this monotonous business."
" Isola has not fascinated you, then 1" said the Seraph.
" I verily think she would, if any woman could. She is a
marvellous creature."
"A witch, sir," said the Seraph. "The Witch of Atlas, that
did naughty tricks to oblige my friend, Percy Bysshe. She

puzzles me sometimes, that Isola, almost as much as I puzzle her
or you."
" She told me where you rst encountered her."
" It was a curious business."
That afternoon Stephen isolated himself from his acquaint-
ances, and took three grains of opiuma habit his reading
had taught him. He ate opium when his brain wanted to be
either calmed or stimulated. The magical drug will tranquillise
the restless, and will arouse the somnolent Raphael had left
him with a promise to let him know what he proposed to do in
reference to Morll. And Stephen, whom recent excitement
hltlld upsettled, resorted to opium in order to obtain quietude of
t on t.
Fogr a strange fantasy had seized him. His intercourse with
the Sern h had become intimate to the extreme. Sometimes it
appeare to him that the Seraph and he exchanged soulsthat
his bod y was inhabited by Ra hael's spiritdaring, remorseless,
devilishly cool. So strongly ad this idea seized him, that he
would consult a mirror to see whether it reected his own or
Raphael's presentment. Sometimes he fancied that it was he
who had bought Isola Chester on Maidenhead Thickethe who
had for sister that wondrous Panther. And then suddenly he
{as himself again, longing to subjugate the Panther, to enslave
er.
He took opium late in the afternoon, and strolled far eastward
into the busy streets of plebeian London. He was jostled by
evil-smelling crowds, in districts he had never before entered.
It was a Saturday night, and in these remote regions men and
women and children were doing their weekly marketing, amid
the glare of gas-lit shops, amid the raucous roar of untiring cos-
termongers. Stephen moved through these crowds in a dream,
stimulated by their noisy life, but unperceptive of its details. Sud-
denly, as he turned a corner, a shrill voice screamed in his ear
" Tell your fortune, young man '1 "
The scene to which he was aroused by this wild yell was a
singular one. Behind the stall of an itinerant seller of coffee and
saloop (reader, drankest thou evsr saloop lknowest thou its
source and its effects '2) stood a tall, gaunt, wild-eyed gipsy, tell-
ing fortunes in coffee-grounds. A group of girls surrounded the
stand, pressing forward to spend their sixpences in purchasing
the preternatural. The primary object of the stall had been
superseded, but the juice of the orchis may tly yield to a pro-
phecy of the orchis. \Vhen Stephen appeared, the Romany
chi, seeing, it may be supposed, a more extravagant customer,
neglected the waiting girls to attract his attention; It took him a
minute or two to ascertain what she wanted. TVhen he discovered,
he consented to hear her predictions.
She examined the coffee-grounds in a cup, and the palm of his
hand. Then she looked at him curiouslv.

" You will see stranger sights than you have seen, though they
were strange enough. You have had a lady at our feet, and
you have a devil at your elbow, and there are t ree beautiful
women who have reason to fear you, and three erce men who
have reason to hate you ; but you will love when you marry, and
you will die in your bed."
"Thank you," said Stephen dreamily, giving her a sovereign.
" Good evening."
He went on. The girls with their sixpences pressed forward
eagerly to learn the future.
" No," said the gipsy hag. " I have been forced to tell him
truth. I will tell you no more lies to-night."
Stephen reached his rooms about midnight, and went straight
to bed, ordering Auguste not to call him the next morning,
whatever happened. He wanted one of those long nights of
rest and inspiration which strengthened him for the world.
And he got what he wanteddelicious sleep, yet a pageant oi
tlreams.
He dreamt that Isola Chester and the wild-eyed gipsy were
oneone pro hetess, vainly prophesying his future. He dreamt
that he was aphael Branscombe, and that Claudia, his sister,
confessed that she loved Ste hen Langton, and that he killed
her kneeling at his feet. l-lie dreamt that he (still Raphael?
wandered on a beautiful seashore with a woman more beautifu
than he had ever seen, and that they stepped into a white-sailed
bark, and that a tempest caught them amid the summer calm,
and that they were drowned together. Yes, they lay at the very
bottom of the ocean, on a bed of soft sands and tiny shells, and
she was folded in his arms, and the great sh sailing by glared
at them with glassy eyeballs. He dreamt (still as Raphael) that
the beautiful unknown changed in his embrace to sweet Anne
Page, and they were both alive again, and suddenly an old man,
centuries old. stabbed her as she lay in his arms, and the hot
blood from her white breast ooded him with a hideous red.
Thus he dreamt, vividly, and when he awoke he found by his
Watch that he had slept twelve hours. He awoke refreshed in
mind as well as body.
" Why," he said to himself, "should I persecute poor little
Anne, or aid Raphael in his diabolical schemes? I won't do it.

much heyond me ; and I would be her master if I married.
Egad, the Panther should be tamed."
Somewhat after this foolish filehlol'l Stephen soliloqnised. He
would leave Morll un unished for Anues sake. He would try
to save Anne from Rap ael. He would go and tell Claudia that
he loved her. He would even, he thought, venture on giving
some good advice to Isola Chester.
How to begin l He began the very next day, when the hour
for morning calls arrived. He ordered his horse, and rode to the
Mesopotamian terrace. Mrs. Morll was at home and alone.
"Anne," he said, after the usual coinmonplaces of converse,
"you look upon me as an old friend, I hope I'
" Oh yes," she replied nervously, aware that such a commence-
ment preluded some of that excellent advice that old friends think
they have a right to inict upon us.
" Don't. you think it was a ureat pity you came to Greenwich
with Mr. Branscombe'l What would your husband say if he
knew it 1"
" I don't know," she answered faintly.
'- Well, my dear Anne," proceeded Stephen, " you know I have
a right to look upon you as my sist~r. You are only seventeen
now, and l have known you ever since you were six. You are
quite a child !"
"Quite a child !" she exclaimed resentfully. " Yes, everybody
tells me that. Claudia put me in short froc 's and beat me, and
Humphrey makes me do exactly whar he teils me, and that im-
pudent Miss Chester called me baby. Nobody thinks me a. woman
except Raphael, and he loves me."
" Loves you, you silly girl !" interrupted Stephen, "don't you
think it. He's only playing with you to revenge himself on Mor-
ll for marrying you. Would he have made you dine at Green-
wich if he loved you 7"
"I don't knew," she sobbed. "Evervhody's against me. I
know I love him. I'd lie down and let him tread upon me if he
liked. I'd kill myself if he told me to."
At that very moment the Seraph entered.
" Ah, Langton," he said pleasantly, " you've turned traitor, eh'l
I heard some of your talk. You want to save this child whom
you used to love. Well, I think you are right, perhaps. And
yet I don't know."
He sat down and seemed to reflect. Anne remained silent.
Stephen said-
"I told lllrs. Morll vou did not love her. and only carel to
revenge yourself on her husband. Is not that true?"
"My dear fellow," said the Seraph, "suppose it granted, for
arguments sake. Suppose I leave this poor child to that surly
husband of hers. This would be right, of coursevirtuous

Attorney-General, and Sir Humphreyor even Chancellor and
Baron Kingsleat; little Anne a comely and contented matron.
You think this would happen? Oh, no, no. This little girl here
would break her heart, would pine away, would die in a year or
two; that miserable Morll would have her money, and would
be rather glad to get rid of her. Is not this true, Anne 1"
"Yes," she said, her brown eyes glistening through their
tears.
"Come here," he said. She came.
The Seraph smoothed from her fair brow the abundant chest-
nut hair, and gazed into the tearful brown eyes, and said
" Kiss me, ct."
She kissed 'm as lovingly as Acme her Septimillus.
"You see, my dear Langton, that this child loves me. Now,
it is a great misfortune that any one should love me, who am
heartless and a breaker of hearts ; but I am unable to see that I
should do her any good by acting virtuously, and never seeing
her again, and leaving her to be slowly murdered by the vaurien
who possesses her. Marriage is a great institution, though such
a marriage as Morll's is nothing to boast of ; but love is omni-
potent, and will sometimes supersede even marriage. This little
girl is minc~by a stronger claim than Morll has. Whether I
shall take her away from him I have not yet decided, but I will
not kill her by refusing to see her again."
"It is a strange business," said Stephen. "You should not
have made her love you, Branscombe."
"I should not, that's true. Still, mine was not the rst or the
greatest crime. Love will have its way. But Morll should not
have retended to love her, for the sake of her money. For that
scoun relism he deserves the worst that can happen to him."
" Well," said Stephen, " I can say no more. I have loved
Anne since she was a tiny child of six, and it is a bitter grief to
me to see her married to a. villain, and loving you so madly. I
would save her from sorrow if I could, but how can I? I have
a terror of what may happen to her. I fancy her a deserted,
starving, wretched wanderer, dying God knows where."
"We won't let her do any of those horrid things," said the
Seraph, atting her soft cheek. " If I run away with her, and
Morlill 5 outs me, you'll take care of her, I know; but the barrel
is not made that is to carry my death."
" Good-bye," said Stephen. "It is useless to talk more."
" Oh! if you're going, so am I," said the Seraph. " It's getting
late, and I don't care to meet that fellow Morll. Good-bye,
Baby, I'll drop in u on you again soon."
" Soon," she sai , in a low, entreating voice, " soon, very
soon."
" Poor little Anne ! " said the Seraph, as he and Stephen parted
in the street; "I wish she did not love me ; but it is too late.

" I think I shall."
" Well, let us meet at eight. I want to talk to you. I wish
that fellow Mortill would break his neck, but lawyers never do
such things."
" No, confound them i" said Stephen.
" If we were in Italy now, a few gold coins would buy a stealthy
stiletto. I don't approve of such things in general; but really
Morll's baseness makes me feel like a Borgia."
They parted. As Stephen rode away, the trend of his horse's
hoofs, the roar of the streets, every sound that he heard, seemed
to syllable themselves into

LAUDIA BRANSCOMBE was at this period somewhat er-
plexed. That happy inventor of names who rst ca led
her the Panther touched in certain points the very essence of her
character. She was beautiful and wild and strong. Was she
loving also? The feline tribe are not. so far as we can judge.
Mr. Henry Taylor, who is too often rather a prose-poet, has, at
least, one passage of poetic humour in " St. Clement's Ere."
There are two young ladies, Flos and Iolande, the one a charm-
ing saint, the other a charming coquette. Iolande gives Flos a
lecture, in the form of a dream ; pretty little naughty Flos
retaliates :
" Yes, Iolande,
You're ever dreaming dreams, and when they're bad
They're always about me. I, too, can dream,
But otherwise than you. The god of dreams
Who sleeps with me is blithe and debonair,
Else should he not be partner of my bed.
I dreamt I was a cat, and much caressed,
And. fed with dainty viands ; there was cream,
And sh, and esh, and porridge, but no mice ;
And I was fat and sleek, but in my heart
There rose a long and melancholy mew,
Which meant I must hare mice. And therewithal
I found myself transported to the hall
Of an old castle, with the rapturous sound
Of gnawing of old wainscot in my ears ;
With that I couched and sprang, and sprang and couched,
My soul rejoicing,"
The little girl's longing (for everybody knows what) is poetically
given here, though some of the phraseology is stupid enough for

Topper; but unhappin Mr. Taylor is not a poet, and nothing is
more painful than to see a man straining himself to appear some-
thing which he is not and cannot be.
Well, Flos wanted mice. The Panther was not unlike her.
But the Panther, who had been studying her own character intel-
ligently enough for about a dozen years, was not yet certain of
herself. She knew that she was not wholly feline, but that was
almost all she knew. She had been purely feline, nothing else,
in her little affair with Stephen. What might have occurred if she
had got him Well under those soft velvet paws of hers, she had
not considered. Even cats~ catch 'l'artars now and then : a very
ne 'l'om of mine, who pounced on a. tame peregrine falcon, under
the impression that he would be easy eating, was a case in point.
The hawk lost a few feathers,but poor old Tom never mewed again.
HoweVer, Stephen had slipped from under her velvet paws, leav-
ing her with nothing save a vehement dcsire to scratch him.
And now he seemed likely to give her a chance. He spent long
mornings in her drawing-room. He rode with her, met her at
parties, brought her bouquets and opera-boxes. He showed he!
a timid tranquil style of attention, which was subtly attering.
He deVoted himself to her evidently.
But then there was Sir Arthur Willesden. In reference to
him, Claudia had committed one of those strange blunders from
which no women are free. She pined, as I have said, for sub-
jugation. She wanted a strong' hand to tame and subdue her.
No such had come ; and her restless fancy made a t hero of Sir
Arthur. He was big, burly, weighty, magnicent in apparel,
jewellery, odours. He had that absolute self-condence often
found in men whose extreme dulness prevents their forming an
accurate estimate of themselves. You couldn't atter Sir Arthur
\Villesden. He verily believed himself unusually handsome,
unusually clevar. The Panther fascinated him; but that she
was too good for him, a creature above him, a being whose bril-
liant vivacious opalescent nature he could not appreciate, was a 
notion that he would have laughed to scorn. What could be too
good for Sir Arthur Willesden'!
It would be untrue to say that Claudia took him at his own
estimate. Not at all. There were, indeed, times of unusual
clear~sightedness, when he seemed to her ridiculouswhen she
saw him almost what he was, an empty vulgar "swell." But so
strong was her cravingr to be mastered, that she could not or
would not shake off the notion that Sir Arthur was her pre-
destined master. That Stephen Langton could till that position
was to her simply ridiculous. She thought of him as a mere
boya boy whom she had petteda t sweetheart for little
Anne.
Sometimes. it must be admitted, there came upon her with
vivid remembrance that scene in the Idlechester garden, when
Stephen had seemed to exercise kingly away over herwhen,

THE PAN THER WOOED. 163
lying carelessly on the turf, with closed eyes, he had appeared to
com l her lips to his by some mysterious umgnetism. She coul~l
see let-self blush from head to foot. sometimes, when standing at
night before her mirror, brushing out her long blaI-k tresses, the
thought of that incident suddenly occurred to her. Stephen had
mastered her then.
Again, she thought of him in another mood. Guided by evil
counsel she had offered herself to him. Had she been a Circas-
Fian in some Eastern slave-market, o'ering' herself for sale to
\'izier or Sultan, she could not more thoroughly have accepts-d
humiliation. That humiliation he had deepened unutterably by
refusal. The Sultan had looked at the ivory shoulders and rosy-
ushed bosom, at the bri:hteree and lissom limbs, and had said,
" No, she won't do." When Claudia thought keenly of this. she
felt disposed to marry Stephen Langton, that she might torture
him to the utmostthat she might have a comfortable matri-
monial right to torture him.
It was obvious to her that Stephen was ready to make her an
offer at any moment. This was not obvious about Sir Arthur.
She could not quite understand this change in Stephen's conduct.
She had not, as we have, followed him in his interviews with
Anne Page and lsola Chester. She would probably have been
extremely indignant if she had known how lllltcl'l pity mingled
with and even prompted his present feelings towards her. His
poetic temperament gave him insight into character ; he saw
that she deserved pity, and pitied her accordingly. But when
you take to pitying a woman of surpa=sing beauty, the result of
such pity is predicable. We know what happened to Bacchus
when he found Ariadne deserted in Naxos
" Florens volitabat Iacchus,
Cum thiaso Satyrorum et Nysigenis Silenis,
Te quazreus, Ariadne, tuoque incensus amore."
Hang it! I can't et over that vile habit of quoting the classics
which incenses mytind critics.
So constant a visitor at Clarges Street was Sir Arthur Willes-
den that Stephen seldom got a minute's tte-d-tite with Claudia.
Raphael, who lounged into the room occasionally, was an amused
spectator of the comedietta. There was the Panther almost ready
to accept Sir Arthur, who didn't propose, and in a perpetual state
of apprehension of a proposal from Stephen, whom she could not
briner herself to accept. There was the Baronet, playing a game
which often brought the lightning into Raphael's eyesmaking
love to Claudia, yet with an ever-present prudential care not to
commit himself. And there was Stephen, not quite in love with
Claudia, yet getting daily more near to the boiling-point, and
assuredly eager to other himself to her. It was vera' amusing to
the Seraph,

At last he determined to act the part of a Dem a machinu.
He wanted Stephen to try his luck, and have it over. So, one
mominw, when the four were as usual assembled, he said
"Willesden, you are a good judgeof horse-esh, I know. I
wish you'd come down to Tattersall's, and give me your opinion
of a hunter I thought of buying."
They went. Stephen and the Panther were left alone. Of course
they talked for some time in a constrained fashion of matters
utterly uninteresting to both of them. But this could not last.
The moment had come for which Stephen was longing. He saw
a strange light in the mysterious depths of Claudia's black eyes.
The memory of old days came upon him ; the terror of two
wasted lives urged him on; he rose from the seat in which
he had been idly plucking a geranium to pieces, and said
abru tly
" laudia, I love on."
rl'hou h the Pant er must have expected this, its suddenness
render her breathless. She looked at him with a strange, vague,
uncertain gaze, as if to assure herself of his identity. She also
rose from her seat, and stood facing hima wondrous creature,
whose beauty seemed almost terrible, whose possession a thing to
be dreaded, save by a man to whom fear was unknown.
"I love you, Claudia," repeated Stephen vehemently. "Say
you love me."
And he approached her, putting out his hands to embrace her;
but she waved him back, as Cassandra might have waved back
the god whom she deluded; and she stood with bright eyes,
full of re, with one arm outstretched, as if. for a moment
inspired.
"Stephen," she said, " I hate you."
"No, Claudia, no," he went on, with eager rapidity, " you
don't hate me. I won't believe it. You say it to punish me for
my foolishness. 0 Claudia, my love, my darling ! you know you
loved me onceyou told me soyou threw yourself into my
arms, and told me so." '
She laughed a scornful laugh.
"You believed that," she said. "Foolish boy! It was a lie!"
" My God !" exclaimed Stephen Langton, starting back as it" he
had received a terrible blow. "My God ! are all women falsei
No, Claudiasay you are deceiving mesay you loved me than,
at leastlet me think I had your love just one moment."
" Stephen Langton, you are foolish," said Claudia. " You took
a mere comedy for reality. You fancied you had humiliated me.
How could I care for a mere boy like you? I tried an experi-
ment on youa cruel experiment, perhapsbecause I knew what
a trivial irt Anne Page was, and I wished to discover if you
really loved her. I was glad to nd you did. I should have had
a higher opinion of you now, if you had not tried to persuade
yourself that you were in love with me. I regret to destroy your

poetic visions, but really I never cared for you. I always thought
you a child."
The Panther's change of mood was perfect. The calm and
contemptuous way in which she enunciated these sentences was
harder for Stephen to bear than their actual meaning.
"It is all over," he said. "Good-bye, Claudia." He caught
her hand and kissed it, and left. the room.
" There," said the Panther, " that's done, and I'm rather sorry
for it. I've thrown away a true heart. But he is a child. He
could never be my master."
She had said these words aloud. Hardly had she uttered them
when the door opened, and Ste hen re-entered. A change had
come over him. He was impe ed by a strong resolution. He.
walked quickly across to this wild creature who had rejected
him, and caught her hands in his, and said with swift passionate
emphasis-
"Claudia, you are false. You love me. You loved me that
day. You are mine, and by Heaven I will have you !" He
caught her in his arms. "Claudia," he said, "the truth ! Tell
me the truth. Do you love me 1"
She had slipped from his embrace to the oor, where she knelt,
one white arm on the sofa, the other resting on his knee. Her
face drooped downwards, veiled by her profuse black tresses, but
he forced her to look at him, though she shrank from the strong
light in his eyes, though a ruddy blush covered her face ; and he
repeated his uestion
" Tell me, 0 you love me 7 "
" Yes," she said, in a low, strange voice.
" And did you love me then ? "
"Yes."
He arose from his seat, but she still knelt by the sofa.
" I think I know the truth now, but it is too late."
And with no further word, he went away. And Claudia knelt
where he left her, stunned, stupeed, thunderstruck, while in her
ears there seemed for ever to resound the fatal words
" Too late! too late ! "
And when she aroused herself, and sought her room, the Pan-
ther thought to herself that after all she had been wrong in her
estimate of Stephen. He had power in him, this b0 ; he had
con uered her; he had made her say she loved him, t ough she
was y no means certain it was true. But he was her master;
she would gladly be his slave and do his bidding; and she had
lost him ! Why was this? "'hat had rst brought him back to
subjugate her, and had then taken him away, rejecting her'l
Was he destined for ever to humiliate herl
Stephen would have found it hard to answer these very ques-
tions. A erce resolve had brought him back, determined to
tame her; a shuddering reaction had carried him away again, he
knew not why. She was as beautiful as ever; she loved him;

she knelt at his feet: he knew he had conquered her, yet in the
hour of his conquest he ung her from him. Why? He was an.
enigma to himself. He ordered his horse, and rode out of London
on the western road, through " Brentford town, a town of mud,"
through the towns, almost as muddy, of Honnslow and Coln-
brookhe rode without pause. His horse was a good one, of
Raphael's selection; but the ace at which he pushed him along
the hard road sorely tried im. By and by, after about two
hours' hard riding, he crossed the Thames, and passed through a
long narrow-streeted little town, and found himself on a tine
wide expanse of open heath. dotted with trees. As he crossed
this heath, there came upon him the unpleasant knowledge that
his horse was dead lame. He pulled up at a small wayside
public-housethe Coach-and-Horses, or Horse-and-Groom, or
something similarand dismounted. The landlord came out
u " hursey " landlord, by good luck.
" Leave him to me, sir," said the man. " You've rode him a
sight too far and too fast. I'll doctor him, though. We've got
a very snug stable."
Stephen, in his resent mood, was glad to be relieved from all
lalnxiety about his horse. He sat on a wooden bench outside the
ouse.
" Landlord," he said, " some ale."
A mighty draught he drank. The ale of Berkshire had not at
that time become utterly undrinkable. vBurton-on-Trent has
annihilated almost all other breweries.
" Upon my life," said Stephen, after his thirst was quenched,
" I am uncommonly hungry. Can you give me something to eat,
landlord '1 "
" Bacon and eggs, sir," he suggested.
"Bacon and eggs is a veiy fair dish, but I should like some-
thing besides. Are those fellows intended to be eaten?" he
asked, pointing to some very ne ducks that were splashing in a
pond close by.
Stephen contrived to dine. Having nished, he strolled out to
see the neighbourhood. He had not thought of inquiring where
he was; he had ridden simpl to get rid of his stmuge excite-
ment; he did not know how ar he was from London. But as
he stood in the road looking towards London, and saw on the
right the little inn, and on the left. behind an orchard, a square
stone edice with an inscription OVer its gateway, it suddenly
or cuired to him that he was on the very spot whi-re lsola Chester,
a tranip's brat, had been bought by Raphael Branscombe, the
inexplicable, ten years before. Surely this was the place. Yes,
that building on the left was a girls' school. A labourer came by
at this moment.
" Is this Maidenhead Thicket 'l " asked Stephen.
" Yes, sir," he said, touching his hat.
"Why am I brought here without any design of my own?'

laid Ste hen to himself. " There is something strange about it.
I have a ways been the victim of coincidences. I must unravel
this mystery."
He returned to the inn.
'5' I'ndlord," he said, " how long before my horse will be t to
T] e
" Not less than a couple of days, sir. He's very lame."
"Then he must stay here, and I'll send my groom for him.
How can I get to London 'I "
"Very easy, sir. We've fteen coaches up every day, and as
many down. There's one due in about a quarter of an hour."
"Ah ! I'm in no such hurry as that. I'm rather tired. I sup-
pose you can give me a bed if necessary 7"
"Oh yes, sir, as clean and comfortable as there is in the
tummy."
" Very well. I'll sleep here."
The sun had just set in glory; daylight was fading; but the
radiant light of a moon almost at the full compensated the loss.
Stephen lighted a cigar and loitered away over the Thicket. His
brain was in a whirl with this day's work. He. had famed the
Panther! Ay, for this he had longed. She had excited within
him the lust of conquest. He felt as Theseus felt when Hip-
polyta was his captive and slave.
Butwhat next?
And why was he here'l Stephen rmly believed that the cir-
cumstances of his life were modied by certain special inter-
ferences. I am not saying that his belief was correct; I merely
say that it was of moment, for it never ceased to inuence his
conduct. Finding himself at the very point where Isiila Chester
had been saved from the roads for heaven knows what fate, he
felt an absolute assurance that he was there for some reason,
He loitered along the grassy ways of the 'l'hicket in the silver
moonlight. When he returned to the little inn he found a stage-
coach just stopping in front, a tall man in a heavy cloak descend-
ing. while the guard gro ed in the hind boot for luggage. The
bright lamps of the coac made paths of light through the mist
which began to gather.
Stephen stood at the inn dam, and watched. The tall man
came rapidly across the plot of grass which separated the inn
from the highroad, carrying a travelling-bag in one hand, a box
of no great size in the other. The coach was already whirling
away across the Thicket towards London.
" Landlord," said the stranger, in a voice of command, "supper.
I sleep here tH-Illgllt."
" You can have supper at once, sir, but I don't know al-out
sleepling. This gentleman," indicating Stephen, "has just taken
a bet ."
"yell, I mist sleep here, somehow. Supper rst, at any
rate.

' ":4.
A private sitting-room in this little place was impossible.
Stephen and the stranger sat op site each other b the re.
The Thicket is a good deal changed0 since Elizabeth's eye, when
the Vicar of Hurley was paid an additional salary for the peril of
crossing it to reach at Maidenhead, but Stephen thought the
new comer wougd have seemed a doubtful customer on that lonely
heath. He was very brown and bearded, with sunken sinister
eyes, that glared from under heavy eyebrows like torches in
caverns, and a great scar across his forehead, that reddened when
he spoke, and mighty gnarled hands, with massive gold rings, in
which uncouth stones were set.
Stephen dreamed that he had seen this manelsewherein
some pre-existent state perhaps. He felt absolutel certain that
there was a mysterious connection between themt at they were
brought together in this inn for some strange purpose. He
smoked, and sipped his ale, and waited.
The stranger supped with a ne appetitesuch ap etites men
got outside mail-coaches in the old days. A couple 0 ducks had
been dressed for Ste hen, who had eaten about half of one ; but
this hungry man p0 ished off every scrap that was left, and then
devoured a hissing dish of eggs and bacon. When it was over,
this meal, he lled a huge pipe with black negrohead tobacco,
and said to the landlord
" Just bring me that box, will you '! "
It was not a large boxabout eighteen inches squaremade of
oak, and well secured with brass. The landlord could scarcely
lift it to the table. He made an exclamation of surprise as he
placed it before its owner.
"Yes, it's heavy," he said. "Now, look here, landlord, I've
had enough of your beer, and I'm going to drink some stuff of
my ownmedicine, you know, that my doctor prescribes for a
complaint I've got. But you may charge me for every glass of
hot water I use, just as well as if I put spirit in it."
Therewith he produced from the chest a good-sized bottle of
rum, and a lemon of noble size.
"Try some of this, sir," he said to Stephen. "It's real old
J amaica."
It wasglorious stuff ; and the lemon when cut di'used a ne
fragrance through the room.
" Landlord," he said, " help yourself to a glass, and mind you
put it in the bill."
After this he sat for about half an hour, drinking this superb
rum, and smoking his enormously strong negrohead, apparently
Well pleased with his position, Stephen the while quietly study-
ing him. At length he said
" Landlord. how about a bed '3 "
"We've only one room, your honour. It's double-bedded, to
mantis; bpt perhaps neither you nor the other gentleman would
' e t.

THE PANTHER WOOED. 169
" Oh !" said Stephen, " I really do not care. At a country inn
one expects to rough it. I have no objection to your occupying
one of the beds, sir, if you have none."
"Good," said be. "I'm obliged to you, sir. I shan't disturb
you. I've a good conscience, and can sleep soundly. But I'm
portd going to bed yet, so keep up the supply of hot water, land-
0 . '
All this time there had been other guests in the little parlour
-coachmen and grooms and gamekeepers of the neighbouring
gentry. By eleven these were all gone, and the landlord's wife
and daughter went off to bed.
" Now," said the stranger, "we can have a quiet gossip. Here,
landlord, t some more rum. It won't hurt an old hand like
you. How ong have you kept this little inn 7"
" About fteen years, sir," said the host, who had very willingly
responded to the stranger's invitation.
" You must see some ueer things on the roadside sometimes.
Can't you s in us a yarn "
" I'm no and at that kind of thing, sir, else I have seen some
odd sights. Once two gentlemen came by two different coaches,
one up and the other down, and went out on the Thicket and
fought a duel. And another time a young lady and gentleman
were running away to get married, and the lady's father overtook
them just here, and she had to go back again. And another time
a poor gipsy woman or tram died just by the horse-trough, and
a gentleman riding by boug t a little girl she had with her, and
sent her to school close here."
Somehow, Stephen was prescient of the landlord's telling
Isola's storyprescient also of its producing some strange effect
on the stranger. At this (point the ames in those cavernous eyes
gave a leap. And he sai , but coolly enough-
" That was a curious l'anc . How long ago is that?"
" About ten years," said t e landlord.
" And is the child at school now i "
"No, sir. She ran away about two years ago with a young
farmer that lived here, and we've never heard of her since."
The stronger had his tumbler in his right hand. A sudden
contraction of the ngers smashed it to fragments The landlord
sprang up to remove them.
"Wait," he said; " I am interested in that girl. What has
become of the young farmer who took her away?"
" He came back without her. But he got such a bad character
about here, that he went off altogether. I think he Went to sea."
" And nothing is known of the girl by the schoolmistress 'l "
" Nothing, sir."
"Who was the gentleman who bought her and sent her to
school 7"
" Nobody knows. He called himself Johnson, but it wasn't
his name. But we heard that he took her away from Pringle

that's the farmer she ran 08 withand horsewhipped him well.
He deserved it, the scam !"
" B Heaven !" said t e stranger, striking his st heavily on
the ta le, "I'm glad he is away from here. I should kill him.
Lapdlo'rd, are you quite sure nobody about here knows where the
r is "
g] " Quite, sir."
" My God !" exclaimed the stranger, with almost a sob, "what
shall 1 do?"
All this time Stephen Langton had not spoken.
CHAPTER XIX.
THE OLD wonr.
STEPHEN did not speak. He sat and watched the wild old
man, scarred and bearded. He felt as if he had possessed
prevision of this strange occurrence. Destiny had brought him
to this wayside innbrought him face to face with the man who
hungered to know what he could tell. A curious coincidence,
the ordinary moraliser would say. Stephen Langton thought
otherwise. For him life was full of what we call curious coin
cideuces. When he found himself, by mere accident, a dweller
at this little hostelry on Maidenhead Thicket, at whose door the
mother of Isola had died, he felt conscious of an impending
event.
We do not sufciently allow for the wide differences in human
tem erament. Some men hear the music of the spheres ; others,
dea to that sublime harmony, are delighted with what they get
at the Alhambra. Some men see visions and dream dreams;
others go through the world unconscious of everything that does
not appeal to their senses. Some men can love, can hate, can
feel ; others are mere automata, for aught that can be perceived.
And I am not sure that Mr. Browning has seen the whole truth
in that wondrous poem of his, " Mr. Sludge the Medium." Are
there not men with what may be called the pretcrnatural tem-
erament? Just as the poet's temperament vibrates to delicate
inuences utterly unl'elt by an average shopkeeper, may not a cer-
tain nature l'eel dimly CUDsClOLIS of the presence or the passage
of a spiritual visitant?
And as to events. " Adventures are to the adventurous," says
Mr. Disraeli. This is a half truth. Many a man pines for adven-
ture, seeks for it over wide realms and desolate seas, yet new-r
meets it. Another shall be unable to walk down the common-
place strcet in which he dwells without an adventure. Ay, and

he knows that it is coming; he feels it afar off, as you feel the
advent of the mist that as yet has not climbed past the horizon ;
he rises from his bed in the morning. and says to himself,
" Something will happen to-day." Nor is that prophetic instinct
ever wrong.
Well, when a chemist can tell us why the rose is red, or why
magnesium gives a brilliant light, or why a drop of hydrocyanic
acid extinguishes life, or why iodine cures goitre and takes sun-
pictures, or why chloroform for a time annihilates the senses,
then, perhaps, the philosopher may discover some reason for
the differences which exist in human temperaments. But, for
the man to whom there is something laughably absurd in the
idea of a coexistent invisible worlda world which osculates
this material world at rare oints and under rare circumstances
for that man to maintain t at what to him is incomprehensible
is therefore impossible, is silly beyond measure. As well may
the unmathematical man deride the notion that
rod-ow
is suggestive of ivy.
Let the event evolve, thought Stephen, as he gazed sometimes
at his companion, sometimes at the calcined caverns of the fire.
Let us see who he is, this stranger whom I have been impelled
to come thirty miles to meet. We shall not part without some
weighty converse. Let time reveal.
"Landlmd," said the stranger after a while, "you can go to
bed. This gentleman and I will stay by the re an hour longer.
If I burn down the house, 1'11 pay for it."
" It's contrary to my rules, sir, ' said the innkeeper.
" Pshaw ! who told you to make rules for us? I obey no
rules. Be 05, here's a trie for breaking your rules."
He ung upon the table a huge gold coin, bigger than a crown-
iece, the product of some far foreign mint. The amazed land-
ord took it and went away without a word.
" I don't know why I met you here, sir," said the stranger to
Stephen, after a long pause. " When I was a bov I read a sin-
gular poem about an old sailor and an albatross. The old fellow
went about the world half-crazed, telling his story ; and he
always knew at a rst glimpse the man who was bound to listen
to him. Now I feel something like that. You will listen to me,
that I know ; and you will have something to tell me, I believe.
Let's make a night of it." -
The night was pretty well worn already. Stephen, however,
cared little. To him it mattered not whether he slept at noon-
day or the noon of night. He expressed his willingness to pass
the hours in any way that suited his comrade.
" You see those letters," said the stranger. pointing to a brazen
M. B. on the cover of his oaken chest. "Here they are again,"
and he bared one of his massive arms, and showed them dis-

under them. Those are my initials. Mark of the Beast, some
of my complimenta friends call them. Well, sir, there they
are, at any rate, arid here am I; and my name's Marmaduke
Branscombe. Did you ever hear of the Branscombes'l"
"Yes," said Stephen.
He did not feel surprised at this fresh coincidence. He seemed
to have foreknown it.
"Ay, the Branscombes. of Branscombe. A wild lotthree
brothers of itsRalph and IValter and Marmaduke. I was the
youngest. They sent me to schoolto Winchester. I never learnt

just walked off to Southampton, and got a berth aboard ship.
And I've been knocking about the world ever since, and never
set eyes on any of my relations. They all think I'm dead long
ago.
" I don't know where I haven't been, or what I haven't done.
I've been a pirate, and a smuggler, and a acher, and a high-
wayman. I've dug for diamonds in the ral mountains, and
wandered fortune-telling with the gipsies. My mates call me
Wolf Branscombe, and I think the name suits. I'm altogether
a nice fellow to sleep with in a double-bedded room in a lonely
inn on Maidenhead Thicket."
Stephen laughed.
"Ay, you're made of the right stuff, and don't mean to be
frivhtened. You needn't. I never did anything shabby. If a
fe ow had what I wanted, I didn't get behind him and strangle
him ; no, I gave him fair notice I meant to have his watch, or his
money, or whatever it might be, and that he'd better be ready to
ght for it. And I only want one thing of youthat is, to tell
me what you know of the little girl that was brought here ten
years 0."
" ls s e related to you 'I " asked Stephen.
" She is my daughter. The fellow who sold herhe was her
uncleconfessed to me what he had done, when I had my knee
on his chest, and m ngers at his lying throat. And 1 let him
pbut promised i I found she had come to harm, I would hunt
'm down and kill him. And so I will, by God l"
The old Wolf emphasised his resolve with a blow of his st on
the table. He looked grim and erce, and the scar on his brow
was red as blood. Stephen began to think that he was rather in
I. x. He did not know how far it would be safe to tell this
man where to nd Isola. Poor girl! she had come to harm;
might not her father choose to-kill some one besides the scoundrel
whom he threatened 'l
" 1 can wait," said Marmaduke Branscombe. "I can wait for

what you have to tell, whether it is much or little. Don't hurry
yourself."
"You have never since seen either of your brothers or their
children I" said Stephen tentatively.
"No, but 1 have heard all about them. I know that Ra] )h
has s em. all his money, and Walter's a parson. Poor old Ralp !
how he used to lick me when l was a youngster. And now he's
hard up. But I've got money enough for both of us ; there's
more in this box than'll pay his debts twice over."
" Do you know anything about his son Raphael 'l"
" 1 only know he's said to be devilish clever. You know him,
I can see ; what do you say about him'l "
" Upon my word, I can't tell you," said Stephen ; "sometimes
I think he's aVery good fellow ; sometimes there seems something
endish about him. He has always been very kind to me."
"The Branscombes are true to their friends, and know how to
hate their enemies. But you have something to tell me; you
have heard of my little Girl. Look here; you are a gentleman,
and don't want a bribe, but I'll give any man this who can tell
me where she is."
He took from his box a superb Oriental sapphire, as big as a
(luck's egg, which an emperor or a bilLdiscounter might vainly
long to buy.
"It cost me that little out across the forehead," said the Wolf.
" You may have it, if you like to tell me all you know about my
loittle1 girl. It will buy any place in this county, except Windsor
ast e."
"Thank you," replied Stephen; "but you rightly said just
now that I did not need a bribe. I will tell you what I can.
The person who bought your daughter and placed her at school
was her cousin Raphael."
" My God ! " exclaimed the other in amaze.
" She seems to have inherited your tendencies, for she ran
away from school with a young farmer."
"Did he marry her? " interrupted Marmaduke Branscombe
impetuously.
'( No."
"Where is he'l By Heaven, let me meet him l"
"I don't know what has become of him. Raphael follovVed

in London now."

" Oh yes, often."

brother-in-law. By Heaven, I frightened him ! I squeezed the
truth out of his lying throat ; I'd have squeezed the life out if he
hadn't told me all he knew."
The old Wolf paused for some time, and meditativer puffed
his negrohead.
" I don't even know her name," he said at last, as if to himself.
"And she will hardly be able to believe I am her father. If I
thought she was happy 1 would go away without her knowing
anything about it."
} Hg sat in reective m00d, with corrugated brows, looking into
t 1e re.
"No," he said after a while ; "I must see her ; I must get her
to tell me everything. I must nd out for myself whether she
is happy. And I will give her money enough to tempt a prince
to marry her. Is she pretty?"
"Very beautiful," answered Stephen.
The old man looked at him curiously.
" Very beautiful, eh '1" he said, half in soliloquy. " Very
beautifulvery youngvery poor. Who shall blame her if she
is very wicked '! Not Inot her father. But there may be others
to blameothers to punish."
"Well," he resumed, " I shall go to bed. I must sleep upon all
this. Will you take me to her to-morrow l"
"Had you not better see your nephew rst 2 " asked Stephen.
"Perhaps I had. We can see him to-morrow, I sup ose?"
"No doubt of it. I will go with you to London, an take you
straight to his house."
"That's right. And now, if you are not afraid of a wild old
wolf like me, let us nd out our double-bedded room."
Marmaduke Branscomhe, oak chest in hand, slowly and heavily '
ascended the creaking stairs of the little inn. He kicked off his
boots, and threw himself on one of the beds without any further
undressing. '
" Good night," he said ; " don't be afraid to sleep."
"Not at all," said Stephen with a laugh. But he could not
sleep. It was about four o'clock when they came upstairs.
Stephen heard the rickety old clock on the stairs strike ve and
six. His companion lay still enough, only moving once or twice
to ll his pipe, which Stephen could see in the darkness like an
hyaena's eye in a cavern. Soon after six he suddenly s rang up,
mlled on his bouts, and went out. Stephen rose ant watched
im from the window stride rapidly away over Maidenhead
Thicket, smoking as he strode.
And then, at last, Stephen Langton sleptno very healthful
sleep, for potent rum and late hours have baneful tendencies.
It was almost noon when he awokeawoke uncertain where he
was, what had really occurred, how much of what he remembered
was actual fact, and how much mere phantzum. As he looked
nround the quaint, oldfashioned room, with its slanting roof and

odd bulwarks, he perceived that his companion of the previous
night was even now lying upon his bed, puing away at his
"Ull'llllcilll. When he saw Stephen moving, he rose and stretched
himself, exclaiming
" Ha, young man, so your sleep is over at last'l You young-
sters can't stand the racketyour nerves are weak. I went away
half-a-dozen miles some hours ago, and hall a dip in the Thames,
and was lucky enouuh to get some sh for breakfat So now, if
you like to get up I'll go and cook the shthese country bump-
'ins don't understand it."
When Stephen descended he found the Wolf had been even
better than his word. Not only had he dressed the sh, but he
had also devilled another of those ill-fated ducks. A very grizzled
old Wolf he looked by daylighthe had been knocked about
evidently ; his erce face and massive hands bore many traces of
hot Work. Yet there was now discernible that curious faint
family likeness "hich strangers See better than friends. Stephen
could nd in his countenance something that reminded him of
both Raphael and Claudia.
"You are looking at my old cuts, Mr. Lnngton," he said.
"I've been pretty nearly cut to pieces more than once. Id a
bayonet sla ) through my chest, and a ball through all my left
ribs, and a ozen other little things that would have killed most
men. Perhaps I'm born to be hanged."
He looked b no means an unlikely subject for that operation.
But he was in igh lee this morning, doubtless with the thought
of nding his dang iter, and he made a prodigious breakfast,
while our Stephen could scarcely touch anything.
" at have they called my little girl I" he asked abruptly.
" lsola," said Stephen.
" An outlandish name, Isola Branscombe ! I wonder whether
she'll like to see me. I wonder whether she'll wish I had
been drowned or shot. I'm a rough old fellow, Mr. Langton,
but I've been longing for years to see that little lass. If she's
afraid of me if she won't believe I'm her father, I'll blow my
brains out."
"She can't well help believing it," said Stephen. "And as
to being afraid, I don't much think she would be afraid of any-
thing."
" Glad to hear it, sirshows she's a Branscombe, Look here,
Mr. Langton, you're doing me a great service; you must take a
triing token of remembrance."
He opened his wonderful chest and produced a diamond ring,
that ashed like a star.
"Wear that for my sake," he said. " It's only a trifle."
Stephen tried hard to refuse, but the old man was obstinate.
At about three o'clock they caught an up-stage, which landed
them in Piccadilly at six. According to promise, Stephen led
the Wolf at once to Clarges Street.

But neither Raphael nor Claudia was at home.
"He may be at the club," said Stephen. "Shall we go and
see? We can leave your things at my rooms, and if you like I
can give you a bed there."
" That will do," he said. " And if we nd Raphael, you can
'ust tell him at once I'm his uncle Marmaduke. It won't frighten
im, I daresay."
They made their way, rst to Jennyn Street, then to the
Chandos. The waiters of that club are in the habit of seeing
some very queer people, and did not inch from Marmaduke's
vast bulk and portentous ugliness. Stephen, on inquiry, found
that the Seraph had ordered dinner for two, and was at present
waiting for it in the smoking-room. Thither they went, and
found Ra hael, enjoying his weed in company with Humphrey
Morll. at had led that hard-working young gentleman to

" Ah !" said Raphael, as they entered, " I thought I had lost

" One or two things," answere tephen drily. "Allow me to
introduce a very pleasant acquaintance I have madeMr. Mar-
maduke Branscombe, Mr. Raphael Branscombe."
" Egad, how ueer !" said the Seraph. "' It's not a hoax, I see ;
in fact, Uncle armaduke, you're devilish like my father. But
eve body thought you were dead years ago."
" thought so myself more than once."
" Queer, certainly. And, may I ask, do you bring back a wife
and family with on? I su pose not, as you seem to have been
knocking about t e world al your life."
" We'll talk of that presently," he answered, in atone signicant
enough to Stephen.
"Precisely,' said the Seraph. "Excuse my abrupt inquiry.
We may as well all dine together."
"I am afraid I shall be rather in the way now," remarked
Morll.
" N ot a bit of it. You see, Langton," said the Seraph, " Mrs.
Morll and Claudia have got some engagement together  a
urely feminine affairI don't understand it; so Morll and I
ecided to dine together. As for you, you'll see yourself adver-
tised for in all the papers to-morrow morning. Your sudden
disappearance was most mysterious. Even Claudia couldn't
account fer it."
" Couldn't she? Well, I'm ercely hungry, now ; I have
eaten no breakist."
" No," said the \Volt', wilh a grunt of laughter. " \Ve drank a
little rum together last night, and the young gentleman seemed
qualmish this morning."
" He's not a Branscombe," observed the Seraph.

THE OLD WOLF. I77
They dined. Very soon after dinner, Humphrey Morll, Whose
conversational powers seemed to have been destroyed by his
unflaggiug attention to business, and who, robnbly, was not very
much at his ease in Stephen's company, h t them, on the plea of
having important papers to look over. The trio then vrent off to
the smoking-room. Marmaduke had said nothing about family
affairs during dinner. He had talked freely, narrating a few of
his adventures, one or two of which would have added a avour
to "Muncbausen." Over his pipe he showed a disposition to
change the subject.
" Ralph is abroad, I suppose," he said.
"Yes," said the Seraph ; "he can't face the baili's 'ust now."
"We'll change all that," growled the Wolf ; " '11 pay his
debts."
" You 1 "
"Ay, why not? I'm his brother; he won't be too proud to
accept my help, I hope 1 "
" Certainly not," answered the Seraph. "But I did not sup-
pose you had been fortunate."
" It depends on what you call fortunate. If to have got enough
to buy back every inch of land that ouzht to be Ralph's is fortu-
nate, then 1 have been. If to be he t from sleep every night by
the ghosts of men I have killed is ortunate, then I have been.
But, pshaw! this is nonsense. What's that ring worth, it you
know a good stone when you see it 1 "
He omted to the diamond he had given Stephen, who handed
it to t e Seraph. Raphael examined it critically.
"Well," he said, " I'm not a jeweller ' but I can tell that's
worth money. Five hundred pounds, perhaps."
"I don't know," said his uncle. "I only know I've got a
hatful of better stones than that. And what is \Valter doing?
Preaching, I suppose. I hope he won't want to preach to
me."
"Not very likely," said Raphael. "My uncle Walter is an
excellent hand at minding his own business."
"And that's an excellent thing. Well, are the girls married 2
You see, though I haven't come to look after you, I have found
out something about you. I know that Ralph and Wulterhad
each a. daughter."
"Neither of them is married. My sister, Claudia, is living
with me."
" Well, it is time they were married, if they're ever oing to.
And now," continued the old man, after a lon pull at his pipe,
" you asked me whether I had any family. I ave one child, a
dau liter, a very pretty girl, I am told, for I never saw her."
" ever saw her !"
" No. England 0t too hot for me just before she was born.
And I lost sight of er for years, and have only just got a trace
of her from your friend Mr. Langton."

"This is all very strange," said the Seraph. "How in the
world could Langton help you 'I "
"Because he knew the girl~because he knew the man who
saved her and protected her when her mother died on the Bath
Road, at the corner of Maidenhead Thicket."
"Why, you can't mean Isola. !" exclaimed the Seraph.
"Yes," said Stephen Langton, for Marmaduke did not reply ;
" Isola Chester is his daughter." .
" The devil ! " exclaimed Raphael.
"When can I see her '1 " said the old Wolf after a time.
"To-night !" said the Sera h promptly. " See her as soon as
you like. I had better just real; it to her beforehand; it will
take her so much by surprise."
" You are right. 1 have not thanked you, Ra hael, for taking
care of this child, though you could not know s e was a Brans-
combe. But I'll show my gratitude to your father as well as to
you. Mr. Langton has told me What happened to her; I know
you were not to blame ; and as for the scoundrel who took her
from school, it will be well for him if I never meet him. Now
let us go."
They had not far to walk to Isola's residence. The evening
was chilly; and she, curled in a vast easy chair in front of the
re, was warming her feet and sleepin reading a novel. The
ickering ame seemed endlessly to change the colours' of her
strange hair, and still stranger eyes. What a picture she was !
" Ho ! Seraph," she cried, " I'm glad to see you. Haven't you
run away with Baby Murll yeti"
" Be serious, Isola," he replied ; " I have something very
important to say to you."
She stretched her feet lazily at the re, and gave him a saucy
nod, as much as to say, " Go on."
"I suppose it has sometimes occurred to you that you had a
father 1 "
"Oh yes! But he's dead, I know. Drowned at sea, they told
me."
" They told you a falsehood. He is alive still. He has come
back to claim you."
"He shan't have me?" she said deantly. " He must not
have me, Raphael. Of course he's a brute, or he would not have
deserted my mother. You must hide me from him."
" Wait," he said ; " your father is a rough sort of a man, but I
should not call him a brute. And you know he has a right to
you. I could not consent to hide you from him. And there's
one more thing that is sure to please you, Isola; he seems to be
immenselv rich."
"Ha! ha!" she exclaimed gleefully, "that's charming. But
tell me, how did he nd me I"
" That's very curious," said the Seraph ; " he found you
through Stephen Langton."

" Dear old Stephen !"
"But there's something more curious still, Isola. You have
never heard, of course, that an uncle of mine, mv father's younger
brother, ran away to sea before I was born, and has never been
heard of since. Well, this is the very man. You and I are
cousins,"
" Oh, how delightful l" she said, springing from her chair and
pirouetting. " Dear me, to think that 1'm a Miss Branscombe !
Quite a heavy swell, Raphael. But I am pleased about that,
thats the truth."
" I should have been better leased ifbut never mind,

" Oh yes. You and Stephen will come too, won't you t"
" No; we should be in the way."
"But I am frightened," she urged. " Perhaps he'll be cruel
to me. Are you quite sure he is mv father?"
" Yes, you silly child. So don't be afraid ; he'll be as kind to
you as possible. He's longing to see you, and has been trying to
nd you for years. Good-bye ; I'm going to fetch him."
The Seraph left her. and rejoined his uncle.
"Is she ready!" asked Marmaduke, in a voice hoarse with
eagerness.
" Quite. Don't let us keep you. Good night."
Raphael and Stephen walked slowly away. The old Wolf
pushed open the hall-door, which stood ajar, and entered lsoln's
room. She had risen, and pushed back her chair, and stood in
front of the re. looking, in her quaint costume and fanciful
iewellery, with those changeful lights in her hair and e es, more
like a rincess of Fairyland than an ordinary young In . And
when armaduke Branscombe came looming through t e door-
way, gaunt, grizzled, impatient, she demurely dropped a graceful
curtsey, and said
" Good evening, papa."

HE Sinks of the Balagna were capped with snow. And s
eh , icier than all the snows of the Caucasus, had fallen
upon Fiordilisa, the Lily of Isola Rossa. And the little town
itself was melancholy; there was less gaiety in the less frequent
songs that arose under Chilina's mulberry tree : for the stranger
who had brought joy to Isola Rossa had now given it grief.

fewer and briefer. There was something forced and false in their
tone. They 'arred upon the ear of love. Raphael was not a
end; he h simply great power of enjoying the present, t
ower of forgetting the past. What of the future? We it
id not troub e him much. He was a Pyrrhonist as to the far
future, while of the immediate future he took no count. He could
sup well and sleep well, though to be called in the greyest, chil-
liest hours of morning to ght a duel. He could utterly forget
a man killed or a woman ruined. And he could enjoy the pre
sent with a boyish and poetic glee, with a guiety and insoucianc:
which seemed dreadl'ul to those who knew him best. Students
of human nature will not readily declare such a temperament
impossible. Critics will doubtless declare him a monstera
mere novelist's Frankenstein. I know the man.
Raphael occasionally reected with what he called seriousness
on the position in which he found himself. It was curious, if not
awkward. He was married to Fiordilisa ; he loved her with the
urest love of which he was capable ; he had spent with her the
happiest da s of his life. But now that, having left Isola Rossa
far behind, e had re-entered London's strong and vivid life, he
felt a curious reluctance to return to the idyl of that Corsican
seashore. Was it indeed true that he had been there'l Was the
Fantasia a real barque, or " a painted ship upon a painted ocean 'l "

sea~beach, veined with red coralsuch a noble old patriarch as
Angelo Montaltiabove all, such a delicious creature, pure in
her maidenhood as Eve in Eden, as Fiordilisa'l Or was it all a
vision? Was Fiordilisa a phantom, a myth, like the fair-haired
Lilith, the rst wife of Adam? Verin that icture of the mid-
sea island seemed much like a dream. But t e Seraph had cer-
tain bills of jewellers and others to show that it was not altogether
visionary ; and therefore he could not esca e from the undoubtful
conviction that there existed a person wit a right to be called
Fiordilisa Branscombe. Strange mixture of language between the
liquid South and the harsh and guttural North.
The Seraph, at intervals, wished himself back at Isola Rom-
in the quaint Cass. Montalti, living a life of the heroic age, with
his Nausicaa to serve him with goat's esh and fruit and wine,
and in due time to place in his arms a younv Branscombe in
whom the blood of the famous races commingler . But then, he
was very jolly where he was ; he could not bring himself to quit
the fatal fascinations of London. Besides, he had his sister
Claudia to look after, and he felt a strong misgiving that there
would be hard work there. Moreover, he had a strange amorous
hunger for that pretty little plump Anne Page, of whom he deemed
himself defrauded by Humhrey )Iortill. And he felt a strong
impulse to revenge himse on the said Humphrey Morll by

means of his wife. Wherefore evil predominated over good in
his mental processes.
And my lust chapter's discovery of course increased the chances
against our poor little F iordilisa. There was a new uncle on the
scene, an "uncle from India," as the French novelists put it.
What was the grim old unexpected Wolf going to do with his
doubloons and his diamonds and his daughter?
The Seraph, fond of eventful living, could not conceal from
himself the fact that this abrupt apparition was what they call
in dull country society "a great acquisition." Here was a man
who openly announced his intention of reinstating Devil Bruns-
combe in his ancestral acresa man who carried about with him
a box full of sapphires as big as eggs. and gold coins that resem-
bled cheese-platesa man who owed a heavy debt of revenge
to poor Farmer Pringle, and a heavy debt of gratitude to him,
the Seraph. Hang it ! he must stop and see it out.
This is the s ecies of reasoning wherewith Raphael Bram-
combe blockedt e swift bowlingv of remorse. Meanwhile, what
where they doing at Isola Rossa'l Ah, the Lily was fading. She
kept up u'oniaufully. None ever heard from her lip a word of
complaint ; none ever saw a tear in her beautiful eye. A true
woman, true and pure, and loving and believing, this little Cor-
sican endured marlyrdom for her recreant husband. To her the
ties of civilisation were incomprehensible. She was wearily per~
plexed by her husband's strange absence ; and as it lengthened,
she began to believe he never would return ; but the idea of his
basely dcserting her would not enter her mind. Had he not,
this wise man of the World, been fool enough to send her chilly
apologetic lettershad he become suddenly silentshe would
have believed him dead, and gone to her grave in that faith.
But th0se apologetic letters, which in time (as the Seraph got
tired) ceased altogether, \vere merely an enigma. to her. And
when at length no news came, she fadednothing more.
But Angelo Montulti understood better. He came, slowly and
ainfullv, to the conclusion that Ra hael Branscombe was a vil-
lhin. Of this conviction nothing di he say to any man; but in
the midnight solitude he agouised over the terrible blunder he
had made in giving this darling of his. this cherished girl, the
last of the Montalti, the sweetest ower of the race. to a wander-
ing Englishman, of whom he knew nothing. What a fool be

Would be a sad ending to the Montalti. Thus soliloquised
venerable Angelo, in his chamber, alone.
Marc Antonio had gone round to Ajaccio in the Fantasia to
meet the Marseilles steamer for letters. The beautiful barque
came merrily round the point into the phosphorescent bay. All
lsola Rossa was awaiting it that evening. All the little town was
silently sympathetic with the grief of the Montalti. Chilina Was
there, of course, awaiting her husband. And tall old Angelo had

his arm. Ah me, she leaned too lightly.
There was no letter.
Angelo and his grand-daughter returned slowly to the Casa
Monialti. The sun was setting over that sapphire sea in beauty
that would foil the words of Shelley or the colours of Titian.

a cause so commonplace as that the post had brought no letter.
But let me ask my reader whether he has not known the two
commonphice words, 110 letter, involve a tragedy?
Angelo Montalti sat down to supper. Fiordiiisa did not allow
her hitter misery to interfere with her duties. Was she not a
Corsican, like Vittoria Malaspina'l She served her grandfather
at table, in the primitive old fashion ; and brought him the viands
and the wine which he loved; and made no moan, though the
anguish of a lost love gnawed her innocent breast. But later in
the awning, just before they went to bed, she said, in a low, con-
strained Voice
"Will he ever come back, grandfather 'l "
" I do not know, my ower," replied the old man.
"Oh I hope he will," she said"I hope he will. Would he
not love his baby, grandfather, as you love me '1"
In her room that night Fiordilisa knelt before a picture of the
Madonna, and confessed to the Virgin Mother a grief which yet
she had scarcely confessed to herself. Ave Maria! Beautiful
worship, which Doctors Colenso and Cumming, together with
Archbisho Longley and Mr. Spnrgeon, unite to assure me is
wicked. gVicked l Possibly. Better perchance worship the
Virgin Mother than Mammon or Belial, each of whom has

could this crushed lily so titly tell her sorrow as to her who bore
upon her breast the Man of Sorrowsto her who knew, with
a knpwledge shared by no other creature, that God had become

However, as our poor darling Fiordilisa was a good Catholic,
she needs no excuse. She helOnged to a Faith with which Reason
has never entered into partnershipthe only lasting kind of
Faith, by the way. And she knelt before her pictureand she
told the Lady of Galilee what she might have told her mother,
had a mother's ever-loving breast been vouchsafed to Fiordilisa
in her trouble, that she knew not where her husband was, or
whether ever she should see him again, and that there moved
within her bosom a young life that belonged to him as well as
her. And oh ! how fervently those young pure lips prayed that
Raphael might soon return, to embrace his child ! "r ell

Well for her that in her dreams she can It see that recrem t
Raphael. Well for her indeed that she cannot behold the interior
of the adjacent room, where Angelo Montalti holds sleepless
counsel with himself.
Angelo Montalti knew nothing of the world beyond Corsica.
He was a thorough islander of that marvellously romantic island.
Through his long life he had never known fear or shame, he had
never uttered an untruth, he had never even contemplated the
possibility of doing a deed of dishonour. More than this : I
doubt if Angelo Montalti had ever heard a falsehood. You see,
he must be excused; he lived in an uncivilised country. The
lie is a noble invention ; they are to be pitied. doubtless, to whom
it is unfamiliar ; but it would be unfair to blame them.
There is good old blood in Corsica. The Buonapartes, com-
aratively novi homines, seem to have been there A.D. 947, and
Ir. Bertrand Payne can only trace the progenitors of Millais the
painter back to I 3 3 1. For me, I can trace no farther than Ralph

the ontalti, though not so preposteroust antique, belonged to
a good old racea race among whom brave men and chaste

found himself face to face with a. terrible event. He ll'ld accepted

Angelo, mung by a. manly agony, and more than paternal pity

184 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
He was bowed down by a double grief. It was sad that the
Montalti should be thus insulted -that the pure old race should
end disgracefully. But it was even more sad that Fiordilisa,
that sweet mixture of gaiety and gentleness, that purest, most
loving of women, should die of grief. Nothing less could happen
to her, Angelo Montalti knew well. Her love was herself ; w en
it died, she also must die. The old man foresaw this without
question; he foresaw himself, bereaved of his daughter, wander-
ing vaguely, a dagger in his breast, over realms which were as
yet mere names to him, seeking for revenge on Raphael Brans-
combe. And the thought came suddenly upon him, lling him
with pain
" Shall I live to do it?"
And he also kneltnot to pray, but to vowand he vowed
that he would live to take Vengeance on Raphael Branscombe.
There was no if in that vow. The future for him had assumed
certainty.
He unlocked a quaint cabinet, of some wood blackened with
age. He took down, one after another, curious weapons, that
seemed to belong to the Middle Ages. One after another he
examined them carefullyat last he seized a dagger with a long
sharp blade of bluest steel, on which were engraved some strange
Arabic characters. The handle was a cross of ivory, on which
shone a plain silver plate. This weapon Angelo Montalti selected,
returnin" the others to their places.
Then lie took from a shelf in the cabinet a corrosive liquid
and an engraver's tool, and on the silver plate which adorned the
handle of the dagger he cut three wordstwenty-two letters. It
was a careful and a painful work. But Angelo Montalti grudged
neither care nor pain for the purpose before him.
It is hard to describe the way of life which became the rule
with Fiordilisa and her grandfather at this time. The old man
was mellowed by age into the ripeness of Nestor. He was in-
capable of hasty conclusions. He was incapable of injustice. He
had, moreover, the old man's power of prevision. He saw that
a brief time must infallibly show the truth. And he had that
tenderness of great age to girlish youth which Landor nobly
showed in his Heroic Idyls, in the relation of Laertes to Agatha.
To a very old man there is nothing more touching than a dainty
oung girl. The one is a nished product of the race : the other
1s its freshest bud of promise. Angelo Montalti did his utmost
to conceal from the beautiful child whom he ltved the erce
thirst for revenge which had seized u on himthe result of an
unalterable conviction that Raphae deserved his vengeance.
He was kind to her with an old man's kindness. They wandered

There it lay waitingfor a freight that might never come. And
Fiurdilisa waited also; waited with that divine patience and
childlike faith which God has given to women, and which ought
to paralyse the man who ventures to deceive them. She hid the
anguish in her bosom; she faded, poor childshe could not
help it; but even to her grandfather she made no complaint of
Raphael, but only asked, in the supreme moments of sorrow
" Will he come back soon .9 " .
The stern old Corsican knew not how to replyto this sad
questioning.
CHAPTER XXI.
THREE LOVE srrnas.
CLAUDIA BRANSCOM BE, rejected abruptly by Stephen
Langton, felt within her a feminine determination to marry
somebody. Sir Arthur Willesden, she thought, was at her ser-
vice. So, when this impertiuent boy left her, she became kinder
to the baronet, who thereupon presumed immensely. Sir Arthur
was a man so utterl devoid of sensitiveness that it took much
to move him ; of all delicate shades of human feeling he was as
ignorant as a blind man of colours; but if he did get an idea
into his head he carried it out with that line, obstinate, unreason-
ing ferocity with which a bull butts at a young lady's scarlet
etticoat, under the impression apparently that it is a personal
msnlt to himself.
N ow, my feminine readers will, I trust, understand that the
Panther had a somewhat difcult business in making this hurlv
baronet believe that she really did like him a little. I wish I
had the delicate hand to thoroughly work out this part of the
affair. It is such a nice hit of comedy. Here's the ery Claudia
anxious to make the stolid Sir Arthur believe that she loves him.
He, poor fellow, though dull enough to be member for Stamford,
has sufcient wit to see that she ought not to love him. Besides,
there's another element. He can't marry her. The Hebrew-s
(dear descendants of Abraham) only permit him to exist on con-
dition of his making a good marriage. Claudia Branseombe has
nothing.
Now, if you'll get any generous manager of a theatre to pay
for pure comedy, I'll work this little situation out in three acts,
and put it on the stage. But I can't afford that expenditure
of brain for a mere novel. I must merely narrate results. A
ame being lplayed between the Panther and the Baronet, we
now where ay the skill. If the Destinies gave the antagonists

anything like equal cards, we know whose must be the victory.
But the Destinies didn't. They gave the baronet the ace of trumps.
For when a game is played between a man and a woman, the man
of necessity holds the ace of trumps-~that card invincible being
his sex. Indeed, the moment the game begins, it is lost by the
female layer. She can't win. She draws the game about once
in a. mil enninm.
Claudia lost. Claudia, with all her beauty, all her experience,
all her dauntlessness, all her wit, lost the game to this perfumed
Assyrianthis miserable melange of Poole and Buckmaster and
Lincoln and Bennett and J ouvin and Atkinson and Truett, and
God knows whom else. Lost! to this animal. Oh! if Raphael
could have known in time. Raphael was not a herosomething
very different, indeed ; but at the critical point of this desperate
damnable game, he would not have thought twice before killing
Sir Arthur Willesden.
Meanwhile, what was Raphael doing? He was not introducing
the old Wolf, his uncle, to the more exclusive regions of aristo-
cratic society. The Wolf did not want that sort of thing, and
would not have had it at any price. The Wolf had devoted him-
self to his daughter Isola.
Her arch " Good evening, papa," had been sufcient introduc-
tion. The Wolf, mind you, was of gentle blood; and, like our
old friend Odysseus, he had seen the world, city and country,
palace and hovel princess and wench ; and wide experience had
given pliancy to his mind ; and he could appreciate and enjoy the
beauty, the quaintness, the serpentine exile movement, the
uniqueness of his daughter lsola. So the rough old boy buried
himself in her muage, and monopolised her. He declined
Stephen's offer of quarters with him in Jermyn Street. He
brought his weighty oaken casket, and much other luggage, which
came later by the Plymouth waggon, to Isola's abode. 'l he little
girl was bored, but she did her duty well. She shut her door
resolutely to all admirers ; she excluded Raphael, whom she held
in the deepest reverence as her saviour, and Stephen, whom (this
in strict confidence) she loved; and she did her girlish best to
rejoice the heart of this rugged old villain of a father who had
inst turned up to claim her, and to enrich her. Do her justice,
beg. She did not care overmuch about his gems and gold,
diamonds and doubloons, sapphires and opals. She liked the
idea of them, of course. What woman does not delight in adorn-
ment? The apple with which Satan tempted Eve was ajewelled
fruit, I suspect. But what delighted Isola above all things was
his love. It was true fatherly love: had there been no other
proof, it might have shown his relationship. The old Wolf had
been doing cruel and wicked and lustful things all his life. I
will not dele this page with any deed of his. And yet he came
home to look for his daughter; and somewhere in his inty old
heart there was a spring of love that burst out towards her. And

now he would have cut his own rascally old throat if he had
thought it would do her any good. It was supreme and innite
liap iness to him to sit in front of the re in that room, where
we rst saw lsola, while she, strangely charming, sat lightly on
his massive knee, and passed her tiny slender ngers thron 11 his
mighty matted beard, and lavished upon him a dang ter's
en enrments.
Wisely, he asked her no questions of the past. Had he done
so, she would have told him truth. But he did not know how
far truth would pain her, so he left her alone. Love taught him
delicacy. What will not love teach as instantaneously as light
ningl He caught her to his bosom, this stern old wanderer; he
treated her with loving tenderness; he tried his utmost to give
her ha piness. How to do this was the problem which he could
not so ve. It was the only point on which he ventured to
question her.
" How can I make you happy, Isola ? " he would ask.
"0 apa !" she would exclaim, " am I not happy enough with
you? hat more can Iwantl I'll pull your beard if you tease me."
And her fairy hands, white as snowakes, would weave them-
selves into the vast waves of that noble beard, the growth of
realms where razors are not known.
"But you will want to marry some day, my child," the old
Wolf would say. " You are very young, I know ; but youth will
not last for ever, and I shan't last for ever either. And why
shouldn't I nd you a husband you could love i "
" There is but one man I will ever marry, papa," she said one
day, " and I know he will not marry me : so why say any more
about it 'l"
" Tell me who he is," said the Wolf sternly.
" Never, sir, if you talk like that. Why, you don't surely think
you're going to frighten a Branscombe !" she exclaimed, springing
from her seat, and clap ing her hands deli htedly.
" Well, I really should like to know who{lie is," said her father,
whom her merry antics soothed and fasoinated.
"Should you? I suppose, sir, you think you'd frighten him
into marrying me. But I should not wish for a husband on
those terms." -
" I won't say a word to him, if you'll only tell me, Isola"
" And I won't tell you, papa. Why, you'd always, when I
happened to be at all out of spirits, be laughing at me for being
s oons upon him. No; he doesn't care twopence about this
0 ild, and this child is a little too roud to go down on her
marrow-bones and say, ' Please, Mr. go-and-So, marry me, and
I'll always be a ve obedient wife.' If I could do anything that
would make himrlove me, I'd do it, though I died the next
minute. I'd put my hand into that re to save him from trouble.
But he doesn t care for me, papa, so I may as well shut up."
Isola moderated her slang somewhat, inasmuch as her father's

long absence abroad had rendered him unacquainted with the
more recent niceties of " young English."
The old Wolf could not, from his daughter's language, ascer-
tain who was the man whom she loved. But being a sagacious
old Wolf, he thought that in process of time he might discover
it from her manner to the few persons whom at this time she
began to readmit. He heartily hoped it was her cousin Raphael,
for whom, as her deliverer from a miserable life, she had a strong
affection. Isola had been wont to tener salon after a pleasant lax
fashion of her own, and she resumed the habit for a short time
after her father's return; but by and by she declared herself tired
of it, and cared to see nobodv save the Seraph and Stephen.
Subtle as she was, Marmaduke Branscombe did not take long to
decide that it was Stephen whom his daughter loved.
Stephen, of course, aid no visits to the Panther now. And
he was, therefore, glad) to spend an hour occasionally in Isola's
drawing-room. He greatly delighted in this strange girl. To
his poetic, dreamy nature, her romantic circumstances gave her
an additional charm. There seemed some destined connection
between her and himself. Her rare and singular beauty, her
oddities of costume and language, lent her an attraction.
Isola had given up "scamandering." She spent her evenings
guietly at home with her father, except when she declared a
inner at Richmond or Hampton or Greenwich necessary to dis-
pel her dulness. The old Wolf always took her wherever she
wanted to go, and lavished upon her every luxury wealth could
procure ; but preferred a quiet dinner at home, and any quantity
of old Jamaica and negrohead afterwards. He encouraged his
nephew and Stephen to drop in unceremoniously, either to dine,
or to pass the evening, or both. Stephen came often. Raphael
was a much rarer visitor.
One evening the Seraph met his friend about ve, and proposed
goin over to see if Isola would give them some dinner.
" 've got two or three things on my mind, Langton," he said.
" I'm in no mood for the Club ; I can be as surly as I like in the'
company of m dear uncle, Marmaduke. who is a surly old beggar
himself. An you can amuse the child.'I
" How about his aying your father's debts l " asked Stephen.
" Is that to come o' ' "
" Oh yes ! The old gentleman's expected in London in about
a week. There'll be a great gathering of the clan. I wish it was
over. I want to be off."
" Where are you going so suddenly?"
"I've only one reason for not telling you, my dear fellow.
which is that if anybody asks you, you can say you don't know."
" Well, I hope I shan't lose on for long. You're my guide,
philosopher, and friend. I 'sh. ll be all at sea without you. '

They went to Isola's re=idence, and found the Wolf smokin
as usual, in an easy chair by the re. All the mare'chale an

" Yes," said the Sera h, "we came here purposely to dine, and

" Ha, ha ! We'll brew a mighty bowl of punch. I bought a
great china unch-bowl a day or two a o; it holds twelve gal-
lons. That'l be enough for us, I guess.
" Rather," said Raphael.
" Have you given notice to all those confounded lawyers that

" 'es," answered the Seraph. "I set a solicitor to work a
week ago. All the claims will be ready in due time."
" You can't guess how much there is, I suppose 'l "
" About twenty-ve thousand, besides the mortgages."
" And they're forty-ve, you told me," said the Wolf. "Seventy
thousand, more or less. It's not much."
" Egad, I think it's a good deal," remarked Raphael. "Where
the deuce it has all ne puzzles me."
"Well, luckily don't think it much. I paid more than
double into Coutts's yesterday," said the Wolf. "We shall be
ready for the rascals. I think, when they meet, I shall kick
them all round, if they charge it in their bills."
He laughed ferociously. He evidently regarded a lawyer as
splmethiug far worse than a brigand or a pirate. He was right, I

"I have set some of my people on the track of a sooundrel I

" The devil! Where is the fellow? What do you mean to

"He's in En land. I don't know as yet what I shall do.
Hist ! here's Iso a."
She entered. In her wealth of hair lay a circlet of earls, and
a. loose earl necklace fell with a graceful curve into lier bosom.
A low ress of light blue, soft and devoid of rustle, was set off
with knots of amber ribbon. Her bright eyes brightened more
when she saw her friends ; she ut out one little hand to Raphael,
the other to Stephen ; she lang ed merrily and said
"Oh, how glad I am ! So on are come to dinner."
To dinner they went. Iso a's dinners were now of a mixed

order. She was a dainty, delicate little bird, and liked to peck
at two or three particularly nice things, just as a blackbird peeks
at the cherries and peaches, and liked therewith a glass or two
of some light fragrant s arkling wine. But the Wolf was a
ponderons portentous fee er, a drinker of mighty draughts and
strong. Isola eating her sweet-bread and sipping her Moselle,
while her father devoured sirloin or steak, and drank great
draughts of old ale, made u a curious contrast. The Seraph
"as Wont to remark that at t is table one could get any sort of
dinner.
After dinner lsola went away to her drawing-room, and sang a
song or two in rippling merry fashion, for her own delectation.
"O pescator dell onda!" came rst; and then some merry,
quaint chanson, with a refrain of " Larirettelarira ; " and then a
romance of Madrid by Alfred de Musset; and then, in sudden
change to melancholy-
" But now they are moaning
On ilka green loaming ;
The Flowers of the Forest
Are a' wede awa."
She had no marvellous vocal organ, this Isola ; she had none of
the Panther's passion and power; but she had a sweet voice, and
a auick ear for all the innumerable nuances of song. From the
sa pathos of Jane Elliot of Minto's tearful ballad to the old
Frenchman's
" Qa done, mignonne, vien-t'-en.,
Et m'tend
Ta bouchette coraline "
the transition for her was easy and natural.
She wiled awa an indolent half hour at the piano; then,
curling her little orni in her habitual fashion in a vast easy-chair,
she was soon fast asleep over a novel.
Meanwhile the Wolf and his guests drank port wine. Marma
duke Branscombe had ransacked the cellars of the cit wine-
merchants for stuff of the rioht sort ; and as he scattered his gold
lavishly, he had got what he wanted. A magnum of Chateau
Margaux just sufced to cool the port, and then they went to claim
co'ee of Isola. The little beauty was fast asleep in her chair ;
and, when she awoke, looked round upon her father and his
friends with an expression of drowsy amazement that was very
comical.
By and by Marmaduke Branscombe produced his mighty
unch-bowl, and would have breWed punch therein. But
a hael convinced him of the impossibility of doing justice m
sue a beverage; so a smaller vessel was brought, which, how-
ever, would hold uite enou h to intoxicate three ordinary

preparing the fragrant fascinating beverage. Stephen recollected
iis clerical friend's punch at the Chapter Coti'ee - house, and
thought he was predestined to headache from that especial
lil uid.
l"Ay," growled the Wolf, when Isola had left them "to get
mops and brooms by themselves." "Ay, I have found that
young Pringle. I can't make up my mind what to do with
1m." -
"Better leave him alone," said the Seraph.
" I'll be hanged if I do. But he can't get awayhe's watched
and there's no hurry. We'll settle with those cursed lawyers
rst."
" What is Pringle doing?"
" He's turned carrier. Comes twice a week to London with a
waggon." '
" Are you sure it is the man i"
"Quite sure," said Marmaduke. "He's been traced from the
time you thrashed him at Brighton. My people don't make
mistakes."
"I suppose we mustn't ask who your people are," said Ste-
en.
" You may "1'," he said. "They're people who know their
work, and do it. Look here."
He took from his pocket a small silver whistle. The room in
which they sat was on the ground-oor, fronting the street. The
Wolf opened the shutters, lifted the window, and blew a shrill
call u on this whistle.
" e shall have the new police here," said the Seraph.
Scarcely two minutes had elapsed when the window was opened
farther from the outside, and a very ruanly head was intruded.
The Wolf made some brief remark in a foreign language. The
fellow shut the window and went away.
" You see I am well attended to," said Marmaduke.
"I ho you're not engaged in any awful conspiracv to de-
throne is Ma'estv, or rob the Bank of England, or blow up
the Houses of arliament, or set the Thames on re," said the
Seraph.
" N o," replied his uncle. "My work is pretty Well over. The
people whom I employ at present have seen some sharp service,
ut they have done almost all I want them to do."
"I have three things to do," he resumed. "When they are
done I don't care much what happens to me. I have to set Ralph
straight ; that's very simple work. I have to unish that fellow
Pringle. And I have to see Isola happily sett ed. When those
things are done, I'll just go uietly into a corner, and drink rum
and smoke negrohead till I ie."
" But why are you in any hurry to see Isola settled? " urged
Raphael. " She is very happy with you."
" No, she is not. She is a good little thing, and makes believe
to be happy extremely well; but she would be a deal happier

married to a man she loved. And I could make him rich. He
might live like a prince, if he liked. I wish you and she fancied
one another, Raphael."
" Cousins shouldn't marry," said Stephen with a laugh. " So
they saybut it's a mistake. If you've a good breed, it doesn't
want crossing." '
"It was a fortunate thing for me, Mr. Langton, that we met
that night on the Thicket, though, no doubt, I should have learnt
all about Isola from Raphael in time. But you and I were bound
to meet."
" I am very glad we did," said Stephen.
When Raphael and his friend were walking homewards, arm-
in-arm, under a frosty crescent moon, the former said-
"He wants you to marry Isola, Langton. Why not? She's
oung, and exquisitely beautiful, and rich. AndI think she
oves you. Anne Page is lost to you; and as for my sister, if
she would have you, she is too old. But Claudia will not
marry."
Stephen made an inquiring remark to Raphael, almost in a
Whisper.
"Never, by Heaven! " said the Sera h.
Now, whether it was to Isola or glandia Stephen's question
referred, must as yet~remain a mystery. Or, perchance, it had
reference to neither.
"Do you think that uncle of yours will murder Pringle'l"
asked Stephen.
"Likely enough. He doesn't look the man to stick at any-
thing. It was very curious that on should ick him up; but
Destiny has evidently determine that you s all be mixed up
with our affairs. From the day your amiable old grandfather
brought you over to Kingsleat you have been drawn into the
current. I can't congratulate ou."
" Well," replied Stephen, " 've got some two thousand a year
out of your family; and if you are right in sup osing the old
gentleman wants me to marry Isola, there's a p 'gious fortune
to be had without trouble."
" Which you won't take, I suppose ? "
" You can easily guess a few of the considerations which would
cause any man to hesitate."
" Why," said the Seraph, with a laugh, " you don't know
where the old boy got his money. I suspect he didn't hesitate.
However, I don't think my respected father will hesitate either,
when it comes to paying his de ts and making him Branscombe
of Branscombe again."
" That's not all," said Ste hen. " Have you ever been in love 1 "
"Have I! I don't thin I was ever out of it. I've had no
end of grand assions. And I'm in love now with Baby Morll,
as Isola calls 1er;by the way, if you make Isola Mrs. Langton,
you must cure her of slang."

THREE LOVE AFFAIRS. I93
They had strayed from their homeward path, and had uncon-
sciously reached Waterloo Bridge. Any bridge over the Thames
is a pleasant place to lounge on a moonlight nightwhen the
misty radiance falls upon the silent city and shadowy stream.
Unluckily, the arapets of Waterloo are ridiculously high. If I
remember right y, a Bazotian baronet wanted those of beautiful
Westminster Bridge heightened, for the purpose of rendering
suicide difcult ! That's legislating for the minority with a ven-
geance.
The Seraph and his friend had mounted on one of the stone
seats or steps, and were looking over the parapet upon the royal
river, smoking thoughtfully.
" There must be a dierence, Branscombe," said Stephen at
length, " between your love and mine. I loved Anne Page, you
know. I love her still. I thought I wanted to have revenge on
Humphrey ; but now my feeling towards her is such that I would
implore you not to tempt herif I thought my eloquence would
move on. But I have never felt what I imagine to be love for
anybody else. I had an ambitionwhich I don't mind c0nden~
tially confessing to youto teach your sister that I am not a mere
boy, to pet and play with ; and as to little Isolawhy, she fasci-
nates and delights me as if she were a fairyI can hardly think
of her as a woman."
"She isn't; she's a Branscombe. There'd be some truth in
applying Walpole's or some fellow's saying to us: The human
race should be divided into Men, Women, and Branscombcs. But
how did your laudable ambition get on with the Panther? Did
she scratch 'l"
" I don't think I should tell you."
"All right," said the Seraph. "But, look here. My worshi -
ful uncle, for reasons which he does not assign, is going to sett e
the business with my father's creditors down at Idlechester. It
will be convenient, in some respects. The estates are all there-
about, and a good many of the mortgagees are local people : and
Drax, who is our agent, wouldn't like to be long in town. We're
ing to have a grand affair, I assure you; the whole of the Half
oon Hotel has been engaged for our especial use. So there'll
be plenty of room for you, and you must come down and look on.
It will he as good as a play."
" 1 shall be in the way," urged Stephen.
"Not a bit of it. My dear fellow, I should be as dull as a
catalogue without you. Besides, I'm going abroad directly after-
wards, and mayn't see you again for an age. We shall all be
there ; my father, my two uncles, Claudia, Winifred, Isola. And
all the townspeople, from the Bishop downwards, will go down
on their knees to us, now that we have come into our fortune ; and
our creditors will be plaguy polite, though they've been hunting
us with sheris' ofcers for years. It will be great fun, Langton."
"Well," said Stephen, "I suppose I may as Well go down

with you. Of course it will amuse me very much ; but a stranger
seems always in the way when a family party is assembled on
business."
"You're not a stranger. You belong to us. You have come
among us, and can't extricate yourself. And you're safe to marry
a Branscombe. By Jove ! it will be Winifred, I daresay, as you
don't relish either of the others."
Ste hen Langton laughed, and suggested turning homeward.
The c ock of St. Paul's struck two, and a hundred other clocks
gave similar evidence of the ight of time. Dr. Young ought to
have been there to moralise, in a long night-shirt, as I remember
seeing him depicted in my boyhood in the frontis iece to his
" Night Thoughts "a book which, thank Heaven, have never
seen since. And a few seconds after the chronometric clangour
had subsided, a sudden rocket ashed upwards from somewhere
near the great Cathedral's sombre dome, leaving a momentary
trail of light, and descending in a shower of blue and crimson
and golden globes. It was not a meteor : they heard the hissing
sound of its ascent.
"That's queer," said the Seraph. " Fireworks in London !
Peel's new police must be asleep."
They strolled westward, and parted at Stephen's door, Raphael
remarking
" Then you'll come. We'll go down together. My father and
uncle can take care of the girls."
Stephen Langton gave an hour to reection when he was
alone. He liked to reect luxuriously, by his dressing'room re,
in loose costume, with a cigar. He was right, I think. When vou
throw off the attire which society demands of you, you iso ate
yourself, render yourself independent, become quite a different
being. If we may judge by analogy from the freedom a man
feels when he gets rid of coats and waistcoats and other gear,
what a wondrous liberty the spirit or soul, or whatever you like
to call itthe Egowill experience when it throws off the body
with which it was clothed, without being asked whether it liked
the pattern, and which is so often is confounded mist ! Besides,
when one has to wear that corporeal clothing till it gets shabby,
and ragged, and past all patching from the sartorial empirics who
write MD. and M.R.C.S. after their names, how great will be the
luxury of undressing !
" I certainly am drawn in among these Branscombes very
queerly," reected Stephen. " First, Mr. Page takes a fancy to
me, then Claudia ; then that perfectly unintelligible Seraph deter-
mines that we shall be cronies; then I get intimate with Isola,
who certainly is a nice child; then I pick up her father at an .
out-of-the-way inn, where I never intend to go. I'll be hanged
if it isn't odd. I wonder if they have an more missing relations
for me to discover. I shall be sure to rep upon them, if there
are. I'll ask Raphael to-morrow.

"And what the deuce am I to do? I've promised to 0 down

" 'Gad, 1'1 go to bed."
He carried out that wise resolve, and did not ring for his
brandy and soda till noon.
As to the Seraph, he also reected. He was rather dissatised
with himself. This little Anne Morll had, somehow, got a hold
upon him. He had sub'ugated her without much diicult ; but
now she had caught ho d of him. This was absurd, unp 'loso-
phic, contrary to the law of his life. Although he looked forward
with much ex ectation of amusement to the ldlechester gather-
ing, he really did not like the notion of suspending his irtation
with hern irtation rendered facile by her intimacy with
Claudia. But, bah! this was very absurd. He couldn't take
her with him, clearly. 'Twould be hardly the thing to ask Mor-
ll for the loan of his wife for a week or two. Still, migbtn't
Morll be invited to the gathering, by reason of his assumed
legal knowledge, and asked to bring his wife, who was, after
all, half a Branscombe'! Raphael, amused at his own weakness,
determined to mention this to his uncle Marmaduke. ~
So he dropt in upon that gentleman at about eleven. Isola
"as not et down; she was dressing, according to her maid's
report. he old Wolf, whose early habits adhered to him even
in London, had gone out, and had not returned. The Seraph sat
down, and waited.
" What were you doing on Waterloo Bridge last night?" asked
the Wolf when he entered, with a grim noiseless laugh, which
seemed to be transacted low in his chest.
" How did you know we were there, may I ask 1 "
" Oh, I get plenty of news brought me. Did you notice any-
thing unusual ? "
"Well," replied the Seraph, "as you know we were there~ I
suppose you know what we saw. Was it you who were letting otl'
reworks 7" I
" Only a signal. It was odd you should be there to see it. How-
ever, it doesn't matter. What news brings you here so early '1"
"No news. Only I have been thinking Morll and his wife
may as well meet us at Idlechester; so I came to suggest it."
Now, the old Wolf, whose half-sister, Algernon Page's wife,
had been born after he ran away to sea, had not been much
interested by what he heard of this niece of his; except one
point, gathered from Isola's laughing gossi , that Raphael was
"spoons " upon her. This amused him. e gave the Seraph a
knowing look, and said
## p. 196 (#206) ############################################
196 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
"All riht, my boy; you don't want your irtation interrupted,
I see. I'll ask them."
Humphrey Mortill promised to come, of course.
He foresaw possible business from the connection. He liked
the idea of re-appearing in Idlechester with the Branscombes in
the ush of their unexpected and most marvellous prosperi .
He thought only~ of himself; all the rest of the world was su -
servient to him, the hard-working law student, soon to be a rising
barrister, with Parliament and the Attorney-Generaiship not far
ahead, and the woolsack in the divine distance. His was the
right temperament for a successful lawyer.
"A hard heart and a. strong stomach," said Talle and, or
somebody, "will carry you happily through the wor d." The
Irishman says, "A light heart and a thin pair of breeches."
Some of those sayings attributed to Charles Maurice de Talley-
rand-Prigord are as full of concentrated pabulum as Prigord
piesand about as wholesome.
Raphael, when he reected on Marmaduke's acquaintance with
his stroll on the bridge, and on his claim to the midnight pyro-
techny, thought to himself that a deucedly ueer melodramatic
uncle had turned up. "And now," he sai to himself, "he's
going to take us all down to Idlechester, and bring us into the
same inn, and invite our friends and enemies to meet us. What
if he means to do some deed of horror! A massacre of the inno-
centsan utter destruction of all the creditors and their attendant
lawyerswould have a ne effect. Just the way the Sultan
pitched into the Janissaries the other day. I'm sure I don't
mind, if it takes the old Wolf's fancy. It would make the papers
readable for at least a'week ; and, by Heaven, that would be an
enormous blessing. There's nothing in them now, except the
howlings of a lot of unmitigated idiots who want Reform."
Thus reected the unenlightened Seraph, who thought politics
the depth of babyish silliness. But shortly the papers contained
a short announcement which surprised a good many people, and
interested even him, videlicet :
"Ralph Branscombe, Es uire, of Branscombe, has arriVed at
the Clarendon Hotel, from t e Continent."

or from somebody else, could scarcel ' be very dull ; not to men-

relation of that mighty potentate, the Duke of Axminster, Lord
Lieutenant of the County, was the highest of High Churchmcn.
Socio-theologic dis utes were not unusual in this sacerdotal
vicinage; Bisho ythese an episcopal Gallic, who cared pre-

left in peace, often desired translation to some see in which there
was a slighter infusion of hot water.

thing. People who wouldn't have been seen in the Rope Walk
of Riverdale gossiped with one another in the booksellers' and
drapers' shops of Idlechester High Street. It was quite a
fashionable lounge indeed. You might see the Duchess of As-
minster, a very retty girl in those days, of whom the severest
criticism I ever card was that she hadn't pride enough to match
the Duke, walking along the not too am le pavement with Mrs.
Bythesea or Lady Hinton Powys. An all manner of pleasant
ladylike dissipations came off at Idlechester. Croquet and the
Social Science Association had not been invented; Jaques of
Hatton Garden, Brougham and Vaux (hall), had not entered on
their lofty career as purveyors of feminine amusement. But
there were plenty of xtures at Idlechester, notwithstanding. It
was a city in which pretty girls got married with alarming
rapidity. It was a city whose picnics, balls, archery meetings,
and other pleasant arrangements for irtation, were a caution.
But I dlechester, never dull, grew wonderfully excited in expec-
tation of the coming of the Branscombes. Marmaduke Brains-
combe, whom his daughter Isola rightly described as "a wary old
card," took all possible precautions to prevent the general public
from knowing anything about the family assembly. But he had
to engage the Half Moon Hotel; and what old Winslow knew
was hardly likely to be a secret from his daughter, and I fear
J ack Winslow gossiped a little. Queer rumours got into circula-
tion. Something was to happen at a certain time in June ; but
u-hat, nobody seemed able to conjecture. All Idlechester, how-
ever, looked forward to the date announced, and one or two
people thought it worth while to make inquiry.
For example, Mrs. Bythesea thought it worth while to ask her
friend, Miss Branscombe, with whom she had not corresponded
for an age, what the rumour meant. And she got an answer of
this sort
"Cusers S-raasr, PIOCADILLY.
"DEAR Crs,Yes, I'm comin down. So is papa. So are
several others of our bad lot. I s all call and request your e is-
copal blessingYour untamed CLAUDIA. '

Which note the Bishop's wife, being not precisely the same indi
vidual who once romped in a Kingsleat bedroom, thought rather
impertinent. However, she deemed it advisable not to quarrel
with a lady of fashion like Miss Branscombe, especially as it
appeared that her father was likely to resume his ancient posi-
tion. And in this the Bishop entirely agreed with her, being a
thoroth man of the world, and far readier to believe in the
Premier than in St. Paul.
So Claudia received a marvellously affectionate epistle from
her old acquaintance, and laughed over it with provoking perspi
cacity.
And Devil anscombe himself, when it was noised abroad
that he was indeed in London, and was coming down to Idle-
chester, got a note of inquiry from his true liegeman, his loyal
follower, Ste hen Langton the tanner. The old boy was not
dead et. riting letters had never been a favourite business
with im, but he was resolved to know what this report meant.
So he indited a laborious epistle to Ralph Branscombe, at the
Clarendon Hotel, where the Idlecheste'r Guardian, copying the
London papers, had informed him the Squire was staying; and
the old gentleman handed it over with a heap of others to his
son, and said
" Write to old Langton, Raphael. He's been a. true friend."
So the Seraph, whom it rather' amused to write letters, sat
down to delight the old tanner with the following :
"Dssn MR. LANGTox,-;What you have heard is uite true.
My fatheris cominl7 down to Idlechester on the sevent , to settle
a few debts that have been outstanding rather too long, and
Claudia and I shall be with him. My intimate friend, Mr. Ste-
phen Langton, your grandson and namesake, has promised to
come down with me, although he can scarcely get away from Lon-
don society. We shall stay at the Half Moon Hotel, where we
shall he frequently to see you. Convey our regards to our
amiable amilyespecially to Miss Harriet Langton, whom I ave
often heard my friend Stephen mention in terms of the warmest
affectionYours, &c. RAPHAEL Bamscouaa."
"There," said the Seraph to himself, after rapidly writing this
epistle, " I fancy Langton's relations will be astonished, rather.
I wonder what that old catamaran of a maiden aunt of his will
say to my piece of attery."
The Seraph did not know much of the nature of maiden aunts.
He had never encountered the animal. Old Lanvton received
the letter in the morning, and brought it into the breakfast-
room, and read it aloud for the edication of his assembled prm
geny. When he had nished he said
" The Squire don't forget old friends, you see. And how well
Steve seems to be getting on l"

THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 199
And Aunt Harriet exclaimed
" The dear boy ! I was sure he had never forgotten me. How
glad I shall be to see him again. He was always a good boy."
Whereat one or two of his cousins, there present, grinned to
excess, mindful of Aunt Harriet's ast ohjurgations. The said
cousins, sons of Uncle Charles and ncle 'l'om, naturally envied
Stephen ; sheer luck had made him a gentleman ; they were des-
tined to work at a rather unpleasant trade to the end of their
days. And, when they got together, these young louts of Lang-
tons, they talked over some pessible way of revenging themselves
upon him for his unmerited good-fortune. They had no ra idity
of imagination, and could not readily hit on a scheme onen-
geance. But there was a consensus of opinion that something
ought to be done to make him ridiculous. If a man unexpect-
edly rises in the world, his own relations are naturally aggrieved
They cannot see anything in him which justies his elevation
above them. Of course, the less rened the original breed, the
more certain is this feeling to arise. It was very stron in the
breasts of the three or four male cousins whom Ste hen angton
had at Idlechester. They would have liked to uck him in a
peculiarly unsavoury tanpit. Their ultimate decision was, to
await an opportunity to do something.
Far different were the feelings of old Stephen Lanton, the
tanner. He was not a good old man, this~as we already know.
But he was loyal to the squire. And the idea that the squire
should have his own again lled him with as much delight as
the most loyal of cavaliers experienced when Charles II. came
from Over the water. And when he found the squire's son writ-
ing of his grandson as his intimate friend, it rejoiced his heart.
His delight took a form which would have given no special
satisfaction to Stephenbut still less to Stephen's uncles and
cousins.
"By jingo," said the old tanner "he's my eldest son's eldest
sonand he's my namesakeand he's the only fellow in the lot
with an spunk in him. I'll leave him the business."
And e went off to the great Mr. Drax, and insisted on his
drawing awill to this effect, and keeping it a secret. The lawyer
vainly reminded his client that Stephen was already a man of
property, and would not carry on the business if he had it.
" Never you mind," said the old man. " He's my hair. You
draw up the will so that he shall have ever penny and every
stick that belongs to me when I die. If litt e Polly had lived,
'twould have been different. But Steve shall have it all nowand
don't you tell a creature, Mr. Drax."
As to Aunt Harriet, whom, without o'endin many of my
readers, I may now venture to call an elderly la y, she was de-
lighted with Stephen's kind mention of her, as averred in Raphael
Branscombe's letter. She went about boasting of it. She per-
suaded herself that she had been very kind to him. It is to be

regretted that, in time, we forget our own misdeeds. The Past
fades; the Present glares upon us with all its sunlight Aunt
Harriet began to believe that her nephew had really been a great
pet of hers, and that he ought naturally to be enthusiastic in his
gratitude. So she looked forward to his arrival in this enthusias-
tically grateful state.
By and by the great day came. The event was ripe. Post-
chaises, in the early morning. brought to the Half Moon Hotel
the august travellers, who had travelled through the night. A.
vague tremor of excitement passed through the city of Idle<
chester. Post-chaises brought the travellers from town. Hum-
phre and his wife in one; the old Wolf and his daughter in
anot er ; Devil Branscombe and the Panther in the third. The
Seraph and Ste hen were, however, of a different taste. They
preferred His ajesty's mail; they liked the changeable com-
pany, the possible adventure, the gay 0 en-air travel. But adven-
ture, though possible, is not always 0 tainable; and I think it
will be admitted that our two friends had recently had their
share.
The Half Moon had a large room in its very centre, with a cor-
ridor running round it, in which balls and concerts were wont to
be given. Marmaduke Branscombe had this turned into a kind
of public room, whither might come all who sought audience of
his brother and Mr. Drax. With that ferocious fancy for food
which pertained to him, he made even such people as bill-dis-
counters and mortgagees eat and drink, so that this room was a
perpetual refectory. Of course, any real business was carried on
wit greater privacy; but, for the nine or ten days in which
settlement was being made, this great room was from morning to
night thronged with visitors, and the old Wolf thoroughly enjoyed
the humour of the scene. As for the ladies, they had a gay time
of it, driving about the neighbourhood, and seeing all that was to
be seen. One delicious moonlight evening they went together to
those old enchanted gardensno longer kept in the Elysian
beauty in which Algernon Page had loved to keep them, but still
full of marvellous bloom, and breathing is magical fragrance.
The Seraph was with them, and Stephen. Mr. Morll was
having an interesting legal after-dinner conversation with Mr.
Drax, whom, as a giver of briefs, he desired to impress favour-
ably. For Stephen those gardens Were haunted; there he had
wandered hand in hand with his sweet Anne Page in their poetic
childhood ; there Claudia Branscombe had pressed upon his lips
a kiss. Mrs. Morll did not experience any feelings of remorse
or even regret as she tripped along the familiar paths. One feel-
ing only could occupy her at a time, and she was lled to the brim
by that wild and wicked passion which Raphael had awakened
in her heart. Not so with Claudia. That rst evening amid
those emerald lawns and delicious ower-plots and long lustrous
avenues and sleeping lakelets was all agony to her. Her heart

throbbed with passionate erceness. Well she remembered the
days long ago, when she had humbled herself to gain Stephen's
love. Now he had contemptuously rejected her. Yet she was
obliged to walk with decorous placidity with him and the rest of
their friends. Well for Stephen Langton, perhaps, that she did
not, like many a Spanish maiden, carry a keen stiletto sheathed
in her corset As for Isola and the Seraph, the situation to them
was picturesque comedy.
"You have been here before," said Ra hael to Stephen, as they
stood beneath the pendent acacias, still t e favourite resort of the
ruby-eyed ringdovea
"Ages ago," he replied.
"A , but since we came down i"
" 0 yes. I came here to smoke a cigar and revive old
memories a. couple of nights ago."
"Quite romantic," laughed lsula; and she sang
"Blossom of hawthorn whitens in May:
Never an end to true love's sway.
Blossom of hawthorn fades in June:
I shall be tired of my true love soon.
Blossom of hawthorn's gone in July :
DarlingI must be ogood-bye l"
Merrily rang through the garden alleys Isola's exquisite girlish
voice. Not so silvery the lash of the fountains, or so musical
the coo of the doves. Step en said
" 1 hope I am not quite so bad as that When I love once, I
love alwa s."
"A mistake," said the Panther. "If you hate once, hate
always; that's wise. But don't try to believe love rmanent,
or you'll be alone in the world, Mr. Langton; nobo y else does
it. You'll be isolated."
" Isolate him with Isola.," said the Seraph laughingly, "and
he won't mind. But don't be bitter, Claudia, or people will say
you're an old maid."
"As I am. Don't you think the r61e suits me ! I wish you'd
marry, Raphael, and give me some babies to nurse. Marry
Isola."
" Talking of marriage," said the Seraph, " I have been recom-
mending "inifred to Langton, but he doesn't seem inclined to
take good advice. He says she's too religious I feel certain
that he is destined to marry a Branscombe."
" Why '2 " asked Isola. '
" Because he has become so queerly associated with us. From
rst to last we have borrowed him from the people over the
way. You did not know, perhaps, Isola, that he was born just
across the street. Have you called on your worthy relations yet,

"No, faith. I have seen my grandfather at the Half Moon,
you know."
"lrreverent boy, not to pay your respects to that charming
old aunt of yours. That's a pattern of maiden aunts, if you like,
Claudia. You should study her, if you want perfection in the
art.
"Let us all go there in force to-morrow morning," said the
Panther, " and see the tanyard. I never saw a tanyard. It must
be very amusing. \Vhat do you say, Mr. Langton ? "
"I shall be delighted," said Ste hen. "There is something
picturesque about a tanyard, and like the smell. As to the
auntthe less said of her the better, I think."
Hence was it that this moonlight stroll in Mr. Page's garden
was followed by a morning visit to Mr. Langton's tanyard.
Winifred accompanied her three cousins; the Seraph and Ste-
phen were their cavalier-s. It was very amusing to see Winifred
and lsola together. The Panther to some extent understood her
new-found cousin, but the Saint was utterly erplexed by the
charming little vagrant's oddity and slang. inifred was by
this time more thoroughly than ever the deaconess-nun; Father
Remigius confessed her still, but she had relinquished the faint
half-unconscious hope she had entertained of making him re-
nounce his VOW of celibacy; she had settled down contentedly
to that semi-sacerdotal old-maidenism which is so common among
English ladies. Yet Winifred Branscombe was not thirty, by a
year or two, and was still very beautiful.
The were a gay company in that old houseof the Langtons. The
gray o d tanner received them with delight, and Aunt Harriet
shone upon them so smilingly that they all declared her charm-
ing. They Were shone that famous best bedroom in which the
head of the Branscombes lay perdu, awaiting his daughter's visit,
and bathing the'baili's. They were shown the very tanpit in
which the unlucky attorney had assed the night. Stephen,
acting as cicerone, doubted whether e was awake or asleep, and
fancied that all thathad occurred since his boyhood was a dream.
The gathering of the Branscombes at ldlechester was remem-
bered in that city for many a day. Marmaduke, resolute to do
nothing by halves, set Mr. Drax to reorganise the estates, and to
rebuild the old Manor-house, which had been uninhabitable for
at least a quarter of a century. Everybody was paid in full, (prin-
cipal and interest; and everybody in "old. The old Wolf he laid
in an enormous stock of sovereigns ; he would have nothing to do
with notes or cheques. The Idlechester bank did a good stroke
of business at this period.
Of course the restoration of the Branscombes excited the county
and city magnates. The Duke of Axniinster drove over to visit
the head of the house ; minor potentates of all sorts did him
honour. The Duke asked him to come to Beau Sejour while the
Manor-house was rebuilding ; the Bishop and Mrs. Bythesea

wanted him to bring the Panther and stay at the Palace; half a
dozen equally hospitable o'ers were pressed upon the man who
a week or two before dared not have walked down High Street.
The Mayor and Corporation of ldlechester presented him an
ad lress : the Mayor and Corporation of Kingsleat followed suit.
Meanwhile the rm was fruitful of events. One afternoon,
Nathaniel Narrowsmith, bill discounter, of Kingsleat, had re-
ceived payment of the small amount due to himtwo thousand
five hundred pounds, all in gold. He had come in too late for
the Idlechester bank.
" I'd just as soon have your cheque, Mr. Branscombe," he
said.
" We don't give che ues " wled the Wolf. "Sorry you
don't like gold." q , gm
"It's so much trouble to take home."
" Leave it till to-morrow," suggested Ralph Branscombe.
" You can pay it into the bank rst thing. We'll give you
entertainment if you like to stay, though you have charged sixty
per cent."
But the old rascal didn't like keeping his money at an inn;
and wanted to get home, because the idea of his servants wasting
food and drink in his absence, made him utterly miserable ; so,
groaning over the expense, he hired a post-chaise, and transferred
theieto himself and his ve canvas bags of ve hundred pounds
eac .
Poor Nat Narrowsmith! Half way to Kingsleat the post-
chaise was stopped by a couple of men on horseback, and he and
the po~tilion were gagged and tied to a couple of trees, and the
bags disappeared. It caused an immense sensation. Ralph
Bransuom e liberally offered a reward of a hundred pounds for
the conviction of the thieves. But nothing was ever heard of
them ; and the unhappy bill discounter lust his money, and was
never the same man afterwards.
Another evsnt of about the same date was an assault made
upon our friend Stephen by three of his disaffected cousins.
T ey had noted his habit of taking a solitary stroll late at night
in the gardens he had loved in his boyhood. Their idea was to
revange themselves upon him for his good fortune by giving hint
at ducking in one of t e ponds which ornamented those gardens.
Now it chanced, on the evening xed by these cowardly louts
for their idiotic enterprise, that the Seraph had accompanied his
friend. But they resolved to carry out their scheme; Raphael
was not apparently the sort of person to show ght; Stephen
they believed to be a milk-sop ; and they were three burly
thick-set fellows of the true Langton stamp. So they made a
sudden rush at the two friends in a. solitary part of the gardens,
and separated Stephen from his companion, and hauled him
towards a piece of water. They found they had made a slight
mistake. Stephen was stronger and more determined than they

fancied. But Raphael, when he saw their game, sprang after
themstruck one fellow a blinding blow across the eyes with
a small cane which he carriedseized a second by the wrist,
giving it so sharp a twist that he yelled with painand ex-
claimed to Stephen
" I leave the other to you."
The words were scarcely uttered when that other splashed into
the water in which he had designed a ducking for his cousin.
It; may be supposed that the trio sneaked away in lamentable
ivht.
3 What fools ! " ejaculated the Seraph.
And the next morning there was much mirth in connection
with the adventure, which, somehow or other, became generally
known. It made the old tanner more resolute to adhere to that
astonishing will of his.
However, this gathering of the Branscombe clan came to an
end at last, after various incidents of fun, irtation, assault, and
highway robbery. The last day arrived, and there were assem-
bled at supper the whole family, with Mortill, and old Laugton,
and his grandsonno others. They sat together in the cosiest
room of the Half Moona room such as old-fashioned inns con-
tain, but which are not to be found elsewhere. There was Devil
Branscombe, lazily lying back in a huge easy chair, again the
recognised chief of this wild race, again furnished with the
sinews of war for as fast a life as he might choose to live. But
too old for thistoo oldRalph Branscombe began clearly to
see that the time had arrived for him to settle down quietly, to
consider his wild oats sown. to live like a highly respectable
Lord of the Manor of Kingsleat. And he accepted the rather
melancholy fact. He had tasted the marrow oi life. It would
be hard to mention any gentlemanly wickedness in which Devil
Branscombe had not participated to the utmost. His only hope
was that his son Raphael would do him credit, and it was a
subject on which he had not much fear.
Yet the inexperienced spectator, who had seen the Seraph this
evening, would scarce hava shared his father's condence. His
boyish beautythe beauty that had ensnared 1Emilia and Fior-
dilisaadhered to him. He looked a creature to be petted and
layed with. You would not for a moment have deemed the
Seraph dangerous have imagined him to be utterly devoid both
of conscience and of fear. I don't think he cared much for the
changed position of his family. He had always lived a pleasant
reckless life, and always meant to do so, whatever might happen;
and so, though the evantl'ul current of affairs interested him, he
certainly cared less about the change in his circumstances than
anv other member of the family.
can scarcely say what Claudia Branscombe felt. Her recent
adventure with Stephen Langth had com letely disturbed her
ordinary course of thonght and feeling. S e would have liked
## p. 205 (#215) ############################################
THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 005
to revenge herself on that young gentleman, but saw no way to
such an issue. She, of course, enjoyed the idea of plenty of
money, and accordingly plenty of fun ; but there was no definite
hope in her heart, and it was a very vague species of happiness
to which she looked forward. Perhaps she thought, now and then,
of the boy-baronet.
The Rev. "'alter Branscombe was there, cordially rejoicing in
the improved prospects of the family, though to him personally
they mattered little. He had received his long-lost brother, Mar-
maduke, with true Christian kindness, asking no inconvenient
questions. His faith in the Bransconibes took precedence of all
other faith. As to Winifred, she was rather puzzled. She had
some idea that the right thing for her unex ected uncle to do was
to build a cathedral, or an abbey, or somet ing. Any nice femi-
nine endowment, of which she could have been Lady Abbess,
would have been the very thing. St. Winifred was patron saint
of the Branscombes, everybody knew. "'hy shouldn't she be a
second St. Winifred l Ah, petite, are you not aware that this is
the wicked nineteenth centuryin which hypocrisy is permitted,
but not sanctityin which you can only play at being a saint?
As to Isola, who chanced to be sitting between Winifred and
Mrs. Mortill, I don't think she wanted to be a saint. I know
what she did want. I know she longed, pined, panted for it. I
know, too, that she thought herself wholly unworthy of it. Poor
Isola.! so gay, so bewitching, so ex uisitely formed to conquer
the worldyet so humble. She wovgld have given herself to be
the slave of the man she loved.
As to our heroine, she was in a dream all this time, and it was
a dream of Raphael. To be in his presence sufced for Anne
MOI-ll. Her keen-sighted husband must, I think, have perceived
this, had he not possessed that fatal fatuity of the quick but
shallow intellect which estimates itself far higher than any other
entity. Humphrey Morll was, I believe, uite as able a man as
Lord Westbury, and he looked down upon tephen Langton and
Raphael Branscombe, just as Lord "'estbury would robably
haVe looked down upon, say, Count d'Orsay and Lord yron, if
he had known them. He had an impracticable incapacity for
understanding faculties different from his own.
The old Wolf felt, I believe, very much like the creator of a
mighty drama. To have restored his brother and recovered his
daughter, surely these were mighty deeds. All was his doing.
He was both dramatist and protagonist. And he had an unsel-
sh delight in what he had accomplished, and, beyond that,
thorough gratitude to Stephen Langton, from whom he had re-
ceived aid so valuable ; and one especial longing he had, to which
he gave no utterancethat Stephen would marry Isola.
As to the two Langtons, grandfather and grandson, who com-
pleted the party on that last evening at the Half Moon, their
feelings were naturally peculiar. 'Illae old tanner was rather

mystied. He was delighted at the Squire's restoration, and
uzzled at the sort of share which his grandson seemed to have
in it. As to Stephen the younger, to him it seemed a vision. I
suspect he felt very much as De Quincey was wont to feel when,
in magnicent panorama, there swept before him in his 0 im-
dreams some tale of Troy divine, some tragic story of The or
Argos. Stephen Langton's principal perplexity was, what would
hap en when he woke.
' e last hours of this last night waned rapidly. Several were
going away at an early hourthe Rector and his daughter home
to Kingsleat, Ralph Branscombe and Claudia and Mr. and Mrs.
Morll to London.
"Raphael," said the Wolf to the Seraph, " will you take charge
of Isola to town to-morrow 'l " .
" With pleasure. But are you not coming?"
" No; I have other business of considerable importance. You
won't see me for a week perhaps."
" Well, Isola wont be afraid to trust herself with me, I know.
Will you, cugim mia ?"
She gave a merry trustful smile as answer.
" By the way," said the Seraph, "Stephen and I meant going
together. I hope you're not afraid of him, Isola."
Isola blushed.
For some ridiculous reason, Devil Branscombe and Morll
had decided to start at an early hour in the morning. Not so
Raphael. When the roposition was made to him, he replied
"No, thank you. i) never waste the hours of night, except for
some good reason. Sleep comfortably in your bed a third of
your day, and you may do pretty much what you like the other
two-thirds."
So, when the sun was just rising the Seraph and his friend had
the pleasure of seeing off a couple of post-chaises, containing four
members of the party. To their surprise, when these had started,
there came up to the gateway a dogcarr, with an unknown per-
sonage sitting in it, and Marmaduke Branscombe, oak chest in
hand as usual, got into it and took the reins.
" Good-bye, my boys," he said cheerily. " Take care of Isola."
So Raphael and Stephen returned to their sitting-room, where
wisely a re had been kept up, by which Isola at this time was
sitting, half asleep. And the Seraph sent that young lady to
bed authoritatively, and having done so, he said
" Look here, Langton, we'll go by the mail. It's a deuced deal
pleasanter than posting."
" Most certain y. By the way, where is the Wolf gone? and
who is his friend 'l" .
" I suppose his friend is one of those agreeable banditti who let
off sky-rockets when you and I are lounging on Waterloo Bridge.
Where the old pirate is gone I don't know; but I can guess what
he's gone to do."

" What i " asked Stephen.
" Pringle," re lied the Seraph, with emphatic laconism.
"By Jove, I ope he won't murder that bucolic idiot. Can't
we prevent anything tragical l"
"I don't quite see how. We don't know where he's gone, and
We haven't an idea where Pringle is. It is all mere con'ecture, of
the emptiest kind. No, we must leave them both to t eir fate."
" It would be rather awkward," said Stephen drily, "if your
highly respected uncle were to be hanged, which doesn't seem
entirely impossible"
" Egad, I'll take the risk," said the Seraph. " The old beggar
deserves hanging, no doubt. But he looks as if he was tolerably
ca ble of taking care of himself."
phael and Stephen, with that eln beauty Isola under their
convoy did not start for London till the following day. And
before leaving the Half Moon, Isola delighted the heart of Jack
\Vinslow by a magnicent resent of jewellery in remembrance
of her loyal service to Devil Branscombe in days gone by. And
Jack, b way of showing her appreciation of the generous gift,
drove the mail the rst stage towards London, the Seraph on the
box by her side, chaing her on her stvle of holding the ribbons.
'hThus ended the famous gathering of the Branscombes at Idle-
' ester.
CHAPTER XXIII.
PRINGLE.
JONAS PRINGLE was a ourishing specimen of the British
farmer in his youth. He was of the middle height, stout.
and orid, and fond of beer. He rode after the hounds, and
kept greyhounds for the coursing meetings. He could drink any
uantity of the diabolical stuff which the bucolic lout calls beer.
(llie had excessive leasure in smoking the worst possible tobacco
in a clay pipe. e went to church regularly. He read, with
some difculty, the news as supplied weekly by that famous
periodical, the Reading Mercury. Though Reading is the chief
town of the county in which Jonas Pringle dwelt, reading is far
from being the chief accomplishment of its farmers.
Jonas Pringle's entanglement with that wicked little Isola was
a surprise to himself. He never could distinctly remember how
it began He never could recollect how it was suggested that he
should pretend to make love to teacher instead of pupiL Some-
how or other the gay girl had bewitched the young farmer ; and
in her presence he possessed a capacity which never approached
him elsewhere. These things are not impossible. The electric

an undeveloped science in that direction. I may perhaps eluci-
date it when I have made a snug little fortune by novel 'writing.
But it is certainto dwell only on the roughest elements of the
subjectthat a great general may make an army of cowards
brave, that a great reacher may make a congregation of scoune
drels religious, and t at a loving woman may inform a mere clod
with much of her own exquisite esprit.
Such was the tem orary effect on Jonas Pringle of our Isola'l
inuence. He coul not understand his own marvellous clever-
ness. Indeed, stupidity was a. kind of heirloom of the Pringle
famil , whereof they were rather proud than otherwise ; so when
this onas found himself making love to one girl while he ad-
mired another, he could scarcely believe in his own identity.
You must associate with small farmers to learn how stupid they
are (out of their own vocation, of course), and how, roud of their
stupidity. I am not inclined to blame them. eener intelli-
gence would probably result in discontentin a desire to be
something entirely different from what they are.
Isola made Jonas Pringle for the time clever enough to
conduct an intrigue to successful issue. We know alread a
good deal of what happened. In process of time they reac ed
Brighton, and took lodgings at Hove, and there the girl of foun
teen proved mistress of the situation. She was already con-
temptuously weary of the blatant and orid young agricu turist.
She took the lead in everything. She informed the old lady
whose lodgings they engaged that they were brother and sister.
She would not permit him even to kiss her. Poor young man,
infatuated though he was, I verily think he would gladly have
escaped from her. She tyrannised over him. He heartily wished,
more than once, that he had run away with the fat governess
with the shoulders.
And worse things yet were in store for him. Isola was wont
to make him walk with her regularly every afternoon. Gladly
would Jonas Pringle have been back smoking a pipe of horribly
bad tobacco with his cronies in the neighbourhood of Maiden-
head ; but he was Isola's slave. and dared not say her nay. And
then came the terrible day when, summoned by Isola, the Seraph
fell upon him on the Chain Pier, like an avenging angel indeed.
The young farmer was not a coward. He could hold his own
well among his lumbering equals. But when our friend Raphael
came down upon him with such .ppallim7 suddenness, his pre-
sence of mind departed. He was " nocked out of time."
So the Seraph took Isola to his hotelPegg's, I thinkHarry
Pegg was a little boy at the timeand poor J enas Pringle went
miserably home to his lodgings at Hove. And at those lodgingsi
over which, even for this dull fellow, Isola had shed a kind 0
poetic halo, he had received from Raphael a contemptuous mes-
sage, to the etl'ect that he would ght him if he wished.

Pringie by no means liked the idea. He was not a coward, I
have said; but both courage and cowardice have different phases;
and the young farmer had no idea of setting himself up to be
shot at, twelve paces oil". You see he was not a gentleman. The
code of honour among gentlemen is such that they learn to super-
sede physical cowardice by moral courage. At least, it was so ;
the foolish we in which the law has been rendered more strin-
gent against uelling has done innite harm; and men in the
army, who are in a difculty whether they ght or whether they
decline to ght, are singularl ' ill-used. There are some injuries
which nothing save the due can redress; and I rmly believe
that there will be a reaction from the milksop legislation of recent
days. We are already beginning to og again; I pray God we
may soon begin to ght again.
Well, Pringle did not want to be shot at, and so slinked o'.
Raphael made no in uiry about him. He was profoundl dis-
a ointed in Isola. e had imagined a career for this wil waif,
t is baby Bohemian. She had run away with a stupid young
farmer. It was sadly disappointing. However, he was the man to
make the best of a bad bargain ; so he found her a home in London,
where we have already had the pleasure of meeting her.
Pringle returned to his own neighbourhood. But he found it
impossible to live there. His old friends looked askance at him.
His was an iniquity of a different kind from any they were accus-
tomed to. They would sell you pork the product of choleraic
pigs, or mutton which resulted from the slaughter of very invalid
sheep; but the abstraction of a little girl from a boarding-school
was a form of rascality to which the worthy farmers were unac-
customed. Such is life. There are men who would deem the
sale of diseased pork for food a crime that deserved hanging, but
who would think it very correct to run away with a pretty girl.
The farmers, Pringle's friends, thought quite otherwise. '1 hey
made the poor fellow's life miserable when he returned. So he
got somebody to take his farm, and turned his stock into money,
and, hearing of a carrier's business to be sold on the Great North
Road, purchased it, and settled down to its necessary work.
The old Wolf, Marmaduke Branscornbe, had traced him.
Pringie's waggons started for London twice a week, from a town
about forty miles down the road. In the outskirts of this town
there was an old-fashioned inn, the Bel and Dragon, with a court-
ard surrounded by galleries. From this in the waggons had
en wont to start, and Jonas Pringle had taken it with the
carrying business. Here, late one night, some twenty-four hours
after his departure irom Idlechester, Marmaduke Brnnscombe
pulled up in his dog-cart, along with a ve villainous-looking
ruian who oiciated as his groom and Y 'et. We saw them
depart from the cathedral city.
Jonas Prinvle came out to welcome the visitors, who had
driven under the gateway into the yard. There was a ne ruddy
ush of brandy and water in his broad face, as he stood in the

line of light which crossed the courtyard from the briht bar-
arlour. The young fellow had married; married the daughter
of the man from whom he had purchased the business, a ne
buxom wench, who kept him in capital order, and certainly
suited him a world better than Isola would have done. Fancy
lsola mated to this coarse crass carrier and innkeeper l
Marmaduke Branscombe and his henchman descended.
" Look to the mare," said the old Wolf gruiy to his follower.
"I want to sleep here to-night," he said further, to Pringle ; and
then stalked into the bar, where a few of Pringle's cronies sat
smoking and drinking, while Mrs. Pringle served them in buxom
buoyant fashion. He sat down without hesitation in an arm-
chair by the reside which chanced to be unoccupied ; and then,
opening his marvellous chest, produced a bottle of rum and a
lemon, and called for hot water. The assembled company stared
at him, open-mouthed and silent. He was worthy of amazement.
that grim old Wolf, lying back in his chair, and drinking rum of
fragrance and avour miraculous.
By and by Pringle came in, and the Wolf's follower, a grim-
mer-looking fellow than even the Wolf himself, and the company
began to resume its previous loquacity. They discussed the
price of wheat and of plus; they talked of a hundred things dear
to the bucolic heart. They became very gay indeed when Mar-
maduke, xing his eyes upon a punch-bowl high n on an upper
shelf, propose a bowl of punch. And not onl did he propose
it, but he also made itan artistic bowl, a ull and fragrant,
strong and steaming bowla bowl such as these rustics had
never conceived. Very gay they got over it. Stout, redfaced
lMkrs. Pringle was induced to sip a glass or two, and seemed to
i e it.
"By the way," said Marmaduke suddenly, "didn't you use to
live down Maidenhead way, Pringle 'I"
The landlord of the Bel and Dragon did his best to turn pale.
" I know something of those parts," he answered.
"You didn't get married down there, I guess," said the "'olf.
" The ' missus' is too ne a woman for Berkshire."
Mrs. Pringle accepted the compliment, you could see. Her
husband murmured something unintelligible.
"l asked the question," said the Wolf" your health, Mrs.

punch. But Pringle's wife interposeda dea, ex machinapert
and decisive.
"He's got no relations that would do such things. And I
don't look much like a boarding-school miss, do I? No, no,
you've come to the wrong shop, master."

PRINGLE. III
"It was a curious story I heard," said Marmaduke medita-
tively, pulling awa at his negrohead. "' The young lady Was
taken away to Brig ton, I think; and some friend of hers fol-
lowed her there. But of course it doesn't interest you; oulv,
being the same name, I thought of it to-night when 1 came in."
The old Wolf looked peculiarly grim and savage. Young
Pringle, although, as I have said, not a coward in ordinary cir-
cumstances, was utterly unprepared for such an attack as this.
His boon companions, as well as his wife, could see that in some
mysterious way it affected him. Marmaduke smoked and drank,
as if to smoke and drink were liie's only business; and his
villainous-looking associate imitated him ; but a curious chill fell
upon the rest of the company, which no quantity of rum punch
seemed able to dispel. By and by they dropped off, one after
the other, and there was no one left save Marmaduke and his
henchman, and Mr. and Mrs. Pringle.
" You can go to bed, Gregory," growled the old Wolf. " Mind
and be early to-morrow."
The fellow took a nal gulp of punch, and Mrs. Pringle showed
him to his room.
" Send your wife to bed, Pringle," said Marmaduke, in that
lady's absence, to the luckiess landlord. " I want to talk to you."
Pringle began a hesitating explanation, but the Wolf stopped
him at once with" Do as I tell you."
He dared not disobey. He got rid of his spousehow I know
not and sat down opposite his grim nest in a strange state of
trepidation. Marmaduke took very ittle notice of him for a
long time, but went on smoking and drinking without cessation.
At last he said" Pringle, is your wife safe in her own room 2
Isn't she listening at some keyhole? I know what women are.
Go quietly and see."
Pringle was stupeed into obedience to this terrible stranger.
He crept up the stairs towards his own room. The door stood
ajar, as was usual when Mrs. Pringle went first to bed - a rush-
light burnt upon the table ; and cautiously utting his head into
the room, he saw a ruddy face upon the pi low, and heard his
stout spouse snore the snore of the virtuous.
So he descended againslowly, I must admit, for he had no
special desire to face his strange guest. However, he came back
and resumed his chair, and sat awaiting what might happen.
" Safe, is she l " said Marmaduke.
" Fast asleep."
"Good. Drink some more punch. This is better tobacco than
yours. Help yourself."
P00r Pringle obeyed orders.
"You were the man," said Marmaduke Branscombe at last,
with diabolical deliberation"you were the man who tonk a
youngalady away from a school on Maidenhead Thicket. Is it
not so "
" Yes," said Pringle.

"No," he answered. " was willing to marry her," he went
on to say, speakin with unusual volubillty. "She was above

"I know. He came down at once, and gave you the horse-
whigping you richly deserVed, and took her away. 1 know."
T e old Wolf smoked for some time in silence.
" Look here, Pringle," he said at last. " I have reason to think
you are telling me the truth. Are you?" he asked with erce
emphasis, risin<7 from his seat, and glaring at him. " By God, if
you lie, I'll nd you out and kill you, wherever you are."
" It's all true that I sayI swear it is," said the landlord of the
Bel and Dragon, now thoroughly frightened.
I am not astonished at his frightMarmaduke Branscombe
was not at any time nice to look at ; but when that scar on his
forehead grew innumerable colours with rage, and his great eyes
glared ercely down in the dark caverns where they dwelt, he
was an aplpalling apparition. Pringle was frightened.
"It's a trueI swear it's all true," he said, over and over
again; and even while, in his abject terror, he re eated this for-
mula, rather to the old Wolf's amusement, the our was burst
Open, and in came Mrs. Pringle.
She had not been asleep. Infallible uxorious instinct had told
her there was somethin wron . She had heard Pringle creep up
the creaking stairs. S e h snorod the snore of the virtuous
with unnatural unction. And now, after vainly attemptinv to
listen, her fear that something would happen to her husbandlllad
conquered all other fear, and she burst suddenly into the room.
Her round, rudd face was surrounded by curl~papers and a
voluminously-l'rilied night-cap. She was rather a picture.
Marmaduke Branscombe laughed grimly and quietly as he
looked at her.
"Give your wife a chair, Pringle," he said. "What can I have
the pleasure of doing for you, madam '1"
But, having ventured into the room, Mrs. Pringle did not know
what to do next. She had an instinctive idea that there was
something wrong, but could not understand what. She was
naturally rather a dull womanin this well suited to her hus~
bandand the present position of affairs completely paralysed all
her faculties.
" You had better take Mrs. Pringle to bed," said the old Wolf
at last, " and then you can show me where I am to sleep."
Pringle continued obedient. When he returned, Marmaduke
said" Don't be frightened, my good fellow. I did intend to
kill you, but I have altered my mind. You are a fool, I see."
And he went to bed.

And so did Pringle, who received from his wife a strangely
incoherent curtain lecture. It had dawned upon her. somehow,
that there was another woman involved in the affair. The dullest
female intellect brightens a little with this stimulus. That her
"master," to use the good country phrase, should ever have run
away with a young lad from a boarding-school, was to her in-
credible. Yet clearly t ere was something in it. Clearly there
was ground for objurgation. So she objurgatedin that weary
whine of the stupid scold which is one of this world's worst

Pringle fell asleep.

" LET us have a glass of Montrachet together," said Stephen to
the Seraph.
They had taken Claudia and Isola to see the exhibition of
paintings at Somerset House. Claudia had come unwillingly,
and she was getting more and more interested in the Assyrian
baronet; but there was talk of trying to induce Sir Thomas to
paint the portraits of the ladies, and so art was the fashion of the
moment.
They went to Stephen's rooms. Auguste Lancel, his admirable
valet, knew exactly what sort of a luncheon to produce for ladies.
It was spread with a master's hand, and the Montrachet, to which
Stephen had invited them, was decanted with skill. 'Tis a deli-
cate wine, and needs skill.
Isola, exquisitely lost in a vast velvet chair, held her bell-glass
up to the hght, and regarded the pale s arkling uid with the
air of a counoisseuse, but the light WhiCl glittered in her won-
drous eyes was more beautiful than the s arkle of the wine.
" You look wicked, Isola," said the anther. It would be
hard to say recisely how Claudia at this time felt towards
Stephen. Be ore the Idlechester gathering he had kept out of
her way ; but that event had forced them into proximity, and they
could not ignore one another. I think Claudia heartily regretted
that she had discovered real strength and manliness in Slephen
at the moment of altogether losing him. But she was infatuate.
She had dressed up that doll, Sir Arthur Willesden, in all man-
ner of adventitious attributes which did not belong to himand
then she fell down and worshi ped him.
'Tis woman's habit this, an has absurd results now and then.
Yet it is fortunate for mankindif a 'woman in love could see
the man she loves as he really is, instead of as she imagines him
how long would her love continue!

" When are you off 'l" said Stephen to the Seraph.
It was tacitly understood that Raphael Branscombe was going
somewhere or other very soon ; he had dropped remarks to that
e'ect in various directions; but nobody understood where he
was going, or when to return.
"It's a question of days, nowhours, I may say. It doesn't
quite depend on myself."
" i hope you won't be long away," said Stephen.
" Oh, so do 1," exclaimed Isola with eager emphasis. " I shall
miss you so, Seraph. D0 come back soon."
" Can't promise, child," he said ; " I'm rather tired of you all,
and want a change."
" Complimentary," said the Panther listlessly. .
"Well, hang it, Claudia," said her brother, "you give us all
the impression that you're deucedly tired of us. I don't know
what's come over you lately. I should say you were in love, if
I thought our family given to that very ridiculous weakness"
" You're not, we know," she said. 
" Certainly not," he re lied with a laugh; "I leave that ab-
surdity to your sex, in c ild. If they like to fall in love with
me, 'tis another affair.'
" What a coxcomb you are," said the Panther.
" But I fear it is true," interposed Ste hen Langton. " All the
handsomest and cleverest women do falFin love with him. He
has the fatal gift of Paris."
" Paris 'I what do you mean 1" asked Isola. " Is there any secret
at Paris to make eople fall in love with you 1 How delightful!
I'll make papa e me there directly. Where do you buy it?"
" There, that's your punishment for talking classical] before
ladies," said the Seraph. " Even Claudia doesn't un erstand
you, though she has read everything."
" I plead guilty," said Stephen. " But you have more than
once reminded me of Alexander Theoeides, that's the fact. Hadn't
you an interview with Aphrodite on Ida once upon a time '1 "
" I should not object to anything of the kind. But don't be
edantic, old fellow. Remember that you've a pretty fresh recol-
ection of your Greek, while I've learnt languages enough to
extinguish it since I left Eton. Not that I ever knew much.
My great accomplishment was playing girls' parts in our Datchet
Lane theatricals. We played in a coal warehouse, if I remember,
after the Long Chamber performances were given up. It was
great fun. You've no idea what a pretty girl 1 made.'
"You'd do that now, I think," said Isola. " Suppose you dress
up, and let's go and have a s ree somewhere 'l"
The Panther looked horri ed.
" What you used to call scamandering," said the Seraph. " I
Really should not mind, if I knew where to go to the spree in
question; but town is very dreary just now."
" If you were anxious to cause a sensation in that particular
line, you should have exhibited at ldlechester," said Claudia.

" We might have introduced you to everybody as another of
Uncle Marmaduke's daughters."
Stephen, struck by a sudden idea, rang the bell.
" Auguste," he said, " what's going on to-night 7"
The intelligent valet enumerated several public entertainments.

" Pardon, monsieur," said Lancel, " I forgot one thing. Signor
Cellini has a bal masque tonight."
" Cellini," said Ha hael ; "is that the fellow who calls himself

" At the Clarendon Rooms," said the valet.
" Get tickets," said Stephen. " Fourit will be grand. We can
dine with you, Isola, can't we, and then arrange about the dresses."
" Better get ve tickets," she said. " Papa will be sure to want
to 0."
ll. was settled with electric rapidity. The Panther was not in
her gayest mood, and did not enter into the fun very readily;
but the contagious vivacity of her companions soon aroused her,
and she made a sensible suggestion.
" If we are to have dresses t for anything, it's absurd to leave
it so late. lt is two o'clock now."
" I thought Raphael could borrow a dress from you, perhaps,"
said Ste hen.
" here," said the Seraph; "send your fellow round to
Louis ; he'll bring a costumier here in no time."
This was done, and very shortly a couple of Hebrews, male
and female, had audience of the merry party, who had not yet
grown tired of Montrachet. And, after much discuss-ion, ihey
came to a decision. Raphael, the main gure of the quartet, was
to be arrayed as a lady of fashion, in the days of the Second
Charles. Stephen ap rated as a cavaliera tall edition of the
wicked and witty Ear of Rochester. Isola chose to be costumed
as a pagea Lilliputian page she looked ; a baby servitor.
" You ought to go as a baby in long clothes," laughed Stephen,
" and I'd be your nurse."
The Panther was diicult to determine, but at length resolved
on a Spanish costume, which suited her dark beauty and lithe
- gure exquisitely well. And these important arrangements being
nally made, they went to dine at the Wolf's Den. as Raphael
irreverently styled the residence of his uncle and Isola.
The grim old Wolf was away. He used occasionally to rush
ol'l' abruptly, as it on momentous business, just scratching down a
brief note to tell his daughter not to expect him. So they sat
down to dinner together, these four. At about half- ast nine
the dresses arrived, and away went the ladies to try t eir part.
They were soon read . Claudia looked as if she had just stepped
out of one of Alfred de Musset's lyrics ; she was that very mur-
auise whom the passionate chansonnier loved; the beautiful An-
alusian, half demon and half angel, to whom he sang songs in

Madrid. He who caught the gleam of her black eyes ashing
through her mask, would be xed and fascinated at once.
As to Isola, in her close-tting, quaint costume of azure veIVet
with silver tags ; and ca of the same with crimson feather, hid
ing her beautiful hair; er silk stockings revealing the daintiest
of well-cut legs and anklesshe was a marvel of Lilliput.
"Some one will steal you, Isola," said the Seraph. " Some
giantess will put you in her niu' and ca you away."
"I'm not afraid," she said with a laug of silver. "Go and
dress, Raphael."
There was great fun in getting him into his feminine garments
much difculty with bodice and corset; but, when the cloth-
ing was done, nobody would have detected his real character.
He was a very piquant beauty of the days of amorous comedy.
There was not a masculine turn about him; Count Antony
Hamilton would have recognised him as one of his own portraits.
As to Ste hen, he made a very fair imitation of a Caroline cava-
lier. The ress is sufciently becoming to a good-looking young
fellow. He was to take the two apparent ladies under his escort,
Isola following as age. A carriage came for them at eleven.
The Clarendon ooms have disappeared in the improvements
of London. But, beloved readers, if any of you remember the
building of the Burlington Arcade, or even the foundation of the
University of London, you will surely have both danced and
dined in these dear old rascally rooms. You will remember their
awkward staircases, their tortuous passages, their convenient aute-
rooms. You will omibly have played whist and vingt-un in
their card-rooms. f not, why, so much the better for you.
There was a great crush at the Clarendon to-night. When
our friends arrived the fun had already become fast and furious,
though the dancing was not as yet precisely Tam O'Shanterish.
They were soon in the thick of adventure. A domino in blue
was intriguing Stephen; the Seraph found a partner in a burly
personage, magnicent in the attire of Henry VIII.; but the
Spanish lady, not so easily pleased, held longer aloof, and her
page kept close to her.
By and by, however, the Panther was accosted by a mask bear
ing a suspicious resemblance to Sir Arthur \Villesden. She
turned away with him ; and Isola, nding herself deserted, natu-
rally looked round for a companion. She soon found one in the
shape of a. gentleman over six feet high, dressed in excellent imi-
tation of a giantess from Yorkshire, at that time being exhibited
in London. A good-humoured giantess apparently, ever on the
broad grin. She and Isola went through a quadrille together in
otesqne fashion, and then made their way to the supper-room
tor champagne.
So the party were separated. Stephen, soon tired of his domino
in blue, looked round for some of his companions ; nding none,
he strove to console himself with a domino in amber. This was
a gayer creature, rather, and he took her down to supper, all the

polished oti' a prodigious quantity of pigeon-pie. with that abnor-
mal appetite which such scenes create, he returned to the ball-
room. There, to his satisfaction, he found that the Sera h and
Claudia had joined each other ; they were walking up an down
in the pauses of the dance with abuoyant vivacit which attracted
numberless eyes. Stephen tried vainly to sha e of! his amber
domino, in order to join them. All at once their way was im-
peded by three or four resolute admirers. They were surrounded.

This was. too much. Donn he went with a well-plaute facer
fmm Raphael's rapid st; and then the Seraph and his sister
slip ed into an anteronm, where Stephen at once joined them.
" e shall have a row," he said. "These fellows are half of
them drunk. I should be for going home at once, only I can't
imagine where Isola is."

ously. " If you and I can't take care of Claudia, it's ueer. e'll

his they did accordingly, and encountered no further moles-
tation. The Highlander had disappeared. The Seraph's prowess
had astonished and appalled these ebrious Lotharios. A lady
who could hit so straight and hard, though in the costume of a
Duchess of Portsmouth, was not with im unity to be annoyed.
But where was the page, the dainty Lilliputian in azure velvet 'I
They could not nd her in any of the rooms. It is notoriously
difcult to nd a friend in an ever-moving crowdespecially
when that crowd surges through a labyrinth of rooms and ante-
rooms. The company grew thinnerbut no Isola.
At length there seemed a sudden tendency of the whole crowd
of revellers in one direction, as if led by a rumour or a noise.
Stephen and his companions went with the rest. The current of
motley humanity drew them to one of the entrances. The fold-
ing doors were open; and as they looked down the wide stone
staircase, they saw a strange sight below them.
It was a giantess ying down those steps, with a pretty page in
azure velvet gras ed in her mighty embrace.
"Stop her l" s outed Stephen in a thunderous voice, rushing
down the stairs with headlong haste, much to the discomture of
the crowd below.
But before he could reach the hall the scene had changed.
There was a strugglea ash of steel; the giantess lay on the
ground, a stream of blood staining her dress ; and he had a
momentary vision of Isola, full in the glare of gas which brought
out the strange opalescent splendour of her wild eyes and won-
drous hair, uncovered and dishevelled. On the instant she was
gone; but he picked up the jaunty cap with its crimson plume.

Stephen, having picked up Isola's ca , had stepped forward to

out perceiving any trace of the runaway. Returning, he found a
group around the giantessas I have hitherto styled the stupid
inasquerader who had attempted to carry away Isolaand ascer-
tained that the only harm the fellow had received was a stab
through the eshiest part of his right arm. Like most men of
vast bulk, he was a coward, and had fainted at the sight of his
own blood. Who he was, concerns not this history. Uncom-

huge arm, he was rmitred to do.

will nd her way back to the Den. Let us go."
The carriage was ready, and away they went towards the quiet
street.
" I hope she has come to no harm," said the Panther.
"Harm l" laughed the Seraph. " Harm! Why, Claudia, I
shouldn't have much fear of you in such a contingency ; but Isola
pshaw ! We shall nd her waitina' for us."
"Do you really think so? ' asked Stephen.
" Unqnestiouably. What's to irevcnt it? After so thoroughly
shutting up her giantess, I won er you can doubt her ability to
take care of herself."
Ra hael was right. When they reached the Wolf's Den, they
fouu Isola sitting by a comfortable rethe morning was grow-
ing chillywith a pdte' dew foiea gras before her, and a bottle of
Moselle 0 en. She had got rid of her page's dress, and was
comfortab attired in one of the loose wra pvrs which arrided
her. On the white cloth lay a tiny jewelledp stiletto, with bio->11
upon its blade.
" Well," said the Seraph, shaking down his brocaded petticoats,
" this looks deucedly comfortable."
And then he ulled off his long gloves, and made a great gap
in the pdt, andJ lled a huge goblet with Moselle. And I~ola
gaily sang the chorus of the poet-kings old humorous melancholy
song:

"And we'll gang nae mair a-roving,
A-roi'ing in the night ;
"'c'll gang nae mair a-roving,
Let the moon shine e'er so bright."
"Well," said Stephen, as he helped the Panther to some pdle',
" this is what comes of a glass of Montrnchet."
" N ow, Isola," said Claudia, " tell us your adventures."
" All right," she said. " I'm all there. The giantess caught a
Tartar, rather. You know it struck me before I started that I
wasn't very big ; and your saying somebody might carry me
away made me think of this little article." She took up the tiny
dagger, and poised it on her delicate little hand. " I didn't
expect to have to use it ; but I thought I'd be safe. Well, that
big woman made up to me, and was great fun. You should have
seen us dance. And then we sloped off to have some supper;
and shethat is, hetried to make me drink a lot of wine, but
I didn't quite see it ; and then we got away into one of the side
rooms, and irted like a thousand of bricks. And the sccnndrel
wanted to nd out who I was, and where I lived, and to make an
appointment with me ; but I wasn't to be done, as he soon found
out. And at last, when he thought the coast was clear, he took
me in his arms, the beggar! and rushed off with me down the
staircase as hard as he could Pelt. And then at the bottom I
manaed to get hold of this little a'airhe was holding me so
tightI couldn't move my arms beforeand just gave him a sharp
prod in the arm. By St. George, he dropped me like a red-hot
coal. I never saw such a gonoph. And then, you know, I made
tracks, and got here safe as eggs, and ulled off my togs. I made
Lotty light a re, and get supper. II hich, golopshious it is," she
conc uded, helping herself to more pdte'.
It is amazing what little women can eat and drink.
" You don't seem to care much about the fate of your big
friend," said the Seraph.
"I don't quite see why I should. The fellow wasn't particu-
larly polite to me. And I know I didn't hurt him ; I just bled
him a little with this lancet."
"He looked as if a little bleeding would do him good," said
Stephen. " He ought to be greatly obliged to you. If he knew
where on live, I should think he'd call and thank you."
"I on't want to see him, I'm sure. I hate big, stupid,
cowardly men."
" You should fall in love with Branscombe," said Stephen.
" He's neither of the three."
I am sorry to record that'this party of four sat chatting in this
careless, pointless fashion, long after broad daylight had bright-
ened the street. Supper, indeed, merged in breakfast.
Night work tells. A shiver crept over the party. Isola called
for coffeewhich came, with an accompaniment of grilled chicken
and other hot comestibles.

ever since we accepted your unlucky invitation to lunch, Lang-
ton. I suspect a little sleep for a change would do us all good."
Can any ody tell me why peo le have so strong a disincline-
tion to go to bed after a certain our is past? Is is an enigma
to me. Dull as may be one's associatesey, and one's self also
there is the most unaccountable aversion from the pleasant couch,
which, soft and warm and white, awaits one with unreproachl'ul
bosom. Of course, if a man is conscious that his placens uzor is
implacany waiting for him, it is quite another thing. But to be
dog-tired, to be conscious that the yielding bed is ready, and that
you have only to lock your door and undress to be in the soft
arms of silence and sleepand yet to waste the hours in amuse-
ments of which you are utterly weary, is so strange, so inexpli
cable a proceeding. I have done it hundreds of times, wonder-
ing at myself all the while. All these four people were aware
that the right thing to do was to go to bed, but not one of them
moved. Isola excepted, they were still in their masquerade
dresses, and a queer picture they made. The Seraph, tough and
well-seasoned, showed no symptom of weariness, and looked a
very easy-going and careless young lady, indeed.
" I am doubtful," he said, after a pause, "whether I shall go
to bed at all. A warm bath will make me as fresh as paint, as
Isola would say."
" That's a mistake," said Stephen ; " you feel it afterwards.
I think we had better move at once. What say you, Miss Brans-
combe 'l "
"I am almost too sleepy to move," she said, with a yawn.
At this moment the door opened, and Marmaduke Branscombe
entered, followed by the villainous-looking comrade who was
with him at Pringle's. The old Wolf looked round upon the
company with a glare of amazement and surprise. His daughter
cla ped her hands merrily, and broke into one of her silvery
pea s of laughter.
" Why, who's this?" he exclaimed in bewildered interrogation.
He recognised Stephen and the Panther after the rst glance,
but Ra hael puzzled him.
The Seraph was equal to the occasion. He rose and saluted the
old gentleman with a stately curtsey. " You're just in time to have
supper with us, Uncle M armaduke," he said in a feminine falsetto.
" Supper ! " exclaimed the old Wolf. " Why, Isola, what is it?
Who's that lady l "
" That lady is a gentleman," she replied with a laugh. " You
can't have forgotten Mr. Raphael Branscombe."
" Well," he growled, "you do make a. stunning girl, Raphael.
Have you been out like that 1 Did anybody make love to you '1"
" Yes," he said, "somebody did, and I knocked him down for
his politeness. But you should hear your daughter's adventure."
And he reported to the old gentleman the way in which Isola
had distinguished herself. ' '
"A good girl," said "in Wolf, taking up the stiletto, and pan-

ing his thumb along the edge. "A chip of the old block ! You
know how to take care of yourself, Isola."
"We were just going when you came in," said Langton. " It's
rather late, and we want some sleep."
" You can sleep here, all of you, if you like," he said. " I've
plenty of beds. I don't like turning people out when they've
ad a wet night."
"'Gad," said the Seraph, "that's a ne idea. Show us your
cribs, uncle. Then we shall be all together to begin another
evening. What do you say, Langton 'l "
" I'm game ; but what does Miss Branscombe say?"
The Panther was asleep.
"'Twould be a shame for her to go to Clarges Street when
there's a bed nearer."
So Isola guided her cousin to a room. The old Wolf had
tted up a considerable number of very comfortable bed-cham-
bers, several of them with two beds. His hospitality was gene-
rous; he had numerous visitors of all sorts; and, after what he
called a wet night, he liked to be able to stow away his guests
in close proximity to himself, so as to begin a second revel by
wa of epilogue to the rst.
glaudia Branscombe was tired out. I think that ne spirit
of hers had lost some of its original nerve. She had failed
once or twice. and it had quelled her courage. She had been
lamentany foiled by Ste hen at Idlechester; and then, recom-
mencing the contest in tondon, she had been subjugated and
rejected. And she was playing anything but a satisfactory game
With the Assyrian baronet. These things had oowed her ; else,
in truth, I do not think the Panther would have been so tho-
roughly knocked up by a glass of Montrachet and its conse-
quences. She could scarcely undress; and when, with lsola's
help, she was safely in bed, she fell asleep with that delicious
suddenness for which it is worth while to nude 0 an fatigue.
She slept in Elysium. As to Isola, the WBwal't litt e beauty
seemed scarcely tired at all. Having got rid of Claudia, she ran
down again to take a nal leave of her father who had lighted
his pipe, and was talkin to Raphael and Step en.
"Claudia was asleep efore she was in bed," she observed.
"And now, I'm 01?. Good morning to you all. Don't keep
those boys up any longer, papa"
"We'll be oil too," said the Seraph. " I suppose you can send
round for some of our people by and by. I don't much care for
walking about London in petticoats."
"Nobod would suspect you," said the Wolf. "But come
along. I' show you your room."
He led them to a large room at the back, in which were two
beds. It was tted up with every luxury, and a good re had
been lighted. I don't object to a re in a large bedroom even in
warmish weather; and Marmaduke Bransconibe was of the same
Way of thinking.

"By Jove !" said the Seraph, throwing himself into an easy-
chair, and stretching his legs, with small regard to his etticoats,
"this is pleasant. Where's your cigar-case, Langton I must
have a smoke."
" You'll want a lle de chamb're to undress you," said Langton.
" Egad, yes. I thought I should never get into these blessed
things, and now I don't see my way out of them. Thank Heaven,
I'm not a girl !"
" Or you couldn't make love to them, as Montaigne or some-
body said."
"The reply to that is Lady Mary's remarkthat her only
reason for being glad that she was a woman was that she should
not be obliged to marry one. But, I say, old fellow, do you think
the Wolf has any sinister reason for keeping us all here to sleep?
Mayn't he mean to murder us?" As Raphael said this, he was
running a penknife through the troublesome l'astenings of his
dress, by way of cutting the Gordian knots of feminine attire.
" I don't see any good he could ain by such a proceeding,"
said Langton. " I suspect he wouldn t hesitate long it there were.
He's a nice old boy."
Herewith he was about to spring into bed, when there came a
knock at the chamber door. The Seraph, in the relics of a
bodice and pyjamas. opened it. Enter Marmaduke Branscombe,
Esquire, alias the Wolf, bearing a bowl of punch !
"One glass more will do you good,' said the old Wolf.
"This night work is chilly, so I've brewed a wonderful bowl,
and ou'll sleep after it like Rip Van Winkle."
"' on my life," said the Seraph, " I think we have imbibed
almost enough since we began with that confounded glass of
Montrachet of Langton's. However, I don't object. It's only
twelve o'clock, I see."
It was noon, actually. Raphael wound up his watch. Then
the trio sat down to this untimely bowl of punch. It was a
miraculous concoction.
"Egad," said Stephen Langton, " it is worth while to have
lived in the mysterious East, in order to know how to produce
such a divine drink as this. It's Helen's nepenthe, by Zeus
Kronion." Stephen usually became classical when ebrious.
" It's not bad stuff," said the Seraph. " I was uite ready to.
slee before, but after this, hang me if I shan't go 0 like a top."
" ell, I thought it would do you-both good," said the old
Wolf. "The fact is, if you drink suiciently, your sleep won't
hurt you. After this, you'll wake without a headache."
" You must give us the receipt," said Langton; " a good bowl
of punch that cures the headache, instead of giving it, would be
a b easing."
They nished the punch, stran e to say; and Marmaduke
Branscombe took friendly leave 0 them, and in ten minutes
they slept. -

THE WOLP'S DEN. 223
Stephen Lnngton, the vonngest and less seasoned, was the rst
to awake. Notwithstanding the old Wolf s promise, he awoke
with a headachea splitting headache, that seemed capable of
splitting a tough planet into innitesimal fragments. More-
over, he had an awful insatiable thirsta thirst for a long deep
draught of icy water, such as one might get on some green moun-
tain side. And there fell upon him, like a nightmare, a longing
to be beside a wayside well not far from Idlechester, where the
crystal water perennially owed from beneath a pointed arch
through a gry ihon's mouth into a stone ivy-mantlcd trough,
whereon some cleric of old days had inscribed a Greek legend, sig-
nifying" Let all men praise the Lord." And it was utterly dark,
itch dark, dark as Erebus, so that he could not see even the vaguest
orm. And his memory wholly failed him as to where he was.
That the place was strange, he felt rather than knew. He was
in bedwhere? His perplexed memory struggled with the ast,
but could evoke from it nothing denite. He had no reco lec-
tion of the glass of Montrachet, or the Cellini ball, or the Wolf's
punch. Sleep had utterly subjugated him : he could only feel
that he had a tremendous headache, an unquenchable thirst, and
a nightmare-longing to know where he was.
If you have never been in a position of this kind, reader, let us
hope you never may. I have tried it. It is excessively un leasant.
tephen Langton got out of bed, and groped about t e room.
He found a windowdrew back the curtainsbut all was dark.
He threw open the casement, and the cool night air refreshed
him. He made a farther exploration, and touched the chill
marble of a washing apparatus. A great gulp from the water-
cara'e was ecstasy to his parched throat. Then he poured water
into the basin, and immersed his head with a mighty splash.
Wasn't it a luxury?
Having repeated this operation, and rubbed his hair dry, he
was groping again towards where he assumed his bed to beof
course entirely in the wrong directionwhen he heard a voice
exclaim" Who's there 7"
" Who the devil are you?" asked Stephen.
" Who am I? Come, that's good ! Fellow comes prowling
about in my room in the middle of the night, and washing at my
washstand, and then coolly asks me who I am ! Now, look here,
my friend; I'm not irascible by nature, but I shall shy a boot
at your head if you don't explain your conduct."
And Stephen could hear a hand searching for the threatened
missile. But he was still so obfuscated that he did not realise the
situation.
" Shy away !" he said. "Whoever you are, you'll be rather
clever to hit me in the dark. And I'll forgive you, if you'll tell
me where I am !"
" "'hy, confound you ! you're in my room, I tell you," ex-
claimed the Seraph, who verily believed himself at home in
Clarges Street. " Who the devi are you, I say i "

By this time Stephen had reached his bed, and comfortably
settled himself again.
"Well," he re lied. "as you seem so anxious to know, my
name's Stephen angton."
The Seraph, on whom the position of affairs ashed suddenly,
burst into laughter.
" By Jove," he exclaimed, "we're in the Den, and it's the
middle of the night apparently. I'll be hanged if I had not
forgotten all about it."
" Faith, so had I. And I've got a most confounded headache,
though the old beggar said the punch wouldn't give me one.
How do you feel 1 "
"Oh, I'm all right; rather hungry. He might have left us
some matches; but I suppose we must go to sleep again, and
wait for daylight." Which they did accordingly.
And when next Stephen Langton awoke, it was broad daylight.
The sun was apparently as near the zenith as he ever gets in
these latitudes. Stephen jumped out of bed, and looked vainly
for a pair of trousers wherein to encase his nether limbs. He
was com elled to be content with his velvet breachestempera
Charles I. The Seraph still slept seraphically. They talk of
the sleep which a good conscience gives, but nothing can rival
the calm repose of the man who has no conscience at all.
Ste hen roused his friend. Raphael, when thoroughly himself,
remarked1' Well, I never felt sleepier. What time is iti "
Both their watches had stop ed.
" Curious i" said the Serapli, "I wound up mine, I know.
Ring the bell, old fellow."
Stephen found a bell-pull, and rang loudly. There came no reply.
"I sup ose everybody else is aslee too," said the Seraph.
" Go and nd out, that's a good fellow. {fou've got some trousers,
and I haven't."
"Call these trousers! " said Stephen, disconsolately looking
down upon his purple breeches, beyond which protruded legs
worthy of Hyperion. " Suppose I meet your sisteror Isola !'
"Well, hang it," reasoned the Seraph, "you must do some-
thing. You don't seriously expect me to walk about in petti-
coats. I wonder what was done with the clothes I took off."
" I suppose I must venture," said Stephen.
So he went to the door, which, to his amazement, was fastened
on the outside.
" The old Wolf's locked us in l" he exclaimed.
" The devil!" cried Raphael, jum ing out of bed. "He's
been playing us a trick ; it's just like iim."
They broke open the door, which had been fastened by an
outside bolt. Then Stephen, as being the most decently attired,
started to ex lore, and went from room to room, nding nothing.
Whereupon a returned, reporting that to all appearance the
house was utterly deserted.

THE IVOLF'S DEN. 22$
" Here's a nice position," said the Seraph. "The old gentle-
man has played us a pretty trick. But where the deuce are
Claudia and Isola, and the servants? I hope there's something
in the house to eat, for I am diabolically eckish."
Further search made it obvious that t ere was not a creature
save themselves in the house. Marmaduke and his myrmidons
the PantherIsola and her neat little ancilla Lottywere all
gone. The clothes which they had taken o' to dress for Cellini's
masquerade had mysteriously disappeared. And here were
Raphael and Stephen, with nothing but their absurd costumes,
without a creature to send to Clarges Street or Jermyn Street.
" What shall we do i" asked Stephen Langton, perfectly
puzzled.
" Find something to eat and drink rst," said the Seraph.
About this there was slight difculty. The commissariat at
the Den was always excellent. A slight search in cupboard and
cellaret soon furnished an excellent breakfast.
' " The state of my appetite," said the Seraph, "leads me to
suppose we have been some time asleep. My highly-respectable
uncle must have administered opium in that rascally punch of
his. We must have had twenty-four hours' sleep, I fancy."
" How are we to get out of this? Catch a policeman."
" For Heaven's sake, no. Those fellows would take us for
thieves perhaps, and carry us off to Bow Street. That won't do.
I've cut my precious dress to pieces almost, or I think I might
walk to Clarges Street."
Fortune favoured them. There passed along the quiet street a
small boy, whistling"a little vulgar boy," such as swindled
Tom Ingoldsby. Stephen tapped cautiously at the window. The
younpster came across, and they managed to induce him to come
in. n a few minutes he was running away to Clarges Street
with a note to Louis. And when the faithful valet and Auguste
arrived with linen and clothing, the Seraph and Stephen were
astonished to nd that, instead of twenty-four, they had actually
passed forty-eight hours in bed. Cellini's ball was on Wednesday
evening ; it was noon on Thursday when they turned in ; it was
past noon on Saturday when they awoke to nd themselves alone
in the "'olfs Den.
" By the powers !" said the Seraph, " I never was played so
cool a trick. I wonder whether the old gentleman is mad or not 'i "
" I wonder what he has done with the ladies," said Stephen.
"Egad, yes. I'll tell you what. As he has deserted the Den,
we'll just take possession of it. What do you say 2"
"A capital notion. I sup ose he's sure to return here 1 "
" I should be sorry to pret icate anything at all denite about
him. He may have vanished as m steriously and abruptly as he
arrived. You found him rstperhaps you'll look for him now."
"Not if 1 know it. No, the plan is to encamp here, as you
propose, and await his return. But couldn't we serve him some
trick? Suppose we take lodgers, and admit nobody who can't

play on an instrument. If we got a houseful of tromunes and
ddles and drums, I think the old beggar would swear a little."
"Possibly," replied the Seraph. " But, as you and I think of
staying here, don t you think we might be inclined to swear rstl
No, that won't do.'
"We ought to think upon some way of giving him a Rolan-l

know; you're fond of poetic dreaming; go out of town for a
couple of days, and then come back to the Wolf's Den."
" What do you mean 'l "
" Never mind. Will you do it? The result may amuse you."
"Where the deuce am I to go?"
" Run down to ldlechester and Kingsleattalk to your aunt

return i" -
" The day after to-morrow, if you like."
" All right. There's a night mail. I'll tell Auguste to pack a
portmanteau, and be o' at once."
He did accordingly. He astonished the Half Moon at Idle-
chesterits ostlers at leastby descending at about two in the
morninLr from the box of the Quicksilver mail, and requiring a
bed. When, at about noon, he sat down to breakfast, Jack Win-
slow came in with the coffee.
" Well, Mr. Stephen," said she, " what mischief has brought you
here? We hear all sorts of dreadful tales of your doings in London."
" I am come to see if any young lady in Idlechester will accept
my hand and heart and the poor remains of my property," said
Stephen. "Now, Jack, don't chaff; tell me the newa."
" There's none. The bishop, they say, is to be made Arch-
bishop of York. They do talk of Mr. Walter Branscombe as
bishop. Your grandfather is looking very well. So is your aunt

"Not likely. Don't gossip, but send me the wine. Best
you've got."
The buxom barmaid departed with an ironicnl curtsey.
Stephen, exible and pliant, had taken very readily to Bor-
deaux and Burgundy for breakfast. There is nothing that com-
mences the day so divinely asa bottle of light wine. I venerate
ale and stout; but I recognise in Anacreon's favourite uid a
stimulus alien from stupefactiona ne poetic effervescent power
which the strongest ale of Edinburgh or the walled-up malt of
Mount Edgecombe and Woolley Hall cannot rival.
As Stephen drank his claret from a tumbler, and smoked a
lazy cigar, he reected on the circumstances which had brought
him there. Queer enough they were. Cellini's ball with its
adventure; the Wolf s return, and their long sleep ; Raphael's
resolve of revenge. Stephen wondered at the concatenation of
events which had made him almost a Branscombe. What
devilry there was among that strange race! What presence
of mind in Isola's ready dagger! What a grotesque hoax that
sleeping draught of the Wolf's! What did it mean'l Was
it merely the horse-play of this retired pirate, or had he any
sinister intentions in reference to the two girls? He could mean
no harm to his own daughter, surely. But what did he mean '1
Stephen Langtons was a temperament that was both equable
and excitable. He had periods of absolute lotus-eating laziness,
and periods of the most un uenchable restlessness. It' Odysseus
had accepted the throne o the Lotophngo'i he might have felt
very much as Stephen did. And he now found himself drawn
into a kind of eddy of lifea whirlpool, whence escape seemed
impracticable. These Branscombes had annexed him. At this
moment he could not understand what was to hap en in connec-
tion with Marmaduke and RaphaeL Would there be any tragi cal
development of this Aristophanic comedy? Extremes meet, we
know ; and the very wild comedy of highly excitable men often
ends in horrible tragedy. Even farce ends in tragedy sometimes
as when 0 Pope dies. What says Robert Browning 'l
" Of how some actor played Death on a stage
With pasteboard crown, sham orb, and tinselled dart,
And called himself the monarch of the world,
Then going in the tireroom afterward,
Because the play was done, to shift himself,
Got touched upon the sleeve familiarly
The moment he had shut the closet door
By Death himself. Thus God might touch a Pope
At unawares, ask what his baubles mean,
And whose part he presumed to play just now '2"
Stephen Langton, however, having promised not to reappear
in the uiet street till the day after tomorrow at earliest, dis-
missed t e Branscombe enigma, and, as well as he could, break-
fasted leisurely, and speculated as to what he should do with

himself. The result was pre much as follows. He aid I
visit to the belm'ed gardens w ere had been passed the appy
hours of his boyish wooing. To his visionary temperament it
was a delight to wander on those neglected lawns, under those
trees, where at every turn of the garden alleys it seemed that
brown-eyed, fresh-cheeked Anne Page, the baby beauty, ought to
dance out to meet him. Not there alone did Stephen Langton
dream. He wandered, as of old, in the shadow of the great
cathedral, and by the sinuous verge of the River Idle. He called
back that half-forgotten life of his, with its sordid and its poetic
moieties, as if Witney blanket were in some way worked in with
cloth of gold. Of course his grandfather's house and the tanyard
helped him in this. The old gentleman and the old gentleman's
progeny were little altered. When Stephen saw his Aunt Harriet
again, he thought of that doleful school of the Sadbrookes', with
all its mendicant misery. You cannot destroy the past Expe-
riences such as those of Stephen Langton's boyhood are indelible.
They pass into the imagination; they photograph themselves
upon the retina of your mind's eve, Horatio. Stephen found his
reminiscences almost painful. Olim. hac maminisu juvabit is not
invariably true.
Stephen Langton hired a horse and rode to Kingsleat. He
turne out of his way to visit the scene of his early boyhood's
afiction. To his extreme delight the old place was turned into
a farmhouse ; in the playground the wheat was green and our-
ishing; the schoolroomn0 great metamorphosiswas now a
threshing-oor. Stephen rode into the farmyard, and asked for
a glass of cider. Out came a buxom lass, just such as Mr. Barnes'
poet of the Dorset Doric describes so naturally
" So quick's a bird, so neat's a cat,
So cheerful in her nioter,
The best 0' maidens to come at
's a farmer's woldest daeter."
It was just Farmer Greenland's dinner-time; nothing would
induce him to let Stephen depart without taking a snack. So,
by way of a change from his town life, he found himself eating

in the hospitable society of a stout agriculturist, his stout and
smiling wife, and three very nice-looking oung females of the
race. It was like a dream. Had the Sadbrooke family really
dwelt in what was now a jolly farmhouse? Had he been tor-
tured there in his youth? He could not believe it.
"Well," thought Stephen to himself, when, having done jus-
tice to good Farmer Greenland's dinner, and taken friendly fare-
well of his daughters, he rode slowl towards Kingsleat, "I
wonder whether it would be a goo speculation to marry a
farmer's daughter. What would the Seraph say? He'd tell me
that she could never be a t companion for me, never under-
stand me, never enter into society with me. But hang it, after

lle rode into "ingsleat. He went rst to the public library,
but his old acquaintance, Mr. Lonsdale, was away on his annual
holiday. Then, having left his horse at the Mitre. he went to
the Rectory. lll~luck ursued him; the Rector and his daughter
had just started for Id echester. to dine at the Bishop's. So he
strolled moodily back to the Mitre, and studied the Idlechester
Chroan over some seltzer and brandy.
Suddenly, as he looked through the coffee-mom window on the
deserted street, Dr. Winter was visible descending the hill at his
usual swinging pace. Stephen snatched up his hat, and did his
best to overtake the doctor. It was no easy business. His accus-
tomed e, when not in a hurry. was ve miles an hour. He
was a light weight, sound of wind, with muscles of steel. Ste-
phen's long stride scarcely helped him much. But he did over-
take the rapid head-master at last. Then, it was difcult to bring
himself under his notice. Dr. Winter was the most absent of
men. He had a marvellous faculty of abstraction. He often,
striding along on his rapid walks, ignored the existence of most
intimate friends. Stephen could only attract his attention by
standing so directly in his way that he could as only by walk-
ing through him. But when he had attracted his attention, the
D0ctor was as courteous as possible.
As they stretched along the towing- th on the margin of Idle,
Dr. Winter found out a good deal of is young friend's state of
mind. " You are unsettled, Lnngton. I must give you a little
advice. Why don't you decide on a career? Why don't you
marry? You are not the man to be happy without occupation."
"If you will nd me a wife and a career, sir," said Langton
with a slight laugh, " I'll do my best to follow your advice."
" Well, I know something of your adventures. I am not sur-
prised at your reluctance to marry. But surely you can nd
some one to console you. As to career, I always thought you
were likely to do something in literature."
" I cannot nd t topics, or satisfy myself with my treatment.
That is what perplexes me. Now, your nephew Humphrey
always seems to do perfectly what the public wants."
"Humphrey is a humbug, Mr. Langton. There is nothing
real about him. He writes successful articles because he is un-
principled and insincere. He can adapt himself to anything,
avin no denite faith. But stay and dine with me, Mr. Lang-
ton. '11 give you some good advice, and better port wineand
then I'll ask you for your advice."" Mine !"
"Yes. Yours is not unlikely to be good, in reference to a
point which I have been all day puzzling myself to determine.
So you shall come home with me and give. it.'
They went, accordingly ; and the Doctor and his young friend
let down to an excellent simple dinner. It was a treat to listen

tn Dr. Winter's converse. It was always fresh and keen. He
looked on life from an original point of view. Moreover, as an
experienced schoolmaster, with a faculty for nding out the
characteristics of youthful intellects, and a magnetic inuence
over them, he found a pleasure in studying his guest. He did
not disdain the crudities and enthusiasms of youth. He found
real pleasure in eliciting Stephen Langton's mental perplexities,
and in giving him counsel. He pitied a ne young fellow, born
among barbarians, left to educate himself, and inextricably asso-
ciated with a race of lunatics.
" If only," said Ste hen Langton, " I had been fortunate
enough to get a rational) education ; if I had been sent to Kings-
leat Grammar School, I should not have been so incapable as I
now feel myself. I have never received either affection or cul-
ture. A boy wants two hel sa mother and a schoolmaster. I
had neither. I was surroun ed all through my youth with people
whom I could not understand, and who could not understand me,
except when I visited Mr. Page ; and having had no denite guill-
ance, I am now unable to determine what I ought to do. I am
unable to separate myself from the Branscombes, who seem des-
tined to exercise a mysterious inuence over me. I cannot resolve
on any occupation that will keep me out of mischief. I just pass
my time in amusing myself, Dr. Winterthat is all."
" There is no greater mistake," said the Doctor. " Some French-
man has said "Dr. Winter read everything" La jouissancs ma
parait le but de la vie, et la smle chose utile au monde. A miser-
able mistake of the poor idiot' -at least when we connect it with
his animal longing for wine and women and the like. Enjoy-
ment, doubtless, is noble when he who enjoys can enjoy nothing
ignoble. If I were capable of envy," continued the Doctor, who
had got on his hobby, and was riding it with enthusiasm, " I
might envy Shakespeare or Kepler, Newton or Sir Humphrey in
some supreme moment of imagination, or invention, or discovery.
But depend upon it, Mr. Langton, to live for amusement or for
mere comfort, is a fatal erroran error that reduces a man to the
level of a woman ora dog."
Stephen laughed at the Doctor's vehemence, and sipped his
portundeniable winewith the furtive reection thatt e " se-
vere Winter " did not wholly disdain comfort, or even luxury.
" I wish you would tell me what to do, Doctor," he said.
" I never attempt impossibilities," responded the headmaster
quietly. " In your especial case I suspect feminine entangle-
ments" (Stephen blushed); "and I can only tell you to follow
the counsels of your own conscience. You know best whether
the life you now live satises you. I fancy not. You are indepen-
dent, and can easily break away from it by starting to travel. It
must rest with you to resolve whether this would be wise or not."
" Vida-o meliora roboque, detm'ora sequor," quoted Stephen.
" Ah 1" laugheda the Doctor, " that bit of classicality is a poor
excuse. Better, however, to belong to the miserable half-and-

those holder mortals who rasth exelaini. Evil, be t/mu my good!"
" 1 don't know," said Stephen. " I abhor my own mediocrity.
I'd rather be an absolute scoundrel, like " " Whom 1"
"Well, I may say like any of the Branscombes. My friend
Raphael is an excellent instance. He is utterly devoid of con-
science. He would not murder, perhaps; but he would very
coolly kill a man in a duel. He would not steal perhaps, but he
would incur any amount of debt that he could not pay. He
would not"
" You call that man your friend," interrupted the head-master.
"I am ashamed of you."
"Upon my honour, I can't help it," replied Stephen. "1 can't
get free from him. He fascinates me."
" Pshaw ! You have no strenth of mind. Travel ! Don't
waste your time in London upon what that man calls amusement.
Get out of his reach if you can't resist his inuence. Go abroad
;;0 to J erichogo to the Antipodes or the South Polerather
than waste your life as you are now wasting it."
" I'll think of your advice," said Stephen.
" Nobody ever took good advice," said Dr. Winter. "Nobody.
I'm an old fool to give it you. If you were a pupil of mine I
shouldn't advise youI should just og ou. You'll get your
ogging, my young friend, from harsher ands than mine, and
with a sharper implement of castigation."
"I don't doubt it," said Stephen.
"Nobod ever took good advice," repeated the head-master.
"Nobody, y Zeus Kronion. Bad advice is wingedwinged to
the fabulous s ed of those steam coaches they are just talking
of. Neverthe ess, I am about to ask yours. Perhaps your young
eyes will see more clearly than my old ones through a mist of
difculty which besets me. You can keep a secret, I am sure."
" I cam and will."
" I am asked to be Bishop of Idlechester. Dr. Bythesea is to
be translated to York. The reaon why I am asked, so far as I
can guess it, is curious. Some years ago I thwarted the Duke of
Axminster. who is, you know, an inuential member of the
Cabinet. He is a singularly haughty man. I have reason to
believe that it is by his special desire this offer comes to me.
He is reported to have said that I was the only man who had
ever opposed him, and that therefore I deserved to be something
better than a schoolmaster."
" He reminds me of Charles the Second," said Stephen.
"What is that l "
' I: happened at Winchester, I think. King Charles was
building a palace there, and brought Nell Gwynne down with
him. A certain canon of the cathedral declined to let her stay at
his house. The king gave the next vacant bishopric to the good
little man who wouldn't receive poor Nell. It was Bishop Ken."
"I have heard the story," said Dr. Winter. "The parallel is

fair. I have no objection to accept the offer on account of the
motive. But I doubt whether I am fated to be a bishop. And
I know I'm a pretty good schoolmaster."
"A man who is a good schoolmaster is t for anything," said
Stephen.
"That may be. But suppose that I can do more good as a
schoolmaster than I could as a bishop."
" Don't you think," urged Stephen, " that it is possible for the
best of schoolmasters to be a schoolmaster too long? I fancy all
minds that are worth anything are extremely versatile, and ought
not to be worked in a perpetual routine. For my own part, I
should like to be a great schoolmaster, like yourself, for a few
prosperous yearsand then to be a bishopand then to be a
general in the armyand then prime ministerand then a great
poet or astronomerand so on.'
"Either you are treating the uestion with irony, my young
friend," said the Doctor, delicate y cracking a lbert, "or you
are striving to show the incompatibility of Episcopus with Ludi-
magister. To live a dozen lives in one is not possible; happy
the man who can live one rightly."
"I thought," said Stephen, " that there was a report that Mr.
Branscombe was to be bisho ."
" Well, that is another pornt. It seems to have been an under-
stood thing that the vacancy would be his; and doubtless, if I
refuse, the offer will be made to him. I don't like to disappoint
him. His claims are far greater than mine; he is on intimate
terms with Lord Cheiron ; and but for that little affair with the
Duke of Axminster, the offer would never have reached me. I
don't much like the look of being made a bishop for treading on
the tenderest come of a duke."
" I would accept," said Stephen, briey and oracularly.
The doctor sat for some time silent, speculating on the chan e
from the head-master's desk to the episcopal throne in that nubile
old cathedral of Idlechester. At last, after lling for himself a
glass of port, which he eyed curiously against the light, examining
its beeswing, and then drank with evident satisfaction, Dr. Winter
said-
"I will take your advice. Ring for coffee, my youn friend,
and then I'll write my letter of acce tance. You shal post it
'ourself, that I may have no chance 0 altering my mind.'

This) doctor wrote his letter; Ste hen took it away with him,
and dropped it at the post ofce as e went to the Mitre. Then
he ordered his horse, and rode back to the Half Moon at Idle-
chester. The embryo prelate's hours were early; Stephen was
back at his quarters before midnight. In the parlour, to which
he paid a visit, he found his grandfather and one of his uncles,
and several of their cronies, smoking and drinking hot spirit and
water, with that solemn sedulity which nobly characterises the

great British tradesmen. He spent a quarter of an hour with
them; then, taking refuge in his awn room, he indulged in a
meditative monologue on the value of education. It was curious,
certainly. These people were of his own blood, but they and he
could not get on together with satisfaction. They were mani-
festly uneasy in his presence, while he was simply bored.
If you are worth anything, 0 readerand if you are not, on

I say, you have got a dog. Look at himinto his eyes, as you
would look into human eyes that you love. He turns from you ;
he is unhappy ; if you persist, he gets up and walks away. So
with the uneducated, undeveloped man. The glance of nous
uutres makes him uncomfortable. His half-unconscious inferiority
betrays itself when you look at himwhen you s eak to him.
The man whom educated intelligence has raised a ve those of
his own blood, has this forced upon him with emphasis.
I suppose thisnot the canine part of it roves that every-
body ought to be educated. In which case, w o is to cart dung
and criticise novels? I fear this is Utopian. Starved souls must
be worse than starved bodies, however.
The next morning Stephen Langton returned to London.
Pleasant was his early drive through the sweet country, on the
hlnshful verge of summer. Yet ad the trees their virginal
green ; yet the larks, blithe spirits, invisible in the ether, made
music everywhere; yet the blackbird uted in the cherry orchards,
and the thrush sang anthems in the dense elm leafage ; yet lay
upon the leafy world the fresh delicious air of spring. The world
was youngat least to Stephen so it seemed. As four ying
horses whirled him Londonward, he felt as if all the scenes
through which he passed had youth and freshnesswhile he
alone was old and weary and stale.
And he made a resolve : and that was, to abandon the stupid
empty course of life to which he had become accustomedto
begin a new erato nd something to do if he could not nd
somebody to love, and to do it resolutelyto make a fresh start,
synchronous with Dr. Winter's episcopation.
We shall see how he kept his resolve.
"'hen Stephen had washed from himself the soil of travel, and
refreshed himself thereafter, he started for the quiet street. And
I will say this for the erratic genius of the Branscombeshe was
astonished. As he turned into the street by the end most remote
from the house rst known to him as Isola's, he saw that some-
thing had occurred. The house was altered. Previously quiet
and subdued, it seemed to have suddenly thrown out a couple
of how windows. Over the doorway was suspended something
strangely like a sign. An in uisitive crowd obstructed not only
the avement, but in some egree the carriage way, and a few
inte igent members of the new olice were looking on.
Stephen approached. As he id so, it appeared that the sign

swung over the entrance wasa wolf ! A wolfnot sculptured,
but stuffed, and stuffed by an artist evidently; and looking almost
alive. Right above the doorway appeared in large gold letters
THE womr's DEN.
But the windows ! There was a room on each side the passage.
The fronts of these had been cleared away, and wide bow win-
dows put in. Those windows were lled with cages, and in the
cages were all sorts of animals, birds, even reptiles. It was a
grotesque menagerie. Where in the world Raphael Branscombe
could, in two days, have collected such a strange mixture of
creatureschimpanzee and lynx, boa-constrictor and vulture,
Australian magpie and Esquimaux dogwas an enigma to
Stephen Langton.
"Well," he quietly ejaculated, "these Branscombes are all
mad together." 
The scene within was even more remarkable. Both walls of
the passage had been removed, and the two front rooms made
into a good-sized shop. When he entered, Stephen was con-
fronted by an odd gurea dwarf, very short, very stout, very
hairy about the face, and looking altogether almost inhuman.
This grotesque creature was the guardian of a motley collection
there were lions, tigers, panthers, ostriches, kanoaroos, wom-
bats ; it was a wonder how so many animals could be packed in
their cages into so small a space.
Stephen Langton certainly was surprised.
He inquired for Mr. Ra hael Branscombe. That gentleman
was entirely unknown. '1 e grotesque dwarf, whose English
was strangely alloyed by some atoz's to Ste hen utterly alien,
maintained entire ignorance of t e Seraph. ut when Stephen's
state of wonderment had lasted long enough, a door at the back
suddenly opened, and Raphael a posted for a moment, beckon
ing; and Stephen, of course, followed him. He was led to a
small back room on the rst oor, with a couple of chairs in it,
and a great number of small monkeys in cages. '
" Have a cigar, old boy," said the Seraph ; " you'll never stand
the stench if you don't smoke."
Ste hen obe ed. Then he said
" hat the euce does all this mean 2 "
" Sur rised, eh "l" asked the Seraph.
" Rat er, certainly."
" Well, if you are surprised, how will the old Wolf feel when

" Astounded. I should think. But how in the world have you
managed the affair? Where did you get all these infernal beasts l"

"Do you mean to wait in this vile entourage of eluvia till

" 1 don't know what else to do. I would not miss his advent
for a. thousand pounds."
" Couldn't we take lodgings just opposite l " suggested Stephen.
" That's what Theodore Hook did in Bernei's Street."
" Well, that's a good notion," replied the Seraph. " Suppose
you go across and negotiate? They are nearly all lodging-houses
in this street." This little affair was soon arranged.
" You must take care of yourself, Wolf," said the Seraph to the
dwarf. " The old gentleman will come back in a towering rage,
and want to murder you."
" Let him try," snarled the troglodyte, glaring ercely.
Raphael and Ste hen, established in the rst oor of the op-
posite house, watc ed by turns for the arrival of Marmaduke
ranscombe. Several days passed, and they did not venture to
leave their quarters, for fear of missing him. Their patience was
rewarded at length.
A travelling carriage with four horses pulled up in front of
the \Volf's Den at about one o'clock. The two friends were just
at luncheon, which meal they conducted close to a window, so as
to command the situation.
" Here he is at last l" ejaculated the Seraph. There he was.
The postilions had thrown the horses on their haunches, for
Marmaduke had accustomed them to vigorous velocity. One of
his myrmidons, descending from the front seat, opened the car-
riage door. Out came the old pirate, and looked up at the house,
and was silent. There's a Yankee story of poor President Lincoln
somewhat to this e'ect :A profane ruian, imaginative in his
oaths, suddenly got into some unprecedented x. An expectant
audience surrounded him, anticipating boundless blasphemy.
But he said no word ; he could not do justice to the sub'ect.
So with the old \Volf. So thoroughly abbergaste was he,
that his fair companions, Isola and Claudia, had both reached the
pavement before he had got together voice enough for a remark.
" Why, papal""Why. uncle!" cried a couple of charming
voices. The windows of the opposite rst oor were open, and
their silver surprise travelled easily across.
" By Jove, this is rich," said Stephen Langton.
Choleric was the 01d Wolf am he entered the wild beast shop.
Loud and deep was his voice as he exclaimed
"What does this mean '3"

duce, but which was quite intelligible to Marmaduke Branscombe,

would be better than some men. That pantherthe ladies are

killed a boy once, but don't say anything about it, please. She is
cheap. I can sell her for a hundred pounds. She would defend
you, Senora," he said, looking at the panther's namesake.
" Stop this foulery / " thundered Marmaduke. " What the devil
is the meaning of my house being turned into this confounded
bear-garden? You're a robber and a scoundrel. I've a great
mind to murder you." With which utterance the erce old man
advanced towards the dwarf menagerie-keeper in a threatening
attitude. The troglodyte opened Wide eyes, and a wider mouth,
and drew from his breast a pistol. Things looked serious. Prac-
tical jokes too often end seriously.
" Papa ! " exclaimed the argent voice of Isola, " didn't you tell
us you had played Raphael a trick'l You may be sure he has
played you t is trick in return."
The old Wolf acquired sudden enlightenment; and at this
point the two conspirators entered the shop, and accosted the
adies with courteous em easement.
Marmaduke Branscom burst into prodigious laughter.
"You're too much for me, my bo ," he said to the Seraph.
" You're a Branscombe. By Heaven, almost thought I was mad,
or dreaming; but now, as you have turned my house upside
down, perhaps you'll tell me where I'm to go 2 "
"Come to Clarges Street," said the Seraph. "There's plenty
of room for you there; but won't you take a chimpanzee or a
panther with you 'l"
They went on to Clarges Street, and were soon comfortably
established there.

" Well," laughed Isola, " 1 think you ha very much the best
of it. Papa won't try to play any more tricks upon you for a day
or two."
"No," growled the Wolf, taking his pi e from his mouth;
" I'll be hanged if I do ! Perhaps you'll te 1 me what I'm to do
with that house, now you've turned it into a den of lions 'l "
" Go and live there, upa, like Daniel," said Isola.
"I think the fellow l've put in will be a capital tenant," said
the Seraph; " and a shop of that kind is rather wanted in the
neighbourhood. Better let him stay."

Claudia had met Sir Arthur Willesden at Brighton, and con-
tinued her flirtation. Matters indeed were beginning to get
serious. She had succeeded in convincing him that she meant
something; he, having had that conviction thrust through his
taurme brow, pushed with prodigious obstinacy against all ob-
stacles. Claudia felt in danger.
Did she like Sir Arthur"! Was he the strong man with the
governing hand whom her fancy painted him 1 Did he love her?
Could they possibly assimilate in tastes and occupations? The
poor Panther perplexed her~elf perpetually with endless ques-
tionings of this and other kinds. She found no answers. She
only found that he laid persistent siege to herthat he looked on
her as his propertythat he would not leave her alone.
How oftenah, how oftenshe sorrowed over the poetic boy
whose love she had thrown away !
As to Stephen, when he separated that evening from his friends,
and shut himself up in his Jermyn Street sanctuary, he became
seriously meditative. What a gulf was xed between the calm
wisdom of Dr. Winter and the mad freaks of this wild race of
Branscombe ! Well. he was a boy yet, almost ; he would sepa-
rate himself from these people; he would try another life
perhaps even another love. Oh, delicious thought ! Where
dwelt the beautiful creature who would give him the virgin touch
of her lip, the virgin blush of her heart? Surely he was not
donmed to loneliness because his truth had been foiled by frailty
and falsehoodsurely life had its treasure awaiting him yet !
But where to seek 'iNo, mere search would be futile. He '
must qualify himself for love by work; he was empty and use-
less nowa mere rotary of pleasurea being unlovahle by any
woman whose love was worth possession. What should he do to
attain manhood of mind 7 How should he conquer his virility?
To be like Humphrey, of some sordid profession, seemed (llSJlSt-
ing to him ; while he had modesty enough to believe that, though
he longed to be a poet, he did not possess the vision and the
faculty divine ; yet to think, to observe, to writeto describe, if
unable to createthis was the thirst of his soul. He would travel.
It seemed to him, as it has seemed to thousands, that if he sought
he must nd. At the very least, if the love for which he ined
were impossible, innchievable, and if to be a poet were utter y be-
yond him, he might turn travel to some serious literary import.
In the advta of his heart he believed in the possibility of a.

Langton saw in the far-distance a delicious creature whom he

his guess must have successful issuelittle knowing that to chase
such a hantom of the imagination is like attemptin to reach

Better to stay at home and wait till that which you long for
descends upon you with sudden sweetness. Better to be calm
and patient, and surely the very strength of your thirst will make
the fountain ow. There are some things which an manany
vulgar man indeedmay gain. Gold is one: he as only to
enter upon a trade, to work from sunrise to sunset, to be perfectly
honest and erfectly unscrupulous; he will die a mil ionaire.
Fame is anot er; if it be literary fame he requires, let him only
write books which are slightly stupid and singularly religious;
let him combine Tupper with A. K. H. B., infusing a slight touch
of S urgeon-and-water ; he will be famous, and Good Words and

It is not a thing to be gained by utter abnegation of manhood-

CHAPTER XXVII.
moanLL's APPOINTMENT.
I HOPE I have not been hard upon Humphrey Morll. He
had one great object in lifehis own advancement. He was
marvellous in perspicacity and manipulation. He could see at a
glance what was to be done, and could do it. This is a most
Valuable faculty. He made no mistakes. He never longed for
the impossible. He saw in the world an arena where few men
were as strong as himself, and he threw himself into it to win
what prizes were open to him. And he won prizes. He had
many qualications. Beyond his native ability, which was un-
usually great, and the power of which he could exactly estimate,
he had his wife's fortune and his uncle's position. For Dr. Winter
was Bishop-designate of Idlechester.
And it so hap ened that the severe and conscientious head-
master who woul not, after the elopement, have lifted a nger
to aid the nephew who had acted with dishonour, was the means
of his advancement. The Duke of Axminster bein the Diony-
sius of Kingsleat, had naturally a Dionysian ear. T 6 Duke was
the proudest of men, but he was also a gentleman. He was an ry

mentary inuence. He was angrier still when, desiring to expel
lllr. Lonsdnlc from his position at the Kingsleat library, he found
an obscure schoolmaster a man who not only resided his ducal
will, but drunk his choicest claret, and then wrote a Greek epigram
upon him. But in time the Duke grew calm, and saw the injus-
tice oi his own desires. He saw that if he had ousted froln the
librarianship the blameless Lonsdale, he should have regretted it
to the end of his ducal days. He felt truly grateful to Dr. Winter
for the resolute resistance which had prevented him from making
afool of himself. He recognised in the obstinate head-master,
who treated a Duke of Axminster with contempt, a man of un-
usual calibre. thence it hap ened that one day, at a Cabinet
Council, Cheiron mentioning t at the Archbishop of York was
ju~t dead, and that he thought of romoting Bisho Bythesea,
the Duke immediately thought, "Wliat a capital his op Winter
would make in these days when most bishops are old women !"
And as Axminster was a man to whom the First Minister
would not think of refusing such a mere trie as the disposal of
a bisho ric, Dr. Winter got the offer. And Stephen Langton
coerced to accept it.
Now the Dionysian ear had brought to the Duke the informa-
tion that Dr. \Vinter had a nephewa. very romising onng
man. Of the elopement also rumour had reaclied him; ut it
was not likely to occur to him that any man would quarrel with
his nephew for running away with two or three thousand a-year.
That is virtue too severe. So, having maile up his mind to do
what he could for Dr. Winter, with that facile generosit which
pertains to great princes who cannot feel the cost of anyt ing, he
put Morll on his list for an appointment. Whence it happened
that the young man was diverted from that high road to the
"'oolsack which he had chosen, by an offer of a temporary ap-
pointment abroad, which would bring him both reputation and
money, and at the termination whereof the Government would,
of course, provide him with other remunerative occupation. Find-
ing that it would rather advance than retard him in his career,
Humphrey Morll accepted.
This keen-sighted man did not understand womenleast of all -
his wife. Balzac has remarked that even the Creator of women
cannot understand them; perhaps he is right. Humphrey, when
he persuaded Anne Page to elope with him, did it just as he
would have made a strong move in the game of chess. He did
net trouble himself to analyse the subtle complex motives at
work even in that childish breast to induce her to go with him.
He did not look into the future, with any vague doubt as to whe-
ther the girl who ran away to marriage might hereafter wish to
run away from marriage. Humphrey had one uality, which was
a source of weakness as well as strengthcon dence in himself.
This strengthened him when he had to enter the arena of intel-
lectual strife; but it weakened him when dealing with a woman.
He could not believe that a woman would betray him.

:40 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
As most of Anne's intercourse with the Seraph occurred during
he: visits to Claudia in Clarges Street, Humphrey, absorbed in
business, knew nothing of it. But even her more daring esca-
ades did not come to his co 'sance. He heard nothing of the
.ite nights out which had comcided with his absence on affairs.
The servants pitied the pretty childish Mrs. Moriill, and did not
dream of informing against her. They disliked their master,
whose reserve and inexibility were not intended for servile
popularity. Hence happened it that he heard nothing of the im-
proprieties to which the Seraph had cruelly forced his poor little
victim, and fully believed that she was as innocent a creature as
when he stole her from Kingsleat Rectory. His high opinion of
himself made him blind to the possibilities which lay around him.
He looked on his wife as a child still ; and, when he had accepted
an appointment which took him at once to Constantinople, he
announced to his wife, with the utmost coolness, his intention
of going and taking her with him.
Women in love are Wonderful in their power of dissimulation.
She received the announcement with as much coolness apparently
as he gave it with. But the thought of Raphael conferred upon
her this factitious strength. She believed in the power of the
man whom she loved to save her from exile.
Humphrey Morll, having quietly one evening told her his
intentions, went out to meet some friends. He spent very few
evenings at home. He wasted no time, and made even his triing
dissipations useful.
When he was gone, poor little Anne took ight to her own
room and threw herself with utter abandonment upon a couch,
burying her sweet brown-tressed head in her tiny white hands,
and sobbing without restraint.
"How cruel he is l" she muttered. "How wicked he is!
Why did he take me away from Kingsleat'l He doesn't love me,
I knowand I hate him. Yes ; I do. I won't go to Constanti~
nople. I'd rather kill myself." And so onad libitum.
And, as she lay there, crushed into strange cares, thinking
wild thoughts, sobbing mad resolvesex uisitely beautiful so
far as you could see any part of herwifii brown dishevelled
hair over plump white shoulders, and white hands clenching
themselves pinksome one catches her; some one had entered
the room. quietly, and closed the door, and now stood quietly, a
spectator of her childish grief, with a. smile of amusement on his
lip. Presently he stepped forward, raised her suddenly in his
strong arms from the couch, and, seating himself there, looked
laughingly into her tearful and astonished face.
" What is the matter with my little pet 'l" asked Raphael
Branscombe, and then kissed her on the eyelids.
She told him her grief.
" Well, child, you'll have a very nice trip. Constantinople is
a charming place. Perhaps I may come and see you there. '
First she tried, in her indignation, to escape from the grasp of

steel which held her. This was vain ; so she nestled closer to
him, and whispered" I 'm not going."
" Wives must obey their husbands," he said. " 1 don't on-
courage rebellion. You'll enjoy it, In darling."
" 1 shall come to you," she said with serious emphasis.
" Amusing !" thought the Seraph. "The little girl's mum.
What's to be done with herl"
" 0 Raphael t" she exclaimed, suddenly slipping from be-
tween his arms and gliding to the oor at his feet, "I cannot
leave you. I cannotI cannotI cannot. I love you."
She iterated and reiterated these phrases with inexhau>tible
pertinacity. Raphael raised her from the ground, and walked up
and down the room in reective mood. At last he said-
" My dear child, you are such a mere girl that I doubt whether
you know our ova: mind."
" Yes ; fdo, I do, I do," she interrupted eagerly.
"Well, you may, child. But you don't know the result of
what you ask. Now, wait a minute, and calm yourselfa moment,
and think."
He passed a very steady hand over her ushed forehead, as if
to tranquillise her by some mametism of touch.
" If you leave your husband,' he said, " you throw away your
life. You will have a few weeks or months of delight with me
weeks most likelyand then you will die, or wish to die. Can
you throw away a comfortable home for a month or two of plea-
sure'l It is absurd, child. It is because I like you, and pity
you, that I tell you so."
"I shall come to you," she repeated.
" By Jove," thought the Seraph to himself, " what a singularly
moral man I am, and didn't know it ! If I were to go into the
Chandos to-night, and tell the fellows that the rettiest woman
in London (bar one) had offered to run away with me, and 1 had
declined, I wonder who would believe it? 'Pon my life, though,
I should like to save this little thing. She's such a young bird.
What the devil shall I do 7 "
Thus soliloquised the Seraph in the bed-chamber which should
have been sacred to Humphrey MOI'll, while that learned gentle-
man was supping with some distinguished barristers, and that
gentleman's charming little wife was awaiting the Seraph's de-
cision with anxiet as terrible as that of Esther the Queen in the
inner court of the ing's house when she had come unbidden into
the resence of Ahasuerus.
" ell," he said at last, " you must have your way, I suppose.
Give me due notice of Mortill's movements. If you are quite
determined to ruin yourself, why should I interfere! But you
can't mean it."
" I do mean it," she said. " I cannot live with that man ; I
despise him; I hate him. You have made me love youyou
know you have. Raphael, vou must not desert me."
This little Anne, for the rst time in her life, had a will of her

own. Never before, I suppose, had she felt the real passion of
love. For Stephen Langton it was only a child's fancy ; and she
had run away with Humphrey Morll from a mere wish to escape
Claudia's tyranny ; but the Seraph had really awakened her
sleeping hearthad created a woman where there was but a girl
beforehad lighted the inextinguishable volcano which exists
beneath the iciest and calmest maideuhood.
He was in no deme loth to take the consequences, only he
really pitied the little girl. He had not realised the fact that she
was more than a child. He would have had no compunction in
taking away a queenlier creature, but he had been merely playing
with Anne, whom he regarded as a baby and toy. However, he
now discovered that he was wrongthat Lilliput may have its
Cleopatra. So, like the highl practical man that he had alWays
been, he reected on the detai s of the affair. Morll might want
to ght himhe didn't care about that; or might go to law
well, the Branscombes could afford a few thousands now. He
should by and by, of course, get tired of the little runaway, and
then he must nd her a place where she could live in comfortable
seclusion. All these matters passed ra idly yet lucidly through
his mind during the few moments in w ich he kept Mrs. Morll
in suspense. One feeling which he had was pleasure at annoy-
ing Morll, alloyed, however, by the impression that the young
lawyer would care little about his wife so long as he kept his
wife's money. However, that couldn't be helped ; he had com-
menced the adventure, and must carry it to its issue, and he
accordingly did not leave Mrs. Morll until he had arranved to
take her away from her husband's house about an hour efore
the time that should be xed for that husband's de arture. The
prospect of the adventure delighted the Seraph. othing did he
so thoroughly enjoy as a. " neat thing " of this sort.

the Victory alongside General Bonanarte's ship! There would
have been no Waterloo. But the g ory was reserved for one of
calmer tem \er than the victor of Trafalgar. With a longing as
extreme as lNelson's to meet Bonaparte on the sea, longed Stephen
for love. Perchance, had he been an admiral, had there been war.
had there been "the meanest man of men," as Wordsworth well
calls Napoleon, to thwart in his career of end. Stephen would have
longed to ght. But now he longed for true love. Blame him not.
"Were there more Emmas, there would be more Nelsons." The
man who can love well in peace, can ght well when there is war.
Stephen Langton went down to the Chandos to dine on the
very evening that the Seraph had devoted to Mrs. Morll. The
rst man he saw was Phil Palliserbetter known among his
cronies as Seagull Palliser. Phil was the m0st resolute of yachts-
nien. He he t a schooner yacht called the Seagull, at Cowes, and
he devoted himself to that acht. His relations, a good family,
were anxious that he shoul make a gure in the world, and he
had the materials ; he had money and he had brains; but Phil
had fallen in love with his yacht. and it was obvious that nothing
short of shipwreck would care him. Indeed, I doubt if an ordi-
nary shipwreck would have had that effect. Possiblv, if he had
been cast away in the very centre of the Pacic, and com elled
to cast lots with his comrades who should eat whom, Seagu l Pal-
liser would have 'ven up yachting. I doubt if anything else
would have cured im. He and Stephen chaucing to be without
other acquaintances, dined tte-d-tle. Of course, over the claret,
they became frightfully condential; and Langton told Palliser
that he was weary of his unoccupied life, that he couldn't stand
it any longer, that he meant to travel in search of a career.
"Ah," said Phil, "1 like that. Travel in search of a career '
Tell you what, old boy, I've got a careerwhich is, to travel."
Stephen answered not, but sipped his wine.
"Look here," resumed Palliser, " I'm 011' on a yachting trip-
going to the Mediterranean. Can't matter to you where you go.
Better go with me." -
" When are you off '1 " asked Stephen.
"When you like. To-morrow, if you like. I've been waiting
for a fellow to go with. Fellows won't leave London this time of
year, confounded fools."
"It would suit me very well," said Stephen. " To-morrow is
rather sharp, but I shall be uite ready by the day alter."
"Give us your hand, old 0y," said Seagull Palliser. " Like
your style. I do. Tell you what, I'll go down to-morrow morning
no, by Jove, I'll catch the Southam ton mail to'nightheaps
of time. You come on to Cowes and ring your traps as soon as
you're ready. That do 'l"" Perfectly."
Hence was it that Stephen Langton, having taken leave of his
friends among the Branscoiubesand I assure you he did not
forget Isola-found himself, with his luggage, and his servant

vn'thin forty-eight hours of the colloqu briey recorded above.
And Phil Palliser was not the man to let the grass grow under
his feetassuming that to be a marine possibility. It may be
asked, how in the world could Stephen ex ct, by joining an
enthusiastic yachtsman, to realise his dream in Was he goin in
for a mermaid? Well, in the rst place, Stephen had resolved
to travel, and rather superstitiously jumped at the rst offer.
And, secondly, it is to be observed that yachtsmen occasionally
g0 ashore, and have been known to make havoc among feminine
susceptibilities under such circumstances. I am not goin" to
follow Seagull Palliser and Stephen Lailgtou through all t Icir
adventures in the Midland Sea. One adventure shall suice.
Stephen was lying in the stern smoking, with no companion save
Palliser's big Newfoundland dog, an animal that had taken a
great fancy to him. As he lay in one of those satised dreamy
moods which often come to the poetic tern rament, his eyes half
closed from very weariness of the intense lue of sea and sky, it
seemed to him that he sawvery far offRaphael Branscombe
pacin<7 the sea-shore with a woman indescribany beautiful, though
of me ancholy beauty. Not Anne Page, certainly ; a creature of
stranger and more poetic charm. The vivid fancy was interrupted
by a clamour of voices ; he opened his eyes and sprang to his
feet, and found that the sky was suddenly overclouded, that a-
storm had arisen ; he heard Phil Palliser exclaim to the clever
young mariner who managed his yacht" Where are we 1"
" Off Monte Cristo, sir."
" Is there any harbourage, do you know? "
" I've heard it's pretty fair, sir. We'd better try it. With this
wind we can't make Elba."
So the Seagull ran into the harbour of the little islet of Monte
Cristo, nine miles in circuit, concerning which our beloved enter-
tainer, Alexandre Dumas, has built up so deliciously absurd a
romance. And the next day Langton and Palliser explored the
island. They found the ruins of a convent; many caverns; a
populous colony of wild goats. I need hardly say that they
found no treasures, nor even anybody to offer them the enchanted
hachish. Wherefore, when the gale had subsided, they thought
they would visit the birthplace of Napoleon, and evening saw
the Seagull at anchor in the bay of Ajaccio.
Life is made up of coincidencesespecially the life of a man
like Stephen Langton. When the beautiful Seagull ran into that
noble gulf where lie the Bloody Islands, his heart throbbed as he
looked upon the lofty mountains which he had never beheld be-
fore. Their forms seemed familiar to him. Had he beheld them
in dreams? When they ran ashorewhen they stood in the chief
street, named after Napoleon, and ornamented by an avenue of
orange-treeswhen they wandered through the Place dn Dia-
mant, overlooking the sapphire waters of the bayStephen felt in
his breast a uttering lizil"- rescient warning of something strange
to come. Eventide arrivci ; after an excellent Corsican dinner

the two yachtsmen loitered on the Place, among a crowd of pro-
menadei-s, the women wearing the black fuldetta, suggestive of
mvstery and intrigue, while a military band played lively airs.
There came upon Stephen the conviction-" have some one to
meet in this place." As he stood that night on the seawall, inhal-
ing the delicious breath of the Wooing West, watching the reex
of the Milky "'ay and the Evening Star (star of love) in the
phosphorescent waters of the gulf, watching point after point of
ight which indicated the fanali on point after point of land, lis-
tening to the joyous music and the soft susnrrns of the loiterln
crowds, Stephen was so impressed by his belief that he turne
abru tly to Seagull Palliser and said" I shall have an adven-
ture ere."
"Run away with a little Corsican, I suppose. Better not.
Vendetta, you know. Awkward. However, it you want to take
something nice away in the yacht, she's at your service."
"I don't contemplate any particular escapade of that kind,"
said Stephen quietly ; " but I have a conviction that something
will ha pen to me here. I'm rather a queer sh, you know, Pal-
liser. 've often had such presentiments, and they're always ful-
lled. My impression is that there is some one in this town of
.Ajaccio who wants to see mewhorn I must see."
"All right, old boy. I don't quite understand it; but I'll
stick to you like a brick."
" You're in no particular hurry to move, are you 1" asked Stephen.
" Not a bit. Stay here a month if you like. Buy relics of old
Bony. It seems a jolly island, and the sh that plump little
landlady gave us for dinner were as fresh as herrings."
" They weren't herrings, though," said Stephen, "and they
were uncommonly nice ; but the wine was awiully strong. But
I feel so certain, Phil, that something's going to happen here, that
I should like to stay here a few days and see."
"If we stay a few days, something will hap nnamely, I
shall fall in love. That quaint black picturesque dies the women
Wear, and the way they manage their dark ashing eyes, have
nearly done for me already. The worst of it is, I can't talk
Italian a bit."
" Never mind. I can, and so can Auguste. We'll help you."
" Don't like making love through an interpreter," said Seagull
Palliser. "Rather likel to get sold. Interpreter may let you
in, and kee the fun for imself."
The res t of this confabulation was that Langton and Palliser
amused themselves by thoroughly exploring Ajaccio and its
neighbourhood. They visited the Casa Bonaparte, in the Place
Letitia, where dwelt Carlo Maria. Bonaparte, the struggling advo-
cate. At the age of eighteen,this young lawyer, with a barristers
improvidence, married Letitia Ramolino, the beauty of Corsica,
fourteen years old. Those Were the days of the Corsican republic,
when Pasquale Paoli, immortal patriot, was defending his native
island against the agressive and tyrannous French, to whom

Genoa had ceded the island. Thirty years later, after a weary
struggle, Corsica laced itself under the protection of England,
and Sir Gilbert lliot was a pointed governor; but in 1796 we
deserted it in a wonderful hurry, at the rst appearance of a
con la of French generals, sent over by Napoleon in the ush
of talian conquest. I suppose William Pitt did not think the
romantic islet worth a ght.
Well, in 1764, young Carlo Bonaparte, newly married to the
exquisite little Letitia Ranrolino, was Paoli's secretary, and a very
ery opponent of the French. He died at Paris, at the early age
ot'tbirty-nine, leaving eight children to the care of his young
widow. Often had Carlo Bonaparte, who spent all that he
earned, been troubled for the future of those eig t children ; and
lo, Napoleon conquered half a world, and Jose h and Jerome and
Louis were kin and Caroline a queen, and auline and Eliza
rincesses; W at a superuous wealth of royalty cradled in the
ittle house of the Corsican lawyer! And Napoleon made his
uncle a cardinal, and would have made Lucian a king if that
unambitious Bona arte had not resolutely declined the doubtful
glory of a throne. tephen Langton heartily approved Lucian's de-
termination. Bad enough to be a king in any case, he thought, but
to be a sub-king to a Napoleon must have been an awful business.
The two yachtsmen wandered through the vicinity of A'accio,
and ate gra s and almonds and gs in the pleasant orc ards,
and admired)e the beautiful peasant girls carrying fruit-baskets
and wine jars on their low-crowned straw-hats. Then they went
out to see the anchovy-shing off the Bloody Islands. and occa-
sionally varied their amusement by a cruise as far as Ca e Corso
in the Seagull. But no adventure came to Stephen angton,
who quietly submitted to the chaff which his comrade now and
then inicted on him in reference to his anticipation. Nor had
Palliser, though greatly smitten by the quaint beauty of the
Corsican darnsels, succeeded in the initiation of any erotic enter-
prise. His tongue had a stubborn incapacity for adapting itself
10 any language but its own sibilant guttural English. So, with
the most adventurous intentions in the world, poor Seagull Pal-
liser could make no way. One delicious morning they went out
immediately after breakfast to watch the arrival of the Marseilles
steamer. On the quay Stephen took special notice of a group of
three persons. One was a noble old Corsican, of stately resence,
but With the very gleam of vendetta in his eye. With rim was
a creature exquisitely beautiful, but smitten with the pallet of
hope deferred. And the third person being Marc Antonio, the
sherman, I need not say who were the other twain. Ah, it was
not the rst time by many that the swift Fantasia had made
vain voyage to Ajaccio to meet the steamer from Marseilles.
Angelo Montalti knew full well that it was vain, but he would
not thwart poor Fiordilisa's desires; and so Marc Antonio tool:

wild islanders, when they saw her perfect allid beauty, muttered
menaces against the false Englishman. ut she, in whom love
had begotten trust, believed that something terrible had happened
to himthat he had been stricken down by disease or accident-
otherwise she felt full faith that he would have returned to her.
And she had tragic visions of him whom she loved, lying deli-
rious in hospitals, lying shattered and shapeless at the foot of
mighty cli's, lying shot through the heart in a duel. Anything
rather than false. The idea of Raphael Branscombe's falsehood
left no mark upon the maiden purity of the mirror of her mind,
thou h all Corsica had accepted it, and melancholy dirge-like
balls. 5, and ercer rhapsodies, prophesying vendetta, were heard
night after night in every locanda.
Marc Antonio, seeing strangers (m'gn' cygm') in Ajaccio, had
soon made out that they were countrymen of Raphael Brans-
combe" Rafiaelle Birbone," as he was commonly called. So he
found out Auguste Stephen's valet, and from him got a vague
notion that Flordilisa's betrayer was not unknown to Auguste's
master. It was very vague and confused, for the Frenchied
Italian of the valet, and the soft at Corsican dialect of the sher-
man, had few points of contact. But his report of the colloquy
excited the anxious eager curiosity of the poor broken Lily of
Isola Rossa; and so, when the bustle of the Marseilles boat was
over, and the yachtsmen had sauntered away to smoke upon the
seawall, where seldom came a single saunterer save themselves
all through the sultry summer day, the were suddenly encoun-
tered by Angelo Montalti and his gran daughter, and F iordilisa
exclaimed to Ste hen, in an abrupt, piteous, agitated voice
" You are Eng ish, senor 'l "
It took her a long time to make him understand that it was
Raphael for whom sh: inquired so eagerly; and when he did
understand it, he knew not what to say. But by degrees he said
enough to show her that her husband was alive and well, and her
eyes brightened, and her pale cheeks ushed at the good news.
And then came reection and action.
" Why does he not come? Why does he not even write 1 O
Raffaelle !" Thus sotto vocc she exclaimed, and would have sud-
denly fallen to the ound if Angelo's arm had not caught her
round the waist at t e very moment.
The keen eye of the old man had watched all the interview.
Angelo Montalti could detect in every tone of Stephen Langton's
voice the natural reluctance to say too much in these critical cir-
cumstances. Stephen, of course, was wholly ignorant of Raphael's
position in reference to F iordilisa, and fearing to injure his friend,
told as little about him as possible. Angelo noted this, and knew
its meaning; his foregone conclusions were justied; he felt at
his breast for that ivor -hafted poniard which he had deftly
prepared for the inevitab e vendetta.
" She will die soon," he muttered to himself, " and then I"

eye at that moment might have made even him nervous. Fior.
dilisa was tenderly conveyed by her grandfather and Marc An
tonio to their locanda. Hitherto she had felt a certainty that
her beloved Raphael was prevented from reaching her or com-
municating with her by some dire disaster ; but now this belief
of hers was annihilated by the testimony of one who professed to
know him well, to be his friend. "here was he then? Why-
oh! why did he not come to her? These unanswerable questions
seemed to burn themselves into her brain, to stab her loving heart
with wounds of wonder.
"Why?- Why? " she ejaculated, as she lay upon her bed
in the locanda, with her left hand, white as a lily, nervously
clutching at the seat of her uttering heart, upon which had sud~
denly come a sharp inexplicable anguish. Her eyes were set in
a straining stare as if she fain would pierce the leagues of restless
misty foam which lay between herself and Raphael, and know
for herself where indeed he waswhy he had left her lonely.
But An lo Montalti, having left her in female care, returned to
ask furt er questions of Stephen, who was still walking on the
seawall with Palliser in rather a disturbed state of mind.
" Queer coincidence l" said Seagull Palliser to Stephen. " What
is all this about Branscombe 'l"
" I hardly understand," replied Stephen. " So far as I can
make it out, that pretty creature su poses herself to be his wife.
It seems to me hardly probable. e is very careless of what he
does when women are concerned ; but I can't fancy marriage in
his line."
" Odd business. Your presentiment comes true, after allnot
in a very pleasant way, though. Rather a bore to have to ex-
tenuate Branscombe's escapades. Pretty girl for yourself might
have been worth a little trouble. Hadn't we better bolt '1 "
" No," said Stephen. "I don't like the affair; but it is clear
that Branscombe is in some way implicated, and I must do what
I can. both for him and the gir ."
" Beautiful girl, by Jove !" said Palliser. " Never liked Brans-
combefellow always so high and mightyseems to think you're
nobody. My family's as good as his any day. Besides, he's too
fast. I don't mind a man's being moderately fastbut, hang
it, Branscombe don't stop at anything. I call him too fast. He
hastn't got any heart, I don't think."
"Heart !" ejaculated Stephen, who had scarcely listened to his
friends tirade, until that particular mon0syllable awoke him from
his reverie. "Heart! Why, the devil himself, if there is such
a personage, has more heart, as you call it, than Raphael Brans-
combe. He's a wretch, Phil-that's a fact."
"Well," said the honest yachtsman, looking at Stephen with
considerable astonishment, "I'm sur rised to hear you say that.
I thought you were one of his chie cronies; you were always

"It doesn't matter," said Stephen. "What I meant to say
was, that Branscombe exerts a strange kind of inuence over me ;
I can't resist him."
" Hamesmerism. Saw a fellow mesmerised onceawful fool
he looked. Shouldn't have thought that would have operated
with you."
This extremely interesting colloquy was interrupted by the
advance of Ange o Montalti. How changed from the hospitable
patriarch who welcomed Raphael Branscombe to the old house
amid the olive orchards! Then he was full of joyous welcome,
of antique poetry, of simple Homeric delight in the current of
events; now he looked like an avenger. There was a laiubent
re in his dark eye, and his rm lips showed resolve immovable.
As he approached, Stephen Langton had a vision of what must
happen if the old man and Raphael Branscombe should meet
face to face.
Stephen knew the Seraph pretty well by this time ; knew him
utterly fearlessutterly remorseless. He could imagine this old
man, inspired by heroic grief and incalculable injury, confronting
Raphael Branscombe. He could see the Seraph's lips tighten,
his keen eye ash, his unerring hand point the pistol at his
antagonist, and pull the trigger without an instant's hesitation.
He felt certain that if Angelo Montalti attempted to revenge
himselfthe Corsican, not the Englishman, Would su'er. Mean-
while the old man had come near to them, on the seawall, beneath
which the sapphire sea lay like a. magic mirror, redoubling every
cloudlet, every skitf, eVery seabird that oated above it. Where-
upon Seagull Palliser said

do anything." And aWa went Phil Palliser, rejoicing to esca
from that atmosphere 0 tragedy wherein he who can lireat e
must have sound lungs and strong. The conversation between
the old Corsican and Stephen soon placed the latter thoroughly
in possession of all the facts. Angelo Montalti talked with almost
extreme calmthe calm of an immovable resolve. Stephen was
unable to persuade himself that Fiordilisa's betray-er was any
other than the Seraph. Nor, indeed, had it been an ordinary
betrayal. would he have tried so to persuade himself, for he knew
Raphael's recklessness in such matters ; but when he heard that
the Seraph had actually married the girl, he became incredulous.
Any number of crimes might be predicated of the hope of the
Branscombes, and his best friends would believe; but that he

should commit a btise appeared more incredible to those who
knew him best, than the book of Exodus to Bishop Colenso.
Stephen greatly admired the heroic old Corsican, who had given
up what remained of his life to consoling his grand-daughter, and
then to avenging her.
"I talk not of vengeance to her," he said. "I would not kill
the poor child whom this man has stabbed to the ve core of her
heart. She must dieit will not be longand then will avenge
her. Meanwhile, let her believe, if she can, that he is loyal. I
shall live to avenge herthat I know. I shall be the last of the
Montalti."
Ste hen proposed to him that they should take the yacht round
to Iso a Rossa, thinking that the company of an Englishman
who knew the Seraph might tranquillise to some extent F iordi-
lisa's troubled heart. Seagull Palhser, the kindest of men, would
fall into any plan, he knewalways provided he was allowed to
keep beyond the limits of the tragedy. The old Corsican acce ted
this offer, and they went back together to the locanda at w ich
he had left his grand-daughter. Fiordilisa was calmer. She had
found some inexplicable way of reconciling the osition of affairs
with her own smrcely shaken faith in Raphael. She thought: this
Englishman is his friend; perhaps he knows more than he has
told ; perhaps my Ra'aelle has sent him here to see me, but does
not allow him to tell me so ; perhaps he is indeed ill or in rison,
but will not let me know for fear of frightening me. I will elieve
this. He is trueI know he is true. He might have trusted the
courage of a Corsican womanbut he thought me a child per-
haps. Thus arguing, thus striving to persuade herself of what she
longed to believe, Fiordilisa had grown calm.
Hearing a good report of her, Stephen crossed the Place du
Diamant to his own locanda, and he and Palliser dined satisfac-
torily. Corsica is a rare place to dine, for a man of tastes un-
spoilt. If on are incapable of getting beyond the fashionable
routine of ondon cookery, in Heaven's name stick to your club
and your chef. But I can eat anything : I like the frogs' legs of
Paris, and the vine snails of Burgundy; I would try fried boa-
constrictor or devilled condor without the hesitation of an instant ;
I should not object to the roasted sides of sheep, with dark-green
melons, and goblets of mares' milk, that Mr. Matthew Arnold
makes the heroes of his poems eat and drink. And the sh and
fruit of Corsica are divine to an epicure of the right sortan epi-
cure, I mean, not afraid of fresh avours, untried combinations,
originalities of the alate. The man who would hesitate to try a
hedgehog upon anc ovy toast has no right to the noble title of
epicure the second in the worldpoet being rst. Langton and
Palliser dined, and over the ery wine of Ajaccio the former com-
municated to the gallant owner 'of the Seagull the offer he had
made. Palliser was perfectly willing.
"Queer affair, old boy," he said; "you're always doing the
romantic. Glad to go round and see some more of the island.
## p. 251 (#261) ############################################
STEPHEN LANGTON'S GUEST. 25!
Mustn't expect me to interfere in the matter, though. Not my
line, you know." So it was settled. 
They had that evening another pleasant stroll amid the simple
Corsican flirtatious of the Cour Napoleon and the Place du Dia-
mant. But Palliser, though enticed by the mystery of the fa]-
dettu, inaugurated no adventure. The next morning shone deli-
ciously. Old Angelo Montalli and the faithful Marc Antonio
were astounded at the light step with which Fiordilisa tripped
down to go on board the Englishman's yacht. \Vhat did it mean'f
thought her grandfather. Had the Englishman told her any
secret news? There was a light in her eyes, the pallor had passed
from her perfect oval cheeks ; could the Seraph at this moment
have beheld her, surely he would have forgotten Anne Morll and
returned to the beautiful creature whom he had deserted.
Marc Antonio was left to manage the dancing little Fantasia.
With a favouring wind, the Seagull soon came in sight of those
blood-red cliffs which had beheld the passionate idyl of Fiordi-
lisa's love. During the brief voyage, Stephen had been her cour-
teous cavalier. When she looked at him, her eyes had meaning
which Stephen could not fathom. They strove to 'tell him that
his secret was discoveredthat he came from Raphaelthat he
was a bringer of good tidings not yet to be revealed. Stephen
could not at all understand this change in Fiordilisa's mood. She
was almost gay She made him 100k at the distant mass of R0-
tondo, across Sagoue's gulf, and told him how the goatherds dwelt
high up among the granite rocks, and how the river Restonica
thundered down through the forest-belt of giant pines. She
showed him Cape Reese. and the heights of Paglia, all granite and
porphyry, and little Calvi, whose citizens maintain that their
town gave birth to Christopher Columbus. And soon the grey
towers and ruddy island-cliffs of Isola Rossa came in sight ; and
Fiordilisa pointed out the old stone house of the Montalti among
the ancient orchards on the hill-side, above the enchanted beach,
erclaiming" There ! That is our homeRaffaelle's and mine."
Strange indeed this reaction of gaiety seemed to Stephen.
What could it mean? It was so complete a contrast to the pas-
sionate grief and dumb despair of yesterday. She could have
heard nothing. She was not light of loveconsolable by one
Englishman for the loss of another. No; he could see at once that
her love for Raphael was pure and perfecta gem without flaw.
Angelo Montalti was also much perplexed by his darling's re-
covered gaiety. Sorrow had smitten her long. Her heart seemed
broken. And now she sat in the stern of Palliser's beautiful little
craft, carefully enveloped in many coloured ags and \vrappiugs,
such as English vachtsmen always crowd around ladies even in
the summer Mediterraneana perfect picture of renewed beauty
and subdued delight. More beautiful than when rst wooed by
Raphael, for the tender grace of grief had touched and rened her
delicate fair face, and she might have passed for a Madonna by
her husband's immortal namesake, with the thought in her virgin

heart that her unborn baby was divine. So the Seagull came gain
round the point to Isola Rossa. It was the most languid moment
of the afternoon. All the villagers had turned out to catch some
freshness from the swift sea breeze, and to await the Fantasia.
For they all knew the grief of Fiordilisa, the child-beauty of the
little town, for whom they had begun to expect a princess's des-
tiny. They had crowded to the coral-veined beach ; and among
them was our pleasant little friend Chilina, hostess of the locanda,
expecting Marc Antonio. But it was not the Fantasia that came
round the int. The English yacht had distanced the dancing
darling of t e Midland Sea. The saucy schooner furled her sails,
and a boat was let down, into which descended Fiordilisa and
her guardian and two others. Could one of these be .Ra'aelle'l
thought the eager islanders. The stalwart strokes of four stout
English seamen soon landed the pinnace. The disappointed
crowd perceived that the two men were strangers, yet even the
crowd erceived that the Lily of Isola Rossa had a brighter eye
and lig iter tread. Absorbed in the landing of Fiordilisa and
her companions, the folk on the beach had no ears for the tread
of horses behind, but suddenly a rapid gallop of hoofs became
audible, and every one was aware of two horsemen approaching at
the top of their speed from the Al gajola road. The foremost horse
came on at a tremendous pace ; reaching the shore, the panting
animal was reined up with a sudden sharpness, and there sprang

CHAPTER XXIX.
A BLACK NIGHr's worm.
AY, the Seraph was there, to the amazement of everybody
except Fiordilisa. She saw her expectation realised. She
sprang into his arms without a word. She brightened blush-
fully into the wondrous beauty of her maidenhood. Her fears
and doubts were put to ight for ever. How had Raphael
reached Isola Rossa at the very nick of time 'lhe whom we saw
last arranging an elopement in the purlieus of Mesopotamia?
He had seen a good many curious events while the Seagull had
been voyaging the blue waters of the Mediterranean. I must
follow his course for a while.
Humphrey Morll had arranged to start onhis foreign mission
at an early hour on a certain Wednesday morning. Raphael, duly
apprised thereof, arranged to carry off Humphrey's erring wife
about two hours earlier. He laughed maliciously at the idea of
Morll's irate perplexity when Anne should have mysteriously
vanished at the very moment of departure. The evening of
Tuesday had arrived; every detail was settled; the Seraph sat
in his sanctum in Clarges Street lazily smoking when Louis
entered, looking as if he had bad news to communicate.
" Well, Louis, what's the matter'l"
## p. 253 (#263) ############################################
A BLACK NIGHT'S "'ORK. 253
"I beg your pardon, sirI hope I'm wrong; it's something
about Miss Branscombe," said the valet very hesitatingly.
" Go on."
" I'm afraid, sir, she's thinking of going off with Sir Arthur
this evening.'
Raphael laughed. "That would be a curious coincidence," he
said to himself. "But what do you know about it, Louis?"
"There have been meetings to-day between Margot and Sir
Arthur's man. She's outside waiting for him now. I expect
she'll bring a letter." Margot was Claudia's French maid, a tall,
handsome girl, whom Louis rather admired. Doubtless a touch of
jealousy had put him on the scent. Raphael looked at his watch ;
it was nearly eleven. He rose at once, and descended into the
passage. Swinging baize-covered doors interposed between the
staircase and the front door. Over the latter burnt a lamp.
" Keep in the background, Louis," he said. " Leave her to me."
The Seraph stood behind the baize doors, and through an oval
pane of glass watched for the girl's coming. Presently the front
door cautiously opened ; Margot stepped in softly, and closed it
soundlessly, and Ka hael saw in her hand a letter, which she
hid in the bosom of er dreSs before she pushed open the inner
doors. The moment she entered he pinioned her arms with irre-
sistible force, putting his hand upon her mouth to stop the ex-
pected scream.
" You are found out," he said in a whisper. " Be silent."
He took the letter from its hiding-place, and handed the girl
over to the valet's care.
" Bring her up to Miss Branscombe's room," he said.
Claudia was siiting expectant. She had heard nothing of the
morement below, for an ante-room divided her sitting-room from
the stairs. She sat with those bright eyes of hers xed upon the
door, awaiting Margot's arrival. The door opened. Raphael en-
tered, a letter in his hand. Claudia sank back in her chair and
covered her eyes with her hands.
" I have not yet read this letter," he said, " but I know it is
from Sir Arthur Willesden. Let me read it to you." He broke
the seal and read thus
" Darling, to-night at twelve, or as soon after as possible, come
to me here. The door will be ajar. You will see no one; m
servant will be at 's stable with the carriage. I hope the
maid you bring with you is trustworthyARTHUR."
A friend of mine once showed me a rare miniature painting on
ivory of the Archangel Michael. There was marvellous youthful
beauty in the face, but it was the beauty of an avenger. You
would say that thus he looked before he fell with irresistible
might on the arch-rebel of whom Mr. John Milton has made a
hero. Even thus looked the Seraph as he threw this note of the
Assyrian baronet's upon a table, and exclaimed to his sister with
intensity of contempt" Youa Bransco'mbe l "
## p. 254 (#264) ############################################
254 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
There was a brief pause, which to Claudia seemed like an hour.
Then she threw herself at her brother's feet crying, " Oh ! I love
him so, Raphael ! I love him so ! " She had positively per-
suaded herself that it was true. This is what comes of a passion-
ate woman's remainim7 too long unmarried.
" Love him ! " said the Seraph with utter scorn.
It certainly seemed strange. Claudia was a woman t to wed
a Czesar; the baronet was 'simply a heavy swell, large, inane,
good-looking, erfumed. '
" Now," sai Raphael, "let us settle this matter at once. I am
rather busy to-night. Will you write a note to this fellow de-
clining all further intercourse with him, and I'll take it round
and horsewhip him? That's the proper course."
" I cannot,' she said. " I cannot. I love him, Raphael."
" Pshaw! . . . 'Vill he marry you?"
' " Oh yes ! I know he willI know he will."
" Do you '1" He took up the letter again and bolted at it. It
gave him an idea. He opened the d001' of the ante-room and
beckoned Louis and Margot to enter. He scanned the French
girl from head to foot.
"'Twill do," he said. "Margot, go into your mistress's bed-
room and take off your dress and underclothing. Quick; don't
waste time. . . . I shall go with you, Claudia, in that girl's d ress."
Claudia was silent. Her bedroom was beyond the room in
which they were, and had no other outlet. The girl obeyed orders.
"Louis," said Raphael, " go to my room and bring a lot of silk
handkerchiefsa dozen, if you can nd them."
When the valet returned, the Seraph said to his sister, " Now,
come and dress. Be quick! "
They entered the bedroom. Margot, divested of most of her
apparel, had slipped into Claudia's bed. But she was not allowed
to remain in eace. Raphael was determined that she should
not, in their a meme, alarm the other servants. It was no time
to stand on ceremony. With the handkerchiefs that Louis had
brought he safely gagged her and bound her hand and foot, fasten~
ing her immovably to the bed. Then he pulled off his coat and
waistcoat and arrayed himself in Margot's dress, which tted
him fairly enough. This done, he turned to his sister, saying,
" Claudia, lead the way. When you get to Jermyn Street you can
ask Willesden to marry you. If he will, all right ; if he won't, he
must take the consequences. . . . Louis, keep near us, but on the
other side of the street, and follow me quietly when I come out
again." The Panther led the way downstairs and along desolate
Piccadilly, Raphael following in the guise of a female attendant;
Her heart failed her. She knew her brother's implacable resolve.
She walked as if in a dream. Arrived at Sir Arthur Willesden's
residence, Claudia pushed open the front door and uietly
ascended to the rst oor, Raphael following. Louis too up a
position as sentinel in the shadow of a doorway on the opposite
side of the street,

"Ah, my pet."exclaimed Sir Arthur as Claudia entered, " how
good of you to be punctual 2"
He sprang towards her, and tried to embrace her, heerllcss of
the apparent soulwdtc who stood respectfully at the door. But
Claudia sank at his feet, and cried in a low, passionate voice
" Will you marry me, Arthur? Will you!"
This was not exactly what the baronet had expected, and he
was by no means the man for the situation. He commenced
a hesitating explanation about his difcultiesthe Jews~that
they would be down upon him if he marriedand much else
that was equally to the purpose. Claudia could only repeat her
pitiful question ; her presence of mind had deserted her.
" You don't intend to marry this young lady 'I" suddenly said
the Seraph in a falsetto voice.
"Who the devil are you? What the devil do you mean by
this impertinence'l" said the baronet, who, like all stupid big
men, was deliohted to have somebody to bully when he saw no
way out of a difculty. The effect was electric. Probably Sir
Arthur would have preferred something less surprising.
" I am Raphael Branscombe," said the Seraph, taking of poor
glargot's bonnet and veil, and leisurely proceeding to unpetticoat
imself.
"Oh! lsee !" said the baronet,sulkilv swearing. "This isa trap."
"Ay, it's a trap," returned Raphael, who stood in his shirt and
trousers, ready for action. "You're caught in it, my ne fellow.
You wanted to run away with my sister, but you didn't want to
marry herrather a dangerous game, you'll nd." '
Sir Arthur's wits had become chaotic. He could nd no reply.
Raphael's eye had caught a pair of foils on a side-table. He
took them up, broke oil" the buttons, and turned their hilts to the
baronet.
" Here, choose !" he said. " You're not a. coward, I suppose."
The harouet looked as if he could crush his lighter opponent,
and as if he meant to do it ; but Raphael's keen, fearless glance
deterred him. Claudia had sunk half fainting upon a sofa. Sir
Arthur took a. foil.
" We shall want pen, ink, and paper," said the Seraph. "Oh !
here they are."
"What do you mean 7" growled the baronet.
"Why, if you kill me you don't want to be hanged, I suppose;
and I'm sure I don't if I kill you. Just write what I tell you."
The baronet wrote, at Raphael's dictation :
"Having debts that I can never ay, and being7 in fear of
arrest, I have decided to commit suici e.A.n'rHUB "'ILLESDEN."
And the Seraph wrote :
" My sister has e10ped with Sir Arthur Willesden. I will not
survive the dishonour.RAPHAEL Bnanscomm"
" There ! " said the Seraph. " Now, if you kill me, just burn
your own paper.'
## p. 256 (#266) ############################################

Claudia shuddered on her couch. Raphael pushed aside the
centre table, and the two men engaged. Sir Arthur attacked
passionately. The Seraph, a master of fence, with a wrist of steel,
enraged him horribly by disarming- him, and then lowering his
point while he picked it his weapon. A skilled spectator might
ave seen that Raphae was only playing with his victim. A.
clock over the chimney struck one. As if reminded that he had
no time to spare, that instant Raphael made a lunge, and the
steel passed right into Sir Arthur's heart. He fell heavily, with-
out a word. Claudia, whom the terrible music of the colliding
foils had roused from her apathy, and who, half raised, with
straining eyes and clenched hands, had watched every pass, now
fainted in good earnest. The Seraph's coolness was diabolical.
He put in his pocket the document he had signed ; took Willes-
den's foil from his relaxed hand, and replaced it; found some
eau-de-cologne, with which he partially resuscitated his sister.
Then, again arranging himself in the French girl's dress, he
descended the stairs, supporting Claudia ; made his way into the
street, quietly closing the door after him, and walked home, fol~
lowed by Louis. When they reached Claudia's apartment Raphael
told Louis to release the prisoner.
" Take care of your mistress," said the Seraph to Margot ; " and
whatever you may hear, or whatever questions are asked you, the
best thing you can do is to know nothing. You and Miss Brans-
combe both went to bed at eleven o'clock! Do you hear? "
The ready-witted girl showed that she understood. Raphael
left the mistress and maid to their own devices, and went to his
own rooms, where he carefully cooled himself after his exertions,
having previously observed to his servant-
" You had better get ready for our next affair, Louis. Half-past
two, at Hyde Park Corner."
The Seraph's adventure had made him neither excited no!
meditative. He dressed himself for traVel, mounting a coat lined
with abundant furs. Then, lighting a cigar, he turned out once
more, and as he paced the pavement towards the place of appoint-
ment, he sang in that luscious tenor of his
" Que d'alarmes l
Que de larnies !
Un pas d'armes,
C'est tres-heau ! "
A bright moon had arisen by the time he reached Hyde Park
Corner, at which place stood motionless a carriage with four
horses. As he approached, Louis came forward and opened the
door. Raphael sprang in, to the baby beauty who awaited him
there with palpitating heart; Louis shut the door, and climbed
to the box ; and away went the horses at that racing pace which
your postilion knows so well to command when there is certainty
of abundant gold. And away they went on the Bath Road, which
the subtle Seraph had chosen because he designed, by doubling,

to escape the pursuit which he hoped Morll would institute.
And poor little foolish Anne Page nestled to his side in rfect
happiness At this most perilous crisis of her fate she or the
rst time felt safctv. Not the rst or the last, I sup use, of her
sex, to whom that has seemed or will seem the best w ich in very
truth is the Worst possible. At about sixt miles from Hvde
Park Corner, in a dull town, where post-c sises were sel om
seen, the Seraph's rapid equipage pulled u just as everybody was
at breakfast The principal inn was called the Bear; this the
travellers entered, and Raphael at once sent Anne to bed, with
some warm liquid to comfort her. She was not able to bear the
toils of rapid travel, he knew full well. Then he sent back the post-
chaise,the postillions having been sufciently fee'd to ensure secrecy
as to their route, if any inquiry chanced to be made of them.
His rst care was to arrange with the landlord for a light trap
and a fast horse to take him some fourteen miles that afternoon.
The days were long ; he would give his victim a few hours' sleep,
and then drive her across country into another road. There was
no difculty about the matter. Having settled it, and feeling
restless, he left Louis in charge, and took a stroll through a
pleasant river valley near the town. Chance led him to a ne
old house ; he thought he would wear the time away by inspect-
ing it, and so aske at a lodge whether he could be admitted.
The family were absent, and he found entrance. A quaint old
placeits hall hung with the veritable armourbuff jerkins and
steel capsof Cromwell's irresistible Ironsides. There was a
legend connected with ita legend of a secret birth, and a new-
born child ruthlessly thrust iuto a mighty rewhich was told him
by an old-world crone of a housekeeper with a terror in her face
" A poor, wealg palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,
Whose passing-bell might ere the midnight toll."
Raphael lightly laughed at the weird tale, and delighted her
with a sovereign, and strolled back to the old inn in the som-
nolent town.
In the afternoon, his companion being refreshed with slee and
food and wine, away the started north-eastward. The atter
part of the drive was over reezy chalk-downs, from whose farther
slope they descended to a town even more ancient, though perhaps
not duller, where they stopped at an inn of the same name. and
at once ordered dinner. The Seraph rejoiced to nd a bottle of
good old port in this uaint country inn. And when he strolled
out into the market p ace, he also rejoiced to nd a yellow full
moon, high above the ne tower of the old churcha tower with
a tree growing on its summit.
" By Jove ! " he said to himself, "the little party looks won-
derfully refreshed by her feed. Another drive of about the same
length will doher no harm." He was full of the pleasure of eluding
pursuit. He found already that he should soon be very weary

of his victimthough I think he considered himself hersand
thought only of depositing her in safe quarters, and bafing Mor-
till. She had such supreme condence in him that she obeyed
him implicitly. Poor little thing ! He had sent back his horse
and trap. He had no difculty in obtaining another. Away they
went again, and at the end of about fourteen miles more, crossed
the noblest of England's rivers, and ascended a street on whose
right was a long and lofty building. From the dome above its
noble gateway a mighty bell was slowly pealing as they assed.
They turned to the right, beyond this famous edice, an drove
down a superb street, where old-fashioned shops min led with
colleges and churches, and where young men in scho astic cos
tume 'ostled the crowds in ordinary dress, thronging the pave-
ment eneath the serene moonlight. Half- way down the street
he pulled up at a hostelry, whose fame he knew full well, and
there they spent the night.
Post-horses were ordered for an early hour next morning, and
before noon on Thursday Ra hael and his companion, calling
themselves Mr. and Mrs. But er, were breakfasting at an old-
fangled inn in Gracechurch Street, in a room on a gallery over-
looking a dirty, picturesque courtyard; and Mr. Butler was
searching the papers for news. He was not disappointed. The
evening papers of the previous night had, of course, an account
of Sir Arthur Willesden's being found dead, with various
speculations on the subject. The Globe (and Traveller?) mys-
teriously referred to Mr. Humphrey Mortill's departure on his
mission being delayed by a domestic calamity. The morning
journals had fuller information on both topics. There was a
doubt whether Sir Arthur could have stabbed himself with the
foil from the position in which it was found. But then there was
his own statement in writing, the authenticity of which had been
fully proved, his autograph being only too Well known in the
London money market. Again, his man-servant deposed that
Sir Arthur had ordered post-horses, and intended to leave town
soon after midnight, but he did not know where he was going,
or whether he was going alone. Then Mr. Humphrey Mortill
had been on the oint of starting for abroad, to perform the
highly-important uties of his apporntment, when it was suddenly
discovered that Mis. Morll had left the house, and could be
traced nowhere. Mr. and Mrs. )[ortill had always been on the
best of terms. There were, however, one or two super-sapient
editors who fancied there might be a connection between Mrs.
Morll's disappearance and Sir Arthur's post-horses. And an
intelligent member of the new police recollected having seen
two females near Sir Arthur's house, in J ermyn Street, late on
Tuesday night, or early on Wednesday morning. he did not quite
know whic . Claudia and Claudia's lls de chambre seemed to

It was aqueer imbroglio. to which Edgar Allan Poe might
have done justice. 1 don't think I ought to have let in ' readers
into the secret. IfI had opened the story with a den haronet
lying in a Jermyn Street rst oor with a foil through his heart,

my enigmatical namesake could have presented a neater puzzle.
However, it is a little top late to re-write the novelI'm at folio

story. The raph, having breakfasted, and read the papers,
left Louis in charge of Mrs Butler, and made his way west-
ward. His habits were notoriously irregular, so that nobodv was
likely to in uire where he had spent Wednesday. He had dined
at the Chum 0s at seven o'clock on Tuesday evening ; helounged
in now, at about four o'clock on Thursday, with the most non-
chalant air imaginable.
"Hallo, Branscombe," said Frank Mauls, whom he encountered
in the superb columnar atrium of the Chandos, "you've heard the
news, of course 7"
Frank was a great mathematician, Senior Wrangler and Smith's
Prizeman of his yearand also a great drinker of port wine. He
was s cially fond of difcult social problems, and estimates of
proba ility; and there was some talk of Lord Cheiron, who was
a great friend of his father, forming a de artment of High Police
and puttin him at the head of it. But t e apers took the alarm,
declaring t at such an institution would e used for political
purposes; so nothing came of it. Frank ultimately took holy
orders, and married a bishop's daughter, and is at present an arch-
deacon and well-beneced rector. This double enigma excited
his curiosity.
" About Willesden, you mean 7" said the Seraph quietly.
" Only just seen it in the papers. I was out of town yesterday.
A man must be a wait to commit suicide because he was in debt."
"Was it suicidel" asked Maule. "You saw he had made
arrangements for going away ; post-horses were ordered. Be-
sides, I went into the room with the police, and I noticed what
they didn't, that the other foil had the button off it."
" What's your theory 'I " said Brabazon Aylmer, one of a group
who had gathered round the talkers.
"It is premature to form anything at all like a theory. But
Branscombe can erhaps help me to something like the prelimi-
naries of a hypot esis. Do you know," asked Maule, "whether
there was any intimacy between Sir Arthur and Mrs. Morll'l
You knew them both, I think."
" Why, Mrs. Morll is my cousin, and I saw Willesden often
enough, though we were never intimate ; and they used to meet
one another, now and then, at my sister's rooms in Clarges Street;
but I don't think they were at all on familiar terms. I see what
you are fancying."

"Well," said Frank Maule, " if Willesden meant to run away
with Anybody, which doesn't seem unlikely, it might have been
Mrs. Morll. Morll might have found out that she was gone,
and suspected Willesden, and gone to J ermyn Street to see. In
any case, whether Morll's suspicion was just or not, they might
have quarrelled and fought."
"You're making it deucedly potential," said Brabazon Aylmer.
"And I think," said Raphael, "in order to construct ascientic
theory, it is necessary you should account for Mrs. Mortill's dis-
appearance, over which her unhappy husband is at present tearing
his hair."
"Tell on what," said Horace Chichester, captain in the Guards,
famous or his recklessness of theory, "suppose Morll and Wil-
lesden fought, and Morll killed Willesden, and then the young
woman came to Willesden's rooms expecting to be runaway with,
and then Morll killed her, and now h ocritically pretends he
don't know anything about her? By ove, perhaps he stuffed
her dead bod up the chimney ! Did anybody look, Maule 7"
" I didn't,' said Manle, laughing. " Really, Chichester, your
theory is not a bad one. If Mrs. Morll was killed at Willes-
den's rooms, it would be difcult to remove her corpse."
"Pshaw !" interposed the Seraph, "all this is nonsense. If
there had been anything between Willesden and Mrs. Mortill, I
should certainly have known it. She'd have been likelier to run
away with me, if that was at all my line."
"Egad, I like that," said Captain Chichester. " Why, you're a
most dangerous fellow, everybody knows."
" When you nd me running away with anybody, old fellow,
abuse me as much as you please. But who can tell me what
Morll is doing?"
" The poor fellow is half mad," said Maule. "One hears of
him or meets him everywhere, making inquiries in all sorts of
impossible places. He was here last night, taking counsel of me.
You won't nd him at home."
" I suppose not," observed Raphael. " If you're going to dine
here, Maule, let us feed together. I should like to see Morlill if
he should look in."
" We four will dine together," said Chichester. " I'll order the
dinner-anchovy salad to begin, and a bloater to nisheight
o'clock. I like a nice little dinner when there's a pleasant sub-
ject of conversation. You fellows may trust to me. I'll look
to the wines. The Margaux's better than the Latte, I think.
Perhaps Mrs. Mortill's body will be found by that time."
" Better order some port with a bod in it," said Mauls drily.
" Well, never mind ; eight sharp. {foil may depend on me for
a good dinner. You three go and pick up all the news you can."
" I shall stroll round to J ermyn Street and hear if there's any-
thin<r fresh," said Frank Maule.
" on are the likeliest of us to pick up news," said the Seraph.

A BLACK NIGHT'S WORK. :6!
"I'm too lazy. If any of you see Moriill, tell him I shall be
here this evening."
Raphael, of course. knew that Mortill's servants, aware of their
mistresss intimacy with him, might well suspect him of having
taken her away. But he had not heard of any such suspicion
being expressed b Humphrey, so he thought he would meet him
and ascertain for imselt' how matters stood. On that Wednes-
day morning Anne had slipt unseen from the house, met Louis
in a neighbouring square, and walked with the valet some dis-
tance to the post-chaise. She had left no trace. And public
opinionor what passed for thatmuddled the affair by per-
sistently connecting Mrs. Morll's disappearance with Sir Arthur
Willesden's death. Raphael, leaving the Chandos, went straight
to Clarges Street, where his absence and Louis's had not caused
the least surprise among the servants. Their movements were
always sudden and abrupt. He found that his sister was secluded
and unSeeuvery ill, said a handmaiden, whereupon he ordered
Margot to he sent to him. That young person, who rather
resented having been tied down on a ed in the airy costume of
chemise and femoralia, appeared sulkily. With anybody else her
indignation would have been loqnacious, but the Sera h terried
her. He learnt from her that Claudia was in a varia le state-
erce sometimes, sometimes sullen. But the terrible Scene through
which she had passed had not disordered her senses. And the girl
had not as yet, apparently, heard anything from any source to con -
nect Jermyn Street with Clarges Street on that night of horror.
The Seraph, having learnt from Margot the position of affairs
with her mistress, allowed her to leave him, much to her satisfac~
tion. He did not want to see Claudia. He felt as if she was no
longer his sister. He was as much amazed as anything could
amaze him, by the betrayal of such Weakness by a Branscombe.
It was not the wickedness, it was the silliness of the thing which
annoyed the Seraph. It may seem surprising that Raphael Brans-
combe, whose pastime through life had been taking advantage of
the weakness of women, should visit an escapade so sternly on
his sister; but the truth is, that he was surprised and disap-
pointed at a Branscombe showing such weakness. If she had
een a Borgia or a Brinvilliers, he would have readin forgiven
her. But that she should succumb to the gross attractions of Sir
Arthur \Villesdenthat she should be willing to sacrice herself
for a man whom Raphael held utterly in contempt, was what he
could not forgive.
Raphael Branscombe considered women the natural quarry of
men, even as the heron of the falcon. He had
" Thewing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw."
He was ready any day to run away with any woman, and to give
"satisfaction" to all her relations, one after the other. But he
was disgusted to nd that his sister belonged to the heron tribe.

:6: SWEET ANNE PAGE.
It was solemnly debated in the Council of Trent whether woman
is really the female of man. After this little affair of Claudia's,
l-'aphael thought not. Having ascertained to his own satisfaction
the state of affairs in Clarges Street, the Sera h took wing to the
old eastern hostelry where he had left Mrs. ortill under Louis's
care. He found her safe and patient} She was in a curious mood.
Her absolute infatuated love for him rendered her perfectly con-
tent to do his bidding, present or absent; she was histhat was
all she knew or cared to know. Being his, she would do all that
he told her, would obey him in the merest minutiae, would nd
her fullest delight in so doing. The love-fever has variable symp-
toms; this was little Anne's diagnosis. When Raphael told her
she was to leave England in Louis's company, to be rejoined by
him in the course of days or weeks, she acquiesced delightedly,
happy to obey whom she loved. So the Seraph, knowing Louis's
ability and loyalty, started them for the Continent, making an
arrangement for meeting in Italy. And then he returned to the
Chandos, where Captain Chichester had occupied the interval in
ordering dinner. An excellent dinner it was. There were a
heap of eople dining at the club that day. ("Heap of peo le
vul r s ang !" "Slang is young language," says my frien Mr.
Cay ey, poet and politician ; is it not rather old language, some-
times lSee the "Saxon Chronicles") What a parenthesis, ye
gods ! As the four men sat over their wine, Hum hrey Mortill
entered. How altered was that erudite, sagacious, usiness-like
young scion of the law ! Had he loved his wife, then? Was it
passion for "Sweet Anne Page" which had made his eyes so
wild, and given his cheek so strange a tailor? Not a bit of it.
It was the shame of the public knowle ge that she had left him
-the annoyance of being placed before the world in a ludicrous,
even an ignominious position.
Morll was a man who could bear anything except being
laughed at. Put him in a barrel full of s ikes, as they say Regu-
lus was served, and he would take it easi y. But he had begun
life with a resolve to live with dignity. He was determined to
be innitely respectable. And, alone in the world, he would have
carried out his scheme ; but a man cannot control the actions of
his wife. Mortill's dignity was wounded by Anne's disappear-
ance, and no severer blow could have been inicted on him.
Morover, certain rumours had now reached him, vaguely enough,
of Raphael's being on terms of unsuspected intimacy with his wife.
And somebody had told him that the Seraph was at the Chandos.
So he came into the dining-room in a ferocious state, bent on
quarrelling with the only man whom he could connect with his
wife's disappearance. Raphael was quietly sipping his wine, and
listening to Frank Maule's subtle speculations, and Captain Chi-
chester's extravagant theories,when Morll stalked up to the table.
" Mr. Branscombe, ma I speak to you i"
" By all means," said the Seraph. " What is it, old fellow 1"
## p. 263 (#273) ############################################
A BLACK NIGHT'S H'ORK. 263
" What do you know about my wife 7 "
" J ust what I see in the papers," he replied, with insolent cool-
ness. " Is there anything new about her i "
" I am credibly informed you have been on very familiar terms
with hermuch too familiar."
" Credibly informed," said the Seraph deliberately. " It seems
curious for a man to rely upon others for information about his
wife. Have you any other credible information 1"
Morll was getting more and more enraged, while the men who
were dining with the Seraph looked on with surprise at his tone.
" If a man's profession," he said furiously, "takes him from
home, the man who takes advantage of his absence is a villain."
"Don't be offensive," said the Seraph. "Yourwife was my cousin.
Many a time have I had her in my armswhen she was a baby."
" Don't aggravate him, Branscombe," whispered Aylmer. " The
poor devil doesn't know what he's about."
"I can't stand thi=," said Morll impetuously. "I believe you
know Where my wife is gone. I believe you took her away."
"My good friend," said Raphael, rising from his chair, and
throwing his napkin on the cloth, "she learnt from you to elope.
You should not be surprised if she does a second time what she
liked the rst. Chichester. if he wants to ght, perhaps you'll
act for me?" Therewith the Seraph turned slowly away, and
went to the smoking-room, whither Maule and Aylmer followed
him. By and by came the excitable captain. "All right," he
said, "he means ghting. "'imbledon in the grey of the morning.
Pistols. By Jove, he's awfully mad."
"Who is his second i" said Aylmer, for the Seraph was smok-
ing as placidly as if the affair in no degree concerned him.
"Anstruthersharp fellowunderstands the thing perfectly."
"You didn't expect so exciting a dessert after your little
dinner," said Frank Mauls.
" I can't think why you provoked that poor devil, Branscombe,"
remarked Aylmer. " If you hadn't been so cursedly sarcastic
there would have been no row."
" I dislike the man," said the Seraph. "He behaved very dis-
reputany in taking awav that little girl from my Uncle Walter's
house. He only wanted her money, and he persuaded hera
mere baby at the timeto elope with him, although he must have
known she was engaged to Langton. Now, as I told the fellow,
she has proted by the lesson, and e10ped with somebody else.
It serves him right."
Raphael, while his friends conversed, had been occupied by a
delicate point of casuistry. There is no casuist like your duellist.
The Seraph, under ordinary circumstances of elo ement, would,
being the person culpable, have made it a point 0 honour to re
in the air; but in the present instance he argued that he had a
revious cause of quarrel with Morll for eloping with his cousin
in the rst place, so they were on equal terms clearly, and he had

a perfect right to take his own part. That night the four gentle-
men who had dined together s ent in the smoking-room of the
Chandos. The club is always ate, especially in its card rooms ;
but these four were the last in the place. Chichester recom-
mended his principal to take an hour or tWo's rest; but the
Seraph, though he had slept but little since Tuesday evening,
was not to be persuaded.
" I'm not in the humour for sleep," he said.
"But cigars and brandy and seltzer will make your hand
shake." urged Chichester.
" Not a bit. If I went to bed I might possibly feel shaky when
I turned out again; but I'm quite rm enough to wing a lawyer."
" I wonder is he a good shot 7" said Aylmer.
"If he is, I'll eat him," replied Captain Chichester. " But bad
shots are like bad whist-playersthey have such cursed luck."
"He'll have no luck," quietly remarked Raphael.
" You seem to feel very safe," said Maule.
"I do. One can pretty well tell, I think. I shall get shot
one of these daysa ball through the lungs ; but Moi-ll won't
do it. But surely you fellows are tired of this subject. Let's
have a game at whist."
They played whist till daybreak. Then the Seraph and his
second, and a surgeon whose services had been retained, drove otf
to Wimbledon, while Maule and Aylmer walked to their respec-
tive quarters through the fresh quiet of the morning. 7
" I hope Branscombe won't get hurt," remarked the good-
natured Aylmer. "He's a capital fellow."
"He's a very curious character," reectiver replied the more
perspicacious Maule.
They met in Glen Cardiganyears before its baptism. Morll
was rst on the ground; Anstruther had been utterly unable to
restrain his nervous impatience, and they were twenty minutes
before their time. As the Seraph neared the spot, he touched
Ca tain Chichester lightly on the right shoulder, and said-
" hat's where he'll get it."
I have never been much impressed by the moralists who
are horried by the notion of two men standing opposite one
another with this issue of life or death between them. Mr.
Tennyson's lunatic hero is very eloquent about
" The Christless code
That must have life for a blow ;"
but the arguments of maniacs ought not to have much Weight.
" Life for a blow," however, save in very bad cases, I would not
demand ; but there are crimes which only the duel can punish ;
and the man who seduces a woman ought to be ready to stand
and be shot at by her nearest relation. This isa mautllin, mau'k-
ish, sentimental, hypocritical age. But there are symptoms of
reaction, and I believe an advanced civilisation will bring us bit-k

a few things we have foolishly cast awayamong them, in cases
of deadlv dishonour, the duel. I suppose the critics will say this
is " adding." Who cares?
T te two men red simultaneously. Morll's bullet ploughed
the ground a yard on Ra hael's left. Morlill himself went down
with a wound in his rig it shoulder. The surgeon examined it,
and declared there was no serious harm done. And so ended that
act of the drama.
CHAPTER XXX.
FATHER axn nauonren.
HE Panther, shut into her room, bromied over her mischance.
She was desperately dissatised with herself. She recog-
nised the mistake she had made in Sir Arthur Willesden. The
man whom she had loved was a creature of her own passionate
imagination, differing utterly from the real haronet. She did
not feel the slightest pity for Sir Arthur.
" Nay, you know
You never could have mercy,"
says Chastelard to Queen Mary in Mr. Aljt ernon Swinburne's ne
tragedy. There was no touch of mercy in Claudia. She felt that
the baronet was rightly served. She adored her brother for the
deed done by his remorseless sword. But she despised herselt'.
This was the worst of it. That she, who hitherto had worked
her wicked will with men, should have been the victim of a gross
half-coward, half-fop. like the dead baronet ! That she should
have surrendered her heart to this mere animala kind of human
bladder, which collapsed at the touch of Raphael's foil! That
Stephen Langton should refuse her was, we may well deem, a.
terrible humiliation ; but at any rate Stephen was woth loving.
He was neither fop nor coward. He was true to the core. He
would not have made lame excuses to a woman whom he loved,
leading at his feet for honourable treatment. Indeed, Claudia
ooked back to her liaison with Stephen, and did not blush thereat.
He had refused her,true, but it was her own fault. He was loyal
and loving. If she had played fast and loose with him she had
none but herself to blame. It was quite otherwise in this last
affair. She felt that she had fallen tar short of the Branscombe
standard in this matter. She deserved the contempt of her
family. What, if he knew it, would her father say "I
And where was her father? Occupied with her own affairs, she
had thought but little of the old gentleman. Probably he was
back at Kingsleat, superintending the rebuilding of the manor-
house and enjoying the homage of his acquaintance and tenantry,

her uncle Walter would receive her. Amid all her wandering
thoughts there came no terror of the peril t0 Raphael by possible
discovery of his having slain Sir Arthur Willesden. Somehow
or other she had come to think of Raphael very much as he
thought of himselfas safe from all such danger.
The Seraph had the most complete condence that his hour was
not yet comethat the weapon to wound him was et unforged.
Claudia shared her brothers faith. She knew of is return to
Clarges Street on Thursday, but she did not wish to see him, feel-
ing that he must despise her; and she heard from Margot with
intense satisfaction that he was gone. The beautiful wild creature
lay for hours together on a couch, scarce moving a limb, scarce
lifting an eyelash, scarce conscious of anything external. All
the while she was in avonised perplexity. What could she do 1
\Vhat would remm'e the contempt which her brother must feel

descendeddebasing, dethroning, uu-Branscombe-ing herself 'I
Suddenly a thought struck her like re. She had been as quiet
as death; the electric idea seemed to raise her from the dead.
She sprang to her feet and went to the inner room, and looked
upon the tall mirror which reected her beauty day and night.
She saw a wild and weary face before her. With curious eager
eyes, in whose depths lurked lambent re, looked Claudia upon
herself. She searched with wild anxiety for fading colours and
distorting curves. Surely there were none. Surely, as she stood
there, half-veiled by her wondrous hair, she was still right beauti-
ful. She might do mischief yet. She might have hearts thrown
at her feetand tread upon them-- et, She had made one great
mistake, but it was not irretrievaiile Raphael's fatal foil, as
unerring as she was erring, had silenced for ever the only possible
witness against her. And the Seraph was secrecy incarnate. He
might despise her, but,he would suffer none else to do it. She
took good cheer, and made a great resolve of fresh conquest.-
Scarce had that resolve found detinite form when Margot tapped
at the door to say that Mr. Branscombe wanted to see er.
" Mr. Branscombe !" exclaimed Claudia, who felt certain it
could not be Raphael, and whose thoughts journeyed to he!
uncles, Walter and Marmaduke.
"Your papa, mademoiselle," said Margot.
Claudia hastily resumed her attire, and hurried to receive her
father. The old entleman looked bored.
" Really, Claudia," he said, " you look younger and fresher than
ever. Do you know, I find it's a perfect nuisance to have no
duns. The ople down at Idlechester and Kingsleat are so
beastly civil lefeel inclined to knock them down. I've got no
excitement now."
" How is the house getting on i" inquired Claudia.
" Slowlybut well. It will be an'oble place when it's nished.
But I don't want to live in it; I'm not it for a country gentle-

man's life. And I don't believe Raphael will ever settle down
quietly. You'd better pick out some well-conducted country
squire, Claudia, and go and live at Branscorubc." Claudia lauglu-d.
" 1 am not much tonder of a quiet life than you, apa. But an-
you going to stay in London? Everybodv is just eaving town."
" London ! Not if I know it. I shall go abroad: vou can
come with me if on like. You can be ban camarade, I 'now."
Indeed, Devil rauscombe had often found his daughter better
com any than his son. She had no troublesome e'eminacies, and
she id not possess that indolent obstinacy which made the Seraph
an unsatisfactory comrade unless he always had his own way.
Among the many varieties of wives I should think the femmc
bon camarade, as Devil Branscombe put it, must be one of the
best. There is the " superior woman," a remarkably nice party
to marry. And then there is her very opposite. Well, the " natural
woman" is far superior to the "superior woman "but when
Dame Nature takes it into her grand maternal head to say
"I will make
A lady of my own,"
the resultis sometimes a little namby-pamby. As for the "accom-
plished woman," who draws and dances and plays and sings as if
she were the majority of the Muses rolled into one, anybody may
have her- for me. Preferable, doubtless, is the "domestic woman"
who has Cussy and Ude and Sover and Francatelli and Dr.
Kitchener and Miss Acton and Crefydd at her ngers' ends,
and would rather he roasted at the stake herself than allow the
cook to over-roast a woodcock. Admirable, also, is the pretty
statesworuanthe Mrs. Coningsby and Lady Vivian Ashleighof
the two greatest living novelists. But the varieties are endless ;
and of the rarest is the bon camarade. I rather think these fast
days will increase the class. Imagine a wife who can write a
leader, or smoke a cigar, or look after luggage, or understand Dad
or Bradshaw or the Owl as well as yourself 1 Is not the idea
pleasant? Would it not be better to Wed a woman who could be
with you at all hours, than one whom you must leave in order to
give certain portions of your mind full play?
" It's half the world to me, dear,
It's all the world to you,"
says a modern poetaster. Why should there be the distinction?
Why should women lose half the world? There are a set of
strong-minded females who sse this absurdity, but would remedy
it by the far greater absurdity of setting up woman as a rival to
man. Pshaw, ye Cohbes and Martineaus ! What woman wants
is, not rivalry, but full partnership. Educate young girls to
regard their future career as involving the most intimate associa-
tion with men, and the happiness of the human race will be
doubled. At present the two halves of the race are at war; and
it is a proverb that a man of genius can seldom get on with his

wife. The eagle nds a mate whose "stormy scream" has no less
terror than his own; the lioness is no slower in deeds of death
than the black-maned monarch by whose side she crouches. Only
one-half of the human race fears to share the life of the other
half. But I think we shall mend these things.
"Where do you think of going?" asked Claudia.
" Naples," said her father. " Raphael will be there."
"Raphael will ! How do you know? "
" Simply because, strange to say, he wrote and told me so.
There is a possibility of somebody requiring his signature as well
as mine, and he positively was thoughtful enough to write and
say where he should be. Wasn't it good of him i"
" Wonderfully," said Claudia. "Oh, I am quiteready togo, papa.
Naples will be delicious just now, and I am very tired of London."
"Very well," said the old gentleman; "then that's arranged.
Can you start the day after to-morrow'l "" Yes."
" I'm at the Clarendon. I'll send over and let you knew what
time to be ready. Have you seen your Uncle Marmaduke or
Isola lately 'l "
" They are staying in Spring Gardens. Raphael turned their
house upside down. Didn't ou hear of it?"" N o."
" Well, let them tell you. ou'll laugh amazingly, I assure you."
" I was thinking they might like to go with us. Marmaduke
must nd it rather slow in London, where he knows nobody.
Sup ose you were to ask him 1"
"Oh yes, that I will. We should make quite a. respectable
family party, and rather astonish Raphael when we came down
upon him. I'll go round at once." So, as soon as Devil Brans-
combe had left her, the Panther ordered her carriage, and drove
to Spring Gardens. She found Isola at home. That little party
was thinking of Stephen Langton, I fear.
" Where is your father, cugina mia ?" said Claudia.
" I hardly know. He will be here soon, no doubt."
" Papa is going abroad, going to Naples, and roposes that you
and Uncle Marmaduke should come with us. hat do you say'.l "
" Delightful !" exclaimed Isola, clapping her fairy hands ;
"and I think papa will go, for he seems to have nothing at all to
do just now."
When the old Wolf came in, he expressed his perfect willingness
to join the party with his daughter. Thus hap ened it that they
four started together for Naplesthe fathers oping at least to
dissipate their ennui, the daughters hoping for far more than
thathoping for love. "I'll start afresh," resolved the Panther.
" I'm young yetand not ugly."
"I may see Stephen," thought Isola. " I hope I may."
A pagan maiden would have prayed Aphrodite for that result ;
a Roman Catholic would have besought the Virgin ora favourite
female saint. Wherefore not?
Raphael Branscombe, when he told his sire to write to him at

Naples, had no idea of being followed thither. He fancied the
old gentleman so thoroughly occupied with re-edifying the man-
sion of the Branscombes that nothing would attract him from that
pleasant occupation. His own idea was to mystify everybody as
tar as possibleto avoid everybody whom he knew. With this
object, which he had set before himself rather for the fun of the
thing than any real good he could do by it, he had bought a sail-
ing-boat at Genoa, which he tted up with considerable comfort,
and ran along the glorious coast, looking in at Spezzia. Leghorn,
Grosseto, Civita Vecchia, Terracinarunning round Ischia and
Ca ri, and at last settling down in the pleasant little Hotel Ris-
po '1 at Somnto.
"Sorrento, stella d'amore !"
exclaims Filicaia; and what sayeth Frederick Locker, Praed's
legitimate successor f-
" Sorrento ! Love's star ! Land
Of myrtle and vine !
I come from a far land
To kneel at thy shrine ;
Thy brows wear a garland,
Oh, weave one for mine !"
If Raphael had been passionately in love with sweet Anne
Page, and spendin with her a mad honeymoon of ecstatic elope-
ment, could there ave been a leasanter place for the purpose
than Sorrento'l I trow not. nluckily, this was not precisely
the Seraph's case. He had amused himself by another piece of fan
tastic disguise. He had provided himself with feminine attire,
which he was an adept at using, and always went ashore with
Anne in this amazing fashion. So there ran a rumour through
Naples that two eccentric Englishwomen were travelling about in
a sailing vessel ; and they were, up arently, two Englishwomen

wooer of Women, and antagonist of men. This being so, it seemed ,
highly unlikely that the Seraph would be detected by his relations.

in the morning, leaving Anne to amuse herself by wandering in
the orange grove, to cross the bay in a light skiff with, as sole
companion, in young Columbus, such as my dear old friend (who
has forgotten me), \Valter Thornbury, met at Genoa ten years ago.
And so one day, in the Street of the Giant, Raphaeldressed in
the blue serge dress with anchor buttons of gold and a at straw
hat of an English yachtswomanI and smoking jauntily a Russian
cigarettecame right upon Ralph Branscombe, and Marmaduke,
Claudia, and Isola. Not one of them recognised him, though
every one of them made some remark upon the eccentric English-
woman. Isola was charmed. The notion of lounging indepen-
dently througll the broad squares and street of a foreign city nr-
rided her greatly. The cigarette was the exquisite poetic climax.
" There! That's what I should like," she said. turning to look
at the lovely ap arition in navy blue. " Wouldn't you, Claudia?
What's the go of being in bella Napol'i, as they call it, with two
elderly gentlemen to look after one l Couldn't you and I manage
to escape, like yonder young woman, and smoke our cigarettes in
happy independence '1"
' I don't smoke," said the Panther, "though I used to take just
the rst whiff at dear old Raphael's cigars for him. Papa," she
went onfor the two gentlemen were also watching the depart-
ing Sera h in petticoats" have you found out anything about
Raphaeli) Has he arrived here yet '1 "
" He hadn't in uired for letters when I was at the Post Ofce
this morning. e may as well stroll that way now. He may
come at any moment."
But no inquiry had been made. The Seraph had given his
father an address simply for certain legal urposes. As his father
had reached Naples, he knew that his a dress was not wanted.
And he had no other correspondents. So he went not near the
Post Oiceand his father was baled. As, however, he did not
wish to lose sight of the old gentleman, in case of anything turn~
ing up, he ascertainedit was easy enoughwhere they lived, and
dropped a line to the Panther. It had delighted him to see her
so fresh and gay ; evidently she had not taken Sir Arthur's deuth
severely to heart. And he was glad to let her know that be for
gave her. So he wrote :
"DEAR. CLAUDImI was glad to see you looking well yester~
day. (He put yesterday to throw her off her scent.) I shall be in
this neighbourhood for some time ; don't expect to see me, how-
eVer. If you are about to leave, send a note to me at the Albergo

your beauty or quenched our courage. You may show this to

This note reached Claudia as she and her cousin sat in a bal-

cony looking over the beautiful servilc city to the sapphire bay,
with the pa e cone of Vesuvius on its shore, the sluggish white
smoke hiding its outline. Isola was gaily singing
" Chi non desidera, chi non apprezu,
Del ciel di Napoli tanta dolcezza !"
The Panther started at the well-known handwriting. Raphael's
rm bold autograph was very like Henry VIII.'s. She read it
through hurriedly. Isola's keen eye marked a blush upon her
ince. She read it through again slowly; then, looking up, she
met Isola's lance and smiled.
"Mayn't have a love-letter?" she asked gaily.
" Twenty, if you like ; but that is not a love-letter."
" You are a witch !"" Am I l Well, if I may guess, I should
say that comes from RaphaeL"
" You saw the handwriting i "
"Noby St. Januarius, who is the right saint to swear by
here, I should think. I guessed it from your looks."
"Then you're a witch," reiterated Claudia, "and I shall be
afraid to have 'ou look at me. Would you like to see the letter?
It is from Rap ael." Isola read it.
"Dear old Seraph !" she exclaimed. "Crafty, cunning old
Seraph ! Fancy his being here and seeing us, and our knowing
nothing about it ! Well, he is clever." That night, as Isola un-
dressed herself in solitude, a sudden thought ashed upon her.
There is something very curious in that abrupt electric ash of
thought, which brings back some vague idea of the past, giving
it shape and meaning. Hazlitt. in his " Table Talk," relates a
stnry of a man, who, prosecuted by government for some political
crime, and acquitted, went away into a solitary part of Wales
with intent to purge his brain of the sordid horrors of attorneys
and spies. After long sojourn with nature, it chanced that one
morning a man passed his window: he scarcely noticed him, but
all through the day he was miserable, and the unbetruying heart
of maternal nature could not console him. He was nervous, fret-
ful, worried; he knew not why. The evening explained; the
chance passer whose scarce-noticed face had thus a'ected him was
a hired scoundrel who had borne witness against him at his trial.
This phenomenon is not unlike the sudden revelation from what
seems an utter blank of a photogra hic picture, when mercurial
vapour is a plied. Few are they w 0 have not often ex erienced
itas did sola at this moment, when, brushing her wi d wealth
of hair, she suddenly felt sure that the handsome Englishwoman
in blue serge yachting costume, coolly smoking a cigarette, was
Raphael, and none other. Yes ; she was absolutely certain. She
wondered Claudia had not detected him. She resolved not to say

and recognisant. No Seraph ! The very next day the whim had
seized him to ascertain what had become of Fiordilisa. He knew
it was erilous ; but peril was pleasure. The Lily of Isola Rossa
might e dead of griefif so, his life was not worth ve minutes'
purchase. But he would know. After all, the Lily had loved
im passionately, and had been lovedpretty well. So he left
Mrs. Morll under the care of Louis, charging her to avoid
strangers and keep within Rispoli's gardens and orange groves;
and then, with young Columbus for sole comrade, he made for
Corsica in his Genoese shing-boat. But winds and currents were
against him ; he was driven into the Gulf of Terra. Nova in Sar-
dinia ; and,leaving his boat there, he made his way across the hills
to Leave Sardo. There was no difculty in crossing to Bonifazio.
When he ascended, wearily enough, that inverted pyramid of rock
on which the town stands high above the sea, he felt he was again
in the very island of romance. They call this rock of Bonifazio
the seventy-second wonder of the world ; but as Raphael Brans-
combe entered the old fortress gate and looked back at the dizzy
steep which he had climbed, and over the straits, golden in the
sunset light, he said within himself" This is the gate of wonder.
Through this I enter the realm of romance."
Leaving young Columbus to await his return, he hired horses
and a guide, and made straight across the hills for Isola Rossa.
It was a. glorious ride, but terrible for its toil. Mighty hills, wild.
rivers, stately forests of chestnut, wondrous views over pale
peaks and misty gorges to the cerulean sea beyond; with this
wealth of beauty his eve was delighted as he made his resolute
way northward. Seldom was there a locanda at which to eat or
sleep; but hos itable priests and godlike oatherds gave him
their best, and e saw a simple, noble, rude omeric life. And,
leaving his babyish love behind him, Raphael Branscombe had
for awhile a touch of nobleness, and thought with remorse of his
long absence, with joy of again pressing the pure lips of the Lily
of Isola Rosss.
CHAPTER XXXI.
BEHIND IN LONDON.
UMPHREY MORFILL'S wound kept him for some time
a prisoner. When he was able to leave the house his sole
resolve was to discover what had become of his wife, and to obtain
revenge. He had thrown up his Eastern appointment, which in-
deed could not be kept open for him, requiring instant perfor-
mance. He threw aside all his occupations, legal and literary,
and concentrated all his faculties, and devoted all his time, in
order to trace his lost spouse and avenge himself. He was like

an express engine, which. doing its mile a minute from London
towards Bristol, is turned by the switches upon another line, and
continues with undiminished speed and power away towards
Birmingham. The dynamic force which had driven Humphrey
Nor-ll on the path of ambition drove him now with no less
velocity on the path of revenge. As soon as he was well enough
to move about he restlessly sought the solution of the mystery.
He went to detectives. offered heavy rewards, and kept u a per-
petual excitement. A good many ost-chaises had left ondon
on that fatal Tuesday evening. mong those which Morll
traced was one which took a lady and gentleman, with their ser-
vant, to a dull market town on the borders of Wiltshire and
Berkshire. The proprietor of the post-chaise did not know the
gentleman who hired it, could not remember his personal a pear-
ance; the pOstillions were equally nnreminiscent; but um-
phrey resolved to follow the scentits he had done in several
previous cases. So he travelled down to the place at which the
post-chaise had been dismissed.
Honest stupidity bafes an inquirer more completely than
anything else. The landlord of the Bear remembered the early
arrival of a post-chaise, and that the lady went to bed for some
hours, and that the gentleman hired a trap and went away in it.
The 'conveyance was sent back, but he did not remember who
brought it. The gentleman paid like a lord. The lady was very
pretty. This was about all that Humphrey could make out of
the landlord, landlady, waitress, chambermaid, and ostler.
What was the gentleman like? This was a point on which
anybody who had seen the Seraph might be expected to give in-
telligible evidence. But there are folk who, like the pagan idols,
have eyes yet see not. Indeed, the perceptive faculty requires
education as much as any other faculty ; and there are qulte as
many people who have no eye as there are who have no ear.
Music is the only sensuous art which has been scientically
treated ; the eye has loflier functions than the ear, yet there has
been no attempt to teach the use of those functions. Do We not
see upon the canvas ot'many a modern painter beings and things
which anybody might worship without breaking the second com-
mandment? And if painters paint what they have never seen,
nor ever will see, and call it nature, what shall be expected from
the ordinary public 1 If the eye cannot obtain justice, whatho e

To gain warm kisses from the wooing south ;
There is no blossom, theme of poet's pen,
Dowered with like beauty to the cyclamen."
But sweeter than any breath of owerand more suggestive of
delight than the most exquisite bouquet of choicest claretis the
odorous breath of a healthy young girl,
" With red lips breathed apart
By the music of her heart."
As to the zesthetic of taste, that I fear must continue undeveloped,
so long as the epicure, poet of the palate, is stigmatised with
grossnessso long as
" God sends us good meat, but the devil sends cooks."
Well, thanks to the utter absence of the eye's education, the
people at the Bear were entirely at issue among each other as to
what manner of man he was who brought thither the beautiful
lady in the ostchaise. That he was a remarkable man to look
upon they al agreed; but the majority held that he was a tall
man, rather gigantic, indeed, than otherwise, with a vast quantity
of raven-black hair. Humphrey could remember no man of his
acquaintance whom this description tted even loosely. It' is to
be observed that he had given up his notion of Ra hael's being
the person he sought, having sagaciously conclu ed that the
Seraph would have candidly confessed what he had done when
the matter had led to a hostile meeting between them. And,
indeed, he told his second and his surgeon, so soon as his senses
returned to him, that he regretted having wronged Mr. Brans
combe by his suspicionsaphrase which found itsway to the papers.
Humphrey could not discover whither the errant gentleman
and lady had driven in that hired conveyance. He explored in
all directions, but somehow did not reach the historic town be-
yond the chalk downs in which Ra hael had taken brief rest. So
from this journey, as from many iefore, he returned bafed and
disa pointed. But the ardour of pursuit was not checked. On
the gay of his return he dined at the Chandos with Frank Maule.
Frank, whose love of difcult inquirv we know, was much in-
terested in this investigation of )[ortill's. His opinion, however,
differed from Humphrey's in regard to Ra hael. He had noticed
the Seraph's peculiar tone towards Hump rey, and had inferred
that he knew more about Mrs. Morll than he cared to tell.
"You have done nothing yet," he said, as they waited for dinner.
"Nothing. I went on a fool's errand yesterday, and have
come back bafed. I found myself in pursuit of a tall man with
a canine mane, black as jet. Do you know any such person'l "
" I have heard a curious story to-day," said Maule. " You
know Hudson, who married Lady Emilia Hastings 1 "
" I don't know him. I have heard of him as immensely rich."

" Awfully. Well, do you know his wife 1 "
" 1 saw her once at the opera. She's the Cleopatra style of
woman, rather."
"She is. Well, I hear that Hudson came upon a packet of letters
showing that she was on too intimate terms before her marriage
with Raphael Branscombe, and that she has not renounced her
intimacy."" By Jove !"
"That's not all. Some of this corres ondence showed that the
old Countess found out the a'nir, an that she afterwards, and
in consequence, pushed on the marriage. N ow the old lady is
dead ; and, if she did what is said of her, why but there, it's
no good to speculate. What I hear is that Hudson used the old
lady's name Very freely, not to say foullythat Shotlesbrooke
heard of itand that they're going to ght to~morrow morning."
" Do you think you are well informed 'I"
"It reached me through Aylnier, who is very intimate with
Shottesbrooke, and who is to be his second. You know what
sort of fellow the young Earl is 'l "-" No."
" Then I'll tell you. I don't know another man like him. He
is a child in purity, a Bayard in courage, almost a Christ in piti-
fulness. He is spotless, if any man ever was. He is only two or
three-and-twenty, but far older men who know him reverence
him. And for him to be mixed up in so vile an a'air ! "
" \Vhat will he do, think you 7 "
" Meet Hudsom of course ; that rst. If he survives, I should
predict that he will follow Ra hael Branscombe"
" To the death !" said Mor ll ercely.
" I don't know. I am not sure that he would deem that right.
"'e shall see."
"Branscomhe is an infernal scoundrel," said Morll after a
ause. " I wish I had shot him !"
" \Vhy'l What quarrel have you with him l "
"None, of course, but he deserves to be shot. If he meets the
young Earl, he'll surelv kill him. He's a end, I think. Why
should he have provoked me that day, instead of saying in a
straightforward way that he knew nothing of my wife?"
Frank Maule leaned back in his chair, and reected. Should
he tell Morll his suspiciona suspicion so strong that it almost
amounted to certainty? Why not? Morll could not again.
challenge Raphael ; all he could do was to search for his wife.
" Could he say that?" he asked at length. Morll half rose
from his chair.
" Why shouldn't he? What do you know 7" he exclaimed.
" I know nothing. I merely think that Raphael Branscombe
is your man, from the way he talked to you that night. Does he
dislike you? Has he any reason to dislike you 1"
"He intended to marry his cousinmy wife, you know, for
her money."
"Ah," said Maule, "then that supplies a motive. He may

have taken away your wife, less from love of her, than from hatred
of you. That would be his disposition, if I am anyjudge." Mor-
ll struck the table with his clenched st.
"By God 2" he exclaimed, "I believe you're right. Where is
he? I'll nd him, by Heaven !"
"Quiet, my dear fellowquiet !" said Manle.
Their collo uy had been carried on in the lowest possible tone
of voice, and umphrey's sudden excitement called attention to
the remote table at which they sat.
"It will be a Very strange thing," said Frank Mauls after a
pause, "if we cannot discover what has become of so Well-known
a man as Raphael Branscombe. We'll make inquiry this very
evening. If my theory is right, you have only to oVertake him
in order to nd Mrs. Morll. But don't be hasty. You know
he has fought you once."
" He is a liar l" said Humphrey. "I'll murder him."
" My dear Morll, don't give way to excitement. Of course I
know you have been very badly treated, and that it is difcult to
keep cool; but depend upon it, if you can be cool, it will give
you an immense advantage. However, let us devote the evening
to inquiry."
This was done, but at rst with no satisfactory result. They
ascertained that Raphael had lelt England, but could not discover
in what direction. It was pretty clear, however, that he had left
England alone. This was perplexing. Frank Maule was a man
by no means disposed to give up an inquiry because it was dif-
ficult. Indeed, this gave a. keenness to the edge of his desire,
and caused him to become more fertile in. suggestions. And at
last, after they had made many legitimate experimentsand the
night was growing luteand Hum hrey Mortill was becoming
surly and savageand Frank himse f was feeling deucedly tired
of the whole aifairit suddenly occurred to him to visit a certain
quarter of London where you and I, decorous reader, have never
spent an hour, and where indeed life is at this period far slower
than it was in the days of the Marquis of Waterford. And in
that piqnant pooh-pooh purlieuthat orid -ti eld of ash and
fancythey encountered a. little bird. A very pretty little bird,
exquisite of shape, brilliant of luniage, with the sweetest beak
and greediest claws in the wor d, with a marvellous thirst for

to Audubon and Wilson, chirped and carolled musical news
of the Seraph. And the burden of that news was" Bella
Napols'l"
" I shall go over at once," said Morll.
" I'll go with you," said Frank Maule, " if you'll wait till to-
morrow. I've no particular occupation at present."
" Wait till to-morrow!" exclaimed Humphrey. "You didn't
expect me to start for the coast at once, surely."
' Well, I don't know. You seemed rather impetuous. How-

ever, I really will go with you, and tomorrow we shall perhaps
have another c0mrade."-" What do You mean 'l"
"Why, whether Shotteshrooke lilllS Hudson or Hudson
Shottesbrooke, the survivor will surely look after Branscombe.
And there is no time to be lost."
The character which Frank Maule had given of the young
Earl of Shottesbrooke was no exaggeration. He was the fair ideal
of a Christian gentlemanor rather would have been, if Froissart
had written a fth gos e1. There was a certain gentlemanly
monarch of the United ingdom (thank God, he was not King
of England) of whom a poet wrote
"A noble nasty course he ran,
Supremer lthy and fastidious,
He was the world's rst gentleman,
And made the appellation hideous."
Not such sort of gentleman was Lord Shottesbrooke. He was
the Sir Galahad of the nineteenth century. Boy though he was,
his native purity made his intellectual eyesight keen, and he
judged character more truly than many an experienced man of
the world. Knavery marVelled to nd itself fathomed of this
lordly child. I have called the young Earl a Christian gentle-
man. This, of a surety, he was. But he was a knightin the
highest sense of that glorious monosyllable. Sir Philip Sidney
would have welcomed him as a true bruther-in-urms. Cownrdice,
dishonour, falsehood, Were things to him unimaginable. He was
chivalry's noblest product.
Conceive, dear reader, what I cannot describethe grief and
shame of this young nobleman when the conviction was forced
upon him that his sister had been false to her husbandav, and
more, and innitely worse, that her fair fame had been soiled in
her maidenhood, and that her dead mother was her accomplice l

with the knowledge that his mother and his sister had done such
deeds as men attributed to them. But the morning came, and
with it the chill uncomfortable meeting. The Earl felt neither
nervous nor bloodthirsty ; he longed for death, and felt a denite
piesentiment that what he longed for would not come. It would
hard to say how he felt towards the man whom he had chal-
lengedhis sister's husband. By no means inclined to kill him,
certainly. Possibly Mr. Hudson felt similarly towards his brother-
in-lawfor both men red in the air. And when the a'air
was over, and Brabazou Aylmer was going to take his principal
off the ground, that young nobleman walked across to Hudson,
and said" George, shake hands. I don't know how this affair
will end. I wish I had been dead before it began. But it cannot
end here. We must nd that man who has brought us so much
misery and shame. He must not escape."
" I don't know, my lord," said Hudson laintively. " I don't
think he is a man. I look u u him as 9. end."
" Where is he i What has ccome of him 'l " inquired the Earl.
" I Wish I knew !" exclaimed Hudson.
" I think I know where he is," said the Earl's second, Brabazon
Aylmer.-" How so 1" said the Earl. -
" Simply thus :Frank Maule knew of this business. He
came to my rooms at about three this morning, and said, 'You
will want, in an hour or two, to know where Branscombe is.. He
is at Na Ies.' "" How did he know '1 "
"Hu son called Branscombe a end just now," said Aylmer.
" He spoke truth. You are not the only men who are in keen
pursuit of him. Only last night was it discovered where he had
gone, and the rst vessel will take a resolute avenger in search
of him. God knows by whose hand he will rst meet punish-
ment."
" I'll tell you what," said Hudson, "from all I have seen and
heard of that man, I believe no one of us will punish him. How-
ever, let us make trial. How soon can we start for Na les'l"
A curious conversation after a meeting at Chalk arm. Its
result was that Lord Shottesbrooke and Hudson joined Morll
and Maule in their expedition. A week later the four gentle-
men were to be seen in the pleasant, lazy streets of the Siren
City, Parthenope, though assuredly without any ideas in their
heads of either laziness or pleasure. Inquiries soon led them to
the palazzo in the Strada Monte di Dio, ivhere the Branscombes
had taken up their quarters. Their cards were sent up one
languid morning, when the ladies were lying on couches and
watching the magical movement of the slow Vesuvian smoke.
" Four Englishmen !" exclaimed the Panther, scrutinising those
polished parallelograms. " ' Lord Shottesbrooke '--ah, he's a nice
ellow; but he's engaged to Gerard Morley's daughter, so he's no\
good. 'Hudson 'there are so many Hudsonsoh, this must
be the one that married Shottesbrooke's sister. ' Maule 'dou't

know him. ' Morll 'know him, rather. What can bring him
here, lsola ? "
" l'm sure I can't imagine," replied that young lady indolvny.
" A sk him. I su pose you're going to let them come up by and by."
They were a mitted, and Maule, as the most collected of the
arty, ex laiued that they had expected to nd Mr. Raphael
ranscom at the Palazzo. Would he be in soon?
"If you could answer the question you have asked," replied
the Panther. "we should be much obliged to you. Papa came
over to Naples purposely to meet Ra hael, who said he would be
here, and nothing as been heard 0 him. He is very erratic in
his movements, and, I sup use, has altered his mind."
Humphrev Morll decidhd at once that Claudia was uttering
falsehood. There was a sullen gleam in his eye that told of this.
The other three looked doubtful. Lord Shottesbrooke had vet
to learn that it was ossible for a lady to lie, he therefore he-
lievedand wonde . Hudson simply wondered. Frank Maule
renewed his questionings. Isola looked from one to another of
the group with a perplexity in those marvellous eyes of hers.
She alone knew that she had seen Raphael in Naples. She
wondered why these four men were anxious to discover him.
She wondered why he chose to hide from them.
" Pei-ha 5 they think he's afraid of them," she thought scorn-
fully. " he don't know the Seraph. I guess he's amusing
himself, and on't choose to be interrupted." Her conjecture was
not a wild one, as we know. Presently Devil Branscombe and
the old Wolf returned from their stroll, and from lounging at the
Ca'e d'Europa.
" Friends of Raphael's, eh?" said Ralph Branscombe. "I
can't make out what's become of him. He wrote to say he
should be here, for there were some legal documents he expected
to have to sign. I have been able to hear nothing of him from
post ofce or passport people. And I have already stayed here
rather longer than I intended, because, if I miss him, I don't know
when I may nd him again. He wanders all over the world."
The four visitors could see that this was the truth.
" Won't you, gentlemen, dine with us?" said the Wolf hos-
pitably. " We can't give you an English dinner, you know, but
our cook shall do her best."
" Thank you," said the young Earl, " unfortunately it is im-
possible. I wish it were otherwise."
They took leave. As they walked to their hotel, Maule re-
marked" They evidently have no idea where Raphael Brans-
comhe is. We can do nothing with them. "'e must wait."
" He is expected here," said the Earl.
" I was not quite satised with the woman's looks," said Mor-
ll. " I fancy the little one, at least, knows something."
" What can we do now '1 " 3:de Hudson despairingly.
"Play a waiting game," answered Maule. " Our quarry will

turn up where the rest of the brood are. Of course it isn't as
easy for you to be patient, with your passionate interest in the
quest, as for me, who regard it as a simple scientic problem.
There is the more reason that you should put yourselves in
my hands." Frank Maule quite enjoyed his captaincy. He had
three men to keep in order, all as different as possible. He had
very little idea as to what would happen when they ran down
their foe. But he deemed it his duty to keep his men well in
hand, and was quite determined that neither of them should do
anything premature or rash, if he could help it.
" What did those four fellows want of Raphael 1" growled the
old Wolf on their departure. " They seemed devilish anxious to
nd him."
" If they want anything he don't like, they'll be devilish
anxious to get away again, when they do nd him," said Devil
Branscombe.
"I sup ose," remarked Claudia to Isola, as those two young
ladies, wit true Parthenopean laziness and languor, were loiter-

" Very much," said Isola. " Let's ho e they mayn't nd him."
" Why 7 " inquired the Panther. " on don't suppose he'd be
afraid of themfour to one even? "
" Not a bit of it. I meantfor their sakes."
And emitting one of those silvery laughs of hers, Isola in-
dulged in a pirouette that shook all her curls like the leaVes of a
birch tree tossed by the west wind, and then announced herself
ready for dinner. It was not unconducive to the merriment of
her young heartthe idea that, Raphael being at Naples, Stephen
Langton must be somewhere near. How wrong she was !

devils. That. theory of external innonrc is absurd. That it
could ever have obtained has always put lexed me. The wisest
utterance of any living man is Matthew mold's
" We mortal millions live alone."
This is the true key to the knowledge of humanity, if such
knowledge be obtainable, which I doubt. But that any man,
knowing himself, or making any conscientious attempt- to know
himself, should honestly believe in the existence of evil inuences
outside himself, is to me perfectly astounding.
" The world, the esh, the devil." Those three. Verily there
have been sermons enough about them since somebody (Paul, was
it l) thus classied the antichristian inuences. Well, let us look
at them. What is the world! Simply and solely the agglome-
ration of men and womenThackeray's " Vanity Fair," Tom
Robertson's " Society." Nothing more. Shun the world, exclaims
Ecclesiastes. How? A meeting of Quakers and Quakeresses is
the world. Let the ve wisest virtuousest men that ever lived
sup with the ve wise virgins (if there ever were so many) and
you havethe world.
What is the esh? Humph ! Inquire of the poets and nove-
lists. Is there a rhyme or a story worth reading that hasn't love
in it. If so, for the love of Heaven let me have a copy, that I
may imitate it. But, sav you, that's all ction ; take the history
of the world. "'ell, take it. Women have the making of it.
Never was there a great glory ora great mischief without a woman
at the heart of it. I don't believe the Siege of Troy was exactly
a myth. After all, however, what we call history reects a very,
very small portion of human life. The enormous mass of action
which is never recorded would, if it were possible to investigate
it, show the inuence of "the esh." And why should it not
have influence? Preach as ye will, e10 uent and emasculate
theologians, a beautiful woman will, to t e and of time, make
havoc with the hearts of men ; nor will a man in whom intellec-
tual and physical power and beauty meet be without inuence
over what it is the custom to call the hearts of women.
As to "the devil"-well, this must be deemed a theologico-poetic
invention. When passion becomes madness, when the forces at
work in the breast of man or woman are so potent, so furious, as
to astound the average animal, the average animal naturally ima-
gines some external power. Hence the devil gets the credit of
thoughts and actions which lie beyond the common level ofhuman
nature. If he cares about reputation or renown he ought to be
greatly obliged to us all. However, Stephen Langton had read
"Faust," and was too young to entertain ideas like these, which
never come to a man till he is thirty-ve, or to a woman at all :
and so he ascribed Me histophelean inuence to Raphael Brans-
combe. And, a great eliever in dreams and destiny, he thought
there was something "uncanny " in his suddenly and unexpect-

edl encountering the Seraph on that coral-reddened sea-sand of
Iso a Rossa. He had ed from England and thrown himselfupon
Seagull Palliser, simply for the purpose of escaping from the
Branscombes, with whom he had inextricably involuntarily been
connected from his boyhood. And at Ajaccio he is accosted by
Raphael Branscombe's wife; and at lsola Rossa, when he lands
with that lady on the beach~ he nds himself face to face with
Raphael Branscombe himself ! You know if a fellow met with
that sort of thing in a novel he'd say it was perfectly absurd.
Stephen, whose visionary tendencies were the very growth of
his nature, was much impressed by the coincidence. It appeared
to him as if it was impossible for him to escape from the in uence
of this strange family. He began to think he had better not try.
He pined to be free; he longed to nd real work to do in the
world; above all, he longed with all the strength of a poetic
nature, for that which he had more than once so nearly gained
so narrowly losta woman's love. A true woman's true love,
Stephen wanted. Not much to want, you may say.
A at much I Worth more than the empire of the universe,
physical or intellectual. Better to be truly loved by a true woman
than to be Caesar or Shakespeare. That opens another question.
What is the good of having such love if you cannot a preciate it?
Cmsar or Shakespeare would probablyand have all) their other
gifts into the bargain. I fancy those Sonnets of Shakespeare's
mean the very hottest re of lovethat re which scorches the
moist marrow in the strong bones of men.
Let us return to our muttonsto Raphael and Ste hen,pacing
the sands of Isola Rossa, at eventide, when the sapp ire sea was
a vision, and the saffron sunset a lyric, and the soft snsurrus
of the sweet South a breath from paradise. that explanation
Raphael had made to Angelo and Fiordilisa I know not. He
was plausible enough. Fiordilisa believed him thoroughly, of
course. With her, as with all loving women, love had trust as a
companion. She had never for an instant doubted Raphael. He
might be dead, wounded, in prisonhe could not be false. What
a ity, you may say, that such faith should be wasted on such
fa sehood ! Not so. Better far to have loved and trusted and
been ruthlessly betrayed than never to have loved at all. Even
Angelo Moutalti seemed at last to accept Raphael Bransconibe's
explanations. but there was an occasional look of the old Corsi-
can's which the keen-eyed Seraph noticed, and did not approve.
I have never been able to learn whether Angelo returned to its
casket that ivory-hafted dagger.
Raphael and Stephen, then, were pacing the shore. They had
dined at the Casa Monialti in the enjoyable primaeVal style,
which made Stephen think of the Odyssey. They nad drunk some
of Angelo's oldest and choicest wine, and followed it with coffee

itephen was poetic in moodquoting some rhyme, the product
of t to day.
" "'e talk of Thetis and Oceanus
Myths of old Time. The songs melodious
Of Grecian years, the Graybeard, as he passes
On to the unknown end,
Doth with new meanings blend.
We Goths have changed the gods of the old Greek faith

"Goths, indeed !" exclaimed the Seraph. " Never saidst thou
a truer word. I'm a Greek, at any rate. I don't substitute
oxygen, hydrogen, azotea chemical trinityfor Zeus and Posei-
don and Aidoneus. I believe, if I had been an Argonaut, 'l'hetis
with the silver foot would have preferred me to Peleus. But it's
too late unluckily." They were silent for a turn or two.
"Vl'here's Palliser gone with his yacht? " asked Raphael after
a utise.
" He talked of running over to Naples," said Stephen. " He'll be
back in two or three days, and then I must proceed on my Odyssey."
"L00k here, old fellow. I want you to do me a favour. I
have left some matters to be settled in Sardinia, where I came
from last. Now will you stay here till I return? It will only
be a few days. You can keep Palliser, I know."
" When shall you start 'l " asked Stephen.
" Oh, I'll go to-morrow. I wouldn't go at all if I could help
itbut I have left things that positively must be attended to."
This was a fact, we know. l'here was young Columbus wait-
ing for him at Bonifazioand his boat at T erranovaand Anne
Page under Louis's care at the Hotel Rispoli. There were four
men waiting for him at Naples toobut that he knew not.
However, it was clearly requisite for him to make some less
temporary arrangement for Mrs. Morl], before he settled down
quietly in Corsicawhich, strange to say, had become his inten-
tion. Yes, it was so. The Seraph had at last discovered the
innite value of a pure love. The miserable method of his life
hitherto began to strike him as contemptibly foolish. He would.
have given a good deal not to have embarrassed himself with
Mrs. Morll. He despised her. He despised himself'for having
been such a confounded ass as to run away with her, chiey to
annoy her husband. "'hy should he want revenge on the man 7

him. Not long, and Fiordilisa would be a mother. Not long,
and he would have a child to succeed him as head of the long line
of Branscombes of Branscombe. A son, as fearless and acute as
himself, as truthful and loving as Fiordilisa! How he would
love such a boy !how nobly might such a Branscombe atone
for the faults and follies of his forefathers. Or a daughter, may-
hap ; well, a daughter like Fiordilisa would be a good gift from
God. So thought the Seraph; and so thinking, he made imme-
diate resolve to return to Sorrento, to make some arrangement for
the wellbeing of the woman with whom he had foolishly incum-
bered himself, and then to return to Isola Rossa, to Fiordilisa, to
the only home and the only love he had ever known. Thus re-
solved, he induced Stephen to promise to remain at the Casa
Montalti till his return. And when he announced to old Angelo
the necessity for his going to Sardinia, and possibly to the Conti-
nent for a few days, so obviously sincere was his regret at leaving,
so joyful his hope of return, that the noble old Corsican began to
accuse himself of entertaining wrongful suspicions of his loyalty.
As to Fiordilisa, that darling of the island of romance heard
joyfully of his intention to depart, because when he returned he
was to return for ever. No more severancetill the Death Angel
came to sunder for a time the bonds of love. The thought lled
her with perfect happiness. And when the Fantasia was made
ready, with Marc Antonio as his comrade, to take him round to
Bonifazio -while, as often heretofore, all the dwellers in the little
town turned out to see him otfFiordih'sa clung to him with a
loving kiss, and whispered" Come back soon, Ra'aelle: you
know why." What joy sparkled in the divine depths of her eyes
as she said these words !
So away went the Fantasia, light almost as the foam, with
Raphael on boardcarrying, for the rst time, I believe, in his
life, a noble resolve in his heart. Mephistopheles had broken
down in his part, that was quite clear. The Fantasia brought
the Seraph to Ajaccio rst, and thence to Bonifazio. There, hav-
ing found young Columbus, he dismissed Marc Antonio. And
retracing the precise route by which he had arrived, he found
himself at Sorrento once moreat the Hotel Rispoliwith Sweet
Anne Page. Andwith a problem to solve. A diicult ro~
blem, such as men have not usually to solve many times in a ife-
time. A problem that would utterly throw into the shade some
of the diabolical roblems which my mathematical tutor had the
cruel iniquity to ase on the fth and sixth books of that unut-
terahle scoundrel, Euclid. Have you ever been asked, gentle
reader, "to construct a right-angled triangle, having given the
sum of the base and perpendicular, and the sum of the base and
hypothenuse," or to prove that "there can be only ve regular
solids," or to " nd a point such that tangents drawn from it to
touch two given circles shall contain a given angle'l" Let me
hope that you have not. I hora I am not at all likely to forget it.

However, the Seraph's problem transcended this. It was : How
to get rid of Anne Page and return quietly to the Lily of Isola
ltoasa. An amazin problem. For, to begin with, the Seraph
was a man not to missed from the London horizon without
some e'ort on the art of friends and associates to trace him to
his hiding place. e had exactly the popularity you might ex-
pect. He ad the two great elements of popularity. He was
oval 'lClle was dangerous. How could a man both ovable and
dangerous vanish utterly from the ken of all who loved and
feared him without being missedwithout being pursued by the
ery erceness of both enemies and friends?
Then, in the next place, there was poor little Anne to dis use
of. How to do that 't This puzzled Raphael considerably w ile
on his voyage from Terranova to Sorrento. The child loved him
-that was the worst of it. She had surrendered her life for him.
And the new feelingutterly new to himwhich had sprung up
in his heart for Fiordilisa, made him unwilling to act cruelly to
the foolish child, whom he had brought to Sorrento, taking her
away from her husband. What was he to do with her? That
was the great question of the momenta question almost un-
answerable. It occupied him all through his leasant voyage from
Isola Rossa to Ajaccio, from Ajaccio to Boni azio, from Bonifazio
across the enchanted straits. Equally did it oucupy him from
Terranova to Sorrento. What could he do with her? Here was
a beautiful little creature, in whom (as if she were an Undine)
he had awakened a soulwhom he had severed from the highly
respectable world wherein she lived, and from all the duties of
her life, and who now lived upon his love, and obeyed him as if
he were a god, and thought of nothing but him ; and it was his
especial object to get rid of her. Why, myriads of men would
be delighted to nd themselves in his positionin the position
whence he chiey desired to escape. What to do with the foolish
child whom, in a foolish freak, he had taken from her home?
That was the point. It perplexed him. But never for a moment
did he falter in his resolve quietly to get rid of her.
Though, be it observed, the strong love which had lled his
heart for Fioniilisa made him very pitiful towards Anne. Heartillylv
did he wish he had never enticed her away from that 'm du
quiet Mesopotamian terrace. Heartily; did he wish t ere was
some magical way of restoring her to er stupid clever lawyer-
husband without fracas or esclandre. It could not be. He must
ust accept his fate with all its annoyances. Raphael had all his
lifebeen accepting his fate. He had neverhesitated, whether woman
or man was in the way. His creed had been something like this
"My want's at the worst, so why should I spare
(Since just such a thing my want supplies)
This little girl with the silky hair,
And the love in her two large eyes?"
The Seraph, I have said, had never shrunk from accepting his

286 SWEET ANNE PAGE
fate. He would have gone with imperturbable coolness to an
interview with either Satan or A hrodite. But his mind was
changed, the poetr of his life h come. He had set his heart
on this beautiful ittle Corsican, divinely ure. I don't know
that the man was ermanently changed. lieopards and Ethio-
pians are proverbia y diicult. Anyway he had found out that
there is such a thing as love ; and when this discovery is for the
rst time made by a man who is physically and mentally above
the common -level of menby a man who has had his experiences,
and knows the world, and has arrived at a mature ageit gene-
rally has adisturbing effect. I assure you it disturbed our friend
the Seraph. He was, I think for the rst time in his life sorely
perplexed. You see, he had always been a decidedly clever ama-
teur actor in the amorous comedyor even tragedy of life. But
he was now in a new position. For the rst time the thing was
real. He really lovsd this little Corsican; this had brought him
back to her, contrary to the uidance of that extremely common
sense which ordinarily rule his actions; this had determined
him to get rid of this poor foolish child whom he had taken away
from her husband, whatever might happenand the love which
he bore towards Fiordilisa lled him with pity for the woman
whom he had determined to desert. Well, Raphael Branscombe
reached the Hotel Rispoli at Sorrento, where I may at present
leave him for a while to settle affairs with Mrs. Morll. Mean-
while, as we haVe noticed, Seagull Palliser had run across to the
Continent for a cruise, and had looked in at Naples. It was
hardly to be expected that he should enter that pleasant city with-
out encountering Englishmen. Of course he encountered those
four Englishmen who were searching for Raphael Branscombe.
But Seagull Palliser, though rather a hare-brained young
yachtsinan, was not a man to betray a friend. He could not be
ong in the company of Lord Shottesbrooke, Humphrey Morll,
George Hudsonto say nothing of Frank Maulewithout dis-
covering that they sought Ra hael Branscombe, and sought him
with hostile intent. He foun out quickly enough that Raphael
was presumed to have taken away Morll's wife. He wasn't the
sort of man to care much about anybody's wife. He saw there was
a row brewing ; he had heard enough of the Seraph to be sure he
could take his own part in the row; he thought the best thing
he could do was to return to Isola Rossa and warn him. So
after enjoying a pleasant day or two in Naples7 and. after having
had several confabulations with Frank Maule, who saw clearly
that Palliser knew something of Raphael, but. could not nd
out what, our yachtsman started again for Corsica. Too late.
These two monosyllables come with diabolic fretLuency into a life
history. Raplhael was gone. Palliser conded to btephen Langton
all that he ad learnt. Stephen was perfectly astounded. Of
course he was aware that his little sweetheart of childhoodthe
baby beauty of Idlechesterwas quite ready to run away with

il' not, too pitifulthus to ruin her life. He could not under-
stand the position of a'airs. If he had really taken her away,
where was she now'l There must be some mistake.
Ste hen Langton saw that Rn hael truly loved Fiordilisa. lt

-as who would not lthat this love had existed from the
moment of their marriage. This being so, he could not imagine
that Raphael would have taken away Morll's wife, notwith-
standing that young lady's obvious infatuation. So he concluded
there was some mistake,and told Seagull Palliser that such must be
the case, wherein the Young yachtsman cordially agreed with him.
Unluckily it happene that among the crew of the Seagull there was
a man of inquisitive tendencies. This was the steward, or chief of
the commissariat. He was a capital fellow, for his especial business.
He was utterly incapable both of swindling his employer, and of
permitting him to be swindled. He was honesty incarnate. He
was too astute for the innumerable cheats of all nations, by whom
a generous English wanderer is customarily eeced. He saved
Seagull Palliser no end of money. He was a capital linguist
(unusual among Scotchmen), and could hold his own with most
men in most languages. One fault had Ralph Ramsayhe was
desperately inquisitive. Not a fault, rather a virtue, up to a
certain point, in a man holding his position. What yachtsman
would not rejoice in a steward who always managed to nd out

Innitely useful is such a man. But Ralph Ramsay's inquisi-
tiveness did not stop at this point. He had a mania~a hunger
nay, a thorough thirst for gossip ; a thirst comparable to that
which a man feels who has breakfasted on Yarmouth bloaters,
lunched on anchovy toast, pre ared himself for dinner with a
little Russian caviar, and drnn nothing. I remember learning
from the dear old grammar of Eton this adage, which probably
occurs in the works of some Roman poet :
"Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est."
Neither King Solomon nor my friend Mr. Martin Farquhar
Tupper ever said anything truer. And the cautiously inquisitive
man is often the most dangerous babblerfor the which there be
sound philoso hic reasons. I need not investigate these reasons at
present. Su ce it to say, that this in uisitive Scotchman brought
to Isola Rossa news which caused rat er an e'ervescence in that
pleasant Corsican town. How that news reached Angelo Mon-
talti, who can say? It did reach him, and the result was his
sudden disappearance, without much attempt to account for it.
The Fantasia had taken the Seraph to Bonifazio, but there was
another boat in the bay, the Jcsm and Mary, and in this did

the truth. He had business in Naples. Those who know any-
thing of the Corsican temperament are aware that such business
as Angelo Montalti deemed he had to transact with Raphael
Branscombe would be very decisive business indeed. And those
who have made anything like an acquaintance with my friend
the Sera h must be aware that it will be rather an awkward
a'air if e and Angelo should meet with denite purposes of
hostility and hatred. Which island would you bac , England
or Corsica?
CHAPTER XXXIII.
PADDINGAND CONFESSION-
I AM at present waiting for my publisher to inform me how
nearly I have approached the end of my book. You see, I
have not the slightest idea of giving the public too much for their
money. My literary tendencies are peculiar. I am, to begin
with, horribly lazy. I never use two words when one will do.
But, till I promised to ll a given number of pages with romance,
I had no idea in the world of the awful bore of occupying space.
I found that my laziness improved my style. Saying things
briey, I somehow said them well. Consequently I have got
into a charming habit of brevity and terseness ; and, if the
romance of your three-volume novel were to be com ressed into
a number of the Owl, here is a writer who would bac himself to
do it. Passion and power do not require time or space. If you
blow a man's brains out, the result is merelya red blot. I con-
fess that I have the greatest difculty in the world in making
my story the proper length for that aesthetic hydra, the British
Public. Not thatI care for the British Public, mind youas
mere criticseven though my publisher possibly may. N0 ; but
I care for them as appreciative friends. I don't care twopence
for your critical opinion, dear reader, of this absurd story; but
if you, being a woman, can with any pleasure read it at some
vacant moment when absence of living pleasure makes all litera-
ture seem like weak cold tea, or if you, being a man, can kick
off your boots in front of the re, and light a cigar or (better!) a
pipe, and read a chapter or two without yawning, and honestly
say, " Well, I rather like this fellow ! " then I shall be satised.
To tell the truth, I don't care about the opinion, even of the best
and fairest critics, of my literary nwers. I think I know their
value. As a poet, I am below rowning in insight, above him
in lyrical powers, and a trie above Tennyson in both, As a
novelist, I am less successful than Thackera , because I take less
pains, but far superior to your Trollopes or IVilkie Collinses.
Having made these statements, in which, I need not say, there

dents, it would save a world of trouble. But alas and nlack. the
rmlous few cannot somehow or other ll up those wide spaces
tween incident and incident. You have no idea, dear reader,
what an ine'able bore it becomes. For example, it is a chill
December night. A friend of mine has just come back from
Sweden, full of information concerning the habits of the dwellers
in that Lilliputian kingdom. He is ripe for talk, and pleasant
to listen to, and a nice chorus of petticoats surrounds him and
extracts his racy stories, while I am obliged to sit in a remote
corner of the vast saloon, and plod wearily away at this chapter.

However I, who know or knew all these people, am anxious to
bring them in an easy and artistic manner to the inevitable crisis
which I have foreseen ever since I began the chronicle of Stephen
Langton's boyhood and Anne Page's babyhood. And I perceive
that the crisis cannot long be retarded. Raphael Branscombe is
hurrying back to Sorrento (did you see my old friend Nai'tel's
picture thereof?) in order, in some way or other, to get quit of my
eroine, Sweet Anne Page. Across the most beautiful of bays
there watch for him three men who seek revenge, led by a fourth
who seeks nothing of the sort, but regards the pursuit as of
Scientific interest. Hudson and Lord Shottesbrooke follow him
to avenge Lady xEmiliaMorll to revenge his wife. The pre-
sence of a whole group of Branscombes in the city of Naples
rather increases the chances against the Seraph. And then, in
Isola Rossa itself, there is one more dangerous still. Angelo
Montalti has gathered from Ramsay's story suicient to revive his
ancient thirst for vendetta.
Stephen Langton was sore perplexed when he heard of Angelo's
disappearance. He too surely felt that it had a sinister meaning.
lint all that he could do was to remain and console Fiordilisa,
who at this moment needed the tenderth care. Our good friend
Stephen did not know who was most to be pitied for involuntary
connection with the Branscombes, the beautiful Corsican or him-
self. She, it was clear to him, on the verge of giving an heir to
the wild race, was also on the verge of a terrible tragedy. He
did not know what to make of the Seraph's departure and Mon-
talti's rapid movement so soon after ; but he could not help con-

llis visionary temperament felt the electric tnmb of events.
As to himself, it was really too bad. 1 think everybody will
agree with him. He had put himself on board the seagull, Pal-
liser's ~vacht, on purpose to avoid the whole clan of Branscombes,
and here he was left in charge of Raphael's wife. while Raphael
wentno one knew whither. It was a deal too bad.

" "THAT can have become of Raphael?" said the Panther
one morning, as she and Isola wasted the long, delicious
hours together.
"Can't guess," replied Isola. "My Own impression is, from
my knowledge of his habits, that he has gone off somewhere
beyond the regular route of ordinary mortalsAustralia per-
haps, or China, or Patagonia."
" I wish he'd turn up again. "'e're becoming dreadfully dull
here; and the two old gentlemenI almost said fogiesare
resolved to stay here till he comes; and something amusing
might arise in connection with those men who are in search of
him. I hope he isn't hiding from them."
"Hiding from them! I'm ashamed of you, Claudia. You
ought to know your own brother by this time. I don't believs
he is alraid of any creature upon earth."
" Enthusiastic darling ! " laughed the Panther. " I don't think
him a coward, I assure you, having better reasons, perhaps, than
your own for knowing that Raphael would face the devil him-
self. But he may be in hiding for reasons besides cowardice.
He may have run away with somebody, you know. And if he
is hiding 1 fear we shan't come across him till he chooses to
show himself. That's what I meant."
"I see," said Isola. "But do you know anybody he's likely
to have run away with?"
" Oh i" exelaimed the Panther, "what did those four men
want the other dayl Surely "--and she paused.
" Surely what, Claudia 7 "
"I was thinking of that silly little Anne. He can't have
thought her worth taking away. Yet what could Morll want i "
" I daresay he came as a lawyer," said Isola.
" Perhaps he did," replied Claudia reectively.
"I can't conceive Raphael's taking a fancy to that babyish
creature. But surely there isn't anything betWeen him and
Lady Emilia Hudson."
"It isn't much use our attempting to guess," said Isola.

" There is something uncommonly queer about it. But your
brother knows pretty well how to take his own art."
" That's true enough," said Claudia with a sig .
Both those young ladies knew that Ra hael had very recently
been in their immediate neighbourhoo , one of them indeed
having recognised him; but they also knew his erratic habits,
and felt by no means sure that he was still within the limits of
the continent of Europe. And they were in a charming state
of eager curiosity as to what in the world could induce him to
behave so strangely.
What a delightful thing female curiosity is ! Ever since Eve
found it impossible to deny herself a taste of a certain appetising
apple it has done its work in the world. If you want a man's wife
to read a letter which you address to him, mark it "private " in
portentous characters. And feminine folk far less interested in
you than your wife are kind enough to scrutinise the envelo es of
your letters and to conjecture their contents. If we shoul ever
get through petticoat overnmenta female bureaucracyI
trust there won't be a ostmistress-General. If there is, by
Jove, I'll write no letters.
It must, I think, he admitted that the Panther and Isola had
better reasons'than many ladies for being in uisitive. Knowing
what they did, each in her own way, of Rap ael's peculiar char-
acteristics, they might very well an pose that his present conduct
had some very singular reasons. go they speculated and won-
dered, and nothing whatever came of it.

" Deuced queer," said Devil Branscombe to his brother, "what can
have become of that boy? N obody's heard of him here. Don't
see why he should play me a trick. I'm tired of waiting for him."
" You must wait a little longer," replied the Wolf, pufng
away in grand style at his negrohead, "if you want to see him
-and I don't think you could nd a pleasanter place to wait in ;
nice lazy place, where mere existence is a luxury."
"You're gettin poetical in your old age, Duke," said his
elder brother. " don't dislike Naples, you know; but I hate
waiting about for other people."
"He didn't ask you to wait," remarked the Wolf.
" But I am waiting, you see. He didn't ask me to come here, but
he led me to ex ect he would be here. I suppose the truth is he
has forgotten al about it, and doesn't imagine we are over here."
" I don't know about that " returned the Wolf, who had a
tolerable notion of the Seraph's peculiarities; "Raphael has a
good memory."
" Well, it's a most infernal nuisance," said Ralph Branscombe.
" I don't particularly care to see him, but after waiting so long
for him it seems absurd to give him up and go away."
"I don't see that," said Marmaduke; "if you're tired of the
place, let's move. We haven't been over to Costellamare or Sor-

ery tidy," he said ; " English evidently. Can't she walk !"
Ay, Mr. Ralph Branscombe, English, evidently. Tlmt ne
stepper in yachting costume, something of the build of M r.
Leighton's " Helen of Troy," is your son Raphael, little as you
guess it.
" I'm very weary of this, Maule," said the young Earl of
Shotteshrooke. "Waiting, under our circumstances, is terrible
work; waitin here amid all the wicked vritchery and indolent
beauty of Nap es is sheer torture to me."
" It is very trying," said Maule. " I can only preach patience.
Hudson and Morll are not so restless."
"It is worse for me than for them. A sister is worse than a
wife. You can divorce an adulterous wife ; you cannot destroy
the ties of blood. My case is worse than theirs, Frank."
They were joined at this moment by the two other men, who
had been at some little distance. It was a weary husine-s,
lounging and loitering through the long summer days, with a
faint, vague hope of vengeance some time in the future. They
were all tired of it in their several ways. The Bayard blood of
the young Earl was chiey fretted. Hudson was a man of
phlegmatic temperament, but even he was restless. Morll,
erhaps, was quietest; he had sacriced the ambition of his life
or revenge, and could afford to wait. As to Frank Maul
though he confessed it to none of the others, he heartily wisheed
he had never taken the command of the expedition. What had
he to do with it that he should waste the whole delicious sum-
mer in this fashion? But he felt bound in honour not only not
to draw back but also to encourage his comrades to the utmost.
"Fine gir , that!" said Hudson abruptly, levelling a large
double-barrelled glass at a bright blue gure in the middle dis-
tance. " Look, Maule."
Frank Maule took the glass and looked through it for some time.
"By Jove," he said, "I've seen that young lady somewhere.
She's remarkably handsome. Do you recognise her, Shottes-
brooke 'l "
He passed the glass to the Earl, who looked through it atten-
tively for a moment, and then shut it up with a crash that
threatened the lenses.
" My God ! it's impossible," he exclaimed under his breath.
" You know her 'l " said Maule interrogatively.
The Earl did not reply for a minute. He was not famous for
presence of mind. At. last he said
" I think 1 do. Will you keep those two fellows quiet if I
follow her? It may be important for our search."
## p. 294 (#304) ############################################
294 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
"I will manage it," said Frank Maule unsus iciously. He
knew Lord Shottesbrooke was incapable of intrigue, and natu-
rally supposed he had recognised some feminine acquaintance of
Raphael's. So he kept Morll and Hudson from followmg the
Earl by the use of some well-contrived excuse.
Shottesbrooke had a very quick eye for form. He was an
artist, and, for an amateur, a good one; and he had been par-
ticularly successful in catching the likeness of a few men and
women, whom he had portrayed in chalks. We all wear masks.
A great portrait ainter must have the power of seeing through
those masks, and painting the true faces which exist below.
When Apollo took to photography he struck the nal blow at
Paganism, by showing is utter incapacity to do anything of the
kind. Well, the power which Vandyck and some other men
have shown in this way, Lord Shottesbrooke to some extent
possessed, and as peo le are always fond of doin what they are
conscious they do wel , he had an especial fancy or studying the
faces of inen and women. Whenever a face seemed to indicate
a notable character, he noted it; and being young, such faces
adhered to his memory. He was wont to try to fathom the
meaning of e es whose colour, of lips whose curve, were to most
men inscruta le; and a face more enigmatic than usual was to
him dearer than to the numismatist an undecipherable coin, than
to the naturalist an unclassified animal. Now he had only once
or twice, and then casually, encountered Raphael Branscombe ;
but the glimpses he had caught of him had shown him that the
Seraph's was a face of meanings many and deep, and he therefore
remembered that face with such accuracy that he could have
sketched it unmistakably on his thumb nail with a pencil.
And it chanced that as he looked through the binocular which
Maule passed to him, the superb azure gure in the middle dis-
tance turned round, probably to look at the pale cone of Vesu-
vius, and the Earl caught a face so easy to recognise, that he
could not repress the exclamation which came to his lips.
He was not, as I have said, a man with much presence of
mind, which quality indeed is usually the result of ex erience.
When everything that possibly can happen to a man as hap-
pened to him, he is not ikely to be frig teued by old events in
fresh forms. On the other hand, when you are young and living
amid strong excitement, your brain works with a rapidity which,
on reection, often appears miraculous. It took Shottesbrooke
scarcely a moment to decide that this dashing lady must be
Raphael Branscombe in disguise, that the right thing for him to
do was to sever himself from his companions, and pursue this
trail alone.
And he had been longing to do this. To the noble young
Earl there seemed something very base in four men following
the track of one. He loathed his com anions. Frank Maule
was the best of them; but he despised rank for undertaking a

nest which in no way concerned him, just to gratify his amateur
electiVe tastes. And he abhorred Morll, with whom it was
impossible to pass any time without discovering that he was
selfish and a snob. And he detested Hudson, in whom the cad
attained development more enormous every day.
He wanted to be alone with his revenge. He had got so far
as to despise himself for even a temporary partnership in the
search for his sister's beta-ayer. And now God had given him
his opportunit . The house of Hastings was to be avenged by
the good sword of its chief. It was thus the young Earl felt,
when he saw the light blue yachting suit in the distanceworn,
he knew, by Raphael Branscombe.
He could only venture to watch that patch of brilliant colour,
following with almost a loiterer's step. Haste would arouse his
comrades, from whom he was as eager to escape as he was to
overtake his quarry ; even if he was wrongwhich he felt to be
impossiblehe would never again rejoin them. He would pur-
sue the quest alone. This resolve burned within him as he
cautiously continued his pursuit.
What had brought the Seraph in his favourite disguise to
Naples'l Well, just to reconnoitre. He had heard from Louis
that there were hawks abroad. Those four gentlemen could not
remain so persistentl at Naples without causing gossip. There-
fore the Seraph, be ore he made his nal arrangements as to
Anne Morll, determined to see for himself whether he was pur-
sued, and who were his pursuers. He had not the least difculty
in satisfying his curiosity. When he recognised Morll, and Hud-
son, and Lord Shottesbrooke, he knew what had happened almost
as well as if he had been reading this story. And when he passed
his father and uncle he broke into a soliloquy of this sort-
"So, they're after me. Two setsfriends and enemies. Sup-
pose I were to reveal myself rst to my allies. Suppose I
were to say to the old Wolf, Look here, my venerable uncle! Here
be four fools after me for running away with a pretty girl. Let us
drown. them in the Bay ofNaples! I can imagine his grinning
pleasantly at meshowing those ne white tusks of his, and
replying, Leave them to me, Ra hael. Now, gentlemen, what do
you s? 'l " continued the Serap apostrophising the grou , whom
e ha left far behind him. "Shall I leave you to imlI Egad,
'twould save me a considerable amount of trouble. But no,
'twould be cowardly. More than that, I should lose a good deal
of fun. Why shouldn't I shoot Hudson and Morll, and give
or young Shottesbrooke a slight esh wound as a lesson to
im, and then horsewhip Maule for his infernal impertiuenee in
interfering in my affairs? Faith, that's what I'll do. I'll get back
to Sorrento at once, and make some arrangement about Morll's '
wife, and then come back here and meet them face to face."
Having thus resolved, he got on board a light skiff that
awaited him, and was soon half way across the bay. The heat of <

the afternoon had raised a slight mist from the divine waters, so
that from the shore he and young Columbus, his sole companion,
were very easil discernible.
But the Ear of Shottesbrooke had been in time to trace the
bright blue gure he ursued to its disappearance at the steps.
Arrived at the head 0 the water stair, he saw the boat with its
lateen sail already half lost amid the mist of the waves. But he
could still follow the solent blue; so he descended the steps,
looking about for boat and boatman.
The former he saw at once. A small boat, t either for sail
or oar, was fastened by a rope to an iron ring. He cast her OH
and stepped the mast, and was soon in full pursuit of his enemy,
heartil rejoicing that he was alone in his ursuit. It soon be-
came 0 vious that Raphael was bound for orrento ; this ascer-
tained, the Earl, whose temperament was calm, allowed his
impetuosity to die away. He could nd his foe in Sorrento.
Meanwhile Raphael Branscombe, whose boat was the eeter,
soon reached his destination. He had a marvellous power of
fascination, the Seraph. He had made young Columbus his
most absolute slave. That ingenuous young Genoese kept com-
glete secrecy as to his employer's frequent changes of apparel.
y the time the boat had reached Sorrento, Raphael had resumed
his customary costume.
But he needed a little time to decide how to deal with Anne
Pageand he had not the slightest idea that he was followedand
so he lit a cigar and strolled among the orange oves, dela ing
his visit to the Hotel Rispoli. He always dined ate, so his ap-
less, loving little com anion would not yet expect him. He
wanted to pull himse f together. He had to determine where
to send Anne, under Louis's charge, out of the way of mischief
before walking into the hornet's nest at Naples and saying
"Gentlemen, you are looking for some one apparently. Is it
Raphael Branscombe you want? "
So he loitered and lingered in the fragrant alleys of golden
fruitage, smoking cigars even more fragrant than the ap les of
Atalanta, and thinking nothingor very littleof the oolish
child anxiously awaiting him at Rispoli's, and utterly unaware of
the stern young English earl so close upon his track.

no doubt, but he was thoroughly treacherous. Solomon was the
Gladstone of those days. You can see the ne, heroic aspect of
the rst monarch Saul, even through the unfair history of the
times produced by the clerical party who supported the usurper.
Priests invariably falsify history.
If one could obtain suicient knowledge of the ways of the
men in Jerusalem a thousand years before Christ, what a nun--
vellous historical romance could be written of the time when
Solomon and Absalom were young men about town !
But I must return to Sorrento and the current century.
Raphael Branscombe was not destined to carry out his designs
precisely as he formed them. He had taken two or three turns,
and just reached the end of his cigar, when the young Earl of
Shottesbrooke confronted him, sudden and stern. A mere boy,
the Earl, but a ne, gallant English boy ; of the middle height,
yet taller than Raphael ; with light Saxon complexion, and
glistening hair, and soft vernal moustache. At the rst glance
you would probably incline to pity him for being forced on such
stern, sad businessto deem him too young for rough contact
with a man devoid of fear and of conscience ; but a second exa-
mination would show that the purity and valour which shone
in that fair ouug face made him no childish enemv. Blood of
Hastings had never ran in craven veins yet. The high-hearted
young noble would have mounted a breach or led a charge of
cavalry as gaily as he defended his wicket at Eton. At this mo-
ment the vile shamethe double shamewhich had fallen upon
him would have caused him to to et all fear, if fear had been in
his blood. He stood right in Raphae Branscombe's way. He said
" Mr. Branscombe, I have an account to settle with you."
Raphael had not expected this. But his steel nerves Were un-
ahaken. He threw away the end of his cigar and took another
from his case, and said" Well, in lord l"
The Earl was too stern to be irritated by any minor insolenee
of manner. He said haughtily
"You need not give me the pain to attempt an unnecessary
explanation. You cannot stoop so low as to pretend ignorance
of the cause of quarrel. You are not a coward, I think."
" Why, no," said Raphael with a light laugh, which would
have irritated a man less under the sway of an avenging resolve
## p. 298 (#308) ############################################
:98 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
The Seraph thought at that moment of Sir Arthur Willesden, to
whom he had addressed words so similar. " I believe not, my
lord. But, really, I have no friend here in Sorrento."
" You have friends in Naples," said the. Earl. " So have I."
"Ah! You are in a hurry, I see. To-morrow morning, of
course; the sooner such an affair is over the better. Who is
your friend? " .
Lord Shottesbrooke hesitated for a moment, and then said,
" Mr. Maule."
" Very well. If he will be at the Cae d'Europa at midnight
I will send some one to meet him. Good evening, my lord."
Raphael turned away and lighted his cigar. The Earl went
slmvly and sadly to the coast. le would have an unfavourable
wind for his return, and it was already getting towards sunset ;
but he thought little of the twelve miles of sea which lay between
him and Naples. He thought only of the morrow and of stand-
ing in deadly duel with his sister's betrayer.
As to the Seraph, he was greatly annoyed. His lans were
upset. He must despatch Louis to Naples at once, an was con-
sequently compelled to defer his arrangements for Mrs. Morll.
Well, he should have another quiet night at any rate. So he
entered the garden of the Hotel Rispoli. And, as he passed along
a pleasant lawn overshadowed by orange trees, Stephen's lost
love, still beautiful through her guilt. came ying into his arms.
Clothed in maiden-white, with her long brown hair in girlish
fashion, with no touch of trouble in her lovely eyes, no casual
spectator could have guessed her what she was. She looked a
most innocent and loving young bride. Such, in truth, she
would have been had she seen Raphael Branscombe before Hum-
phrey Morll. She came with a coo of love to Raphael's breast,
as if it were her home. Poor little fool l \Vhat if she could have
known the thoughts and plans of that inscrutable schemer'l
" Go and dress for dinner, child," said Raphael, after petting
her as if she had been a favourite dog. " I am awfully hungry.
Send Louis to me."
He wrote a brief note and gave it to that excellent valet, direct-
ing him to nd old Marmaduke Branscombe and give it him as
quietly as possible.
" It is rather late to cross twice, Louis," said the Seraph ; " but
you need not hurry back. Perhaps he will return with you. If
so, and I am gone to bed, don't let him disturb rue."
Louis promised obedience, and started at once. What did the
Seraph do? He dressed for dinner ; and then descended to that
meal, which Rispoli had tastefully prepared for him in a pleasant
room overlooking a precipitous cliff, with a superb view of the
sapphire ba . aaily they dined together, for Anne was always
gay where aphael was, and eventful living brought him gaiety.
t was a delicious evening and a delicious dinner; and when it
was over, and Raphael, with the green wine-ask at his elbow,

abundant brown tresses, a stranger would have said it was a de~

Young Lord Shottesbrooke, with all his athletic training, was
thoroughly tagged when he reached Naples. In his excite-ment
he had neither eaten nor drank, and his return voyage had been
a long one. He went at once to his room, and sent his valet for
a bottle of champagne, which he drank at a draught. His three
companions had dined without him, and were wondering what
had become of him.
Maule was particularly puzzled. He understood, somewhat
better than either of the others, the Earl's nobility and rene-
ment of character, and felt assured that his sudden chase of a
bright blue yachting costume had some grave meaning. Either
Hudson or Morll might have been tempted into an intrigue, but
not Shottesbrooke. But the mystery was soon explained to him.
The Earl's servant brought him a encilled note, which he con-
trived to give him when neither udson nor Morll looked that
way. So Manle adroitly persuaded those two gentlemen to sit
down to e'carte', and joined the Earl.
" I have seen him, Maule," he said, when the door was closed.
" Ishall punish him, thank God. Don't say a word to those men."
Maule expressed the extreme surprise which he felt.
" Yes, hes at Sorrento. I've crossed twice, and am regularly
tagged. I must go to bed, to be ready for to-morrow. You'll be
secret, won't you 1 " he said im loringly.
" On my honour I will. ut what arrangement have you
made 'I "
" You must be my second. Go to the eaf at midnight, and a
man from him will meet you. I don't know who. Fix the time
as early as you can, and let me sleep till the last moment. If I
can slee , that is."
" I wi l do all you wish," said Maule. And therewith he left
the Earl of Shottesbrooke to get such rest as he might on the eve
of avenging the honour of his family.
Meanwhile Louis, faithful and indefatigable, had found Mer-
maduke Branscombe, and handed him this letter:
" Horn. Rmrou, Sonnexm.
" MY DEAR UsersI have got to ght a duel to-rnorrow with

The old Wolf read this characteristic note with eyes wide open,
and then silently handed it to his brother.
" The young scoundrel !" exclaimed Ralph. " He's been close
by all this time. What the deuce can he have to ght about?
Shottesbrooke's quite a boy, I thinktoo young to be married."
" Perhaps he's got sisters," said Marmaduke.
"Well, it doesn't much matter. You'll act for him, of course,
and I'll go across and see the fun from a distance. Raphael has
been out once or twice before now."
The two old gentlemen dismissed Louis to refresh himself, and
walked towards their Palazzo from the hotel at which, after con-
siderable search, the valet had found them.
" We mustn't tell the girls," said Marmaduke.
"I don't think either of them would care a stiver," replied
Devil Branscombe. " Claudia's no coward, I know, and I don't
suppose Isola is, being a. daughter of yours. However, it doesn't
matter - we'll sup, and then go to the Ca'.' How shall you
know this Mr. Maule'f"
" Easily nd him. There aren't many English here just now."
Maule had been unable, with all his tact, to separate himself
from his companions. To his annoyance they would go down to
the Cattle with him. Here, however, he was in luck. They
found a couple of other men laying e'cart, and as they had been
thus Occupied themselves al the evening, what more natural
than that they should be dis osed to bet? Thus Maule was
enabled to stroll in search of hael's friend. He was almost
immediately accosted by the Wolil
" Let us walk outside and settle this matter," said Maule.
" My principal has friends here whom he does not wish to know
what he intends." They acted accordingly.
" I know nothing of the quarrel, Mr. Maule," said Marmaduke.
" I cannot guess therefore whether it can be ended peacefully."
"Impossible, sir. We are the challenging party. No apology
can be accepted."
" None is offered," said the old gentleman grimly. "A lady

mine will both want sleep, and it is impossible to calculate to

mistake to get up very early if you are going to tight. Perhaps
We had better have a margin 11 to ten."

if I were you. There's ample space at Sorrento to do the business
easily without interruption."
Maule and Marmaduke Branscombe parted to take such mea-
sures as were neccssary. Maule determined that the young Earl
should assuredly have the rest which the fatigue and excitement
of the day had made absolutely requisite. So he snatched an
hour or two of slee himself, and be induced Lord Shottesbrooke,
not without diflicu ty, to make a sensible breakfast in the morning
before they crossed. How cruel a deed of destiny it seems, that
a man whose position in the world is full of promise, and who
possesses all the moral and intellectual ualications necessary
for the fullment of that romise, shouldlm forced by no fault of
his own to sacrice everyt ing ! (Edi us dashed from the height
of a well-won prosperity to adversity a most intolerable, is no cari-
cature of what may happen to men. A few weeks ago, Edward, Earl
ofShottesbrooke,was a man whom the multitude might envy. He
was young, handsome, gallant, honourable ; moderately rich for
an Earl, moderately intellectual for an Earl, and endowed with a
modest ambition to pursue that career of politics in which a young
Earl,ifhe cannot succeed,must be an ass. Edward,Earl of Shottes-
brooke, was a happy man, and had excellent reasons for being
happy. Now, he was the most miserable of mena man whose
misery was complicated witha erce indignant sense of wrong. For
what had he done 'l Nothinc. Whyhad the pitiless povvers smitten
him with shame which noqblood could wash away? Even if he
killed Raphael Branscombe, he could never again more with erect
form and unwrinkled forehead among the gentlemen of England,
his peers. Why? Because a girl of his blood had for the rst time
for the many centuries during which the history of the house of
Hastings belonged to the history of England disgraced that house.
\Vorse. Because the woman who had given him birth had connived
at that disgracehad not said to her sinning daughter, "Kill
yourselfyou have no right to live." But what the Earl hoped
against hope was that Raphael Branscombe might kill him. He
could not, that was the worst of it. Branscombe, as a gentleman
and a man of honour, could not shoot at the man whose sister's
fame he had stained. Lord Shottesbrooke knew perfectly that
this was a rule which his antagonist would not dream of breaking
through. If it could have been! If he might have fallen by
Branscombe's unerring bullet, ending for ever the long line of
the Shottesbrooke Earls ! No, there was no hope of it.
Shottesbrooke was a Christiannot, of course, so thorough a
Christian as to forget that he was an Englishman and an Earl.
But his Christianity was sufcient to make him shrink from
suicide. Had he been a Roman he would not for a moment have
blenched from " what Cato did and Addison approved." It would

have appeared to him the shortest sternest way of dealing with
an unjust fate. He fought for a lonv time against the idea. But
at last it was too strong for such fait as he possessed. He began
to believe that his case was baselessthat the Ruler of the world
was not good but evilthat fate was unjust to himthat he had
a right to take his life into his own hands. He would do that
thing. He would kill Raphael Branscombe if he could ; at any
rate, however that might be, he most assuredly would kill himself.
It was with this inexible resolve, formed while in the hazy morn-
ing he crossed Italy's most beautiful bay, that he landed on the
shore of Sorrento. He had not exchanged a word with Maule the
whole way. Nor was poor Frank disposed tobe loquacious; now
that the supreme moment approached, he wished himself well
out of it. The morning was ripening into broad day when they
landed. The old Wolf and Raphael's valet had arrived before
them, but had not gone on to Ris oli's.
" Don't disturb him' till the ot er fellow comes," said Marma-
duke. " Sleep steadies the hand."
So he was sitting on a great block of stone and smoking the
negrohead, while Ralph Branscombe walked up and down not
far off, when the Earl and his second landed. The Wolf greeted
Maule with the ceremonious courtesy of a gentleman of good
blood accustomed to the duello.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
VENDETTA.
A CHAMBER in the Hotel Rispoli, with a wide window
overlooking a sea of verdure, which, dotted with golden
fruitage, stretched far below to the white verge of the sapphire
sea itself. Two heads upon one white pillow, calm and beautiful
heads, such as seemed rather to belong to antique Greece than to
any modern region or race. The woman, scarce a woman yet,
with amplitude of glossy brown hair, with azure veined eyelids
eacefully closed over eyes which any prying Iachimo would
linow to be divine ; with a mouth so small and ripe that Iachimo
aforesaid could hardly refrain from kissing. Calmly she slept,
her unseen bosom lightly moving the light draperies. The other
head more beautiful than hersand more calm. A head that
Iachimo, if previously ignorant on the topic, might well sup-
pose a woman's also; but mingled with its unrivalled grace and
eauty, there was a strength, there was a stcrnness, which no
womanno, nor Artemis, nor even inviolate Athenaever pos-
sessed. An epicene countenance, an e icene character, that of
Raphael Branscombe. And'how calm e lies, with no dream of
the imminent duel causing his ngers to clench or his lips t0
twitch I Will he ever wake again?
## p. 303 (#313) ############################################
VENDETTA. 303
The s ongy air is absorbing the broad light of day. There
comes a ow knock at the chamber door. Neither sleeper moves.
It grows loud and impatient. Then, after a while, Anne Mortill
stirs in her sleep, and the white lids rise from the delicious brown
eyes, and she looks around, wondering. She looks upon Raphael
-who does not more. Strange that he should sleep so tranquilly
with such work to do.
Suddenly something strikes her eye, and she starts back ap-
palled. She springs from the bed in a'right. She tears at her
night-dress as if to tear it from her person. She shrieks with a
shriek so full of terror that no human car could mistake its
meaning.
Louis had been the rst to knock at the door of his master's
chamber. - The delay had brought up rst Marmaduke and then
his elder brother. The shriek, that most a'righting utterance of
woman's utmost distress, had brought others also.
" What is the matter?" said Marmaduke, trying to open the
bedroom door.
It was locked.
" This won't do," exclaimed Devil Branscombe.
And with one lurch of his strong shoulders he burst itfrom its
fastenings.
Right opposite him stoodwhat once was sweet Anne Page.
A woman no longer, for the soul had left her strange wild eyes,
which were ghastly with sudden madness. Her snowy night-
dress was stained with blood. blood still wet, still warm. She
was striving to tear it away with her weak white hands, hideously
reddened as she strove. She took no notice of the men who -
entered the room; with that one shriek her mind had gone for
ever. and she uttered troubled moans that made those who heard
her weep.
But Ra] h and Marmaduke Branscombe strode rapidly forward
to the be . There lay Raphael, unmoved by all this claniour.
No wonder. Right through his breast was driven a long keen
dagger with ivory hilt, and upon the silver plate of the hilt was
cut roughly but legibly
VEXDETTAZ ANGELO MONTALTI.
And no one there knew what this ominous inscription meant.
It was an enigma to all. There was nothing certain save that
Raphael Branscombe was dead, stone dead; that Anne Mortill
was mad; that another band had taken the revenge for which
the young Earl of Shottesbrooke had so ercely thirsted.
It was a terrible blow to Ralph Branscombe. There is often
a vast depth of family aifection in the hearts of men who are as
hard as iron upon most matters. Devil Branscombe cared for
few things and few people; but he loved his son with a erce
tigerish admiring love, as his natural successor; and as a man
of his own mould, more resolute and daring than even himself.
## p. 304 (#314) ############################################
304 SWEET ANNE PAGE.
I an pose if the Arch Fiend had fruit of his loins he would love
it. lph Branscombe muttered a deep and earnest oath of ven-
geance, gave one last look at his son, and then with the dagger
in his hand, which he had taken from Ra hael's breast, strode
silently downstairs, Marmaduke silently fol owing him.
It was a strange sight to see those two old men on the ste s of
the Hbtel Rispoli, both unconscious of the divine sweep of and
and sea over which they seemed to game, both hungry to clutch
the throat of the man who had slain the hope of their house.
Lord Shottesbrooke was stunned by the uuforeseen event.
What could he do now? He was defrauded of even his revenge.
This man, it seemed, should have had many lives, and died as
many deaths as he had committed crimes. The Earl had now to
deal with himself only. Every one else at Sorrento was excited
by the mystery of Raphael's murder; but Lord Shottesbrooke
went away from them all, and strode u and down the shore of
the tranquil sea, as Homer's hero had one centuries before, and
could come to no xed resolve as to what it was meet for him to
do. The pure shield of the Shottesbrooke Earls was deled by
the most cruel of stains. Men might not know ityet there are
no such things as secrets in the world, no hidden things which
time does not reveal. Even if unrevealed to others, he should
know it. What should he do? What should he do?
He longed to kill himself. It was no cowardice that deterred
himit was that sense of duty which is the special characteristic
of the English gentleman. He could not feel certain that he had
a right to kill himself. It was so easy a solution of the terrible
difculty. Yet there came for ever into his mind the passionate
questioning of the hero of the world's most ancient tragedy
" Wherefore is light given unto him that is in misery, and life
unto the bitter in soul 1"
Meanwhile, Stephen Langton in Corsica was op ressed by a
strange presentimenta presentiment which caused Fiordilisa's
girlish gaiet to give him intense pain. She had no apprehen-
sions ; but the Seraph's disappearance, and Palliser's report from
Naples, and Montalti's departure, made Stephen anticipate a tra-
gedy. His old visionary faculty returned to him. As, in cigar-
esque indolence, he loitered along Isola Rossa's enchanted coast,
there was ever before him a. dream of Raphael drenched in blood,
of sweet Anne Page weeping by his corpse. So strong became
his conviction that there was some dread event about to occur
that he at last persuaded Palliser to take another run across to
Naples, and himself accompanied him. But he told Fiordilisa
that they were only going7 to cruise round Cape Corso.
The beautiful Seagull had a fair wind all the way to Naples.
She ran into the bay on the morning xed for the duel. Langton
and Palliser found Hudson and )Iorll per lexed by the abssnce
of their companions, which had been quiet y arranged by Frank
Mauls. But ill news travels fast : rumour of some terrible

event at Sorrcnto soon reached the city; and it was not much
after noon when Stephen leaped ashore from the Seagull'l boat,
and found himself in the presence of Ralph and Marmaduke
Branscombe.
Angelo Montalti's dagger told him the whole story.
And now he reproached himself for having left Fiordilisa. By
this time, without doubt, the old Corsican had returned to Isola
Roses, and proclaimed to all men his vendetta accomplished.
They are very stern, those Corsicans. A young herdsman, who
took a bribe to betray two French deserters. was tried and shot
by his kinsmen for the breach of hospitality, his aged father
commanding him to die bravely. And Stephen doubted not that
Angelo would narrate to the Lily of Isola Rossa where he had
found Raphael, and what revenge he had taken. Could she endure
this'l Had she, like many of her romantic race, the spirit which
gave strength to Antigone, to Iphi genial
Stephen Langton ascended to the chamber of murder. There
lay the mortal tenement of the wildest spirit he had ever known.
One thrust of steel, and Raphaelwith all his bizarre fancies,
his deeds done because they were daring, his capricious quarrels
and capricious 10\'os-was a nonentity, so far as men were con-
cerned. He had solved the great problem. It is hard to describe
what a blank was left in Stephen's life-drama by the vanishing
of its chief dram/dis persona. Stephen was essentially a poet;
Raphael essentially an actor. The ditierence between them was
the di'erence between Richardson and Lovelace.
And now Stephen wanted to know what had become of the
vivid force which passed from the chill remains of Raphael.
Force cannot perish.
" Oh," exclaims Biichner the Teuton, " force is matter, matter
is force."
Is ill Are they? I wish some of us knew. Is God conscious
or unconscious, Biichner with bathos of brain'l That is the
crucial question.
Where was Raphael? Visionary Stephen Langton could not
rest in his ignorance. From the day when he, a boy-victim, had
been driven b his grandfather, the tanner, to see the Brans-
combes at brea 'fast, he had been possessed by members of that
strange family. Ay, before that time. Sweet Anne Page was
his love in the days long ast when he learned dissyllabic spell-
ing at a mixed school of gays and girls, and did not much fear
the schoolmistress's rod because Aunt Harriet's heavier hand had
given him stoicism. Then Claudia had almost conquered him ;
then the old Wolf had sprung suddenly into the arena of his life;
then the Seraph had been his guide, philosopher, friend, hero,
terror, demon. Ay de mi! Sweet Anne Page was a maniacand
the Panther had passed out of his lifeand the Seraph wasdead.
Dead ! I wonder men grieve when those die whom they love.
They should rather feel a erce indignation. What, on any of

the multiplex theories which are presented for our belief, have
we done at We should be brought into this world (we know not
whenceavithout being consulted as to time or lace, or the posi-
tion to occupied, or the people to be our re ationsand sub
jected to all manner of circumstances, still without choiceand
then be hurried out of the world, without any courtesy or pre-
vious consultation or intimation, nobody knowing whither? I
say it is at tyranny. Orthodoxy (the orthodoxy of a minority)
tells us of eternal happiness and eternal punishment. Others
prate, or have prated, of elysian elds, of metempsychosis, of
absorption, of annihilation. What said Achilleus to Odysseus?
" ' Scot! not at death,' he answered, 'noble chief !
Rather would I in the sun's warmth divine
Serve a poor churl who drags his days in grief,
Than the whole lordship of the dead were mine.' "
If the yarn which Odysseus s un to Alcinous had any truth in
it, most of us will agree with t e Greek hero. A shadow among
shadows would nd it slow.
Metempsychosis would be amusing if it were not dissociated
from consciousness and memory. That is a fatal blot in the
arrangement. After being a great man for one life, it would be
rather nice to be a small man's dog. When they were ghting
before Troy, Homer was a camel in Bactria. With human con-
sciousness, a man mi ht be very happy (for a time) as a falcon,
a carrier pigeon, a erby crack, a greyhound, even a lobster.
There would be less satisfaction in being Lesbia's sparrow or
Lady Vivian Ashleigh's favourite riding-horse.
As to absorptionthe disappearance of the individual in the
innite spiritit is satisfactory enough. One's spirit will still
be doing its work in the world. Probably this is the most philo-
sophic of all the theoriesannihilation is demonstrably impos-
sibleand therefore may he the right thing after all.
So far as I can remember, some of these notions passed rapidly
through the brain of Stephen Langton, as he stood. b the dead
body of his friend. So absorbed was he in his thoug ts that he
did not notice, lying across the foot of the bed, a white heap
once sweet Anne Page.
Suddenly, as he leaned over Raphael's pillow, she sprang from
the crushed colla sed position into which she had fallen, and
glared at him wit eyes full of lustre, yet void of meaningand
he saw that she was mad. No one had ventured to remove her.
The two old men had not thought of her. The people of the
hotel kept away from the room of death.
It immediately occurred to Stephen that Claudia should be
here. She was needed both for her father and her cousin. He
turned slowly away from the blood-stained bedfrom Raphael's
corpse, and from the wreck of the girl whom he had lovell~and
upon the threshold uiet Claudia and isola, whom Louis hadfetched
from Naples, Maule suggesting.

"Thank God, you are come i" he exclaimed earnestly.
It was indeed fortunate; women are not tenderer than men,
not perhaps so tender ; but they have a capacity for understand-
ing illness of any sort which men never possess. \Vomen have
less individuality than men; are more uent; can more easily
adapt themselves to an atmosphere of imperfect health. Perhaps
neither the Panther nor her cousin was the most suitable and
desirable creature for the business in hand, but either of them
was innitely referable to any male human being, unless pro-
fessionally medical.
Man matters had Stephen Langton to discuss with himself.
He ha come into the midst of this tragedy, a Deus ea: machina.
What should he do in reference to Devil Branscombe? The
dead man's father ought, perhaps, to be told why his son had
met his death by an avenger's stiletto. Then there was the old
Wolf to be considered. If he knew where Raphael's assassin
might be found, he would, Stephen felt assured, follow him to
the death without sample. The Wolf was not a man for honour-
'able deeds. Given Angelo Montalti's whereabouts, the Wolf's
myrmidons would be set upon him at once. Questionless, when
inquiry came to be made, the Branscomhes would nd some wav
of tracing Montalti ; but what was Stephen's duty in this case?
Again, what could he say to the ladies of the family? The
Panther would be satised with no evasions. Even were he given 5
to lying, he could not lie, with her black lustrous eyes xed upon
his. But Stephen loved the truth and fresh owers and spring
water almost as well as Mr. Charles Reade. She would easily
perceive that he possessed the clue to this terrible affair. How
could he conceal itl .
Again, there was Isola. A thrill had passed through Stephen
Langton as he looked upon Isola Branscombe. Somehow or
other, from the rst day that he had met the old Wolf's daughter
-creature of fantasy and capriceshe had exercised over him a
fascination inexplicable. And his somewhat superstitious tem-
perament induced him to believe that he was destined to link his
destiny with the destiny of the strange girl, whose stranger
father he had most strangely encountered at the corner of Maiden-
head Thicket. Was she indeed his destiny '1 Had he suddenly
left England to escape the inuence of the Branscombes, only to

Certes, Isola had a charm about her which he had noted in no
other woman. She was thoroughly original. She was attractive

Thackeray" Militam' mm n'na glorr'd." But he was as arated
utterly from Claudia now. The two had done their est to
become one, and had completely failed. They had always made
their endeavours in the wrong way, or at the wrong moment.
But Isola! It is so delicious to think thata Woman loves you.
He fancied this of Isola. He fancied that he could love her. He
longed to loveor to fancy he lovedsomebody. So he deter-
mined to test himself and Isola, by making her his condant in
this present affairnot without a sincere conviction that it would
be extremely difcult to get a condante so trustworthy, or an
adviser so sagaoious.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
ISOLA AND STEPHEN.
LAUDIA was doing her utmost for the poor little girl who
had been her rival and her victim. Little time to think
had the Panther, but remorse and grief lled every interstice of
thought. This childthis beautiful soulless creature for whom
she had now to make provisionhad fallen a sacrice to herself
and Raphael. That insatiable Branscombe spirit ! If she had
only left Anne Page alone to be the happy wife of Stephen
Langton, how much better would it have been. Now, Anne was
a maniac; now, Raphael Branscombe, the hope of his wild old
house, the noblest and most daring gentleman that eVer ruined
women and killed men, was lying murdered in his bed. As
Claudia thought of these things, looking on her slain brother's
placid face, beautiful in death, she might have reminded a by-
stander of Luttrel's ne verseI quote it from memory
" Methinks the furies with their snakes,
Or Venus with her zone might gird her,
Of end and goddess she partakes,
And looks at once both love and murder 1"
The conviction came upon her that this indeed was the end
of her career ; that, her brother dead, and her hapless little rival
maddened by her fate, it would be henceforth her doom to live
apart from all that made life joyous.
Through Louis, Stephen Langton contrived to get a message
conveyed to Isola. She left her cousin and joined him in one of
the rooms of the pleasant pavilion on the verge of the precipice.
Her weird eyes were full of tears for Raphael.
St hen. 'lhis is a terrible business, Isola. I want your help.

Stephen. Morll, who knew that little Anne had money,

Isola. I see. Go on.
Stephen. Raphael returned to Corsica, leaving Anne Morll
here. He found his wife more lovable than when he went
away. So he determined to desert Anne Morll, and Sullth
quietly in Corsica.
Isola. Too late !
Stephen. Too late, indeed. The Corsicans have a erce sense of
honour and a ercer thirst for revenge. Raphael's wife's father s

to meet his ather, I think we might prevent more bloodshed.

- Stephen Corsicans are very brave. I verily believe that Fior-
dilisa will bear the news like some stern Grecian girl.
Isola. My education was rather neglected, Mr. Langton, so I
know nothing about stern Grecian girls. But I suppose from
your stilted style of talk that my poor Raphael's widow is not a
nervous little fool like Anne Page, but a girl of steel like me and
the Panther. You say her grandfather has robably told her all
about it before this. Well, let me go over t erecome with me
if you likeand let us explain to her the state of affairs, and do
the best we can for her and her child. Poor old Raphael! Poor
dear old boy ! He saved me from a horrible life, and the least I
can do is to stick to his wife and child. And I will.
Stephen You are a dear little girl, Isola, and I think you have
made awise proposal. But there are lots of difculties. How
are we to keep your father and uncle quiet meanwhile? And
sup so our ittle Fiordilisa's child is just born'l
solo. must talk to Claudia. My father is a dutiful old
gentleman, and will do exactly what I tell him, and I expect the
Panther can manage my uncle Ralph. I'll go and speak to her
at once, and then come back and tell you.
Away sped Isola from the pavilion on her errand of peace.
As she crossed the pleasant garden, Stephen said to himself-
"By Jove, that girl's a trump !"
Not a poetic way of expressing the admiration which he felt
for her courage and promptitude and loyalty, but an emphatic one.
Meanwhile Isola went to Claudia, and told her what she had
learnt from Stephen, but Claudia was not so ready to support
pacic measures as her cousin expected. She thouvht but little
of Raphael's wife and child in comparison with Ra hael himself.
She was not disposed to forgive his murdererthe ess so because
Raphael had evidently intended to return to F iordilisa. If he had
fallen in fair ght with Hudson or Morll, his sister would have
uncomplainingl accepted the disaster; but to be stabbed in his
bed by a man w om he had not wronged was too terrible a fate.
But Isola's earnest pleading induced Claudia to give way a
little. She would not at present set her father on the track of
the assassin. When the old man awoke from his momentary
stupor, he would be athirst for revenge, and if he set the French
olice at work, Angelo Montalti would soon be hunted to the
eath. She would do her best to quiet him, while Isola crossed
to Corsica and judr'ed for herself.
Next there was the old Wolfwith him his daughter had little
difculty. Furious he was certainly when he heard her story, but
he agreed with herthatitwouldbe well to seek Raphael'swife before
resorting to decisive measures, and he also promised to curb his
brother's iinpetuosit . So Palliser's yacht was again in requisition.
They who read t we best modern poetry will well remember

Tarchon she left behind her death and grief and madnesswhile
for aught her voyagers knew there might be death and madness
mingled also with the grief that they must encounter upon Isola
Rossa's coral-stained sea-marge. But between two griefs there
shone an immortal joy. ' Between the sanguine stain of Sorrento

REGOROVIUS, most poetic of travellers, describes the ex.
treme melancholy of Corsican song. "I had hardly," ho
says, "fallen asleep in my little locanda, when l was wakened by
the sound of a guitar and singing in many arts. They layed
and sang for perhaps an hour in the still nig it before my rouse.

long with which they serenaded a young girl was a dirge, and
the very uremia sounded as monrni'ul as a roccro."
They are a strange people, these Corsicans. They see more of
the Death Angel than most races of men. He moves among them
a visible presence. He writes an autogra h of blood upon their
island cli's ; and familiar as they are wit death in its most ter-
rible and sudden forms, it is no wonder that the rocero is their
favourite form of poetry.
The death of a Corsican is followed by a loud lamentthe
gridofrom his relations around his bed. Then the body is laid
on a table, the tola, against the walla man being dressed in
antique litrurian fashion, a maiden in white, an old woman in
black, a married woman in parti-colonred vesture. Thev watch
beside the toln all night, lamenting, burning a re. In the early
morning comes the scirrataa vast crowd of lamenters. The
women plunge into a wild pantomime of griefa dance of death,
whose only pauses come from extreme weariness. A young vou-
ratrice leads the funeral song, which is almost always the pro-
duction of the moment. Its form is invariable, term rima, with
trochaic rhythm, so that improvisation is not diicult, and when
the prima toreratn'ce pauses, the whole wild chorus of Women
burst in with
" Ahi, ahi, ahi l "
in long drawn ululation. The vocen' which have grown into a
literature are full of power and pathos; and the sole fault which
I nd with Mr. Russell Martineau, translator of the Corsica of
GregoroviusI is thatnot being a poethe has ventured on
quasi-poetic versions of those voceri.
The Seagull ran into the harbour of Isola Rossa early in the
morning.
The song of the voceratn'ci was audible from the Casa Montalti.
Neither Langton nor Palliser knew the meaning of the mournful
dirge which swept across the waters. Isola had gone below at
Ajaccio, where her companions had business ashore, and so was
asleep on their arrival.
Stephen landed alone, and made his way to the Casa Montalti.
He entered its chief room, hot and stiing after the fresh breeze
on the schooner's deck. The toIa was there ; on the tola, dressed
almost in white, but with a few black atches here and there,
lay the corpse of Fiordilisa Branscombe, eautiful in death. The
women of the acirrata were whirling in a wild dance as he came
forward. Suddenly,'with miraculous simultnneity, the fell as
if crushed into a. sitting posture; their heads buried between
their knees. their arms above their heads. One only, younger
than Fiordilisa, and almost as lovely, burst into the room:
" ' Where? ' he cries to the bloody isle

' Where shall I meet my mother's smile I

" ' Who of my father's strength will teth
Surely he was a hero stern.'
Vainly, alas ! those lips beseech
" Vainly ever the boy must yearn.
Dead in his bed the father lies.
Dead his mother ye now discern.
" Baby boy, with thy father's eyes,
Woe ! for revenge thou ne'er shalt see.
Never shalt wield the steel that ies
" Straight to the heart that orphaned thee !
Baby boy, with thy father's eyes !
Chief of thy mother's blood was he.
"Ahi! ahil ahi ! "
Thus went on the interminable 'uocero, of which I have s'triven
to give a brief example in English. Stephen listened sadly till
the im assioned young voceratrice, wearied by her wild song, sank
sudden y down among her chorus. He had not much to learn.
Angelo Montalti had come back to Isola Rossa proclaiming him-
self the avenger of blood. But his dread deed had not reached
the ears of Fiordilisa. She was dying when he returneddying
from weakness~having given birth to a son. She did not see
her ndfather, heard nothing of his story, passed calmly into
anot er World within a day or two of her husband. All that
she had strength to say had reference to her boy.
" Name him Raphael."
Well had the vocerat'rice told of this young new-comet's havinu
his father's eyes. To Ste hen it seemed that the Seraph's weir
glance had issued from t ose baby orbs. And the women told
him that the child must have been born almost at the very mo-
ment that, according to Angelo's narrative, Raphael was slain.
Stephen was a dreamer, you know, and had a predisposition to
believe in metempsychosis. Had Raphael alread commenced a
second career in the person of his newborn son? he idea caused
him to shudder. There was something uncanny about Raphael ;
but Raphael reappearing as a baby would be dreadful. He did
not half like the look of this young Branscombe. Where was
Angelo? He had gone to the macchia, after telling the people of
Isola Rossa what he had done. Of course, knowing human nature
only in its special form of Corsican nature, he assumed that
Rn hael's relations would immediately vow vendetta against him
an hunt him down mercilessly. Consequently he tied at once
into the wild forests about Mount Patro, pre ared to live by the
fusile if needful. So there were Raphael an Fiordilisa dead and
Angelo in his old days gone to the mountains, and none to inherit
the Montalti property save this little creature, who, in Stephen's
eyes, seemed preternaturally sagaciousa miniature edition of
the Seraph. Vell, what was he, Stephen Langton, to do 'I He

must act, evidently, as Raphael's representative. He must see
what arrangement could be made for the young heir of the Brans-
combes of Branscombe. This Was an important matter. To him
would come a great estate in England ; he must not be left to a
mere Corsican education.
Well, he would talk to Isola about it. Again, he must en-
deavour to bring old Angelo Montalti home again. The old man
doubtless would despise a race so mild that their young chief
might be slainand no vendetta. And, on the other hand, if
Devil Branscombe or the Wolf could, in their present temper,
get hold of the venerable Corsican, there would be a pretty swift
end of him. Still, Stephen thought it best to bring him home
again, and resolved to send in search of him as early as possible.
Soundly had Isola slept in the small but daintin appointed
cabin of Palliser's yacht. When she awoke it wanted scarce an
hour of noon. When she emerged from the snowy drapery of
her narrow couch she felt a strange, inexplicable sense of happi-
ness. For the moment, so sound had been her dreamless sleep,
she forgot where she was. What had happened? Why was she
so happy? Why was she in so quaint a chamber? She arose
and looked from a tiny window. Over the calm sunlit sea she
beheld Isola Rossathe little town carved upon the Grecian urn
which Keats had made immortalso still and silent, so un-
ravishcd a bride of quietness, that you might well suppose it a
mere picture, the work of some magical artist. Truly, it looked
all unlike the home of the wild passion that drove Angelo Mon-
talti with murderous oniard across the Tyrrhene Sea, or of the
erce lamenlations and clamorous music which all that morning
had surged around Fiordilisa's corpse. It was a picture of tran-
quillity. Isola threw open the Window and inhaled the soft low
wind, and feasted her eyes upon that strangely silent shore, where
not a human creature seemed to dwell. Ah ! she knew now
where she was. She knew why she was so happy. Never, never,
never could she forget the magical Straits of Bonifazio. The
bouchette coraline gave a delicious little pout as she thought of it.
If Stephen could have seen ! Why, was not that Stephen in the
stern of the Seagull's boat, just putting o' from shore? and here
she was en chemise! She had not thought of dressing yet. She
rushed to the fair water in the great hip-bath, and there resulted
a considerable splashing.
We are not Acteeons, gentle reader, nor do we resemble Musi-
dora's lover in Mr. Thomson's Seasons. So it need only he re-
corded that beautiful little Isola was on deckas fresh as paint
in time to receive Stephen when he came on board. I need
not say that she had made the most charming toilette ossible
in a small schooner yacht. But her bright eyes, and hal -parted
lips, and rose-ushed cheeks were worth more than the most
gogruette falbala in the world. Stephen was a lucky dog beyond

It may well be supposed that Isola's advice to Stephen in the
present posture of atfairs coincided with what Stephen had de-
vised. urely if they were not now, they never would be of one
mind. Search was made for Angelo, in the rst instance. It
did not take long to nd him. At a patriarchal age, the noble
Corsican was not so sure-footed as in his hot youth, when Pas~
quale Paoli was ruler of Corsica; and he had unhappily lost his
way on the outskirts of the Monte Rotondo, and tallen over a
preci ice of the Frate. He was recognised at once by those who
foun the body, for the chief of the Montalti was well known
from Corte to Cape Corso. ~
And so there was another oocero in Isola Rossa. If I were
writing a poem instead of a novel, I would strive to bring before
my readers the wild scene of lamentations when the scirrata came
a second time to the Casa Montalti. But this resent generation
of readers likes not funeral celebrations. Deat s as many as you
lease, and as strange in their formbut do not invite us to the
Funerals. Who can be expected to mourn, when the puppet of
modern romancethe novelist's dollis hurled over a did, or
stabbed in his bed, or otherwise done away with? If you had
created men and women, says the reader, you wouldn't be in such
a hurry to kill them. I think the reader is right. There shall
be no murder or sudden death in my next story. '
Seagull Palliser was despatched in his yacht to Sorrento, to
carry the news to Ralph and Marmaduke Branscombe. It was
an unpleasant errand, but Palliser was a good fellow; besides,
he carried his information in copious epistles from Stephen and
Isola to the two old gentlemen and Claudia. And the result of,
his embassy was, that Ralph and Marmadukebut not Claudia
returned in the Seagull, and saw Ste hen and Isola married by
the same priest who had joined together Raphael and Fiordilisa.
It was not so 'oyous a wedding, but it had some promise of hap-
piness, nevert eless.

IEHE cathedral city of Idlechester is as pleasant eve whit as
when we visited it last, ten years ago. The new ishop is
more respected than his predecessor, if not so popular. A pre-
late with no denite opinions, and a gay young wife, and a
predilection for good dinners, is likely to be more popular than
a bachelor Bishop with very denite opinions, indeed, and a
strong tendency to epigram. But Bishop Winter has done good
work in his diocese, and has led the Church Militant with great
effect in the House of Lords. Pert young peers who think it ne

the habit of selecting nights when the Bishop of Idlechester is
absent. They are as much afraid of him as were the mauvais
mjcrs of Kingsleat Grammar School. " The severe Winter " cuts
as keenly as ever.
Old Langton the tanner has been dead some years. He died
insolvent, so that Stephen derived little prot from the will
which made him his grandfather's sole heir. The present occu-
pant ot' the tanyard is a scientic tanner; precious little oak
ark does he use in the manufacture of leather ; he is one of the
pioneers of that supreme civilisation which produces shams
which surpass the original, and extracts exquisite colours from
gas refuse, and delicious odour's from ordure. The wearers of
boots may have cause to regret this scientic tanning, but let the
lovers of the oak tree rejoice. Still there is "nothing like
leather"-for wearing out. What has become of all the oung
Langtons I know not. Turned commercial travellers, probably.
It was their apparent destiny. Aunt Harriet lives in a cottage
in the suburbs of the city, receiving an annuity from Stephen,
and devoting herself with genial perseverance to the education
of servant girls. She has but one ancilla at a time, but she
seldom keeps her be 0nd a week. The unhappy young woman
can by no chance 0 anything right. Aunt Harriet has no
patience with such hussies.
Dr. Winter was succeeded in the head mastership of Kingsleat
Grammar School by his second master, a very dull man indeed.
Yet the school ourishes as to numbers, though its pupils don't
take honours. That this poor, stout, fussy, incapable Corfe,
whom Dr. Winter continued in his position as second master from
sheer pity, should be permitted to destroy the renown of King-
sleat school, is a sharp thorn in the episco al esh, and it were
vain to waste Greek e igrams on Corfe, w o couldn't construe
themor understand tliem if translated.
Mr. Lonsdale is still the librarian of the famous Kingsleat '
Library. The other day the Duke of Axminster was in Berlin,
and made the acquaintance of a certain Chevalier Bunsen.
The Duke,a thoroughpaced aristocrat, would believe in nothing
till it had received aristocratic patronage. He assumed that there
was something in poetry, when Lord Byron condescended to
write it. Your Wordsworths and Rogerses might have gone on
as long as they pleased, and his Grace would not have read them.
If he had lived to see the Earl of Derby translating the "Iliad,"
he would have patronised Homer. When a Bunsen talked of the
early monarchs of Egypt, the Duke was a'ably interested. It
was his fate to be also surprised.
"When I go to England," said the Chevalier, "one of my rst
visits will be to a place called Kingsleat. Do you know it?"
" I have a residence close to it."
"Ah, then, you ma know a Mr. Lonsdale, perhaps. He cor-
responds with me. c has a profound knowledge of these sub-

~Lest. I wish he would publish his theories. I shall go to sit at
' feet and drink in his wisdom."
" Gad," thought the duke, "Winter saved me from making a
greater mistake than I imagined."
But Mr. Lonsdale never published his theories, being well
content that they should be incorporated in the system of an
expounder far more inuential than himself.
The ne old Manor-house of Branscombe has been restored
and superbly furnished, and is indeed the chief show- lace of the
country. But the head of the house never dwelt t ere. The
sudden death of his son was too much for him. There was no
work of revenge for him to do, for the assassin was dead. He
saw his son's son, but took little interest in him ; and, within a
year of Raphael's death, the old man lay beside him at Sorrento.
But Marmaduke was determined to see the old place tly
restored. He gave himself up to it with extreme energy. He
also took the amplest legal precautions to secure the estates, now
free from mortgages, to Ra hael's sonand, failing him, to the
male issue of Stephen and sole. The young Raphael was left to
Stephen Langton's sole guardianship. When he had made these
arrangements, and seen the Manor-house in a perfect state of
restoration, the old Wolf suddenly disappeared, 'giving no clue to
his whereabouts. -
Mr. Page's quiet residence in Idlechester, with its dainty
gardens, was inhabited by two ladies. You might see them
walking together in those ex uisite avenues of colour and per-
fume where Stephen Langtonqhad in his boyhood led enchanted
' hours. The elder of them was stranve to look uponstrange,
yet beautiful , Abundant tresses had she upon her shapely head,
but every hair was white as snow. The dark eyes, in which had
burned the ame of love, of wrath, of disdain, were luminous
still ; but in their depths dwelt a tranquil melancholy, a divine
pity for her companion.
And her companion also was exquisite in beauty, but when
you looked upon her e es you saw no meaning there. Their
ight was quenched. A through the long years of her death in
life, never again would a recognising glance ash from those
sweet brown eyes which Stephen Langton loved of yore. What
had chanced to the soul to which that beautiful body was now a
prison, a mansion no longer? Claudia could not guess. It was
impossible to say whether any memory of the past, any clear
knowledge of the present, was ossessed by this stricken creature.
The sensuous enjoyment of t e summer garden, of the winter
- reside, she seemed to feel: but she s oke seldom, and only once
or twice during Claudia's sisterl ten ence of her did she break
through the even tenor of her li e. Onl once or twice, early in
the morning, she had sprung from her ed, and torn away her
night-dress with trembling hands, moaning

Claudia tended her with pitiful remorseful tendence. She
gave 11 her life to her cousin. When Raphael died, and Stephen
wedde Isola, the Panther resigned her passionate pursuit of
excitement. She took sweet Anne Page away to England, with
Morll's full consent, and dwelt with her in the old ldlechester
house, and lived a very tranquil, very solitary life. She did
daily, hourly penance for the ast. There were men of the
wor d and women of fashion in ndon who still remembered
the renown of the Pantherher beauty and daring and caprice ;
but Miss Branscombe, of Idlechester, was only known for her
kindness to the poor, and the retired life which she led with her
imbecile cousin. Few visitors had she save her Uncle Walter,
whose decaying years found their chief solace in intercourse with
the niece once so wild and now so calm; for his daughter had
deserted him to become Lady Superior of a Protestant nunnery,
and the Rector was left alone. As to Humphrey Morll, he
went back to his profession with double energy. He is now
Solicitor-General and MP. for Idlechester, and occasionally
passes the recess with his uncle, the Bisho , who forgave him
when he saw his terrible punishment. Sir umphrey may pro-
blzliblygake his seat on the Woolsack as Lord Kingsleat one of
t ose avs.
Stephen Langton acce ted the char e of Raphael Branscombe's
son. The boy was half '11 lish, half gorsican. Stephen decided
that he should pass his ear y boyhood at least amid the Homeric
simplicity of his native island. Stephen determined to dwell at
the Casa Montaltito explore the whole romantic islandto
make Raphael's son a daring boatman, a resolute swimmer, a
stron -lunged and sure-footed mountaineer. For himself, he
woul give his leisure to literature-would write a history of
Corsica, or an epic with Pasquale Paoli as hero, or a drama with
Na oleon as protagonist.
pon the coral-tinged sands of Isola Rossa behold a leasant
group, gazing on the sapphire sea, and waiting for the Fantasia,
a good sea~boat still, which has gone round to Ajaccio for the
letters and parcels by the Marseilles mail. Stephen is the most
prominent gure, bronzed, bearded, broad-shouldered, in the very
prime of his life, widely changed from the fair-haired boy who
oitered in the Idlechester gardens with sweet Anne Page. Isola
looks matronly, of course ; but it is a very dainty iresentment of
matronhood ; and how sparkles still her silver aughter how
deliciously she sings vocen' at sunset for the children's delight!
For there are children. Not only Raphael's wild and wayward
boybut a couple of other young rascals. Stephen and Claude,
and a pretty little girl just ve years old, who was fantastically
christened Isola Rossa, and who had done her utmost to deserve
the ap llation by growing hair whose colour would ll Millais

young Corsicans play upon the ruddy-veined sand, while Staphen
smokes his cigar and dreams, and Isola calmly drinks in the ever
more magical beauty of the familiar scene.
There was in Stephen Langton's temperament a touch of
. Goethe's artistic enjoying, with the belief (Homeric but anti-
Tennysonian) that man is superior to woman. " The reduction.
- of the masculine character to insignicance " is, as Mr. Herman
Merivale remarks (Historical Studies, p. 174, note), the " rst
peculiarity" of Tennyson, and doubtless tends to that " enormous
popularity " (among women and e'eminate men) which his works
ave attained. But Mr. Tennyson's is not a true view of human '
nature. Stephen, however, while he had the Goethe capacity for
sensuous enjoyment and for Homeric simplicity, had not passed
in Corsica these ten delicious years without frequent desires for
some interruption of the divine monotone" something craggy
to break upon," as Byron called it. A long catenation of similar
events is apt.to become intolerableeven though each event be ~
leasanteven though you live like Laertes of old in a divine
island like Corsica, with a wife as beautiful and brilliant as the
most. poetic imagination can conceive, and with sturdy Corsi-
can boys whom you teach to swim and row, and climb, and
speak the truth and reverence God, and read Hamlet and the
Odyssey in the Original, and a charming baby girl, elf, witch,
fairy, embryo woman, whom you leave to her mother to teach
what she will. So Stephen found himself now and then long-
ing for a change, and Would perhaps have welcomed a tem-
orary change for the worse. The dwellers in Olympus may
ow content, but to us articulate-speaking mortals it is not
given.
Besid'es, Stephen Langton was too thorough an Englishman to
satisfy himself with Goethe's segment of the sphere of life. He
often felt very strongly that there must be duties for him to do
at home. Echoes, rare and remote, of the life in England-
which in his heart he deemed the noblest life liveable among
mencame to him across land and sea. Seldom arrived the mail
without bringing him some new im ulse thitherward. This
fainant life shamed him now and t en. Besides, there were
these boys to educateyoung Raphael, ten years old, keen as a
falcon, with all his father's spirit and all the stern resolve of the
Montalti, inheritor of two destinies, was t for Eton now. The
other youngsters would soon require a public school. He was
silently ripening his determination to move for England as he
awaited the coming of the F antam'a.
The boat came swiftly round the point at last. Stephen sprang
to his feet and put his glass to his e e. There sat in the stern
an unexpected voyager, a kingl -t roated, mi hty-shouhlered,
patriarch-bearded man, steering t e light craft t rough the glit-
tering surf.
" Hallo, Isola," said Stephen, " here's a stranger."

The boat was run ashore; the three boys, waist-deep in the
water, were clamorously welcoming the new-comer with
"Evviva! evvival benvenutol"
Isola, light-footed as a fawn, sprang forward to welcomeher
father. 
Ay, the old Wolf had arrived. Where had he been? Well,
this story is aromance; and I doubt not the critics will cut it
up severely for its improbabilities, impossibilities. absurdities;
but if I were to tell you all the details of the old Wolf's adven-
tures in those ten years it would utterly horrify those same
critics. From the " Thousand and One Nights" down to dear
Captain Marryat's " Pasha of Many Tales," nothing has been
recorded so incredible as Mr. Marmaduke Branscombe's adven-
tures. They were told to his grandchildren by the wood re in
the eat hall at Branscombe, and lasted many a winter night,
and Trrather think of collecting them, under the taking title of
" The Old Wolf's Yarns."
For, having returned with intent to settle quietly, Marmaduke
Branscombe enforced upon Stephen Langton the importance of
going back to England. Branscombe ought to be inhabited;
Raphael the younger ought to be prepared for his coming career
as an English squire of ancient race; all the boys ought to be
educated ; ay, and the younger IsolaIsola Rosaought to be
intloctrinated in English young ladyhood, and to be made avoid
slang and cultivate hypocrisy. This last Isola the elder believed
she would never learn.
Of course, when everybody is very much of the same opinion
there is no diiculty in action. And, the moment he had seri-
ously entertained the question, Stephen began to pine for Eng-
land. The idea ashed upon him that he was just of the age to
begin life seriously. After a boyhood and youth of adventure
and love. he had every chance of obtaining renown in his man-
hood. This long isolation in Corsica with his wife and children
and books and dreams, with the mountains and the Mediter-
ranean and poetry, would be no bad preparative for an energetic
career in England. So it was not long before the bells rang wel-
come in Kingsleat and Idlechesterbefore the old Wolf had
found himself a grim dark lair in the most ancient part of the
Manor-housebefore Raphael and Stephen and Claude and Isola
Rossa were laughing on the lawns, and mm ing with the dogs,
and riding the ponies of the rare old place efore Mrs. Langton
was receiving the calls of county and city, and Stephen was
thinking" What next 'I "

resulted from pecuniary difculty. His valet gave evidence that the
