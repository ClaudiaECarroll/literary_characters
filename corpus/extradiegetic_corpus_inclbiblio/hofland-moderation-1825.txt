CHAPTER I. 
WHEN the Rector of Ravenhill arose 
from his breakfast table one spring morning 
in 18  and retired to his study, notwith- 
standing his three daughters were present, 
perfect silence reigned in the room until they 
were sensible that his library door was closed;, 
and his steps directed to a certain bay win- 
dow, which possessed the double advantage 
of seclusion from domestic sounds, and of 
a widely extended prospect over a beautiful 
country. 
This silence did not proceed from awe, for 
to confess the truth, that was a quality the 
Rector was rather deemed deficient in his 
power of inspiring, being a man more gene- 
rally loved than feared, both in the house and 
the parish ;  but surprise, which is sorae-

what related to that emotion, he had undoubt- 
edly awakened, as his eldest daughter, Har- 
riet, indignantly announced by the observa- 
tion which followed upon his removal. 
" I cannot imagine how my father can 
think of such a thing as laying down the 
carriage  it strikes me as preposterous to the 
greatest degree  how can any body live in 
the country without a carriage ? especially 
a person who has three daughters situated as 
we are." 
Miss Carysford did not explain what she 
meant by the word situated, and it appeared 
that her sister Emma did not read it as mean- 
ing " young women seeking for establish- 
ments," for she observed in a soothing man- 
ner : 
" It is because we are so situated, that my 
father deems it advisable to lessen his ex- 
penses, and secure us a continuance of our 
solid comforts. I thought his reasons wry 
sufficient ones : every body knows that as 
Charles is of age, more than half his income 
is transferred to him from his taking posses- 
sion of our dear mother's jointure ; and we 
are ourselves well aware that from the style 
she always supported, it was impossible for

him to save any thing hitherto to speak of ; 
it is therefore a good time to begin, when 
the occasion is so evident as to proclaim its 
oropriety." 
" I don't think it right at all," said the 
eldest sister. " The action is right, but the 
intention grounded upon it is wrong," ob- 
served Sophia, the youngest. 
" That I must deny," returned Harriet, 
" the action is decidedly ill-judged, because 
my father ought to maintain the respecta- 
bility of his family, and his own rank in life ; 
but the intention is, like every thing he does, 
kind and disinterested, considerate and affec- 
tionate." 
" Poor man ! his worldly cares are indeed 
abundant for his children, but how much 
better would it be if he directed them to 
those beyond the grave ; had he proposed to 
lay down the carriage, and appropriate the 
income thereby saved to the London Mis- 
sionary Society, then indeed he would have 
acted worthy of the name he bears as a mi- 
nister of Christ ; but to do it, that he may 
add ' house to house, and field to field,' that 
he may ' increase the mammon of unright- 
eousness,' in my opinion is quite dreadful."

" Ridiculous ! you are Missionary mad   
if the coach is to be given up, I would ad- 
vise that the pannels should make you a cell, 
and the linings a strait waistcoat  that would 
be a family benefit." 
" Better it were I should be so situated, than 
enter with you, Miss Carysford, into that 
place ' where the worm dieth not, and the 
fire is not quenched,'  that place, where 
there shall be ' instead of a girdle, a rent ; 
instead of well set hair, baldness ; and burn- 
ing instead of beauty." 
With these words, slowly and emphatically 
pronounced, with the air of a maledictory 
prophecy, Sophia, taking up a number of 
pamphlets which she had been reading, left 
the room. As Miss Carysford was an ac- 
knowledged beauty, and gave to her person 
all the cares and the advantages which belong 
to ladies holding that rank in creation, every 
syllabic had its immediate reference, and ex- 
cited such violent anger as to give her line 
but infuriated countenance the character of 
a ' burning beauty,' even now. She pro- 
tested (with a good deal of truth undoubt- 
edly) that " Sophia was the most provoking 
creature that ever existed, a disgrace to the

family, a pest in the village, a canker that 
was eating out the very heart of her father, 
and a person in short who ought to be turned 
out of the house, as unworthy its countenance 
and protection." 
Having so spoken during a rapid promenade 
round the breakfast parlour, Harriet threw 
herself on a sofa, wiped the few tears which 
scalded her cheeks, and looked earnestly to- 
wards Emma as if for answer or observation ; 
but since neither occurred, she added, " can 
you say a word in her behalf? a single word?" 
"She is very sincere, very conscientious, if 
we do not approve her zeal, nor partake her 
feelings, we must do justice to her principles, 
my dear Harriet." 
" Umph ! her sincerity consists in abusing 
every body under the precious pretext of 
caring for their souls, her zeal, in passing 
sentence of condemnation on every human 
being out of the pale of those vulgar wretches 
with whom she has associated herself  her 
principles instigate her, most blasphemously 
(as I call it) to quote the scriptures on the 
most trifling and irrelevant occasions ; to 
mix the most sacred and profane things irre- 
verently  to drain the pence from starving

cottagers, in furtherance of some chimerical 
scheme one day, and the next to strip her- 
self for some worthless object of charity, as 
to be left in a poverty disgraceful to us all. 
Does she not class my father himself with the 
ignorant, the bigoted? is he not 'a proud 
priest,' 'an idle watchman,' 'a blind guide', 
and give him a thousand other such appella- 
tions ?  and is this to be borne from a girl of 
nineteen ? No ! my father ought not to suffer 
it, we are all wrong to submit to her insults, 
her cold-hearted, unfeeling, intolerant."  
Perhaps it was the want of another epithet 
which checked this effusion of wrath ; it was 
at least evident to Emma, that her sister did 
not cease to think because she ceased to 
complain and resent ; for she was still agi- 
tated  but, as her passions were generally 
short-lived, advancing rapidly to maturity, 
and being subject to sudden death, Emma 
waited for that important moment before she 
ventured to say a word for the party ar- 
raigned, when she observed : 
" If my father, as the head of his house, 
and the pastor of a flock, can put up with the 
peculiarities of poor Sophia, in consideration 
of her pure good meaning, and her many

good qualities, to say nothing of those ties 
which bind us all to each other indissoluble, 
surelv we are bound to endure them, sister 9 
to use her own language, she is frequently 'a 
cross to us,' but we can have no doubt that 
it is our duty to bear it." 
" It is very well for you, who are a kind 
of half methodist, half philosopher, to reason 
in that way, but I have not been accustomed 
to vulgar associations, or inured to low no- 
tions. I can neither forget whose daughter 
I am, nor what society I have mixed with, 
though you may do it, having undoubtedly 
something wherewith to comfort you to which 
your elder sister cannot pretend." 
" That difference is very trifling, Harriet." 
" It is however sufficient were it properly ap- 
plied, to prevent us from the mortification my 
father contemplates, and which will vex 
Charles excessively, and be a cruel reflec- 
tion on him, in my opinion, not that I ex- 
pect any sacrifice from you  calm, moderate, 
calculating, people of your description seldom 
do wrong it is true, but we must not expect 
such still waters to rise above their own level, 
to overflow' generously." 
Emma did not replv, but she arose a few

minutes afterwards, and announced an inten- 
tion of calling on a friend in the village, who 
was unwell and in trouble, enquiring if Har- 
riet would accompany her. 
" No, I cannot go, but I am glad you 
are going, for you will do them all good, poor 
things." 
And when Emma had closed the door, and 
departed on her errand of kindness, Harriet 
wondered how it had been possible to use one 
word of reproach, one tone of ill humour, 
towards a sister so gentle, yet so active, and 
whose heart she well knew to be as ardent in 
affection, as generous in action, as that of 
any human being, notwithstanding the asser- 
tion she had so lately made. 
Whilst Emma proceeds to Thorpedale, we 
will give such a review of the history of the 
Carysford family, as may in some measure 
account for the difference of character ob- 
servable in the female branches, desirino: our 
readers to recolleet, that notwithstanding the 
disputed points it was our misfortune to de- 
pict in the first instance, the persons in ques- 
tion were in high esteem among their neigh- 
bours and connections. They were all so 
handsome, that the hacknied epithet of "the

graces," was applied with more propriety than 
usual to them among their visitants, and 
their humbler acquaintance usually designated 
them " as good as they were handsome." A 
pious and tender father, an elegant, high- 
born, and accomplished mother, had super- 
intended their education, and it is certain, 
that their minds were cultivated, and their 
manners suasive in general ; but in all houses 
there are rehearsals behind the scenes, in 
which the general give way to the individual 
traits of character, and the honest chronicler 
of human nature must give shadows as well 
as lights, in order to produce the portrait 
which truth will own, or that which it will 
be useful for us to contemplate.

CHAP. II. 
1 he Rev. Charles Carysford was the son of 
a merchant who was a rare example of wis- 
dom and moderation, for he retired into the 
country as soon as he had acquired such a 
fortune as to ensure the comforts of compe- 
tency, at a period of life when he was still 
capable of enjoyment, instead of seeking 
wealth to the very verge of existence, losing 
at once the pleasures of this world, and the 
provision for the next. 
One motive for this early retirement arose 
from the extremely delicate health of his 
eldest child, a very sweet girl ; and some 
fear that her brother on leaving his school in 
the country might partake the same evil. 
Happily Charles grew up in every respect ac- 
cording to their wishes, he was tall, graceful, 
and although of delicate complexion, yet re- 
markable for his manly beauty and personal 
activity. Untinctured by the vices- and un-

MODERATION. 11 
fettered by the artificial forms, of life in cities, 
he united with singular, yet not inelegant, 
simplicity of manners, a passionate attach- 
ment to literature, and with this direction of 
mind, aided by humanity and great sweetness 
of temper, his father was led to think him 
peculiarly qualified to make an exemplary 
and happy country clergyman. 
To this purpose his studies were directed, 
and advancing time proved the choice to 
have been wise. Emma, the daughter, did not 
partake her brother's bodily strength, but she 
shared his mental energies and his fine taste. 
Their parents did not live long after the time 
when they had purchased the advowson of 
the Rectory of Ravenhill for their son, whi- 
ther they had removed with him ; and the 
brother and sister lived after their death in 
such strict amity, that for several years it 
was believed that the handsome Rector (as 
he was universally stiled) would never marry. 
Such was not however the opinion of Lady 
Lyster, who with her husband Sir Marma- 
duke, resided (as their fathers had done some 
centuries before them) at Ravenhill Park, a 
place their hospitality kept pretty generally 
full of company, amongst which Mr. and

Miss Carysford were introduced as dear and 
respectable friends. Like many cld families 
who reside constantly in the country, the 
Lysters had a good deal of that pardonable 
attachment to ancestry from which few per- 
sons are exempt who have any pretensions 
to it; but with this they inherited, and 
adopted also, that deep veneration for the 
sacred profession, persons of more modernized 
manners dispense with. Let the Rector of 
Ravenhill have been what he might as to 
person and manners, so long as he performed 
his duties as a minister and a man con- 
scientiously, he would have been received as 
a friend, and held as a gentleman ; it was 
therefore natural that they should hold the 
present incumbent in more than ordinary re 
gard, and conceive themselves happy in pre- 
senting him to their more fashionable guests, 
as a gem not often found in rural societv. 
To this disposition for exhibiting her Rec- 
tor it must be added, that lady Lyster (a 
good-natured, kind-hearted creature, child- 
less, but full of maternal feelings) was a 
little given to match-making. Happy as a 
wife herself, she conceived (perhaps very 
erroneously) that to be happy, every body

MODERATION. 13 
must be married ; for two or three years she 
made numerous efforts for disposing of Miss 
Carysford in this way, notwithstanding the 
apparent hopelessness of persuading a wo- 
man whose mind was as powerful as her 
person was weak, to commit what would be 
in her case an evident act of folly. After 
that time, she gave her thoughts and wishes 
to a generous solicitude on the subject for 
her brother. 
Sir Marmaduke did not impede the schemes 
of his lady, but he could not do much to for- 
ward them, because there were few points of 
similarity in their taste, and neither were 
sufficiently men of the world to adopt traits 
of character foreign to their respective habits ; 
so that, with much esteem and ever warm af- 
fection for each other, neither was quite de- 
void of contempt for the other's judgment in 
certain points. They seldom disagreed on 
any subject, but unluckily they had no sub- 
jects in common. The Rector lived on lite- 
rature  a new book, or even a new edition, 
gifts from the world of letters, and more 
especially that of poetry, were to him the 
milk and honey of life. A huge package of 
quartos was never too much for him to carry

home from the nearest market town, albeit 
distant more than five miles, if it had so 
happened he had walked thither ; and his 
servant was always weleome to his favourite 
steed to fetch thence even the most trilling pe- 
riodical. 'Tis true, to his taste for reading he 
added that of drawing, in which art his sis- 
ter excelled ; nor was he ignorant of music 
and botany, the latter of which added plea- 
sure to those walks and rides over an exten- 
sive parish to which his duties called him ; 
and the whole of those accomplishments and 
predilections, in the opinion of the Baronet, 
rendered him a very unsocial companion. 
" AYould you believe it? that fine looking 
fellow Carysford never rode out of a snail's 
pace in his life,  can't hunt at all, Sir, and 
has no more eve for a shot than a mole. Jn 
fact, he can't draw a trigger, he has'nt the 
hear' to do it, 1 really believe ; yet the man 
is no milksop, he has ventured both through 
fire and water to aid the parishioners. Then 
he can't carve even a turkey : never knows 
what vintage he is drinking, plays whist so 
abominably we are obliged to have a quad- 
rille table on purpose for him ; and, 'tis a 
fact, that the greatest fool in the village can

cheat him out of five shillings in ten  not 
that they do, no ! not a hair of his head 
shall be hurt, while I have a rood, or a 
guinea." 
Now as Lady Lyster believed that, notwith- 
standing these deficiencies, Mr. Carysford 
would make an excellent and a happy hus- 
band, the more charges were brought against 
him, the more industriously did she repel 
them ; and it so happened, that she was lis- 
tened to with more than ordinary compla- 
cency by two sisters who arrived on the first 
of September, and probably found themselves 
a little incommoded by the boisterous man- 
ners of certain country 'squires, or disgusted 
by the frivolity of dandy sportsmen imported 
from the county town. 
These ladies, Alathea and Harriet Tintagell. 
were Honourables, being daughters to the 
late, and aunts to the present, Lord Alfreton, 
an infant. They were highly accomplished 
women, the eldest was esteemed very hand- 
some, and very witty ; the youngest very 
pretty, and very amiable ; but her figure was 
diminutive, and appeared at a first glance 
more so than it really was, from being con- 
trasted with so fine a form as that of her

sister. They shared alike the personal pro- 
perty of the late lord, amounting to some- 
thing more than twenty thousand pounds, 
but the elder sister's fortune had been nearly 
doubled by the bequest of her godmother, 
a lady of high rank. 
AVhether the satirical vein of this lady had 
frightened all the men in that distinguished 
cirele where she shone a star (literally) of 
magnitude and brilliance ; or whether she 
was sincere in her assertion, " that she would 
lead a single life," we know not ; but it is 
certain that she had now entered her twenty- 
seventh summer in that state, and what was 
more extraordinary, still gave daily proof, 
" that she could hear 
A sister's praises with unwounded car," 
for she never appeared more happy than when 
the fair and elegant Harriet attracted the ad- 
miration so justly her due. They were in- 
deed attached to each other beyond the ties 
of blood; they had lost their parents early 
in life, their brother had married unworthily 
and died prematurely, leaving his only child 
to the sole care of a mother with whom they 
could hold no intercourse ; each was therefore

all to the other. Each had her full share of 
family pride, but it was controlled by the 
higher pride of intellect in Alathea, and by 
gentle and truly delicate perception of pro- 
priety in Harriet, but this being well known 
to Lady Lyster, and greatly approved by her 
as a principle, it certainly never entered 
her mind to provide the Rector with a wife, 
in a quarter where the case forbade all hope 
of success. 
This might be the reason perhaps, that the 
poor man fell insensibly into that state of 
anxiety, showed those occasional gleams of 
delight, and thence sunk into that despond- 
ency which betrayed the feelings never 
awakened before, in a heart so warm in its 
attachments, so full of the milk of human 
kindness, through every gradation of philan- 
thropy, as to lead common observers to form 
a very different expectation. The moment 
Mr. Carysford perceived his own state, he 
resolutely avoided visiting at the Park, and 
the ladies determined to return to town be- 
fore the time originally intended. 
It was evident, that Harriet loved at least 
as fondly as she was loved ; that family pride, 
and maiden coyness, alike yielded before that

deep and ardent passion, which she bad un- 
consciously imbibed, in those solitudes where 
every circumstance had favoured the en- 
croachment of a sentiment, aided by volun- 
tary admiration and perfect esteem for the 
character of the beloved. Sir Marmaduke 
was at this period perpetually employed in 
the sports of the field, Lady Lyster engaged 
with hospitalities in her house, charities in her 
village, and some family solicitudes of great 
importance, including the marriage of her only 
brother.  " Where could the sisters spend their 
mornings so pleasantly as with the sensible 
invalid at the rectory ? how could they be 
so safely escorted to all the beauties of the 
neighbourhood, as by her excellent brother?" 
The Baronet said, "it was a foolish affair, 
and bad for the parish," and wished the 
women in the red sea; Lady Lyster cried, and 
declared trulv, " that she had had no hand 
in it,"  to the utter astonishment of all who 
had ever known her; JSiiss Tintagell, after 
shutting herself up twenty-four hours in her 
apartment, and emerging thence pale and 
haggard, as if from suffering acutely, declared 
it as her decided opinion "that Harriet 
would act wisely and well, in accepting Mr.

Carysford ; she loved him, she was independent, 
and had her sister's sanction for her conduct." 
The rest will be readily supplied by the 
imagination of our young readers ; but one 
particular attendant on this union must be 
revealed, for it will not be conceived. This 
was the constant gratitude expressed and 
acted upon by the husband towards his wife 
and sister-in-law, during the whole course of 
his married life. As a most amiable and 
unique trait of character, it well deserves to 
be recorded, but the consequences were no 
altogether such as we can retrace with plea- 
sure. Mrs. Carysford became the mother of 
a numerous family, (four of which survived 
her,) and though tenderly attached to them 
all, she could not prevail upon herself to 
abandon, for their sakes, that stile of living to 
which her birth and fortune entitled her, in 
order to secure the provision necessary for 
children so born and educated as hers. Her 
own fortune was settled on herself, and in 
case of her demise on her eldest son, on whom 
the father also intended to bestow the living 
he held, so that there was but too much 
reason to fear, that these lovely young 
women, after enjoying all the elegant com-

forts which appertain to an extensive estab- 
lishment and easy income, would be either 
compelled to marry for convenience, or 
condemned to the privations and obscurity 
attendant on narrow means, during that por- 
tion of existence when the goods of fortune 
are most valuable, because most consolatory.

CHAP. III. 
Although Miss Tintagell gave thus ge- 
nerously consent to the marriage of her 
sister, yet it was five years before she came 
to visit the Rectory for any length of time, 
notwithstanding the undiminished attachment 
she still showed to her sister. During that 
period she had certainly refused several ex- 
cellent offers, and her gaiety of dress, the 
attractions of her person, and the brilliance 
of her conversation were undiminished. From 
this period, she attached herself much to the 
eldest girl, became sponsor to the boy, and 
took as much interest in the family, as a per- 
son could do who dreaded the approach of a 
rude touch upon an unspotted muslin, and 
delighted in that "keen encounter of wits," 
forbidden by nursery details. After some 
time her visits became much more frequent, 
and Harriet generally, but not constantly, 
returned with her to town, where she enjoyed

those advantages of education ii was not 
possible to obtain in the country. Here how- 
ever their excellent father left little to regret 
on this account. On the marriage of her 
brother, Miss Carysford removed to a cot- 
tage within a little distance, which she fitted 
up with great taste and com fort, and where 
she generally had one of her brother's children 
with her. This child after a time became 
Emma exclusively, for Harriet was almost 
stationary in London at that period when 
she was sufficiently grown to be a companion 
to Miss Tintagell. Charles was too much 
engaged with his studies to leave his father, 
and the younger branches too troublesome for 
one whose protracted existence was still that 
of a valetudinarian, willing but unable to 
endure exertion of any kind. 
Perhaps few marriages have been equally 
happy with that of Mr. Carvsford, for all 
that was excellent in his character at the time 
when it took place, improved with his more 
extended duties, and matured by time into 
the ripeness of solid virtue. " He was in- 
dulgent to a fault," Lady Lyster acknow- 
ledged; but she maintained also "that he was 
without a fault," and this all the poor in the

district re-echoed, maintaining, "his Worship 
was all goodness, and Madam very little be- 
hind him." His sister alone knew where his 
failings lay, and where his troubles were felt ; 
for to her both were laid open as they had 
been from infancy, with all the candour and 
contrition, with which a heart (so pure and 
humble a christian heart) laments error or 
bewails suffering. 
No circumstance could have induced Mr. 
Carysford to live beyond his income, because 
that he would have deemed a failure of actual 
integrity ; nor could the extraordinary ex- 
penses of any } T ear ever induce him to en- 
croach on that sum which, from the day he 
took possession of the living, he appropriated 
to charities connected with it  but the con- 
tinual solicitude he felt to do more, and the 
incapability of effecting his wishes, fre- 
quently harassed his spirits, and deeply af- 
fected those of his excellent sister. It was 
from her conversations, her lessons, and her 
example, that Emma imbibed all that was 
most solid and estimable in her character  
that she substituted the meekness of religious 
obedience for the mere external gentleness of 
manners j tempered the fire of youth and the

acutcncss of sensibility with sober reflection 
and calm resolution ; subduing a vivid ima- 
gination and the generous enthusiasm of a 
noble spirit, and a refined taste, a devout, 
pious, and charitable heart, to the dictates of 
m deration. 
When Emma was in her eighteenth year, 
the long fragile tenement in which that pure 
soul was enshrined, which even on the couch 
of sickness and under the pressure of pain 
had for years been a blessing to many, 
gave indications of dissolution that could not 
be mistaken. Mrs. Carysford therefore sum- 
moned her eldest daughter home, that she 
might partake the cares of the family ; at 
the same time placing her third daughter at 
school from an equally kind motive, that of 
leaving herself at liberty to attend to the in- 
valid and her husband, and enabling Sophia 
to pursue the finishing studies necessary for 
completing her education. 
But the last sigh had escaped the patient 
sufferer before Harriet's return, who therefore, 
finding herself of no use and little import- 
ance, sincerely regretted her recall, though 
she had too much affection and proper feel- 
ins to bctrav the ennui under which she la-

boured at the Rectory, in consequence of 
leaving town in the season of gaiety, and 
visiting the country in the season of afflic- 
tion. This affliction was indeed not poignant, 
a long expected event had occurred, a chris- 
tian fitted for the change was removed ; and 
selfish, sorrow was controlled by the full 
belief that the evils of life were exchanged 
" for an exceeding weight of glory," but there 
was a religious pensiveness, a tender melan- 
choly, an anxiety of affection towards one 
another in the members of the family, which, 
whilst it drew the chords which bound them 
to each other more strongly where it was 
felt, acted painfully where it was not expe- 
rienced. 
At this time they had a little girl, Alathea, 
who was younger by seven years than the 
child who had preceded her, and she was 
doated upon by the parents with that peculiar 
fondness generally accorded to the last prat- 
tler, the last plaything of a large family, who 
never fails to combine all that has charmed 
the mother's eye, and won the father's heart 
before, with innumerable graces and witch- 
eries of its own. This child, in the course of 
a month or two after the death of its aunt,

was seized with the measles, which left be- 
hind a train of disorders that proved fatal the 
ensuing autumn. On this distressing event 
taking place, Miss Tintagell flew to console 
her sister, and with equal surprise and grief 
perceived that which had alike escaped her- 
self and her family, that the afflicted mother 
was far gone in decline, probably brought on 
by her indefatigable attention to the little 
sufferer. 
From the hour that this discovery was made, 
the heart of the husband seemed rent in 
twain; he was a man of calm but exalted 
piety, of firm faith and of unfeigned sub- 
mission to the God and Father whom he 
worshipped, not less in word than deed, but 
his very nature was so much that of domestic 
love, and his habits so entirely those of 
connubial friendship, that this third rapidly 
succeeding trial seemed to ask for more 
fortitude than he could find. He murmured 
not, but he be ,t beneath the stroke, and that 
manly beauty hitherto so remarkable, and 
which his active, temperate, and happy life 
had hitherto preserved, faded as rapidly as 
that of the beloved countenance which in 
every languid smile betraved decay and death.

Thus in fifteen months, three losses were 
experienced in this lately flourishing family, 
of the most touching and harrowing descrip- 
tion. The loss of her mother occasioned 
Sophia to be sent for home, and all idea of 
her return relinquished, as Mr. Carysford na- 
turally desired to see his children around him ; 
and as she was much the most like her mother, 
(being of an exquisitely fair complexion, with 
blue eyes and luxuriant flaxen tresses,) it waf 
hoped that she would afford painful yet : o- 
lacing interest to her widowed father. 
Sophia was the only daughter, as we have 
already seen, who had been sent from home 
for education, even for a short period  she 
was in her sixteenth year when she went to 
school, had somewhat outgrown her strength, 
and was a girl of such vivid feelings, that 
her parents rather sent her out of the way of 
sufferins:, than considered the circumstance of 
improvement, her acquirements being already 
satisfactory. Mr. Carysford had heard the 
lady at the head of that establishment they 
thought most convenient for the purpose ex- 
tolled for her piety, and Mrs. Carysford had 
assured herself as to the merits of the at- 
tendant masters, and with this they unfor-

tunately were satisfied.  The first vacation 
which brought home tliis daughter, found 
them attending the sick bed of Alathea, 
and too much engaged to remark ;uiv thing 
in Sophia, l)csides her good looks and her 
continual conversation on death, from which 
they concluded that her health might sutler 
from witnessing the scenes of sickness and 
sorrow now pressing on the family ; and 
therefore to save her as much as possible, 
she was not called to share them further. 
But it now became evident, that a new, 
and, in her aunt's opinio a an alarming bias 
had been given to the mind of this vounir 
creature during her absence, which was na- 
turally aided by the awful events in her 
family. Going far beyond the religious pre- 
cepts inculcated by her father, and acted 
upon in her family, outstripping every pre- 
cept divulged by her departed aunt, and trea- 
sured in the memory of her deeply reflective 
sister; Sophia stepped forward as the apostle 
who should convert her family, reform the 
neighbourhood, or failing that, become a 
victim to their cruelty, a proof of their un- 
righteousness, and a martyr to their persecu- 
tion.

So naturally does every human being, more 
especially those of habitually well-directed 
views, look to God in the hour of affliction, 
and search for the promises of the gospel, 
that the words of Sophia, though remarkable, 
were not considered by her family as arising 
from any other cause than that which strongly 
affected their own feelings ; and she was the 
less liable to remark, because Miss Tintagell 
and Harriet were much together in the dress- 
ing-room of the former; Charles was sent to 
Cambridge; and Emma, as one habituated to 
the tender offices of a nurse, applied herself 
to amusing her father : when therefore it was 
announced to the family by Sir Marmaduke, 
"that Miss Sophy had been converted or per- 
verted at school, had attached herself to what 
was termed the ' dissenting interest,' in the 
village, who had of late brought in some new- 
fangled kind of preaching at the tailor's, 
and that she was doing her best to raise sub- 
scriptions for a chapel, being herself a kind 
of public prayer and teacher," nothing could 
exceed the alarm and sorrow, the anger and 
contempt, expressed by the different branches 
of the family.

the house, they bad witnessed her zealous re- 
monstrances, remarked her charity, which was 
carried to excess ; but a conduct so contrary 
to all they conceived decorous or dutiful, had 
not entered their minds. Mr. Carysford gen- 
tly reasoned with her, but to little purpose; 
but all that was blameable was soon greatly 
increased by the unwise conduct of her aunt 
and her eldest sister, whose violence of in- 
vective and scornful treatment, by conveying 
the idea that they despised religion itself, led 
her to conclude, " that she must be right, be- 
cause they were wrong," and she deemed 
herself a persecuted saint, a glorious martyr. 
She threw herself and her cause into the arms 
of the enthusiastic and discontented ; and by 
rousing their passions in her behalf, rendered 
that a serious schism in the congregation, 
which had been merely the idle vagary of a 
few wandering lovers of any change. 
Never did minister love his people more 
entirelv than the Kector of Ravenhill. and 
whilst his general liberality rendered him kind 
to all parties, and conciliating in all cedeable 
points, he yet suffered severely from the be- 
lief that any for whom he laboured in spirit, 
and loved in sincerity, would forsake him.

He bore the trouble meekly and manfully, 
but he suffered not the less severely. Emma 
was his sole support, and in her self-govern- 
ment, young- as she was, and acutely as she 
deplored the circumstance, he found the sym- 
pathy he required, and at times, even the 
counsel, which was always that of dignified 
endurance of injury from others, and mild 
expostulation, but not restraint, towards his 
daughter. Sophia became in the mean time 
a positive idol with her party, and was ex- 
alted in the Meeting in proportion as she was 
persecuted at home ; whilst Emma, without 
the solace of such pity or admiration, became 
really a kind of victim to both parties, and 
received the arrows of each with uncomplain- 
ing patience, and even reviving cheerfulness, 
when she considered herself the shield that 
received them for her father's safety. He 
was in all things her paramount object ; but 
she was also tenderly attached to both her 
sisters, and held her brother as especially 
dear, as only brothers generally are. As 
Sophia had no direct friend in the house, 
Emma constantly apologized for her, in con- 
sequence of which, Miss Tintagell maintain- 
ed, " either, that she must be such a fool as

to believe the jnrl right, or defend her from a 
spirit of pure contradiction," whilst Sophia 
and her village friends observed, with not less 
acrimony, " that, as a person not devoid of 
religious light, her conduct in not entirely 
espousing the cause of her heavenly-minded 
sister, and imitating her conduct, bespoke 
a base and cowardly spirit, and the epithets 
of  worldly minded,' * self seeking,' 8bc. were 
applied to her continually." Even her friends 
at the Park called Emma a Trimmer ; but 
as the heads of the house differed themselves 
on the point at issue, they occasionally lis- 
tened to her reasons for looking fairly on both 
sides of the question ; and, in this reasoning, 
both were so far interested as never to push 
the other to extremities, a good effect of no 
small moment in the present excited state of 
feeling which had unhappily arisen in this 
community. 
Considering the altered state of his house- 
hold, Mr. Carysford enjoyed more peace than 
could have been expected ; for he was so 
entirely beloved, that neither servant nor 
visitor would mention any occurrence likely 
to grieve him, and even those of his people 
who most strenuously insisted on their right

to worship God their own way, observed also, 
that " considering he was a merely moral 
man, and a church parson, there was not 
much harm in him," and that now and then 
" he preached the gospel," but then, " he 
read his sermon, he read printed prayers, and 
of course it all sounded as a dead letter." 
The "new lisrhts " were after all but a 
sickly band ; and if Sophia, in all the radi- 
ance of her youth and beauty, the grace of 
her refined manners, and the redundancy of 
language easily attained amongst inferiors, 
had not strengthened their numbers and con- 
firmed their hopes, the young preachers sent 
from a distant academy would hardly have 
condescended to mount the tailor's great 
chair, and preach in his workroom. The 
grocer, the exciseman, the shopkeeper, all 
men qualified to harangue in the churchyard, 
not only held their usual council there, and 
obtained their usual auditors ; but the farmers, 
the blacksmith, the retired London tradesman, 
and the sunday-school teachers, were all warm- 
ed with zeal against the encroaches ; and soli- 
citous to show his Worship every possible 
mark of their good will, well aware that the 
Baronet would wink at a breach of the peace

on such an occasion, various plans had been 
laid for putting the preacher of the day in 
the stocks, or attempting a gentle ducking 
to his more open followers: but these mal- 
practices were so well known to be as contrary 
to the spirit as to the instructions of their 
pastor, that, for his sake, those they deemed 
his enemies were suffered to escape, and even 
to endeavour increasing their numbers and 
assuming a character of defiance. 
The love manifested, whether wisely or 
zealously, by his people, gave Mr. Carysford 
the comfort his long harassed spirit required, 
but it likewise subjected him to feeling too 
much. In every house, however poor the 
inhabitants, where he was recognized with 
affection, and where the memory of her so 
long and so fondly loved was held in honour, 
his heart had its resting-place as to its affec- 
tions, but the acuteness of his feelings forbade 
repose. In lamenting over his loss, in pro- 
testing their love, in railing against all who 
wished for change, in recalling the days of 
sorrow and the seasons of want, in which he 
had soothed their affliction and relieved their 
necessity, these simple souls necessarily 
awoke the chords of that sensibility which

MODERATION. 35 
was already touched too freely, and in the 
very prime of life, he withered like the sensi- 
tive plant beneath the approach of tender- 
ness itself. 
It had been constantly the practice of Mr. 
Carysford to catechise the children of his 
village, and to this good old custom it might 
chiefly be attributed that the encroachers upon 
his pastoral duties had been later in their 
advances to his parish than those in his 
neighbourhood, and that when arrived, their 
success was dubious. The young men and 
maidens (notwithstanding the love of change 
is natural to youth)were universally his friends, 
and from that period when they first deemed 
him insulted by the actual establishment of 
preaching during church hours, they were 
wont respectfully to edge nearer and nearer 
to him, till they became a kind of body- 
guard as he went from his own house to the 
church. The manner in which the silent 
sympathy and respect thus evinced, affected 
their minister, cannot be described, but will 
be conceived by those who have hearts and 
imaginations, and are accustomed to combine 
the purest emotions they originate, with those 
higher and sweeter sources of feeling, which

spring from devotion. Every broad honest 
face, that looked on him with reverent sym- 
pathy, was associated with the remembrance 
of his own children, their own fathers ; his 
pastoral duties, or his paternal cares. He 
knew that in days past he had for them 
"sighed and wept, watched and prayed," and 
the belief that according to their more bound- 
ed perceptions, they now returned his love, 
delighted, but yet affected him, beyond the 
power of his enfeebled frame to sustain. 
Emma sought to restrain this effect, and by 
recurring to common subjects, dull common 
places, or cheering trifles, to wean him from 
that consolation, which, whilst it sweetened, 
yet wasted the cup of life. She endeavoured 
to give him peculiar interest in the progn ss 
made by Charles, at college ; awaken him to 
the politics of the day, and more especially 
its poetry; she sought to engage him in writing 
/or Sophia's benefit, even with little hopes 
that in her present inflated state 1 of mind, she 
would condescend to read his documents, and 
by every means affection could suggest, or vi- 
gilance exact, prevented his mind from prey- 
ing on itself, or yielding up its energies to ami- 
able but useless paroxysms of excited feeling.

This was but a task the more necessary, 
because Harriet, when not engaged with hei 
aunt in company, found it obligatory in he 
to devote herself almost exclusively to he; 
comfort in private. Miss Tintagell was a 
woman of great talents, of noble and gene- 
rous nature, but of violent passions, and 
when grief or anger was uppermost, their 
operation was of so terrible a nature as to 
be alike injurious to herself, and harassing to 
those around her. She was offended with 
Sophia beyond measure, and much hurt with 
what she considered the mistaken lenity of 
her father, in reasoning when he should 
have commanded, and in permitting when 
she thought he should have denied; yet she 
could not bring herself to utter one reproach 
to a being so evidently suffering. Accus- 
tomed to shine in every circle where she 
appeared, if she accepted an invitation, the 
cares given alike to her person and her man- 
ners, rendered her for a few hours the com- 
manding or the fascinating woman of fa- 
shion, who could charm the elegant, and 
astonish the country circle around her; but 
when the spur of habit and the action of 
vanity ceased to operate, she would sit down

and bewail the loss of her sister as the one 
jewel that had shone on her path, with all the 
eloquence of grief, and even the simplicity 
of childlike fondness. 
Some months had passed in this manner, 
when it was proposed to Miss Tintagell, 
" that she should join a worthy couple to 
whom she was much attached in a visit to 
Paris," to which she consented with an avi- 
dity distressing to her eldest niece, who had 
begun to hope either that they should return 
to town together, or go to some watering 
place. The invitation could not be extend- 
ed to her without an entire derangement in 
the mode of conveyance ; in consequence of 
which, the elder lady did not choose to see 
the discontent evinced by the younger, and 
therefore poor Harriet, with all the dispo- 
sition in the world to exhibit her fine person 
in those circles from which she had been 
taken by distressing events, was condemned 
to accept the society which Ravenhill and 
its environs presented ; and console herself 
by becoming the mistress of the Rectory, 
though she was only partially the directress 
of its inhabitants.

CHAP. IV. 
Circumstances occurred soon after the 
departure of Miss Tintagell, which were of 
benefit to Mr. Carysford, by drawing him 
perforce to the common cares of life; they 
arose from the executorship of his sister's 
will, and the possession given to his son of 
the fortune of his mother, as already men- 
tioned. 
Miss Carysford had received five thousand 
pounds from her father, and a thousand 
more as the bequest of a relation. During 
the time she resided with her brother, their 
income was spent as a joint stock ; and when 
they parted, his sole care had been to deter 
her from injustice to herself, in which care 
his lady cordially united. The invalid found 
her income equal to her wants ; but as much 
medical aid was required by her health, and 
much charity craved by her heart, and as 
living was expensive even in the country, she

had nothing to spare. When however three 
or four years were passed, and each brought 
a new claimant on the beloved brother's purse 
when the boy was born who was to take 
so large a portion of the family property, or 
perhaps the whole of it; and when the mo- 
ther of this family had experienced such at 
tacks as to create alarm for her life, Miss 
Carysford began to consider seriously the 
future situation of her nieces. 
" It is probable," said she, " that I shall 
die whilst these children are young, therefore 
that which / can give them will be of more 
importance than the ampler provision of their 
richer aunt ; whose situation and habits I 
well know preclude her from saving any 
thing at present. Let me consider how I 
can do my share toward providing lor the 
future." 
The plan was laid and acted upon, al- 
though several of the intended legat< es were 
otherways provided for; but in consequence, 
M iss Carysford had the satisfaction of leaving 
each of her nieces fifteen hundred pounds, 
(there being four at the time of her death,) 
an extra thousand to Emma as her erod-daugb- 
ter, and provision to the old servant and her

daughter, who had been her faithful attendants 
ever since she left the Rectory, not forgetting 
a bequest to her nephew, as an aid to his col- 
lege expenses, on which he had just entered 
at the time when her weary pilgrimage closed. 
The share of Alathea being divided amongst 
the three sisters, they each had an income of 
one hundred per annum, the principal being- 
paid to each on her becoming of age; and 
Harriet therefore now received her portion, 
Emma was joined in the trust, and appointed 
residuary legatee, an honour which gained 
her no good will from Harriet, who without 
caring for money was envious of importance; 
and who finding even the additional income 
of which she had taken possession insufficient 
for her wants, would have been glad to know 
that Emma had it in her power to assist her. 
Trusting that the reader is now acquainted 
with the family of the Rector, that they can 
even pourtray his tall, slender, and slightly 
bending form, as he listens to that aged 
woman, who brings him new-laid eggs, un- 
der the full persuasion that no others in the 
parish can be found so good for him, and 
whose very heart would be broken if she were 
paid for them, we will return to our narra-

tivc. It will be remembered that Sophia, was 
set out on one of her errands of charity and 
instruction, and her father's steps, though 
differently directed, had probably the same 
end in view. Harriet was too much busied 
with counteracting schemes, to the announced 
desire of her father respecting the carriage, 
to enter either upon a drive or a walk, and 
Emma has set out to call on the family 
of the Wilmington's. 
Many persons might pass Emma, dressed 
as she still was in slight mourning, without re- 
marking any thing beyond that of a lady- 
like young woman somewhat above the com- 
mon height, or should they see her face be- 
neath the large bonnet, say more than that 
" she appealed pretty and modest." She could 
neither boast the air of fashion which dis- 
tinguished Harriet, who was called the beauty 
of the family par excellence, nor had she that 
dazzling fairness and aerial slightness of form, 
which gave Sophia, in the eyes of many, still 
higher pretensions ; but her features were 
beautifully regular, and more especially her 
month possessed a character of sweetness 
and placidity, which displayed the charm of 
a smile without its character. Iler prcten-

sions to beauty were forgotten in the ex- 
pression of goodness, written in every linea- 
ment of her countenance, and although it was 
also full of intellectual expression, the sense 
of its intelligence was lost in that of its be- 
nignity. 
No wonder, then, that both Mr. and Mrs. 
Wilmington met her as she entered the 
garden which led to their abode with warm 
greetings, which dispelled for a time the 
furrows which past sorrows and present soli- 
citude had planted on their own faces  mis- 
taking, because hoping that there was some 
further cause for the pleasure they evinced, 
she cast her eye around the room, and per- 
ceiving that no person was present, enquired 
" if they had received any letter, or were by 
any circumstance relieved from the trouble 
they revealed to her the preceding Monday." 
" Oh! no, my dear," replied Mr. Wilming- 
ton with a deep sigh, " we are only that much 
nearer to the evil which we daily apprehend  
money is at this period so exceedingly scarce 
we cannot obtain it, so the little estate which 
is our dear Frank's all at present, must go to 
pay that debt which he contracted to aid his 
distressed parents  in these terrible times,

with a forced sale, it will probably not fetch 
a thousand pounds beyond the twelve hundred 
for which it is mortgaged, though worth twice 
as much." 
" 1 would not mind that," added the wife, 
" for his commission is equal to his support, 
but I well know my brother will never for- 
give the transaction ; and when he comes 
from India, although he has permitted us to 
consider Frank his heir, he will abandon him 
altogether  could we conceal it  and to no 
human being save you have we spoken of it." 
" 'Tis that unhappy necessity of secrecy," 
interrupted the husband, " which constitutes 
much of the misfortune,  but we cannot 
mention it ; if Maria, who is returned to us a 
widow with a babe, were to know it, she 
would either leave us, or remaining, would 
break her heart ; and Letitia, who is so deli- 
cate, poor thing, would be overwhelmed with 
it ; and Harry, who is struiriilinLr so hard to 
get forward at college, (though he little 
dreams how much difficulty we have to sup- 
port him there, poor fellow,) if he knew of it, 
would never be able to pursue his studies, so 
thai tin affair must take its course  the law- 
yer must foreclose."

" I don't know what that is," said Emma, 
" but as I shall be able to lend you twelve 
hundred pounds in three months and a fort- 
night, I find, and I have some property even 
now in my hands, surely it might be con- 
trived,  if I were to give my word to the 
lawyer, would he not wait awhile?" 
" Unquestionably !" said Mr. Wilmington, 
with eagerness, " but have you spoken to 
your father, my dear ?" 
" How could I when you so charged me 
not to do it ? besides, he has so much to think 
of, and would suffer so much from sympathy, 
at a time when he is dreadfully unnerved, 
that I had rather not trouble him ; but if I 
can write, or speak, so as to satisfy Mr. 
Parkinson, and afterwards produce the money, 
(which I find will be the case,) all will, 1 
trust, come round." 
Mrs. Wilmington burst into tears of joy- 
ful gratitude, and flung herself into Emma's 
arms. 
" But my dear Emma, I cannot accept this 
kind offer without desiring that you should 
make one confidant in your family ; Miss 
Carysford is three years older than you, she 
was always attached to Maria, and will feel

for us all, so much as to preserve silence on 
the subject ; at the same time she will assist 
you in the affair as one of business, your bro- 
ther is at a distance, and is too vouncr a man 
to know much about the matter  however, 
consult which you please," said the husband. 
"I have considered the matter thoroughly, 
and determined how to act; but I will cer- 
tainly fulfil your wishes, and pray put me in 
the way now for relieving your spirits, surely 
I can write immediately." 
But Mr. Wilmington was a man of delicacy 
and honour, and though conscious that the 
loan so advantageous to him, or rather his son, 
could not be injurious to the lender, he re- 
fused accepting from her any written promise, 
until the communication spoken of was made 
to her sister, and Emma departed with the 
satisfaction of having communicated hope 
and comfort to those she loved, but in great 
fear (without precisely knowing why) of op- 
position from Harriet, whom she yet knew 
to be of a generous nature, and warmly at- 
tached to the family in question. 
Mr. Wilmington was (or rather had been) a 
country gentleman of handsome property and 
ancient family, whose estate lying in Staf-

fordshire, where that country is most com- 
mercial, had been tempted to embark a sum 
of money in an extensive manufactory, as the 
means of providing better for his younger 
children, a speculation which he had seen 
successfully adopted by other persons simi- 
larly situated. This was the more excusable 
in him perhaps, from the sudden increase of 
wealth in the district he inhabited, from his 
warm and tender attachment to a most ami- 
able wife, and a numerous family, whom he 
naturally desired to see in possession of those 
comforts, and holding that rank in society 
long filled by his progenitors, and now en- 
croached upon by a new and purse-proud 
race. 
The consequence will be easily forestalled 
bv those who have seen the distress, to 
which the want of a mere trifle subjected 
him in his present state. The house he had 
joined failed, and his estate was forfeited for 
debts of which he was ignorant, and the join 
ture of his wife was all that remained at a 
period when the wants of his family were 
most felt. His eldest daughter was also new- 
ly married to one of the sons of the prin- 
cipal partner, who being totally ignorant of

die real stale of his father's affairs, and as- 
tounded by the universal ruin, lost reason and 
life in the shock, leaving his widow and or- 
phan to increase the burden of that ruined 
home to which she returned. 
Mrs. Wilmington had brought her husband 
a small fortune, to which he had considerably 
added in her settlement, but it yet produced 
a very inadequate maintenance for a large 
family, and he therefore wisely sought to im- 
prove it by applying the knowledge of agri- 
culture he had attained as an amusement, 
to purposes of gain. Tor this end he took a 
farm in the neighbourhood of Ravenhill, 
which he was enabled to stock from the 
circumstance of his eldest son becoming the 
possessor of a little estate, bequeathed dur- 
ing his infancy by his maternal uncle, the 
proceeds of which had during his minority 
accumulated to a sum, which at the same time 
purchased him a commission, with the addi- 
tion of the loan in question. 
Mrs. Wilmington had another brother who 
had been many years resident in the East 
Indies, accumulated a large fortune there,

deration, until the period of her misfortunes; 
after which his letters or rather lectures were 
longer, but his presents smaller, and he ap- 
peared to forget all his little nephews and 
nieces, save the one who held the house where 
he was born, and to which he attached there- 
fore a sense of consequence, and probably of 
affection. She had therefore every reason to 
believe that the loss of it would be ruin to 
the hopes of the family in that quarter, and far 
removed from all their former friends, intimate 
only with the Rector in their present abode, 
since they could not consistently cultivate 
an acquaintance at the Park, the distress of 
their situation became extreme. Either they 
must irreparably injure the amiable son who 
had befriended them, or by a hasty and inju-

selves and all their family without a home, 
and in so doing equally offend the Eastern 
despot whose return they now looked for, and 
who had so regularly insisted upon it as his 
principle, "not to help those who did not 
help themselves," that they were certain if 
he found them in poverty, he would abandon 
them wholly.

it presented, and the distress she had herself 
witnessed, Emma dilated on her return, adding 
her intention of applying the first money 
she was mistress of to their relief, and in- 
directly enquiring if Harriet could not enable 
her to do it now. 
" You will lose it every shilling," was the 
abrupt answer given to the announced in- 
tention. 
" Why do you think so, my dear?  they 
are very honourable people  people of un- 
blemished integrity." 
" But they are very unlucky people  very 
foolish people, or they would not have been 
ruined at first ; besides, we all know misfor- 
tunes follow each other, and it would be very 
foolish in you to attempt checking them, 
especially at the very time when, from my 
father's account of things, charity should 
begin at home." 
" I am perfectly willing to appropriate all 
the fortune I shall enjoy to my dear father's 
use. Suppose, dear Harriet, you and I should 
offer to keep the carriage : it will enable him 
to lay by the sum on which he has fixed, and 
prevent us from exciting comments orexpe-

riencing inconvenience. Of course Sophia 
in due time will contribute her share." 
" No, she will give all she has, or ever will 
have, to chapel building ; I know she stands 
engaged by promises.  That a girl of her 
description should do so might be expected, 
but that you should throw away your pro- 
perty in such a manner, is absolutely asto- 
nishing." 
" I have thrown away nothing ; I have 
merely promised to lend money at legal in- 
terest  at the worst I can only lose a trifle, 
to which the family at the Grange are hear- 
tily welcome ; if I could afford it, I would 
give, not lend, them the whole, but that is out 
of the question." 
" Well, well, do as you please  I have 
warned you ; the money will do them no 
good, and T consider it as gone for ever if 
you place it there. I think too, there is a 
gross indelicacy in your stepping forward to 
assist a young officer, for what else can you 
call the matter? It is suing for attention 
from Frank Wilmington ; had vou done anv 
thing for the widow, it had been one thing, 
but the young man is another."

" I never saw young Wilmington but 
once," replied Emma, blushing. 
" So much the worse, since it is evident he 
made a great impression. I believe girls in 
the country are very subject to these things, 
much given to falling in love." 
The ruddy hues of anger at this moment 
displaced the more gentle confusion that suf- 
fused the cheek of Emma, but she did not 
answer. Retiring to her own chamber, she 
endeavoured to reconsider the whole affair. 
The great esteem in which she knew her 
parents had long held the Wilmingtons, the 
remembrance of all the kindness she had ex- 
perienced from them during the long sick- 
nesses which had afflicted their house, and 
the conscionsneiA that probably, even at this 
moment, her father was chatting with them, 
losing the sense of his own cares, and kept 
(from the purest motives) in happy igno- 
rance of theirs, determined her to persist in 
her intentions, and preserve them from the 
pain of knowing her sister's sentiments. She 
felt that this was one of those important hours 
in life, when the power of doing a great good, 
or what she deemed paying a debt of grati- 
tude, was presented, which, as a friend and

a christian, ought to be embraced ; and, 
since she felt within herself the power to en- 
dure the loss uncomplainingly, should it 
prove one, and even in silence obviate its ap- 
pearance to every person, save Harriet, the 
matter was decided, and her offers renewed 
by letter in the most unequivocal manner. 
When this was done, Emma enquired of 
her own heart, " if it were possible, that upon 
so slight an acquaintance, she had really felt 
that predilection for Lieutenant Wilmington 
which Harriet asserted." She remarked him 
as a tall, graceful young man, three years 
before, of lively manners, but it was certain 
that if she liked him, it was through the 
letters she had heard read from him by his 
mother, and the fond descriptions given of 
his amiable qualities by his father and sisters 
" No," said she, at length, " I am not the 
foolish, romantic creature Harriet thinks 
me ; nor have I any interest in the welfare of 
the family but that of the esteem and affec- 
tion they so justly merit from us all." 
Yet notwithstanding this silent assertion, 
when, through her solicitation and eventual 
assistance, the family were restored evidently 
to that happiness which had been from some

unknown cause disturbed  when the fund 
mother poured her feelings and those of her 
relieved son into her ear, vaticinating future 
prosperity and felicity as the gift of their 
young friend ; the ear of Emma lingered, and 
her colour rose at the mention of a name 
associated in her mind with those virtues 
most dear to her heart. In the power of me- 
ditation on any prevalent idea given by the 
retirement of the country, especially when a 
pensive disposition and contemplative turn 
has been given to a young imaginative per- 
son, such a predilection will often give colour 
to their future life. Emma's disposition from 
nature laid her peculiarly open to the plea- 
sures and pains connected with high-raised 
expectations, sanguine hopes, and that beau- 
ideal of existence which, while it strews the 
opening path of life with roses, so often pre- 
pares thorns for its advancing years. She 
had the credulity which is inseparable from 
guilelessness, and that trust in others which 
is natural to integrity ; and with these qua- 
lities as a ground-work for favourable opi- 
nion, it cannot therefore be surprising if the 
busy fancy stole forth from its long de- 
pression to diversify life by decorating with

every virtue and every acquirement, one ne- 
cessarily so often present to memory. 
It was perhaps happy for Emma, though 
by no means agreeable, that Harriet, by her 
inuendos from time to time, alarmed her with 
expressions calculated to excite watchfulness 
over her own inclinations, and that the obser- 
vations of Sophia on the doctrine of original 
sin, drew back her mind to that necessity for 
moderating our wishes and opinions, as well 
as our passions, which had so often formed 
the lessons of her early life. She determined 
on guarding herself from thinking too much, 
seeing that one subject was generally upper- 
most in her thoughts, and to give more of her 
time to the pursuits of her sisters, or corres- 
pondence with her brother. 
The leisure of late afforded to Emma 
during the summer months now passing, had 
arisen from the improvement visible in her 
father's health and spirits, which appeared to 
those around him the natural effect of time, 
and the attainment of resignation by an in- 
creased exercise of faith, as evinced by renew- 
ed zeal and activity in his ministerial duties. 
That such causes produced a most beneficial 
effect upon him cannot be in the least doubt-

cd, but the season of the year had also a great 
share in the apparent ehange, it being not too 
hot for him to be almost constantly out of doors, 
either meditating on the beauties of nature 
and the goodness of God, in those bounteous 
gifts so conspicuous in all around him, or else 
talking with his parishioners in the hay-fields 
and gardens, visiting the ailing, and aiding 
his curate by instructing the young. Whilst 
thus employed he appeared almost well, and 
almost happy ; but even now the return from 
his long ramble never failed to be painful, 
and thence it was delayed. He would not 
unfrequently yield to the intreaties of the 
Baronet to dine with them, or sit down, still 
more frequently, to the frugal but inviting

escape the hour when he was wont to be 
met in the walnut-tree walk, by the wife who 
never ceased to gaze on him with delight, 
and the lovely infant whose arms were wont 
to twine around his knees. That here he 
was still constantly met, still fondly welcomed, 
his heart was thankful to heaven, but the 
possession of the blessing left, reminded him 
of the blessing taken ; reminded him too that

loss, was estranged from him, and held him 
as an "unbelieving parent." 
It had been the pleasure of Harriet during 
this time, to exhibit her fine figure on horse- 
back daily, which she had done with great 
effect upon a beautiful mare, the gift of her 
brother, who, with all the generosity to be 
expected, repelled the idea of any change 
taking place in his father's expenses, in 
consequence of what he called " a nominal 
acquisition," though it was also evident, that 
his expenses personally were commensurate 
with his fortune. During the vacation be 
had been sometimes at home, at others paid 
flying visits to the nearest sea-bathing towns, 
but in August he became suddenly rooted to 
the Rectory, and declared " that he would 
not leave it till the last day of the vacation." 
This sage resolution, albeit ascribed to the 
necessity of studying the mathematics, had 
its origin in the arrival of Lady Lyster's or- 
phan niece, the only child of that brother 
whose marriage and departure for India we 
formerly noticed. She had been educated in 
England, and seen as a child by the Carys- 
ford family, but having returned to India,

t where she did not find either parent alive to 
receive her,) she now came to the Park as her 
future home, from that distant bourne, under 
ill the interesting circumstances belonging to 
her as an orphan, a traveller, and an heiress, 
the admired Eulalie Mortimer. 
Charles thought her the most lovely crea- 
ture he had ever beheld, though it is certain 
she did not possess as much beauty as any one 
of his own sisters ; but he was right in consi- 
dering her charming. Eulalie was the daugh- 
ter of a Spanish lady, and inherited from 
her the liquid lustre which gives the dark eyes 
of the olive beauty that mingled charm of 
softness and sprightliness, peculiarly capti- 
vating; her figure, though petite, was elegant, 
her motion graceful yet lively, for she had 
resided too little in the land of her birth to 
suffer from the climate, or imbibe the habits 
of indolence ascribed to its influence. Warm, 
enthusiastic, generous, and inconsiderate, she 
was the most delightful of all creatures in her 
uncle s house, which beneath her influence 
re-awoke to that gaiety, impaired of course by 
the hand of time, and the sober influence of 
that mild autumn into which the Baronet and 
his Lady had entered, and the whole neigh-

bourhood soon re-echoed her praise, and 
pressed forward to partake her society. 
All our readers acquainted with country 
society are well aware of the importance of 
such a stranger, when launched on a surface 
capable of expanding the circle of its plea- 
sures. In a very short time, the calls and in- 
vitations to the Park from families hitherto ap- 
parently shut out by distance, or by less agree- 
able causes, were innumerable, and these en- 
gagements generally began or ended with 
the Rectory also, for as it was the business of 
Harriet's life to mingle in all parties which 
she thought worthy her presence, and offer 
unbounded hospitality to all who chose to 
partake it, and as Charles lived more at the 
Park than at home, the two families were 
seldom disunited in the plans laid for their 
amusement. It did not follow in the opinion 
of the neighbouring gentry, that a matrimo- 
nial union between them would arise from the 
intercourse they witnessed ; for it was well 
known that the children at the Rectory had 
always been held very dear at the Park, and 
that their society could not fail to be especi- 
ally pleasant to the fair stranger; of course

the field was open to other aspirants besides 
our young collegian. 
In tins time of general bustle and gaiety, 
the Wilmington family obtained consider- 
able attention, to the great satisfaction of the 
Rector, who had often lamented that ele- 
gant young women, born to such different 
prospects, and for a certain period devoted to 
elegant accomplishments, should be doomed 
to an obscurity which forbade the hope of 
their emerging beyond it. Miss Mortimer 
was well acquainted with Mr. Thurlestonc, 
the brother of Mrs Wilmington, in India, he 
having something to do in the settlement of 
her father's affairs, and she brought letters 
from him to the family, which announced, 
as before, an intention of returning soon, and 
a strong desire to see his nephew. In conse- 
quence, invitations were given this family to 
the Park, which were wisely and sparingly 
accepted, as were those to the Rectory also, 
now it became the resort of large parties  
but these, together with the fair Eulalie's 
reports of their uncle's wealth, raised them 
into speedy consideration in the neighbour- 
hood.

Hitherto Miss Carysford had reigned the 
sole queen of beauty and fashion in her na- 
tive land, at those periods when circum- 
stances had allowed her to adorn a private 
party, or a public assembly ; but although 
confessed to be handsomer than ever, and 
arrayed in that style of peculiar elegance her 
present correspondence with her aunt in 
Paris enabled her to adopt, such is the love 
for novelty, or the respect for wealth, that 
the stranger every where met with more at- 
tention. Not brooking neglect, or aiming 
at triumph, Harriet left no medium untried 
to carry the palm in one shape or other ; her 
dress rivalled the splendour of Eulalie's east- 
ern habiliments, and her table vied with that 
of the Baronet in the rarity, if not the mul- 
titude, of its dishes ; and the knowledge ac- 
quired in London of those elegances peculiar 
to the accomplished gourmand, and that dis- 
play of ornament adopted by the fashionable, 
was exhibited by her with much more libera- 
lity than good sense. 
Mr. Carysford by tacit consent and fre- 
quent absence, left every thing to the ma- 
nagement of his children ; proud of his son, 
and pleased with the company that son had

brought to his house, conscious that a long 
blight had been cast over the young people, 
and fully persuaded that as his son had (what 
he deemed) a noble income, he doubted not 
but it would supply all those expenses which 
he considered as adopted for his sake tempo- 
rarily, and therefore all things went on 
smoothly, so far as regarded him. Emma 
could not be thus tranquil, yet she would 
neither agitate him by her fears, nor awaken 
the anger of Harriet by her remonstrances, 
but every day by every mode of vigilance 
she could adopt, and by gentle persuasion to 
both brother and sister, she stemmed the 
current of extravagance into which ambition 
and thoughtlessness had plunged them. 
In this effort she was assisted by the steady- 
conduct of the Wilmingtons, who made no 
change in the quiet tenor or active industry 
of their lives, until the somewhat unexpected 
arrival of their eldest son in consequence of 
his promotion. Emma felt her bosom palpitate 
when his arrival was announced by Charles, 
and on his proposing to her to walk over with 
him and call on the family by way of welcome 
to the stranger, and invitation to all, she de- 
clined it for the express purpose of schooling

her heart, and examining its movements more 
closely. 
" I will ride with you," said Harriet, " for I 
want to see our pretty widow. I feel assured 
she has made a conquest of Major Cleve- 
land, and I mean to rally her upon it. I 
think your College friend Johnson too was 
much struck with Letitia." 
" Not half so much," returned Charles, 
" as Le Clair was with Emma, he has indeed 
left us quite in despair on her account,  
how could you, Emma, by the way, be so 
cruelly cold to a man of his pretensions ? he 
is the heir to a Baronetcy, and the possessor 
of a thousand good qualities." 
" I have no pretensions to half so many 
good things," said Emma with a gentle smile. 
" Her time is not yet come for imbibing 
the influenza so prevalent in our circle. 
Falling in love is a disorder remarkably 
infectious among us at present, ever since 
you set the example, Charles, and in my 
opinion Emma shows great prudence in keep- 
ing out of temptation. Whether she will 
continue to do it will be seen." 
This was the last insinuation of this nature 
Emma was teazed with ; on the contrary,

Harriet appeared kind and considerate, in the 
arrangements she had made on her return; 
and when Captain Wilmington visited at the 
Rectory, he was received by Emma, without 
the confusion she had dreaded in herself. 
She found the power of self-government in 
this respect as well as others, and earnestly 
endeavoured to preserve it. 
Yet in every succeeding interview, she saw 
something in her eyes more agreeable in 
Captain Wilmington than any other gentle- 
man in the party ; something that, combined 
with the constant disinterestedness he had 
evinced towards his family, and the kindness 
of his manners, would have justified her to 
herself, if her partiality had hern warranted 
by any indications of love on his part. 
Knowing his situation, she coidd not help 
feeling anxiety for him, lest in the circle he 
now joined, his expenses should be increased 
beyond his powers, or that his hopes from his 
uncle should be more sanguine, than so 
singular and illiberal a character as that per- 
son bore, would justify ; and often did she for 
his sake wish that Charles was again in 
Cambridge, that Eulalie and Harriet would 
cease to be rival queens, and that in more

sober scenes, she might be enabled to read 
calmly the principles and the attainments of 
one, in whom she certainly was deeply in- 
terested, as a friend at least. 
The consciousness she had of having be- 
friended him, rendered it impossible for a 
person, so delicate as Emma, to say one of the 
many things which often rose to her mind, 
when parties of pleasure were formed or pur- 
chases proposed, which she considered likely 
to implicate him in expense on the one hand, 
or mortify him on the other ; and her dread 
of having her solicitude misconstrued by 
Harriet, prevented her from making observa- 
tion or remonstrance to her on such subjects. 
Yet there were moments when she was nearly 
doinsr so, for it was certain that Frank Wil- 
mington always approached her with the 
same brotherly ease, and perfect reliance on 
her judgment, the same sense of her kindness, 
and lively gratitude for it, which so evidently 
affected his sisters ; and Harriet was herself 
so pleasant with him, so affable and un- 
assuming in her conversation, that although 
she would not listen to remonstrance on her 
own plans, perhaps she would consider the 
expenses of others.

Once, and only once, had Captain AVil- 
mington in her presence referred to his 
uncle's partiality for the place of his birth, 
and hinted the irreparable breach that part- 
ing with it would have made between them. 
Emma coloured deeply, and w r ould have said, 
" she was glad there had been no necessity 
for doing so," but Harriet relieved her by 
adroitly changing the subject to that of So- 
phia's peculiarities, which had lately added 
to singular manners the adoption of a dress 
so nearly resembling the Quakers, that Cap- 
tain Wilmington believed she had united 
herself to that body. 
" No, no," cried Harriet, " Sophia has not 
half the respectability attached in my opi- 
nion to the ' yea and nay' body of friends. 
She is a kind of nondescript, lor she pro- 
claims herself a sound church-woman, but 
herds only with the dissenters, and affects 
airs of patience when I call her a Methodist, 
though she is so recognized every where of 
course. Charles calls her ' Evangelical,' and 
he says, that at Cambridge, young ladies of 
her persuasion are notorious for fastening

into matrimony ; so pray have a due care of

Saint Sophy, for in despite of her quaint cap 
and handkerchief, she is certainly the prettiest 
girl in the neighbourhood." 
The Captain was too gallant not to set 
aside the last assertion in favour of the 
speaker, whilst he lamented in much stronger 
terms than the case called for, in Emma's 
opinion, the superstition and enthusiasm of 
Sophia, which he said, " would be the ruin 
of her, poor thing." 
" So far as Sophia's affections have been 
weaned from her family, in consequence of 
believing even her father to be deficient in 
his duties, and wrong in his views  so far 
as she has divided a house, and assisted to 
divide a parish against itself, her conduct has 
been reprehensible, and much to be lamented ; 
but she is very sincere and very affectionate. 
The bias given to her mind is too strong, and 
acts at present not less upon her vanity than 
her conscience, but in time she will see her 
errors and abandon them, without, I trust, 
losing her sense of the importance of religion 
as a motive of action, the great guide and 
comfort of existence." 
To this softening speech from Emma there 
was little reply made ; but there was a look

indicative of carelessness in him, and a flip- 
pancy in handling the most serious of all 
subjects, which was very painful to her. She 
often felt as if she were allied in mind to no 
one around her, much as she loved them all, 
except her father, and perhaps it was that 
sensation, more than any other, which had 
given her a kind of imaginary tie to Captain 
Wilmington. She thought now, that even 
this was, or ought to be, dissolved ; she 
thought also that considering how very high 
Harriet had always held herself, how much 
she had lately increased her expenses and her 
connections, that it was extraordinary that 
she gave so much time and attention to a 
person in this gentleman's situation, and that, 
in speaking of Sophia, certain looks between 
them proved that they were perfectly alike in 
their opinions.

Although Emma's character was distinct 
from that of all the young people by whom 
she was surrounded, yet her gentle manners, 
her kindness, and the discovery, which, from 
time to time, each made of the soundness of 
her understanding, induced them all to seek 
in her a consoling friend, or an able adviser  
they loved her for being the first, and (gene- 
rally speaking) quarrelled with her for being 
the last. Charles had made her the confi- 
dante of his passion for Eulalie, but he had 
not taken her advice against premature de- 
claration, although the modesty of his nature 
and the timidity inseparable from a passion 
that exalts its object so highly, had delayed 
it; when however he was about to leave her, 
all scruples vanished, and she was informed 
of that which herself and every other person 
had known for the last three months, quite as 
well as the speaker.

Eulalie, in the course of all that time, 
though she had ran about the country in all 
directions, figured as a blazing comet, at 
race balls, a passing meteor in sea-coast pro- 
menades, and a fixed star at the county town 
assemblies, had not seen one man, strictly 
speaking, so handsome as Charles Carysford, 
who inherited a fine person as a birth-right; 
he was evidently good tempered, what she 
called " very generous, and very genteel ;" 
rode well, shot well, and what was more, 
talked well, and listened well ; for his mind 
was cultivated and his manners suasive  -but 
then he had one great drawback  " he was 
not a soldier." 
With this unhappy deficiency before her 
eyes, Eulalie, though she looked tenderl v, 
durst not trust her tongue with expressing 
her sentiments, which were indeed somewhat 
inexplicable to herself. She retired hastily, 
yet not angrily, from the gaze of the idolizing 
youth, who could only conclude from her 
manners that she was well inclined towards 
him, but really feared to encourage him, lest 
she should meet the displeasure of her friends. 
As this denouement took place in the gardens 
of the Park, after a short reverie he determined

not to re-enter a house which of course he 
deemed the abode of his cruel enemies, but 
by a little circuit regain his horse from the 
stable, return, and lay the case before Emma. 
" 'Tis true, she will not be so angry as I 
am sure Harriet would be, for she always 
maintains that our family on one side at 
least is superior to Sir Marmaduke's  if my 
grandfather Carysford ivas a merchant, so was 
Eulalie's grandfather, old Don something, I 
remember." 
Charles's meditations were most happily 
broken upon at this moment (though not so 
in his opinion) by meeting Sophia, who was 
going to instruct a little band of children, 
whom she termed, " her own lambs," to dis- 
tinguish them from the more extensive flock 
patronized by Lady Lyster and her sisters, 
over whom Emma cast a kind and scruti- 
nizing eve. Though Charles laughed at So- 
ohia sometimes, and scolded her at others, 
he yet loved her very much at the bottom, 
and, by way of saying something, he en- 
quired " if she had left her sisters at home?" 
" I have ;  Harriet has got a new im- 
portation from Vanity Fair, in the modern 
Babel."

"" Then she has got letters from my aunt. 
[ wish, with all my heart, the Honourable 
Alathea Tintagell was here." 
Charles articulated every syllabic in refer- 
ence to his own feelings, which at this moment 
sought for all possible aids in conquering tin 
difficulties before him, but as Sophia under- 
stood him literally, and was sorry to hear him 
lay stress on a vain earthly distinction, she 
replied solemnly, 
" Yes, she has heard from our aunt, who 
has been induced to renew, or I ought to say 
commence, an acquaintance with her nephew, 
who is now at Nice for his health  doubtless 
he has been brought to the brink of the crrave 
Dv dissolute courses, and ouirht to be a warn- 
rag to us all." 
Charles nodded his thanks, pricked his 
steed, and was at home in a few minutes; 
but his motions had not been so rapid as those 
fEulalie who was at this time closetted with 
Emma, to whom she had flown on leaving 
Charles, and as the ride was more than double 
the length of the walk, between the Rectory 
trad the Park, her priority of confidence was 
easily accounted for. 
"Nothing can be more distressing than

Charles's declaration, " I have long foreseen

trouble." 
" From all I have observed, my dear Miss 
Mortimer, I cannot believe you dislike my 
brother." 
" Oh ! no, no, no, who could dislike so 
handsome, so amiable, so excellent"  Eulalie 
wept, or sobbed at least. 
" Then you apprehend opposition from the 
Baronet, and " " Opposition !" cried the fair 
mourner, suddenly relinquishing her handker- 
chief, springing on her feet, and rising to 
(he utmost height her bounded measurement 
allowed. "Who shall dare to oppose me? 
No, thank heaven, I am free, nor shall any 
sordid motive ever influence me to yield my 
risfht of choice to another  never, never." 
" Certainly the reasons our friends may 
offer, should be considered in a matter of 
so much importance; we ought to weigh 
every point, to"

ruined, undone lor ever, and I shall be the 
cause of all." 
" Dear Eulalie, what can you mean ?" 
" Emma, ever since I can remember any 
thing, fame and glory have been the great 
objects of* my desire. I believe reading 
Joan d'Arc inspired the notion  when other 
girls talked of shepherds or beaux', 1 talked 
of soldiers and heroes. I am myself cou 
rageous, and therefore courage in others is 
the quality most valued by me, and I well 
remember preferring the boatswain in the

duel? I know no situation so much on earth 
to be envied, as the widowhood of one whose 
husband perished in the field of battle  ah ! 
what emotions, Emma, must fill her heart, as 
she gazes on the monument which his 
country has erected to his honour, when she 
reflects that a being so great, so glorious, 
was once devoted to her. Now were I to 
marry dear Charles, this happy, this envied 
lot could never be mine  the idea of marry- 
ing a clergyman is insupportable to me." 
" What a misfortune it is that you were 
not born a few years sooner ; but as peace 
appears now established on a firm basis, 
either you must resign this object of desire, 
or determine to lead a single life, for you have 
little chance of being the widow of a military 
hero for many years, in this country at 
least." 
" Do you then think that Charles does 
not love me well enough to resign his inten- 
tion of going into the church?" 
"Indeed I fear that he does, but such a 
determination would exceedingly grieve my 
father, who has educated him from childhood 
with this view, and also, I apprehend, be 
deemed one of great imprudence by all your

" Oh ! I care not for money matters, I 
don't indeed." 
" Yet yon love to spend it  you have in 
fact never known the want of it, and there- 
fore cannot judge; and for your consolation 
I can assure you that Charles has given prool 
of great personal courage in Cambridge se- 
veral times, that my father was once so nearly 
falling a victim to his courage by facing a 
mob, my mother had every chance for a very 
long widowhood, so that, even as a clergy- 
man's wife, there is no saying but you may 
enjoy that satisfaction." 
" Satisfaction it could not be, but in such 
a case it would surely be the purest con- 
solation  you must think so yourself, 
inina.

honour of being * an ambassador from Christ 
to them'  besides, I do really think, that no 
men living have so much need of courage in 
its highest sense as the clergy, especially 
whilst they are young." 
" I can't see that at all  to be sure they 
have a good many examinations and non- 
sense to go through, and at the first they look 
foolish and feel awkward on reading in pub- 
lic, but that soon goes off." 
" They have to encounter pretty universal 
prejudice, and to meet it with weapons so 
little in use, that the wounds they may re-

he has been under particular circumstances

that his uncle, Lord Alfreton, is very ill ;

portance, I am naturally too partial to be a 
fair judge, and although I firmly believe that 
my dear mother was the happiest of married 
women, for so she has often assured me, yet 
I can see clearly that every year increases the 
difficulties of which I have spoken : as a 
friend, I would advise you to examine them 
thoroughly before you consent to favour his 
hopes." 
Eulalie promised she would consider, but 
she blushed deeply, and the tears were in her 
beautiful eyes as she spoke, for she knew in 
her heart that she had decided. The idea of 
contending with difficulty, however presented 
to her mind, accorded with the ardour and 
enthusiasm of her spirit, whilst that of 
Charles, in a state of suffering, awoke all the 
tenderness she had long: cherished towards 
him. Emma accompanied her towards the 
walnut-trees on her way homewards, when 
perceiving Charles was sate under one of 
them, looking anxiously towards the house, 
she beckoned him, and recounnended him to 
be Miss Mortimer's escort, but not till she

her wish that he should relinquish his pro-

fcssion, which she candidly owned lay (as 
she believed) in Eulalie's power of guidance. 
" I have no longer such a wish," said the 
heiress, as she accepted the arm of her lover 
and departed. 
On the day following Charles departed 
also, for he had already encroached much on 
October, and for the following week there 
was a wonderful stillness in the house, which 
was rendered more striking by the severity of 
the weather, which confined Mr. Carysford 
altogether to home, as he laboured under a 
severe cold caught by leaving his bed at an 
unusual hour in the morning, to baptize a sick 
child at some distance. 
In point of fact, he had been for a long 
time in a delicate state of health, and the 
very relief he had experienced during the 
summer months, in the open air, only proved 
that some disorganization of the system called 
for extraordinary assistance. On the present 
occasion confinement and abstinence were re- 
commended as positively necessary, and there- 
fore submitted to, but the former was very 
unpalatable, and the latter it was difficult 
to act upon, for he was at all times so tern-

perate, that an increase of self-denial nearly 
amounted to starvation. 
Harriet, being now in possession of 
Charles's secret, and not a little elated with 
the prospect of her brother's succession to 
Lord Alfreton's estate, a circumstance on 
which she dilated beyond her right of doing, 
in order (as she said) " to make all smooth 
with Lady Lyster," spent little time at home ; 
but Emma never left it when her father's 
comforts could be aided by her attention, or 
his pleasures increased by her society. At 
this period, it being 18 16, the general state 
of the country called for the attention of 
every person who could assist the poor, on 
whom in many districts the winter opened 
with an accumulation of hardships. Mr. 
Carysford knew personally the state of every 
humble family, not only in his own, but the 
neighbouring parishes, he foresaw clearly 
how far they would be affected ; to whom as- 
sistance would be most valuable, and where 
distress would be most severely felt ; and he 
determined durins; his confinement to consi- 
der how best he might contribute to its relief.

positive sense of duty would have led him to 
impose this task upon himself ; for it consish d 
in his opinion in collecting and paying all his 
own hills, and then giving away all he could 
spare, a simple and excellent plan for a poo* 
arithmetician. 
But alas ! in this pursuit, lie found that 
Alps on Alps arose, and not even the anxious 
ingenuity of Emma, who naturally dreaded the 
result of all investigation on a point which 
had excited her anxiety long ago, could suffice 
to prevent him from experiencing alarm, as- 
tonishment, and that solicitude to know the 
extent of the evil, which was natural to him 
as a man of scrupulous integrity, general 
though not trifling regularity, and great igno- 
rance of the subject as to its individualities. 
From finding his expenses (as a matter of 
course) exceedingly increased the year he 
married, he had habituated himself to consider 
that a wife was inevitably and properly a very 
expensive article in every establishment  on 
the year when he lost her for whom he thought 
no price too high, he concluded that all was 
right in affairs conducted by her sister, who 
was necessarily expensive, butiiow when there 
were only the children, those dear beings for

whose sakes he was anxious to save and to 
spare, and that Charles had generously in- 
sisted on all things going on as they used to 
do, " surely his long treasured wishes would 
be fulfilled  he should begin to make a depo- 
sit in the funds for his daughter." 
Seeing from the progress of these silent 
evidences of the lavish expenditure of his 
household, and the encroachments of Harriet, 
far beyond her own income, for gay apparel, 
that there would be a positive necessity for 
Charles to come forward with a considerable 
sum of money, he wrote to him to state his 
difficulties. In reply, his son inclosed the 
enormous bills presented to himself on his re- 
turn, and with deep sorrow stated the ne- 
cessity he was under of selling out stock, in 
order to liquidate these bills ; and at the same 
time saying that these monies must be re- 
placed, previous to his marriage, as Sir Mar- 
maduke Lyster had given him to understand 
" that he should expect the fortune of his 
late mother to be produced at that time in 
an unencumbered state," to which observa- 
tion he had replied by an offer to settle it 
on Eulalie.

v. helm and harass the already oppressed 
spirits of Mr, Carysford, this letter would 
have supplied it. The affection and peni- 
tence it breathed, rendered him unable to 
feel anger against the beloved writer, the in- 
closures it produced were alike appalling and 
surprising, and the information it gave puz- 
zled and alarmed him. He observed, over 
and over again, that " his poor boy must be 
helped, the money in the funds must not be 
touched, but in what manner it could be done, 
was utterly beyond his powers of calculation." 
When all this trouble was revealed to Har- 
riet, nothing could exceed the alarm and as- 
tonishment visible in her looks, but eager to 
forget her own share in the mischief, she ad- 
verted to Charles's bills as the greater evil, 
insisting. " that some serious mistake had 
been made, and that explanation would set 
all to rights, how could a man spend treble 
the sum his second year he had done the 
first ?" 
" You forget that Charles had my aunt's 
legacy to assist his first year's expenses,  
besides his situation became entirely altered 
after my dear mother's death, and every per- 
son around acted upon the conelusion that

he had a fortune to spend, which was pro- 
bably much exaggerated by report," said 
Emma. 
"But Charles ought to have known," said 
Harriet, " that he had nothing wherewith to 
help us, because he was spending it himself." 
"That he did not know, because he did not 
think, is very evident,  my aunt used to say 
that thinking was the province of the woman 
in every family, so ice must begin to think 
for him." 
" I have been much to blame  very much." 
" Indeed you have not, dear papa," cried 
Emma, eagerly, " when in April you proposed 
laying down the carnage, you thought wisely 
and kindly for us all ; we overruled it, and in 
doing this, laid the foundation of all these ex- 
penses, for had that taken place, it would not 
have been possible for us to have kept the 
company and engaged in the pleasures to 
which our income was inadequate  we should 
have been people on a less and more consist- 
ent scale, as we ought to have been." 
Although Emma kindly used the term we, 
yet Harriet so well knew that she had per- 
sonally constantly stemmed the tide, that she

could not fail to feel herself reproached, 
and therefore eagerly cried out, 
" But then would Charles have been able 
to secure the hand of Miss Mortimer? would 
he have held the place in society which be- 
comes the son of a Tintagcll ?" 
" Certainly, not the less because he lived 
within his means, since it is evident that Sir 
Marmaduke apprehended he had gone be- 
yond them, and Lady Lyster has repeatedly 
advised me against a system which was never 
adopted by my mother, even in her gayest 
days. You must be well aware that Charles 
is loved at the Park for his own sake, and 
that, when that worthy family consented to 
his marriage with Eulalie, they were full) 
aware of the inequality of their fortunes  
aware also, that with all her good qualities 
their niece ought to have a prudent husband, 
one who will guard his wife's property." 
" You are right, Emma  as much has 
been said to me; but yet I know that 
Charles's prospects have an influence in the 
a flair."

it is a great happiness that we can do it. I 
propose giving that sum which was my deat 
aunt's extra legacy, and then we will alikt 
lend that which  
"I cannot, will not allow that," cried Mr 
Carysford. 
"And I  that is, I fear," said Harriet in 
great confusion, " we will talk of it by and 
by." 
" That will be much better, for I cannot 
bear to see my father harassed by it whilst 
he has this terrible cold upon him  we have 
happily time enough for every thing. Come,

CHAP. VI. 
When Emma had succeeded in somewhat 
allaying the nervous agitation, and soothing 
the solicitude of her father, by diverting his 
mind in a slight degree from this distressing 
subject ; when she had seen him in bed, and 
administered the gruel which contained his 
anodyne, she repaired to Harriet, who was 
walking with perturbed steps in the usual sit- 
ting-room below. 
" I thought you would never come, Emma; 
I have been almost distracted lest you should 
make some further offer to my father. 1 
could not make you understand me by signs." 
" 1 did not understand you farther, than 
that you did not choose to advance him any 
money, certainlv." 
" I cannot, situated as I am with  other- 
wise I should be most happy to do it, but

is interest to pay, so that altogether we shall 
have nothing else to live upon." 
" What can you mean, Harriet ? who are 
you speaking of?" 
" Frank Wilmington  we are engaged  
I have wished to inform you for some time, 
but I have had no opportunity." 
Emma sat down in the nearest chair  she 
made no reply, and for a few moments a 
ghastly paleness overspread her countenance, 
but Harriet did not look towards her, she con- 
tinned to traverse the room with hurried steps, 
and her information was given less like the 
confession of a lover, than a criminal. 
" I believe Frank  Captain Wilmington 
was struck with me from the day we first met 
at least he tells me so  in fact, he mis- 
took me for you, that is, for the Miss Carys- 
ford who lent his father the money, which 
gave him perhaps a prepossession in favour 
of all the family, you know." 
Emma immediately recollected the time 
when he had mentioned it to her, with the air, 
as she now conceived, of a person but slightly 
connected with it; and she felt as if she were 
literally choused out of a certain prospect of 
happiness, which would at this moment have

been inconceivably dear  she felt that eacli 
had entertained a prepossession in favour of 
the other, that ought to have had certain re- 
sults, and she forgot, in the biting vexation of 
the moment, that opinions less favourable to 
Captain Wilmington had lately arisen in 
her mind, and that either from anxiety or 
other topics, or that self-conquest on which 
she had resolved, and for which she had sin- 
cerely prayed, he had been very little in her 
thoughts. She now could only remember, 
how frequently and how kindly her mind 
had been occupied by him, and how possible 
it was that similar feelings had possessed his 
mind for her  that both had been injured and 
betrayed  though how far, and under what 
circumstances, did not appear as yet. 
" You do not speak, Emma  you think of 
course, that a person who has often ridiculed 
love in others, should not have so entangled 
themselves  I am aware of all that you say, 
but surely some consideration should be given 
to a man so amiable; a man whose unme- 
rited misfortunes have rendered him so in- 
teresting, so  " 
Emma burst into tears. 
" I fear you think that 1 have been too hasty ?"

" I think nothing about you, nothing at all, 
Harriet, but I must leave you, I must consi- 
der my own means of relieving my father 
from the embarrassments he is unequal to 
contending with." 
" But you will not call in that money. 
Emma ; you will not distress poor Frank 
again so soon." 
" If I understood you right, Captain Wil- 
mington believes himself your debtor, not 
mine ; if you choose to become so, I shall be 
very glad, as the money will be most accept- 
able to me, you are well aware." 
" Oh ! he understands all now  it was 
only in the beginning of our acquaintance 
that he deceived himself ; you could not sup- 
pose me capable of deceiving him : 'tis true, 
he believes me instrumental in persuading 
you to relieve the distress under which his 
parents then laboured  you know it was 
mentioned to me." 
" It was, and you told me that I should 
lose the money." 
" I remember I talked very like a fool  I 
had never seen Wilmington then, you know." 
" But I had," said Emma internally, and 
she hurried out of the room, too much agi-

tatcd to remember that Harriet's question 
was still unanswered; nor did reflection on 
this point cause her to return, for although 
she was glad that a sister whom she tenderly 
loved, and whom she desired to esteem, had 
not in this transaction stooped to direct false- 
hood, yet she was still aware that false im- 
pressions had been given, and she was by no 
means certain that much had not been im- 
puted to her sister's interference, which af- 
fected the mind of Captain Wilmington with 
gratitude and love, as its consequences. 
But when Emma was alone, when she re- 
flected on the whole transaction, she saw the 
affair in a different point of view. " If," 
said she, " a woman of Harriet's description, 
showy, expensive, witty, but haughty, con- 
scious of her beauty, and constantly exacting 
homage, can command the affections of 
Frank Wilmington, it is certain that he would 
not have chosen me from anv motive save 
that prepossession, which was probably fos- 
tered by his mother: it is very possible that 
this predilection might have led to something 
between us, which the beauty and accom- 
plishments of Harriet might have induced him 
finally to repent of, and I should have had

the mortification either of experiencing re- 
jection in the first instance, or neglect in the 
second. In the present state of things my 
delicacy is spared  Harriet has not even 
dared to pity me  all is well." 
Our feelings will not on all occasions in 
life keep pace with our reason, nor will they 
listen to the consolation it offers; but it is 
always the part of wisdom to moderate their 
suggestions by those arguments reason may 
offer, or that obedience to circumstances 
which religion exacts. In all those evils 
which arise from misfortunes in the course of 
Providence, every well instructed christian 
knows where he alone must look for support 
under his affliction ; and such had hitherto 
been the habitual source of comfort to 
Emma, but she was now surrounded by diffi- 
culties, and pressed by sorrows, ipimediately 
inflicted by her fellow-creatures, and those 
closely connected with her. She was ha- 
rassed by angry emotions towards her sister, 
a sense of disgrace arising from her father's 
debts, and of confusion and distress on the 
subject of their liquidation  her fears were 
excited for the health and the honour of her 
father and her brother, both of whom were at

this moment more dear to her than they had 
ever been, and none of these sources of grief 
and perplexity were, as she thought, of sueli 
a nature as that she could ease her overbur- 
dened heart by making them the subject of 
prayer. She could not " rush into the pre- 
sence of God as the horse rusheth into the 
battle," in confusion and indignation, with 
unsubdued pride and worldly cares struggling 
at her heart. 
But meditation and reflection, the remem- 
brance of keener sorrows which had been 
healed, of many blessings which yet re- 
mained, of many faults of heart and conduct 
(for who has not such) that were yet unpu- 
nished, in due time subdued these warring 
sensations, and enabled her to say, " to whom 
should I go but unto Thee," with this afflic- 
tion also. 
It may seem strange to many, that Emma 
could not in her present troubles open her 
heart to Sophia, as one equally interested in 
the affairs of the family, and a sister so near 
her own age, as to be likely to enter into her 
feelings on other points. Alas ! this was im- 
possible ; with poor Sophy whatever was not 
according to her own views positively right,

MODERATION. 93 
she concluded to be positively wrong ; and 
therefore every person in her family was 
under distinct but absolute interdict from her 
good opinion, and when her natural affections 
stirred her up to kindness and consideration 
towards them, she took her heart to task for 
its weakness, as loving those who were 
" aliens to the faith," or " lovers of pleasure 
more than lovers of God." Blending truth 
with falsehood, adopting the most cruel and 
contracted of all creeds, mistaking quiet ob- 
stinacy for scriptural meekness, and continu- 
ally opposing all that was really good in her 
own disposition, from a belief that nothing 
could be good which was naturally suggested, 
and that only some far-fetched idea or sud- 
denly-inspired impulse ought to be acted 
upon; it might be truly said that her hand 
was " against every one," and that she moved 
" every one's hand to be against her," at least 
within her own family. 
With this unhappy and mistaken view of 
things, taken by a young and beautiful wo- 
man, well educated, and accustomed to supe- 
rior society, there could not fail to be great 
inconsistency of conduct; and the many lu- 
dicrous situations in which she placed herself

by exciting discussion or provoking laughter 
from Charles and Harriet, gentle remon- 
strance from her father, or kind persuasion 
from Emma, only confirmed her in equal op- 
position to them all. Yet she could not deny 
herself the pleasure of rejoicing in the good 
prospects of her only brother at some times, 
and at others feeling grateful for the gifts 
which Harriet, with more profusion than pru- 
dence, accorded to the objects of her charity. 
There were moments when she would allow 
that her father " was almost a christian," and 
that Emma was not " utterly a castaway;" 
but as she held it a positive duty to look on 
the dark side of all things and persons, be- 
yond these concessions she dared not venture. 
It will therefore be evident, Sophia was not 
a person to yield consolation, and being still 
under age she could not give pecuniary as- 
sistance, and she was herself in her own way 
as expensive as Harriet. " Wresting the 
scriptures to her own destruction" by insist- 
ing that the " mammon of unrighteousness" 
ought not to remain in her hands, she not 
only kept herself without money, but became 
the regular pest of the neighbourhood as a

into the will and power of all her father's 
parishioners, from the broom-maker's penny 
a-week, for blackamoor preachers, to the 
Baronet's contribution for the widows of 
Waterloo. In point of fact, the whole fa- 
mily of the Carysfords were naturally gene- 
rous, and it was necessary for them to mode- 
rate this propensity ; but Sophia, not giving 
her nature credit for this amiable disposition, 
classed it as the " grace of charity," and 
gave herself up to an unlimited indulgence 
of it in cases where good sense and duty 
were alike violated, and of course the pre- 
cepts of Christianity perverted. 
On the day following the discussion of 
which we have spoken, Mr. Carysford was so 
extremely unwell as to be advised to keep his 
chamber, and Emma insisted on sending for 
a physician. This gentleman arrived at the 
very time when Charles, who had been 
wretched ever since he had sent those letters 
which were so likely to create distress at 
home, came in from Cambridge ; and Harriet 
believed that this unexpected circumstance, 
by agitating her father, made him appear 
much worse in the eyes of the medical gen-

tleman than he really was. Whether this 
were the case or not is immaterial, it being 
suflieient to say, that Doctor Sneyd earnestly 
recommended them to procure advice from 
the celebrated Doctor Baillie, as pulmonary 
complaints of an alarming tendency were 
exhibited. 
" I will go with my father to London im- 
mediately," said Charles. 
" I would advise you to do so  but you 
must hold yourself in readiness for a much 
longer journey  I think the Doctor wil.' 
hardly fail to send you to Nice, or Lisbon." 
The countenance of Charles fell, and he 
sighed deeply. 
" My dear Sir, the disorder must be taken 
in time, I know you all consider the life of 
your father invaluable." 
" But, Doctor Sneyd," said Emma, blush- 
ing, yet with deep solicitude pictured on her 
alarmed countenance, " have you not allowed 
that I am an excellent nurse?" 
" You are, my dear, the very best for so 
young a woman I have ever met with." 
" Then / will go  if Charles be taken from 
his studies my father will be more grieved by 
that circumstance, than assisted by his society."

symptoms that trouble him. But perhaps 
Miss Carysford  " 
Harriet with a look of great alarm said 
" she fervently hoped that at this time the 
voyage would not be found necessary." 
" My sister, dear Sir," said Emma, " has not 
been accustomed to a sick chamber as I have, 
she would betray her feelings too much." 
" She would ruin us, I perceive you must 
go, Miss Emma, and may, I trust, go with the 
hope of success; but lose no time, sharp frosts 
may set in suddenly, our climate can never be 
trusted at this season." 
The doctor departed, and the young people 
crowding together for some time, looked at 
each other with that sorrow and dismay, 
which clearly proved that every source of 
uneasiness except the last, was for the mo- 
ment forgotten. The bell of the invalid 
roused them from this painful silence. 
" Dear Charles, pray command your feel- 
ings," said Emma, " my father will do very 
well if he is kept calm." 
" But how can I, Emma?  have I not 
brought on all this sorrow and

" No, dear Charles, you have only  " 
Emma's reply was cut short by the entrance 
of Mr. Carysford, who reading the sensations 
of his son, from learning that he was still 
with his sisters, yearned over him with all a 
lather's feelings, and came down impatiently 
to clasp him to his heart. 
The scene that followed was indeed far 
too moving for the welfare of the invalid, 
but it was happily interrupted, as Emma then 
thought, by the entrance of Mr. Evans, the 
Ions: esteemed curate of her father. He 
came (such is the mixture of good and evil 
taking place in all societies) to announce the 
circumstance of his appointment to a distant 
living. 
If ever human being could be said to live 
in the good or evil of others, Mr. Carysford 
was that man; he could indeed "rejoice 
with those that rejoiced, and weep with those 
who wept," and the solid joy he felt in see- 
ing his worthy friend, who was married and 
iiad a family so provided for, carried him for 
the present from himself and his cares; a 
pleasure which necessarily increased upon 
him, when he learnt that his own recommen- 
dation had been the cause of the gift.

Emma sincerely rejoiced also, yet sir.? 
could not fail to see that the difficulties of 
her present situation were accumulated by the 
circumstance, since Mr. Evans's place must 
be supplied immediately. The sense of how 
much she had undertaken to do, and how 
much she had lately felt, and must still feel, 
for a few moments overcame her  she cast 
her eyes upon Harriet, and saw that she was 
still weeping, regardless of the presence or 
the information of Mr. Evans  she looked at 
Charles, he was pale, but his looks were those 
of thoughtful self-command. 
" Poor Harriet ! she is ever thus, there is 
no medium in her joy or sorrow, I can ex- 
pect no help from her  but Charles's pain- 
ful lesson may have affected him happily, 
he must assist me." 
Having engaged Mr. Evans to spend the 
day with them, Emma drew Charles into the 
study, and entered at once into the discussion 
of those affairs, which there was now so much 
more occasion to despatch than before. By 
displaying their own household expenses, she 
somewhat meliorated the acute self-reproach 
under which he laboured, and thereby ren- 
dered him equal to the task he dreaded, by

informing him of the situation of Harriet with 
young Wilmington, aa a portion of their ge- 
neral business, she was saved from revealing 
it with those symptoms of confusion and dis- 
tress, which might have betrayed that interest 
she had once taken in the gentleman. 
" It will be a very poor match for Harriet, 
for some years;" said Charles, "with her 
habits, I cannot see how they can live at all." 
"They must be determined to be mod< rate, 
thf.y must accept of each other in lieu of the 
luxuries of life ; they must contend with their 
own desires: hold warfare with their own 
wishes, as Eulalie would say."

selves to indolence and sorrow, in consequence 
of them." 
" But it cannot be right to extricate one's 
self by injuring another, and that other a

cautioned me, how often  " 
" Jf you are now convinced that I was

such portions as will have the advantage 
of binding you down to those restrictions 
which will give habits of economy, enable 
you to fulfil Sir Marmadu Ice's requisition, and

gentleman, and the sober independence be- 
coming a clergyman." 
" But, dear Emma, you may marry." 
" It will be a long time first, Charles  think 
of our dear father's situation, and you will 
see to what and to whom I am married." 
Charles with a deep sigh allowed that many 
painful engagements were at present pressing, 
he examined her papers and her plans, ac- 
ceded to her wishes, promised that if she were 
obliged to leave the country, he would observe 
all her directions, and accepted the charge

of those papers she held for her loan to Cap- 
tain Wilmington, and her directions respect- 
ing them . The perfect confidence reposed 
in him by Emma, at a period when he feared 
that a person so calm and prudent would be 
incapable of pitying his distress, or of even 
conceiving the nature of his embarrassments, 
endowed him with self-confidence and self-re- 
spect, and showed him the folly of pursu- 
ing those trifling pleasures and that ephemeral 
notoriety he had so dearly purchased. Jt was 
evident that not only did her affection seek 
to sustain him in his trouble, but that her 
judgment gave him credit for a manliness or 
mind, an uprightness of intention, and a re- 
ligious firmness in the discharge of his future 
duties, and he trusted, though he did not 
say so, that he should not deceive her. 
When the brother and sister had arranged 
these tremendous concerns, Charles set out 
to the Park to announce the painful com- 
munications of Doctor Snevd, who it ap- 
peared had been there before him, and so 
alarmed the worthy family for their old and 
much loved friend, that they were proceed- 
ing in a bodv to call upon him, and request 
him instantly to et out without making

an useless journey to the metropolis ; and as 
Charles was aware that they could not find 
him more equal to talking on the subject at 
any period than the present, he entered the 
carriage with them and returned immediately 
to the Rectory, occupying the same seat 
with Eulalie, whose eyes gave proof how 
much she sympathized in his sorrow for his 
father, to whom she was much attached. 
When the Baronet and his Lady had taken 
their seats in the study, Eulalie stole away 
with Emma, whose fears were more excited 
than they had hitherto been from what she 
now heard, but she compelled herself to seize 
the period when the young beauty's better 
feelings were so strongly excited, to paint the 
conduct of Charles in the most amiable point 
of view, and show Eulalie how much his fu- 
ture happiness and honour depended upon 
herself; how necessary, though difficult, i 
might be for her to strengthen him in every 
virtuous resolution, and thus, early in life, 
exhibit the heroism of affection. 
"But how am I to do it, dear Emma?" 
" By inducing him to pursue his studies

paring yourself to be a country clergyman's 
wife. 1 prescribe you no light tasks, Eulalie, 
but 1 am much mistaken if your mind is not 
equal to them  at least it is my consolation 
to think so." 
It rarely happened that Emma Carysford 
said so much as her surrounding friends, but 
in the present hurry on her spirits, and in the 
dread she felt of leaving any thing undone 
within lur power, she entered into a kind 
of new character as mistress of the house 
which it would have been happy if she had 
adopted sooner; whilst giving the direction; 
she considered necessary for a journey to 
London on the morrow, the Baronet and his 
Lady in the anxiety of their hearts were 
urging Mr. Carysford to embrace the pre- 
scribed voyage immediately. 
The warmth of feeling shown in this in- 
terview, the recollections it naturally em- 
braced of all the years that were gone by, 
and more especially of that beloved wife and 
friend who, in being transplanted from one 
family to the other, bound each more firmly 
to the other, together with the new, and still

stronger tie now contemplated, rendered it of 
great importance to Mr. Carysford, who with 
one proviso acceded to the wishes of his 
friends. Charles interfered, to say that he 
pledged himself (and could safely do so) for 
the exact settlement of all his affairs, and the 
Baronet immediately added, " and I pledge 
myself to be his friend, his father, if he needs 
one." 
" I must see my people  I must preach to 
them before I 2:0  Mr. Evans and I must 
once more do duty together, and then I will 
set out as soon as Emmy is ready, and leave 
all things to your kind management." 
This proposal appeared so perfectly reason- 
able, so agreeable to their own wishes and 
feelings  it was evidently so necessary that 
a few days must elapse for the settlement of 
such material concerns as the removal of a 
whole family, and so natural that he who had 
been the minister of a populous and exten- 
sive parish for more than thirty years, and 
was under the necessity of subjecting them 
to a kind of twofold change, that it was per- 
fectly approved by all, save Emma. She 
saw that her father's mind was even now in a

state of excitement for which he would after- 
wards suffer, and knew that although he was 
a man who might be said to live upon his 
affections, and iind in the love and good-w ill 
of those around him the solace of his sorrows, 
yet that the too great exercise of his sensibi- 
lity at this period was sure to be extremely 
injurious. She also knew, that as he had 
a higher motive for his care of the congre- 
gation than their love offered him, so he 
could not be devoid of consolatory remem- 
brances, even if he were for the present de- 
prived of that too affecting meeting he now- 
requested. 
As poor Emma had only a single voice, it 
was soon overruled, and it was her next care 
to issue requests on every side to those whom 
she knew to be more particularly attached to 
him, from benefits received, or griefs partici- 
pated, entreating them to forbear bidding him 
personally farewell. Some few had the good 
sense to see the necessity of this; but the 
generality concluded, that if his worship had 
strength enough to preach, he had certainly 
strength enough to shake hands with an old 
parishioner ; and several observed " that they

were sure he would do well, for though he 
was rather thin, his eves looked bright and

1 he intervening days somewhat restored 
Harriet to that power of thinking which grief 
and anxiety had deprived her of; and in the 
society of him she loved, she found that con- 
solation every young woman so situated has 
a right to expect. Emma had the satisfac- 
tion to see Charles earnestly engage, with the 
aid of Mr. Evans, in searching for some gen- 
tleman of superior character and suitable at- 
tainments to supply the double chasm in their 
church, and wished, if possible, that a mar- 
ried person could be found who would come 
into the house. As this was hardly to be 
hoped for, it was agreed that for ihe present 
Harriet should take up her abode at the Park, 
and Sophia at the house of Mr. Wilmington, 
two of whose daughters were on the point of 
marriage, which therefore enabled them to 
offer her this accommodation. 
It was however purely from love to Emma

that Mrs. Wilmington consented so to bur- 
den herself, for she had absolutely a dread of 
receiving a person so likely to be either too 
repulsive, or too persuasive, to young persons 
of her own age. During the short visit 
which Emma was able to make to these wor- 
thy people, no reference was made till the 
last moment to Harriet's situation with Cap- 
tain Wilmington, and then the mother shook 
her head and wept bitterly. 
Emma was herself much affected  she had 
long loved Mrs. Wilmington dearly, and sht 
hoped that her tears were shed in conse- 
quence of parting with her, at least she felt 
at this moment certain, that her love for the 
mother had been a very principal cause of 
that decree of attraction there had been for 
her in the son, and her ideas on this point re- 
ceived a happy confirmation to herself from 
the ease with which she bade him farewell, 
though he went away with Harriet on his 
arm. 
The following day was Sunday  Mr. Ca- 
rysford admitted, on rising, that he had had a 
bad night, that he found it necessary to keep 
quiet during the morning, but had no doubt 
he should be equal to the afternoon duty ;

the day was fine, the congregation numerous, 
and the looks of anxiety directed towards his 
pew bespoke the solicitude and disappoint- 
ment of the people, and rendered Emma 
only the more desirous of saving the invalid 
from that which she felt unequal to encoun- 
tering herself. 
When the afternoon service commenced, 
the morning conu;re2;ation returned with such 
increased numbers, that it was evident curio- 
sity and anxiety had drawn the whole popu- 
lation of the neighbourhood, and that every 
seceder was present, either from those return- 
ing emotions of reverence and affection likely 
to be re-awakened from their long slumber in 
this day of trial, or from that spirit of male- 
volent investigation by which prejudice seeks 
to strengthen its dominion, and confirm its 
power to cavil. 
Mr. Carysford possessed an extraordinary 
facility of vision, which neither time nor sor- 
row had as yet impaired, and as his eye 
glanced over the crowded aisles and pews, 
he recognized these strangers mimrled with 
friends, and his heart expanded to receive 
them as children returning to their allegiance 
as those who, in the pride of their hearts

or the weakness of their judgments, had been 
withdrawn for a short time, but might now 
return for ever ; and he was almost ready to 
resign all thoughts of a journey, which 
might be productive of again scattering 
these sheep. A few moments' reflection told 
him that they were not his, but yet he could 
not consider them as the old clerk did, " spies 
in the land," " enemies in the camp," for 
with how many even of these had he not 
been associated, in all the most tender and 
awful hours of existence, and from which of 
them had he merited desertion ? 
He cast his eyes on Sophia, his youngest, 
perhaps his best beloved child, the imags 
of the mother whose presence in that seat had 
so often filled his heart with gratitude to hea- 
ven. It was very grateful to him to behold 
her there ; but she was bathed in tears, and 
though he trusted they were salutary, yet he 
could not behold them unmoved, and he left 
his pew for the pulpit under great internal 
agitation. 
Mr. Carysford had prepared a short, plain, 
but deeply impressive discourse, and he Mas 
enabled to deliver it with more composure 
than his people could hear it. When, towards 
i

the close, he adverted to that schism which, 
although in its infancy, had been to him " a 
rending of the heart-strings;" an universal 
motion, an increased half-murmuring breath- 
ing of many sighs was heard, and faint 
sounds of suppressed anger broke from warm 
hearts unawares : but when, advancing in his 
discourse, he spoke of the abundant conso- 
lation administered to him in the hour of dis- 
tress by the love of his people, not only did 
his voice falter, but it was overpowered for a 
short time by the audible sobs, the universal 
movement that pervaded all hearts. Most of 
all the young men near the pulpit, who held 
themselves as his especial band, and the nu- 
merous mothers in the congregation, whose 
children he had baptized, instructed, perhaps 
buried, (for these had with scarcely an ex- 
ception remained unshaken,) exhibited the 
grief and love which penetrated their hearts : 
but every where it was felt. Lady Lyster, 
agitated almost to fainting, was obliged to 
withdraw, and Eulalie sobbed aloud. 
The concluding words of exhortation were 
perhaps heard by lew, but they will probablv 
never be forgotten ; for under the strong per- 
sonal affection excited at the moment, that

which was uttered " in much weakness," be- 
came a powerful and impressive lesson, bet- 
ter remembered than many more excellent, 
which had preceded it. 
When Mr. Carysford descended the pul- 
pit stairs, he was evidently completely over- 
come, and the croud that pressed around 
him threw Emma into despair, but she went 
with Charles to his assistance, and as the 
Baronet also followed, room was made for 
them. At this moment the good pastor 
might indeed have adopted the words of the 
apostle, and said, " why will ye thus weep 
and break my heart," for every eye was 
strained to look upon him, every half-suffo- 
cated voice prayed God to bless him, and 
many wondered why they had sought with 
so much avidity for more moving teachers, 
finding all around them so deeply and 
strangely affected. 
Happy was Emma when this affecting and 
awful farewell was over, and when she had 
once more seen the beloved invalid on his 
own sofa, she flattered herself that the fe- 
verish excitement of these interesting cir- 
cumstances would sink into that calm re-

pose and devout resignation, so necessary fur 
his comfort, at a period calling for new ex- 
ertion on the morrow. Alas ! before he could 
recover the late trial, a new one still more 
affecting, broke upon him, from the entrance 
of Sophia, who in agonizing sorrow knelt by 
his couch, addressed him as "a dying father, 
and besought him to have compassion upon a 
child, who had offended him, wounded and 
injured him irreparably, yet had done all 
for conscience' sake." 
It will be readily conceived how fully and. 
kindly she was forgiven, how fondly she was 
folded to a heart, which had constantly con- 
* mi 
sidcred her " with sorrow more than anger," 
and with what extreme solicitude, as a father 
and a minister, he endeavoured to prove (as 
he had often done before) wherein her judg- 
ment had erred. Forgetful of himself till 
compelled by positive weakness to cease 
speaking, he had continued during half the 
night to combat the opinions or soothe the 
sorrows of Sophia, during which Emma had 
vainly endeavoured to allay the acuteness of 
those feelings in both parties, which, however 
naturally excited or amiably exercised, could

nor recollected in future by the other, with- 
out self-reproach alike bitter and unavailing. 
Emma, anxious to save all unnecessary ex- 
pense, was accompanied only by a man ser- 
vant, who had lived many years in the fa- 
mily, understood his master's habits, and made 
up, in his steadiness and affection, for defici- 
ency in activity and knowledge. Most un- 
fortunately a severe frost took place during 
their journey, and added its bad effects to 
those produced by previous irritation of the 
system; and Mr. Carysford, persuaded that he 
should be better at sea, decided on proceeding 
for Lisbon in preference to Nice. 
Emma had never yet been upon the water, 
and her suffering from sea-sickness was very 
great ; but when she was capable of taking 
comfort in any thing, she had the very sen- 
sible one of seeing her father recover not 
only composure of spirits, but increase of 
appetite. To her he constantly paid the 
kindest attention as well as his poor ser- 
vant, who was also a great sufferer, and he 
would frequently joke them on their situation, 
chat pleasantly with the captain of the 
packet, and prove that interest in the navi-

gation of the vessel, which bespoke to 
Emma's great satisfaction a mind at case, 
and, as she trusted, a constitution recovering 
the shock it had laboured under. 
The voyage was long and tedious, and 
without being positively dangerous, yet ex- 
hibited such specimens of the mighty ocean 
in its wrath, as to keep so new a voyager 
as Emma in frequent apprehension, and 
she was truly rejoiced when they entered 
the Tagus, and saw much to admire even 
in the dreary season of their arrival. The 
weather was mild, there was a promise of 
early spring, and winter with its train of 
threatened evils was at least left far to the 
northward. A noble city was before them, 
on the history of which her father dilated 
with pleasure, recalling from the extensive 
and highly cultivated stores of his elegant 
mind, every circumstance and anecdote, 
which could amuse or interest her, anil she 
looked forward now with more sanguine 
hopes than she had yet entertained, to a 
short and pleasant residence, a speedy and 
happy return.

Under the guidance of their captain, who 
was a plain good-humoured man, they estab- 
lished themselves in an Hotel which had 
within a few years been inhabited by numbers 
of English officers, and was therefore consi- 
dered the most likely to accommodate Eng- 
lish travellers. 
Whilst we continue moving, every one, 
whether amazed or annoyed, remembers that 
he is a traveller, that his journey is intended 
to conduct him to a certain end, and will 
continue only for a given time; but when he 
is arrived at the place of destination, his mind 
demands a home in his resting place  this 
sensation operates of course the most de- 
cidedly, in those persons who have rarely left 
their own, and therefore our present party 
felt the difference very painfully. Mr. Carys- 
ford was in this respect better than his 
daughter, for he was exceedingly interested

in every thing passing in a catholic country, 
is such ; his knowledge of that splendid 
Hierarchy which has for so many centuries 
enslaved the minds and ruled over the sub- 
jects of so many countries, which has bound 
kings and lawgivers to its footstool, and ren- 
dered genius, science, and talent subservient 
to its power, gave an attraction or roused a 
curiosity in his mind respecting every object 
he beheld ; and the first grey friar he saw 
wading through the filthy streets appeared to 
him in the light of a dramatic performer 
about to introduce other personages, and 
enact some singular spectacle for his amuse- 
ment. 
The mild weather, and the apparent amend- 
ment of Mr. Carysford, rendered Emma able 
consistently to go with her father from church 
to church, examine the architecture of one, the 
paintings of another; listen with profound 
delight to those magnificent orchestras where 
religion, invoking the aid of the senses, takes 
the soul captive by that music which seems 
indeed worthy of the Creator whose name it 
exalts, yet is here blended with puerilities un- 
worthy the creatures who perform them. Mr. 
Carysford, as a man of most liberal mind, as

an antiquary, and a philanthropist in the 
most extensive sense of the word, held him- 
self willing to worship with the old church, 
though by no means a lukewarm son of the 
new. He believed that in her imposing ce- 
remonies and magnificent institutions, he 
could accept the aids so offered to the imagi- 
nation, without adverting to the abuses with 
which they are mingled. He soon found 
however that neither that extensive charity 
with which nature and cultivation had em- 
bued his mind, nor that fine poetic enthusi- 
asm so likely to be awakened in a heart or 
such vivid conception and exquisite sensibi- 
lity, would permit this partial and agreeable 
blindness to hide the errors he deplored. He 
was compelled to witness idolatry which was 
alike reprehensible and despicable, to learn 
the existence of ignorance and bigotry 
equally incredible and deplorable. 
When not traversing " the long-drawn 
aisle," the different monasteries were objects 
of curiosity, and as several possessed noble 
though neglected libraries, which were open 
to him as an Englishman, (in consequence o 
the late obligations of Portugal to Great Bri- 
tain,) they offered considerable attraction.

These treasures proved very unfortunate ac- 
quisitions, for being frequently placed in cold 
uninhabited rooms, when some curious manu- 
script or scarce book was seized upon, Mr. 
Carysford forgot his own ailments, and his 
anxious daughter's cautions, in the avidity 
and solicitude with which he eagerly perused 
or slowly deciphered it. In a short time 
Emma perceived that, notwithstanding the 
mildness of the air and the advantages of that 
strict regimen which he observed, that ever) 
bad symptom had returned with increased 
fever, and she was compelled to interdict 
those visits which produced such effects. 
At this period they received letters from 
home, which although thev afforded some 
things consolatory, and many things of a na- 
ture to occupy the mind, presented others as 
subjects of reflection ill calculated for an in- 
valid deprived of the only sense of amuse- 
ment which could win him from regret of his 
home and his country, and lull that sense of 
languor and disease which now made itself 
continually felt. It appeared that Charles 
had hitherto strictly adopted Emma's advice, 
that he was acting with prudence and wisdom, 
but he was also suffering, and in his mortifi-

cations and labours the fond father and the 
anxious sister fully partook. Harriet on the 
other hand appeared to have recovered her 
spirits, which she imputed to the favourable 
accounts received from them ; but she ad- 
mitted that her marriage would probably 
have taken place before that letter was re- 
ceived, in consequence of the necessity Cap- 
tain Wilmington was under to join his re- 
giment, which was still in Ireland ; and she 
rilled up her paper with accounts of winter 
fashions, and the marriage of Mr. Wilming- 
ton's eldest daughter, which appeared rather 
to excite envy than joyfulness in her mind. 
Sophia's letter was addressed to her father, 
and was full of affectionate expressions, not 
unmixed with exhortations against popery, 
which awoke a smile ; but one part of the 
letter was highly satisfactory : she assured 
him, " that Mr. Bennison, his most excellent 
new Curate, gave the greatest satisfaction in 
his situation ; that he was a serious young 
man, and one whom she could hear with sa- 
tisfaction ; moreover, that he was of good 
family, tall, well made, and with very fine 
eyes, and was thought by many to have in 
him " the savour of life," for he was attended

not only by the "sons of Belial," but the 
"chosen people." 
"May God bless and prosper this gentle- 
man's labours in my vineyard," said the 
affectionate minister as he handed the letter 
to Emma, " but I must own, it would have 
been quite as satisfactory if my little theo- 
logical daughter had found his doctrines less 
to her liking." 
" My dear Sir, you may be easy on that 
point, Sophia seems to have found his person 
and eyes to her liking, and therefore recon- 
ciles herself to his doctrine ; Charles says 
that she is amazingly improved, but that

" Charles acts wisely, nobly,  but his 
trouble with money matters must be very 
great, it will ruin him for reading, it will be 
impossible for him to take his degree ; it 
is very, very hard upon him." 
" My dear Sir, be easy on that head : Charles 
has the means of paying all his own creditors 
and yours also, and although he has nothing 
to spare, yet he will have money by the time 
he needs it, he is stepping from a young man 
of no thought, to a man of much thought, 
a hard reader, a steady preparer for those 
duties as a clergyman and a husband, which 
are the objects of his hope; in a very short 
time he will be easier than ever he has been." 
" Poor fellow, I wonder where he got the 
money ; but any body would help Charles

lent him that sum which your aunt's resi- 
duary legacy left at liberty, and to that I 
could not object, though I would on no ac-

which was funded. But that I apprehend was 
insufficient, reach me the pen and ink, my dear."

" Not for the world, dear father ; of all 
other evils you well know none are so great

make as many cabalistic lines as you please 
on the paper, calling them Greek, Hebrew, 
or Syriac, but no sixes and sevens, or my 
jrood nursing will soon be reduced to a 
cypher." 
Poor Mr. Carysford so well knew his owi 
insufficiency on this subject; he was gene 
rally so willing to aid a jest, cither on Ins 
arithmetic, or his carving, that when his pe- 
cuniary concerns were not immediately con- 
nected with his sense of justice, his affec- 
tionate care of his children, or his anxiety to 
perform some work of charity, he was seldom 
pertinacious in pursuing an object so disagree- 
able. In early life his sister had relieved 
him from cares of this nature, in married life 
his wife took the expenditure and regulation 
of money matters upon herself, and although 
from time to time he spoke with great 
anxiety on the subject of saving, and some- 
times in such strong terms that a stranger 
might have thought ruin was at the door; 
yet when she had convinced him by very 
plain reasons and evident documents, that

all was safe, that his income was not exceed- 
ed, and put in his hands some cash for the 
widow he sought to relieve, or the book he 
wished to purchase, his cares for the future 
regularly subsided. He then remembered " that 
his family was large and expensive, that his 
excellent wife was brought up to higher ex- 
pectations and indulgences than she required, 
that it would be the right time to save money 
when their children's expenses were lessened, 
and, in short, that they were excellent mana- 
gers as well as very happy people." 
The disposition of the father was well 
known to both his daughters, indeed it might 
be said to be known to every person, almost 
every child, in his parish, for if he had tried 
he would not have had the faculty of con- 
cealing his joys, sorrows, perplexities, or re- 
liefs. There was a sunshine of countenance 
in his general aspect, an overflowing of 
connubial love in his common mode of speech, 
when he answered the most homely enquirer 
about Madam, which told his general felicity, 
and by the same rule, if sickness visited 
his little ones, if the beloved mother was 
in a state of suffering, or himself in one of

apprehension on her account, there was a 
shade on his brow, a character of despond- 
ency on his expressive features, that could 
not be mistaken, " he walked softly as one 
that niourneth for his mother," and there were 
times also, when a threadbare coat, an anxious 
attention to some petty saving, and a mag- 
nanimous resolution not to look at a print or 
a catalogue, took place. These the Baronet 
called " the Rector's silver threepenny days," 
and observed truly, " that they were points 
soon played with him." 
To Harriet, whose residence with her aunt 
had nurtured pride and the love of show, this 
disposition presented temptation to encroach 
upon her father; to Emma, whose mind had 
been better informed, it offered a sense oi 
increased duty, a species of guardianship, 
which, without impairing reverence, actually 
increased her love for her father. Such was 
the nature of this affection, that if her mind 
had not been from principle, as well as habit 
and good humour, gentle and moderate, she 
must have spent her life in perpetual bicker- 
ings with her sisters, for she regarded Har- 
riet's impositions on her father's yielding

temper as almost cruel and wicked ; and the 
opposition of Sophia to so liberal and conci- 
liating a spirit as ridiculous and rebellious. 
But moderating her resentments, her desires, 
her sorrows, and her affections, Emma from 
day to day sought to render her father happy, 
and every branch of her family amiable and 
respectable, to become resigned to the past 
and prepared for the future ; without affect- 
ing either extraordinary knowledge, wisdom, 
or pietj-, she yet endeavoured constantly tc 
cultivate her mind, regulate her conduct by 
good sense, and find, in the exercise of 
christian duties, consolation and delight. 
In consequence, Harriet and Sophia were, 
each in their own circle, much more talked 
of and thought of than Emma, but she was 
more approved of than either, and therefore 
had a quiet influence for good in the hearts 
of all who knew her. This influence had per- 
haps been less felt by her father previous to 
his voyage than might have been expected; 
for though he loved Emma as a dear and 
most unoffending child, he was not conscious 
how much her constant but unobtrusive cares 
had soothed his corrosive grief, diverted his 
melancholy, and led him to the due con-

tcmplation of his duty to God and man. He 
now found that the relief which he had im- 
puted to all his children by a sweeping con- 
clusion, belonged to Emma, for she supplied 
all to him; and he therefore willingly agreed 
to her suggestion and admitted of her man- 
agement, gladly listened to her excuses for 
one child, her comforts in another, and in 
doing so, gave himself the best chance for 
recovery, and his daughter the greatest satis- 
faction his state admitted. 
But the "still small shaft" of death was 
sped  the quiet, insinuating disease, which 
baffles skill whilst it nurses hope, was calmly 
feeding on the springs of life, and at the 
very time when Emma trusted that every 
breeze " brought healing on its wings," 
slowly but surely was confirmed consump- 
tion securing its unresisting victim.

After witnessing the processions and va- 
rious ceremonies exhibited during Passion 
and Easter weeks, as the vegetation was lux- 
uriant, and the weather warm, Emma thought 
that excursions into the country could not 
fail to be useful ; and as Mr. Carysford had 
little love for crowded cities at any time, 
he gladly proposed to remove to Cintra. 
To this beautiful and romantic spot they 
accordingly set out, and were gratified to the 
highest degree by the various views presented, 
in the course of their journey, of Lisbon, the 
Tagus, the Cork convent, the shipping, the 
beauty and variety of objects entirely new to 
them in the vegetable world, particularly the 
arbutus and the different aloes. Cintra, so 
lately the scene of British triumph, with its 
fantastic rocks, high towering pines, simple 
cottages, and universal novelty of character, 
bad also many charms for them ; but a very

short time served to prove that it would be 
impossible tor the invalid to remain there. 
The total want of cleanliness, the utter im- 
possibility of* obtaining any food, or vessels in 
which to prepare food, which were not satu- 
rated with garlie, to which our patient had an 
unconquerable aversion, proved that no beau- 
ties of nature can compensate to a sick man 
for the want of those home comforts which 
arc to him the necessaries of life. Emma 
was indefatigable, as a nurse, a friend, a me- 
nial, but no diligence could guard him from 
the ills which produced sleepless nights and 
days of loathing, even in a place that might 
have been made an earthly paradise, and 
served strongly to remind them of that be- 
loved home for which each sighed in secret. 
When they returned to Lisbon, Emma de- 
termined to seek for lodgings within a short 
distance of the city ; and she probably might 
soon have succeeded, but for the perpetual 
alarm excited in the mind of James, their 
servant, who conceived that every native in 
the vicinity of Lisbon was an assassin, and 
the inhabitants only so far better as the resi- 
dence of a few English soldiers still remain- 
ing compelled them to be. Never did poor

James return from an enforced excursion 
without encountering some real or imaginary 
evil, and his stories and comments greatly 
added to the difficulties which at this period 
harassed the mind of his vouns; mistress, for 
whom, it is certain, the honest man would 
have shed his blood, though he could not 
restrain his tongue. She every day dreaded 
that her father would suddenly resolve to re- 
turn, as the increasing heat annoyed him 
excessively, and until she received remit- 
tances from England, it was not possible for 
her to do so without forming acquaintance in 
the city amongst their countrymen, which 
neither party were well qualified to do, espe- 
cially for such a purpose. 
Tis true, letters had reached them from 
Eulalie giving an account of the marriage of 
Harriet, and her departure for Buxton, (which 
she took in her route to Liverpool,) from 
whence she intended to write to her father; but 
this letter threw no light on the want of that 
supply from Charles, which, important as the 
marriage of her sister might be, was a cir- 
cumstance more immediately pressing, for 
think what we may, the troubles of sentiment 
are less grievous than those of poverty, and

in some situations want of cash is actual po- 
verty. Besides, Emma had looked at her 
sister's marriage so dctcrminately, and con- 
templated it so long, that she had become 
familiarized with it, and ceased to regard it 
as an affliction. She now simply wished her 
sister happy, acquitted her of all intentional 
un kindness, though she could not of blame- 
able thoughtlessness, towards her, and this she 
feared was again in some way operating to 
her disadvantage, at the present time. 
One day as she sat anxiously gazing on her 
father, who lay on the sofa in the half slum- 
bering state by which an invalid escapes 
from that enquiring eye he cannot satisfac- 
torily answer, tracing with sinking heart the 
wasting power of disease on those beloved 
features, she was startled by sounds from be- 
low, which approached every moment nearer, 
and were likely to disturb the sleeper. She 
stepped hastily to the door of the apartment, 
and beheld, with surprise and terror, poor 
James covered with dust and blood, supported 
between two strangers, and followed by two 
English sailors, who loudly vociferated 
against those who had perpetrated the injury 
he had received.

" What is the matter? oh ! heavens, is it 
James?" cried Emma, tremblingly. 
" Ah Miss, I always said as how the pa- 
pishes would do for me  and so for certain 
they would if this here gentleman had'nt 
helped me; not but I'm as good as dead 
now, I'm a murdered man  I am, I am." 
" Pshaw, pshaw, my good fellow," said the 
person on whom he rested, " you are worth 
many a dead man yet ; don't alarm the lady, 
nor disgrace your country." 
By this time, to the great distress of Emma. 
Mr. Carysford had risen from the sofa, and 
with his usual affection and sympathy ap- 
proached his servant, who was more over- 
powered by his master's condolences than by 
his previous injuries. One of the persons as- 
sisting James was the surgeon of an English 
vessel in the Tagus, and having taken the 
poor man to his own room, he examined his 
wounds, which were a stab in the back and a 
violent bruise on the leg, neither of which 
were dangerous, though both were likely to 
prove of long continuance in the confinement 
they might inflict. After the lapse of an 
hour, which was one of great anxiety to 
Emma, not only a:i account of James, but

her father, Mr. C.irysford returned to the 
room he had quitted to attend the examina- 
tion of his servant's injuries, leaning upon the 
gentleman who had been his defender, and 
whom he announced to Emma " as her coun- 
tryman, and one to whom they owed the 
highest obligations for his courage and hu 
inanity." 
" My name is Charles Melville  Lieute- 
nant Melville of the Marines, in war time,

Emma's looks and movement showed that 
the stranger had her heartfelt thanks, but her 
first words were those of enquiry as to James's 
state. 
" He is in very good hands, and will do 
very well ; but will 1 fear be confined some 
weeks."

" Unluckily, Ma'am, a man may have a 
thousand good qualities with a bad taste ; 
and some bad and even diabolical ones with 
a good one. It is a well known fact, that 
during those horrible scenes in the French 
revolution, (when human blood was shed 
uith a ferocious avidity the heart sickens to 
remember,) some victims, who to avoid the 
musquetry sheltered themselves behind the 
statues in the gardens of the Tuilleries, were 
in some instances consigned to the bayonet 
instead of the bullet, lest the sculpture should 
be injured  James, it appears, had a very 
different propensity ; he was much more at- 
tached to men than statues." 
" Surely he has not been doing mischief," 
said his master. 
" Not exactly, but he aided and abetted 
those who did ; and they happening to be 
sailors, who are persons the inhabitants do 
not care to meddle with, they wreaked their 
vengeance on poor James, and would have 
done it  " 
" More effectually but for you, my dear 
Sir  in fact, they intended to murder him ; I 
fear indeed he has some personal enemies 
in the place," said Mr. Carysford.

" Only one, I take it  himself. Tis true, 
he told me that he had never struck oil" even 
a single finger of a virgin, for his master's 
sake, who had he knew a sort of natural 
liking to those kind of dumb creatures ; hut 
he admitted playing a few tricks upon the 
monks, which were any thing but courteous." 
The last fervent wish of Emma's heart, 
when this distressing accident interrupted the 
current of her thoughts, had been that she 
were on her way to England ; but although 
the circumstance rendered such an event 
more than ever desirable, the evening closed, 
and the stranger departed without its recur- 
rence. Her father was evidently so pleased 
and amused by his new acquaintance, that 
(since his fears for James had subsided) he 
had not passed the same length of time for 
many days with so much apparent ease, and 
those evening hours, which she had so often 
found melancholy from their loneliness, and 
painful from the useless sympathy thev 
awakened, were gone she knew not how. 
The stranger had indeed not only entitled 
himself to be considered their friend, by the 
prompt assistance and the continued kindness 
he had extended to James, in procuring hiiu

the best surgical aid and witnessing its ap- 
plication, but be claimed a species of old 
acquaintance with them from having once 
been at the house of Miss Tintagell, where 
he saw Miss Carysford, and thought her the 
most beautiful creature he had then ever 
seen, but he added, in mentioning the cir- 
cumstance, " she will have forgotten me. 
Young ladies in the full bloom of eighteen, 
consider young men of that age as mere 
boys, and I recollect that we were men- 
tioned as being exactly of the same age  
since then I have been in various climates, 
and seen some service." 
Emma saw the truth of this assertion, in 
the deep brown which gave a veteran air to 
the lower part of his face, but in the white- 
ness and smoothness of his forehead, it was 
evident that he could not be more than 
twenty-five  the circumstance reminded her 
however of a fact, which accounted for a 
good deal of that which appeared hasty in 
Harriet's decision and marriage, for if she 
were an admired belle seven years ago, with 
her love of admiration it was natural that she 
should seek to attract in a new character. 
She mentioned her sister as married, which

Mr. Melville considered as a tiling of course : 
be informed them, with marks of great sensi- 
bility in his manner of unfolding the cir- 
cumstances, that he was now at Lisbon, as 
joint attendant, with an uncle who had been 
to him a parent, upon a dear and very amia- 
ble cousin, who was an only child, and in 
whose welfare that of the parent was na- 
turally involved. 
There was in this gentleman a singular 
and happy intermixture of that frankness 
which distinguishes sea-faring men, that 
elegance we expect in an officer, and the 
fine taste which belongs to the scholar 
and the man of research. In consequence 
of this characteristic, he found himself most 
happy in the society of Mr. Carysford, 
whose refined taste and abundant informa- 
tion, promised to supply the many wants of 
an ardent mind, prevented by duties and 
circumstances from supplying its own de- 
mands for knowledge. But with this desire 
of profiting from the fountain before him, 
there was blended such an intimate knowledge 
of the weakness of the speaker, such a 
tender and almost feminine care of the inva- 
lid, as to touch the heart of Emma with the

most lively gratitude. It soon indeed became 
evident to them both, that Mr. Melville had 
trained himself to be the companion of a 
sick man's hours, that he spoke more at some 
times than was customary or agreeable to 
him, in order to obviate the pain of si- 
lence, or the necessity of breaking it to 
the sufferer, and that at others he could, with- 
out ennui or awkwardness, observe for a long 
period the most perfect stillness. The milder 
and the stronger elements were indeed so 
combined in him as to " give the world as- 
surance of a man," formed by nature and 
education in the happiest temperament. 
It may be supposed that he came again, 
and again, under the present circumstances 
of the family ; more especially as he for some 
time sought to bring those offenders to justice, 
whose mal-treatment of James so well me- 
rited cognizance. 
In this pursuit he did not proceed, for 
finding that either no punishment would be 
exacted, or one which included death by 
torture, the bare idea of which was alike 
abhorrent to the sufferer, and his champion, 
all prosecution was dropped. 
In the course of the discussions which
## p. 142 (#150) ############################################
142 MODERATION. 
arose out of this subject, Mr. Melville 
discovered not only the kind intentions 
which spring from an amiable, considerate 
disposition, but the principles which arise 
from a firm conviction in the truths of 
Christianity, a sincere love for its laws, as 
divulged in the religion of his country, 
and that unshrinking profession of it, which 
was the result of a manly spirit and a well 
informed mind. Yet whilst reasoning or 
enquiring from his revered friend on sub- 
jects where he was necessarily still a pupil, 
nothing could exceed the teachableness of 
mind he evinced, or the pleasure with which 
he hailed the knowledge which cleared a 
dubious point, and braced the sinews of 
feeble conviction ; and often would he leave 
them with that grateful sparkling of the eve, 
that cordial yet lingering grasp of the hand, 
which at once denoted how hard it was to 
qnit them, yet how sensible he was, that he 
departed mentally enriched and refreshed. 
The wound in James's back, which had been 
the principal cause of alarm, healed sooner 
than could have been expected, but that in 
his leg threatened incurable lameness, and 
the poor man suffered much in his general

health, from the grief of knowing himself a 
burden to that beloved master and idolized 
mistress, who now so much needed his ser- 
vices. Every time that master visited his 
couch, the ravages of disease were more per- 
ceptible, and often would the eyes of James 
fill with tears as Emma approached to en- 
quire "how he had rested," from his know- 
ledge of the excessive fatigue she was en- 
during, and which no person but himself 
could partake with her. The great heats, 
which now became general, prevented Mr. 
Melville from giving them much time, as 
they understood him that his cousin was 
rendered worse by them, and that his uncle 
Sir Grindley Melville, from anxiety and the 
languor consequent on the climate, was also 
very unwell. This great source of amusement 
and consolation failing them, again Emma's 
powers were taxed to the utmost, at a time 
when the daily uneasiness she experienced 
on pecuniary matters was greatly augmented 
from increased delay, added to which her 
expenses were doubled by the illness of 
James. 
Yet there was a certain consolation in the 
belief, that if only for a few minutes, yet

the evening would not pass without seeing 
their friend; and that although his intelligent 
countenance might tell them on his entrance 
how much he was suffering from sorrow and 
apprehension, yet in their society he too 
would taste of that solace he bestowed, and 
in the intercourse of friendship find the re- 
ward of kindness. Mr. Carysford was now 
evidently growing every day so weak that to 
all save Emma he appeared on the very verge 
of existence ; but she still felt as all others 
do, who watch the progress of that insidious 
and llattering disease  she could not believe 
that a beinu; in which the fire of intellect 
still burned so brightly, in whom devotion 
was so ardent, affection to every human 
connection so active, could be on the brink of 
dissolution; she saw all his weakness, she was 
aware of all his symptoms, nor was it the 
first time in which she had tended the bed of 
slow disease and eventual death, but the 
young heart refuses to admit the reality of 
that which it dreads. A thousand visionary 
hopes, and miraculous interpositions, float in 
the fancy to cheat us from that contemplation 
of sorrow which would unfit us for the duty 
to which we devote ourselves under such cir-

cumstances, and doubtless it is a merciful 
disposition in our nature, that woman, a

constantly called to witness the most painful 
scenes, and encounter the severest trials, 
should find " her strength made perfect in her 
weakness," and her power of cheering and 
sustaining man, arise from her blindness to 
the future, her power of nursing hope in de- 
spite of probability, and assuming smiles 
when her heart is wrung by sorrows. 
Yet there were times when Emma could 
not deceive herself, when she felt that she 
must be soon an orphan, was conscious also 
that she should be left in a strange land, 
without friends or money ; but this was of less 
consideration than another point continually 
pressing on her mind; "should her father die 
without making due provision on that point, 
his valuable living would be lost to Charles, 
and in all probability be the means of en- 
tirely overturning his prospects of future 
life." She was the more anxious on this 
point, because as they had received no let- 
ters from her eldest sister since her marriage, 
which argued most blameable neglect, her 
mind was led to consider her future hap-

piness as immediately linked with a brother, 
always especially clear, but of late more so 
than ever, on account of his penitence, affec- 
tion, and good conduct. With all her lather's 
excellent qualities he was not a man of busi- 
ness, though a man of the most strict inte- 
grity and upright intention. Every day, every 
hour, so far as his weak state admitted, it 
might be said that he was preparing for his 
great change, yet so unequal did he evident- 
ly feel to parting with his children, that very 
seldom could he trust himself to advert to it. 
" Could she, his child, dare to infringe on the 
sacred silence it was his wish to preserve ? 
could she by any act or word tear away the 
veil in which the pious aspirations or the pro- 
found sensibility of his nature was now en- 
shrouded ?" 
Again the packet arrived, but it contained 
only a letter from Sophia, in which was an 
enclosure of fifty pounds ; considered as a re- 
mittance, such a trifle was rather a mockery 
than a relief: but it appeared in a very 
different point of view, as Emma proceeded 
with the letter, for it proved to be simply a 
present, made by one sister to another, in 
consideration of her increased expenses,

thereby denoting that, for the first time, So- 
phia had given due consideration to worldly 
affairs and to family affection. On proceed- 
ing, she learnt with great surprise that her 
brother had received such pressing letters 
from Miss Tintagell, to join her at Nice, and 
proceed with her and Lord Alfreton to Italy, 
that he had set out for that purpose ; which he 
was the more inclined to do both because Sir 
Marmaduke Lyster advised it, and that it 
would be in his power to join them at Lisbon, 
as he trusted, before winter, for " to tell you 
the truth," she added, " he never has ceased 
to lament the circumstance which prevented 
his accompanying you." 
A postscript mentioned the having just 
received a letter from Emma, in which she 
complained of Charles. " You will of 
course," added Sophia, " have received the 
letters of credit that my sister Wilmington 
had for you, before this time, and what I 
have told you accounts for the rest." 
This letter was put into Emma's hands by 
Mr. Melville, who, knowing her extreme anx- 
iety to hear from England, had procured the 
letters from the pacquet ; perceiving the air 
of deep disappointment and alarm with

which she regarded the inclosed check, he 
instantly conceived that want of money was 
amongst the evils pressing upon her mind, 
and began anxiously to cast about in his 
own the possibility of relieving it. 
" I hope all your friends are well, Miss 
Carysford, my old acquaintance amongst the 
rest ? " 
" She is so, I hope ; but I have no letters 
from her, and have a right to complain of 
negligence cither from her or her husband." 
A slight blush rose on Emma's cheek as 
she pronounced the last words, which Mel- 
ville placed to the account of anger, and so 
fully was he persuaded that Captain Wil- 
mington had done exceedingly wrong, before 
he could have awakened such an indication 
of offence from a mind so gentle and regu- 
lated as hers, that his own warm though ex- 
cellent temper became indignant, and he 
exclaimed, 
" Neglect you ! if he neglects you, he has 
not merited the honour of marrying your 
sister  it is well for both him and me that 
the sea is between us." 
" Perhaps I am wrong, but  I have suf- 
fered so much of late in various ways, that

perhaps I do not judge fairly  you shall 
fight no battles for me, Mr. Melville." 
" Your father calls me Charles, and he 
says it is pleasant to him when you do so." 
" Well then, Charles," said Emma, offering 
her hand, as if to soothe the momentary 
petulance of a heart she had known long 
enough to understand and honour, almost to 
love. 
Melville seized on that fair hand with the 
same fond avidity with which he often gazed 
on her countenance, and listened to her 
words ; he even half raised it to his lips, but 
as suddenly relinquished it, and Emma felt at 
that moment as if all the kindly emotions of 
her nature were relinquished also; it was 
with the utmost difficulty that she concealed 
the sense of desolation and renunciation 
which seemed suddenly to seize upon her. 
Both were for a short time silent, but Mel- 
ville, as by a violent effort, compelled himself 
to speak, and the tones of his voice, the deep 
interest it was evident he still took in her, 
the touching respect and even tender affec- 
tion of his looks, restored her mind to the 
calm, though pensive tone he had disturbed

his eyes bent towards the door by which it 
was probable Mr. Carysf'ord would soon 
enter. 
" If, then, I am Charles if I am honoured 
with being as much a brother to you as a son 
to your revered father, (who may indeed 
claim me for one in the Itigliest, in the scrip- 
tural, sense of the word,) surely there is not 
any thing in my power to do for you, Emma, 
that you will deny me  can I not supply the 
neglect to which you allude ? are vou sure 
that I cannot be of use to you in some way 
of business ?" 
" You are very kind, but I have so main* 
things" 
As Emma spoke, the tears long gathering 
fell from her eyes freely  could she have 
looked up, she would have seen that those 
eyes so fondly bent upon her were also full 
of tears.

" My dear Miss Carysford, why did you 
not speak to me sooner ? I could have told 
you, for I knew two months since, that every 
thing necessary for your brother's safety was 
settled through the medium of a Mr. Evans, 
but bevond this I know nothing. This is 
not a time for unnecessary delicacies." 
" Oh, thank you, thank you ! that is all 
I wanted to know, all I desired on such 
points ; I ought not to have doubled my fa- 
ther ; I ought not to sink in this way." 
" But this is not all ; you must want mo- 
ney, for you have never sent me to the bank- 
er's ; and I will not wrong your confidence in 
me so far as to believe you would employ 
another  there is a coincidence in our situ- 
ation and our feelings, that should compel 
you to make a friend of me, a brother." 
Emma wiped her eyes, and ventured to 
gaze for a moment on that open, honest 
countenance, which although at this time 
fraught with anxiety amounting to impa- 
tience, and with agitation not devoid of re- 
proach, yet to her mind's eye exhibited all 
things most kind, and delicate, and honour- 
able, and she hastily answered,

nance brightening as he spoke, " but we 
have only just escaped a most dreadful mis- 
fortune, for I am come to announce  " 
At this moment Mr. Carysford entered 
from the chamber adjoining, where his pri- 
vate devotions had held him during the only 
time when by day and night his daughter was 
not near him. He now stooped over the 
staff on which he leaned, like a very aged 
man, his hair had changed from the be- 
sprinkled grey to glossy white, and his con- 
tracted chest and hollow cheeks bespoke that

shrinking of the muscles, that withering of 
the flesh, in which the beauty and the 
strength of man show like a fading flower. 
But a stream of glory seemed to irradiate 
his eyes as he gazed delightedly on the 
young pair before him, whose earnest con- 
versation and confused countenances (a con- 
fusion naturally arising from the subject) 
undoubtedly conveyed to him a very differ- 
ent idea, for before he essayed to offer the 
gladdened welcome which always sprung to 
his lips on sight of Melville, he silently, 
but with uplifted hands, invoked a benedic- 
tion on them both, from that God with 
whom he had probably been already in- 
terceding on their behalf. 
After the usual enquiries had taken place, 
and the state of the barometer had been dis- 
cussed, Mr. Melville proceeded to say that 
a removal Ions; talked of was now determined 
upon on his uncle's part, and since the dear 
invalid no longer objected, he believed they 
should set sail for Madeira in a few days. 
" Most sincerely do I hope the voyage may 
prove advantageous. I once thought I should 
have liked to go thither myself, but that is

tions  " 
-Mr. Melville rose from his scat overpowered 
by affecting recollections, and more acutely 
awakened fears for the life of one to whom 
it was evident he was bound by ties more 
strong than those of blood  that his friend- 
ship was of the most ardent kind, that it 
began in the dawn of life, had been strength- 
ened by similarity of character, and recipro- 
city of affection, they could have no doubt, 
since the few observations he ever allowed 
himself to make uniformly proved it. Per- 
haps the excess of his attachment and his 
sympathy was also the more evident to his 
present auditors, from his generally saying 
very little on this subject. They had each 
n marked that whilst he spoke much of his 
uncle, and deeply sympathized with his griefs,

yet he seldom actually named his cousin   
this might be equally accounted for by the 
delicate attention due to Mr. Carysford, as an 
invalid unequal to hearing his own complaints 
descanted upon, and the incapacity the re- 
later felt to touch upon the situation of one 
held in such especial love and esteem. 
Yet whatever might be the friendship felt 
for his cousin, the paternal veneration in 
which his uncle was held, it was evident the 
bond which drew Mr. Melville's affections to 
our father and daughter, was likewise insu- 
perably strong  his shortest visit still beheld 
him remain beyond his first intention, and the 
pleasure which danced in his eyes even when 
sympathetic drops lingered on the lids, at 
those times when he could sit a few hours 
with them, bespoke a divided interest, a 
heart wedded to the new friends not less than 
the old ones. That he never lost sight of 
them for an hour, was evinced in the books, 
the music, or the news by which he sought 
to besmile their tedious hours, the fruit and 
the confectionary he so constantly brought, 
the extraordinary pains he took for the re- 
covery of their servant, and the search he 
made for others who might supply his ser-

vices. In all this, Mr. Carysford read very 
naturally not only pity and general benevo- 
lence of character operating with regard to 
himself, but the excitement given by a more 
warm and tender sentiment for his daughter

for one so young, so lovely, and singularly at- 
tractive by her situation and the many virtues 
she displayed in it. 
it would be folly to deny, that Emma her- 
self (modest and unassuming as she always 
was, and even distrustful of her own powers 
of attraction as she had lately become) had 
an intuitive sense that the preference and 
admiration she could not withhold from one 
so valuable and amiable, was returned. For 
some time she had a kind of confidence in his 
friendship, a sense of repose on his guardian- 
ship, which did not go beyond ameliorating 
her solitude, and imparting the sensations na- 
tural to a sister, or, as she considered them, of 
an Englishwoman in a foreign land. When 
the entire love and esteem of her father for 
his young countryman quickened her percep- 
tion of his good qualities, and the many con- 
versations which developed his principles, 
his disposition, and his information  then

Emma found herself in Desdemona's situa- 
tion, she wished " that heaven had made her 
such a man." It was also evident at some 
times that her father so wished, and in the 
extreme guilelessness of his nature his thoughts 
were generally so apparent, that Emma at 
some moments feared they might be read by 
Mr. Melville, at others she was led to con- 
clude that certain conversations had already 
passed between them, which were only kept 
secret from her on account of the distressing 
situation in which they were all placed  a 
situation in which it was evident there must 
be no " marrying, nor giving in marriage." 
That Mr. Melville was sometimes under a 
pressure of painful solicitude, distinct from 
his grief for his cousin's illness, and his 
sympathy for his uncle, she could not doubt 
from the vague answers she would sometimes 
receive from him; but she was also sensible 
that from the relief to sad thoughts he evi- 
dently gained in their society, it could 
not be of a verxj distressing nature. Some- 
times she fancied he might be, like herself, 
under pecuniary embarrassment; but this idea 
had ground but a short time. The projected 
voyage to Madeira began next to be talked

of, and from her own feelings she judged 
that it was a very painful subject of thought ; 
and such was the flutter of spirits it awakened, 
that for some days she avoided as much as 
possible remaining in the room during the 
time of those visits now doublv dear and 
important. 
It was not difficult to effect this even by 
the visitant's desire  he knew that her couch 
was now in the same apartment with her 
father's, who complained how much he dis- 
turbed her, and would say, " now our dear 
Charles is come, try to get a little sleep, 
Emma," a request constantly seconded by 
him who had already perhaps scanned her 
with an alarmed or pitying eye. Ah! how 
often has she retired speedily, to hide the 
swellings of a heart ready to break!  how 
often has she thrown herself on the couch, 
not to sleep, but to weep! 
W hen circumstances forbade Mr. Melville 
to remain more than a single hour, and the 
attentions of Emma were also more demand- 
ed, still would the considerate father seek to 
render her a partaker in those benefits be- 
stowed by his presence. " My poor Emma 
languishes for want of air," he would say,

MODERATION. 169 
" take her, dear Charles, if but for ten mi- 
nutes, into the lemon tree-avenue." 
There were many times when Emma de- 
clined this, from a dread that her father's 
words should be misinterpreted ; a fear that 
explanation might take place, which was 
yet not always perhaps unmingled with a 
hope that the certain something, which every 
day increased, would so far reveal itself as to 
become a thing intelligible, however distant. 
These walks, though taken under those cir- 
cumstances most likely to bring such an 
event to pass, always left Emma more in the 
dark than ever. There was a garden behind 
the hotel, in which a fine fountain threw up 
ten thousand sparkling drops, which cooled 
all the atmosphere around it ; an atmosphere 
impregnated by the odours of a thousand 
fragrant plants, and the road to which was 
bordered by lemon trees now full of fruit. 
The evening breeze, an hour after sunset, 
played sweetly in this lovely spot, which was 
secluded from all observation, though so near 
the house as to admit of a summons to Emma 
from the balcony of her father's chamber  it 
was evident that tender things might be 
heard and answered, tears might flow and

blushes arise, unseen and unreproved ; and 
hearts burthened by many sources of uneasi- 
ness might here give and receive the conso- 
lation of confidence and mutual support. 
But rarely, from the moment on which 
Emma had thrown her veil around her, did 
that voice, which was music to her ear and 
solace to her soul, continue its power to 
soothe her, much less seek from her that sa- 
tisfaction it was surely possible she might 
give ! No ! that kind voice which had been 
so long employed in reading, or speaking to 
the invalid, was suddenly mute, that store of 
information, that ready communication of 
circumstance or sentiment, was checked ; yet 
it was evident that the fountain was not dry, 
nor the will to be kind exhausted  evident 
also, that consolation was required, that he 
who had exerted himself for others was ear- 
nestly desiring pity, yet could not ask for it. 
True, there were moments when the sweets 
of external nature seemed suddenly to infuse 
themselves into the very spirits of two young 
persons so calculated to feel, in their utmosc 
extent, whatever could affect their sensibility, 
and pour into their hearts that comfort for 
which both looked on high. Moments in

which silence was not restraint, and sighs 
breathed more of gratitude for the temporary 
blessing experienced, than grief for the con- 
stant affliction under which they laboured. 
They tasted at once of happiness in that 
deep, but silent certainty of loving, which 
creates a quiet repose in the heart predisposed 
by sorrow to feel its own necessity for such 
support, more sweet and pure than those 
under circumstances of felicity, perhaps, 
have ever tasted. Sometimes Melville would 
stop a moment and look earnestly at Emma, 
and she would half throw back her veil, cast 
her eyes timidly down, and seem willing to 
listen, and able to listen calmly ; but he 
spoke not, or only adverted to the poetical 
beauty of all around them, the glorious arch 
of heaven above them, and thence to the dis- 
tant tinklings of the convent bell, the vesper 
hymn floating on the perfumed breeze ; and 
then bade her suddenly good night.

After the conversation we have related, it 
may be concluded that Emma was speedily 
relieved from that perpetually harassing cir- 
cumstance which had so long distressed her ; 
and, with his usual delicacy, Mr. Melville 
made his uncle the medium of her conveni- 
ence, in consequence of which, several letters 
passed between her and that gentleman; but 
as his residence was two miles distant, and 
his health much affected bv his uneasiness, 
she had not any personal interview. 
At this time, Mr. Carysford frequently la- 
mented that they had not any other acquaint- 
ance who might, in a slight degree, repair 
the loss they must so soon encounter, in the 
removal of the only English family the^y 
knew, even by name ; but Emma always 
entreated him with so much earnestness not 
to lament it on her account, that he began to 
trust she was not less capable of that firmness

and fortitude her situation called for, than that 
unbounded activity of kindness and consi- 
deration she had so lono; evinced. 
It had been for some time the custom of 
Emma to read those Prayers for the Sick, 
with her father in the evenings, which he 
had formerly so often read with other suf- 
ferers, and to which he could always listen 
with a spirit of devotion, not the less fervent 
because those beautiful forms of prayer were 
familiar to him, and of late James was enabled 
also to creep into his beloved master's cham- 
ber on these occasions. Melville was not 
only privileged to share their devotions, but 
if present he frequently took the office of 
reader with the same holy vigilance that he 
shared that of nurse, and seldom perhaps have 
" two or three been gathered together," so 
distinct in age, character, and situation, 
whose prayers ascended with more fervor, or 
whose faith was more pure and stedfast  all

them together was on the point of dissolution

if such had been the sentiments affecting 
the party, how much stronger did they be-

one strong, the one powerful to act, to think, 
to sustain the rest  the one, apparently sent,

himself, was called to fulfil more immediate 
obligations, and resumed when he was most

it were when he was most needed, and when

said, or wept very audibly ; and scarcely could

betraying grief for his own expected loss 
in Melville, he endeavoured to account for it 
by a better cause than that of selfishness. 
" Whenever the Captain goes, it will be all 
over with my poor master, that's all I think 
about  it is'nt that the sight on him does 
my heart good, coming so free and kind- 
hearted to an old servant, nor it is'nt his 
driving off the rapskallions that murdered me, 
like a brave soldier as I shall always call 
him  no, no, what I fret about is altogether 
for his worship." 
Happily this trial, his last, and in the pre- 
sent state of his attenuated frame and weak- 
ened mind, one of no little import, was met 
by the dying christian, with that meek acqui- 
escence, that unruffled harmony of patience 
and temper, which well became the disciple 
of a crucified Lord. Subduing every disposi- 
tion to complain of untoward circumstances, 
to express a single wish to retain him, though 
a sigh would arise when he had observed the 
wind was favourable for their voyage, it was 
never followed by one half-murmured com- 
plaint. With a heart naturally so warmly 
attached and now closely tied to few objects 
only, with sensibility so acute, and rendered

now more exquisitely so from the powers 
of the mind becoming enfeebled, no conduct 
could mure fully evince the grateful hu- 
mility, the complete self-control, and the en- 
tire annihilation of selfish feelings. Ah! how 
much more of the " spirit of Christ" might 
be read in the hastily wiped tear, in the 
cheering tone of Mr. Carysford, than in the 
boastings of many who would stigmatize him 
as a stranger to its divine influence. 
One morning, when alter many farewells 
which had yet not proved the last, and had 
therefore tended to convey the idea that " after 
all perhaps the Melvilles would not go," Emma 
in reply to his enquiries said, "the wind was 
favourable so far as there was any, but the 
weather was dreadfully sultry." 
"Then they will go this morning, I hope  
the poor young man will be better at sea  " 
" He will," said Emma, but she could say 
no more, the "hope" would not be uttered; it 
stuck, like the " amen" of the murderous 
Macbeth, in her throat, but with far different 
sensations in its company. 
" Well, well," said the good father, after 
a long pause, " his trill be done. 1 may Bay, 
Emma, with the Psalmist, ' very pleasant hast

in truth, ' goodness and mercy' were sin- 
gularly manifested in lending us such a com- 
forter : if God resume his gifts, we must re- 
member it is our duty 
' To praise him for all that is past, 
' And trust hiiii for all that's to come.' " 
" I wish," said Emma, with difficulty, 
" poor James may be able to do so ; he really 
idolizes the Captain, (as he will call him,) and 
has borrowed a pair of crutches, I find, and 
set out an hour ago to take one more look of 
his deliverer  he is the most affectionate, 
the most attached creature  there never was 
such a man, I am very certain." 
Perhaps we have no right to look too 
closely into the recesses of that sweet mai- 
den's heart, as she thus used James in lawful 
service, nor to inquire too curiously whether 
her last exclamation of praise, and the gush- 
ing tears which accompanied it, were ap- 
plicable to the man of whom she sj?oke, or 
the man of whom she thought  it is enough 
to say, that, although by no means pleased

mingled with blushes, she turned towards the 
window from whence she had already seen 
distant streamers often consulted of late ; at 
the same moment, a well known tap was 
heard at the door, and, in another moment, 
Melville once more entered. 
Mr. Carysford was laid upon a sofa near 
the balcony, with his back to the door, and 
did not hear the low tremulous tap, now 
more faint than ever, for it resembled the feel- 
ings of the visitant. He caught the tear- 
covered visage of Emma, when he ventured 
to step forward, and exclaimed, 
" In tears, my dear Miss Carysford?" 
" We thought you were gone." 
This might be an exclamation already on 
the lips of Emma, occasioned by seeing him 
it might be an answer, and the quick blush, 
the quicker drops that fell glistening down 
her cheeks, proved that, whether it were or 
not, his supposed absence had occasioned 
the present emotion. For a moment a look 
of joy, of gratitude, too great for utterance, 
rose on his animated countenance ; he took 
her hand, and seemed about to thank her for 
this indication of an interest so dear, so i/tcs- 
iimable, as he evidently felt it: but it ap-

peared that it was only to lead her towards 
the couch, that she might announce him, as 
she was wont to do,  his conduct was inex- 
plicable, she thought it almost cruel, but she 
recovered herself instantly by a strong effort. 
" My dear Sir, your friend is come once 
more to see you." 
" Ah ! Charles again ! my son ! at least 
my son's best substitute, I had not hoped for 
this pleasure." 
As Mr. Carysford spoke, tears of delight 
swam in his too brilliant eyes; he raised him- 
self eagerly, but, notwithstanding the ex- 
citement he experienced, fell back upon his 
pillow, and it was evident to Mr. Melville, 
not only that his exhaustion was extreme, 
but that the thin, trembling hands with which 
he sought to press those of his beloved visit- 
ant, were more feverish than he had ever 
known them. He turned his eyes to commu- 
nicate the apprehensions he felt to Emma, 
but her looks were averted, nor could he 
desire they should be otherways, and he 
therefore began to speak in that hasty man- 
ner which was meant at once to hide his 
emotions, and, if possible, subdue them.

day is so dreadfully sultry, some hours must 
pass before  before my cousin can be re- 
moved ; when the sun declines, we shall ven-

as James has, 1 find, played the truant so far 
as to come down to us, and Sir Grindly Mel- 
ville is delighted with him, he desired leave 
to keep him till we had set sail." 
" By all means ; Emma, my love, you can 
spare him, indeed the poor man can do no- 
thing for us you know?" 
" Nothing," said Emma. 
" My dear Sir, in making this request, I 
merely acquitted myself of a promise ; you 
are very unwell to-day, James ought to be 
with you, I had much rather he were : are 
you certain I can be of no further use to 
you?" 
" Oh no, you have sent me stores for a 
magazine of invalids ; you can do nothing 
for me save sitting down beside Emmy and 
allowing me to look at you a little longer." 
The thick and altered voice of the invalid 
thrilled the heart of Melville, but it was evi- 
dent that Emma did not perceive it  evident 
that she felt to a certain degree surprised

and offended, yet not resentful, that the re- 
membrance that this was their last meeting, 
quenched the fire of anger though it could 
not allay its pain. To say how severe the 
pangs of his heart were for having raised such 
discordant feelings in that kind and gentle 
bosom is impossible, and if Emma had cast 
her eyes upon him, his ingenuous counte- 
nance would (in despite of even the efforts of 
his manly mind) have shown her how terrible 
a struggle was passing there. As it was, the 
daughter sat near him and saw him not, the 
father never ceased to gaze upon him, thereby 
increasing his distress, yet somewhat chang- 
ing its object. 
The entrance of a servant with the patient's 
broth, broke up the mournful and silent com- 
pany. Melville once more pressed the hand 
which would never more return that pressure, 
and the drops which fell on it so far softened 
Emma's heart, that hers too was yielded once 
more to the farewell kiss.  
All was still silent  Melville was now 
gone  the hoofs of his mule's last pattering 
had ceased, and Emma enquired "why she 
had been deceived in the first place, or angry 
in the second,  why she had been so agitated

at all,"  she was ashamed, angry with herself, 
hut her tears again ilowcd. 
" Emma, I cannot take this hroth to day  
remove it." Emma obeyed, and on casting 
her eyes over that emaciated form, wondered 
how she could for a moment think on any 
other subject, she hastily wiped her eyes, 
and blamed herself "for being childish and 
nervous." 
" You are neither, dear Emma, for you have 
that quiet fortitude, and general equality of 
temper, which becomes you as a woman, and 
is honourable to you as a christian  but it is 
natural that vou should lament a loss of so 
much importance to us both  would that 
your brother were here, my love ; I should be 
glad to see Charles, very, very glad, and my 
sister Tintagell too  poor Alathea! I love 
Alathea, she is a noble minded creature." 
" And Harriet and Sophia, father? you wish 
for them too, dear Sir?" 
" I do  yet were they here I should soon 
send all away but you, Emma  they would 
talk too much or too little ; do too much or 
too little ; but you my child, arc always right,

ment prompts  never man was so supported, 
so blest as I have been in you and Charles." 
Emma enquired not " which Charles ?" 
thought not which Charles, for the altered 
voice now struck her as it had struck Mel- 
ville, and her heart sunk within her, and she 
sat in silence, waiting for she knew not what 
of new trial. 
After a considerable period, she perceived 
that her father had fallen asleep, and even 
when she drew near and wiped his forehead 
he did not awake, it was a more composing 
and general rest, than he had lately experi- 
enced, and the more desirable on account 
of the extraordinary heat of the day, which 
was such as to excite some alarming obser- 
vations from the servants of the house, as if 
it were the forerunner of earthquake. 
As she sat watching the sleeper, she recol- 
lected them, in such a way as if this were 
the first moment in which she had had time 
to think on earthquakes ; to remember that 
she was on the spot where that most tre- 
mendous and appalling of all heaven's minis- 
ters of wrath had been exhibited in its most 
destructive form, and that she might shortly 
become its victim.

" I must conquer this fear before it has 
time to fasten on my mind," said Emma, 
" 1 must pray against it, read against it, 
I must caution the servants not to speak 
in my father's presence." 
She left the room on tiptoe for that pur- 
pose, and as she was universally beloved as 
the best of daughters, and the most amiable 
of heretics, easily obtained a promise " that 
the sick gentleman should not be disturbed 
by any painful surmises," which promise in- 
cluded equal caution as to James, who was 
well known to have no secrets with his 
master. On returning, she had still the satis- 
faction to find her father continued to sleep, 
and she even took her soup and omelette with- 
out disturbing him. it was evident that he 
had less fever than he had had for some 
months, nor could she recollect the dav when 
he had coughed so little, and slept so sweetly. 
" Was it possible that some internal change 
had taken place on which hope might build? 
had the thickness of his voice, the increased 
weakness of the morning, been occasioned by 
some breaking of an inward ulcer, some of 
those changes of which she had heard and 
read?"

Full of solicitude, eager to ascertain a 
fact which the buoyancy of youthful expecta- 
tion made half a certainty, even in despite of 
the sad spectacle presented to her eyes, she 
knelt down by the sofa, and with clasped hands 
and streaming eyes endeavoured to form a 
prayer for his restoration  but hope, and 
self-deception, struggled in vain against the 
sad conviction before her; and not words, but 
deep sighs burst from her lips, and whilst she 
tried to utter, "not my will but thine be 
done," sleep fled, and her father's eyes were 
upon her. 
"My Harriet! my beloved wife!" said 
Mr. Carysford, in a pleasant clear voice. 
Was this the wandering of delirium? or the 
lingering dream of the long and salutary sleep 
he had enjoyed? and which could not fail to 
have been restorative from the effect it had 
had upon his voice  the heart of Emma 
throbbed violently with newly awakened 
hope ; how willingly could she again watch 
for months, and even years, over the couch 
of sickness, if at last her father would re- 
cover  " and who could sav he should not?

" Dear Sir, you have had a long com- 
fortable sleep, and are better for it I trust  
it is Emma, father, that speaks to you, your 
daughter." 
" Yes ! Emma, my good little girl  I 
thought she had received 'me in Heaven 
when my two sons, the dark and the fair 
Charles, bore me thither  I fancy it was all 
a dream, I have been very fast asleep." 
As Mr. Carysford spoke, he passed his 
hand over his forehead and became very 
pale, and Emma saw his mind was slightly 
wandering, but she thought that was not sur- 
prising, for he had been many hours w.ih- 
out food or medicine. The latter as a resto- 
rative, she instantly gave him, and in a short 
time she had the satisfaction to see him take 
the former with more zest than he had done 
some time; he said, "he was certainly 
better, but sensible of great cold, and when 
Emma had laid a shawl over his feet, he 
begged her to draw a seat close to him, and 
chafe his hands between hers." 
Emma sat down on a low seat, surprised 
how such a sensation could possibly affect 
any person that day, but she fondly held 
those dear wasted hands to her checks and

her lips, and thought she should soon warm 
them. 
" Where is James ? call him, mv love." 
" He is not yet returned from the Mel- 
villes." 
" I remember now, they were to depart at 
sunset ; I should like to be moved nearer to 
that side, and look at the setting sun myself, 
it is a glorious sight." 
Emma wheeled the sofa into the proper 
place. 
" My love, you had better call old Barba, 
or Diego, I am very, very chill. God sup- 
port thee, my child : he will sustain thee as 
thou hast sustained me." 
Emma dropped almost unconsciously upon 
her knees ; she still held her father's hands, 
and was held bv them ; therefore she could 
not move without inflicting disturbance at a 
moment so awful, so alarming  she could 
not reply save by caresses, and her heart as- 
cended in earnest prayer for him to heaven.

Poor James !  my child! Emma! id y poor 
girl ! " 
" Father, dear father, think not of me : 
your God will have mercy on me, as on you." 
As she spoke these words, she rose, and 
with a convulsive motion threw her arms 
round her father, and drew him towards her: 
she saw his features, his mouth indicated his 
wonted smile, and the words, " Glory be to 
his name," seemed partly to meet her ear ; 
but the last vestige of life had left the body 
she grasped, and in another moment, the seal 
uf death was on the face also. 
" All, all is over ! " 
As these words issued from Emma's lips, 
she sank down by the couch with her head 
on the breast of the corpse, but she did not 
faint, though a sense of severe disappoint- 
ment and awe, of surprise and grief, not un- 
mingled with gratitude to heaven, altogether 
overcame her with feelings, which, in their 
excess, produced apparent stupor. The en- 
trance of Barba, at the accustomed hour with 
coffee, spread the news of Mr. Carysford's 
death (and her consequent distress) through 
the house, and one of the servants lost not 
a moment in setting out to seek James,

MODERATION. 179 
The voice of kindness, however, and by 
whomsoever uttered, in such a moment as this, 
is valuable, whether its dictates are obeyed or 
not. Emma did not refuse the advice of old 
Barba; she retired to her own room, she sought 
" to commune with her own heart and be still," 
but the perturbation would not cease, the 
effects of her past shock, and even the al- 
most supernatural effort she had made to meet 
it at the moment, would not subside; and it 
will be naturally supposed that her sense of 
bereavement was increased bv the utter loneli- 
ness of her situation; the want of even one 
human being who could understand her lamen- 
tations. 
Hour after hour passed, and Emma con- 
tinued with slowly falling foot to traverse her 
chamber; the day was long closed, and she 
heard nothing of James, whom she now de- 
sired vet dreaded to see. Conscious that she 
ought to exert herself, and feeling that strange 
impatience to return to her father, which 
manv of us have felt also, and can be fullv 
understood by all who have waited long at 
the sick couch of a beloved relative, she 
rang the bell to enquire. Barba answered it, 
said " the messenger had seen James, and

that he raved like a distracted man, abusing 
himself by all sorts of names for leaving his 
master, but yet he had not returned with him." 
As the old woman spoke, she held her lamp 
as if to light Emma to her father's bed-room ; 
she followed her to the door, then took the 
lamp and entered alone. 
The corpse was laid on the bed he had so 
long occupied, the eyes were closed, the jaws 
were bound, yet so mild, so sleeplike, it was 
scarcely possible to think the last great, change 
had passed over it. Emma kissed the fore- 
head, and her tears fell on the marble face  
she wiped them away, and was led by that 
action to remark the total want of that nicety 
of arrangement in all things around, by which 
in her own country even poverty beautifies 
death by the cares of affection. 
Habitually neat to delicacy, and active in 
all the offices of love, she could not forbear 
to supply these deficiencies, and on recollecting 
that it was probable they had been neglected 
under the idea that as the corpse of an here- 
tical priest, the precious dust before her was 
unworthy " due observances," her oppressed 
spirit rose to the affecting task, and she deter- 
mined not to quit her father's corpse till she

had laid it in the last receptacle, paid it the 
last honours. 
It is the happy condition of our nature, that 
all personal exertion lessens mental grief, and 
subdues the turmoil of passion  Emma was 
faint and weak, lowly and sorrowful, yet she 
found a power of arranging this bed of death 
like that of her mother (as far as she was able) 
to a certain degree recall her scattered spirits, 
and lead her to see how much the hand of 
mercy had attempered this awful consumma- 
tion to both him who departed and her who 
was left. 
It was now midnight, all without was silent 
as that breathless form before her  no longer 
the short cough, the whispered request broke 
on her ear; the kind words, the thankful smile 
no longer soothed whilst they wrung her heart; 
her "occupation" was indeed gone, and all 
around her was cold, cheerless, isolated, and 
friendless : the one countenance she could 
have gazed at with pleasure, the one voice she 
could have listened to with comfort, was 
taken from her as effectually, " perhaps as 
eternally as her father  but we shall meet in 
heaven, why did I say eternally?" thought 
Emma.

At this moment she became aware that steps 
were near the door, whisperings were heard, 
and deep sighs ; soon afterwards, a loud bur>t 
of irrepressible sorrow announced the return 
of poor James, and at the same time it was 
plain that his steps turned from the door as if 
he were unable to meet her. 
Emma instantly conceived, and pitied the 
sorrow, and the self-reproach, this honest af- 
fectionate servant could not fail to endure 
from the peculiar circumstances in which he 
stood. She rose from her own little couch, 
and opening the door, cast her eyes down tin 
gallery, which was only lighted by the ray 
from that lamp within her chamber  a ma:\ 
was standing very near. 
"James," said Emma in a mournful but kind 
tone, "James, are you come?" 
" It is not James," replied a voice which 
thrilled to her heart though it answered in a 
low inarticulate manner. 
Emma started back into the chamber half 
terrified, but she was followed by Melville, who 
eagerly told her "that James, on hearing of 
his master's death, and having the vessel still 
before his eyes into which they had removed 
but half an hour before, had procured a boat,

Most probably Melville meant to say, " a 
comfort," but his eyes at this moment turned 
upon the bed, where lay the pale remains of 
him whom he had so long loved as a friend, 
and revered as a saint, to whom he had (as an 
orphan from infancy) wished to believe that 
he could indulge the feelings which belonged 
to the tenderness due to a mother, and the 
honour claimed by a father  the lips were 
now sealed for ever in the coldness of death, 
which, that very morning, had so warmly 
blessed him ; never more would the instruc- 
tion which had assisted, the information 
which had delighted him, proceed from them 
again. 
Melville gazed and wept, and for some 
moments the evident agony of his heart shook 
his manly frame with convulsive agitation ; 
but the sigh of Emma caught his ear, the 
sigh of her who had suffered so long, whose 
loss, and, consequently, whose affliction, 
was so much greater than his own could pos- 
sibly be. 
" Pardon me," he stammered out at length,

This was declaration ; it was acknowledged 
love ; and though offered in a season when 
happy love would have been profanation to 
the sacred claims of sorrow, it could not be 
refused on that account, for it was offered 
with the tone and gesture of a heart torn 
with anguish and alarm  offered  ah, no ! 
that could not be called an offer which was 
instantly retracted ; which was rather thrown 
before her in the confusion of weakness, as 
that which ought to be refused, than pre- 
sented, in the confidence of honour and affec- 
tion, claiming acceptance and reciprocal at- 
tachment. 
Yet under any possible circumstances it is 
certain the assurance of being beloved by one 
so dear, so justly and entirely esteemed, was 
sweetly consolatory to the heart of Emma

generous and lofty spirit ; she sought to con-

bowed down by the most natural grief, and 
touched with the most lively admiration, the 
most ardent friendship. It was dear and 
grateful to her heart to see the veil stripped,

though but for a moment, which revealed to 
her how deeply seated, how vividly displayed, 
was that passion which till now was never 
permitted to own its existence. The sense of 
comfort, of peace, which was thus given to 
her mind, enabled her, notwithstanding the 
profound sympathy which the complicated 
sorrows of Melville inspired, to soothe the 
agonies of his mind, and confirm him in the 
path of duty, and, judging of his feelings by 
her own, she did this most effectually by as- 
suring him, " that, though weak with sorrow 
and fatigue, yet she was not otherwise ill

over, she should return to her country with

we shall but lose one tide, and I must provide

from the arms which had enfolded her, she

the feet departed with rapidly-descending 
steps, and all was again silent and deserted; 
it was a^ain the chamber of death. 
The people of the house, considering thaV 
the stranger might have certain rites to per- 
form agreeable to her own religion, or be- 
lieving her perhaps too devoid of any to be an 
object of interest, suffered her to remain un- 
disturbed ; and as James had again departed, 
being advised, almost commanded, "not vet 
to intrude upon her," she remained alone the 
rest of the night  sometimes in tears, some- 
times in prayer, endeavouring to subdue her 
emotions, and tranquillize the strange confu- 
sion of her thoughts, which on reflection 
seemed to forbid her to repose on the love of 
one whose words were mysterious, though his 
countenance was open and his nature frank. 
At length, nature exhausted by long suffer 
ing sunk unexpectedly into that uneasy slum- 
ber, which a frame unequal to further en- 
durance found even on that scat which was 
close by the bed of her father.

Uay was risen, and the world was abroad, 
before poor Emma's head was so far raised 
from the wall against which she leaned, as to 
be sensible of her situation. When she did 
look up, James stood before her, and old 
Barba was near him, but as she cast her 
eyes towards the bed and recollected all that 
had occurred, she became fearful that she 
had not fulfilled her watch, and eagerly rose 
to see that the treasure was safe. 
Her own cambric handkerchief was on the 
face, for James had thrown it there; as she 
removed it she trembled violently, for the first 
time an undefined, but secret fear pervaded 
her heart. 
The altered hue told her that her fears, 
her sensations had cause ; and the earnest en- 
treaty of James that she would leave the 
chamber was faintly parried, until it appeared 
evident that the poor man conceived himself

to be under her displeasure ; she could not 
remove this weight upon his mind without 
acceding to his wish, and she was too ge- 
nerous to continue it; she also felt that she 
had duties to perform, that she was called 
to think and act, and that therefore she must 
take refreshment, and see her fellow-creatures 
on business of the most urgent nature. 
But when Emma held herself prepared for 
this, she was informed, "that all was kindlv 
arranged, that the funeral which could not be 
delayed beyond evening, was already in prepa- 
ration, that the banker of Mr. Melville had 
taken charge of every thing, and would engage 
two English gentlemen to attend their country- 
man's funeral, cither as mourners or supporters 
\o her if she wished to attend." 
" I will see him laid in the dust," said 
Emma, "it is the last duty I can show my 
father." 
" Yet you can surely trust me, Miss Emma? 
it will be too much for you  it will indeed." 
Emma shook her head in unbelief. " I shall 
be sustained through it, I trust  I have borne 
much more."

period when his pure spirit departed to hie

God, the necessary attendants arrived, and 
they proceeded to the English burying- 
ground. It is well known as a spot singu- 
larly adapted for the purpose, being shaded 
by dark cypress trees, which cast their long 
mournful shadows over the graves of many 
young, beautiful, and wealthy from our na- 
tive shores ; and such was its affecting influ- 
ence on the mind of Emma, that she never 
visited it but once, when she had accompa- 
nied Melville thither, whilst her father sat by 
the sick bed of James. The funeral was per- 
formed by a young clergyman apparently in 
delicate health himself; and that sublime 
and affecting service which she had so often 
heard read by the deceased, under such cir- 
cumstances, was almost overwhelming. She 
clung to the arm of her unknown and unseen 
countryman, for her veil was closely wrapt 
around her, and for a short time feared that 
she should faint. 
This stranger was evidently a man of 
much sympathy, his own sighs responded to 
hers, and his aspirations were fervent  she 
was persuaded he was the father of a family ; 
probably had himself laid a blooming daugh- 
ter or a promising son in that cemetery ; but

of him, or for him, Emma could not think at 
such a time, further than to be grateful for 
his tender attention and paternal care. 
The last look was taken, the crumbling 
mould fell hard and dry on the coffin, and 
scarcely could the shaking limbs of Emma 
support her through the avenue which led to 
the carriage. Another gentleman now took 
her hand, placed his arm round her, and sup- 
ported her, and when she entered the coach, 
followed her into it ; but the person on whom 
she had hitherto leaned stepped into another 
carriage, and drove away in a manner which 
betokened great haste. Surely the vessel 
which she knew had been hired by Sir Geof- 
frey was still in the river detained for this 
purpose  the farewell pressure of that 
friendly hand, told her that it was, it could 
be no other than Melville, who had shared 
her awful situation. * 
The gentleman now in the carriage after 
some pause addressed her with much cour- 
tesy, and pressed upon her an invitation to 
the Banker's house, from whom she had re- 
ceived so many marks of valuable attention ; 
and being persuaded that her privacy would 
be for the present sacred, and that it was a

most respectable home, she thankfully ac- 
cepted the offer, sensible of the goodness of 
Providence in so tempering her sorrow, and 
securing assistance in the very hour when 
she seemed bereft of all. She was sensible of 
great personal weakness, and remembering 
how much she had suffered during her first 
voyage, thought that if even it had been 
possible for her to embark immediately, she 
ought not to venture  besides, " there was in 
her own country, at this time, no one person 
so attractive as even the grave of her father 
appeared in her eyes. She had no home : 
no brother to receive and supply to her a 
father's protection ; no aunt to give her a 
mother's countenance. Her eldest sister's 
marriage had taken her in a twofold sense 
from her family, as her silence implied, and 
Sophia  " 
Emma stayed the sad current of her medi- 
tations as her younger sister passed in re- 
view before her. She recollected the un- 
feigned sorrow that sister had manifested to- 
wards her father, the kindness and modesty 
of her late letters, as contrasted with her 
former spiritual pride and assumption  her 
extreme youth and the influence which had

wrought upon her that partial alienation from 
her family which was respectable even in its 
error, in so far as it was sincere, and awakened 
by the most awful subject of anxiety which 
can affect the mind. She felt that Sophia had 
a claim upon her tenderness, her counsel, her 
forbearance for the future, her forgetfulness of 
the past; she hoped that the time might yet 
come when they should " take sweet counsel 
together, and walk in the house of God," 
and in the world also, "as friends" and sisters. 
As it was but too probable that the death of 
her father might cause Sophia to revert more 
decidedly than ever to her former associates in 
the enthusiasm that affecting event would 
stimulate, Emma determined only with the 
more affectionate moderation to guide her 
by degrees into a safer and wiser path  to 
use the increased light she had herself gained 
in this eventful period from her father's con- 
versations ; for the purpose of strengthening 
the understanding and tranquillizing the con- 
science of that beloved child, whom she well 
knew "lay heavy at his heart," almost till 
its last pulsation.

pathy towards their guest whom they con 
sidered the relation of the Melvilles. Emma 
had been there only three days, when from 
the arrival of various mails she became all 
at once as much incommoded with an abund- 
ance of letters, as she had of late felt herself 
neglected by their absence. That of Harriet 
claimed her first attention, because she hoped 
to find in it reason for long silence, and also 
inclosures which would be far more welcome 
than further trespass on her friends. 
Considering Harriet as so newly married, 
Emma was struck by the multitude of her 
complaints, but she soon found that her trouble 
in going to Ireland, her hatred of that place 
on her arrival, her difficulty in effecting a re- 
turn, and finally, her dislike and dread of her 
reat Indian uncle, who arrived by the spring 
ships, were all intended as apologies for silence, 
which she knew to be inexcusable, and for 
conduct she felt to be so unjust, that every 
possible palliative had need to be pressed 
into her service. The letter contained the sum 
of one out of two hundred pounds, which 
Charles had commissioned her to send four 
months before, and which from his own letter 
it appeared he expected would accompany

to Emma for interest. 
"1 know," said Harriet, "you are so very 
prudent, my dear Emma, and things (1 have 
understood.) are so very cheap at Lisbon, 
that I hope the little delay, or the circum- 
stance of my borrowing a hundred pounds,

other matters of the same description to 
Sophia, but the little demure minx will not 
confess, nor allow me to look into the strong- 
box  never surely was there such a piece of 
pertinacity; in other respects she is better, for 
during her illness the new curate attended her, 
and I apprehend reconverted her; I have a 
great notion there is something more than 
meets the eye between them. I hope you 
will be at home soon, and set all of us to 
rights ; my father ought to interfere as Sophia 
is under age." 
" What would have become of me at this 
moment," said Emma to herself, " if we had 
not met with Melville? ah! how cruelly sel- 
fish does extravagance make us, whilst Har- 
riet could literally rob both Charles and me, 
at a time when the comforts, the very life of a 
sick father were affected by the circumstance, 
in order to deck her own person, to cut a 
figure among people for whom she could have 
no regard  fie on it. Sophia, dear Sophia, 
there is little comparison between your faults 
and those of your elder sister. Harriet will 
ruin her husband." 
In a long letter from Mrs. Wilmington,

all her fears on this head were confirmed. 
She learnt also that Mr. Fountain was angry 
with his nephew for marrying a woman with 
so small a fortune as Miss Carysford, he 
having set his heart it appeared on uniting 
him to Miss Mortimer, whose early predilec- 
tion for the army he was well acquainted with, 
and whose residence in the same village with 
his friends would have given him a decided 
advantage: "not," added the writer, "but my 
brother is reasonable, and was glad to find 
your sister was Miss Tintagell's favourite ; but 
since then we have learnt that her rich aunt 
is as little pleased with the match as toy 
brother, so you see, my dear Miss Emma, we 
are all in the wrong, and sincerely do I wish 
that you and our dear revered friend were here, 
for you only have influence over my son and 
daughter." 
In the evident anxiety of this excellenJ 
mother, she had reserved to a postscript the 
extraordinary information, that the inhabitants 
of the Park were all gone to the continent; 
but the letters of Charles (two of which though 
written at different periods were now delivered 
together) gave her the further information as 
to their route and present situation, likely to

interest her. She found that Lord Alfre ton's 
loss of health arose from a wound received in 
a duel, which had entailed not less weakness 
of bod\', than remorse of mind, which his aunt 
kindly sought to ameliorate by introducing to 
him a relation whose education fitted him to 
offer that consolation which could alone be 
considered adequate to the end : " Alas ! " said 
Charles, " I am very young, Emma, and very 
unequal to the task. What would I give that 
my dear father had come to Italy, instead of 
going to Lisbon, that I might receive from 
his lips the instructions I desire to convey, 
that I might exemplify in his character the 
excellence of those doctrines I wish to incul- 
cate  every day I desire to set out to you, 
but this I cannot now do, for my aunt is so 
fully persuaded that you will leave Lisbon 
in consequence of the heats of June, that she 
is arranging her own departure in the hope 
of finding you at home. God grant she may." 
Those only who have been similarly situat- 
ed can conceive what those harrowing sensa- 
tions were, which such sentences as referred 
to her father as living, awoke in the breast 
of his daughter. All spoke of him with that 
moving tenderness which extended its thril-

tinguish their hopes, to awaken their sorrows, 
to live attain through scenes she trembled to 
recall, or, by using the hand of another, add 
anxiety on her own account, to grief lor the 
loss of her father, for some time appalled her 
with new distress. It led her notwithstanding 
to remember with gratitude from how much 
alllietion of a similar nature she had been 
spared  that source of sweetly treasured satis- 
faction, which arose from the love of Melville, 
soothed and to a certain decree invigorated 
her spirits for the terrible task which still re- 
mained to her, of announcing the death of 
one who must be lamented, as he had been 
beloved. 
We cannot pursue the detail of those feel- 
ings with which this sad duty was fulfilled, 
but we may assert that they were struggled 
with, that Emma did not indulge that sensi- 
bility which, while it injured her health, would 
have- delayed her return, and thrown her a pain* 
ful burden upon the time' and atte-ntion of com- 
miserating strangers. Nor was it till she had

attained resignation and equanimity, that she

fulfilled the foud but melancholy desire she 
had long felt of visiting her father's grave, and 
the room in which he died  none of our 
younger readers will suppose that she omitted 
to retread the walk which lead to the foun- 
tain, that she sought to inhale the soft per- 
fume from the lemon trees, but all should 
know that although she entered it, yet she 
wisely and resolutely abandoned her design, 
sensible that she had already endured an ex- 
citement to which she was unequal. 
This was the last day of her stay in Lisbon, 
and at an early hour she was summoned to the 
vessel, which conveyed her to the packet. 
She left friends in all who had witnessed her 
ceaseless vigilance of affection, her tender 
submission in affliction, the uprightness and 
punctuality with which she discharged her 
obligations of business, and the active good- 
ness and charitable attention she evinced to- 
wards all her fellow-creatures. Parting is 
rarely unaccompanied by sorrow, and the 
kindness of those around her, the memory of 
that precious dust she left with them, rendered 
her last adieus necessarily affecting ; bat 
Emma was surprised to see this emotion par- 
taken by James also, who continued to wave

well, so long as the servants of Don Chicolo 
and Diego, from the hotel, were visible on the 
quay. 
When they were safely on board, Emma 
fearful of sickness remained some time on 
deck, and the beauty and magnificence of 
all around her allayed the sad remembrances 
which necessarily crowded on her mind, and 
dill'used over it that solace which a widely 
extended view of nature, in that still hour of 
morning when creation itself seems reposing, 
is calculated to produce. So long as she 
could, she continued to gaze on that spot 
most endeared to her as the grave of her 
father; but she soon lost sight of it, and by 
degrees the magnificent looking city, with its 
tall white buildings, which had lately risen 
proudly from the river side as a vast cres- 
cent, adorned by churches, convents, and 
palaces, bordered by a noble river, on the broad 
bosom of which were seen vessels of every 
nation, now grew less and less, as the Btream 
widened, and the shore receded, and at length 
its white walls ceased to sparkle in the sun- 
beams  the day advanced, but the city was 
lost.

" Poor old Lisbon, I shall see thee no 
more," said James, with a deep sigh. 
The words were uttered in soliloquy, but 
me sigh that followed them was so profound, 
(meant probably to be the parting groan of 
regret,) that Emma could not forbear to no- 
tice it. 
" I am surprised you are so sorry, James, 
to leave Lisbon." 
" Why I'm not right sorry, Miss Emma, 
but only it makes one feel sorrowful somehow 
to see the last of an old enemy, and remem- 
ber all that I remember. Lisbon has made 
me a cripple, it has drawn more blood than I 
had to spare, and it has taken that which I 
loved better than my own flesh and blood  
but he said we must all forget and for- 
give ; so I say, God bless Lisbon after all ; 
there are many good folks in it, and many 
more out of it." 
The thoughts of those " out of it," to whom 
James unquestionably alluded, rushed with 
all their claims to kind and grateful remem- 
brance on Emma's mind  she was now borne 
on the wave where, " within a little month,"

her sorrows, an eye that swam in tears as it

gazed through the space hers now tried to 
penetrate. In a short time, alas ! she should 
be separated from him still farther than now, 
and when she should again hear from him or 
behold him, she knew not. As these thoughts 
passed her mind, several times she was on 
the point of speaking to James on the sub- 
ject of the embarkation of the Melville fa- 
mily, in which he had assisted, purely for 
the pleasure (we may suppose) of hearing 
that dear name mentioned which was music 
to her ear, and which was dwelt upon by her 
honest old servant with all that zealous 
praise, awakened equally by personal grati- 
tude and warm admiration  but with this 
desire was blended that trembling reserve pe- 
culiar to timid passion, and in another mo- 
ment Emma almost felt afraid that James 
should mention the subject, lest even he 
should read what was passing in her heart. 
" 1 hope you are not beginning to be ill, 
Ma'am 1 " 
" 1 am not, thank you, James." 
"God forbid! I'm sure you have not 
strength to bear it, though they say it does

Captain's cousin, escaped it when they  "

" Young lady!" exclaimed Emma, in a 
voice which, though low and impeded, re- 
sembled a shriek. 
" Yes, the sick young lady, I mean, as be 
gone to the Madeiras  poor creature, she 
seemed to me more like a bundle of clothes 
than a woman, as the Captain carried 
her ; and the poor old gentleman was helping, 
thof she was as light as a feather, I take it  
I just saw her face peep out of the military 
cloak she was wrapped in, and a very pretty 
face it was, with fine black eyes like her 
cousin's, only she's not dark like him, but 
very white indeed  I beg pardon for talking, 
Ma'am, you are ill." 
Emma tacitly confessed she was, by in- 
stantly retreating to the only place of retire- 
ment circumstances allowed ; on her bed she 
could weep unseen, she could combat best the 
astonishment, grief, and indignation which, 
in the moment of this overwhelming surprise, 
made her desire not merely to hide her scald- 
ing tears, but to fly for ever from a world 
which was hateful to her. 
" Am I again deceived? again disappoint- 
ed ? why do I say again ? never before did I 
know what it was so to prefer, to admire, to

love any human being. Why was I so cru- 
elly, so perfidiously betrayed i I who would 
not so injure any human being  by Mel- 
ville too, the most open, frank, artless of all 
creatures, whom my poor father so often 
used to charge with being less worldly-wise 
than himself." 
By degrees recollections arose which told 
Emma that it was possible James might be 
mistaken ; he had, it appeared, seen an inva- 
lid wasted it might be to more than feminine 
delicacy  " but, no ! all that was mysterious 
in the conduct of Melville was thus, and 
could only be thus accounted for : he had in 
every conversation dwelt much on the sor- 
rows of his uncle, but spoken little of the 
peculiar ailment of the invalid ; he had men- 
tioned no name save that of his relationship, 
or the terms, " an only child," " the dear pa- 
tient," " our beloved sufferer," See. His 
every word in their last meeting was now 
fully explained, as indicating a tic to his 
fellow travellers beyond what appeared ; and 
she could not doubt that if Melville's cousin 
was a woman, to that woman he was bound 
in claims beyond those of friendship or con- 
sanguinity.

But had he therefore deceived her ? was 
he, on whose integrity she could have relied 
so implicitly, a vain, a fickle, a designing 
man ? every reflection on his character, his 
manners, and his conduct, alike answered de- 
terminately "No!" Had he then read the 
tender secret of her heart, and was he led 
from pity to profess that attachment which 
might soothe the severity of her present 
troubles ? The deep agitation of his own 
awakened feelings, the profound delicacy and 
respect with which he had uniformly treated 
her, forbade her to entertain a fear so wound- 
ing to virgin delicacy : how often had he 
been on the point of declaring that love 
which was read in his looks, his manners, 
and, above all, in his solicitude, and which 
was unquestionably suspected, or rather, 
confided in by her father himself? How se- 
vere his struggles had been to conquer this 
passion, might be inferred from his altered 
looks, which she had imputed to the sleepless 
nights she supposed he passed with his cou- 
sin  " well might he suffer, when he consi- 
dered that he was deceiving an artless, affec- 
tionate stranger on the one hand, perhaps a 
long affianced bride on the other, whose pre-

lent deplorable situation rendered her only 
the more irresistible in her claims upon his 
tenderness and honour."

severest to which our nature is subject,) great 
advantage over a narrow and selfish spirit.

Melville, however pitiable his situation might 
be, and blameless his original intention, still 
he had been guilty of a species of deception. 
Emma could neither, by any possible view of 
the case, acquit him of this fact, nor cease to 
feel that he had rendered her a sufferer from 
it; but as with this knowledge was united 
an assurance that he was severely afilicted 
for this fault, and had in other respects great 
merit, she desired if possible to pardon it, and 
dismiss it from her memory. Thousands of 
women would have bemoaned their hard fate, 
as victims of deception ; and yet, with all 
their anger at the aggressor, their self-pity, 
and the remembrance of their wrongs, have 
cither cherished his memory in their hearts, 
though it was as a viper's sting to their 
peace, or, from a species of revenge and 
scorn, by no means incompatible with exist-

ing love, resolved to marry the first man who 
should afterwards address them. Such are 
the common operations of pride upon the 
hearts of those who are unaccustomed to 
self-examination, and unconscious of the in- 
fluence of christian humility, which can alone 
rebuke the winds and waves of this or any 
other passion, and say, " peace, be still." 
The heart constantly exercised in kindly 
feelings, less troubled with its own wishes 
and desires than in considering the wants or 
comforts of beloved relatives, esteemed 
friends, and the wide circle of those who 
claim the charities of life, in going out of 
itself to inhabit the breast of another, will 
find so much there, in which to sympathize, 
as to lose half its own load upon the thresh- 
old. 
Deep was the pity which moved the heart 
of Emma for Melville, and it will be readily 
supposed, that the fault of loving her too well 
was one which she could readily forgive, for 
we affect not to paint her as a perfect cha- 
racter. She was one of " like passions with 
others," but she had even at this period of 
life manifested a power of successfully, be- 
cause firmly and meekly, repelling the ascen-

dancy of vanity, ambition, anger, and inordi- 
nate grief  could she now apply the same 
principles to that which appears the most 
amiable, and is therefore the most insidious 
of all mental disorders? could she arrest that 
passion which, resting in the most secret re- 
cesses of the heart, is nurtured by imagina- 
tion and memory, and in her case was held 
sacred by gratitude, which self-deception 
loves to embalm under the name of friend- 
ship, and which every human being in early 
life feels privileged to indulge in, as the com- 
mon though latent weakness of their age, 
and entwined with their very being '.' 
That Emma did not for some time see her 
duty in this respect, and therefore did not 
call up her reason or religion to oppose it, is 
certain ; but she did in the first place ear- 
nestly endeavour to obtain that equanimity 
of mind without which she knew it was im- 
possible for her judgment to act. When she 
found that by placing herself in this situation 
she was only led to pity and love Melville 
the more, she resolved to contemplate the 
situation of Miss Melville, her weak state, 
her affection, perhaps nurtured from child- 
hood, the quickness of perception her own

love might have given her, the bitter pangs 
which might arise from a sense of coldness, 
or neglect, of suspicion that he in whom she 
had so long " garnered up her heart," could 
suffer his eye to wander because her form was 
fading. She felt ready to expostulate with 
him on the weakness, the cruelty, the un- 
manly indecision of such a dereliction from 
love and honour, which was the more unwor- 
thy of him because his judgment was sound, 
his principles good, his sentiments noble, his 
disposition excellent. 
" Ah ! what must be the power of that 
passion which could so far warp a nature so 
ingenuous, a spirit so lofty ? which could 
teach even the most trivial shadow disguise 
can frame to one abhorrent of baseness, and 
seduce a heart so full of kindness to every 
human being into an act of cruelty to one 
beloved so fondlv ? I never, never can cease 
to lament him, to thank him, to  yes, to 
love, but not so to love him as I have done." 
Day after day passed, the wind fell, the 
vessel slumbered on the waters which lay be- 
neath her like a mirror of molten gold ; com- 
plaints were heard on all sides, and Emma 
reflected with surprise on the many days in

which her mind, occupied with one subject, 
had wandered in a labvrintli of distracting 
thoughts, without making any progress to- 
wards that freedom and tranquillity it was 
her duty to obtain. 
During this period, every book on board 
had been exchanged amongst the passengers, 
to beguile the wearisome time, and divert the 
uneasiness experienced by several whose 
prognostications diffused general apprehen- 
sion. One gentleman had offered a poem to 
Emma, of which he spoke very highly, bur 
as the book was a quarto, and the sickly 
frame of mind into which she had unhappily 
fallen by supplying eternal food for conjec- 
ture and recollection, chilled alike the power 
of exertion and the excitement of curiosity, 
she had hitherto never looked beyond the 
title-page, where " Armageddon," and a 
Greek motto, seemed to offer subjects be- 
yond her present powers of attention. 
But she now determined to task those pow- 
ers, to compel that attention ; she lifted up 
her heart as well as she was able to Him who 
" seeth the secrets of all hearts," and then 
began seriously to enter on that (which 
would in days past have been seized with

avidity) beautiful poem, as an exercise for 
her faculties, necessary, but not palatable. 
For some time she pursued the soaring flights 
of our living Milton with weak, abstracted 
gaze ; but she soon became sufficiently aware 
of the poetic beauties to know that the fault 
was wholly in herself if she were neither 
charmed by the delightful flow of its melli- 
fluous lines, nor wrapped in the sublime con- 
ceptions of the mighty theme. She saw that 
of all other books, which under any possible 
circumstances might have been laid before 
b.er at this time, not one could have been 
equally calculated for her benefit, since no 
enervating or love-indulging sentiment could 
be found there from the very nature of the 
subject ; yet were the powers of imagination 
excited and gratified, the most commanding 
and magnificent objects, the most beautiful 
pictures presented, and all combined with 
the great, endearing, and consolatory truths 
of Christianity. 
By degrees the wandering, bewildered mind 
of Emma regained the power of attention, 
a sense and relish for passages of extraordi- 
nary interest, and solicitude in the pursuit ; 
the book, though frequently laid down, was

as frequently recurred to, and that which 
was at first as fatiguing and difficult as the 
study of mathematics might have been, be- 
came a constant and dear resource, in which 
she found at once the action her faculties 
required, and the serenity she sought. 
Whilst she was thus beneficially employed in 
moderating the all-enin-ossinir and " inordi- 
nate affection" which had from so many 
causes become the master spring of her spi- 
rit, a favourable breeze sprung up, and in 
another week they arrived in the Channel. 
But, alas ! Emma was not able to welcome 
the shores of her native land  whether it 
were the extraordinary fatigues she had en- 
countered in attending upon her father during 
the intolerable heats, the bad provisions to 
which the unexpected length of their voyage 
had subjected the passengers, the severe men- 
tal struggle she had undergone, or all these 
causes combined, we know not; but for the 
last three days she had experienced extreme 
languor, the restlessness of fever, and much 
acute pain in her head and her side. The 
excellence of her constitution had hitherto 
been remarkable, although her frame was 
delicate; and her exquisite sensibility sub-

jected her to those partial inequalities of 
health, inseparable from a reflective and 
strongly attached mind. In consequence of 
having never suffered in any comparative de- 
gree before, she was led to believe, at an early 
stage of the disease, that she was in consi- 
derable danger, and of course felt much soli- 
citude to be on shore, and to secure that 
female attendance so necessary to her com- 
fort in every respect. 
They landed at Falmouth, and in her de- 
sire to save Sophia from alarm, rather than 
from any hope that she should be able to 
travel to her native village, Emma proceeded 
about sixty miles, when she became too ill to 
give any further directions, much less proceed, 
and the landlady of the Inn took charge of 
her, and engaged such help as the small town 
afforded, whilst poor James, almost broken 
hearted, proceeded to that place where he had 
now neither master, nor mistress, nor home, 
where every object awoke new sorrows from 
old and dear memorials of departed happi- 
ness, to procure assistance. 
At those periods when acute pain did not 
give a kind of new and artificial vigour to her 
faculties, Emma lay in a state of apparent

stupor, which was expected by those around 
her to be the prelude to delirium, but was in 
fact the consequence of that exhaustion occa- 
sioned by past suffering. Her mind never 
lost the power of recollection, and her situa- 
tion in all its bearings was constantly present. 
She felt that her situation was forlorn and de- 
solate, as contrasted with those whose bed of 
death is soothed by tender relations, and sur- 
rounded by those aids and comforts home 
only can bestow  her eyes earnestly looked 
out for familiar faces, her ears desired to drink 
the sweet sounds of friendly voices, and there 
was one that would have been most dear on 
which her heart desired to dwell, lint this 
dear, this dangerous subject, she dismissed 
with an earnest prayer l'or blessings on his 
head, as one on which she ought not to think. 
"It is too agitating for me now, it will de- 
stroy the little chance I may have for life, and 
that would be wrong, and it will unfit me for 
that resignation with which I desire to depart, 
if such be the will of my heavenly Father." 
\\ hen the recollection of her late loss 
arose to her mind with all the circumstances 
attending it, she sincerely thanked God that 
she had been enabled to supply to him those

tender attentions and that support which her 
own wants taught her to feel the value of. 
She felt it a trial to be cutoff " in the morning 
of her days, " and subjected to those frequently 
recurring pains which visited her with a se- 
verity beyond what she had ever witnessed, 
but she considered that as she had been spared 
to a good end, so she might be removed in 
much mercy ; that her present sufferings 
might work out for her " a more exceeding 
weight of glory," for though she could not 
pretend to boast of the faith, or the hope, of 
which Sophia used to speak in her visits to 
the dying, yet she did feel assured that God 
would not forsake her " in the valley of the 
shadow of death," through which she war 
passing. 
" How r thankful ought I to be," said she, 
" that I am in my own country, with those 
who speak my language and understand my 
wants  that I have fulfilled my task and 
closed my beloved father's eyes, that I have 
arranged all my affairs with my brother, and 
been the means of assisting him  that I did 
not warp the virtue, nor bring self-reproach

membered with gratitude, let me then drink

humility and patience  it is the Lord, let 
him do what scemeth him good." 
The nurse who attended Emma, pronounced 
sentence of death very positively, " because 
the patient was such a sweet, quiet young 
creature, she was too good for this world;" 
her medical attendant thought it possible, that 
she might get through, " from the firm, calm 
equanimity of her mind, and her patient en- 
durance of pain." After many ballled at- 
tempts he at length succeeded in obtaining 
sleep, and producing from sudorifics a relief 
to the tortures she had so long experienced. 
Sophia and Mrs. "Wilmington arrived when 
she was in this state of repose, and great 
care was kindly taken to save her on awaking 
from the bad effects even pleasure might 
have occasioned to one so weak. 
"My sister!" said Emma, and tears of 
delight sprung to her eyes, but she obeyed 
the injunction of her adviser, she checked 
her emotion, and whilst she silently thanked 
God for the gift, she restrained the pleasure 
with which she received it.

So weak and shadowy, so extremely pale, 
and painfully interesting, was poor Emma in 
the eyes of Mrs. Wilmington, that it was 
with the utmost difficulty that she could ap- 
ply the benefit of her skill (as the experienced 
mother of a large family) to her assistance, 
without betraying the most affecting agita- 
tion; and so warmly rekindled were the affec- 
tions of Sophia, who had not received the 
news of her father's death more than a month, 
that, going from one extreme to another, she 
lavished upon her all the treasured tenderness 
and gratitude which circumstances had in- 
duced her to nourish ; and but for her own con- 
tinued moderation in gently eluding that ex- 
ercise of sensibility, urged by their mistaken 
love, it is certain she must have been now 
killed with kindness.

VV hen at length Emma regain d the pow< r 
of venturing into the air, her recovery was 
rapid, and she experienced renovated health 
with every breeze which fanned her shrunken 
form. She therefore proposed setting out by 
easy journies for her native village, as the 
most likely place to perfect her recovery, and 
where Mrs. Wilmington earnestly pressed her 
to go. 
It was also evident, that Sophia was soli- 
citous to return thither for the sake of intro- 
ducing her to the young clergyman, who, 
she blushingly confessed, " was a person for 
whom she had a great esteem," and who, to- 
gether with her present sense of her dear 
lather's excellence as a christian minister, had 
greatly changed her sentiments. " Nor do I 
stand alone in this change, I assure you, 
Emma," added Sophia, " lor from the very 
Sunday when my father preached his last

when the winter set in we ceased to have a 
preacher come over at all, and Mr. Bennison 
has the satisfaction of knowing there is but one 
flock and one shepherd, in the whole parish

was such a pastor as Mr. Carysford, and when 
Mr. Evans came over to preach his funeral 
sermon, the very people who had left him

shaft which wounded  oh ! I cannot, cannot

Sophia wept aloud in very agony, and it 
was some time before Mrs. Wilmington could 
so far calm her, as to make her listen to the 
assurance, that she was injuring Emma ex- 
ceedingly by this effusion of sorrow, since it 
could not fail to remind her of circumstances 
too moving for her weak state, and would 
render her incapable of pursuing her journey. 
" Then I will not indulge even godly 
sorrow," said Sophia, " for it is to Emma 
alone I owe every thing; her moderation in 
bearing with my reproaches, in defending my

sincerity, in discriminating between my errors 
and my intentions, have shown me on reflec- 
tion what true religion is, have saved idl- 
perhaps from flying from one extreme to 
another far worse; what would have become 
of me if, under the agitation in which part- 
ing with my father had left me, I had given 
myself up to the guidance of Harriet?" 
To the great surprise of the party, Sophia 
was interrupted by the announcement of 
Harriet herself, who, together with her hus- 
band and Miss Tintagell, made their ap- 
pearance in time to put a stop to their jourm v. 
In noticing their arrival, we have named the 
mover of the journey, and by far the most 
important personage in it last, as the others 
travelled in her carriage and came at her 
request. 
We do not however mean to say that Mrs. 
Francis Wilmington did not greatly desire to 
see her sister, for she certainly did, from mo- 
tives of affection and interest also ; but it 
is only justice to say that the latter was for- 
gotten when she beheld her attenuated form 
and pallid face, and saw the poor place where 
she had been lying sick, and where her 
conscience told her she might, have besn as

devoid of money as of friends. Harriet, as 
we may have said before, was a woman of 
quick feelings, but they were neither go- 
verned by principle, nor lasting in effect, and 
her education under the paternal roof had 
been forgotten in the gay world with which 
she had afterwards mixed. At this moment, 
her heart was touched with lively remem- 
brance of her father, sorrow for her sister's 
evident sufferings, and shame for the share it 
was too probable she had had in them. In 
consequence of this sensation, she began to 
weep and to accuse herself in such a manner 
as to bring all her pecuniary transactions be- 
fore her aunt ; to the evident distress and 
confusion of her husband, and the utter dis- 
may of her mother-in-law, who, knowing the 
predicament in which her son at this moment 
stood with his uncle, dreaded any breach with 
Miss Tintagell, whose influence in his favour 
might have been very great if she would con- 
descend to use it. 
In the midst of Harriet's self-upbraidings, 
the remembrance of her present wants struck 
more strongly than ever upon her mind, in 
consequence of the vivid picture she had 
drawn of those temptations which induced

hrr to gratify her own wishes at the expense 
of her sister's necessities, and she suddenly 
stopped short in her declamation to exclaim, 
" But where arc those tormenting papers, 
Emma ? surely Charles has not got them on 
the Continent?" 
" All the papers my brother gave me to 
keep for Emma are in my writing-desk," said 
Sophia, leaving the room to fetch them, in 
answer to a look from that sister. 
The anger this confession elicited, lighted 
up the cheek and dried the tears of Harriet. 
" I thought, I hoped Sophia had been im- 
proved, but cant and hypocrisy debase the 
very soul  I always suspected she had these 
papers  I always said so, did'nt I, my d< ar ' 
and yet she never would confess, although 
she knew I was in the greatest distress lo 
them." 
At this moment, Sophia returned with 
parcel directed by her brother to his sister Em- 
ma, or, in case she did not return, to his aunt. 
" There, there" cried Harriet, in a fury, 
" you'll see they will be found in that very 
parcel." 
" I know nothing of the contents," said 
Sophia.

MODERATION. 225 
" No, Miss, but you know that you could 
have given the parcel to me, and I could have 
looked for the papers I wanted, I should have 
taken out none but what I wanted." 
Emma at this moment fixed her eyes on 
Harriet, and those eyes, calm as their ex- 
pression was, said so plainly, " that is not 
certain" that the blush of anger subsided as 
quickly as it had risen, and that of shame 
replaced it. At this moment Miss Tintagell 
arose, her tall, majestic form apparently di- 
lating by the style in which she proceeded 
to the table, and the difficulty with which she 
had hitherto suppressed her indignation at 
the past and present conduct of her once 
darling niece. 
" Have I your permission, Miss Gary s ford, 
to open this ? " 
" Certainly, my dear aunt, I am unequal 
to business." 
" So I perceive, child  well, here are the 
papers : the marriage settlement of Charles 
Carysford and Harriet; (Miss Tintagell 
trembled, and her tears for a moment ob- 
structed her vision ;) then here is a bond ;

" Why don't you take them, Captain Wil- 
mington?" cried his lady, "I'm sure you 
have teazed me very sufficiently on the sub- 
ject." 
" I cannot take them, they are your sister's 
security for the money she lent to my father, 
for me; I always told you so." 
" The money which saved us all from de- 
struction," said Mrs. Wilmington, sobbing. 
Miss Tintas-ell resumed : 
O 
" Captain Wilmington, I thank you for 
relieving me from part of the horror and dis- 
gust with which the conduct of your wife 
has inspired me. I hope you will in time 
teach her better principles, and make her 
sensible that if she has neither the affections 
of a daughter or sister, her family may yet 
hope for a portion of common honesty in 
the daughter of such parents as hers were.

" In case of my death, I desire 
that these deeds may be restored immediately 
to Captain Wilmington, on condition of his 
payment of one half of that which he is in- 
debted to my sister Sophia. The rest of my 
property I leave in my brother's hands, to be 
divided equally between my sisters after a 
period of five years, during which time he 
shall not be asked for it. This is my will in 
the event of death ; if I live to return, it is 
my intention equally to devote this sum to 
my sisters, when I become repossessed of that

evident that I cannot spare it, as the interest

and keep your own little dower in safety." 
" Dear Emma, how shall I thank you?

pounds, dear Sophia, and found such comfort 
in it  it was indeed the happy cause of my 
procuring essential aid at a time when my 
distress was very, very great." 
These words escaped Emma in her conso- 
lations to Sophia, and were evidently not 
meant for Harriet's car, but they met those 
of Mrs. Wilmington, who could not forbear 
to lament bitterly that any person in her fa- 
mily could have so rewarded Emma's good- 
ness to them. Miss Tintagell cauirht eagerly 
those words which spoke of Sophia's kind- 
ness, and, on learning what she had done, for 
the first time she kissed her, folded her i n her 
arms, and called her " the picture of her 
mother;" she then observed, in a kind and 
consolatory manner, 
" You have been a self-willed, and in some 
respects a mistaken child ; but you never 
had either cant or hypocrisy  your conduct 
has excited mortification and anger to your

tion of the phrase, " too much religion," are 
of "a much less injurious nature than those 
produced by having too little. It was im- 
possible that one who was so sincere, and 
thought so much, should not think right 
sometimes ; but the selfishness of extrava- 
gance, the forgetfulness of all affection, and 
even of the claims of honesty, the total want 
of consideration, notwithstanding the known 
misfortunes of Mr. Wilmington's family, the 
late distress and present troubles of her only 
brother, the dying state of her father, and the 
afflicting situation of her sister, evinced in 
Mrs. Francis  " 
" Spare my wife, spare her, I beseech you, 
Miss Tintagell, she is afflicted, overwhelmed 
with sorrow; it is certain we were both to

culty than she had, and it was my duty to 
have restrained her expenses." 
" Very true, and I sincerely hope you will 
henceforward adopt this system of restraint

duty ; for the present I shall only add, that

esteem by refusing to hold any communica- 
tion with her for some years. That this cir- 
cuinstance may not be injurious to you be- 
yond what is intended, and because Harriet 
was perhaps somewhat injured by an early 
indulgence in pleasures beyond her sisters, 
I beg your acceptance of two hundred per 
annum, which shall be regularly paid by- 
quarterly instalments during my life." 
As Miss Tintagell spoke, she handed the 
Captain a fifty pound bill, and in a few mo- 
ments, the mortified wife, and consoled hus- 
band, took their leave, and poor Mrs. Wil- 
mington recollecting that Miss Tintagell's 
carriage would only contain three, and also 
believing that her presence would be useful, 
accompanied them. 
At the moment when the Captain inter- 
fered to soften the anger of Miss Tintagell, 
and villi/ at that moment, did Emma cease 
to feel surprised that he had ever been an 
object of admiration to her : when she re- 
flected upon many points in his conduct, 
she could not help considering him blameable,

nothing of gratitude, proved to her that a

without that solidity of character necessary 
to our happiness in those with whom we are 
closely connected. It was impossible for her 
not to reflect with tender thankfulness on that 
unceasing watchfulness of friendship in Mel- 
ville, towards her father's comfort, and of 
course her own, which had not only belonged 
to his character as a lover, but a man, since 
James also had abundantly partaken of it  
for this poor fellow, she now became a peti- 
tioner to her aunt. 
" I will buy him an annuity, and he shall 
live in his own countiy, where he can talk to 
those who will understand him, about the 
master he has lost." 
"You are very kind, my dear madam, I 
meant that we should all join to do that very 
thing  but then I am most anxious at pre- 
sent to pay that money to Mr. Melville's 
banker, with which he assisted me so op-

" No, 1 never left my father an hour after 
the period when we became known to diem." 
" For which," said Miss Tintagell, solemnly 
folding her hands on her bosom, " 1 will 
never leave you, Emma, or cease to love you, 
to help you, to be both father and mother to 
vou, so far as I am able." 
" You say," she added after a long pause, 
"that you do not know Marianne Melville, 
'tis a pity, for you would have loved each 
other exceedingly. She is a girl of great 
talents, a noble, generous, fine-spirited crea-

" I saw only him," said Emma, her pallid 
face tinged with so deep a bloom as to speak 
volumes to the eyes of her aunt, who instantly 
changed the conversation. 
The two sisters accompanied Miss Carys- 
ford to her house in London, where the best 
medical advice was obtained for Emma, 
and where such ceaseless kindness and atten- 
tion was paid to her, and she was surrounded 
by so many elegancies, and treated with so 
many sources of rational amusement, that she 
found it necessary to guard herself from 
falling into that supine neglect of duty, which 
excessive indulgence in external circum- 
stances is so apt to inspire, and she was more 
than ever subject to "remembering that some 
things were, which were most dear to her." 
She sought anxiously to preserve in Sophia 
a deep sense of religious obligation, and a 
determination to study the duties she one 
day hoped to perform, as the wife of a 
country clergyman. Both these young people 
found that a state of mental ease and per- 
sonal luxury is difficult to combat with, when 
it follows a season of affliction and anxiety, 
but as they had been accustomed to " walk 
in the ordinances" of the church from their

earliest recollection, so they strictly persevered 
in it, and found in the composing and re- 
freshing exercises of devotion, an antidote 
to the confusing, dissipating sensations, which 
they eonsidcred inevitable to a London resi- 
dence. 
In the beginning of winter, Emma had the 
satisfaction of receiving her brother, and of 
witnessing the great improvement which 
time and consideration and sorrow had ef- 
fected in him ; there was a manliness of 
character, a sobriety of demeanor happily 
grafted on the frankness and buoyancy of 
spirits, which had formerly distinguished 
him, and he appeared (notwithstanding his 
youth) likely to slide gracefully into the dig- 
nity of married life, and the duties attached 
to it. 
This temper of mind was the more desit 
able, as he was now the possessor of Lord 
Alfrcton's estates, who had a few weeks be- 
fore died in his arms at Naples. The per- 
sonal property of that nobleman (which a 
long minority had rendered very great, and 
which a long illness had probably prevented 
from being dissipated) was bequeathed to his 
aunt. The meeting of Emma and Charles

was naturally very affecting to both, but as 
she now for the first time entered on a parti- 
cular account of their beloved father's last 
hours, it was observed by them all, that 
Miss Tintagell was agitated to a greater 
degree than any person, and the subject was 
dropped in pity to her who felt it so acutely, 
and whom they well knew to be a person 
whose attachments were few, but singularly 
strong. 
" You are certain, Emma, that your father 
so mentioned me in his last moments?" said 
Miss Tintagell, when they were alone together 
some time afterwards. 
"Oh! yes, every syllable is impressed on 
my heart, my very ear I may say, loo mi- 
nutely for mistake." 
" Well, it is dear to my heart to be so re-

spirit as rarely suits the situation, or can be 
rendered compatible with the happiness of 
woman. Having no one to guide me, I should

Emma.

this I had two offers, either of which would 
have given me rank which at that time it is 
certain I envied, and wealth which is always

fortune, though more than twice as large as

and the circle in which I moved. But in the 
mean time I had nursed my former objections 
to marriage, became more of a wit and less 
of a beauty, and whilst I affected to ridicule 
all love, nourished in my heart the silly be- 
lief that a woman can love but once, and in 
consequence I refused them both." 
"And do you now regret that you did?" 
" I do not, for I firmly believe that women 
of my description are better single. I had 
established in my heart a certain model to

of lordly man. Besides, the smallness of my 
fortune, compared to that of the noblemen 
to whom I allude, would have been galling to 
me. I should have been taken from my 
sister and her family, who have found me 
useful, and have been to me invaluable ; and as 
I can now unblamed love, and weep as I 
will, I by no means regret that I am single."

" I am fully convinced you are much more 
happy; at least, I would hope so, my dear, dear 
aunt," said Emma, embracing her with a 
daughter's fondness. 
" Yes, I am, but that is owing to my pe- 
culiarities, or my faults rather  you, Emma, 
are of a precisely different character." 
" I have been very differently situated ; as one 
of a large family, with neither the honours of 
the eldest, nor the privileges of the youngest, 
I was happily saved from improper indul- 
gences, and taught to consider, to submit  I

I have heard that the voyage to Madeira 
has done wonders for her, and that in May 
they will return : if this is true, perhaps they 
will marry." 
" Probably," said Emma, with a blanched 
and somewhat quivering lip, but her eye did 
not elude the <raze of her aunt. 
" Now as you have struggled with your 
feelings, and are almost a conqueror, can you 
not be wholly so ?  can you not listen to the 
suit of a virtuous, amiable man, who is more- 
over a nobleman, one whose parents love you,

JljMMA observed the injunction; she did think  
and she so endeavoured constantly to consider 
Melville as the property of another, as the 
friend to whom her eternal gratitude was due, 
but with whom she must never more hold 
communion, that at length she began to 
allow, " it was possible she might be tolerably 
happy with another man," on the same prin- 
ciple that she trusted he would be happy 
with one whom he had so long held dear as a 
friend, and admired as a companion. 
But the man who could be his successor 
it was certain she had never seen; many good 
and agreeable men, to whom she could not 
in reason reject, undoubtedly existed; but she 
had not met with them, though her aunt might, 
and she therefore ventured so far to satisfy 
Miss Tintagell's anxiety on the subject, as to 
say, " that after another year was past she 
would thankfully attend to her recommen-

to her happiness an exemption from all allu- 
sion to the subject." 
"Would you give that year to thinking 
on the past, Emma?" 
" Certainly not  I will give it, dear aunt, to 
preparing for the future, and as you know 
all that I require, and those qualities, with- 
out which I will not, and dare not, enter on 
vows which I will with equal conscience 
keep; I think I may promise that your next 
recommendation will be met more cordially 
than the last; I cannot say more at present." 
" Nor can I promise you another nobleman, 
ihough you are much handsomer than you 
were, child." 
" Pray don't seek one, for I greatly prefer 
a private gentleman, or a professional one. 
I have no ambition, and rank would increase 
my duties, and not repay my sacrifices. 
"Perhaps you would prefer a poor one? 
you would play love in a cottage, Miss 
Carysford." 
" I think few persons would manage better 
in a cottage with love, than I could do, but 
since my days of love and romance are over, 
I answer, "that I would wish to marry a

man in easy circumstances, but by no means 
one so wealthy as to throw my means of 
helping our establishment at a distance. I 
would rather be held as an equal through life, 
than be treated as an idol now and an in- 
ferior by and by. All my demands would be 
humble, my desires moderate, but such as 
they are must be constantly attended to. I 
am content to share all the vicissitudes of 
life, but I do not think I could bear those 
changes in kindness too common in the ma- 
trimonial barometer." 
" Yes you could, from glowing love down 
to indifference  neglect  coldness  to the last 
freezing point." 
Though Miss Tintagell said this with a 
gay air, she inwardly resolved to be very 
careful how she exposed her gentle niece to 
such evils ; and she gave up her mind for the 
present to preparations for the weddings of 
Charles and Sophia. Eulalie had changed 
from a charming, romantic little girl, to an 
elegant, sensible young woman, willing to 
laugh at her former taste for the heroic, but 
capable of exerting her former energies on all 
proper occasions. Before his marriage, 
Charles presented Mr. Bennison with the

living at Ravenhill, and generously settled a 
property equivalent to it on each of his other 
sisters, considering this as a marriage portion 
to Sophia. That which he gave to Mrs. 
Francis Wilmington was secured to her, with 
the approbation of Mr. Fountain, who had 
behaved very handsomely to his nephew, 
but earnestly desired to keep the young 
couple at a distance from London, as a scene 
of temptation they were not equal to engage 
with, a request none of the family thought 
unreasonable. 
Sir Marmaduke and Lady Lyster were de- 
lighted with the marriage, and readily united 
with Miss Tintagell in making splendid pre- 
parations, regretting that modern custom 
rendered the day itself one of privacy ra- 
ther than show, and often recalling the mc

and though Emma was not only the best be- 
loved, but the one to whom she often said 
that she owed her present happiness, yet she 
spared her to Sophia, who was married at the 
same time with her brother, and immediately 
departed for that beloved home where she

was born, and to which she had long desired 
to return. 
The other bridal party soon afterwards set 
out for the Park, which had now been long 
forsaken, but where only the owner declared 
it was possible for him to feel perfectly 
happy as an Englishman. Here, however, 
Miss Tintagell appeared to be restless and 
often melancholy, and in a short time she 
returned home, but gave Emma leave to re- 
main, saying, " My dear girl, you must feel 
much, as well as me ; but you will not there- 
fore mar the happiness of those around you ; 
I will try to take a lesson from your philo- 
sophy, and then come back and fetch you." 
" My philosophy is all found in one book 
dear aunt ; and that is not only the best, but 
the most amusing." 
" I will read it diligently, child  if it is 
valuable at your age, well may it be at mine." 
Sophia was a little hurt that her aunt did 
not come to the Rectory; but when she saw 
how much the sight of that dear home, the 
garden, the library, affected Emma, she 
thought it was better that she had not thus 
awakened sorrow which she knew would in- 
jure her health, which of late was far from

good. The first day at church, the first 
meeting with the clerk and sexton, and the 
many, ///am/ dear old faces which crowded 
around her, were indeed trials to Emma be- 
yond what she had even anticipated. The 
congregation were of course excited to cu- 
riosity by " the grand bride and her train of 
fine London folks, the good old Baronet and 
his lady come safe from forrin parts, his 
Reverence's own bride, pretty Miss Sophia 
that was, and the young 'Squire, the proper- 
est man of them all." But the eyes that had 
gazed on novelty with astonishment, and 
finery with admiration, as the parties mingled 
in the churchyard, and courteously received 
many a bobbing curtsey and many a loudly 
uttered good wish, turned, with a softened 
salutation and a moistened lid, to Emma  
many a whispered " God bless her sweet face 
she has had sorrow enough since we saw her,' 
was followed by eulogiums " on hi in that 
was dead and gone, whose like would never 
come again, no disparagement to any body." 
How many tender words found their wav 
perforce to her ear, consolatory in fact, yet 
touching every nerve of sensibility  where

called her father ? Here were the couple he 
last married  there crept the old pensioner 
for whom he had so long provided  there 
ran the children he catechized. 
And were not all the lessons which she had 
so incessantly taught her heart on another 
subject void also? the memory of Melville 
necessarily revived with that of her father, 
and the stillness of the country, the season, 
which was September, that month of cloud- 
less skies and golden sunsets, when every 
grove breathes poetic morality, and every 
flower inspires tender thoughts and parting 
memorials, were all against her. " What 
can I do?" said Emma, "curiosity will be 
busy about the present, and memory is con- 
tinually reviving the past. I have no chance 
of curing this but by mental labour, I will 
begin to learn Latin immediately." 
Mr. Bennison gladly undertook to teach 
his gentle sister, and for a short time they 
went on extremely well ; but, alas ! James, 
who resided with his relations within a few 
miles, delighted to see his young mistresses, 
and tell wonders in that kitchen where all the 
prime of his days were passed, proved a sad 
enemy to the classics by his frequent visits to

the Rectory ; and Emma began seriously to 
desire that summons from her aunt, which 
she had formerly dreaded would arrive too 
soon. 
" There is a sweetness in all around me in 
the country, a melancholy seduction, to which 
1 must not submit  how little do they know 
me who talk of my equanimity, my modera- 
tion !  but I will not despair." 
When Emma uttered these words, she was 
seated under the shade of those walnut-trees 
where she was wont to meet her father as 
he returned from his village walks, and hav- 
ing her back to the house, knew not that any 
one was near her, when James approached to 
say, with a very important air, '* Madam Tin- 
tau;ell had arrived at the Rectory." 
Emma rose and turned towards the house 
from whence her aunt and sister were issuing, 
attended by Mr. Bennison and another gen- 
tleman. 
" Who is this strange gentleman, James, 
do you know ?" 
" Yes, ma'am, I know him, for a good gen- 
tleman, he is no small favourite, I take it, of 
her honour's, but 1 say nothing." 
" Can my aunt think of this gentleman as

MODERATION. 249 
a suitor? " thought Emma, " he is certainly a 
fine old man." 
"Don't be flustrated, ma'am," said James, 
in a tone which induced Emma to look at 
him, and read in his broad brown face, a 
look of such joy, she believed only one possi- 
ble circumstance could have induced it; but 
before she had time to comment, or to say, 
" be calm," to her throbbing heart, she felt 
the pressure of her aunt's hand, who announced 
the stranger as Sir Geoffrey Melville, at the 
same time placing her niece's hand in his. 
The old gentleman was in deep mourning, 
and as he received that hand and pressed it, 
the tears were in his eyes. 
" We are not strangers, my dear young lady, 
we have been loner fellow sufferers." 
" Not strangers certainly, for you, Sir, were 
my friend when I greatly needed one." 
" Our obligations are mutual  your virtues, 
the instruction derived from conversation with 
you and your excellent father, as given to us, 
have shortened many a wearisome hour, and 
given light and hope to the most awful period 
but I shall leave it to Charles to tell the sad 
story of our wanderings ; yet there is one 
message I promised to deliver myself."

As the Baronet had continued to walk 
slowly up the avenue, Miss Tintagell and 
Mr. Bennison returned to the house, and when 
he perceived that they were gone, he took 
from his pocket a little casket of jewels, 
which he placed in Emma's hand, saying, 
" my daughter  my Marianne sent you this, 
'tis the gift  the legacy of an angel." 
The old man wept, and Emma, as she re- 
spectfully pressed the gift to her lips, wept 
also. 
" Nature will claim this tribute at times, 
but I trust I am now resigned, and may here- 
after be contented  it is now many months 
since I lost her, since she exchanged a life 
of pain and hopeless weakness for an immor 
tality full of hope. Charles has wandere 1

my querulous lamentations, and soothed me 
into serenity  he tells me that he has done 
wrong by you, that he has perhaps offended 
you by not openly divulging his situation

" Miss Carvsford  Emma  do you not re- 
member that morning when your father blessed 
us together?" 
" Yes, Melville, I remember all." 
" That blessing I had not the courage to 
forego, it confirmed what till then I only sur- 
mised, that you were both strangers to Mari- 
anne's name, and the reports in circulation 
respecting our union. Reports which arose 
from no profession on my part since I held 
that dear and excellent creature as a sister, 
from my earliest remembrance. 'Tis true that 
about that period my uncle had expressed a 
desire to see us united in case of (that very 
improbable event) her recovery ; and from the 
feelings of her own tender heart, the dying

" Then will }'ou not give me also a father?

But in another moment she was folded in 
the arms of one who accepted her as the boon 
of heaven, which thus restored a daughter, 
and gave him the power of bestowing a 
father's blessing  from his hands Melville 
received her as the gift his heart had so many 
years yearned to bestow. The rapturous de- 
light, the fond gratitude, the sense of full con- 
solation for all his past sufferings, evinced by 
Melville at this happy moment, inspired the 
heart of Emma with the most pure and tender 
pleasure she had ever tasted ; but it was so 
combined with affecting recollections of the 
past, with devout aspirations for the future, 
and a sense of the errors and the sorrows to 
which human nature is subject, even under 
its most favourable aspect and circumstances, 
as to gently attemper her joy, and to pre- 
serve her Moderation.
