In the town of Belfont, in Ireland, lived
a learned physician of the name of Eve-
rard St. Clare. He had a brother, who,
misled by a fine but wild imagination,
which raised him too far above the in-
terests of common life, had squandered
away his small inheritance; and had
long roved through the world, rapt in
poetic visions, foretelling, as he pretend-
ed, to those who would hear him, that
which futurity would more fully develop.
Camioli was the name he had as,
sumed.
It was many years since Sir Everard
last beheld his brother, when one night

child, about five years of age, returned,
after long absence, to his native town,
and knocked at Sir Everard's door. The
doctor was at the castle hard by, and his
lady refused admittance to the mean-
looking stranger.
Without informing
her of his name, Camioli departed, and
resolved to seek his sister the Abbess of
Glenaa. The way to the convent was
long and dreary: he climbed, therefore,
with his lovely burthen to the topmost
heights of Inis Tara, and sought tempo-
rary shelter in a cleft of the mountain
known by the name of the " Wizard's
Glen." Bright shone the stars that night,
and to the imagination of the aged seer,
it seemed in sleep, that the spirits of de-
parted heroes and countrymen, freed from
the bonds of mortality, were ascending
in solemn grandeur before his eyes ;-
Glenarvon's form appeared before him-
his patron! his benefactor!- he spoke of
times long past, of scenes by all forgot,
pointed with a look of despondency to

his infant son!" Who shall protect the
orphan that is destitute ?" he cried-
" who shall restore him to the house of
his fathers !"
From visions so wild and terrible, the
soft sweet voice of his child awoke Ca-
mioli-" How cold and dreary it is, dear
father ; how lone these hills. I am weary
unto death, yet I fear to sleep."-" My
comforter, my delight, my little black-
eyed darling," said the Bard, (enveloping
her in his long dark mantle,) " I will
soon take
you to a place of safety. My
sister, the Abbess of Glenaa, lives in the
valley beneath the mountain: she will
protect my Elinor; and, in her mansion,
my child shall find an asylum. I shall
leave
you but for a short time; we shall
meet again, Elinor ;-yes, we shall meet
again.-Continue to live with St. Clara,
your aunt: obey her in all things, for
she is good: and may the God of Mercy

calamities, the power of looking into

futurity."-He spoke, and descending
the rugged mountain path, placed his
Elinor under the protection of his sister
the Abbess of Glenaa, and bidding her
farewell, walked hastily away.
The morning sun, when it arose, shone
bright and brilliant upon the valley of
Altamonte-its gay castle, and its lake.
But a threatening cloud obscured the sky,
as Camioli raised his eyes, and turned
them mournfully upon the ruined priory
of St. Alvin, and the deserted halls of Bel-
font.--" Woe to the house of Glenar-
von !" he said. 66 Woe to the house of
my patron and benefactor! Desolation
and sorrow have fallen upon the mighty.
-Mourn for the hero who is slain in
battle. Mourn for the orphan who is
left destitute and in trouble. ... Bright
shone the sun upon thy battlements, o
Belfont, on the morn when the hero bade
thee a last adieu. Cold are thy waters,

ther-no companion of boyish sports and
pleasures yet lives to greet him with one
cheering smile.There is not cleft one
tongue to welcome: him to his native
land; or, should he fall, one friend to
shed a tear upon his grave!"
Thus sung the Bard, while the red deer
were browsing upon the hills, and the
wind whistled through the arches and
colonnades of the Castle of Belfont, as if
in hollow murmurs for times which were
long past.-" Woe to the house of our
patron," said the frenzied old man, as
with bitter tears he departed:-" even in
this moment of time, the fairest star of
Belfont sets for ever: the widowed Coun-
tess of Glenarvon is dead dead in a fo-
reign country; and stranger hands alone

perform her obsequies," He spoke, and
looked, for the last time, upon the land
that he loved, then turned from it as if
for ever.... Previous, however, to his de-
parture from Ireland, Camioli again
sought his brother, (who was then an
inmate in the family of the Duke of Al-
tamonte,) for the purpose of commending
Elinor to his care.
Castle Delaval, the property of that
nobleman, was situated in a valley shel-
tered from every keen blast by a dark
wood of beach and fir. The river Elle,
taking its rise amidst the Dartland Hills,
flowed through the park, losing by de-
grees the character of a mountain torrent,
as it spread itself between rich and varied
banks in front of the castle, till it joined
the sea beyond the Wizard's Glen. The
town of Belfont stands close upon the
harbour, and from one of the highest
cliffs, the ruins of the convent of St.
Mary, and a modern chapel may yet be
seen, whilst Heremon and Inis Tara,

raising their lofty summits, capped with
snow, soar above the clouds.
The abbey of Beliont, and the priory
of St. Alvin, both the property of the
Glenarvon family, were now, in conse-
quence of the forfeiture of the late Earl
of that name, transferred to Lord de
Ruthven, a distant relation. The deserted
priory had fallen into ruin, and Belfont
abbey, as yet unclaimed by its youthful
inaster, and pillaged by the griping hand
of its present owner, exbibited a melan-
choly picture of neglect and oppression.
No cheerful fires blaze in its ancient
halls; no peasants and vassals feast under
its vaulted roofs.-Glenarvon, the hero,
the lord of the demesne is dead: he fell
on the bloody field of Culloden: his son
perished in exile: and Clarence de Ruth-
ven, his grandson, an orphan, in a foreign
land, had never yet appeared to petition
for his attainted titles and forfeited
estates.-Of relations and of friends he
had never heard.

Where are they who claim kindred
with the unfortunate? Where are they
who boast of friendship for the orphan
that is destitute and in trouble? Yet the
Duke of Altamonte, whose domains were
contiguous, and whose attachment ex-
tended to the son of his ancient friend,
had ofttimes written to his sister enquir-
ing into the fate of the child; but Lady
Margaret had answered her brother's let-
ters with coldness and indifference.

CHAPTER II.
It is the common failing of an ambitious
mind to over-rate itself-to imagine that
it has, by the caprices of fortune, been
defrauded of the high honours due to its
supposed superiority. It conceives itself
to have been injured to have fallen from
its destination ; and these unfounded
claims become the source of endless dig.
content. The mind, thus disappointed,
preys upon itself, and compares its pre-
sent lowliness with the imaginary heights
for which it fancies itself to have been
designed. Under the influence of these
reflections, the character grows sullen
and reserved, detaches itself from all
social enjoyments, and professes to de-
spise the honours for which it secretly
pines. Mediocrity and a common lot, a
man of this disposition cannot bring him.

self to endure; and he wilfully rejects
the little granted, because all cannot be
obtained to which he had aspired.
In this temper, the Duke of Altamonte
had retired from public affairs, and quit-
ted the splendour and gaiety of the court,
to seek in retirement that repose which,
of all men, he was the least calculated to
appreciate or enjoy. He had married
into a Roman Catholic family. In the
society of the Duchess, he had found
all that could sooth his wounded spirit:
in Mrs. Seymour, the duchess's sister, he
also welcomed a mild and unobtrusive
guest; while the project of uniting the
Lady Calantha Delaval, his only daugh-
ter, to her cousin William Buchanan,
heir presumptive to the Dukedom of Al.
tamonte, and son of his sister Lady Mar-
garet Buchanan, (the titles descending in
the female line,) occupied his thoughts,
and engrossed his attention.
To forward this favourite object, he
communicated to them both, that they

11
were destined for each other; and, by
employing them in the same occupations,
causing them to be instructed in the
same studies, and in every way contriv-
ing that they should be continually to-
gether, he hoped that early habits, and
the first affections of childhood, might
unite their hearts in inchissoluble bonds.
But how short-sighted, how little found-
ed in a right knowledge of human nature,
was this project! Habituated to the in-
timacy which subsists between near re-
lations, was it probable that love, when
the age of that passion arrived, would be
content with objects thus familiar; and
that the feelings of the heart would
quietly acquiesce in an arrangement
which had been previously formed upon
the calculations of interest and family
pride?-On the contrary, the system pur-
sued in their education, accustomed them
in their intercourse with each other, to
give way to their violent tempers, with-
out restraint; and the frequent recurrence

of petty quarrels, soon produced sentie
ments, which bordered on dislike; so
that at the moment when the Duke
hoped to exult in the success, he had to
contemplate the failure, of his project.
Happily, a most important event occur-
red at this time in his family, which turned
his thoughts into another channel.--The
Duchess, after a long period of ill health,
was pronounced by her physicians to be
once more in a situation to realize her
husband's most sanguine hopes." If I
have a boy," he cried, " from the hour
of his birth, all I possess shall be his.
Give me but a son, ye powers who rule
over destiny, and I consent to yield up
every other claim, privilege and posses-
sion."-The wish was heard, and at the
appointed time, the Duchess of Alta-
monte, after a few hours' illness, was de-
livered of a son and heir. It was in vain
for the Duke, that until this event he
said to himself daily as he arose from his
stately bed, that none other was his rival

GLEN ARVON.
13
in wealth or power ;- it was in vain that
friends surrounded him, and flatterers
attended upon his least commands :-
until this unexpected, and almost un-
hoped for, event, he could not be said to
have enjoyed one hour of felicity, so un-
wisely did he blind himself to every other
blessing which he possessed'; and so ar-
dently solicitous did he suffer his mind
to become, for that one boon which alone
had been refused to his prayers.
But
since the birth of his son, he looked
around him, and he had nothing left to
wish for upon earth; his heart became
agitated with its own satisfaction; and
the terror of losing the idol upon which
every feeling and affection was fixed,
rendered him more 'miserable than he
was even before the fulfilment of his
wishes.
The education of the Lady Calantha,
and William Buchanan was now entirely
laid aside; the feuds and tumults in the
adjacent countries were disregarded ; and

he might be said to live alone in those
apartments where, robed in state, and
cradled in luxury, the little infant lay
helpless, and unconscious of its honours
and importance. Not a breath of air was
suffered to blow too rudely upon the
most noble and illustrious Sidney Albert,
Marquis of Delaval. The tenants and
peasantry flocked, from far and near, to
do him homage, gazing in stupid wonder
on their future Lord. The Duchess
feebly resisted the general voice, which
encouraged an excess of care, hurtful to
the health of him, whom all were but
too solicitous to preserve. Yet the boy
flourished, unaffected by this adulation,
the endless theme of discussion, the
constant object of still increasing ido-
latry.
Without delay, the Duke resolved to
intimate to his sister, Lady Margaret
Buchanan, who was at Naples, the change
which had taken piace in ner son's ex-
pectations. He felt the necessity of soft-

ening the disclosure by every soothing
expression ; and, as he loved her most
sincerely, he wrote to urge her immediate
return, with all the warmth of fraternal
affection ;-informing her at the same
time of the circumstance which at once
occasioned bis delight, and her disap-
pointment. With what fond overweening
vanity did he then flatter himself, that
she, who was the next dearest object of
his affections, would share his present
joy ; and forgetful of the entire ruin of
her fondest hope, doat like him upon the
child who had deprived her son of all his
expectations ! He knew not Lady Mar-
garet :-less than any other, he knew
that fierce spirit which never yet had
been controled - which deemed itself
born to command, and would have
perished sooner than have endured re-
straint.
At this very period of time, having
bade adieu to brighter climes and more
polished manners, with all the gaiety of

apparent innocence, and all the brilliancy
of wit which belong to spirits light as
air, and a refined and highly critivated
genius, she was sailing in the prosecu-
tion of her accursed designs, accompa-
nied by a train of admirers, selected from
the flower of Italy, once again to visit
her native country. With their voices
and soft guitars, they chased away the
lingering hours; and after a fair and pro-
sperous voyage, proceeded, with their
equipages and attendants to Castle De-
laval.
Lady Margaret was received with de.
light at the house of her father, in her
native land. A burst of applause hailed
her first appearance before the wondering
crowd assembled to behold her. Fond
of admiration, even from the lowest, she
lingered on the terrace, which command-
ed the magnificent scenery of which

thanks for their flattering reception. Bu-
chanan alone met his mother without
one mark of joy. Cold and reserved,
from earliest childhood, he had never yet
felt attachment for any other being than
himself; and fully engrossed by the
splendour with which he was at all times
surrounded, he looked with indifference
on every event which did not promote or
prevent his own personal amusements.
He saw many new guests arrive without
experiencing the slightest accession of
pleasure and when those departed whom
he had been in the babit of seeing around
him, it seldom cost him even a momen-
tary regret. He had so long and so fre-
quently been informed that he was heir
of the immense possessions belonging to
his uncle, that he was overpowered by
the sense of his greatness ; nor did the
commiseration of his attendants, on his
disappointed hopes, awaken him to the
conviction of the great change which had
occurred since the birth of the Marquis

of Delaval. Indeed he seemed as indif.
ferent on this occasion as on all others.
Yet whatever his errors, he was at least
in person and manner all that Lady Mar-
garet could wish. She was also much
pleased with Calantha, and thought she
traced, in her radiant countenance, some
resemblance to her own.
The Duchess of Altamonte won the
affections of all who approached her,
She had a countenance in which languor
and delicacy added sensibility and grace
to beauty,--an air of melancholy half
veiled in smiles of sweetness, -and a
form soft and fragile as the bright fic-
tions of a poet's dream ; yet a visible
sadness had fallen upon her spirits, and
whilst she appeared alone to sooth and
bless every other heart, she seemed her-
self in need of consolation. Lady Mar-
garet's beauty irresistibly attracted; her
wit enlivened ; and her manners fasci-
nated-but the dreadful secrets of her
heart appalled!

Lady Margaret was not much liked by
Mrs. Seymour, nor by many other of the
guests who frequented the castle. Her
foreign domestics, her splendid attire,
her crafty smiles, and highly polished
manners,-all were in turn criticised and
condemned. But neither prejudice nor
vulgarity received from her lips the
slightest censure. She did not even ap-
pear to see the ill will shewn to her.
Yet many thought the discords and dis-
asters which occurred after her arrival in
Ireland, were the fruits of her intriguing
spirit, and all soon or late regretted her
presence at the castle, till then, the seat
of uninterrupted harmony and almost
slumberous repose.

CHAPTER III.,
Lady Margaret Delaval, only surviving
sister of the Duke of Altamonte, was
born in Ireland, where she remained until
her marriage with Captain Buchanan.
She then established herself at Naples ;
the fleet in which her husband served
being stationed in the Mediterranean Sea.
After the birth of her son William, she
immediately sent him to Ireland, there
to receive, under her brother's tuition,
an education more fitting the heir of Al.
tamonte, and the future husband of Lady
Calantha Delaval.

ensnaring the inexperienced by her art,
and fascinating the most wary by her
beauty and her talents. The charms of
her person and the endowments of her
mind were worthy of a better fate than
that which she was preparing for herself.
But, under the semblance of youthful
gaiety, she concealed a dark intriguing
spirit, which could neither remain at rest,
nor satisfy itself in the pursuit of great
and noble objects. She had been hurried
on by the evil activity of her own mind,
until the habit of crime had overcome
every scruple, and rendered her insen-
sible to repentance, and almost to re-
In this career, she had improved
to such a degree her natural talent of dis-
simulation, that, under its impenetrable
veil, she was able to carry on securely
her darkest machinations; and her un-
derstanding had so adapted itself to her
passions, that it was in her power to give,
in her own eyes, a character of grandeur
to the vice and malignity, which afforded

an inexplicable delight to her depraved
imagination.
While she was thus indulging her dis-
graceful inclinations, her heart became
attached with all her characteristic vio-
lence to Lord Dartford, a young English
nobleman, who had accompanied the
Countess of Glenarvon to Naples, and
who, after passing some months in her
society, had already made her the offer of
his hand. He no sooner, however, be.
held Lady Margaret than he left that ob-
ject of his first attachment; and the
short-lived happiness of guilty passion
was thus enhanced by a momentary
triumph over a beautiful and unfortunate
rival.  Lady Glenarvon lived not to
lament it: the blow which was given
by the hand she loved, went straight as
it was aimed; it pierced her heart ; she
did not long survive.
Her son, already advancing towards
manhood, she committed to the care of
the Count Gondimar, the only being

who, amongst the numerous attendants
in the hours of her prosperity, had re-
mained with her in this last trying scene,
and received her dying wishes." He
has no father," she said, weeping in re-
membrance of the gallant husband she
had lost; " but to you I consign this
jewel of my heart, the dear and only
pledge of my true and loyal love.
Whatever crime I have committed since
the loss of Glenarvon, my only protector,
let not a shade of it be cast upon my son,
or sully the bright splendor of his father's
fame! Promise a dying mother to pro-
tect her child, should he be restored to
his grandfather's titles and fortunes. To
you, to you I entrust him. Ah! see
that he be safely conducted to his own
country."
The Italian Count promised all that
Lady Glenarvon desired; and wept as he
kissed the faded cheek of the English
boy. But no sooner was the momentary
interest which he had conceived for the

unhappy sufferer at an end-no sooner
had Lady Glenarvon expired, than, dis-
regarding her last request, he sought
only to render himself useful and necs-
sary to her son. For this purpose he
eagerly assisted him in all his pursuits,
however criminal, and whilst he lived
upon the sums which were regularly sent
from Ireland to supply the necessary ex-
penses of his charge, he lost no oppor-
tunity of flattering Lord de Ruthven, the
present possessor of the estate, and of
conniving with him in the means of de
taing Glenarvon in Italy, and thus de-
priving him of a great share of his pro-
perty. Goudimar's lessons were, how-
ever, in this instance unnecessary; Gle-
narvon soon emancipated himself from
his tuition; and the utmost the base
Italian could boast was, that he had
assisted in perverting a heart already by
nature but too well inclined to misuse
the rare gifts with which it had been
endowed.,

OLENARVON,

Glenarvon passed the first years after
his mother's death, in visiting Rome and
Florence. He then expressed a wish of
entering the navy; and having obtained
his desire, he served under the command
of Sir George Buchanan. He even dis-
tinguished himself in his new profes-
sion ; but having done so, abruptly left
it.
Love, it was said, was the cause of this
sudden change in Glenarvon's intentions
-love for the most beautiful woman in
Florence. Young as he then was, his
talents and personal attractions soon
gained the object of his pursuit ; but a
dreadful tragedy followed this success.
The husband of Fiorabella revenged the
stigma cast upon his wife's fame, by in-
stantly sacrificing her to his vengeance ;
and, since that fatal deed, neither the
Chevalier nor Glenarvon had ever again
appeared in Florence,

found an avenger ; but the proud and

noble family of the Chevalier preserved
a faithful silence concerning that trans-
action. Glenarvon's youth prevented
any suspicion from falling upon him ;
and the death of Giardini was ascribed
to another, and a more dangerous hand.
Strange rumours were also circulated in
Ireland, after this event; it was every
where affirmed that Glenarvon had been
secretly murdered ; and Lady Margaret,
then at Naples, had even written to ap-
prize her brother of the report.

CHAPTER IV.
About the time of the disappearance
of Glenarvon, Captain Buchanan died;
Lady Margaret then expected that Lord
Dartford would immediately fulfil his
engagement, and reward her long and
devoted attachment to himself by the
offer of his hand. Count Gondimar was
with her at the time. In all companies,
in all societies, the marriage was con-
sidered certain. One alone seemed eager
to hear this report contradicted-one
who, dazzled by the charms and beauty
of Lady Margaret, had devoted himself,
from the first hour in which he had be-
held her, entirely to her service. The
name of the young enthusiast was Vi.
viani. A deep melancholy preyed upon
his spirits; a dark mystery enveloped his
fate, Gondimar had, with some coldpess,

introduced him to Lady Margaret. He
was the friend of the lost Glenarvon, he
said, and on that account alone he had
strong claims upon his affection. Lady
Margaret received the stranger with more
than common civility: his ill state of
health, his youth, his beauty, were
powerful attractions. He confided his
sorrows to her bosom; and soon he dared
to inform her that he loved.
Lady Margaret was now more than
usually attentive to Lord Dartford : the
day even for her intended nuptials was
supposed to be fixed. " Oh give not
that hand to one who values not the
prize," said the young Count Viviani,
throwing himself before her : " let not
Dartford call himself your lord ; his love
and mine must never be compared."-
"Go, foolish boy," said Lady Margaret,
smiling on her new victim : " I can be
your friend, as readily when I am Lord
Dartford's wife as now.'

earth : " You must be mine alone :
none other shall approach you." "The
disparity of our ages.' 66 What of that?"
Enough, enough. I will give my hand
to Dartford; my heart, you know, will
still be at your disposal." A deep blush
covered the pale cheek of Viviani, he
uttered one convulsive sigh, and left her
to ruminate on his hopeless fate ; for
every thing, he was informed, was pre-
pared for the approaching nuptials.
But they knew little of the nature of
man, who could conceive that Lord Dart-
ford had one serious thought of uniting
himself to Lady Margaret by any lasting
ties. On the contrary, he suddenly and
secretly, without even taking leave of
her, departed for england; and the first
letter which she received from him, to
inform her of his absenc, announced to
her, likewise, his marriage with a lady of
fortune and rank in bis native country.
Lady Margaret was at dinner with a
numerous company, and amongst them

the young count, when the letters from
England were placed before her. The
quivering of her lip and the rolling of her
dark eye might have betrayed, to a keen
observer, the anguish of a disordered spi-
rit; but, recovering herself with that self-
command which years of crime and deep
dissimulation had taught her, she con-
versed as usual, till it was time for her
to depart; nor till alone in her own
apartment did she suffer herself to give
vent to the fury which opprest her. For
some moments she paced the room in
silent anguish; then kneeling down and
calling upon those powers, whose very
existence she had so often doubted :
" Curse him! curse him!" she exclaim-
ed. "O may the curse of a bitter and
deeply injured heart, blast every promise
of his happiness; pursue him through
life; and follow him to the grave !
May he live to be the scorn of his ene-
mies, the derision of the world, without
one friend to soften his afflictions !

May those, whom he has cherished, for-
sake him in the hour of need; and the
companion he has chosen, prove a ser-
pent to betray him !-May the tear of
agony, which his falsehood has drawn
from these eyes, fall with tenfold bitter-
ness from his own !- And may this
blooming innocent, this rival, who has
supplanted me in his affections, live to
feel the pangs she has inflicted on my
soul; or perish in the pride of her youth,
with a heart as injured, as lacerated as
mine!-Oh, if there are curses yet un-
named, prepared by an angry God,
against offending man, may they fall
upon the head of this false, this cold-
hearted Dartford !"
She arose, and gasped for breath. She
threw up the sash of the window ; but
the cool air, the distant lashing of the
waves, the rising moon and the fine scene
before her, had no power to calm, even
for one moment, a heart torn by guilt
and tortured by self-reproach. A kuock

at the door roused her from her medita-
tions. It was the fair Italian boy ; he
had followed her ; for, at a glance, he
had penetrated her secret. With a smile

ness." What! in tears lady!" he said:
" is it possible? can a marriage, a disap-
pointment in love, overpower you thus!"
Lady Margaret, affecting a calmness she
could not feel, and opposing art to art,
endeavoured to repel his taunting expres-
sions. But he knew her thoughts, he at
once saw through the smiles and assumed
manners which blinded others; and at
this moment he watched her countenance
with malignant delight. It was the face
of an angel, distorted by the passions of
a dmon; and he liked it not the less
for the frailty it betrayed.
It bappened, however, that he had
just attained the means of turning the
tide of her resentment from its present
channel, and by awakening her ambition

favoured ; and I am already before-hand

importance than the loss of a lover-The

English papers from his pocket, " the

When they met again, the following
day, not one word was uttered upon the
dreadful subject of their former dis-
course : the compact between them was
considered as made: and when once
again the Count Viviani spoke of his
passion, and his hopes, Lady Margaret
reminded him of his vow ; and a fearful
silence ensued. Revenge and ambition
had urged her to a determination, which
a sentiment of prudence inclined her to
retract. Viviani, unconscious of her wa-
vering resolution, enjoyed a momentary
triumph. " Is not this extacy?" he
exclaimed, as he viewed the woman he
now considered as entirely bound to him.
" Is it not rapture thus to love?" "Re-
venge is sweet," she answered.  Will

agony, she shrunk from the caresses of
her importunate admirer.

From that hour he courted her with
unremitting assiduity : he was the slave
of every new caprice, which long indul.

awaken. But the promised hour of his
happiness was delayed ; and his passion
thus continually fed by hope, and yet
disappointed, overcame in his bosom
every feeling of humanity, till he no

tend to facilitate the immediate gratifi.

It was not long after Lady Margaret's
arrival at the castle that Count Gondi.
mar proposed returning to Italy. Pre-
vious to his departure, he sought his
friend Viviani, who was at this time con-
cealed in the town of Belfont, and who,
in order to promote his designs, had
never openly appeared at the castle,
" How strong must be the love," said
Gondimar, addressing him, " which can
thus lead you to endure concealment,
straits and difficulty! Return with me:
there are others as fair: your youthful
heart pictures to itself strange fancies ;
but in reality this woman is not worthy
of you. You love her not, and it is but
imagination wbich thus deceives you."
" I will not leave her-I cannot go," said
Viviani impatiently: "one burning pas.

sion annihilates in me every other con-
sideration! Ah! can it merit the name
of passion-the phrenzy which rages
within me! Gondimar, if I worshipped
the splendid star, that flashed along my
course, and dazzled me with its meteor
blaze, even in Italian climes, imagine
what she now appears to me, in these
cold northern regions. I too can some-
times pause to think whether the sacri.
fice I have made is not too great. But
I have drained the poisoned cup to the
dregs. I have prest the burning fire-
brand to my heart, till it has consumed
me and come what may, now, I am
resolved she shall be mine, though the
price exacted were blood." Gondimar
shuddered.
It was soon after this that he returned
to Italy. The evening before he depart-
ed, he once more in secret affectionately
embraced his friend. "She has deceived
me," cried Viviani; " Months have
glided by, and she still evades my suit.

But the hour of success approaches :
to-morrow :-nay, perhaps, to-night....
If thou, Gondimar-oh! if thou couldst
believe: yet wherefore should I betray
myself, or shew, to living man,
thought belonging to the darkest of hu-
man hearts. This alone know-I dare
do every thing: and I will possess her.
See, she appears--that form of majesty--
that brow of refulgent brightness. The
very air I breathe speaks to me of her
charms. What matters it to me, whilst
I gaze entranced upon her, if the earth
shake to its foundations, and rivers of
blood were streaming around me!-
Pity me, Gondimar.-Pardon me.-Fare.
well!"
Hurried on by mad passion, Viviani,
who constantly visited Lady Margaret,
was now upon the eve of fulfilling her
wishes. Yet once, in the hope of dis-
suading his savage mistress from her
bloody purpose, he placed the infant in
her arms, and bade her take pity on its

helpless innocence.
" See thy own-
thy brother's image in those eyes that
smile," he whispered ; "ah! can you
have the heart?" But Lady Margaret
turned from the child in haughty dis-
pleasure, thrusting it from her as if afraid
to look on it; and, for many days, would
not vouchsafe to speak to the weak in-
strument of her criminal ambition. Yet
he, even he, whose life had been one
continued course of profligacy, who had
misused his superior talents to the per-
version of the innocence of others, and
the gratification of his own ungoverned
passions, shuddered at the thought of
the fearful crime which he had engaged
himself to commit!
His knowledge of human nature, and
particularly of the worst part of it, was
too profound to depend upon any per-
sonal or immediate aid from Lady Mar-
garet: he, therefore, conceived a project
which, by any one but himself, would,
in every view of it, have been considered

as altogether desperate and impracticable.
It was, however, a maxim with Viviani,
which his practice and experience had
justified, that nothing is impossible to a
firmly united league of time, money, and
resolution. Alone, he could have ac.
complished nothing ; but he had a sa-
tellite long trained in his service, who
possessed every quality which fitted him
to assist the designs of such a master.
The name of this man was La Crusca.
In spite of a seeming wish to conceal
himself, in conformity, perhaps, with his
master's designs, this man was known at
the castle to be a servant to the Count,
and, by his flattery and the versatility of
his genius, had become familiar with a
few of its inhabitants; but shortly after
his arrival, he had been dismissed, and it
was now three months and more since
his departure.
One evening, according to custom,
Viviani having secretly entered the castle,
sought Lady Margaret in her own apart-

ment; his face was fearfully pale; his
hand trembled : he approached her, and
whispered vows of ardour and tenderness
in the ears of his mistress, and urged his
suit with every argument he could de-
vise to overcome her remaining scruples.
But when he had looked, in expectation
of a favourable answer, he sprung back
with terror from her; for it seemed as if
the fiends of hell were struggling in her
eyes and lips for looks and words with
which to express their horrid desire, al-
ready, without the aid of words, but too
sufficiently manifest! At length, break-
ing silence, and rising in scorn from her
seat: " Have I not promised myself to
you?" she whispered indignantly, " that
you thus persecute me for the perform-
ance of a voluntary vow? Do you think
your protestations can move, and your
arguments persuade? Am I a timid girl,

can make me yours but my own free
will; and never shall that will consign
me to such fate, till the sickly weed is
destroyed, and the fair and flourishing
plant restored to its wonted vigour and
due honors. "Lady, the deed is already
done! This night,
This night," said the Italian,
trembling in every limb, "yes, on this
fearful night, I claim the performance of
thy vow!" He spoke with an emotion
she could not mistake.--"Is it possible?"
she said, "my beautiful, my beloved
friend :" and his hand trembled as he
gave it her, in token of his assent.-
Fearing to utter another word, dreading
even the sound of their own voices, after
such a disclosure, she soon retired.
Was it to rest that Lady Margaret re-
tired ?-No-to the tortures of suspense,
of dread,ofagony unutterable. A thousand
times she started from her bed :-she

before her distracted mind, and pictured
dreams too horrible for words. Half suf-
focated by the fever and delirium of her
troubled imagination, she threw up the
sash of her window, and listened at-
tentively to every distant sound. The
moon had risen in silvery brightness ;

clear waters of Elle. The wind blew

and then was lost. Lady Margaret, as
if palsied by terror, remained fixed and
breathless on the spot;a step approach-

stealing along, as if anxious no one
should hear it pass. Again, all was si-
lent:-90 silent, that the grave itself had
not been more tranquil, and the dead
could not have looked more pale, more
calm, more still, than Lady Margaret !
But how was that silence broken? and

nial train; and that proud mansion, so
lately the seat of gaiety, whose lighted
porches and festive halls had echoed to
the song of joy and revelry, presented
now a scene of lamentation, terror, and
despair.... The heir of Altamonte was
dead-the hope so fondly cherished was
cut off-the idol, upon whose existence
so many hearts were fixed, lay in his
gilded cradle and costly attire, affording
a lesson impressive, although every day
repeated, yet unheeded, although impres-
sive-that it is the nature of man to
rest his most sanguine expectations upon
the most frail and uncertain of all his
possessions.
The women who had been employed
to attend upon him were weeping around
him. His nurse alone appeared utterly
insensible to his fate-her eyes . were

fixed-her lips motionless--she obeyed
every command that was given ; but,
when left to herself, she continued in the
same sullen mood. Some called her hard
and unfeeling, as in loud accents they
bewailed the dire calamity that had
fallen on their master's house; but there
were others who knew that this apparent
insensibility was the effect of a deeper
feelingof a heart that could not recover
its loss-of a mind totally overthrown.
She had arisen that morning at her ac-
customed hour, to take to her breast the
little infant who slept in the cradle beside
her. But lifeless was that form which,
a few hours before, she had laid on its
pillow, in the full enjoyment of health.
Spasms, it was supposed, had seized the
child in his sleep; for his face was black
and dreadfully disfigured. All efforts
to recover him were fruitless. Physician
nor medicine could avail the hand of
death had struck the flower the vital
spark was extinguished.

It was in vain that a distracted mother,
pressing his cold lips to hers, declared, in
the
agony of hope, that they still retained
a living warmth.-It was in vain that she
watched him till her eyes, deceived, fan-
cied they saw a change imperceptible to
others--a breath of life restored to that
lifeless breathless form. It was in vain :
-and floods of grief, with the sad rites
of a pompous funeral, were all which the
afflicted Duke and his sorrowing family
had to bestow.
Thetenants and peasantry were, accord-
ing to ancient custom, admitted to sing
the song of sorrow over the body of the
child: but no hired mourners were re-
quired on this occasion; for the hearts of
all deeply shared in the affliction of their
master's house, and wept, in bitter woe,
the untimely loss of their infant Lord.-
It was thus they sung, ever repeating the
same monotonous and melancholy strain.

Oh loudly sing the Pillalu,
And many a tear of sorrow shed ;
Och orro, orro, Olalu ;

At morn, along the eastern sky,
We marked an owl, with heavy wing;
At eve, we heard the beshees cry;
And now the song of death we sing ;
Och orro, orro, Olalu.
Ah! wherefore, wherefore would ye die;
Why would ye leave your parents dear:
Why leave your sorrowing kinsmen here,
Nor listen to your people's cry!
How will thy mother bear to part
With one so tender, fair, and sweet!
Thou wast the jewel of her heart,
The pulse, the life that made it beat.
How sad it is to leave her boy,
That tender flow'ret all alone:
To see no more his face of joy,
And soothe no more his infant moan!

And by the pleasant banks of Larney,

Thus singing, they approached the

than all the grandeur which his rank de-

grave; while a long mourning and entire
seclusion from the world, proved that the
sorrow thus felt was not momentary, but
lasting as the cause which had occasioned
it was great.

CHAPTER VI.
As sickness falls heaviest on those who
are in the full enjoyment of health, so
grief is most severe, when it comes unex-
pectedly, in the midst of happiness.It
was from this cause, that the Duke,
more than any one in his family, gave
vent to the sorrows of his heart; and
murmured at the irrecoverable loss, by
which he had been afflicted. The Duch-
ess in vain attempted to share and lessen
the regret of her husband he had that
haughtiness of mind which disdains all
confidence, and flies from all consolation.
But of her far keener suffering, for the
loss she had sustained, little shew was
made ; for real misery delights not in
reproaches and complaints. It is like
charity and love-silent, long suffering,
and mild.

are among its characteristic features; and
these were all possessed by the Duchess
of Altamonte, who seemed to live for no
other purpose than to endear herself to
those who surrounded her.
With this consideration for others, and
forgetfulness of self, she had apparently
endured the loss of her son with greater
fortitude, than had been expected: in-
deed she sustained it with a degree of
firmness which religion alone could have

inspired : she murmured not; but sub-
mitted to the trial with the meek spirit
of pious resignation."My dear, dear
boy, my pretty Albert" would sometimes
escape her, and a few tears would wait
upon the exclamation ; but her whole
study was to lighten the sorrows of her
husband; as well as to check the intem-
perate complaints, and soothe the more
violent agitations of Lady Margaret.
But while her soul rose superior to the
ills of life, her constitution, weakened by
a long period of ill health, and by the
agitations of extreme sensibility, was not
in a state to resist so great a shock; and
though she lingered upwards of a year,
the real cause of her death could not
be mistaken :- an inward melancholy
preyed upon her spirits, which she com-
bated in vain.-"Many have smiled in
adversity," she would say ;

is the will of Heaven, and I resign myself

away."
On her death-bed, she said to the
Duke ; " This is a hard trial for you to
bear; but God, who, when he sends trials,
can send strength also, will, I trust, sup-
port you. You will pursue your career
with that honour and dignity, which has
hitherto distinguished it-nor would my
feeble aid assist you in it. But I, on the
contrary, like a weak unsupported plant,

me. It is far better as it is. You will

watched over her, and directed her as I
ought. But to you, while she smiles and
plays around you, and fills the space

lifeless bosom-when piercing shrieks

in Calantha's bosom, the love of her
mother prevailed over every other feeling.
A long and violent illness succeeded,
in Calantha; a torpor which astonish-

and from this state, she recovered only to
give way to a dejection of mind not less
alarming. But even her grief was to be

presence of her Creator.
The great effort of Lady Margaret
was to crush the struggles of passion ;
and when, at times, the agony of her mind
was beyond endurance, she found it some
relief to upbraid the wretch who had ful-
filled her own guilty wishes."Mon-

tender or honourable feeling, take these
detested and bloody hands from my sight:

cent that was ever born to bless a mo-

the wild expression of her eye-the look
of horror which she cast upon him; and
a deep and lasting resentment combated
in his breast every feeling of attachment.

" Is it possible," said Lady Margaret,

countenance upon that form which
scarcely had attained to manhood is
it within the compass of possibility that
one so young should be so utterly hard-

Very shortly after this interview, he
quitted Ireland, vainly endeavouring in
the hour of his departure to conceal the
deep emotion by which he was agitated
at thus tearing himself from one who
appeared utterly indifferent to his ha-
tred, his menaces, or his love.

The habit of years, though broken and
interrupted by violent affliction or sudden
prosperity, fails not in the end to resume
its influence over the mind; and the
course that was once pursued with satis-
faction, though the tempest of our pas-
sions may have burried us out of it, will
be again resumed, when the dark clouds
that gathered over us, have spent their
fury. Even he who is too proud to bow
his mind to the inevitable decrees of an all-
wise Creator--who seeks not to be con-
soled, and turns away from the voice of
piety-even he loses sight at length of
the affliction, upon which his memory

hope rises at last upon his clouded spirit
and exhausted frame.
From a state of despondency and vain
regret, in which more than a year had
been passed, the inhabitants of Castle
Delaval, by slow degrees, revived ; and
the Duke, wearied of a life so gloomy and
solitary, summoned, as before, his friends
around him. Lady Margaret, however,
was no longer the gay companion of his
morning walks, the life and amusement
of his evening assemblies. The absence
of Viviani filled her with anxiety ; and
the remembrance of her crimes embitter-
ed every hour of her existence. If she
turned her eyes upon Calantha, the de-
jected expression of that countenance
reproached her for the mother whose life
she had shortened, and whose place she
vainly exerted herself to fill ; if upon the
Duke, in that care-worn cheek and brow
of discontent, she was more painfully re-
minded of her crime and ingratitude ; and
even the son for whom so much had been
sacrificed, afforded her no consolation.

Buchanan estranged himself from her
confidence, and appeared jealous of her
authority.-He refused to aid her in the
sole remaining wish of her heart ; and
absolutely declined accepting the hand
of Calantha. " Shall only one will,"
he said, " be studied and followed ;
shall Calantha's caprices and desires be
daily attended to; and shall I see the
best years of my life pass without plea-
sure or profit for me? I know I see
your intention ; and, pardon me, dearest
mother, if I already bitterly lament it.
Is Calantha a companion fitted for one
of my character ; and, even if here-
after it is your resolve to unite me
to her, must I now be condemned to
years of inactivity on her account. Give
me my liberty ; send me to college, there
to finish my education ; and permit
me to remain in England for some years.

mined language of her son, that he had

dom. She immediately appeared to ap-
prove his intention :-she said that a
noble ambition, and all the highest qua-
lities of the heart and mind were shewn
in his present desire; but one promise
she must exact in return for the readi-
ness with which she intended instantly
to accede to his request ;--provided he
were left at liberty till a maturer age,
would he promise to take no decisive step
of himself, until he had once more seen
Calantha after this separation? To this
Buchanan willingly acceded. His plans
were soon arranged ; and his departure
was fixed for no very distant period.
The morning before he left the castle,
Lady Margaret called him to her room ;
and taking him and Calantha by the hand,
she led them to the windows of the
great gallery. Thence pointing to the
vast prospect of woods and hills, which
extended to a distance the eye could
scarcely reach, " all are yours my chil.
dren," she said, " if, obedient to parents

who have only your welfare at heart, you
persevere in your
intention of being one
day united to each other. Ah ! let no dis-
putes, no absence, no fancies have power
to divert you from the fulfilment of this,
my heart's most fervent wish :- let this
moment of parting obliterate every un-
kind feeling, and bind you more than
ever to each other. Here, Buchanan,"
she continued, "is a bracelet with your
hair:-place it yourself around Calantha's
arm :-she shall wear it till you meet.",
The bracelet was of gold, adorned with
diamonds, and upon the clasp, under the
initial letters of their names, were en-
graved these words :
" Stesso sangue,
Stessa sorte." Take it," said Bucha-
nan, fastening it upon the arm of Calan-
tha, and remember that, for my sake, you
are to wear it ever."
At this moment, even he was touched,
as he pressed her to his heart, and re-
membered her as associated with all the
scenes of his happiest days. Her vio-

lence, her caprices, her mad frolics, were
forgotten; and as her tears streamed
upon his bosom, he turned away, least
his mother should witness his emotion.
Yet Calantha's tears were occasioned
solely by the thought of parting from
one, who had hitherto dwelt always be-
neath the same roof with herself ; and to
whom long habit had accustomed, rather
than attached, her.-In youth the mind
is so tender, and so alive to sudden and
vivid impressions, that in the moment of
separation it feels regret and melancholy
at estranging itself even from those for
whom before it had never felt any warmth
of affection.Still at the earliest
age
the
difference is distinctly marked between
the transient tear, which falls for imagi-
nary woe, and the real misery which at-
tends upon the loss of those who have
been closely united to the affections by
ties, stronger and dearer than those of
habit.

CHAPTER VIII.
The accomplishment of her favourite
views being thus disappointed, or at least
deferred, Lady Margaret resolved to
return to Italy, and there to seek Vi-
viani. Her brother, however, entreated
her to remain with him. He invited bis
friends, his relations, his neighbours.
Balls and festivities once more enlivened
the castle: it seemed his desire to raze
every trace of sorrow from the memory
of his child ; and to conceal the ravages
of death under the appearance at least of
wild and unceasing gaiety. The brilliant
ftes, and the magnificence of the Duke
of Altamonte and his sister, became the
constant theme of admiration; and from
far, from near, fashion and folly poured
forth their victims to grace and to en-
joy them: Lord and Lady Dartford na-

turally found their place amidst the va-
rious and general assemblage. To see
Lord Dartford again, to triumph over his
falsehood, to win him from an innocent
confiding wife, and then betray him at
the moment in which he fancied bimself
securethis vengeance was yet wanting
to satisfy the restless fever of Lady Mar-
garet's mind; and the contemplation of
its acromplishment gave a new object, a
new hope to her existence ; for Lady
Margaret had preferred even the tortures
of remorse to the listless insipidity of stag-
nant life, where the passions of her heart
were without excitement, and those ta-
lents of which she felt the power, useless
and obscured. What indeed would she
not have preferred to the society of Mrs.
Seymour and her daughters ?
The Duchess of Altamonte had pos-
sessed a mind, as cultivated as her own,
and a certain refinement of manner which
is sometimes acquired by long intercourse
with the most polished societies, but is

more frequently the gift of nature, and,
if it be not the constant attendant upon
nobility of blood, is very rarely found in
those who are not distinguished by that
adventitious and accidental circumstance.
Mrs. Seymour had many of the excel-
lent qualities, but none of the rare en-
dowments possessed by the Duchess :
she was a strict follower of the paths of
custom and authority: in the steps
which had been marked by others, she
studiously walked, nor thought it allow-
able to turn aside for any object however
desirable. She might be said to delight
in prejudice--to enjoy herself in the ob-
scure and narrow prison to which she
had voluntarily confined her intellects-
to look upon the impenetrable walls
around her as bulwarks against the hos-
tile attacks by which so many had been
overcome. She was a Roman Catholic,
and all who differed from that persuasion
were, in her opinion, utterly lost. The
daughters were strictly trained in the

opinions of their mother.
The season
of youth" she would say, " is the season
of instruction;"and consequently every
hour had its allotted task ; and every ac-
tion was directed according to some es-
tablished regulation.
By these means, Sophia and Frances
were already highly accomplished ; their
manners were formed ; their opinions
fixed, and any contradiction of those
opinions, instead of raising doubt, or ur-
ging to inquiry, only excited in their
minds astonishment at the hardihood and
contempt for the folly which thus oppo-
sed itself to the final determination of the
majority, and ventured to disturb the
settled empire and hereditary right of
their sentiments and manners.--" These
are your pupils," Lady Margaret would
often exultingly cry, addressing the mild
Mrs. Seymour: "these paragons of pro-
prietythese sober minded steady auto-
matons. Well, I mean no harm to them
or you. I only wish I could shake off

ing to my system of education-the sys-
tem which nature dictates and every
feeling of the heart willingly accedes to.
Observe well the difference between a
child of an acute understanding, before
her mind has been disturbed by the ab-
surd opinions of others, and after she has
learned their hackneyed jargon : note
her answersher reflections ; and you
will find in them, all that philosophy can
teach, and all to which science and wis-
dom must again return. But, in your
girls and in most of those whom we meet,
how narrow are the views, how little the
motives, by which they are impelled!
Even granting that they act rightly, that
by blindly following, where others lead,
they pursue the safest course, is there
any thing noble, any thing superior in
the character from which such actions

spring. I am ambitious for Calantha,
I wish her not only to be virtuous ; I
will acknowledge it-I wish her to be
distinguished and great.
Mrs. Seymour, when thus attacked,
always permitted Lady Margaret to gain
the victory of words, and to triumph
over her as much as the former thought
it within the bounds of good breeding to
allow herself; but she never varied, in
consequence, one step in her daily course,
or deviated in the slightest degree from
the line of conduct which she had before
laid down.
Sometimes, however, she would re.
monstrate with her niece, when she saw
her giving way to the violence of her
temper, or acting, as she thought, ab-
surdly or erroneously ; and Calantha,
when thus admonished, would acknow-
ledge her errors, and, for a time at least,
endeavour to amend them ; for her heart
was accessible to kindness, and kindness
she at all times met with from Mrs. Sey-
mour and her daughters.
## p. 71 (#93) ##############################################

71
It was indeed Calantha's misfortune to
meet with too much kindness, or rather
too much indulgence from almost all who
surrounded her. The Duke, attentive
solely to her health, watched her with
the fondest solicitude, and the wildest
wishes her fancy could invent were
heard with the most scrupulous attention,
and gratified with the most unbounded
compliance. Yet, if affection, amount-
ing to idolatry, could in any degree atone
for the pain the errors of his child too
often occasioned him, that affection was
felt by Calantha for her father.
Her feelings indeed swelled with a
tide too powerful for the unequal resis-
tance of her understanding :-her motives
appeared the very best, but the actions
which resulted from them were absurd
and exaggerated. Thoughts, swift as
lightning, hurried through her brain :-
projects, seducing, but visionary crowded
upon her view : without a curb she fol-
lowed the impulse of her feelings; and
## p. 72 (#94) ##############################################
72
GLENARVON,
those feelings varied with every varying
interest and impression.
Such character is not uncommon,
though rarely seen amongst the higher
ranks of society. Early and constant
intercourse with the world, and that po-
lished sameness which results from it,
smooths away all peculiarities ; and
whilst it assimilates individuals to each
other, corrects many faults, and represses
many virtues.
Some indeed there are who affect to
differ from others : but the very affecta-
tion proves that, in fact, they resemble
the ordinary mass; and in general this
assumption of singularity is found in low
and common minds, who think that the
reputation of talent and superiority be-
longs to those very defects and absurdi-
ties which alone have too often cast a
shade upon the splendid light of genius,
and degraded the hero and the poet, to
the level of their imitators.
Lovely indeed is that grace of manner,

73
that perfect ease and refinement which
so many attempt to acquire, and for which
it is to be feared so much is too often
renounced the native vigour of mind,
the blush of indignant and offended in-
tegrity, the open candour of truth, and
all the long list of modest unassuming
virtues, known only to a new and unsul-
lied heart.
Calantha turned with disgust from the
slavish followers of prejudice. She dis-
dained the beaten track, and she thought
that virtue would be for her a safe, a
sufficient guide ; that noble views, and
pure intentions would conduct her in a
higher sphere; and that it was left to her
to set a bright example of unshaken
rectitude, undoubted truth, and honour-
able fame. All that was base or mean,
she, from her soul, despised: a fearless
spirit raised her, as she fondly imagined,
above the vulgar herd: self-confident,
she scarcely deigned to bow the knee
before her God: and man, as she had

GLENARVON,
read of him in history, appeared too
weak, too trivial, to inspire either alarm
or admiration.
It was thus, with bright prospects,
strong love of virtue, high ideas of ho-
nour, that she entered upon life. No
expense, no trouble had been spared in
her education : masters, professors, and
governesses surrounded her. She seemed
to have a decided turn for every thing it
was necessary for her to learn : instruc-
tion was scarcely necessary, so readily
did her nature bend itself to every art,
science and accomplishment. Yet never
did she attain excellence, or make pro-
ficiency in any; and when the vanity of
a parent fondly expected to see her a
proficient in all acquirements suited to
her sex and age, he had the mortification
of finding her more than usually ignorant,
backward and uninstructed. With an ear
the most sensible and accurate, she could
neither dance nor play ; with an eye
acute and exact, she could not draw; at

75
the same time, with a spirit that bounded
within her from excess of joyous happi-
ness, she was bashful and unsocial in
society; and with the germs of every vir-
tue that commands esteem and praise,
she was already the theme of discussion,
observation and censure.
Yet was Calantha loved-dearly and
fondly loved ; nor could Mrs. Seymour,
though constantly discovering new errors
in her favourite, prevent her from being
the very idol of her heart. Calantha
saw it through all her assumed coldness;
and she triumphed in the influence she
possessed. But Sophia and Frances were
not as cordially her friends :--they had
not reached that age, at which lenity and
indulgence take place of severer feelings,
and the world appears in all its reality
before us. To them, the follies and frail-
ties of others carried with them no ex-
cuse, and every course which they them .
selves did not adopt, was assuredly er-
roneous.

Calantha passed her time as much as
possible by herself: the general society
at the castle was uninteresting to her.
The only being for whom she felt regard,
was Sir Everard St. Clare, brother to Ca-
mioli the bard, and late physician to her
mother, and he was the usual object of
ridicule to almost all his acquaintance.
Lady St. Clare in pearls and silver; Lau-
riana and Jessica, more fine if possible,
and more absurd than their mother; Mrs.
Emmet, a lady from Cork, plaintive and
reclining in white sattin and drapery; and
all the young gentlemen of large pro-
perty and fortune, whom all the young
ladies were daily and hourly endeavour-
ing to please, had no attraction for a mind
like Calantha's. Coldly she therefore
withdrew from the amusements natural
to her age; yet it was from embarrass-
ment, and not from coldness, that she
avoided their society. Some favorites
she already had : the Abbess of Glenaa,
St. Clara her niece, and above all Alice

77
Mac Allain, a beautiful little girl of
whom her mother had been fond :-
these had already deeply interested her
affections.
In the company of one or other of
these, Calantha would pass her morn-
ings ; and sometimes she would stand
alone upon the summit of the cliff, hour
after hour, to behold the immense ocean,
watching its waves, as they swelled to
the size of mountains, and dashed with
impetuous force against the rocks below:
or she would climb the mountain's side,
and gaze on the lofty summits of Here-
mon and Inis Tara, lost in idle and vi-
sionary thought. At other times joyous,
and without fear, like a fairy riding on a
sun-beam through the air, chasing the
gay images of fancy, she would join in
every active amusement, and suffer her
spirits to lead her into the most extra-
vagant excess.

CHAPTER X.
Love, it might be conjectured, would
early shew itself in a character such as
Calantha's; and love, with all its ardour
and all its wildness had already subdued
her heart. What, though Mrs. Seymour
had laid it down as a maxim, that no
one, before attaining their fourteenth
year, could possibly be in love! What,
though Lady Margaret indignantly as-
serted, that Calantha could not, and
should not, look even at any other than
him for whom her hand was destined !
She had looked; she had seen ; and
what is more, she believed the impression
at this time made upon her heart was as
durable as it was violent.
Sophia Seymour, Mrs. Seymour's
eldest daughter, in a month, nay in a
week, had discovered Calantha's secret :

the same feeling for the same object had
given her an acuteness in this instance,
with which she was not at all times
gifted :-she herself loved, and, therefore,
perceived her cousin's passion. Calan-
tha's manner immediately confirmed her
in her supposition.
She entered one
morning into her room :-she saw the
unfinished drawing ;-she could not mis-
take it - that commanding air that
beaming eye-there was but one whom
it could resemble, and that one was
Henry Mowbrey, Earl of Avondale. She
taxed Calantha with her partiality: "But
he thinks not of you," she said, and
haughtily left the room.
Admiral Sir Richard Mowbrey was an
old and valued friend of the Duke of Al-
tamonte. He had served with Sir George
Buchanan, brother-in-law to Lady Mar.
garet. He had no children; but his ne-
phew, the young Earl of Avondale, was,
next to his country, the strongest and
dearest interest of his heart. What happi-

ness must the Admiral then have felt
when he beheld him ; and found that,
in mind and person, he was distinguished
by every fair endowment.
Lord Ayon-
dale had entered the army young: he
now commanded a regiment: with a
spirit natural to his age and character, he
had embraced his father's profession;
and like him, he had early merited the
honours conferred upon him. He had
sought distinction at the hazard of his
life; but happily for all who knew bim
well, he had not, like his gallant father,
perished in the hour of danger; but,
having seen hard service, had returned to
enjoy, in his own country, the ease, the
happiness, and the reputation he so well
deserved.
Lord Avondale's military occupations
had not, however, prevented bis cultivat-
ing his mind and talents in no ordinary
degree ; and the real distinctions he had
obtained, seemed by no means to have
lessened the natural modesty of his cha-

81
racter. He was admired, flattered, sought
after; and the strong temptations to
which his youth had thus early been ex-
posed, had, in some measure, shaken his
principles, and inflamed his imagination.
Happily a noble mind and a warm un-
corrupted heart soon led him from scenes
of profligacy to a course of life more
manly and useful :--deep anxiety for a
bleeding country, and affection for his
uncle, restored him to himself. He quit-
ted London, where, upon his first return
from abroad, he had for the most part re
sided, and his regiment being ordered to
Ireland, on account of the growing dis-
affection in that country, he returned
thither to fulfil the new duties which his
profession might require. Allanwater
and Monteith, his father's estates, had
been settled upon him : but he was more
than liberal in the arrangements he made
for his uncle and the other branches of
his family.
Many an humbler mind had escaped

the danger to which Lord Avondale had,
early in life been exposed :many a less
open character had disguised the too dar-
ing opinions he had once ventured to
cherish! But, with an utter contempt
for all hypocrisy and art-with a frank-
ness and simplicity of character, some-
times observed in men of extraordinary
abilities, but never attendant on the or-
dinary or the corrupted mind, he appear-
ed to the world as he really felt, and
neither thought nor studied whether such
opinions and character were agreeable to
his own vanity, or the taste of his com-
panions ; for whom, however, he was, at
all times, ready to sacrifice his time, his
money, and all on earth but his honour
and integrity.
Such was the character of Lord Avon.

perhaps, by the interest shewn him, but
reserved and distant to every too appa-
rent mark of it, he viewed the motley
groupe before him, as from a superior
height; and he smiled with something
of disdain, at times, as he inarked the
affectation, the meanness, the conceit,
and, most of all, the heartlessness, and
cowardice of many of those around him.
Of a morning, he would not unfrequently
join Calantha and Sophia in their walks ;
and of an evening, he would read to the
former, or make her his partner at bil-
liards, or at cards. At such times, So-
phia would work at a little distance; and
as her needle monotonously passed the
silken thread through the frame to which
her embroidery was fixed, her eyes would
involuntarily turn whither her thoughts,
in spite of her endeavours, too often
strayed. Calantha listened to the oft-
repeated stories of the admiral; and
heard of his battles, his escapes and his
dangers, when others were weary of the

well-known topics ; but he was Lord
Avondale's uncle, and that thought made
every thing he uttered interesting to her.
" You love," said Alice Mac Allain
one day to her mistress, as they wandered
in silence along the banks of the river
Elle; " and he who made you alone can
tell to what these maddening fires may
drive a heart like yours. Remember your
bracelet - remember your promises to
Buchanan; and learn, before it is too
late, in some measure to control your-
self, and disguise your feelings." Ca-
lantha started from Alice; for love, when
it first exists, is so timid, so sacred, that
it fears the least breath of observation,
and disguises itself under every borrowed
name. " You are wrong," said Calan-
tha: " I would not bend my free spirit
to the weakness of which
you
would ac-
cuse me, for all the world can offer:

Calantha will never acknowledge a mas-
ter ;-will never yield her soul's free and
immortal hopes to any earthly affection.

Fear not, my counsellor, that I will for-
sake my virgin vows, or bow my un-
broken spirit to that stern despot, whose
only object is power and command.
As Calantha spoke, Lord Avondale
approached, and joined them. The deep
blush that crimsoned over her cheek was
a truer answer to her friend's accusation
than the one she had just uttered.-
Heremon and Inis Tara have charms
for both of you," he said, smiling :-you
are always wandering either to or from
them." They are our own native
mountains," said Calantha, timidly ;--
"the land-marks we have been taught to
reverence from our earliest youth."
" And could you not admire the black
mountains of Morne as well," he said,
: fixing his eyes on Calantha," my na-
tive mountains ?They are higher far
than these, and soar above the clouds
that would obscure them." They are
too lofty and too rugged for such as we
are," said Calantha.
" We may gaze at

their height and wonder ; but more
would be dangerous.
6. The roses and
myrtles blossom under their shade," said
Lord Avondale with a smile ; " and Al-
lanwater, to my mind, is as pleasant to
dwell in as Castle Delaval." "Shall
you soon return thither, my lord?" en-
quired Calantha. " Perhaps never," he
said, mournfully; and a tear filled his
eye as he turned away, and sought to
change the subject of conversation.
Lady Margaret had spoken to Lord
Avondale :-perhaps another had engag-
ed his affections:-at all events, it seem-
ed certain to Calantha that she was not
the object of his hope or his grief. To
have seen him to have admired him,
was enough for her: she wished not for
more than that privilege ; but she felt
that every affection of her heart was en-
gaged, even though those affections were
unreturned.

CHAPTER XI.
To suffer the pangs of unrequited love
was not, however in the present instance,
the destiny of Calantha. That dark
eye, ,
the lustre of whose gaze she durst not
meet, was, at all times fixed upon her ;
and the quick mantling blush and beam-
ing smile, which lighted the counte-
nance of Lord Avondale, whenever her
name was pronounced before him, soon
betrayed, to all but himself and Calantha,
how much and how entirely his affec-
tions were engaged. He was of a na-
ture not easily to be flattered into admi-
ration of others not readily attracted,
or lightly won ; but, once having fixed
his affections, he was firm, confiding and
incapable of change, through any change
of fortune. He was, besides, of that af-
fectionate and independent character,

that as neither bribe nor power could
have moved him to one act contrary to
his principles of integrity, so neither
danger, fatigue, nor any personal con-
sideration could have deterred him from
that which he considered as the business
and duty of his life.
He possessed a
happy and cheerful disposition, a frank
and winning manner, and that hilarity of
heart and countenance which rendered
him the charm and sunshine of every
society.
When Lord Avondale addressed Ca-
lantha, she answered him in a cold or
sullen manner, and, if he endeavoured
to approach her, she fled unconscious
of the feeling which occasioned her em-
barrassment. Her cousins, Sophia and
Frances, secure of applause, and con-
scious of their own power of pleasing,
had entered the world neither absurdly
timid, nor vainly presuming: -  they
knew the place they were called upon to
fill in society ; and they sought not to

cutstep the bounds which good sense had
prescribed. Calantha, on the other hand,
scarce could overcome her terror and
confusion when addressed by those with
whom she was little acquainted. But
how far less dangerous was this reserve
than the easy confidence which a few
short years afterwards produced! and
how little did the baughty Lady Marga-
ret imagine, as she chid her viece for this
excess of timidity, that the day would,
perhaps, soon arrive, when careless of
the presence of hundreds, Calantha might
strive to attract their attention, by the
very arts which she now despised, or
pass thoughtlessly along, hardened and
utterly insensible to their censure or
their praise !
To a lover's eyes such timidity was not
unpleasing ; and Lord Avondale liked
not the girl he admired the less, for that
crimson blush--that timid look, which
scarcely dared encounter bis ardent gaze.
To him it seemed to disclose a heart new

to the worldunspoiled and guileless.
Calantha's mind, he thought, might now
receive the impression which should be
given it; and while yet free, yet un-
tainted, would it not be happiness to
secure her as his own-to mould her
according to his fancy-to be her guide
and protector through life!
Such were his feelings, as he watched
her shunning even the eyes of him, whom
alone she wished to please :-such were
his thoughts, when, flying from the
amusements and gaiety natural to her
age, she listened with attention, while he
read to her, or conquered her fear of en-
tering into conversation with him. He
seemed to imagine her to be possessed
of every quality which he most admired;
and the delusive charm of believing that
he was not indifferent to her heart, threw
a beauty and grace over all her actions,
which blinded him to every error. Thus
then they both acknowledged, and sur-
rendered themselves to the power of love.
## p. 91 (#113) #############################################
GLENARVON.

Calantha for the first time yielded up
her heart entirely to its enchantment;
and Lord Avondale, for the last.
It is said there is no happiness, and no
love to be compared to that which is felt
for the first time. Most persons errone-
ously think so; but love, like other arts,
requires experience, and terror and igno-
rance, on its first approach, prevent our
feeling it as strongly as at a later period.
Passion mingles not with a sentiment so
pure, so refined as that which Calantha
then conceived, and the excess of a lover's
attachment terrified and overpowered the
feelings of a child.
Storms of fury kindled in the eye of
Lady Margaret, when she first observed
this mutual regard. Words could not
express her indignation ;-to deeds she
had recourse. Absence was the only
remedy to apply; and an hour, a mo-
ment's delay, by opening Calantha's

even this ineffectual. She saw that the
flame had been kindled in a heart too sus-
ceptible, and in which opposition would
increase its force:---she upbraided her
brother for his blindness, and reproached
herself for her folly. There was but one
way left, which was to communicate the
Duke's surmises and intentions to the
Admiral in terms so positive, that he
could not mistake them, and instantly to
send for Buchanan. In pursuance of
this purpose, she wrote to inform him
of every thing which had taken place,
and to request him without loss of time
to meet her at Castle Delaval. Mrs.
Seymour alone folded Calantha to her bo-
som without one reproach, and, consign-
ing her with trembling anxiety to a fa-
ther's care, reminded him continually,
that she was his only remaining child,
and that force, in a circumstance of such
moment, would be absolute cruelty.

CHAPTER XII.
LADY Margaret insisted upon removing
Calantha immediately to London; but
Lord Avondale having heard from the
Admiral the cause of her intended depar-
ture, immediately declared his intention
of quitting Ireland. Every thing was now
in readiness for his departure; the day
fixed; the hour at hand. It was not
perhaps till Lord Avondale felt that he
was going to leave Calantha for ever,
that he was fully sensible how much,
and how entirely his affections were en-
gaged.
On the morning previous to his depar-
ture, Calantha threw the bracelet, which
Lady Margaret and her cousin had given
her, from her arm ; and, weeping upon
the bosom of Alice, bitterly lamented her
fate, and informed her friend that she

never, never would belong to Buchanan.
-Lord Avondale had in vain sought an
opportunity of seeing her one moment
alone. He now perceived the bracelet on
the floor of the room she had just quitted:
and looking upon it, read, without being
able to comprehend the application of
the inscription, " Stesso sangue, Stessa
sorte."-He saw her at that moment:-
she was alone :he followed her :-she
fled from him, embarrassed and agitated;
but he soon approached her :they fly
so slowly, who fly from what they love.
Lord Avondale thought he had much
to say-many things to ask :-he wished
to explain the feelings of his heart-to
tell Calantha, once at least before he
quitted her, how deeply-how dearly he
had loved-how, though unworthy in
his own estimation of aspiring to her
hand, the remembrance of her should
stimulate him to every noble exertion,
and raise him to a reputation which,
without her influence, he never could

attain :-he thought that he could have
clasped her to his bosom, and pressed
upon her lips the first kiss of love the
dearest, the truest pledge of fondness
and devotion, But, scarcely able to
speak, confused and faultering, he dared
not approach her: he saw one before
him robed in purity, and more than ves-
tal innocence - one timidly fearful of
even a look, or thought, that breathed
aught against that virtue which alone it
worshipped.
" I am come," he said, at length, ,
" forgive my rashness, to restore this
bracelet, and myself to place it around
your arm. Permit me to say-farewell,
before I leave you, perhaps for ever."
As he spoke, he endeavoured to clasp
the diamond lock ;-his hand trembled ;
Calantha started from him. 4 Oh!" she
said, " you know not what you do :-I
am enough his already :-be not you the
person to devote me to him more com-
pletely:--do not render me utterly mi-

serable. Though not entirely under-
standing her he scarcely could command
himself. Her look, her manner-all
told him too certainly that which over-
came his heart with delight."She loves
me," he thought, "and I will die sooner
than yield her to any human being :-
she loves me; and, regardless of fears-
of prudence-of every other feeling, he
pressed her one moment to his bosom.
" Oh, love me, Calantha," was all he
had time to say ; for she broke from him,
and fled, too much agitated to reply.
That he had presumed too far, he feared;
but that she was not indifferent to him,
he had heard and seen. The thought
filled him with hope, and rendered him
careless of all that might befall him.
The Duke entered the room as Calan-
tha quitted it." Avondale," he said,
offering himhis hand, " speak to me, for
I wish much to converse with
you
before
we part :-all I ask is, that you will not
deceive me. Something more than com-

mon "engrosses your thoughts even
now I observed you with my child."
- I must indeed speak with you,"
said Lord Avondale firmly, but with
considerable agitation. Every thing
I hold dear--my life--my happiness-
depend on what I have to say." He
then informed the Duke with sincerity
of his attachment for Calantha-proud
and eager to acknowledge it, even though
he feared that his hopes might never be
realized,
"I am surprised and grieved," said
the Duke, " that a young man of your
high rank, fortune, and rising fame,
should thus madly throw away your af-
fections upon the only being perhaps
who never must, never ought, to return
them. My daughter's hand is promised
to another. When I confess this, do not
mistake me:-No force will ever be made
use of towards her; her inclinations will
at all times be consulted, even though
she should forget those of her parent; but

she is now a mere child, and more infan.
tine and volatile withal, than it is pos-
sible for you to conceive. There can
be no necessity for her being now called
upon to make a decided choice. Bucha-
nan is my nephew, and since the loss of
my son, I have centered all my hopes in
him. He is heir to my name, as she is
to my fortune; and surely then an union
between them, would be an event the
most desirable for me and for my family.
But such considerations alone would
not influence me. I will tell you those
then which operate in a stronger mavner:
-I have given my solemn promise to my
sister, that I will do all in my power to
assist in bringing about an event upon
which her heart is fixed. Judge then,
if, during her son's absence, I can dispose
of Calantha's hand, or permit her to see
more of one, who has already, I fear, made
some impression upon her heart."
Lord Avondale appeared much agi-
tated. --The Duke paused-then-conti-

have me believe-granting, my dear
young friend, that, captivated by your
very superior abilities, manners, and
amiable disposition, she has in part re-
turned the sentiments you acknowledge
in her favour-cannot you make her the
sacrifice I require of you? - Yes.-
Though you now think otherwise, you
can do it. So short an acquaintance
with each other authorizes the tern I
use :- this is but a mere fancy, which
absence and strength of mind will soon
overcome.
Lord Avondale was proud even to a
fault. He had listened to the Duke
without interrupting him; and the Duke
continued to speak, because he was afraid
of hearing the answer, which he con-
cluded would be made. For protesta-
tions, menaces, entreaties, he was pre-
pared; but the respectful silence which
continued when he ceased, disconcerted
him.-" You are not angry?" he said:

" let us part in friendship:--do not go
from me thus :you must forgive a fa-
ther :-remember she is my child, and
bound to me by still dearer ties-she is
my only one." His voice faultered, as
he said this :-he thought of the son
who had once divided his affections, and
of whom he seldom made mention since
his loss.
Lord Avondale, touched by his man-
ner and by his kindness, accepted his
hand, and struggling with pride-with
love,-" I will obey your commands,"
he at length said, " and fly from her pre-
sence, if it be for her happiness :-her
happiness is the dearest object of my life.
Yet let me see her before I leave her."
" No," said the Duke, "it is too dan-
" If this must not be," said
Lord Avondale, " at least tell her, that

trust, to consign her to a happier fate.

CHAPTER XIII.
AFTER this conversation, Calantha saw
no more of her lover: yet he was very
anxious to see her once again, and much
and violently agitated before he went.
A few words which he had written to her
he gave into Mrs. Seymour's own hands;
and this letter, though it was such as to
justify the high opinion some had formed
of his character, was but little calculated
to satisfy the expectations of Calantha's
absurdly romantic mind; or to realize
the hopes she had cherished. It was not
more expressive of his deep regret at
their necessary separation, than of his
anxiety that she should not suffer her
spirits to be depressed, or irritate her
father by an opposition which would
prove fruitless. " He does not love
you, Calantha," said Lady Margaret, with

GLENARVON.
103
a malicious smile, as soon as she had
read the letter-(and every one would
read it):" when men begin to speak
of duty, they have ceased to love."
This remark gave Calantha but little
consolation. Lord Avondale had quitted
her too, without even bidding her fare-
well; and her thoughts continually dwelt
on this disappointment.
Calantha knew not then that her mi.
sery was more than shared that Lord
Avondale, though too proud to acknow-
ledge it, was a prey to the deepest grief
upon her accountthat he lived but in
the hope of possessing the only being
upon earth to whom he had attached
himself and that the sentence pro-
nourced against both, was a death stroke
to his happiness, as well as to her own.
When strong love awakes for the first
time in an inexperienced heart it is so
diffident, so tremblingly fearful, that it
dares scarcely hope even for a return;

in such exaggerated colours, and the su-
perior excellence of the object we wor-
ship arises so often to our view, that it
seems but the natural consequence of
our own presumption, that we should be
neglected and forgotten.
Of Admiral Sir R. Mowbrey, Calan-
tha now took leave without being able
to utter one word: she wept as children
weep in early days, the heart's convul-
sive sob free and unrestrained. He was
as much affected as herself, and seeking

straight to England, began an eager at.
tack upon her, with all the blunt asperity
of his nature. Indeed he bitterly re-
proached himself, and all those who had
influenced him, in what he termed his
harsh unfeeling conduct in this affair.
" And as to you, madam," he cried,
addressing Lady Margaret, " you make
two young people wretched, to gratify
the vanity of your son, and acquire

a fortune, which I would willingly yield
to you, provided the dear children
might marry, and go home with me
to Allanwater, a place as pretty, and
far more peaceful than any in these
parts: there, I warrant, they would live
happy, and die innocentwhich is more
than most folks can say in these great
palaces and splendid castles.
A smile of contempt was the only an-
swer Lady Margaret deigned to give.-
Sir Richard continued, " you are all a
mighty fine set of people, no doubt, and
your assemblies, and your balls are
thronged and admired; but none of
these things will make the dear child
happy, if her mind is set upon my ne-
phew. I am the last in the world to
disparage any one; but my nephew is
just as proper a man, in every point of
view, as your son ; aye, or any body's
son in the whole world; and so there is
my mind given free and hearty ; for there
is not a nobler fellow, and there never

can be, than Henry Avondale :- he is as
brave a soldier as ever fought for his
country ; and in what is he deficient?"
Lady Margaret's lips and cheeks were
now become livid and pale -- a fatal
symptom, as anger of that description, in
ages,
has led to evil deeds ; whereas
the scarlet effusion has, from the most
ancient times been accounted harmless.
" Take Lady Calantha then," exclaimed
Lady Margaret, with assumed calmness,
while every furious passion shook her
frame; " and may she prove a serpent
to your bosom, and blast the peace of
your whole family." " She is an angel!"
exclaimed the Admiral, " and she will
be our pride, and our comfort."
She is
a woman," returned Lady Margaret with
a malicious sneer; " and, by one means
or other, she will work her calling.
Calantha's tears checked Sir Richard's
anger ; and, his carriage being in readi-
ness, he left the castle immediately after
this conversation.

CHAPTER XIV.
It may be easily supposed that Lady
Margaret Buchanan and Mrs. Seymour
had a most cordial dislike for each other.
Happily, at present, they agreed in one
point: they were both desirous of rousing
Calantha from the state of despondency
into which Lord Avondale's departure
had thrown her. By both, she was ad-
monished to look happy, and to restrain
her excessive grief. Mrs. Seymour spoke
to her of duty and self-control. Lady
Margaret sought to excite her ambition
and desire of distinction. One only sub-
ject was entirely excluded from conver-
sation : Lord Avondale's name was for-
bidden to be mentioned in her presence,
and every allusion to the past was to be
studiously avoided.
Lady Margaret, however, well aware

108
GLENARVON.
that whosoever transgressed this regula-
tion would obtain full power over her
niece's heart, lost no opportunity of thus
gaining her confidence and affection.
Having won, by this artifice, an easy
and favorable audience, after two or three
conversations upon the subject most
interesting to Calantha, she began, by
degrees, to introduce the name, and with
the name such a representation of the
feelings of her son, as she well knew to
be best calculated to work upon the
weakness of a female heart. Far different
were his real feelings, and far different
his real conduct from that which was
described to her niece by Lady Margaret.
She had written to him a full account of
all that had taken place; but his answer,
which arrived tardily, and, after much
delay, had served only to increase that
lady's ill humour, and add to her disap-
pointment. In the letter which he sent
to his mother, he openly derided her ad-
vice; professed entire indifference to-

wards Calantha; and said that, indubi.
tably, he would not waste his thoughts
or time in humouring the absurd fancies
of a capricious girl;that Lord Avon-
dale, or any other, were alike welcome to
her hand;-that, as for himself, the world
was wide, and contained women enough
for him; he could range amongst those
frail and fickle charmers without sub-
jecting his honour and his liberty to their
pleasure; and, since the lady had already
dispensed with the vows given and re-
ceived at an age when the heart was
pure, he augured ill of her future con-
duct, and envied not the happiness of the
man it was her present fancy to select:-
he professed his intention of joining the
army on the continent: talked of leaden
hail, glory and death! and seemed re-
solved not to lessen the merit of any
exploits he might achieve, by any want
of brilliancy in the colouring and descrip-
tion of them.
Enraged at this answer, and sickening

at his conceit, Lady Margaret sent imme-
diately to entreat, or rather to command,
his return. In the mean time, she talked
much to Calantha of his sufferings and
despair; and soon perceiving how greatly
the circumstance of Lord Avondale's
consenting to part from her had wounded
her feelings, and how perpetually she
recurred to it, she endeavoured, by the
most artful interpretations of his conduct,
to lower him in her estimation. Sarcas-
tically contrasting his coldness with Bu-
chanan's enthusiasm : " Your lover,"
she said, " is, without doubt, most dis-
interested !-His eager desire for your
happiness is shown in every part of his
conduct!--Such warmth-such delicacy!

piety distinguishes the whole of his be-

burthen of his creed! He seems even to
dread the warmth of your affection!

And how, my
imprudence it may carry you!-Why he
is a perfect model, is he not? But let me
ask you, my dear niece, is love, accord-
ing to your notions and feelings, thus
cool and considerate ?-does it pause to
weigh right and duty ?-is it so very ra-
tional and contemplative?...," Yes,"
replied Calantha, somewhat picqued.

lit-
tle philosopher, did you acquire so pre-
maturely this wonderful insight into the
nature of love?" " By feeling it," said
Calantha, triumphantly; "and by com-
paring my own feelings with what I have
heard called by that name in others."
As she said this, her colour rose, and
she fixed her quick blue eyes full upon
Lady Margaret's face; but vainly did
she endeavour to raise emotion there ;
that countenance, steady and unruffled,
betrayed not even a momentary flash of

anger : her large orbs rolled securely, as
she returned the glance, with a look of
proud and scornful superiority. "My
little niece," she said, tapping her gently
on the head, and taking from her cluster-
ing locks the comb that confined them,
my little friend is grown quite a sati-
rist, and all who have not had, like her,
every advantage of education, are to be
severely lashed, I find, for the errors they
may, inadvertently, have committed."
As she spoke, tears started from her eyes.
Calantha threw herself upon her bosom. .
"0, my dear aunt," she said, "my dear-
est aunt, forgive me, I entreat you. God
knows I have faults enough myself, and
it is not for me to judge of others, whose
situation
may have been very different
from mine. Is it possible that I should
have caused your tears? My words, must
indeed, have been very bitter ; pray for-
give me.'
." "Calantha," said Lady Mar-
garet, you are already more than for-
given; but the tears I shed were not

occasioned by your last speech ; though
it is true, censure from one's children,
or those one has ever treated as such, is
more galling than from others. But,
indeed, my spirits are much shaken. I
have had letters from my son, and he
seems more hurt at your conduct than
I expected :-he talks of renouncing his
country and his expectations; he says that
if indeed his Calantha, who has been the
constant object of his thoughts in ab-
scence, can have already renounced her
vows and him, he will never intrude his
griefs upon her, nor ever seek to bias her
inclinations: yet it is with deep and last-
ing regret that he consents to tear you
from his remembrance and consign you
to another."
Calantha sighed deeply at this unex-
pected information, to condemn any one
to the pangs of unrequited love was
hard: she had already felt that it was no
light suffering; and Lady Margaret, see-
ing how her false and artful representa-

tions had worked upon the best feelings
of an inexperienced heart, lost no oppor-
tunity of improving and increasing their
effect.
These repeated attempts to move Ca-
lantha to a determination, which was
held out to her as a virtuous and ho-
nourable sacrifice made to duty and to
justice, were not long before they were
attended with success. Urged on all
sides continually, and worked upon by
those she loved, she at last yielded with
becoming inconsistency; and one eve-
ning, when she saw her father somewhat
indisposed, she approached him, and
whispered in his ear, that she had
thought better of her conduct, and would
be most happy in fulfilling his commands
in every respect. " Now you are a he-
roine, indeed," said Lady Margaret, who
had overheard the promise: " you have
shewn that true courage which I ex-
pected from you-you have gained a
victory over yourself, and I cannot but

115
feel proud of you." Aye," thought
Calantha, " flattery is the chain that will
bind me; gild it but bright enough, and
be secure of its strength : you have
found, at last, the clue; now make use
of it to my ruin."
"She consents," said Lady Margaret;
"it is sufficient; let there be no delay ;
let us dazzle her imagination, awaken
her ambition, and gratify her vanity by
the most splendid presents and prepa-
rations!"

CALANTHA's jewels and costly attire
her equipages and attendants, were now
the constant topic of conversation.
Every rich gift was ostentatiously exhi-
bited; while congratulations, were on all
sides, poured forth on
forth on the youthful
bride. Lady Margaret, eagerly dis-
playing the splendid store, asked her
if she were not happy.-" Do not,"
she replied, addressing her aunt, " do
not fancy that I am weak enough to
value these baubles : - My heart is
at least free from a folly like this: I de-
spise this mockery of riches." "You
despise it !" repeated Lady Marga-
ret, with an incredulous smile :-"you
despise grandeur and vanity! Child be-
lieve one who knows you well, you wor-
ship them : they are your idols ; and

while your simple voice sings forth ro-
mantic praises of simplicity and retire-
ment, you have been cradled in luxury,
and you cannot exist without it."
Buchanan was now daily, nay even
hourly expected:-Lady Margaret awaited
him with anxious hope; Calantha, with
increasing fear. Having one morning
ridden out to divert her mind from the
dreadful suspense under which she la-
boured, and meeting with Sir Everard,
she enquired of him respecting her former
favourite: " Miss Elinor," said the doc-
tor, " is still with her aunt, the abbess
of Glanaa; and, her noviciate being over,
she will soon, I fancy, take the veil. You
cannot see her; but if your Ladyship
will step from your horse, and enter into
my humble abode, I will shew you a por-
trait of St. Clara, for so we now call her,
she being indeed a saint; and sure you
will admire it." Calantha accompanied
the doctor, and was struck with the sin-
gular beauty of the portrait. Happy

St. Clara," she said, and sighed:--"your
heart, dedicated thus early to Heaven,
will escape the struggles and temptations
to which mine is already exposed. Oh!
that I too, might follow your example ;
and, far from a world for, which I am not
formed, pass my days in piety and peace.
Thatevening, as the Duke of Altamonte
led his daughter through the crowded
apartments, presenting her to every one
previous to her marriage, she was sud.
denly informed that Buchanan was ar-
rived. Her forced spirits and assumed
courage at once forsook her; she fled to
her room ; and there giving vent to her
real feelings, wept bitterly.--"Yet why
should I grieve thus?" she said:-"What
though he be here to claim me? my hand
is yet free:- I will not give it against
the feelings of my heart." Mrs. Seymour
had observed her precipitate flight, and
following, insisted upon being admitted.
She endeavoured to calm her; but it was
too late.
## p. 119 (#141) ############################################
GLENARVON.
119
From that day, Calantha sickened :-
the aid of the physician, and the care of
her friends were vain :-an alarming ille
ness seized upon her mind, and affected
her whole frame. In the paroxysm of her
fever, she called repeatedly upon Lord
Avondale's name, which confirmed those
around her in the opinion they enter-
tained, that her malady had been occa-
sioned by the violent effort she had made,
and the continual dread under which she
bad existed for some time past, of Bu-
chanan's return. Her father bitterly
reproached himself for his conduct;
watched by her bed in anxious suspence;
and under the impression of the deepest
alarm, wrote to his old friend the admiral,
informing him of his daughter's danger,
and imploring him to urge Lord Avon-
dale to forget what had passed, and to
hasten again to Castle Delaval.-Hestated
that, to satisfy his sister's ambition, the
greater part of his fortune should be set-
tled upon Buchanan, to whom his title

descended; and if, after this arrangement,
Lord Avondale still continued the same
as when he had parted from Calantha,
he only requested his forgiveness of his
former apparent harshness, and earnestly
besought his return without a moment's
loss of time.
His sister he strove in vain to ap-
pease:-Lady Margaret was in no temper
of mind to admit of his excuses. Her
son had arrived and again left the castle,
without even seeing Calantha; and when
the Duke attempted to pacify Lady Mar-
garet, she turned indignantly from him,
declaring, that, if he had the weakness to
yield to the arts and stratagems of a
spoiled and wayward child, she would
instantly depart from under his roof,
and never see him more. No one event
could have grieved him so much, as this
open rupture with his sister, Yet
his child's continued danger turned his
thoughts from this and every other con-
sideration :-he yielded to her wishes :-

he could not endure the sight of her mi-
sery :-he had from her infancy never
refused her slightest request :-and could
he now, on so momentous an occasion,
could he now force her inclinations and
constrain her choice.
The kind intentions of the Duke were,
however, defeated. Stung to the soul, ,
Calantha would not hear of marriage with
Lord Avondale :--pride, a far stronger
feeling than love, at that early period,
disdained to receive concessions even
from a father : and a certain moroseness
began to mark her character, as she slowly
recovered from her illness, which never
had been observed in it before. She be-
came austere and reserved; read nothing
but books of theology and controversy ;
seemed even to indulge an inclination
for a monastic life; was often with Miss
St. Clare ; and estranged herself from all
other society.

Margaret, "it is the only means of curing

her of this new fancy."The Duke,
however, thought otherwise: he was
greatly alarmed at the turn her disposi-
tion seemed to have taken, and tried every
means in his power to remedy and coun-
teract it. A year passed thus away; and
the names of Buchanan and Lord Avon-
dale were never or rarely mentioned at the
castle ; when one evening, suddenly and
unexpectedly, the latter appeared there
to answer in person, a message which the
Duke had addressed to him, by means of
the Admiral, during his daughter's illness.
Lord Avondale had been abroad since
last he had parted from Calantha ; he
had gained the approbation of the army
in which he served ; and, what was bet-
ter, he knew that he deserved it. His
uncle's letter had reached him when still
upon service. He had acted. upon the
staff: he now returned to join his own
regiinent, which was quartered at. Lei-

was, to see the Duke, and to claim, with
diminished fortune and expectations, the
bride his early fancy had chosen.-"I
will not marry him-I will not see him:"
-These were the only words Calantha
pronounced, as they led her into the
room where he was conversing with her
father.
When she saw him, however, her feel-
ings changed. Every heart which has
known what it is to meet, after a
long estrangement, the object of its first,
of its sole, of its entire devotion, can
picture to itself the scene which followed.
Neither pride, nor monastic vows, nor
natural bashfulness, repressed the full
flow of her happiness at the moment
when Lord Avondale rushed forward to
embrace her, and, calling her his own
Calantha, mingled his tears with hers.-
The Duke, greatly affected, looked upon
them both. 6. Take her," he said, ad-
dressing Lord Avondale, "and be as-
sured, whatever her faults, she is my

Be kind to
her :--that I know you will be, whilst
the enthusiasm of passion lasts : but ever
be kind to her, even when it has subsided:
remember, she has yet to learn what it
is to be contrould. "She shall never
learn it," said Lord Avondale, again
embracing her: " by day-by night,
I have lived but in this hope: she shall
never repent her choice." "The God
of Heaven vouchsafe his blessing upon
you," said the Duke."My sister may
call this weakness; but the smile on my
child's countenance is a sufficient re-
ward."

CHAPTER XVI.
What Lord Avondale had said was true,
-One image had pursued him in every
change of situation, since he had parted
from Calantha; and though he had
scarcely permitted his mind to dwell on
hope; yet he felt that, without her, there
was no happiness for him on earth ; and
he thought that once united to her, he
was beyond the power of sorrow or mis-
fortune. So chaste, even in thought, she
seemed-so frank and so affectionate,
could he be otherwise than happy with
such a companion? How then was he
astonished, when, as soon as they were
alone, she informed him that, although
she adored him, she was averse to the
fetters he was so eager to impose. How
was he struck to find that all the chime-
rical, romantic absurdities, which he most

despised, were tenaciously cherished by
her; to be told that dear as he was,
her freedom was even dearer; that she
thought it a crime to renounce her vows,
her virgin vows; and that she never
'would become a slave and a wife ;-he
must not expect it.
Unhappy Avondale! even such an
avowal did not open his eyes, or deter
him from his pursuit. Love blinds the
wisest : and fierce passion domineers
over reason. The dread of another sepa-
ration inspired him with alarm. Agitated
-furious-he now combatted every ob .
jection, ventured every promise, and loved
even with greater fondness from the in-
creasing dread of again losing what he
had hoped was already his own.-Men
of the world are without religion," said
Calantha with tears ; " Women of the
world are without principle. Truth is
regarded by none. I love and honor
my God, even more than I love you ;
and truth is dearer to me than life. I am

not like those I see :-my education, my
habits, my feelings are different ; I am
like one uncivilized and savage; and if
you place me in society, you will have
to blush every hour for the faults I shall
involuntarily commit. Besides this ob.
jection, my temper-I am more violent
Oh that it were not so ! but can J,
ought I, to deceive you?" You are all
that is noble, frank, and generous : you
shall guide, me," said Lord Avondale,
" and I will protect you. Be mine:
fear me not: your principles I venerate:
your religion I will study, will learn,
will believe in. What inore?"
Lord Ayondale sought and won that
strange uncertain being, for whom he
was about to sacrifice so much... He-con-
sidered not the lengthened journey of
life-the varied scenes through which
they were to pass ; where all the quali-
ties in which she was wholly deficient
would be so often and so absolutely
required-discretion, prudence, firm and

steady principle, obedience, humility.
But to all her confessions and remon-
strances he replied : " I love, and you
return my passion : can we be otherwise
than blest! You are the dearest object
of my affection, my life, my hope, my
joy. If you can live without me, which
I do not believe, I cannot without you,
and that is sufficient. Sorrows must
come on all, but united together we can
brave them. My Calantha, you torture
me but to try me.
Were I to renounce
you, were I to take you at your word,
you, you would be the first to regret and
to reproach me." : " It is but the name
of wife I hate," replied the spoiled and
wayward child.
" I must command :
??
Your will shall be my
law," said Lord Avondale, as he knelt
before her : " you shall be m mistress,
my guide, my monitress, and I a willing
slave." So spoke the man, who, like
the girl he addressed, had died sooner
than have yielded up his freedom or his
my will

129
independence to another ; who, high
and proud, had no conception of even the
slightest interference with his conduct
or opposition to his wishes ; and, who, at
the very moment that in words he yielded
up his liberty, sought only the fulfilment
of his own desire, and the attainment of
an object upon which he had fixed his
mind.
The day arrived. A trembling bride,
and an impassioned lover faintly articu-
lated the awful vow. Lord Avondale
thought himself the happiest of meh ;
and Calantha, though miserable at the
moment, felt that, on earth, she loved
but him. In the presence of her assem-
bled family, they uttered the solemn en-
gagement, which bound them through
existence to each other; and though
Calantha was deeply affected, she did not
regret the sacred promise she had made.
When Lord Avondale, however, ap-
proached to take her from her father's
arms--when she heard that the carriages,

awaited which were to bear them to
another residence, nor love, nor force
prevailed. " This is my home," she
cried : " these are my parents. Share
all I have-dwell with me where I have
ever dwelt; but think not that I can quit
them thus." No spirit of coquetry, no
petty airs, learned or imagined, suggested
this violent and reiterated exclamation :
" I will not go." I will not, was suffi-
cient, as she imagined, to change the most
determined character; and when she
found that force was opposed to her vio-
lence, terror, nay, abhorrence took posses-
sion of her mind; and it was with shrieks
of despair she was torn from her father's
bosom.
Unhappy Avondale !" said Sophia,
as she saw her thus borne away, may
that violent spirit grow tame and tract-
able, and may Calantha at length prove
worthy of such a husband!" This ex-
clamation was uttered with a feeling
which mere interest for her cousin could

not have created. In very truth, Sophia
loved Lord Avondale. And Alice Mac
Allain, who heard the prayer with sur-
prise and indignation, added fervently:
" that he may make her happy; that he
may know the value of the treasure he
possesses ; this is all I ask of Heaven.
Ob! my mistress-my protectress-my
Calantha-what is there left me on earth
to love, now thou art gone? Whatever
they may say of thy errors, even those
errors are dearer to my heart than all the
virtues thou hast left behind."

CHAPTER XVII.
It was at Allanwater, a small villa amidst
the mountains, in the county of Leitrim,
that Lord and Lady Avondale passed
the first months of their marriage. This
estate had been settled upon Sir Richard
Mowbrey, during his life time, by his
brother, the late Earl of Avondale. It
was cheerful, though retired ; and to
Calantha's enchanted eyes appeared all
that was most romantic and beautiful
upon earth. What indeed had not ap-
peared beautiful to her in the company of
the man she loved! Everyone fancies that
there exists in the object of their peculiar
admiration a superiority over others.
Calantha, perhaps, was fully justified in
this opinion. Lord Avondale displayed
even in his countenance the sensibility of
a warm, ardent, and generous character.
## p. 133 (#155) ############################################
GLENARVON.
133
He had a distinguished and prepossessing
manner, entirely free from all affectation.
It is seldom that this can be said of any
man, and more seldom of one possessed
of such singular beauty of person. He
appeared indeed wholly to forget himself;
and was ever more eager in the interests
of others than his own. Many there are,
who, though endowed with the best un-
derstandings, have yet an inertness, an
insensibility to all that is brilliant and
accomplished ; and who, though correct
in their observations, yet fatigue in the
long intercourse of life by the sameness
of their thoughts. Lord Avondale's un-
derstanding, however, fraught as it was
with knowledge, was illumined by the
splendid light of genius, yet not over-
thrown by its force. In his mind, it
might be truly said, that he did not
cherish one base, one doubtful or worldly
feeling. He was so sincere that, even in
conversation, he never mis-stated, or ex-
aggerated a fact. He saw at a glance the
## p. 134 (#156) ############################################
194
GLENARVON.
faults of others; but his extreme good
nature and benevolence prevented his
taking umbrage at them. He was, it is
true, of a hot and passionate temper, and
if once justly offended, firm in his re-
solve, and not very readily appeased ;
but he was too generous to injure or to
hate even those who might deserve it.
When he loved, and he never really
loved but one, it was with so violent, so
blind a passion, that he might be said to
doat upon the very errors of the girl to
whom he was thus attached. To the
society of women he had been early ac-
customed ; but had suffered too much
from their arts, and felt too often the
effects of their caprices, to be easily
made again their dupe and instrument.
Of beauty he had ofttimes been the wil-
ling slave. Strong passion, opportunity,
and entire liberty of conduct, had, at an
early period, thrown him into its power.
His profession, and the general laxity of
morals, prevented his viewing his former

GLENARVON.
135
conduct in the light in which it appeared
to his astonished bride; but when she
sighed, because she feared that she was
not the first who had subdued his affec-
tions, he smilingly assured her, that she
should be the last that no other should
ever be dear to him again.
Calantha, in manner, in appearance, in
every feeling, was but a child. At one
hour, she would look entranced upon
Avondale, and breathe vows of love and
tenderness ; at another, hide from his
gaze, and weep for the home she had left.
At one time she would talk with him
and laugh from the excess of gaiety she
felt; at another, she would stamp her
foot upon the ground in a fit of childish
impatience, and exclaiming, " You must
not contradict me in any thing," she
would menace to return to her father,
and never see him more.
If Lord Avondale had a defect, it was
too great good nature, so that he suffered
his vain and frivolous partner, to com.

mand, and guide, and arrange all things
around him, as she pleased, nor foresaw
the consequence of her imprudence,
though too often carried to excess.
With all his knowledge, he knew not
how to restrain ; and he had not the ex-
perience necessary to guide one of her
character :-he could only idolize ; he
left it to others to censure and admonish.
It was also for Calantha's misfortune,
that Lord Avondale's religious opinions
were different from those in which she
had been early educated. She, as has
been heretofore related, was a Roman
Catholic, and had adopted with that ex-
cess and exaggeration, which belonged
to her character, the most enthusiastic
devotion to that captivating and delusive
worship. It was perhaps to shew him
the necessity of stricter doctrines, and
observances, that heaven permitted one so
good and noble, as he was, to be united
with one so frail and weak. Those doc.
trines which he loved to discuss, an

support in speculation, she eagerly seized
upon, and carried into practice ; thus
proving to him clearly, and fatally, their
dangerous and pernicious tendency.
Eager to oppose and conquer those opi-
nions in his wife, which savoured as he
thought of bigotry and rigour, he tore the
veil at once from her eyes, and opened
hastily her wondering mind to a world
before unknown. He foresaw not the
peril to which he exposed her :-he
heeded not the rapid progress of her
thoughcon-the boundless views of an
over heated imagination. At first she
shrunk with pain and borror, from every
feeling which to her mind appeared less
rigid, less pure, than those to which
she had long been accustomed ; but
when her prineiples, or rather her preju-
dices, yielded to the power of love, she
broke from a restraint too severe, into a
liberty the most dangerous from its no-
velty, its wildness and its uncertainty.
The monastic severity which she had

imposed upon herself, from exaggerated
sentiments of piety and devotion, gave
way with the rest of her former maxims
She knew not where to pause, or rest;
her eyes were dazzled, her understanding
bewildered ; and she viewed the world,
and the new form which it wore before
her, with strange and unknown feelings,
which she could neither define, nor com-
mand.
Before this period, her eyes had never
even glanced upon the numerous pages
which have unfortunately been traced by
the hand of unrestrained enquiry, and
daring speculation ; even the more inno-
cent fictions of romance had been with-
held from her ; and her mother's precepts
had, in this respect, been attended to by
her with sacred care.
Books of every
description, the works of Historians,
Philosophers, and Metaphysicians, were
now eagerly devoured by her ; horror and
astonishment at first retarded the course
of curiosity and interest :- and soon the

surprise of innocence was converted into
admiration of the wit and beauty with
which some of these works abounded.
Care is taken when the blind are cured,
that the strong light of day should not
fall too suddenly upon the eye; but of
what avail was caution to Calantha-
ever in extremes, she threw off at once
the shackles, the superstition, the res
strictions, which, perhaps, overstrained
notions of purity and piety had im-
posed.
Calantha's lover had become her mas.
ter; and he could not tear himself one
moment from his pupil. He laughed at
every artless or shrewd remark, and
pleased himself with contemplating the
first workings of a mind, not unapt in
learning, though till then exclusively
wrapt up in the mysteries of religion,
the feats of heroes, the poetry of classic
bards, and the history of nations the most
ancient and the most removed." Where
have you existed, my Calantha ?" he

continually said:-" who have been your
companions ?" "I had none," she re-
plied ; "but wherever I heard of cruelty,
vice, or irreligion, I turned away.
"Ah, do so still, my best beloved," said
Lord Avondale, with a sigh. " Be ever
as chaste, as frank, as innocent, as now.
" I cannot," said Calantha, confused
and grieved. "I thought it the greatest
of all crimes to love :-no ceremony of
marriage-no doctrines men have invent-
ed, can quiet my conscience :- I know
no longer what to believe, or what to
doubt :-hide me in your bosom :- let
us live far from a world which you say
is full of evil:--and never part from my
side ; for you are-Henry you are, all
that is left me now.
I look no more for
the protection of Heaven, or the guidance
of parents ;-you are my only hope:-
do you preserve and bless me ; for I have
left every thing for you."
Such is the transient nature of en.
thusiasm ; such the instability of over

141
zeal; and so short the adherence to
the firmest, and most austere deter-
minations, which are not founded in
right principle, and accompanied by
a tranquil and humble spirit. To a
mind so ardent, and so irregular as Ca-
lantha's, knowledge and information are
full of danger and hazard. It is impos.
sible to foresee the impressions which
may be made, or in any degree to regu-
late the course which may be taken by
such an imagination. Some mistaken
conclusion is eagerly seized upon, some
false interpretation is easily seized upon,
and tenaciously maintained, and reason
labours in vain to counteract and remedy
the mischief. The productions of such
a soil are all strange, new, uncertain ;
and the cultivator sees with astonish-
ment a plant arise, entirely different
from the usual result of the seed which
has been sown, mocking his toil, and
frustrating his expectations.

CHAPTER XVIII.
THERE is nothing so difficult to describe
as happiness. Whether some feeling of
envy enters into the mind upon hearing
of it, or whether it is so calm, so unas-
suming, so little ostentatious in itself,
that words give an imperfect idea of it,
who can say ? It is easier to enjoy it
than to define it. It springs in the heart,
and shews itself on the countenance;
but it shuns all display; and is oftener
found at home, when home has not been
embittered by dissensions, suspicions,
and guilt, than any where else upon
earth. Yes, it is in home, and in those
who watch there for us. Miserable is
the being who turns elsewhere for conso-
lation! Desolate is the heart which has
broken the ties that bound it there.
Calantha was happy; her home was

GLENARVON.
143
blessed ; and in Lord Avondale's society
every hour brought her joy. Perhaps
the feelings which at this time united
them were too violent-too tumultuous.
Few can bear to be thus loved-thus
indulged: very few minds are strong
enough to resist it. Calantha was ut.
terly enervated by it; and when the cares
of life first aroused Lord Avondale, and
called biin from her, she found herself
unfit for the new situation she was
immediatey required to fill. When
for a few hours he left her, she waited
with trembling anxiety for his return;
and though she murmured not at the
necessary change, her days were spent
in tears, and her nights in restless agita-
tion He more than shared in her dis-
tress: he even encouraged the excess of
sensibility which gave rise to it; for men,
whilst they love, think every new caprice
and weakness in the object of it but a new
charm; and whilst Calantha could make
him grave or merry-or angry or pleased,
## p. 144 (#166) ############################################
144

just as it suited her, he pardoned every
omission-he forgave every fault.
Used to be indulged and obeyed, she
was not surprised to find him a willing
slave; but she had no conception that
the chains he now permitted to be laid
upon him, were ever to be broken ; and
tears and smiles, she thought, must, at all
times, have the power over his heart which
they now possessed. She was not mis-
taken :-Lord Avondale was of too fine
a character to trifle with the affections
he had won ; and Calantha had too much
sense and spirit to wrong him.
He
looked to his home therefore for comfort
and enjoyment. He folded to his bosom
the only being upon earth, for whom he
felt one sentiment of passion or of love.
Calantha had not a thought that he did
not know, and share : his heart was as
entirely open as her own.
Was it possible to be more happy? It
was: and that blessing too, was granted.
Lady Avondale became a mother :- She

gave to Avondale, the dearest gift a wife
can offera boy, lovely in all the grace
of childhood whose rosy smiles, and
whose infant caresses, seemed even more
than ever to unite them together. He
was dear to both; but they were far
dearer to each other. At Allanwater,
in the fine evenings of summer, they
wandered out upon the mountains, and
saw not in the countenance of the vil.
lagers half the tenderness and happiness
they felt themselves. They uttered, there-
fore, no exclamations upon the superior
joy of honest industry :-a cottage of-
fered nothing to their view, which could
excite either envy or regret: they gave
to all, and were loved by all; but in all
respects they felt themselves as innocent,
and more happy than those who sur-
rounded them.
In truth, the greater refinement, the
greater polish the mind and manner
receive, the more exquisite must be the
enjoyment of which the heart is capable.

Few know how to love it is a word
which many misuse; but they who have
felt it, know that there is nothing to
compare with it upon earth. It cannot
however exist in union with guilt. If
ever it does spring up in a perverted
heart, it constitutes the misery that heart
deserves :it consumes and tortures till
it expires. Even, however, when lawful
and virtuous, it may be too violent:-it
may render those who are subject to it
negligent of other duties, and careless of
other affections: this in some measure
was the case of Lord and Lady Avondale.
From Allanwater, Lord and Lady Avon-
dale proceeded to Monteith, an estate of
Lord Avondale's, where his aunt, Lady
Mowbrey, and his only sister, Lady Eli.
zabeth Mowbrey resided. Sir Richardand
Lady Mowbrey had never had any chil-
dren, but Elizabeth and Lord Avondale
were as dear to them, and perhaps dearer,
than if they had been their own.
The
society at Monteith was large. There
pleasure and gaiety and talent were

GLENARVON.
147
chiefly prized and sought after, while a
strong party spirit prevailed. Lady Mon-
teith, a woman of an acute and penetrat-
ing mind, had warmly espoused the cause
of the ministry of the day. Possessed of
every quality that could most delight in
society-brilliant, beautiful, and of a
truly masculine understanding, she was
accurate in judgment, and at a glance
could penetrate the secrets of others; yet
was she easily herself deceived. She had
a nobleness of mind, which the inter-
course with the world, and exposure to
every temptation had not been able to
destroy. Bigotted and prejudiced in
opinions which early habit had conse-
crated, she was sometimes too severe in
her censures of others; but her heart,
too warm, too kind, repented even any mo-
mentary severity she might have shewn.
At Castle Delaval, the society was even
too refined ; and a slight tinge of affec-
tation might, by those who were inclined
to censure, be imputed to it. Though
H 2

ease was not wanting, there was a polish
in manner, perhaps in thought, which
removed the general tone somewhat too
far from the simplicity of nature ; senti-
ment, and all the romance of virtue, was
encouraged.
At Monteith, on the contrary, this over
refinement was the constant topic of ri-
dicule. Every thought was there uttered,
and every feeling expressed:there was
neither shyness, nor reserve, nor affecta-
tion. Talent opposed itself to talent
with all the force of argument. The
loud laugh that pointed out any new
folly, or bailed any new occasion of mirth,
was different from the subdued smile,
and gentle hint to which Calantha had
been accustomed. Opinions were there
liberally discussed ; characters stripped
of their pretences; and satire mingled
with the good humour, and jovial mirth,
which on every side abounded.
Lady Avondale heard and saw every
thing with surprise ; and though she
loved and admired the individuals, she

GLENARVON.
149
felt herself unfit to live among them.
There was a liberality of opinion and a
satiric turn which she could not at once
comprehend ; and she said to herself,
daily, as she considered those around her,
They are different from me. I can
never assimilate myself to them. I was
every thing in my own family, and I am
nothing here." What talents she had
were of a sort they could not appreciate;
and all her defects were those which they
most despised. The refinement, the
romance, the sentiment she had imbibed,
appeared in their eyes assumed and un-
natural; her strict opinions, perfectly
ridiculous; her enthusiasm, absolute in-
sanity; and the violence of her temper,
if contradicted or opposed, the pettish-
ness of a spoiled and wayward child.
Yet too indulgent, too kind to reject her,
they loved her, they caressed her, they
bore with her petulance and mistakes.
It was, however, as a child they consi-
dered her :--they treated her as one not
arrived at maturity of judgment.
## p. 150 (#172) ############################################
150
GLENARVON.
Her reason by degrees became con-
vinced by the arguments which she con-
tinually heard ; and all that was spoken
at random, she treasured up as truth:
even whilst vehemently contending and
disputing in defence of her favourite
tenets, she became of another opinion.
So dangerous is a little knowledge-so
unstable is violence. Her soul's immor-
tal hopes seemed to be shaken by the
unguarded jests of some who casually
visited at Monteith, or whom she met
with elsewhere she read till she con-
founded truth and falsehood, nor knew
any longer what to believe: she heard
folly censured, till she took it to be cri-
minal ; but crime she saw tolerated, if
well concealed. The names she had set
n her very heart as pure and spotless,
she heard traduced and ridiculed: indig-
nantly she defended them with all the
warmth of ardent youth :-they were
proved guilty; she wept in agony, she
loved them not less, but she thought

151
less favourably of those who had unde-
ceived her.
The change in Calantha's mind was
constant, was daily ; it never ceased, it
never paused; and none marked its pro-
gress, or checked her career.
In eman-
cipating herself from much that was no
doubt useless, she stripped herself by
degrees of all, till she neither feared, nor
cared, nor knew any longer what was,
from what was not.
Nothing gives greater umbrage than a
misconception and mistaken application
of tenets and opinions which were never
meant to be thus understood and acted
upon. Lady Mowbrey, a strict adherent
to all customs and etiquettes, saw with
astonishment in Calantha a total disre-
gard of them ; and her high temper
could ill brook such defect. Accus-
tomed to the gentleness of Elizabeth,
she saw with indignation the liberty her
niece had assumed. It was not for her
to check her ; but rigidity, vehemence in

dispute, and harsh truths, at times too
bitterly expressed on both sides, gave an
appearance of disunion between them,
which happily was very far from being
real, as Calantha loved and admired
,
Lady Mowbrey with the warmest affec-
tion.
Lord Avondale, in the mean time,
solely devoted to his wife, blinded him-
self to her danger. He saw not the
change a few months had made, or he
imputed it alone to her enthusiasm for
himself. He thought others harsh to
what he regarded as the mere thought-
lessness of youth; and, surrendering him-
self wholly to her guidance, he chided,
caressed, and laughed, with her in turn.
" I see how it is, Henry," said Sir
Richard, before he left Ireland, - you
are a lost man; I shall leave you another
year to amuse yourself ; and I fancy by
that time all this nonsense will be over.

CHAPTER XIX.
The threatening storm of rebellion now
darkened around. Acts of daily rapine
and outrage alarmed the inhabitants of
Ireland, both in the capital and in the
country : all the military posts were
reinforced ; Lord Avondale's regiment,
then at Leitrim, was ordered out on
actual service, and the business of his
profession employed every moment of his
time. The vigorous measures pursued,
soon produced a favorable change; tran-
quillity was apparently restored; and the
face of things resumed its former appear-
ance; but the minds which had been
aroused to action were not as easily qui.
eted, and the charms of an active life
were not as readily laid aside. Lord
Avondale was still much abroad ; much
occupied ; and the time hanging heavy

upon Calantha's hands, she was not
sorry to hear that they were going to
pass the ensuing winter in London.
In the autumn, previous to their depar-
ture for England, they passed a few weeks
at Castle Delaval, chiefly for the purpose
of meeting Lady Margaret Buchanan, who
had, till then, studiously avoided every
occasion of meeting Lady Avondale.
Buchanan had neither seen her nor sent
her one soothing message since her mar-
riage, so angry he affected to be, at what,
in reality, gave him the sincerest delight.
Count Gondimar had returned from
Italy, and was now at the castle. He
had brought letters from Viviani to Lady
Margaret, who said at once when she had
read them : " You wish to deceive ine.
These letters are dated from Naples, but
our young friend is here-here even in
Ireland." " And his vengeance," said
Gondimar, laughing. Lady Margaret
affected, also, to smile: "Oh, his ven-
geance !" she said, " is yet to come:

save me from his love now ; and I will
defend myself from the rest."
Lord and Lady Dartford were, like-
wise, at the castle. He appeared cold
and careless. In his pretty inoffensive
wife, he found not those attractions,
those splendid talents which had en-
thralled him for so long a period with
Lady Margaret. He still pined for the
tyranny of caprice, provided the load of re-
sponsibility and exertion were removed :
and the price of his slavery were that ex-
emption from the petty cares of life, for
which he felt an insurmountable disgust.
From indolence, it seemed he had fallen
again into the snare which was spread
for his ruin ; and having, a second time,
submitted to the chain, he had lost all
desire of ever again attempting to shake
it off. Lady Dartford, too innocent to see
her danger, lamented the coldness of her
husband, and loved him with even fond.
er attachment, for the doubt she enter-
tained of his affection. She was spoken

157
of by all with pity and praise: her con-
duct was considered as exemplary, when
in fact it was purely the effect of nature;
for every hope of her heart was centered
in one object, and the fervent constancy
of her affection arose, perhaps, in some
measure from the uncertainty of its being
returned. Lady Margaret continued to
see the young Count Viviani in secret :-
he had now been in Ireland for some
months :-bis manner to Lady Margaret
was, however, totally changed :-he
had accosted her upon his arrival, with
the most distant civility, the most studied
coldness :-he affected ever that marked
indifference which proved him but still
too much in her power ; and, while his
heart burned with the scorching flames
of jealousy, he waited for some oppor-
tunity of vengeance, which might, by
its magnitude, effectually satisfy his
rage.
Lord Dartford saw him once as he was
retiring in haste from Lady Margaret's
apartment; and he enquired of her ea-

gerly who he was." A young musi-
cian, a friend of Gondimar's, an Italian,"
said Lady Margaret.
He has not an
Italian countenance," said Lord Dart-
ford, thoughtfully. "I wish I had not
seen him :-it is a face which makes a
deep and even an unpleasant impression,
You call him Viviani, do you?whilst
I live, I never shall forget Viviani !"
Cards, billiards and music, were the
usual nightly occupations. Sir Everard
St. Clare and the Count Gondimar en.
tered into the most tedious and vehe-
ment political disputes, an evil which
Calantha endeavoured to avert as often
as she could, by inducing the latter to
sing, which he did in an agreeable,
though not in an unaffected manner.
At these times, Mrs. Seymour, with So-
phia and Frances, heeding neither the
noise nor the gaiety, eternally embroi-
dered fancy muslins, or, with persevering
industry, painted upon velvet. Calan-
tha mocked at these innocent recreations.

- Unlike music, drawing and reading,
which fill the mind," she said ;-" un-
like even to dancing which, though ac-
counted an absurd mode of passing away
time, is active, and appears natural to the
human form and constitution."
" Tell me Avondale," Calantha would
say, " can anything be more tedious
than that incessant irritation of the fin-
gersthat plebeian, thrifty and useless
mode of increasing in women a love of
dress-a selfish desire of adorning their
own persons ?-I ever loathed it:- There
is a sort of self-satisfaction about these
ingenious working ladies, which is per-
fectly disgusting. It gratifies all the
little errors of a narrow mind, under the
appearance of a notable and domestic
turn. At times, when every feeling of
the heart should have been called forth,
I have seen Sophia examining the pat-
terns of a new gown, and curiously
noting every fold of a stranger's dress.

Calantha, it is their

nantly: " when real virtue, struggling
with temptations of which these sense-
less, passionless creatures have no con-
ception, clinging for support to Heaven,
yet preserves itself uncorrupted amidst
the vicious and the base, it deserves a
crown of glory, and the praise and admi-
ration of every heart. Not so these
spiritless immaculate prejudiced stick-
lers for propriety. I do not love Sophia :
no, though she ever affords me a cold
extenuation for my faults - though
through life she considers me as a sort of
friend whom fate has imposed upon her
through the ties of consanguinity. I did

there are some, far better than herself,
noble ardent characters, unsullied by a
taint of evil ; and I think, Avondale,
without flattery, you are in the list
whom I would die to save ; whom I
would bear every torture and ignominy,
to support and render happy."" Try
then my alantha," said Lord Avon-
dale, " to render them so; for, believe
me, there is no agony so great as to re-
member that we have caused one mo-
ment's pang to such as have been kind
and good to us." " You are right,"
said Calantha, looking upon him with
affection.
Oh! if there be a pang of heart too
terrible to endure and to imagine, it
would be the consideration that we have
returned unexampled kindness by in-
gratitude, and betrayed the generous
noble confidence that trusted every thing
to our honour and our love. Calantha
had not, however, this heavy charge to
answer for at the time in which she

spoke, and her thoughts were gay, and
all those around seemed to share in the
happiness she felt.
Lord Avondale one day reproved Ca-
lantha for her excessive love of music.-
- You have censured work," he said,
" and imputed to it every evil, the cold
and the passionless can fall into :-I now
retort your satire upon music." Some
may smile at this ; but had not Lord
Avondale's observation more weight than
at first it may appear. Lady, Avondale
often rode to Glenaa to hear Miss St.
Clare sing. Gondimar sung not like
her; and his love-breathing ditties went
not to the heart, like the hymns of the
lovely recluse.
But for the deep flushes
which now and then overspread St.
Clara's cheeks, and the fire which at
times animated her bright dark eye, some
might have fancied her a being of a purer
nature than our own-one incapable of
feeling any of the fierce passions that
disturb mankind; but her voice was

such as to shake every fibre of the heart,
and might soon have betrayed to an ex-
perienced observer the impassioned vio-
lence of her real character.
Sir Everard, who had one day accom-
panied Calantha to the convent, asked
his niece in a half serious, half jesting
manner, concerning her gift of prophecy.
" Have not all this praying and fasting,
cured you of it, my little Sybil ?" he
said."No," replied the girl ; "but
that which you are so proud of, makes
me sad :-it is this alone which keeps
me from the sports which delight my
companions :-it is this which makes me
weep when the sun shines bright in the
clear heavens, and the bosom of the sea
is calm."" Will you shew us a speci-
men of your art ?" said Sir Everard,
eagerly.--Miss St. Clare coloured, and
smiling archly at him, " The inspiration
is not on me now uncle," she said ;

returned from her visit more and more
enchanted with her singular acquaint-

CHAPTER XX.
As soon as Lord and Lady Avondale had
quitted Castle Delaval, they returned to
Allan water, previous to their departure
for England. Buchanan, as if to mark
his still continued resentment against
Calantha arrived at Castle Delaval, ac-
companied by some of his London ac-
quaintance, almost as soon as she had
quitted it. He soon distinguished him-
self in that circle by his bold libertine
manners, his daring opinions, and his
overbearing temper. He declared him-
self at utter enmity with all refinement,
and professed his distaste for what is
termed good society. It was not long,
however, before Lady Margaret observed
a strange and sudden alteration in her
son's manners and deportment:-he en-
tered into every amusement proposed ;

he became more than usually conde-
scending; and Alice Mac Allain, it was
supposed, was the sole cause of his re-
form.
Alice was credulous; and when she
was first told that she was fair as the
opening rose, and soft and balmy as the
summer breeze, she listened with delight
to the flattering strain, and looked in the
mirror to see if all she heard were true.
She beheld there a face, lovely as youth
and glowing health coald paint it, dimp-
ling with ever-varying smiles, while hair,
like threads of gold, curled in untaught
ringlets over eyes of the lightest blue ;
and when she heard that she was loved,
she could not bring herself to mistrust
those vows which her own bosom was
but too well prepared to receive. She
had, perhaps, been won by the first who
had attempted to gain her affections ;
but she fell into hands where falsehood
had twined itself around the very heart's
core: she learned to love in no common

167
school, and one by one every principle
and every thought was perverted; but it
was not Buchanan who had to answer
for her fall! She sunk into infamy, it is
true, and ruin irreparable; but she passed
through all the glowing course of passion
and romance ; nor awoke, till too late,
from the dream which had deluded her.
Her old father, Gerald Mac Allain,
had, with the Duke's permission, pro-
mised her hand in marriage to a young
man in the neighbourhood, much es-
teemed for his good character. Linden
had long considered himself as an ap-
proved suitor. When, therefore, he was
first informed of the change which had
occurred in her sentiments, and, more
than all, when he was told with every
aggravation of her misconduct and du-
plicity, he listened to the charge with in.
credulity, until the report of it was con-
firmed from her own lips, by an avowal,
that she thought herself no longer worthy
of accepting his generous offerthat

be plain, she loved another, and wished
never more to see him, or to hear the re-
proaches which she acknowledged were
her due. "I will offer you no reproaches,
said Linden, in the only interview he
had with her; "but remember, Miss
Mac Allain, when I am far away, that
if ever those, who, under the naine of
friends, have beguiled and misled you,
should prove false and fail
false and fail you-remem-
ber, that, whilst Linden lives, there is
one left who will gladly lay down his life
to defend and preserve you; and who,
- being forced to quit you, never will re-
proach you: no, Alice-never !
"Gerald," said Lady Margaret, on the
morning when Alice was sent in disgrace
from the castle, " I will have no private
communication between yourself and
your daughter. She will be placed at
present in a respectable family; and her
future conduct will decide in what man-
ner she will be disposed of hereafter."
The old man bent to the ground in silent

judgment against their parents.
let me not be sent from hence in dis-
grace," said the weeping girl ; " drive
me not to the commission of crime. I
am yet innocent. Pardon a first offence."
" Talk not of innocence," said Lady
Margaret, sternly : " those guilty looks
betray you.
Your nocturnal rambles,
your daily visits to the western cliff, your
altered manner-all have been obseryed
by me and Buchanan""Oh, say not, at
least, that he accuses me. Whatever my
crime, I am guiltless, at least, towards
him."-"Guiltless or not, you must quit
our family immediately; and to-morrow,
at an early hour, see that you are pre-
pared."
It was to Sir Everard's house that Alice
was conveyed. There were many rea-
sons which rendered this abode more
convenient to Lady Margaret than any
other. The Doctor was timid and sub-
servient, and 'Count Gondimar was al-

daughter's, so that the whole family were,
in some measure, in Lady Margaret's
power. Her ladyship accordingly in.
sisted upon conveying Alice, herself, to
Lady St. Clare's house; and having safely
lodged her in her new apartment, re-
turned to the castle, in haste, and appeared
at dinner, pleased with her morning's
adventure;-her beauty more radiant from
Success.
It is said that nothing gives a brighter
glow to the complexion, or makes the
eyes of a beautiful woman sparkle so in-
tensely, as triumph over another. Is this,
however, the case with respect to women
alone ? Buchanan's florid cheek was
dimpled with smiles ; no sleepless night
had dimmed the lustre of his eye; he
talked incessantly, and with unusual af-
fability addressed himself to all, except
to his mother ; while a look of gratified
vanity was observable whenever the ab-
sence of Alice was alluded to. He had

171
been pleased with being the cause of ruin-
to any woman; but his next dearest gra-
tification was the having it supposed that
he was so. He was much attacked upon
this occasion, and much laughing and
whispering was heard. The sufferings
of love are esteemed lightly till they are
felt: and there were, on this occasion,
few at the Duke's table, if any, who had
ever really known them.

Time, which passes swiftly and thought-
Jessly for the rich and the gay, treads
ever with leaden foot, for those who are
miserable and deserted. Bright pro-
spects carry the thoughts onward; but
for the mourning heart, it is the direct
reverse : it lives on the memory of the
past: traces ever the same dull round;
and loses itself in vain regret and useless
retrospections. No joyous morn now
rose to break the slumbers of the once
innocent and happy Alice: peace of
mind was gone, like the lover who had
first won her affections, only it seemed
to abandon her to shame and remorse.
At Sir Everard's, Alice was treated
with impertinent curiosity, tedious ad-
vice, and unwise severity. "I hate peo-
ple in the clouds," cried the Doctor, as

173
he led her to her new apartment. "Who
would walk in a stubble field with their
eyes gazing upon the stars? You would,
perhaps ; and then, let me say, nobody
would pity you, Miss, if you tumbled
into the mire.""But kind people would
help me up again, and the unkind alone
would mock at me, and pass on."
" There are so many misfortunes in this
life, Miss Mac Allain, which come unex-
pectedly upon us, that, for my life, I
have not a tear to spare for those who
bring them on themselves."
perhaps, Sir, they are, of all others, the
most unfortunate."-" Miss Alice, mark
me, I cannot enter into arguments, or
rather, shall not, for we do not always
think proper to do what we can. Con-
scious rectitude is certainly a valuable
feeling, and I am anxious to preserve it
now: therefore, as I have taken charge
of you, Miss, which is not what I ain
particularly fond of doing, I must exe-

out of spite: I have noticed them by the
hour: therefore, dry your eyes ; think
less of love, more of your duty; and re-
collect, that people who step out of their
sphere are apt 'to tumble downwards till
the end of their days, as nothing is so
disagreeable as presumption in a woman.
I hate presumption, do I not Lady St.
Clare? So no more heroics, young Miss,"
continued he, smiling triumphantly, and
shaking his head :  no more heroics, if
you value my opinion. I hate romance

St. Clare? and heaven be praised, since
the absence of my poor mad brother, we
have not a grain of it in our house. We

sense--a very valuable commodity let me
tell you, though your fine people hold it
in disrepute."
In this manner Miss Mac Allain's
mornings were spent, and her evenings
even more tediously; for the Doctor,
alarmed at the republican principles
which he observed fast spreading, was
constantly employed in writing pam-
phlets in favour of government, which he
read aloud to his family, when not at the
castle, before he committed them to the

patched to seek her, while the doctor,
without waiting to hear his wife's sur.
mises or his daughter's lamentations,
seized his hat and stick and walked in
haste to the castle.
His body erect, his cape still under his
arm, the brogue stronger than ever, from
inward agitation, he immediately ad-
dressed himself to the Duke and Lady
Margaret, and soon converted their smiles
into fear and anger, by informing ther
that Alice Mac Allain had eloped.
Orders were given, that every enquiry
should be made for the fugitive; and the
company at the castle being informed
one by one of the event, lost themselves
in conjectures upon it. Lady Margaret
had no doubt herself, that her son was
deeply implicated in the affair, and, in
consequence, every search was set on
foot, but, as it proved in the event, with-
out the least success. Mr. Buchanan
had left Castle Delaval the week before,
which confirmed the suspicions already
entertained on his account.

Lady Avondale was in London when
she was informed of this event. Her
grief for Alice's fate was very sincere,
and her anxiety for her even greater ;
but Lord Avondale participated in her
sorrow-he endeavoured to sooth her
agitation ; and how could he fail in his
attempt : even misery is lightened, if it
is shared ; and one look, one word, from
a heart which seems to comprehend our
suffering, alleviates the bitterness.
Though Lady Avondale had not seen
Buchanan since her marriage, and had
heard that he was offended with her, she
wrote to him immediately upon hearing
of Alice's fate, and urged him by every
tie she thought most sacred and dear-by
every impression most likely to awaken
his compassion, to restore the unfortu-
nate girl to her suffering father, or at
least to confide her to her care, that she
might if possible protect and save her
from further misfortune.
To her ex-
treme astonishment, she received an an-

swer to this letter, with a positive assur.
ance from him, that he had no concern
whatever in Miss Mac Allain's departure;
that he was as ignorant as herself whither
she could be gone ; and that it might be
recollected he had left Castle Delaval
some days previous to that event.
Lady Dartford, who had returned to
London, and sometimes corresponded
with Sophia, now corroborated Bucha-
nan's statement, and assured her that she
bad no reason to believe Buchanan con-
cerned in this dark affair, as she had seen
him several times and he utterly denied it.
Lady Dartford was, however, too inno-
cent and inexperienced to know how men
of the world can deceive; she was even
ignorant of her husband's conduct; and
though she liked not Lady Margaret, she
doubted not that she was her friend :
who indeed doubts till they learn by bit-
ter experience the weakness of confiding!

CHAPTER XXII.
The whole party at Castle Delaval now
proceeded to London for the winter,
where Lord and Lady Avondale were al-
ready established in the Duke's mansion
in ...... Square.
A slight cold and fever, added to the
anxiety and grief Lady Avondale had
felt for her unhappy friend, had confined
her entirely to her own apartment; and
since her arrival in town, Count Gondi-
mar was almost the only person who
had been hitherto admitted to her pre-
sence.
He and Viviani now lodged in the
same house; but the latter still concealed
himself, and never was admitted to Lady
Margaret's presence, except secretly, and
with caution. He often enquired after
Calantha; and one evening the following

mar,
" a wild and wayward girl.
Is
she less, do you suppose, an object of
attraction now in the more endearing
character of mother and of wife? So
gentle, so young she seems, so pure, and
yet so passionately attached to her hus-
band and infant boy, that I think even
you, Viviani, would feel convinced of
her integrity. She seems, indeed, one
born alone to love, and to be loved, if
love itself might exist in a creature whom
purity and every modest feeling seem
continually to surround."'
Viviani smiled in scorn. 6 Gondimar,
this Calantha, this fair and spotless flower
is a woman, and, as such, she must be
frail. Besides, I know that she is so in
a thousand instances, though as yet too
innocent to see her danger or to mistrust
our sex. You have often described to me
her excessive fondness for music. What

think you of it? She does not hear it as
the Miss Seymours hear it, you tell me.
She does not admire it, as one of the
lovers of harmony might. Oh no; she
feels it in her very soul-it awakens
every sensibility-it plays upon the
chords of her overheated imagination-
it fills her eyes with tears, and strengthens
and excites the passions which it appears
to soothe and to compose. There is no-
thing which the power of music cannot
effect, when it is thus heard. Your
Calantha feels it to a dangerous excess.
Let me see her, and I will sing to her till
the chaste veil of every modest feeling is
thrown aside. Oh, I would trust every
thing to the power of melody! Calantha
is fond of dancing, too, I hear; and
dancing is the order of the night. This
is well; and once, though she saw me
not, amidst the crowd, I marked her, as
she lightly bounded the gayest in the
circle, from the mere excess of the ani-
mal spirits of youth. Now Miss Sey-

long glance searching for admiration as
she passes by; but Calantha sees not,
thinks not, when she dances : her heart
beats with joyous pleasure-her counte-
nance irradiates and almost wild with
delight, she forgets every thing but the
moment she enjoys. Let Viviani but for
one night be her partner, and you shall
see how pure is this Calantha. She

CHAPTER XXIII.
1
To that heartless mass of affectation, to
that compound of every new and every
old absurdity, to that subservient, spirit-
less, world of fashion, Lady Avondale
was now for the first time introduced.
It burst at once upon her delighted view,
like a new paradise of unenjoyed sweets
-like a fairy kingdom peopled with
ideal inhabitants. Whilst she resided
at Monteith and Castle Delaval, she had
felt an eager desire to improve her mind;
study of every sort was her delight, for
he who instructed her was her lover-
her husband: one smile from him could
awaken every energy; one frown repress
every feeling of gaiety ; for every word he
uttered amused and pleased : she learned
with more aptness than a school-boy ;
and he who wondered at the quickness

of his pupil, forgot to ascribe her exer-
tions and success to the power which
alone occasioned them-a power which
conquers every difficulty and endures
every trial.
Arrived in that gay city, that fair mart
where pleasure and amusement gather
around their votaries, where incessant
hurry after novelty employs every energy,
and desire of gaiety fills every hour, every
feeling, and every thought, Calantha
hailed every new acquaintance, every
new amusement, and her mind, unpo-
lished and ignorant, opened with admi.
ration and wonder upon so new, so diver-
.
sified a scene. To the language of praise
and affection she had been used; to un-
limited indulgence and liberty, she was
accustomed ; but the soft breathing voice
of flattery sounded to her ear far sweeter
than any other more familiar strain ;
though often, in the midst of its blan-
dishments, she turned away to seek for
Lord Avondale's approbation.

Calantha was happy before; but now it
was like a dream of enchantment; and
her only regret was that her husband
seemed not to partake as much as she
could have wished in her delight. Yet
he knew the innocence of her heart, the
austerity with which she shrunk from the
bare thought of evil, and he had trusted
her even in the lion's den, so certain was
he of her virtue and attachment. Indeed,
Lord Avondale, though neither puffed
with vanity, nor overbearing with pride,
could not but be conscious, as he looked
around, that both in beauty of person,
in nobility of parentage, and more than
these, in the impassioned feelings of an
uncorrupted heart, and the rich gifts of
a mind enlightened by wisdom and study,
none were his superiors, and very few
his equals ; and if his Calantha could
have preferred the effeminate and frivo.

sincere and strong attachment, would

sigh of regret, or the smallest struggle to
retain her! - No:- he was convinced
that she would not; and, as in word
and deed he was faithful to her, he fear-
ed not to let her take the course which
others trod, or enjoy the smiles of for-
tune, while youth and happiness were in
her possession.
The steed that never has felt the curb,
as it flies lightly and wildly, proud of its
liberty among its native hills and valleys,
may toss its head and plunge as it snuffs
the air and rejoices in its existence, while
the tame and goaded hack trots along
the beaten road, starting from the lash
under which it trembles, and stumbling
and falling, if not constantly upheld. -
Now see the goal before her. Calantha
starts for the race. Nor curb, nor rein,
have ever fettered the pupil of nature-
the proud, the daring votress of liberty
and love. What though she quit the
common path, if honour and praise ac-
company her steps, and crown her with

success, shall he who owns her despise
her? or must he, can he, mistrust her?
He did not; and the high spirits of un-
curbed youth were in future her only
guide-the gayest therefore, where all
were gay - the kindest, for excess of
happiness renders every heart kind. In
a few months after Lady Avondale's ar-
rival in London, she was surrounded, as
it appeared, by friends who would have
sacrificed their lives and fortunes to give
her pleasure. Friends !-it was a name
she was in the habit of giving to the first
who happened to please her fancy. This
even was not required: the frowns of
the world were sufficient to endear the
objects of its censure to her affection ;
and they who had not a friend, and de-
served not to have one, were sure, with-
out other recommendation, to find one in
Calantha. All looked fresh, beautiful
and new to her eyes; every person she
met appeared kind, honourable, and sin-
cere; and every party brilliant ; for her

heart, blest in itself, reflected its own
sunshine around.
Mrs. Seymour, after her arrival in
town, was pleased to see Calantha so
happy. No gloomy fear obtruded itself;
she saw all things with the unclouded
eye of virtue; yet when she considered
how many faults, how many imprudences,
her thoughtless spirits might lead her to
commit, she trembled for her; and once,
when Calantha boasted of the extacy she
enjoyed"long may that innocent heart
feel thus," she said,
my only, my be-
loved niece; but whilst the little bark is
decked with flowers, and sails gaily in a
tranquil sea, steer it steadily, remember
ing that rough gales may come, and we
should ever be prepared." She spoke
with an air of melancholy: she had, per-
haps, herself, suffered from the goodness
and openness of her heart; but whatever
the faults and sorrows into which she had
fallen, no,purer mind ever existed than
her's--no heart ever felt more strongly.

The affectation of generosity is com-
mon; the reality is so rare, that its con-
stant and silent course passes along un-
perceived, whilst prodigality and osten-
tation bear away the praise of mankind.
Calantha was esteemed generous; yet
indifference for what others valued, and
thoughtless profusion were the only
qualities she possessed. It is true that
the sufferings of others melted a young
and ardent heart into the performance of
many actions which would never have

ted it; for it gave her pain to refuse, and
she knew not how to deprive herself of
any gratification. She lavished, there-
fore, all she had, regardless of every con-

sequence; but, happily for her, she was
placed in a situation which prevented
her from sutfering as severely for her
faults as probably she deserved.
Two friends now appeared to bless her
further, as she thought, by their affection
and confidence-Lady Mandeville and
Lady Augusta Selwyn. The former she
loved; the latter she admired. Lord
Avondale observed her intimacy with
Lady Mandeville with regret; and once,

though with much gentleness, reproved
her for it. Henry," she replied, " say
not one wordagainst my beautiful, though
perhaps unfortunate friend : spare Lady
Mandeville ; and I will give you up Lady
Augusta Selwyn; but remember the
former is unprotected and unhappy."
Mrs. Seymour was present when Lord
Avondale had thus ventured to hint his
disapprobation of Calantha's new ac-
quaintance. --" Say at once, that Calan-
tha shall not see any more of one whom
you disapprove :--her own character is

prepossessing qualities; but it is decorum
and a rational adherence to propriety
which alone can secure esteem. Tell
me not of misfortunes," continued Mrs.
Seymour, with increasing zeal in the
good cause, and turning from Lord Avon-
dale to Calantha, a woman who
breaks through the lesser rules which
custom and public opinion have esta-
blished, deserves to lose all claim to re-
spect; and they who shrink not at your
age from even the appearance of guilt,
because they dread being called severe
and prudish, too generally follow the
steps of the victims which their false
sentiments of pity have induced them to
support.

she, with more of warmth than it was
her custom to shew-" you will lament,
when it is too late, the ruin of this child.

her faults. She is on the road to perdi-

moment perhaps, in which to check her
course. You advise:-I command. My
girls at least shall not associate with
Lady Mandeville, whom no one visits.
Lady Avondale of course is her own
mistress.'
Piqued at Mrs. Seymour's manner,
Calantha appealed to her husband: "and

has none but me to defend her? Shall

ready tears trembled in Lady Avondale's
eyes." I will see no more of her, if it
gives you pain. I will never visit her

to grieve her.
A servant entered with a note, whilst
they were yet together:-a crimson blush
suffused Calantha's cheeks. "I see,'
said Lord Avondale smiling, as if fearful
of losing her confidence, "it is from your
new friend." It was so : she had sent
her carriage, with a request that Lady
Avondale would immediately call upon
her. She hesitated ; looked eagerly for a
permission, which was too soon granted;
and without making any excuse, for she
had not learned the art, she hastened
from the lowering eyes of the deeply of-
fended Mrs. Seymour.

CHAPTER XXIV.
Long as she had now been known to
Lady Mandeville, she had only once be-
fore seen her at her own house. She now
found her reclining upon a sofa in an
apartment more prettily than magnifi-
cently ornamented:a shawl was thrown
gracefully over her; and her hair, in
dark auburn ringlets, half concealed her
languishing blue eyes. Lady Mandeville
was at this time no longer in the very
prime of youth. Her air and manner
had not that high polish, which at first
sight seduces and wins. On the contrary,
it rather was the reverse, and a certain
pedantry took off much from the charm
of her conversation. Yet something
there was about her, which attracted.
She seemed sincere too, and had less of
that studied self-satisfied air, than most

women, who affect to be well informed.
"I am glad you are come, my beloved
friend," she said, extending her hand to
Calantha when she entered. "I have
just been translating an Ode of Pindar:
his poetry is sublime : it nerves the soul
and raises it above vulgar cares ;-but
you
do not understand Greek, do you?
Indeed to you it would be a superfluous
acquisition, married as you are, and to
such a man."-Lady Avondale, rather
puzzled as to the connection between
domestic happiness, and the Greek lan-
guage, listened for further explanation ;
--but with a deep sigh, her lovely ac-
quaintance talked of her fate, and re-
ferred to scenes and times long passed,
and utterly unknown to her. She talked
much too of injured innocence, of the
malignity of the world, of contempt
for her own sex, and of the superiority of
men.
Children as fair, and more innocent
than their mother, entered whilst she

was yet venting her complaints. A
husband she had not ;--but lovers.
What man was there who could see her,
and not, at all events wish himself of the
number! Yet she assured Lady Avon-
dale, who believed her, that she despised
them all; that moreover she was mise-
rable, but not vicious; that her very
openness and frankness ought to prove
that there was nothing to conceal. The
thought of guilt entered not at that time
into Calantha's heart; and when indeed
a women affirmed that she was innocent,
it excited in her no other surprise, than
that she should, for one moment, sup-
pose her so barbarous, and so malevolent
as to think her otherwise. Indeed there
seemed to her as great a gulph between
those she loved, and vice, as that which
separates the two extremes of wickedness
and virtue ; nor had she yet learned to
comprehend the language of hypocrisy
and deceit.
Though the presence of the children

198
GLENARVON,
had not made any difference, the entrance
of three gentlemen, whom Lady Man-
deville introduced to Lady Avondale, as
her lovers, gave a new turn to the con-
versation; and here it should be ex-
plained, that the term lover, when Lady
Mandeville used it, was intended to
convey no other idea than that of an
humble attendant -a bearer of shawls,
a writer of sonnets, and a caller of car-
riages. - With Lord Dallas you are
already acquainted," she said, sighing
gently. "I wish now to introduce Mr.
Clarendon to you, a poet: and Mr. Fre-
more, what are you ? speak for yourself;
for I hardly know in what manner to
describe you." "I am anything, and
everything that Lady Mandeville plea-
ses," said Mr. Fremore, bowing to the
ground, and smiling languidly upon her.
Mr. Fremore was one of the most un-
sightly lovers that ever aspired to bear
the name.
He was of a huge circumfe-
rence, and what is unusual in persons of

that make, he was a mass of rancour and
malevolence-gifted however with a wit
so keen and deadly, that with its razor
edge, he cut to the heart most of his
enemies, and all his friends. Lord Dal-
las, diminutive and conceited, had a
brilliant wit, spoke seldom, and studied
deeply every sentence which he uttered.
He affected to be absent ; but in fact
no one ever forgot himself so seldom.
His voice, untuned and harsh, repeated
with a forced emphasis certain jests and
bon mots which had been previously
made, and adapted for certain conversa-
tions. Mr. Clarendon alone seemed
gifted with every kind of merit: he had
an open ingenuous countenance, expres-
sive eyes, and a strong and powerful
mind.
The conversation alternately touched
upon the nature of love, the use and
beauty of the Greek language, the plea-
sures of maternal affection, and the insi-
pidity of all English society.

rather metaphorical at times :there was
generally in it a want of nature-an at-
tempt at display: but to Calantha it ap-
peared too singular, and too attractive to
wish it otherwise. She had been used,
however, to a manner rather more re-
finedmore highly polished than any
she found out of her own circle and fa-
mily. A thousand things shocked her
at first, which afterwards she not only
tolerated but adopted.
There was a
want of ease, too, in many societies, to
which she could not yet accustom her-
self; and she knew not exactly what it
was which chilled and depressed her when
in the presence of many who were, upon
a nearer acquaintance, amiable and agree-
able. Perhaps too anxious a desire to
please, too great a regard for trifles, a
sort of selfishness, which never loses
sight of its own identity, occasions this
coldness
among
these votaries of fashion.

dress, that refinement which they value

so much, prevents their obtaining it;
and a degree of vulgarity steals unper-
ceived amidst the higher classes in En-
gland, from the very apprehension they
feel of falling into it. Even those, who
are natural, do not entirely appear so.
Calantha's life was like a feverish
dream :-o crowded, so varied, so swift
in its transitions, that she had little time
to reflect; and when she did, the me-
mory of the past was so agreeable and so
brilliant, that it gave her pleasure to think
of it again and again. If Lord Avondale
was with her, every place appeared even
more than usually delightful; but, when
absent, her letters, no longer filled with
lamentations on her lonely situation,
breathed from a vain heart, the lightness
and satisfaction it enjoyed.
It
may be supposed that one so frivo.
lous and so thoughtless, committed every
possible fault and folly which opportu-
nity and time allowed. It may also be
supposed, that such imprudence met

with it's just reward ; and that every
tongue was busy in its censure, and every
gossip in exaggerating the extraordinary
feats of such a trifler. Yet Calantha,
upon the whole, was treated with only
too much kindness; and the world,
though sometimes called severe, seemed
willing to pause ere it would condemn,
and was intent alone to spare or to re-
claim a young offender.
When the World is spoken of in these
volumes, it means alone that frivolous
part of the community who dwell with
delight upon the busy scene before them,
and take interest in the momentary di-
versions which every little novelty and
every little event occasions.

How different from the animated dis-
cussion at Lady Mandeville's, was the
loud laugh and boisterous tone of Lady
Augusta Selwyn, whom Calantha found,
on her return, at that very moment step-
ping from her carriage, and enquiring for
her. "Ah, my dear sweet friend," she
cried, flying towards Calantha, and
shaking her painfully by the hand, " this
fortuitous concurrence of atoms, fills my
soul with rapture. But I was resolved
to see you. I have promised and vowed
three things in your name; therefore,

I am old enough to be such. In the first

CALANTHA now imagined, and was re-
peatedly assured, that her husband ne-
glected her: the thought gave her pain :
she contrasted his apparent coldness and
gravity with the kindness and flattery of
others. Even Count Gondimar was more
interested for her welfare, and latterly she
observed that he watched her with in-
creasing solicitude. At a masked ball,
in particular, the Italian Count followed
her till she was half offended. "
Why do
you thus persecute me as to the frivolity
and vanity of my manner? Why do you
seem so infinitely more solicitous con-
cerning me than my husband and my
relations ?" she said, suddenly turning,
and looking earnestly at him. 66 What

converse? How is it possible that you

tell me I am faultless and delightful ?"
"And do you believe that the gay troop
of flatterers who now follow you," said
a mask who was standing near the Count,
" do you believe that they feel any other
sentiment for you than indifference?"-
" Indifference !" repeated Calantha,
"what can you mean? I am secure of
their affection; and I have found more
friends in London since I first arrived
there, than I have made in the whole
previous course of my life."

same mask.
" Am I," she said, turning
eagerly round to her partner, Lord Trelaw-

" You are all that is amiable and ador-

said Lady Avondale, " tell this Italian

the night at the ball, but felt uneasy at
what she had said.
Monteagle House, at which the mas.
querade was given, was large and magni-
ficent. The folding doors opened into
fine apartments, each decorated with
flowers, and filled with masks. Her
young friends, Sophia and Lady Dart-
ford, in the first bloom and freshness of
youth, attracted much admiration. Their

not succeeding, wandered into them
alone, followed by some masks in the
disguise of gipsies, by whom she was
soon surrounded; and one of them whom
she recognized to be the same who had
spoken to her with Gondimar, under
the pretence of telling her fortune, said
to her every thing that was most severe.
" What, said he, turning to one of his
companions," do you think of the line
in this lady's hand ? It is a very strange
one: I augur no good from it." The
dress of the mask who spoke was that of
a friar, his voice was soft and mournful.

he addressed : "I read no worse fault.
Come, I will tell her fortune." Lady,
you were born under a favoured planet,"
" Aaron," interrupted the Friar, " you
are a flatterer, and it is my privilege to
speak without disguise. Give me the
hand, and I will sbew her destiny. After
pausing a moment, he fixed his dark eyes

The task to tell thy fate be mine,
To guard against its ills be thine ;
For heavy treads the foot of Care
On those who are so young and fair.
The star, that on thy birth shone bright,
Now casts a dim uncertain light:
A threatening sky obscures its rays.
And shadows o'er thy future days.
In fasbion's magic circle bound,
Thy steps shall tread her mazy round,
While pleasure, flattery, and art,
Shall captivate thy fickle heart,

Of folly and of fools the prey ;

seeing the pain these acrimonious lines
had given her, reproved the friar" No,

himself from his companions ; and now

The gipsey and friar then went off, with
the rest of their party; but Aaron remain-

in her face," that you cannot even

" I could not have forgotten it." He
bowed with a look of conceit, and Lady

tended to make. Smiling at her contu-
sion, he assured her he had a right to her

sible: the words he pronounced were
those inscribed on her bracelet. " And

chanan bowed again. " Yes," he said ;

infancy-the amusements and occupa-
tions of her childhood : and she looked
vainly in Buchanan's face for the smallest
traces of the boy she had known so well.
Delighted with her evening's adventure,
and solely occupied with her companion,
the masquerade, the heat and all other
annoyances were forgotten, till Lady
Dartford being fatigued, entreated her to
retire.
She had conversed, during the greater
part of the evening, with Lord Dartford.
The female gipsey to whose party he be-
longed, and who had attacked Lady
Avondale, was Lady Margaret Buchanan.
He had asked Lady Dartford many ques-
tions about himself, to all of which she
had answered with a reserve that had
pleased him, and with a praise so unaf-
fected, so heartfelt, and so little deserved,
that he could not but deeply feel his own
demerit. He did not make himself
known, but suffered Lady Margaret to
rally and torment his unoffending wife ;

asking her repeatedly, why so pretty, and
so young, Lord Dartford permitted her
to go to a masquerade without a protec-
tor. " It is," replied Lady Dartford in
nocently, so that he dislikes this sort of
amusement, and knows well, that those
who appear unprotected, are sure of find-
ing friends." At this speech Lady Mar-
garet laughed prodigiously; and turning to
her companion, who, much disguised, still
followed her, asked him if he had never
seen Lord Dartford at a masquerade, giv-
ing it as her opinion, that he was very
fond of this sort of amusement, and was
probably there at that very moment.
In the mean time, Calantha continued
to talk with Buchanan, and eagerly en-
quired of him who it was who, in the dress
of a friar, had with so much acrimony at-
tacked her. "I do not know the young
man," he answered : "my mother calls
him Viviani :-he is much with her; but
he ever wears a disguise, I think; for no
one sees him: and, except Gondimar, he

seems not to have another acquaintance
in England."
It has been said that the weak-minded
are alone attracted by the eye; and they
who say this best know what they mean.
To Calantha it appeared, that the eye
was given to her for no other purpose
than to admire all that was fair and beau.
tiful. Certain it is, she made that use
of hers; and whether the object of such
admiration was man, woman, or child,
horse or flower, if excellent in its kind,
she ever gave them the trifling homage
of her approbation. Her new - found
cousin was, therefore, hailed by her with
the most encouraging smile; and how
long she might have listened to the ac-
count he was giving her of his exploits,
is unknown, had not Frances approached
her in a hasty manner, and said, " Do
come away: the strangest thing possible
has happened to me: Lord Trelawney
has proposed to me, and I-I have ac-
cepted his offer."-"Accepted his offer!"

Calantha exclaimed, with a look of hor.
ror.-"Oh, pray keep my secret till we
get home," said Frances. "I dare not
tell Sophia ; but you must break it to
my mother."
Lord Trelawney was a silly florid young
man, who laughed very heartily and good
humouredly, without the least reason.
He wore the dress, and had been received
in that class of men, whom Lady Au-
gusta called the exquisites. He had
professed the most extravagant adoration
for Lady Avondale, so that she was quite ,
astonished at his having attached himself
so suddenly to Frances; but not being
of a jealous turn, she wished her joy most
cordially, and when she did the same by
him-"Could not belp what I've done,
he said, looking tenderly at her through
a spying-glass : "total dearth of soine-
thing else to say :-can never affection
her much :--but she's your cousin, you
know :"and then he laughed.

to keep this important secret from her
mother that night, as that good lady
had been long in bed, and to arouse her
rith such unexpected news at three
o'clock had been cruel and useless. The
next morning, long before Lady Avondale
had arisen, every one knew the secret ;
and very soon after, preparations for the
marriage were made. The young bride
received presents and congratulations :
her spirits were exuberant; and her lover,
perfect and delightful. Even Lady Avon-
dale beheld him with new eyes, and the
whole family, whenever he was men-
tioned, spoke of him as a remarkably
sensible young man, extremely well in-
formed, and possessed of every quality
best adapted to ensure the happiness of
domestic life.

CHAPTER XXVII.
From the night of the masquerade, Lady
Avondale dared hardly confess to herself,
how entirely she found her thoughts en-
grossed by Buchanan. She met him
again at a ball. He entreated her to let
him call on her the ensuing day :-he
said he had much to tell her :- his man-
ner was peculiar; and his eyes, though
not full of meaning in general, had a cer-
tain look of interest that gratified the
vainest of human hearts. "I shall be at
home till two," said Calantha. - I shall
be with you at twelve," he answered.
Late as the hour of rest might appear to
some, Calantha was up, and attired with
no ordinary care to receive him at the
time he had appointed. Yet no Bucha-
Oh! could the petty triflers
in vanity and vice, know the power they

gain, and the effect they produce by
these arts, they would contemn the fa-
cility of their own triumph. It is ridicu-
lous to acknowledge it, but this disap-
pointment increased Calantha's anxiety
to see him to the greatest possible degree:
she scarce could disguise the interest it
created.
Gondimar unfortunately called at the
moment when Calantha was most impa-
tient and irritable. " You expected an-
other," he said sarcastically; " but I care
not. I came not here in the hope of
pleasing Lady Avondale. I came to in-
form her" "I cannot attend now."-
" Read this letter," said Gondimar. Ca-
lantha looked carelessly upon it-it was
from himself: it contained an avowal of
attachment and of interest for her; in
proof of which he asked permission to
offer ber a gift, which he said he was com-
missioned to bring her from Italy. Lady
Avondale returned the letter coldly, and
with a little affectation of dignity, de-

clined the intended present. It is so easy
to behave well, when it is our pleasure
to do so as well as our duty. Gondimar,
however, gave her but little credit for
her conduct. - You like me not?" he
said. "Do you doubt my virtue ?" she
replied eagerly. Aye, Lady; or, at all
events, your power of preserving it."
Whilst Gondimar yet spoke, Buchanan
gallopped by the window, and stopped at
the door of the house. His hands were
decorated with rings, and a gold chain
and half-concealed picture hung around
his neck : his height, bis mustachios,
the hussar trappings of his horse, the
high colour in his cheek, and his dark
flowing locks, gave an air of savage wild-
ness to his countenance and figure, which
much delighted Calantha. He entered
with familiar ease ; talked much of him-
self, and more of some of his military
friends ; stared at Gondimar, and then
shook hands with him. After which, he
began a vehement explanation of his con-

duct respecting Alice; assuring Calantha
upon his honour-upon his soul, that he
had no hand in her elopement. He then
talked of Ireland ; described the dread-
ful, the exaggerated accounts of what had
occurred there ; and ended by assuring
Gondimar, that the young Glenarvon was
not dead, but was at this time at Belfont,
concealed there with no other view than
that of heading the rebels. The accounts
which the Duke of Altamonte had re-
ceived in part corroborated Buchanan's
statement.
Calantha listened, however, with more
interest to the accounts Buchanan now
gave: and, as he said he was but just
returned from Dublin, even Gondimar
thought the news which he brought wor-
thy of some attention. " Send that
damned Italian away," said Buchanan in
a loud whisper: "I have a million of
things to tell you. If you keep him here,
I shall go :-my remaining will be of no
use," Unaccustomed to curb herself in

the least wish, Calantha now whispered to
Gondimar, that she wished him to leave
her, as she had something very particular
to say to her cousin ; but he only smiled
contemptuously upon him, and sternly
asking her, since when this amazing in-
timacy had arisen ?-placed himself at
the piano-forte, and struck its chords
with accompaniments till the annoyance

Buchanan consoled himself by talking
of his dogs and horses; and having given
Calantha a list of the names of each, be-
gan enumerating to her the invitations
he had received for the ensuing week.
Fortunately, at this moment, a servant en-
tered with a note for Gondimar.  Does
the bearer wait ?" he exclaimed with
much agitation upon reading it; and im-
mediately left the room.
Upon returning home, Count Gondimar
perceived with surprise, in the place of
the person he had expected, one of the at-

tendants of thelate Countess of Glenarvon
a man whose countenance and person
he well remembered from its peculiarly
harsh and unpleasant expression.-" Is
my young Lord alive?" said the man in
a stern manner. Count Gondimar replied
in the negative." " Then, Sir, I must
trouble you with those affairs which most
nearly concern him." " Your name, I
think, is Macpherson?" said Count Gon-
dimar. " You lived with the Countess
of Glenarvon." The man bowed, and
giving a letter into the hands of the Count,
" I am come from Italy at this time," he
replied, " in search of my late master-
La Crusca and myself." "Is La Crusca
with you ?" said Gondimar, starting.
" The letter will inform you of every
particular," replied the man with some
gravity. "I shall stay with the child
for
your farther orders." Saying this, he
left the Count's apartment; and returned
into the anti-chamber, where a beautiful
little boy was waiting for him.
## p. 229 (#253) ############################################
GLEN ARVON.
229
On that very evening, after a long con-
versation with Macpherson, Count Gon-
dimar again sought Calantha at her fa-
ther's house, where, upon enquiring for
her, he was immediately admitted. After
some little hesitation, he told her that he
had brought her the present of which he
had made mention in his letter ; that if
she had the unkindness to refuse it, some
other perhaps would take charge of it:-
yet it was a gift which, however unworthy
he was to offer it, he thought would be
dearer in her estimation than the finest
jewels, and the most costly apparel :-it
was a fair young boy, he said, fitted to
be a lady's page, and trained in every
cunning art his tender years could learn.
- He will be a play-mate," he said, smil-
ing, for your son, and when, " added he
in a lower voice, " the little Mowbrey
can speak, he will learn to lisp in that
language which alone expresses all that
the heart would utter-all that in a barba.
rous dialect it dares not-must not say."
## p. 230 (#254) ############################################

GLENARVON.
As he yet spoke, he took the hat from
off Zerbellini's head, and gently pushing
him towards Calantha, asked him to sue
for her protection. The child immediately
approached, hiding himself with singu-
lar fear from the caresses of the Count.
" Zerbellini," said Gondimar in Italian,
" will you love that lady?" "In my
heart," replied the boy, shrinking back
to Calantha, as if to a late found, but only
friend. Sophia was called, and joined in
the general interest and admiration the
child excited. Frances shewed him to
Lord Trelawney, who laughed exces-
sively at beholding him. Lady Margaret,
who was present, looking upon him sted-
fastly, shrunk as if she had seen a serpent
in her way, and then recovering herself,
held her hand out towards him. Zerbel-
lini fixed his eyes on Calantha, as if
watching in her countenance for the only
commands which he was to obey; and
when she drew him towards her aunt,
he knelt to her, and kissed her hand
+

GLENARVON.
231
with the customary grace and courtesy
of an Italian.
From that day, Calantha thought of
nothing but Zerbellini. He was a new
object of interest :- to dress him, to
amuse him, to shew him about, was her
great delight. Wherever she went he
must accompany her: in whatever she
did or said, Zerbellini must bear a part.
The Duke of Myrtlegrove advised her
to make him her page ; and for this pur-
pose he ordered him the dress of an
Eastern slave. Buchanan gave him a
chain with a large turquoise heart ; and
as he placed it around the boy, he glanced
his eye on Calantha. Presents, how-
ever, even more magnificent, were in re-
turn immediately dispatched by her to
the Duke and to Buchanan.
Count Gondimar read the letters Ca.
lantha had written with the gifts ; for she
had left them, as was her custom, open
upon the table. All she wrote, or re-
ceived, were thus left; not from osten-

tation, but indifference or vanity.--
" Are you mad," said the Italian, " or
worse than mad?" "I affect it not,"
replied Lady Avondale.
" I conclude,
therefore, that it is real." Indeed, there
was a strange compound in Calantha's
mind. She felt but little accountable
for her actions; and she often had ob.
served, that if ever she had had the mis.
fortune to reflect, and consequently to
resolve against any particular mode of
conduct, the result was, that she ever
fell into the error she had determined to
avoid. She might, indeed, have said,
that the spirit was willing, but the flesh
was weak; for whatever she resolved,
on the slightest temptation to the con-
trary, she failed to execute.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
" I AM astonished, my dear Gondimar,"
said Viviani one day, addressing him,
" at the description which you gave me
of Lady Avondale. I have seen her
since we conversed about her, more than
once; and there is not, I think, much
trace left of that excessive timidity of
manner-that monastic rigidity in her
opinions and conduct, of which you made
mention in one of your letters from
Castle Delaval.' " I was wrong, utterly
wrong," said Gondimar, " and you may
now rank this model of purity, this para-
gon of wives, this pupil of nature, whom
I have so often praised to you, on a level
with the rest of her fellow mortals.
6 Not on a level-not on a level," re-
plied Viviani with gravity ;" but falling
far beneath it."

to
The Count then repeated, in a solemn
tone, the description of Rome, which
Lucian has placed in the mouth of Ni-
grinus, applying the enumeration of vices,
temptations, and corruptions, attributed
to the fairest capital of the world,
London; and then asked of Gondimar,
if it were possible for one like Calantha,
to sojourn long amidst such scenes, with-
out in some measure acquiring the man-
ners, if not falling into the errors to
which the eyes and ears were every hour
accustomed? He spoke of her with regret,
as he thus pronounced her on the verge
of ruin :-"a prey," he said indig.
nantly, " for the spoiler--the weak and
willing victim of vanity." " The courts
of her father are overrun with petitioners
and mendicants," said Gondimr: " her
apartments are filled with flatterers, who
feed upon her credulity : she is in love
with ruin : it stalks about in every pos-
sible shape, and in every shape she hails

it:-woos it, alas ! the willing victim of
prosperity, luxury, and self-indulgence."
" And Avondale," said Viviani," Lord
Avondale," replied the Count, " knows
not, thinks not, comprehends not her
danger or his own. But the hour of per-
dition approaches; the first years of peace
and love are past; folly succeeds; and
vice is the after game. These are the
three stages in woman's life. Calantha
is swiftly passing through the second :-
the third will succeed. The days and
months once glided away in a dream of
joy, dangerous and illusive-in a dream,
I repeat; for all that depends on the ex-
cess and durability of any violent passion
must be called a dream. Such passion,
even though sanctioned by the most sa-
cred ties, if it engrosses every thought, is
not innocent-cannot be lawful. It plants
the seeds of corruption, which flourish
and gain strength hereafter. This is the
climate in which they will soonest ripen:

--this is the garden and soil where
they take the most rapid, and the deepest
root. And think you that Calantha and
Avondale are already weary of each
other? that the warm and vivid imagina-
tion of youthful love is satiated with ex-
cess? or that disappointment has follow-
ed upon a nearer view?" " All passion,"
replied Gondimar, falling back, and im-
pressively raising his hand"all passion
is founded on..
" Friend,"
said Viviani, "thy prate is unmercifully
tedious." "I half believe that thou art
thyself in love with this Calantha; but
for an explanation and detail of that
master passion, I know not why I ap-
plied to you-Calantha is the object of
your pursuit, not mine.". "Of my pur-
suit! in truth I believe you feel more
interest in her conduct than I do; I am
old and weary of these follies ; life is
just opening upon you; Calantha is your
idol." No," replied Viviani, with a
smile of scorn, "it is not that party.co.

" Yet Lady Margaret, you say, is un-

interrupted Viviani, while bitter smiles
quivered upon his lip.  Do

the flames, now hard and insensible ? -

for my destruction. The time is not yet
arrived, but I will dash the cup of joy
from her lips ; then drink the dregs my-
self, and die." " Mere jealous threats,'
said Gondimar.  The curse of innocent
blood is on her," replied Viviani, as his
livid cheeks and lips resumed a purple
dye. "Name her no more." " Explain
yourself," cried his astonished friend.
" You frequently allude to scenes of
deeper guilt and horror, than I dare even
suffer myself to imagine possible." "The
heart of man is unfathomable," replied
Viviani ; that which seems, is not:-
that which is, seems not: we should
neither trust our eyes nor ears in a world
like this. But time, which ripens all
things, shall disclose the secrets even of
the dead."
A short time after this conversation
with Gondimar, Viviani took leave of
him. He informed him fully of his pro-

she said, smiling upon him, in their last
parting interview. He laughed at the
remembrance of his words. " Am I the
object now of your abhorrence ?" she
said, placing her white hand carelessly
" Not absolutely," re-
plied the young Count, shrinking, how-
ever, from the pressure of that hand.
" Touch me not," he whispered more
earnestly," it thrills through my soul.-
Keep those endearments for Dartford :
leave ine in peace." Immediately after
this he left London ; and by the first
letter Lady Margaret received from him,
she found that he was preparing to em-
bark.

CHAPTER XXIX.
FRANCES Seymour's marriage with
Lord Trelawney was now celebrated, after
which the whole family left London for
Ireland.
Sophia, previous to her departure, re-
proved Calantha for her obstinacy, as she
called it, in remaining in town. "I
leave you with pain," she said: " forgive
me if I say it, for I see you have no con-
ception of the folly of your conduct.
Ever in extremes, you have acted as I
little expected from the wife of Lord
Avondale; but I blame him equally for
giving you such unbounded freedom :-
only the very wise and the very good
know how to use it." Sophia," re-
plied Calantha, "I wish not for re-
proaches:-have confidence in me:-we
cannot all be exactly alike. You are a

pattern of propriety and virtue, and verily
you have your reward : I act otherwise, ,
and am prepared for censures :-even
yours cannot offend me. Lord Avondale
talks of soon returning to Ireland : I
shall then leave this dear delightful
London without regret ; and you shall
find me when we all meet for the spring
at Castle Delaval, just the same, as when
I quitted it. Never the same, thought
Sophia, who marked, with astonishment,
the change a few months had made.
They were yet speaking, and taking a
cold farewell of each other, when a thun-
dering rap at the door interrupted them,
and before Sophia could retreat, Mr.
Fremore, Count Gondimar and Lady
Mandeville were ushered in. A frozen
courtesy, and an austere frown, were the
only signs of animation Sophia gave, as
she vanished from their view.
" You have been ill," said Lady Man-
deville, accosting Calantha.

however, that I am come to intrude upon
your time : I only called as I passed your
door, to enquire after you.
Mr. Fre-
more tells me you are about to visit the
Princess of Madagascar. Is this true?
for I never believe any thing I hear?
- For once," said Calantha, " you may
do so; and on this very evening, my in-
troduction is to take place." "It is
with regret I hear it," said Lady Man-
deville with a sigh : " we shall never
more see any thing of you. Besides, she
is not my friend." Calantha assured
-Lady Mandeville her attachment could
endure all sorts of trials ; and laughingly
enquired of her respecting her lovers,
Apollonius, and the Greek Lexicon she
was employed in translating. Lady Man-
deville answered her with some indiffe-
rence on these subjects; and having said
all that she could in order to dissuade her
against visiting the Princess, took her
leave.
That evening, at the hour of ten, Lord

Avondale and Mr. Fremore being in rea-
diness, Calantha drove according to ap-
pointment to visit the wife of the great
Nabob, the Princess of Madagascar.
Now who is so ignorant as not to know
that this Lady resides in an old-fashioned
gothic building, called Barbary House,
three miles beyond the turnpike ? and
who is so iguorant as not to be aware
that her highness would not have fa-
voured Lady Avondale with an audience,
had she been otherwise than extremely
well with the world, as the phrase isfor
she was no patroness of the fallen ! the
caresses and petits mots obligeantes
which dropt from her during this her
first interview, raised Lady Avondale in
her own opinion ; but that was unneces-
sary.
What
was more to the
purpose,
it
won her entirely towards the Princess.
Calantha now, for the first time, con-,
versed with the learned of the land:
she heard new opinions started, and old
ones refuted-and she gazed unburt, but

not unawed, upon reviewers, poets,
critics, and politicians. At the end of a
long gallery, two thick wax tapers ren-
dering " darkness visible," the princess
was seated. Few events, if any, were
ever known to move her from her posi-
tion. Her pages-her foreign attire, but
genuine English manners, voice and com-
plexion, attracted universal admiration.
She was beautiful too, and had a smile it
was difficult to learn to hate or to mis-
trust. She spoke of her own country
with contempt; and, even in her dress,
which was magnificent, attempted to
prove the superiority of every other over
it. Her morals were simple and uncor-
rupt, and in matters of religious faith she
entirely surrendered herself to the gui-
dance of Hoiaouskim. She inclined her
head a little upon seeing Lady Avondale,
and Hoiaouskim, her high priest, cast his
eyes, with unassuming civility, upon
Calantha, thus welcoming her to Bar-
bary House,

246
The princess then spoke a little sen-
tence-just enough to shew how much
she intended to protect Lady Avondale.
She addressed herself, besides, in many
dialects, tu an outlandish set of menials ;
appointing every one in the room some
trifling task, which was performed in a
moment by young and old, with sur-
prising alacrity. Such is the force of fa-
shion and power, when skilfully applied.
After this, she called Calantha : a slight
exordium followed-then a wily pointed
catechism ; her Highness nodding at in-
tervals, and dropping short epigrammatic
sentences, when necessary, to such as
were in attendance around her. 66. Is she
acting ?" said Calantha, at length, in a
whisper addressing Mr. Fremore, who
stood sneering and simpering behind her
chair. " Is she acting, or is this reality?"
" It is the only reality you will ever find
in the Princess, returned her friend.
She acts the Princess of Madagascar

till morning. You may fall from favor,
but you are now at the height: no one
ever advanced furthernone ever con-
tinued there long.
"But why," said Lady Avondale, " do
the great Nabob, and all the other Lords
in waiting, with that black horde of sa-
vages"" Reviewers, you mean, and
men of talents."
Well, whatever they
are, tell me quickly why they wear col-
lars, and chains around their necks at
Barbary House ?
" It is the fashion,"
said Mr. Fremore. - This fashion is un-
becoming your race," said Lady Avon.
dale: " I would die sooner than be thus
enchained."  The great Nabob," quoth
Mr. Fremore, " is the best, the kindest,
the cleverest man I know; but like some
philosophers, he would sacrifice much
for a peaceable life. The Princess is fond
of inflicting these lesser tyrannies ; she is
so helplessly attached to these trifles-
so overweaningly fond of exerting her
powers, it were a pity to thwart her.

For my own part I could willingly bend
to the yoke, provided the duration were
not eternal; for observe that the chains
are well gilded ; that the tables are well
stored; and those who bend the lowest
are ever the best received."
6 And if I
also bow my neck," said Calantha, will
she be grateful? May I depend upon
her seeming kindness ?" Mr. Fremore's
naturally pale complexion turned to a
bluish green at this enquiry.
Cold Princess! where are your boasted
professions now? You taught Calantha
to love you, by every petty art of which
your sex is mistress. She heard, from
your lips, the sugared poisons you were
pleased to lavish upon her. You laughed
at her follies, courted her confidence, and
flattered her into a belief that you loved
her.-Loved her !-it is a feeling yon
never felt. She fell into the mire; the
arrows of your precious crew were shot
at her-like hissing snakes hot and
sharpened with malice and venomed

fire; and you, yes--you were the first
to scorn her : you, by whom she had
stood faithfully and firmly amidst a host
of foesmaye, amidst the fawning rabble,
who still crowd your doors, and laugh at
and despise you. Thanks for the helping
hand of friendship in the time of need
the mud and the mire have been washed
from Calantha ; the arrows have been
drawn from a bleeding bosom; the
heart is still sound, and beats to disdain
you. The sun may shine fairly again
upon her; but never, whilst existence is
prolonged, will she set foot within the
gates of the Palace of the great Nabob,
or trust to the smiles and professions of
the Princess of Madagascar.

in aiming arrows at his heart. Has he
one?-I think not?"- But who has one
in London?""You have not assuredly,"
said the Count : "and, if you knew the
censures that are every where passed
upon you, I think, for Lord Avondale's

sake, you would regret it.""I do ;
but indeed I know enough. I have
friends, have I not? and who, that has
friends, is ignorant of what is said ? it is
the office of a friend, I believe," said
Lady Avondale, smiling, "to say to us
what a foe would not."
The entrance of Buchanan put a stop
to this conversation. "Are you ready?"
he cried. " Ready! I have waited for
you three hours: it is five, and you pro-
mised to come before two." -" You
would excuse me, I am sure, if you knew
how excessively ill I have been. I am
but this moment out of bed. That ac-
cursed hazard kept me up till ten this
morning. Once, I sat two days and nights
at it; but it's no matter.""You take
no care of yourself. I wish for my sake
you would." The manner in which Ca-
lantha said this, was most particularly
flattering and kind : it was, indeed, ever
SO ; but the return she met with (like
the lady who loved the swine); "Honey,"

quoth she, "thou shalt in silver salvers
dine :" 66 Humph," quoth he, was most
uncourteous.-"Truly I care not if I am
knocked on the head to-morrow," replied
Buchanan. " There is nothing worth
living for: every thing annoys me: I am
sick of all society-love, sentiment, is
my abhorrence."-"But driving, dearest
Buchanan-riding your mother-your
--your cousin.""Oh, d...n it; don't
talk about it. It's all a great bore."
"And can Lady Avondale endure this
jargon?"-" What is that Italian here
again?" whispered Buchanan.

they are quite unbroke; and the boy can't
hold them. Little Jem yesterday had
his ribs broke; and this youngster 's no

perdition," whispered Gondimar. "Can't
wait," said Buchanan, impatiently : and
Calantha hurried away.
The curricle was beautiful; the horses
fiery; Buchanan in high spirits; and

more elated with this exhibition through
the crowded streets, than she could have
been at the most glorious achievement.
" Drive faster-faster still," she conti-

real courage delights not in parade ; but
any thing that had the appearance of risk
or danger, delighted Calantha.

Calantha. "Oh hang it; do'nt talk

speak to him; and Dick, the boxer's

in, as Buchanan termed it: and a con-
versation ensued, which amused Calan-
tha extremely.
" How soon shall you
be off?" said Will Rattle, as they pre-
pared to drive on.--" It's a devilish bore
staying in London now," replied Bucha-
nan: "only I've been commanded to
stay," saying which he smiled, and turned
to Lady Avondale, " or I should have

moment I am released, however, I shall
go there. Hope to see you to-night,
Will. Mind and bring Charles Turner.
There's a new play. Oh, I forgot :-
perhaps I shan't be let off; shall I ?-
"No,"replied Calantha, extremely pleas-
ed at this flattering appeal. Will bowed
with conceit, and off they galloped,
Buchanan repeating as they went, " A
damned strange fellow that  cleverer
than half the people though, who make
such a noise. I saved his life once in an
engagement. Poor Will! he's so grate-
ful, he would give all he has for me
I'll be d.....d if he would not."-Let this
suffice. The drive was not very long;
and, the danger of being overturned ex-
cepted, utterly devoid of interest.
Lady Dartford had returned to town.
Perhaps no one ever heard that she had
left it: like the rose leaf upon the glass
full of water, her innocent presence made
not the slightest difference, nor was her

absence at any time observed. She, how -
ever called upon Calantha, a few mo-
ments after Buchanan had taken her
home. Lady Avondale was with her
lord in the library, when she came.
"Why did you let her in?" she said
rather crossly to the servant; when ano-
ther loud rap at the door announced Lady
Mandeville and Lady Augusta Selwyn.
Calantha was writing a letter; and Lord
Avondale was talking to her of the ar-
rangements for their departure. "I wish
I could ever see you one moment alone,"
he said."Say I am coming-or shall
not come," she replied; and during the
time she remained to finish the conver.
sation with her husband, she could not
help amusing herself with the thought of
Lady Dartford's alarm at finding herself
in the presence of Lady Mandeville,
whom she did not visit. " You do not
attend at all," said Lord Avondale. Alas!
he had already found, that the mistress
of his momentary passion, was not the

255
-
friend and companion of his more serious
thoughts.
Eager to amuse Lady Dartford, Lady
Augusta, who knew her well, entertained
her till Lady Avondale joined them, with
: a variety of anecdotes of all that had taken
place since her departure; and, having
soon exhausted other subjects, began
upon Calantha herself. "She is posi-
tively in love with Captain Buchanan,"
she said. "At every ball he dances with
her; at every supper he is by her side ;
all London is talking of it. Only think
too how strange, just as it is said that he
has proposed to Miss Macvicker--a for-
tune-twenty thousand a year--a nice
girl, who really looks unhappy. Poor
thing! it is very hard on her. I always
feel for girls.-" Come," said Lady Man-
deville, " last night you know, they did
not interchange a word: he talked the
whole evening to that young lady with
the singular name.
How I detest gos-
siping and scandal. Calantha deserves
not this."-"Bless us! how innocent

we are all of a sudden !" interrupted
Lady Augusta ;-- have you any preten-
sions, dearest lady, to that innoxious
quality ? Now are you not aware that
this is the very perfection of the art of
making lovethis not speaking? But
this is what always comes of those who
are so mighty fond of their husbands.
Heavens ! how sick I have been of all
the stories of their romantic attachment.
There is nothing, my dear, like Miss
Seymour for making one sick. She al-
ways gives me the vapours."
"Where do you go to-night?" said
Lady Dartford, wishing to interrupt a
conversation which gave her but little
pleasure. Oh, to fifty places ; but I
came here partly too in the hope of en-
gaging Lady Avondale to come to me to-
night. She is a dear soul, and I do not
like her the worse for shewing a little
spirit."" I cannot," said Lady Mande-
ville, " think there is much in this ; a
mere caprice, founded on both sides in a
little vanity.
After seeing Lord Avon-

dale, I cannot believe there is the small-
est danger for her. Good heavens! if I
had possessed such a husband !"" Oh,
now for sentiment," said Lady Augusta :
" and God knows, if I had possessed a
dozen such, I should have felt as I do at
this moment. Variety-variety! Better
change for the worse than always see the
same object."-"Well, if you do not
allow the merit of Henry Avondale to
outweigh this love of variety, what say
you to Mr. Buchanan, being her cousin,
brought up with her from a child ?"-
" Thanks for the hint ; you remember
the song of
Nous nous aimions ds l'enfance
Tte-d-tte  chaque instant."
and I am certain, my dear sentimental
friend, that
A notre place
Vous en auriez fait autant."
Then going up to the glass, Lady Au-
gusta bitterly inveighed against perverse
nature, who with such a warm heart had
given her such an ugly face.
" Do you

know," she said, still gazing upon her
uncouth features, addressing herself to
Lady Dartford" do you know that I
have fallen in love myself since I saw
you ;-and with whom do
you
think ?"
" I think I can guess, and shall take great
credit to myself if I am right. Is not
the happy man an author?" said Lady
Dartford. -- You have him, upon my
honour-Mr. Clarendon, by all that is
wonderful:- he is positively the clever-
est man about town.- Well, I am glad
to see my affairs also make some little
noise in the world."-" I can tell you
however," said Lady Mandeville, " that
he is already engaged;--and Lady Moun-
teagle occupies every thought of his
heart."
" Good gracious, my dear, living and
loving have done but little for you; and
the dead languages prevent your judging
of living objects  Engaged! you talk
of falling in love as if it were a matri-
monial contract for life. Now don't

ject to change:-it rains to-day--it shines
to-morrow ;-we laugh, we cry ;-and
the thermometer of love rises and falls,
like the weather glass, from the state of
the atmosphere:-one while it is at freez-
ing point;--another it is at fever heat.
-How then should the only imaginary
thing in the whole affair-the object I
mean which is always purely idealhow
should that remain the same?"
Lady Mandeville smiled a little, and
turning her languid blue eyes upon Lady
Dartford, asked her if she were of the
Christian persuasion ? Lady Dartford
was perfectly confounded :-she besitat-
ingly answered in the affirmative. Upon
which, Lady Augusta fell back in her
chair, and laughed immoderately ; but
fearful of offending her newly made ac-
quaintance, observed to her, that she
wore the prettiest hat she had ever seen.
"Where did you get it?" said she.--The
question was a master key to Lady Dart-
ford's thoughts:-caps, hats, and works
of every description were as much a so-

lace to her, in the absence of her hus-
band, as the Greek language, or the pa-
gan philosophy could have ever been to
Lady Mandeville, under any of her mis-
fortunes.- I got it," she said, " bright-
ening up with a grateful look, at the only
enquiry she had heard, that was at all
adapted to her understanding, at Madame
de la Roche's :-it is the cheapest thing
you can conceive :-I only gave twenty
guineas for it:-and you know I am not
reckoned very clever at making-bas-
gains." "I should think not," answered
Lady Augusta, adverting only to the first
part of the sentence.
Calantha entered at this moment.
" Oh, my sweet soul," said Lady Au-
gugusta, embracing her, "I began to
despair of seeing you.-But what was
the matter with you last night? I had
just been saying that you looked so very
grave. Notwithstanding which, Lord
Dallas could think, and talk only of you.

ment that is not paid directly or indi-
rectly to myself. He is quite adorable:
do you not think so, hey ?-No-I
see he is too full of admiration for you-
too refined. Lady Avondale's heart must
be won in a far different manner :-insult
-rudeness-is the way to it. What!
blush so deeply! Is the affair, then, too
serious for a jest? Why, mon enfant, you
look like Miss Macvicker this morning.
-And is it true she will soon be united
to you by the ties of blood, as she now
seems to be by those of sympathy and
congeniality of soul?"
The eternal Count Gondimar, and afa
terwards Buchanan, interrupted Lady
Augusta's attack. New topics of dis-
course were discussed :-it will be need-
less to detail them :-time presses. Balls,
assemblies, follow:-every day exhibited
a new scene of frivolity and extrava-
gance; every night was passed in the
same vortex of fashionable dissipation.

CHAPTER XXXI.
The spring was far advanced.
Calan-
tha's health required the sea air ; but ber
situation rendered a long journey hazar-
dous. Lord Avondale resolved to await
her confinement in England. The birth
of a daughter was an additional source
of happiness : Anabel was the name given
to the little infant. Harry Mowbrey was
now in his second year. The accounts
from Ireland were more satisfactory.
Mrs. Seymour wrote constantly to Ca-
lantha, regretting her absence. Weeks,
however, flew by in the same thoughtless
vanities : months passed away without
regret or care.
Autumn was gone;
winteragain approached. London, though
deserted by the crowd, was still gay.
Calantha lived much with her aunt Mar-
garet, Lady Mandeville, and the Princess

of Madagascar. The parks and streets,
but lately so thronged with carriages,
were now comparatively lonely and de-
serted. Like the swallows at the ap-
pointed hour, the gay tribe of fashionable
idlers had vanished ; and a new set of
people appeared in their place:-whence,
or why, nobody could
guess.
One day Zerbellini, Calantha's little
page, had just returned with a note from
Buchanan; a French hair dresser was cut-
ting her hair ; milliners and jewellers were
displaying upon every table new dresses-
caps, chains, rings, for the ensuing win.
ter; and Calantha's eye was dazzled-her
ear was charmed-when her aunt Mar-
garet entered." God bless your Lady-
ship, God preserve you," said a woman
half starved, who was waiting for an an-
swer to her petition. Mi Lady ; ne
prendra-t-elle pas ce petit bonnet?" said
Madame la Roche. " Yes, every thing,
any thing," she answered impatiently,
as she got up to receive her aunt.--She

was unusually grave, Calantha trembled;
for she thought she was prepared to speak
to her about Buchanan. She was ex-
tremely relieved when she found that her
censures turned solely upon her page.
Why keep that little foreign minion?"
she said, indignantly. " Is the Count
Viviani so very dear, that any present of
his must be thus treasured up and va.
lued ?" The Count Viviani," said Ca.
lantha astonished: who is he?"-" Well,
then, Gondimar," replied Lady Margaret.
- Calanthaas a favour, I request you to
send back that boy."Lady Avondale's
prayers were at first her sole reply ; and
like Titania in her second, when Oberon
demanded the trusty Henchman, she
boldly refused. Lady Margaret left her

ed. She was then going to Castle Delaval.
Calantha told her they should join her
there in the course of the next month.
She only smiled with a look of incredu-
lity and contempt, asking her, if her be-

loved Henry would really be so cruel as
to tear her away at last from London ?
and saying this she took leave.
Lord Avondale and Calantha had been
conversing on this very subject in the
morning. He was surprised at her ready
acquiescence in his wish to return to Ire-
land. " You are then still the same," he
said affectionately." I am the same,'
she replied, rather fretfully, but you are
changed :-every one tells me you neg-
lect me.' " And have they who tell you
so," said he with a sigh, any very good
motive in thus endeavouring to injure
me in your opinion ? If I attended to
what every one said, Calantha, perhaps I
too should have some reason to complain.
-Business of importance has alone en-
gaged my attention. You know I am
not one who assume much; and if I say
that I have been employed, you may de-
pend on its being the case. I hope, then,
I am not wrong when I have confided
myself, and every thing that is dearest to
me, to your honour and your love."-

"Ah, no :-you are not wrong," she an-
swered; but perhaps if you confided less,
and saw more of me, it would be better.
Before marriage, a woman has her daily
occupations : she looks for the approving
smile of her parents :- she has friends
who cheer herwho take interest in her
affairs. But when we marry, Henry, we
detach ourselves from all, to follow one
guide. For the first years, we are the
constant object of your solicitude: you
watch over us with even a tenderer care
than those whom we have left, and then
you leave us---leave us too among the
amiable and agreeable, yet reprove us, if
we confide in them, or love them. Mar-
riage is the annihilation of love."
" The error is in human nature," said
Lord Avondale smiling -"We always
see perfection in that which we cannot
approach :there is a majesty in distance
and rarity, which every day's intercourse
wears off. Besides, love delights in gaz-
ing upon that which is superior :-whilst
we believe you angels, we kneel to you,

we are your slaves ;---we awake and find
you women, and expect obedience:-and
is it not what you were made for?"-
" Henry, we are made your idols too
too long, to bear this sad reverse :-
you should speak to us in the language
of truth from the first, or never. Obey,
is a fearful word to those who have lived
without hearing it; and truth from lips
which have accustomed us to a dearer
language, sounds harsh and discordant.
We have renounced society, and all the
dear ties of early friendship, to form one
strong engagment, and if that fails, what
are we in the world-beings without
hope or interest-dependants-encum-
brances--shadows of former joys-soli-
tary wanderers in quest of false pleasures
--or lonely recluses, unblessing and un-
blest."
Calantha had talked herself into tears,
at the conclusion of this sentence; and

she had given, so little according with

the gay being who stood before him,
pressed her fondly to his bosom ; and
said he would positively hear no more.
" You treat me like a child, a fool," she
said :" you forget that I am a reason-
able creature." "I do, indeed, Calantha:
you so seldom do any thing to remind
me of it." " Well, Henry, one day you
shall find your error. I feel that within,
which tells me that I could be superior,
aye, very superior to those who cavil at
my faults, and first encourage and then
ridicule me for them. I love, I honour
you, Henry. You
You never flatter me.
Even if you neglect me, you have con-
fidence in me--and, thank God, my heart
is still worthy of some affection. It is
yet time to amend." Calantha thought
it had been as she took in haste a re-
view of her former conduct-of time, how
neglected!friends, how, estranged !-
money lavished in vain !-and health im.
paired by the excess of late hours, and
endless, ceaseless dissipation.

but the thought of fresh air, and green
fields recurring, she was soon prepared
for the journey. She passed the in-
tervening days before her departure in
taking leave of her friends. Lady Man-
deville, in bidding adieu to her, affirmed
that the interchange of ideas between
congenial souls would never be lessened,
nor interrupted by absence. She would
write to her, she said, and she would
think of her; and, seeing Calantha was
really sorry to part with her, " You have
none of the philosophy," she said,
* which your cousin and your aunt pos-
every
trifle, therefore, has power
to afflict you :-you scarcely know me,
and yet you are grieved to leave me.
Promise ever to judge of me by what you

dium of others; for the world, which I
despise from my soul, has long sought
to crush me, because I had pride of cha.

had been sure of its effect; for it was one
of her favourite opinions, not indeed that
the world should be despised, but that
persons should dare to think, and act for
themselves, even though against its judg-
ments. She was not then aware how
this cant phrase is ever in the mouths of
the veriest slaves to prejudice,--how
little real independence of character is
found amongst those who bave lost sight
of virtue. Like spendthrifts who boast of
liberality, they are forced to stoop to arts
and means, which those whom they affect
to contemn would blush even to think of.
Virtue alone can hope to stand firm and
unawed above the multitude. When vice
assumes this fearless character, it is either
unblushing effrontery and callous indif-
ference to the opinion of the wise and
good, or at best but overweening pride,
which supports the culprit, and conceals
froin the eyes of others, the gnawing tor-
tures he endures--the bitter agonizing
consciousness of self-reproach.

CHAPTER XXXII.
LORD AVONDALE was desirous of pass-
ing the winter with his family at Mon-
teith, and in the spring he had promised
the Duke of Altamonte to accompany
Lady Avondale to Castle Delaval. Lady
Mandeville and Lady Augusta Selwyn
were invited to meet them there at that
time. The wish of pleasing Calantha,
of indulging even her very weaknesses,
seemed to be the general failing of all
who surrounded her :-yet what return
did she make?-each day new follies en-
grossed her thoughts ;-her levity and
extravagance continually increased; and
whilst, with all the ostentation of gene-
rosity, she wasted the fortune of her hus.

misery, the injustice her imprudence and
wanton prodigality had caused.
During a long and melancholy jour-
ney, and after her arrival at Monteith,
Calantha, with some astonishment, con-
sidered the difference of Lord Avondale's
views, character, and even talents for so.
ciety and conversation, as compared with
those of her former companions. Lord
Avondale had no love of ostentation-no
effort-a perfect manliness of conduct
and character, a real, and not feigned, in-
difference to the opinion and applause
of the vain and the foolish ; yet with all
this, he was happy, cheerful, ready to
enter into every amusement or occupa-
tion which gave others pleasure. He
had not one selfish feeling. It was im-
possible not to be forcibly struck with
the comparison.
Calantha, with her usual inconsist-
ency, now made all those sensible and
judicious remarks, which people always
make when they have lived a life of folly,

and suddenly return to a more tranquil
course. She compared the false gaiety
which arises from incessant hurry and
vanity with that which is produced by
nature and health. She looked upon the
blue sky and the green fields; watched
the first peeping snow-drop and croeus;
and entered with delight into all the
little innocent pleasures of a rural life:
nor did even a slight restlessness prevail,
nor any erring thoughts steal back to re-
visit the gay scenes she had left. In
very truth, she was more adapted, she
said, to her present course of life than to
any other; and, however guilty of ima
prudence, she thanked God she had not
heavier sins to answer for; nor was there
a thought of her heart she would not
have wished her husband to know, unless
from the fear of either giving him pain,
or betraying others.
At length, however, and by degrees,
something of disquiet began to steal in
upon the serenity of her thoughts:-her

mind became agitated, and sought an ob-
ject: study, nay, labour, she had preferred
to this total want of interest. While
politics and military movements engaged
Lord Avondale almost wholly, and the
rest of the family seemed to exist happily
enough in the usual course, she longed
for she knew not what. There was a
change in her sentiments, but she could
not define it. It was not as it had been
once; yet there was no cause for com-
plaint. She was happy, but her heart
seemed not to partake of her happiness;
and regret mingled at times with her en-
joyments.
Lady Mowbrey spoke with some as-
perity of her late conduct ; Lady Eliza-
beth enquired laughingly, if all she heard
were true: for every folly, every fault, ex-
aggerated and misrepresented, had flown
before her : she found that all which she
had considered as merely harmless, now
appeared in a new and more unpleasing
light. Censures at home and flattery

abroad are a severe trial to the vain and
the proud. She thought her real friends
austere; and cast one longing glance back
upon the scene which had been so lately
illumined by the gaiety, the smiles, the
kindness and courtesy of her new ac-
quaintance.
Whilst the first and only care of Lord
Avondale, every place was alike delight-
ful to Calantha; for in his society she en-
joyed all that she desired: but now that
he was often absent, and appeared to be
involved in deeper interests, she consi-
dered, with some feelings of alarm, the
loneliness of her own situation. In the
midst of hundreds she had no real friends:
those of her childhood were estranged
from her by her marriage ; and those her
marriage had united her with, seemed to
perceive only her faults, nor appreciated
the merits she possessed. To dress well,
to talk well, to write with ease and per-
spicuity, had never been her turn. Un-
used to the arts and amusements of so-
cial intercourse, she had formerly felt

interest in poetry, in music, in what had
ceased to be, or never had existed ; but
now the same amusements, the same
books, had lost their charm : she knew
more of the world, and saw and felt their
emptiness and fallacy. In the society of
the generality of women and men she
could find amusement when any amuse-
ment was to be found ; but, day after
day, to hear sentiments she could not
think just, and to lose sight of all for
which she once had felt reverence and
enthusiasm, was hard. If she pamed one
she loved, that one was instantly consi-
dered as worthless: if she expressed much
eagerness for the success of any project,
that eagerness was the subject of ridi.
cule; and even at home, with Lady
Elizabeth and Lady Mowbrey, she felt
that she had conducted herself in a man-
ner they could not approve; she re-
ceived a thousand proofs of their kind-
ness and affection, but she pined also for
their esteem.

thought: I have repressed and conquered
every warm and eager feeling; I love and
admire nothing: yet am I not heartless
and cold enough for the world in which
I live. What is it that makes me mise-
rable? There is a fire burns within my
soul; and all those whom I see and hear
are insensible. Avondale alone feels as
I do; but, alas! it is no longer for me.
Were I dead, what difference would it
make to any one? I am the object of
momentary amusement or censure to
thousands; but of love, to none. I am as
a child, as a mistress to my husband; but
never his friend, his companion. Oh for
a heart's friend, in whom I could confide
every thought and feeling! who would
share and sympathize with my joy or
sorrow! to whom I could say, you
love me you require my presence;"
and for whom, in return, I would give
up every other enjoyment. Such friend
was once Lord Avondale. By

GLENARVON,
Often when in tears she thus expressed
herself. Her husband would suddenly
enter; laugh with her without penetrat-
ing her feelings ; or, deeply interested in
the cares of business, seek her only as a
momentary solace and amusement. Such,
however, he seldom now found her; for
she cherished a discontented spirit within
her: and though too proud and stubborn
to complain, she lived but on the me-
mory of the past.
Her principles had received a shock,
the force and effect of which was greatly
augmented by a year of vanity and
folly : her health too was impaired from
late hours and an enervating life ; she
could not walk or ride as formerly ;
and her great occupation was the indul.
gence of a useless and visionary train of
thinking. She imagined that which was
not, and lost sight of reality ;--pictured
ideal virtues, and saw not the world as it
is. Her heart beat with all the fervour
of enthusiasm ; but the turn it took was

erroneous, She heard the conversation
of others; took a mistaken survey of so-
ciety ; and withdrew herself impercepti-
bly from all just and reasonable views.
Il motives were imputed to her, for what
she considered harmless imprudence:-
she felt the injustice of these opinions ;
and, instead of endeavouring to correct
those appearances which had caused such
severe animadversion, in absolute disgust
she steeled herself against all remon-
strances. Every one smiles on me and
seems to love me, yet I am censured
and misrepresented. Convinced of this,
she became lonely. She had thoughts
which once she would have mentioned
as they occurred, but which she now
concealed and kept solely to herself. She
became dearer in her own estimation, as
she detached herself from others, and
began to feel coldly, even towards those
whom she had once loved.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
It is dangerous to begin life by surren-
dering every feeling of the mind and the
heart to any violent passion. Calantha
had loved and been loved to such an ex-
cess, that all which followed it appeared
insipid. Vanity might fill the space for
a moment-or friendship, or. charity, or
benevolence; but still there was some.
thing gone, which, had it never existed,
had never been missed and required.

gent and more affectionate now, than at
first; for a lover ever plays the tyrant ;
but even this indulgence was different;

devotion that ardent, constant solici.

ject in life to the person thus attached
all this was past.
Such love is not depravity. To have
felt it, and to feel it no more, is like being
deprived of the light of the sun, and
seeing the same scenes, which we once
viewed brilliant beneath its beams, dark,
clouded, and cheerless. Calantha had
given up her heart too entirely to its
power, ever more to endure existence
without it. Her home was a desert;
her thoughts were heavy and dull; her
spirits and her health were gone; and
even the desire of pleasing, so natural to
the vain, had ceased. Whom was she
to wish to please, since Avondale was ina
different? or, what to her was the same,
absent and pre-occupied.
Such depression continued during the
gloomy wintry months; but with the
first warm breeze of spring, they left her:
and in the month of May, she prepared
to join the splendid party which was ex-

pected at Castle Delaval-as gay in
heart herself as if she had never mo-
ralized upon the perishable character of
all human happiness.
Upon a cool and somewhat dreary
morning, they left Monteith, and sleep-
ing one night at Allanwater, hastened
to Castle Delaval, where blazing hearths
and joyous countenances, gave them
a cheering welcome. Lady Mandeville
aud Lady Augusta had, according to
promise, arrived there a week before,
to the utter consternation of Mrs. Sey-
mour. Calantha perceived in one mo-
ment that she was not extremely well
with her or with her cousins upon this
account.
Indeed the former scarcely
offered her her hand, such a long detail
of petty offences had been registered
against her since they had last parted.
A stately dignity was therefore assumed
by Sophia and Mrs. Seymour on this
occasion ; they scarce permitted them-

selves to smile during the whole time
Lady Mandeville remained, for fear, it
may be supposed, that Satan, taking ad-
vantage of a moment of levity, should
lead them into further evil. The being
compelled to live in company with one
of her character, was more than enough.
"I am enraptured at your arrival,"
said Lady Augusta, flying towards Ca-
lantha the moment she perceived her.
" You are come at the happiest time:
you will be diverted here in no ordinary
manner: the days of romance are once
again displayed to our wondering view.
Yes," said Lady Trelawney, " not a
day passes without an adventure." Be-
tore Calantha enquired into the meaning
of this, she advanced to Lady Mandeville,
who, languidly reclining upon a couch,
smiled sweetly on seeing her. Secure of
the impression she had made, she waited
to be sought, and throwing her ar
around her, gave her kisses so soft and

so tender, that she could not immedi.
ately extricate herself from her embrace.
Lady Augusta, eager to talk, ex-
claimed" Did you meet any of the
patrole?" " Possibly--but I was read-
ing the address to the United Irishmen,
and could see, therefore, and think of
nothing else.". " Are you aware who
is the author ?" " No; but it is so
eloquent, so animated, I was quite alarm-
ed when I thought how it must affect
the people." " You shock me, Calan-
tha," said Mrs. Seymour. " The absurd
rhapsody you mean, is neither eloquent
nor animating: it is a despicable attempt
to subvert the government, a libel upon
the English, and a poor piece of flattery
to delude the infatuated malcontents in
Ireland. Lady Augusta winked at Calan-
tha, as if informing her that she touched
upon a sore subject.
" The author,"
said Lady Trelawney, who affected to be
an enthusiast, " is Lord Glenarvon."

names.
I wish, Frances,' said Mrs. Seymour,
you would call people by their right
The young man you call Lord
Glenarvon has no claim to that title; bis
grandfather was a traitor; his father was
a poor miserable exile, who was obliged
to enter the navy by way of gaining a
livelihood; his mother was a woman of
very doubtful character (as she said this
she looked towards Lady Mandeville);
and this young man, educated nobody
knows how, having passed his time in a
foreign country, nobody knows where,
from whence he was driven it seems by
his crimes, is now unfortunately arrived
here to pervert and mislead others, to
disseminate his wicked doctrines amongst
an innocent but weak people, and to
spread the flames of rebellion, already
kindled in other parts of the island. Oh,
he is a dishonour to his sex, and it
makes me mad to see how you all run
after him, and forget both dignity and
modesty, to catch a glimpse of him."

" What sort of looking man is he, dear
aunt? said Calantha. "Frightful-mean,"
said Mrs. Seymour. " His stature is
small," said Lady Mandeville; "but his
eye is keen and his voice is sweet and
tunable. Lady Avondale believe me, he
is possessed of that persuasive language,
which never fails to gain upon its hear-
ers. Take heed to your heart : remem -
ber my words--beware of the young
Glenarvon. Gondimar, after the first
salutation upon entering the room,
joined in the conversation ; but he spoke
with bitterness of the young Lord; and
upon Lady Trelawney's attempting to
say a few words in his favor, " Hear Sir
Everard on this subject," said the Count
-"only hear what he thinks of him."
"I fear," said Sophia, " that all these
animadversions will prevent our going
to-morrow, as we proposed, to see the
Priory." Nothing shall prevent me,"
replied Lady Augusta. "I only beg,"
said Mrs. Seymour " that I may not be

of the party, as the tales of horror I have
heard concerning the inhabitants of St.
Alvin Priory, from old Lord de Ruthven,
at Belfont Abbey, prevent my having the
smallest wish or curiosity to enter its
gates."
Count Gondimar, now coming to-
wards Calantha, enquired after Zerbellini.
At the request of every one present, he
was sent for. Calantha saw a visible
change in Lady Margaret's countenance,
as he entered the room. " He is the
living image"-she murmured, in a low
hollow tone-" Of whom?" said Calan-
tha eagerly.-She seemed agitated and
retired. Gondimar in the evening took
Calantha apart and said these extraor-
dinary words to her, " Zerbellini is Lady
Margaret and Lord Dartford's son : treat
him according to his birth ; but remem-
ber, she would see him a slave sooner
than betray herself: she abhors, yet loves
him. Mark her ; but never disclose the
sccret with which I entrust you." As-

tonished, confounded, Calantha now
looked upon the boy with different eyes.
Immediately his resemblance to the fa-
mily of Delaval struck her-his likeness
to herself-his manner so superior to
that of a child in his situation. The
long concealed truth, at once flashed
upon her. A thousand times she was
tempted to speak upon the subject.
She had not promised to conceal it from
Lord Avondale: she was in the habit of
telling him every thing: however she
was now for the first time silent, and
there is no more fatal sympton than
when an open communicative disposi-
tion grows reserved.

CHAPTER I.
In the morning Calantha beheld crowds
of discontented catholics who thronged
the outer courts waiting to see her father.
Petitions for redress were thrown in at
the windows; and whilst they were at
breakfast, Sir Everard entering, without
even waiting to see who was present,
asked eagerly if the Duke were at home:
he, at the same moment gave a huge paper
closely written, into the hands of one of
the servants, desiring it to be instantly
delivered to the Duke; " and tell him,
sir," vociferated the doctor, "it is my
case written out clear, as he commanded
--that which I had the honour to present
to him t'other day, when he had not lei-
sure to look upon it:" then turning round,

and seeing Calantha,
By my soul," he
exclaimed, " if here ain't my own dear
Lady Calantha; and God be praised Ma-
dam, you are come amongst us; for the
devil and all is broke loose since you've
been away. Let's look at you: well, and
you are as tall and handsome as ever; but
I-Oh! Lady Calantha Delaval, begging
your pardon, what a miserable wretch am
I become. Lord help me, and deliver
me. Lord help us all, in unmerited af-
fliction."
Calantha had not heard of Sir Everard's
misfortunes; and was really afraid to ask
him what had occurred. He held her
hand, and wept so audibly, that she al-
ready saw some of those present turning
away, least they should not be able to
conceal theirlaughter: his strangegestures
were indeed a hard trial.
" Be pacified,
calm yourself my good Doctor," said Mrs.
Seymour, giving him a chair: " Heaven

Madam, will have a vent. I am the most

miserable man alive: I am undone, you
well know; but Lord! this dear child
knows little if any thing about it.
Oh!
I am a mere nothing now in the uni-
verse." Gondimar, with a smile, assured
Sir Everard that could never be the case,
whilst he retained, unimpaired, that full
rotundity of form. "Sir, are you here?"
cried the Doctor fiercely: " but it is of
small importance. I am no longer the
soft phlegmatic being you left me. I am
a wild beast, Sir-a dangerous animal.-
Away with your scoffs.--I will fight, Sir
---murder, Sir-aye, and smile whilst I
murder."
There was something in these words
which turned Lady Margaret's cheeks to
a deadly pale; but the Doctor, who had
sought for forcible expressions alone,
without the least heeding the application,
continued to storm and to rage. , " I'm a
man," he cried, " accustomed to suffer-
ings and to insult. Would

was in attendance at the breakfast table,

Rector of Belfont, when he comes, will
speak a word for him thoft," returned
Gerald Mac Allain; "for, save the presence
of the Duke, who is not here to hear me,

while his grace's honour has been out of
the kingdom." "Curses light upon him
and his gang," cried Sir Everard, furi-
ously. Are not Miss Laura and Miss Jes-
sica after him at this very time, and my
pretty niece, my young, my dear Elinor,
and Lady St. Clare, more crazy than all,
is not she following him about as if he
were some god?"
" The whole country are after him,"
cried Gerald Mac Allain, enthusiastically:
" Tis a rage, a fashion." " Tis a phren-
zy," returned the Doctor," a pestilence
which has fallen on the land, and all it is

would permit me to do so."
" A truce to these quarrels, good
doctor," said the Duke, who had entered
the room during the latter part of the dis-
cussion. " I have been reading some
papers of a very serious nature; and 1
am sorry to say it appears from them
that Sir Everard has very great cause for
his present irritation of mind: he is an
aggrieved man. This Lord Glenarvon,
or whatever the young gentleman styles
himself, has acted in a manner not only
unjustifiable, but such as I am afraid will
ultimately lead to his entire ruin. Count
Gondimar, I have often heard you speak
of this unfortunate young man, with
more than common interest. Could not
you make use of your friendship and in-
timacy with him, to warn him of the dan-
ger of his present conduct, and lead him
- from the society of his worthless associ-
ates. He seems to be acting under the
influence of a madinfatuation." Gondimar

assured the Duke that he had no sort of
influence with the young Lord.
" Read
these papers, at your leisure," said the
Duke: they are statements, you will
find, of a number of outrages committed
by himself and his followers, on people
highly respectable and utterly defence-
less. For the common follies of youth,
there is much excuse; but nothing can
palliate repeated acts of licentious wick-
edness and unprovoked cruelty. I am
inclined to believe these accounts are
much exaggerated; but the list of griev-
ances is large; and the petitioners for re-
dress are many of them my most worthy
and long-tried servants, at the head of
whom O'Flarney's name is to be found."
" No, my Lord,-mine is at the head
of the list," cried the doctor; " and in
every other part of it, no injuries can be
equal to mine. What are barns, pigs, fire-
arms, compared to a father's wrongs-
a husband's injuries. Ah, consider my
case first. Restore Miss St. Clare, and I will

by my cry? It is my niece, my favourite
child, who has been taken from me."
Pray explain to me seriously, Sir,"
said Lady Augusta, approaching the doc-
tor, with much appearance of interest,
" how came your family to fall into the
unfortunate situation to which you al-
lude?" " How came they," said the
Count? can you ask, when you see Sir
Everard at the head of it?" Madam,
said the Doctor with equal solemnity,
" this momentous crisis has been ap-
proaching some time. St. Clara, as we
called her, my most lovely and interest-
ing Elinor's affections have long been
seduced. We all knew, lamented and
concealed the circumstance. The old
lady's conduct, however, was quite an
unexpected blow. But since they took to
their nocturnal rambles to St. Mary's, St.
Alvin's, and all the saints around, their
sanctity has not been much mended that

My own disgrace I can easily support:

" What nocturnal meetings have taken
place at St. Mary's and St. Alvin's?" said
Lady Trelawney, with a face of eager cu-
riosity. " The discontented' flock toge-
ther in shoals," said the Doctor, indig-
nantly, " till by their machinations, they
will overturn the State. At Belfont, op-
posite my very window,-aye, even in
that great square house which Mr. Ochal-
lavan built, on purpose to obstruct Lady
St. Clare's view, have they not set up a
library? The Lord help me.
And was it
not there I first saw that accursed pamphlet
Lord Glenarvon wrote; which rhapsody
did not I myself immediately answer?

CHAPTER II.
The party at the castle had postponed
their visit to St. Alvin Priory till the feast
of St. Kathereen and St. Mary, which
in that neighbourhood was always cele-
brated with much observance. A fair
was held upon the downs in honour
of these two martyrs. The rocks near
which the ruins of the convent stood,
were called the Black Sisters, and it was
there and in the Wizard's Glen, which
stretched from the top to the foot of the
mountain, that the meetings of the dis-
contented had been held. The day proved
fair ; and at an early hour the carriages
and horses were in attendance. Mrs. Sey-
mour and many others declined being of
the party ; but Lady Margaret took Gon-
dimar's arm with a smile of good hu-
mour, which she could as times put on.

Buchanan drove Calantha in his barouch.
Sir Everard rode by Calantha's side on a
lowly white palfrey, as if to protect her.
Lady Mandeville was with her; and Lady
Trelawney took Sophia and Lady Augusta
Selwyn in her carriage. The rest of the
gentlemen were some on horseback and
some in curricles.
The whole country smiled around.
There were ringers, and pipers, and hur-
lers upon the down. The cliff, towards
the sea, was covered with booths and
tents. Flocks, herds and horses had
been brought from far for sale, orna-
mented with ribbands ; green being the
favourite colour. Scarcely ever was wit-
nessed a scen more gay. This, and the
vessels laden with fish, crowding into the
harbour below, and the high mountains
beyond, struck even the Italian, whose
eyes had been accustomed to all that
nature can produce of picturesque and
majestic. The beauty of the girls, with
their long blue mantles thrown aside

from their shoulders, their dark hair fas-
tened behind with a knot of ribband, was
the subject of discussion. Comparisons
of the difference of form between one
nation and another arose. All descended
from their carriages and horses. Lady
Mandeville repeated poetry ; Gondimar
became sentimental ; Buchanan looked
at the horses, enquired their prices, and
soon joined the hurlers, in whose combat
he grew so much interested, that no one
could draw him from thence until the
moment when they left the fair, where
they remained till they were all much
fatigued.
" What are you laughing at so im-
mensely ?" cried Lady Augusta Selwyn,
approaching Lord Trewlawney, who was
nearly enclosed in a circle of some hun-
dreds. The moment Lady Augusta ap-
proached, with a courtesy seldom seen
but in Ireland, the crowd made way for
her. "I am listening," he said, " to a
preacher-a most capital preacher, whom

him : what a rogue it is, with that hypo-
critic. mildness of manner, that strait
black hair, that presbyterian stiffness
and simplicity."
" But what is he say-
ing ?" enquired Lady Augusta. The
preacher, standing upon a cart, was de-
livering an exhortation in a very emphatic
manner, to a vast concourse of attentive
hearers. The presence of the party from
the Castle had no effect upon him : he
was inveighing against the insolence of
his superiors in rank, and pleading in
favour of the rights of man.
When he had concluded his discourse,
the crowd dispersed, some laughing at
him, and some edified by his dis-
O'Kelly looked after them :-
" That is the way of the world," he said:
" it gets all it can from a man, and then it
leaves him ; but all that is, is for the best
therefore, amen, your honours; so be it."
Lord Trelawney laughed to an excess.
" Your name," he said, "Itake it, itis Cow-
course,

del O'Kelly." " If you take it to be my
name, your honour can't be any ways
wrong in calling me by it; but I call
myself citizen Wailman."
" And why
the devil, my honest friend, do you call
yourself so?" " To please myself, and
trick my master.' " And pray who is
your master"
Go When I know that
I'll let you know.' 66 What! not know
your master "
" Why what master
knows his servant? There's nothing ex-
traordinary in that, my Lord."
* But
pray, my good citizen Wailman, where
do you live, and where does your master
live!" " I live where I can, your honour;
and as to my master, every one knows he
lives under ground, in the family vault."
" Is he dead then, or what can he be
doing under ground ?" said Lady Tre-
lawney. Looking for friends, Miss, I
believe ; for he has none, that I see, above
board." " I am sure this is a rebel in
disguise," whispered lady Trelawney.
Her Lord laughed.

A beautiful little boy now pushing his
way through the crowd, plainly pro-
nounced the words, O'Kelly, come
home ; I am very tired." The man, has-
tily descending from the cart, called him
his young prince -- his treasure ; and
lifted him up in his arms. " He is about
the same age as Harry Mowbrey," said
Calantha," and very like him." What
is
your name, my pretty child ?" "Clare
of Costolly," said the boy; "and it should
by rights be Lord Clare-should it not,
O'Kelly?" As he spoke, he smiled and
put his little rosy hands to O'Kelly's
mouth, who kissed them, and making a
slight bow would have retired. " What,
are you going? will you not stay a mo-
ment ?" " I fear I intrude too much on
your honour's time." " Not in the least-
not in the least, good Mister Wailman ;
pray stay a little longer." "Why, fair
and honest, if I don't intrude too much
on your time, my Lord, you do on mine ;
and so your servant."

" I really believe he belongs to the
abbey," said Lady Trelawney, who had
re-entered her barouche, and was driving
with the rest of the party towards St.
Alvin Priory. " See how he steals along
by the cliff in the same direction we are
going." "It was a lovely child," said Lady
Augusta, "but to be sure no more like
Harry ; only Lady Avondale is always in
the seventh heaven of romance." "Look,
pray look," interrupted Frances : " I as-
sure you that is Sir Everard St. Clare's
wife, and Lauriana and Jessica are with
her. I am certain of it," she continued,
throwing herself nearly out of the car-
riage to gaze upon them. Lord Trelaw-
ney was extremely diverted.
66 And
there is the recruiting serjeant: only ob-
serve the manner in which they are
habited." The two unhappy girls, drest
in the most flaunting attire, singing in
chorus the song of liberty, both covered
with green ribbands, were walking in
company with a vast number of young

men, most of them intoxicated, and all
talking and laughing loudly. Calantha
begged Buchanan to stop the carriage,
that she also might see them pass: which
they did, marching to the sound of the
drum and fife : but her heart sickened
when she saw the beautiful recluse of
Glenaa amongst them.
Elinor came
near : she raised her full black eye, and
gazed with fearless effrontery upon Ca-
lantha.
It was the same face she had seen a
few years back at the convent: but alas,
how changed;the rich and vivid crim-
son of her cheek, the deep dark brown
of the wild ringlets which waved above
her brow, the bold masculine manners
and dress she had assumed, contrasted
strongly with the slender beauty of her
upright form. She was drest in uniform.
and walked by the side of a young man,
whose pale and thoughtful countenance
struck every one. Elinor appeared des-
perate and utterly hardened: her pre-

sence inspired Calantha with a mixed
feeling of horror and commise ration,
which Lady St. Clare's ludicrous figure,
and Jessica and Lauriana's huge and
clumsy personages turned into disgust.
"Oh did you behold her ?-did you
see my poor deluded Elinor?" cried Sir
Everard, riding up to Calantha, as she
still gazed from the open carriage upon
the procession:
" did you see my unfor-
tunate girls ?" " I did, indeed," said
Lady Avondale, the tears springing into
her
eyes: "I saw them and stopped; for
it occurred to me, that, perhaps, I might
speak to themmight yet save them."
" And would you have condescended
so much! Oh! this is more than I
dared to ask or hope." Saying which,
the Doctor wept, as was his custom,
and Buchanan laughed.
66 You are so
good," continued he, " you were in tears
when you saw your former playmates
disgracing themselves, and their sex ;
but in the rest of the carriages I heard

nothing but jesting and loud laughter.
And oh! would you credit it, can you
believe it, Lady St. Clare had the auda-
city to drop me a courtesy as she passed."
" Was the tall young man, who was
walking by the side of Elinor, Cyrel

Doctor"gone mad like the rest, though
they tell me it is all for the love of Miss
Alice ; and that since her loss, he is
grown desperate, and cares not what
becomes of him. They'll be hang'd,
however ; that is one consolationLady
St. Clare, as well as the rest. Indeed,"
cried he, drawing closer, "I am credibly
informed that the officers of justice have
an eye upon them, and wait only for fur
ther evidence of their treasonable prac-
tices, before they secure them." During
this discourse, the carriage drove slowly
up the hill; but soon proceeding at a
brisker pace, the Doctor was obliged to
-draw in his steed and retire. The party
now entered the park.

CHAPTER III.
BELFONT Abbey and St. Alvin's ruined
Priory appeared in view.
The ivy
climbed around the turret; and the grass
grew upon the paved courts, where deso-
lation and long neglect prevailed. At a
distance from the convent, a ruin, a lone-
ly pile stood upon the cliff in solitary
grandeur. Not a tree, nor any appearance
of cultivation was seen around : barren
moors, the distant mountains, and the
vast ocean, every where filled the eye.
The servants rang at the bell of the outer
gate : it resounded through the vaulted
passages with a long repeated echo.
A boy immediately answered the sum-
mons; and with a look of stupid asto-
nishment, waited in expectation of their
commands.
Buchanan enquired of the boy, if they

23
might see the Priory. "I suppose so," was
his reply. And without further preamble,
they alighted. 66 It must be rather me-
lancholy to live here during the winter
months," said Calantha to the boy, as
she passed him. " And summer too,".
he answered. " We are told," said
Frances, " that this Priory is haunted by
ghosts : have you ever seen any ?" He
shook his head. " I hears them some-
times, an' please your honour," he said ;
but I never meddles with them, so they
never comes after me as I see." Are you
going to shew us the house ?" cried Sir
Everard advancing; or, if not, why do
you keep us waiting in this dark passage?
go on; we are in haste." The boy, pro-
ceeding towards an inner apartment,
knocked at the door, calling to the
housekeeper, and telling her that there
was company below who wished to take
the round of the castle. The old dame
courtesying low, in a mysterious manner,

led the way : the boy immediately re-
treated.
Calantha was much tired ; her spirits
had undergone a severe shock; and the
sight of Linden and St. Clara, as she was
still called, made an impression upon her
she scarcely could account for. The
gaiety of the dresses, the fineness of the
evening, the chorus of voices laughing and
singing as they marched along, indifferent
apparently to their future fate--perhaps,
hardened and insensible to it-all made
an impression which it is impossible the
description of the scene can give ; but
long it dwelt in her remembrance. Un-
used to check herself in any feeling, she
insisted
upon remaining in front of the
Castle, whilst the rest of the party ex-
plored its secret mysteries and recesses.
"I am sure you are frightened." said Lord
Trelawney; " but perhaps you will have
more cause than we: it looks very gloomy
without, as well as within."
They went, and she remained upon the

cliff, watching the calm sea, and the boats
at a distance, as they passed and repassed
from the fair.." And can a few short
years
thus harden the heart?" she exclaimed,
"was St. Clara innocent, happy, virtuous ?
Canonemomentof errorthus have changed
her? Oh! it is not possible. Long before
the opportunity for evil presented itself,
her uncontrouled passions must have
misled her, and her imagination, wild
and lawless, must have depraved her
heart. Alice was innocent: he who first
seduced her from peace, deceived her ;
but St. Clara was not of this character,
I understand I think I understand the
feelings which impelled her to evil. Her
image haunts me: I tremble with appre-
hension. Something within seems to
warn me, and to say that, if I wander
from virtue, like her, nothing will check
my course, all the barriers, that others
fear to overstep, are nothing before me.

St. Clara fills me with alarm. Avondale,

where art thou ? save me. My course is
but just begun : who knows whither the
path I follow leads ? my will-my un-
governed will, has been hitherto, my
only law."
Upon the air at that moment she heard
the soft notes of a flute. She listened
attentively:-it ceased. There are times
when the spirit is troubled; when the
mind, after the tumult of dissipated and
active life, requires rest and seeks to be
alone. Then thoughts crowd in upon us
so fast, that we hardly know how to bear
them ; conscience reflects upon every
former action; and the heart within
trembles, as if in dread of approaching
evil. The scene around was calculated
to inspire every serious reflection. The
awful majesty of the ruined building, ill
accorded with the loud laugh and the
jests of the merry party now entering its
walls. Once those walls had been, per-
haps, inhabited by beings as thoughtless
and gay: Where were they now? had

they any memory of the past? knowledge
of the present? or are they cold, silent,
and insensible as those deserted scenes ?
how perishable is human happiness! what
recollection has the mind of any former
state ? in the eye of a creator can a mite,
scarcely visible, be worth either solicitude
or anger? "Vain the presumptuous hope,"
said Calantha to herself. 6 Qur actions
are unobserved by any but ourselves ; let
us enjoy what we can whilst we are here;
death only returns us to the dust from
whence we sprung; all hops, all interests,
all occupations, are vain : to forget is the
first great science; and to enjoy, the only
real object of life. What happiness is
there here below, but in love."
So reasoned the unhappy victim of a
false judgment and strong passion. I
was blest; I am so no more. The world
is a wilderness to me; and all that is
in it, vanity and vexation of spirit....

opinionswhilst gazing on the western

turret, and watching the shadows as they
varied on the walls, she again heard the
soft notes of music. It seemed like the
strains of other times, awakening in the
heart remembrances of some former
state long passed and changed. Hope,
love and fond regret, answered alternately
to the call. It was in the season of the
year when the flowers bloomed : it was
on a spot immortalized in ancient story,
for deeds of prowess and of fame. Ca-
lantha turned her eyes upwards and be-
held the blue vault of heaven without
a cloud.
The sea was of that glassy
transparencythat shining brightness,the
air of that serene calm that, had it been
during the winter months, some might
have thought the halcyon was watching
upon her nest, and breathing her soft and
melancholy minstrelsy through the air.
She endeavoured to rouse herself.
She felt as if in a dream, and, hastily
advancing to the spot from whence the
sounds proceeded, she there beheld a

were
youth, for he had not the form or the
look of manhood, leaning against the
trunk of a tree, playing at intervals upon
a flute, or breathing, as if from a suffer-
ing heart, the sweet melody of his un-
taught song. He started not when she
approached :-he neither saw nor heard
herso light was her airy step, so fixed
his
eyes
and thoughts. She gazed
for a moment upon his countenance
and she marked it. It was one of those faces
which, having once beheld, we never
afterwards forget. It seemed as if the
soul of passion had been stamped and
printed upon every feature. The eye
beamed into life as it threw up its dark
ardent gaze, with a look nearly of inspi-
ration, while the proud curl of the upper
lip expressed haughtiness and bitter con-
tempt; yet, even mixed with these fierce
characteristic feelings, an air of melan-
choly and dejection shaded over and
softened every harsher expression. Such

countenance spoke to the heart, and filled
it with one vague yet powerful interest-
so strong, so undefinable, that it could
not easily be overcome.
Calantha felt the power, not then
alone, but evermore. She felt the em-
pire, the charm, the peculiar charm, those
features, that being must have for her.
She could have knelt and prayed to hea-
ven to realize the dream, to bless the
fallen angel in whose presence she at that
moment stood, to give peace to that soul,
upon which was plainly stamped the hea-
venly image of sensibility and genius.
The air he had played was wild and
plaintive: he changed it to one more
harsh. She now distinctly heard the
words he sung
This heart has never stoop'd its pride
To slavish love, or woman's wile;
But, steel'd by war, has oft defy'd
Her craftiest art and brightest smile.
## p. 31 (#347) #############################################
GLENARVON.
31
This mind has trac'd its own career,
Nor follow'd blind, where others trod;
Nor, mov'd by love, or hope or fear,
E'er bent to man, or worshipp'd God.
Then hope not now to touch with love,
Or in its chains a heart to draw,
All eartbly spells have fail'd to move;
And heav'n's whole terrors cannot awe:
A heart, that like some mountain vast,
And cold with never-melting snow,
Sees nought above, nor deigns to cast
A look away on aught below.
An emotion of interest-something she
could not define, even to herself, had im-
pelled Calantha to remain till the song
was ended: a different feeling now
prompted her to retire in haste. She
fled; nor stopped, till she again found
herself opposite the castle gate, where
she had been left by her companions.
While yet dwelling in thought upon
the singular being she had beheld
C4

whilst asking herself what meant this
sudden, this strange emotion, she found
another personage by her side, and recog-
nized, through a new disguise, her
morning's acquaintance, Wailman the
preacher, otherwise called Cowdel O'Kelly.
This recontre gave an immediate turn to
her thoughts, She enquired of him
if he were an inhabitant of Belfont Ab-
bey? "No, madam," he answered, "but
of St. Alvin Priory." She desired him
to inform her whether any one resided
there who sung in the manner she then
described. " Sure, then, I sing myself
in that manner," said the man, " if that's
all; and beside me, there be some who
howl and wail, the like you never heard.
Mayhap it is he you fell in with; if so, it
must have moved you to tears."
" Explain yourself," said Calantha
eagerly. " If he is unhappy, it is the
same I have seen and heard. Tell me
what sorrows have befallen him?" 66 Sor-
rows! why enough too, to plague any

man.
Has he not got the distemper?"
" The distemper!" "Aye, Lady? for did
he not catch it sleeping in our dog-ken-
nel, as he stood petrified there one night,
kilt by the cold? When my Lord found
him, he had not a house to his head then,
it is my belief; but now indeed he's got
one, he's no wiser, having, as I think, no
head to his house." " Och! it would sur-
prise you how he howls and barks, when-
ever the moon shines bright. But here
be those who fell on me at the fair. In
truth I believe they be searching for the
like of you."

CHAPTER IV.
The party from the castle now joined
Calantha. They were in evident discom-
fiture. Their adventures had been ra-
ther less romantic than Lady Avondale's,
and consequently had not given them
such refined pleasure; for while she was
attending to a strain of such enchanting
sweetness, they had been forcibly detained
in an apartment of the priory, unwillingly
listening to very different music.
The housekeeper having led them
through the galleries, the ladies, escorted
by Count Gondimar, Lord Trelawney
and Sir Everard, turned to examine some
of the portraits, fretted cornices and high
casements, till the dame who led the
way, calling to them, shewed them a
large dreary apartment hung with tape-
stry, and requested them to observe the

view from the window. 66 It is here,"
she said,
" in this chamber, that John de
Ruthven drank hot blood from the skull of
his
enemy and died." A loud groan, at
that moment, proceeded from an inner
room. " That must be the ghost,"
said Lord Trelawney. His Lady shrieked.
The dame, terrified at Lady Trelawney's
terror, returned the shriek by a piercing
yell, rushed from the apartment closing
the heavy door in haste, which fastened
with a spring lock, and left the company
not a little disconcerted.
" We are a good number, however,"
cried Frances, taking fast hold of her
Lord, who smiled vacantly upon her.
" We certainly can match the ghost in
point of strength: but it is rather unplea-
sant to be confined here till that old wo-
man recovers her senses. Groans most

fell ; a ghastly paleness overspread his

upon
his

the outside ; and the solemn boy entering,
said to Lady Margaret, "I am come to
tell your honour that our dame being
taken with the qualms and stericks, is no
ways able of shewing you any further
into the Priory." " I trust, however,
that you will immediately shew us out of
it, Sir," said Gondimar. " It not being
her fault, but her extrame weakness,
continued the boy : she desires me to
hope your honours will excuse her."
" We will certainly excuse her ; but,"
added Lady Margaret, "I must insist
upon knowing from her, or from some of
you, the cause of the groans we heard,
and what all those absurd stories of
ghosts can arise from. I shall send an
order for the house to undergo an imme-
diate examination, so you had better tell
all you know."

singular noises than he makes, many's the

Gondimar. " What, you're recovered
from your qualms and stericks, I per-
ceive, though the old dame is so ill with
them ?" " No jesting, Sir Everard. I
must sift this affair to the bottom. Come,

said Lady Trelawney, taking up the
ques-

" there are some who play upon the harp
in the night, and sing so, that the country
people round, say they are spell-bound."
" Oh musha! there be strange things
heard in these here old houses : one must

Count Gondimar and Lady Margaret,
were engaged in deep discourse. " I can
hardly believe it," she said. " It is most

Having reached the front porch, by the
time the boy had gone through his exa-
mination, Lady Margaret perceiving
O'Kelly, sent for him, and tried, vainly,
to make him answer her enquiries more
satisfactorily; which not being able to
accomplish, she set forth to return home,
in an extreme ill humour. Lord Trelaw-
ney rallied her about the ghost. Casting
an angry glance at him, she refused po-
sitively to return home in either of the
carriages ; saying, she was resolved to
walk back across the cliff, the short way.
Some of the gentlemen proposed escort-
ing her; but she haughtily refused them,
and desired permission to be a few mo-
ments left to herself. They, therefore,
re-entered their carriages, and returned
without any further event.

CHAPTER V.
LADY MARGARET walking hastily off,
had arrived near the Convent of St.
Mary, as the last ray of the setting sun
blazed in the west, and threw its golden
light over the horizon. Close to the
convent, is built the chapel where the
young Marquis and all the family of Al-
tamonte are interred. It stands upon a
high barren cliff, separated by a branch
of the sea from the village of Belfont, to
which
any one may pass by means of the
ferry below. . To the north of the cha-
pel, as far as the eye can trace, barren
heaths and moors, and the distant view
of Belfont and St. Alvin Priory, present a
cheerless aspect; while the other side
displays the rich valley of Delaval, its
groves, gardens and lake, with the adja-
cent wood.

GLENARVON,

At this spot Lady Margaret arrived, as
has been said, at sun-set. She thought
she had been alone; but she heard a step
closely following her: she turned round,
and to her extreme surprize, beheld a
man pursung her, and, just at that mo-
ment, on the point of attaining her. His
black brows and eyes were contrasted
with his grizzly hair; his laugh was hol-
low; his dress wild and tawdry. If she
stopped for a moment to take breath, he
stopped at the same time; if she ad-
vanced rapidly, he followed. She heard
his steps behind, till passing near the
convent he paused, rending the air with
his groans, and his clenched fist repeat-
edly stiking his forehead, with all the
appearance of maniac fury, whilst with
his voice he imitated the howling of the
wind.
Terrified, fatigued andoppressed, Lady
Margaret fled into the thickest part of the
wood, and waited till she conceived the
cause of her terror was removed. She soon

perceived, however, that the tall figure be-
hind her was waiting for her reappearance.
She determined to try the swiftness of her
foot, and sought with speed to gain the
ferry:-she durst not look behind-the
heavy steps of her pursuer gained upon
her:-suddenly she felt his hand upon
her shoulder, as, with a shrill voice and
loud laugh, he triumphed at having over-
taken her. She uttered a piercing shriek;
for on turning round she beheld....
His name cannot at present be declared;
yet this may be said: it was terrible to her
to gaze upon that eyeso hollow, so wild,
so fearful was its glance. From the se-
pulchre, the dead appeared to have arisen
to affright her; and, scarce recovering
from the dreadful vision, with a faltering
step, and beating heart, she broke from
that graspthat cold handthat dim-
fixed eye-and gained with difficulty the
hut of the fisherman, who placed her in
safety on the other side of the cliff.
The castle bell had already summoned

the family; dinner awaited; and the
duke having repeatedly enquired for
Lady Margaret, was surprised to hear
that she had returned home alone and
after dusk. The servant, who informed
him of this circumstance, said that her
ladyship appeared extremely faint and
tired; that her women attendants had
heen called; that they apprehended she
was more ill than she would acknowledge.
He was yet speaking, when with a blaze
of beauty and even more than her usual
magnificence of dress, she entered, apo-
logised for the lateness of her appearance,
said the walk was longer than she had
apprehended, and, taking her brother's
arm, led the way into the dining room.
But soon the effort she had made, proved
too great:-her colour changed repeat-
edly; she complained that the noise dis-
tracted her; she scarcely took any part in
the conversation ; and retiring early,
sought a few hour's repose.

whilst the rest of those whose curiosity
had been much excited in the morning,
narrated their adventures and enquired
eagerly concerning Lord Glenarvon's
character and mode of life. At the
mention of his name, the colour rush-
ed into Calantha's face. Was it him-
self she had seen?-She was convinced it
was. That countenance verified all that
she had heard against him: it was a full
contradiction to all that Lady Trelawney
had spoken in his favour; it expressed a
capability of evil-a subtlety that led the
eye of a stranger to distrust; but, with
all, it was not easily forgotten. The ad-
dress to the people of Ireland, which Lady
Avondale had read before with enthu-
siasm, she read now with a new and unde-
finable sensation. She drew also those fea-
tures that countenance; and remember-
ed the air he had sung and the tones of his
-voice. She seemed to dive into the feel-
ings of a heart utterly different from
what she had ever yet observed; a sort of

instinct gave her power at once to pene-
trate into its most secret recesses; nor was
she mistaken. She listened, with eager cu-
riosity, to every anecdote narrated of him
by the country esquires and gentry who
dined at the castle; but she felt not sur-
prised at theinconsistences and absurdities
which she heard repeated. Others discre-
dited what was said: she believed the
worst; yet still the interest she felt was un-
diminished. It is strange; she loved not
she admired not that countenance; yet,
by day, by night, it pursued her. She
could not rest nor employ her mind in her
customary occupations ; yet the fear of
again seeing that countenance, was greater
than the desire of doing so. She felt as
sured that it was Lord Glenarvon:-there
was not a doubt left upon her mind re-
specting this circumstance. Mrs. Sey-
mour saw that Calantha was pre-occu-
pied: she thought that she was acquaint-
ed with the secret which disturbed Lady
Margaret that horrid secret which mad-
dened and destroyed her : for, since her

had been ill.
But it was not till after some days re-
tirement, that she sent for Calantha, and
when she visited her in her own apart-
ment, she found her silent and trembling.
"Where is your boy?" Lady Margaret said.
" He sleeps: would you that I should
bring him you?""I do not mean your son:
I mean that minion--that gaudy thing,
you dress up for your amusement that
fawning insect, Zerbellini." Calantha
shuddered; for she knew that a mother
could not thus speak of her child without
suffering acutely. " Has my pretty Zer-
bellini done any thing to deserve such
unkind words from you? If so, I will
chide him for it. Why do you frown?
Zerbellini haste here: make your obei-
sance to Lady Margaret." The boy ap-
proached: Lady Margaret fixed her eyes
steadily upon him: the colour rushed
into her cheeks, then left her pale, as the
hue of death. "Oim si muoja?" exclaim-

and he leant forward to support her ; but
Lady Margaret moved not.
Many moments passed in entire silence.
At last, starting as if from deep reflection,
"Calantha," she said, "I know your heart
too well to doubt its kindness:--the pre-
sence of this boy, will cause the misery of

you not guess wherefore? I read his feel-

be less quick in penetrating the senti-

perceive that Zerbellini is of the very
age and size-your lost-and-lamented
brother would have been ?....and cer-
tainly not unlike the duchess." She he-
sitated-paused-recovered herself. "I
- would not for the world have you sug-
gest this to a human being. I would not
appear to have saidwhat you, out of
an affectionate regard might-should-
have considered.""I am astonished:
you quite amaze me," replied Calantha :
yet she too well guessed her feelings.

His strong resemblance-his age-his
manner-have given me already the
acutest pain.-My brother will never de-
mand any sacrifice of you ;but I, Lady
Avondale, I solicit it." Shall I be re-
fused?" "Dearest aunt, can you ask this?

from the castle." " Oh no : such pre-

ask will lose its value. Above all, if the

that Zerbellini may be placed with my
little son: but you cannot think how
much you surprise me. My father has
seen the boy so often; has spoken so fre-
quently with him; has appeared so per-

weakness, Calantha: I dreamt last night,

a sudden, robed in the white vestments
of an angel, that boy appeared I saw
his hand closely stealing behind-he had
a dagger in it, and coming towards me-

looks as these: only I have suffered my
heart to wander, child; and I have been

versation, from remembering the secret
Gondimar had communicated, than she
otherwise must have been; but she could
not understand what had given rise to
this paroxysm of despair at this particular
moment. A singular circumstance now
occurred, which occasioned infinite cen-
jecture to all around. Every morning, as
soon as it was light, and every evening
at dusk, a tall old man in a tattered garb,
with a wild and terrible air, seated him-
self in front of the Castle windows,
making the most lamentable groans, and
crying out in an almost unintelligible
voice, "Woe, on woe, to the family of
Altamonte." The Duke was no sooner
apprised of this circumstance, than he
ordered the supposed maniac to be taken
up : but Lady Margaret implored, en-
treated, and even menaced, till she ob-
tained permission from her brother to
give this wretched object his liberty.

for a being who appeared to have no
other view than the persecution and an-
noyance of her whole family, was deemed
strange ; but when they no longer were
molested by the presence of the fanatic,
who had denounced their ruin, they
ceased to converse about him, and soon
the whole affair was forgotten. Calantha
indeed remembered it; but a thousand
new thoughts diverted her attention, and
a stronger interest led her from it.

CHAPTER VI.
The Rector of Belfont had willingly per-
mitted the little Zerbellini to be placed
under his wife's care. The distance from
thence to the Castle was short; and Ca-
lantha had already sent her children
thither for the benefit of sea-bathing. On
returning one day from thence, she called
upon Gerald Mac Allain, who had ab-
sented himself from the castle, ever since
Mr. Buchanan had appeared there. She
found him mournfully employed in look-
ing over some papers and drawings,
which he had removed to his own habi-
tation. Upon seeing Lady Avondale he
arose, and pointed to the drawings,
which she recognized: "Poor Alice," he
said, " these little remembrances tell me
of happier days, and make me sad ; but
when I see you, my Lady, I forget my

sorrows." Linden's cottage was at a
short distance from Gerald Mac Allain's.
Calantha now informed him that she had
met young Linden at the fair, and had
wished to speak to him: but that she did
not immediately remember him, he was
so altered. Gerald said " it was no use
for her to speak to him, or for any one
else, he was so desperate-like;' and,"
added he, "Alice's misconduct has broke
all our hearts : we never meet now as
formerly; we scarce dare look at each
other as we pass."
" Tell me, Gerald," said Calantha,
" since you have spoken to me on this
melancholy subject, what is the general
opinion about Alice? Has Linden no
idea of what has become of her ?-had he
no suspicion, no doubt of her, till the
moment when she fled?"

girl estranged herself from him latterly;

her to go to county Leitrim for Mr.

O'Flarney, during his absence, which
lasted six weeks, he received a letter from
her, expressing her sorrow that she never
could belong to him. Upon his return he
found her utterly changed; and in a few
weeks after, she declined his further visits;
only once again consenting to see him.
It was on the very morning before my
Lady Margaret conveyed her away from
the Castle."
" But did you never suspect that things
were going on ill before?-did Linden
make no attempt to see her at the Doc-
tor's? It seems strange that no measures
should have been taken before it was too
late." " Alas! my dear young Lady, you
do not know how difficult it is to sus-
pect and chide what we love dearly. I
had given up my child into other hands ;
she was removed entirely from my hum-
ble sphere; and whilst I saw her happy,
I could not but think her deserving; and
when she became otherwise, she was mi-
serable, and it was not the moment to

61
shew her any severity. Indeed, indeed,
it was impossible for me to mistrust or
chide one so above me as Alice. As
to young Linden, it turned his mind. I
walked to his father's house, ill as I was,
just to shake hands with him and see him,
as soon as I was told of what had passed.
The old gentleman, Cyril's father could
not speak. The mother wept as soon as
she beheld me; but there was not one
bitter word fell from either, though they
knew it would prove the ruin of the
young man, their son, and perhaps his
death."
" From that time till the present," con-
tinued Gerald, "I seldom see Linden;
he always avoids me.
He altered very
much, and took to hard drinking and bad
company; his mind was a little shaken ;
he grew very slack at his duty; and
listed, we suppose, with that same gang,
which seduced my two poor boys from
their allegiance and duty. He was repri-
manded and punished by his commander;

but it seems without effect, for Mr. Chal-
loner was telling me, only a few days since,
that in the last business there with Squire
Flarney, Linden was taken notice of by
the justice. There's no one can save
him, he seems so determined-like on his
own ruin ; and they say its the cause
why the old father is on his death-bed
at this present. There is no bitterness
of heart like that which comes from thank-
less children. They never find out till it
is too late, how parents loved them :-
but it was not her fault--no-I don't
blame her--(he knit his brow)-10-I
don't blame her. -Mr. Buchanan is no
child of our own house, though he fills
the place of that gracious infant which it
pleased the Lord to take to himself. Mr.
Buchanan is the son of a strange father:
I cannot consider him as one of our
own so arbritrary :--but that's not the
thing."
" Gerald," said Calantha, you are not
sure that Buchanan is the culprit : we

should be cautious in our judgments."
Oh, but I am sure, and I care not to look
on him; and Linden, they say menaces
to revenge on the young lord, my wrongs
and his own ; but his old father begs him
for God's sake to be peaceable. Perhaps,
my Lady, you will look on the poor gen-
tleman : what though'tis a dying man-
you'll be gratified to see him, there is
such a calm upon his countenance."
Must he die ?" Why, he's very pre-
carious-like: but
your
noble husband,
the young Lord Avondale, is very good
to him-he has done all a man and a sol-
dier could do to save him." 56 I too will
call," said Calantha, to hide from Gerald
how much she was affected ; " and, as to
you, I must entreat as a favour, that
you will return to the castle : to-morrow
is Harry's birth-day ; and it will not be
a holiday, my father says, if you are not
as you were wont to be, at the head of
the table with all the tenants."

Conal from a shameful death-that he
did."
" But you forget," said Calantha, smil-
ing, " that by your own account, he was
the first to bring them into danger."
" By my heart, but he's a noble spirit for
all that: and he has my good wishes and
those of many beside." As he spoke, his
eye kindled with enthusiasm. Calantha's
heart beat high : she listened with eager
interest. "He's as generous as our own, "
continued he," and if he lets his followers
take a pig or two from that rogue there,
Squire Flarney, does not he give half he
has to those in distress? If I could ever
meet him face to face, I'd tell him the
same; but we never know when he's.

Abbess, and the convent, and all the nuns,
and went off after him, as mad as the rest.
Och ! you'd bless yourself to see how the
folks crowd about him at the season, but
they're all gone from these parts now, in
hopes of saving Linden I'm told; for you
know, I suppose that he's missing, and if
he's deserted, its said they are sartain to
shoot him on account of the troubles."
"Three times there have been meetingsin
that cleft there," continued Gerald, point-
ing towards the Wizard's Glen : " it was
that was the first undoing of Miss St.
Clare : for they tell me she's all for our
being delivered from our tyrants ; and she
prophecies so, it would do you good to

" But see, here are some of the military
coming."..." That officer is General Ken-
nedy," said Lady Avondale, approaching
towards him: " he is not a tyrant at
least:" as she said this, she bowed to him,
for she knew him well. He often dined
at the castle. He was saying a few words
to her upon common uninteresting topics,
when, a soldier beckoning to him, two
horsemen appeared." He's found, Sir,"
said one: "there is no doubt of his guilt ;
and twenty other names are on the list."
" I trust in God it is not Linden, of whom
you are speaking," said Calantha. Ge-
neral Kennedy made no answer: he only
bowed to her, as if to excuse himself; and
retired.
Calantha observed a vast number of
people assembled on the road, close to
the village. Gerald Mac Allain could
scarcely support himself. She enquired

women, children, parents who spoke:
some wept aloud ; others stood in silent
anguish; many repeated the name of him
in whom they took deepest interest, ask-
ing if he were of the number. Linden's
she heard most frequently. "Ill luck to
the monsters !-ill luck to the men of
blood !" was vociferated the whole way
she went. "This will kill the old man,
said Gerald : " it will be his death : he
has been all night fearing it, ever since
Linden has been missing."
The crowd, seeing Calantha, ap-
proached in all directions. "Oh beg our
king, your father, to save them," said
" Jesus reward you :" and they
knelt and prayed to her. She was too
much affected to answer. Some of the
officers approached her, and advised her
to retire. 66 The crowd will be im-

CHAPTER VII.
CALANTHA returned home with a heavy
heart; and spoke to Lord Avondale and
her father. They both intreated her not
to interfere. The moment indeed was
alarming and eventful; whatever mea-
sures were necessary, it was not for her to
judge; and while enthusiasm in the cause
of liberty beguiled some, it was, she felt
it was, the duty of a woman to try to soften
and conciliate every thing; but as Linden's
fate was peculiarly unfortunate, Lord
Avondale generously interested himself
for him. Had money been able to pur-
chase his release, there was no sum he
would not have offered. They soon
heard however, though with the deepest
regret, that it was a case where mercy
could not be shewn, without apprehend-
ing the most fatal effects from it. Lin-

den and Seaford had together entered
the militia not above three years back.
Linden, an only son, was now in his
twentieth year, and Seaford, was scarce
eighteen. Their example was deemed
the more necessary for the general safety,
as so many in the same regiment had de-
serted upon hearing of their disaffection.
In the month of December last, they had
all taken the treasonable oaths; and their
rash conduct and riotous proceedings had
already more than once rendered them
liable to the severity of the law.
All intercessions were utterly fruitless;
they were tried, found guilty and con-
demned. Linden was so much beloved
by his companions, that several attempts
were made, to rescue him from the
hands of justice; but he disdained to be
so released ; and when he heard of the
tumult his condemnation had excited, he
asked his captain's permission to be
spared the last bitter conflict of walking
through his own native town.
The re-
quest was denied him.
## p. 71 (#387) #############################################
GLENARVON,
On the 18th of May, at the hour of
four, the time appointed to assemble,
twenty-three men, who had taken part
in the riot, were called out. The regi-
ment, after this, slowly advanced in so-
lemn procession through the town, fol-
lowed by the cavalry, and all the horse
artillery. The streets were thronged
the windows were crowded-not a word
was spoken; but the sobs and cries of
friends, parents and oldacquaintance, who
.came out to take a last farewell, were
heard. After passing through Belfont,
they turned to the high road, and conti-
nued the march util they reached the
plains at the foot of Inis Tara, about two
miles from the town.
Linden and Seaford were then brought
forward with a strong escort. They con-
tinued silent and firm to the last. Just
as the pause was made, before the com-
mand was given that they should kneel,
the mother of Linden, supported by Mac
Allain, forced her way through the

crowd, and implored permission to take
a last farewell of her son. The officer
desired that she might pass ; but the
crowd was so great that it was with diffi-
culty she could arrive at the spot:-when
there, she only once shook hands with the
young man, and said she had brought
him his father's blessing :-he made no
answer, but appeared very deeply af-
fected. He had shewn the most de-
liberate courage till that hour. It
now forsook him, and he trembled ex-
cessively.
" Thank God I am spared this," said
his companion: "I have no mother left."
The signal was immediately given to fire;
and the party prepared to do their duty.
A troop of horse at that moment, in the
green uniform of the national guards,
appeared from an ambush, and a despe-
rate struggle ensued. The mutineers set
up a terrible yell during the combat.
The inhabitants, both of the town and
country, joined them in every direction.
## p. 73 (#389) #############################################
GLENARVON,

Lord Avondale and many other officers
present came up to the assistance of Ge-
neral Kennedy's small force, and soon
restored order. The party of horse were
put to flight. The colonel of the regi-
ment immediately ordered a court-mar-
tial; and three prisoners, who were taken,
were with Seaford and Linden, executed
on the spot.
In the skirmish, the young man who
headed the party of horse, and had exposed
himself most eagerly to rescue Linden,
was wounded in the left arm: his person
was described; the circumstance was
mentioned ; and a high reward was of-
fered for his head. It was supposed by
many that he was Lord Glenarvon.
The severity of these proceedings
struck an immediate panic throughout
the disaffected. The inhabitants of the
town of Belfont arrayed themselves in
black. A long and mournful silence
succeeded ; and few there were who per-
ceived through the veil of submissive ac-

quiescence, the spirit of rebellion and
vengeance, which was preparing to burst
forth. Gerald Mac Allain, forgetful of
his wrongs, appeared at the castle ; Lady
St. Clare wrote the most penitent letters to
Sir Everard ; and with her two daughters
Jessica and Laura, entreated permission
to return. Every one of the tradesmen
and farmers, of any respectability, erased
their names from the new club which
had been established opposite to Sir
Everard's house; and a sort of mournful
tranquillity and terror seemed to reign
throughout.
A few days after this melancholy trans-
action, Linden's mother died ; and as
Calantha was returning from Belfont, she
met the crowd who had followed her to
the grave. They all passed her in si-
lence, nor gave her one salutation, or
smile of acknowledgment, as on other
occasions; yet they were her father's
own tenants, and most of their counte-
nances she remembered from childhood.
## p. 75 (#391) #############################################

75
When she mentioned this circumstance
at the castle, she was informed that Lord
Avondale's having taken an active part
against the party, who had come forward
to save the deserters, was the cause of
this, their unusual deportment.
To such height at this time, was the
spirit of party carried that the whole
kingdom, was in a state of ferment and
disorder. Complaints were made, re-
dress was claimed, and the people were
every where mutinous and discontented.
Numerous absentees, it was popularly said
had drawn great part of the money out
of the country; oppressive taxes were
continued ; land was let and sub-let to
agents and stewards to the utter ruin of
the tenants.
Some concessions were now granted
in haste-some assurance of relief given;
but the popular spirit of indignation,
once excited, was not to be allayed by
the same means which had, perhaps,
prevented its first rise. The time for

conciliation was past. A foreign enemy
lost no opportunity of adding to the in-
creasing inward discontent. The friends
of government had the power of the
sword and the weight of influence on
their side ; but the enemies were more
numerous, more desperate, more enthu-
siastic. The institution of political clubs,
the combination of the United Irishmen,
for the purpose of forwarding a brother-
hood of affection, a communion of rights,
amongst those of every different persua-
sion, even the establishment of a military
force was now attempted ; and the con-
stant cry of all the inhabitants of either
town or country was a total repeal of the
penal statutes, the elective franchise, re-
form of parliament, and commutation of
tythes.
Whilst, however, the more moderate
with sincerity imagined, that they were
upholding the cause of liberty and reli-
gion; the more violent who had eman-
cipated their minds from every restraint

of prejudice or principle, did not conceal
that the equalization of property, and the
destruction of rank and titles was their
real object. The revolutionary spirit
was fast spreading, and since the appear-
ance of Lord Glenarvon, at Belfont, the
whole of the county around might be
considered in a state of actual rebellion.

GLENARVON seemed, however, to differ
in practice from his principles; for whilst
many of those who had adopted the same
language had voluntarily thrown off their
titles, and divided their property amongst
their partizans, he made a formal claim
to the titles which his grandfather had
forfeited ; and though he had received
no positive assurance, even that his right
would be recognized, he called himself
by that name alone, and insisted on his
followers addressing him in no other man-

and had only twice visited the abode of
his ancestors until the present year.
It was amidst the ruins of antient ar-
chitecture, and the wild beauties of Ita-
lian scenery, that his splendid genius and
uncommon faculties were first developed.
Melancholy, unsocial, without a guide
he had centered in himself every strong
interest, and every aspiring hope. Dwell-
ing ever in the brilliant regions of fancy,
his soul turned with antipathy from the
ordinary cares of life. He deeply felt the
stigma which had been cast upon his
family in the person of his grandfather,
who, from the favourite of the lawful
prince, had become the secret accomplice
of a bloody conspiracy. The proofs of
his guilt were clear; his death was a
death of shame, and the name of traitor
was handed down with the coronet to
which his only surviving heir so eagerly
aspired.
By his nearest friends he was now

called Glenarvon ; and so jealous did he
appear of his rank, that he preferred dis-
guise, straits and difficulties, to a return
to his own country without those titles,
and that fortune, which he considered
as his due. One object of interest suc-
ceeded another; a life of suspense was
preferred to apathy; and the dark coun-
sels of unprincipled associates, soon led
one, already disloyal in heart, to the very
brink of destruction.
He had embraced his father's profes-
sion, wherein he had distinguished him-
self by his courage and talent; but to
obey another was irksome; and the
length of time which must elapse before
he could obtain the command of a ship,
soon disgusted him with the service.
He quitted it, and returned to Italy-
there amidst the luxurious dissipation of
Rome or Florence, he gave up his days
and nights to every fierce excess; and soon
the high spirit of genius was darkened,

the lofty feelings of honor were debased,
and the frame and character sunk equally
dejected under the fatigue of vigils and
revels, in which reason and virtue had no
share. He had been wronged and he
knew not how to pardon. Many had de-
ceived him and he existed henceforward
but to mislead others. The victim of his
first attachment had fallen a prey to the
revengeful jealousy of an incensed hus-
band; but her death was not more sudden,
more secret, than that of the tyrant who
had destroyed her. Every one knew by
whose hand the fair and lovely Fiorabella
had perished; but no eye bore witness
against the assassin, who, in the depths
of night had immediately revenged her
loss. The murderer and the murdered
were both alike involved in the impene-
trable veil of mystery. The proud and
noble family who had been injured, had
neither the power, nor the inclination
to seek redress. Lord Glenarvon was
seen no more at Florence  he had been

the cause of this tragic scene. It afflicted
his generous heart when he reflected
upon the misery he had occasioned; but
not even his bitterest enemy could have
suspected him of deeper guilt. His
youth was untainted by the suspicion of
crime, and the death of Giardini had,
with greater show of justice been attri-
buted to another, and a more dangerous
hand.
Fascinated with the romantic splendour
of ideal liberty, and intent upon flying
from the tortures of recollection, he had
visited Ireland in the spring of the year
and had remained there some
months, unknown even to his adherents,
who flocked around him, attracted by
his eloquence, and won by his address.
One only victim returned with him in
his voluntary exile from his native land.
One only miserable enthusiast devoted
herself to his fortunes, and accompanied
him in his flight. O'Kelly, the son of
a tenant of his father, recognized his

enemy, nor turned from the sickening
sight--Even the storms of nature could
not move Glenarvon. In the dark night,
when the tempest raged around and the
stormy ocean beat against the high im-
pending cliffs, he would venture forth,
would listen to the roaring thunder with-
out fear, and watch the forked lightening
as it flashed along the sky.
The rushing winds but seemed to sooth
his perturbed spirit; and the calm of his
brow remained unaltered in every chang-
ing scene. Yet it was the calm of hope-
less despair, 'when passion, too violent to
shew itself by common means, concen-
trates itself at once around the heart,
and steels it against every sentiment of
mercy.
Who had dared to enquire of that eye
the meaning of its glance? or who had
trusted to the music of that soft voice,
when it breathed forth vows of tenderness
and love? or who, believing in the light

of life which beamed upon that counte-
nance, had considered the sportive jests
of fancy--the brilliant sallies of that
keen wit as the overflowing testimony of
a heart at rest ? None-none believed
or trusted in Glenarvon. Yet thousands
flocked around and flattered him; amidst
this band of ruffians, this lawless unprin-
cipled gang, the recluse of Glenaathe
lovely, but misguided Elinor was now
too often seen. She was the spirit and
soul of the tumultuous party : her wit en-
livened; her presence countenanced; her
matchless beauty attracted. Scarce in
her sixteenth year, the pride of her fa-
mily, the wonder and ornament of the
whole country, she forsook her solitude
and hopes of heaven-she left the aunt,
who had fostered and cherished her from
childhood, to become avowedly the mis-
tress of Glenarvon. On horse, or on
foot, she accompanied him. In the at-
tire of a boy she unblushingly followed

his steps ! his former favorites were ne-
ver even named, or alluded to his pre-
sent mistress occupied all his attention.
When St. Clara described the suffer-
ings of her country, every heart melted
to compassion, or burned with indigna-
tion ; but when her master, when Gle-
narvon played upon her harp, or sung
the minstrelsy of the bards of other times,
he inspired the passions which he felt,
and inflamed the imagination of his
hearers to deeds of madness-to acts of
the wildest extravagance. Crowds fol-
lowed
upon his teps ; yet it was me-
lancholy to see them pass-0 fair, so
young and yet so utterly hardened and
perverted. Who could behold St. Clara
and not compassionate her fate? What
was to become of her when Glenarvon
had ceased to love ; and did he love?
Never: in the midst of conquests, his
heart was desolate ; in the fond embrace
of mutual affection, he despised the vic-
tim of his art,

GLENARVON.
Of all the friends, flatterers and fot-
lowers, he had gained by his kindness,
and lost by his caprice, not one remained
to fill, in his bosom, that craving void
which he himself had made. Wherever
he appeared, new beauty attracted his
worship, and yielded to his power : yet
he valued not the transient possession,
even whilst smiling upon the credulous
being who had believed in his momen-
tary affection. Even whilst soothing her
with promises and vows, which he meant
not for one hour to perfom, he was seek-
ing the means of extricating himself from
her power-he was planning his escape
from the thraldom of her charms ? Was
he generous ? Aye, and prodigal by na-
ture ; but there was a part of his cha-
racter which ill accorded with the rest :
it was a spirit of malignity which, if ir-
ritated, never rested, till it had satisfied
its vengeance. An enemy, he could have
pardoned and have loved ; but he knew
not how to bear with or forgive a friend.

His actions appeared the immediate re-
sult of impulse ; but his passions were all
subject to his controul, and there was a
systematic consistency even in his most
irregular conduct. To create illusions, and
raise affection in the breasts of others,
has been the delight of many: to dispel
the interest he had created was Glenar-
von's care.
Love he had studied as an
art: he knew it in all its shades and gra-
dations ; for he had traced its progress
in his own and many another breasts. Of
knowledgeand wisdom, he had drank deep
at the fountain head, nor wanted aught
that could give liveliness and variety to
his discourse.
He was, besides, a skilful flatterer, and
knew in what weak part, he best might
apply his power. But the sweetness of
his praise, could only be exceeded by the
bitterness of his contemptthe venomed
lash of his deadly wit.
That in which Glenarvon most prided
himselfthat in which he most excelled,

was the art of dissembling. He could
turn and twine so near the truth, with,
more than Machiavelian subtlety, that
none could readily detect his falsehood ;
and when he appeared most frank and
unguarded, then he most deceived.
Falsehood and craft were stamped upon
his countenance, written upon his brow,
marked in his words, and scarce conceal-
ed beneath the winning smile which oft
times played upon his lips.
" If I could but see him once," said
Lady Augusta, " I should be satisfied ;
but to liear his name from morning till
night-to have every fault, folly, nay
even crime attributed to him by one

nation given him by the other,it is
enough to distract women in general, and
me in particular. Is there no mercy for
curiosity? I feel I shall do something ab-
surd, extremely absurd, if an interview
it not contrived." " Nothing can be

the Duke, laughing. " The malicious af-

his appearance just at present would be

another turn; and Lord Avondale en-
tering, informed Calantha that he had a

diatly join him at Cork.

ADMIRAL BUCHANAN and Sir Richard
Mowbrey had, in the month of January,
returned to England, where they had re-

their distinguished conduct on the me-
morable 1st of June. They were now
appointed to command upon the Cork
station, with a considerable force, as se-
rious apprehensions were entertained
lest the enemy should attempt a descent in
the south of Ireland. The enthusiasm
with which the heroes were greeted on
their return, did honour to the feelings
of the Irish nation. They were invited
to every house in the neighbourhood;
and ftes and balls were given to shew
them respect. The Duke and Lord Avon-
dale went forward to receive them.

ance of theirs who resided at Cork, sent to
offer his house, not only to them, but to the
whole party at Castle Delaval ; if they
determined to accept Sir George's invita-
tion, and dine on board the Royal
Williarn on the 1st of June, in comme-
moration of that day and its success.
There were few, if any, of those invited
who refused ; but none accepted the invi-
tation with so much enthusiasm as Calan-
tha. The letter from Sir George Buchanan
to Lady Margaret was as follows:
Cork, May 28th. 1796.
My dear Lady Margaret,
" In answer to a letter which I received
this morning, dated May 26th, ult., I re-
quest the honour of your Ladyship's com-
pany on board the Royal William, now
in harbour at the Cove. The Duke and.
the rest of his family and party have al-
ready promised me this favour, and I am
not prepared to accept from yourself any
denial on account of those circumstances

to which you allude, and which, I entreat
you sincerely to believe are, on my part,
utterly forgotten. Let me request you,
then, to banish from your memory every
trifling disagreement, and to meet me,
upon an occasion so flattering as is the
present to my feelings and those of our
friends, with the good-will and kindness
you will ever find in the heart of your
Ladyship's most obedient and affec-
tionate brother and servant,
" GEORGE BUCHANAN."

In corsequence of this invitation, Lady
Margaret and the rest of the Duke's
family set out the morning of
the 31st, and arrived about the hour
of dinner at Commodore Emmet's a
large brick building about a quarter of
a mile beyond the town of Cork. The
Duke and Lord Avondale, and their lo-
quacious host, had been awaiting them
some time.
The latter gave to each

the most cordial welcome; boasted that he
could lodge them all; talked incessantly,
as he shewed them to their apartments ;
entreated them not to dress, as dinner
awaited; and left them, assuring them
all, that they were the exact image of the
Duke, whom he concluded to be, like the
Patriarchs of old, the father of the whole
company. His voice murmured on as
he descended the stairs, whilst Cassandra
and Heloise, his daughters, appeared to
offer their services in his place.
The dining-room was small; the
guests were numerous; the table was
crowded with huge pieces of meat: the
Commodore talked incessantly; his chil-
dren, his servants, bis brother, seemed all
gifted alike with the same spirit of acti-
vity: it was incessant bustle, hurry,
noise and contrivance. Music, cards,
and tricks of every kind were displayed
during the evening'; and in the morning,
long before the sun had arisen, carpen-,

ters, mechanics, ship-builders and cooks,
awoke the guests by the noise of their
respective pursuits.
Sir George Buchanan had sent to re-
quest the Duke's company at an early
hour on the morrow. The day proved
fair, the boats were ready, and they set
forth on their expedition in high spirits.
Many shipsandsmaller vessels were spread
over the harbour ; and bands of music
played as they passed. The beauty of
the Cove of Cork, the trees bending to the
water side, the fortress, and the animated
picture which a mercantile city presents,
-delighted all. But feelings of enthu-
siasm kindled in every heart, when they
approached the Royal William, and be-
held its venerable commander. The sea
was rough, and the spray of the waves
was at times blown over the boat. The
Miss Emmets thought of their new
dresses; Sophia of danger; and Calantha
of the glory of thus proudly riding over
the billowy ocean.

Lady Margaret, though silent, was
more deeply agitated :-her mind re-
curred in thought to scenes long past.
She was now to behold, after a lapse of
many years, her husband's brother, whom
she had treated with the most marked in-
dignity, and for whom she had vainly at-
tempted to feel contempt. He had ever
conducted himself towards her with cour-
teous, though distant civility; but had
yet shewn the most decided disapproba-
tion of her conduct. When she had last
beheld him, she was in the full splendour
of youth and beauty, surrounded by an
admiring world, and triumphant in the
possession of every earthly enjoyment.
Time had but little changed the majesty
of her form ; but something worse than
time had stamped upon her countenance
an expression never to be effaced ; while
her marked brow assumed an air of sul-
len pride and haughty reserve, as she as-
cended from the boat into the ship; she
gazed upon the long forgotten features of

her brother; and she seemed to be deeply
affected. Age had bleached his once
dark locks; but he was still unimpaired
in mind and form. He bent lowly down
to receive her: she felt him clasp her to
his bosom; and overcome by this unex-
pected kindness, her tears streamed upon
his hand :-he, too, could have wept; but
recovering himself, with a commanding
air, he came forward to receive his other
guests.
The ship was in the highest order; the
feast prepared was magnificent; and when
the Duke stood up and bowed with grace
to drink the Admiral's health, the sailors
cheered, and the toast was repeated from
the heart by every individual. But he,
though greatly affected and pleased at
the homage shewn him, bowed to the
Duke, returning him the compliment;
and afterwards, drinking the health of Sir
Richard Mowbrey, said, that he owed
every thing to his assistance-that, in
the glorious action of the 1st, his ship

had conferred new honours on the Bri-
tish Navy, and that he had received the
warmest commendations of their great
Commander and famed Admiral Howe!..
At that name, every individual arose.
The name of Howe was repeated from
mouth to mouth with an expression of
exalted admiration; his applauses were
spoken of by every tongue; and many an
eye that had never shewn weakness, till
that moment, filled with tears at the
name of their venerable, their dear com:
mander. Captain Emmet, during this
scene, was employed in eating voraciously
of whatever he could lay hands on. Miss
Emmet, who thought it a great honor to
converse with a lord, had seated herself
by the side of Lord Avondale, narrating
her own adventures, freely stating her
own opinions, and pleased with herself
and every one present; while her father
likewise talked at the other end of the
table, and Admiral Buchanan laughed

heartily, but good humouredly at his
friend's oppressive eloquence.
Suddenly Lord Avondale turned to
Calantha and asked her if she were ill?
She knew not, she could not define the sort
of pain and joy she felt at that moment.
Her
eyes
had long been fixed upon one
who took no part in this convivial scene
-whose pale cheek and brow expressed
much of disappointed hope, or of joyless
indifference. He had that youthful, nay
boyish air, which renders this melan-
choly the more singular. It was not
affected, though his manner had in it
nothing of nature, but the affectation
was rather that of assumed respect for
those he cared not for, and assumed in-
terest in topics to which he hardly at-
tended, than the reverse.
He even af
fected gaiety; but the heart's laugh never
sounded from his lips; and if he uttered
a sentence, his eye seemed to despise the
being who listened with avidity to his
observation. It was the same, -oh! yes,
## p. 103 (#415) ############################################
GLENARVON.
103
it was, indeed, the same, whom Calantha
had one moment beheld at St. Alvin
Priory.
His face, his features, were the same,
it is true, but a deeper shade of sadness
now overspread them; and sorrow and
disappointment had changed the glow of
boyish health to a more pallid hue.
What! in a month ? it will be said.-A
day might, perhaps, have done it. How.
ever, in the present instance, it was not
as if some sudden and defined misfor-
tune had opprest the soul by a single
blow: it was rather as if every early
hope had long been blighted ; and every
aspiring energy had been destroyed.
There was nothing pleasing to gaze
upon : it was mournful; but it excited
nor sympathy, nor confidence.
The
arin was in a slingthe left arm. There
could be no doubt that he was the hero
who had risked his life to save young

von whom Calantha beheld ? Yes, it
was himself. Sir George Buchanan had
long since known, observed, and distin-
guished him in his profession, and the
firm friendship of the seaman, would not
be deterred by any rumours, however
current or however unfavourable, from
paying him that respect, which he knew
to be due not more to his rank, than to his
merit and prowess. Glenarvon had availed
himself of the invitation, and face to face
Calantha now stood before him, and
gazed with eager curiosity upon him.
Never did the hand of the sculptor, in
the full power of his art, produce a form
and face more finely wrought, so full of
soul, so ever-varying in expression. Was
it possible to behold him unmoved ? Oh!
was it in woman's nature to hear him,
and not to cherish every word he uttered?
And, having heard him, was it in the
human heart ever again to forget those
accents, which awakened every interest,
and quieted every apprehension? The

was marked and destined. It was Gle-

of the rattle - snake, it has been said,
once fixed upon its victim, overpowers
it with terror and alarm : the bird, thus
charmed, dares not attempt its escape; it
sings its last sweet lay; flutters its little
pinions in the air ; then falls prone be-
fore its destroyer, unable to fly from
his fascination. Calantha bowed, there-
fore with the rest, pierced to the heart at
once by the maddening power that de-
stroys alike the high and low; but she
liked not the wily turn of his eye, the
contemptuous sneer of his curling lip,
the soft passionless tones of his voice -
it was not nature, or if it were nature, not

that to which she had been accustomed;
-not the open, artless expression of a
guileless heart.
Starting from the kind of dream, in
which she had for, one moment been
wrapped, she now looked around her,
and with a sudden affectation, to which
she had hitherto been a stranger, assumed
a new manner, in order to conceal the in-
terest which she felt, and which she feared
she was betraying.
Lord Glenarvon was the real object of
her thoughts, yet she appeared alone to
be occupied with every other. She
laughed with Lord Trelawney; talked to
the Miss Emmets; examined with in-
terest every part of the ship, carelessly
approaching the very edge of it; yet once
she met that glance, which none ever,
who had seen, could forget, and she
stopped as if rivetted to the earth.-He
smiled; but whether it was a smile of
approbation, or of scorn, she could not
discover: the upper lip was curled, as

if in derision; but the hand that was
stretched out to save her, as she stood on
the brink of the vessel, and the soft
silvery voice which gently admonished
her to beware, lest one false step should
plunge her headlong into the gulph be-
low, soon re-assured her. ;
It was late before the Duke took leave
of the admiral, who promised to breakfast
with the Commodore the ensuing day.
The
guns once more were fired; the band
played as for their arrival; but the music
now seemed to breathe a sadder strain;
for it was heard softened by distance, and
every stroke of the oars rendered the
sounds more and more imperfect. The
sun was setting, and cast its lustre on the
still waves: even the loquacity of the
Emmets was for a few moments sus-
pended; it was a moment which im-
pressed the heart with awe; it was a
scene never to be forgotten. The splen-
dour of conquest, the tumult of enthu-
siasm, the aged veteran, and more than

all, perhaps, that being who seemed early
wrecked in the full tide of misfortune,
were all fixed indelibly in Calantha's me-
mory. Future times might bring new
interests and events; magnificence might
display every wonderful variety ; but the
impression of that hour never can be
effaced.

CHAPTER XI.
CALANTHA could not speak one word
during the evening ; but while Miss
Emmets sungindifferently, she listened
and even wept at what never before had
excited or interest, or melancholy. At
night, when in sleep, one image pursued
her,-it was all lovelyall bright: it
seemed to be clothed in the white gar-
ments of an angel ; it was too resplendent
for eyes to gaze on :-she awoke. Lord
Avondale slept in the inner room ; she
arose and looked upon him, whilst he
reposed. How long, how fondly she had
loved those features that form. What
grace, what majesty, what beauty was
there! But when those eyes awake, she
said, they will not look for me. That
heart is at peace, and thou canst sleep,
Henry, and my sorrows are not known

or heeded by thee. Happy Avondale:-
Miserable, guilty Calantha ! when the
mind once cherishes a discontented
spirit, every event that occurs tends to
strengthen it in the delusion it loves to
indulge. Calantha only thought herself
neglected. To her perverted eyes every
thing appeared in a false light. Thus she
accused Lord Avondale when in fact she
herself was alone to blame.
At an early hour the ensuing day,
Captain Emmet proposed a drive to
Donallan Park, which he said was a fair
domain, fully deserving the attention of
the Duke of Altamonte. Cassandra and
Eloise clamorously seconded this
pro-
posal. In this energetic family, Mrs.
Emmet alone gave the eye and the ear a
little repose. Stretched upon a couch in
languid, listless inactivity, she gazed upon
the bustling scene before her, as if en-
tirely unconnected with it: nor seemed
to know of greater suffering than when
roused from her reveries, by the acute

111
voices of her family, to the bustle and
hurry of common life. To the question
of whether she would accompany them
to Donallan Park, she answered faintly,
that she would not go.
A fat and
friendly lieutenant, who fondly hung
over her, urged her to relent, and
with some difficulty, at length, persuaded
her.
Every one appeared much pleased
with their excursion, or possibly with
some incident during their drive, which
had made any excursion agreeable. Of
Donallan Park, however, Calantha re-
membered little : this alone, she noted,
that as they walked through a shrubbery,
Lord Glenarvon suddenly disengaging
himself from Miss Emmet, who had seiz-
ed upon his arm, gathered a rosethe
only rose in bloom (it being early in the
summer) and turning back, offered it to
Calantha. She felt confused-flattered
perhaps; but if she were flattered by his
giving it to her, she had reason to be

112
GLENARVON.
mortified by the remark which accom-
panied the gift. "I offer it to you," he
said, "because the rose at this season is
rare, and all that is new or rare has for
a moment, I believe, some value in your
estimation." She understood his mean-
ing : her eye had been fixed upon him
with more than common interest; and
all that others said and Miss Emmet af-
fected, he thought, perhaps, that she
could feel. There was no proof she gave
of this, more unequivocal, than her si-
lence. Her spirits were gone ; a strange
fear of offending had come upon her ;
and when Lady Trelawney rallied her
for this change, "I am not well," she
said; "I wish I had never come to
Cork."
On the ensuing morning, they returned
to Castle Delaval. Previous to their
departure, Admiral Buchanan had a long
interview with Lady Margaret, during
which time Lord Glenarvon walked along
the beach with Calantha and Sophia.
## p. 113 (#425) ############################################

" Shall you be at Belfont again this
year?" said Miss Seymour. " I shall be
at Castle Delaval in a few days," he an-
swered, smiling rather archly at Calantha,
she knew not wherefore. But she turned
coldly from him, as if fearing to meet
his eyes. Yet not so was it her custom
to behave towards those whom she
sought to please, and what woman upon
earth exists, who had not wished to
please Glenarvon ? Possibly she felt of-
fended at what he had said when giving
her the rose in Donallan garden; or
it may be that her mind, hitherto so en-
thusiastic, so readily attracted, was grown
callous and indifferent, and felt not those
charms and the splendour of those talents
which dazzled and misled every other
heart.
Yet to fly, to feel embarrassed, to
scarcely dare to look
upon
the
person
who addresses us? Are these such very
marked signs of indifference? It is not
probable that Lord Glenarvon thought

!
so. He appeared not to hate the being
who was thus confused in his presence,
but to think that he felt what he in-
spired were presumption. With all the
wild eagerness of enthusiasm, her infa-
tuated spirit felt what, with all the art
of well dissembled vanity, he feigned.
She quitted him with a strong feeling of
interest. She, however, first heard him
accept her father's invitation, and agree
to accompany Sir George Buchanan in his
promised visit to Castle Delaval.

CHAPTER XII.
On their return thither, they found the
guests they had left in a lamentable state
of dullness. Lord Glenarvon was the .
first subject of enquiry. Is he arrived?
-have you seen him ?- do you like
him? - were repeated on all sides.
" Who?-who?" 66 There can be but
one-Lord Glenarvon !" " We all like
him quite sufficiently, be assured of that,"
said Sophia, glancing her eye somewhat
sarcastically upon Calantha.
6. He is a
very strange personage," said Lady
Margaret. My curiosity to see him
had been highly excited: I am now per-
fectly satisfied. He certainly has a slight
resemblance to his mother." " He has
the same winning smile," said Gondimar;
" but there all comparison ceases."
" What says my Calantha?" said Lady

"
Mandeville, " does her silence denote
praise ?" "Oh! the greatest," she re-
plied in haste, " I hope, my dear girls,"
said Mrs. Seymour, rather seriously ad-
dressing her daughters, " that you will
neither of you form any very marked
intimacy with a person of so singular a
character as is this young lord. I was
rather sorry when, by your letter, I
found he was invited here." "Oh, there
is no need of caution for us !" replied
Lady Trelawny, laughing: perhaps
others may need these counsels, but not
we: we are safe enough ; are we not,
Sophia?"
Lord Glenarvon, the object of discus-
sion, soon appeared at the castle, to si-
lence both praise and censure.
There
was a studied courtesy in his manner-
a proud humility, mingled with a certain
cold reserve, which amazed and repressed
the enthusiasm his youth and misfor-
tunes had excited. The end was as usual:
all were immediately won by this un-

117
expected demeanour:-some more, some
less, and Mrs. Seymour the last. But, to
Calantha's infinite amusement, she heard
her speaking in his defence a few hours
after his arrival ; and the person she ad-
dressed, upon this occasion, was Sir Eve-
rard St. Clare, who vehemently asse-
verated, though only in a whisper, that
the Duke must be mad to permit such a
person to remain at the castle in times
like the present.
Sir Everard then stated, that Lady
St. Clare and her daughters were re-
turned to Belfont, and so eager to be
again received into society, that if they
dared hope that any of the Duke's family
would accept their invitation, they in-
tended to give a concert on the night of
the great illumination for the Admiral's
arrival at Belfont. Mrs. Seymour smiled
in scorn; but Lady Margaret kindly pro-
mised to go; and as soon as Mrs.
Seymour heard that it was merely in a
political light they were to counte-

nance them, she was satisfied. For the
present terror of all those who upheld the
government, was lest the rebels should
prove superior, and murder them for
their opinions
It is unnecessary to relate what Lord
Glenarvon said to Calantha very shortly
after his arrival at the castle; it was
made up of a thousand nothings; yet
they were so different from what others
had said: they shewed her so marked
a preference; at least they seemed to do
so; but it was not a preference that
could alarm the most wary, or offend the
most scrupulous. Such as it was, however,
it flattered and it pleased ; it gave a new
interest to life, and obliterated from
her memory every long cherished feeling
of bitterness or regret.
It chanced one day, that, when seated
at dinner, by Mrs. Seymour, to whom he
paid no little attention, he enquired of
her concerning Mac Allain, who waited
upon that occasion behind the Duke's
## p. 119 (#431) ############################################
GLENARVON,
119
chair. Why looks he so miserable?"
he said. "Why turn his eyes so inces-
santly towards Mr. Buchanan?" Mrs.
Seymour hesitated, as if fearing to allude
to a transaction which she never thought
of without horror and dislike; but she
no sooner pronounced the name of Mac
Allain, than Lord Glenarvon's counte-
nance altered: he started! and, watching
Buchanan with a look of loathing anti-
pathy, exhibited such a variety of male-
volent passions, in the space of a few
moments, that Sophia, who sat near Ca-
lantha on the opposite side of the table,
asked her, as she read countenances so
well, to tell her what her new friend's
expressed at that instant ? She raised
her eyes ; but met Glenarvon's. He saw
he was the object of attention: he
smiled ; and the sweetness of that smile
alone being considered: " I know not,"
she said, in some confusion; " but this
I believe, that the hand of Heaven never
impressed on man a countenance so

beautiful, so glorious !" " alantha!" said
Sophia, looking at her. Calantha sighed.
" What is it even so ? Heaven defend
us!" somewhat confused Calantha turn-
ed to the Count Gondimar; and, talk-
ing with affected spirits, soon appeared
to have forgotten both the smile and the
sigh.
" You once, when in London, gave
me permission to warn you," said the
Count, who observed every thing that
was passing, " when I thought you in
danger. Now," continued he," now
is the moment. It was not when
dancing with Mr. Clarendon, or playing
the coquette with Buchanan and the
Duke of Myrtlegrove, that I trembled
for you. Lord Avondale was still dear,
even in those daysbut now0! the in-
constancy of the human heart. You, even
you, are changed." " Not 1," she re-
plied ; 66 but alas ! that time is arrived
which you predicted : he cares no more
for me; but I can never forget him.

ALENARVON.
121
See," she continued, " how utterly, in-
different he appears; yet I would die for
him. " That will be of little service:
you will prove his ruin and misery. Mark
my words, Lady Avondale ; and, when
too late, remember what I have dared to
say."
" Every woman complains," she con-
tinued, smiling, " therefore, let me prove
an exception. I have no reproaches to
make Lord Avondale ; and, except in your
suspicious mind, there is no evil to ap-
prehend." "Tell me, candidly ; if the
trial were made, if the hour of tempta-
tion were to come, could you, do you
think-could
you have strength and
courage to resist it?"
Could I! Can
you
ask ! It will not be accounted pre-
sumption to affirm, that I feel secure.
But possibly this arises from my convic-
tion, that there can be no temptation for
me: I love my husband ; there is no
merit then in being true to what we
love."

As she yet spoke, Zerbellini approached
and asked her, in Italian, to read a note
Lord Glenarvon had sent her. It was
written with a pencil, and contained but
few words :: it requested her to speak no
more with the Count Gondimar. He saw
the manner in which the paper was de-
livered, and guessed from whom it came.
" I told you so," he cried.
66 Alas!
shall I affect to offer you advice, when
so many nearer and dearer friends are
silent--shall I pretend to greater wisdom,
-greater penetration ? Is it not inordi-
nate vanity to hope, that any thing I can
suggest will be of use ?"
" Speak,"
said Calantha ; for the subject was inte-
resting to her ; " at all events I shall not
be offended." " The serpent that is che-
rished in the bosom," said Gondimar,
fiercely, "will bite with deadly venom-
the flame that brightly dazzes the little
wanton butterfly, will destroy it. The
heart of a libertine is iron: it softens when
heated with the fires of passion, but

123
it is cold and hard in itself. As whirl-
winds they are strong and irresisti-
hle ; but when they subside, the calm of
insensibility will succeed. Remember
the friend of thy youth ; though he
appear unkind, his seeming neglect is
better worth than the vows and adulation
of all beside. Oh! Lady Avondale, let
one that is lovely, and blest as you are,
continue pure even in thought."
Calantha looked up, and met Gondi-
mar's eyes: the fire in them convinced
her that love alone dictated this sage
advice'; and none ever can conceive how
much that feeling had been encreased
by thus seeing a rival before him, whom
he could not hope to render odious" or
ridiculous.
On the following day Lord Glenarvon
took his leave. The Duke appeared de-
sirous of conciliating bim ; Lady Marga-
ret was more even than usually brilliant
and agreeable;  Mrs. Seymour relaxed
something of her frigidity ; and the rest

of the ladies were enthusiastic in their
approbation.
From that time Calantha spokemuch and
often apart with Gondimar. Every thought
of her heart seemed concentrated on the
sudden in one dark interest; yet it was not
love that she felt: it could not be. By day,
by night, one image pursued her : yet
to save, to reclaim, to lead back from
crime to virtue from misery to peace,
was, as she then apprehended, her sole
hope and view. Were not all around
alike infatuated ? Was not the idol of
her fancy a being to whom all alike paid
the incense of flatterythe most lowly,
the most abject ?
"Let them pursue," she cried : "Jet
them follow after and be favoured in
turn. I alone, self-exiled, will fly, will
hide myself beneath every concealment.
He shall hear their words and believe
in their adulation ; but never, whilst
existence is allowed me, shall he know
the interest with which he has inspired

me. Resolved upon this, and dreading
her own thoughts, she danced, she rode,
she sang, she talked to every one, sought
every amusement, and seemed alone to
dread one instant of repose-one single
moment of time devoted to self-examina-
tion and reflection,
Ceaseless hurry,
joyless mirth, endless desire of amuse-
ment varied the days as they fitted by,
"Oh, pause to reflect !" said Gondimar.
But it was vain : new scenes of interest
succeeded each other : till suddenly she
started as if already in the dark labyrinth
of sin, and shuddering on the very edge
of the bottomless chasm, which opened
before her feet.

CHAPTER XIII.
LORD GLENARVON was now a favoured
guest at the castle. He came, he went,
as it suited his convenience or his hu-
mour.But every time he came, the se-
cret interest he had excited was strength-
ened ; and every time he went, he left
apparently deeper marks of regret.
Sir Richard Mowbrey and Sir George
Buchanan were at this time also at the
castle. Sir Everard, forgetful of his
wrongs, and his Lady of her projects for
the emancipation of her countrymen,
kept open house during their stay ;
Lady St. Clare, in pursuance of her
plan of restoring herself to society, as-
sisted with her daughters, at a concert
in the great assembly-rooms at Belfont,
given in honour of the Admiral's arrival,
## p. 127 (#439) ############################################

127
On the eventful evening, the whole party
at the castle resolved to make a most
wonderful clat, by their brilliant appear-
ance and popular condescension. The
Duke addressed himself to every indivi-
dual with his accustomed affability. Lord
Avondale attended upon his uncle, who
amused himself by walking up and down
that part of the room which was pre-
pared for the dancers, bowing to all,
shaking hands with all, and receiving
those compliments which his brave con-
duct deserved. Pale, trembling, and
scarcely heeding the scene, Calantha
watched with breathless anxiety for one
atone; and that one, for what cause she
knew not, spoke not to her.
Where is he?"-" Which is lie?"
Was whispered now from mouth to
mouth, The Admiral, the Duke, the
concert were forgotten. One object
appeared suddenly to engage the most
boundless curiosity. " Is that really Lord
Glenarvon?" said a pretty little woman
G 4.'

GLENARVON,
pushing her way towards him.
Oh
let me but have the happiness of speaking
one word to him :let me but say, when
I return to my home, that I have seen
him, and I shall be overjoyed." Calantha
made, room for the enthusiastic Lady:
-she approached-she offered her hand
to the deliverer of his Country as she
called him. He accepted it with grace,
but some embarrassment. The rush was
then general: every one would see-would
speak to their Lordtheir King; and
the fashionable reserve which affectation
had, for a moment, taught the good peo-
ple of Belfont to assume, soon vanished,
when nature spoke in their bosoms: so
that had not the performers of the grand
concerto called to order, Lord Glenarvon
had been absolutely obliged to make his
retreat. The mystery in which his fate
appeared involved, his youth, his misfor-
tunes, his brave conduct, and perhaps
even his errors awakened this interest
in such as beheld him. But he turned

form the gaze of strangers with bitter-
ness.
Will
you allow me to seat myself near
you ?" he said, approaching Calantha's
chair. " Can you ask?"
6 Without
asking, I would not. You may possibly
stay till late : I shall go early. My only
inducement in coming here was you."
" Oh! do not say, what I am well
assured is not true.' "I never say what
I do not feel. Your presence here alone

noise, display. If you dancethat is,
when you dance, I shall retire."
The concert now began with frequent
bursts of applause. Suddenly a general
murmur proclaimed some new and unex-
pected event: a young performer ap-
peared. Was it a boy! Such grace-such
beauty, soon betrayed her: it was Miss St.
Clare. She could not hope for admittance
in her own character ; yet, underafeigned
name, she had promised to assist at the
performance; and the known popularity

of her songs, and the superior sweetness
of her voice, prevented the professors
from enquiring too much into the pro-
priety of such an arrangement
Messieurs John Maclane and Creigh-
ton had just been singing, in Italian, an
opera buffa. The noise they had made
was such, that even the most courteous
had been much discountenanced. A mo-
ment's pause ensued; when, without
one blush of diffidence, but, on the con-
trary, with an air of dauntless and even
contemptuous effrontery, the youthful
performer seized her harpGlenarvon's

she gave vent to the emotions of her own

many another.
The words were evi-

from the heart. She studied not the com-
position, but the air was popular, and for
that reason it had effect.

if to lose all that love thee, should e'er be thy lot,
By the world, that now courts thee, contemnd or forgot;
When thy ow fickle heart has all others estranged,
Then remember St. Clara, who never bad changed.
Who had followed thy steps, though in sickness and sadness,
More firm to the last than the foes who upbraid her;
Who had followed thy steps, though to death and to madness,
Then mourn o'er the grave where thy falsehood bas laid her.
Ah, say not! Ah, think not! she e'er can recover,
The blow never fails from the hand of a lover ;
Full home it was struck, and it fell on a breast
By remorse and unkindness already deprest.
A smile oft, in death, may illumine each feature,
When hope, fondly cherished, for ever is past;
And the heart that is poble and high in its nature,
Though deserted and scorn, will be firm to the last.

:
The admiration for the young enthu-
siast was checked by the extreme disgust
ber shameless ill conduct had occasioned.
The tears, too, of Sir Everard, who was
present, and audibly called upon his cruel
ungrateful niece, excited a strong feeling
of sympathy and indignation. She re-
tired the moment she had ended her
song, and the commotion her presence
had excited subsided with her de-
parture.
The heiress of Delaval, decked in
splendid jewels, had not lost, by compa-
rison, with the deserted Elinor. She was
the reigning favourite of the moment:
every one observed it, and smiled upon
her the more on that account. To be the
favourite of the favoured was too much.
The adulation paid to her during the
evening, and the caresses lavished upon
her had possibly turned a wiser head than
her's ; but alas ! a deeper interest em-
ployed her thoughts, and Glenarvon's
attention was her sole object.

Calantha had felt agitated and serious
during Miss St. Clare's performance.
Lord Glenarvon had conversed with his
customary ease ; yet something had
wounded her. Perhaps she saw, in the
gaze of strangers, that this extreme and
sudden intimacy was observed; or pos-
sibly her heart reproached her. She felt
that not vanity alone, nor even enthusi-
asm, was the cause of her present emo-
tion. She knew not, nor could define
the motive; but, with seeming inconsis
tency, after refusing positively to dance,
she sent for Buchanan and joined in
that amusement; and, as if the de-
sire of exercise had susperseded every
other, she danced on with an energy
and perseverance, which excited the
warmest approbation in all.
" What
spirits Lady- Avondale has !" said one.
" How charming she is !" cried another.
She herself only sighed.
" Have you ever read a tragedy of
Ford's ?" whispered Lady Augusta to Ca-

lantha, as soon as she had ceased to exhi-
bit" a tragedy entitled The Broken
Heart." "No," she replied, half vexed,
half offended. " At this moment you put
me vastly in mind of it. You look most
woefully. Come, tell me truly, is not
your heart in torture ? and, like your
namesake Calantha, while lightly dano
ing the gayest in the ring, has not the
shaft already been struck, and shall you
not die ere you attain the goal?" She
indeed felt nearly ready to do so; and
fanning herself excessively, declared, that
it was dreadfully hot--that she should
absolutely expire of the heat : yet while
talking and laughing with those who
surrounded her, her eye looked cau-
tiously round, eager to behold the re-
sentment and expected frowns of him
whom she had sought to offend; but
there was no frown on Lord Glenarvon's
brow-no look of resentment.
" And are you happy ?" he said, ap-
proaching her with gentleness.  Per.

haps so, since some can rejoice in the
sufferings of others.
Yet I forgive you,
because I know you are not yourself. I
see you are acting from pique : but you
have no cause ; for did you know my
heart, and could you feel what it suffers
on your account, your doubts would give
way to far more alarming suspicions.
He paused, for she turned abruptly from
him. "Dance on then, Lady Avondale,"
he continued, " the admiration of those
for whose society you were formed the
easy prey of every coxcomb to whom that
ready hand is so continually offered, and
which I have never once dared to ap-
proach. Such is the respect which will
ever be shewn to the object of real-admi-
ration, interest and regard, although that
object seems willing to forget that it is
her due. But," added he, assuming that
air of gaiety he had one moment laid
aside, "I detain you, do I not? See Co-
lonel Donallan and the Italian Count
await you." : You mistake me," she said

gravely; "I could not presume to imagine
that my dancing would be beeded by you:
I could have no motive." " None but the
dear delight of tormenting," he replied,
" which gave a surprising elasticity to
your step, I can assure you. Indubitably
had not that impulse assisted, you could
not thus have excelled yourself." "If you
knew," she said, "what I suffer at this
moinent you would spare me. Why do
you deride me?"
" Because, oh Lady
Avondale, I dare not-I cannot speak to
you more seriously. I feel that I have no
right-no claim on you. I dread offend-
ing; but to-morrow I shall expiate all ;
for I leave you to-morrow.-Yes, it must
be so. I am going from Ireland. Indeed
I was going before I had the misery of
believing that I should leave anything in
it I could ever regret." What Calantha felt
when he said this, cannot be described.
"Will you dance the two next dances
with me?" said Colonel Donallan, now
approaching. "I am tired: will you ex-

cuse me? I believe our carriages are or-
dered." "Oh, surely you will not go away
before supper.": " Ask Lady Mandeville
what she means to do." " Lady Tre-
lawney and Miss Seymour stay." " Then,
perhaps I shall." The Colonel bowed
and retired." Give me the rose you
wear," said Glenarvon in a low voice,
" in return for the one I presented you at
Donallan Park." 66 Must I ?".66 You
must," he said, smiling. With some
hesitation, she obeyed ; yet she looked
around in hopes no vigilant eye might ob-
serve her. She took it from her bosom, and
gaveit tremblingly into his hands. Alarge
pier glass reflected the scene to the whole
company. The rose thus given, was re-
ceived with transport. It said more, thus
offered, than a thousand words :-it was
taken and pressed to a lover's lips, till all
its blushing beauties were gone, then it
was cast down on the earth to be tram-
pled upon by many. And had Calantha
wished it, she might have read in the

history of the flower, the fate that ever
attends on guilty love.
And was it love she felt so soon --S
strongly !--It is not possible. Alarmed,
grieved, flattered at his altered manner,
she turned aside to conceal the violent,
the undefinable emotions, to which she
had become a prey :-a dream of ecstasy
for one moment fluttered in her heart;
but the recollection of Lord Avondale
recurring, she started with horror from
herself from him; and, abruptly taking
leaye, retired.
"Are you going?" said Glenarvon.
6 I am ill," she answered." Will you
suffer me to accompany you ?" he said,
as he assisted her into her carriage; "or
possibly it is not the custom in this cout-
try: you mistrust me--you think it
wrong
"No," she answered with em-
barrassment; and he seated himself by
her side. The distance to the castle was
short. Lord Glenarvon was more re-
spectful, more reserved, more silent than

before he had entered the carriage. On
quitting it only he pressed her hand to
his heart, and bade her feel for the agony
she had implanted there. None perhaps,
ever before felt what she did at this
instant......

IF
any indifferent person approach us, it
either is disagreeable, or at least unim-
portant; but when it is a person we love,
it thrills through the heart, and we are
unable to speak or to think. Could she
have imagined that Lord Glenarvon felt
for her, she had been lost. But that was
imposible; and yet his manner;it was
so marked, there could be no doubt. She
was inexperienced, we may add, inno-
cent; though sufficiently prepared to
become every thing that was the re-
Yet in a moment she felt her
own danger, and resolved to guard
against it. How then can so many affirm,
when they know that they are loved, that
it is a mere harmless friendship! how can
they, in palliation of their errors, bring
forward the perpetually repeated excuse

141
that they were beguiled! The heart that
is chaste and pure will shrink the soonest
from the very feeling that would pollute
it:in vain it would attempt to deceive
itself: the very moment we love, or are
loved, something within us points out the
danger:-even when we fly from him, to
whom we could attach ourselves, we feel
a certain embarrassment-an emotion,
which is not to be mistaken; and, in a
lover's looks, are there not a thousand
assurances and confessions which no de-
nial of words can for a moment disguise?
Lord Glenarvon had denied to Calantha
the possibility of his ever again feeling at-
tachment. This had not deceived her;
but she was herself too deeply and sud-
denly struck to the heart to venture to
hope for a return. Besides, she did not
think of this as possible:-he seemed to
her so far above her-so far above every
thing. She considered him as entirely
different from all others; and, if not su,

perior, at least dissimilar and consequently
not to be judged by the same crite-
rion.
It is difficult to explain Calantha's pe-
culiar situation with respect to Lord Avon,
dale. Yet it is necessary briefly to state
in what manner they were situated at this
particular period. They were dearer to
each other perhaps, than any two who
had been so long united, in marriage.
They loved each other with more passion,
more enthusiasm than is often retained;
but they were, from a thousand circum-
stances, utterly estranged at this time;
and that apparently by mutual consent-
like two violent spirits which had fretted
and chafed and opposed each other, till
both were sore and irritated.
In the course of years, they had said
every thing that was most galling and
bitter; and though the ardent attachment
they really felt, had ever followed those
momentary bursts of fury, the veil had

GLENARVON..
143
been torn asidethat courtesy, which
none should ever suffer themselves to for-
get, had been broken through, and they
had yielded too frequently to the sudden
impulse of passion, ever to feel secure that
the ensuing moinent might not produce a
scene of discord.
Calmness and deliberation had van-
quished Calantha; violence could not.
When provoked, Lord Avondale was
too severe; and when he saw her mi-
serable and oppressed, it gave him more
suffering than if he had himself been
subdued. There are few spirits which
cannot be overcome if dexterously at-
tacked; but with the fierce and daring,
force will generally be found useless.
It should be remembered that, like mad.
ness, these distorted characters see not
things as they are; and, like martyrs
and fanatics, they attach a degree of glory
to every privation and punishment in the
noble cause of opposition to what they

ness.
conceive is unjust authority. Such a
character is open and guileless; but
unhappily, the very circumstance that
makes it sincere, renders it also, if it
turn from the right course, desperate and
hardened. Hypocricyand falsehood, how-
ever disgusting, are perhaps less dange-
rous symptoms than that fearless open-
The former at least proves a sense
of shame, and whilst this exists all virtue
is not extinct.
During the first years of their mar-
riage, these tumultuous scenes but
strengthened the attachment they felt
for each other; but when Lord Avon-
dale's profession absorbed his mind, he
dreaded a recurrence of those quarrels
and reconciliations which had once so
entirely engrossed his thoughts. He left
Calantha, therefore, to the guidance of
that will, which she had so long and per-
tinaciously indulged. Absent, pre-OC-
cupied, he saw not, he heard not, the

145
misuse she made of her entire liberty.
Some trifle, perhaps, at times, reached his
ear; a scene of discord ensued; much bit-
terness on both sides followed: and the
conviction that they no longer loved each
other, added considerably to the violence
of recrimination. They knew not how
deeply rooted affection such as they had
once felt, must ever behow the very
ties that compelled them to belong to
each other, strengthened, in fact, the
attachment which inclination and love
had first inspired; but, with all the
petulance and violence of character
natural to each, they fled estranged
and offended from each other's so-
ciety.
Lord Avondale sought, in an active
and manly profession, for some newer
interest, in which every feeling of am-
bition could have part; and she, sur-
rendering her soul to the illusive dream
of mad and guilty attachment,

boasted that she had found again
the happines she had lost; and con-
trasted the indifference of her husband
with the ardour, the devotion, the re-
fined attention of a newly acquired
friend.

CHAPTER XV.
O BETTER had it been to die than to see
and hear Glenarvon. When he smiled,
it was like the light of heaven; and when
he spoke, his voice was more soothing
in its sweetness than music. He was
so gentle in his manners, that it was in
vain even to affect to be offended ; and,
though he said he never again could love,
he would describe how some had died,
and others maddened, under the power
of that fierce passion-how every tie that
binds us, and every principle and law,
must be broken through, as secondary
considerations, by its victims: he would
speak home to the heart; for he knew it in
all its turnings and windings; and, at his
will, he could rouse or tame the varying
passions of those over whom he sought to
exercise dominion. Yet, when by every

art and talent he had raised the flames
of love, tearing himself from his victim,
he would leave her, and then weep for
the agony of grief by which he saw her
destroyed.
Had he betrayed in his manner to Ca-
lantha that freedom, that familiarity so
offensive in men, but yet so frequent
amongst them, she would yet have shud-
dered. But what was she to fly? Not
from the gross adulation, or the easy flip-
pant protestations to which all women are
soon or late accustomed: but from a res-
pect, at once refined and flattering-an
attention devoted even to her least wishes,
yet without appearing subservient - a
gentleness and sweetness, as rare as they
were fascinating ; and these combined
with all the powers of imagination,
vigour of intellect, and brilliancy of wit,
which none ever before possessed in 80
iminent a degree ; and none ever since
have even presumed to rival. Could she
fly from a being unlike all others

sought for by every one, yet, by his own
confession, wholly and entirely devoted
to herself.
How cold compared with Glenarvon,
was the regard her family and friends af-
fected! Was it confidence in her honour,
or indifference? Lord Glenarvon asked
Calantha repeatedly, which it most re-
sembled  he appealed to her vanity
even, whether strong affection could thus
neglect, and leave the object of its soli-
citude? Yet, had she done nothing to
chill a husband and parent's affection-
had she not herself lessened the regard
they had so faithfully cherished?
Calantha thought she had sufficient
honour and spirit to tell her husband at
once the danger to which she was ex-
posed; but when she considered more
seriously her situation, it appeared to her
almost ridiculous to fancy that it was so
imminent. If upon some occasion, Lord
Glenarvon's manner was ardent, the en-
suing morning she found him cold,

distant and pre-occupied, and she felt
ashamed of the weakness which, for one
moment, could have made her imagine
she was the object of his thoughts. In-
deed, he often took an opportunity of
stating, generally, that he never could feel
either interest or love for any thing on
earth; that once he had felt too deeply
and had suffered bitterly from it; and
that now his sole regret was in the cer-
tainty that he never again could be so
deceived.
He spoke, with decision, of leaving
Ireland, and more than once repeated,
emphatically to the Duke, "I shall never
forget the kindness which prompted you
to seek me out, when under very unplea-
sant circumstances ; I shall immediately
withdraw my name from the directory-
my sentiments I cannot change; but you
have already convinced me of the folly
of spreading them amongst the unen-
lightened multitude."
Sir Everard, who was present, lifted

cried ; " and Elinor"-" Miss St. Clare,"

me, to return to an indulgent uncle, and

tinued Lord Glenarvon, with an air which
seemed haughtily to claim belief, " I re-
turn her as innocent as she came to me.
Her imagination may have bewildered
and beguiled her; but her principles are
uncorrupted." " Generous young noble-
man !" exclaimed Sir Everard, ready to
kneel before him-" noble, mighty,
grand young gentleman ! wonder of our
age!" Lord Glenarvon literally smiled
through his tears; for the ridicule of Sir
Everard did not prevent his excellent
and warm feelings from affecting those
who knew him well. " And will she

possible to describe how well he read
them. The poetry he read was beautiful
as his own; it affected him. He 'read
more; he became animated ; Calantha
looked
up; he fixed his eyes on hers;: he
forgot the poem; his hand touched hers,
as he replaced the book before her ; she
drew away her hand; he took it and
pressed it to liis lips. "Pardon me," he
said, " I am miserable, but I will never
injure you. Fly me, Lady Avondale: I
deserve not either interest or regard ;
and to look upon me is in itself pollution
to one like you." He then said a few
words expressive of his admiration for

yet: but it is no matter," he continued;

heart; I am like death, Lady Avondale ;

Whilst the conscience wakes, and the
blush of confused and trembling guilt
yet varies the complexion, the sin is not
of long standing, or of deep root; but
when the mind seeks to disguise from
itself its danger--when, playing upon
the edge of the precipice, the victim wil-
lingly deludes itself, and appears hard
and callous to every admonitory caution,
then is the moment for alarm; and that
moment now appeared to realize Calan-
tha's fears.
Attacked with some asperity by her nu-
merous friends, for her imprudent con-
duct, she now boldly avowed her friend-
ship for Glenarvon, and disclaimed the
possibility of its exceeding the bounds of
the strictest propriety prescribed. She
even gloried in his attachment; and
said that there was not one of those who
were admonishing her to beware who
would not readily, nay, even gladly fill
her place. Calantha had seen their let-
ters to him: she had marked their ad.

vances; she imagined that all others, like
herself, were enamoured of the same
idol ; and in this instance she was right:
the infatuation was general: he was
termed the leader of the people, the libe-
rator of his country, the defender of the
rights of Ireland. If he wandered forth
through Belfont, he was followed by ad-
miring crowds; and whilst he affected to
disdain the transient homage, she could
but perceive that he lost no opportunity
by every petty artifice of encreasing the
illusion.

CHAPTER X VI.
At this crisis the whole party at the
castle were disturbed by the unexpected
arrival of the Princess of Madagascar at
Dublin. A small fleet had been seen
approaching the coast : it was rumour-
ed that the French, in open boats, were
preparing to invade Ireland; but it
proved, though it may sound rather ludi-
crous to say so, only the great Nabob
and the Princess of Madagascar. Their
immense retinue and baggage, which
the common people took for the heavy
artillery, arrived without incident or ac
cident at Belfont; and the couriers
having prepared the Duke for the recep-
tion of his illustrious guest, they await-
ed her arrival with considerable impa-
tience.
During the bustle and noise, this little

event occasioned, Lord Glenarvon came
to Lady Avondale and whispered in her
ear, "I shall walk this evening : contrive
to do so too, as I have something of im-
portance to tell you." He gave her a
ring. It was an emerald with a harp
engraved upon it-the armorial bearing
of Ireland : "let us be firm and united,"
was written under. " I mean it merely
politically," he said smiling.
"Even
were you  Clarissa, you need not be
alarmed: I am no Lovelace, I promise
you."
The princess was now announced, fifty-
three attendants and twenty-four domes-
tic friends, were her small and conscien-
tious establishment, besides a cook, con-
fectioner and laundress, to the total dis.
comfiture of Irish hospitality. The high
priest in the dress of the Greek Church,
ever attended her, and eagerly sought to
gain adherents to the only true established
church, at whatever house he occasionally
rested. The simplicity of Hoiouskim,

his eagerness, his abilities and informa-
tion, added much to the rational pleasure
of the society at Castle Delaval.
But neither the presence of the Nabob
nor the caresses of the Princess, who cast
many a gentle glance upon Glenarvon,
could for one moment detach his thoughts
from Calantha. On the contrary he an-
swered her with distant reserve and ap-
peared eager to shew to every one the
marked distinction he felt for the woman
he loved. "Oh! he is really sincere,"
she thought, as he left them all to attend
to her. " I amuse, I soothe him," the
hope rendered her blest and she felt in-
different to every consequence.
" You are not as handsome as Sophia,"
said Glenarvon, looking on her ; "but
I admire you more.

such as you have frankly confessed ; but
you have others which you wished me
not to perceive.

answered. " You are too vain." " None
ever yet resisted me," said Glenarvon :
" do you think you could ?" Calantha
scarce knew how to answer ; but while
she assured him she could resist any one
and had no fear for herself, she felt the
contrary; and trembled with mixed ap-
prehensions of joy and sorrow at her
boastwhen others approached, he did
not change his manner to Calantha : he
discontinued his conversation ; but he
still looked the same: he was not fearful
as some would have been, or servile, or
full of what might be said : he seemed
in all respects careless or desperate. He
laughed, but his laugh was not the heart's
laugh: his wit enlivened and dazzled

others; but it seemed not the effect of
exuberent spirits.
::It was not unfrequently the custom at
Castle Delaval, during the fine summer
evenings, to walk after dinner, before
cards or music. The flower gardens,
and shrubbery were the most usual pla-
ces of resort. Lady Augusta smilingly
observed to Lady Mandeville and Sophia,
that, for some evenings past, Lady Avon-
dale had taken more extensive rambles,
and that Lord Glenarvon and she were
oftentimes absent till supper was an-
nounced. The Count Gondimar, who
overheard the remark, affected to think it
malignant, and asked with a sarcastic
sneer, whether Lord Avondale were with
her on these evening excursions ? " Little
Mowbrey seems a great favourite of Lord
Glenarvon's," said Lady Augusta ; s but
I do not fancy his father is often of the
party, or that his being Lady Avondale's
child is the cause of the partiality: the boy
has a sprightly wit. We must not draw

unfair conclusions : last year Mr. Bucha-
nan gave us alarm ; and now it is quite
natural we should all fall in love with Lord
Glenarvon. I have myself ; only he will
not return my advances. Did you observe
what an eye I made him at breakfast ?....
but that never was a love making meal.
Place me but near him at supper, and
you shall see what I can do."
Gondimar suddenly left Lady August,
who was walking on the terrace. He had
caught a glimpse of Calantha as she
wandered slowly by the banks of Elle :-
he hastened to the spot'; he saw her ; he
penetrated her feelings; and he returned
thoughtful and irritated to the Castle.
Snatching a pen he wrote for some time.
Lady Trelawney and Lady Augusta, ob-
serving him, approached and insisted
upon being made acquainted with his
studies. " It is an ode you are inditing,
I am certain," said the latter, " I saw you
struck by the God as you darted from
me." " You are right," cried Gondimar,

" In English

even in that damn'd language : so criti-
cise my rhapsody if you dare. At all
events Lady Avondale will admire it; for
it is about a rose and love-most senti.
mental. And where is she? for till her
return, I will not shew it you."
If that question where is Lady Avon-
dale must be answered, it is with sorrow
and regret that such answer will be made:
- she was walking slowly, as Gondimar
had seen her, by the banks of the river
Elle: she was silent, too, and mournful ;
her spirits were gone ; her air was that
of one who is deeply interested in all she
hears. She was not alone-Lord Gle-
narvon was by her side. It was their
custom thus to walk : they met daily ;
they took every opportunity of meeting ;
and when in their morning and evening
rambles she pointed out the beautiful
views around, the ranging mountains

and the distant ocean, he would des-
cribe in glowing language, the far more
magnificent and romantic scenery of
the countries through which he had
passed-countries teaming with rich
fruits, vineyards and olive groves ; luxu-
riant vales and mountains, soaring above
the clouds, whose summits were white
with snow, while a rich and ceaseless ve-
getation adorned the valleys beneath. He
told her that he hated these cold northern
climes, and the bottle green of the Atlan-
tic; that could she see the dark blue of
the Mediterranean, whose clear wave re-
flected the cloudless sky, she would never
be able to endure those scenes in which
she now took such delight. And soon
those scenes lost all their charms for Ca-
lantha ; for that peace of mind which
gave them charms was fast departing ;
and she sighed for that beautiful land to
which his thoughts reverted, and those
Italian climes, to which he said, he so
soon must returu.

CHAPTER XVII.
It was upon this evening, that, having
walked for a considerable time, Lady
Avondale felt fatigued and rested for a
moment near the banks of Elle. She
pointed to the roses which
grew
luxu-
riantly around. " They are no longer
rare," she said, alluding to the one he had
given her upon their first acquaintance
at Donallan : " but are they the less pri-
zed ?" He understood her allusion, and
pulling a bud from the mossy bank
on which it grew, he kissed it, and
putting it gently to her lips asked her,
if the perfume were sweet, and which
she preferred of the two roses which
he had offered her? She knew not
what she answered ; and she afterwards
wished she could forget what she had
then felt.
Gondimar passed them at that mo-

had been composing a song, but would
not sing it till she was present. She
eagerly desired to hear it. "It is about
a rose," said Gondimar, significantly
glancing his eye upon the one in Calan-
tha's bosom. The colour in her cheeks
became far redder than the flower. :"Sing
it," she said, " or rather let me read it..,
or ... but wherefore are you not dan-
cing, or at billiards ? How dull it must
be for Clara and Charlotte" (these were
two of Lady Mandeville's children).
" You never thought of Lady Mande-
ville's beautiful children, and our state
of dullness, while you were walking,"
cried Lady Augusta, " and last night you
recollect that when you made every one
dance, you sat apart indulging vain phan-
tasies and idle reveries. However, they
are all gone into the ball-room, if dancing
is the order of the night ; but as for me,
I shall not stir from this spot, till I hear
Count Gondimar's song.".

looked upon Calantha and she trembled ;
for his manner was much altered. Her
cheeks kindled as she spoke :- her eye
dared no longer encounter his. If she
looked
up
for a moment, she withdrew
in haste, unable to sustain the ardent
glance: her step tremblingly advanced,
lingering, but yet unwilling to pause or to
retreat. Her heart beat in tumult, or
swelled with passion, as he whispered to
her that, which she ought never to have
heard. She hastened towards the castle:
he did not attempt to detain her.
It was late: the rest of the company
were gone home. Thither she hastened;
and hurrying to the most crowded part of
the room, flushed with her walk, she com-
plained of the heat, and thought that
every eye was fixed upon her with looks
of strong disapprobation. Was it indeed
so? or was it a guilty conscience which
made her think so ?
Lady Mandeville observing her dis
tress, informed her that Count Gondimar,

had been composing a song, but would
not sing it till she was present. She
eagerly desired to hear it. ,"It is about

glancing his eye upon the one in Calan-
tha's bosom. The colour in her cheeks

said the Count, smiling at her distress,
" the first evening that you remain at
your balcony alone, watching the clouds
as they flit across the moon, and listening,
I conclude, to the strains of the nightin-

Then," she said, affecting un-
concern, " I claim your promise for to-
morrow night, punctually at nine." He
approached the piano-forte. " Oh not
nowI" am engaged, I must dance."
"Now or never," said the Count. " Never
then, never," she answered, almost cry-
ing; though she affected to laugh. Lady
Augusta entreated for the song, and the
Count, after a short prelude, placed the
manuscript paper before him, and in a
low tone of voice began:-
(To the air of " Ils ne sont plus.")

Here 'twas at eve, near yonder tree reposing,
One still too dear, first breath'd his vows to thee:
Wear this, he cried, his guileful love disclosing,
Near to thy heart, in memory of me.
Love's cherished gift, the rose he gave, is faded;
Love's blighted flower, can never bloom again.
Weep for thy fault-in heartin mind degraded :
Weep, if thy tears can wash away the stain.
Call back the vows, that once to heaven were plighted,
Vows full of love, of innocence and truth.
Call back the scenes in which thy soul delighted :
Call back the dream that blest thy early yonth.
Flow silver stream, tho' threatening tempests lower,
Bright, mild and clear, thy gentle waters flow;
Round thy green banks, the spring's young blossoms
flower;
O'er thy soft waves the balmy zephyrs blow.

Nature in charms, to thee can make it fair.

Years past of bliss, and future of despair.

tened with Calantha into the adjoining
Lord Glenarvon followed and
approached Lady Avondale: "Remember
me in your prayers, my gentlest friend,"
he whispered. " Even in the still night
let some remembrance of Glenarvon
occur. Think of me, for I am jealous
even of thy dreams.' The angry glance
of Gondimar interrupted the conference.
Calantha could not sleep that night.
A thousand fears and hopes rushed upon
her mind. She retired to her room :
at one time seized a pen, and wrote, in all
the agony of despair, a full confession of
her guilty feelings to her husband; the
next she tore the dreadful testimony of
har erring heart, and addressed herself to
heaven for mercy. But vain the struggle.
From childhood's earliest day she never
hed refused herself one wish, or one in-
dulgence, She knew not, on the sudden
how to allay the fierce and maddening
fever that raged within. "I am lost,

she cried, " I love-I worship. To live
without him will be death-worse, worse
than death. One look, one smile from
Glenarvon, is dearer than ought else that
heaven has to offer. Then let me not
attempt, what I have not power to effect.
Oh, as his friend, let me still behold him.
His love, some happier, some better heart
shall possess." Again she started with
horror from herself. 66 His love!" she
cried, "and can I think of him in so
criminal-so guilty a manner ! I who
am a wife-a mother! Let me crush
such feelings even now in their birth. Let
me fly him, whilst yet it is possible; nor
imagine the grief, he says my absence
will cause, can exceed the misery my dis-
honourable attachment will bring upon
both! And did he dare to tell me that he
loved me? Was not this in itself a proof
that he esteemed me no longer? Misera-
ble, wretched Calantha; where shall I fly
to hide my shame? How conceal from a
lover's searching eyes that he is too dear?"

With such thoughts she attempted to
close her eyes; but dreadful dreams dis-
turbed her fancy; and the image of Gle-
narvon pursued her even in sleep. She
saw him-not kneeling at her feet, in all
the impassioned transports of love; not
radiant with hope, nor even mournful
with despondency and fear ; but pale,
deadly, and cold: his hand was ice, and,
as he placed it upon hers, she shrunk as
from the grasp of death, and awoke
oppressed with terror.

CHAPTER XVIII.
No one had apparently observed Lady
Avondale's feigned indisposition that
evening-feigned, indeed, it was not;
no one soothed her during her sleepless
night; and in the morning when she
awoke, at an early hour, Lord Avondale
asked her not the cause of her disquiet,
deeply grieved at her altered manner-
too proud to seek the confidence he per-
peceived that he had lost-disappointed
in the character and conduct of the
woman he had chosen as a companion
and solace, he watched not her actions,
he penetrated not her feelings, but finding
that his presence was distasteful to her,
he avoided her: he even thought that he
no longer loved one who in every point
had acted in the manner he least ap-
proved. Some there are whose affections

.
change with their esteem and good opi-
nion. Unhappily for Lord Avondale this
was not his nature. Long habit had
rendered Calantha dear. He thought
that he had become indifferent, but he
knew not that the empire with which she
seized over his heart. She arose and
descended upon the terrace:-her steps
involuntarily led her to the banks of the
Elle, The flowers, fresh with dew,
sparkled in the sunshine, and scented the
soft morning air. She hurried on, re-
gardless of the distance. The flower
Glenarvon had given her was faded: but
its leaves were preserved by her with
fondest care.
Whilst yet she walked, at a little dis-
tance she perceived Gondimar, and was
in consequence preparing to return,
when he abruptly accosted her; and with
a manner too little respectful, rudely seiz-
ed her hand. " Have you not slept ?"
he cried, " my charming, my adored
young friend, that you are thus early in
14

.
your walk; or did you imagine that
others, beside myself, would wander upon
these banks, and await your fairy step?
O suffer one who admireswho loves,
to open his heart to youto seize this
opportunity."
" Leave me, approach
me not. What have I done to deserve
this from you?" she exclaimed. "Why
seize
my hand by force? Why press it-
oh Heavens ! to those detested lips ?
Leave me, Count Gondimar : forget not
the respect due to every woman." " Of
virtue !" he replied, with a scornful
smile. " But tell me, has Lady Avon-
dale never suffered such insults from
some who have no better claim ? Has
she still a right to this amazing mockery
of respect ? Ah! trust me, we cannot
command our love."
- Neither can we
command our abhorrenceour disgust,"
she exclaimed, breaking from his grasp
and hastening away.
As Calantha re-entered the Castle, she
met Lady Margaret and Glenarvon, who
## p. 177 (#491) ############################################

177
some
appeared surprised and disconcerted at
seeing her. " Has Count Gondimar
been speaking to you upon any subject
of importance ?" said Lady Margaret in
a whisper, trying to conceal a look of
suspicion, and
embarrassment.
Before ('alantha could answer, he had
joined them ; and explaining fully that
their meeting had been entirely acci-
dental, they both walked away together
and in earnest discourse, leaving Lord
Glenarvon and Lady Avondale together.
Calantha's heart was full, she could
not speak, she therefore left him in
haste and when alone she wept. Had
she not reason; for every indignity and
grief was falling fast upon her. She
could not tell what had occurred to Lord
Avondale: he had a proud and dangerous
spirit; and to Glenarvon she would not
upon every account.
Glenarvon awaited
her return with anxiety. "I was surprised
to see you with my aunt," she said,
56 what were you saying to her." He
1 5

178
GLENARVON,
evaded the question, and tenderly en-
quired of her the cause of her uneasiness
and tears. He loved beyond a doubt,
at least he convinced Calantha that he
did so.
Confused, perturbed, she, more than
ever felt the danger of her situation: trem-
bling she met his eyes, fearing lest he
should penetrate her secret. Confident
in her own strength: " I will fly," she
said, " though it be to the utmost ex-
tremity of the earth; but I will never
yield-never betray myself. My fate is
sealed-misery must, in future, be my
portion; but no eye shall penetrate into
the recesses of my heart--none shall
share my distress, or counsel me in my
calamity." Thus she reasoned, and
struggling as she thought, against her
guilty passion, by attempting to deceive
the object of her devotion, she in reality
yielded herself entirely to his
deluded and without controul.
How new to her mind appeared the
power, self

179
fever of her distracted thoughts! Love
she had feltunhappy love, she had once
for a time experienced; but no taint of
guilt was mingled with the feeling ; and
the approach to vice she started from
with horror and alarm. - Lord Glenarvon
had succeeded too well-she had seen
him-she had heard him too often ; she
fled in vain: he read his empire in the
varying colour of her cheeks; he traced
his power in every faultering word, in
every struggling sigh: that strange si-
lence, that timid air, that dread of b-
holding him - all confirmed, and all
tempted him forward to pursue his easy
prey. " She is mine," he cried exult-
ingly.".mine, too, without a struggle:
this fond wife, this chaste and pure Ca-
lantha. Wherever I turn, new victims
fall before me  they await not to be
courted."
But Lord Glenarvon had oftentimes
said, that he never again could feel af-
fection for any woman.

the interest he shewed Calantha to be
accounted for? What name was he to
It was the attachment of a
brother to the sister whom he loved ; it
was all devotion--all purity; he would
never cherish a thought that might not
be heard in heaven, or harbour one wish
detrimental to the happiness of his friend.
This was said, as it often has been said:
both felt that it was false; but both
continued to repeat, what they wished to
believe possible. His health and spirits
had much declined; he looked as if
sorrows, which he durst not utter, af-
flicted his heart; and though, in the
presence of others he affected gaiety,
when alone with Calantha he did not
disguise his sadness.
She sought to
console him: she was grave-she was
gentle, she could be both ; and the oc-
casion seemed to call for her utmost
kindness.
He spoke much to her; and sometimes
read as Lord Avondale once had done ;

181
and none ever but Lord Avondale read
as well. His tears flowed for the sorrows
of those whose poetry and history he re-
peated. Calantha wept also ; but it was
for Glenaryon, that she mourned. When
she had ended the tale of love and sorrow,
his eyes met hers and they spoke more
far more than words. Perhaps he gene-
rously resolved to contend against his
own feelings; even at times he warned her
of her danger. -But, when he bade
her fly him, he held her hand, as if
to detain her; and when he said the
passion he cherished would cause the
misery of both, he acknowledged that
her presence alleviated his sufferings,
and that he could not bear to see her
less.

GLENARVON,
CHAPTER XIX.
There are scenes of guilt it would be
horrible to paint  there are hours of
agony it is impossible to describe! All
sympathy recedes from triumphant vice,
and the kindest heart burns with indig-
nation at the bare recital of unpunished
crime. By night, by day, the tortures of
remorse pursued Lady Avondale. In a
husband's presence, she trembled ; from
a parent's tenderness she turned with af-
fected coldness; her children, she durst
not look upon. To the throne of heaven,
she no longer offered up one prayer :
upon a sleepless bed, visions of horror
distracted her fancy; and when, at break
of day, a deep and heavy slumber fell on
her, instead of relieving a weary spirit,
feverish dreams and maddening appre-
hensions disturbed her rest. Glenarvon

had entirely possessed himself of her
imagination.
Glenarvon had said, there was a horrid
secret, which weighed upon his mind.
He would start at times, and gaze on
vacancy; then turn to Calantha, and ask
her what she had heard and seen. His
gestures, his menaces were terrific. He
would talk to the air ; then laugh with
convulsive horror ; and gazing wildly
around, enquire of her, if there was not
blood upon the earth, and if the ghosts
of departed men had not been seen by
some.
Calantha thought that madness had
fallen upon his mind, and wept to think
that talents such as his were darkened
and shrouded over by so heavy a cala-
mity. But when the fierce moment was
passed, tears would force their way into
his eye, and placing her hand upon his
burning head, he would call her his sole
comforter, the only hope that was left him
upon earth; his dearest, his only friend;

184
GLENARYON.
66
and he would talk to her of happier times;
of virtues that had been early blighted;
of hopes that his own rashness and errors
had destroyed.
It was one day, one dark and fatal day,
when passion raging in his bosom, and
time and opportunity at hand, he sud-
denly approached her, and seizing her
with violence, asked her if she returned
his love. My friendship is ruin," he
cried ; "all alliance with me must cast
disgrace upon the object of my regard.
But, Calantha, you must be mine! May
I not even now call you thus ? Shall they
ever persuade you to abandon me? Vain
is all attempt at disguise," he continued;
" I love you to madness and to distrac-
tion-you know it too well. Why then
suffer me to feel the tortures I endure,
when a word-a look from you could re-
You are not indifferent: say
then that you are notthou, who alone

sence of heaven, I will open my whole

heart before you that heart is seered
, with guilt ; it is bleeding with venomed
wounds, incurable and deadly. A few
short years, I have perhaps yet to linger:
thou mayest accelerate my fate, and plunge
me still lower, whilst I cling to thee for
mercy ; but will you do it, because
you
have the power?"
Calantha scarce could support herself.
After a moment's pause, he continued,
" You shall hear me, --Never, since the
hour of my birth, never--I make no ex-
ception of either the living, or, what is
far dearer and more sacred to me, the
dead-never did I love with such mad
and frantic violence as now. O seek not
to disguise it; that love is returned. I
read it even now in thine eyes, thy lips ;
and whilst, with assumed and barbarous
coldness, you would drive me from you,
your own heart pleads for me; and, like
myself, you love."
Faint and trembling, Calantha now
leant for support upon that arm which

186
GLENARVON.
surrounded her, and from which she, in
vain, attempted to shrink. It was a dread-
ful moment. Glenarvon, who never yet
had sued in vain, marked every varying
turn of her countenance which too well
expressed his empire and her own weak-
ness.
- I cannot live without you.
Mine you aremine you shall ever be, "
he said, "whilst this heart beats with
life." Then, with a smile of exultation,
he seized her in his arms.
Starting, however, with all the terror
which the first approach to guilt must
ever cause, " Spare me," she cried, ter-
rified and trembling : " even though my
heart should break in the struggle, let
me not act so basely by him to whom I
am bound.""Say only, that you do not
hate me-say only," he continued, with
more gentleness, and pressing her hand
to his lips" say only, that you share the
tortures of agony you have inflicted -say
that which I know and see that I am
loved to adoration even as I love you."

.66
With tears she besought him to spare
her. " I feel your power too much," she
said. " All that I ought not-must not
say,
I think and feel. Be satisfied ; your
empire iscomplete. Spare me-save me;
I have not power to feign." Her tears
fell now unrestrained.
66 There is no
need of this," he said, recovering him-
self; you have sealed my fate. A mo-
ment of passion beguiled me: I am calm
now, as when first I met you-calm and
cold, even as yourself. Since it is your
wish, and since my presence makes your
misery, let us part.- I go, as I have often
said ; but it shall be alone. My country
I leave without regret ; for the chain of
tyranny has encompassed it: friends, I
have none; and thou, who wert as an
angel of light to meto whom I knelt
for safety and for peacemayst thou be
blest: this is all I ask of heaven. As for
me, nothing can increase the misery I
feel. I wish you not to believe it, or to
share it. This is no lovers despondency

narvon looked on her with kindness.
" Let no fears dissuade you until I shew
myself unworthy of the trust. Forsake
not him, whose only happiness is in
your affection. I was joyless and without
hope, when first I met you ; but the re-
turn, to loneliness and misery, is hard to
bear. Be virtuous, and, if it may be so,
be happy." " That I never more can
be," she answered. " You are young in
sin yet," said Glenarvon ; " you know
not its dangers, its pleasures, or its bit-
terness. All this, ere long, will be for-
gotten." " Never forgotten," she replied,
66 oh never !"

CHAPTER XX.
GLENARNON wandered forth every even-
ing, by the pale moon, and no one knew
whither he went, and no one marked but
Calantha how late was his return. And
when the rain fell heavy and chill, he
would bare his forehead to the storm ;
and faint and weary wander forth, and
often he smiled on others and appeard
calm, whilst the burning fever of his
blood continued to rage within.
Once Calantha followed him, it was
at sunset, and he shewed when he beheld
her, no mark of surprise or joy. She
followed him to the rocks called the Black
Sisters, and the cleft in the mountain
called the Wizzard's Glen ; there was a
lonely cottage near the cleft where St.
Clara, it was said, had taken up her
abode. He knocked; but she was from

home: he called; but no one replied
from within. Her harp was left at the
entrance of a bower; a few books and a
table were also there.
Glenarvon ap-
proached the harp and leaning upon it,
fixed his eyes mournfylly and steadfastly
upon Calantha. , " Others who formerly
felt or feigned interest for me," he said,
" were either unhappy in their marriage,
or in their situation; but you
brave
every
thing for me. : Unhappy Calantha ! how
little do you know the heart for which
you are preparing to sacrifice so much."
The place upon which they stood was
wild and romantic; the sea murmured
beneath them ; distant sounds reached
them from the caverns; and the boats
passed to and fro within the harbour. The
descent was rugged and dangerous. Ca-
lantha looked first upon the scene, and
then upon Glenarvou : still he leant upon
the harp, and seemed to be lost in me-
lancholy remembrances.

interrupting him" Ah! sing as I first
you :- those notes reached the
heart." " Did they ?" he cried, approach-
ing her, as his lips pressed, upon hers,
one ardent kiss. The blood rushed from
her heart in alarm and agitation :-she
trembled and turned from him. " There
is no cause," he said, gently following
her:"it is the first kiss of love, sweet
one; the last is full of bitterness."
Sing to me," she said, confused and
terrified, " in mercy, approach me not
-I am alone-I fear you, I will sing,"
he said, " and check those fears," saying
which he began. It was not like a song,
but a sort of soft low murmur, with an
air of such expression and empassioned
feeling, that every note said more than
words: it vibrated to the soul.
Farewell."
Ah! frown not thus-nor turn from me,
I must not-dare not-look on thee;
Too well thou know'st how dear thou art,
'Tis hard but yet 'tis best to part:
I wish thee not to share my grief,
It seeks, it hopes, for no relief.
## p. 192 (#506) ############################################

" Farewell."
Come give thy hand, what though we part,
Thy name is fixed, within my heart ;
I shall not change, nor break the vow
I made before and plight thee now;
For since thou may'st not live for me,
'Tis sweeter far to die for thee.
& Farewell"
Thou'lt think of me when I am gone,
None shall undo, what I have done ;
Yet even thy love I would resign
To save thee from remorse like mine ;
Thy tears shall fall upon my grave :
They still may bless they cannot save.
Sing no more," said Calantha, " let
us return home. I know not what I
say,
or do. Judge not of my feelings by
those which predominate in your pre-
sence. I may be weak, I acknowledge your
power,
I am lost irretrievably if you are
resolved upon it." " Calantha", said Lord
Glenarvon firmly, " you may trust impli-
citly to my honor. These are the last
guilty words, I will ever suffer to pass
my lips. Henceforward consider me only
as your friendas such accept my hand.'
He smiled in scorn as he said this.

At that moment they wereinterrupted;
a bark from Inis Tara approached the
shore, and O'Kelly, Lord Glenarvon's
servant, and two other men descended
from it. " To avoid observation, I will
join my friends one moment," he said,
" if you will walk gently home, I can
overtake you,but, perhaps you will await
my return." "I will go home : it is late,"
said Calantha. He appeared much vexed;
Well then I will await your return,
saying this Calantha descended with him
the rugged path down the cliff, and
watched the lessening bark, and heard
the distant shouts from some of his fol-
lowers who were assembled in the cavern,
as they hailed his approach to land : after
which a long silence prevailed, alone in-
terrupted by the rippling of the waves.
The meeting was apparently over: there
were whole parties returning from below,
in different directions.
Whilst yet awaiting Lord Glenarvon's
return, Calantha heard the same air re-

peated which he had so lately played. It
seemed as if the wind, as it blew along
the wooded shores, had struck
upun
the
chords. It was strange ; for Glenarvon
was gone. She turned in haste, and from
above beheld a young man.
Ah noit
was St. Clara. Too soon she saw that it
was her. Her ear had caught the last
murmurs of Glenarvon's song, and her
hand feebly repeated the strain. But, soon
perceiving Calantha, she gazed with wild
alarm one moment upon her, then throw-
ing the plumed hat aside, with a grace and
ease peculiar to herself, shestruck the full
chords, and her clear voice ascended
upon the air in soft impassioned numbers.
Lady Avondale heard the words of her
song as it murmured along the breeze.
(To the air of," Hear me swear how much I love.")
By that smile which made me blest,
And left me soon the wretch you see-
By that Leart I once possest,
Which now, they say, is given to thee-
By St. Clara's wrongs and woes
Trust not young Glenarvon's vows.

By those lays which breathe around
A poet's great and matchless art-
By that voice whose silver sound
Can soothe to peace th'imprisoned heart-
By every bitter pang I prove-
Trust not young Glenarvon's love.
Each brighter, kinder hope forsaking,
Bereft of all that made life dear ;
My health impaired, my spirit breaking,
Yet still too proud to shed one tear ;
O! lady, by my wrongs and woes,
Trust not young Glenarvon's vows.
And when at length the hand of death
Shall bid St. Clara's heart be still
When struggling with her latest breath,
His image shall her fancy fill,
Ah trust to one whose death shall prove
What fate attends Glenarvon's love.
Lady Avondale eagerly attempted to
appraoch her. " Beautiful, unhappy St.
Clara, I will be your friend will protect
you. She ran forward, and climbed the
steep ascent with ease: but the youthful
harper arose-her dark sunny ringlets

derision; and laughing as she upheld a
chain with an emerald ring, bounded
over the rocks with an activity, which
long habit had rendered familiar.
Calantha beheld her no more : but the
distant shouts of applause re-echoed as at
first among the caverns and mountains ;
and the bark with Lord Glenarvon soon
re-appeared in sight. She awaited his
return. As he approached the beach, a
loud murmur of voices from behind the
rock continued. He joined her in a mo-
ment. His countenance was lighted with
the ray of enthusiasm :-his altered man-
ner shewed the success his efforts had
obtained. He told Calantha of his pro-
jects ; he described to her the meetings
which he had held by night and day ;
and he spoke with sanguine hope of fu-
ture success the freedom of Ireland, and
the deathless renown of such as supported
her fallen rights. " Some day you must
follow me," he cried : " let me shew

suing week.'
" I will walk no more with you to
Inis Tara :-the harp sounds mournfully
on those high cliffs :-Iwish never more
to hear it." " Have you seen St. Clara ?"
he said, without surprise.
" She sings
and plays well, does she not? But she is
not dear to me: think not of her. I could
hate her, but that I pity her. Young as
she is, she is cruelly hardened and vin-
dictive."-"I cannot fear her: she is
too young and too beautiful to be as aban-
doned as you would make me think."
" It is those who are young and beautiful
you should fear most," he said, approach-
ing her more nearly.--"I may fear them,"
she replied, " but can you teach me to
fly them?"
It was now late: very little more passed:
they returned home, where they were re-
ceived with considerable coldness. But
Lady Mandeville, perceiving the state of
suffering to which Calantha had reduced

herself, generously came forward to sooth
and to assist her. She appeared really
attached to her; and at this time more
even than at any former period, shewed
her sincere and disinterested friendship.
And yet she was the person Mrs. Sey-
mour distrusted ; and even Glenarvon
spoke of her with asperity and disdain.
" Adelaide! though an envious world
may forsake thee, a grateful friend shall
stand firm by thee to the last.". Such
were Calantha's thougths, as Lady Man-
deville, languidly throwing her rounded
arm over her, pressed her to her bosom,
and sighed to think of the misery she
was preparing for herself." Yet, when I
see how he loves thee," she continued,
" I cannot blame, I will not judge thee."
That evening Glenaryon wrote to Lady
Avondale. His letter repeated all he had
before said ; it was ardent : it was un-
guarded. She had scarce received it,
scarce placed it in her bosom, when
Lady Margaret attacked her.

think," she said, " that you have made a
conquest. Silly child, Lord Glenarvon
is merely playing upon your vanity."
Lady Augusta whispered congratulations :
Sophia hoped she was pleased with her
morning walk ; Sir Everard coldly asked
her if she beheld his niece, and then,
with a sneer at Lord Glenarvon, said it
was vastly pleasant to depend upon cer-
tain people's promises.
All this time Calantha felt not grieved:
Glenarvon had said he loved her: it was
enough : his attachment was worth all
else beside; and Lord Avondale's in-
creasing neglect and coldness steeled her
heart against the crime of inconstancy.
Before supper, Glenarvon took an op-
portunity of speaking to her.

" I must be obeyed :you will find me
a master-a tyrant perhaps ;-not a slave.
If I once love, it is with fervor-with
madness. I must have no trifling, no
rivals. The being I worship must be

pure even in thought ; and, if I spare her,
think not that it is to let others approach
her. No, Lady Avondale ; not even what
appears most innocent to you, shall be
endured by me. I shall be jealous of
every look, word, thought. There must
be no shaking of hands, no wearing of
chains, but such as I bestow, and you
must write all you think and feel without
reserve or fear. Now, mark me, fly if
you have the power; but if you remain,
you already know your fate.
Calantha resolved to fly: yes, she felt
the necessity. To-morrow, she said,
she would go. That to-morrow came,
and she had not strength.
Glenarvon
wrote constantly : she replied with the
same openness.

he said, " call me your friend, your
lover : call me Glenarvon-Clarence if
you will. All these forms, these regula-
tions are odious amongst those who are
attached. Say that you love, beloved
Calantha: my own heart's friend, say it;

for I see it, and know it." There is no
greater crime in writing it than in feeling
it. Calantha said it too soontoo soon
she wrote it. "My dearest Clarence, my
friend, my comforter :" such were the
terms she used. Shame to the pen, the
hand that dared to trace them. Days, and
days passed, and soon Glenarvon was all
on earth to her; and the love he felt or
feigned, the only hope and happiness of
her existence.

CHAPTER XXI.
LORD AVONDALE now looked more and
more coldly on Calantha : but all others
courted and flattered her. The Princess
and many others had departed. Mrs.
Seymour alone appeared to watch her
with anxiety. In vain Calantha affected
the most thoughtless gaiety : remorse and
suspense alternately agitated her mind.
One evening she observed Lord Glenar-
narvon and her aunt, Mrs. Seymonr, in
earnest discourseshe knew not then that
she herself was the subject. 6. She is
pure, she is innocent," said Mrs. Sey-
mour: "her spirits wild and thoughtless,
may
have led her into a thousand follies ;
but worse, never never." -
66 Fierce
passion burns in her eye," said Glenar-
von, scornfully: " the colour in her
cheeks varies--I love her as well as you

you think she does not love me a little in
return?"" Oh ! even in jest, do not
talk thus of Calantha," said Mrs. Sey-
mour: " you alarm me.
alarm me."" There is no
occasion," replied Glenarvon : " calm
yourself. I only said, that were I to at-
tempt it I could succeed ; she should be
ready to leave you, and Lord Avondale,
her dear husband and her babes, and her
retinue, and all else ; and I could make
her follow me as St. Clara did ; aye verily;
but, in truth, I will not." Mrs. Seymour
was angry; she coloured ; she was hurt.
" You could not," she replied with warmth:
" 0 I know her well and know you
could not. Whatever her faults she is so
pure, so chaste even in thought.""She
loves me.""It is false," said Mrs. Sey-
mour, still more eagerly. " Even if she
had any foolish romantic liking to ano-
ther than her husband, Buchanan is the
favourite."-"Buchanan!" said Lord Gle-
narvon with a sneer. 66 I will make her
heart ache for this," after which he retiredo

Calantha knew not then one word of
what had passed ; the next morning she
was informed by Mrs. Seymour that Lord
Glenarvon was gone. " Gone! where ?"
she said rather in surprise, and agitated.
" I know not," replied Mrs. Seymour,
coldly enough. " I conclude to Belfont :
his uncle Lord de Ruthven, is arrived
there. But, indeed, I am glad he is gone :
--you have not conducted yourself well.
I, your aunt, have no doubt of you ; but
others who know you less, Calantha
blame you more.'
A letter was now delivered to Mrs.
Seymour : she opened it: it was from
Glenarvon ; she was dreadfully agitated
upon reading it. It contained these words:
-"As you seem to doubt the confidence
and attachment with which your niece,
he Countess of Avondale, has honoured
me, I enclose you one of her own letters,
that
you may see my vnity alone did not
authorise me in the conclusion that she was
attached to me. Her duplicity to me can
scarcely justify the means I take of openi

ing an aunt's eyes ; but the peculiar cir-
cumstances of my situation will, I hope,
excuse it.
" Your most obedient servant,
66 GLENARVON."
This letter enclosed one of Lady Avon-
dale's  one which, however, she had
not blushed to write. She read it with
terror when Mrs. Seymour placed it in
her hands. Cruel Glenarvon ! could he
have the heart thus to betray me to my
own aunt too.-Oh ! had that aunt been
less indulgent, less kind, what had been
my fate ?
6. You are innocent yet, my child,"
said Mrs. Seymour, placing her arms
around her ; " and the early conviction
of the meanness and wickedness of him
for whom you were preparing to sacrifice
so much, will render it easy to reclaim
yourself from your present errors, and to
be less hasty in reposing confidence
hereafter.""Never, never, will I pardon

him," cried Calantha with indignation.
" I will not hate ; that were too flattering
to his vanity : I will not fly; that were a
proof that there was cause for it : but,
lowered to the dust as I ought to feel
humbled to the earth (and whilst she
spoke, she looked and felt more proudly,
more vainly than ever), even I can des-
pise him. What are superior talents, if
he who possesses them can act thus ? Oh!
I had rather die in torture, than ever par-
don this."
" Be less violent," said Mrs. Seymour,
with a look of heart-broken tenderness
and affection : " that stubborn spirit must
be subdued." -" I will revenge
" Be calm, Calantha : think what you are
saying : how unfeminine and how pue-
rile ! Put off these frowns and this idle
rage, and look reasonably upon your
own conduct, not upon his.""Shall you

again ?"" Had I the power, assuredly
never."" Oh, let him return; I care

not; I can see him with the scorn, with
the indifference he deserves. Do not
look thus, my dearest aunt: dry your
tears: I am not worth one single tear
now; but I will act in future so as to
silence even these too just reproaches."
" Do you repent, Calantha?" " Do
not talk of repentance: I cannot feel it:
my sin is light compared with his."-
" Towards your husband."-"Oh! Lord
Avondale, he is happy enough: he cares
not."-" Indeed he does, my child.

tremble for you: every hour of your
life is a continual warfare and peril. One
danger no sooner ends than another
arises. Will you never consider the du-
ties of your situation, or the character
you have to form and to preserve?"
" Who is more loved than I am? On
whom does even the world smile with
greater kindness ? Beauties, wits, the vir-
tuouscan they cope with me? I am
every one's friend, and every one loves,
even though they blame Calantha." As
-

she said this, she smiled and threw her-
self on her aunt's bosom.
But all this Calantha did but to cheer
her aunt. Though not false, she dreaded
any one's seeing the real state of her
mind: at this moment she thought
Mrs. Seymour too gentle, and of too ten-
der a nature to bear the violence of her
headstrong character: she knew it would
cause her misery were she to read her
heart's secret, and she smiled therefore
and spoke with levity, whilst her soul
was in torture. But the very moment
Mrs. Seymour had left her, Calantha gave
way to the rage of fury, and the despon-
dency she felt. To have lost Glenarvon,
was at this time the real source of her
regret;-to speculate upon the cause of
his sudden cruelty and treachery her sole
occupation.
At the hour of dinner Mrs. Seymour
again entered her room; but without a
single reproach. She had been crying-
her eyes were swollen and red; but she

affected scarcely to remember what had
passed, and urged Calantha to accompany
her to dinner, as her absence on the day
of Lord Glenarvon's departure, might
appear strange. But Lady Avondale stub-
bornly refused, and would not speak. She
even appeared sullen, that her aunt might
not see she was miserable. She even af-
fected more anger, more violence than she
felt against Glenarvon, that she might dis-
guise from herself and her aunt the pang
his loss had given her. She relented how-
ever when she saw her aunt's grief; and,
struggling with tears which never come
till passion is over, and which she thought
it weak to display, she dressed and ap-
peared at dinner. It was alone to please
Mrs. Seymour she had done so; and,
solely engrossed with the past, and ut-
terly indifferent to the mortifying remarks
her melancholy and silence occasioned,
Calantha hated those who had the unkind-
ness to censure and judge her, and re-
garded her own conduct without com-
punction or condemnation.

hand.
Towards evening Lord Avondale came
to her, and said kindly enough that she
looked ill. Then her heart smote her,
and affecting a pettish ill temper, which
she did not, could not feel, she replied
that she was well, and took up a book,
as if to read. May none ever experience
the torture Calantha felt, when, instead
of being offended, he gently pressed her
She had rather he had struck a
dagger into her heart.
Upon retiring to rest, Lady Avondale
sent for Zerbellini, and asked him res-
pecting Lord Glenarvon. The boy was
a constant favourite and playmate of his:
he carried notes and flowers, from each
to the other; and artless as he was, he
already felt delight in the eager interest
so much mystery and secrecy required.-
He told Lady Avondale a thousand anec-
dotes of Glenarvon; but he had told them
so often that they failed to please. He
then showed her the presents he had re-
ceived from those who formerly professed
to like her. " And did you ever shew

them to Lord Glenarvon?" said Lady
Avondale! The thought occurring that
this might have offended. "I did," said
Zerbellini, with a shrewd smile." And
was he angry?""Oh, not in the least :
only the more kind; and he did question
me so :" and then the boy repeated a
thousand things that he had asked, which
shewed Calantha too well, how eager he
was to ascertain, from other lips than
her's, every minute detail of follies and
errors she had committed. There was
no need for this.
Lady Avondale felt indignant; for there
was not a thought of heart she desired
to conceal from him, or alas from any -
What she had done wrong, she
herself had confessed without reserve;
and to be thus distrusted, deeply grieved

" If I pardon
this," she cried, as she sent Zerbellini
away, and hastened to bed," if ever I
waste a tear, or sigh, or thought, on him,

the thing is impossible."

she gave her this advice:
" Never place

of this sort is apt to terminate in a wreck ;
and whoever puts most at stake will be
the sufferer." Lady Augusta also de-
parted.

From that day, Lady Avondale grew
more calm: a degree of offended pride
supported her; and she resolved, cost
what it might, to continue firm. She
saw, that private communications were
taking place between Lady Margaret, her
father, and even her aunt and Glenar-
He had already contrived to inte-
rest every individual in the castle in his
affairs.-Lord Avondale often spoke of
him with praise; Sir Richard, though
he said he was a comical personage, ad-
mired hin, and the female part of the
society were all eager and enthusiastic on
the subject.
Lady Avondale experienced every feel-
ing that can be imagined during this
short period; and received the half con-
cealed taunts of her acquaintance with

becoming fortitude-even their commi-
seration for his having left her. She
heard their boasts too of what he had
written to them, without once repining;
but envy, rancour, malice, hatred, rage
and regret-all, more or less, arose and
subsided in her breast, till she heard one
morning, with a sort of trepidation, that
Lord Glenarvon was in the adjoining
room. Mrs. Seymour immediately came
to her. " Tell me truly," she said,
" have you any objection to his dining
here?" " Quite the contrary, said Ca-
lantha, with indifference; and she waited
till she heard the sound of the horses
galloping from the outer court; she then
looked from the window, and her heart
told her too well that she was not yet en
tirely recovered from her infatuation.'
At dinner they were to expect him;
and 'till dinner Lady Avondale could
think of nothing else. Mrs. Seymour
watched her with anxiety. She strove
anxiously to disguise what she felt, and

she succeeded better than before, for habit
now rendered the effortless painful.
But Lady Margaret whispered malicously
in her ear, that every thought and
feeling was more strongly exhibited by
her, with all her attempts to hide them
than by most others, when they wished
them to be seen. 66 And I know," she
added, unkindly enough,

with him again."  With whom?"
" See he appears," she said, "shall I
name him?"
Lady Avondale had resolved to be firm.
There is a degree of dignity, which every
proud mind can assume. To have for
given so much treachery and cruelty, had
been contemptible. She felt it, and
pre-
pared for the encounter. 56 He will do
every thing to regain you," said Mrs.
Seymour, "but I have confidence in
your present feelings. Shew him, that

child." Lady Avondale had taken Gle-
narvon's ring from her finger, she had
placed upon her neck a row of pearls
her husband had given her, upon the
eve of her marriage, and thus decorated,
she thought her heart had likewise re-
turned to its ancient allegiance.
Lady Avondale entered the dining-
room. Lord Glenarvon passed her at
the moment; he was in earnest conver-
sation with Lady Margaret, and slightly
bowed to her. She was surprised, she
had expected kindness and contrition.
She was, however, resolved to act up to
the very strictest bounds which decorum
prescribed. With
With some haughtiness,
some appearance at least of dignity, she
seated herself as far from him as he
could desire, and by addressing herself
calmly but entirely to others, she sought
to attain that look of unconcern, which
he had so readily assumed.

Lady Ayondale retired to her room to
compose herself. Upon returning, the
large society were employed either with
billiards, cards, or work-except a few
of the men, amongst whom she perceived
Lord Glenarvon. Had he refrained
from speaking to her, she could have
borne it,- had he even looked as grave,
as ill as usual; but an unusual flow of
spirits--a peculiar appearance of health,
had taken place of that languor, to which
he was at times subject.
The evening and the supper passed
without his saying one word in apology
for his unkindness, or in the least at-
tending to her increasing irritation.
Lady Avondale affected unconcern as
well as she could, but it looked like
any thing else; and in the morning she
awoke but to suffer new humiliations.
She saw him smile as he named her in a
whisper to Lady Trelawney. She heard
him talk to others upon subjects he had
once spoken of only to herself. Imme-

diately upon this apparent rupture, new
hopes arose; new claims were consi-
dered; and that competition for his fa-
vour, which had ceased, began again.
Lady Trelawney Jaughed and talked
with him; at times turning her eye trium-
phantly towards Calantha. Sophia con-
fided her opinions to his breast; affected
to praise him for his present conduct,
and the tear of agony, which fell from
Calantha's eye, excited at least as much
indignation as it deserved.
* I have sacrificed too much for one
who is heartless," she said; " but, thank
Heaven, it is yet time for amendment."
Alas! Lady Avondale knew not, as she
uttered these words, that there is no mo-
ment in which it is so difficult to act with
becoming dignity and firmness, as that
in which we are piqued and trampled
upon by the object of our devotion. Gle.
narvon well knew this, and smiled at the
pang he inflicted, as it proved his
power,
and exhibited its effects to all. Lady

Avondale summoned to her aid even her
faultsthe spirit, the pride of her charac-
ter, her very vanity; and rested her
hopes of firmness upon her contempt for
weakness, her abhorrence of vice. She
looked upon him, and saw his attempts
to wound, to humiliate, to grieve; and
she despised the man who could have res
course to every petty art to torture one
for whom he had professed so much. If
he wished to expose her weakness to every
eye, too well he had succeeded.

CHAPTER XXIII.'
Few women know how to conceal suc-
cessful love, but none can conceal their
doubt, resentment and jealousy. Men
can do both, and both without a struggle.
They feel less, and fear more. But this
was not the case with Lord Glenarvon,
nor did he wish to appear indifferent;
he only wished Calantha to feel his
power, and he delighted in the exhibi.
tion of it. In vain she had formed the
best resolutions, they were now all ren-
dered useless. Lord Glenarvon had fore-
stalled her wise intention, no coldness
-no indifference she could assume,
had equalled that, which he either af-
fected or felt.
Upon the bosom of Mrs. Seymour,
Calantha wept for her fault; it was infa-
tuation, she said, she was cured: the

221
lesson, though somewhat harsh, had not
been fruitless. Again, she made every
promise, which affection and repentance
could suggest. She heard the name of
her husband pronounced, and longed to
throw herself before him, and commend
herself to his mercy. I do repent, in-
deed I do, said Calantha, repeatedly in
the course of the day; and she thought
her penitence had been sincere. Hum-
bled now, and gentle, she thought only
of pleasing her aunt, Lord Avondale,
and her friends. She was desired to play
during the evening: to shew her ready
obedience she immediately obeyed. Lord
Glenarvon was in an adjoining room ;
he entered when she began : springing
up, Lady Avondale left the harp; then,
seeing Lord Avondale surprised, she pre-
pared to tune it.
Lord Glenarvon approached and of-
fered her his hand, she refused it. "Will
you play ?" he saidand she turned the
key with so much force that it broke the

chords asunder. " You have wound
them too tight, and played upon them
too often," he said. " Trifle not with
me thus, cannot play now," she re-
plied. " Leave me, I entreat you."
You know not what you have done,
he replied. " All I askall I implore is,
will neither come near me,
nor speak to me more, for I am mad."
" Women always recover from these pa-
roxysms," said he, gaily. Calautha at-
tempted to play, and did so extremely ill,
after which she went to bed, happier, it
must be owned, for she had seen in Lord
Glenarvon's inanner that he was not in-
different, and this rendered it more easy
for her to appear so,
The next morning Lady Avondale
went out immediately after breakfast,
without speaking to Lord Glenarvon. He
twice attempted it, but with real anger,
she refused to hear him. It was late in
the day, when, having sought for her
before dinner, he at length found her

" There is no need for this," she said
coldly.
" I will not rise till you forgive me.
If you knew all-if...... but can you
indeed believe me indifferent, or cold?
Look at me once: raise your eyes and be-
hold him, who lives but in you." "All
this is useless, you have grieved me; but
I do not mean to reproach; the idle com-
plainings of a woman are ever useless."
- To think that she suffers," said Gle-
narvon,
" is enough. Look once-once
only, look upon me." " Let us part in
peace," she replied: " I have no com-
plaint to make, I have nothing to for-
give." " Raise your eyes, and look-Ca-
lantha, look once on me."

She turned to him, she saw that face
whose every feature was engraved deep
in her very heartthat smile of sweet-
ness--that calm serenity, she had not
power to speak to think ; and yet reco-
vering from this strange enchantment,
-" How could you betray me?" she
said. I judge you not, but I can never
feel either interest, or friendship again.
" Yet," said Glenarvon gravely, "I
need both at this time, for I am miserable
and ill too, only I do not wish to ex-
cite your compassion by these arts, and I
had rather die unforgiven, than use any
towards you.
" Wherefore did you betray me?"
". Can you ask? I was deeply wounded.
It is not enough for me that you love
me, all must and shall know it. I will
make every sacrifice for you-run every
risk ; but every risk and every sacrifice
must be shared." " Whatever my feel-
ings may be," she answered coldly, "you
shall never subdue me again. I may be

You may torture me as you please, if yo

" Calantha," said Lord Glenarvon,
taking her hand firmly, and smiling
half scornfully, "you shall be my slave.
I will mould you as I like; teach you to
think but with my thoughts, to act but
with my feelings, you shall wait nor mur-

nearer. "I never will." 66 And 'till

Yes,

I have won, you cannot reclaim; and
though the hand be thus denied me, if
the heart be mine of what avail? I love
you to madness, he said, and you distract
me. Trust yourself entirely to me,
it is the only means of safety left.
Calantha, I will do for you, what no man
ever did before. If it destroy me, I will
never lead you to guilt, only rely upon me,

she said, " of our being separated for ever,
of making my aunt miserable. Of
"Nonsense, child, I never risk any thing,
it was necessary your aunt should know;
and the fear of losing you entirely will
make her readily consent to my seeing
you more than ever."
" Oh Glenarvon,
what guilt! Think not that my attachment
is such as to bear it." << It shall bear all
things," said Glenarvon; " but if you
sacrifice what I desire, I will conquer
every wrong feeling for your sake. Our
friendship will then be innocent." " Not

thoughts. If love should triumph-if
you feel half for me, what I feel from
my soul for you, then you shall accom-
pany me from hence. Avondale may ea-
sily find another wife, but the world
contains for me but one Calantha."
Lady Avondale felt happy.-Shame on
the guilty heart that dared to feel so !
but alas, whilst Glenaryon thus addressed
her, she did feel most happy. In a mo-
ment, the gloom that had overshadowed
her future hopes, was dispelled. She
saw her lover-her friend, more than
ever united to her. He consented even
to respect what remaining virtue she had
left, and from his gentle, his courteous
words, it was not her wish to escape.
Yet still she resolved to leave him. Now,
that peace was again restored, that
her irritated mind was calm, that her va-
nity was flattered, and her pride satisfied,
now the admonitions of her aunt recur.

ed; and even while her heart beat fondest
for him, she pronounced her own doom,
and declared to him that she would tear
herself away from him for ever. u Per-
haps this must be," he said, after a mo-
ment's
pause; " but not yet, Calantha:
ah! not yet." As he spoke his tears fell
upon her hand.-Oh! had he not thus
wept, Calantha had not loved him.
Struggling with his feelings for her, he
generously resolved to save, to spare
her. " Remember this," he said,
" when they condemn me-remember,
Calantha, what I have done for you;
how I have respected you; and let not
their idle clamours prevail."
Lady Avondale was too happy to feel
Glenarvon loved, as she never
had been loved before, every hour-
every moment of each passing day he
seemed alone intent, and occupied with
her; he wrote his minutest thoughts ;
he counselled, he did not command.
He saw that power, ambition, was her
vain.

ruling passion, and by affecting to be
ruled, he completely mastered her-in
word, in look, in thought, he was de-
voted to her. Other men think only of
themselves; Glenarvon conquered him-
self a thousand times for her. What is
a momentary, a degrading passion to the
enjoyment she felt in his society? It
only lowers the object of its fancy, he
sought to raise her even in her own es-
teem. Forgive her, pity us," he said,
addressing Mrs. Seymour, who saw in a
moment, with alarm, their reconcilia-
tion. " Drive us not to despair, I will
respect herwill preserve her, if you
do not attempt to tear her from me; but
dread the violence of madness, if you
reduce us to the last rash step. Oh dread
the violence of a mad and incurable at-
tachment.
Calantha's sole attention was now to
hide from those it might grieve, the
change which a few days had again
wrought. She appeared at dinner, she

seated herself opposite to Glenarvon.
There was no look of exultation in his
countenance, his eyes met her's mourn-
fully. The diamond bracelets that adorn-
ed her arms, had been given her by him;
thechain and lucket, which contained his
dark hair, had been placed around her
neck in token of his regard; the clasp that
fastened the band around her waist, was
composed of the richest jewels brought
by him from distant countries ; and the
heart that was thus girt round and en-
circled with his gifts, beat only for him,
regardless of every other tie.

gazing on her in agony.

to sever us, oh my aunt, you may be the
means of driving two desperate minds
to misery and madness.
It may appear strange, but all this time
the world and friends appeared more
fond of Calantha than at any other: they
courted, they flattered herthey no longer
feigned that Glenarvon was insincere-
and they seemed to gaze with new intent,
new admiration upon the object of his
attention. Never was she apparently so
beloved, so sought afterin particular by
the Princess of Madagascar, her party
and her followers.

: CHAPTER XXIV.
A few days previous to this quarrel and
reconciliation, Sir Everard St. Clare had
been thrown from his horse in conse-
quence of a tumult, in which, having
beheld his niece, a dimness came over
his eyes, and he was no longer able to
support himself. The fall, it was feared,
had injured his spine. He was confined
to his own room; but no one could pre-
vail upon him to lie upon his bed, or
admit Lady St. Ciare, who sat continually
sobbing at his door, lamenting her con-
duct and imploring his pardon.
Whatever were the sufferings of Lady
Avondale's mind at this time, she yet re-
solved to visit this afflicted family, as she
had a real regard for the doctor in spite
of his singularities. She was preparing

speak with her. Her heart beat upon
hearing the name. Clarence of Costolly:
but
upon
entering the room she soon dis-
covered, in the personage before her,
the doctor's unhappy niece, Elinor, upon
whom every counsel was lost -- every
menace and punishment powerless.
Elinor had entered the castle with a
look of bold defiance; yet her lips trem-
bled, as she twice vainly attempted to ad-
dress Lady Avondale, who moved for
ward to enquire the cause of her visit.
" I am come," said Miss St. Clare with
haughty insolence," to ask a favour of

cle is ill: he has sent to see me. This
may be a mere feint to draw me into his

more set foot into his house:"

As she spoke, a letter dropped from

every fierce expression had left Eli-
nor's countenance: with a subdued and
mournful air, she turned aside as if
ashamed of the weakness she had shewn;
then, taking a little miniature and chain
from her neck, " He sent for this too,

pitancy she was not prepared for, had
left her; Lady Avondale arrived at the
door of the Castle only in time to see
her gallop off.

continued smiling archly.
"I blame you not," she replied; " but
I pity her. Yet wherefore not shew her
some little kindness?" "A look, a word
would bring her back to me. She mis-
represents everything: she deceives

LADY AVONDALE sent the portrait to
Miss St. Clare, and vainly endeavoured
to restore her to her uncle's protection.
She again spoke of her to Glenarvon.
" Cannot I yet save her?" she said ;
" Cannot I take her home, and sooth
her mind, and bring her back to virtue
and to peace ?" " Never more," he re-
plied :" it is past: her heart is perverted."
Is there no recall from such perver-
sion ?" " None, none, my friend." His
countenance, whilst he spoke, assumed
much of bitterness.  Oh there is no re-
call from guilty love. The very nature
of it precludes amendment,
amendment, as these

regarded by you as a crime-how you
shuddered at the bare idea of guilt. Now
you can hear its language with interest: it

followed. See and acknowledge then,

power I hold over your heart ; and
yield to what is already destined. You
imagine, when I speak of guilt, that you
can shrink from me, that you can hate
me ;
but

have lost the power, and let
me add, the right : you are become a
sharer in that iniquity-you must be a
sharer in my fate. The actual commis-
sion of crime still excites horror ; but do
you remember when you shuddered at
every approach to it? And cannot he
who has triumphed thus far gain all,

you, my heart will break in the struggle;
but if I give way....
" Oh then," she cried, " then are we
ruined for ever and for ever.

me to wrong. What shall ever remune-
rate us for the loss of self-approbation?
He smiled bitterly. "It is," he said, "a
possession, I never yet cared greatly to
retain." " And is self-approbation the
greatest of all earthly enjoyments ? Is
man so independent, so solitary a being,
that the consciousness of right will suffice

CHAPTER XXIV.
STRANGE as it may appear, a husband,
unless his eyes are opened by the confes-
sion of his guilty partner, is the last to
believe in her misconduct; and when the
world has justly stamped disgrace upon
her name, he shares in his wife's disho-
nour, for he is supposed by all to know,
and to connive at her crime. But though
this be a painful truth, experience every
day confirms, that a noble and confiding
husband is too often, and too easily de-
ceived. In the marriage state there is
little love and much habitual confidence.
We see neglect and severity on the part
of the man ; and all the petty arts and
cunning wiles on the side of his more
frail and cowardly partner. Indifference
first occasions this blindness; infatuation
increases it; and in proportion as all in-

terest is lost for the object who so de-
ceives, such husband lives the dupe of
the wife, who despises him for his blind-
ness, and dies in the same happy illusion,
in which he has so long passed away his
life. He even presses to his heart, as he
leaves them his possessions, the children
of some deceitful friend, who, under the
mask of amity to himself, has fed upon
his fortunes, and seduced the affections
of his wife.
Disgusting as such picture may be
thought, is it not, unhappily for us, daily
exhibited to the public view ? and shall
they who tolerate and see it, and smile
in scorn at its continued and increasing

was he in mind, in person, and heart
from other men ! His very nobleness of
soul prevented him from conceiving what
some perhaps had soon observed, and
wounded pride estranged him from a
woman who now appeared avowedly to
shun his society.
His cheeks were red with the hue of
health ; his eyes shone bright with spark-
ling intelligence; he laughed the loud
heart's laugh at every merry jest, and
slept with unbroken slumbers, the sleep
of the righteous and the just. Calantha
looked upon him as we look afar off upon
some distant scene were we once dwelt,
and from which we have long departed.

and pleasures; but we turn from it with

presence, and replied to his few enquiries
with all the apparent insensibility of
a proud and offended mind : yet such is
the imperfection of human nature, that it
is possible Lord Avondale cherished her
the more for her very faults. Certain
it is, that he felt proud of her, and
every casual praise which, even from the
lips of strangers, was bestowed on Calan-
tha, gave him more delight than any pro-
fession, however flattering, that could
have been made to himself. To see her
blest was his sole desire; and when he
observed the change in her manner and
spirits, it grieved, it tortured him :-he
sought, but in vain, to remove it. At
length business of importance called him
from her. Write," he said, at parting;
" write, as you once used. My presence has
given but little satisfaction to you ; I dare
not hope my absence will create pain."
Farewell," said Lady Avondale, with as-
sumed coldness. " There are false hearts
in this world, and crimes are enacted,

Henry, at home ofttimes, as well as
abroad. Confide in no one. Believe not
what your own eyes perceive. Life is but
as the shadow of a dream. All here is
illusion. We know not whom we love."
How happy some may imagine-how
happy Calantha must have felt now that
Lord Avondale was gone. Far from it.
She, for the first time, saw her conduct
in its true light. His departure filled
her with gloom : every little act of kind-
ness he had once shewed her recurred;
all his manly virtues : his open unsuspi-
cious nature :-it was as if her last hope
of safety were cut off ; as if her good an-
gel had for ever abandoned her; and with
a reserve and prudence, which in his
presence, she had failed to assume, she
now turned with momentary horror from
the near approach of crime. The
thought of leaving her home and Lord
Avondale, had not indeed ever seriously
occurred, although she constantly listened
to the proposal of doing so, and acted in

249
a way to render such step necessary.
She had seen Lord Avondale satisfied,
and whilst Lord Glenarvon was near her,
only momentary fits of remorse obtruded
-10 lasting fear occurred-she formed
no view for the future. To die with him,
or to live but for that moment of time,
which seemed to concentrate every pos-
sible degree of happiness, this was the
only desire of which she had felt capable.
But now, she shuddered-she paused :
-the baseness of betraying a noble,
confiding husband, struck her mind, and
filled it with alarm ; but such alarm
-
peared only to accelerate her doom. - If
I can resist and remain without deeper
guilt, I will continue here," she cried ;
"and if I fail in the struggle, I will fly
with Glenarvon."-This false reasoning
consoled her. A calm, more dangerous
than the preceding agitation, followed
this resolve.
Glenarvon had changed entirely in his
manner, in his character ; all art, all

attempt at wounding or tormenting was
passed. He seemed himself the sufferer,
and Calantha, the being upon whose at
tachment he relied, he was as fearful of
vexing her, as she was of losing him.
On earth he appeared to have no thought
but her; and when again and again he
repeated, "I never loved as I do now,-
oh never." It
may be doubted whether
that heart exists which could have dis-
believed him. Others who affect only,
are ever thoughtful for themselves; and
some plan, some wary and prudential
contrivance frequently appears, even in
the very height of their passion. The
enjoyment of the moment alone, and not
the future continuance of attachment,
employs their hopes. But Glenarvon
seemed more anxious to win every affec-
tion of her heart; to fix every hope of
her soul upon himself; to study every
feeling as it arose, sift every motive, and
secure his empire upon all that was most
durable, 'than to win her in the usual

251
acceptation of the word.
And even
though jealous that she should be ready
to sacrifice every principle of honour
and virtue, should he demand it, he had
a pride in saving her from that guilt into
which she was now voluntarily preparing
to plunge.
Day by day, the thought of leaving all
for him appeared more necessary and
certain.She no longer shuddered at
the mention of it. She heard him de-
scribe their future life  the countries
they should visit; and it even pleased
her to see that he was sincere in his
intentions. No disguise was now re-
quired : he called not the fire that burnt
in his heart by the name of friendship
and of interest : " it is love," he cried,
" most guilty  most unconquerable.
Hear it, mark it, and yet remain without
alarm. Ah! think not that to share
it alone is required; your soul must
exult, that it has renounced every hope
beyond ; and Glenarvon's love must

entirely fill your affections. Nay more,
you shall sue for the sacrifice which is
demanded of others. Yourself shall
wish it ; for I will never wrest from you
that which, unless freely given, is little
worth, Perhaps, even when you desire
to be mine, I, even I shall spare you, till
maddening with the fierce fires that de-
vour us, you abandon all for me."
He now opened to her the dark re-
cesses of his heart; deeds of guilt con-
cealed from other eyes, he now dwelt
upon to Calantha with horrid pleasure.
" Shrink not! start not!" he exclaimed,
when she trembled at each new confes
sion. "Proud, even of my crimes, shalt
thou become, poor victim of thy mad
infatuation ; this is the man for whom
thou leavest Avondale! Mark me, Ca-
lantha,view me as I am, nor say
here-
after that Glenarvon could
could deceive."
" And do you never feel remorse ?" she
said.-" Never." "Do you believe ? -"

His countenance for one moment altered.
"I know not," he said, and he was grave.
66 Oh must I become as hardened as
wicked," she said, bursting into tears. He
pressed her mournfully to his bosom.
Weep," he replied, " I like to see your
tears; they are the last tears of expiring
virtue. Henceforward you will shed no
more."
Those who have given way to the vio-
lence of any uncontrouled passion know
that during its influence, all other consi-
derations vanish. It is of little use to
upbraid or admonish the victim who
pursues his course: the fires that urge
him on to his ruin, prevent his return.
A kind word, an endearing smile, may
excite one contrite tear; but he ne-
ver pauses to reflect, or turns his eyes
from the object of his pursuit. In vain

bitter sarcasms of friends and depen-
dants. Misfortunes, poverty, pain, even
to the rack, are nothing if he obtain
his view. It is a madness that falls upon
the brain and heart. All is at stake for
that one throw; and he who dares all,
is desperate, and cannot fear.
It was
phrenzy, not love, that raged in Calan-
tha's bosom.
To the prayers of a heart-broken pa-
rent, Lady Avondale opposed the ago-
nizing threats of a distempered mind.
" I will leave you all, if you take him
from me. On earth there is nothing left
me but Glenarvon.-Oh name not virtue
and religion to me.What are its hopes,
its promises, if I lose him." The fever
of her mind was such, that she could not
for one hour rest: he saw the dreadful
power he had gained, and he lost no
opportunity of encreasing it. Ah did
he share it? In language the sweetest,

and the most persuasive, he worked upon
her passions, till he inflamed them be-

held her to his bosom, and breathed vows
of ardent burning love. 6 This is what
moralists rail at, and account degrading.

and fly me; leave me alone, as before I
found thee. Desert me, and thy father
and relations shall bless thee for the sa-
crifice: and thy God, who redeemed thee,

bitter taunts he smiled as he thus spoke:

CHAPTER XXVI.
.... That
One night, as she retired to her room,
Gondimar met her in the passage, leading
from Mrs. Seymour's apartment. "Lost
woman," he cried, fiercely seizing her,

his hand, there is blood on it! ....
night was a horrid night to Calantha ;
she slept, and the dream that oppressed
her, left her feeble and disordered. The
ensuing day she walked by the shores of
the sea: she bared her forehead to the
balmy gales. She looked upon every
cheerful countenance in hopes of im-
bibing happiness from the smile that
brightened theirs, but it was vain.
Upon returning, she met Glenarvon.
They walked together to the mountains :
they conversed; and half in jest she asked
him for his hand, -" not that hand,"

Are you
she said, " give me your right hand ; I
wish to look upon it."
"I believe I
must refuse you, your manner is so
strange," he replied. " Do if you please,

It was a dream, a horrid dream, which
made me ill last night. The effect,
perhaps of what you told me yesterday."

deeply, and this was one. I almost fear
" I too have dreamt," he
said, "shall I repeat my dream?" " Not
now, I am too sad for it: but mine, if
indeed you wish it, you may hear."
"I dreamt (but it is absurd to repeat
it) that I was in some far distant country.
I was standing by the sea, and the fresh
air blew gently upon me, even as it does
now;.... it was night.
There was a
dirge sung as in monasteries, and friars
passed to and fro, in long procession
before me. Their torches now and then

lighted the vaults, and the chaunt was
mournful, and repeatedly interrupted-
all this was confused. That which was
more striking, I remember better. A
monk in black stood before me; and
whilst he gazed upon me, he grew to
a height unusual and monstrous : he
seemed to possess some authority over
mc, and he questioned me as to my
conduct and affections. I tried to dis-
guise from him many thoughts which
disturbed me; I spoke in a hurried
manner of others; I named you not. He
shook his head; and then looking fiercely
at me, bade me beware of Clarence de
Ruthven (for so he called you). I never
can forget his voice.
" All others you
may see, you may converse with ; but,
Calantha, beware," he said, " of Clarence
de Ruthven: he is a.... he is a...."
" A what?" enquired Glenarvon eagerly.
6 I dare not continue."
Glenarvon, however, insisted upon
hearing this.
" I never, never can tell,"

GLENARVON.
said Calantha, for you look so much
offended-80 serious. After all, what
nonsense it is thus to repeat a dream.'
" That which seems to have made no
little impression upon Lady Avondale's
mind, cannot fail of awakening some
interest in mine. It is a very strange
vision," he continued, fixing his eyes on
her. " These idle phantasies are but
repetitions of the secret workings of
the mind. Your own suspicions have
coloured this. Go on, let me hear all."
" Indeed I forget ;-it was confused. I
seemed in my dream to doubt his words.
Only this I remember :-he bade me
ask you for your hand-your right hand;
he said there was a stain of blood on it;
and in a low solemn tone, he added, he
will not give it you ; there is a mark
upon it; he dare not give it you;' and I
awoke."
" To think me every thing, however
bad, that your monk may chuse to make
me out. Well foolish dreamer, look at

!
my hand: say, is there a mark on it?"
The laugh which accompanied this
ques-
tion was forced. Calantha started back,
as she observed that almost demoniac
smile. His eyes glared upon her with
fierce malignity; his livid cheeks became
pale; and over his forehead, an air of
deep distress struggled with the violence
of passion, till all again was calm, cold,
and solemn, as before. She was sur-
prised at his manner; for although he
made light of it, he was certainly dis-
pleased, and much moved by this foolish
occurrence.
Glenarvon continued absent and irri-
table during the whole of the walk ; nor
ceased enquiring oftentimes that day res-
pecting what she had said. It appeared
to her less extraordinary, when she re-
membered the circumstances concerning
Linden : yet he had so often acknow-
ledged that event to her,--so often spoke
of him with pity and regret, that had he
merely thought she alluded to such

transaction, he had been proud of the
effort he had made to save him, and of
the blood he had shed upon that account.
Whatever then occasioned this strange
perturbation ;-however far imagination
might wander, even though it pictured
crimes unutterable,-under Glenarvon's
form, all might be forgiven. Passion,
perhaps, had misled its victim, and who
can condemn another when maddening
under its trying influence! It was not
for Calantha to judge him. It was her
misfortune to feel everything with such
acute and morbid sensibility, that what
in others had occasioned a mere moment
of irritation, shook every fibre around
her heart. The death of a bird, if it had
once been dear, made her miserable; and
the slightest insult, as she termed it,
rendered her furious. Severity but caused
a desperate resistance, and kindness alone
softened or subdued her. Glenarvon
played upon every passion to the utmost;
and when he beheld her, lost beyond all
recall he seemed to love her most.
## p. 263 (#579) ############################################
GLENARVON.
263
How vain it were to attempt to paint
the struggles, the pangs, the doubts, the
fears, the endless unceasing irritation of a
mind disordered by guilty love. Remorse
had but little part now: passion soon
absorbed every feeling, every hope; and
to retain Glenarvon was there anything
his weak and erring victim had refused?
Alas! the hour came, when even to leave
all and follow him appeared incumbent.
The very ruin such conduct must occasion
to Calantha, engaged her more eagerly to
agree to the proposal.
Lady Margaret was now, at times, en-
gaged with him in secret discourses, which
occasioned much apparent dissention be-
tween them; but Calantha was not the
subject. " He has the heart of a fiend,"
Lady Margaret would often exclaim, as
she left him; and Calantha could per-
ceive that, with all her power of dissimu-
lation ; she was more moved-more irri-
tated by him, than she ever had been
before by any other. He also spoke of

Lady Margaret with bitterness, and the
asperity between them grew to such
height, that Calantha apprehended the
most fatal effects from it. Still, however,
the Duke wished to conciliate a danger-
ous and malignant foe; and though his
visits to the Castle were short, compared
with what they had been, they were as
frequent as ever.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
It happened one morning that Calantha,
having been walking with Lord Gle.
narvon, upon her return entered the
library rather unexpectedly, and per-
ceived Zerbellini with the Count Gondi.
mar and Lady Margaret. They all seemed
in some confusion at her entrance. She
was however too deeply occupied with
other thoughts to enquire into their
strange embarrassment; and looking at
Glenarvon, she watched the varying ex-
pression of his countenance with anxious
solicitude. At dinner, that day, he seated
himself near her. Mrs. Seymour's eyes
were filled with tears. " It is too late,
he said, in a low whisper : " be firm : it
makes me mad to see the arts that are
used to separate us. Speak only to me
think only of me. What avail their frowns?

their reproaches? I am dearer, am I not
than all?"
Dinner being over, Calantha avoided
her aunt's presence. She perceived it,
and approaching her, My child," she
said, " do not fly me. My unhappy Ca-
lantha you will break my heart if you
act thus."
At that moment Lady Mar-
garet joined them; " Ask Calantha," she
said, "now ask her about the pearl neck-
lace."
The pearl necklace in question was
one which Lord Avondale had given
her on the eve of her marriage. She
was now accused of having given it to
Lord Glenarvon. It is true that she had
placed in his hands all the jewels of
which she was mistress, that his presents
might not exceed in value such as she
had power to offer; they had been too
magnificent otherwise for her to receive;
and though only dear because they were
his gifts, yet to have taken them without
return had been more pain than pleasure:
## p. 267 (#583) ############################################
GLENARVON.
267
it now;
one smile of his were worth them all
one approving look, far dearer. This gift
of Lord Ayondale's, however, she had con-
sidered as sacred, and neither Lord Gle-
naryon's love, nor her own perversion,
had led her to touch it. She had received
it when innocent and true; it was pain to
her even to look
upon
and when
she heard the accusation made against
her, she denied it with considerable
warmth; for guilt but irritates the
mind, and renders the perpetrator im-
patient of accusation.
" This indigna-
tion is rather ill-timed however," said
Lady Margaret, sarcastically: "there are
things more sacred than pearls thrown
away; and if the necklace has not been
given, it is, I believe, the only thing,
retained."
Such unpleasant conversation was now
interrupted by Sophia, who entered the
room.-" The necklace is found," she
said;
" and who do you think had
taken it?" "I care not," said Calantha

proud and offended at their former sus-
picions. " Zerbellini !"
6. Oh impos-
"sible !" " Some of Lady Margaret's ser-
vants first suggested the possibility," said
Sophia. " His desk and wardrobe were
consequently examined, and scarce giv-
ing credit to the testimony of their sight,
the lost prize was discovered in his silken
vest.". Calantha indignantly resisted the
general belief that the boy was the real
culprit. Every one left the room, and
eagerly enquired into the whole affair.
" If ocular proof be necessary to con-
vince you," said Lady Margaret, return-
ing to Calantha and leading her from the
billiard room, accompanied by many
others, "you shall now have it; and see,
she cried,
pausing as she entered the
boy's apartment, "how soundly crimi-
nals can sleep!" Aye, and how tran-
quil and innocent they can appear," con-
tinued Gondimar smiling as he stood by
the side of the page's bed. Glenarvon's
countenance, rendered more terrible by

the glimmering of the lamp, changed at
these words.
There, sleeping in unsuspicious peace,
lay the youthful Zerbellini, his cheeks
blooming, his rich auburn hair flowing
in clusters about his face, his arms thrown
over his head with infantine and playful
grace. " If he be guilty," said Calan-
tha, looking earnestly at him, "how
much one may be deceived !" " How
much one may be deceived !" said
the Duke turning back and glancing
his eye on the trembling form of his
daughter. The necklace was produced :
but a look of doubt was still seen on every
countenance, and Lord Glenarvon, sternly
approaching Gondimar, asked him whe-
ther some villain might not have placed
it there, to screen himself and to ruin
the hoy? " I should be loath," replied
the Italian, with an affectation of humi-
lity, very loath to imagine that such a
wretch could exist.' A glance of bitter
scorn, was the only reply vouchsafed.

" We can see the boy, alone, in the
morning," said Sophia in a low whisper
to Calantha; " there is more in this than
we know of. Be calm; fear not, and to-
morrow, we can with caution discover
all." 66 Do not talk of to-morrow," re-
plied Calantha angrily: " an hour, a mo-
ment is too long to bear injustice. I will
plead with my father." So saying, she
followed him, urging him to hear her.
" Consider the youth of the child," she
said, "even if guilty, remember he is
but young." " His youth but aggravates
the crime," said the Duke, haughtily re-
pulsing her.
" When the young can
act basely, it shews that the heart's core
is. black. Plead not for him: look to
yourself, child," he fiercely cried, and
left her. The time was past when a
prayer of Calantha's was never breathed
in vain ; and struggling with a thousand
strong emotions, she fled to her own
room, and gave veut to the contending

GLENARVON.
271
passions, by which she was so greatly
agitated.
That night Lord Glenarvon slept not
at the Castle. Zerbellini's guilt was now
considered as certain. The Duke himself
awakening the child, asked him if he
had taken the necklace. He coloured
extremely; hid his face, and then ack-
nowledged the offence. He was ques-
tioned respecting his motive; but he
evaded, and would not answer. His doom
was therefore fixed. "I will take him
from hence," said Gondimar. " He must
not remain here a single hour; but no se-
verity shall be shewn to so youthful an
offender."
It was at that dark still hour of the
night, when spirits that are troubled
wake, and calmer eyes are closed in sleep,
that Lady Margaret and Count Gondimar,
entering Zerbellini's room, asked him if
he were prepared.
- For what?" ex-
claimed the boy, clasping his hands to-
gether. 66 Dim!. eccelenza che vuoi !

Margaret. "I will not, cannot go.
" " Will
no one pity me? Oh Gondimar ! are

Help me to bear him away," said
Gondimar to Lady Margaret.
Glenarvon should hear us?" and force
was used to bear the struggling boy from
the Castle ?
In the morning Calantha was informed,
by Lady Margaret, of the whole transac-
tion. She said, however, that on account
of his youth, no other notice would be
taken of his fault, than that of his being
immediately sent back to his parents at
Florence.
Calantha was unquiet and restless the
whole of the day.  The absence of your
page," said Lady Margaret sarcastically,
as she passed her, " seems to have caused
you some little uneasiness. Do you ex-
pect to find him in any of these rooms?
Have you not been to Craig Allen Bay,
or the Wizzard's Glen? Has the Chapel
been examined thoroughly?"

Lord Glenarvon and a servant, gave a
general alarm.-" Ruffians," said Gon-
dimar, fiercely glancing his eyes around,
" attacked our carriage, and forced the
child from my grasp.
" Where?
how?" " About twenty miles hence,"
said the Italian. 66. Curse on the dark-
ness, which prevented my defending my-
self as I ought." " Those honorable
wounds," said Glenarvon, prove suffi-
ciently that the Count wrongs himself."
" Trelawny," whispered Gondimar, " do
me a favour. Fly to the stables ; view
well Glenarvon's steed ; mark if it bear
any appearance of recent service: I strong-
ly suspect him: and but for his presence
at these gates, so calm, so cleanly ac-
coutred, I could have staked my soul it
was by his arm I received these wounds."

lowed with your carriage." Glenaryon
smiled scornfully on the officious Lord :
then fixing his eye sternly upon Gondi-
mar, "I read your suspicions," he said
in a low voice, as he passed : " they are
just. Now, serpent, do thy worst: thou
art at my mercy.'

plied Gondimar, grinding his teeth.

tated, while every trembling nerve attes-
ted the agony he endured. 66 For God's
sake be silent. I will meet you at St.
Alvin's to-night: you shall investigate the
whole of my conduct, and you will not
find in it aught to give you just offence."
" The ground upon which you stand
has a crimsoned dye," said Gondimar,
with a malicious smile: " look at your
hand, my lord...." Glenarvon, faint and
exhausted, scarce appeared to support
himself any longer; but suddenly col-
lecting all his forces together, with a

equal to endure, he sprung upon the
Italian, and asked him fiercely the mean-
ing of his words. Gondimar now, in his
turn, trembled; Lord Trelawney inter-
posed; and peace was apparently restored.

CHAPTER XXIX.
The scene of the morning had caused con-
siderable speculation. The count, though
slightly indisposed-appeared at dinner :
after which Lord Glenarvon took a hasty
leave. It need not be said what Calan-
tha's feelings were.
Gondimar and Lady
Margaret talked much together, during
the evening. Calantha wrote in anxiety
to Glenarvon. No one was now near to
comfort her. As she retired slowly and
sadly to her room in dreadful suspense,
O'Kelly, Glenarvon's servant, passed her
on the stairs. The sight of his counte-
nance was joy to her. My lord waits
to see you, at the back door on the ter-
race," he said, as he affected to hasten
away with a portmanteau on his shoulder.
She heard and marked the words, and
watching an opportunity hastened to the

door. It was locked ; but O'Kelly awai-
ted her and opened it. To be in the
power of this man was nothing: he was
Glenarvon's long tried and faithful ser-
vant; yet she feit confused when she met
his eyes ; and thought it an indignity
that her secret had been betrayed to him.
Glenarvon, however, had commanded her
to trust him ; and every command of his
she too readily obeyed.
My lord is
going," said the man. 66 Where ?" she
cried ; in the utmost agony.
- From
Ireland," said O'Kelly. " But he waits for
you by yonder tree,' " she hastened for-
ward.
" Ah speak to me," she said, upon
seeing him : "my heart is tortured ; con-
fide at least in me : let me have the com-
fort of believing that I contribute to the
happiness of one human being upon earth;
Iwho cause the misery of so many.

frail, fading flowret," he said, in a hollow
mournful tone-ah look not on me, nor
thus waste thy sweets upon a whited se-
pulchre, full of depravity and death.
Could'st thou read my heart-couldst
thou see how it is seared, thou would'st
tremble and start back with horror," "I
have bound myself to you," she replied,
" I am prepared for the worst : it cannot
be worse than the crime of which I am
guilty; grieve not then for me, I am
calm and happy- oh most happy, when
I am thus with you."
There is a look of anguish, such as a
slave might give when he betrays bis
mastersuch as a murderer in thought
might shew previous to the commission
of the bloody act, in presence of his
victim :-such a look, so sad, so terri-
ble, impressed a momentary gloom over
the beautiful countenance of Glenarvon.
Yes, when she said that she was happy,
at that very time he shrunk from the joy

she professed; for he knew that he had
led her to that which would blast all
peace in her heart for ever.
" Calantha," at length he said,
me pour out the agonies of my soul,
to my only friend. I have promised
your aunt to leave you: yes ; for thy
dear sake, I will go ; and none shall
hereafter say of me, that I led you to
share my ruined fortunes, or cast dis-
grace upon your name! Whatever my
wrongs and injuries, to others, let one
woman exist to thank me for her preser-
vation. It will break my heart; but I
will do it. You will hear dreadful things
of me, when I am away: you will learn
to hate, to curse me."
Glenarvon, never.

part, ere we forget every vow given
and received every cherished hope,
now blighted so cruelly for me, give
me some proof of your sincerity.
Others perhaps have been my victims;

I, alas ! am your's. You do not know,
you cannot know what I feel, you
have made me insensible to every other
pursuit. I seem to exist alone in you,
and for you, and can you, can you then
abandon ine? Go if it be your pleasure,
receive the applause of the world, of
friends, of those who affect the name ; and
when they hear that Glenarvon has filed, a
voluntary exile from his country without
one being to share his sorrows, perishing
by slow degrees of a cruel and dangerous
malady, which long has preyed upon his
constitution, then let your husband and
your aunt triumph in the reflection, that
they have hastened his doom. And you,
wretched victim, remember, that having
brightened for a few short hours my wea-
ry path, you have left me at the last more
lonely, more deserted even than when first
you appeared before me.
Oh Calantha,
let others mock at my agony, and doubt
the truth of one who has but too well
deserved their suspicions; but do not you

refuse to believe me. Young as I appear,
have made many miserable: but none
more so than myself; and, having cast
away every bright hope of dawning fame
and honor, I renounce even now the
only being who stands like a guardian an-
gel between myself and eternal perdition.
Oh canst thou doubt such love ? and yet
believing it, wilt thou consent that I should
thus abandon thee? I have sacrificed for
thee the strong passions that, like vultures,
prey upon my heart-fortune, honor,
every hope, even beyond the grave, for
thy happinessfor thy love! Ah say
eanst thou-wilt thou now abandou
me?"
" Glenarvon," Lady Avondale replied,
weeping bitterly. "Tam much more mise-
rable than you can be ; I have more love
for
you than it is possible you can feel for
me. I am not worth half what you inspire.
I never will consent to part." " Then
you must accompany me," he said, look-
ing her full in the face." Alas! if I do

thus, how will yourself despise me.
When society, and those whose opinion
you value, brand her name with infamy
who leaves all for you, where shall we
fily from dishonor? how will you bear
up under my disgrace?" "I will bear you
in my arms from the country that con-
demns youin my heart, your name
shall continue spotless as purity," he
replied," sacred as truth. I will resist
every opposition, and slay every one who
shall dare to breathe one thought against
you. For you I could renounce and des-
pise the world, and I will teach you that
love is in itself such ecstacy, that all
we leave for it is nothing to it."
"How can I resist you?" she answered.
"Allow me to hear and yet forget the les,
sons which you teach-let me look on
you, yet doubt you-let me die for you,
but not see you suffer thus." "Come with
me now-even now," said Glenarvon
fiercely;"I must make you mine before
we part: then I will trust you; but not

till then." He looked upon her with
scorn, as she struggled from his grasp.
Calantha, you affect to feel more than
I do," he cried; " but your heart could
not exist under what I endure. You
love!-- Oh you do not know how to
love." 66 Do not be so cruel to me: look
not so fierce Glenarvon. For you, for you, I
havetempted the dangers of guilt; for you,
I have trembled and wept; and, believe
it, for you I will bear to die." "Then give
yourself to me: this very hour be mine."
" And I am your's for ever:" " But it
must be your own free act and deed. Fear
not; Lady Margaret is in my power; I am
appointed to an interview with herto-mor-
row; and your aunt dares not refuse you,
if
you say that you will see me.
.
It is on
your firmness I rely: be prudent: it is
but of late I counsel it. Deceit is indeed
foreign to my nature ; but what disguise
would I not assume to see you?"
O'Kelly interrupted this conference
by whispering something in his ear.--

" I will attend her instantly." " Whom?"
said Calantha. 6 Oh no one." "Ah
speak truly: tell me what mean those
words--those mysterious looks: you
smile : that moon bears witness against
you; tell me all."
" I will trust you,
said Glenarvon. " Oh, my Lord, for
Heaven's sake!" said O'Kelly interfering,
" remember your vows, I humbly en-
treat."
6 Hear me," said Glenarvon, in
an authoritative tone, repulsing him.
"What are you all without me? Tremble
then at daring to advise, or to offend
me. Lady Avondale is mine ; we are
but one, and she shall know my secret,
though I were on the hour betrayed.".
"My Lady you are lost," said the man," if
you do not hasten home; you are watched:
I do implore you to return to the castle."
Lord Glenarvon reluctantly permitted
her to leave him ; he promised to see her
on the following morning ; and she has
tened home,

CHAPTER XXX.
UNABLE to rest, Calantha wrote during
the whole of the night; and in the morn-
ing, she heard that the Duke was in pos-
session of her letter. Lady Margaret
entered, and informed her of this.
She also stated that the note would
soon be returned into her own hands,
and that although much might be
suspected from its contents, neither
herself nor the Duke were of opinion
that Lord Avondale should at pre-
sent be informed of the transaction.
While Lady Margaret was yet speaking,
the Duke, opening the door, with a severe
countenance approached Calantha, and
placing the letter to Lord Glenarvon upon
the table, assured her, with coldness, that
he considered her as her own mistress,
and should not interfere, Lady Margaret

without a word further being uttered on
her part, left the room.
As soon as she was gone, the Duke ap
proached his daughter. " This is going
too far," he said, pointing to the letter:
" there is no excuse for you." She asked
him, with some vivacity, why he had
broken the seal, and wherefore it was not
delivered as it was addressed. With cold-
ness he apologized to her for the liberty
he had taken, which even a father's right
over an only child, he observed, could
scarcely authorise. "But," continued he,
"duty has of late been so much sacrificed
to inclination, that we must have charity
for each other. As I came, however, by
your letter somewhat unfairly, I shall
make no comments upon it, nor describe
the feelings that it excited in my mind-
only observe, I will have this end here;
and my commands, like your's, shall be
obeyed." He then reproached her for
her behaviour. " I have seen you
give way," he said, "to exceeding low

spirits, and I am desirous of knowing
why this grief has suddenly been changed
to ill-timed gaiety and shameless effron-
tery? Will nothing cure you of this love
of merriment? Will an angry father,
an offended husband, and a contemning
world but add to and encrease it? Shall
I say happy Calantha, or shall I weep
over the hardness of a heart that is in-
sensible to the grief of others, and has
ceased to feel for itself? Alas! I looked
upon you as my comfort and delight; but
you are now to me, a heavy care-a nea
ver ceasing reproach; and if you persist
in this line of conduct, the sooner you
quit this roof, which rings with your dis-
grace, the better it will be for us all.
Those who are made early sacrifices to
ambition and interest may plead some ex-
cuse; but you Calantha, what can you
say to palliate your conduct? A father's
blessing accompanied the choice your
own heart made; and was not Avondale
a noble choice? What quality is there,

whether of person or of mind, in which
he is deficient? I think of him with
feelings of pride."--"I do so, too, my
father."" Go, poor deluded child," he
continued, in an offended tone, "fly to
the arms of your new lover, and seek
with him that happiness of which you
have robbed me for ever, and which I
fear you yourself never more will know.
Do not answer me, or by those proud
looks attempt to hide your disgrace. I am
aware of all
you
would urge ; but am not
to be swayed by the sophistry you would
employ. This is no innocent friend-
ship. Beware to incense me by uttering
one word in its defence. Are you not
taught that God, who sees the heart, looks
not at the deed, but at the motive ? In
his eye the murderer who has made up
his mind to kill, has already perpetrated
the deed ; and the adultress who...

I bumble myself before you. Speak not
so harshly to me: I am very miserable."
" Consent to see him no more. Say it,
my child, and all shall be forgotten-I
will forgive you."" I must see him
once more-ah! once more ; and if he
consents, I will obey."-" Good God!
do I live to hear such words? Is it then
to Lord Glenarvon's mercy, and to no
effort of your own, that I am to owe
your amendment ? See him then, but
do it in defiance of my positive com-
mands:  see him, Calantha ; but the
veangeance of an offended God, the male-
diction of a father fall on thee for thy
disobedience:see him if it be thy mad
resolve ; but meet my eyes no more. A
lover may be found at any time ; but a
father, once offended, is lost for ever :
his will should be sacred; and the God
of Heaven may see fit to withdraw his
mercy from a disobedient child." The
Duke, as he spoke these words, trembled

with passion, and darting an angry eye
upon Calantha, left her. The door closed.
She stood suspended  uncertain how to
act.
At length recovering, she seized a pen,
and wrote to Glenarvon.-"I am indeed
wretched; but let me, at all events, spare
you. Come not to the Castle. Write to
me: it is all I ask. I must quit you for
ever. Oh, Glenarvon, I must indeed see
you no more; or involve all whom I love,
and yourself, who art far dearer, in my
disgrace. Let me hear from you im-
mediately. You must decide for me :
I have no will on earth but your's-no
hope, but in the continuance of your
love. Do not call me weak. Write to
me: say you approve; for if you do not,
I cannot obey."
Having sent her letter with some fear,
she went to Mrs. Seymour, who was far
from well, and had been some days con-
fined to her room. She endeavoured to
conceal from her what had passed in the

morning respecting her father. Mrs. Sey-
mour spoke but little to her, she seemed
unequal to the task imposed upon her by
others, of telling Calantha that which she
knew would cause her pain. She was
dreadfully agitated, and holding her
niece's hand, seemed desirous she should
not leave her for any length of time.
Towards noon, Calantha went out for a
few moments, and near the Elm wood
met Glenarvon. "Oh, for Heaven's sake!"
she cried, " do not coine here : some
one may see you."" And if they do,"
he said calmly, "what of that?""I can-
not stay now for your sake I cannot:
meet me to-night."-"Where?" How?"
" At the Chapel.""At what hour?"
" At twelve."-" That is too early."
"At three.""I dare not come.'
." I dare notcome."'--"Then
farewell."-" Glenarvon !" He turned
back. " I cannot be thus trifled with,"
he said. " You have given yourself to ,
me: I was not prepared for this wavering
and caprice.""Oh, you know not wht

has passed."" I know all."  " My
aunt is ill." He smiled contemptuously.
" Act as you think right," he said ; " but
do not be the dupe of these machina-
tions." "She is really ill: she is incapa-
ble of art.""Go to her, then."" And
you-shall I see you no more?"" Ne-
ver."" I shall come to-night."" As
you please."" At all events, I shall be
there, Glenarvon.-Oh look not thus on
me. You know, you well know your
power: do not lead meto infamy and ruin."
Glenarvon seized Calantha's hand,
which he wrung with violence. Passion
in him was very terrible : it forced no
fierce words from his lips ; no rush of
blood suffused his cheeks and forehead ;
but the livid pale of suppressed rage spread
itself over every feature: even his hands
bore testimony to the convulsive effort
which the blood, receding to his heart,
occasioned. Thus pale, thus fierce, he
gazed on Calantha with disdain.-"Weak,
timid being, is it for this I have renounced
So much? Is it for such as you that

I have consented to live? How different
from her I once loved. Go to the parents
for whom I am sacrificed ; call back the
husband who is so preferred to me; note
well his virtues and live upon his cares-
ses :--the world will admire and praise
you. I knew how it would be and am
satisfied. Then with a rapid change of
countenance from malice to bitter an-
guish, he gazed on her, till his eyes were
filled with tears: while his lips faltered
as he said farewell. Calantha approached
too near : he pressed her to his heart.
" I am yours," she said, half suffocated.
" Nor parents, nor husband, nor fear of
man or Heaven shall ever cause me to
leave you.""You will meet me to-night
then.""I will.""You will not play
upon my irritated feelings by penitential
letters and excusesyou are decided, are
you? Say either yes or no ; but be firm
to either."-" I will come then, let dis-
grace or death be the consequence."

more, far dearer than either mistress or
bride. It is, I own, a mere mockery of
superstition : but what on earth deserves
a higher name ? Every varying custom
and every long-established form, whether
in our own land, or those far distant
tracts which the foot of man has rarely
traversed, deserves no higher name. The
customs of our forefathers--the habit of
years, give a venerable and sacred ap-
pearance to many rites ; but all is a
dream, the mere colouring of fancy, the
frail perishable attempts of human inven-
tion. Even the love we feel, (alantha-
the beaming fires which now stimulate
our. hearts, and raise us above others is
but illusion like the bright exhaltations
which appear to mislead, then vanish and

Calantha's eyes were fixed ; her hand
was cold ; no varying colour, no trepi-
dation shewed either life or vigour; there
was a struggle in her mind; and a voice
seemed to call to her from her inmost

seemed to say, I warn thee, for the last
time I warn thee. Oh hear the voice of
conscience as it cries to thee for the last
time!-go not to thy ruin : plunge not
thy soul into the pit of hell ; hurl not de-
struction upon thy head. What is this
sin against thy religion? How canst thou
throw off thy faith and reliance upon thy
God? It is a mere mockery of words ;
a jealous desire to possess every avenue
of thy heart's affections, to snatch thee
from every feeling of remorse and virtue;
to plunge thee into eternal perdition.

me, never will I forsake Glenarvon.'
The nurse entered Calantha's room,
bearing her boy in her arms. She would
not look on him:-" Take him away,"
she said ; " take him to my aunt." The
child wished to stay:for the first time
he hung about her with affection; for,
he was not of that character, and seldom
shewed his love by infantine fondness
and caresses. She started from his gen-
tle grasp, as if from something terrible:
" Take him away," she shrieked to the
affrighted woman,
6 and never let him
come near me more.'
There are many whose eyes may glance
upon these pages, who will regard with
indignation the confession here made
respecting the character of Calantha. But
it is as if those who had never known
sickness and agony mocked at its power

-as if those who had never witnessed the
delirious ravings of fever or insanity rea-
soned upon their excess, they must not
judge who cannot understand.
Driven to despair-guilty in all but
the last black deed that brands the name
and character with eternal infamy, Calan-
tha resolved to follow Glenar von. How
indeed could she remain ! To her every
domestic joy was forever blasted ; and
a false estimate of honour inclined her to
believe, that it was right in her to go.
But not to-night, she said. Oh not like a
culprit and a thief in the midst of the
night, will I quit my father's house, or
leave my aunt sick and ill to grieve her-
self almost to death for
my
sake.
Preserving, during the evening, a sul-
len silence, an affectation of offended
pride, Calantha retired early ; looked
once upon the portraits of her husband
and mother; and then turned from them

fate. Happier! alas he is blest: I alone
suffer-I alone am miserable ; never,
never can I behold him more. These
were the last words Calantha uttered, as
she prepared for an interview she dreaded.
It was now but twelve o'clock : she threw
herself upon her bed, and waited in tre-
pidation and alarm for the hour of three.
A knock at the door aroused her. It was
OKelly ; but he waited not one instant :
he left a gold casket with a ring, within
was a letter: My beloved," it said, "I
wait for thee. Oh repent not thy pro-
mise !" Nothing else was written. The
hand she well knew : the signature was.
" Ever and thine alone, Glenarvon."

It was past three o'clock, when Calantha
opened the cabinet where the page's
clothes were formerly kept, and drew
from thence his mantle and plumed hat ;
and, thus disguised, prepared herself for
the interview. She slowly descended the
stairs : the noisy revels of the servants
might still at intervals be heard : in a
moment she glided through the apart-
ments and passages, till she found her-
self at the door which led to the terrace.
It opened heavily, and closed again with
a loud noise. Alarmed, lest she should
be discovered, she flew with rapidity
over the terrace and lawn, till she ap-
proached the wood, and then she paused
to take breath, and to listen if all were
silent.
Then she walked fearfully onwards.

Glenarvon the moon was bright and full,
and the whole scene was lighted by its
rays;
but it was on the wane-the
silver crescent shone alone, and the
clouds continually passing over it, cast
fearful shadows upon the grass.
She
found herself in the thickest part of the
wood. She heard a hollow murmur:
it was but the alders, waving in the wind,
which made a tremulous noise, like voices
whispering at a distance.
She passed
on, and the recollection that it was to
Glenarvon that she was hastening, and
that it was probably for the last time,
made her indifferent to her fate, and ren-
dered her fearless. Besides, the despe-
rate and the guilty never fear: a deeper
feeling renders them callous to all beside
-a spirit of defiance deadens in them
the very edge of apprehension. She pro-
ceeded to the appointed place. The sea
dashed against the cliff below; and the
bleak wind whistled through the ruined
chapel as it came in hollow blasts over
the heath.

was leaning upon one of the broken
rocks: he viewed, unawed, the melan-
choly scene before him.
No supersti-
tious terrors had power to shake bis soul:
m sery had done its utmost to subdue
him. Nor hope, nor prosperity, could
afford him comfort, or remove his de-
jection. In the first transports of joy
at seeing him, she darted towards
him;. but when she marked the pale-
ness of his cheeks, the stillness of
his attitude, she started hack, and ad-
vanced slowly: for she feared to disturb
him.
The evening breeze had blown back
his dark locks, and bared his pale fore-
head, upon which the light of the moon-
beam fell. She gazed upon him; and
while she contemplated the beautiful ma-
- jesty of his figure, his fixed and mourn-
ful eyes, his countenance so fraught with
feeling, she approached him. My
friend, my lover," she said.
" Ah! my

knew you would not fail; but I have
waited for you till every bright illusion
of hope has been changed into visions of
despondency and fear. We meet now:
but is it indeed to part no more! Glenar-
von is your's, and shall never be severed
from you."
" Ah! triumph over yourself and
me," she cried, clasping her hands in
alarm. " Ask any sacrifice but this.
Do not make me contemptible to you and
to myself." "Calantha, the time for safety
is past: it is too late now. I have linked
my soul to your's; I love you in defiance
of myself; I know it to be guilt, and to
be death; but it must be. We follow

O Calantha, turn from these to a lover's
bosom; seek for comfort here; and
now, even now, accompany me in my
flight.
" I will leave all for you:- I love but

she uttered the impious oath which bound
her to him, when her heart, convulsed
with terror, ceased to beat. 66 Ti's but in

in the mad infatuation of passion, the
fear of thy vengeance spake terrors into
her soul, and ingratitude for all thy favours
was not to be numbered with her sins."
But the step she had taken was terrible.
She considered herself as no longer under
the protection of her father, she had dis-
obeyed his sacred command, she had
broken her solemn promise; she trem-
bled exceedingly; and fear for one mo-
ment overpowered her. Lord Glenar-
von looked upon her, mournfully, as if
sorry
for the sin which he had cast upon
her soul. Now," he said, " you
will
look back upon these moments, and you
will consider me with abhorrence. I have
led you with me to ruin and remorse."
"On me-on me, be the sin ; let it fall

this, you forsake me, then shall the ven .

said. "I will not leave my father thusI

With words like these, Glenarvon si-
lenced her as she returned to the castle ;
and, strange as it may seem, untroubled
sleep-such sleep as in better days she
once enjoyed, fell upon all her senses,
quieted every passion, and obliterated,
for a few hours, the scenes of guilt which
tortured her with their remembrance.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
To wake is terrible when the heaviness of
sin is upon us !-to wake, and see
every object around us the same as be-
fore ; but to feel that we are utterly
changed! I am still in a father's house,
she thought, as late the ensuing morning
she opened her eye. " My name is not
yet branded with disgrace; but I belong
alone upon earth to Glenarvon. Mrs.
Seymour sent for her : the nurse entered
with the children. But Calantha looked
upon the ring and trembled.
Lady Avondale ordered her horses, and,
dressing in haste, entered Mrs. Seymour's
room.
Never had she found it easy to
deceive till that moment. To tell her the
truth had been to kill her : she feigned
therefore with ease, for her aunt's life re-
quired it, and she herself was desperate.

" Have you kept your resolution, my Ca-
lantha )" Yes," she replied, nor
blushed at affirming it.
" Two days,
and you have not seen Glenarvon ?" Is
this possible ?" I thought one had kil-
led me," replied Calantha; "but I look
well ; do I not ?", and she hurried from
her aunt's presence.
Her horses awaited : she rode out the
whole of the day : it seemed to her as
if a moment's pause or rest would have
been agony unutterable. And yet, when
the spirit is heavy there is something un-
pleasant in the velocity of motion : throw-
ing, therefore, the reins upon her well-
trained steed, she paced slowly over the
mountain's side, lost in reflections which
it had been pain to interrupt.
Suddenly a horse and rider, in full
speed, darting along the moor, approached
and crossed upon her path.
6 Whither
ride you Lady, so slow ?" said Miss St.
Clare, whom she now recognized, scarce
reining in her swift-footed charger. " And

whither ride you, Lady, so fast.?" said
Calantha, courteously returning her sa-
". To perdition," cried Elinor ;
" and they that wish to follow must ride
apace.". The hat and plume of sacred
green, the emerald clasp, the gift of Gle-
narvon, were all but too well observed
by Calantha. Deeply she blushed as St.
Clara, fixing her dark eyes upon her,
asked her respecting him, " Is thy young
lover well ?" she said : " and wilt thou
be one of us ? He slept last night at Bel-
font: he could not rest : didst thou ? "
Saying which, she smiled, and rode away,
Oppressed with many bitter doubts,
Calantha returned to the Castle; and
what is strange, she felt coldly towards
Glenarvon. On her return, she found
letters from him far the most ardent, the
most impassioned she had yet received.
He spoke with grief of her unkindness :
he urged her by every tie most dear,
most sacred, to see him and fly with him.
Yet, that night, she went not to meet

him ;
she wrote not kindly ; she loved
not. She retired early ; and her thoughts
were painful and terrible. But such is
the inconsistency of the human heart;
her coldness seemed but to encrease his
ardour. She received that night, the
warmest the most unguarded letters ; she
even now dreaded the violence of his at-
tachment. Remorse, she felt, had taken
the place of passion in her own heart: for
all within was chilled, was changed.
As she thus sat in sullen silence, unwil-
ling to think-unable to forget, she heard
a step stealing along the passage ; and in
a moment Glenarvon entered her apart-
ment. " We are lost," she cried. 61
care not," he said, " so that I but see
you."-"For Heaven's sake, leave me."
-"Speak lower," he said, approaching
her : "be calm, for think you that when
you have risked so much for me, I dare
not share the danger. After all, what is
it? Whoever enters must do it at their
peril : their life shall pay the forfeit: I

are your looks: I love you ; but I fear
you.'
" Do you remember," he replied,
" that day when I first told you of
my love? You blushed then, and wept :
did you not?, But you have forgotten to
do either now. Why, then, this strange
confusion ?"" I am sick at heart. Leave
me.""Never ! O most loved, most dear
of all earthly beings, turn not thus away
from me; look not as if you feared to
meet me ; feel not regret ; for if it be a
crime, that be on me, Calantha-on me
alone. I know how men of the world
can swear and forswear: I know, too,
how much will be attempted to sever you
from me : but by that Being in whose
sacred eye we stand ; by all that the hu-
man heart and soul can believe and che
rish, I am not one of that base kind, who
would ever betray the woman that trusted
in me. Even were you unfaithful to me,
I could not change. You are all on earth

that I love, and, perhaps what is better
worth, that I esteem and respectthat I
honor as above every other in goodness,
purity, and generous, noble feelings. O!
think not so humbly of yourself: say not
that you are degraded. My admiration
of you shall excuse your error: My faith-
ful attachment whilst existence is given
to either of us shall atone for all. Look
on me, my only friend ; dry up the tears
that fall for an involuntary fault; and
consider me as your protector, your lover,
your husband."
There required not many words, not
many protestations. Calantha wept bit-
terly ; but she felt happy. " If you change
now,
" she said, " what will become of
me ? Let me go with you, Glenarvon,
from this country: I ask not for other
ties than those that already bind us. Yet
I once more repeat it, I know you must
despise me."-" What are words and
vows, my heart's life, my soul's idol, what
are they? The false, the vain, the worldly-

minded have made use of them ; but I
must have recourse to them, Calantha,
since you can look at me, and yet mis-
trust me. No villany that ever yet existed,
can exceed that which my falsehood to
you would now evince. This is no com-
mon worldly attachment: no momentary
intoxication of passion. Often I have
loved : many I have seen ; but none ever
sacrificed for me what you have done ;
and for none upon earth did I ever feel
what I do for you.
I might have made
you mine long ago : perhaps I might have
abused the confidence shewn me, and
the interest and enthusiasm I had created;
but, alas! you would then have despised

What I speak I have written : my letters

hope of which you are not the first and
sole object. Many disbelieve that I am
serious in my desire that you should ac-
company me in my flight. They know
me not: I have no views, no projects.
Men of the worid look alone to fortune,
fame, or interest; but what am I? The
sacrifice is solely on your part : I would
that it were on mine. If even you re-
fuse to follow me, I will not make this a
plea for abandoning you : I will hover
around, will protect, will watch over you.
Your love makes my happiness : it is my
sole hope in life. Even were you to change
to me, I could not but be true to you."
Did Glenarvon really wish Calantha to
accompany him : he risked much ; and
seemed to desire it. But there is no un-
derstanding the guileful heart; and he
who had deceived many, could assu-
redly deceive her. Yet it appears, that
he urged her more than ever to fly
with him ; and that when, at length she
said that her resolution was fixed-that

she would go, his eyes in triumph gloried
in the assurance : and with a fervour he
could not have feigned he called her his.
Hitherto, some virtuous, some religious
hopes had still sustained her; now all
ceased ; perversion led the way to crime,
and hardness of heart and insensibility
followed.
One by one, Glenarvon repeated to
her confessions of former scenes. One
by one, he betrayed to her the confidence
others had reposed in his honour. She
saw the wiles and windings of his mind,
nor abhorred them: she heard his mockery
of all that is good and noble ; nor turned
from him. Is it in the nature of guilty
love thus to pervert the very soul ? Or
what in so short a period could have ope-
rated so great a change ? Till this period
the hope of saving, of guarding, of re-
claiming, had led her on : now frantic
and perverted passion absorbed all other
hopes.
Calantha had read of love, and felt it;

319
she had laughed at the sickening rhapso-
dics of sentiment, and turned with dis-
gust from the inflammatory pages of
looser pens; but, alas ! her own heart now
presented every feeling she had most ab-
horred ; and it was in herself she found
the reality of all that, during her whole
existence, she had looked upon with con-
tempt and dislike. Every remaining
scruple left her; she still urged delay;
but to accompany her master and lover
was now her firm resolve.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
GLENARVON had retired unperceived by
any, on the evening he had visited her,
in her apartment. The following day
he appeared at the castle; they both
avoided each other : she indeed trembled
at beholding him. 66 Meet me at the
chapel to night," he whispered. Alas!
she obeyed too well.
They were returning through the
wood: she paused one moment to look
upon the sea : it was calm ; and the air
blew soft and fresh upon her burning
forehead. What dreadful sight is that?...
a female figure passing through the
thicket behind, with a hasty step ap-
proached them, and knelt down as if im-
ploring for mercy. Her looks were wild ;
famine had stamped its hollow prints in
furrows on her cheeks: she clasped her

hands together; and fixing her eyes wild-
ly upon Glenarvon, remained in silence.
Terrified, Calantha threw herself for
safety at his feet; and he clasping her
closely to his bosom'saw but her. "Oh!
Glenarvon," she cried, look, look ; it
is not a human form : it is some dreadful
vision, sent to us by the power of Heaven,
to warn us." "My soul, my Calantha,
fear not: no power shall harm you.
Turning from her, Glenarvon now gazed
for one moment on the thin and ghastly
form, that had occasioned her terror.
" God bless you." cried the suppliant.
He started at the hollow sound. It seemed
to him indeed that the awful blessing
was a melancholy reproach for his broken
faith. He started, for in that emaciated
form, in that wild and haggard eye, he
thought he recognized some traces of one
whom he had once taken spotless as
innocence to his heart,-then left a prey
to remorse and disappointment. For the

sake of that resemblance*, he offered mo.
ney to the wretch who implored his mercy,
and turned away, not to behold again so
piteous, so melancholy a spectacle.
Intently gazing upon him, she uttered
a convulsive groan, and sunk extended
on the earth. Calantha and Glenarvon
both flew forward to raise her. But the
poor victim was no more : her spirit had
burst from the slight bonds that yet re-
tained it in a world of pain and sorrow.
She bad gazed for the last time upon the
lover who had robbed her of all happi-
ness through life; and the same look,
which had first awakened love in her
bosom, now quenched the feeling, and
with it life itself. The last wish of her
heart, was a blessing, not a curse on
him who had abandoned her: and the
tear that he shed unconsciously over a
form so altered, that he did not know

her, was the only tear that blessed the
last hour of Calantha's once favorite com-
panion Alice Mac Allain.
Oh! need a scene which occasioned
her every bitter pang be repeated ?-need
it be said that, regardless of themselves or
any conclusions which their being toge-
ther at such an hour might have oc-
casioned: they carried the unconscious
girl to the door of the castle, where
O'Kelly was waiting to receive them.
Every one had retired to rest ; it was
late; and one of Calantha's maids and
O'Kelly alone remained in fearful anxiety
watching for their return.
Terrified at the haggard looks, and life-
less form before her, Calantha turned to
Glenarvon. But his countenance was
changed ; his eyes were fixed.

the sight, a faintness came over him:-the
name of Alice was pronounced by him.
O'Kelly understood his master. " Is it
possible?" he exclaimed, and seizing the

girl in his arms, he promised Calan-
tha to do all in his power to restore her,
and only implored her to retire to her
own apartment: "For my master's sake,
dear Lady, be persuaded," he said. He
was indeed no longer the same subser-
vient strange being, he had shewni him-
self hitherto; he seemed to assume a new
character, on an occasion which called
for his utmost exertion : he was all acti-
vity and forethought, commanding every
thing that was to be done, and awaken-
ing Lord Glenarvon and Calantha to a
sense of their situation.
Although Lady Avondale was at last
persuaded to retire, it may be supposed
that she did not attempt to rest ; and
being obliged in some measure to inform
her attendant of what had passed, she
sent her frequently with messages to
O'Kelly to inquire concerning her unhap-
friend. At last she returned with a
few lines, written by Lord Glenarvon.
Calantha," he said, " you will now

learn to shudder at my name, and look
upon me with horror and execration.
Prepare yourself for the worst :-it is
Alice whom we beheld. She came to
take one last look at the wretch who had
seduced, and then abandoned her :
she is no more.
Think not, that to
screen myself, I have neglected the
means of preserving her.Think me not
base enough for this ; but be assured
that all care and assistance have been ad-
ministered. The aid of the physician,
however, is vain. Calm yourself, Ca-
lantha: I am very calm."
The maid, as she gave this note, told
Calantha that the young woman, whom
Mr. O'Kelly had discovered at the door
of the castle, was poor Miss Alice-so
altered, that her own father, she was sure,
would not know her.
" Did you see
her"
." O yes, my Lady: Mr. O'Kelly
took me to see her, when I carried the
message to him: and there I saw my

every thing that was needed to assist her,
so that it would have moved the heart
of any one to have seen him." While
the attendant thus continued to talk,
her young mistress wept, at having at
length dismissed her, she opened the
door listening with suspense to every
distant noise.
It was six in the morning, when a
loud commotion upon the stairs aroused
her. Hurrying down, she beheld a
number of servants carrying some one
for air, into one of the outer courts. It
was not the lifeless corpse of Alice. From
the glimpse Calantha caught, it appeared
a larger form, and, upon approaching still
nearer, her heart sickened at perceiving
that it was the old man, Gerald Mac Al.
lain, who having arisen to enquire into
the cause of the disquiet he heard in
the house, had been abruptly informed
by some of the servants, that his daugh-
ter had been discovered without any signs
of life, at the gates of the castle. O'Kelly

and the other attendants had presssd
forward to assist him.
Calantha now leaving him in their
hands, walked in trembling alarm,
through the hall, once more to look upon
berunhappy friend. There leaning against
one of the high black marble pillars,
pale, as the lifeless being whom, stretched
before him, he still, continued to contem-
plate, she perceived Glenarvon. His eyes
were fixed: in bis look there was all
the bitterness of death ; his cheek was
hollow: and in that noble form, the wreck
of all that is great might be traced. "Look
not thus," she said, 66 Oh Glenarvon: it
pierces my heart to see you thus : grief
must not fall on one like you." He took
her hand, and pressed it to his heart;
but he could not speak. He only pointed
to the pale and famished form before
him; and Calantha perceiving it, knelt
down by its side and wept in agony:
" There was a time," he said, " when I
could have feared to cast this sin upon

ness and affection, as I have done. But
I have grown callous to all : and now my
only, my dearest friend, I will tear my-
self away from you for ever. I will not
say God bless you I must not bless
thee, who have brought thee to so much
misery. Weep not for one unworthy of
you :-I am not what you think, my Ca-
lantha. Unblessed myself, I can but give
misery to all who approach me. All that
follow after me come to this pass ; for
my love is death, and this is the reward
of constancy. Poor Alice, but still more
unhappy Calantha, my heart bleeds for
you : for myself, I am indifferent.
Gerald now returned, supported by
O'Kelly. The other servants, by his
desire, had retired ; and when he ap-
proached the spot where his child was
laid, he requested even O'Kelly to leave
him. He did so; and Mac Allain ad.
vanced towards Lord Glenarvon.  For-
give a poor old man," he said in a fal-
tering voice : " I spoke too severely,

my lord : a father's curse in the agony of
his first despair shall not be heard. Oh
lady Calantha," said the old man, turning
to her, " lord Glenarvon has been very
noble and good to me; my sons had
debts, and he paid all they owed : they
had transgressed and he got them pardon-
ed. You know not what I owe to my lord;
and yet when he told me, this night, as I
upbraided the wretch that had undone
my child and was the cause of her dishonor
and death, that it was himself had taken
her from my heart; I knelt down and
cursed bim. Oh God, Oh God! pardon
the agony of a wretched father, a poor
old man who has lived too long."
Calantha could no longer master her
feelings ; her sobs, her cries were bitter
and terrible. They wished to bear her for-
cibly away. O'Kelly insisted upon the
necessity of her assuming at least some
self command; and whispering to her, that,
if she betrayed any violent agitation, the
whole affair must be made public: he

few hours at least remain tranquil.
shall see you again," she said, recovering
herself and approaching Lord Glenarvon
before she retired : " You are not going?"
Going !" he replied : " undoubtedly I
shall not leave the castle at this moment ;
it would look like fear ; but after this, my
dearest friend, I do not deceive myself,
you cannot, you ought not more to think
of me." " I share your sorrows," she
said :
you are most miserable ; think
not then, that I can be otherwise," " And
can you still feel any interest for one like
me ? If I could believe this, even in the
bitterness of affliction, I should still feel
comfort: but, you will learn to hate me."
6. Never: Oh would that I could ; but it is
too late now. I love you, Glenarvon,
more than ever even were it to death ; ;
Depend on me." Glenarvon pressed her
hand in silence; then following ber, " For

Calantha threw herself upon her bed ;
but her agitation was too great to allow of
her recurring in thought to the past, and
fatigue once again occasioned her taking
a few moment's rest.

CHAPTER XXXV.
When Lady Avondale awoke from her
slumbers, she found the whole castle in a
state of confusion. Lady Margaret had
twice sent for her. Every one was occupied
with this extraordinary event. Her name,
and Lord Glenarvon's were mentioned
together, and conjectures, concerning the
whole scene, were made by every indi-
vidual.
At Gerald Mac Allain's earnest entrea-
ties, the body of Alice was conveyed to
his own house, near the Garden Cottage.
He wished no one to be informed of the
particulars of her melancholy fate. He
came, however, a few days after her remo-
val, to ask for Calantha. She was ill; but
admitted him immediately. They talked
together upon all that had occurred. He
gave her a letter and a broach, which

333
had been found upon the body. The letter
was addressed to Lord Glenarvon. There
was also a lock of hair, which seemed, from
the fineness of its texture, to belong to a
child. The letter was a mournful congra-
tulation on his supposed marriage with a
lady in England, written at some former
period: it wished him every happiness, and
contained no one reproach. The broach
consisted of a heart's ease, which she en-
treated him sometimes to wear in re-
membrance of one, who had loved him
truly. " Heart's ease to you mais triste
pense pour moi," was engraved upon it.
" You must yourself deliver these," said
Mac Allain looking wistfully at Calantha.
She promised to do so.
Mac Allain then drew forth a larger
packet which was addressed to himself.
" I have not yet read it," he said. "I
am not able to see for my tears; but it
is the narration of my child's sorrows; and
when I have ended it, I will give it to
you, my dear Lady, and to any other

sufferings: he more than shares them.
For
my
sake I ask
you this. Keep this
transaction secret; and, whatever may
be
suspected, let none know the truth.---
Say: may I ask it?"
Calantha's agitation moved him great-
ly. He wept in bitter anguish.
" The
destroyer of my child," he said,
lead my benefactress into misery. Ah!
my dear young Lady, how my heart
bleeds for you." Impatiently, she torned
away.
" Will your hear my entreaties,"
she said. " You may command; but
the news of my child's death is spread:
many are talking of it already: I cannot
keep it secret." Only let not Lord
Glenarvon's name appear." Mac Allain
promised to do all in his powe to silence

335
every rumour; and, with the help of
O'Kelly, he, in some measure succeeded.
The story believed was, that Mr. Bucha-
nan first had carried Alice with him to
England, where she had fallen into
poverty and vice. No further enquiry
was made; but Lord Glenarvon himself
confided to many, the secret which Ca-
lantha was so eager to conceal.
The narrative of Alice's sufferings
may be omitted by those who wish not
to peruse it. Lord Glenarvon desired to
read it when Calantha had ended it.
He also took the broach, and pressing
it to his lips, appeared very deeply af-
fected. After this for a short time he ab-
sented himself from the castle. Tlie
following pages, written by Alice, were
addressed to her only surviving parent.
No comment is made on them; no a-
pology offered for their insertion. If
passion has once subdued the power
of reason, the misery and example of
others never avail, nor would they even

we
were we certain of a similar fate. If
every calamity we may perhaps deserve,
were placed in view before us,
should not pause--we should not divert
our steps. To love, in defiance of virtue
is insanity, not guilt. To attempt the
safety of its victims, were a generous but
useless effort of unavailing interference.
It is like a raging fever, or the tempest's
fury-far beyond human aid to allay or
restore. Calantha read, however, the his-
tory of her friend, and wept her fate.
ALICE'S NARRATIVE.
"My dear and honoured father,
To you I venture to address this short
history of my unhappy life, and if suffer-
ings and pain can in part atone for my
misconduct, I surely shall be forgiven by
you; but never, while existence, however
miserable, is prolonged, never shall I
forgive myself. Perhaps even now, the
rumour of my disgrace has reached you,

and added still severer pangs to those you
before endured. But oh! my father, I
have in part, expiated my offences. Long
and severe sorrows have followed me,
since I left your roof, and none more
heart rending-oh! none to compare with
the agony of being abandoned by him,
for whom I left so much. You remember,
my dear father, that, during the. last
year, which I passed at the castle, the
attention which Mr. Buchanan had paid
me, was so marked, that it occasioned
the most serious apprehensions in Lady
Margaret, on his account. Alas! I con-
cealed from every one, the true cause
of my encreasing melancholy; and felt
happy that the suspicions of my friends
and protectors were thus unintentionally
misled. I parted with Linden, nor told
him my secret. I suffered the severest
menaces end reproofs, without a murmur;
for I knew myself guilty, though not of
the crime with which I was charged. At
Sir Everard St, Clare's I found means to

every obstacle, which opposed his wishes
and
my own.
"But it is time more particularly to ac-
quaint you, my dear father, by what acci-
dent I first met with Lord Glenarvon, to
whom my fate was linked-whose attach-
mentonce made me blessed-whose incon-
stancy has deprived me of every earthly
hope. Do you remember once, when I ob-
tained leave to pass the day with you, that
my brother, Garlace, took me with him in
his boat, down the river Allan, and Roy
and yourself were talking eagerly of the
late affray which had taken place in our
village. I then pointed out to you the
ruins of St. Alvin Priory, and asked
you the history of its unhappy owners.
That evening, when yourself and Roy
were gone on shore, my brother Gar-
lace fixing the sail, returned with me
down the current with the wind : and as
we passed near the banks from behind

as they say spirits sing over the dead ;
and as we turned by the winding shore,
we soon perceived a youth who was
throwing pebbles into the stream, and
ever whilst he threw them, he conti-
nued singing in that soft, sweet manner
I have said. He spoke with us, and the
nielancholy sound of his voice, attracted
us towards him. We landed close by the
place near which he stood. He accom-
panied us to the front of the castle ; but
then entreating us to excuse his proceed-
ing further, he retired; nor told us who

Calantha paused in the narrative; she
gasped for breath; and wiping away the

she said, " dear as he has hitherto been

but a record of evil. To exhibit the strug-

- he would have spared me: but he had
not strength. O my father, you know
Lord Glenarvon-you have felt for him,

rushed forward herself to meet it. Unused
to disguise my sentiments, I did not at-
tempt even to conceal them from him;
and when he told me I was dear, I too
soon shewed him, how much more so he
was to me. For when the moment of
parting for ever came, when I saw my

know not the struggles of my heart-
you can never know what I have en-
dured."
Calantha breathed with greater diffi-
culty; and paused again. She paced to
and fro within her chamber, in strong
agitation of mind. She then eagerly re-
turned to peruse the few remaining pages, ,

written by her miserable, her infatuated
friend."She was not guilty," she cried.
" The God of Heaven will not, does not
condemn her. Oh she was spotless as
innocence compared with me.
"
" There were many amongst Lord Gle-
narvon's servants who were acquainted
with
my secret. Through every trouble
and some danger I followed him; nor
boast much of having felt no woman's
fear; for who that loves can fear. I will
not dwell upon these moments of my
life: they were the only hours of joy,
which brightened over a career of mise-
ry and gloom. Whilst loved by the object
of one's entire devotion-whilst sur-
rounded by gaiety and amusement, the
voice of conscience is seldom heard;
and, I will confess it, at this time I fancied
myself happy. I was Glenarvon's mis-
tress; and I knew not another wish upon
earth. In the course of the three years,
passed with him in England and in Italy,
I became mother of a child, and Clare,

my little son, was dear to his father. But
after his birth, he forsook me.'
We were in England at the time, at
the house of one of his friends, when
he first intimated to me the necessity of
his leaving me. He had resolved, he
said, to return to Florence, and I was in
too weak a state of health to permit of
my accompanying him. I entreated, I im-
plored for permission to make the attempt.
He paused for some time, and then, as if
unable to refuse me, he consented-reluc-
tantly, I will own it; but still he said
that I should go.
He never appeared
more fond, more kind than the evening
before his departure. That evening, I
supped with him and his friends. He
seemed tired; and asked me more than
once if I would not go to rest. His ser-
vant, a countryman of ours, by name
O'Kelly, brought me a glass with some-
thing in it, which he bade me drink; but I
would not. Lord Glenarvon came to me,
and bade me take it. "If it were poison,"

I said fondly,
66 I would take it from
your hands, so that I might but die upon
your bosom." " It is not poison," he said,
" Alice, but what many a fine lady in
London cannot rest without. You will
need repose; you are going a long jour-
ney, to-morrow; drink it love ; and
mayest thou sleep in peace." I took the
draught and slumbered even whilst re-
posing in his arms

provided for me with money ; that he had
left me my child. I resolved to follow;

over to Ireland :the gates of the abbey
were shut against me. Mr. Hard Head, a

cried, "if you have the heart;" and my
strength was such that they seemed asto-

more than life. The boy clung to me
for support.

countenance and altered form, he traced
the features of her whom he had once
loved so well. But no-it could not be:

may see him again.....

she did kneel to him ;-and she received
from his hands the relief he thought she
craved ;--and the unexpected kindness

was buried in the church near Belfont.
There was a white stone placed upon her
grave, and her old father went daily there
and wept; and he had the tree that now
grows there planted ; and it was railed
around, that the cattle and wild-goats,
might not destroy it."
" Take the band from my head," said
Calantha. "Give me air. This kills
me...
She visited the grave of
Alice: she met Mac Allain returning from
it, they uttered not one word as they
passed each other. The silence was more
terrible than a thousand lamentations....
Lady Margaret sent for Calantha. She
looked ill, and was much agitated. "It
is tine," said Lady Margaret, to speak
" The folly of your conduct,"-
" Oh it is past folly," said Calantha
weeping. Lady Margaret looked upon
her with contempt. " How weak, and
how absurd is this. Whatever your er-
rors, need you thus confess them ? and
to you.

whatever your feelings, wherefore betray
them to the senseless crowd ?"
" Calantha," said Lady Margaret in a
hollow tone, "I can feel as deeply as
yourself. Nature implanted passions in
me, which are not common to all ; but
mark the difference between us :a strong
mind dares at least conceal the ravages
the tempest of its fury makes. It as-
sumes that character to the vulgar herd
which it knows is alone capable of im-
posing restraint upon it. Every one sus-
pects me, but none dare reproach me.
You, on the contrary, are the butt against
which every censure is levelled : they
know that your easy nature can pardon
malignity and the hand that insults

row. When you are offended, with pue-
rile impotence and passionate violence,
you exhibit the effects of your momen-
tary rage ; and by breaking of tables, or
by idle words, shew your own weakness.
Thus you are ever subdued by the

very exhibition of your passions. And
now that you love, instead of rendering
him you love your captive, you throw
yourself entirely in his power, and will
deeply rue the confidence you have
shewn. Has he not already betrayed you.
You know not Glenarvon. His heart,
black as it is, I have read and studied.
Whatever his imagination idolizes, be-
comes with him a sole and entire interest,
At this moment he would fly with you
to the extremity of the earth, and when
he awakes from his dream, he will laugh
at you, and at himself for his absurdity.
Trust not that malignant and venomed
tongue. The adder that slumbers in the
bosom of him who saved it, recovers, and
bites to the heart the fool that trusted it.
Warned on all sides, beware! and if no-
thing else can save you, learn at least
who this Glenarvon is, what he has done.
He is.....
" Lord Glenarvon," said a servant : at
that very instant the door opened, and he

entered. He started at seeing Calantha,
who, greatly embarrassed, durst not meet
his eyes. It seemed to her, that to have
heard him spoken of with unkindness
was a sort of treachery to an attachment
like their's. Lady Margaret's words had
wounded and grieved her ; but they had
not shaken her trust; and when she
looked
upon
him and saw that beautiful
countenance, every doubt left her. Before
she quitted the room, she observed how-
ever, with surprise, the smile of enchant-
ing sweetness, the air of kindness, even
of interest, with which Lady Margaret
received him; and one jealous fear cross-
ing her fancy, she lingered as if re-
proachfully enquiring what meant these
frequent visits to her Aunt. Glenarvon,
in a moment, read the doubt:-"Yes," he
cried, following her, "
you are right: if
ever I have loved another with idolatry
it was thy Aunt; but be assured I loved
in vain. And now Calantha, I would
agree, whilst existence were prolonged,

355
to see her no more, sooner than cause
you one hour's uneasiness. Be satisfied
at least, that she abhors me."
"None of this whispering," said Lady
Margaret, smiling gently, at least in my
presence. " I never loved before as now,
said Glenarvon, aloud. " Never," said
Lady Margaret, with an incredulous and
scornfulsmile. "No," said Glenarvon, still
gazing on Calantha ; "all is candour, in-
nocence, frankness in that heart; the one
I idolized, too long, was like my own--ut-
terly corrupted." "You wrong the lady,"
said Lady Margaret carelessly. "She had
her errors, I acknowledge ; but the cold-
ness of Glenarvon's heart, its duplicity,
its malignity, is unrivalled." Calantha,
deeply interested and agitated, could not
quit the room.
Glenarvon had seized
her hand; his eyes, fixed upon her,
seemed alone intent on penetrating her
feelings : she burst into tears: he ap-
proached her. " You shall not tear her
from me," he said, to Lady Margaret,
## p. 356 (#672) ############################################
356
GLENARVN.
' She goes with me by Heaven ; she is
bound to me by the most sacred oaths :
we are married ; are we not dearest ?"
" Have you confessed to her," said La-
dy Margaret contemptuously? " Every
thing."
" She loves you no doubt the better
for your crimes."
" She loves me, I
do believe it, in defiance of them,
said Glenarvon, in an impassioned tone,
" and may the whole world, if she
wishes it, know that by every art, by
every power I possess, I have sought
her : provided they also know," he con-
tinued with a sneer, " that I have won
her. She may despise me ;-you may
teach her to hate ; but of this be assured
-you cannot change me. Never, never
was I so enslaved. Calantha, my soul,
look on me.-Glenarvon kneels to you.
I would even appear humble--weak if it
but gratify your vanity ; for humility to
you is now my glorymy pride."
Calantha," said Lady Margaret, in
a protecting tone,
are you not vain ?"

GLENARVON.
357
" This Glenarvon has been the lover of
many hundreds ; to be thus preferred is
flattering. Shall I tell you, my dear
niece, in what consists your superiority ?
You are not as fair as these ; you are not
perhaps as pure ; but you are loved
more because your ruin will make the
misery of a whole family, and your dis-
grace will cast a shade upon the only man
whom Glenarvon ever acknowledged as
superior to himself - superior both in
mind and person. This, child, is your
potent charm-your sole claim to his ad-
miration. Shew him some crime of
greater magnitude, point out to him an
object more worth the trouble and pain
of renderinge miserable, and he will
immediately abandon you."
Glenarvon cast his eyes fiercely upon
Lady Margaret. The disdain of that
glance silenced her, she even came for-
ward with a view to conciliate : and af-
fecting an air of playful humility" I
spoke but from mere jealousy," she said.
" What woman of my age could bear to

see another so praised, so worshipped in
her presence. It is as if the future heir
of his kingdom were extolled in presence
of the reigning sovereign. Pardon me,
Glenarvon. I know, I see you love her."
" By my soul I do;" and look, he cried
exultingly, "with what furious rage
the
little tygress gazes on you. She will
harm you. I fear," he continued laugh-
ing, " if I do not carry her from your
presence. Come then Calantha: we shall
meet again," he said, turning back and
pausing as they quitted Lady Margaret's
apartment. The tone of his voice, and
his look, as he said this was peculiar:
nor did he for some moments regain his
composure.
Lady Margaret spoke a few words to
Calantha that evening. "I am in the
power of this man," she said, "and you
soon will be. He is cold, hard and cruel.

gard for yourself, go not with him.'

look of scornful superiority: "as he wish-
es you to believe him, he even may
exaggerate,were that possible, his crimes,
the more to interest and surprise. You
know him, Calantha, as one infatuated
and madly in love can imagine the idol
of its devotion. But there will come a
time when you will draw his character
with darker shades, and taking from it
all the romance and mystery of guilt, see
him, as I do, a cold malignant heart,
which the light of genius, self-love and
passion, have warmed at intervals; but
which, in all the detail of every-day life,
sinks into hypocrisy and baseness. Crimes
have been perpetrated in the heat of
pas-
sion, even by noble minds; but Glenarvon

unites the malice and petty vices of a wo-
man, to the perfidy and villany of a man.

never more, Lady Margaret, will inter-
change one word with each other.
I re-
nounce you entirely; and think yon all
that you have dared to say against my

Lady Margaret sought Calantha before
she retired for the night, and laughed at
her for her conduct.
" Your rage, your
absurdity but excite niy contempt. Ca-
lantha, how puerile this violence appears
to me; above all, how useless. Now,

violence of my passions. Yet I feel,

fear Calantha. Your very servants,
though you boast of their attachment,
despise and laugh at you. Your husband
caresses you as a mistress, but of your
conduct he takes not even heed. What is
the affection of the crowd? what the love
of man? make yourself feared! Then, if
you are not esteemed, at least you are out-
wardly honoured, and that reserve, that
self-controul, which you never sought
even to obtain, keeps ordinary minds in
alarm. Many hate me ; but who dares
even name me without respect. Yourself,
Calantha, even at this moment, are ready
to fall upon my bosom and weep, because
I have offended you. Come child-your
hand. I fain would save you, but you
must hear much that pains you, before I
can hope even to succeed. Only remem-
ber: si vous vous faites brebis le loup vous

and Calantha, half offended, gave her the
hand for which she solicited.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
MRS. SEYMOUR was now extremely un-
well, the least agitation was dreaded for
her. Calantba was constantly enquiring
after her ; but could not bear to remain
long in her presence. Yet at night she
watched by her, when she did not know
of it; and though she had ceased to
pray for herself, she prayed for her.
Could it be supposed that, at such a mo-
ment, any personal feelings would engage
Calantha to add to her uneasiness. Alas!
she sought in the last resources of guilt
to alleviate every apprehension she might
cherish ; she feigned a calin she felt not;
she made every promise she meant not
to fulfil; she even spoke of Glenarvon
with some severity for his conduet to
Alice ; and when Mrs. Seymour rejoiced
at her escape, she pressed her hand and

wept. Lady Margaret, from the day of
their quarrel, cold and stern, ever arose
to leave the room when Calantha entered
it, and Mrs. Seymour, seeing resentment
kindling in her niece's eye, in the gentlest
manner, urged her to bear with her aunt's
humour.
Lord Glenarvon had not written to Ca-
lantha for some days, he had left the
castle: and she laboured under the inost
painful suspense. The narrative of Alice's
sufferings was still in her possession. At
length he sent for it. "My Calantha,"
he said, in a letter she received from him,
My Calantha, I have not heard from
you, and my misery is the greater, as I
fear that you are resolved to see me no
I wish for the narrative in your
possession ; I know the impression it
must make; and strange as it may ap-
pear, I almost rejoice at it. It will spare
you much future sorrow; and it can
scarce add one pang to what I already
suffer. Had you accompanied me, it

was, I will now acknowledge, my firm
resolve to have devoted every moment of
my life to your happinessto have seen,
to have thought, to have lived, but for
you alone. I had then dared to presume,
that the excess of my attachment would
remunerate you, for all the sacrifices you
might be compelled to make; that the
fame of Glenarvon would hide, from the
eyes of a censorious world, the stigma of
disgrace, which must, I fear, involve you;
and that, at all events, in some other
country, we might live alone for each
other. The dream is past ; you have
undeceived me; your friends require it:
be it, as you and as they desire. I am
about to quit Ireland. If you would see
me before I go, it must be on the instant.
What are the wrongs of my country to
me? Let others, who have wealth and
power, defend her :- let her look to
English policy for protection; to English
justice for liberty and redress. Without
a friend, even as I first set foot upon these
shores, I now abandon them.'

Farewell, Calantha. Thou art the
last link which yet binds me to life. It
was for thy sake-for thine alone, that I
yet forbore. It is to save thee, that I
now rush onward to meet my fate: grieve
not for me. I stood a solitary being till
I knew you. I can encounter evils when
I feel that I alone shall suffer. Let me
not think that I have destroyed you.
But for me, you might have flourished
happy and secure. O why would you
tempt the fate of a ruined man?
-I en-
treat you to send the papers in your pos-
session. I am prepared for the worst.
But if you could bring yourself to be-
lieve the agony of my mind at this mo-
ment, you would still feel for me, even
though in all else chilled and changed.-
Farewell, dearest of all earthly beings
my soul's comforter and hope, farewell."
" I will go with thee Glenarvon, even
shoald my fate exceed Alice's in misery
-I never will forsake thee."
A servant entered at that moment,

and told her that Lord Glenarvon was
below-waiting for the answer.
66 Take
these papers," said Calantha, and with
them she enclosed a ring which had
been found upon Alice: " Give them
yourself to Lord Glenaryon : I cannot
see him.--You may betray me, if it is
your inclination ; I am in your power ;
but to save is not. Therefore, do not
attempt it...." The attendant had no
difficult task in executing this errand.
She met Lord Glenarvon himself, at the
door of the library.
Upon alighting from his horse, he had
enquired for Lady Margaret Buchanan;
before she was prepared to receive him,
the
papers were delivered into his hands;
he
gave
them to O'Kelly; and after pay-
ing a shorter visit to Lady Margaret than
at first he had intended, he returned to
the inn at Belfont, to peruse them. First
however he looked upon the broach, and
taking up the ring, he pressed it to his
lips and sighed, for he remembered it

and her to whom it had been given.
Upon this emerald ring, the words :
" Eterna fede," had been inscribed. He
had placed it upon his little favourite's
hand, in token of his fidelity, when first
he had told her of his love ; time had
worn off and defaced the first impression;
and " Eterno dolor," had been engraved
by her in its placethus telling in few
words the whole history of love"the im-
mensity of its promises the cruelty of its
disappointment."
Calantha was preparing to answer Gle-
narvon's letter : her whole soul was ab-
sorbed in grief, when Sophia entered and
informed her that the Admiral was ar-
rived. It was, she knew, his custom to
come and go without much ceremony;
but his sudden presence, and at such a
moment, overpowered her. Perhaps too,
her husband might be with him ! she
fell: Sophia called for assistance. "Good

She soon saw by his hearty open
countenance, that he was perfectly igno-
rant of all that had occurred; and to
keep him so, was now her earnest endea-
vour. But she was unused to deceit: all
her attempts at it were forced : it was not
in her nature; and pride alone, not bet-
ter feeling prevented its existence.

Sir RICHARD apologized for his abrupt
appearance: and told Calantha that he
had been with Lord Avondale to visit his
relations at Monteith, where he had left
him employed, as he said, from morning
till night, with his troops in quelling dis-
turbances and administeringjustice, which
he performed but ill, having, as he ex-
pressed it, too kind a heart. He then as-
sured her that her husband had promised
to meet him on the present day at the cas-
tle, and enquired of herif she knew where-
fore his return had been delayed. She
in reply informed him, that he had no.
intention of joining them, and even pro-
duced his last cold letter, in which he
told her that she might visit him at Allen-
water, at the end of the month, with the
children, if all continued tranquil in:

66 And per-
those quarters. She spoke this in an em-
barrassed manner; her colour changed
repeatedly ; and her whole appearance
was so dissimilar from that to which the
Admiral had been accustomed, that he
could not but observe it.
Sir Richard, having with seeming care-
lessness, repeated the words, 6. He'll be
here this week, that's certain," now ad-
dressed himself to the children, telling
Harry Mowbrey the same,
haps he'll bring you toys." "He'll bring
himself," said the child," and that's
better," "Right, my gallant boy," re-
turned the Admiral ; "and you are a fine
little fellow for saying so." Thus encou-
raged, the child continued to prattle.
" I want no toys now, uncle Richard.
See I have a sword, and a seal too. Will
you look at the impression :- the harp
means Ireland: Independence is the
motto; we have no crown; we want no
kings." "And who gave you this seal ?"
said Sir Richard, fiercely.

" I like no rebel chiefs, not I;" and he
" Are you angry with

miral had nbserved Calantha's agitation,
and noted the boy's answers; for he left
the room abruptly, and was cold and
cross the rest of the day.

possibly owing to this circumstance that
the Admiral, who was not a remarkably
keen observer, had opportunity and lei-
sure to watch Calantha's conduct. In
a moment she perceived the suspicion
that occurred; but as he was neither
very refined, nor very sentimental, ir

tual guilt, or one desire to save her from

its consequences:-it occurred with hor-
ror, abhorrence and contempt. Unable
to conceal the least thing or to moderate
his indignation, he resolved, without de-
lay, to seize the first opportunity of taxing
her with her ill conduct. In the mean time
she felt hardened and indfferent; and,
instead of attempting to conciliate, by
haughty looks and a spirit of defiance,
she rendered herself hateful to every
observer.
That compassion, which is
sometimes felt and cherished for a young
offender, could not be felt for her ; nor
did she wish to inspire it. Desperate and
insensible, she gloried in the cause of
her degradation; and the dread of causing
her aunt's death, and casting disgrace
upon her husband's name, alone retained
her one hour from Glenarvon.
On the very day of the Admiral's ar-
rival, he heard enough concerning Calan-
tha to excite his most vehement indigna-
tion; and at the hour of dinner, therefore,
as he passed her he called her by a name

too horrible to repeat. Stung to the
soul, she refused to enter the dining-
room ; and, hastening with fury to her
own apartment, gave vent to the storm of
passion by which she was wholly over-
powered. There, unhappily, she found
a letter from her lover-all kindness, all
warmth. " One still there is," she said,
" who loves, who feels for the guilty,
the fallen Calantha." Every word she
read, and compared with the cold neg-
lect of others, or their severity and con-
tempt. There was none to fold her to
their bosom, and draw her back from
certain perdition. She even began to
think with Glenarvon, that they wished
her gone. Some feelings of false honor,
too, inclined her to imagine that she
ought to leave a situation, for which she
now must consider herself wholly unfit.
But there was one voice which still re-
called her :-it was her child's. "My boy
will awake, and find me gonehe shall
never have to reproach his mother." And

she stood uncertain how to act. Mrs.Sey-
mour, to her extreme astonishment, was
the only person who interrupted these re-
flections. She was the last she had expected
to do so. She had read in the well-known
lineaments of Calantha's face :that face
which, as a book, she had perused from
infancy, some desperate project :-the ir-
ritation, the passionate exhibition of grief
was pastshe was calm. Sophia, at Mrs.
Seymour's request, had therefore written
to Calantha. She now gave her the letter.
But it was received with sullen pride :-
" Read this, Lady Avondale," she said,
and left the room. Calantha never looked
at her, or she might have seen that she
was agitated ; but the words"Read
this, Lady Avondale," repressed all emo-
tion in her. It was long before she could
bring herself to open Sophia's letter. A
servant entered with dinner for her.
" The Admiral begs you will drink a
glass of wine," he said. She made no
answer ; but desired her maid to take it

375
away, and leave her. She did not even
perceive that Mac Allain, who was the
bearer of this message, was in tears.
Sophia's letter was full of common-
place truisms, and sounding periods
a sort of treatise upon vice, beginning
with a retrospect of Calantha's past life,
and ending with a cold jargon of worldly
considerations. A few words, written in
another hand, at the conclusion, affected
her more:they were from her aunt, Mrs.
Seymour.
" You talk of leaving us, of
braving misfortunes, Lady Avondale,"
she said : "you do not contemplate, you
cannot conceive, the evils you thus deride.
I know; yes, well I know, you will not
be able to bear up under them. Ah! be-
lieve me, Calantha, guilt will make the
proudest spirit sink, and your courage
will fail you at the moment of trial. Why
then seek it?-My child, time flies ra-
pidly, and it may no longer be permitted
you to return and repent. You now fly
from reflection ; but it will overtake you

GLENARVON,
when too late to recall the emotions of
virtue. Ah! remember the days of your
childhood ; recollect the high ideas you
had conceived of honor and purity
what disdain you felt for those who
willingly deviated from the line of duty :
-how true, how noble, how just were
all your feelings. You have forsaken all;
and you began by forsaking him who
created and protected you! What won-
der, then, that having left your religion
and your God, you have abandoned every
other tie that held you back from evil !
Say, where do you mean to check your
course? Are you already guilty in more
than thought ? -No, no ; I will never
believe it; but yet, even if this were so,
pause before you cast public dishonor
upon your husband and innocent chil-
dren. Oh ! repent, repent, it is not yet
too late."
" It is too late," said Calantha, spring-
ing up, and tearing the letter: "it is too
late;" and nearly suffocated with the

agony of her passionate grief. She gasped
for breath, " Oh ! that it were not. I
cannot-I dare not stay to meet the eyes
of an injured husband, to see him un-
suspicious, and know that I have betrayed
him. This is too liard to bear a death

of this; and then to part, my aunt knows
not, nor cannot even conceive, the tor-
ture of that word. She never felt what

every thing, the extremes of ecstacy and
agony. Oh! who can endure it. They
may tear my heart to pieces ; but never
hope that I will consent to leave Glenar-
von."
The conciousness of these feelings, the
agitation of her mind, and the dread of
Lord Avondale's return, made her meet
Sophia, who now entered her apartment
with some coldness. The scene that fol-
lowed need not be repeated. All that a

to upbraid, vilify and humiliate, was ut-
tered by Miss Seymour ; and all in vain.
She left her therefore, with much indig-
nation; and, seeing that her mother was
preparing to enter the apartment she had
quitted: "O! go not to her," she said ;
" you will find only a hardened sinner ;
you had best leave her to herself. My
friendship and patience are tired out at
last; I have forborne much ; but I can

her to her bosom. She would have
turned from her, but she could not. "I
am not come to speak to you on any un-
pleasant subject," she said.

her face, not to behold her aunt: " all I

will not grieve him."

change of manner in her aunt produced
the deepest impression upon Lady Avon-
dale. She looked, too, so like her mother,
at the moment, that Calantha thought it
had been her. She gave her her hand: she
could not speak. "And did they tell me
she was hardened?" said Mrs. Seymour.
" Pause, my

"I knew it could not b: my child, my
own Calantha, will never act with cruelty
towards those who love her. Say only
the single words, " I will not leave you,"
and I will trust you without one fear."
" I will not leave you!" said Calantha,
weeping bitterly, and throwing herself
upon her aunt's bosom. " If it break
my heart, I will never leave you, unless
driven from these doors!" Little more
was said by either of them. Mrs. Sey-
mour was deeply affected, and so was
Calantha.
After she had quitted her, not an hour
had elapsed, when Sir Richard, without
preparation, entered. His presence stifled
every good emotion--froze up every tear.
Calantha stood before him with a look of
contempt and defiance, he could not bear.
Happily for her, he was called away, and
she retired early to bed.

Avondale's has the greatest share of impu-
dence," said the Admiral, addressing the

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
The next morning, regardless of the
presence of the nurses and the children,
who were in Lady Avondale's apartment:
regardless, indeed, of any consideration,
but that which rage and indignation had
justly excited, the Admiral again entered
Calantha's room, and in a high exulting
tone, informed her that he had written to
hasten her husband's return. As to
Avondale d'ye see," he continued,

German sentiments, not he: and he will
no more put up with these goings on,
than I shall; nor shall you pallaver him
over: for depend upon it, I will open his
eyes, unless from this very moment you
change your conduct. Yes, my Lady
Calantha, you look a little surprised, I
see, at hearing good English spoken to

you; but I am not one who can talk all
that jargon of sensibility, they prate
round me here. You have the road
open;
you are young, and may mend yet; and
if you do, I will think no more of the
past. And as to you, Mrs. Nurse, see
that these green ribbands be doffed. I
prohibit Lord Mowbrey and Lady Anna-
bel from wearing them. I hate these re-
bellious party colours. I am for the
King, and old England; and a plague on
the Irish marauders, and my Lord Gle-
narvon at the head of them who will
not take ye, let me tell you, lady fair, for
all your advances. I heard him say so
myself, aye, and laugh too, when the
Duke told him to be off, which he did,
though it was in a round about way; for
they like here, to press much talk into
what might be said in a score of words.
So you need not look so mighty proud ;
for I shall not let you stir from these
apartments, do you see, till my nephew
comes; and then, God mend you, or take

you, for we will not bear with these pro-
ceedings, not we of the navy, whatever
your land folks may do."
" Sir Richard," said Calantha, " you
may spare yourself and me this unkind-
ness, I leave this house immediately
I leave your family from this hour; and
I will die in the very streets sooner than
remain here. Take this," she said, throw-
ing the marriage ring from her hand;
"s and tell your nephew I never will see
him more: tell him, if it is your pleasure,
that I love another, and had rather be a
slave in his service, than Lord Avondale's
wife. I ever hated that name, and now
I consider it with abhorrence." Your
Ladyship's words are big and mighty,"
cried Sir Richard ; 66 but while this
goodly arm has a sinew, and this most
excellent door has a key, you shall not
stir from hence." As he yet spoke, he
advanced to the door ; but she, darting
before him, with a celerity he had not
expected, left him, exclaiming as she

went, you have driven me to this : tell
them you have done it"
...
In vain the Admiral urged every
one he met to pursue Calantha. The
moment had been seized, and no power
can withstand, no after attempt can re-
gain the one favorable moment that is
thus snatched from fate. The castle pre-
sented a scene of the utmost confusion
and distress. Miss Seymour was indig-
nant; the servants were in commotion ;
the greatest publicity was given to the
event from the ill judged indiscretion of
the Admiral. Mrs. Seymour alone was
kept in ignorance; the Duke coldly, in
reply to the enquiry of what was to be
done, attirmed that no step should be
taken, unless, of herself, the unhappy Ca-
lantha returned to seek the pardon and
protection of those friends whom she had
so rashly abandoned, and so cruelly mis-
used. Yet, notwithstanding the prohi-

bition, every place was searched, every
measure to save was thought of, and all
without success.
Sir Richard then sat down with Anna-
bel in his arms, and the little boy by his
side, crying more piteously than the nurse
who stood opposite encreasing the general
disturbance, by her loud and ill-timed
lamentations, " If my Lord had not
been the best of husbands, there would
have been some excuse for my Lady."
" None, nursenone whatever," sobbed
forth Sir Richard, in a voice scarcely
audible, between passion and vexation.
She was a good mother, poor Lady :

" and that I must say for her." After
which, the children joining, the cries and
sobs were renewed by the nurse, and Sir
Richard, with more violence than at first.
" I never thought it would have come to
this," said the nurse, first recovering.

Who would have thought such a pretty
looking gentleman would have turned
out such a villain !" " He is no gentle-
man at all," said Sir Richard angrily.
" He is a rebel, an outcast. Shame upon
him." And then again the nurse's cries
checked his anger, and he wept more
audibly than before.
" Would you believe it, after all your
kindness," said Sophia, entering her
mother's room, "Calantha is gone." At
the words, " she is gone," Mrs. Seymour
fainted; nor did she for some timerecover;
but with returning sense, when she saw
not Calantha, when asking repeatedly for
her, she received evasive answers; terror
again overcame her-she was deeply and
violently agitated. She sent for the chil-
dren ; she clasped them to her bosom.
They smiled upon her; and that look,
was a pang beyond all others of bitter-

ness. The Admiral, in tears, approached
her ; lamented his interference ; yet
spoke with just severity of the offender.
" If I know her heart, she will yet re-
turn," said Mrs. Seymour. "She will
never more return,' replied Sophia.
" How indeed will she dare appear, after
such a public avowal of her sentiments
such a flagrant breach of every sacred
duty. Oh, there is no excuse for the
mother who thus abandons her children
--for the wife who stamps dishonour on
a husband's fame for the child that
dares to disobey a father's sacred will !"
" Sophia, beware. Judge not of others-
judge not ; for the hour of temptation
may come to all. Oh judge her not,"
said Mrs. Seymour, weeping bitterly ;
" for she will yet return.'
Towards evening Mrs. Seymour again
enquired for Calantha. They told her
she had not been heard of; her agitation
proved too well the doubt she entertained.

" Send again," she continually said, and
her hand, which Lady Margaret held in
hers, became cold and trembling. They
endeavoured to comfort her ; but what
comfort was there left? They tried to
detain her in her own apartment ; but
the
agony of her sufferings was too great;
-her feeble frame-her wasted form,
could ill endure so great a shock. The
Duke, affected beyond measure, endea-
voured to support her.
" Pardon her,
receive her with kindness," said Mrs.
Seymour, looking at him. "I know she
will not leave you thus: I feel that she
must return.' 66 We will receive her
without one reproach," said the Duke.
"I, too, feel secure that she will return."
"I know her heart: she can never leave
us thus. Go yourself, Altamonte," said
Lady Margaret."Let me go," "Where
would you seek her?" " At Lord Gle-
narvon's," said Mrs. Seymour, faintly.
66 Oh! she is not there," said the Duke,

" She never will act in a manner we must
not pardon." Mrs. Seymour trembled at
these words-she was ill, most ill; and
they laid her upon the bed, and watched
in silence and agony around her.
The Duke repeated sternly : I trust
she is not gone to Lord Glenarvon-all
else I can forgive.

GLENARVON,
CHAPTER I.
Love, though, when guilty, the parent of
every crime, springs forth in the noblest
hearts, and dwells ever with the gene-
rous and the high-minded. The flame
that is kindled by Heaven burns
brightly and steadily to the last ; its ob-
ject great and superior, sustained by
principle, and incapable of change; but,
when unsupported by these pure feel-
ings, it rages and consumes us, burns up
and destroys every noble hope, perverts
the mind, and fills with craft and false.
hood every avenue to the heart. Then
that which was a paradise becomes a hell,
and the victim of its power a maniac and
& fiend. They know not the force of

passion, who have not felt it-they know
not the agony of guilt, who have not
plunged into its burning gulf, and trem-
bled there. O! when the rigorous and
the just turn with abhorrence from the
fearful sight---when, like the pharisee,
in the pride of their unpolluted hearts,
they bless their God that they are not
as this sinner, let them beware ; for the
hour of trial may come to all; and that
alone is the test of superior strength.
When man, reposing upon himself, dis-
dains the humility of acknowledging his
offences and his weakness before his
Creator, on the sudden that angry God
sees fit to punish him in his wrath, and
he who has appeared invulnerable till
that hour, falls prostrate at once before
the blow; perhaps then, for the first
time, he relents; and, whilst he sinks
himself, feels for the singer whom, in the
pride and presumption of his happier
day, he had mocked at and despised.
There is no trial which human frailty

cannot resist-..there is no passion im-
planted in the heart's core, which reason
cannot subdue, if we call upon our God
to assist us; but, when unsupported by
his strength, every temptation that assails
us may overcome us, and the remem-
brance of our own weakness should teach
us to be humble in ourselves.
Fallen, miserable Calantha! where
now are the promises of thy youth...the
bright prospects of thy happiness? Where
is that unclouded brow---that joyous
look of innocence which once bespoke a
heart at ease? Is it the same, who, with

look with which it was received, re.

curred. A moment's reflection changed
the rash resolve; and hastening forward,
she knew not whither--- she cared not to
what fate, she found herself, after a long
and weary walk, at the vicar's house, near
Kelladon.--a safe asylum and retreat.
The boat which had conveyed het
from the shore, returned; and a few
hours after brought Glenarvon to the
other side of the rocks, known in the
country by the name of the Wizard's
Glen, and ofttimes the scene of tumult
and rebellious meeting. Calantha little
expected to see him. He met her to-
wards evening, as weary and trembling
she stood, uncertain whither to fly, or
how to act. The moment of meeting
was terrible to both ; but that which
followed was more agonizing still. A
servant of her father's had discovered
her after a long search. He informed
her of her aunt's illness and terror; he
humbly, but firmly, urged her instantly
to return.

Calantha had resolved never to do so;
but, lost as she was, the voice of her
aunt still had power to reach her heart---
" Is she very ill? Very dangerously
ill," said the man; and without a mo-
ment's delay, she immediately consented
to return. She resolved to part from him
she adored ; and Glenarvon generously
agreed to restore her to her aunt, whose
sufferings had affected his heart---whose
prayers had moved him, as he said, to
the greatest sacrifice he ever was called
upon to make. Yet still he upbraided
her for her flight, and affirmed, that had
she but confided herself to him, she had
long before this been far away from scenes
so terrible to witness, and been spared a
state of suspense so barbarons to endure.
Whilst he spoke, he gazed upon her with
much sadness,
"I will leave you," he said; "but the
time may come when you will repent,
and call in vain for me. They may tear
my heart from out my breasto--they may

can relinquish thee. But have they

-- when insecure of thy affections, and
yet innocent, to fly thee had been 
duty; to save thee had been an angel's
act of mercy and of virtue ; but now,
when thou art mine, when, sacrificing
the feelings of thy heart for others, thou
dost leave me, can you believe that I
would add to your grief, and increase my
own? Can you believe him you love
so base as this? Oh! yes, Calantha, I
have acted the part of such a villain to
your lost friend, that even you mistrust
me." She reassured him. " I have gi,
ven my very soul to you, Glenarvon !
I believe in you as I once did in Hea-
ven. I had rather doubt myself and
every thing than you."
She now expressed an anxiety to re-
turn and see her aunt.  Yet, Calantha,
it may perhaps be said that you have
fled to me.
The stain then is indelible.
Think of it, my beloved; and think, if I

say that I wished not to retain you,
They know me not; they guess not
what I feel; and the world, ever apt to
judge by circumstances imperfectly re-
lated, will imagine".... ...." At such a
moment, " said Calantha, impatiently,
ajt is of little importance what is thought.
When the heart suffers keenly, all the
sayings of others are of little weight. Let
them think the worst, and utter what
they think. When we fall, as I have
done, we are far beyond their power ;.
the venomed shaft of malice cannot
wound; for the blow under which we
sink is alone heeded. I feel now but
this---that I am going to part from you."
Glenarvon looked at her, and the tears
filled his eyes.
Thy love," he said,
" was the last light of Heaven that
beamed upon my weary pilgrimage ; thy
presence recalled me from error; thy soft
voice stilled every furious passion. It is
all past now; I care not what becomes
of me." As he spoke, they approached

the boat, and entering it, sailed with a
gentle breeze across the bay. Not a
wave rippled---not a cloud obscured the
brightness of the setting sun.
How
tranquil and lovely is the evening!"
said Glenarvon, as the bark floated upon
the smooth surface. " It is very calm
now," she replied, as she observed the
serenity of his countenance. " But, ah!
who knows how soon the dreadful storms
may arise, and hurry us to destruction."
The boat touched the shore, where a
crowd of spectators were assembled---
some watching from the top of the cliff,
and others idly gazing upon the sea.
The figure of Elinor distinctly appeared
amongst the former, as bending forward,
she eagerly watched for Glenarvon. Her
hat and plume distinguished her from
the crowd ; and the harp, her constant
companion, sounded at intervals on the
breeze in long and melancholy cadences.
Her dark wild eye fixed itself upon him
as he approached. "It is my false lover,"

she said, and shrieked. " Hasten, dear

where we are so much observed. That
wretched girl may, perhaps, follow us.
Hasten; for see with what rapidity she
advances.' " Let her come," replied
Calantha. "I am too miserable myself
to turn from those who are unhappy."
Elinor approached; she gazed on them
as they passed; she strained her eyes to
catch one last glimpse of Glenarvon as
he turned the path.
Many of his friends, retainers, and
followers were near.

the castle; but Elinor, returning to her
harp, struck the chords with enthusiasm,

CHAPTER II.
The moment of enthusiasm was past ;
the setting sun warned every straggler
and passenger to return. Some had a
far distant home to seek ; others liad left
their wives or their children. Elinor
turned from the golden light which illu-
minated the west, and gazed in agony
upon the gloomy battlements of St.
Alvin Priory, yet resplendent with the
last parting ray. Of all who followed
her, few only now remained to watch
her steps. She bade them meet her at

was weary, and feigned that till then

cliff, till the pale moon broke through

fully in the soft breeze of night.
My heart's fit to break, yet no tear fills my eye,
As I gaze on the moon, and the clouds that flit by.
The moon shines so fair, it reminds me of thee;
But the clouds that obscure it, are emblems of me.
They will pass like the dream of our pleasures and
youth ;
They will pass like the promise of honor and truth;
And bright thou shalt shine, when these shadows
are gone,
All radiant-serene -unobscur'd; but alone.
"And did he pass me so coldly by?
And did he not once look on me?" she
said. "But I will not weep: he shall
not break my spirit and heart. Let him

do so to the tame doves for whom he has
forsaken me.
Let such as Alice and
Calantha die for his love: I will not."
She took her harp: her voice was tired
and feeble. She faintly murmured the
feelings of her troubled soul. It sounded
like the wind, as it whispered through
the trees, or the mournful echo of some
far distant flute.

"Are these poetical effusions ended?"
said a soft voice from behind.-She start-
ed; and turning round, beheld the figure
of a man envelloped in a dark military
cloak, waiting for her upon the cliff.
"What a night it is! not a wave on the
calm sea: not a cloud in the Heavens.
See how the mountain is tinged with the
bright moonshine. Are you not chillid
Are you not weary; wandering thus
alone?" "I am prepared to follow you,"
said Elinor, "though not as a mistress,
yet as a slave." "I do not love you,"
said the man, approaching her. "Oh, even
if you were to hang about and kneel
to me as once, I cannot love you! Yet

Elinor, while a proud blush burned on her
cheek. " This is no time for retrospec-
tion." "Let us hasten forwards, by the
light of the moon: I perceive that we
are late ---Have you forgiven me?"
" There are injuries, Glenarvon, too
great to be forgiven: speak not of the
past: let us journey on.'
The lashing of the waves against the
rocks, alone disturbed the silence of the
scene. They walked in haste by each
others side, till they passed Craig Allen
Point, and turned into the mouth of a
deep cavern. Whispers were then heard
from every side---the confusion of strange
voices, the jargon of a foreign dialect,
the yells and cries of the mutineers and
discontented. "Strike a light," said
Elinor's companion, in a commanding
tone, as he advanced to the mouth of
the rock.---In a moment, a thousand
torches blazed around, whilst shouts of
joy proclaimed a welcome to the visitor,

" How many have taken the oath to-

vancing to the front line. "Sure, Citizen

answered O'Kelly from within. The
ferocious band of rebels were now or-

exhibiting strange marks of lawless and

The cry of enthusiasm has ceased. Eli.

cavern. Before she parted for the night,
she asked him respecting one he loved,
" Where is Calantha ?" she said. "In
yon dreary prison," he replied, pointing
to Castle Delaval:-" like a rose torn from
the parent stem, left to perish in all its
sweetness -gathered by the hand of the
spoiler, and then abandoned. I have
left her." " You look miserable, my
Lord." " My countenance is truer to
my feelings than I could have supposed."
" Alice dead-Calantha discarded! I
heard the tale, but it left no credit with
me.--Can there be hearts so weak as

other attachments; that you would bear
her hence." "I have changed my in-
tention: is that sufficient?" " Will she

6. Your uncle will, if
you continue thus," replied Glenarvon.
" I am sick at heart, Elinor, when I look
on you." "Old men, my Lord, will
seek the grave; and death can strike
young hearts, when vain men think it their
doing. I must leave you." " Where-
fore in such haste ?" 166 A A younger and
truer lover a waits my coming: I am his,
to follow and obey him." Oh, Elinor,
I tremble at the sight of so much cold
depravity--so young and so abandoned.
How changed from the hour in which I
first met you at Glenaa! Can it be pos-
sible?" " Aye, my good Lord; so apt

Glenarvon attempted to seize her hand.

St. Clare, as she spoke, stood upon
the edge of the high cliff to which they
had ascended. The moon shone brightly
on her light figure, which seemed to
spring from the earth, as if impelled for-
ward by the strength of passion. The
belt of gold which surrounded her slen-
der waist burst, as if unable longer to
contain the proud swelling of her heart :
she threw the mantle from her shoulders;
and raising the hat and plume from her
head, waved it high in the air: then
darting forward, she fled hastily from the
grasp of Glenarvon, who watched her
lessening form till it appeared like a
single speck in the distance, scarce vi.
sible to the eye.

BEFORE Glenarvon had met Elinor upon
the cliff, he had conducted Lady Avon-

son who came forward to meet them was
Sir Richard. My dear child," he said,
" what could have induced you to take
in such a serious manner what was meant

one room; and every one in fits or mad
in different parts of the house. The
whole thing will be known all over the

people talk, they never know what they
say, and add, and add, till it makes a
terrible story. But come in, do; for if

there, why it seems after all he is a
very good sort of fellow; and had no
mind to have you ; which is what I
hinted at before you set out, and might
have saved you a long walk, if you would
only have listened to reason. But come
in, do; for all the people are staring at
you, as if they had never seen a woman
before. Not but what I must say, such
a comical one, so hot and hasty, I never
happened to meet with; which is my
fault, and not your's. Therefore, come
in; for I hate people to do any thing
that excites observation. There now;
did not I tell you so ? Here are all your
relations perfectly crazy: and we shall
have a scene in the great hall, if you
don't make haste and get up stairs before
they meet you.

she wept at beholding her. But Ca-

" welcome

whose tears flowed fast, " receive my
prayers, my thanks for this," she ex.
claimed. "Heaven bless you for restoring
my child to me.'
" Take her," said Lord Glenarvon,
placing Calantha in Mrs. Seymour's
arms; " and be assured, I give to you
what is dearer to me, far dearer than
existence. I do for your sake what F
would not for any other: I give up that
which I sought, and won, and would
have died to retain that which would
have made life dear, and which, being
taken from me, leaves me again to a dull
blank, and dreary void. Oh! feel for
what I have resisted; and forgive the
past." "I cannot utter my thanks,"
said Mrs. Seymour. "Generous Glen-
arvon! God reward you for it, and bless
you." She gave him her hand.
Glenarvon received the applauses of
all; and he parted with an agitation so

violent, and apparently so unfeigned, that
even the duke, following, said, "We
shall see you, perhaps, to-morrow: we
shall ever, I am sure, see you with de-
light." Calantha alone shared not in
these transports; for her agony was be-
yond endurance. Oh, that she too could
have thought Glenarvon sincere and ge-
nerous; that she too, in parting from
him, could have said, a moment of pas-
sion and my own errors have misled
him!-but he has a noble nature. Had
he taken her by the hand, and said
Calantha, we both of us have erred; but
it is time to pause and repent: stay
with a husband who adores you: live to
atone for the crime you have committed:
she had done so. But he reproached
her for her weakness; scorned her for
the contrition he said she only affected
to feel; and exultingly enquired of her
whether, in the presence of her husband,
she should ever regret the lover she had
lost.

but if that to which we have bound our
selves is base, the contagion spreads
swiftly, and the very soul becomes black

It came :---Glenarvon came, as he had
promised: he asked permission to see
her one moment alone : he was not de.

her tears; then pressing her hand, he
inquired if she really thought that he
would leave her: " What now---now
that every secret of my soul is your's?
Look at me, thou dear one: look again
upon your master, and never acknow-

" God bless and protect
you," she answered.
Thanks, sweet,
for your prayer.

eye? What ecstasy is it thus to call you
mine? Oh, tear from your mind every
remaining scruple !---shrink not. The

There's a fire burns in thee, fierce as in

As he spoke, he placed around her
neck a chain of gold, with a locket of
diamonds, containing his hair, saying as
he fastened it " Remember the ring ;

triumph is secure. Think of me when
I am away; dream of me in the night,
as that dear cheek slumbers upon its
pillow. Our's has been but a short-tried
friendship, but the pupils of Glenarvon
never can forget their master. Better
they had lived for years in folly and vice
than one hour in the presence of such as
I am. Do you repent, love? It is im-

the weak and the old, and taste the con-
solation love alone can offer. What can
heal its injuries? What remove its re-
grets? What shew you its vanity and
illusion but itself? This hour we enjoy
its transports, and to-morrow, sweet, we
must liv upon its remembrance.
Farewell, beloved. Never let, or father
or husband teach thee to forget me. Dis-

CHAPTER V.
The repetition of a lover's promises is
perhaps as irksome to those who
may
coldly peruse them, as the remembrance
is delightful to those who have known
the happiness of receiving them. It may
indeed be held immoral to exhibit, in
glowing language, scenes which ought
never to have been at all; but when
every day, and every hour of the day---
at all times, and in all places, and in all
countries alike, man is gaining possession
of his victim by similar arts, to paint
the portrait to the life, to display his
base intentions, and their mournful con-
sequences, is to hold out a warning and
admonition to innocence and virtue ;
this cannot be wrong. All deceive them
selves. At this very instant of time, what

thousands of beguiled and credulous-be-
ings are saying to themselves in the pride
of their hearts, "I am not like Ca.
lantha," or, " thanks be to Heaven, the
idol of my fancy is not a Glenarvon."
They deem themselves virtuous, because
they are yet only upon the verge of ruin ;
they think themselves secure, because
they know not yet the heart of him who
would mislead them. But the hour of
trial is at hand ; and the smile of scorn
may soon give place to the bitter tear of
repentance.
Many can deceive," said Glenarvon,
mournfully gazing on Calantha whilst she
wept; " but is your lover like the com-
mon herd? Oh! we have loved, my gen-
tle inistress, better than they know how:
we have dared the utmost : your mind
and mine must not even be compared
with their's. Let the vulgar dissemble
and fear---let them talk idly in the un-
meaning jargon they admire: they never
felt what we have felt; they never dared

what we have done : to win, and to be-
tray, is with them an air---a fancy: and
fit is the delight for the beings who can
enjoy it. Such as these, a smile or a
frown) may gain or lose in a moment. But
tell me, Calantha, have we felt nothing
more? I who could command you, am
your slave: every tear you shed is an-
swered not by my eyes alone, but in my
heart of hearts ; and is there that on earth
I would not, will not sacrifice for you?
"I know they will wound you, and
frown on you because of me; but if once
I shew myself again, the rabble must
shrink at last; they dare not stand before
Glenarvon. Heaven, or hell, I care not
which, have cast a ray so bright around
my brow, that not all the perfidy of a
heart as lost as mine, of a heart loaded,
as you know too well, with crimes mau
shudders even to imagine--- not all the
envy and malice of those whom my
contempt has stung, can lower me to their
level. And you, Calantha, do you
think

you will ever learn to hate me, even were
I to leave, and to betray you ? Poor
blighted flower, which I have cherished
in my bosom, when scorned and trampled
on, because you have followed him whom
all had gladly sought, if I had so but willed
it! Were I to subject you to the racking
trial of frantic jealousy, and should you
ever be driven by fury and vengeance to
betray me, you would but harm yourself.
To thy last wretched hour, thou wouldst
pine in unavailing recollection and re-
gret; as Clytie, though bound and fettered
to the earth, still fixes her uplifted eyes
upon her own sun, who passes over, re-
gardless in his course, nor deigns to cast
a look below."
It was at a late hour that night, when
after again receiving the thanks of a
whole family--when after hearing himself
called the preserver of the wretch who
scarcely dared to encounter his eyes,
Lord Glenarvon took a last and faltering
leave of Calantha. Twice he returned

and paused: he knew not how to say
farewell : it seemed as if his lips trem-
bled beneath the meaning of that fearful
word.--as if he durst not utter a knell
to so much love---a death to every long-
cherished hope. At length, in a slow
and solemn voice, " Farewell, Calantha,"
he said. "God forgive us both, and bless
you." Lady Avondale for one instant
ventured to look upon him: it was but
to impress upon her memory every fea-
lure, every lineament, and trace of that
image, which had reigned so powerfully
over her heart. Had thousands been
present, she had seen but that one :---
had every danger menaced him, he had
not moved. Thus in the agony of re-
gret they parted; but that regret was
shared ; and as he glanced his eye for
the last time on her, he pointed to the
chain which he wore with her resem-
blance near his heart; and he bade her
take comfort in the thought that absence
could never tear that image from him.

in absence; every idea but one image is
banished as profane. Lady Avondale
had sacrificed herself and Glenarvon, as
she then thought, for others ; but she

she had voluntarily inflicted.

a speedy return, She felt no horror
at her conduct. She deceived herself:
conscience itself had ceased to reprove a
heart so absorbed, so lost in the laby-
rinth of guilt. Lord Avondale wrote to
her but seldom : she heard however with
uneasiness that his present situation was
one that exposed him to much danger;
and after a skirmish with the rebels,
when she was informed that he was safe,
she knelt down and said, " Thank God
for it!" as if he had still been dear.
His letters, however, were repulsive and

cold. Glenarvon's, on the other hand,
breathed the life and soul of love.
In one of these letters, Glenarvon in-
formed her, that he was going to Eng-
land, to meet at Mortanville Priory se
veral of his friends. Lady Mandeville,
Lady Augusta Selwyn, and Lady Tre-
lawney, were to be of the party. " I care
not," he said, " who may be there; this
I know too well, that my Calantha will
not." He spoke of lady Mowbrey and
Lady Elizabeth with praise. "Oh! if
your Avondale be like his sister, whom I
have met with since we parted, what
indeed have you not sacrificed for me ?"
He confided to her, that Lady Mande-
ville had entreated him to visit her in
London: "But wbat delight can I find
in her society ?" he said; " it will only
remind me of one I have lost."
His letter, after his arrival in England,
ended thus: " I will bear this separation
as long as I can, my Calantha; but my
health is consumed by my regret; and,

whatever you may do, I live alone-en-
tirely alone. We may be alone in the
midst of crowds; and if indifference, nay,
almost dislike to others, is a proof of at-
tachment to you, you will be secure and
satisfied. I had a stormy passage from
Ireland. Is it ominous of future trouble?
Vain is this separation.
"I will bear with it for a short period:

and the rushing of waters, accord with

eternity ? Fear you, Calantha ? Oh, not

After his arrival at Mortanville Priory,
Glenarvon wrote to Calantha a minute
account of every one there. He seemed
to detajl to her his inmost thoughts. He
thus expressed himself concerning Miss
Monmouth :..." Do you remember how
often we have talked together of Miss
Monmouih? You will hear, perhaps,
that I have seen much of her of late.
Remember she is thy relative; but oh!
how unlike my own, my beloved Cae
lantha! Yet she pleases me well enough.
They will, perhaps, tell you that I have
shewn her some little attention. Pos-
sibly this is true; but, Heaven be my wit-
ness,
I never for one moment even have
thought seriously about her." Lady

Trelawney, in writing to her sister,
thought rather differently. It was thus
that she expressed herself upon that sub-
ject. " However strange you may think
it," she said in her letter to Sophia,
Lord Glenarvon has made a proposal
of marriage to Miss Monmouth. I do
not believe what you tell me of his con-
tinuing to write to Calantha.
If he does,
it is only by way of keeping her quiet;
for I assure you he is most serious in his
intentions, Miss Monmouth admires,
indeed I think loves him; yet she has
not accepted his offer. Want of know-
ledge of his character, and some fear of
his principles, have made her for the
present decline it. But their newly made
friendship is to continue; and any one
may see how it will end. In the mean
time, Lord Glenarvon has already con-
soled himself for her refusal...but I will
explain all this when we meet.

often. t is most absurd, believe me.
Nothing, I think, can be more wanting
in dignity than a woman's continuing to
persecute a man who is evidently tired
of her. He ever avoids all conversation
on this topic; but with me, in private,
I have heard a great deal, which makes
me think extremely well of him. You
know how violent Calantha is in all
things:---it seems in the present in-
stance, that her love is of so mad and
absurd a nature, that it is all he can do
to prevent her coming after him. Such
things, too, as she has told him! A wo-
man must have a depraved mind, even to
name such subjects.
" Now, I know you will disbelieve all
this; but at once to silence you, I have
seen some passages of her letters; and
i more forward and guilty professions none
ever assuredly ventured to make. Her

one little remembrance from a friend is
dear, to be almost bought thus is un-

herself to offer. As to Lord Glenarvon,
I like him more than ever. He has, in-
deed, the errors of youth; but his mind
is superior, and his heart full of sensi-

CHAPTER VII.
If Glenarvon's letters had given joy to
Calantha, in more prosperous and happier
days, when surrounded by friends, what
must they have appeared to her now,
when bereft of all? They were as the
light of Heaven to one immersed in
darkness; they were as health to the
wretch who has pined in sickness: they
were as riches to the poor, and joy to
the suffering heart. What then must
have been her feelings when they sud-
denly and entirely ceased! At first, she
thought the wind was contrary, and the
mails irregular. Of one thing she felt
secure---Glenarvon could not mean to
deceive her. His last letter, too, was
kinder than any other; and the words with
which he concluded it, were such as to

any chance, however improbable," he
said, "my letters fail to reach you,
impute the delay to any cause whatever:
but do ine enough justice not for one
moment to doubt of me. I will comply
with every request of your's; and from
you I require in return nothing but re-
membrance---the remembrance of one
who has forgotton himself, the world,
fame, hope, ambition.--all here, and all
hereafter, but you."
Every one perhaps has felt the tor-
tures of suspense: every one knows its
lengthened pangs :
it is unnecessary
here to paint them. Weeks now passed,
instead of days, and still not one line,
one word from Glenaryon. Then it was
that Lady Avondale thus addressed
him:
" It is in vain, my dearest friend, that
I attempt to deceive myself. It is now
two weeks since I have watched, with
incessant anxiety, for one of those dear,

with only too much warmth. Alas !
I have forgotten all the modesty and dig-

might inform me you were well, and not
offended. Lord Avondale's return, I
told you, had been delayed. His ab-
sence, bis indifference, are now my only
comfort in life. Were it otherwise, how
could I support the unmeasured guilt I
have heaped upon my soul? The friends
of my youth are estranged by my re-
peated errors and long neglect. I am as
lonely, as miserable in your absence as
you can wish.

I never will. But your sudden, your
unexpected silence, has given me more

one as fallen as I am. Think not that
I wish to repine, or that I lament the

Lady Avondale was more calm when
she had thus written. The next morning
a letter was placed in her hand. Her
heart beat high. It was from Mortan-
ville Priory :-hut it was from Lady Tre-
lawney, in answer to one stie had sent
her, and not from Glenarvon.
" Dearest cousin," said Lady Trelaw-
ney,
I have not had time to write to you
one word before. Of all the places I ever
was at, this is the most perfectly de-
lightful. Had I a spice in me of ro-
mance, I would attempt to describe it ;
but, in truth, I cannot. Tell Sophia we

thoughts, join our party. I received your
gloomy letter after dinner ! I was sitting
ou a couch by- -, shall I tell you by
whom?--by Lord Glenarvon himself.
At the moment in which it was deli.
vered, for the post comes in here at nine
in the evening, he smiled a little as he
recognized the hand; and, when I told
him you were ill, that smile becaine an
incredulous laugh ; for he knows well
enough people are never so ill as they
say. Witness himself: he is wonderfully
recovered: indeed, he is grown perfectly
delightful. I thought him uncommonly
stupid all this summer, which I attribute
now to you; for you encouraged him in
his whims and woes. Here, at least, he
is all life and good humour. Lady Au-
.
gusta says he is not the same man; but
sentiment, she affirms, undermines any
constitution; and you are rather too
much in that style.

man. I dare say you thought Lord Glen-
arvon very amiable: so do I:-and you
fancied he was in love with you, as they
call it: and I could fancy the same: and
there is one here, I am sure, may fancy
it as well as any of us : but it is so absurd
to take these things seriously. It is
his manner; and he owns himself that a
grande passion bores him to death; and
that if you will but leave him alone, he
finds a little absence has entirely restored
his senses.
By the bye, did you give him.... but
that is a secret. Only I much suspect
that he has made over all that you have
given him to another. Do the same by
him, therefore ; and have enough pride
to shew him that you are not so weak and
so much in his power as he imagines. I
shall be quite provoked if you write any
more to him. He shews all
your
letters :
I tell you this as a friend : only, now,
pray do not get me into a scrape, or re-
peat it.

GLENARVON.
" Do tell me when Lord Avondale
returns. They say there has been a real
rising in the north: but Trelawney thinks
people make a great deal of nothing at
all: he says, for his part, he believes it
is all talk and nonsense.
We are going
to London, where I hope you will meet
us. Good bye to you, dear coz.
Write
merrily, and as you used. My motto,
you know, is, laugh whilst you can,
and be grave when you must.
I have
written a long letter to my mother and
Sophia; but do not ask to see it. In-
deed, I would tell you all, if I were not
afraid you'd be so foolish as to vex your-
self about what cannot be helped."
And Lady Avondale did vex herself;
and this letter from Frances made her
mad. The punishment of crime was
then at hand :-Glenarvon had betrayed,
had abandoned her. Yet was it possible,
or was it not the malice of Frances who
wished to vex her? Calantha could not
believe him false. He had not been to

her as a common lover:-he was true :
she felt assured he was: yet her agitation
was very great. Perhaps he had been
misled, and he feared to tell her. Could
she be offended, because he had been
weak? Oh, no! he knew she could not:
he would never betray her secrets; he
would never abandon her, because a
newer favourite employed his momen-
tary thoughts. She felt secure he would
not, and she was calm.
She walked to Belfont. She met
with many of her former friends;
but they received her coldly. Lady
St. Clare drew up her head, and dropt
her an austere courtesy. Several ladies
of equally unblemished reputation, were
the first to shrink from a " fallen
sinner." She returned to the castle;
but every eye that met her's appeared to
view her with new marks of disapproba-
tion. Guilt, when bereft of support, is
ever reprobated; but see it decked in
splendour and success, and where are

they who shrink from its approach?
Calantha's name was the theme of just
censure, but in Glenarvon's presence,
who had discovered that she was thus
wortbless and degraded? And did they
think she did not see their meanness,
The proud heart is the first to sink before
contempt--it feels the wound more keen-

received with coldness, when kindness

such as we have cause to feel beneath
us, not alone in vigour of mind and spi-
rit, but even in virtue and truth. The
weak, the base, the hypocrite, are the
first to turn with indignation from their
fellow mortals in disgrace; and, wbilst
the really chaste and pure suspect with

duct, sound the alarum bell at the ap-
proach of guilt, and clamour their ana-
themas upon their unwary and cowering
prey.
For once they fell with justice ; and
in this instance their conduct was re-
ceived without resentment. There was
a darker shade on the brow, an assumed
distance of manner, a certain studied
civility, which seemed to say, that, by
favour, Lady Avondale was excused
much ; that the laws of society would
still admit her; that her youth, her rank
and high connexions, were considerations
which averted from her that stigmatising
brand, her inexcusable hehaviour other-
wise had drawn down : but still the
mark was set upon her, and she felt its
bitterness the more, because she knew
how much it had been deserved.
Yet of what avail were the reproving
looks of friends, the bitter taunts of com-
panions, whom long habit had rendered
familiar, the ill-timed menaces and rough

reproaches of some, and the innuendoes
and scornful jests of others? They only
tended to harden a mind rendered fierce
by strong passion, and strengthen the
patural violence of a character which had
set all opposition at defiance, and staked
every thing upon one throw-which had
been unused to refuse itself the smallest
gratification, and knew not how to en.
dure the first trial to which it ever had
been exposed. Kindness had been the
only remaining hope; and kindness, such
as the human heart can scarce believe
in, was shewn in vain. Yet the words
which are so spoken seldom fail to
sooth. Even when on the verge of
ruin, the devoted wretch will turn and
listen to the accents which pity and be-
nevolence vouchsafe to utter; and though
they may come too late, her last looks
and words may bless the band that was
thus stretched out to save her.
It was with such looks of grateful
affection that Lady Avondale turned to

67
Mrs. Seymour, when she marked the
haughty frowns of Lady Margaret, and
the cold repulsive glance with which many
others received her. Yet still she lived
upon the morrow; and, with an an.
guish that destroyed her, watched, vainly
watched, for every returning post. Daily
she walked to that accustomed spot
that dear, that well-known spot, where
often and often she had seen and heard
the man who then would have given his
very existence to please her; and the re-
membrance of his love, of his promises,
in some measure re-assured her.
One evening, as she wandered there,
she met St. Clara, who passed her in
haste, whilst a smile of exulting triumph
lighted her countenance, Lady Avon-
dale sighed, and seated herself upon the
fragment of a rock; but took no other
notice of her. There was a blaze of glorious
light diffused over the calm scene, and
the gloomy battlements of Belfont Priory

yet shone with the departing ray. When
Calantha arose to depart, she turned from
the golden light which illuminated the
west, and gazed in agony upon the spot
where it was her custom to meet her
lover. The vessels passed to and fro upon
the dark blue sea; the sailors cheerfully
followed their nightly work; and the
peasants, returning from the mountains
with their flocks, sung cheerfully as they
approached their homes. Calantha had
no home to return to: no approving
eye to bid her welcome: her heart was
desolate. She met with an aged man,
whose white locks flowed, and whose air
was that of deep distress. He looked
upon her. He asked charity of her as he
passed: he said that he was friendless,
and alone in the world. His name she
asked: he replied, " Camioli."

of the petitioner : grant me the blessing
he has asked for me. I never more cap

He little knows the pang he gave, ,
He calls me good: alas ! that name and
Calantha's are parted for ever.

Thou hast pray'd for the sinner, who never must

CHAPTER VIII.
LADY AvondALE wrote again and
again to Glenarvon. All that a woman
would repress, all that she once feared
to utter, she now ventured to write.
"Glenarvon," she said, " if I have dis-
pleased you, let me at least be told my
fault by you: you who have had power
to lead me to wrong, need not doubt
your influence if you would now but
advise me to return to my duty. Say it
but gently--speak but kindly to me, and
I will obey every wish of your's. But
perhaps that dreaded moment is arrived,
and you are no longer constant and true.
Ah! fear not one reproach from me. I
told you how it must end; and I will
never think the worse of you for being
as all men are. But do not add cruelty

own lips that you are changed. I but
repeat your words, when once my letters
failed to reach you-suspense, you then
said, was torture: and will you now

you even knew not how to endure? Let

may be, will never cease to honour and
to love you.

perhaps-ah! no, I will not believe it.

they the power to engage you to re-

suffer at this moment, you would pity me.

Expose me not to every eye: drive me

agonizing : this sudden, this protracted
silence is too hard to bear. Every one

good opinion of the wise and just, I have
lost for ever ; but do not you abandon
me, or if you must, oh let it be from
your own mouth at least that I read my
doom. Say that you love another---say
it, if indeed it is already so; and I will
learn to bear it. Write it but kindly.

Oh no, I will never learn to hate
or reproach you, however you may think
fit to trample upon me. I will bless
your name with my last breath-call
upon you even from the
grave,
where
you
have sent me--only turn one look, one
last dear look to me."
Such was her letter. At another time
she thus again addressed him:
" Glenarvon, my only hope in life, drive
me not at once to desperation. Alas!
why do I write thus? You are ill perhaps:
or my friends surrounding you, have urged
you to this. In such case, remember my
situation. Say but kindly that my letters
are no longer a solace to you, and I will
of myself cease to write; but do not
hurl me at once from adoration to con.
tempt and hate. Do not throw me off,
and doom me to sudden, to certain per-
dition. Glenarvon, have mercy.
Let
compassion, if love has ceased, impel you
to show me some humanity. I know it
is degrading thus to write. I ought to

be silent, and to feel that if you have the
heart to treat me with harshness, it is
lowering myself still further thus to sue.
But oh! my God, it is no longer time to
think of dignity.--to speak of what is right.
I have fallen to the lowest depth. You,
you are the first to teach me how low,
how miserably I am fallen. I forsook
every thing for you. I would have fol-
lowed you; and you know it. But for
your's and other's sake, I would have
sacrificed all---all to you.
Alas! I have
already done so.
" If you should likewise turn against
me---if you, for whom so much is lost,
should be the first to despise me, how
can I bear up under it. Dread the vio-
lence of my feelings---the agonizing pang,
the despair of a heart so lost, and so be-
trayed. Oh, write but one line to me.
Say that another has engaged you to for-
sake me---that you will love me no more;
but that as a friend you will still feel
some affection, some interest for me.

I am ill, Glenarvon. God knows I do
not affect it, to touch you. Such guilt
as mine, and so much bitter misery !---
how can I bear up under it? Oh pity
the dread, the suspense I endure. You
know not what a woman feels when re-
morse, despair, and the sudden loss of
him she loves, assail her at once.
" I have seen, I have heard of cruelty,
and falsehood: but you, Glenarvon---oh
you who are so young, so beautiful, can
you be inhuman? It breaks my heart to
think so. Why have you not the looks,
as well as the heart of a villain ? Oh
why take such pains, such care, to lull
me into security, to dispel every natural
fear and suspicion, a heart that loves
must harbour, only to plunge me deeper
in agony.--to destroy me with more re-
fined and barbarous cruelty? Jest not
with my sufferings. God knows they
are acute and real. I feel even for my-
self when I consider what I am going to
endure. Oh spare one victim at least,

Days again passed in fruitless expecta.
tion ; nights, in unceasing wakefulness
and grief. At length one morning, a let-
ter was put into Lady Avondale's hands.
It was from Glenarvon. It is impossible
to describe the joy, the transport of that
moment; nor how, pressing it to her lips,
she returned thanks to Heaven for receive
ing, what it was a crime against her Crea-
tor thus to value. She glanced her eye
over the superscription ; but she durst
not open it. She dreaded lest some
cause should be assigned for so long a
silence, which might appear less kind
than what she could easily endure. The
seal was not his seal; and the black wax,
so constantly his custom to use, was ex-
changed for red. The motto upon the
## p. 79 (#789) #############################################
GLENARVON.
79
seal (for lovers attend to all) was not that
which at all times he made use of when
addressing Calantha. It was a seal she
knew too well. A strange foreboding
that he was changed, filled her mind.
She was prepared for the worst, as she
apprehended. At last she broke the
seal; but she was not prepared for the
following words written by his own hand,
and thus addressed to her. Oh! had he
the heart to write them?
Mortanville Priory, November the 9th.
Lady Avondale,
I am no longer your lover; and since
you oblige me to confess it, by this truly
unfeminine persecution,---learn, that I am
attached to another ; whose name it would
of course be dishonourable to mention.
I shall ever remember with gratitude the
many instances I have received of the
predilection you have shewn in my fa-
vour. I shall ever continue your friend,
your ladyship will permit me so to

style myself; and, as a first proof of my
regard, I offer you this advice, correct
your vanity, which is ridiculous; exert
your absurd caprices upon others; and
leave me in peace.
Your most obedient servant,
GLENARVON.
This letter was sealed and directed by
Lady Mandeville; but the hand that
wrote it was Lord Glenarvon's ; and
therefore it had its full effect. Yes; it
went as it was intended, to the very
heart; and the wound thus given, was as
deep as the most cruel enemy could
have desired. The grief of a mother for
the loss of her child has been described,
though the hand of the painter fails ever
in expressing the agonies of that mo.
ment. The sorrows of a mistress when
losing the lover she adores, have been the
theme of every age. Poetry and paint-
ing, have exhausted the expression of
her despair, and painted to the life, that

81
which themselves could conceive--could
feel and understand. Every one can
sympathise with their sufferings; and that
which others commiserate, is felt with
less agony by ourselves. But who can
sympathize with guilt, or who lament
the just reward of crime?
There is a pang, beyond all others---
a grief, which happily for human nature
few have been called upon to encounter.
It is when an erring but not hardened
heart, worked up to excess of pas-
sion, idolized and flattered into security,
madly betraying every sacred trust, re-
ceives all unlooked for, from the hand it
adores, the dreadful punishment which
its crime deserves. And, if there can
be a degree still greater of agony, shew
to the wretch who sinks beneath the
unexpected blow---shew her, in the per-
son of her only remaining friend and
protector, the husband she has betrayed---
the lover of her youth! Oh shew him
unsuspicious, faithful, kind; and do not

judge her, if at such moment, the dream
dispelled, frantic violence impelling her
to acts of desperation and madness, lead
her rash hand to attempt her miserable
life. Where but in death can such out-
cast seek refuge from shame, remorse,
and all the bitterness of despair? Where
but in death it is no coward's
act. The strength of momentary passion
may nerve the arm for so rash a deed ;
but faint hearts will sicken at the
thought.
Calantla durst not---no, she durst not
strike the blow. She seized the sharp
edged knife, and tried its force. It was
not pain she feared. Pain, even to
extremity, she already felt. But one single
blow---one instant, and all to be at an
end. A trembling horror seized upon
her limbs : the life-blood chilled around
her heart. She feared to die. Pain,
even to agony, were better than thus to
brave Omnipotence--- to rush forward un-
called into that state of which no certain

end is known: to snatch destiny into our
own power, and draw upon ourselves,
in one instant of time, terrors and punish-
ments above the boundless apprehension
even of an evil imagination to conceive.
Calantha's eye, convulsed and fixed,
perceived not the objects which sur-
rounded her. Her thoughts, quick a
the delirious dream of fever, varied with
new and dreadful pictures of calamity.
It was the last struggle of nature. The
spirit within her trembled at approaching
dissolution.---The shock was too great
for mortal reason to resist. Glenarvon-...
Glenarvon ! that form.--that look alone
appeared to awaken her recollection, but
all else was confusion and pain.
It was a sceve of horror. May it for
ever be blotted from the remembrance of
the human heart ! It claims no sympa-
thy: it was the dreadful exhibition of a
mind which passion had misled, and
reason bad ceased to guide. Calantha
bowed not before that Being who had

seen fit to punish her in his wrath. She
sought nor vengeance, nor future hope.
All was lost for her; and with Glenarvon,
every desire in life, every aspiring energy
vanished. Overpowered, annibilated,
she called for mercy and release. She
felt that mortal passion domineered over
reason; and, after one desperate struggle
for mastery, bad conquered and destroyed
her.
Her father watched over and spoke to
her. Mrs. Seymour endeavoured to
awaken her to some sense of her situa.
tion :---she spoke to her of her hus-
band. Calantha! when
reason had
ceased to guide thee, she called to sooth,
to warn thee, but thou couldst not hear.
That voice of conscience, that voice of
truth, which in life's happier day thou
had'st rejected, now spoke in vain ; and
thy rash steps hurried on to seek the ter.
mination of thy mad career.

When the very soul is as it were anni-

evil, the outward frame is calm---no
ap-

Calantha, motionless, re-perused Glenar-
von's letter, and spoke with gentleness
to those who addressed her. Oh! did
the aunt that loved her, as she read that
barbarous letter, exhibit equal marks of
fortitude ? No: in tears, in reproaches,
she vented her indignation : but still
Calantha moved not.

Yet when certain death was expected,
or far worse, entire loss of reason, she

There is a recovery from disease which
is worse than death; and it was her des-
tiny to prove it. She loved her own
sorrow too well: she cherished every
sad remembrance : she became morose,
absorbed, and irritated to frenzy, if in-
truded upon. All virtue is blighted in
such a bosom---all principle gone. It
feeds upon its own calamity. Hope no-

by with every varying caprice. Another,
and another still succeed; but to each
thus cast away, the pang has been be-
yond thought, the stain indelible, and
the wound mortal. Glenarvon had offer-
ed his heart to another. He had given
the love-gifts.--the chains and the rings
which he had received from Calantha,
to his new favourite. Her letters he had
shewn; her secrets he had betrayed : to
an enemy's bosom he had betrayed the
struggles of a guilty heart, tortured with
remorse, and yet at that time at least
but too true, and faithful to him.
They were the letters written in con-
fidence which he shewed! They were
the secret thoughts of a soul he had torn
from virtue and duty to follow him,
which he betrayed !
And to whom did he thus expose her
errors ? ---to the near relations of her hus-
band, to the friends, and companions of her
youth; and instead of throwing a veil upon
the weakness he himself had caused, when

doubt, remorse, and terror had driven
her to acts of desperation ; instead of
dropping one tear of pity over a bleeding,
breaking heart, he committed those tes-
timonies of her guilt, and his own trea-
chery, into the hands of incensed and
injured friends. They were human :
they saw but what he would have them
see; they knew but what he wished
them to know : they censured her al-
ready, and rather believed his plausible
and gentle words, than the frantic rhap-
sodies of guilt and passion. They read
the passages but half communicated;
they heard the insidious remarks; they
saw the letters in which themselves were
misrepresented and unkindly named ; nor
knew the arts which had been made use
of to alienate Calantha. They espoused
the cause of Glenarvon, and turned with
anger and contempt against one whom
they now justly despised. Even Sophia,

ment softened  even Sophia had not

On quitting Castle Delaval, Lord Glen-

and brilliant society, he soon forgot
Calantha. Lady Augusta rallied him

to obtain his confidence. Tears and re-

every reason here enumerated
were
insufficient to account for a lover's
inconstancy, it is enough in one word to
say, that Lady Avondale was a sent ;
for Lord Glenarvon was of a disposition
to attend so wholly to those in whose
presence he took delight, that he failed
to reinember those to whom he had once
been attached; so that like the wheels of
a watch, the chain of his affections
might be said to unwind from the absent,
in proportion as they twined themselves
around the favourite of the moment; and
being extreme in all things, he could
not sufficiently devote himself to the one,
without taking from the other all that he
had given.
It were vain to detail the petty in-
stances of barbarity he employed. The
web was fine enough, and wove with a
skilful hand. He even consulted with
Lady Mandeville in what manner to
make his inhuman triumph more poig-
nant-more galling; and when he heard

that Calantha was irritated even unto
madness, and grieved almost unto death,
he only mocked at her folly, and despised
her still remaining attachment to himself.

swer to his insulting enquiry, soon after
her arrival at Mortanville Priory. "She
is even dangerously ill."

with a smile of scorn. os Of one, Lord
Glenarvon," she answered with equal
irony,
" which will never endanger your
health-of a broken heart." He laugh-
ed. "Of deep remorse," she continued.
" And no regret?" said he, looking
archly at her. " Do not jest," she re-
torted : " the misery which an unhal-
lowed attachment must in itself inflict,
is sufficient, I should think, without
adding derision to every other feeling."
" Does Miss Seymour speak from expe-
rience or conjecture ?"
Before Miss Seymour could answer,
Lady Mandeville, who was present,

whispered something to Glenarvon ; and
he laughed. Sophia asked eagerly what
she was saying. "It is a secret," said
Glenarvon, significantly. " How happy
must Lady Mandeville be at this mo-
ment!" said Lady Augusta, " for every
one knows that the greatest enjoyment
the human mind can feel, is when we
are in the act of betraying a secret con-
fided to us by a friend, or informing an
enemy of something upon which the life
and safety of another depends." "Come,"
said Lady Mandeville, "you are very
severe; but I was only urging Lord
Glenarvon to listen to Miss Seymour's
admonitions in a less public circle.
Miss Monmouth may be displeased if
she hears of all this whispering." So
saying, she took Glenarvon's arm, and
they walked out of the room together.
" After all, he is a glorious creature,"
said Lady Trelawney. "I wish I had a
glorious creature to walk with me this
morning," said Lady Augusta with a

sneer : " but how can I hope for support,
when Calantha, who had once thousands
to defend her, and whom I left the gayest
where all were gay, is now dying alone,
upbraided, despised, and deserted. Where
are her friends ?" 5. She fell by her
own fault entirely," said Lord Tre-
lawney.
- Her life has been one course
of absurdity. A crime here and there
is nothing, I well know," said Lady
Augusta ; " but imprudence and folly,
who can pardon?" 66 She has a kind
heart," said Frances.
" Kind enough
to some," said her lord; " but talk not
of her, for I feel indignant at her very
name.' " There is nothing excites our
indignation so strongly," said Lady
Augusta,
" as misfortune. Whilst our
friends are healthy, rich, happy, and,
above all, well dressed and gaily attend-
ed, they are delightful, adorable. After
all, your sensible judicious people on
the long run are the best : they keep a
good eye to their own interest; and

these flighty ones are sure to get into
scrapes. When they do, we flatterers
have an awkward part to play: we
must either turn short about, as is the
case now, or stand up in a bad cause,
for which none of us have heart or
spirit." " There is no excuse for Ca-
lantha," said Miss Seymour. " God
forbid I should look for one," said Lady
Augusta. "I am like a deer, and ever
fly with the herd: there is no excuse,
Miss Seymour, ever, for those who are
wounded and bleeding and trodden
upon.
I could tell you - but here
come these glorious creatures! Are you
aware, that when Lady Avondale sent
a few days since for her lover's portrait,
and a lock of his hair, one of these
glorious creatures, Lady Mandeville,
yesterday in an envelope enclosed a
braid of her own. C'est piquant cela :
j'admire!" " How illnatured the world
is !" said Miss Monmouth, who had
heard the la ter part of this discourse
## p. 97 (#807) #############################################

" Not illnatured or wicked, my dear,'
said Lady Augusta ; " only weak, cow.
ardly, and inordinately stupid." " With
what self-satisfaction every one tri.
umphs, at the fall of those whose ta-
lents or situation raise them a little
into observation!" said Miss Monmouth.
" Common sense is so pleased," said
Lady Augusta, " when it sees of how
little use any other sense is in this life,
that one must forgive its triumph; and
its old saws and wholesome truisms come
out with such an increase of length and
weight, when the enemy to its peace has
tumbled down before it, that it were
vain to'attempt a defence of the culprit
condemned. I know the world too well
to break through any of the lesser rules
and customs imposed, but you, my dear,
know nothing yet ; therefore I cannot
talk to you."
Miss Monmouth was the only child
of the Honourable Mr. Monmouth, a near
relation of Lady Mowbrey's. Her youth,

her innocence, a certain charm of man-
ner and of person, rare and pleasing, had
already apparently made some impres-
sion upon Glenarvon. He had secretly
paid her every most marked attention.
He had even made her repeatedly the
most honourable offers. At first, trem-
bling and suspicious, she repulsed the
man of whom rumour had spoken much,
which her firm principles and noble ge-
nerous heart disapproved; but soon at-
tracted and subdued by the same all
splendid talents, she heard him with
more favourable inclinations. She was,
herself, rich in the possession of every
virtue and grace: but, alas ! too soon
she was over-reached by the same fasci-
nation and disguise which bad imposed
upon every other.
Amongst the many suitors who at this
time appeared to claim Miss Monmouth's
hand, Buchanan was the most distin-
guished. Lady Margaret eagerly desired
this marriage. She put every engine to

work in a moment to defeat Glenarvon's
views, and secure the prize for her son.
She even left Ireland upon hearing of his
increasing influence, and joined for a
few weeks the party at Mortanville Prie
ory. The parents of Miss Monmouth
were as eager for Buchanan, as the young
lady herself was averse.
Glenarvon saw
with bitterness the success his rival had
obtained, and hated the friends and parents
of Miss Monmouth for their mistrust of
him. By day, by night, he assailed an
innocent heart, not with gross flatter,
not with vain professions. He had a
mask for every distinct character he wish.
ed to play; and in each character he
acted to the very life.
In this instance he threw himself upon
the generous mercy of one who already
was but too well inclined to favour him.
He candidly acknowledged his errors ;
but he cast a veil over their magnitude ;
and confessed only what he wished should
be known. Miss Monmouth, he said,

should reform him ; her gentle voice
should recall his heart from perversion ;
her virtues should win upon a mind,
which, the errors of youth, the world
and opportunity had misled.
Miss Monmouth was the idol of her
family. She was pure herself, and there-
fore unsuspicious. Talents and judg-
ment had been given her with no sparing
hand; but to these, she added the warm-
est, the most generous heart, the strong-
est feelings, and a high and noble cha-
racter. To save, to reclaim one, whose
genius she admired, whose beauty at.
tracted, was a task too delightful to be
rejected. Thousands daily sacrifice their
hearts to mercenary and ambitious views;
thousands coldly, without one feeling of
enthusiasm or love, sell themselves for a
splendid pame; and can there be a mind
so cold, so corrupted, as to censure the
girl, wlio, having rejected a Buchanan,
gave
her hand and heart, and all that she
possessed, to save, to bless, and to re-
claim a Gienarvon,

HAPPILY for Miss Monmouth, at the
very moment her consent was given,
Lady Margaret placed a letter in Glen-
arvon's hands, whieh threw him into
the deepest agitation, and obliged him
instantly, and for a short time, to hasten
to England. He went thither in company
with Lady Margaret; and strange as it
may appear, the love, the idolatry, he
had professed for so many, seemed now
with greater vehemence than for others
transferred to herself. Whether from ar-
tifice or caprice, it is unnecessary to say,
but Lady Margaret at least made shew
of a return. She never lost sight of him
for one moment, She read with him;
she talked with him; she chided him

with all the wit and grace of which she
was mistress; and he, as if maddening
in her presence, gazed on her with wild
delight; and seemed inclined to abandon
every thing for her sake.
Lady Margaret applied to her nume-
rous friends for the ship which had long
been promised to Lord Glenarvon, as a
reward for his former services. She wrote
to Sir George Buchanan in favour of his
appointment; she spoke with eloquence
of his misfortunes; and whether from
her representations, or some other cause,
his cities and estates were at length re-
stored to him. Thanking her for the zeal
she had shewn, he proposed to return
with her immediately to Italy.
She now hesitated. Her brother had
written to her: these were the words
of his letter: 6 Buchanan is desirous
that his marriage should be celebrated in
this place. Miss Monmouth, I fear, has
been compelled to accept his hand; and

I should pity her, if such force did not
save her from a far worse fate. I mean a
marriage with Glenarvon."
Glenaryon was by Lady Margaret's side
when this letter was received. He held
one of Lady Margaret's white hands in
his: he was looking upon the rings she
wore, and laughingly asking her if they
were the gifts of Dartford. "Look at me,
my beautiful mistress," he said, with the
triumph of one secure. She carelessly
placed the letter before his eyes. " Cor-
rect your vanity," she said, whilst le
was perusing it, alluding to the words
he had written to Calantha; " exert your
caprices upon others more willing to bear
them; and leave me in peace."
Stung to the soul, Gleparvon started;
and gazed on her with malignant rage:
then grinding his teeth with all the hor-
ror of supprest rage, I am not a fly to
be trodden upon, but a viper that shall
sting thee to the heart. Farewell for
ever," he cried, rushing from her. Then

returning one moment with calmness,
and smiling on her, " you have not
grieved me," he said gently: " I am not
angry, my fair mistress,
We shall meet
again: fear not we shall meet again."
" Now I am lost," said Lady Margaret,
when he was gone.
"I know by that
smile that my fate is sealed."
There is nothing so uncongenial to
the sorrowing heart as gaiety and mirth;
yet Calantha was at this time condemned
to witness it. No sickness, no sufferings
of its owners, prevented extraordinary
festivities at the castle. Upon the even-
ing of the celebration of Buchanan's mar-
riage, there were revels and merry-making
as in happier times; and the peasantry
and tenants, forgetful of their cabals and
wrongs, all appeared to partake in the
general festivity. The ribband of green
was concealed beneath large bouquets of
flowers; and healths and toasts went
round with tumults of applause, regard.

who pledged them, or of their superiors.
The lawn was covered with dancers. It
was a cheerful scene; and even Calantha
smiled, as she leant upon her father's
arm, and gazed upon the joyful coun-
tenances which surrounded her; but it
was the smile of one whose heart was,
breaking; and every tenant as he passed
by and greeted her looked upon the fa-
ther and the child, and sighed at the
change which had taken place in the ap-
pearance of both.
Suddenly, amidst the dancers, with a
light foot, as if springing from the earth,
there appeared, lovely in beauty and in
youth, the fairest flower of Belfont. It
was Miss St. Clare. No longer envel,
loped in her dark flowing mantle, she
danced amidst the village maidens, the
gayest there. She danced with all the
skill of art, and all the grace of nature.
Her dress was simple and light as the
web of the gossamer : her ringlets, shining
in the bright sun-beams, sported with the

wind: red was her cheek as the first
blush of love, or the rose of summer,
when it opens to the sun.
Upon the lake the boats, adorned with
many coloured ribbands, sailed with the
breeze. Bands of music played beneath
the tents which were erected for refresh-
ments. The evening was bright and
cloudless. Elinor was the first and latest
in the dance--the life and spirit of the
joyous scene. Some shrunk back it
is true at first, when they beheld her;
but when they saw her smile, and that
look of winning candour, which even
innocence at times forgets to wear, that
playful, youthful manner, re-assured them.
* Can it be possible!" said Calantha,
when the music ceased, and the villagers
dispersed" can you indeed affect this
gaiety, or do you feel it, St. Clare ?"
" I feel it," cried the girl, laughing
archly. " The shafts of love shall never
pierce me; and sorrows, though they fall
thicker than the rain of Heaven, shall

never break my heart." - Oh! teach
me to endure afflictions thus. Is it re-
ligion that supports you ?" " Religion !"
St. Clare sighed.
" Yon bright heaven," she said, up-
lifting her eyes, "is not for me. The
time has been, when, like you, I could
have wept, and bowed beneath the
chastening rod of adversity ; but it is
past. Turn you, and repent, lady; for
you are but young in sin, and the heart
alone has wandered. Turn to that God
of mercy, and he will yet receive and
reclaim you." A tear started into her
eyes, as she spoke. " I must journey
op: for the time allowed me is short.
Death walks among us even now.

behind. It was the voice of the Bard
Camioli: " unhappy St. Clare!" he said.
She turned; but he was gone. Every
one now surrounded Miss St. Clare, re-
questing her to sing. " Oh, I cannot
sing," she replied, with tears, appealing
to Calantha; then added lower" my
soul is in torture. That was a father's
voice, risen from the grave to chide me."
Calantha took her hand with tender-
ness; but Miss St. Clare shrunk from her.

thinkest sweet has lost its savour.

shine and smiles of fortune. May soft
breezes waft thy gilded bark upon a
smooth sea, to a guileless, peaceful shore!
May thy footsteps tread upon the green

cheeks and falling tears were her only
answer to this prayer.

CHAPTER XIII.
CAMIOLI had been some time concealed
in Ireland. He now entered his brother
Sir Everard's door. Upon that night he
was seized with illness, before he had
time to explain his intentions. He had
placed a bag of gold in the hands of his
brother; and now, in the paroxysm of his
fever, he called upon his daughter; be
urged those who attended on him to send
for her, that he might once again behold
her. " I am come to die in the land of
my fathers," he said. "I have wandered
on these shores to find if all I heard were
true. Alas! it is true; and I wish once
more to see my unhappy child---before I
die.'
They wrote to Elinor ; they told her
of her father's words. They said: "Oh,

thee to return. Thy father is taken
dangerously ill. I think some of the
wretches around us have administered
poison to him. I know not where to
find thee. He has called thrice for thee;
and now he raves. Oh hasten ; for in
the frantic agony of his soul, he has
cursed thee; and if thou dost not obey
the summons, with the last breath of de-
parting life, he will bequeath thee his ma-
lediction. 0, Elinor, once the pride and
joy of thy father's heart, whom myself
dedicated as a spotless offering before
the throne of Heaven, as being too fair,
too good for such a lowly one as me---
return ere it be too late, and kneel by
the bed of thy dying father. This is thy
house. It is a parent calls, however un-
worthy ; still it is one who loves thee;
and should pride incline thee not to hear
him, 0 how thou wilt regret it when too
late---- Ever, my child, thy affectionate,
but most unhappy uncle,

She received not the summons-.-she
was far distant when the letter was sent
for her to the mountains. She received
it not till noon; and the bard's last hour
was at hand.
Miss Lauriana St. Clare then addressed
her---" If any feeling of mercy yet
warms your stubborn heart, come home
to us and see your father, ere he breathe
his last. 'Tis a fearful sight to see him:
he raves for you, and calls you his darling
and his favourite---his lost lamb, who has
strayed from the flock, but wert dearer
than all the rest. Miss Elinor, I have
little hopes of stirring your compassion;
for in the days of baby hood you were ever
hard and unyielding, taking your own
way, and disdaining the counsel of such
as were older and wiser than you. Go
to, child ;. you have played the wanton
with your fortune, and the hour of shame
is come."
Miss St. Clare heard not the summons

the moors.--it came too late... Camioli
had sickened in the morning, and ere
night, he had died.
They wrote again:" Your father's spirit
has forsaken him: there is no recall from
the grave. With his last words he be .
queathed his curse to the favourite of
his heart; and death has set its seal
upon the legacy. The malediction of a
father rest upon an ungrateful child !"
Elinor stood upon the cliff near Craig
Allen Bay, when her father's corpse was
carried to the grave. She heard the knell
and the melancholy dirge: she saw the
procession as it passed : she stopped its
progress, and was told that her father in
his last hour had left her his malediction.
Many were near her, and flattered her at
the time, but she heard them not.
Elinor stood on the barren cliff, to feel,
as she said, the morning dew and fresh
mountain air on her parched forehead.
My brain beats as if to madden me :---
the fires of hell consume me:---it is a

father's curse," she cried ; and her voice,
in one loud and dreadful shriek, rent the
air. " Oh it is a father's curse!" then
pausing with a fixed and hurried eye:
" Bear it, winds of heaven, and dews of
earth," she cried : " bear it to false
Glenarvon :---hear it, fallen angel, in the
dull night, when the hollow wind shakes
your battlements and your towers, and
shrieks as it passes by, till it affrights
your slumbers :---hear it in the morn,
when the sun breaks through the clouds,
and gilds with its beams of gold the
eastern heavens:---hear it when the
warbling skylark, soaring to the skies,
thrills with its pipe, and every note of
joy sound in thy ear as the cry of woe.
The old man is dead, and gone: he will
be laid low in the sepulchre: his bones
shall be whiter than his grey hairs. He
left his malediction upon his child.

God whom I have worshipped with
sacrilegious incense, hear it and tremble.
Amidst revels and feastings, in the hour
of love, when passion beats in every pulse,
when flatterers kneel, and tell thee thou
art great, when a servile world bowing

sensible to our own errors than when we
smart under apparent injustice. Calan-
tha saw Glenarvon triumphant, and her-
self deserted. The world, it is true, still
befriended her ; but her nearest relations
and friends supported him. Taunted
with her errors, betrayed, scorned, and
trampled upon, the high spirit of her
character arose in proportion as every
hope was cut off. She became violeut,

Mandeville, and Lord Glenarvon, were
eager to evince.
But, even at this hour, Calantha had
reason to acknowledge the kindness and
generosity of some; and the poor remem-
bered her in their prayers. Those whom
she had once protected, flew forward to
support her; and even strangers addressed
her with looks, if not words, of consola-
tion. It was not the
gay,
the professing,
the vain, that shewed compassion in a
moment of need---it was not the impru-
dent and vicious whom Calantha had
stood firm by and defended: these were
the first to desert her. But it was the

came to her, and even courted an ac-

quaintance they once had shunned; for
their hope was now to reclaim.
Humbled, not yet sufficiently, but
miserable, her fair name blasted, the jest
of fools, the theme of triumphant malice,
Calantha still gave vent to every furious
passion, and openly rebelled against those
who liad abandoned her. She refused to
see any one, to hear any admonitions,
and, sickening at every contradiction
to her authority, insisted upon doing
things the most illjudged and unreason.
able, to shew her power, or her indigna-
tion. Struck with horror at her conduct,
every one now wrote to inform Lord
Avondale of the absolute necessity of his
parting from her. Hints were not only
given, but facts were held up to view,
and a life of folly and error was painted
with every aggravation. Calantha knew
not at this time the eager zeal that some
had shewn to hurl just vengeance upon
a self-devoted victim. She was informed
therefore of Lord Avondale's expected

tion : the scorn, the abhorrence of com-
panions and friends, excited no other sen.
timent in her mind than disgust. Me-
naced by every one, she still forbore to
yield, and boldly imploring, if she were
guilty, to be tried by the laws of her
country---laws, which, if she had trans-
gressed, she revered, and would sub-
mit to, she defied the insolence, and ma-
lice of private interference.
From this state, Calantha was at length
aroused by the return of Lord Avondale.
It has been said, that the severest pang
to one not wholly hardened, is the unsus-
picious confidence of the friend whom
we have betrayed, the look of radiant
health and joy which we never more
must share, lhat eye of unclouded virtue,
that smile of a heart at rest, and, worse
than all perhaps, the soft confiding words

Cruel is such suffering. Such
pang Calantha had already once endured,
when last she had parted from her lord;
and for such meeting sbe was again pre-
pared. She had been ill, and no one had
read the secret of her soul. She had been
lonely, and no one had comforted her in
her hours of solitude: she had once loved
Lord Avondale, but absence and neglect
had entirely changed her. She prepared
therefore for the interview with cold indif.
ference, and her pride disdained to crave
his forgiveness, or to acknowledge itself
undeserving in his presence.
" He is no
longer my husband," she repeated daily
to herself. " My heart and his are at
variance-severed by inclination, though
unhappily for both united by circum-
stances. Let him send me from him :
I am desperate and care not."

her former life, thought only of the nege

doned. She dwelt with pleasure upon
the remembrance of every momentary
act of violence, and thought of his gaiety
and merriment, as of a sure testimony
that he was not injured by her ill con.
duct. " He left me first," she said.
" He loves me not; he is happy; I
alone suffer." And the consolation she
derived from such reflections steeled her
against every kindlier sentiment.
Lord Avondale returned. There was
no look of joy in his countenance-no
radiant heartfelt smile which bounding
spirits and youthful ardour once had
raised. His hollow eye betokened deep
anxiety; bis wasted form, the suffering
he had endured. Oh, can it be said that
the greatest pang to a heart, not yet entire-
ly hardened, is unsuspicious confidence?
Oh, can the momentary selfish pang a

be compared to the unutterable agony of
such a meeting? Conscience itself must
shrink beneath the torture of every
glance. There is the record of crime-
there, in every altered lineament of that
well known face. How pale the withered
cheek-how faint the smile that tries to
make light and conceal the eyil under
which the soul is writhing.
And could Calantha see it, and yet
live? Could she behold him kind, com-
passionating, mournful, and yet sur-
vive it? No-no frenzy of despair, no
racking pains of ill requited love; no,
not all that sentiment and romance can
paint or fancy, were ever equal to that
moment. Before severity, she had not
bowed-before contempt, she had not
shed one tear-against every menace, she
felt hardened; but in the presence of
that pale and altered brow, she sunk at

despair.
They were alone, Lord Avondale,
upon arriving, had sought her in her own
apartment: he had heard of her illness.
The duke had repeatedly implored him
to return; he had at length tardily obey-
ed the summons. After a silence of some
moments : " Have I deserved this?" he
cried. Oh, Calantha, have I indeed
deserved it?" She made no answer to
this appeal.
- There was a time," he
said, when I knew how to address
you--when the few cares and vexations,
that ever intruded themselves, were light-
ened by your presence; and forgotten in

most consulted; your opinions and in-
clinations were the rule of all
my
actions.
But I wish not to grieve you by remind-
ing you of a state of mutual confidence
and happiness which we never more can
enjoy.
" If you have a heart," he continued,
looking at her mournfully, " it must al-
ready be deeply wounded by the remem-
brance of your behaviour to me, and can
need no reproaches. The greatest to a
feeling mind is the knowledge that it has
acted unworthily; that it has abused
the confidence reposed in it, and blasted
the hopes of one, who relied solely upon
its affection. You have betrayed me.

The stern brow gave way before these
words; and the paleness of death over-
spread her forn. Scarce could she sup-
port herself. He continued : " What-
ever it may cost me, and much no doubt
I shall suffer, I can be firm. No impor-

As he uttered these words, the frenzy
of passion for one moment shook his
frame. Calantha in terror snatched his
hand. "Oh, hear me, hear me, and
be merciful!" she cried, throwing her-
self before his feet." For God's sake
hear me.". " The injury was great," he
cried : "the villain was masked; but the
remembrance of it is deep and eternal."
He struggled to extricate his hand
from her grasp: it was cold and trem-
bling----" Calm yourself," he at length
said, recovering his composure:

" And is there no hope, Avondale ?"
" None for me," he replied mournfully:

" Grant that I yield,

that you make use of an attachment

Her shrieks, her tears, now
powered every other feeling. "Then it

fiercely, breaking from her. "I wish
not to speak with severity ; but beware,

CHAPTER XV.
The convulsive sobs of real agony, the
eloquence which despair and affection
create in all, the pleadings of his own
kind and generous heart were vain. He
raised her senseless from the earth; he
placed her upon a couch ; and without
daring to look upon her, as he extricated
his hand from the strony grasp of terror,
he fled from her apartment.
Mrs. Seymour had waited to see him ;
and, when he had quitted her niece's
room, she arrested him as he would have
hastened by her, at the head of the stairs.
Her ill state of health, and deep anxiety,
had enfeebled her too much to endure
the shock of hearing his irrevocable in-
tention. He knew this, and wished to
break it to her gently. She pressed his

hand; she looked upon his counte-
nance. All a mother's heart spoke in
those looks. Was there a hope yet left
for her unhappy niece? "Oh, if there
yet be hope, speak, Lord Avondale ;
spare the feelings of one who never in-
jured you : look in that face and have
mercy, for in it there is all the bitterness
of despair." He sought for expressions
that might soften the pang--- he wished to
give her hope ; but too much agitated
himself to know what he then said: "[
am resolved---I am going immediately,"
he said, and passed her by in haste. He
saw not the effect of his words-he
heard not the smothered shriek of a
heart-broken parent.
As he rushed forward, he met the
duke, who in one moment marked in
the altered manner of Lord Avondale
the perfect calm-the chilling proud re-
serve he had assumed, that there was no
hope of reconciliation. He offered bim

"I can never ask, or expect you to for-

" Your generous forbearance has been

amongst the heaviest of my calamities,
that I can only greet you on your return
with my sincere condolements. Alas!
I gave you as an inheritage a bitter por-
tion. You are at liberty to resent as a
man, a conduct, which not even a father
can expect, or ask you to forgive."

The shrieks of women from an adjoin-

Lord Avondale flew forward. The vio.
lence of her feelings had been tried too
far. That irrevocable sentence, that as-
sumed sternness, had struck upon a
heart, already breaking. Calantha was
with some difficulty brought to herself.
" Is he gone?" were the first words she
uttered. 66 Oh! let him not leave me
yet."
Sir Richard, having waited at Belfont
till his patience was wholly exhausted,
had entered the castle, and seeing how
matters were likely to terminate, urged
his nephew with extreme severity to be
firm.
"This is all art," he said: "be
not moved by it." Lord Avondale
waited to hear that Calantha was better,
then entered the carriage, and drove off,
"I will stay awhile," said Sir Richard,
" and see how she is; but if you wait
for me at Kelly Cross, I will overtake
you there. Be firm : this is all subter-
fuge, and what might have been ex-
pected."

" Have mercy," still repeated Lady
Avondale; but it was but faintly. "I'll
never have mercy for one like you, ser-
pent, who, having been fondled in his
bosom, bit him to the heart. Are you
not ashamed to look at me?" Calantha's
tears had flowed in the presence of her
husband; but now they ceased. Sir
Richard softened in his manner.
66 Our
chances in life are as in a lottery," he
said; "and if one who draws the highest
prize of all, throws it away in very wan-
tonness, and then sits down to mourn
for it, who will be so great a hypocrite,
or so base a flatterer, as to affect com-
passion? You had no pity for him: you
ought not to be forgiven."
" Can you answer it to yourself to
refuse me one interview? Can you have
the heart to speak with such severity to
one already fallen?" "Madam, why do
you appeal to me? What are you ap-
proaching me for? What can I do?"

but in seeing him myself." "There is
no hope at all, madam," said Sir Richard,

and he acts as he ought. Lady Avon-

CHAPTER XVI.
SIR RICHARD ordered his carriage at
twelve that evening, and did not even
tell Lady Avondale that he was going
from the castle. Calantha, fatigued with
the exertions of the day, too ill and too
agitated to leave her room, threw herself
upon the bed near her little son. Mac
Allain and the nurse spoke with her;
promised to perform her last injunctions;
then left her to herself.
The soft breathing of Harry Mowbrey,
who slept undisturbed beside her, soothed
and composed her mind. Her thoughts
now travelled back with rapidity over
the varied scenes of her early and hapa
pier days: her life appeared before her
like a momentary trance--like a dream
that leaves a feverish and indistinct alarm

GLENARVON.
139
upon the mind. The span of existence
recurred in memory to her view, and
with it all its hopes, its illusions, and
its fears. She started with abhorrence at
every remembrance of her former con-
duct, her infidelity and neglect of the
best and kindest of husbands..- her dis-
obedience to an honoured parent's com.
mands, and tears of agonizing remorse
streamed from her eyes.
In that name of husband the full hor-
ror of her guilt appeared. Every event
had conspired together to blast his rising
fortunes, and his dawning fame. His
generous forbearance to herself, was, in
fact, a sacrifice of every worldly hope ;
for, of all sentiments, severe and just
resentment from one deeply injured, is
that which excites the strongest sym-
pathy; while a contrary mode of con-
duct, however founded upon the highest
and best qualities of a noble mind, is
rarely appreciated. The cry of justice is
alone supported; and the husband who

spares and protects an erring wife, sa.
crifices his future hopes of fame and ex-
alted reputation at the shrine of mercy
and of love. She suddenly started with
alarm. 66 What then will become of
me?" she cried. 66 The measure of my
iniquity is at its full."
Calautha's tears fell upon her sleeping
boy. He awoke, and he beheld his
mother; but he could not discern the
agitation of her mind. He looked on
her, therefore, with that radiant look of
happiness which brightens the smile of
childhood; nor knew, as he snatched one
kiss in haste, that it was the last, the last
kiss from a mother, which ever through
life should bless him with its pressure.
It was now near the hour of twelve ;
and Mrs. Seymour cautiously approached
Calantha's bed. " Is it time?"
66 Not
" Is Sir Richard gone?"
6 No; he is still in his own apartmenl.
I have written a few lines," said Mrs.
Seymour tenderly; " but if you fail,

what hope is there that any thing I can
say will avail ?"
" Had my mother
lived," said Calantha, 6 she had acted
as you have done. You look so like her
at this moment, that it breaks my heart.
Thank God, she does not live, to see
her child's disgrace." As she spoke,
Calantha burst into tears, and threw her
arms around her aunt's neck.
" Calm yourself, my child."
Hear
me," said Lady Avondale. " Perhaps
I shall never more see you. I have
drawn down such misery upon myself,
that I cannot bear up under it. If I
should die,- and there is a degree of
grief that kills--take care of my

is it I have sought for? Not real hap-

worse. " Calantha," said Mrs. Sey-
mour, as she wept over her niece,
her niece, " there

The heart is sometimes tried by pros-

difficult of all trials to resist. Who then
shall dare to say, that there was not one
single pretext, or excuse, for thy ill
conduct ? No wish, no desire of thine
was ever ungratified. This in itself is
some palliation. Speak, Calantha : fear
not; for who shall plead for thee, if thou
thyself art silent?"
" From the deep recesses of a guilty,
yet not humble heart, in the agony and
the hopelessness of despair," said Ca-
lantha, " I acknowledge before God and
before man, that for me there is no ex-

blessings upon all, and maketh his rain
to fall upon the sinner, as upon the
righteous, extend his mercy even unto
me."
"Can I do any thing for you, my child?"
said Mrs. Seymour. Speak for me to
Sophia and Frances," said Calantha," and
say one word for me to the good and the
kind; for indeed I have ever found the
really virtuous most kind. As to the
rest, if any of those with whom I passed
my happier days remember me, tell
them, that even in this last sad hour I
think with affection of them; and say,
that when I look back even now with
melancholy pleasure upon a career, which,
though short, was gay and brilliant-
upon happiness, which though too soon
misused and thrown away, was real and
great, it is the remembrance of my friends,
and companionsit is the thought of
their affection and kindness, which adds
to and imbitters every regret--for that
kindness was lavished in vain. Tell them

I do not hope that my example can
amend them : they will not turn from
one wrong pursuit for me; they will not

Mrs. Seymour wept, and promised to
perform Calantha's wishes. She was still
with her, when Mac Allain knocked at
the door, and whispered, that all was in
readiness, Explain every thing to my

her aunt; " and now farewell."

65 Sure what a stormy night it is ! Lord
help us, Mr. Mac Allain," said the
nurse, as she wrapped her thick cloth
mantle over the sweet slumberer that
fondled in her bosom, and got into a
post-chaise and four with much trepida-
tion and difficulty. 66 I never saw the
like! there's wind enough to blow us
into the sea, and sea enough to deluge
the land. The Holy Virgin, and all the
saints protect us!" Gerald Mac Allain
having with some trouble secured the re-
luctant and loquacious matron, now re-
turned for another and a dearer charge,
who, trembling and penitent, followed him
to the carriage. " Farewell, my kind pre-
server," said Calantha, her voice scarcely
audible.  God bless, God protect you,

grief.

dear lady," again reiterated the
old man, as the carriage drove swiftly from
the gates.
But the blessing of God was not with
Lady Avondale; she had renounced his
favour and protection in the hour of
prosperity; and she durst not even im-
plore his mercy or his pardon in her
present affliction. Thoughts of bitter-
ness crowded together : she could no
longer weep-the pressure upon her
heart and brain would not permit it,
" Eb! dear heart, how the carriage

awoke her to a remembrance of her
situation. " We are ascending the moun-

The carriage proceeded over the rocky
path, for it could scarce be termed a
road; the wind whistled in at the win-
dows; and the snow drifting, covered
every object. " There it comes again,"
said the affrighted nurse." What comes?")

cried a voice from behind.

their whips; the carriage wheels scarce

their exertions. They arrive: Baron's

" You had better give my lady your
best accommodations," said the nurse
in confidence to the landlord : " she is a
near connexion of the Duke of Alta-
monte's. You may repent any neglect
you may shew to a traveller of such high
rank." - There's nae rank will make
room," retorted the landlord.
- Were
she the late duchess herself, I could only
give her my bed, and go without one.
But indeed couldn't a trifle prevail with
the baists as brought you, to step over
the mountains as far as Killy Cross ?"
" There's nae trifle," said a man, much
wrapped up, who had been watching

at the meaning of this threat, which she
did not understand; but the nurse informe,

Mowbrey's.

CHAPTER XVIII,
The letters from her father, Lady Avon-
dale refused to read. Many remon-
strances passed between herself and
the duke's servant. The result was a
slow journey in the dark night, over a
part of the country which was said to be
infested by the marauders. No terror
alarmed Lady Avondale, save that of
losing a last, an only opportunity of once
more seeing her husband---of throwing
his mercy---of imploring
him to return to his family, even though
she were exiled from it. " Yet, I will not
kneel to him, or ask it. If when he sees
me, he has the heart to refuse me," she
cried, " I will only shew him my child;
and if he can look upon it, and kill its
mother, let him do it. I think in that

case---yes, I do feel certain that I can en-
counter death, without a fear, or a mur-
mur."
The carriage was at this time turning
down a steep descent, when some horse-
men gallopping past, bade them make
way for Sir Richard Mowbrey. Calan-
tha recognized the voice of the servant :
it was the same who had occasioned her
so much alarm at the inn near Baron
Moor. But the nurse exclaimed in ter-
ror that it was one of the rebels: she
knew him, she said, by his white uni-
form: and the presence alone of the ad-
miral, in the duke's carriage, convinced
her of her mistake. " Thanks be to
heaven," she cried, the moment she be-
held him, "it is in ra'al earnest the old
gentleman." " Thanks be to heaven,"
said Calantha, 6 he either did not re.
cognize me, or cares not to prevent my
journey." " We'll, if it isn't himself,"
said the nurse, " and the saints above
only know why he rides for pleasure,

this dismal night, over these murderous
mountains; but at all events he is well,
guarded. Alack! we are friendless.".
Lady Avondale sighed as the nurse in
a tremulous voice ejaculated these ob-
servations; for the truth of the last re..
mark gave it much weight. But little-
did she know at that moment, when the
admiral passed, how. entirely her fate:
depended on him.
It was not till morning they arrived at
Kelly Cross. "Bless my heart, how ter-.
rible you-look. What's the matter, sweet:

ed from the carriage.-" Look up, dear..

on me, even as it came straight upon
my mother. Oh Heavens !"..." Where
is the pain ?" " It came like ice upon
my heart, and my limbs feel chilled and
numbed.--- Avondale-.- Avondale."
Calantha was carried to a small room,
and laid upon a bed. The waiter said
that Lord Avondale was still at the inn.
The nurse hastened to call him. He
was surprised; but not displeased when
he heard that Lady Avondale was ar,
rived. He rushed towards her apart-
ment. Sir Richard was with him. "By
G---d, Avondale, if you forgive her, I will
never see you more.
Whilst I live, she
shall never dwell in my house."
" Then
mine shall shelter her," said Lord Avon-
dale, breaking from Sir Richard's grasp:
" this is too much ;" and with an air of
kindness, with a manner gentle and af-
fectionate, Lord Ayondale now entered,
and approached his wife. - Calantha,"

he said, " do not thus give way to the
violence of your feelings. I wish not
to appear stern.---My God! what is
the matter?" " Your poor Lady is
dying," said the nurse. " For the love of
mercy, speak one gracious word to her."
"I will, I do," said Lord Avondale,
alarmed. " Calantha," he whispered,
without one reproach,

been your errors, turn here for shelter

the world may scorn me; but I will do

" She faints," cried the nurse: May

That piercing shriek had escaped from
a broken heart. It was the last chord of
ature, stretched to the utmost till it
broke. A cold chill spread itself over
her limbs. In the struggle of death, she
had thrown her arms around her huse

band's neck; and when her tongue
cleaved to her mouth, and her lips were
cold and powerless, her eyes yet bright
with departing life had fixed themselves
earnestly upon him, as if imploring para
don for the past.
Oh, resist not that look, Avondale !
it is the last. Forgive her-pity her:
and if they call it weakness in thee thus:
to weep, tell them that man is weak,
and death dissolves the keenest enmities.
Oh! tell them, that there is something
in a last look from those wliom we have
once loved, to which the human soul
can never be insensible. But when that
look is such as was Calantha's, and when
the last prayer her dying lips expressed
was for mercy, who shall dare to refuse
and to resist it? It might have rent a
harder bosom than thine. It may ascend
and plead before the throne of Heaven..
It was the prayer of a dying penitent:---
it was the agonizing look, of a breaking
heart.

reproached by the cold and stern, for his
mercy to herself---to trace in his coun-
tenance the bitterness of a proud but

sufferings and its wrongs, perishing, by
slow degrees, of the cruelest of all ma-

honour, and blasted happiness ? Oh did

CHAPTER XIX.
SiR RICHARD wished to say one word
to console Lord Avondale; but he could
not. He burst into tears; and knelt
down by the side of Calantha. "I am
an old man," he said.
6 You thought
me severe; but I would have died, child,
to save you. Look up, and get well.
I can't bear to see this:--no, I can't
bear it." He now reproached himself.
" I have acted rightly perhaps, and as
she deserved ; but what of that: if God
were to act by us all as we deserve,
where should we be? Look up, child...
open your eyes again---l'd give all I
have on earth to see you smile once on
me---to feel even that little hand press
mine in token of forgiveness." "Uncle,"

every one, although they might have in-

miral. " I can't believe she's dead."
Sir Richard's sorrow, whether just or
otherwise, came too late. Those who
act with rigid justice here below---those
who take upon themselves to punish the
sinner whom God for inscrutable pur-
poses one moment spares, should some-
times consider that the object against
whom their resentment is excited will
soon be no more. Short-lived is the en-
joyment even of successful guilt. An
hour's triumph has perhaps been pur-
chased by misery so keen, that were we
to know all, we should only commi.
serate the wretch we now seek to subdue
and to punish. The name of christians
we have assumed; the doctrine of our
religion, we have failed to study. How

by oppressing and driving to ruin unut-
terable, what we call successful villainy,
the next hour brings us the news that
the object of our indignation is dead.---
That soul is gone, however polluted,
to answer before another throne for its
offences. Ah! who can say that our
very severity to such offender may not
turn back upon ourselves, and be re-
gistered in the Heaven we look forward
to with such presumption, to exclude us
for ever from it.
Sir Richard gazed sadly now upon
his nephew. "Don't make yourself ill,
Henry," he said. " Bear up under this
shock. If it makes you ill, it will be my
death." "I know you are too generous,
said Lord Avondale, "not to feel for me."
" I can't stay any longer here," said Sir
Richard, weeping. " You look at me in
a manner to break my heart. I will
return to the castle; tell them all that
has happened; and then bring the chil-
dren to you at Allen water. I will go

and fetch Henry to you." "I can't see

said Lord Avondale mournfully, " go to

she lived; but she never would appear
penitent and humble. I thought her
wanting in feeling. She braved every
one ; and did so many things that ..."
66 She is dead," said Lord Avondale,
greatly agitated. " Oh, by the affection
you profess for me, spare her memory."
" You loved her then even"
loved her better than any thing in life."
Sir Richard wept bitterly.
My dear
boy, take care of yourself," he said.
" Let me hear from you." "You shall
hear of me," said Lord Avondale. The
admiral then took his leave; and Lord
Avondale returned into Calantha's apart-
ment. The nurse followed. Affected
at seeing his little girl, he pressed her to
his heart, and desired she might immedi-
ately be sent to Allenwater.
Then
ordering every one from the room, he
turned to look for the last time upon
Calantha. There was not the faintest
tint of colour on her pale transparent

167
cheek. The dark lashes of her eye shaded
its soft blue lustre from his mournful gaze.
There was a silence around. It was the
calm-the stillness of the grave.
Lord Avondale pressed her lips to
his. " God bless, and pardon thee,
Calantha," he cried.
66 Now even I
can look upon thee and weep. O, how
could'st thou betray me!  It is not an
open enemy that hath done me this dis-
honour, for then I could have borne it:
neither was it mine adversary that did
magnify himself against me; for then
peradventure I would have hid myself
* from him: but it was even thou, my
companion, my guide, and mine own
i familiar friend.' We took sweet
counsel together..--farewell! It was my-
self who caused thy ruin. I loved thee
more than man should love so frail a
being. I could not bear to grieve thee;
I could not bear to curb thee; and
thou hast lost me and thyself. Fare-
well. Thy death has left me free to

act. My vengeance till this hour, for
thy sake, was sheathed. Thou had'st a
strange power over my heart ; and, oh,
Calantha, how thou did'st misuse it !"
As he uttered these words, while yet
in presence of the lifeless form of his
departed, his guilty wife, he prepared
to leave the mournful scene. 66 Send
the children to Allenwater, if
you
have
mercy." These were the last words he
addressed to the nurse as he hurried from
her presence.
O man, how weak and impotent is
thy nature ! Thou can'st hate, and love,
and kiss the lips of thy enemy, and strike
thy dagger into the bosom of a friend.
Thou can'st command thousands, and
govern empires; but thou can'st not
rule thy stormy passions, nor alter the
destiny that leads thee on. And could
Avondale thus weep for an ungrateful
wife? Let those who live long enough
in this cold world to feel its heartless-
ness, answer such enquiry. How many

daily sacrifice themselves for the wives
of others.How many for a mistress re-
nounce both fame and country! What-
ever she had been, Calantha was still his
friend. Together they had tried the joys
and ills of life; the same interests united
them : and the children, as they turned
to their father, pleaded for the mother
whom they resembled.--Nothing, how-
ever, fair or estimable, can replace the
loss of an early friend. Nothing that
after-life can offer will influence us in
the same degree. It has been said, that
although our feelings are less acute in
maturer age than in youth, yet the young
mind will soonest recover from the blow
that falls heaviest 'upon it. In that
season of our life, we have it in our
power, it is said, in a measure to repair
the losses which we have sustained.
But these are the opinions of the aged,
whose pulse beats low-whose reasoning
powers can pause, and weigh and mea.

The duke was calm ; but Lord Avon-
dale felt with bitterness his injury and
his loss. The sovereign who has set
his seal to the sentence of death passed
upon the traitor who had betrayed bim,
ofttimes in after-life has turned to re-
gret the friend, the companion he has
lost. " She was consigned to me when
pure and better than those who now
upbraid her. I had the guidance of her;
and I left her myself, when temptation
and ruin surrounded her. Can a few
years have thus spoiled and hardened
a noble nature! Where are the friends
and flatterers, Calantha, who surrounded
thee in an happier hour? I was aban- !
doned for them: where are they now?

Lord AvondALE wrote to Glenarvon,
desiring an immediate interview: He
followed him to England ; and it was
some months before he could find where
He sought him in every place
of public resort, amidst the gay troop of
companions who were accustomed to
surround him, and in the haunts of his
most lonely retirement. At length he
heard that he was expected to return to
Ireland, after a short cruize. Lord
Avondale waited the moment of his ar.

and traced him to the very spot, where,
alas! he had so often met his erring
partner.
It was the last evening in June.

after the most approved fashion, then

a light charge, and will not burthen
thee."
" Defend yourself," cried Lord Avon-
dale, fiercely.---St. Clare, at that moment,
rushed forward with a troop of followers ;
and placing herself between the furious
combatants : " Avondale," she cried,
" thou shalt not raise thy hand against
Glenarvon. By this bleeding heart, I
adjure you--oby Calantha's last prayer,

not thy upright honour with this mockery
and exhibition. Who doubts thy prowe

that surrounds the youthful head of
Avondale :---yon miserable victim has
yet to live and to repent. "Oh, hear
me," she continued, throwing herself
forward before him: "reserve that arm

"I sought thee not," said Glenarvon,
fiercely breaking from St. Clare; "but
since it is thy rash desire to strike at one
who defies thee---take this.". - He rushed
forward as he spoke, and struck his
dagger into Lord Avondale's bosom, then
departed. "Let me pursue. Let me

He stopped not for the rugged path-
way; but he paused to look again upon
the stream of Elle, as it came rushing
down the valley; and he paused to cast
one glance of welcome upon Inis Tara,
Glenarvon Bay, and the harbour termi-
nating the wide extended prospect. The
myrtles and arbutes grew luxuriantly
intermixed with larch and firs. The

CHAPTER XXI.
It was at Kelly Cross that Lord Avondale
remained till he was sufficiently recovered
from bis wound to proceed. From Kelly
Cross to Allen water, the road passes
through mountains, which, rough and
craggy, exhibit a terrific grandeur. The
inhabitants in this part of the country are
uncivilized and ferocious. Their appear-
ance strongly betokens oppression, pover-
ty, and neglect.
A herd of goats may
be seen browzing upon the tops of the
broken cliffs ; but no other - cattle, nor
green herbage. A desolate cabin here
and there ; inactivity, silence, and de-
spondency, every where prevail. The
night was sultry, and the tired horse of

he had left, and slowly ascended the
craggy steep. When he had attained
the summit of the mountain, he paused
to rest, exhausted by the burning pain of
his wound.
Lord Avondale then looked back at
the scenes he had left.
. Before his eyes appeared in one ex-
tensive view the bright silver surface
of Glenarvon Bay, breaking through
the dark shades of distant wood, under
the heights of Inis Tara and Heremon,
upon whose lofty summits the light of
the moonbeam fell. To the right, the
Dartland hills arose in majestic grandeur;
and far onwards, stretching to the clouds,
his own native hills, the black moun
tains of Morne ; while the river Allan,
winding its way through limestone rocks
and woody glens, rapidly approached to-
wards the sea.
Whilst yet pausing to gaze upon these
fair prospects, on a night so clear and se-
rene, that every star shone forth to light

him on his way, yells terrible and dis-
orderly broke upon the sacred stillness,
and a party of the rebels rushed
upon
him.
He drew his sword, and called loudly to
them to desist. Collingwood, an attend-
ant who had waited for him at the inn, and
had since accompanied him, exclaimed:
" Will you murder your master, will you
attack your lord, for that he is returning
amongst you
?"..." He wears the English
uniform," cried one. 66 Sure he's one of
the butchers sent to destroy us. We'll
have no masters, no lords: he must
give up his commission, and his titles, or
not expect to pass."---" Never," said
Lord Avondale, indignantly : " had I no
commission, no title to defend, still as a
man, free and independent, I would pro-
tect the laws and rights of my
insulted
country. Attempt not by force to oppose
yourselves to my passage. I will pass
without asking or receiving your permis-
sion."

Long life to you! and glory, and pleasure
attend you."..." Long life to your ho-
nouri" exclaimed one and all; and in a
moment the enthusiasm in his favour
was as great, as general, as had been at first
the execration and violence against him.
The attachment they bore to their lord
was still strong. " Fickle, senseless
beings!" he said, with bitter contempt,
as he heard their loyal cry.
6. These are
the creatures we would take to govern
us: this is the voice of the people: these
are the rights of man."..." Sure but
you'll pity us, and forgive us; and you'll
be our king again, and live amongst us;
and the young master's just gone to the
mansion ; and didn't we draw him into
his own courts ? and ain't we returning
to our cabins after seeing the dear crea-
ture safe : and, for all tue world, didn't

the retreat in which he and Calantha
bad passed the first, and happiest year
of their marriage. The approach to it
was agony. The fever on his mind auy-
mented. The sight of his children, wbom
he had ordered to be conveyed thither,
would be terrible :---he dreaded, yet he
longed to clasp them once more to his
bosom. The people had named but one,
and that was Harry Mowbrey. Was
Anabel also there ? Would she look on
him, and remind him of Calantha? These
were inquiries he hardly durst suggest
to himself.
Lord Avondale hastened on. And
now the road passed winding by the
banks of the rapid and beautiful Allan,
till it led to the glen, where a small villa,
adorned with flower gardens, wood and

UPON that night when the meeting be-

in honour of St. Katharine passed through

having waited during the whole of the
day to see it, rode to St. Mary's church,
and returned by the shores of the sea, at
a late hour. As she passed and repassed
before her uncle's house, she turned her
dark eye upwards, and saw that many
visitors and gusts were there. They
had met together to behold the proces-
sion.
Lauriana and Jessica stood in their
mother's bow window. Tyrone, Carter,
Grey, and Terney, spoke to them con-
cerning their cousin.

another; "the very stones cry shame on

to see you." " Then are there few

St. Clare smiling : " for when I pass, ,

affect superior wisdom." " Better be-

differ from the just and the wise : the

winds, Jessica : they'll bear your mur-
murs far, and my course is ended."
The evening was still : no breeze
felt; and the swelling billows
of the sea were like a smooth sheet of
glass, so quiet, so clear. Lauriana played
upon the harp, and flatterers told her
that she played better than St. Clare.
She struck the chords to a warlike air,
and a voice, sweet as a seraph angel's,
sung from below. "St. Clare, is it you?
Well I know that silver-sounding voice.
The day has been hot, and you
have
ridden far: dismount, and enter here.
An aunt and relations yet live to receive
and shelter thee. What, though all the
world scorn, and censure thee, still this is
thy home. Enter here, and you shall be
at peace.
" Peace and my heart are at
variance. I have ridden far, as you say,
and I am weary : yet I must journey to
the mountains, before I rest. Let me
ride on in haste. My course will soon

arrest you," said Lauriana.
Oh, not
that name: all but that I can bear to
hear."
Cormac O'Leary, Carter, Grey, and
Terney, now came down, and assisted in
persuading her to alight. "Sing to us,'
they cried.
6. What hand can strike the
harp like thine ?
What master taught
thee this heavenly harmony?" "Oh,
had you heard his song who taught me,
then had you wept n pity for my
loss.
What does life present that's worth even
a prayer? What can Heaven offer, hay-
ing taken from me all that my soul
adored? Why name Glenarvon ? It is
like raising a spirit from the grave; or
giving life again to the heart that is dead :
it is as if a ray of the sun's glorious light
shone
upon
these cold senseless rocks; or
as if a garden of paradise were raised in
the midst of a desert : birds of prey and
sea-fowl alone inhabit here. They should

has shed its glory upon the favourite of

said Cormac O'Leary, 66 behaves but
scurvily to man. Glenarvon it seems has
left his followers, as he has his mistress.

his services, he is reinstated in his father's
possessions, a ship is given to him, and

The rich crimson glow faded from
Elinor's cheek. She smiled, but it was
to conceal the bitterness of her heart.
She knew the tale was true; but she
cared not to repeat it. She mounted her
horse, and desiring Cormac O'Leary,
Niel Carter, and others, to meet her that
night at Inis Tara, she rode away, with
more appearance of gaiety than many a
lighter heart.

was intruded upon in so unaccustomed a
manner. 6 I am come," said Elinor,
" to ask a favour at your hands, and if
you deny me, at least add not unneces-

boy, and the hand that now protects it

me : it is not mine.
The boy has no-

pledge of misfortune and crime."
The abbess raised herself to take a
nearer view of the person with whom she
was conversing. The plumed hat and
dark flowing mantle, the emerald clasp
and chain, had little attraction for one
of her age and character ; but the sunny

crime had not entirely banished, all, all
awakened the affection of age : and,
with more of warmth, more of interest

had the barbarous cruelty to impose upon
one so young, so fair ?"
" Alas! good aunt, there is not in the
deep recesses of my inmost heart a re-

made me, must bear witness, that he

" The God of Heaven pardon thee !"
said the abbess. "You were once my
delight and pride. I never could have
suspected ill of you." " I too was once
unsuspicious," said St. Clare. "My heart
believed in nothing but innocence. I
know the world better now. Were it
their interest, would they thus deride
me? When the mistress of Glenarvon,
did they thus neglect, and turn from me?
I was not profligate, abandoned, har-
dened, then! I was lovely, irresistible !
My crime was excused. My open de-
fiance was accounted the mere folly and
wantonness of a child. I have a high
spirit yet, which they shall not break.
I am deserted, it is true; but my mind is
a world in itself, which I have peopled
with my own creatures. Take only
from me a father's curse, and to the last
I will smile, even though my heart is
breaking."

abbess, kindly. Can you ask it,

hundreds, do I not appear the gayest of

Who dances more lightly at the ball ?
And if I cannot sleep upon my bed, need
the world be told of it? The virtuous
suffer, do they not? And what is this
dream of life if it must cease so soon?
We know not what we are: let us doubt
all things -all but the curse of a father,

from me to-night! Give me your bless-

" Can such a mind find delight in
vice?" said the abbess, mildiy gazing
upon the kneeling girl. ." Why do you

greatness, and trembling at its power, if,

delusions of wickedness ?" " Will such

The preparations made this year by
France, in conjunction with the allies,
and the great events which took place in
consequence of her enterprizes, belong
solely to the province of the historian.
It is sufficient to state, that the arma-
ment which had been fitted out on the
part of the Batavian Republic, sailed at
a later period of the same year, under
the command of Admiral de Winter,
with the intention of joining the French
fleet at Brest, and proceeding from thence
to Ireland, where the discontents and
disaffection were daily increasing, and
all seemed ripe for immediate insur-
rection.
Lord Glenarvon was at St. Alvin
Priory, when he was summoned to take

George Buchanan and Adiniral Duncan
at the Texel. Not a moment's time was
to be lost: he had already exceeded ihe
leave of abserice he had obtained. The
charms of a new mistress, the death of
Calantha, the uncertain state of his af-
fairs, and the jealous eye with which he
regarded the measures taken by his uncle
and cousin de Ruthven, had detained him
till the last possible moment; but the
command from Sir George was peremp-
tory, and he was never tardy in obeying
orders which led him from apathy and
idleness to a life of glory.
He prepared, therefore, to depart,
as it seemed, without further delay,
leaving a paper in the hands of one of
his friends, commissioning him to an-
nounce at the next meeting at Inis Tara
the change which had taken place in his
opinions, and entire disapprobation of
the lawless measures which had been re-
cently adopted by the disaffected. He

took his name from out the directory;
and though he preserved a faithful si-
lence respecting others, he acknowledged
his own errors, and abjured the desperate
cause in which he had once so zealously
engaged.
The morning before he quitted Ireland,
he sent for his cousin Charles de Ruth-
ven, to whom he had already consigned
the care of his castles and estates.
I live to return," he said gaily, " I shall
mend my morals, grow marvellous vir-
tuous, marry something better than my-
self, and live in all the innocent pleasures
of connubial felicity. In which case, you
will be what you are now, a keen ex-
pectant of what never can be your's. If
I die, in the natural course of events, all
this will fall to your share. Take it now
then into consideration : sell, buy, make
whatever is for your advantage; but as a
draw-back upon the estate, gentle cousin,

liberally provided for the other, mark
me, Charles !-a strange tale rests upon
that other: keep him carefully: there
are enemies who watch for his life: be-
friend him, and shelter him, and, if re-
duced to extremities, give these papers
to the duke. They will unfold all that I
know; and no danger can accrue to you
from the disclosure. I had cause for
silence."
It was in the month of August, when
Lord Glenarvon prepared to depart from
Belfont. The morning was dark and
misty. A grey circle along the horizon
shewed the range of dark dreary moun-
tains; and far above the clouds one
bright pink streak marked the top of Inis
Tara, already lighted by the sun, which
had not risen sufficiently to cast its rays
upon aught beside this lofty landmark.
Horsemen, and carriages, were seen driv-
ing over the moors; but the silent lone-

liness of Castle Delaval continued un-
disturbed till a later hour.
It was there that Lady Margaret, who
had returned from England, awaited with
anxiety the promised visit of Glenarvon.
Suddenly a servant entered, and informed
her that a stranger, much disguised, waited
to speak with her.--- His name was Vi-
viani.--- He was shewn into Lady Mar-
garet's apartment. A long and animated
conversation passed. One shriek was
heard. The stranger hurried from the
castle. Lady Margaret's attendants found
her cold, pale, and almost insensible.
When she recovered.
" Is he gone?"
she said eagerly.
The stranger is
gone,"
they replied. Lady Margaret
continued deeply agitated; she wrote to
Count Gondimar, who was absent; and
she endeavoured to conceal from Mrs.
Seymour and the duke the dreadful alarm
of her mind. She appeared at the hour
of dinner, and talked even as usual of
the daily news.

"Lord Glenarvon sailed this morning,"
said Mrs. Seymour. "I heard the same,"
said Lady Margaret. Young De Ruth-

Lady Margaret, looking eagerly at her

Glenarvon's affairs. You know, I con-

tering abruptly, and, all in haste, Mr.
Buchanan suddenly stood before his mo-
ther. There was no need of explanation.
In one moment, Lady Margaret read in

the countenance of her son, that the
dreadful menace of Viviani had been ful-
filled; that his absence at this period
was but too effectually explained; that
all was known. Buchanan, that cold
relentless son, who never yet had shewn
or affection, or feeling-whose indiffer-
ence had seldom yielded to any stronger
emotion than that of vanity, now stood
before her, as calm as ever, in outward
show; but the horror of his look, when
he turned it upon her, convinced her
that he had heard the dreadful truth.
Mrs. Seymour and the duke perceiving
that something important had occurred,
retired.
Lady Margaret and her son were, there-
fore, left to themselves. A moment's
pause ensued. Lady Margaret first en-
deavoured to break it: " I bave not seen
you," she said at length, affecting calm-
ness," since a most melancholy scene
I mean the death of Calantha."
" True," he cried, fixing her with

in agitation, " that I am your mother,

agitates, alarms, terrifies me.' " And

he cried, seizing both her hands with
violence" Say, is it true?"

Margaret. "Kneel down there, wretch-

said Buchanan; " and remember that it

Lady Margaret knelt with calm dig.

heaven, prepared to take the terrible
oath Buchanan had required. Pause,
he cried : " I know it is true, and you
shall not perjure yourself for me."

Margaret, eagerly. " Believe your mo-

Buchanan was inexorable. He left
her.---He fled.---She followed, clinging
to him, to the door.-.-She held his hand
to her bosom : she clasped it in agony.
He fled: and she fell senseless before
him. Still he paused not; but rushing
from her presence, sought Viviani, who
had promised to meet him in the forest.

me doubt. If what he has written
is false, this monster, this Viviani, shall

La Crusca, who alone knows, beside
myself and Viviani, this horrid secret, is
under the protection of my cousin de
Ruthven. How far he is acquainted
with the murder I know not; but he
fears me, and he dares not openly oppose
me. Lady Margaret has proved her in-
nocence to him likewise," he continued
smiling bitterly ; "but there is yet one
other witness."..." Who, where?"
"The boy himself."
Perhaps this is
all a plot to ruin my wretched mother,"
said Buchanan. 6 I shall have it
brought to light." " And your mother
publicly exposed ?" "If she is guilty,
let her be brought to shame." " And

" To

They arrived at Belfont, whilst thus.
conversing. The evening was dark.
They had taken a room at the inn.
Glenarvon enquired of some around
him, if Colonel St. Alvin were at the
abbey. He was informed that he was

at Colwood Bay. " Ask them now,"
said Glenarvon in a whisper, " concern-
ing me." Buchanan did so, and heard
that Lord Glenarvon had taken ship for
England that morning, had abandoned
his followers, and received a bribe for
his treachery from the English court.
The people spoke of him with much
execration. Glenarvon smiling at their
warmth: 6 This was your idol yester-
day: to-morrow," he continued,
will give you another." As soon as
Buchanan had retired to his room, as
he said, to repose himself, for he had
not closed his eyes since he had left
England, his companion, wrapping him-
self within his cloak, stole out unper-
ceived from the inn, and walked to St.
Alvin Priory.

CHAPTER XXV.
!
SHORTLY after Buchanan's departure,
Lady Margaret had recovered from her
indisposition. She was tranquil, and
had retired early to rest. The next
morning she was in her brother's apart-
ment, when a servant entered with a
letter. " There is a gentleman below
who wishes to speak with your grace."
" What is his name?" "I know not, my
lord ;
he would not inform me." The duke
opened the letter. It was from Colonel
De Ruthven, who entreated permission
to have a few moments conversation
with the duke, as a secret of the utmost
importance had been communicated to
him that night; but it was of the most
serious consequence that Lady Margaret
Buchanan should be kept in ignorance

215
of the appeal. The name was written in
large characters, as if to place particular
emphasis upon it; and as unfortunately
she was in her brother's apartment at
the moment the letter was delivered,
it was extremely difficult for him to
conceal from her its contents, or the agi-
tation so singular and mysterious a com-
munication had caused him.
Lady Margaret's penetrating eye ob-
served in a moment that something un-
usual had occurred; but whilst yet com-
manding herself, that she might not shew
her suspicions to her brother, Mac Allain
entered, and giving the duke a small
packet, whispered to him that the gen-
tleman could not wait, but begged his
grace would peruse those papers, and he
would call again. Sister," said the
duke, rising, " you will excuse. Good
God! what do I see? What is the matter?"

lips and cheeks:-yet calm in the midst

of the most agonizing suspense, she gave
no other sign of the terror under which
she laboured. Kindly approaching, he
took her hand.
66 That packet of letters is for me,"
she said in a firm low voice.
66 The
superscription bears my name," said the
duke, hesitating.
- Yet if.--if by any
mistake---any negligence-.-"..-" There is
no mistake, my lord," said the servant
advancing " Leave us," cried Lady
Margaret, with a voice that resounded
throughout the apartment; and then
again faltering, and fainting at the effort,
she continued: " Those letters are mine :
---my enemy and your's has betrayed
them :---Viviani may exhibit the weak.
ness and folly of a woman's heart to
gratify his revenge ; but a
generous
brother should disdain to make himself
the instrument of his barbarous, his un-
manly cruelty." " Take them," said
the duke, with gentleness : "I would
not read them for the world's worth.
## p. 217 (#927) ############################################
GLENARVON.
217
That heart is noble and generous, what-
ever its errors; and no letters could ever
make me think ill of
my
sister."
Lady Margaret trembled exceedingly.
" They wish to ruin me," she cried--"to
tear me from your affection--to make
you think me black---to accuse me, not
of weakness, brother, but of crimes."
- Were they to bring such evidences,
that the very eye itself could see their
testimony, I would disbelieve my senses,
before I could mistrust you. Look then
calm and happy, my sister. We have all
of us faults ; the best of us is no miracle
of worth; and the gallantries of one, as
fair, as young, as early exposed to temp-
tation as you were, deserve no such se-
verity. Come, take the detested packet,
and throw it into the flames."..." It is of
no gallantry that I am accused; no weak-
ness, Altamonte; it is of murder!"
The duke started. Aye, brother, of
the murder of an infant." He smiled.
" Smile too, when I say further---of the

val."
" Great God ! have I lived to hear that
wretches exist, barbarous, atrocious
enough, thus to accuse you? Name
them, that my arm may avenge you
-name them, dearest Margaret; and, by
heavens, I will stand your defender, and
at once silence them.' "Oh, more than
this: they have produced an impostor-
a child, brother-an Italian boy, whose
likeness to your family I have often
marked." - Zerbellini?"
The same."
- Poor contrivance to vent their rage
and malice! But did I not ever tell you,
my dearest Margaret, that Gondimar,
and that mysterious Viviani, whom you
protected, bore an ill character. They
were men unknown, without family,
without principle, or honour.' < Bro-

and love me enough to discredit at
once the whole of this: swear to me,
Altamonte, that without proving their
falsehood, you despise the wretches who
have resolved to ruin
your
sister."
The duke now took a solemn oath,
laying his hand upon her's, that he
never could, never would harbour one
thought of such a nature.
smiled at its absurdity; and he refused
to see either the stranger, or to read
the packet--when Lady Margaret, falling
back in a hollow and hysteric laugh,
bade him tear from his heart the fond,
the doating simplicity that beguiled
him:--" They utter that which is true,"
she cried. " I am that which they have
said." She then rushed from the room.
The duke, amazed, uncertain what to
believe or doubt, opened the packet of
letters, and read as follows:-
My gracious and much injured
patron, Lord Glenarvon's departure,

whilst it leaves me again unprotected,
leaves me also at liberty to act as I think
right. Supported by the kindness of
Colonel de Ruthven, I am emboldened
now to ask an immediate audience with
the Duke of Altamonte. Circumstances
preclude my venturing to the castle:--
the enemy of my life is in wait for me...-
The Count Viviani and his agents watch
for me by night and by day. Lady
Margaret Buchanan, with Lord Glenar-
von's assistance, has rescued the young
Marquis of Delaval from his perfidious
hands; but we have been long obliged to
keep him a close prisoner at Belfont
Abbey, in order to preserve him from
his persecutors. My Lord Glenarvon
sajled yesternoon, and commended my-
self and the marquis to the colonel's care.
We were removed last night from St.
Alvin's to Colwood Bay, where we
await in anxious hope of being admitted
into the Duke of Altamonte's presence.

This is written by the most guilty and
miserable servant of the Duke of Alta-
monte.
" ANDREW MACPHERSON."
" Thanks be to God," cried the duke,
my sister is innocent; and the mean.
ing of this will be soon explained." The
remainder of the packet consisted of
letters---many of them in the hand-wri-
ting of Lady Margaret, many in that of
Glenarvon: some were dated Naples,
and consisted of violent professions of
love: the letters of a later date contained
for the most part asseverations of inno-
cence, and entreaties for secrecy and
silence: and though worded with caution,
continually alluded to some youthful
boy, and to injuries and cruelties with
which the duke was entirely unacquaint-
ed. In addition to these extraordinary
papers, there were many of a treasonable
nature, signed by the most considerable
land holders and tenantry in the country.

But that which most of all excited the
duke's curiosity, was a paper addressed
to himself in Italian, imploring him, as
he valued the prosperity of his family,
and every future hope, not to attend to
the words of Macpherson, who was in
the pay of Lord Glenarvon, and acting
under his commands; but to hasten to
St. Alvin's Priory, when a tale of horror
should be disclosed to his wondering
ears, and a treasure of inconceivable
value be replaced in his hands.

CHAPTER XXVI.
So many strange asseverations, and so
inany inconsistencies, could only excite
doubt, astonishment, and suspicion ; when
Lady Margaret, re-entering the apartment,
asked her brother in a voice of excessive
agitation, whether he would go with
Colonel de Ruthven, who had called for
him? And without leaving him time to
answer, implored that he would not.
" Your earnestness to dissuade me is
somewhat precipitate --- your looks ---
your agitation...." "Oh, Altamonte, the
time is past for concealment, go not
to your enemies to hear a tale of falsehood
and horror. I, whom yon have loved,
sheltered, and protected, I, your own,
your only sister, have told it you--- will
tell it you further; but before I make

I open my heart's black secrets to your
eyes, give me your hand. Let me look
at you once more. Can I have strength
to endure it?, Yes, sooner than suffer
these vile slanderers to triumph, What
dare I not endure !
" I am about to unfold a dreadful mys.
tery, which may no longer be concealed.
I come to accuse myself of the blackest
of crimes."  This is no time for explana-
tion," said the duke.
" Yet hear me;
for I require, I expect no mercy at your
hands. You have been to me the best
of brothers--- the kindest of friends.
Learn by the confession I am now going
to make, in what manner I have requited
you." Lady Margaret rose from her
chair at these words, and shewed strong
signs of the deep agitation of mind under
which she laboured. Endeavouring not
to meet the eyes of the duke,

manner, " when my character was lost,

I durst not do it.
" I will not dwell upon a horrid scene
which you remember full well. There
is but one on earth capable of executing
such a crime: he loved your sister ; and
to possess this heart, he destroyed your
child.How he destroyed him I know
not. We saw the boy, cold, even in
death-We wept over him: and now,
upon plea of some petty vengeance,
because I will not permit him to draw
me further into his base purposes, he is
resolved to make this scene of blood and
iniquity public to the world. He has

impostor in the place of your murdered
infant!"" Who will do this?"" Vi.

" I have not that strength," he con-

The duke continued many moments on
the spot where she had left him, without
lifting his eyes from the ground-with-
out moving, or speaking, or giving the
smallest sign of the deep feelings by
which he was overpowered; when sud-

presence at this moment, my lord, I was
not prepared." " Whom does Lady
Margaret accuse?" said Lord Glenarvon
tremulously. "One whom I know not,"
said the duke " Viviani." Glenarvon's
countenance changed, as with a look of
exultation and malice he repeated :
"Yes, it is Viviani." He then briefly
stated that Count Gondimar, having ac-
companied Lady Margaret from Italy to
Ireland in the yearhad concealed
under a variety of disguises a young
Italian, by name Viviani. To him the
charge of murdering the heir of Delaval
was assigned; but he disdained an act so
horrible and base. La Crusca, a wretch
trained in Viviani's service, could answer
for himself as to the means he took to

senting him to Lady Avondale as her
page.
In corroboration of these facts, he was
ready to appeal to Gondimar, and some
others, who knew of the transaction.
Gondimar, however, Lord Glenarvon
acknowledged, was but a partial witness,
having been kept in ignorance as to the
material part of this affair, and having
been informed by Lady Margaret that

theft, they had procured the boy to be
sent from the castle.
Lord Glenarvon then briefly stated,
that he had rescued him from Gon-
dimar's hands, with the assistance of a
servant named Macpherson, and some of
his followers; and that ever since he had
kept him concealed at the priory." And
where is he at this time?" said the duke.--
He was with Lord Glenarvon's cousin,
Colonel de Ruthven, at Colwood Bay."
" And when could the duke speak with
Viviani?"". When it was his pleasure."
"That night?"" Yes, even on that very
night."-"What witness could Lord Glen-

by Viviani's orders: he had returned
in company with Macpherson to Ireland.
Lord Glenarvon had offered him an
asylum at his castle. Lady Margaret one
day had beheld him ; and Gondimar had
even fainted upon seeing him suddenly,
having repeatedly been assured that he
was dead."-"By whom was he informed
that he was dead?"-" By Lady Margaret
and Viviani."Was Gondimarthen aware
of this secret?"-"No; but of other se-
crets, in which La Crusca and Viviani
were concerned, equally horrible per-
haps, but not material now to name."
This conversation having ended, the
duke ordered his carriage, and prepared
to drive to Colwood Bay. Lord Glen-
arvon promised in a few hours to meet
him there, and bring with him Viviani.
" If he restore my child, and confesses
every thing," said the duke, before he
left Lord Glenaryon, " pray inform hii,
that I will promise him a pardon." " He
values not such promise," said Glen-

Vi-
viani can confer favours, but not receive
them." The duke started, and looked
full in the face of Glenarvon. 66 Who is
this Viviani?" he said, in a tone of voice
loud and terrible. " An idol," replied
Glenarvon, " whom the multitude have
set up for themselves, and worshipped,
forsaking their true faith, to follow
after a false light---a man who is in
love with crime and baseness.--one, of
whom it has been said, that he hath an
imagination of fire playing around a
heart of ice---one whom the never-dying
worm feeds on by night and day.--a
hypocrite," continued Glenarvon, with a
smile of bitterness, " who wears a mask
to his friends, and defeats his enemies by
his unexpected sincerity---a coward,
with more of bravery than some who
fear nothing; for, even in his utmost
terror, he defies that which he fears,"

to hold him ? What rack has been pre-
pared to punish him for his crimes?"
6. He is as I have said," replied Glen-
arvon triumphantly, " the idol of the
fair, and the great. Is it virtue that
women prize? Is it honour and renown
they worship? Throw but the dazzling
light of genius upon baseness, and cor-
ruption, and every crime will be to them
but an additional charm."

The Duke then rang the bell, and or-
dered his carriage. It was about four in
the afternoon when he left the castle:
he sent a message to Lady Margaret
and Mrs. Seymour, to say that he had
ordered dinner to a wait his return at
seven.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
No sooner had the duke, accompanied
by Macpherson, who waited for him, left
the castle, than Mrs. Seymour sought
Lady Margaret in her apartment. The
door was fastened from within :---it was
in vain she endeavoured by repeated
calls to obtain an answer---a strange
fear occurred to her mind.--. There were
rumours abroad, of which she was not
wholly ignorant. Was it credible that a
sudden paroxysm of despair had led
her to the last desperate measure of
frantic woe? The God of mercy forbid !
Still she felt greatly alarmed. The
duke returned not, as he had promised :
the silence of the castle was mournful;
and terror seemed to have spread itself
amongst all the inhabitants. Mac Allain

if the duke were not to have returned at
the hour of dinner; and whether it was

shrieks, long and repeated, were heard.

their pikes and their bayonets, they are

Mac Allain threw up the sash of the
window: the servants crowded towards
it. The men had seized whatever arms
they could find: the women wept aloud.
By the light of the moon, crowds were

seen advancing through the wood and
park, giving the alarm by one loud and
terrific yell. They repeated one word
more frequently than any other. As they
approached, it was plainly distinguished:
-murder! murder! was the cry; and the
inhabitants of the castle heard it as a
summons to instant death. The Count
Viviani's name and Lady Margaret's
were then wildly repeated. The doors
were in vain barricadoed and defended
from within. The outer courts were so
tumultuously crowded, that it became
dangerous to pass. Loud cries for the
duke to appear were heard.
A rumour that the heir of Delaval
was alive had been circulated that blood
had been spilt. - Let us see our young
lord, long life to him !" was shouted in
transports of ecstasy by the crowd ;
whilst yells of execration mingled against
his persecutor and oppressor.

Suddenly a bugle horn from a distance
sounded. Three times it sounded; and
the silence became as general as the
tumult previously had been. In the
space of a few moments, the whole of
the crowd dispersed; and the castle was
again left to loneliness and terror.
The inhabitants scarcely ventured to
draw their breath. The melancholy
howling of the watch-dogs alone was
heard. Mrs. Seymour, who had shewn
a calm fortitude in the hour of danger,
now sickened with despondency. "Some

in dreadful suspense. Lady Margaret's

but no one was there. It appeared she
had gone out alone, possibly in quest of

WHEN the duke arrived at Colwood
Bay, he found Colonel de Ruthven pre-
pared to receive him ; but was surprised
and alarmed at hearing that Lord Glen-
arvon had that very morning sent for
Zerbellini, and neither himself nor the
boy had been seen since. The duke
then informed the colonel that Lord
Glenarvon had been at the castle about
an hour since; but this only made the
circumstance of his having taken away
the child more extraordinary.

engaged a packet the night before, and
had taken leave of his friends, as if at that

pherson : the former was still at St. Alvin
Priory-the latter immediately obeyed
the summons, and prepared to answer
every question that was put to him.
The duke first enquired of this man
his name, and the principal events of his
life. Macpherson, in answer to these
interrogations, affirmed, that he was a
rrative of Ireland ; that he had been taken
a boy into the service of the late Coun-
tess of Glenarvon, and had been one of
the few who had followed her into Italy;
that after this he had accompanied her
the young earl, through many
changes of life and fortune; but having
been suddenly dismissed from his ser.

year; during which time he had taken
into his pay a desperado, named La

Crusca, who had continued with him
whilst he resided at Florence,
After this, Macpherson hesitated,
evaded, and appeared confused; but sud-
denly recollecting himself: "I then be-
came acquainted," he said, " with the
Count Viviani, a young Venetian, who
took me inmediately into his service,
and who, residing for the most part in
the palace belonging to Lady Margaret
at Naples, passed his time in every ex-
cess of dissipation and amusement which
that town afforded. In the spring of the
year, the count accompanied Lady Mar-
garet secretly to Ireland, and, after much
conversation with me, and many remon-
strances on my part, gave me a positive
command to carry off the infant Marquis
of Delaval, but to spare his life. He
menaced me with employing La Crusca
in a more bloody work, if I hesitated;
and, having offered an immense bribe,
interest, affection for himself, and fear,

induced me to obey. My daughter,"
continued Macpherson,
was in the
power of the count:-she had listened
too readily to his suit. "I will expose
her to the world I will send her forth
unprovided,' he said, if you betray me,
or refuse to obey."
" No excuses," cried the duke,
fiercely: " proceed. It is sufficient you
willed the crime. Now tell me how
amongst you you achieved it." "I
must be circumstantial in my narrative,
said Macpherson ; " and since your
grace has the condescension to hear me,
you must hear all with patience; and
first, the Count Viviani did not slay the
Lord of Delaval: he did not employ me
in that horrid act. I think no bribe or
menace could have engaged me to per-
form it: but a strange, a wild idea, oc-
curred to him as he passed with me
through Wales, in our journey hither; and
months and months succeeded, before it
was in my power to execute his com-

to discover an infant who in any degree
might resemble the little marquis. Hav-
ing given up the pursuit as impossible,
I returned to inform the count of the
failure of his project. A double reward
was proffered, and I set forth again,
scarce knowing the extent of his wishes,
scarce daring to think upon the crime I
was about to commit.
"It is useless to detail iny adventur s,

undoubted witnesses of their truth : and

after having travelled far, I stopped at an

Maryvale, in the County of Tyrone. I
called for a horse ; my own was worn out

they drove away all disturbing thoughts :

-but, as I lifted the cup a second time
to my lips, my eyes fixed themselves
upon a child; and I trembled with agita-
tion, for I saw my prey before me. The
woman of the house spoke but little
English ; but she approached me, and
expressed her fear that I was not well.
Sensible that my emotion had betrayed
me, I affected to be in pain, offered
her money, and abruptly took leave.
There was a wood not far from the
town.
"On a subsequent evening I allured
her to it: the baby was at her breast. I
asked her its name...- Billy Kendal,'
she answered, for the love of its father
who fights now for us at a distance. I
will be its father,' I said. But she chid
me from her, and was angrily about to
leave me: striking her to the earth, I
seized the child. The age, the size---
every thing corresponded. I had bar-
tered my soul for gold, and difficulties
and failures had not shaken mes I had

made every necessary preparation ; and
all being ready and secure, I fled; nor
stopped, nor staid, nor spoke to man, nor
shewed myself in village or in town, till I
arrived at my journey's end."
I arrived in the neighbourhood of
Castle Delaval, and continued to see
my master, without being recognized
by any other.
He appeared much
agitated when he first beheld me. I
cannot forget his smile. He desired me
to keep the boy with me out at sea
that night; and directing me to climb
from the wherry up the steep path of
the western cliff (where but yesterday
I stood when the colonel sent for me),
he promised to place food, and all that
was requisite for us, near the chapel.
But trust no one with your secret,' he
said: let not the eye of man glance
upon you. Meet me in the night, in the
forest near the moor, and bring the
child. Mind that you do not utter one
word, and let it not have the power of

disturbing us. Do you understand me?'
Yes, I said, and shuddered because
I did so. My master saw me shrink,
and reminded me of the reward. I un-
dertook punctually to fulfil every
in-
junction : it was now too late to repent.
But, oh, my lord! when I think of that
night, that accursed night, what horror
comes over me !
" It was past twelve o'clock when I
took the boy up from a sweet sleep, and
fastening the wherry near the fuot of the
rock, with one hand I climbed the steep
ascent, while with the other I carefully
held the child. In one part the cliff is
almost perpendicular: my foot slipped,
and I was in danger of falling ; but I re-
covered myself with much exertion,
There was no moon; and the wind whis-
tled loud and shrilly through the church-
yard. It is, I believe, two miles from
thence to the castle ; but through the
thick wood I now and then caught a
glimpse of its lighted portico; and, re-

membering its former gaiety, ' you re-
joice to-night,' I thought, with music
and dancing, regardless of my sorrows,
* or the hardships of others, even more
"wretched than I: but to-morrow, the
black foot of care shall tread heavy even
upon you.'
" The wind rustled among the trees.
This was the spot in which I was to
meet my employer. I heard a step; it
approached ; and I pressed the child
nearer to my bosom.  Some mother is
weeping for you sorely, little boy,' I
said ; and would give all she is worth
to see that pretty face again. She little
dreams of your hard fate, or into what
rough hands her treasure has fallen; but
I will not harm thee, boy. Hard must
be the heart that could. Such were my
thoughts: God be witness, such were
my intentions at that moment. I now
saw La Crusca ; and well I knew by the
villain's countenance his horrible inten.

arm, and asked me why I trembled. He

low voice from the cliff.
" It was my lord "" Who?" cried the
duke. My master, the Count Viviani.
He had returned to give me further in-
structions. I ascended the fearful steep,
and listened in silence; but, before he left
me, I ventured to ask after the boy,

exclude us for ever from its courts.'
Saying which, he bade me hasten to
some distant country. He entrusted the
Lord of Delayal to my care, repeated his
instructions, and for the second time that
night departed. The morning sun, when it
rose, all glorious, and lighted the eastern
sky with its beams, found me still no-
tionless upon the cliff. My eye invo-
luntarily fixed upon
the
great land-mark,
the mountains which extend behind yon
beautiful valley; but, starting at the
thought of the crime I had committed, I
turned for ever from them. I thought
never again to behold a prospect so little
in unison with my feelings. It is many
years since I have seen it; but now I
can gaze on nothing else. My eyes are
dimn with looking upon the scene, and
with it upon the memory of the past."
Macpherson paused :-He turned to
see what impression his narrative had
made on the duke: he was utterly

silent.-Macpherson therefore continued :
" So far we had succeeded but too well
in our black attempt ; but the fair boy
intrusted to me sickened under the hard-
ships to which I was obliged to expose
him. The price agreed on was paid
me. La Crusca joined me; and together
we reared the child in a foreign country,
so as I hope to do him honour. But
a dark malady at times had fallen upon
La Crusca. He would see visions of
horror ; and the sight of a mother and a
child threw him into frenzy, till it
became necessary to confine him. I had
not heard for some time from my master.
I wished to bring my young charge back
to his own country, before I died. I
wrote; but no one answered myl etters.
I applied to the Count Gondimar ; but
he refused to hear me.
" I had assumed another name; I lived:
apparently in happiness and afluence.
" Accompanied by La Crusca, I return-
ed first to England and then to Ireland.
## p. 255 (#967) ############################################
GLENARVON.
253
I sought Count Gondimar; but he evaded
my enquiries; and having taken the child
from me, insisted upon my silence, and
dispatched me to Ireland with letters for
the Lord Glenarvon, who immediately re-
cognized and received me."
66 Where?"
cried the duke. Macpherson hesitated.---
" At the priory, where he then resided,
and where he remained concealed : La
Crusca was likewise permitted to dwell
there; but of this story my lord was ig-
norant till now." " That is false," said
the duke. "One morning La Crusca be-
held Lady Margaret even as in a vision,
on that spot to which I every day re-
turned; but he had not power to speak.
Madness, frenzy had fallen on him.
Lord Glenarvon protected him. His
house was also my only refuge. He ga-
thered from me much of the truth of what
I have related, but I never told him all. I
durst not speak till now. He was deeply
moved with the wrongs of the injured
boy; he vowed to revenge them; but he

" Where?" said the duke starting,
" where did you say Viviani, that damned
Italian, had once concealed the child?
He is there now perhaps ! there, there let
us seek him."'--" In the chapel," said
Macpherson hesitating, " there is a vault,
of which he retains the key; and there is

duke.... What hour is it?" " Nine."
"Oh! that it may not be too late ! that he
may not already have taken advantage of
the darkness of evening to escape !" Saying
this, the duke and Colonel de Ruthven
having previously given orders to the ser-
vants to watch Macpherson carefully,
drove with all possible haste to the chapel,

near the Abbey of Belfont. But still they
hoped that Viviani was, their friend---
He could have no motive in concealing
the child: bis only wish was probably to
restore him, and by this means make
terms for himself. With such thoughts
they proceeded to the appointed spot.
And it is there that for some moments
we must leave them. The duke was
convinced in his own mind who his real
and sole enemy was; he was also firmly
resolved not to let hiin escape: he knew
also what part of Macpherson's narrative
to believe.

CHAPTER XXX.
VivianJ had long and repeatedly me-
paced Lady Margaret with vengeance.
In every moment of resentment, on every
new interview, at every parting scene,
revenge, immediate and desperate, was
the cry; but it had been so often repeated,
and so often had proved a harmless threat,
that it had at length lost all effect upon
her. She considered him as a depraved and
weak character---base enough to attempt
the worst; but too cowardly to carry his
project into effect. She knew him not.
That strong, that maddening passion
which had taken such deep root in his
soul, still at times continued to plead
for her; and whilst hope, however falla.
cious, could be cherished by him, he
would not at once crush her beyond

recovery. A lesser vengeance had not
gratified the rage of his bosom; and the
certainty that the menaced blow when it
fell would overwhelm them both in one
fate, gave him malignant consolation.
Her renewed intercourse with Lord
Dartford he had endured. Lord Dart-
ford had prior claims to himself; and
though it tortured him to see them in
each other's society, he still forbore:
but when he saw that he was the mere
object of her hate, of her ridicule, of her
contempt, his fury was beyond all con-
troul. He wrote to her, he menaced her;
he left her, he returned; but he felt his
own little importance in the unprovoked
calm with which shie at all times receiv.

Leave

who have never felt,
whose pulse has never risen with the
burning fires of passion, whose life, un-
varied and even, has ever flowed the

incredulity; but when obliged to credit
it, he felt with all the poignancy of real
misery. The scene that took place be-
tween himself and his mother had left
him yet one doubt: upon that doubt he
rested. It was her solemn asseveration
of innocence. But the heart that is ut-
terly corrupted fears not to perjure itself;
and he continued in suspense ; for he be-
lieved her guilty.
Such was the state of things, when
Viviani, having by fraud again possessed
himself of Zerbellini, sought Lady Mar-

after the duke had left the castle. He
well knew whither he was gone ; he
well knew also, that it was now too late
to recall the vengeance he had decreed ;
yet one hope for Lady Margaret and

him upon that hour. All was prepared
for flight in case he needed it; and with
her, what perils would he not encounter.
He entered the castle, much disguised :
he made her the proposal ; but she re-
ceived it with disdain. One thing alone
she wished to know; and that she so-
lemnly enjoined him to confess to her :
was Zerbellini the real heir of Delaval ?
--- was she guiltless of the murder of
her brother's child ? - You shall see him,
speak with bim," said Viviani, " if you
will follow me as soon as the night is
dark. I will conduct you to him, and
your own eyes and ears shall be con-
vinced."
So saying, he left her to all the horrors

of her own black imagination; but, re,
turning at the time appointed, he led
her to the wood, telling her that the boy
was concealed in an apartment of the
turret, close to the chapel. Suddenly
pausing, as he followed the path :---
" This is the very tree," he cried, turning
round, and looking upon her fiercely ;
yes, this is the spot upon which La
Crusca shed the blood of an innocent
for you." " Then the boy was really
and inhumanly murdered," said Lady
Margaret, pale with horror at the thought,
but still unappalled for herself.

Do you hope for mercy ?" he cried, seiz.

- Not from you.
" Dare you appeal to heaven?" She
would not answer. "I must embrace
thee here, lady, before we for ever part."
" Monster!" said Lady Margaret, seeing
the dagger in his hand, as he placed his
arm around her neck.

at his closely locked fist. 66 Stab here...

and perverted, yet exists to execrate thy
crimes, and to lament its own."
" Die
then---thus---thus," said her enraged, her
inhuman lover, as he struck the dagger,
without daring to look where his too
certain hand had plunged it. Lady
Margaret shrunk not from the blow;
but fixing her dying eyes reproachfully
upon him, closed them not, even when
the spirit of life was gone.
Her murderer stood before her, as if
astonished at what he had dared to do.
" Lie there, thou bleeding victim,"
he said, at length pausing to contemplate
his bloody work. " Thou hast thought
it no wrong to violate thy faith---to make

as fair, as false, advance into the world,

system of the arts of love, let them,
ainidst the new conquests upon which
they are feeding their growing vanity,
hear of thy fate and tremble."
Saying these words, and flying with a
rapid step, his dagger yet reeking with
the blood of his victim, he entered the
town of Belfont, at the entrance of which
he met St. Clare, and a crowd of fol-
lowers, returning from the last meeting at
Inis Tara, " Hasten to the castle," he
cried, addressing all who surrounded
him ; " sound there the alarum; for

duke; then return and meet me at the
chapel, and I will restore to your gaze
your long forgotten and much injured
lord." The people in shouts re-echoed
the mysterious words, but the darkness
of evening prevented their seeing the
horrid countenance of the wretch who ad-
dressed them. St. Clare alone recognised
the murderer, and fled. Viviani then re.
turned alone to the chapel.

CHAPTER XXXI.
The carriage which had conveyed the
Duke of Altamonte and Colonel De
Ruthven from Colwood Bay could not
proceed along that narrow path which
led across the wood to the chapel;
they were therefore compelled to alight;
and, hastening on along the road with
torches and attendants, they enquired
repeatedly concerning the loud shouts
and yells which echoed in every direction
around them,
They were at some little distance from
the chapel, when the duke paused in
horror. The moonlight shone upon the
bank, at the entrance of the beech trees;
and he there beheld the figure of a female
as she lay extended upon the ground,
covered with blood. Her own rash

band, he thought, had perhaps destroyed
her. He approached, ---it was Lady
Margaret! That proud spirit, which had
so long supported itself, had burst its
fetters. He gazed on her in surprise.---
He stood a few moments in silence, as
if it were some tragic representation he
were called to look upon, in which he
himself bore no part---some scene of hor-
ror, to which he had not been previously
worked up, and which consequently had
not power to affect him. Her face was
scarce paler than usual; but there was a
look of horror in her countenance, which
disturbed its natural expression. In one
hand, she had grasped the turf, as if
the agony she had endured had caused a
convulsive motion; the other was stained
with blood, which had flowed with much
violence. It was strange that the wound
was between her right shoulder and her
throat, and not immediately perceivable,
as she had fallen back upon it:---it was
more than strange, for it admitted little

doubt that the blow had not been in-
ficted by herself. Yet, if inhumanly
murdered, where was he who had dared
the deed? The duke knelt beside her:
.--he called to her; but all mortal aid
was ineffectual.
The moon-beam played amidst the
foliage of the trees, and lighted the plains
around :-no trace of the assassin could
be observed :--the loneliness of the scene
was uninterrupted. A dark shadow now
became visible upon the smooth surface
of the green--was it the reflection of
the tree.--or was it a human form? It
lengthened---it advanced from the thicket,

vanced with haste, and paused again,---
now, standing upon the plain between
the beech wood and the chapel, ap-
peared like one dark solitary spot in the
lonely scene.
The duke had concealed himself; but
the indignant spirit within prompted him
to follow the figure, indifferent to the
fate that might await on his temerity.
Much he thought that he knew him by
his air and Italian cloak; but as his disa
guise had entirely shrouded his features,
he could alone indulge his suspicions;
and it was his interest to watch him un-
perceived. He, therefore, made sign to
his attendants to conceal themselves in
the wood; and alone, accompanied by
Colonel De Ruthven, he followed to-
wards the chapel. There the figure
paused, and seemed to breathe with dif.
ficulty, slowly turning around to gaze
if all were safe:---then, throwing his
dark mantle back, shewed to the face of
Heaven the grim and sallow visage of

" Zerbellini," he cried, " Zerbellini,
come down.---Think me not your enemy
---I am your real friend, your preserver.
---Come down, my child. With all but
a brother's tenderness, I wait for you."
Arouzed by this signal, a window
was opened from an apartment adjoining
the cloister; and a boy, lovely in youth,
mournfully answered the summons. "O!
my kind protector!" he said,
- I thought
you
had resolved to leave me to perish
here. If, indeed, I am all you tell me---

the strongest interest in the duke.
He eagerly advanced forward. Colonel

wished to know Viviani's intention; and
they were near enough to seize him at
any time, if he attempted to escape.
They were concealed behind the pro-
jecting arch of the chapel; and whilst
they beheld the scene, it was scarce pos-
sible that the Italian should so turn him-
self as to discover them. By the strong

was turned, beheld the features of Zer-

often excited a strange einotion in his
bosom, and which now appealed forcibly
to his heart, as claiming an alliance with
him. Let then the ecstasy of his feelings
be imagined, whilst still dubious, still
involved in uncertainty and surprise.
Viviani, having clasped the boy to his
bosom, said in an impassioned yoice
these words :---- Much injured child,

false and cruel woman, thou hast ex.
perienced the chastening rod of adver-
sity, and art now prepared for the fate
that awaits thee.
" Albert," he continued, " let me be
the first to address thee by that name,
canst thou forgive, say, canst thou for.
" I know as yet but imper-
fectly," said the boy, " what your con-
duct to me has been. At times I have
trusted you as a friend, and considered

on me, even as in sleep I saw thee smile,

Boy of my fondest interest, come to my

" Wretch !" cried the duke, rushing
forward :---but in vain his haste. With
the strength of desperate guilt, the Italian
had grasped the boy, and bearing him in
sudden haste to the edge of the frightful
chasm, he was on the point of throw-
ing himself and the child from the top of
it, when the duke, with a strong grasp,
seizing him by the cloak, forcibly de-
tained him.-.-" Wretch," he cried, " live
to feel a father's vengeance!--- live to...

" To restore your son," said Glenarvon,
with a hypocritical smile, turning round
and gazing on the duke. " Ha, whom
do I behold! no Italian, no Viviani, but
Glenarvon." 6 Yes, and to me, to
me alone, you owe the safety of your
child. Your sister decreed his death-I
sav'd him. Now strike this bosom if you
will."..." What are you? Who are you?"
said the duke. 66 Is it now alone that
you know Glenarvon?" he replied
with a sneer.
"I suspected this; but
that name shall not save you."..." No-
thing can save me," said Glenarvon,
mournfully. " All hell is raging in my
bosom. My brain is on fire. You can-
not add to my calamities."
" Why a
second time attempt the life of my child?"
Despair prompted me to the deed,"
said Glenarvon, putting his hand to his
head: "all is not right here---madness
has fallen on me." " Live, miserable
sinner," said the duke, looking upon
him with contempt: " you are too base

to die...I dare not raise my arm against
you."
" Yet I am defenceless," said
Glenarvon, with a bitter smile, throwing
the dagger to the ground. Depart
for ever from me," said the duke..." your
presence here is terrible to all."
Zerbellini now knelt before his father,
who, straining him closely to his bosom,
wept over him. ---In a moment, yells and
cries were heard ; and a thousand torches
illumined the wood. Some stood in hore
ror to contemplate the murdered form of
Lady Margaret; others, with shouts of
triumph, conveyed the heir of Delaval

lain, and others, received with transport
the long lost boy: shouts of delight and
cheers, long and repeated, proclaimed
his returo. The rumour of these events
spread far and wide; the concourse of
people who crowded around to hear and
inquire, and see their young lord, was
immense.
A mournful silence succeeded. Lady

Margaret's body was conveyed to the
castle. Buchanan followed in hopeless
grief: he prest the duke's hand; then
rushed from his presence. He sought
St. Clare. " Where is Glenarvon ?" he
cried. In his blood, in his blood, I
must revenge my own wrongs and a
mother's death." Glenarvon was gone.
One only attendant had followed him,
O'Kelly, who had prepared every thing
for his flight. Upon that night they had
made their escape, O'Kelly, either igno-
rant of his master's crimes, or willing to
appear so, tried severely but faithful to
the last. They sailed: they reached the
English shore ; and before the rumour of
these events could have had time to
spread, Glenarvon bad taken the com-
mand of his ship, following with intent
to join the British fleet, far away from
his enemies and his friends.
Macpherson was immediately seized.
He acknowledged that Lord Glenarvon,

Count Gondimar's assistance, assumed
the name of Viviani, until the time when
he appeared in his own character at St.
Alvin Priory. The rest of the confes.
sion he had privately made concerning
the child was found to be true.
Wit-
nesses were called. The mother of Billy
Kendall and La Crusca corroborated the
fact. La Crusca and Macpherson re-
ceived sentence of death.

THE heart sometimes swells with a fore-
thought of approaching dissolution ; and
Glenarvon, as he had cast many a home-
ward glance upon his own native moun.
tains, knew that he beheld them for the
last time. Turning with sadness towards
them, " Farewell to Ireland," he cried ;
" and may better hearts support her
rights, and revenge her wrongs ! I must
away." Arrived in England, he travelled
in haste; nor paused till he gained the
port in which his ship was stationed.
He sailed in a fair frigate with a gallant
crew, and no spirit amongst them was so
light, and no heart appeared more brave.
Yet he was ill in health ; and some ob-
served that he drank much, and oft, and
that he started from his own thoughts ;

then laughed and talked with eagerness,
as if desirous to forget them. "I shall
die in this engagement," he said, ad.
dressing his first lieutenant. "Hardhead,
I shall die; but I care not. Only this
remember.--whatever other ships may do,
let the Emerald be first and last in action.
This is Glenarvon's command.-.-Say,
shall it be obeyed?"---Upon the night
after Lord Glenarvon had made his escape
from Ireland, and the heir of Delaval had
been restored to his father, a stranger

had abandoned his country's cause.

When kinc at morn refuse to graze,
And the green leaf begins to turn;
Then shall pain and sickuess come,
Storms abroad, and woes at home.
When cocks are heard to crow at er'n,
And swallows slowly ply their wing;
When home-bound ships from port are driving
And dolphins roll, and mermaids sing;
Then shall pain and sickness come,

When on the willow boughs their harps they hung,
And wept for lost Jerusalem! A train
More sorrowful before my eyes appear :

No sooner had St. Clare ended, than
Buchanan, joining with her and the rest
of the rebels, gave signal for the long
expected revolt. " Burn his castle--de.
stroy his land," said St. Clare. Her fol.
lowers prepared to obey : with curses
loud and repeated, they vented their exe-
cration. Glenarvon, the idol they had once
adored, they now, perhaps, with greater
show of justice despised.
" Were he only
a villain," said one, " I, for my part,
would pardon him: but he is a coward
and a hypocrite: when he commits a
wrong he turps it upon another; he is a
smooth dissembler, and while he smiles
he stabs." All his ill deeds were now
collected together from far and near, to
strengthen the violence of resentment

grave of Alice, and sighed as they passed.
That white stone was placed over a
broken heart, they said : another turned
to the more splendid tomb of Calantha,
and cursed him for his barbarity to their
lady: " It was an ill return to so much
Jove--we do not excuse her, but we
must upbraid him." Then came they
to the wood, and Buchanan, trembling
with horror, spoke of his murdered mo-
ther. " Burn bis castles," they cried,
and execrate his memory from father
to son in Belfont." St. Clare suddenly
arose in the midst of the increasing
crowd, and thus, to inforce her
purpose,
again addressed her followers :-
"Let not rage against Glenarvon ac-
" tuate your resolves: whatever he may

It was about the second hour of night
when St. Clare reached Inis Tara, and
stood suspended between terror and ex-
ultation, as she watched the clouds of
smoke and fire which burst from the
turrets of Belfont. The ranks were every
where broken : soldiers in pursuit were
seen in detached parties, scouring over
every part of the country: the valley of
Altamonte

horse to horse, and man to man, opposed
each other. The pike and bayonet glit-
tered in the moon-beam ; and the distant

triumph, and the groans of despair,

steed, so that he could not perceive any
external object, she pressed the spur into
his sides, and gallopped in haste to the
edge of the cliff, from which she beheld,
like a sheet of fire reddening the heavens,
the blazing turrets of Belfont. She heard
the crash: she gazed in triumph, as
millions of sparks lighted the blue vault
of the heavens; and volumes of smoke,
curling from the ruins, half concealed the
ravages of the insatiate flame. Then she
drew the horn from her side, and sounding
it loud and shrill from Heremon cliff,
heard it answered from mountain to
mountain, by all her armed confederates.
The waves of the foaming billows now
reflected a blood-red light from the scorch-
ing flames........
Three hundred and sixty feet was the
cliff perpendicular from the vast fathom-

SHORT is the sequel of the history which
is now to be related. The strong arm of
power soon suppressed this partial rebel-
liop. Buchanan was found stretched
in death upon the field of battle, lovely
in form even in that hour.
The Marquis of Delaval, restored to
his family and fortune, soon forgot the
lesson adversity had taught. In the same
follies and the same vanities his prede.
cessors had passed their days, he likewise
endeavoured to enjoy the remainder of his.
The Duke of Altamonte lived long
enough to learn the mournful truth, which
pride had once prevented him from be-
lieving, the perishableness of all human
strength, the littleness of all human great-
ness, and the vanity of every enjoyment
this world can offer. OfSophia, of Frances,

They passed tranquilly with the thousands
that sail daily along the stream of folly,
uncensured and uncon, mended. Youth,
beauty, and vanity, were their's: they en.
joyed and suffered all the little pleasures;
and all the little pains of life, and resisted
all its little temptations. Lady Mande .

away likewise each pleasureable moment
as frivolously, though perhaps less inno-
cently; then turned to weep for the errors
into which they had been drawn, more
humble in themselves when sorrow had
ehastened them. Then it was that they
called to the flatterers of their prosperous
days; but they were silent and cold:
then it was that they looked for the friends
who had encircled them once; but they
were not to be found : and they learned,
like the sinner they had despised, all
that terror dreams of on its sick bed,
and all that misery in its worst moments
can conceive. Mrs. Seymour, in acts

of piety and benevolence, retired to
the Garden Cottage, a small estate the
Duke of Altamonte had settled on her ;
and she found that religion and virtue,
even in this world, have their reward. The
coldness, the prejudice, which, in the
presumption of her heart had once given
her an appearance of austerity, softened
in the decline of life ; and when she
considered the frailty of human nature, the
misery and uncertainty of existence, she
turned not from the penitent wanderer
who had left the right road, and spoke witb
severity alone of hardened and trium-
phant guilt. Her life was one fair course
of virtue; and when she died, thousands

As to the Princess of Madagascar, she
lived to a good old age, though death re-
peatedly gave her warning of his ap-

assent. Death now approached too pear
for further colloquy. The princess, pinch-
ing her attendants, that they might feel
for what she suffered, fainted: yet with
her dying breath again invoking the high
priest: " Hoiouskim," she cried, " obey
my last command: send all my attendants

not to reproach her: a friend more false,
a foe more timid yet insulting, a princess
more fond of power, never before or since
appeared in Europe. Hoiouskim wept
beside her, yet, when he recovered (and
your philosophers seldom die of sorrow)
it is said he retired to his own country,
and shrunk from every woman he after-
wards beheld, for fear they should remind
him of her he loved so well, and prove
another Princess of Madagascar. It is
said, that all the reviewers, who had bar-
tered their independence for the comforts
and flattery of Barbary House, died in the
same year as the princess, of an epidemie
disorder; but of this, who can be secure?
Perhaps, alas ! one yet remains to punish
the flippant tongue, that dared to assert
they were no more. But to return from

the stream of Allen flowed smooth and
clear. Every object around breathed the
fragrance of plants----the charms and
sweets of nature. The heat of summer
had not parched its verdant meads, and
autumn's yellow tints had but just
touched the shadowy leaf. Wearied
with scenes of woe, Lord Avondale,
having broken from society and friends,
had retired to this retreat---a prey to the
fever of disappointment and regret---
wounded by the hand of his adversary,
but still more effectually destroyed by the
unkindness and inconstancy of his friend.

Sir Richard, before he departed to
join the fleet, called at Allenwater.---
" How is your master?" he said, in
a hurried manner. " He is ill," said
James Collingwood.
" He will rise
from his bed no more." Sir Richard
pressed forward ; and trembling exceed-
ingly, entered Lord Avondale's room.--

bed ?" " It is Harry Mowbrey, Calantha's

weeping boy."

which seemed to disdain all exhibition
of weakness; and with him, the sole other
attendant of his sufferings, Cairn of Cole-

welcomed Calantha, then a fair and
lovely bride, spotless in vestal purity,
and dearer to his master's heart than the
very life-blood that gave it vigour. He
now poured some opiate drops into a
glass, and placed it in the feeble hand
which was stretched forth to receive it.
" Ab! father, do not leave me," said his
little son, pressing towards him.
My
mother looked as you do before she left
me: and will you go also? What then
will become of me?" Tears gushed into
Lord Avondale's eyes, and trickled
down his faded cheeks.  God will
bless and protect my boy," he said, en-
deavouring to raise himself sufficiently to
press his little cherub lips. It was like

by his grief; " and all who knew you

the boy: "it grieves him so to see you.

I think this dreadful stillness is what
every one calls death. Oh! father, look
at me once more. Speak one dear word
only to say you love me still." "I can't
bear this," said Sir Richard, hurrying
from the room.  I can't bear it."
The hour was that in which the setting
sun had veiled its last bright ray in the
western wave :--- it was the evening of
the tenth of October ! ! !
On the evening of the tenth of Octo-

that they were awaiting the attack
at few miles distance from shore,
between Camperdown and Egmont. It
was so still that evening that not a
breath of air rippled upon the glassy
waters. It was at that very instant of
time, when Avondale, stretched upon
his bed, far from those scenes of glory
and renown in which his earlier years
had been distinguished, had breathed his
last ; that Glenarvon, whilst walking the
deck, even in the light of departing day,
laughingly addressed his companions :
" Fear you to die?" he cried, to one
upon whose shoulder he was leaning.
" I cannot fear. But as it may be the
fate of all, Hardhead," he said, still
addressing his lieutenant, " if I die,
do
you present my last remembrance to

" For, come he slow, or come he fast,
It is but Death that comes at last."
He said, and smiled----that smile so
gentle and persuasive, that only to behold
to love. Suddenly he beheld
before him on the smooth wave a form so
pale, so changed, that, but for the stern-
ness of that brow, the fixed and hollow.
gaze of that dark eye, he had not recog-
nized, in the fearful spectre, the form of
Lord Avondale. "Speak your reproaches
as a man would utter them," he said.
" Ask of me the satisfaction due for
injuries ; but stand not thus before me,
like a dream, in the glare of day --like a
grim vision of the night, in the presence
of thousands."--The stern glazed eye
moved not: the palpable form continued.
Lord Glenarvon gazed till his eyes were
strained with the effort, and every faculty
was benumbed and overpowered.

Then fell a drowsiness over his senses
which he could not conquer; and he
said to those who addressed him, "I am
ill:---watch by me whilst I sleep." He
threw himself upon his cloak, listless
and fatigued, and sunk into a heavy
sleep. But his slumbers were broken
and disturbed ; and he could not recover
from the unusual depression of his spirits.
Every event of his short life crowded fast
upon his memory :---scenes long for.
gotten recurred ;--- he thought of broken
vows, of hearts betrayed, and of all the
perjuries and treacheries of a life given up
to love. But reproaches and bitterness
saddened over every dear remembrance,
and he participated, when too late, in the
sufferings he had inflicted.
All was now profoundly still: the third
wateh sounded. The lashing of the waves
against the sides of the ship---the gentle
undulating motion, again lulled a weary
and perturbed spirit to repose. Suddenly
upon the air he heard a fluttering, like

the noise of wings, which fanned him
while he slept. Gazing intently, he
fancied he beheld a fleeting shadow pass
up and down before him, as if the air,
thickening into substance, became visible
to the eye, till it produced a form clothed
in angelic beauty and unearthly bright-
It was some moments before he
could bring to his remembrance whom it
resembled, ---till a smile, all cheering, and
a look of one he had seen in happier
days, told him it was Calantha. Her
hair flowed loosely on her shoulders,
while a cloud of resplendent white sup-
ported her in the air, and covered her
partly from his view. Her eyes shone
with serene lustre; and her cheeks
glowed with the freshness of health :---
not as when impaired by sickness and
disease, he had seen her last---not as
when disappointment and the sorrows of
the world had worn her youthful form---

as from heaven irradiated her counte-
nance, and, pointing with her hand to the
east, he saw the sun burst from the clouds
which had gathered round it, and shine
forth in all its lustre. " Are you happy?"
cried Glenarvon, stretching out his arms
to catch the vision, which hovered near.
Calantha, speak to me:
am I still
loved ? Is Glenarvon dear even thus in

it at these words; and he beheld the form
of Calantha, pale and ghastly, as when
last they had parted. In seeming answer
to his question, she pressed her hands to
her bosom in silence, and casting upon
him a look so mournful that it pierced
his heart, she faded from before his sight,
dissolving like the silvery cloud into thin
air. At that moment, as he looked
around, the bright sun which had risen
with such glorious promise, was seen to
sink in mists of darkness, and with its
setting ray, seemed to tell him that his
hour was come, that the light of his ge-
nius was darkened, that the splendour
of his promise was set for ever: but he
met the awful warning without fear,
And now again he slept; and it seem-
ed to him that he was wandeting in a
smooth vale, far from the haunts of men.
The place was familiar to his memory :-

it was that long and pausing knell, which,

some fellow-creature's eteraal departure
from this lower world ; and ever while it
tolled, the dreary cry of woe lengthened
upon the breeze, mourning a spirit fled.
Glenarvon thought he heard a step slowly
stealing towards him; he even felt the
breath of some one near; and raising his
eye in haste, he perceived the thin form
of a woman close beside hiin. In her
arms she held a child, more wan than

seemed to freeze the life-blood in his
heart.
He gazed again. " Is it Calantha?"
he said. " Ah, no! it was the form of
Alice." She appeared as one returned
fron the grave, to which long mourning
and untimely woes had brought her.-
" Clarence," she said in a piercing voice,

The God of
Mercy deal not with you as you have

but gazing in agony upon an infant which
lay at her bosom, she looked up to Heaven,
from whence her eyes slowly descended
upon Glenarvon. She then approached,
and taking the babe from her breast, laid
it cold and lifeless on his heart. It was
the chill of death which he felt..-when,
uttering a deep groan, he started up with
affright.

heroic valour. The result it is pot for

Glenarvon, after the action, was taken

discredited ?" He asked this of his com-
panions; but the smile with which Glen-
arvon spoke these words, soon gave place
to strong feelings of surprise and alarm.---
Foreign was the niake of that ship; sable
were its sails; sable was the garb of its
crew ; but ghastly white and motionless
were the countenances of all. Upon the
deck there stood a man of great height
and size, habited in the apparel of a friar,
His cowl concealed his face; but his
crossed hands and uplifted attitude an-

that vessel? Am I waking, or do my
eyes, distempered by some strange malady,
deceive me? Bear on. It is the last
command of Glenarvon. Set full the
sajls. Bear on,-.-bear on : to death or
to victory !--It is the enemy of our souls
you see before you. Bear on-to death,
to vengeance; for all the fiends of hell
have conspired our ruin." They sailed
from coast to coast--- They sailed from sea
to sea, till lost in the inmensity of ocean.

your spirit dwell for ever, and for ever.
You have dreamed away life's joyous
hour, nor made atonement for error, nor
