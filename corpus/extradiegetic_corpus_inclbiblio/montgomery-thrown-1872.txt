PR E FA C E.
THE following story, like its predecessor, "Mis-
understood," is not intended for children. Even
less so, since in the course of the narrative the
author is obliged, now and then, to side, as it
were, with the children against the parents.
The story, though not devoid of "grown-up"
characters, is mainly founded on the lives of chil-
dren; and so appeals only to those who are in-
terested in the subject.
May, 1872.

C H A P T E R I.
THE HEROINE's HOME.
Five o'clock on a July afternoon in a London school-
room, and the depressing sound of the scale of C.
Would not such a combination make the least frivolous
rejoice that their education was completed?
Cecily Middleton, aged seven, is toiling up and down
the piano, with hot, heavy fingers, giving her wrist and
arm a tremendous jerk every time it is her thumb's turn
to go under; for which clumsy manoeuvre she is every
time pulled up by the governess at her side, and com-
pelled to return to the bottom of the piano and begin
the ascent again.
Nina Middleton, some years her senior, is sitting at the
table, limp and listless, by way of doing a rule-of-three
sum. With her hair all pushed back from her hot face,
and her chin resting on her hands, she is determining in
her own mind that it is far too hot for any sum to come
right, and she feels profoundly indifferent as to workmen.
and the rate of their wages, which is the problem she has
been given to consider. What can it matter? Whether
the answer will be in money or in workmen she feels in-
capable of hazarding an opinion, and it seems to her so
very unimportant. -

"Nina, vous ne faites rien."
Thus suddenly rebuked, Nina roused herself, and pro-
ceeded, with a long-drawn sigh, to multiply the first and
second terms together, and to divide by the third, pro-
ducing thereby a hideous confusion. Seeing her mistake,
she, with another sigh of weariness and boredom, rubbed
out what she had done, and began again; but the melan-
choly intonation of the scale of C, combined with the
state of the atmosphere, seemed to render calculation
impossible, and she found herself reducing pence to shil-
lings, and allowing for forty-eight farthings in a pound.
Growing desperate at last, with heat and incapacity, she
rubbed out the whole sum,question and all ; and then,
in despair at what she had done, she drew her pencil down
the slate with a terrific squeak, which brought upon her
the wrath of Mademoiselle, and elicited shrieks of delight
and amusement from Cecily. -
Of course, anything that created a momentary diversion
from the scale of C was hailed as a relief by Cecily, and
it took Mademoiselle some minutes, first to reprove Nina,
and then to rise and reset the sum. *-
But this was no solitary instance of Cecily's power of
deriving amusement from the trifling events of every-day
life. The squeak of a pencil was quite sufficient, in lesson-
time, to evoke her mirth, and any of the hundred little
accidents to which we are all more or less exposed in our
daily path could send her into fits of laughter at any
moment. If Mademoiselle knocked her funny-bone, or
caught her gown in the fender, upset a cup of tea into her
lap, or stumbled over a stool, Cecily was off, and there . .
was no stopping her. -
She enjoyed the few minutes of leisure at the piano to
the full; and, after having recovered from the laughter
produced by the squeak, she proceeded to swing her legs

backwards and forwards to cool herself. In so doing, she
made the startling discovery that by kicking the piano
above the pedal a vibration could be produced, and was
immensely delighted. But on attempting to bring the
discovery to greater perfection by a somewhat more vio-
lent kick, Mademoiselle remonstrated from the table, and
put an end at once to any further experiments. An at-
tempt at "hot-cross buns" with one finger met with a
similar reception, and she was reduced to twisting round
and round on the music-stool, till Mademoiselle once
more returned to her side.
But opportunities for amusement were not quite over
yet; for, as Mademoiselle reseated herself, she contrived
to knock her finger against the notes, and raised that
wounded member to her mouth with an exclamation of
pain. Peal upon peal from Cecily,truly delighted was
she. She rolled about on her seat till she nearly fell off
the music-stool, and Mademoiselle, in an injured and
somewhat huffy tone, desired her to resume her practice;
and soon laughter and amusement were lost in the intri-
cacies of the scale of C.
Meanwhile, Nina worked away at her sum, and finished
it; put away her slate, and went to, the open window,
where she arriyed just in time to se hansom drive up to
the door, and her father jump out of it.
This was rather an unusual event, and Nina felt puzzled
to account for it. It was very seldom that he came home
at this hour. He generally went straight to the park from
his club, and she thought something particular must have
brought him home; which opinion was confirmed by hear-
ing him call out to the footman at the door, in a tone of
unwonted excitement, "Has Mrs:-Middleton come home
from her drive?"
Nina felt very curious to know what could make him in

I 2 THRO WAV 7TOGETHER.
such a hurry, and was just about to lean out of the win-
dow, in order to make herself still further mistress of
what was going on below, when Cecily's music-lesson
came to an end, and, Mademoiselle having betaken her-
self to her bedroom to prepare for tea, the emancipated
captive came running to the window, exclaiming, eagerly,
"Didn't I hear a hansom drive up P"
Nina instantly drew in her head, and came away from
the window. Cecily's childish excitement-over the han-
som made her feel ashamed of her curiosity about it, and
she answered, in an uninterested tone of voice, "Yes; it
was papa."
Nina was a good deal older than her sister by years,
and many years older by disposition and temperament,
for Cecily was childish and backward for her age. More-
over, Nina was a very proud child, and made the most of
the years between them. Cecily was always so over-ex-
cited, and over-interested in everything, that Nina often
felt lowered in her own estimation by being interested in
the things at all.
"Papa I'' exclaimed Cecily; "oh, perhaps he's come
to take us out in the park | What fun what fun l''
And, in spite of the state of the thermometer, Cecily
capered about, and clapped her hands with delight.
These transports were childish, and Nina could not de-
mean herself by joining in them. So she remarked, care-
lessly, that she didn't suppose he had ; he might only
have come to get a pocket-handkerchief, or perhaps to
fetch his cards.
Presently Cecily said, "Here comes mamma in the
carriage, and papa is standing on the door-step, waiting
to speak to her."
Nina's curiosity overcame her pride, and she jumped
up and joined her sister at the window.
## p. 13 (#17) ##############################################
7THE HEROINE'S HOME. I3
The carriage drove up to the door. Colonel Middle-
ton advanced eagerly, and the children heard him say,
"Lydia, it is all settled ! Come into my room and read
Magdalen's letter."
"Oh, Nina, did you hear?" exclaimed Cecily; "it was
about Aunt Magdalen again. There's some secret about
her, I am sure. This is the second or third time papa
and mamma have talked about her to-day. What can it
be?"
Nina answered indifferently that she did not know;
but the expression in her eyes was not so uninterested as
she would have her voice to sound. For her Aunt Mag-
dalen, and her Aunt Magdalen's boy, Mervyn Lyndsay,
were objects of deep interest to her; and she was in-
wardly quite as anxious as Cecily to discover what the
news could be that seemed to have reference to them.
She leaned out of the window still farther, to see what
was going on below; but there was little more to be seen.
Colonel and Mrs. Middleton entered the house, the foot-
man took books and parcels out of the carriage, the
coachman drove round to the stables, and the two little
girls were left wondering, each in her different way, what
it could all mean.
Leaving them in their perplexity, let us descend to the
hall-door; and, going back a few minutes, let us stand
with Colonel Middleton on the door-step, while the car-
riage drives up to the door. 
"Lydia, it is all settled ! Come into my room and
read Magdalen's letter." So saying, Colonel Middleton 
led the way to the smoking-room, and shut the door. "I
am so glad, I can't tell you," he said, as he handed his
wife the letter, and watched her while she read it. "Mag-
dalen deserves to be happy, if any one does; and after
all, in spite of her many years of widowhood, she is still

quite a girl. I can't say how glad I am she has come to
this conclusion." He went on, walking up and down
the room, every now and then glancing at his wife's face
as she went on with the letter. "I was still half afraid
she would not make up her mind to the step, in spite of
my last letter. But it is that that has done it, of course."
And Colonel Middleton continued his walk, in a high
state of self-glorification and excitement.
"A very nice, sensible letter," said Mrs. Middleton.
, "I am, indeed, delighted she should have arrived at
such a wise determination; I suppose one of her reasons
for hesitating was Mervyn. But it would have been
absurd to sacrifice herself for his sake. Besides, he is
getting such a big boy now that it will not make much
difference to him, as he will be going to school."
All this was said in a very decided tone.
"Of course, of course," answered Colonel Middleton,
in the easy way in which people make up their minds for
others, and reconcile themselves to matters that do not
concern them. "He will Who's there? Say not
at home !"
This was spoken sharply, as some one tapped at the
door; for Colonel Middleton was in great excitement
over his news, and he wanted to talk it over with his
wife. Therefore he greatly resented the interruption. It
was too late, however; the door opened, and a gentleman
was announced. Mrs. Middleton went out by another
door, and Colonel Middleton advanced to greet the new
arrival. He was much too full of his subject to talk long
on any other, and at the first pause in the conversation he
introduced it.
"My sister, Mrs. Lyndsay, is going to marry Lord
Wardlaw."
"I am delighted to hear it ! I heard rumors of the
## p. 15 (#19) ##############################################

kind, but, as I was told it was not settled, I did not like
to congratulate you. Mrs. Lyndsay has only one child,
I think?"
"Only one; a boy. It was on his account chiefly that
she hesitated. Her husband died when the boy was a
baby, and mother and son have lived so much alone, and
been thrown so entirely on each other's companionship,
that he has been treated more as a friend and equal than
boys of his age generally are ; and so I suppose she felt a
second marriage was a little hard upon him. Indeed, I
doubt if she would have done it, had it not been that
Mervyn is old enough to go to school. However, we
have just heard from her, telling us it is all settled; and
the marriage will take place almost immediately. Ward-
law is a charming fellow, and he and Magdalen were great
friends in old days; so it is quite a romantic story."
"Ah! that is just what I was told: that there was some
misunderstanding between them in their early days, other-
wise they would have married years ago."
"It hardly amounted to that. Wardlaw was then far
too poor to think of marrying, and he had no prospects,
as he had two elder brothers at that time. But I know
what you are alluding to. They got him appointed to
the Spanish Embassy, when they thought he was falling
in love with Magdalen."
"Whom do you mean by "they'?"
"My father and old Lyndsay, afterwards Magdalen's
husband. Wardlaw was in the diplomatic service, waiting
for an appointment, and was meanwhile in London,
where he was constantly in Magdalen's society. Old
Lyndsay was my father's dearest friend, and was also a
great deal at the house. When he saw how matters were
going on, he came to my father, and asked him if he
wished his daughter to marry a pauper. - My dear old

father, who would never have noticed anything, however
palpable, that was going on right under his eyes, took
fright directly, put himself at once into Lyndsay's hands,
and begged him to help him out of the scrape. Acting
upon his friend's advice, he immediately left town with
my sister, on the plea of feeling ill himself and needing
change of air.
"Meantime Lyndsay, who had interest just then with
the Foreign Office, got Wardlaw this appointment, which
he was too poor to refuse; and he proceeded at once to
Madrid.
"Shortly afterwards my father died, and my sister
found herself alone and penniless, dependent on me,
who had already a wife and several children. It was then
that Lyndsay stepped forward and laid himself and his
fortune at her feet. Hers is a very grateful nature, and
she had received nothing but kindness all her life from
her father's friend.
"During her father's short illness, too, Lyndsay had
been her right hand. All unconscious of the wrong he
had done her, she became his wife."
"Did you know of it?"
"Believe me, no ; or I should not have allowed her to
take such a step without at least opening her eyes."
"Then how do you know it now?" -
"I am coming to that presently. Let me tell my story
my own way. Well, Lyndsay only lived eighteen months
after his marriage."
"Was she happy with him?"
"I believe she was happy enough, but she must have
been very dull. To begin with, a man of fifty cannot be
much of a companion for a girl of nineteen ; and then
they lived almost entirely at Glen-Mervyn, his wild, out-
of-the-way place in Wales. So I saw very little of them.
## p. 17 (#21) ##############################################
THE HERO/WE'S HOME. 17
They came to London to see a doctor for Lyndsay about
eleven months after their marriage. That was the begin-
ning of the illness that ended with his death."
"I wonder why Wardlaw did not come back when he
found she was free."
"You must remember that nothing had passed between
them, and that he had no reason to suppose she cared for
him. Quite the contrary. For almost the first thing he
heard of her after he arrived in Madrid, was the report of
her intended marriage. Also he may have been too proud
to marry her when she was a rich widow, or he may have
resented her marriage, or a hundred things. Anyhow, as
we know, he didn't, and it is only a year ago that, by the
successive deaths of his father and brothers, he became
Lord Wardlaw, with wealth sufficient to enable him to
give up his diplomatic career and to return to England.
"He and Magdalen met again this spring in London.
I must own my wife and I secretly hoped that the old
intimacy might be renewed, and that we might see her
rewarded for her long years of devotion to others. Imagine
our disappointment when she left town at the end of June,
and returned with her boy to Wales. Rumor, however,
was not so silent on the subject as she ; and we soon heard
that she had refused Lord Wardlaw. Upon this I wrote
to her, urging her to reconsider her determination. I
urged her not to throw away such a chance of happiness,
and my wife added her entreaties to mine.
"Magdalen answered both letters in her usual gentle
way, thanking us most gratefully for our interest in her,
but saying at the same time very decidedly that she had
given the matter a great deal of consideration, and that
the conclusion she had arrived at was final.
"As my sister's only relation, I sent for Lord Wardlaw,
and spoke to him on the subject. In the course of our

conversation we referred to the past, and somehow or
other the truth oozed out; and I, for the first time, dis-
covered that both had been victims of a plot between my
father and old Lyndsay. Lord Wardlaw fiimself had
only dimly suspected it till his return to England, and
Mrs. Lyndsay, he said, had evidently no idea who had
got him the appointment, nor why it was done. These
are his own words: "At the time we were mutually hurt
at each other's inexplicable conduct, and both felt we had
been mistaken in supposing ourself cared for. She judged
by my accepting an appointment without telling her, or
coming to wish her good-by ; and I judged by what Mr.
Lyndsay told me, which was that she had begged her
father to take her out of town, as she was tired of London
and its gayeties. I left England in a state of pique, and
the announcement of her intended marriage fell under
my eyes very shortly. It seemed to confirm my original
impression, which was, that in spite of the disparity of
years between them, it was Lyndsay she cared for, and
not me at all. I believe I should have enlightened her
as to all this; but I could not make up my mind to be
the one to lower her son's father in her eyes. Besides,
she might have resented it, and I might have done my
own cause more harm than good. After all, he was her
husband afterwards; and probably in that relation he
behaved himself so as to wipe out any early offenses, and
I should have been sorry to tarnish his memory.'
"After this conversation I wrote again to my sister, lay-
ing the facts of the case plainly before her. I feared that,
besides the difficulty about the step-father, she might be
hampered by some foolish idea of being true to her hus-
band's memory, or something of that sort; and I did not
think it necessary she should be true to the memory of
any one who had used her so ill. Also I saw that in
## p. 19 (#23) ##############################################

withholding from her the truth of the old misunderstand-
ing, Lord Wardlaw was removing one of the strongest
arguments in his own favor. I honored him for his reti-
cence, but was troubled with no such scruples myself.
"I told her exactly how it had all come about, feeling
all the while what a powerful advocate I was, my sister's
sense of justice being so strong. For the answer to this
letter I cannot tell you how anxiously I waited. But here
it is, and a most satisfactory one; for though I cannot
say it is exactly an answer,-for my dear, generous sister
does not make the slightest or most distant allusion to
her husband's conduct, yet she tells me decidedly she
has accepted Lord Wardlaw, and that is all I care about."
Colonel Middleton drew a long breath, and waited to
receive his friend's renewed congratulations. The con-
versation then branched off to other subjects, and shortly
afterwards his friend took his leave, and Colonel Middle-
ton went up into the drawing-room to seek his wife.
He found her surrounded by five-o'clock visitors, and
saw there was not a chance of speaking to her; so, after
talking over his sister's engagement with one or two ladies
who knew her, he strolled out of the room, and bethought
himself of what he would do next. This was his life.
He was always wondering what he would do next.
Rowland Middleton was a man who "hung about" all
day. He had nothing to do. If he had had, he would
not have done it. He was an easy-going, indolent man,
who left everything to other people, and found it answered
very well. He lived on his wife's fortune, and had no
employment of his own. He had sold out of the army
on his marriage, and had ever since congratulated himself
On having done with the trouble and worry of a constantly-
recurring occupation.
He was a kind, good sort of man, not without a certain

degree of cleverness, for he was agreeable and amusing in
society; but there it began and ended, for he never opened
a book or cultivated his mind in any way. But he was
fond of his wife, fond of his children, and had never done
or said an unkind thing in his life.
Such was the man to whom Providence had assigned
the care and responsibility of eight children, five sons
and three daughters.
He had married young a woman older than himself,
and perhaps his wife was a little too much for him. She
was an only child and an heiress, and had always been
accustomed to have her own way, and been spoilt
and made much of She had all the energy, all the
strength of purpose, and all the fortune that he lacked.
The place in Shropshire was hers, the house in London
was hers, and she was capable of managing it all, and of
managing him likewise. He left everything to her; it
saved him trouble, and she liked it. This was particularly
the case with the children. Mrs. Middleton was full of
theories on the subject of education. Her children were
suffering under the reaction that always follows an excess
of any kind. The reaction from despotism is anarchy,
and again from anarchy it will always be despotism, and
so on forever.
Mrs. Middleton, as a child, had been brought up on
the new system of education,-where children are, and
know they are, the chief objects in the house; are always
in their parents' society, and join as they please in every
conversation. Mrs. Middleton as a mother had reverted
to the system on which her parents had been educated,
and brought up her children strictly, assigning to them
their school-rooms and their nurseries as their places of
abode, and only admitting them to their parents' society
at stated times. No child of Mrs. Middleton's ever

strolled into the drawing-room at promiscuous hours.
There was never any danger of the door opening slowly,
and a small head protruding itself somewhere below the
handle of the door, while the owner of the head delivered
itself of some little remark invented as an excuse for get-
ting into her society. But, as Nina Middleton is the
heroine of this story, we shall hear more of Mrs. Middle-
ton's system and its results hereafter, and so need not
animadvert upon it now, except in so far as it affected
her husband, of whom we were speaking.
He had never been encouraged to break in upon his
children's lesson-hours, either by paying them visits in the
school-room or by taking them out walking with him.
By degrees he had ceased to expect much companion-
ship in his children after their school-room life had fairly
begun, especially since his three eldest boys had gone to
school, and the school-room party consisted of the two
little girls of whom this story has already spoken. It
always seemed to him that it was too early or too late when
he wanted to send for them. They had either just begun
their lessons or just sat down to their tea. So he contented
himself with playing with the little ones in the nursery,
and seeing the others at stated times, i.e. luncheon,
and for a few minutes before dressing for dinner. That is,
if he felt inclined. He was not a man who would give up
a pleasanter engagement for the sake of being with his
children. And so it often happened that if he was out
at luncheon, or late in dressing for dinner, he and his
little girls did not meet all day. Sometimesbut this was
very rarelyhe would take them for a walk; and on the
hope of this walk the sanguine Cecily lived from day to
day.
Mrs. Middleton always had the school-room party down
to luncheon. It was the exception she made to the rules
## p. 22 (#26) ##############################################
22 THrowy TogetHER.
of the old system. She considered it a good thing, lest
the children should grow shy in their manners or awkward
in their ways.
These London luncheons were a great penance to the
little girls. Their shut-up school-room life made them
shy and sensitive, and their parents' ways with them
during that meal were not calculated to help them, dia-
metrically opposed as those ways were. For their mother
never lost an opportunity of finding fault with them and
pointing out their failings, no matter who was there;
while Colonel Middleton's way of noticing them was
by a kind of fatherly teasing, which, highly amusing to
him, was a great though unexpressed terror to them,
for they never knew what he was going to say next. It
was often convenient to him to be "funny" at their
expense, but the wit which made him a favorite in society
was a constant source of dread to his little daughters.
Still, they were very fond of him; indeed, there could be
no doubt that if the question elder girls are so fond of
putting to their youngers, "Which do you like best, your
papa or your mamma?" had been put to the little Mid-
dletons, the answer would have been very decidedly in
Colonel Middleton's favor.
He never scolded them, or interfered with them in any
way; he left all that to his wife. As long as they were
nicely dressed and looked pleased to see him, that was all
he cared for. They were pretty little girls, and he was
proud of them, and quite satisfied with them. He didn't
bother his head about their characters, or listen much
when his wife complained of Nina's being "an odd child"
and Cecily "very childish and backward." Neither was
he at all concerned when told that the governesses said
Nina was proud and obstinate and Cecily lazy and inat-
tentive. "Children must be naughty sometimes," he

said, "and it was quite right they should show it in the
School-room, and keep their good behavior for down-
stairs." -
Taking his wife's tone, he called Nina "a queer
customer," but he himself seldom saw anything in her to
justify his saying so. He noticed certainly that she often
flushed angrily and tossed her head at luncheon when her
mother found fault with her, but this he rather admired;
he thought it showed she had "a spirit of her own," and
he liked it : it became her so well. He had an idea some-
times that she took things rather too strongly. He thought
it a pity; he always took things so easy himself; but he
supposed she would find out her mistake as life went on.
Nina was what is called "an odd child." She was
silent and reserved, singularly undemonstrative, and
rather obstinate and self-willed. The nurses called her
"haughty," and the governesses called her "cold." Her
mother never professed to understand her, and often
expressed it as her opinion that she would grow up a very
disagreeable woman. But her father, though he could not
get her to chatter to him as Cecily did, did not discover
all this in her, or think of her otherwise than as rather a
character. He was proud of her beauty, pleased that he
could discover in her face a strong likeness to his sister.
Also she was his first daughter, the three eldest being
boys. With Cecily, his younger girl, he was certainly
more at his ease, but he had not the same pride in her.
She was a winning little thing, very shy and timid; but
when alone with him, away from her mother's dreaded eye,
and relieved from the fear of his joking her in company,
she would chatter to him as freely as possible. He teased
her a great deal; he couldn't help it. She was just the
sort of child to be teased, because she was always so affected
by it. Her tears came so readily that her mother called

her a cry-baby. This was a very sore point with poor
little Cecily. Her father sometimes converted her name
into "Silly-ly," or "Silly-Billy," and the fear that he
would do so at luncheon before visitors kept the child
in a constant state of anxiety during that meal.
When her school-boy brothers were at home, poor
Cecily had a sad time of it. But it was her father's re-
fined teasing that she dreaded most. If there was a goose
at luncheon, she knew as well as possible that, before the
carving-knife was plunged in, he would turn to her and
say, "Drop a tear for your brother." Then if, when she
thought him too busily engaged in carving to notice her,
she surreptitiously said "Yes" to the servant when he
brought her some, her father would be sure to look up
and say, "Eating your own brother, unnatural Silly-
Billy l'" If any one could have known how the child
dreaded Michaelmas-Day !
"Why do you eat goose, then?" asked Nina, con-
temptuously, one day, when Cecily had been dismissed
in tears from the dining-room, because, as her mother
said, she couldn't take a joke; "if you didn't eat it, there
wouldn't be such a talk about it. It's every Michaelmas-
Day the same thing."
"It's the apple-sauce '' sobbed Cecily.
Sometimes the simple child would be caught unsus-
pectingly.
"Did I hear you singing this morning, Cecily?"
"Me singing? No, papa."
"What was that noise, then, in the garden, under my
window P''
"Noise, papa? I didn't hear anything. Oh, yes, the
old donkey brayed,that was all."
"Exactly; I thought it was one of your relations; I
knew I could not mistake the family voice."

7THE HEA'OAAWE'S HOA/A2. 25
As we began by saying, his little girls were very fond
of him all the same, Cecily especially.
They were always glad when he did manage to call
them at the right time, or take them out walking with
him, the latter above all. It relieved the dullness of
their school-room life, and was a great pleasure to them;
and at this very moment, while he is debating in his own
mind what he will do next, they are both bolting their
bread-and-butter as fast as they can, in case he should
take them out in the park.
They have been, as we know, on the qui vive ever since
they heard his hansom drive up to the door, wondering
what has brought him home. For, like all children, Nina
and Cecily Middleton were very much taken up with the
affairs of their elders, and were always putting two and
two together, after the fashion of those who are kept in
the dark. Perhaps, from the state of repression in which
they lived, they did it more than most children; but it is
more generally done than parents have any idea of And
so it was, that from a few words dropped lately at lun-
cheon, and other ways too insignificant to convey any
idea except to already sharpened comprehensions, these
two young creatures, who lived such a shut-up school-
room life that they were not supposed to know of any-
thing that went on outside its walls, not only knew that
there was a secret, but were perfectly aware that it con-
cerned their Aunt Magdalen and their Cousin Mervyn.
To return to Colonel Middleton. With the strange
contradiction which we often find in a character, this
man, who never took the trouble to manage his own
affairs, was very fond of managing other people's ; and
he had always turned his attention very much to those of
his only sister, the Mrs. Lyndsay whose intended second
marriage was causing him such untold satisfaction. To

begin with, his sister was a great deal younger than him-
self, so that he had always been accustomed to look upon
her as a child. And then she had been left a widow when
she was so very young. Moreover, she had been left with
an only son, heir to a large property; and any one who
heard Colonel Middleton descant on the sad position of a
woman thus left without the help of a husband's advice,
guidance, and control, would never have supposed that
his own wife dispensed with all three and got on very
well without them. When his sister was in town, he would
bestow many of his idle hours upon her, sitting with her,
discoursing on the management of property and the edu-
cation of children, of both which subjects she knew him
to be profoundly ignorant. But she did what was the
kindest and wisest thing to do, listened patiently, and
was grateful for his interest in her and in her boy, and
went her own way, doing what her own right-mindedness
and good sense told her was best; and he, misled by her
gentleness and courtesy, would go away puffed up with
the importance of having directed her for her good, and
would be very long before he discovered that, after all,
his advice had not been taken. He was always urging her
to send her boy to school, even before the poor little
fellow was out of petticoats; yet Mervyn Lyndsay was
now a well-grown boy in jacket and trousers, and it was
only now and then that it flashed across Colonel Middle-
ton that his nephew was still at home.
It was, however, not entirely for the sake of giving ad-
vice to his sister that Colonel Middleton was so often to
be found sitting in her drawing-room when she was in
town. He was really fond of her, and there was some-
thing about her house and surroundings that he did not
find in his own. There was a sense of calm and repose
about her which he could not define, and a charm in her

7 HE AWAZA'OZAVE".S HOME. 27
society and conversation which always attracted him.
Everything in her house went on smoothly; there were
no jars. At home, though the children were kept so strict,
and there were so many rules and regulations, there was
always a noise and a bustle. The fact was, there was no
repose about Mrs. Middleton. She was always scolding
a servant, or a tradesman, or a child. She never sat in
one place long; was always bustling in and out of the
room, or going up and down stairs; always writing notes,
sending messages, or receiving parcels. Though she had
nothing to do with the children's lessons, and only nomi-
nally presided over the household and kitchen, yet she
always seemed too busy to speak to him.
Magdalen, though she taught her boy herself, superin-
tended the household, and was in constant correspondence
with steward, bailiff, etc., seemed always to have leisure
to attend to him, and a clear head, and unfeigned interest
in what he was saying.
Mrs. Middleton, as we have said before, never had a
child in the room except at stated times. "Occupation
would be impossible if she did," she said.
He always found Magdalen with her little boy with her,
either astride on her lap while she read to him, or, if she
was too busy to attend to him, driving a tandem of chairs
by himself in the corner while she transacted her business.
Neither could he complain that the child was in the
way; for if Mrs. Lyndsay fancied her brother wanted to
speak to her alone, she always sent the boy away. And
at her gentle word of dismissal, Mervyn always went up
to the nursery without a murmur.
Colonel Middleton himself was always the first to
object to such a measure; he was very fond of the boy.
He was such a handsome, merry little fellow, and so
manly and independent; and yet he had such engaging
## p. 28 (#32) ##############################################
28 7THA'O IVAV 7'OGAE 7A/EA'.
manners, and such pretty caressing ways. There had
always been something very attractive about the child
ever since he was quite a baby. Colonel Middleton had
often been puzzled to think why this child's demeanor
was so different from that of his own children. Even the
way he came into the room was so different from the shy,
bored manner in which his children presented them-
selves. This little fellow always came bounding in, so
sure of a welcome, so certain that his appearance in the
room was just as great a pleasure to others as it was to
himself; so happy to come, so convinced that every one
was happy to see him. His was the fearless confidence
of one who had never known anything but love all his
life, and expected it from everything and everybody.
Colonel Middleton liked to watch him at his games, too;
to see how completely he was engrossed in his imaginary
tandem or four-in-hand. It was so clear that to him the
chairs were unmanageable, refractory horses; that the stool
on the top of the sofa was a high coach-box; and that the
ribbon he had taken off his mother's neck, and the bit
of string tied to the paper-knife, did really form as good
and as efficacious a pair of reins and a horse-whip as the
best saddle-shop in London could produce Perhaps they
did ; since things are not so much as they are, as as we
see them. The leader was always frisky; and Colonel
Middleton could not but envy the power of imagination
with which children are gifted, when little Mervyn
would say, earnestly, looking at the inanimate, motionless
chair,
"He kicks deerly, doesn't he 7 but you needn't be
fightened, Uncle Rowley, 'cause I'll hold him."
Mervyn got his share of teasing as well as his little
cousins. Colonel Middleton was always teasing him about
Wales, and the child was passionately fond of his home,

-
He called him "Taffy," and would sing, directly he came
into the room,
Taffy was a Welshman.
Taffy was a thief.
His own little Cecily would have swam away in her tears
at once; but Mervyn, before he was four years old, had
learned to retaliate by calling him "Uncle Roley-poley,"
and would retort upon his rhymes by a vigorous
Rowley-poley, gammon and spinach,
Heigh-ho, says Uncle Rowley.
Of course all this was some time before our story opens.
As we said before, Mervyn was now a well-grown boy in
jacket and trousers; but the liking for the boy remained
in Colonel Middleton, and he still was aware of the differ-
ence between him and his own children, though he could
not define what it was. At the same time, he never had
thought, and did not now think, of comparing his wife's
system of education with his sister's; he always felt so
sure the former must be right. Besides, he was much too
lazy ever to take matters into his own hands. "To take
things as they are, and make the best of them," had ever
been the practice of his life; and also he was well aware
that what could be done with an only child could not be
done in the case of a large family. He would have been
the first to complain if the children came too forward, or
were the least in the way. He liked their society when
he felt inclined for it; but he by no means liked the
trouble of children; and it happened constantly in the
season that he was so busy amusing himself that two or
three days would elapse without his coming to speech
with his little school-room girls.

We left him just now, thinking what he would do next.
It occurred to him, as he stood on the stairs debating, that
his little daughters would have finished their lessons, and
that, as he had a stray hour, he might as well take them
out as do anything else. So he ran up-stairs, turned down
the passage to the school-room, and gave a long low
whistle. There was no answer at first, and he repeated it
several times. Presently a door at the end of the passage
opened, and a little voice said, -
"Is that the Bully that keeps on whistling?"
"No, Silly-Billy, it's me. Come here !"
Cecily ran up to him, joyfully whispering, "Take us
out in the park, papa, please do."
"What will mamma and Mademoiselle say?"
"Oh, Mademoiselle won't mind. She's got migraine,
she says; or perhaps it's coup-de-vent, she thinks, as she's
been rather sick."
Colonel Middleton thought Mademoiselle must be clever
to get coup-de-vent on so sultry a lay, and also that sick-
ness was not generally part of the complaint.
"Why, there's not a breath of wind anywhere," he
said. 
"Cecily means coup-de-soleil," said Nina, appearing at
the door.
This was much more comprehensible; and Colonel
Middleton sent a very civil message to Mademoiselle, to
the effect that if she would like to lie down and rest, he
would relieve her of her pupils, and take them out for a
walk.
"But make yourselves very smart," he said, as he left
them; "I can't walk with little Cinderellas."
"Sundays, then, I suppose?" said Cecily.
"Sundays?" repeated Colonel Middleton, rather mys-
tified.

"I mean frocks and hats," she answered.
"Frocks and hats?" he questioned, still more bewil-
dered; "what does she mean, Nina?"
"She means are we to put on our Sunday things; our
best things, you know," explained Nina.
"Oh, I see | Yes, your best clothes, certainly; and
come into the smoking-room when you are ready."
They joined him in about ten minutes, looking as neat
and pretty as any father could desire; and he got up and
put on his hat.

"WHERE shall we go?" he said, as he shut the hall-
door.
"Oh ! the park, papa,please," said Cecily.
"What makes you so fond of the park?"
"Oh, it's such fun, papa I like seeing all the people
riding, and passing the people that you know, and seeing
you take off your hat, or hold up your umbrella."
"Hold up my umbrella?"
"Yes. When you see a lady, you always take your hat
off; but when you see a gentleman that you know, you
hold up your umbrella; at least, if he's riding you do.
If he's walking, you hold up two fingers, and say, "How
are you?' Nina and I always call them papa's "how-
are-yous.' We meet them sometimes in the streets or
squares when we're walking with Mademoiselle, and then
we always say to each other, "How are you?' Don't
we, Nina?"

But Nina was looking at a perambulator in the distance,
and didn't answer. Cecily, not at all discomfited, went
chattering on.
"Mademoiselle always takes us into Berkeley Square or
Kensington Gardens, where there are no "how-are-yous'
or anything to look at. It's very dull."
"But don't you play games in the square P I remem-
ber thinking games in Berkeley Square very good fun
when I was a child."
"Ah, but then you were a boy, and we're girls, you
see. We mayn't play with boys, and the games in Berke-
ley Square are for boys and girls. It's a great bore not
being able to play with boys; I like them much better
than girls. I wish you would ask mamma to let us, papa.
Will you?"
Colonel Middleton felt he was getting himself into a
mess, and, to gain time for reflection, he said, "So you
never play with boys P"
"No, hardly ever. There's only one boy we may play
with, and he's gone now."
"Who's that P'' asked Colonel Middleton.
"Oh, that's Mervyn," said Cecily.
At this moment Nina, who had been lingering behind,
kissing her hand to the perambulator she had been watch-
ing, came running up.
"What were you looking at P" asked her father.
Nina pointed to a perambulator which was crossing the
road, in which he recognized his two youngest children.
"Going home to bed, I suppose," he said, turning
round and shaking his stick at them. The nurses were
seen making frantic attempts to induce the children to
see and return their father's salutation ; but the little
occupants of the perambulator looked in every direction
but the right one. The eldest kissed his hand in the

direction of the sky, and the other maintained a stolid
indifference to everything and everybody.
"So you play with Mervyn P" resumed Colonel Mid-
dleton, as they walked on ; and he was silent for some
time after, his thoughts wandering off to Mervyn. He
wondered how the boy would take the news of his moth-
er's intended marriage. "Do children in general object
to step-fathers and step-mothers?" he asked himself.
"Why should they object to the former?" He thought
perhaps his little girls might be able to throw some light
upon the subject; and, never for a moment dreaming that
they would be able to follow the course of his thoughts,
he asked, abruptly, "How should you feel if any one
were to tell you you were going to have a papa?"
Nina saw the drift of the question in a moment, and
flushed indignant scarlet up to the eyes. The more simple
Cecily was quite innocent of his meaning, and answered
directly, "Going to have a papal Why, we've got one."
"Ah ! to be sure, so you have, I forgot," said Colonel
Middleton, rather puzzled at seeing the case was not quite
analogous. "But I mean, supposing you were told you
were going to have a new one?"
"Two papas 1" exclaimed Cecily; "why, we couldn't
have two, could we ?"
"No, no, I don't quite mean that. Supposing you'd
never had one No ; bother how is it? Supposing
you had had one, and he was dead, how should you feel
if you were told you were going to have another?"
"I should be crying so about the dead one that I
shouldn't be able to see the new one," said the tender-
hearted Cecily, looking very much as if she were going
to begin at once.
Colonel Middleton got a little afraid of a scene in the
street. He took her hand, and tried to laugh her out of it.

"How can I put it?" he mentally questioned. "Look
here," he said; "supposing you couldn't remember your
own papa, how should you feel if you were told you were
going to have another?"
"Why, that would be like Mervyn," answered Cecily;
"he can't remember his papa."
"Exactly," said Colonel Middleton, eagerly. "Well,
how would Mervyn feel?" -
But before Cecily could answer, Nina burst in : "How
would he feel? angry, miserable ! He would never look
at him, or speak to him; no more would I, if I were
Mervyn !" -
"Whew I'' whistled Colonel Middleton. " This was
altogether a bad lookout. He walked on silently for
some time, feeling, as he had once or twice felt before,
when in conversation with his eldest daughter, that she
was a little too much for him.
This easy-going man had occasionally been made rather
uncomfortable by a look in her eyes, and by the sense
that she altogether took things much more strongly than
he did. He wondered now why she had suddenly got so
hot about his question, and glanced curiously now and
then, as they walked on, at the handsome little face by
his side, still flushed with the eagerness with which she
had spoken. He turned to the more shallow Cecily, and
changed the conversation.
While they two chatted away, Nina walked along in a
perfect storm of indignation. She had, of course, in her
usual way, put two and two together, and saw how it all
was as clearly as possible. Sympathy for Mervyn and
hatred to the imaginary step-father were the two promi-
nent feelings in her heart. She was very fond of her
cousin, and had a great admiration for his character,
differing though it did so entirely from her own. Per-
## p. 35 (#39) ##############################################
CHILDREA's LIVES IN THE Lowdow SEAsow. 35
haps that was why she admired it. Their natures were
diametrically opposed, their way of life utterly different;
and yet these two children had a fascination the one for
the other; so that though Nina could little understand
his open unreserve, his demonstrative ways with his
mother, and his entire freedom from the sensitive pride
by which she was herself eaten up, yet she could sympa-
thize very strongly with him. As she thought of the way
in which his life was bound-up in his mother's, of the way
in which he watched over and attended to her, and seemed
always to prefer her society to any other, how they sat
together, walked together, rode together, and then pic-
tured to herself an old ogre of a step-father coming in
between them and marring it all, she quite stamped her
foot upon the ground, and grew hot all over in her sym-
pathetic indignation. He would interfere with Mervyn;
he would perhaps keep him all day in a school-room, as
she herself was kept, shut out altogether from his mother's
society; he would even perhaps separate him entirely from
her, and send him to school. -
The crack of the little heel upon the pavement would
almost have been audible to her father's ears had he not
at that moment been stopped by a passing "How are
you?"
Colonel Middleton drew his friend on one side, so that
the children should not overhear the conversation ; but
Nina was quite able to understand that her father was
being congratulated on her aunt's marriage, and, as the
friend moved on, she caught the words, "Wardlaw is
such a charming fellow."
"Wardlaw " she muttered to herself; "such a name,
too ! I'll never call him Uncle Wardlaw, that I'm quite

ing opposite Stanhope Gate, waiting for an opportunity
to cross over into the park.
As they stood there, an omnibus passed, loaded inside
and out with passengers. Little Cecily's eyes wandered
all over it, amused to see how covered it was with human
beings. Colonel Middleton was just going to tell her not
to stare up at the omnibus, when, to his horror, he saw
her face light up with excitement and recognition. She
smiled and nodded repeatedly, and a man, sitting on the
top of the omnibus, made her a hesitating but very respect-
ful bow.
"Cecily," he exclaimed, angrily, "what on earth are
you about?"
"Didn't you see him, papa?" she answered, still so
excited at the occurrence that she did not notice her
father's tone; "and how smart he was I never saw
him so smart before. I think he must have been at the
Crystal Palace. I suppose it was because he was so smart
that you didn't know him again."
"What are you talking about?" said Colonel Middle-
ton, not at all mollified by this explanation. "How
should I or you know a low fellow on the top of an
omnibus P''
"Papa," she exclaimed, reproachfully, "it was the
clock-man l''
At this moment the policeman made a sign that the
road was clear, and they were obliged to cross, so that
Cecily's lecture was postponed for a time; but as soon
as they got into the park, he said, gravely, "Now remem-
ber, Cecily, never on any consideration nod to any one
on the top of an omnibus. Young ladies do not do these
kind of things. Your mamma would be horrified if she
heard of it. Do you hear me?"
"But, papa," persisted Cecily, "he was our own clock-

man, who winds up the school-room clock every Saturday;
and as it's a half holiday, and Mademoiselle in her room,
I always have a nice little talk with him, and he is so kind
and amusing. So how could I not nod to him when I see
him in the streets P''
All this was said in a most plaintive voice, and she
looked up to her father imploringly, adding, "He is the
micest clock-man, and he does make the school-room clock
go so well."
When she first began to speak, Colonel Middleton had
been making up his mind not to see a lady who was ap-
proaching, whom he remembered once meeting at a croquet-
party in his own neighborhood in the country, and who
he saw was trying to bow to him; but the look in Cecily's
innocent eyes, as she asked him how she could ignore her
school-room friend when she met him in the street, made
him feel rather ashamed of his intention. He felt rebuked
by the child's wondering gaze, and made the lady in ques-
tion a very cordial bow as she passed. Lucky for him
that he did so; for the moment she was gone Cecily recog-
nized her, with all the astonishment and excitement which
children feel at seeing a country friend in London. They
always seem to think it so extraordinary that any one
whom they are accustomed to see only among fields and
hedges should be walking in the park like any other
person.
"Why, that is the lady that stays sometimes with Mrs.
Stapleton | Oh, papa, what a pity you didn't stop and
speak to her Why didn't you stop?"
"My dear, I don't know that I had anything to say to
her.''
"Oh, I could have thought of such lots of things |

ant, and the guinea-pigs, and so much besides. May I
run after her and call her back to speak to you?"
But somehow Colonel Middleton did not feel that lively
interest in his neighbor's belongings that Cecily seemed to
take it for granted he should, and he positively refused to
allow any advances of the kind to be made. The lady, he
said, was enjoying her walk, and he insisted that she
should be allowed to pursue her way unmolested.
Directly after, they came to another stop. A tall, fair
man hailed Colonel Middleton with an appearance of
great pleasure, which feeling seemed reciprocated. Cecily
saw they were likely to talk some time, so she strayed a
little from the group, and leaned against the railing, in
imitation of some gentlemen she saw doing so, to their
great amusement; but Nina, attracted by something in
the new-comer's face, stood watching him as he conversed
with her father. He laughed very often, and it was such
a ringing, pleasant laugh that she caught herself once or
twice laughing too; it sounded so very cheery. She felt
quite glad when she heard her father ask him to luncheon
the next day, and hoped they would continue talking
some time, so much did she like watching the pleasant
face. -
Presently she caught his eye, and he came forward,
smiling kindly, and shook hands with her, saying, "This
is one of your little girls, I am sure," and asked her her
name. She fancied he looked a little disappointed at her
answer, but he said nothing, and resumed his conversation
with her father.
He seemed very amusing, for Colonel Middleton laughed
almost as much as he. As he talked, Nina could not help
noticing how often he glanced at her, and always with an
expression of interest. At last he said good-by, shaking
hands cordially with Colonel Middleton, and taking off

his hat with a smile to Nina, which pleased her very much,
though it made her feel rather shy.
"Come along," said her father. "Where's Cecily?"
Cecily was engaged in trying to copy the attitude of
one of the gentlemen she had been watching. She was
standing with her back to the railings, and trying to get
her elbows on the top, that she might support herself by
them, as he was doing. But, being many inches too short,
the experiment proved a failure, and, being called to order
by Colonel Middleton, she gave it up, and joined him and
her sister.
Nina longed to know who the stranger was, but for that
very reason could not make up her mind to ask.
Cecily saved her the trouble.
"Papa," she said, "who is that gentleman?"
"Well, dear,'' he answered, in as indifferent a man-
ner as he could assume, "I don't know that you will
be much the wiser if I tell you. His name is Lord
Wardlaw."
Nina took a step backward, in her astonishment.

went a sudden change. The interfering old ogre disap-
peared, and she began to think she did not pity Mervyn
so very much, after all.
"I shall call him Uncle Wardlaw," she settled in her
own mind.
"We must be going home," said Colonel Middleton,
looking at his watch.
"Home?" said Cecily, regretfully; "back to the dull
old school-room, away from the four-in-hands, and all the
fun. Oh, dear! what a pity!"
"Well, I am going to do a little shopping first," said

her father, "so I shall not go home straight, and perhaps
I'll take you back in a hansom."
This made up for everything. Cecily's idea of the
height of bliss began and ended in a hansom, and she
became as eager to leave the park as she had been to come
into it. They turned out at Albert Gate.
"What sort of shop, papa?" she said, eagerly.
"That one," he said, pointing to the flower-shop op-
posite. "I want to get a flower for my coat."
"Oh, dear! that's rather dull !" said Cecily, in a disap-
pointed tone, for her mind had been running on straw-
berries and cream. " Gunter's is close by, papal'' she
added, wistfully.
"Too late for ices to-night," he answered, as he opened
the shop-door; "but another time, perhaps."
Cecily was quite satisfied, but Nina knew well enough
what her father's promises were worth. Perhaps her
penetration had long ago discovered how completely life
was with him the fancy of the moment; and she knew it
was very likely he would not even remember to take them
another walk all the season.
"Choose me a flower, children," he said, turning to
them. Cecily immediately produced an enormous peony,
to the great amusement of the shopman, and somewhat to
the annoyance of Colonel Middleton, who did not like
being made, even in the slightest way, to look ridiculous.
"Ah, that is something like l'' he said, taking the
spotless yellow rose-bud which his eldest daughter silently
handed him.
They called a hansom outside, and Cecily jumped in
with great delight. She sat bodkin, so she had a capital
view of everything 'all down Piccadilly, and indulged in
little bows to the passers-by every now and then, unknown
to her father, who was not looking her way.

She threw open the doors with a great clatter when
they stopped, and tried to jump out on to the pavement,
as she had so often admiringly watched her father do
from the school-room window.
But, her legs not being long enough for the operation,
she fell short of the curbstone, and splashed into a puddle
lately deposited by a friendly water-cart.
"Really, Cecily, you are too clumsy for anything
said her father. "Look at your boots l''
Cecily looked in dismay, and made the best of her
way up-stairs, in great fear of meeting her mother.
Nina went up to her father and wished him good-night.
"What I sha'n't I see you again?"
"No, papa, there is a dinner-party to-night."
"Good gracious ! so there is. I quite forgot. I'm
afraid I shall be late." And, hastily kissing her, he ran off
to his dressing-room.
Nina went up to the school-room, and found it was half-
past seven.
Mademoiselle informed her that her mother had been
to the school-room to wish them good-night, not knowing
they were out with their father; and that she had left a
message to say that she was sorry to miss them, and that
she "hoped they would work hard at their lessons to-
morrow after such a treat as a walk in the park."
Nina received the information and the message with a
sort of haughty indifference, and went up-stairs to take
off her things. Cecily was in full talk.
"Nina, there's such lots of people coming to dinner
to-night; do let's come to the school-room window and
see them arrive."
This was a favorite pastime generally with both ; but
to-night Nina's head was full of her boy cousin, and she
did not feel much interest in it.

"Oh, Nina, we'll go to the top of the stairs, and see
them all go down to dinner. I've found a better place
than ever to see from, where there's plenty of room for
two."
When they returned to the school-room it was only a
quarter to eight, and therefore too soon for any arrivals.
Nina instantly took a book, and sat down upon the floor
with it. -
Cecily, who had already stationed herself at the window,
was in despair. -
"Oh, Nina, don't read I know, if you once begin,
you'll never leave off to look at the people."
"Yes, I did," said Nina, absently; for she was already
deep in her book, and hardly heard what her sister was
saying. "I canI mean I shouldI shall."
"Oh, you're not attending a bit !" said Cecily, despair-
ingly ; "you're thinking about that stupid book, and here
comes the first carriage and everything. I wish there were
no books in the world, that I do ! Yes, it's stopping
it's stopped at the dooryes 1 and they've let down the
steps, and out comes such a smart lady; lots of diamonds !
Now her husband is telling the footman what time the
carriage is to come, and then he goes into the house.
No 1 his wife turns round, and tells him she's forgotten
something. I wonder if it's her gloves, or her fan, or
what. Perhaps it's a present for mamma. Such a hunt
they're having in the carriage, but they can't find it. Ah!
now the footman has picked it up on the step. Oh it's
only her pocket-handkerchief; how dull ! Now they've
both gone in. Oh, here comes another carriage Nina,
do come !" But all these remarks were lost upon Nina,
who was now buried in her book.
Mademoiselle, taking pity on the eager Cecily, and,
moreover, a little excited herself, joined her at the
## p. 43 (#47) ##############################################
CHILDA: EA's L/VEs IV THE Lowdow SEAsov. 43
window, and entered with spirit into the entertain-
Iment.
Cecily's flow of chatter went on increasing in excite-
ment as more guests arrived, reaching Nina faintly in
little shrieks (for Cecily's head was half out of the win-
dow), mingled with Mademoiselle's occasional remarks,
"Ah! quelle belle toilette Mais vraiment Combien
c'est comme il faut ! Regardez donc que cette dame
est bien mise ! Quelle charmante coiffure I''
"A hansom A hansom 1 and a "how-are-you' in
it," exclaimed Cecily, drawing in her head. "Nina, I
do believe it's the same we met in the park 1"
Down went Nina's book, and she was at her sister's side
in a moment. She was only just in time to see a tall man
pay his cab and run up the steps. But she was disap-
pointed, for it was not Lord Wardlaw, nor any one the least
like him.
"How could you say it was the one we saw in the park,
Cecily? He was tall and fair, and this man has got nasty
dark hair, quite black and oily. Faugh 1" And Nina
made a gesture of disgust.
Cecily took it up rather warmly. "Dark hair isn't
nasty a bit, and I'm sure he's a very nice man. He spoke
so kindly to the cabman when he stopped next door by
mistake, and didn't halloo and shout at him like some
people would, and call him a fool."
"Ccile, Ccile," said Mademoiselle, reprovingly, catch-
ing only the last word, "taisez-vous doncl"
Thus rebuked, Cecily turned again to the window,
muttering, as she did so, "Besides, the fair man isn't the
only "how-are-you' in the world."
But to Nina just now he was, for her thoughts were full
of Mervyn, and she wanted to know more of the man
who was to bring such a change into his life. So she

made no objection when Cecily presently suggested that
it was time they should go and establish themselves on the
staircase, for she wanted to satisfy herself whether Lord
Wardlaw was of the party or not.
Mademoiselle agreed to the plan on condition that
they would promise not to make a noise nor let them-
selves be seen, and also that they would return very soon,
as it was time for Cecily to go to bed. She herself re-
mained behind to have her supper. Her head, she said,
was still bad, and it was probable she should retire early."
The two little girls wished her good-night, and ran down-
stairs, settling themselves in a corner where they could
see without being seen.
The drawing-room doors were open, and they could
hear a faint buzz of conversation every now and then rise
and die away almost directly, to begin again in another
part of the room, with the same melancholy result. Their
mother's clear, decided tones rose above the rest every
now and then, as if she were making an effort to suggest
topics which might furnish some sort of spasmodic con-
versation to cheer the gloomy interval between the arrival
of the guests and the announcement of dinner. At last
the butler came up the stairs and went into the drawing-
room.
There was a moment of greater silence than ever, and
then, with a rush and a roar, conversation sprang up.
Then came the rustling of gowns and the tramp of many
feet, the sound of many voices, and mingled laughter,
getting nearer and nearer to the children as the party
streamed out on the landing and passed down the
stairs.
It seemed as if each man had for many weeks kept
pent up within him a certain conversation he wished to
hold with the particular lady who was consigned to him
## p. 45 (#49) ##############################################

to take down to dinner, and that now, at last, the op-
portunity had come.
Nina and Cecily felt quite deafened by the torrent of
words which swept past them. "What chatter-boxes!"
muttered Cecily; but she was called to order by a frown
from her elder sister.
First came their father, good-looking, cheerful, and
witty, evoking light, rippling laughter from the pretty
woman on his arm, while his attention was divided be-
tween her and Nina's yellow rose-bud, which he was re-
arranging in his button-hole. Then, two and two, came
the guests, strangers to the children mostly, though they
sometimes recognized faces they knew in open carriages,
and an occasional "how-are-you;" but Nina looked in
vain for Lord Wardlaw. Last of all, on the arm of some
foreign prince, erect, well dressed, and self-dependent,
came the children's mother.
Clear and loud were her tones as she discoursed with
him in his own language, every word of which was intel-
ligible to her eldest daughter. Any close observer would
have seen Nina shrink into herself a little as her mother
swept out upon the landing, as if there was something in
that mother's appearance and manner which jarred a little
upon the child's sensitive organization,-nay, more, as
if her very presence excited some curious feeling within
her; for her cheeks flushed a little, and her eyes fell,
while into the corners of the tightly-compressed little
mouth crept an expression which was not fear, nor dis-
like, nor contempt, but which partook a little of all three,
and was gone before one could be certain it had been
there at all, changing into keen interest and excitement
as her mother's words reached her. "So you knew Lord
Wardlaw abroad, and think my sister-in-law a very lucky
person P So do I Yes, there is a boy; but, of

course, he will go to school, and " Here the decided
tones died away in the distance, and were lost in the
hum of voices which now proceeded from the dining-
room.
Had Nina followed the company down-stairs, she would
have heard plenty about Lord Wardlaw; for during the
two first courses he and his marriage, and his previous
history, formed the chief subjects of conversation. There
was but one opinion as to himself. He was charming.
The verdict was unanimous. Opinions as to whether Lord
Wardlaw or Mrs. Lyndsay was the "lucky one" were a
little divided. Some thought the luck on his side, in
possessing such a pretty, charming wife as Colonel Mid-
dleton's sister. Others, sitting a good way from Colonel
Middleton, thought it on hers. A young man like Lord
Wardlaw, with a fair fortune,who might have married
any of the pretty London girls of the day, had he been
so disposed. Others aside, to each other, thought a rich
widow a great windfall. Others again, still aside, thought
the boy a terrible stumbling-block. Some rejoiced at the
constancy of affection displayed by Lord Wardlaw. "That
sort of thing is so rare in these days." Colonel Middle-
ton told the whole story of the early friendship from his
end of the table, while his wife told it from hers. By
degrees, the conversation branched off to other subjects,
with which we have nothing to do. So now, while the
champagne goes round, and the clatter of voices and
laughter sounds up the staircase, let us return to the school-
room, and follow the young lives there.
It is nearly nine o'clock, and Cecily has gone to bed.
Mademoiselle, still suffering from her headache, has also
retired, and in the rapidly darkening school-room Nina
sits alone. She has been reading by the fading light, and
the book is still open in her hand; but now she is leaning

against the window-sill, looking out into the street. It is
an oppressive night, and both the windows are wide open.
Not much to be seen of interest there: an organ below is
playing a popular air, but otherwise the street is almost
deserted, for the roll of dinner-carriages is over, and that
of the later entertainments not yet begun. Truly the
only thing of interest is the handsome little face itself.
The face is a curious mixture: the soft, dreamy eyes
contrast so sharply with the firm, I had almost said hard,
little mouth. A varying face, for its earnest, thoughtful
expression now is as different as possible from that which
stole over it on the staircase not half an hour ago.
Sad that the sight of a mother should have the power to
call up such an expression. But, alas ! it was not a solitary
instance. It seemed, indeed, as if there were something
antagonistic in the dispositions of mother and daughter;
so utterly different was their organization, that it appeared
hopeless that they should ever understand one another.
Mutual love and forbearance would have done it. Patience
on the one side and reverence on the other might have
drawn them together; but, unhappily, these feelings were
unknown by either mother or daughter.
No doubt Nina was not easy to understand, nor was she
a winning or attractive child. No ; she was, as her mother
said, "an odd child;" one of those children who go by
the opprobrium "difficult"God help them 1 for few
others will.
Cold, proud, indifferent.
Let us watch her a little before we join in the verdict
ourselves.
The July evening is coming to a close. The organ has
strayed farther away. Every now and then snatches of
chorus sound from Park Lane, as the merry little street-
boys return from bathing in the Serpentine. Everything

speaks of the end of the busy day, and Nina rouses her-
self from her reverie and looks at the school-room
clock.
It is past nine, and she puts away her book, and pre-
pares to leave the room. But first she stoops down and
takes off her shoes. Then, very quietly, almost stealthily,
the child opens the school-room door, and passes along
the passage, and up the stairs.
Her bedroom door is open, and Cecily's voice is heard
from within, singing little songs to herself, to beguile the
time while she is waiting for her sister. But Nina brushes
past, and turns down a passage which corresponds with
the school-room one below. Where can the child be
going?
Here a door stands partly open, and Nina hesitates a
moment before she passes it. Voices and laughter from
within, and the clatter of plates and dishes, intimate that
the nurses are at supper, and very quietly she creeps past,
as if afraid of being discovered,very, very quietly,and
enters with a noiseless step a darkened room a little
farther on.
A night-light burns dimly on the table, and Nina stands
by the door till her eyes get sufficiently accustomed to the
subdued light to be able to distinguish the different objects
in the room.
A big bed, a small bed, and two cribs, proclaim the
bedroom nursery. The big bed is empty, but three sleep-
ing children occupy the others.
\n a little bed by itself lies a big, rosy boy about five,
and in the crib next the wall a rosy baby girl.
Without glancing at these two, Nina passes on to the
crib on the other side of the big bed, and stands at its
foot, motionless. A restless sleeper, this. The bedclothes
are tossed about in every direction; the little face on the

pillow is flushed, and the long, fair hair all in disorder.
He cannot have been asleep long, nor does he seem to
sleep soundly now, for disjointed words proceed from his
lips, and he stirs uneasily. He must, judging by the pro-
fusion of hair, and general aspect of the lovely little face,
be at least three years old; but his face and hands are
scarcely as large as those of the baby sister who sleeps so
soundly in the crib opposite. The little hand and arm that
lie outside the coverlet are thin and small, and sadly blue
are the veins in the transparent forehead.
And now let us take one glance at the face of the child
who is cold, hard, indifferent.
Where is the look of haughty indifference with which
it received her mother's message? Where is the look of
supercilious contempt with which it watched that mother
on the stairs? Where is even the firm, tightly-compressed
little mouth P
Gone ! all gone lall merged in an expression of yearn-
ing tenderness, of passionate affection, which pervades
and beautifies the entire countenance.
The child's whole soul is in her face as she gazes at her
little invalid brother. Gazes, gazes, as if she could never
gaze enough.
Going to his side at last, she bends over him, and tries
to arrange the rumpled bedclothes, and to relieve the hot
forehead of the tangled, disordered hair. Bending closer
still, she impresses tender kisses on his pillow, on the
sheet, on his hair; and, as she does it, she whispers, softly,
"Good-night, Totty, good-night !"
Then returning to the foot of the crib, she stands there
for a few minutes, as if to assure herself his sleep is sound.
It seems as though she fears it is so light a slumber that
he may waken any moment and find the nurses not yet
come to bed, for she appears loath to leave him.

Is she going to keep a lonely vigil till that time shall
come 2 for she twines her arms around the bars of his crib,
and lays her head upon them.
No ; she is only repeating to herself, ere she leaves him
in the darkness, the old rhyme, slightly varied, with
which many a nervous child has soothed itself to sleep
amid the fancied terrors of a lonely room:
"Four corners to his bed,
Four angels round his head;
One to watch, two to pray,
And one to keep all fears away."
The regular breathing of the other children is heard in
the stillness as she stands there watching, and the sound
seems to irritate her a little, as if their health and strength
contrasted painfully in her mind with the frail little sleeper
before her.
But Totty does not stir again, and she is satisfied.
Her dark eyes seem to glow with the intensity of the
love within her, as she takes a farewell gaze, and without
one glance at the other beds she retires as noiselessly as
she came, turning once more ere she passes into the
lighted passage, to kiss her hand to the little sleeper, and
to murmur, softly, "Good-night, Totty, good-night !"
Then quickly and hastily she goes down the stairs, and
regains her own room.
Night after night, unknown to all, suspected by none,
does the child pay this noiseless visit. Night after night
does the little figure steal up the staircase, shoes in hand,
and disappear in the darkened room. She is always more
or less in fear of detection, but never yet has she been
discovered.
Mademoiselle always supposes her in her bedroom;
Cecily supposes her with Mademoiselle; housemaids and

nurses are alike busy at their supper; and so hitherto she
has escaped.
It may be that He unto whom all hearts are open, and
whose pity is equal to his power, ordered that it should
be so, and gave his angels charge concerning her, to keep
all hindrances away.
It may be that He was leading the wayward child to
himself, through her love for her baby brother; lest in
the lovelessness of the atmosphere in which she lived, the
little heart should really come to be as cold and hard as
it was there considered, and so should never rise into the
experience of that higher love which is in itself both God
and heaven.
"For it is through the gush of our human tenderness
that the soul first learns its destiny is divine; it is through
a mortal yearning, unsatisfied, that the soul ascends, seek-
ing a higher object; it is through our human affections
that the immortal and the infinite in us reveals itself."
The voices of the ladies returning to the drawing-room
came up the stairs half an hour after, and roused Nina
from her dreamless sleep. She woke with a beating heart,
for she was startled and confused, and she dreamily fan-
cied Totty must be ill, and that the voices she heard were
those of the alarmed nurses. By degrees she remembered
what it all meant, and with a sigh of relief she lay down
again. But the moment's fear had unsettled her, and she
could not get to sleep.
She lay, wondering whether the voices had disturbed
Totty too; and, if so, whether he would find the nurses
come to bed or not. Vague fears haunted her of his lying
awake frightened and not able to make himself heard. She
could not calm herself about it, except by repeating the
soothing rhymes over and over again; and sleep over-
took her, dreamily murmuring,-

C H A P T E R III.
MRs. MIDDLETON's RULES AND REGULATIONs.
MRs. MIDDLETON was, as we have said, a woman of
theory, and her theories on the subject of the education
and training of children were very decided. Her system,
as she imagined, combined the advantages of the old sys-
tem and the advantages of the new.
"Children nowadays," said Mrs. Middleton, "were
too much made of, took too prominent a part in the
household economy, and were taught to think themselves
of too great importance. They came too forward alto-
gether, and were too much with their parents, to the ex-
clusion, on the one hand, of many topics of conversation;
or to the hearing a great deal that was not intended for
their ears, on the other. The nursery and the school-
room were the proper places for them, regular walks with
their nurses or governesses quite change enough, and fixed
early hours for rising and going to bed."
Prompt obedience to herself she exacted,quick, un-
answering submission to every order. All very well in its
way. But the fault in Mrs. Middleton's system was, that
there was no confidence or love between her and her chil-
dren, no interchange of thought and affection.
She did not see enough of them to understand them ;
she did not watch or study them at all; so that she failed
## p. 53 (#57) ##############################################
MRS. M/DDLETON'S REGULA 77OAS. 53
to discover where her system fell short, or, indeed, that
(a system which succeeded with one child might possibly
fail with another; that all children are not alike, and that
where characters and temperaments differ, methods of
training should differ also, or at least be modified and
adapted.)
Strong in the knowledge that her system had had great
success with her three elder boys, she was firm in her own
confident opinion that her theories were perfect, and her
practice more perfect still.
It so happened that with her three easy-going, thick-
skinned boys it had all answered very well; but she failed
to see that she had in her little daughters totally different
L^ characters to deal with.
Nina was a child who could have been led through her
affections, had those affections been drawn out ; but this
"driving " system only stirred up her pride and self-will.
Sensitive to the last degree, she had learned to be ashamed
of the deep feelings which she felt within her, and to call
up pride to help her to overcome and conceal them; and
that pride had now become so completely a second nature
that she daily acted an indifference to everything and
everybody that she did not really feel.
Cecily, timid and nervous, was a child who needed pro-
tection and help, and who should have been encouraged
to overcome her self-consciousness and fear of ridicule,
and have been taught that she could depend upon her
mother's love and assistance,instead of which she feared
her, and never felt at ease in her presence.
Outwardly, they were no doubt well-behaved and sub-
missive. But their good behavior was merely a mask,
worn in their mother's presence, which concealed their
real selves from her and from others. There was no deep
feeling at work in their hearts. There was never any ap-
5*

peal made to their affections; to their sense of right, or
their individual responsibility,+no inculcation of princi-
ple, on which a superstructure of religion might be built.
If they did wrong, they were punished,that was all.
Neither was punishment ever followed up by forgiveness
and advice. They were never taught that their failings
made their mother unhappy, and that, for her sake, they
ought to try and not offend again,a doctrine which con-
veys so forcibly to young minds that their sins are dis-
pleasing to God, and that{out of love to Him, more than
out of fear, they should strive to overcome them.) No
Nothing of all this. Nothing but the fear of punishment,
and the dread of public remark. But, after all, it was
not so much the training as the mother herself. Had her
example been always good and attractive, her system
might have succeeded better. Her own character was all
unformed and undisciplined; she had not educated or
trained herself: therefore, how was it possible she could
rightly train and educate others? The fact was, she was
intensely selfish. She was an only child and an heiress.
She had always been indulged in everything, and been
accustomed to have her own way, and to be worshiped
and flattered by all. She had a strong will, a quick tem-
per, and an immense idea of her own importance. She
was clever, managing, and determined; worldly, and
very ambitious. Was this a person likely to enter into
all the difficulties and trials of child-life?to put herself
in her children's place, and to view the unfolding chart
of life with their wondering, puzzled eyes? No! She
had her place in the world, and the children had theirs.
Hers, immeasurably superior and important; theirs, less
than secondary, simply subservient to her, and to her
will.
Some day it would be different, perhaps. As grown-up
Q

girls and boys, she might hereafter allow them to assume
some individuality; but at present they were just chil-
dren, a mere flock of sheep, to be driven according to
her way, without any distinction. She made certain rules,
and they were to follow them,--that was all. If they
didn't, they were punished: there was no middle course.
She was not fond of children. A child was to her raw
material, out of which something might be made some
day; but as a child it did not interest her. The society
of children gave her no pleasure.
Perhaps this arose from idleness, perhaps from selfish-
ness, perhaps from stupidity.
She found it a great trouble to provide answers to their
questions, and was bored to find that when she had an-
swered one, it gave rise to another. She was too selfish
to come down from the heights of her own mature reflec-
tions, and to lower herself to the level of the baby ques-
tioner. Perhaps, in spite of her vaunted cleverness, she
was too stupid or too ignorant to satisfy their curiosity.
It requires no small amount of knowledge to parry, suc-
cessfully, the questions of an inquiring child-mind.
The questioning child is never the favorite in the
nursery, because it is often beyond the nurse's power to .
satisfy its thirst for information, and so she is often
floored, and feels lowered by having her ignorance ex-
posed.
Anyhow, from whatever cause it arose, Mrs. Middleton
was not fond of children; she did not understand them;
she had not realized that self must be put on one side
before she could really train or influence them; and the
consequence was, that she had no real influence over
them, and they neither loved nor respected her.
Of direct attempts there was no lack. Lecture by the
hour would Mrs. Middleton; precept upon precept, rule

upon rule, she would sometimes shower upon her little
daughters when complaints against them were brought
before her. But they saw her at times when she was not
thinking of them, and they had, alas ! learned to discover
her inconsistencies, and to compare the purity of her
theories with the faultiness of her practice. What was
the good, for instance, of her punishing them for an out-
break of temper, when they could see, by her flushing
cheek and raised voice, that her own was not under her
control? Did they not intuitively feel that it was not so
much that they had sinned, as that they had wounded
their mother's amour propre or irritated her nervous tem-
per; and that they were suffering from revenge, not pun-
ishment; that it was only because they were the weaker
that they went to the wall, since the sin was the same on
both sides P
Vain was her teaching while her conduct was at vari-
ance with it. For there is a great and important differ-
ence between direct and indirect influence, which is well
defined thus: "Our direct efforts to teach may be con-
tradicted by our lives, while the indirect influence is our
very life."
Strict is the watch a mother should keep over herself in
her children's presence, lest they lose belief in the good-
ness, justice, and love which are to lead them to God, and
of which, till they know Him, she is to them the embodi-
ment. Let them believe in one person, though all others
fail them. She should be on her guard, lest their sense
of right and justice get marred by her inconsistency, their
affections chilled by her changeability, or their minds
confused in striving to reconcile her teaching with her
daily conduct.
Surely a mother's should indeed be a life of prayer
while contending with such difficulties as these, for she is

but human herself. But with such an end in view it is
worth the struggle; for all through life her children will
have the memory of at least one person whom they could
safely believe in, and be helped by that recollection, even
amidst all the sin and darkness around them, to have faith
in the divinity of this human nature which our Saviour
condescended to assume. In that other mother in our
story, to whom we have only, as yet, slightly alluded,
was a bright pattern and example forever before Mrs.
Middleton; but her eyes were closed to her young sister-
in-law's merits, and she saw no ways perfect but her own.
Magdalen Lyndsay had, in the training of her boy,
acted in every way contrary to Mrs. Middleton's ideas,
and Mrs. Middleton despised her system accordingly.
But the fact was, Magdalen Lyndsay had no "system."
Love and complete confidence existed between her and
her boy, and on that foundation she built.
Mervyn had never had any inconsistencies to confuse
him in his mother, or anything to shake his firm, abiding
belief in her. He knew that when an obedience was
exacted from him which conflicted with his own wishes,
it was for the love of him, or for some wise reason, that
it was demanded. He looked for, and expected, the
cheering tone of encouragement, the bright smile of ap-
proval; and with the help of them, and for the sake of
them, he made efforts to overcome his faults, the very
idea of which would have been Greek to Nina Middleton.
Magdalen had never brought Self to bear in any way
against her boy; she had never allowed herself to be per-
sonally irritated by his faults, or outwardly vexed if her
time was broken in upon.
Ten times out of twenty these are the real causes of
children's offenses. It is not so much what they are say-
ing or doing at the time, as that they have chosen a time
C+

which is inconvenient to us for saying or doing it; and
had it happened when we were disengaged, or were in a
different frame of mind, or better temper, we should have
seen no offense in it. No wonder that children get puz-
zled when they find that what passed without remark one
day is a terrible offense the next, and that what was looked
upon as a crime yesterday may be done with impunity to-
day. -
Magdalen had been alive to all these dangers, and had
striven to steer clear of them. All she asked in return
was reverence and obedience; and these Mervyn had
never, as yet, failed to render.
No more, to be sure, had Nina; obedience at least, as
far as her mother knew. But herein lay the difference.
Mervyn's character was as an unrolled map to his mother,
and she knew every part of it well. She could answer
for him as for herself. Nina's was as a sealed book to
hers; and if Mrs. Middleton thought she could answer
for her, or depend upon her obedience, it was only be-
cause she never thought about it at all. She had no more
idea of the strength of character, the strength of purpose
and will, or the power of resistance and rebellion, which
lay behind the girl's impassive exterior, than she had of
the powers of affection which dwelt there equally hidden.
No 1 no one knew what went on in the heart of the
child who was called "odd, cold, unaccountable."
No one guessed what depths of tenderness existed under
her apparent indifference; walled in and kept down by
the sensitive pride which had become a second nature.
Long had they lain there dormant, unsuspected and
uncalled for, till the birth of little Totty, the first of all
Mrs. Middleton's children who had not been a highly
satisfactory baby, -a baby that she was proud to show if
sent for, fine, forward, and healthy.
## p. 59 (#63) ##############################################
MRS. M/DDLE TOM'S A'EGULA TIONS. 59
Till he appeared, Mrs. Middleton's babies had all been
framed after the same pattern ; had stood their vaccina-
tion well, cut their teeth at the proper time, ran alone
when she thought it time they should do so, fallen into
all her plans for their feeding and sleeping, and yielded
to treatment directly if by any chance they fell ill.
But, alas ! poor little Totty was a sad exception to all
this. A wailing, suffering baby from his birth, he ran
counter to his mother's rules in every way. He was
weeks getting over his vaccination; he cut every tooth
late; he had not attempted to crawl at the age the others
ran alone; and at two years old he had still to be put to
sleep by being walked up and down the room. Perhaps
this was, in Mrs. Middleton's eyes, the greatest offense
of all. It was one of her most stringent rules, and no
doubt a very good one, that her babies should, at as early
an age as possible, be put into bed and left to go to sleep
by themselves. The others had fallen into the way of it
very soon, as healthy children will; but with Totty it was
almost an impossibility. He would lie awake for hours
crying, unless soothed and hushed like a baby.
For a long time Mrs. Middleton had persevered; the
nurses were obliged to obey her, and poor Totty had to
be put into his crib awake, to cry himself to sleep alone.
But no one could bear to hear the wail of the delicate
child proceeding from the bedroom-nursery, and the
nurses often broke through Mrs. Middleton's rules. It
was no difficult matter, since she so seldom visited the
nurseries. She laid down rules, and took it for granted
they were followed; but she was by no means often
enough with the children to see that they were carried
out. So it was only by chance that she every now and
then discovered that Totty was still put to sleep. Each
time she put a stop to it, and laid down stricter regula-
## p. 60 (#64) ##############################################
6o 7A/RO WAV 7"OGAE 7THEA'.
tions than ever. But it was no use. Totty suffered from
want of sleep or exhaustion from crying; and even the
doctor at last told Mrs. Middleton that the child must,
for his health's sake, be humored, till he was older and
stronger. It was her first defeat. As he grew older she
renewed her attempts to get him into better habits, but
seldom with any success.
It was never clearly given out what was the matter with
Totty; but the real truth was, there was something the
matter with his spine, which the doctors greatly feared
would one day develop into distinct disease of the spine.
But it had by no means reached that stage yet. He could
stand alone now ; but, though nearly four years old, he
rarely attempted to walk, neither did the doctors wish that
he should. His chest was delicate, too, and he had once
had an attack of inflammation of the lungs, which had
left him very liable to catch bad colds.
He was a lovely little fellow, and singularly intelligent.
Though he might fall short of his brothers and sisters in
many ways, in face there was not one that could in any
way compare with him. But an ambitious woman like
Mrs. Middleton was not content with this. She looked
on to the future, and saw that the day would never come
when she should be proud of this son as she would be of
the others. If it had been in the case of a girl, it would
not have mattered so very much ; but a delicate, puny
man | -
Perhaps Totty's deficiencies would not have been so
apparent if he had not, when he was eighteen months
old, been succeeded by a baby sister who more than came
up to the standard of the Middleton baby; who was even
stronger, finer, and more forward; who walked, in short,
in all the paths Mrs. Middleton had marked out; and
who raced after poor little Totty with such speed, that

now, at a year and a half, she ran about out-of-doors,
while Totty still was driven in a perambulator.
Nina was of some age when Totty was born ; and, to
begin with, the tiny, ailing child, who seemed always cry-
ing and in pain, excited her pity; it was such a new thing
in their nursery. With a child's quickness, she soon
began to suspect that her mother was a little bit annoyed
by it and was rather ashamed of the puny, pale-faced baby.
Mooning over it by herself, the suspicion became daily
more confirmed in her mind; and any chance word that
Mrs. Middleton let fall upon the subject strengthened it,
till at last it became a certainty. From thinking Totty
was overlooked, she grew to think he was despised; and
from allowing to herself that he was despised, she per-
suaded herself that he was ill treated. Then woke there
up in her heart the pity that is akin to love. Then
came the sense of loving protection towards the sickly
child, and the determination to take its part against
everybody, and to be to it the defender that it seemed to
her to need so much. Alas ! that so pure a feeling should
have been mixed with antagonistic ill will towards her
mother; so that Nina was both at her best and at her
worst when she loved her little brother.
Day by day her love for him deepened. It grew with
her growth, and strengthened with her strength; while,
with characteristic pride, she strove to hide it from her
mother and from every one. It was her cherished secret,
and such it remained; since no one, except perhaps the
nurse, guessed at it.
Nina's character in the house was that she was not fond
of children; that she did not care for her younger brother
and sisters.
Her mother often remarked, "Some girls make such
nice little elder sisters; but Nina doesn't seem to care for
6
## p. 62 (#66) ##############################################
62 7THA'O WAV 7"O GE 7A/EA'.
the younger ones at all." Of such remarks Nina would
take no notice, only pursing up her mouth, and hugging
her secret tighter than ever, laughing to think how wrong
they all were; while her expression of countenance would
be taken for pride and temper, and her mother be con-
firmed in her opinion that she was a most odd, unaccount-
able child.
As Totty grew older and Nina loved him more and
more, she grew so sensitive about him that her heart
would beat when his name was mentioned and his consti-
tution discussed; and, to hide it, she always put on an air
of indifference whenever he was spoken of, which gave to
the outsider a very different impression from the real one.
When Totty was succeeded by another baby, she felt
him to become more hers than ever. Deeper and deeper
grew her love and her pity, when she saw the other child
wax stronger and finer month by month, while poor little
Totty seemed to make no progress at all; and angry feel-
ings would rise in her heart when she heard one child held
up to the deterioration of the other. She could not bear
to hear them compared, and her heart would beat loudly
when she heard hints every now and then dropped in the
nursery that the baby would walk first. How anxiously
she watched them both ! and how to the last she hoped
against hope
Yet, as we have said, at eighteen months the baby ran
about everywhere, while Totty looked on from his per-
ambulator. No one knew the storm of feeling which
swept over the child when Totty was openly overlooked,
by being left in the nursery, while the baby was sent for
to see visitors in the drawing-room.
Poor child ! the complications of troubles that she
went through on his account were many; but still, in
spite of them all, it was better for her and happier than

7THE AWE W A'A2 LA 7TWOAV A 7" L UAVCHEOM. 63
that indifference to everything and everybody which had
distinguished her before she had a Totty on whom to
expend her affection. And yet her mother had never
noticed the change, and was perfectly ignorant of the
girl's power of affection 1
Mrs. Middleton had indeed a good deal to discover.
She was content, so far, with the outward covering of
good behavior Nina wore in her presence; but she had
yet to learn what an obedience is worth which is not
founded on religion, love, or veneration. There was an
expression sometimes in the handsome little face which
would have led an acute observer to wonder how far that
outward covering would avail if any real cause of antag-
onism should ever arise, and to fancy that, if it should
ever be thrown off, it would be war to the knife between
mother and daughter | Whether such a fancy would be
correct or not, the events of the story will show.
C H A P T E R IV.
THE NEW RELATION AT LUNCHEON.
THERE was something the matter with Mademoiselle the
next morning at breakfast, for she was silent and moody,
and hardly answered Nina when she asked her if she
didn't think the butter was much better iced than usual.
It was evident that Nina was rather in disgrace, for
Mademoiselle's manner to Cecily was quite different.
Seeing how matters stood, Nina, with her usual indiffer-
ence, simply refrained from any further attempts at con-
versation, and ate her breakfast in silence. There was a
new-comer at breakfast,-the rosy five-year-old boy, by

name Edmund. He had just begun his school-room life
by breakfasting with his sisters and taking his morning
walk with them. This was by way of familiarizing him
with the French language, as no other was allowed to be
spoken at such times. Conversation at breakfast did not,
under all these circumstances, flow rapidly. Edmund, to
whom the arrangement had, as yet, all the charm of
novelty, sat with a broad grin on his ruddy countenance
whenever any one spoke. His own part in the proceed-
ings was limited to "S'il vous plait," when he wanted
more bread and butter, and "Merci" (by him pronounced
in broad English "Mercy"), when his wants had been
supplied. One long sentence which Mademoiselle ad-
dressed to Cecily elicited his scorn, and he exclaimed,
"You're talking rubbish."
Cecily was, of course, immediately assailed with a fit
of giggling; and all three being now alienated, Made-
moiselle broke up the breakfast-party, and sent them all to
dress for their walk. Edmund was in a terrible hurry to
be off. The Guards march through a certain part of the
park, playing their band, on their return from drill, and
if the school-room-party do not start in good time they
will miss them. They get off presently, Edmund and
Cecily in front, Nina and Mademoiselle behind, till they
come to the first crossing, and then Mademoiselle calls
the little boy to her side, and sends Nina on to join her
sister.
"What's the matter with Mademoiselle, Cecily?"
"I don't know. She was all right at breakfast before
you came down, and was talking away to me about her
headache, and how she couldn't get to sleep, and all that
sort of thing." Nina was silent. She saw now the
reason of the gloom. She had omitted to ask after
Mademoiselle's headache.
## p. 65 (#69) ##############################################
THE AWE W RELATION AT L UAVC/H.E.O.N. 65
"What made her talk about it?" she asked, presently.
"Oh, I asked her if it was gone when she came
down," answered Cecily, "and so then she told me all
about it."
Now, this was a very old offense of Nina's. She never
could make up her mind to ask people after their head-
aches and other little ailments. What was the most sim-
ple every-day affair to most people, was a great difficulty
to her.
I fear this little heroine of mine will seem to many
people a very disagreeable character, and they will think
her mother fully justified in holding that opinion. It
will, indeed, require the power of seeing "the soul of
goodness in things evil" to make them a little patient
with her. But so many weaknesses spring from perverted
good, and so many follies have their root in virtues, that
perhaps the germ of good in the child's peculiar disposi-
tion may be found, if searched for. As extravagance
springs oftentimes from lavish generosity; gossip and
curiosity from an over-kindly interest in the affairs of
others; so perhaps this want of courtesy and kindliness in
Nina might spring from the innate truthfulness of the
child's nature, over-strained and far-fetched though it
might be. She was afraid of seeming more interested in
the person than she really was ; she could not say she was
sorry when she knew she was not really grieved. Her
idea of being sorry was something so very different. She
did not, she told herself, know how to look while the per-
son was answering her question. She couldn't be affected,
and put on looks. If she might just run in and say,
"How is your headache?" and rush away without wait-
ing for the answer, she wouldn't mind half so much ; but
the standing there listening, and then not knowing what
to say next, or how soon to begin talking of something

else,  all this made courteous inquiry a very difficult
matter to Nina Middleton.
"At any rate, it is too late now," she told herself, as
she walked silently along by Cecily's side.
Cecily was, as usual, full of talk.
"I say, Nina, you know a tandem, and you know a
four-in-hand?"
"Yes," said Nina. "What of them?"
"What do you call a thing that is neither a tandem
nor a four-in-hand P''
The extreme vagueness of the question made Nina
hesitate.
"I'll tell you all that it isn't," continued Cecily, "and
then you can tell me what it is easier. It isn't a barouche,
nor a brougham, nor a dog-cart; it isn't a break, nor an
omnibus, nor a t-cart, nor an Irish car, nor a wagonette,
nor a landau, nor a pony-carriage, nor a cabriolet, nor
Oh, dear! I'm so tired Well, Nina, it's none of
those ; what can it be?"
"What is it like?" asked Nina; "and where did you
see it?" -
"It's got three horses, one in front of the other," an-
swered Cecily, "and I saw it in the mews from my bed-
room window. I'm sure it's quite a new thing, for I never
saw it before."
"I can't think what it can be," said Nina.
"Perhaps it will be there when we go home," said
Cecily. "I wanted so to see it start, but Mademoiselle
called me just as the last horse was put in."
They were just entering Kensington Gardens as she
spoke, and Edmund, released from Mademoiselle, came
running up to ask Cecily to play at horses, and the little
sisters' conversation came to an end.

hour on a summer's morning, present a very different
appearance from Kensington Gardens and Rotten Row a
few hours later in the day. From half-past eight to half-
past ten or eleven, both are quite given up, as it were, to
children.
Before the heat of the day has begun,-while the trees
wear that peculiar bright green which the day's dust will
turn into brown, while the morning air is fresh and sweet,
reigns all along the length of the Serpentine what may
be called "the children's hour." There are tiny ponies,
with tiny riders, sometimes led by grooms walking at the
side, sometimes connected to big horses and careful old
coachmen by long leading-reins. Babies in Spanish sad-
dles, jogging along close by the railings, where the nurse
walks; plucky little boys tearing along at a hand-gallop;
little girls with streaming hair racing after them, as quick
as the groom will allow. They mostly laugh and talk as
they ride along, and their voices sound merry in the still
summer air, and their bright hair looks brighter in the
summer sunshine.
Alongside, within the railings, are all the little walkers.
They look so cool and fresh in their brown holland cos-
tumes, and shady hats, particularly the babies, who lie
lazily back in their perambulators, under the great shady
awnings.
There is a pleasant hum of voices and laughter all round
about, mingled with the clink of the horses' harness and
the refreshing sound of neighboring water-carts.
The Serpentine looks cool and clear, gleaming in the
sun; and the din of London traffic is so mellowed by dis-
tance as to be rather soothing than otherwise.
The scene altogether is so different from what it will be
a few hours later, when to the light-heartedness and care-
lessness of the "children's hour" will succeed one known

well enough without description; when youth and beauty
and fashion will crowd into the park, bringing with them
cares and aims and interests unknown as yet to the chat-
tering throng in full possession now.
Punctually at eleven the little Middletons left the park
and proceeded home. The town was beginning to stir
as they reached Grosvenor Gate, and Cecily sighed deeply
at the thought of returning to lessons. She flew to her
window directly she got into her bedroom, but there was
no sign as yet of the carriage she had mentioned to Nina.
Lessons occupied the rest of the morning, and at a
quarter to two they were sent up-stairs to get ready for
luncheon. Cecily's head was out of the window in a
moment, and as quickly drawn in.
"Ninal here it is, just come home; the three horses
and all ! Do come and look."
Nina was washing her hands, and couldn't come di-
rectly.
"There are two gentlemen, besides grooms. One is
that young one we so often see, and a new one. He
looks like a "how-are-you;' but I'm not quite sure. Now
they've got out, and are patting the horses. Do come !"
Nina advanced to the window, and a deep color over-
spread her face when, in the new gentleman, she recog-
nized Lord Wardlaw.
"Do you know what it's called P" exclaimed Cecily,
excitedly. "Isn't it a jolly carriage?"
"No, I don't," Nina said, absently, her eyes intent on
the figure below; "and, Cecily, you'll be late if you don't
get ready."
She remained gazing at Lord Wardlaw, and thinking
of Mervyn. She felt almost sure he was nice, and longed
to write and tell Mervyn so. He was speaking to the
groom about one of the horses' feet, and he seemed so
## p. 69 (#73) ##############################################
7THE AWE W RELA 7TWOAZ A 7" L UAVCAE O/W. 69
kind about it. The other gentleman seemed to be pooh-
poohing it, but Lord Wardlaw seemed to be insisting on
having it attended to, and examined it carefully himself.
Then a little child ran out of the stables, and he turned
round and patted its head, and stooped down and talked
to it. Nina thought she saw him put his hand in his
pocket and put something into the child's hand, but was
not quite sure. Then he spoke to his friend, and pointed
to the house.
"He is saying he is coming here to luncheon," thought
Nina; and she blushed.
The other man seemed to say he would come too; and
they walked off together, arm-in-arm. But, as they went,
Nina noticed that Lord Wardlaw did not forget to turn
round and nod to the little child he had been talking to,
who stood in the middle of the road, staring after them.
All this time Cecily had not begun to get ready; she
had been so taken up with the horses and the new kind
of carriage. To her horror, the gong sounded, and Mad-
emoiselle came in to fetch them.
"Oh, what shall I do?" she exclaimed.
Mademoiselle answered, she must come down alone, as
it was better for one to be late than three. And so she
and Nina proceeded down-stairs, leaving poor Cecily in
mortal terror. It was such a terrible offense to be late
for luncheon. When they reached the dining-room they
found no one there, and the butler informed them that
Mrs. Middleton would not be down for ten minutes or so,
but had sent word they were not to wait for her.
"And zee Cornel?" asked Mademoiselle.
The Colonel was engaged with two gentlemen, but
would be in directly.
Nina felt her heart beat at the thought of so soon seeing
Mervyn's step-father; and she wondered where he would

7o THA'O WAV 7"OGAE 7THEA'.
sit. She herself had Mademoiselle on one side, and
Cecily's vacant place on the other. She hoped he would
sit exactly opposite, so that she might have a good look
at him.
The door opened, and in came the three gentlemen.
Nina, with the flush which excitement lent to her cheek,
was looking very handsome, and her father came up and
kissed her.
"Good-morning, my little woman."
"Wardlaw, this is my eldest daughter. Nina, this is
Lord Wardlaw. Mr. LeighMiss Middleton."
And Colonel Middleton sat down, laughing. This was
all against the rules. Mrs. Middleton never allowed any
introductions to the little girls, and particularly disliked
Nina being brought forward in this way. With her it was,
"Children, say how do you do to this gentleman," but
anything like the above introduction was quite against
her principles. Mr. Leigh bowed as if Nina was grown
up, and made some civil remark about the weather. Mrs.
Middleton would have been furious if she had been there.
Colonel Middleton, in his wife's absence, thought it rather
a good joke.
"We shall have her out and dancing about in no time,"
he said. *
"The sooner the better," answered Mr. Leigh.
But it was all lost upon Nina. Her eyes were fixed
on Lord Wardlaw, wondering if he would remember her.
She was not left long in doubt.
"We made friends in the park yesterday," he said, in
the kind voice which had attracted her before, coming
up and taking her hand.
Nina got very red, and shy, and didn't know what to
say; but she was conscious of a feeling of pleasure when
Lord Wardlaw seated himself by her side.
## p. 71 (#75) ##############################################
THE AWE W RELA 7TWOAV A T L UAVCAFEOAV. 71
"Something wrong, Wardlaw l'" said Colonel Middle-
ton, as he saw Lord Wardlaw looking inquiringly at the
silver mug and diminutive knife and fork in front of
him.
Now, the last thing Nina wished was to drive Lord
Wardlaw away, but between shyness and truthfulness she
did her best to do the very thing she did not want.
"You've got Cecily's place," she said, bluntly.
"I'm sure I beg Cecily's pardon," he said, smiling.
"What had I better do?"
"Nonsense, my dear fellow I don't trouble yourself to
move. Have the things changed."
And so, to Nina's great satisfaction, the arrangement
was not altered.
"By the way, where is Miss Cecily?" said Colonel
Middleton; "late for luncheon Lucky for her her
mamma is late too." And Colonel Middleton winked at
Nina as he spoke.
But Nina did not smile. There was a loyalty in the
child's nature, and a truthfulness, which made anything
underhand impossible to her. She knew she would not
have smiled if her mother had been present, and so she
was too honest to do it just because she was not there.
She kept her eyes on her plate. None of this was lost
upon Lord Wardlaw. Perhaps it was some qualities of
this kind that had attracted him years ago to Magdalen
Middleton.
At this juncture Cecily, looking shy and frightened,
was seen trying to glide into the room unobserved. The
change in her face when she saw her mother was not there
was very remarkable.
"Come here, you rogue, and give me a kiss," said
Colonel Middleton. "What do you mean by being late?"
Cecily sprang to his side, delighted with her reception.

"Oh, papa, it was looking at the carriage. I quite
forgot to get ready." `--
Colonel Middleton was rather anxious to trot his little
girls out before their new relation, and encouraged Cecily
to converse.
"Sit down here, between me and Mr. Leigh, and ex-
plain yourself." :
The near vicinity of one of the heroes of the mews
was too much for Cecily. She quite jumped at the name,
and exclaimed, "Oh how very funny I was wonder-
ing who it was." . -
"You have not had long to wonder," said her father;
"you have hardly been a minute in the room."
"Oh, but I was wondering before," said Cecily.
Everybody laughed.
"What do you mean?" asked Colonel Middleton.
"When have you seen that gentleman before ?"
"I was watching him while I was getting ready for
luncheon," said Cecily. "That's what made me late."
"Upon my word," said her father, "I call this sort of
thing quite romantic."
"What do you call it?" exclaimed Cecily, eagerly;
"that is just what I want to know."
"Come, come," said Colonel Middleton, "you must
explain yourself. What do you mean?"
"I mean," she said, "that I want to know what you
call a carriage that is not a wagonette, nor a t-cart, nor

"My goodness, child !" exclaimed her father, "one

"So I have," she answered, "at least" And she
broke off, astonished at the laughter with which her
speech was received, and dismayed at a reproachful sound
which broke from Mademoiselle. Nina now roused her-

self to speak, for she was expecting her mother to appear
every moment, and feared Cecily might get into disgrace.
"Our bedroom window looks out on the mews, papa,"
she said, "and Cecily is very fond of watching what goes
on there. Not our stables, you know, but a gentleman's;
Mr. Leigh's, I suppose, as I sometimes see him there.
There was a new kind of carriage there this morning, and
Cecily has been wanting to know what it is called. It's
got three horses, one in front of the other, and we saw
Mr. Leigh andyou," she added, turning to Lord Ward-
law, "getting out of it this morning."
"Oh that's called a harum-scarum," said Lord Ward-
law, kindly,
"If I want a clear, sensible answer, I always get it out
of Nina," said Colonel Middleton. "You're a harum-
scarum sort of creature yourself, 'Silly-Billy,' and it's just
the sort of carriage for you."
"I shall be delighted to give Miss Cecily a drive in
mine," said Mr. Leigh.
"Oh, shouldn't I like it !" exclaimed Cecily, clapping
her hands; and her face beamed with delight.
"Like what?" said a very decided voice, as the door
opened.
Cecily's face clouded over with an expression of fear;
her eyes dropped, and she went on eating her dinner.
Colonel Middleton looked uneasy, and Nina disturbed ;
for Mrs. Middleton had entered the room. She greeted
both guests with warmth, especially Lord Wardlaw, and
took her seat at the head of the table.
"I feel as if I have disturbed a conversation," she
said, blandly; "I heard such a babel of voices as I came
along."
"We were talking about harum-scarums," said Lord
Wardlaw. -

"I have a great dislike to that kind of foolish car-
riage," said Mrs. Middleton. "I always think a young
man must be either very idle or very foolish who sets up
anything of the kind. I shall never allow my sons to do
such a thing."
There was rather an awkward silence after this speech.
Mr. Leigh looked very uncomfortable; he was very young,
not much more than a boy, and he dreaded Mrs. Middle-
ton's scorn. -
There was a twinkle in Lord Wardlaw's eye, and he
was the first to speak.
"I am afraid, Mrs. Middleton, you will have a very
poor opinion of me when I tell you I have been driving
in one this morning."
Now, nothing could make Mrs. Middleton think badly
of Lord Wardlaw. He was in the highest favor. She
answered, graciously, "It would take a great deal to make
me alter my opinion of Lord Wardlaw, and I am quite
sure idleness and folly could not be mentioned in con-
nection with his name. Some other motive must have
been at work."
"Probably drove with a friend to prevent his breaking
his neck," suggested Colonel Middleton, winking at Mr.
Leigh, who blushed crimson.
But here Cecily, who had been struggling hard to
repress it for some minutes, broke into such a fit of
giggling that the conversation was brought to an abrupt
termination.
Mrs. Middleton could hardly believe her ears, and was
turning indignantly towards her to order her out of the
room, when Lord Wardlaw interposed.
"I must intercede," he said. "This conversation,
coming so close upon that which preceded it, has been a
little too much for the child. Will you trust me to ex-

plain it to you, and, meanwhile, overlook the transgres-
sion for this time?as the first favor I have asked on
entering the family," he added, in a lower tone; and
Mrs. Middleton at once gave in.
It would be hard to say whether Mr. Leigh or Cecily
was the most relieved by this arrangement. The former
had feared Lord Wardlaw was going to declare him the
owner of a harum-scarum, and poor Cecily had been in
agonies. Nina, too, had been on thorns; but her opinion
of Lord Wardlaw rose higher and higher, and as she left
the dining-room she told herself that, far from being to
be pitied, Mervyn was to be envied on the acquisition of
so charming a step-father.
There was a feeling of freedom all over the house that
afternoon, for Mrs. Middleton and her husband went to a
breakfast soon after four o'clock, and were not expected
home till late at night. Extra strictness is apt to produce
eye-service, and Mrs. Middleton's household was no ex-
ception to the rule. All, from the governess down to the
footman, children included, felt as if a weight were
lifted off their minds, and began to turn over in their
thoughts how best to avail themselves of the opportunity
offered them of doing something different from usual.
"When the cat's away
The mice do play;"
and every mouse in the establishment thought of some
little game. Mademoiselle went off to tea with a friend,
leaving the school-room under Nina's care. The head
nurse went to the play, deputing all her duties to the
nursery-maid. Cecily and Edmund, directly tea was over,
made an inroad into the drawing-room, and amused them-
selves by looking at the photograph-books, etc., which
were, as a rule, denied to them ; and Nina went up to the

nursery, and carried Totty into her bedroom to spend
the evening with her. Cecily also made a minute ex-
amination of all the invitations in the looking-glass over
the chimney-piece, and tried to calculate how many times
her father and mother would dine out that week. Mean-
while Edmund went on the balcony, climbed over into
the adjoining one, and peeped in at the neighbor's win-
dows. But the sound of niggers coming down the street
distracted them both, and they flew off to carry the news
to Nina and Totty.
She was sitting on the floor with her little brother in
her arms, talking softly to him, or singing him little
songs; and when the others burst in with their news, she
answered sharply that she did not care about niggers.
For she resented the interruption, and their noisy en-
trance had startled the nervous child in her lap.
The animation, however, which shone in Totty's pale
little face at the news, made her pause, and, bending her
head over him, she whispered, tenderly,
"Would Totty like to see them?"
"What are they like?" asked Totty.
"They are black men, darling, and they sing and
dance."
Totty shuddered.
Evidently he had not been prepared for the nature of
the entertainment.
"Must I really go?" he said, fearfully.
"Oh, yes, Totty," said Edmund. "Come on; they're
jolly men, you know." -
But Nina, meeting the appealing glance of the great
blue eyes, settled it for him in a moment. Throw-
ing her arms round him, she assured him that no one
and nothing should make him see anything he did not
like.

"Totty's a muff," said Edmund; but, fortunately for
him, Nina did not hear.
Then he and Cecily ran off again, and the brother and
sister were left alone.
"We're happier without them, ain't we, darling? and
we'll go on looking at the pictures."
Then, as it got later, and he grew weary, she pillowed
his head on her shoulder and sang softly to him in the
gathering twilight.
Song after song he called for, joining in sometimes
himself, but for the most listening quietly, and following
the events of the tales contained in the quaint old ballads
with eager interest.
- The crowning favorite was kept to the last, and sung
slowly and distinctly, that he might follow the sense,
"Lord Thomas
He was
A forester bold
And hunted
The king's brown deer,
And Eleanor
She
Was a faire maiden,
And Lord Thomas
He
Loved her dear,"
on and on, through the twelve or thirteen stanzas of
which the ballad is composed.
Totty was half asleep towards the end, but kindled
into sudden enthusiasm at the thrilling consummation:
"He cut off
His . . A

And threw it against the wall!". .

"Oh, Ninal did he really?"
This question would always come whenever the verse
was sung; and Nina, seeing the shrinking in his eyes,
would always answer,<
"No, darling, not really; it's only a tale."
She had once said story; but this had so confused truth
and falsehood in Totty's mind, and made him so fearful
of how far Nina herself might be implicated in the un-
truth, that she had since substituted the word "tale."
"Only a tale, darling, that's all."
"But is it a joke, Nina?"
"Yes, darling, it's a kind of joke."
"A kind of a sort of a joke," he would repeat, rather
anxiously; "isn't it, Nina?"
Nina had tried leaving out the verse altogether, but he
always discovered this and asked for it. In spite of his
fear, it fascinated him, and he would not for the world
have allowed her to miss it.
"Now again," he said, sleepily, just as she had safely
reached the end of the fourteenth verse; and Nina,
unmurmuring, began all over again.
He was fetched to bed at seven, and then she went and
joined the others on the drawing-room balcony.

THE HERO'S HOME. 79
C H A P T E R V.
THE HERO's HOME.
"HERE I Beth-Gelert. Here! halloo, old fellow !"
The hills all around caught up the sound of the fresh
young voice, and echoed it from one to the other.
"Not there ! old Stupid Here!" rang out the merry
tones again, and again the hills reverberated, "Not there !
old Stupid Here!"
And then such a ringing laugh pealed through the air,
that the old hills sounded mad with joy as they took it
up, and repeated it again and again.
Mervyn Lyndsay put down his books on a bit of rock,
and bounded lightly up the sides of one of the hills, till
he reached a spot from whence he could command a better
view of the surrounding country; and there he stood,
shading his eyes with his hand from the setting sun, and
looking eagerly round in search of something.
The old Welsh hills looked down admiringly on the
graceful figure and the bright young face,the only
animate things to be seen in that secluded spot.
Save one,the dog Beth-Gelert, who, confused by the
echoes, had been careering along in the opposite direction
to join his young master, and who now, having given up
their meeting as a bad job, was running at full speed
towards Glen-Mervyn, the boy's ancestral home.
It was hidden away among the trees to the left, and
only the chimneys could be seen, even from the high
eminence where Mervyn now stood. Seeing at a glance
the position of affairs, with another merry laugh the boy

bounded down the hill again, caught up his books, and
ran at full speed towards the house, hoping to overtake
the dog. By some short cut through a plantation, prob-
ably known only to himself, he reached the stables in
a few minutes; where, on glancing at the stable clock,
his face expressed astonishment, and he increased his
speed.
Opening a back door, he ran through some passages,
and emerged into a large old-fashioned hall, decorated
with antlers and banners and adorned with figures of old
knights in armor. Then, pushing open a heavy oak door,
he entered a long, low drawing-room, and, throwing down
his books and hat on the nearest table, he advanced to a
bow-window at the otherend of the room, and exclaimed,
"Oh, mothel darling, I'm sorry I'm so late I hope
I haven't kept you waiting for tea."
The lady whom he addressed was sitting in the bow-
window, with an open letter in her hand, apparently lost
in thought. Her head was turned towards the window,
and her eyes were wandering over the beautiful Welsh
country, which stretched away beyond the gardens and
pleasure-grounds. She was quite young, and probably
looked even younger than she really was ; too young, in
fact, to be the mother of the well-grown boy who stood
by her side. So deep was her absorption that she did
not even hear Mervyn's noisy entrance; and it was not
till his voice sounded close to her that she woke from her
reverie, and then she turned round with a start, and
exclaimed,
"Is that you, darling? how you startled me !"
Mervyn was unfeignedly astonished.
"Me, mother why, of course it is me ! Who else
should it be?"
"To be sure," said Mrs. Lyndsay, "I don't know, as
## p. 81 (#85) ##############################################
THE HERO'S HOA!/E, 81
you say, who else it could be ; but I don't think I was
expecting you so soon."
"So soon " echoed Mervyn; "why, I am so dread-
fully late that I thought you would be wondering what
had become of me! Why, mother do you know it is
half-past five?"
"Is it possible?" said his mother; but she still an-
swered rather absently, and her eyes seemed to have an
irresistible inclination to wander again to the distant
mountains.
"But tell me, dear,'' she continued, as with an effort
she shook off her reverie, and rose from her seat, "what
is it makes you so late 2 And, my child, how hot you
are I'' she concluded, laying her hand against his flushed
cheek.
As she moved from her chair, the letter, which had
been lying on her lap, fell to the ground, and as Mervyn
picked it up and gave it to her, he could not help seeing
that she flushed slightly, and rather hastily took it from
his hand. He was puzzled for a moment, but he soon
forgot the passing feeling in the excitement of relating
his adventures with Beth-Gelert, to which his mother
listened with all her usual interest and animation.
Magdalen Lyndsay, as the reader is already aware, was
a widow, and Mervyn was her only child. She had
married early a man many years her senior, and he had
died eighteen months after, leaving her sole guardian
of her son and of his property. We will glance at her
individual history from the time of her husband's
death. -
It seemed to her her duty to live herself, and to bring
up her boy, among his own people, and in his forefathers'
home; and so, in spite of the objections raised by her
relations, and especially by her brother, she settled always

to spend eight months of the year at Glen-Mervyn.
Colonel Middleton represented to her the loneliness of
such an arrangement; "buried alive," as he called it, in
a solitary part of Wales, with a child who was too young
to be a companion. But she resisted all his attempts to
induce her to make a home in London and to content
herself with flying visits to Glen-Mervyn. She was not
only Mervyn's mother, she argued, but sole manager of
his property till he should come of age to undertake it
himself. Her husband had placed trust in her by his
will, and she was determined to prove herself worthy of
his confidence. She promised she would always come to
London for four months in the year, and hoped all her
relations would visit her at Glen-Mervyn whenever they
felt inclined ; and for the rest of the time, she said, if
she could not be contented with a beautiful home and
plenty of occupation, a child, and youth and health with
which to enjoy it all, she thought she must be a very poor
creature indeed.
Her brother, who looked upon her as a child herself,
could not at all see the force of this argument. "Really,
Magdalen," he said, "you must be very conceited if you
think the estate cannot get on quite well without you. . A
better-ordered, better-managed property cannot be; and
surely a land-steward, who has lived so many years upon
it, does not require you to tell him what to do."
"All very true," his sister answered; "but I have
great faith in the master's eye."
"Master's eye, yes," he repeated, contemptuously;
"but the eye of a girl of your age is not exactly the same
thing. And what on earth can you, who have lived all
your life in a London street, know about managing a
property?"
"You forget, Rowley, that I have been married eighteen

months, and lived all that time on the very property of
which you are speaking."
"Eighteen months' your experience must be vast,
truly 1"
"Greater than you think, perhaps," said Magdalen, as
her thoughts reviewed those eighteen months of close
companionship with a man who, though old enough to
be her father, had always insisted on her taking interest
in his pursuits, and by this means had instilled into her
mind much that she would never have dreamt of in-
quiring into ; for which knowledge, little as it had inter-
ested her at the time, she was grateful now, since it would
enable her to undertake her new duties.
"As to the dullness," she added, "I am used to it,
and" But here she broke off, for not even to her
brother would she confess how dreary that eighteen
months of married life had been, owing to her husband's
jealous temperament, which, though she knew it sprang
from over-affection, had been very hard to bear. Hence
their secluded life; for he could not bear that any but
himself should engross her attention for a minute. He
could not bear her interest diverted from him and his
interests for a single instant. He was jealous even of her
occupations, if they tended in any way to the neglect of
himself; jealous of the care she bestowed on the poor;
jealous of her relations; jealous of her love for her baby
boy. But Magdalen had been marvelously patient with
him, for she had recognized through it all, and been
grateful for, the love which prompted it. Gratitude was
a very prominent feature in her character. She had mar-
ried him from gratitude, borne with him through grati-
tude; and now, with a feeling of gratitude for his mem-
ory, she was eager to devote her life to following out his
wishes. But she was half conscious all the time that life

84 THRO WAV 7'OGETHER.
looked brighter; that the prospect of Glen-Mervyn, with
her boy, which seemed so dull to others, was to her, by
comparison with the life she had led there, suffused with
light and hope and enjoyment; and that the days that were
coming in the old Welsh home, relieved of the perpetual
strain of trying to satisfy an affection which never could
be satisfied, would be very, very pleasant. But all this she
could not, and would not, tell; and therefore she broke
off her sentence hurriedly, fearing she had said too much.
"I don't understand you, Magdalen," said Colonel
Middleton; "nor can I conceive a girl of your age vol-
untarily exiling herself in that way. You will grow mor-
bid and unsociable, and be an old woman before your
time."
His sister laughed merrily at the idea.
"You must try and prevent that by coming very often
to stay with me, dear Rowley. You and Lydia must look
upon Glen-Mervyn as a second home, to come and go
when you like, and always with as many children as you
like to bring."
And so the argument ended for that time, to be re-
newed again and again, and always with the same result.
Magdalen was firm, and no amount of talking made her
waver in her resolution for a moment. She settled at
Glen-Mervyn shortly afterwards, and it had been her
home from that time until the day on which this chapter
opens. It was not such utter seclusion, after all. In the
shooting-season the house was always more or less full of
relations; and the early months of the year she spent in
London, returning to Wales in June. Those years had
been singularly uneventful and singularly peaceful. Care
and anxiety had been unknown, and sorrow had held
aloof from Glen-Mervyn.
In the management of the property, in the care of the
## p. 85 (#89) ##############################################
THE HERO'S HOME. 85
poor, in forwarding every scheme for the improvement
and well-being of all around her, and, above all, in the
education and training of her boy, Magdalen Lyndsay
had found occupation and interest, and in them had been
satisfied. Beloved and esteemed by all, responsible mainly
for the well-being of those around her for many miles,
with youth and health with which to enjoy everything,
and wealth sufficient to gratify every passing desire, her
life was neither empty nor dull. Useful, responsible,
powerful, and respected, what more did she want? Only
affection; and even that was hers; for as her boy grew
on, he developed such strong affections, and such devotion
to herself, that she had no longing to soothe, and no feel-
ing unsatisfied. He showed a care and a thought for her
beyond his years, a protecting kind of love which was
very touching in a boy of his age.
From his earliest childhood he had been accustomed to
be told, "Take care of her, Mervyn; you are all she
has." "Remember, Mervyn, she has no one but you."
And such admonitions had sunk into his childish heart,
and brought forth abundant fruit as years went on. He
seemed completely to understand his position of "the
only son of his mother, and she was a widow." He was
full of little cares, little attentions; wonderfully thought-
ful for her and careful of her ; unselfish as a woman ;
obedient to her slightest wish. He had never given her
pain in his life, had ever treated her with reverence, and
his childish faults she had always been able to reach
through his affections. Sometimes, reflecting on his
character, she had told herself that he was faultless, mar-
velously perfect. To be sure, he had few temptations.
He was singularly free from the faults of boyhood; but
then his life and position had made him old for his years;
open as the day, but then there had never been any need
8
## p. 86 (#90) ##############################################
86 7A/A'O WAV 7TOGAE 7THEA'.
of concealment. He had always felt himself responsible
for his mother's happiness and well-being, felt it, and
gloried in it; and even rather resented any interference
from relations. Perhaps, if any fault had been engen-
dered by his life with her, it was a slight inclination to
monopolize her attention, and to feel restless and injured
if by any chance he could not get that exclusive devotion
from her to which he was accustomed.
Magdalen had seen it was her duty to prevent his grow-
ing too dependent on her; and made up her mind to
resign his education into other hands, even before she
sent him to school. She had, therefore, made arrange-
ments with the vicar of the parish to receive and teach
him for so many hours a day. No one but herself knew
what a sacrifice it was, nor how she missed his companion-
ship. But where her boy's good was concerned, Magda-
len never thought of herself.
Considering all this, it may well be imagined that Mer-
vyn should be rather surprised at her not discovering he
was late; at her admission that he had startled her; and
at her exclamation, "Is that you, darling?" As if in
wide Wales it could be any one else ! He thought over it
as he sat in the pretty drawing-room after they had had
their tea and his mother had gone up-stairs to put on her
riding-habit; and his reflections were not altogether
pleasant. What could she have been thinking of so earn-
estly when he came in P What was that letter she had in
her hand, to which she did not make any allusion ? Why
had she seemed so anxious to recover it when it fell from
her hand? Was it all connected with something he was
not to know? It was so unusual to find her doing nothing:
she was always occupied about something. Seldom
had he seen her so abstracted. Thinking of this, it for
the first time crossed his mind that she had been rather
## p. 87 (#91) ##############################################
7 HE A/EA'O'.S. AOME. 87
thoughtful ever since they returned to Glen-Mervyn from
London, three weeks ago. Several times he remembered
lately he had found her unoccupied and rather absent, and
was conscious that she had now and then failed a little in
her usual unflagging interest in what he was saying.
What could it all mean, and had it anything to do with
that mysterious letter? And why should he call it mys-
terious, he questioned the next minute. "Mother has no
secrets from me," he mentally exclaimed; "and I shall
ask her all about it directly she comes down. I wonder
why I didn't ask her directly."
And yet he felt there had been something in his moth-
er's face, and in her complete avoidance of any explana-
tion, that would make it difficult to approach the subject
naturally; and if there was to be any constraint, it was
better to leave it alone altogether. Constraint between
him and his mother! The very idea made the poor boy's
lip quiver, and he smiled, or rather tried to smile, at the
bare thought of such a thing; but the smile died away
almost directly, and left his face very grave indeed.
What could it be? Was any misfortune hanging over
them? What misfortune could there be, so long as they
were well and together? Unless The old bugbear
school Could his officious uncle be urging his being
sent there at once, instead of waiting, as had already been
decided, till next Christmas?
Mervyn was accustomed to his uncle's coming forward
on every occasion to further his being sent to school, and
always greatly resented it. What other misfortune could
be impending, if not this?
He brooded over it, making himself quite miserable,
till a sound reached his ears which reassured him at once.
It was his mother's voice from her window overhead,
singing as she dressed; and the voice was so gay, so ring-

ing, that Mervyn forgot his fears directly, and felt his
spirits rise with the clear, high notes of her song, till he
forgot everything in the pleasure of listening to it. His
mother would not sing like that if sorrow were impending.
His mother would not sing like that if he were going to
be taken from her. -
And with a sigh of relief he lay back in an arm-chair,
and told himself he had been frightened for nothing.
He sat there, gazing round the room, and thinking how
pretty it was, and mentally comparing it with the prim
little parlor at the vicarage he had just quitted. With his
mother's voice in his ears, he went off into a reverie about
her. There was no one like her in the wide world,no
one. Everything about her seemed to catch her charm,
and instantly to become different from things about other
people.
How different, for instance, was the room in which he
was sitting from the vicar's prim little drawing-room which
he had just quitted | There was no particular thing he
could take hold of to admire; he was not sufficiently
master of the subject to say wherein consisted its charm ;
he only knew, or rather felt, in a boy's vague way, that it
was all just as perfect as it could be. Wherever the eye
wandered, it rested content. The chairs were just in the
nooks and corners where they were most cosy; there were
pretty little tables, and pretty china in odd corners.
There was no unused look about the room, no stiffness
or formality, yet no untidiness; no lack of signs of em-
ployment, though it had had no occupant, since early
morning, but herself. There was work on one table,
there were books on another; the piano was open, and
the leaves of a piece of music fluttered in the soft wind
that blew in at the window, as if some one had lately
risen from it. There were flowers in different parts of the
## p. 89 (#93) ##############################################
THE HERO'S HOME. 89
room, arranged in a sort of natural luxuriance peculiar to
a lady, to which few others can ever attain. So unlike,
thought Mervyn, the stiff little rows of flowers in the
vicar's "parlor," one row red, one blue, one yellow,
without a leaf or a morsel of green to relieve the mass of
color. As unlike his mother's arrangement as the vicar's
prim maiden sister was unlike his mother herself.
The big bow-window opened on to the garden, and
there again his mother's taste was displayed in the pretty
laying out of the beds, and harmony of color. There
was a pair of gardening gloves, and a watering-pot lying
by one of the beds; everywhere showed signs of life and
employment, though he knew for certain that no one but
herself had been there all day.
A light step sounded on the oak floor outside, and the
concluding words of the song, and then his mother
came in in her riding-habit. She stopped at the table to
take up his hat, and put his books in a heap.
"Untidy boy," she said, smiling; "when will you
remember to leave your hat in the hall?"
Mervyn jumped up to take it away; but Mrs. Lyndsay
stopped him as he was rushing off with it, and said,
"You had better put it on your head instead now,
dear, for the horses are at the door."

WHY MERVYN AND HIS MOTHER WERE LATE FOR DINNER.
IT was a lovely summer evening as mother and son rode
off from the house. Their way lay through the wildest
and most beautiful part of the property; the sun was not
yet beginning to set. Conversation never flagged for a
moment ; questions and answers followed in quick suc-
cession. The hills echoed their merry laughter, and the
sound of Mervyn's shouts to Beth-Gelert. The sun had
sunk to rest some time before they turned their faces
homeward. They rode slowly back to Glen-Mervyn, in
the soft twilight; every now and then disturbed in their
conversation to bid good-night to the passers-by in their
picturesque Welsh attire, returning from their day's work;
or even to rein up their horses altogether, while Mrs.
Lyndsay stopped to inquire into the welfare of those more
particularly known to her.
The ride terminated in a brisk gallop, which brought
them back to Glen-Mervyn just as the dressing-bell was
ringing, and Mrs. Lyndsay, dismounting, ran up to dress.
Mervyn was not so long dressing as she, so he did not
think it necessary to follow her example at once.
He was in high spirits; the thought which had troubled
him had passed away, dispelled by the pleasure of his
ride; and he stood chatting to the groom about an im-
pending cricket-match in the village, in which he was to
take a part, and of which his head was full. He could
have remained there forever, discussing it, and slashing
off the heads of the flowers with his riding-whip; but the

groom was obliged to return to the stables, and so the
conversation came to an end.
Magdalen Lyndsay, meanwhile, now that her boy's
eyes are no longer on her, has returned to the reverie
which his entrance some hours before had interrupted ;
and, leaning against the window in her riding-habit, her
eyes are wandering once more to the old Welsh hills, and
her mind is again revolving the question it was revolving
then. How is she to tell him that which she has to tell?
It is now nearly a fortnight since the question first pre-
sented itself to her mind, and she has found no answer
yet.
The letter received that afternoon has shown her that
she must lose no time; nay, that, if possible, he must be
told this very night. "Oh, no," says a voice in the
mother's heart; "no, not to-night; let him have one
day more | He is so gay, so light-hearted this evening; his
laugh is so ringing, his dear eyes so bright." No 1 not
to-night! not to-night ! It may rain to-morrow, and he
may be less gay; and when the wind sighs round the moun-
tains, and the rain drips against the window, making him
dull and listless, it will be easier for him to hear what she
has to say. But to-night it is so sweet and fair; the air is
so balmy, and all nature seems so gay. The birds and in-
sects are singing and rejoicing; let him share in the glad-
ness to-night. He must not be the one sad thing under
the summer sky | Let him have one more evening in the
garden with his mother all his own. . . . . What a dear
bright face it is The sunny smile and wavy hair, the
frank, sweet mouth, and honest, speaking eyes; how fa-
miliar and how dear is it all to the mother's heart! And
she is to be the one to bring a cloud over it ! Her hand

it up and bear it cheerfully. God knows how Sne has

pain upon him, and darkening, even though she feels it
will be but for a moment, his happy young lifel
And yet it must be done. Already all the arrange-
ments are complete, and on that day three weeks she is
to become Lord Wardlaw's wife. And as yet Mervyn
knows not of the existence of such a person 1 Truly
there is no time to be lost. But Magdalen has had a
hard time of it lately, and she has not trusted herself yet
to speak on the subject to her boy. It is only a fort-
night since she has learned the tale of her husband's
treachery, and scarcely yet has she recovered from the
confusion and indignation into which the revelation has
thrown her. She has been living again lately in that
olden time, and, bit by bit, she has been through it all
once more. First, the quiet life with her father, in their
London home, even, uneventful; she the only young
thing there, with no companions but the two old men.
Then the days when she first knew Charlie Digby. What
a charm his society had brought into her life, even before
love grew up in her heart, when a closer acquaintance
showed him to be all that was manly and true! Then
had followed the intuitive conviction that he loved her,
and the contented waiting on from day to day till he
should speak, while she painted the scene of the happy
future she felt so certain lay before her. Then the rude
shock of his sudden departure without word or sign,
without farewell ; the sudden conviction that she had
deceived herself, and been deceived ; the bitter pain of
the loss of his love, mingled with the wounded pride at
being forsaken. Then the cold blank of life without a
future; the lack of interest in everything; the loss of
faith not only in him, but in the truth and the virtue and
the manliness of which he had been to her the embodi-

ment; the return to the dull, monotonous life with two
old men. Then had come her father's illness and death,
which had, in God's good providence, given a fresh
turn to her thoughts. For the contact with pain and
death had taught her how insignificant is life, how fleet-
ing its joys, and how short-lived its sorrows. Face to
face with the tremendous reality of death, all else had
seemed to her shadowy, and life dwarfed by the thought
of eternity.
In this frame of mind had she met the advances of the
man who became her husband. It seemed to her to matter
so little, and to be for such a very little while. Also she
was lonely and desolate, and filled with gratitude to her
only friend, whose fidelity contrasted so favorably with
the changeability of the man who she had fancied loved
her. At once and forever she had cast aside all longings
and repinings, sealed up the past, and striven to put it
away. Charles Digby passed out of her life, and she
gave herself heart and soul to her new duties. So much
so, that when, after all those years, they met again, and,
as we have seen, he asked her to link her fate with his, she
felt it was impossible. That part of her life seemed so far
away, it so completely belonged to her youth, that she felt
quite unable to revive it. In fact, it seemed to her almost
ridiculous that he should ask it. Besides, she had been
disappointed in him. All that in Charles Digby had called
forth her affection had proved to be her own creation;
and the man she had loved had not been he, but a being
of her own imagination, endowed with qualities which he
did not possess.
She was too kind to tell him all this, but she firmly and
definitely refused; and, without giving him time to pro-
test, she left London, as we have seen, and returned home.
Nor did she repent her decision. "Oh, no l'' she said

to herself often, as she thought it over in the calm soli-
tude of Glen-Mervyn. "Oh, no. I am too old now to
begin a fresh life, and I have seen too many changes to
wish for more. I am happy and content in my present
life, and I ask for nothing else. Besides, there is Mervyn.
I am not free to choose my own life. I am a mother, and
motherhood and its duties are my life now. I live for him,
not for myself. My life is laid out for me, and I have
neither the wish nor the strength to begin life all over
again."
And in this frame of mind had Magdalen remained till
the news contained in her brother's letter threw all her
thoughts into confusion.
Colonel Middleton had never said a truer thing in his
life than when he told his friend that, in withholding the
truth from her, Lord Wardlaw was neglecting the most
powerful argument in his own favor, her sense of justice
being so strong. For she never hesitated from that mo-
ment as to what path to pursue. All the objections and
all the arguments she had previously raised in her own
mind, which seemed to her then so convincing and satis-
factory, gave way before the one great motive of repairing
that old injustice, and striving to atone for that past which
she could never, never undo.
At once her mind was made up. She received her
brother's letter one sunny morning while Mervyn was at
the vicarage; and long before he returned home the letter
which conveyed the expression of her determination was
on its way to London. When he came bounding home
in the afternoon, the promise which was to work such a
change in his life was given, the days of his life alone
with his mother were numbered ; their happy dual soli-
tude was already drawing to a close. He came along
singing and jumping, making straight for the tree where
## p. 95 (#99) ##############################################
A TE FOR DIAWAVER. 95
she was sitting; with his eyes full of love, and his ears
awaiting her words of loving welcome.
And she, stunned and bewildered still, with her past
and her present all marred and mingled, all linked and
yet distorted, watched him blankly as he came along,
almost shrinking from the sight of him she loved so dearly,
when she remembered whose son he was. Yet, by the
time he reached her, she had so far controlled herself
that there was nothing unusual in her manner, and he
noticed nothing but that she looked pale and tired; and
in his pretty, protecting way, he inquired if she had a
headache, and ran off to hurry the afternoon tea. His
loving little attentions brought tears into her eyes, those
eyes that had been so dry and hard all day. She had in-
deed spent a terrible afternoon. The revelation of her
husband's treachery had thrown all her past into confu-
sion, and turned all her life into a sham. It seemed to
her that the whole thing, with all its aims and motives,
had been a delusion, a chimera, a thing of her own imagi-
nation. Gratitude had been the mainspring of all her
actions, the governing impulse of her life; and now to
find she owed him none
All her devotion to him in his lifetime, all her respect
for his memory and his wishes since his death, all turned
into foolishness and mockery. Love she had never natu-
rally felt for him, but by infinite efforts, aided by her deep
gratitude, she had attained to something like its counter-
feit. And all the time she had owed him no gratitude,
no respect even, no veneration,-nothing ! Less than
nothing, worse than nothing, only contemptuous indig-
nation and a burning sense of wrong.
All was chaos in her past; and she looked back upon
it, bewildered. The duty she had striven to fulfill to one
man she had all the time owed to another; the feelings

she had created and encouraged were those which ought
never to have existed, while those she had struggled to
stifle were just those she ought to have cherished.
Had she ever, in all her life, she asked herself, done
what was right, or properly understood one human being
with whom she had been thrown? Their images were
now all so changed and confused that not one remained
to her what she had fancied it to be. The kind old patron
of her youth was lost in the designing, treacherous friend,
and merged again in the over-affectionate and exacting
husband. The Charlie Digby of her early days was not
the Lord Wardlaw of to-day, but a mixture of what she
had at first believed him, what she had afterwards sup-
posed him, and what she had since discovered him to be:
three distinct characters, now all confused together.
The father she had loved and venerated was gone, so
changed that he seemed to be a stranger, for he had been
privy to the deception, and his image could never again
be to her the untarnished memory it had hitherto been.
No one remained familiar ; and she seemed to have been
living all her days deceived,entangled in a web of de-
lusions. And Magdalen, torn from all her accustomed
moorings, felt herself drifting out into a sea of darkness
and doubt.
From such shipwreck as this her boy's lips on her fore-
head saved her; and the tears which his caresses brought
to her eyes, while they dimmed her outward vision, dis-
pelled her mental blindness, and she saw one light in the
darkness, one spar to which she might cling, her child I

her, his figure was the clearest and the most familiar.
Her years of motherhood extended over a space of time
compared to which her early friendship seemed a moment,
and her married life a dream. " The very thought of him
enabled her to shake off her misty retrospection, and to
return to the present moment. The dim figures fled away,
and that of her boy took their place. They might seem
shadowy and unreal, but there was nothing unreal about
him. The past was her own and theirs: it was gone,
past recall; there was no use dwelling upon it. What
she could do to repair it she had done, and dreaming over
it was idle and vain. But this young fresh life by her
side, with whom the past has nothing to do, he has his
part in her present and her future, and his must be con-
sidered too. The pure unselfishness of a mother's love
made her forget her share in the matter, and turn her
thoughts to his. How would the new future appear to
him P
This question she felt was, after all, the most important
now, and to find an answer to it her attention must be
given. How was she to tell him of the change which
was coming? It was a difficulty that must be faced and
surmounted, and she roused herself and gave her mind to
the task.
To this frame of mind she had arrived when he re-
turned with the tea; and as she met the loving glance of
his eye, and marked the delight he took in ministering to
her wants, a fear came into her heart of how her news
would affect him. As she thought of how completely he
had had her to himself all these years, and how accus-
tomed he had always been to look upon her as his exclu-
sive possession, the fear increased, and she resolved to
put off the announcement for the present. She had gone
through so much of agitation already, she had not the

strength to encounter more. So she left the morrow to
take care of itself, and gave herself up unrestrainedly to
the pleasure of her boy's society and the charm of his
light-heartedness and youth.
"Why should I make him sad before the time?" she
asked herself; and she lay back in her chair, watching
him, and listening to him, rejoicing to see him so gay.
He was always full of life and spirits, but that day he had
seemed even more joyful than usual. His father had
been of a morbid, mopy disposition, but the boy in-
herited from his mother the happy quality of turning every
little thing into enjoyment, and finding amusement every-
where.
As he sat there, chatting and laughing, recounting little
things that had happened at the vicarage, his mother
gazed at him with fond pride and affection ; and the heart
that had so lately glowed with contemptuous indignation
towards the father was filled with loving admiration
for the son. Then, when she met the honest speaking
eyes, and drank in the frank open smile, she inwardly
murmured, "Thank God there is nothing of his father
about him. Thank God he never knew him, cannot
remember ever to have seen him."
Day after day from that time she had put off telling
him what she knew would cause him pain. Every day
she said to herself, "To-morrow." Yet when the mor-
row came she had ever some reason to assign to herself
why it should be put off still.
It is now, as we have said, nearly a fortnight since her
resolution was taken. The letter she has received to-
day has shown her the announcement cannot be delayed;
and yet here she is, leaning against the window-sill, as
unwilling as ever to obtrude it upon his sunny path. The
mother's voice within her is ever the most powerful, and

insists on making itself heard. "Not to-night ! not to-
night I let him have one day more l''
The worst of it was, she had not only to announce the
unwelcome news, but to prepare him for an almost imme-
diate parting with herself. On that intermediate separa-
tion, that impending parting, she could not dwell herself
for a moment without a tightening at her throat, and a
strange thrill at her heart. How, then, could she expect
it of him P
He was to spend the time of her absence at his uncle's;
but as Colonel Middleton and his family would not be
settled in the country till after her marriage, Mervyn
must be left under the vicar's charge for at least a week
or ten days, if the vicar would consent to the arrange-
ment. But she had not yet consulted him on the subject,
for she did not like Mervyn to be the last to hear of what
concerned him so much the most nearly.
All this made it very necessary that Mervyn should be
soon told, and Magdalen resolved that she would not put
off the announcement later than the following day. The
gong sounded as she came to this resolution, and with a
start she remembered that she had not begun to dress.
Mervyn, meanwhile, all unconscious, was dressing him-
self for dinner with all his might. I say with all his
might, for he had a way of getting engrossed heart and
soul in the different details of his toilette, common to
some boys of his age. For instance, washing his hands
became, under the earnest attention he gave to it, a
process for the manufacture of soap-suds, with which his
basin was presently filled. Plunged up to elbows in the
soft creamy mess, he enjoyed some delicious moments.
As the soap-suds increased in size and beauty, a bright
idea seized him, and, withdrawing his arms from the
basin, he fetched from among a heap of treasures an old

pipe, and forthwith began blowing soap-bubbles. The
five-minutes' bell startled him in the midst of his opera-
tions, and in a great flurry he brought them to a close.
Next came his hair, which he brushed and combed with
the utmost violence. Then he plastered it down with
both hands, and advanced to the looking-glass to see the
result.
To his dismay, he found it was guiltless of a parting,
and with a sigh he resigned himself to the necessity of
making one. This was always a great undertaking, and
he tried and tried again to make a straight one, but to
no purpose. No one could have accused him of not
taking pains about it, for he dug the comb into his head
with an energy for which he suffered all the evening. At
last something like a successful result was obtained, and,
after gazing at it in the glass for some minutes with great
admiration, he proceeded to put on his jacket and to
pull off his boots. Just at this moment the gong sounded.
Thereupon ensued a tremendous hunt for his shoes, his
flurry augmented by the consternation into which the
unexpected sound had thrown him. He looked under
the bed, he groped on all fours under the sofa, he made
himself quite flat and forced himself under the wardrobe;
he looked in all the most possible and all the most im-
possible places, and finally discovered they had been at
his side all the time. He sprang to his feet when they
were on, and made for the door. Full tilt he came right
against the water-jug, which he had inadvertently placed
in the middle of the room, and down it went, its con-
tents wildly rushing in every direction. Who does not
know the feeling of utter hopelessness which attends such
a calamity | First comes the horrible suspicionfor it is
only a suspicion at firstthat foot or gown has caught the

hope that it may rock back to its place, to catch the
sound of which the expectant ear listens eagerly. But
no such sound comes; only a dull thud as the jug rolls
over on the floor, and in a moment the stream is rushing
in two or three different channels to all parts of the
room. What a feeling of utter despair of ever being
able to cope with such an accident How hurriedly the
question glances through the mind as to whether the
sponges or the towels shall be sacrificed Hasty recol-
lections of the aspect of the sponges, after doing service
on the last occasion of the kind, sweep through the mind,
and produce an inward shrinking from subjecting them to
a similar operation. But there is never time for thought.
Whatever is to be done has to be done quickly, for while
you are reflecting one stream is nearing a row of boots
and slippers, while another is making stealthy advances
to the gown you have just thrown off, which has acci-
dentally slipped from the bed, and a third is seen creep-
ing out under the door, with the obvious intention of
taking a turn in the passage. If, to add to your anxiety,
the accident occurs in a friend's house, and you know
that that friend is particular about his furniture, has
lately carpeted his rooms, and perhaps occupies himself
the room underneath, of which the ceiling has just been
whitewashed, the situation is indeed terrible. I am not
sure that in any case (speaking from the depths of a vast
experience) instant flight is not the most satisfactory solu-
tion of the difficulty, leaving who may, or who will, to
repair the mischief. At any rate, Mervyn came to that
conclusion, after one hasty glance at the hurrying stream.
And then he ran down the stairs, two steps at a time, and
burst into the drawing-room, with a confused account of
the circumstances which had detained him, in which soap-
suds and partings, shoes and water-jugs, were mixed in

so vague a manner that his mother would have been
hopelessly bewildered, if she had been there. But, to
Mervyn's surprise, he found he was speaking to the air,
for the room was empty

BREAKING THE NEWS.
BEFORE he had time to wonder at his mother's unusual
unpunctuality, she came into the room behind him ; and
in his eagerness to begin his story all over again, he lost
sight of it. He followed her into the dining-room, talk-
ing all the way, and they sat down to dinner. The long
meditation up-stairs had left its traces on Magdalen Lynd-
say's calm sweet face, and she was rather silent and
thoughtful. But she strove to shake it off, and to enter
into what her boy was saying.
Having finished his story about the water-jug, he
branched off to another subject.
"Mother, you'll come and look at the cricket-match, of
course."
"The cricket-match, dear? what cricket-match?"
"Why, the cricket-match, mother; the one I'm going
to play in, you know, Married vs. Single."
"Oh the village cricket-match. Yes; I had for-
gotten. Which side did you say you played on, dear?"
Mervyn's look of astonishment recalled her to herself,
and she laughed. Mervyn laughed too, though he felt a
little injured that so important an event should not have
taken more hold upon his mother's memory and atten-
tion.

"I beg your pardon, dear," she said; "I was not
thinking of what I was saying." And she laughed
again.
"But, mother, do think now," he said, eagerly, "be-
cause it's so important. The vicar thinks I shall be a
great addition to his side. (He plays on the Single, you
know.) Isn't that pleasant to think of P" he added,
earnestly. -
If his mother did not quite enter into the delights of
the position, at any rate she thought it pleasant to see the
bright face and sparkling eyes with which the question
was put.
"Yes, my darling," she answered, tenderly.
"And you'll come, won't you, mother dear? There'll
be a nice little tent for you to sit in, quite away from the
crowd; and then I'll come and talk to you between my
turns. You'll like to see me get a lot of runs, won't you?
Promise to come !"
"I shall certainly come if" She broke off sud-
denly. "If I am here," she was going to say, but she
stopped just in time.
"When is the match P'' she concluded.
"To-morrow week is the Married vs. Single, and a fort-
night after Glen-Mervyn plays the village club. I am in
both, so you can take your choice. But I think you had
better come to both. There is nothing to prevent it, you
know," he added, with a little laugh.
Nothing to prevent it ! No 1 Nothing; except that
by that time she would be Lord Wardlaw's wife, hundreds
of miles away.
The thought smote upon her so sharply; it came so
vividly before her that he would be playing his cricket-
matches as usual, and that she would be far away. It
brought the thought of parting so near, and the pain of it

so clearly, that she hastily drank off a glass of water to
hide the emotion she could not repress.
"Let us finish dinner quickly, darling," she said, hur-
riedly, "and then we will go and sit in the garden. It is
such a lovely night. In fact, I think I will leave you to
finish alone, for I want to get out into the air." And she
rose from her chair as she spoke. Mervyn looked rather
surprised at the suddenness of the arrangement.
"Why, mother you have had no strawberries and
cream, and I was going to make you such a nice mess."
"I don't want any to-night, dear," she answered, rather
faintly, as she gained the door; but by an irresistible
impulse she returned to his side, and put her arms round
his neck.
"God bless you, my darling ! my darling !" she whis-
pered, as she kissed him.
"I shan't be long, mother dear," he said, warmly re-
turning her caresses; and before the door had closed
behind her, he was absorbed in his strawberry mess. He
followed her in about ten minutes, and found her sitting
outside the window in the twilight, on a low garden-chair.
At her request he fetched her a white shawl, and, after
putting it over her shoulders, he sat down on the grass by
her side, put his head against her knees, and got possession
of one of her hands.
"Now for a nice talk, mother."
"What shall we talk about, darling?" she said. "I
think you must begin to-night. This lovely evening has
set me dreaming, and I can think of nothing to say."
"It is very beautiful, isn't it?" said the boy, following
his mother's gaze over lake and mountain, lit up by the
silvery moon; but his child's mind only grasped the ex-
ternal beauty of the familiar landscape (admired and
loved, childlike, because it was familiar), while hers had

wandered off to dim imaginings of that internal beauty,
of which all that is most lovely here is but the faint and
imperfect expression,-an attempt to render to our finite
comprehension the grace and glory of that which is infi-
nite and unseen.
"I love Glen-Mervyn so much, mother: don't you?
There is no place like it in the world, I think."
Mervyn's "world" was rather limited, being confined
to Glen-Mervyn and London. But his mother did not
damp the outpourings of his feelings by pointing this out.
"It is quite right, darling, that you should love your
home, and I am glad you do. We have lived in it so
many years now, you and I." .
"So many years," repeated Mervyn; "ever since I was
born, mother, haven't we, you and I ?"
And he repeated the words "you and I" with a sense
of fond proud appropriation, while he tightened his grasp
on his mother's hand.
"And I should like to go on living here forever,
mother," he burst out again, after a few minutes' silence;
"just you and I, only you and I."
And he repeated "you and I," in the same tone as
before.
"You will talk differently in a few years, Mervyn," she
answered, with a laugh which was half a sigh.
"Never, mother," he returned, with all the positive
confidence of youth, which, feeling itself so warm and
faithful, cannot grasp the idea of change.
"I should like everything to go on forever as it is, with
no alteration of any kind."
"Oh, but that is impossible, my darling. In this world
changes must come. Look how many occur every mo-
ment round you. The laws of our being and of nature
proclaim that change must be. The child changes into

the man, the bud into the flower, and the blossom into
the fruit. We should not desire it otherwise, of course,
and there is nothing painful in it; but still it is so. The
evening we are enjoying now is not the evening we were
enjoying three hours ago. The evening has turned to
twilight, and the twilight to night. The very bit of blue
sky I found it so pleasant to rest my eyes on when we first
came out, admiring its calm blank space, is now glittering
with innumerable stars. Nothing seems to remain the
same for a moment."
"Yes, mother," said Mervyn, restlessly, "I know
things change; but people, mother, and feelings, they
don't change."
Such a curious look passed over her face at his words.
Three times she seemed about to speak with some excite-
ment, but checked herself each time.
"You and I, for instance, mother; we do not change."
"And do you really think, Mervyn, that you are not
changed, from the little tottering thing, with long hair
and blue shoes, that used to patter about on this terrace
and ride on Beth-Gelert's back P I pity Beth-Gelert, if
you take to such horsemanship now," she added, laughing.
Mervyn laughed too, though he was rather bored.
"I forgot," he said.
He knew by experience what it was for his mother's
sense of humor to be tickled ; and it hurt his dignity to
see he had made himself ridiculous.
"I beg your pardon, dear," she said, still laughing;
"but the idea of your not having changed since you
were a baby amused me so. But I promise to be very
grave now."
"Well, mother," he said, eagerly, returning to his
point, "it is only while one is growing that there are such
great changes. Now, you, at any rate, have not changed.

I can't remember you the least different from what you
are now."
"Even there, Mervyn, I cannot agree with you. You
may not notice it, but I am by no means the girl I was
when I first brought you, a baby, to Glen-Mervyn. Oh,
dear, no l'" she went on, half to herself, as she leaned back
in her chair and went off into a reverie; "very different.
In thought, in ideas, in everything. It would be strange,
indeed, if I were quite the same. I should not wish it,
Mervyn. I should be sorry to think I were not changed."
"Do you mean changed to look at, mother?"
"No. I was not thinking of appearance then," she
answered, "so much as mind and feeling. For change
in them, I hope, means improvement, progress; and in
that sense I love change."
"And I don't, mother," said Mervyn, very decidedly;
"in every sense I hate changes. I think they are horrid."
"You have not seen many," she said, smiling.
"No more have you: have you, mother?"
Again the curious look came into her face, and her
eyes shone with a look which was half sad, half agitated.
Mervyn noticed it this time; he drew near and kissed
her, whispering, "I forgot."
For he thought she was thinking of his dead father.
She returned his caresses fondly, but she did not speak;
and he meanwhile, with his hand locked in hers, was
going through a certain train of thought which always
came upon him when the subject of that father was
which was very rarelymentioned between them. He
hardly dared confess even to himself how much he dis-
liked his mother having a past with which he had nothing
to do, and how much he inwardly rejoiced that she was
all his own, and that there was no father to come in
between them. Even to her he had never hinted at this,

and she had no idea of it. It was a curious part of the
boy's affection that his greatest pleasure in it was that
sense of monopoly, that feeling of appropriation. It was
the reflection that no one but himself had the right to
her which made him so happy in her possession.
His mother's voice quite startled him when she spoke
again.
"No, Mervyn," she said, taking up the conversation
from its starting-point; "it is no use battling with the
truth. Changes must be. We may fight against them,
and stretch out our hands to beat them away and keep
them back, crying that they shall not, must not come ;
but it is only the foolish beating of the caged bird against
the bars, and quite as vain and hopeless; for come they
will, bringing with them joy or sorrow, as may be the
will of Him who ordained and foresaw them from the
first. And in the end we see it was best."
"Mother," said the boy, rather fearfully, "don't
Why do you talk like this?"
"I had a letter to-day, Mervyn, from a very old friend;
and it is the consideration of all the changes that have come
on me since first we were friends together that has set me
thinking so of change. When I was a young girl we saw
much of each other. Then, his way in life lay in one
road, mine in another, and so we parted. It may be that
in those young days we two dreamed as little of changes
being possible as you do now. And yet they came, Mer-
vyn; yet they came ! Thank God I'" she added, dreamily,
"there is a land where changes cannot come; but it is
not here, Mervyn,-not here !"
"But, mother," urged the boy, "why do you talk so P
You frighten me; for you talk as if a change were com-
ing. Why do you?"
"Because, my darling, a change is coming, and I want

to prepare you for it. I had not meant to speak of it to-
night; but, as our talk has taken this turn, the way seems
paved for me to tell you of that which is coming into our
lives, and which I humbly trust will bring happiness to us
both." -
"What is it, mother?" said Mervyn, in a very low voice.
"In the old days, dear, of which I have been speaking,
I remember two old men, who had been friends from their
earliest boyhood. The one was rich and unmarried; the
other poor, a widower, with a grown-up daughter and a
married son. They lived in London. The rich friend,
out of his abundance, was always showering his gifts on
the poor friend and his daughter. It was he who provided
the horse she daily rode, and contributed to many other
little enjoyments and comforts which her father would not
have been able to afford for her. It was his interest that
had procured the married son a commission in the Guards;
and he it was who had introduced to him the woman he
had married. He was a constant visitor at the house,
always welcomed with delight by the father, and held in
great esteem by the girl herself. Another constant visitor
was a young man of the name of Charles Digby. He
was the younger son of Lord Wardlaw, and was amusing
himself in London previous to beginning his diplomatic
career. Both father and daughter enjoyed his society.
His companionship had a great charm for the young girl,
who had always been, more or less, as you are, Mervyn,
a solitary child; and who had never known what it was
to have a companion of her own age, her brother being
so many years older than she. Suddenly his visits ceased ;
but before the girl had time to begin to wonder what had
become of him, her father announced to her his intention
of going to the sea-side for change of air, and they almost
immediately left town. The young girl missed her com-

panion sorely, and felt a little hurt that he had not come
to wish her good-by ; when, on questioning her father,
she found Charlie Digby had obtained the appointment
for which he had been waiting, and was now on his way
to Madrid. However, the sudden and dangerous illness
of her father put all other thoughts out of her head. He
died ; and the girl found herself, a few weeks after leaving
London, alone, penniless, and dependent on her married
brother with his large family. Pitying, no doubt, her
friendless condition, her father's friend asked her whether
she could bear the disparity of years between them, and
become his wife. She consented, and for eighteen months
he made her a kind and indulgent husband. Then he
died. Meanwhile years rolled on. By the successive
deaths of his father and brothers, Charlie Digby succeeded
to the family honors, and returned to England. He met
once more the friend of his youth; the old intimacy was
renewed; the old delight in each other's society revived,
and he asked her to become his wife. And now, Mer-
vyn, have you any idea why I have told you this story?"
"No, mother," answered the boy. "It's awfully in-
teresting ; but I don't know why you have told it to me."
"How tiresome of you, dear!" she said, laughing; but
her smile died away as she thought she perceived a certain
sort of anxiety in the boy's face which seemed to contra-
dict his words.
"I have told it to you, darling, because all the people
therein mentioned concern you very nearly. Think it
over, bit by bit, before I tell you their names."
She waited a minute, and then said, slowly and dis-
tinctly, "The names of the two old men were William
Middleton andMervyn Lyndsay; and the girl's name
Magdalen."

AA'A2AATIAWG 7. HE AWE W.S. III
There was a long silence after Mrs. Lyndsay had spoken;
and in the calm stillness of the summer evening Mervyn's
quick breathing could be distinctly heard.
It may be that the old story had for a moment revived
the old feelings in Magdalen's breast, for the next words
were spoken dreamily,more to herself than to the boy:
"By the recollection of the long, long years of separa-
tion, he urged her not to refuse him; by his loneliness
and exile in a foreign land, he prayed her to make him
happy now, andshe consented."
Mrs. Lyndsay paused again, but the silence was not
broken. Mervyn remained sitting where he was, with his
head against her knees, and he neither spoke nor moved.
Mrs. Lyndsay, knowing his impetuous, excitable nature,
marveled to find him take the news so quietly. She won-
dered what was passing in his mind, and longed to take
one look at his face; but in the position in which he was
sitting it was hidden from her, and she felt it was better
not to disturb him, or to force him to speak too soon.
She knew some time must be allowed for the shock of a
piece of utterly unexpected intelligence, but she had not
expected that Mervyn would be able to restrain for so long
expression of some kind, accustomed as he was to pour
forth to her at once all that was in his thoughts. For
there was never restraint of any kind between them. His
face was like a glass to her, in which every passing thought,
however fleeting, was reflected. How well she knew the
eager way in which his ideas came bubbling up from his
lips, helter-skelter, anyhow, in his hurry to make her par-
ticipate in them | She had expected an outburst, and had
nerved herself to meet it; but this long delay she had not
been prepared for, and she began to think he had more
self-control than she had given him credit for.
She had revolved in her own mind for some time past
## p. 112 (#116) ############################################
II 2 7THA'O WAV 7 OGAE 7"HER.
all the stories she had heard and read of step-children and
step-parents, stories telling of jars in family life, of petty
jealousies, and ill behavior on both sides; stories the
recollection of which had made her shrink from the idea
of such elements of discord in her home, and the thought
of which had made her dread more than anything else
breaking the news to her boy, lest he should in his de-
meanor disclose a lurking in his breast of some such feel-
ings. For there was in Magdalen Lyndsay's spirit a
profound contempt of anything small and petty; and she
had always so gloried in the grand broad lines of Mer-
vyn's character,-grand because simple, broad because so
true and unselfish.
And now she began to think with pride and hope that
he was not going to disappoint her; that he was above all
these little feelings; that the frank, generous nature she
had always so delighted in was coming to his help now,
and that he would stand the test. Nay, more; that there .
was nothing selfish in his fond, proud appropriation of
herself, but that in his loving devotion there were deeps
which even she had not fathomed or suspected; and as she
thought of it, her love and admiration deepened.
But she began to wish he would speak. This pent-up
reserve was not natural to him, and at last she felt she
must hear what his feelings were. So, laying her hand
caressingly on his hair, she tried to turn his hidden face
towards herself, saying, in a fond, low tone, in which
all her love and all her admiration seemed to express
itself,
"Speak to me, my darling."
And then the burst came, with such passionate grief and
despair that she was appalled at his violence, and merely
gazed at him, astonished.
"Mother mother l'' he exclaimed ; and he started to

his feet and wrung his hands; "Oh mother 1 mother
mother l''
Mrs. Lyndsay did not check him, or try to make him
control himself, though she had never in his life seen him
give way in this manner before. Turning her eyes from
the face of the agitated boy to the calm star-lit sky above,
she breathed a silent prayer for him and for herself, and
then she waited to calm herself before speaking to him.
She needed calming, for she was startled and alarmed,
disappointed too; yea, evenfor she was but humana
little indignant. For there was in his manner as much of
anger as of sorrow ; as much, I had almost said, of defiance
in his passionate cry of "Mother, mother," as of broken-
hearted entreaty; as much of "you shall not do this
thing," as of "you will not, you can not, you surely do
not mean to l''
And Magdalen was high-spirited as he ; and for an
instant her eyes had the self-same sparkle in them which
was flashing from both of his. But only for a moment.
It faded away directly, and gave place to a mournful,
pitying light, which melted the boy at once, and caused
him to throw himself at her knees, and exclaim, in a less
passionate, more despairing tone,
"Oh, mother, say you do not mean it; say it is all a
mistake."
"I cannot say so, Mervyn."
The low, sweet voice so dearly loved, thrilled through
the boy, and woke up his love with greater force than ever;
woke up, too, the feeling of blind resentment, which her
loving look had melted; and he ground his teeth together
in his effort to keep back the torrent of words which rose
to his lips, but which, in spite of himself, escaped almost
before he was aware:
"You shall not do it ! I won't have it ! I hate him '''

"Mervyn !"
Frightened into silence by the stern indignant tone, so
unlike what he was accustomed to hear from his mother's
lips, the boy stood, breathless, with the tears standing in
his angry gleaming eyes.
Magdalen had risen as she spoke, and she now stood
confronting him, pressing both her hands together, in her
effort to keep back the angry feelings which were rising in
her breast, while she told herself she was as bad as he if
she allowed herself to be overcome by them.
Mother and son struggled together to overcome the
same spirit which strove to master them, and which, in all
their lives, till that moment, neither had ever brought to
bear one against the other. And Magdalen was victorious.
Her deep mother's love came to her help, and she re-
solved as she stood to put self on one side altogether,
and by the might of that love to bear with him patiently.
Then she sat down, and drew the boy towards her; but,
to her surprise, he resisted, and even shook her hand off
his shoulder. She was deeply hurt. For the first time in
his life he had failed in his loving respect for her. She
had never been wounded through him before, and it cut
her to the heart.
Was this the beginning of the end ? she asked herself.
Was the step she was about to take to entail forever this
sort of thing upon her? was all her past life of devo-
tion to go for nothing? and were his love and veneration
to give way at the first check? Back to the sunny past
on which her thoughts had been so lately dwelling, they
traveled before she could stop them ; and it seemed so
hard, so very hard. She mightshe told herself, as they
raced in hot haste through her brain, till her own side of
the question came so vividly before her that she had

his father's unworthy conduct, and shown him how much
more that other was the injured one than he. She might
have told him of her blighted early life, separated from
the lover of her youth, and married to the very man by
whose means that separation had, -unknown to herself,
been effected. Her thoughts were in a whirl of agita-
tion, and she felt there was nothing she might not with
justice say. But Magdalen was a woman and a mother.
She could not, and would not, disclose such things to a
child, and that child her own son.
It was only for a moment that the thought of all these
things overcame her; and then came to her help the
habit which was with her a second nature, of lowering her
thoughts to his level, and seeing things from his point of
view. So she stamped out past recollections which might
weaken her for the present, and looked out upon it all
with her boy's eyes. And as she looked, she saw ; and
as she saw, she pitied ; and as she pitied, she forgave.
And she drew him, in spite of his resistance, to her, and
she laid his head on her breast, and tenderly she soothed
and kissed him till she conquered; for, worn out by the
very force of his emotions, Mervyn was glad to forget
everything but the pleasure of resting his throbbing head
and feeling her cool lips on his hot, smarting eyelids.
There was a silence of some minutes, and then she
said, softly,
"My poor boy; I am so sorry to see you like this
The words were so gentle, and the voice so sorrowful,
that a wild hope shot through Mervyn's breast. She who
had never, as long as he could remember, failed to do
away with, to the utmost of her power, anything that
gave him sorrow, would she not now, that she saw she
was making him miserable, give way to him and make
him happy?
## p. 116 (#120) ############################################

"Mother, mother why should it be?"
No answer; only soft kisses on his eyelids and the
caressing touch of her hand on his hair.
"Mother, darling ! you have me; what else can you
want?'' -
"What am I to say, my boy? what can I do to com-
fort you?"
"Give it up! Oh, mother, give it up !"
"Poor boy my own dear boy ''
The tender answers, so loving and yet so completely
apart from his questions, pretending so little to be re-
plies to them, fell mournfully on the boy's ear. He
recognized in them intuitively the "mind-made-up tone,"
against which there was no appeal; felt that, in his vain
struggling and repining, he was but dashing himself against
a rock,-the rock of his mother's will ; of her firm, unal-
terable decision. And he felt, though he could not have
described it, that it was bitter to hear loving words from
the very source of his woe ; and to know that there was
neither the will nor the power there to alter what was to
come to pass, even though he, whom she loved so well and
would shield from all pain, desired so earnestly to avert
it, that it seemed as if his very longing must keep it away;
that what he dreaded so intensely was impossible, could
not be ; and there was in his heart that tumult which, had
it taken shape in words, would have escaped in the pas-
sionate cry of the Psalmist, "If it had been an open
enemy that had done me this dishonor, I could have
borne it ; but it was even thou.''
While he was thinking, Magdalen remained silent, only
now and then passing her hand gently over his hair.
When he seemed to be calm and quiet, she spoke again.
"Now, darling," she said, gently, "let us talk it out.
Ask yourself calmly what it is you dread so much in this.
## p. 117 (#121) ############################################
AA'A2AA ZAVG THE AWE W.S. 117
Perhaps we shall find you are making a mountain out of
a mole-hill, after all."
A sound broke from Mervyn, savoring so strongly of
anger that Magdalen stopped speaking, and felt rather
disheartened. But she was determined not to give it up,
but to conquer by gentleness.
"I will bear with him to the end," she murmured, "so
help me God I'' -
But she sighed as she said it, for she saw her boy was
going to test to the utmost her love and forbearance.
Then, lowering herself once more to his level, she saw
that in his present state of agitated feeling it would not
do to treat his sorrow too lightly. She must try to feel
it as he felt it, and to argue it out from his point of view.
If one method failed, she would try another; and if all
were fruitless, she would appeal to his love for her.
"Mervyn, have you forgotten you are going to school
after Christmas?"
A vehement shake of the head was the answer, as much
as to say, "How could I forget anything so disagreeable?"
"Have you ever thought it over, dear, at all?"
"Never, mother."
"You have a wonderful power, Mervyn, of putting
away from your thoughts anything you do not wish to
think of, haven't you ? It is a happy knack. But it is
only a knack. I cannot give it a higher name. I have
been thinking it is perhaps braver to look things firmly in
the face than to put them so entirely away." She looked
at him a minute, to see how far she might go, and added,
"Will you be brave, my darling, and face the future
for a moment with me?"
But Mervyn's head went down again directly, and she
saw him shrink into himself. Zhat failed, but she would
not be discouraged.

"Very well, darling," she said. "I will not ask you
to do it if it pains you. Will you try, instead, to tell me
what it is you dread so much in the idea of the future of
which I have told you?"
A hundred ideas rushed through the boy's brain, but
not one could he put into words. His breast heaved and
his eyes moistened every time he attempted to speak.
The future seemed so dark, and such a complication
of miseries, that the very thought of it deprived him of
voice wherewith to express one.
His mother saw how it was. "Never mind, dear,"
she said, with a sigh: " leave it for the present; we will
talk of it some other time. That is to say, of your part
in it. Now we will talk of mine."
This was her last resource,an appeal to his feelings
for her sake; and it succeeded directly; for it made
Mervyn feel as if he had been selfish, and he drew closer
to her, and listened with all his might.
"Let me go back to what I was saying. About your
going to school. Well ! I do not share your happy
knack of putting that out of my head. It has been
constantly present to me for many months past, and the
thought of how dull and lonely I shall be without you
has made me feel very sad. And it is only the begin-
ning of the end, you know ; only the beginning of the
end."
"How do you mean, mother ?" asked the boy.
"Ah, Mervyn, I am braver than you, for I have faced
the future and told myself that a month at Christmas, six
weeks at Midsummer, and three weeks at Easter, is all
that I shall see of my boy, my sole and constant com-
panion of so many years. I have gone further, and told

But at this point Mervyn broke in with such vehement
declarations of the impossibility of his ever loving any
one half or a quarter as much as he did her, that she was
obliged to stop, laughing.
"Oh, Mervyn, Mervyn, you will think differently some
day ! And I, for one, should be sorry to think you should
have nothing better to love than such an old woman as I
shall be by that time. But I know," she added, tenderly,
"it is impossible for the young to realize such things, so
you must believe me, my boy, though you cannot under-
stand it yourself. And you must try and see that, though
I would not have it otherwise, the pondering on these
things has made me feel that my life henceforth will not

She broke off with a smile, and her eyes wandered
away again to the silvery moon.
"And so?" questioned Mervyn; "so what, mother?"

sent back to me the friend of my youth, to bring a new
interest into the life that was going to be so lonely, and
to be to me the companion and protector which you, my
boy, cannot at a distance be. And you, Mervyn, if your
love for me is as real and unselfish as I have always be-
lieved it to be, far from regretting, should rejoice that

be grateful to this friend who will guard and cherish me

wisdom and judgment, by none of these usually powerful
agents had the boy been anyway moved or swayed for a
minute.
But love had been stronger than fear, stronger than
habit, stronger than faith even. She had touched the
right chord at last, and silenced at once all jars in his
heart. Nothing else would have won him, nothing !
Her years of devotion had not been wasted, after all.
The foundation of her power stood certain, being rooted
in love. She did not fear the future now as she had feared
it once or twice during their long conversation. She felt
that she and her boy had faced the struggle of their lives,
and that she had, by the power of love, been victorious.
What had conquered him once would conquer him forever.
And as she bowed her head in silent thankfulness, she
understood, more clearly than she had ever done before,
the power of a religion which is founded and grafted on
love. Nothing else would win us, nothing. Not fear,
or duty, or habit; though they no doubt have their in-
fluence, and are helps as far as they go.
But we want something stronger, something deeper,
something that takes a firmer hold upon us; something,
in fact, that touches a chord in our hearts, and silences
all the jars of rebellion there. And it is only love that
can sound that chord ; only the Love which has bought
us the heaven which is but its other name.

THE MIDDLETON FAMILY MOVE.
IN the course of a week after their walk with their
father, the little Middletons had it formally announced
to them that their Aunt Magdalen was going to be married
to Lord Wardlaw in about a fortnight, and that their
cousin Mervyn was coming to stay with them at Granton
during his mother's absence abroad.
"Nina is certainly a most unsatisfactory child," said
Mrs. Middleton to her husband, when she returned to the
drawing-room after making the announcement. "She
showed no interest, expressed no surprise. One would
almost have thought from her manner that she knew all
about it before."
It is certainly wonderful how much it is the practice of
children to put "two and two together " of the scraps
they hear, and so get at a whole. Their parents are, for
the most part, as unaware of it as was Mrs. Middleton.
Any one with a good memory will be able to recall for
himself how his suspicions, as a child, would be roused
by the conversation broken off on his entrance, the sen-
tence half finished, the warning look, or expressive cough:
so that the next time the subject was mentioned, his mind,
already sharpened, would be able to glean a bit more,
before the grown-up people would remember his presence,
and once more break off with a "I forgot the child," or
" another time." And so on, till he knows a great deal,
if not all, that was never intended for his ears. Grown-
up people are so careless, and children are so sharp.

At any rate, one part of the announcement was a sur-
prise to Nina, and that was that Mervyn should be coming
to Granton. The thought filled her with pleasure, mingled
with a fear lest he should not be happy among them in
their home, where everything was so different from what he
was accustomed to. She wondered how he would endure
their dull school-room life, and submit to all the rules and
regulations by which they were surrounded. One comfort
was, their French governess always took her holiday in
the months of August, September, and October. She
went to Paris to study part of the time, and for the sake
of that prospective advantage for her daughters Mrs.
Middleton allowed her longer leave of absence than is the
usual custom. She felt she returned more and more quali-
fied, after every holiday, to make her pupils perfect French
scholars. In the mean time they had an old French lady
to superintend the school-room, who had been Mrs. Mid-
dleton's own governess once for a time. This lady, though
in mortal terror of Mrs. Middleton, and a perfect slave
to her rules, was not, in herself, a very rigid disciplinarian,
and therefore Nina was glad that Mervyn's visit should be
paid under her reign.
The children were to leave London in about a week:
and their parents were to remain behind for the wedding;
but Mervyn was not to come till the whole family were
settled at Granton. Nina's thoughts were very busy all
that day mapping out the future, and wondering if Mer-
vyn would be happy. She was so abstracted during the
walk in the afternoon, that Cecily could get nothing out
of her, and was in despair at the small amount of interest
Nina took in the "how-are-yous" she pointed out to
her, and even in the sudden appearance of the harum-
SCarum.
"I wish I was the statue of Achilles," sighed Cecily,
## p. 124 (#130) ############################################

as they crossed the road at Grosvenor Gate, on their way
to the Marble Arch.
"Why?" asked Nina, absently.
"He is always in the middle of the fun," answered
Cecily, "instead of being in all the dull parts of the park
like us. Just fancy what crowds of people are sitting on
the chairs close to him now, and lines of carriages blocked
right in front of him. Why, he can see the Queen or the
Princess of Wales pass every day, twice; and it doesn't
matter to him about the crowd, because he can see right
over their heads. Should you like to be him, Nina? or
would you rather be the statue of the Duke of Wel-
lington P"
"Neither," answered Nina, suddenly interested, and
with a slight sparkle in her eye. "I should like to be the
policeman who stands by the Drive, and can keep back
horses, and carts, and carriages, by just holding up his
hand. It must be so pleasant to see the prancing horses
coming along as if nothing would stop them, and to know
that you have the power, by just putting up two fingers,
of forcing the grand coachman to pull them back on their
haunches, whether he likes it or not."
"How funny " said Cecily; "I shouldn't care a bit
about that. And I don't think Mervyn would, either."
"How do you know what Mervyn would like?" asked
Nina.
"I asked him one day," answered Cecily, "and he
said he should like best to be the man who first thought
of putting the water-troughs in Piccadilly, for all the
poor thirsty horses to drink out of. He said he never got
tired of standing there, and seeing them all crowding
round."
Nina did not talk any more after this. She was musing
on the kindness of disposition that her cousin's w,

demonstrated; and feeling that her own was a very poor
one by comparison with his. She wondered why some
people had such much nicer feelings than others, and
whether she should be able, when Mervyn came to live
with them, to find out how he managed to be so kind and
nice. -
She did not speak again till they were returning home-
wards round the park by Apsley House. As they ap-
proached Hyde Park Corner they saw a crowd assembled,
as usual, waiting for the coming of the Queen or the
Princess of Wales. A message reached them from Made-
moiselle by Edmund, that they were to turn back, and go
home a quieter way. -
Cecily was in despair.
"Oh, Nina | don't you think, for once, that Mademoi-
selle would let us stand here, and see them pass?"
"You can ask her," said Nina; but she knew well
enough what the answer would be.
"You ask her, Edmund," said Cecily, eagerly.
The little boy ran back, but soon returned, hot and in-
dignant.
"She says "Non, Non,'" he exclaimed; "and I heard
her say to herself some one was a vulgar fool. And I
think it was you, Nina."
Both the little girls looked rather scared, and Nina
rather sharply told Edmund not to tell stories. Made-
moiselle then arrived on the spot, gesticulating with both
hands, to enforce her horror at the idea of young ladies
wishing to stand "parmi une foule vulgaire."
"There !" said Edmund, in a whisper to his sisters;
"I told you she had said it, and you wouldn't believe
me."
They were all made to turn, and go home across the
park to Stanhope Gate.

Cecily was too ruffled by her disappointment to be con-
versational, and Nina returned to her musings. Indeed,
her abstraction continued so great, that when they got
out of the park she walked absently over the crossing into
Park Lane, right under the jaws of a hansom cab, com-
ing along at the rate of ten miles an hour. The by-stand-
ers shouted, Mademoiselle screamed, and the cabman,
pulling back his horse with violence, called out angrily.
Startled and disturbed in her day-dream by the noise, and
forced to run against her will, Nina was anything but
grateful for her escape.
"I'd almost rather be run over than halloed at," she
muttered to herself, as she arrived, hot and indignant, on
the pavement.
The day for leaving London came at last; but how
shall we attempt to give a description of a "family start"
All the morning long Pickford's monster van blocked up
the street, while the nurseries and school-room disgorged
their contents into its open jaws. . But, not satisfied with
that, four cabs were loaded with what was still remaining,
or was wanted for more immediate use,a perambulator
on one cab, an enormous bath on another, a rocking-
horse on a third, besides boxes and packages innumerable.
Five children, two nurses, a governess, a school-room-
maid, a kitchen-maid, and a footman, composed the liv-
ing freight. Every nurse carried a child, every child
carried a toy, every other child carried a bird-cage.
Every woman that did not carry a child had converted
herself into a temporary hanging-stand, and from every
part of her suspended a loose parcel. Leather bags con-
taining the children's dinner, paper bags containing bis-
cuits for a bye-meal, parcels containing what no room had
been found for in the big boxes, hung from her arms;
while picture-books to amuse the younger ones in the

train, and dozens of minor packages, occupied vacant
spaces in her hands.
Mrs. Middleton, who hated scenes of this kind, took
leave of the party in the drawing-room, on its way down-
stairs; but Colonel Middleton, who was, as usual, out of
a job, stationed himself at the hall-door to see the chil-
dren off. They came down in great excitement and de-
light, their eagerness to be off being not, alas ! tempered
by any regret at parting with their parents.
The cabs were soon filled, the orders given, and the
long line filed round the corner into Park Lane on its
way to the station.
Cecily found herself separated from Edmund, and was
consequently very dull, for Nina was in one of her silent
and thoughtful moods; but she consoled herself by chat-
tering to Madame, who, being a new broom, was sure to
sweep clean in Cecily's eyes.
They arrived at the station in good time, and were in
their places a few moments before the train started. Nina
took a place near the window. She liked dreamily to
watch the fields and meadows as they flew past. It helped
her to think; and she wanted to think over the marriage,
and several things connected with it. Leaning back in
her seat, with a book in her lap, she absently scanned the
faces of her fellow-travelers, while she waited for the
train to start. There was a lady opposite her, two gen-
tlemen, and themselves; for the nursery party traveled
second-class. The newspaper-boy passed the carriage,
and at sight of him the lady suddenly rose, and as sud-
denly dashed her head violently against the window,
which she had not perceived was shut. The surprise,
combined with the blow, nearly knocked her down back-
wards; the window was smashed to atoms, and great
excitement reigned for a minute in the carriage and on
## p. 128 (#134) ############################################
128 7THRO WAV 7TOGAE 7THER.
the platform. But the lady had escaped being cut by
the glass, and she expressed herself unhurt, beyond
being rather stunned by the violence of the blow in her
face.
The accident had the effect of producing a head official
of great importance, who, while congratulating the lady
on having escaped without injury, hastened to reassure
her by pointing out that she would be certain to feel the
effects more hereafter. He proceeded to observe, with
solemn hilarity, that he looked upon the misadventure as
a great compliment to the railway-carriage. It was not
often that the windows were clean enough to admit of
such a mistake being made. He then bowed himself off,
and the train proceeded on its way.
His remarks had left the lady in question in doubt as
to the amount of disfigurement inflicted on her face; and
she did not feel sufficiently intimate with any of her fel-
low-passengers (much as the accident had drawn them to-
gether for a few brief moments) to invite them to inspect
her countenance. It seemed hard that she should be the
only person to remain in ignorance of what concerned
her so much the most nearly, but the fact remained that
she could not steal a glance at her own face, while all the
others were at liberty to do so. She leaned far back in her
seat, to conceal herself from view, in nervous horror of
being looked at, continually fancying she saw furtive and
pitying glances directed at her, and wondering whether
her nose was red, her eye black, or her forehead slowly
developing a bump of many colors.
Nina, now and then, in the pauses of her intent con-
centration on the country outside, looked at her absently;
and the poor lady absolutely writhed under the girl's un-
conscious gaze.
"It's the funniest book I ever read," said Cecily, sud-

denly, from her end of the carriage. And she laughed
merrily, as she shut it up.
The unfortunate lady only caught the last word, and
the laugh that followed it.
"Red | did you say?" she said, starting and blushing
all over, wondering and not daring to ask of what feature
the child was speaking.
"Ayes and noes," said the unconscious Cecily, reading
the debates over Madame's shoulder; "they do look
funny; but it's more noes than ayes, I think."
Cecily's grammar, combined with her sudden interest
in politics, put the finishing-touch to the poor lady's dis-
tress of mind. She raised her eyes with an appealing
glance towards the child, and then saw, for the first time,
that the little girl was not speaking to her. Realizing the
mistake she had made, and fearful of having betrayed
herself, and of attracting the notice she sought to avoid,
she shrank back into her seat, and never looked up again
during the whole of the journey.

THE GATE AMONG THE OLD WELSH HILLS.
MoTHER and son never spoke together of the parting
which was every day approaching nearer, though the
thoughts of each were often busy with it, in a different
way. To him it only came at times by fits and starts,
forcing itself upon him, like a shadow coming across his
sunny path. To her it was ever present. He, when the
thought came upon him, drove it away, and would not

allow it to take any definite shape. She allowed it to be
a fact in her thoughts, and strove to render it familiar.
Sitting sometimes in the twilight, with her boy's head
on her lap, and her fingers playing with his curly hair, she
would muse upon his deep affection, and the unalloyed
peace and enjoyment of their life together, till her hand
would tremble and her eyes moisten, and she would feel
as if she could not let him go.
On her own side, she could not but tell herself that it
was a very serious step that she was taking; that she was
going from a certain happinessa happiness that she had
tried and provedinto the unknown.
On his, though she knew that eventually all would be
for his own personal happiness, that the man who was to
fill a father's place to him was of all men the one he
would love and honor most, yet she felt there would be
much for him to bear in the mean while.
It was not that future that she feared for him so much
as that nearer one of the long months without her spent
in the colder atmosphere of his cousins' home ; the pain
of the parting itself, which every hour brought nearer and
nearer. The day came upon them all too quickly.
"Mervyn," she said at breakfast, "your uncle is to be
here at seven. I think I will walk with you as far as the
gate at half-past six, and then return to meet him alone."
That was all that passed between them on the subject.
All the day long she talked of his dog, his pony, and his
arrangements, and of his life with his cousins.
"It won't be very long, my darling. Please God, in
a few months I shall be back again, and we will have
such a happy winter here."
Mervyn felt his courage giving way; but his mother
went on, without appearing to notice it.
"I have a fancy, Mervyn, that little Nina is not a very

THE GATE AMowg THE WEZSH HILLS. 131
happy child, and, as you will be thrown so much together,
perhaps you may be able to help her. You ought to be
fond of her, darling, for she is very like me."
Mervyn's interest was immediately awakened.
"Yes, mother, she is, a little; that is, her eyes and her
hair are. But the great difference is that she looks so
cross, and you"
"What do I look?" smiled his mother, turning her
soft eyes upon him.
Mervyn looked up, and met her glance with eyes of
such worship and admiration that her own filled with
tears, which she forced back immediately.
"You know what I think, mother," he answered, smil-
ing.
Glad to see him smile, she went on. "Will you try
and find out what Nina is like, and write and tell me? for
I am curious to know."
"Yes," he answered, eagerly, and then he went on to
speak of the other cousins, and to wonder if all the elder
boys would be at home. And so they talked on quite
cheerfully till half-past five, and then she said, "We
must go."
They walked along, sometimes silent, sometimes con-
versing quietly, till they came to the gate. And there,
among the wild Welsh mountains, in the glorious summer
sunset, the mother and son parted,  God having left
them long enough together to fit them for the work He
would have them do; and now having other paths for
them to walk in, wherein to serve Him,
"God bless you, my darling, my darling, and have you
in his safe-keeping forever !"
She thought she could have controlled herself, but she
felt her courage going, and her voice shook and faltered
as she spoke.
## p. 132 (#138) ############################################
132 THA'O WAV 7'OGETHER.
So she determined to cut the parting short, much as
she longed to follow the impulse of her heart. For there
had come into the mother's breast a longing for which
she could not account; a longing to clasp him to her, and
to beg him to let her hear him say over and over again
how he loved, how he worshiped her, how he forgave
her even for seeming to desert him, and how nothing
would, or could, alter his love and devotion. A longing,
too, to thank him for all he had been to her these many
years, and for the life he had made so bright; a longing
to assure him that his place in her heart would forever
be kept for him, and that no new love could replace or
weaken the old one. It seemed as if, in this crisis of her
life, she needed his protecting love more than ever, and
as if the very thought of it made it more precious just
as she was sending it away. She felt, for the moment, a
weak, helpless woman, and craved for his young strength
to lean upon, and the assurance of his unchanging love.
But she must forego the relief of giving all these feel-
ings expression, lest he should weaken or fail. It must be
no sad memory of his mother that he must carry with him
during the long months of separation. Nothing on her
side must make the parting a whit more painful to him.
The quiver in her voice would betray her; she must not
attempt to speak again. So she broke off suddenly;
strained him to her, hiding her face on his shoulder;
kissed his eyes, his lips, his hair; took his hands, and
held them as if she could not let them go; gently disen-
gaged herself from his clinging embrace, and stepped back
into the wood, leaving him standing watching her dis-
appear among its leafy paths, turning round once that he
might see her bright and smiling, waving him on, and
kissing her hand.
Smiling and bright to the last. Such was the picture

he carried with him, as he turned away, feeling quite
brave and cheerful, and confident that she felt the same.
He vaulted over the gate, and took his way to the
vicarage.
Something rushed past him as he walked, turned, and
bounded upon him. "Here, Beth-Gelert! here ! Halloo,
old fellow !" and Mervyn set off running, his thoughts
diverted, child-like, by the sight of his favorite. And
soon the echoes are ringing and laughing, as the dog and
his young master betake themselves to their new abode.
And she, meanwhile, as soon as he is fairly gone, has
returned to the gate, and is straining her eyes after the
straw hat as it vanishes in the distance, feeling as if half
the life in her was going with it. Leaning upon the top-
most bar for support, she is watching the slight, graceful
figure with a yearning love and delight, half longing and
half fearing that he will turn round and let her see his
bright young face once more.
But he pursues his way unconscious, and she realizes at
last that he is really gon.
Then, as the echoes bear back to her the ringing laugh
and fresh young voice she loves so dearly, she stretches
out her hands to the blank distance, and cries almost
aloud, in accents of uncontrollable sorrow, "Come back,
Mervyn; come back, my darling; I cannot let you go."
The old Welsh hills, which have so often echoed the
mingled laughter of mother and son, look down pityingly
on the lonely mother, and their silence seems to tell her
it is too late.
So she turns and betakes her to her desolate home;
to the scenes whence his young presence has departed:
through the deserted gardens and the silent drawing-room,
up the still old staircase to her own apartment, where she
may give way to her grief undisturbed. Yet, though not

looking to the right hand or to the left, she has been con-
scious of the cricket-bat on the lawn, the butterfly-net on
the hall-table, the half-open door of the empty bedroom,
and the chill at her heart is greater than ever when she
reaches her chamber door.
Entering hastily, half blinded by her tears, she throws
herself on her knees by the bedside; and there, at last,
she is mastered by the grief that has been fighting with
her all day. For his sake she has kept it down, for his
sake she has striven to be gay; that he might not be sad-
dened by the remembrance of her grief. But, now that
his eye is no longer on her, the strain is over, and her
slight figure is shaken by the great sobs she cannot keep
down.
"Oh, my boy my boy I How shall I live without
you?"
So must it ever be. "The parent's love for the child,"
says a writer of the present century, "must ever be greater
than the child's love for the parent; not because the child
is worthier, but because the parent's heart is larger."
But what does it matter, would Magdalen have been
the first to say, since he and his dog are bounding happily
over the hills, and since he has carried away in his heart
a picture of her, bright.and cheerful: smiling and gay to
the last, waving him on, and kissing her hand.

THE VICAR AWD HIS MAIDEA SISTER. 135
C H A P T E R X.
The WICAR AND HIS MAIDEN SISTER.
IN the prim little parlor of the vicarage was seated its
prim mistress, the vicar's maiden sister.
She was knitting by the window, and her brother, the
Rev. Pendarvis Hughes, was sitting in an arm-chair read-
ing the paper.
It was evident that both were expecting some one ; for
the sister looked up at every sound, and even the brother
roused himself once or twice from his reading.
"You have got everything nice for him in his bedroom,
Gwen P'' -
"Yes, everything, Pen; quite a picture: a nice little
bit of scented soap, clean curtains, a beautiful ornament
in the fireplace, which I made myself; and I have moved
the case of stuffed birds from the library in there. I
thought it would amuse him, poor little fellow. Don't
you think so?" 
But the vicar had some time since become engrossed in
his paper. Gwen looked rather wistfully at him, hoping
he would speak again; but he said nothing more.
It was one of the great grievances of her life that he
talked to her so little. He never told her anything, or
consulted her at all. She had to pump and pump if she
wanted to get anything out of him. He never volunteered
information, or, if he did, he merely imparted it as a thing
settled. He never talked things over with her; he just
told her when he had made up his mind. He was a man
much taken up with his books. To them all the time he

could spare from his parish matters and his educational
labors was given. He was a silent, thoughtful man, and
his sister's frivolous conversation and insipid remarks were
the great trials of his life. Her little talk about parish
matters, and her keen interest in the small amount of
gossip she did manage to collect, came, in his mind, under
the head of "women's cackle." It wearied him sadly.
He was kind to her, and patient, and thoughtful for her
happiness and comfort, but he could not make her a
companion.
Poor thing ! she was entirely devoid of tact, and had a
wonderful aptitude for saying the wrong thing. She loved
and admired her brother, but was a little afraid of him.
She looked upon him as a very superior being, and was
quite aware of her own inferiority.
"He does not think much of women," she would tell
her friends, mysteriously. But there was one woman in
the world in whom the rector believed implicitly, one in
whom he saw no fault or flaw whatever; one who, in his
eyes, possessed all womanly virtues without womanly
weaknesses; and that was Magdalen Lyndsay.
Ever since she had been brought, years ago, to Glen-
Mervyn to be the companion of a man so many years her
senior, he had esteemed and admired her. He was the
only person in the world who had really known anything
of her married life, and without asking any questions he
had guessed at her early history. That is, he had always
been convinced that his patron, Mr. Lyndsay, had not
been the object of her affections; and, realizing this, he
had admired more than he could say the way in which
she had nobly striven to do her duty in the state of life to
which God had called her. He knew that she had had a
hard time of it during her husband's lifetime; and he
had always privately hoped that after his death Magdalen
## p. 137 (#143) ############################################
7//E VICAR AND HIS MAIDEM SISTER. 137
might form new ties and be rewarded for her devotion.
But as time went on, and there seemed no prospect of
such an event, he ceased to expect it; and when at last it
had come, it had taken him by surprise.
He had in the mean time grown so accustomed to have
her therethe mainspring of the well-being of all around,
and the ever-ready seconder of all his plans for good
that the prospect had, at first, dismayed him. But he
had got reconciled to it, more especially when he found
that, from the fact of Lord Wardlaw's having no house
on his estate in Ireland, she would still be able to live a
great deal at Glen-Mervyn.
He had been much touched by the way she had, some
years before, taken him into her confidence about her
boy, and confided his education to his care. He had
appreciated the unselfishness of the act, knowing what it
had cost her. He appreciated it even more after Mervyn
had been his pupil for a few months. He found the boy
so intelligent and so eager over his work, that it was a
pleasure to teach him. It was quite a new interest in the
vicar's life, and he soon began to look forward to the
arrival of the boy as to one of the greatest pleasures in
the day. The contact with the fresh inquiring mind
made him young again, and he grew to love the bright
face and sunny smile as if the boy had been his own son.
When Mrs. Lyndsay imparted to him her intended
marriage, and her difficulties about Mervyn, he willingly
undertook to house him for as long as his mother wished,
and ever since he was continually thinking what he could
do to make him happy. He was a little nervous at the
prospect, feeling deeply for the boy under his present
circumstances, and knowing what a wrench the parting
would be.
As he sat reading the paper that day, his mind reverted
I 2*

to it over and over again, and the sentences he every now
and then let fall showed of what his thoughts were full.
"Gwen," he said, again, "is the cricket-match to-
morrow P''
"Not till the next day," she answered, eager to en-
courage the conversation ; "and how I know is, that as
I was passing the green I saw no preparations for the tent;
and I said to myself, How is this P for I thought, like
you, that it was to-morrow. So I went into Mr. Jones's
shop and asked, and he told me it was not to-morrow : so
that is how I know, Pen dear, do you see?"
"I am sorry for it," said the vicar, and relapsed into
silence again.
"Pen," she said, timidly.
He looked up.
"What time will dear little Mervyn come P"
"I cannot say."
"Do you think he will ride or drive?"
"I cannot say."
"Oh, but, Pen, dear I didn't Mrs. Lyndsay tell you?
Because of his luggage, you know."
A pause. -
" Pen."
"What?"
"Do you think he will bring many boxes?"
"I really cannot say."
"Will Mrs. Lyndsay bring him?"
"I should say probably not."
"Poor dear ! think of her going to be a bride, and
having a nice young husband I Will it be a grand wed-

Very wearily he answered, "I do not know."
"When does she go up to London, Pen, dear?"
"To-morrow."

me ! it is rather sad to think he has come to fetch dear
Mrs. Lyndsay away. How we shall get on without her, I
don't know ! Do you, Pen?"
The newspaper went up a little, and no answer was
given.
"The place will be quite in a stir to-morrow, Pen,
won't it P. There'll be the Glen carriages going and
coming all day. I hear Mrs. Lyndsay is to be married
in ten days, from Colonel Middleton's house in London,
and then go abroad. Is that true, Pen P"
"I believe so."
"Pen, dear, do you think little Mervyn will be sad
when he arrives to-night?"
"I cannot say."
Just then, footsteps were heard outside, and the vicar
and his sister rose simultaneously.
"Here he is l'' exclaimed Gwen.

GWEN AND HER VICTIM.
SUCH was the family into which Mervyn's lot was to be
cast till Colonel and Mrs. Middleton were ready to re-
ceive him at Granton.
It was not altogether a bad half-way house. The
atmosphere into which he was to be translated at his
uncle's was, as we know, such a very different one from that
to which he was accustomed, that it was letting him down
gradually not to plunge him into it at once. At the
vicarage, at any rate, he met with every care and attention
that thoughtful consideration could devise. Gwen cared
for all his creature comforts, and the vicar did all in his
power to amuse and distract him, and make up to him for
the loss of his mother's companionship. For the first
few days Mervyn got on pretty well. It was quite natural
to him to spend the greater part of his day there ; he
had done so for several years now, and it was not till five
o'clock drew nearthe hour when he was accustomed to
scamper home to his motherthat the present state of
affairs seemed to him at all strange.
But the thoughtful vicar, foreseeing this, was ever ready
with some plan of amusement and distraction, and to
join in it himself, to the neglect of his own more impor-
tant occupations. Mervyn was a little surprised to find
what a sudden and violent fancy the vicar had taken to
single wicket; so much so that he must needs begin the
very moment five o'clock had struck, and continue play-
ing till it was time to get ready for supper; and also at

}
his newly-awakened interest in distant views from certain
distant mountains which necessitated their riding off the
moment Mervyn had finished his studies, if they hoped to
be back before dusk.
Gwen was a little sore at the way her brother monopo-
lized the boy. She had looked forward to getting out of
him details of the wedding, of bridesmaids, trousseau,
cake, favors, and other matters in which her heart
delighted. And she literally had not, at the end of
three days, had one single opportunity of a few minutes'
private conversation with him. In the presence of her
brother she dared not revert to such trivial subjects.
Besides, whenever she alluded in the most distant manner
to any of Mrs. Lyndsay's concerns, he had taken to giving
her glances before which she quailed.
On the fourth day of Mervyn's stay, he received his
first letter from his mother. It was written from Colonel
Middleton's house in London, and announced her safe
arrival there. It did not contain much, beyond expres-
sions of her longing to hear from him and to know all
he was doing.
It was given to him at breakfast, and he was conscious
of Gwen's eyes being fixed on him greedily the whole
time he was reading it.
The moment he had finished it, she said, eagerly,
"Well ?"
"Quite well, thank you,'
question.
"Yes, but what news, dear? What does she say about
Lord Wardlaw P''
Mervyn blushed deeply, and answered, shortly, "No-
thing."
"Nothing !" exclaimed Gwen ; "nothing about the
bridegroom Are you quite sure?" . -
said Mervyn, mistaking her

I42 7THRO WAV 7'OGETHER.
"Quite sure," said Mervyn, moving restlessly in his
chair.
"Some more tea, Gwen," said the vicar's voice.
"Mervyn, would you not like to go and answer your
mother's letter before we begin our work?"
Gladly Mervyn availed himself of the permission, and
went off to the little study. There, sitting down on the
rug in front of the fireplace, he kissed the letter over and
over again in a transport of love and delight.
"Mother my own mother 1" he murmured, looking
with glowing eyes on the beloved handwriting. "Mine !
my very own l'' Then he kissed the paper again, kissed
the "my darling" with which the letter began, kissed
the "Magdalen Lyndsay" with which it ended, and,
jumping up hastily, sat down eagerly to the table, to
write his answer. He almost felt as if his mother were
by, and he were going to pour out his thoughts as usual.
Three days' events to tell her of ! Three days It was
actually as long as that since he had seen or spoken to her.
So he took a large sheet of paper and began at the very
top, feeling as if he should never have room for all he had
got to say. But he soon found writing a very different
thing from talking. The turning of the sentences, the
spelling of the words, the time it took him, and the trouble
it was, all this rather cramped the free expression of his
feelings, and before he had written a page and a half the
vicar came in to say the postboy was going. He was
obliged to let it go as it was, and the whole transaction
left on him a vague sense of disappointment. He had
not thought it wou'd have been so difficult to write to his
mother. He had not said half he meant to say. He had
not answered half her questions. He did not feel as if
he had been talking to her at all. It depressed him, and
made him sad all day. He could not shake off the feel-

ing. He half thought of writing another letter, so as to
send a good long one the next day; but, as soon as his
lessons were over, there came cricket, and then supper,
and then draughts, and then bed. He woke the next
morning feeling very miserable. He felt more forlorn
and more cut off from his mother than he had done yet.
He wondered how he could have been so happy hitherto
The life he was leading seemed to him flat, unbearable.
He wondered how he could have put up with it for four
days. The thought of his life at Glen-Mervyn with his
mother came upon him with a sharp pang of contrast. He
buried his head in his pillow and cried, for the first time
since he had left her. A longing to write to her came
over him, and, jumping out of bed, he dressed himself
hurriedly and ran down to the study. He concocted a .
letter there before breakfast, and his feelings were relieved.
Badly written, badly spelt, very blotted, and rather inco-
herent, it yet conveyed to his mother all that she would
most wish to hear.
Towards the end of the week he received the answer,
telling him of the pleasure it had been to her.
Meanwhile, the wedding-day was approaching. His
mother wrote to him two days before, timing her letter to
reach him on the day, telling him that she was going to
cross the same day and to travel on to Vienna via Amiens
and Paris.
She told him that if he answered her letter the day he
received it, she would find it waiting for her. The letter
ended by saying Colonel Middleton would write to the
vicar as soon as he and Mrs. Middleton were settled at
Granton. Mervyn looked very grave after reading this
letter, and ate his breakfast in silence.
"Mr. Hughes," he said, after a time, "will you give
me some foreign paper ?"
## p. 144 (#150) ############################################
I44 THRO WAV TOGETHER.
"Yes, my boy. Why?"
"Mother wants to find a letter waiting from me in
Paris," he said, with an evident effort, "and she says I
must write it to-day."
"Why, good gracious !" exclaimed Gwen, "to-day is
the wedding-day !"
Before any answer could be made, the maid-servant
came in to say a poor boy had called to beg the vicar to
go without delay to his father, who was dying and wished
to see him. Mr. Hughes rose directly.
"It is many miles away, Mervyn," he said, "so I can-
not be back till the afternoon. Amuse yourself as best
you can. I am sorry to leave you, but it cannot be helped.
You will find plenty of foreign paper in my desk." And
he hurried off.
The diversion was fortunate in one respect, but in
another it was unlucky that the boy should, on his
mother's wedding-day, be left exposed to the fire of
Gwen's curiosity and questions. However, he was safe
for a time, for the first thing was to write his foreign
letter to his mother to catch the morning post. So he
betook himself to the study, and Gwen went about her
household avocations. The boy was in a curious state of
mind, something like that in which he had been when his
mother first broke the news to him. He was battling
hard with himself, and trying to keep his feelings down.
Still, he managed to write her a very nice letter, folded it
neatly, and addressed it, copying out the direction from
hers. Letter in hand, he went to seek Gwen, to ask for
a foreign stamp. He found her in the drawing-room, and
proffered his request. Gwen was quite sure there was not
such a thing in the house.
"Penny stamps would do," said Mervyn, "if I knew
how many to put on."

"Now, was there ever such a piece of luck!" exclaimed
Gwen. "Your dear mother gave me a little gilt weighing-
machine as a parting gift. She little thought the first use
I should put it to would be to weigh your letter to her on
her wedding-day !"
Mervyn winced. "Where is it?" he said. "On the
writing-table?"
"Dear me, no l'" said Gwen ; "do you think I would
let such a gift as that lie about on the tables to get dusty?
No, it is nicely wrapped up in its box, just as she gave it
to me, up-stairs in my drawer. Give me the letter, dear,
and I'll go up and weigh it."
Mervyn handed her the letter, and she got up from her
chair. When she got to the door, she glanced at the di-
rection, and then looked at Mervyn, with a twinkle in her
eye. He felt irritated, without knowing why.
"What is the matter?" he said.
"You have not directed it right, dear," she said, with
an arch smile, coming towards him.
"What's wrong?" he inquired, going up to her, and
reading it over her shoulder. "It's all right, Miss
Hughes; it must be, for I copied the direction out of
mother's letter, word for word:
Mrs. Lyndsay,
Hotel du Louvre,
A Paris.
What can there be wrong about that?"
"Oh, the direction is all right, dear, I dare say. It's
the name !" And she pointed slyly to the "Mrs. Lynd-
say," and then to the clock. "It is quite right now,
dear, but it will be wrong in a very little while, for her
name will be Lady Wardlaw. Think of that And by
the time your letter gets to Paris no one will know who
G I3
## p. 146 (#152) ############################################
146 THROWN TOGE 7//ER.
Mrs. Lyndsay is, for there will be no such person in the
world. Think of that I Doesn't it seem funny? To
think of your making such a mistake Well, it was a
very natural one, wasn't it? How it will make Pen laugh
when I tell him : What a joke it will be at supper to-
night ! Well, you alter it, dear, while I run up to get
the weighing-machine. What a joke, isn't it?" . And,
with a little chuckle of delight, Gwen tripped out of the
room.
Surely, next to being devoid of feeling, there is nothing
worse than being devoid of tact. Almost as much pain
can be inflicted by the want of the one as by the want of
the other. No refinement of cruelty could have done
more than those few words of the unconscious Gwen's.
The boy's feelings had been strung to the highest pitch;
the embers that were smouldering in his heart needed only
a very little gust of wind to fan them into a flame. He
stood literally quivering under her speech, and when the
door closed he gasped with the effort he made to control
himself. For he felt there must be no display, no betrayal
of himself. Gwen would be back again in a minute, and
to save himself from her, to hope to escape from the still
greater trial of her sympathy and condolences, he must at
least appear unmoved.
It was a new lesson the poor child was learning, he
who had never had occasion to hide his feelings before.
But the contact with new characters necessitates the
calling forth of new qualities; and he summoned up all
the self-control he could muster, and was himself surprised
to find he could command so much.
When Gwen returned with the weighing-machine, chat-
tering as she came along, she found him standing just
where she had left him, and noticed nothing at all.
"I've been laughing all the way down-stairs," she said,
!

"to think of your letter lying in the Paris hotel, and no
one knowing who it was for. Isn't it a nice little machine?
See you put the letter here, and the weights there.
One, two, three, four, five, LI declare, six stamps : Oh,
Mervyn, fancy the wedding going on to-day ! How lovely
your dear mother will look in her bridal dress And fancy
the carriages, and the smart dresses, and all the favors and
cake How I wish I could take a little peep at it all !
Don't you? I wonder what presents Lord Wardlaw has
given his bride. Oh, don't go, Mervyn; stop and talk a
bit longer."
For poor Mervyn was trying, like a hunted hare, to
escape from his tormentor. But Gwen had not done with
him yet. She had at last got her victim into her clutches,
and she was going to make the most of her opportunity.
Question upon question, surmise upon surmise, she show-
ered upon the boy; all, in fact, that the vicar had so
strenuously endeavored to guard him from, now fell upon
him.
But there are limits to human endurance, and Mervyn
at length felt he could bear no more. Faltering some ex-
cuse about getting the stamps, he hastily snatched up his
letter, and made for the door. Nor did he take any
notice of the shrill little remonstrances that reached him
as he left the room. His courage was all gone, his self-
control had deserted him.
He hastily entered the little study, and, locking the door
after him, tore the letter up into shreds, flung them furi-
ously into the fireplace, and then buried his head in his
hands, and cried as if his heart would break.
"By the time it gets to Paris no one will know who
Mrs. Lyndsay is, for there will be no such person in the
world !"
Over and over again the words rang in his head; he

could not get away from them. No such person in the
world! No Magdalen Lyndsay any more! She no longer
shared his name ! This last idea seemed to remove her
further from him than any other thing. He had always
been so proud that he and she were the only Lyndsays
left, and that their very initials were the same.
How many old jokes and associations were connected
with this last idea . How he had always delighted to
seize upon her writing-paper, her smelling-bottle, her
prayer-book, and to answer her remonstrances with the
same old joke: "It must be mine, if it has got my in-
itials I'" What fights he had had with his mother's maid
from time immemorial, because he always would take her
pocket-handkerchiefs and triumphantly point to the mark
as his justification How fond he had always been of
writing in any book he gave her: "M. Lyndsay, from
M. Lyndsay." And now it was all over ! It was a little
thing, no doubt; but to him, in his excited frame of
mind, it seemed the key-note of the discord that was
coming into his life.
"No such person in the world !" No Magdalen
Lyndsay ! In fact, no mother | She was his no longer!
Seas rolled between them. She shared no longer his
home or his name. She was gone forever: she was as
good as dead. She might as well be lying in the little
churchyard at Glen-Mervyn. Better 1 oh, far better
For then she would at least be near him, still belong
to him, still bear upon her tombstone the old familiar
name !
With eyes blinded by their tears, he drew from his
pocket her letter received that morning, that he might
gaze upon the name once more. But it was not there.
"Now and always, my darling," the letter ended,
"your own loving mother." And his feelings underwent
## p. 149 (#155) ############################################
G WEAW AND HER VICTIM. I49
a change. "Now and always," he sobbed ; "now and
always."
Oh, yes! she was his mother still ; his own, and no
one else's. He read the letter through. He drank in
the living love which breathed through every line of it,
and the thought of the marble tombstone fled away.
Under any name, and in any place, his own, his very
own "Now and always Now and always I'"
Sudden contrition seized him for having so hastily
destroyed the letter, as he read his mother's reiterated
entreaties that she might find one waiting for her in
Paris. He must write another directly, and he set about
it at once.
It was a very different one from the last. It breathed out
his feelings more, and was full of every sentiment of
affection. He directed it to her in her new name boldly,
without giving himself time to think, and was sticking
on the six stamps with great energy, when Gwen tapped
at the door. Mervyn unlocked it, and confronted her
bravely.
She had on her bonnet and shawl, and was in full talk.
"I came to see what you were about, so quiet and busy.
I am going to do a little marketing in the village. Won't
you come with me? It is a nice, bright morning."
"Yes," said Mervyn, "I will come; but I must just
finish stamping my letter."
"Letter 1'' exclaimed Gwen. "Didn't you send it?
Why, dear me ! dear me ! the postboy has been gone
nearly three-quarters of an hour !"
Five minutes more saw Mervyn rushing wildly towards
the stables, and Gwen trotting as quickly as she could after
him, talking all the way. Her shrill little remonstrances,
and shriller assurances that it was no use trying to over-
take the postboy, fell on ears willfully deaf and heedless.

I5o TA/A'O WAV 7"OGAE THEA'.
The boy's mind was filled by only one thought. The
letter must go. Somehow or other it must be managed.
Arrived at the stable, he began to saddle his pony him-
self, and had nearly finished before the panting Gwen
came up to him.
"It'snousedearI'msure," she said, in little
gasps; "he-must be nearlythereby now."
"He goes by the high-road," answered Mervyn, his
mind intent on the straps and buckles. "If I go across
country, I must get up to him."
Gwen reiterated her assurances that it would be of no
avail, and that he would be sure just to miss the boy on
the road.
"Then I will ride on to the town,'
impatiently.
Gwen immediately entered into a long-winded argu-
ment, of which the upshot was that his pony would never
do it. A horse might, and it was most unfortunate that
Pen should on that morning, of all mornings, have taken
his horse, etc.
"I know what I'll do," interrupted Mervyn; "I'll
ride to Gken-Mervyn and send a man and horse from
there. Of course Why didn't I think of it before?
Glen-Mervyn is all that distance nearer the town. Don't
keep me, Miss Hughes; I am losing time every minute!"
And in a fever of impatience he jumped on his pony and
galloped away. His head was so full of the object he had
in view that it had room for no other thought, or his
heart might have failed him a little as he neared the
familiar surroundings of his now desolate home. He
clattered into the stable-yard, and shouted for a groom at
the top of his voice. A man instantly appeared at the
door, testifying surprise and pleasure at the unexpected
appearance of his young master.
y
said Mervyn,
## p. 151 (#157) ############################################
G WEAW AAWD AIA: R VICTIM. I51
"Look here!" said Mervyn, eagerly; "this letter has
missed the post. How can I get it to the town P. It is a
letter to mother, you see, George, and I don't know what
I shall do if it doesn't go." All the servants worshiped
Mervyn and his mother, and were ready to work to the
bone for either. The man entered at once into the im-
portance of the case, and saw no difficulties anywhere.
The post did not leave the town for half an hour after
the postboy's arriva), as the letters had to be sorted. A
good horse would do it in an hour and a half. There
was just time to saddle a horse and start. Nothing could
be easier.
"On, then ; do it at once," said Mervyn. "Take
mother's horse; he is by far the quickest ; and be off as
soon as you can " No sooner said than done. In a few
minutes Mervyn had the satisfaction of seeing the man
depart, with the precious letter in the pocket of his sad-
dle. He breathed a long sigh of relief. "She will get
it," he said, half out loud. "She won't have to ask for
a letter in Paris, and find none. Oh, how glad I am I?'
And the tears came into his eyes.
It was his surroundings as much as anything else that
brought them there. All looked so much the same as
usual that it was difficult to believe she was really gone.
"I will take a look at the house from the garden," he
said, "and then I shall understand it better."
So, leaving his pony in the yard, he went round on to
the terrace and stood in front of his empty, deserted
home. Oh, how lonely it looked How solitary The
windows were all shut, the blinds were all down ; there
was silence and desolation over everything. His chest
heaved as he gazed, and he turned his head away for a
minute, as if he could not bear the sight. Could this be
Glen-Mervyn, the happy, the beloved home of his child-

hood P Oh, no surely not l Not this dreary-looking
place | Could those be the lawns and gardens he had
always loved so well? He felt them to be hateful. They
were unsightly and hideous in their emptiness. How
could he have so deceived himself as to fancy Glen-
Mervyn a cheerful home-like place . How could he have
thought it fair? Why, it was loathsome, detestable ! He
wished himself far away, out of its very neighborhood;
to leave it all behind, and to get away from the very re-
collection of such dreariness and desolation. He hurried
to the stables, mounted his pony, and galloped back to
the vicarage. Change of thought awaited him, happily,
for the vicar had returned sooner than he had expected,
and the afternoon was spent in study. But the recollec-
tion of that deserted home, so near, weighed upon his
spirits, and he began to long to go to Granton.
He painted to himself the delights of the big house so
full of young people; the Eton cousins, the big school-
room party, the society of his uncle and his aunt. The
little vicarage with its prim drawing-room and its unevent-
ful days, the want of youth and spirits about the vicar
and his sister, began to weary and depress him, and his
delight was great when at last the summons came.
The vicar was going to London on business, so they
would travel thus far together, and then Mervyn would go
on alone. The thoughts of the change were delightful.
So, one summer's evening, he bade a joyful good-by
to Gwen, and he and the vicar started on their journey,
catching the night mail on its way from Holyhead to
London. They arrived in the early morning, and after a
toilette and breakfast at the Euston Square Hotel, Mervyn
was established by Mr. Hughes in the train, with plenty
of books and papers to amuse him on the way. The
vicar stood talking to him at the window of his carriage

to the last, and then, when the train began to move, he
regretfully said farewell, bidding God bless him and pro-
tect him, and restore him safely to his people and his
home.
And so they parted: the boy rich in the illusions of
youth, bright with hopes and anticipations; his thoughts
full of the pleasures and enjoyments he felt so sure were
awaiting him;-the old man with no illusions on his path
to tell him otherwise than that his life would be the
emptier for the loss of the boy's bright society.
C H A P T E R XII.
MERVYN's ARRIVAL AT GRANTON.
It was about half-past six when Mervyn drove up to
the door of Granton. He jumped out in eager excite-
ment, half expecting to see his aunt and cousins assem-
bled in the hall. But there was no one there, and he was
ushered by the butler into an empty drawing-room and
there left. He felt very much inclined to run out into
the garden and call out all the names he could think of;
but his intention was frustrated by the entrance of his
aunt.
"Ah, Mervyn, here you are. How do you do? I
hope you are quite well."
Mervyn ran joyfully up to her and kissed her warmly.
"I'm so glad to see you, Aunt Lydia."
She then asked him a few questions about his journey,
etc., what lesson-books he had brought, and how far
advanced he was in this or that branch of learning.
G*
## p. 154 (#160) ############################################
I54 7A/RO WAV 7TOGAE 7A/EA'.
Any one but Mervyn would have felt a little chilled by
her manner, but he was not given to observe those things;
and, besides, he was too much accustomed to love and
sympathy to suppose that any one would not give it to
him. He put it down to her not being quite well. So,
in the middle of one of her most pompous sentences on
the subject of mathematics, he asked her earnestly if she
had a headache, or was tired.
Mrs. Middleton looked surprised; but, the idea having
been put before her, she owned that she was a little tired.
"I only came down yesterday from London," she said,
"and what with the wedding and altogether, I have been
very hard worked there lately. Your uncle is still in town,
but I expect him to-morrow. I think, perhaps, you had
better come up to the school-room now. I dare say you
will be glad of some tea."
So saying, she rose, and Mervyn jumped up gladly, and
followed her.
"The elder boys are gone abroad with a tutor for their
holidays," she said, as she led the way up many stairs and
along many passages to the far-distant school-room. "So
you will only have Nina and Cecily. They have got an
old French lady for their governess at present. You speak
French, of course? I am sorry to say she is inclined to
speak English too much, and the girls are only too glad
to do the same. I hope you will set them a good example."
So saying, she turned down a passage, where voices
were at last heard; and, throwing open a door, she en-
tered, and said, "Madame, I have brought my nephew.
Mervyn, this is Madame."
Sitting at tea at a round table were Nina, Cecily, and
Edmund, and a very ugly old lady. Nina looked up
when Mervyn entered, with an expression of pleasure;
and Cecily jumped up, and would have run to meet him,

MER VVM'S ARRIVAL AT GRAMTOW. I55
but seemed afraid to do so. She glanced timidly at her
mother, and sat down again.
Mervyn ran up to Madame and shook hands, and then
kissed his cousins one after another. "It is a long time
since I have seen you, isn't it?" he said. "Nina has
grown very tall, Aunt Lydia, hasn't she? and Edmund
looks to me much bigger."
"I hope you will all take example from Cousin Mer-
vyn," said Mrs. Middleton, without noticing his remarks.
"See how civilly he says "How do you do' to Madame."
Madame looked uncomfortable; Mervyn felt rather shy;
while Nina tossed back her hair and muttered something
to herself about "never having called him Cousin Mervyn
in her life, and hardly knowing who her mamma meant."
Luckily Mrs. Middleton did not notice it. She gathered
up her rustling silk gown, and said, "Well, now that I
have made you all comfortable together, I will leave you.
Madame, I have a good deal to do this evening, so I shall
not want them down. Send Mervyn to bed early, as he
has had a long journey." And she swept out of the
room. Mervyn had already engaged in conversation
with Cecily, in whom he found a ready listener; so he
did not notice his aunt's concluding remarks, otherwise
he would certainly have rushed after her to wish her
good-night.
"Will you take one cup of tea?" inquired Madame.
"Cecily, place your cousin one chair."
"Oh, sit by me," said little Edmund.
"No, by me, please," said Cecily.
Mervyn good-naturedly placed himself between them;
after which the children all looked at one another, and
no one spoke. Mervyn was unaccustomed to the society
of children, and didn't quite know what to say.
Besides, he was very busy with his tea. He looked for

some time at Nina, searching for the likeness of which his
mother had spoken; but Nina had been ruffled by her
mother's visit, and the expression of her face only con-
firmed him in his opinion of wherein the difference be-
tween them lay.
His thoughts wandered off to his mother's sweet face,
though his eye still rested on Nina.
"How you stare l'" said she, at last. "What makes you
look at me?"
"Oh, I wasn't thinking about you," he said; with a
child's candor.
"What were you thinking of, Mervyn P" asked Cecily.
"Mother," he answered; and as he spoke the tears
came into his eyes. Nina's eyes softened, and she
looked at him pityingly; but Mervyn had averted his,
and did not observe the change. He did not talk
much after this, but remained in a state of dreamy
abstraction.
When the tea was cleared away, he asked Nina to show
him his room. As they went along the passage he heard
a soft droning noise, which, as they neared the apart-
ment from which it proceeded, proved to be the follow-
ing song:
"Why did they sell my Dinah
Upon my wedding day?",
"What is that, Nina P"
Nina turned round and held up her finger.
"Hush l'" she said: "that is Totty being sung to sleep.
Come very softly." A little way on she opened a door,
and saying, "This is your room," went away. He went
in listlessly, but his face lighted up as he advanced to-
wards the window.
For there, on the dressing-table, lay a letter from his
mother; and with a shout of joy he sprang towards it,
## p. 157 (#163) ############################################
AMER VVM'S AA' RZPAA. A 7" GA'AAV7'OM. 157
and eagerly devoured its contents. It was all that he
could wish. She had found his letter waiting in Paris,
and it had made her very happy. He felt more than
repaid for all that letter had cost him, as he read and
re-read his mother's answer. He could not go back to
the school-room again. He wanted to think it over,
and enjoy it by himself. So he undressed and got into
bed. -
He woke the next morning in high spirits, pleased at
the idea of being at Granton, and inclined to be quite
happy. He liked the large school-room party; it seemed
cheerful and pleasant to him ; and he was so merry at
breakfast that he made them all laugh. He won old
Madame's heart at once by his attentions to her, and by
constantly addressing his remarks to her. It struck him
that his cousins did not include her in their conversation
as much as they might.
As soon as breakfast was over, he proposed going out.
"Out !" said Cecily, with a groan. "I wish we could.
We've got to do lessons till half-past twelve l'"
"What shall you do, Mervyn P" said Nina. "I'm
afraid you'll be rather dull."
"What does Aunt Lydia do in the morning P" he
asked.
"I'm sure I don't know," said Nina, indifferently.
"Not know !" exclaimed Mervyn.
"She only came down the day before yesterday," in-
terrupted Cecily. "In London she does all sorts of
things. I can't remember about Granton."
"She generally has lots of company to see after down
here," put in Nina, "and she spends the day with them;
but there's nobody come yet."
"But why do you ask, Mervyn P" laughed Cecily,
"What can it matter to you?"

"Oh, only that I thought I would go and sit with her
while you did your lessons. Perhaps she would come out
for a little turn, and show me the place."
Cecily looked very much astonished, and was going to
speak, when Madame called her away to her lessons.
Nina looked troubled. "I almost advise you not, Mer-
vyn : she might bebusy."
She could not make up her mind whether it would be
best to give him a hint of the state of affairs at Granton,
or to let him find it out for himself.
"Oh, if she's busy," he answered, "I'll go out by
myself; but I must just run down and see her. Good-by
for the present. I'll come back when I think you've done
your lessons." And he ran off, whistling.
Nina looked very thoughtful after he was gone. She
could not bear the thought of his being rebuffed, particu-
larly on his first day at Granton. And yet she feared
much that his reception could not but be very different
from that which he seemed to expect, and from what he
had been accustomed to.
She waited some time, listening rather anxiously for the
sound of his returning footsteps. But he did not come.
She was relieved about him at last, feeling that he must
have found some other amusement, or else he would have
come back to the school-room. She drew her little table
near to the window, and began to write her French com-
position; but the least sound in the garden below made
her jump up and look out, for she could not think what
he could be about.
Meanwhile, Mervyn, not finding his aunt in the draw-
ing-room, pursued his investigations further, and found
her at last in a little morning-room, surrounded by account-
books.
"Oh here you are l'' he exclaimed. "Good-morn-

-
ing, Aunt Lydia; I've had such a hunt for you. Isn't it
a beautiful day?"
Mrs. Middleton was so surprised to see him, that she
hardly knew what to say ; and while she was hesitating he
took a seat, and entered into conversation. Now, Mrs.
Middleton was a woman who was accustomed to live a
great deal in society, and it was quite an event for her to
spend the morning alone. She never dreamt of being at
Granton without company, and the house was generally
more or less full, from the time they arrived till they re-
turned to London. It so happened that Colonel Middle-
ton and a party of friends were not expected till that
evening, and so she had found herself quite solitary with
the whole day before her, and had been a little dismayed
at the prospect. So that Mervyn's entry was not so very
inopportune as it might have been. At any rate, she did
not feel inclined to send him away. She was attracted,
too, by his frank, open manner, and not altogether callous
to his good looks and pleasant expression of countenance.
The room, which she had felt to be rather dull and silent
just now, seemed to be brightened by his presence; and
she presently found herself not only listening, but joining
in the conversation, to the neglect of her business. He
seemed so sure that she would be glad to see him, and
took it so much as a matter of course that he should be
there, that she began to look upon it in the same light
herself.
"Ain't you rather dull, Aunt Lydia, all alone?"
Mrs. Middleton, on having the question pressed home
to her, owned that she was a little dull.
"I suppose you are always a little dull while Nina and
Cecily are at their lessons? Mother used to be while I
was at the vicarage. I was obliged to leave her then,
you know. She didn't mind being alone if she had plenty

-
to do, and she generally had that. But still she used to
count the hours sometimes for my lessons to be over, and
for me to come home. I dare say you often count the
hours for Nina's and Cecily's lessons to be over, don't you,
Aunt Lydia?"
"They go out for their walk then," answered Mrs.
Middleton, rather evasively; "and in the afternoon
Nina rides with the coachman."
"Don't you ride with her?" exclaimed Mervyn.
"Mother always rides with me. Oh, I forgot' of course
she's so much younger than you. It's a pity, though,
isn't it? You and Nina might have some nice gallops.
What are you going to do when you've finished your
bills P''
"Nothing particular; but I shall never get on with
them if you sit talking to me."
"No, that you won't. Mother never can add if I am
talking. So I'll tell you what I'll do; I'll run out in the
garden, and come back when I think you've done." And
he went out by the window with a bound.
Somehow, Mrs. Middleton felt bored at his sudden
departure, and was half inclined to call him back. The
room felt duller and more silent than ever. She returned
to her bills with reluctance. Presently, a voice at the
window near the writing-table called out, -
"Aunt Lydia, I've brought you a rose. Isn't it a
beauty? Look!"
Mrs. Middleton looked up, and hardly knew whether
she admired most the beauty of the yellow rose he was
holding out, or that of his bright face above it, smiling
down upon her. She accepted it very graciously.
"Do you know, Aunt Lydia, I almost advise you to
come out for a little run. You can't think how delicious
it is. We might have a nice walk together."

Mrs. Middleton looked round the empty room, and
then at the sunny garden.
"I've half a mind to come," she said; "it is dull
after London, and I've nothing particular to do."
"Oh, yes, do," said Mervyn; "and I'll run up and
fetch your things, if you like."
Before she could answer, he was gone; and in ten
minutes he returned, with all her walking-things on his
arm in a heap.
"I've been rather long," he said, as he threw them
down on the nearest sofa ; "but I think I've got them at
last. I don't believe I've forgotten anything. You see,
I didn't know where to find your things, so I've been
having a tremendous hunt in your drawers and wardrobe,
and that detained me. Mother's things are always put
in one place, so that I can find them easily. I had to
ring for your maid at last to help me. Shall I put on
your coat?"
Mrs. Middleton found herself submitting to everything
proposed, and in a few minutes she and Mervyn were
walking in the garden, talking in a most friendly manner.
"I want to understand the place, you see, Aunt Lydia.
I know Glen-Mervyn by heart, but all this is quite new.
Now will you show me everything, please? First the
flower-garden, then the kitchen-garden, then the glass;
and we might finish up with the farm."
Mrs. Middleton was in the habit of superintending
everything connected with the farm and garden, but never
had she realized how very nominal that superintendence
was, and how very little she really understood of the de-
tails of farming and gardening, till she took that walk
with her young nephew. It was all she could do to satisfy
his inquiries. The boy's knowledge and accuracy sur-
prised her, and every moment she feared exposing her

ignorance. His interest in the subject and acquaintance
with matters of detail seemed to her quite extraordinary,
and, instead of giving instruction, she found herself re-
ceiving it.
He had suggestions to make here, and improvements to
recommend there, and all his remarks were sensible and
to the purpose. He seemed to know the name and his-
tory of every flower that blossomed, and of every shrub
and tree that grew. It was just the same when they came
to the farm and inspected the machinery; and he entered
into conversation with the man who showed it to them,
with the ease of one who quite knew what he was talking
about.
Mervyn presently asked to see a certain farming ma-
chine lately invented, which he seemed to take as a
matter of course should be there. The man shook his
head.
"We have not got one, sir."
Mervyn expressed great surprise, and turned to his
aunt. "I wonder at that, Aunt Lydia '''
Now, if there was one thing more than another on
which Mrs. Middleton prided herself, it was on keeping
up with the march of improvement and being well up in
the latest inventions. She answered, quite in a tone of
pique, L
"That machine has only just appeared. I should hardly
think anybody had got one yet."
"Why, we've had it working at Glen-Mervyn nearly
three weeks '' exclaimed Mervyn.
Altogether, Mrs. Middleton retraced her steps to the
house, feeling rather smaller, and also thinking a good
deal more of her companion, than she had done when she
left it.
"You will make a capital landlord, Mervyn, some

day," she said, almost involuntarily. "Who taught you
all this?'"
"Mother," he answered, simply; "she says she always
tried to teach me about all these sort of things, because
she wanted me to be a good landlord when I grew up."
Mrs. Middleton did not say anything more after this.
She was thinking of her own eldest boy, who, now nearly
sixteen, thought of nothing but cricket and amusement,
and had never taken interest in anything connected with
the management of the estate. She felt quite certain he
had not a tenth part of the knowledge possessed by the
child at her side. She began to wonder whose fault it
was. Governesses'? Tutors' P Whose? The boy him-
self, of course. An easy-going, indolent youth, with
nothing in him. Evidently Mervyn was a superior kind
of boy.
"I wonder why my boys are so stupid?" she asked
herself.
And yet something in Mervyn's last speech grated
rather uncomfortably on her ear.
"Mother says she always tried to teach me all these
sort of things," etc.
"I'm sure no boy of mine would ever have cared to
hear about such things," said one voice within her.
"Qui s'excuse, s'accuse," said another.
"I can't remember," said the first voice, "ever to have
taken a walk with one of them, talking quietly and sensi-
bly, in my life."
"Did you ever ask one of them to come P'' said the
second.
"I never asked this boy, and yet he came. My boys
would have thought it dull. Ah, well, I suppose we can't
have everything. My boys are manly, active creatures,
and I suppose this boy is not. He is one of those quiet,

thoughtful, dreamy Good gracious, Mervyn ! What's
the matter?"
For, with a shout which rang through the air, the boy
flung off his jacket, and bounded from her side towards
an old beech-tree. Throwing his arms around the trunk,
he swung himself upwards, and was soon lost to sight.
Reappearing nearly at the top, he looked down upon her
astonished face with a merry laugh, and called out, "It
was a squirrel, Aunt Lydia, and I haven't caught him, after
all. Isn't it a pity?"
"So that excuse won't do," said the second voice in
Mrs. Middleton's breast, as she re-entered the house.
The whole proceeding had been watched by Nina from
the school-room window with the greatest astonishment.
First, at seeing her mother start for a walk with Mervyn,
and to hear them chatting as they went along, as if on the
most equal and friendly terms; then at the length of time
which elapsed before their voices returning brought her
to the window again; and last, though not least, at
seeing Mervyn climb the tree, and look down upon Mrs.
Middleton, laughing and shouting, evidently completely
at his ease with her. She had watched her mother anx-
iously, fearing Mervyn had gone too far, and that he
would receive a rebuke. She could hardly believe her
eyes when she saw Mrs. Middleton nod and smile to the
top of the tree, and then go in-doors without so much as
a remonStrance.
The little daughter at the school-room window began
to puzzle out the very problem the mother was working
out in the drawing-room below. . How was it? Why
was this boy so different P Whose fault was it that others
were not like him? -
Curiously enough, they both came to the same con-
clusion. It was Mervyn himself. He was so charming,
7
## p. 165 (#171) ############################################
MER VVM'S ARRIVAL A 7" GA'AAV7'OAV. 165
and of such an engaging disposition, that he gave and
received love wherever he went. No one could resist
him. He was unlike every one else in the world.
And then the little daughter went on with her lessons,
and the mother resumed her household bills.
"Done lessons?" said a merry voice, and a head
peeped in at the school-room door. -
Nina looked up with one of her rare smiles, and Ma-
dame, in the midst of her struggle with Cecily and
French grammar, felt refreshed by the sight of anything
so bright.
"Come in and take one chair," she said.
"I've brought you a radish," he said, advancing;
"you said you liked them at breakfast."
The attention was more gratifying than the actual gift,
for the radish was fresh from its bed of mould, and the
hand that held it out was evidently the spade that had
dug it therefrom. Madame shrank a little, and Cecily
was off in a fit of giggles directly.
"Oh, I forgot 1" said Mervyn; "it's not washed. I'll
go and give it a rinse in my room." Of course this
operation took him a good deal longer than he had in-
tended ; it proved so very engrossing.
When he returned to the school-room, he found lessons
over, and his cousins gone out for their half-hour's air and
exercise in the garden; he pursued Madame into her room,
and presented his radish. He found her busy washing
her brushes; and, his hand being in, he instantly volun-
teered to join her in so interesting an occupation. It was
done with an amount of energy to which Madame's
brushes were wholly unaccustomed. He then still further
won the old lady's heart by perambulating about the
room, and asking a hundred and one questions as to the
history of each individual whose photograph adorned

Madame's walls. Their names, their circumstances, their
habits and characters, were inquired into with an interest
which did her good and made her quite loquacious.
The luncheon-bell rang, and Nina came in ready for
luncheon.
"Please go and get ready, Mervyn," she said; adding,
shyly, "We are very punctual here, and mamma comes
in directly the bell rings."
"Oh, well, you can explain it to her, you know ; and I
Tshan't be a minute." -
He certainly was not, for he reached the dining-room
door just as the school-room party was entering, and was
in time to see a morning greeting between his aunt and
cousins.
"Why, Aunt Lydial" he exclaimed, "haven't you seen
Nina and Cecily before?"
Mrs. Middleton answered, rather hurriedly, "No ; I
happen not to have been in the school-room to-day."
Nina looked curiously at her mother for a minute, as if
wondering what phase of feeling had caused her to make
this evasive answer, since it was only about once in three
weeks that Mrs. Middleton ever came into the school-
room.
"Well, that is funny ?" said Mervyn; "we have had a
nice walk together, haven't we, Aunt Lydia? But I dare
say Nina and Cecily will have their turn in the after-
noon."
Mrs. Middleton looked rather uncomfortable, and Nina
blushed.
Mervyn went on : "I think it must be so funny to have
so many to be with, Aunt Lydia. You must find it so
difficult to see each one much every day. Mother has
only got me to be with ; and you have got Nina and Cecily,
and Edmund, and Totty, and Baby. Oh! and Willie, and

Rowley, and Cuthbert, when they are at home. Don't
you find it rather difficult P"
Mrs. Middleton, in the pauses of carving, answered that
a large family was, no doubt, inconvenient in more ways
than one.
"What are we going to do this afternoon, all of us?"
asked Mervyn, presently.
"What would you like to do?" inquired Mrs. Middle-
ton.
"Ride, I think," he answered; "my pony is here, you
know. Will you ride with me, Nina?"
Nina, with her eyes fixed on her plate, murmured some-
thing unintelligible.
The difference between her manner and Mervyn's
struck Mrs. Middleton forcibly, and she felt quite pro-
voked with her.
"Why cannot you answer pleasantly," she said, sharply,
"instead of looking as if your cousin had asked you to do
some disagreeable thing? If I were Mervyn I should not
wish to ride with anything so grumpy."
Nina blushed till the tears came into her eyes. The
fact was, there was nothing she wished so much as to
ride with Mervyn; but she was so unaccustomed to any
deviation from the usual rules, and so surprised at his
free way of talking before her mother, and so afraid every
moment that he would be snubbed, that she had been
struck dumb when he had pointedly addressed himself
to her.
"I didn't know if I might, mamma," she answered, in
a low voice.
"And could you not ask me?" said Mrs. Middleton.
"Do you think Mervyn would hesitate to ask your Aunt
Magdalen if he wanted leave for anything? Why cannot
you do the same?"
## p. 168 (#174) ############################################
168 THRO WW TOGETHER.
"Please let her come, Aunt Lydia," burst in Mervyn,
much astonished and dismayed at the result of his simple
request. He turned his bright animated face to his aunt
as he spoke. -
"For your sake, Mervyn, I will say yes."
The boy's gratitude and relief were great, and he thanked
her warmly.
"But what will you do, Aunt Lydia? You will be all
alone. Shan't you be dull?"
"I am going to drive to the station," she answered,
"to meet some people who are coming."
"Then I suppose I shan't see you again till I come
back," he said, as they all rose from the table; "so good-
by till then." And he ran up to her, and gave her a
kiss.
Mrs. Middleton said nothing, and looked rather odd
as she returned it. Whether she was annoyed or pleased,
it was impossible to say. But when she returned to the
drawing-room she sat down upon the sofa ;and thought.
Mervyn came down ten minutes after, ready for his ride,
and found the ponies and coachman at the door, and Nina
in her habit in the hall.
"Is he coming too?" he asked, indicating the coach-
man.
Nina nodded. Mervyn looked bored.
"You must lead the way," he said, as they started,
"because you will know the prettiest road. I cannot
think why the coachman comes. I could take care of
you quite well."
"He always rides with me," said Nina.
"Does not Uncle Rowley ride with you?"
"No, never."
"And Cecily?"
"Oh, Cecily's afraid. She won't even get on a donkey."
## p. 169 (#175) ############################################
MER VVN'S ARRIVAL A 7" GRANTOM. 169
"Isn't it rather dull riding alone with the coachman?"
"Yes, it is."
"He looks rather cross."
"So he is; very cross."
"What does he talk about P"
"Oh, he never speaks."
"Never speaks?"
" No."
"Doesn't he answer when you speak to him?"
"I never speak to him. I am not allowed to. Mamma
does not like it."
"Dear, dear! Do you ride along like two mutes?
How dreary dull it must be l''
"So it is. But it is better than walking with Madame
and Cecily."
"Mother and I have such delicious rides," said the boy,
after a pause. "We laugh and talk all the way along,
and oh, mother l'' he exclaimed, half involuntarily,
as the recollection came over him, and he turned his head
away to hide the tears that rushed to his eyes.
Nina looked pityingly at his averted face, and longed
to say something to comfort him.
Her feelings must have been expressed in her eyes; for
when Mervyn met the glance, he exclaimed, "You are
like mother, I declare. She said you were, and I said
Oh! I forgot. I can't tell you what I said."
"Oh, yes, do " said Nina.
"You would not like it, you know," said Mervyn.
"I assure you I should not mind," said Nina.
She was pleased and interested, and the face she turned
to Mervyn was a very bright one.
"What a pity it is you don't always look like that
and then I should never have said it !"
"Well, but what did you say?" persisted Nina.
H 15

"Well, I said the difference was that you always looked
cross, and she never did."
Clearly, Nina had not expected this answer, for she
blushed crimson, and turned away her head.
"Ah! now you are offended !" said Mervyn. "I told
you you would not like it. Why did you make me
say it?"
"No, I am not offended," said Nina; but her voice
was rather unsteady.
The fact was, the child was hurt and disappointed.
She had been pleased at the idea of her aunt and cousin
making her the subject of their conversation, and she
did not like to think that they should have such an opinion
of her.
She wondered if Mervyn's speech had made any dif-
ference in her aunt's feelings towards her. She longed
to ask, but was too proud. -
Finding Mervyn did not continue the conversation, she
got desperate, and tried to bring it on again.
"What else?" she said, in the voice of a martyr. "I
would rather hear everything."
"Oh, that was all !" he answered. "Let us have a
gallop."
It was ten minutes or so before their ponies were
walking again; and then Mervyn said, "But it is a pity,
isn't it?"
"What is a pity?"
"Why, that you always look so cross."
"I don't l" flashed out Nina.
"Oh, but you do, Nina. You can't tell, you know,
because you don't see yourself. I don't mean to say that
you always do, but you do very often. Now at luncheon
to-day, oh, dear me ! how cross you looked '''
"You don't understand," said Nina, moving rest-

lessly in her saddle. "I wasn't cross, exactly. It wasn't
quite that."
"What then?" asked Mervyn.
Nina hesitated. She looked at Mervyn's open face,
and felt she would never make him understand what
reserve meant, nor be able to explain the complications
of pride and sensitiveness.
"It is no use, Mervyn; you will never understand."
"Well, but tell me one thing. Was it because you
did not want to ride with me this afternoon?"
"Oh, no l'' exclaimed Nina, eagerly.
"Wasn't it really P I am sure I couldn't make out
whether you wanted to come or not. And I am certain
Aunt Lydia didn't know."
"I didn't want her to," said Nina, in a low voice.
"Did not want her to ?" exclaimed Mervyn, in un-
feigned astonishment; "why not?"
"I don't care for everybody to know what I like and
dislike," she answered. -
"But why?" persisted Mervyn; "what does it
matter?"
Nina hesitated again. The expression of her ideas and
feelings was a very unwonted thing with her, and she was
dimly conscious that in expression they lost a good deal
of their importance.
"It matters a great deal to me," she answered ; "but
you will never understand, Mervyn, so it is no use my
trying to explain."
"I wish you would try, though," said Mervyn. "It
seems to me such a trouble for nothing, to care so much
what people say."
"It's not so much what they say," said Nina, "as
what they might think."
"Think what P''
## p. 172 (#178) ############################################
172 THRO WW TOGETHER.
"Oh, all sorts of things."
"What does it matter what people think?"
Nina had no answer to make to such a novel idea, and
the cousins rode on in silence. 
"Who do you love most in the whole world?" was
Mervyn's next speech.
Nina was not at all prepared for such a question.
"Who do you?" she said, hastily, to gain time.
"Mother, of course," he answered. "Who else
should I love best ? I only asked you because you have a
father too, and I thought you might have a favorite be-
tween them."
Perhaps at any other time Nina would have had more
discrimination; but, being driven into a corner by her
fear of Mervyn's pressing his first question, she spoke
without reflection.
"You have got a father too, now," she said. "Lord
Wardlaw is your father."
The words were hardly out of her mouth, before she
would have given worlds to recall them.
Mervyn's face flushed all over. He looked at her with
an expression which quite frightened her, and then, giving
his pony a cut with the whip, he galloped away.
Nina rode quietly after him, feeling very remorseful;
and her relief was great, when at the turning of the road
she met him coming towards her, looking much as usual,
though there were traces of tears about his eyes.
They did not recur to the subject, and soon reached
home. By tea-time Mervyn had quite recovered himself,
and Nina did her best to make up for having given him
pain, by being quite conversational and lively. After tea
came lessons, and Mervyn strolled down-stairs to look for
his aunt. She was not in the drawing-room, so he rang
the bell, and asked if she had come in. He was in-

formed that some company had arrived, and that Mrs.
Middleton had gone up-stairs to show them to their rooms.
"Mrs. Middleton will be in her dressing-room, sir, I
think,'' the servant added.
Up to her dressing-room went Mervyn, three steps at a
time, and knocked at the door.
"Come in," said his aunt's voice.
"I've come to have a little talk," said Mervyn, ad-
vancing into the room, and seating himself at the end of
the sofa, on which Mrs. Middleton was lying. "Are you
tired, Aunt Lydia P Shall I fetch you some tea P"
Mrs. Middleton was surprised at her visitor, and still
more so at the boldness with which he penetrated into
her sanctum; but still she did not send him away.
"I have had some tea, thank you," she said.
"You don't look very comfortable, Aunt Lydia. Your
head is so low. Would you not like a pillow P"
Mrs. Middleton confessed it might be an advantage,
and was surprised at the skillful way in which the boy
arranged it under her head.
"Your tutor is coming to-morrow, Mervyn," she said;
"so you will have plenty to do now. He will be here
all the morning, and leave you work to occupy you in the
afternoon, which you may do in the school-room if you
promise not to disturb the girls. Then you will have
from luncheon-time till half-past four for riding or walk-
ing, and then work till six o'clock tea. After that you
are free. Of course, in the case of a game of cricket, or
bad weather, you can reverse the order of your afternoon's
work, and you may have a half-holiday on Saturday."
"Oh I do you have much cricket here?" exclaimed
Mervyn, eagerly.
"Who talks about cricket?" said a cheery voice; and
a hand was laid on Mervyn's shoulder.

"Mervyn, my boy! I'm delighted to see you!"
And, looking round, he saw Colonel Middleton.
"Uncle Rowley !" exclaimed the boy, springing up
and kissing him; "when did you come P"
"Just this moment," answered Colonel Middleton.
"Why, you are grown even since I saw you, Mervyn.
He'll be a fine man some of these days, Lydia 1" he said,
looking at his wife for admiration.
"So you are taking care of your aunt, are you ?
That's right. What's the matter, Lydia? Headache P"
"No," she answered ; "I was only resting after my
drive. The O'Briens have come, Rowley, and Mr. West.
You had better run down and see them."
"Shall I stay with you, or go with him?" said Mervyn.
Mrs. Middleton did not see the necessity for either
course, and was about to advocate a return to the school-
room, when Colonel Middleton answered for her.
"Yes, come along with me. Sir John is an old friend
of your mother's." And off they both went.
Mervyn wearied of Sir John and Mr. West after a time,
and began to wonder what his cousins were about. He
thought they could not know that their father had arrived,
or they would surely have run down to see him. So he
burst into the school-room with the news.
"Uncle Rowley's come."
"Has he?" said Nina, indifferently.
She was sitting at the open window, reading a book,
and Cecily was playing with her doll. Madame had gone
into her room to dry her brushes.
"How dull you look" said Mervyn. "Why don't you
come down P"
"We don't go down till a quarter to eight ever," said
Cecily, "and sometimes not then when there is company
here. Who's come, Mervyn P"

"The O'Briens, Sir John, and Mr. West," answered
Mervyn.
"All dullies," said Cecily: "we always call people we
don't know "dullies.' I hope they won't stay long. Where
have you been, Mervyn P"
"Oh, I've been sitting with Aunt Lydia in her dressing-
room."
"Sitting with mamma in her dressing-room P'' said
Cecily; "how very funny "
"Why do you laugh?" said Mervyn; "what makes
you think it so funny?"
"Oh, I don't know," said Cecily; "but it seems such
a funny thing to do. Did she ask you to come P"
"No," said Mervyn; "it was only that I couldn't find
her in the drawing-room, so I went up there and found
her.''
"But what did you want her for P" persisted Cecily.
"Oh, I don't know; nothing very particular; only to
have a talk with her.''
Cecily looked very surprised.
"A talk with her; how very odd l Fancy wanting to
have a talk with mamma | What did you talk about 2
I'm sure / shouldn't know what to say."
"I suppose that's because you're such a little girl,"
said Mervyn, rather puzzled. "Why, mother and I, when
I'm at home, sometimes talk together the whole afternoon.
I dare say you will when you're older. Nina would find
plenty to talk to Aunt Lydia about, I dare say; wouldn't
you, Nina?"
Now, Nina, though pretending to read, was listening
intently to this conversation, and feeling very glad that it
was Cecily, and not her, that was being questioned. She
was by no means prepared to have it so suddenly turned
upon her.

"Shouldn't I what?" she said.
"Have lots to say to Aunt Lydia," he repeated; "at
least, if she wasn't too tired to talk. You know, Nina,
I am afraid she is very tired to-day. She was lying down.
Does she often lie on the sofa P''
"YesnoI don't know ; I mean, I think she does,"
stammered Nina.
In a general way she would have answered indifferently,
but she felt rather ashamed to before Mervyn.
"It isn't a headache, you know," said Mervyn, "be-
cause Uncle Rowley asked her, and she said she was only
tired. Does she often have headaches, Nina P''
Nina blushed and hesitated.
"I believe she does," she said, confused.
"What do you generally do for her headaches?" was
the next question.
Nina blushed again, and then wondered why she should.
"I know a capital thing that I always do for mother,"
he went on, unheeding; "it's a handkerchief dipped
in eau-de-cologne and water and laid on the forehead.
Mother's headaches always get cured by that. Did you
ever try that P"
"No," said Nina, in a low voice.
"What do you do, then?"
"Nothing," said Nina, her truthfulness asserting itself
over her feelings of shame.
"I'm afraid you're not a good nurse, Nina," said
Mervyn, looking fixedly at her.
Nina tried in vain to get away from Mervyn's searching
eye.
"It's not my fault," she said, half crying.
She quite longed to explain to Mervyn how it all was,
and yet she felt it would be better for him to find it out
his own way.

"You don't understand," she said, restlessly.
Mervyn was seized with remorse at having made her
unhappy, and, embracing her warmly, begged her to talk
of something else.
"What do you generally do at this time?" he said.
"Let us have some fun ''
"What kind of fun?" said Nina, gently. She was
touched at his thought for her, and his caresses.
"A regular romp," he said.
"Oh, yes!" exclaimed Cecily, clapping her hands;
"and may I call Edmund? He does so like a romp."
"I will fetch him," said Mervyn, "while you clear
the room."
"You must take a message from Madame, Mervyn,"
said Nina, " or else you won't get him."
Madame's permission was soon obtained, and Mervyn
ran up to the nursery and delivered his message to Wil-
son, the head-nurse. She sent Edmund with the nursery-
maid into a back room to be got ready, and Mervyn
promised to wait for him. The baby was trotting about
in a lace frock and red ribbons; and Totty, in a brown-
holland pinafore, was sitting on the floor with a picture-
book in his lap.
"How smart the baby is l'' said Mervyn.
"Yes, sir; she's to go down to see Lady Lucy O'Brien.
I'm expecting her to be sent for every minute."
Just then a bell rang.
"There it is. I must take her down."
And Wilson carried the baby off, leaving Mervyn alone
with Totty.
The little fellow looked up, and, seeing a stranger,
seemed terrified.
"Don't be frightened, Totty," said Mervyn; "I'll
take care of you."

But the child was unused to strange faces, and he shrank
back. *
"Where's Nursey? I want her," he said.
"She's coming back," said Mervyn. "Oh, don't cry,
Totty "
But Totty could not stand it. He was so very shy and
nervous. Large tears gathered in his great, mournful
eyes.
Mervyn was much distressed, and did not know what
to do. -
"Oh, don't cry, little man " he said. "Look here !"
And he executed a somersault in the air to divert the
child's attention. He succeeded, for Totty laughed in
the midst of his tears.
"Again!" he said.
Mervyn did it again and again, and Totty laughed more
merrily each time.
Mervyn was bounding about with his back to the door,
so that he did not perceive that any one had entered, till
he saw a look of delight pass over Totty's face, and the
child stretched out his arms and said, "Nina 1"
"I came to see what made you so long, Mervyn. How
is it you are all alone with Totty?"
Mervyn explained.
Nina's face darkened when she heard the baby had been
sent for.
"But wasn't Totty frightened to be left with you?" she
asked.
Mervyn gave an account of his proceedings.
"He's so shy," Nina said, apologetically; "he sees so
few people, and he's so delicate."
"But Totty likes me now, don't you, Totty?" said
Mervyn; "you'll come to me now, won't you?" And
he held out his arms.

MER VVM'S ARRIVAL AT GRAMTOW. 179
But Totty didn't move, and Mervyn looked disap-
pointed. -
"Why won't he come, Nina?"
"He can't," said Nina, in a low voice.
"Can't!" echoed Mervyn. "Do you mean he can't
walk yet?"
Nina shook her head.
"Why, when I saw him in London, you said he would
run very soon."
"I thought so then, but"
"Why, Nina, is he so delicate as all that? Is he never
going to be strong, like other boys P''
Nina could not trust herself to speak.
"Poor little fellow !" said Mervyn, in a whisper.
"You needn't pity him," said Nina, harshly, haunted
as usual by the fear that Totty was being considered a
black sheep; "he's very happy."
As if in confirmation of her assertion, little Totty
looked up with a smile, and said, "Come and look at my
pictures."
"He likes you, Mervyn !" exclaimed Nina, surprised out
of her reserve; "he doesn't often speak to new people."
Just then the nursery-maid came in with Edmund, who
expressed himself ready to go down.
Poor little Totty's face clouded over. "Not me go,-
no," he said, shaking his head sorrowfully.
"Why shouldn't he come?" said Mervyn, lifting the
child in his strong young arms; and before any one could
object, he had carried him out of the room. "He'd like
to see us romping and jumping. Wouldn't you, Totty P"
he said, as they all went down-stairs together.
"Me coming too !" was the little fellow's delighted
answer, as he twined his arms confidingly round Mervyn's
neck.

When they got into the school-room, Mervyn estab-
lished him in a nice little corner, where he could see
everything that went on ; and then the game began.
Its nature was not very decided. It was called a romp,
and a romp it certainly was. Cecily and Edmund joined
in it with vigor; and Nina, though a little grand at first,
was soon carried away by Mervyn's spirits and Totty's
delight.
The confusion was at its height when the door opened,
and Mrs. Middleton, dressed for dinner, appeared upon
the scene, closely followed by her husband. She stopped
short in her astonishment.
The school-room table was pushed up against the win-
dow, and the chairs were heaped upon it. Mervyn, with
Edmund on his back, was racing wildly round the room,
jumping over little heaps of books and maps, that were
placed (evidently for the purpose) at measured intervals,
in full pursuit after Cecily, who was darting about with
inconceivable rapidity; while Nina blew a horn, and Totty
clapped his hands from his corner.
"Good gracious !" exclaimed Mrs. Middleton, "what
is the meaning of this uproar P"
"We're hunting," answered Mervyn, laughing and
breathless; "and we're having a capital run. Cecily's
the fox. Tally-ho Yonder he goes | Why do you stop,
Cecily? And, Nina, go on blowing the horn 1"
So saying, Mervyn, who was the only one who did not
seem discomposed at Mrs. Middleton's entrance, bounded
over a big heap of books, and, catching his foot in a loose
one at the top, measured his length on the floor, rolling
over Edmund as he fell.
"Bravo!" exclaimed his uncle, laughing; "you took
that fence well !"
"This will never do," said Mrs. Middleton. "Mervyn,

you must remember your cousins are young ladies, and you
must not teach them these rough games."
"Oh, nonsense, Lydia 1" said Colonel Middleton.
"What does it matter? It will do them all the good in
the world. They're much too prim and old-fashioned.
I never saw Nina look so animated ; and look what a color
Cecily has got. Little Totty, too! See how he enjoys it !"
"Totty '' exclaimed Mrs. Middleton. "How did Totty
get here?"
"I brought him down, Aunt Lydia," said Mervyn, run-
ning up; "he was so dull all alone in the nursery, and
wanted to come." -
Happily for all parties, the dinner-bell rang at that
moment, and Mrs. Middleton hurried away. Colonel
Middleton remained behind a moment to wish them all
good-night, and Mervyn and Cecily eagerly asked for leave
to go on with their game. Colonel Middleton ran off
laughing, declaring he would not be responsible; but he
was not sorry to find his laugh had been taken for assent,
when, as he ran down-stairs, he heard the uproar recom-
mence with greater force than ever; and Mervyn's ring-
ing voice reached him as he crossed the hall: "Tally-ho
Yonder he goes I'"
And so ended Mervyn's first day at Granton.

MRS. MIDDLETON'S HEADACHE.
THE order of the next day was rather changed. Mer-
vyn's tutor arrived at nine, and from that hour till nearly
luncheon-time he was closeted with him in a little room
looking out into the kitchen-garden.
There was comfort to come, however. His uncle in-
formed him at luncheon that Mr. West was a cricketer,
and that there was going to be a game in the field outside
that afternoon, which Mervyn was welcome to join.
This was great news for the boy; and he ran up to his
room directly to put on his cricketing-things and get his
bat. He looked into the school-room on his way down,
and found his cousins dressed for walking.
"Ain't you coming to watch the game?" he said.
"No," said Cecily; "we're going for a dull old walk
on the high-road. Isn't it a bore ?"
"Oh, what a pity! Shall I ask Aunt Lydia to let you
come and watch us, instead P''
"Oh, you can't go to mammal" said Cecily; "she's
shut up in her room, ill."
"Ill !" exclaimed Mervyn; "was that why she wasn't
at luncheon P I was wondering where she was. What is
the matter?''
"I don't know," said Cecily.
"Not know ! Nina, don't you know?"
"She has got a very bad headache, I believe," said
Nina.
## p. 183 (#189) ############################################
MA'.S. M/D/D/LA. TOM'S HAEADACHE. 183
"Has she?" he exclaimed. "Have you seen her,
Nina P''
" No."
"Ain't you going to her?"
" No."
Mervyn looked curiously at Nina; but he was begin-
ning to understand her a little; so he did not press the
question, but remained standing in the middle of the
room, swinging his bat round and round, and evidently
turning something over in his mind.
"How nice you look in your white flannel and blue
cap !" said Cecily, admiringly.
"Do I?" he said, absently. "I know what I'll do,"
he finished, suddenly. "I'll try my bandage dipped in
eau-de-cologne and water; I am sure it will do her good."
And he ran out of the room, leaving his bat behind him.
Nina had an instinctive feeling that a struggle had been
going on in her cousin's mind, and that it had been hard
for him to give up his favorite game for his aunt's sake.
She was filled with admiration for him, though she felt
fearful as to how his sacrifice would be received.
Mrs. Middleton was prostrate with a headache on the
sofa, and had given orders that no one should disturb
her; when, to her surprise, without knock or warning of
any kind, her dressing-room door slowly opened, and
somebody came in.
"Who is there? who is there?" she exclaimed; "you
can't come in 1"
"Oh, it is only me," said a clear young voice; and
the tone was so confident, so completely that of one who
merely meant to assert a perfect right, and was sure of a
welcome, that Mrs. Middleton said nothing more, and
only turned round to see who her visitor might be. To
her astonishment, she saw Mervyn, with a bottle of eau-

de-cologne in one hand and a half-filled tumbler of water
in the other, advancing quietly towards her.
"You, Mervyn ! No, no. I can't have any children
here now. I have got a very bad headache."
"Oh, I won't let any of the children come in, I assure
you," said Mervyn, as he deposited his glass and bottle
on a little table. "I'll shut the door, and we shall be as
quiet as possible."
"But what do you want?" she exclaimed.
"Well, only a pocket-handkerchief now," he answered.
"I got the water and the eau-de-cologne from Uncle
Rowley's dressing-room; but his handkerchiefs did not
do: they were not soft enough. Where do you keep
yours? Oh, I see in that drawer. Please don't move.
Here are some nice ones, like mother's. I shall want
two, you know. Is your head very bad?"
Taken by surprise, Mrs. Middleton answered, "Dread-
ful!" and, indeed, it was so bad just at that moment
that she felt incapable of asking the boy any questions,
or of making any further efforts to get rid of him.
She lay there, forgetful of his presence, till she was
reminded of it by feeling a cold damp something laid
gently across her throbbing temples. It felt like ice
against her burning head, and, closing her eyes with a
sense of keen pleasure in the sensation, she involuntarily
exclaimed, "How delicious!"
"I thought you'd like it," said the boy, triumphantly;
"and as soon as this gets the least warm, I have got
another ready. It is soaking in the glass now. You
need not tell me when you are ready for it, because it
will hurt you to talk. If you just move your hand, I
shall understand."
Too glad to avail herself of the permission, Mrs. Mid-
dleton lay still for some time, and then gave the required
## p. 185 (#191) ############################################

signal. Mervyn was watching for it, and instantly re-
moved the handkerchief; but, before putting on a fresh
one, he dabbed her forehead with the mixture, and then
blew softly on it. The effect was so charming, that Mrs.
Middleton found herself dreading every moment that he
would leave off. But he seemed to know exactly how
long to go on; and at the right moment he stopped, and
put on the cold bandage again.
By degrees Mrs. Middleton felt the pain in her head
lessen, and a delicious sense of drowsiness come over her.
The glare of light in the room, which, when she first lay
down, she had felt even though her eyes were closed, got
so subdued and pleasant that she began to feel quite
sleepy; and there was a monotonous droning sound in
the room, for which she could not account, but which was
very soothing and pleasant.
She was gradually dozing off, but was still conscious
that at intervals the bandage on her head was changed, as
soon as it grew at all too warm to be of use.
At last she remembered nothing more, till she woke
some time after, free from pain, and refreshed by her
nap. Opening her eyes, she found that the room was
carefully darkened, and that Mervyn was sitting at the
window, reading a book by as much light as he could
get; or, rather, not reading it, for it was lying in his lap,
and he was peeping through the blinds out of the window,
which looked on the cricket-field, and from whence rose
every now and then merry shouts of "Well caught !"
"Well bowled!" "Run it out ! Run it out !"
"Mervyn," she said.
The boy turned his bright, animated face from the
window, where he was watching the game, and jumped
up directly.
"Are you better, Aunt Lydia?" he asked, eagerly,

coming towards the sofa. "You've had such a nice
long sleep. Nearly an hour by my watch." .
"Yes, my dear boy," she answered, taking his hand;
"thanks to you, I am quite well. Why, how did you
learn to be such a good nurse and doctor? You are the
best I ever met with.
Mervyn's face shone with elation at these compli-
ments, and he stood by her side, triumphant.
"I never remember getting rid of this kind of head-
ache so quickly," she continued. "Indeed, I generally
have to wait for a night's rest to take it off. I should not
have got to sleep to-day so easily, if the room had not
been so nice and dark. By the way, how was that? I
remember the blinds were all up when I first came in to
lie down."
"Oh, I darkened the room," said Mervyn. "I knew
you would never get to sleep in that glaring light."
"It was very kind of you," she said, with more warmth
than she usually expressed, "and very thoughtful. You
must have done it very quietly, too, for me not to have.
heard it. But I am afraid, my dear boy, you must have
been very dull all this time in the dark. I hope you had
an amusing book."
"Well, not very," he answered; "but that did not
matter. It was the only one I could find that I thought
would amuse you. It was on the sofa, open, as if you
had been reading it; so I went on from your place."
"But I don't quite understand," said Mrs. Middleton;
"you were not reading it to me, were you? By the
way, I did hear a droning, monotonous noise as I went off.
Could that have been you reading out loud P"
Mervyn went off into fits of laughter; and his aunt
laughed too, partly with him, and partly at his delight
and amusement in what she had said.

MR.S. MyDD LA 7'OAV'.S HEADACHE. 187
"Why, that was me," he said, "reading you to
sleep." -
"Reading me to sleep?"
"Yes! Mother says there is nothing like reading out
loud for sending one to sleep, and I always do it to her.
What did you think it was P"
"Well, I thought it was a humblebee in the room, or
a blue-bottle. Then I fancied it might be the mowing-
machine in the garden."
Mervyn laughed more than ever at this. "You see, I
read softer and softer, till at last I got almost to a whisper,
and then I left off. If I had stopped suddenly, you would
have woke up directly."
"But what were you reading?"
"I don't quite know what it is," he answered. "It
was the only book I could find. I looked on your table,
but could only see 'A Treatise on Hair-wash," and "A
Hundred Ways to Cook a Rabbit.' It is a big book, and
rather dull." So saying, he handed his aunt an enormous
volume of "Graham's Domestic Medicine."
"Is this what you have been reading?" said his aunt,
laughing.
"Yes," he answered. "I read from "Headache, dis-
tressing,' to "Hydrophobia, causes of." When I got to
that I left off, for I saw you had gone to sleep."
"But were you not longing to play cricket all the
time P"
The answer was painted on the boy's open face, but he
only said, "Oh, as long as I was reading I was too busy
to think of it."
"But when you left off?" persisted Mrs. Middleton.
"Well, yesrather," he replied.
"Then why did you not go? I mean, you had done
all you could for me, and I was fast asleep."

"Well, you see, Aunt Lydia, I've got some rather
creaky boots on, and I was afraid of waking you if I
walked across the room."
Mrs. Middleton looked at him for a moment as if he
had been some natural curiosity, and then said, "Well, I
won't detain you any longer, dear. Run out and have
your game. Your uncle will be wondering what has be-
come of you. I think I shall come out myself presently.
I feel as if the fresh air would quite complete the cure you
have begun."
Mervyn jumped up eagerly and rushed off, giving the
door such a bang, as he went, that it nearly brought back
the headache he had taken such pains to drive away, and
effectually convinced his aunt that quiet was anything but
natural to him.
She lay on the sofa after he was gone, puzzling over
him. If she could have put him down as a "quiet boy,"
or a "drawing-room boy," she would have been more
able to account for his conduct of that afternoon. But
with the bang of the door still in her ears, and the up-
roar in the school-room the night before fresh in her
recollection, she was unable to put him down in the first
category. That there were "boys and boys" was one
of Mrs. Middleton's pet theories, manly, active, out-
door boys on the one hand, thoughtful, sedentary, "draw-
ing-room" boys on the other. What more likely than
that Mervynan only child, living entirely with a grown-
up person, without companionsshould have become,
even if it were not natural to him, accustomed to sit a
great deal in-doors, reading or otherwise amusing himself,
in a sedentary way? He could not really be fond of
cricket, or he would never have been able to give up the
game so readily and amuse himself in her room so long.
As she thought over it, she went to the window, to pull up

the blind. The first thing her eyes fell on was Mervyn's
graceful figure in its white flannels, relieved by his blue cap.
He was running full tilt after the ball, which had just
been sent to the farthest end of the field, and, snatching
it up, he hurled it with a tremendous swing at the distant
wicket with so true an aim that the bails flew up in the air.
"Well done !" shouted his uncle. "I thought we
should never get that fellow out."
The next batter sent the ball from the field into the
garden; and Mrs. Middleton could not but admire the
agility with which Mervyn climbed the ha-ha and swung
himself on to the lawn. He had hardly got back to his
place before a high ball came some way above his head.
He gave a bound in the air, and caught out the new batter
amid the applause of the rest. It was now his turn to go
in, and Mrs. Middleton watched him getting run after run
till she got tired of standing, and went back to the sofa.
She was more puzzled than ever. Of his fondness for
the game there could be no doubt; of his manliness and
activity there could be no question. Neither by nature,
habit, nor inclination, was he a quiet, sedentary boy.
How, then, was his conduct to be accounted for? It
had evidently been prompted solely by unselfishness and
consideration for her. As manly and as active as her own
elder boys, he was at the same time as thoughtful and as
gentle as a woman. How was it that her children were
not like this? she asked herself, rather bitterly. Not the
boys, perhaps; that was hardly to be expected; but the
girls? Nina, for instance, who was just Mervyn's age,
how was it that she was so different 2
"To be sure," she said to herself, "I am not often ill;
but I cannot remember a single instance of Nina attempt-
ing to come near me at such times, or even inquiring how
I was afterwards."

How different this boy was . How much he had
sought her out since his arrival How pleased he seemed
to be in her society Nina was so cold, so selfish, so in-
different ; Cecily, so silly and childish; the boys entirely
taken up with themselves and their own amusements.
Magdalen was certainly very lucky in her boy.
"There must be something wrong in my children's
dispositions," she said to herself again. "A screw loose
somewhere. I wonder what makes them so cold and
Selfish P''
So lay and pondered this woman, who with her own
hand had put from her the affections and driven away the
attentions that more loving mothers receive and encour-
age. She had missed, through her own fault, the watch-
ful care of little daughters, and the proud, protecting
affection of young sons. The tender solicitude, the
thoughtful consideration, which other women meet with
at the loving hands of their children, had never been
hers. In her selfishness she had never done anything to
promote or stimulate their love, and now she was hurt to
find it did not exist. With the want of self-blame so
conspicuous in her character, Mrs. Middleton did not in
her meditation arrive at this view of the matter, but con-
tinued to lay the blame on her children's natures. Dimly,
indeed, for a moment, some such thoughts as the above
came into her mind, as she contrasted the results of Mag-
dalen's training with those of her own ; but she thrust
them away directly.
"Mervyn must be a curious boy," she said to herself,
at last, as if to put such ideas more entirely out of her
head; "a very curious boy. Fancy a boy of his age sit-
ting for nearly an hour in a dark room, and with a game
he so delights in going on under his very eyes | I don't
understand it at all." -

And then she rose from the sofa and rang for her maid,
to assist her in preparing for going out.
Nina and Cecily were just returning from their walk
with Madame as Mrs. Middleton stepped out into the
garden. At sight of her mother, Nina stopped short and
blushed crimson; then, seeming to recollect herself, she
walked on with the rather defiant expression which she
often put on to hide her shyness. The fact was, she was
surprised to see her, and rather taken aback; for, struck
by Mervyn's conduct, she had been forming a plan of
trying to show her mother a little attention like him.
All the way along she had been making up her mind that
she would go to her room on her return, and ask how she
was, and whether she could do anything for her.
She could not help feeling it was right to follow Mer-
vyn's example, and show a little solicitude. But the
proceeding was so novel that she hardly knew if she
should be able to manage it. It would look so odd, she
had told herself; her mother would be so surprised.
Perhaps she might meet with a rebuff; and at the very
thought her pride had risen.
How often she had rehearsed her project during the
walk, in her own mind,how often she had first settled
upon, and then rejected, different ways of carrying it out,
would be incredible to any but such as she. Supposing
she knocked at the door very softly, and there was no
answer. What had she best do then P Would that mean
her mother was asleep? She could, of course, run away
very quickly, so that neither her mother nor any one else
should ever know she had knocked at the door and not
been answered. But then, supposing she met her father
or the lady's-maid in the passage, and they were to ask
her what she was doing there? Worse still, supposing,
on hearing her knock, her mother should say, "Who's
## p. 192 (#198) ############################################
192 7//?oppv 7'OGETHER.
there? You can't come in." Flight would again be her
only resource. But if her mother opened the door and
saw her speeding along the passage, what was to be done
then P Or, even if that did not happen, was there not a
danger of her mother saying before all the others, "Who
was that came bothering at my door?" She knew she
should blush ; of course she would. She always did when
she least wished to. And what explanation could she
offer? She felt it would be impossible to own why she
had knocked, after her mother had said, "Who was that
came bothering at my door?" She must find some excuse;
but what could it be 2 She could think of none. So she
had told herself it was no use; she must give up her plan;
and she had soothed her consciencewhich had pricked
at the sight of Mervyn's conductby telling herself she
was not to blame; it was somebody else's fault, though
whose she could not exactly say. But it wouldn't do.
Conscience had told her she had not done all she might
in framing an excuse for going to her mother's room; and
she had at last suddenly thought of gathering her a
bouquet of wild flowers. Then, if her mother called out,
"Who's there? What do you want?" or even if she
said, "You can't come in," the answer was ready, "It is
me, and I've brought you some wild flowers." Also she
might add, quickly, "You needn't have them if you don't
want them." At any rate, she would pick them, and then
see how she felt.
Accordingly, she had gathered her bouquet, and was be-
ginning to feel quite brave about her project; when, as
we have seen, everything was upset by meeting her mother
in the garden, apparently quite well again. The re-
vulsion of feeling was so abrupt that Nina quite started;
and then, feeling shy and guilty, and almost as if her
mother must guess what was passing in her mind, she hid
*

her flowers behind her, and tried to slip into the house
unobserved.
Fresh from the comparison between her own children
and her nephew, Mrs. Middleton was more than usually
alive to Nina's manner. She observed the action, too,
and in her irritation turned sharply round upon her.
"Where are you going to in such a hurry, and what
have you got in your hand?"
Nina blushed crimson, and stammered out, "Only some
flowers."
"Why do you hide them? And why do you get into
such a temper because I ask you a simple question ?"
Just at that moment Mervyn came bounding up, bat in
hand, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes.
"Oh, Aunt Lydia I'm so glad to see you out ! How
does your head feel now?"
"Yes, how is it?" stammered Nina, suddenly stricken
with shame. -
Mrs. Middleton looked at the two children as they stood
before her, waitiag for her answer. There was no mis-
taking which had made the inquiry from real interest, and
which had, as it were, forced herself to make it.
Mrs. Middleton addressed herself pointedly to Mervyn.
"Thank you, my dear boy, I am really quite well again.
I don't want forced politeness, Nina," she concluded,
coldly; "if you don't feel interest, pray do not oblige
yourself to express it; and if you do feel it, you certainly
are not happy in your manner of showing it. I wish you
would learn to be as thoughtful and unselfish as Mervyn,
and then there would be no need to put such a strain upon
yourself. Your inquiries would then come naturally; but as
it is, Fbelieve you take interest in nobody and nothing."
Nina could not stand it ; she turned round and ran into
the house. -

NINA AND MERWYN THROWN TOGETHER.
As time went on, Mervyn imperceptibly fell into the
ways of the family into which he had been thrown.
He became, like his cousins, surrounded by rules and
regulations, through which it was not easy to break. His
tutor occupied him all the morning, and left him a good
deal to prepare for the next day; so that he had only a
few hours in the afternoon he could really call his own.
School-room tea was at six o'clock, and a message
would come from headquarters during that meal as to
whether or not the children's presence would be required
in the drawing-room for ten minutes before dinner. If
so, then a toilette had to be gone through ; and if not,
they remained in the school-room till bedtime.
After the shooting-season began, and the house was full
of company, they were very seldom sent for. -
The first time after Mervyn's arrival that the messag
came up that they would not be required, his astonish-
ment was very great, and he could hardly believe he and
his cousins would not really see his uncle and aunt again
that evening, not even to wish them good-night. He
was bustling off to his aunt's dressing-room, to see if he
could find her there, but Nina advised him not.
"You won't find her, Mervyn."
"Why not P I did the first day." 
"That was quite a chance. When the house is full, she
always stays with the company till the dressing-bell rings."
## p. 195 (#201) ############################################
NIMA Awp MER vyw THRowy TogetII.E.R. 195
"Bother the company I wish they'd go. When
will they, Nina?"
"If these went, others would come; so it would be all
the same. From the first of September the house is
always full."
"But, Nina, how can you go to bed without kissing
Aunt Lydia and wishing her good-night?"
"If she doesn't care to say good-night to me, I don't
care to say good-night to her."
Little by little Mervyn began to see how matters stood.
He observed how seldom Mrs. Middleton came into the
school-room ; how the children never went to her unless
expressly sent for. He noticed the mother's demeanor
to the children at luncheon, and the effect it had upon
them. He saw that they were not at ease in her presence,
and that it gave them no pleasure to be with her. He
realized that Cecily was afraid of her, and that Nina was
more reserved and silent than ever when her mother was
present, only answering when pointedly addressed. They
were glad to get away, and she was not the least desirous
to keep them.
His mother had warned him that he must not expect to
find his aunt and cousins on the same terms as herself
and him; but he had not expected such a difference as
this. Between the mother and her interests, and the
children and theirs, he saw there was a great gulf fixed.
She lived her life, and they lived theirs, parallel lines
that never touched. He himself, accustomed to talk out
everything with his mother, felt the want of having a
grown-up person to speak to. Puzzled by what he saw
around him, he longed for some one to explain it to him,
or at feast to help him to improve it.
Had he had many opportunities of being with his aunt,
it would all have come out to her as naturally as possible;
## p. 196 (#202) ############################################
196 7A/A'O WAV 7 OGAE 7///z Ae.
but he belonged to the school-room and its life, and he was
"shunted '' like the rest. He saw his aunt at luncheon,
and sometimes during the ten minutes before dinner, but
alonenever. He made several attempts to see her, but
she was always surrounded by company; and after one or
two unsuccessful pilgrimages to the drawing-room, he had
given it up.
And the effect it all had upon him was to depress him
greatly. Sometimes the isolation of the school-room life
weighed upon him terribly; the want of sympathy between
the drawing-room and the school-room chilled him. He
felt he was in a cold, loveless home ; and as he contrasted
it with the warmth and love of the home to which he had
been accustomed, the loneliness of the atmosphere into
which he had passed seemed almost more than he could
bear.
Then the old longing for his mother would come across
him, and he would break out into passionate lamentations
at his separation from her. This would be late in the
evening, when the younger ones were gone to bed, and
Madame was dozing in her arm-chair. Nina, sitting by,
with her book, would observe the dejection of his attitude,
and his averted face, and, judging by what she would
prefer herself under the like circumstances, would pretend,
not to See. -
But it was not so that this child of so much love had
been accustomed to be treated. He was longing for the
sympathy that had always been his, and her apparent in-
difference chilled him the more.
But there were wells of feeling hidden under Nina's
calm little face, and her heart would swell with pity for
him. If only she could give it expression . If only she
could do something to comfort him |
Letting her book fall *her knees one night, she leaned

MINA AAD MEK Wyv THRowy ToGETHER. 197
her head upon her hands, and gazed at him as he sat
huddled up by the window with his face hidden; a whole.
world of pity in her dark eyes. Suddenly Mervyn looked
up, and their eyes met.
Something in their expression must have told him all
that the poor, stiff little tongue could not say; for the
boy rose up, and came and threw himself on the floor by
her side. -
"Kiss me, Nina '' the poor, forlorn child exclaimed;
"nobody ever kisses me now; nobody has since the even-
ing mother went away."
And Nina, moved with pity, put her arms round him,
and kissed him again and again.
"She'll soon come back," she whispered, soothingly.
"Say it again," whispered the boy, clinging closer
to her.
And Nina said it over and over again.
From that time they understood each other better; and
Mervyn, secure of sympathy, felt less lonely. He under-
stood that, cold and indifferent as Nina looked, she was
not really so ; and though he wondered why she was so
different to others, and why her manner was so ungracious,
yet he felt she was his friend, and he was comforted. He
took to watching her, and the more he watched the more
he was puzzled.
Mervyn was completely free from pride, and he could
not understand it in another. Her shrinking sensitiveness
he could not enter into ; her reserve, too, was a constant
astonishment to him. Often and often, in their long con-
versations out riding, or in the school-room before bed-
time, he would stop short in his surprise, and say, as he
had said in their first one, "Why, Nina, what does it
matter? Why should not people know?"
"I shouldn't like people to Wow. They might think." .

"What does it matter what they think?"
Nina, on the other hand, could as little understand
Mervyn's open fearlessness and unreserve. The way he
spoke out everything he thought, without fear of any one's
opinion, was so surprising to her, as was also his demon-
strative way of expressing his affection. She had, how-
ever, an inward admiration for it. She marveled at it ;
but it attracted her all the same. Undemonstrative as
she was herself, Mervyn's caressing ways did not displease
her. She began rather to like being kissed; and soon
she would not for the world have gone to bed without
Mervyn's affectionate farewell. But still, for a long
time, she maintained her reserve on most points, leaving
the talking to him. She was the listener, generally, in
their long so-called conversations. It was his curious
store of thoughts and fancies that came tumbling out
as they rode along together. She was always intelligent
and interested, but she seldom volunteered an idea of her
OW In.
She learned a good deal from him. His mind, from his
constant intercourse with his mother, was so much better
stored than Nina's. He had learned a great deal in that
way, which he would never have picked up otherwise.
Sometimes he would repeat things his mother had said,
and detail her opinions on various subjects. His con-
versation was discursive, but always attractive and origi-
nal. Religion came in in its turn, which made Nina
very shy. It was a subject on which she was more re-
served, if possible, than on any other. She rather con-
sidered it one "just for Sunday." She kept it as a thing
apart, and her own life flowed on without it. She did
not mix it up at all with her every-day life, or bring it to
bear on her difficulties and temptations. She considered
herself, her stern upright-self, with her strong sense of
*
## p. 199 (#205) ############################################
ATMA Aw MERVYM THRow Toge THER. 199
duty, quite sufficient for the overcoming of those difficul-
ties and temptations.
Yet she had a religion of her own; and a very stern
creed was hers. Truth at all hazards, uncompromising in-
tegrity and honesty, and a strict performance of religious
duties. She would have thought it wrong not to go to
church twice on Sunday, and she would not have run on
the Sabbath to save her life.
There was so much in the child that might have turned
to good in better hands. What she wanted was softening;
in other words, love. She judged all people by her own
standard. Those who failed in the virtues she admired,
were done for, in her eyes. The slightest deviation from
truth, the smallest appearance of a want of moral courage
and a desire to conceal, and the offender fell under her ban.
The little prevarications of society were hateful to her.
Her mother's civilities to people she knew she did not
care for, the little speeches she made savoring of false-
hood, were all observed by Nina, and her mother judged
accordingly.
The practice of saying "Not at home" she thought
positively wicked, and had long since made up her mind
that, when she came out, she should give the footman
private instructions to say, "Miss Middleton is at home,
but does not feel inclined to see you."
Nina's religion was as void of love as every other part of
her; in fact, she reproduced her experience in her religion
thus: God, like her mother, exacted such and such vir-
tues, and required the performance of such and such
duties; those who failed in them were punished hereafter.
There was no more love for his creatures and wish for
their happiness in God than she had been able to dis-
cover a love for herself and a wish for her happiness in
her mother. e
## p. 200 (#206) ############################################
2OO THROWN TOGETHER.
Now, Mervyn's religion was altogether framed on a
different idea. His, too, had grown out of his experience
and education. His efforts against his faults made his
mother happy; they likewise were pleasing to God. He
loved his mother, and tried to please her. He loved
God, and tried to please Him. His mother loved him,
and delighted to see him good and happy. God loved
him, and delighted also. His religion was all love; Nina's
all duty. Nina's might be called the Law, and Mervyn's
the Gospel. In conversation these differences often ap-
peared, particularly when, as time went on, Nina took to
talking more herself, and revealing more of her own char-
aCter.
She had a good deal to bear from him in some ways.
She had exalted some of her faults into virtues. Mervyn's
fearless hand would demolish her idols, and show that he
held as worthless what she deemed of value.
One evening, as they sat alone in the school-room, he
suddenly said, "I sometimes wish you were a little more
truthful, Nina."
"What do you mean?" said Nina, quickly.
"Well, I mean that I think, in a kind of a way, you
tell a great many stories."
"Mervyn !" she indignantly exclaimed, "I never told
a story in my life."
Mervyn was not at all discomposed by this outburst.
"That depends," he said, in his fearless way, "on what
you call a story. Mother says we may act stories, though
we should be ashamed to tell them. I don't suppose you
would say you had not done something you had ; but you
are always pretending you don't care about things that
you do, and all that sort of thing. It's no use your saying
you don't, Nina," he concluded,for a sound as of con-
tradiction reached him, "because I've watched you."
## p. 201 (#207) ############################################
M/MA AND MER VVM THRO WAV TOGETHER. 201
The boy, in his honest simplicity, had hit a deeper
truth than he had any idea of. For there is a form of
prideand poor little Nina's was of that formwhich is
an affectation before others of what does not exist in our-
selves. There are those who scorn affectation or deceit
of any kind, and plume themselves on being candid and
true to the very backbone, who yet, under the influence
of this kind of pride, will act falsehood they would never
tell. But it carries no weight with it; it fails entirely in
accomplishing its object, because nothing can be really
strong but what is true; and this is false, unreal,a pic-
ture before others. "You know, Nina," continued the
boy, "I think you are the most extraordinary creature in
the world; I do, really. You always pretend not to be
fond of Totty, and I know you are as fond of him as you
can be. Oh, yes, you are," he continued,disregarding
again an imploring sound, in which a more experienced
ear than his would have detected a most unmistakable
sign of tears, "I know you are ; and yet you want other
people to think you're not ; and if that isn't acting
stories," he concluded, hotly, "I don't know what is ;
and I'm sure it's very wicked."
Poor Nina | Every one of Mervyn's bluff words had
cut deep into her heart. Two or three times she had re-
strained herself, for she was ashamed of showing her feel-
ings, on the one hand, and, on the other, her proud little
spirit rebelled against being found fault with ; but when
he ended with "I'm sure it's very wicked," she could not
bear it. The long-pent-up tears would come, and she
burst into a violent fit of crying. "Oh, Mervyn, I do love
Totty; I love him so awfully, that I can't bear to talk
about it ; andand"
But in a minute Mervyn's arms were round her, and he
was asking her pardon over and over again for having

made her unhappy, and promising he would never men-
tion the subject again.
Nina allowed herself to be caressed and comforted, and
did not bear him any malice.
"I don't mind you knowing I love him, Mervyn, as
long as you don't tell any one else. Promise me you
won't." And Mervyn, with his arms still round her,
promised eagerly. But the lesson took root all the same,
and bore fruit in after-times. -
Another time, Mervyn had been explaining some pic-
tures in a Scripture story-book to Edmund, one Sunday
afternoon; and Nina, while reading her own book, had .
been every now and then attracted by what she heard him
saying, and had tried to listen.
When the little boy had gone to bed, and the school-
room was dark, and deserted by all but her cousin and
herself, she came up to Mervyn, who was watching the
glow-worms in the garden from the open window, and
said, "What was that you were telling Edmund this after-
noon?"
Mervyn was heart and soul in the glow-worms, and did
not at first remember to what she was alluding ; but, after
a few minutes' thought, he said, "Oh, you mean the
Scripture picture-book. I was only explaining to him
about Jesus Christ loving us. We were looking at a pic-
ture of Him blessing little children, and Edmund asked
me why He did it."
"And what did you say?" asked Nina, turning away
her head.
"Oh, only just told him, you know."
"Yes, but told him what?"
"Why, just what you would have told him yourself, if
you had been explaining it to him."
Now, Nina did not much like showing Mervyn her
## p. 203 (#209) ############################################
AW/AWA AAWD MEAC P VAV ZAZA'O WAV 7TOGAE 7THEA'. 2O3
ignorance, and yet the wish to hear what he had said was
very strong.
"Well, but tell me just what you were telling him. I
want to hear how you said it."
"I told him it was because He loved them, and loved
them so much that He died for their sake. Then Edmund
asked me how much ; and I said even more than our mothers
love us. I didn't know how else to explain. But I couldn't
say more than that, could I?" And the peculiar smile
radiated his face, which always broke over it when he
thought of his mother. -
No answer from Nina.
"Mother says," he went on, with glowing eyes, "that
God sends us mothers to show us how to love Him. We
couldn't, she says, learn how to love Him all at once, be-
cause it's so difficult. So He teaches us to love our
mothers first, and then by that we learn to love Him. So
that makes it quite easy, doesn't it, Nina P"
"Yesbutsuppose," said, Nina, slowly, 'suppose
we don't love our mothers, how are we to learn then P''
"Oh, but then I never heard of such a thing as that,
you know."
A short silence ensued. It was broken by Nina.
"How can we love any one we have never seen P /
can't."
"Oh, that is because you think to love any one you
must be always sitting with them, and kissing them. But
mother says that is not the only kind of love."
This was certainly more Mervyn's creed than Nina's;
but she let it pass, because she wanted to hear what else
he had to say.
"She says the real best way of showing love to any one
is to try and please them. Well, we can do that whether
we have seen them or not. So when we try to please
## p. 204 (#210) ############################################
. 204 7 HA'O WAV 7'OGETHER.
God, we are loving Him; don't you see? You do that,
I suppose ?"
"No," she said, "I don't think I do."
"But you could if you liked P"
"No," she repeated, "I don't think I could."
"Well, but, Nina, you can understand trying to please
your mother? Well, don't you see it is much the same?
The things that please our mothers please God too. The
same things please both."
A very curious expression passed over the girl's face at
these words. She looked as if she could have said a good
deal if she chose ; but, by an evident effort, she restrained
herself, and only said, "What sort of things?"
"Oh, all the right things, you know. Being obedient,
and kind to every one, and trying to help people who want
help, keeping down our tempers, and not being put out
when things go wrong, Loh you know them all, Nina,
as well as I do. But what I mean is, that when we do all
these things we are loving God, whether we know it or
not, because we are trying to please Him and to be like
Him."
"But, Mervyn," she objected, "nobody ever does all
that. One reads in little story-books of people doing so,
and in the Bible that our Saviour did it all ; but I never
saw any one really like that."
Mervyn looked at her in astonishment for a minute or
two, and then said, "Ah! that is because you don't know
mother as I do."
"Does she always " asked Nina.
"Always," he answered, proudly. "I never saw mother
angry, or put out even, or anything that is wrong. She
is always gentle, and kind, and patient, and loving to
everybody. Oh, motherl' he concluded, with quiver-
ing lips, as the image he had conjured up brought her

vividly before him, "there is no one like you in the whole
wide world,no one l''
And Nina, meanwhile, was battling hard with herself,
and trying to keep down a voice in her heart, which, try
as she would, kept on ceaselessly saying, "She is never
gentle, or patient, or kind. She is loving to no one.
She thinks only of herself. I have seen her in a passion
over and over again."
"It's not my fault if I don't understand," she said,
half out loud.
"What is not?" asked Mervyn.
"Oh, nothing," she answered, alarmed.
"When I was quite a little boy," said Mervyn, laugh-
ing, "I used to tell mother I was quite sure Jesus Christ
was not a bit better than her ; or, at least, that she was
quite as good as Him. She used to say, 'Oh, hush l'
She couldn't bear me to say it. There was a picture of
Him in a book, and underneath was written, "He went
about doing good.' I used to say it was an exact descrip-
tion of her. She always stopped me ; but it was true all
the same. Then when she said she wanted me to grow
like Him, I used to say, I would rather grow like her.
The fact was, it was much the same.''
"And did you?" asked Nina.
"Oh, no," said Mervyn; "I never could manage to
grow like either. I never do anything I ought."
"Yes, you do," said Nina, eagerly. "You are always
kind and loving to every one. I can't think how you
manage it, but you are. Oh, Mervyn ! I wish I was like
you."
"Like me, Nina P" said the boy, and he blushed scarlet.
"Oh, if you only knew I am not a bit unselfish, or pa-
tient, or anything that is good."
"Well, but you're better than me,'

lessly. "I don't believe I try, even. It is so difficult,
Mervyn."
"Yes, it is awfully difficult. My particular things
seem so difficult. But then, mother says, everybody
thinks it is their own particular things that are so difficult;
so she says that is no excuse at all."
"What are your particular things, Mervyn P"
"Mother knows," he answered, blushing deeply.
"Tell me yours," he added, hastily, to change the con-
versation. - -
Nina glanced with curiosity at him, noticing the re-
serve that had suddenly crept over him. She wondered
whether in this character, outwardly so fair, there was a
hidden and unsuspected flaw. She felt she had not got
to the bottom of Mervyn quite, and wondered if she ever
should. Only He, unto whom all hearts are open, knew
what that flaw was. Circumstances were to develop it
hereafter ; and God held the instrument in his hand.
"I think I know what yours are, Nina."
"Tell me," said Nina; "no, don't! Oh, yes, do I
At least begin, and I'll stop you if I don't like it."
"Oh, well," said Mervyn, "I don't mean that you
never do try; but I know how you might, if you liked.
First of all, you might talk to poor old Madame a little
more, and be a leetle kinder to Cecily and Edmund.
Then you might smile when Aunt Lydia speaks to you at
luncheon; and not try to hide from everybody how you
love Totty, and 3 *
"Oh, Mervyn," she exclaimed, "those are just the
impossible things I''
"Just what I said once to mother about mine!"
"And what did she say?"
"She taught me this verse: 'The things that are im-

"There!" said Nina, triumphantly, "the Bible says
they are impossible too."
"But wait," said Mervyn; "I hadn't finished. You
shouldn't interrupt me in the middle; "are possible with
God.' That means He'll help, and make them possible.
I can't explain like mother, Nina; but if you try, you'll
see. Now let's come and look at the glow-worms."
Nina sighed deeply; but, even as she sighed, the idea
of a Strength outside herself entered for the first time into
her mind.

"How do you manage to be so kind and mice to every
one? You can't care for them all?"
"Oh, yes, I do. I care for them every one."
"What Cecily, and Edmund, and mamma, and Ma-
dame, and all?"
"Oh, yes; each one in a different way."
"When you ask Madame how her rheumatism is, is it
to please her, or because you think you ought?"
"Oh, I really want to know."
"But why?" *
"Poor old thing! I like her; and I am sorry to think
she should be in pain."
"Oh, well, it must be very nice to love every one, and
must make it much easier. I am sure it is easier for you
than for me. I can't like people, somehow. I can't see
anything to like in them, or any reason why I should like
them."

everybody else because He does. Now, you think of the

show you how easy it would be. You needn't tell me
who you think of."
Away flew Nina's thoughts to a little bed up-stairs,
where her baby brother lay sleeping. And as her heart
swelled at the thought of him, it told her how gladly she
would do anything in the world for him; how willingly
she would sacrifice herself to please him; and how any
one that he loved would gain her affections immediately.
And so, through her love for her little brother, there
stole into the wayward little heart a faint glimmer of the
power of that higher love which worketh in us both to
will and to do of His good pleasure.
"I see, Mervyn," she said, after a few minutes; "and
now I am ready to look at the glow-worms."
>k  >k >k >k
Mervyn's influence gradually told upon Nina. Imper-
ceptibly she softened, and came out of her reserve. This,
in its turn, acted upon him. As he found in her more
and more of a sympathetic companion, he grew happier
and more reconciled to his life. They became the most
inseparable of companions. Mervyn came to her with
everything. His mother's letters were shared with her;
his hopes for their future reunion were poured into her
ear. Her sympathy was ever ready ; and she strove with
all her might to make up to him, in some small degree,
for his separation from his mother.
Her life was, no doubt, happier for the change. The
call he made on her love and sympathy drew her out of
herself, gave her an object in her life, softened and
warmed her. Her face now seldom wore its accustomed
scowl; a gentler expression had come into her always
beautiful eyes; and the likeness which Mervyn had at first
refused to see now struck him forcibly. She was no longer
incased in an armor of coldness and reserve; she forgot

7 HE GAMOS 7" ZAV ZALE S/ZR UB BAER Y. 209
herself, in fact, in her desire to keep Mervyn happy.
What she dreaded most was to see his face overcast; she
could not bear him to be depressed by the life which
habit had made so natural to her; and she was always
watching fearfully for the moments when his longing for
his mother should overcome him and make him listless
and dejected. But it was only now and then that he was
cast down. Thanks to Nina, his fits of sorrow came now
less violently, and at much longer intervals. His natural
high spirits and power of enjoyment asserted themselves
over the uncongenial circumstances in which he found
himself thrown; and no one who heard him laughing and
talking with Nina, as they galloped over the country,
would have supposed he had a care or sorrow in the world.
CHA PTE R XV.
THE GHOST IN THE SHRUBBERY.
NINA was now always glad, for Mervyn's sake, when
they were sent for before dinner, little as she cared for it
herself. -
But as the shooting-season went on, the house was fuller
than ever, and at one time nearly three weeks had elapsed
without a summons.
At last, one evening it came. Mervyn was delighted;
and his spirits rose so high that Nina felt quite pleased
to O.
But it was an unfortunate evening. Mrs. Middleton
was in a bad temper, and found fault with Nina directly
she came into the room. Cecily, too, was awkward, and

managed to upset a flower-stand. There was nothing but
scolding all the time. Colonel Middleton was tired with
his day's shooting, and lay in an arm-chair, reading the
paper, and taking no notice of any of them.
On their return to the school-room, Mervyn's spirits
gave way.
Nina waited till Cecily had gone to bed, and then came
up to the window where he was sitting.
"What is the matter, Mervyn P"
"Oh, Nina " he exclaimed, with a burst of tears, "I
do want mother so badly."
Nina bent down and kissed his forehead, taking refuge
in her old answer.
"She will soon be back again."
"No one seems to love any one in this house," he
went on, passionately; "it is a dreadful house to be in."
Nina was powerless to comfort him. She felt how true
it was. Had she not often suffered from the same feeling
herself?
But she had a cure which had never failed her at such
times. She would try its power now.
"Come and see Totty," she whispered.
The boy raised himself wearily and followed her with-
out a word.
So the two children stole up-stairs and went softly
along the passages to the bedroom nursery, where Totty,
not quite asleep yet, lay expecting his nightly visitor.
Nina knelt down by his pillow, and signed to Mervyn
to kneel on the other side of the bed.
The little fellow smiled when he saw them, and held up
his face. "Nina," he said, sleepily, "kiss me, Nina."
"Kiss Mervyn," whispered Nina; "he wants to be
kissed too."
Totty put one arm round Mervyn and one round Nina,

drawing them together as they knelt. He was only half
awake, and soon his arms relaxed their hold and his
heavy eyes closed.
Gradually he fell asleep; but the children knelt by his
bedside still.
Nina was always glad to linger, and Mervyn shrank
from leaving the little oasis of love and tenderness he
had found in the desert of Granton.
He knelt there silently for some time, and then he
whispered, "Let's say our prayers here."
Softly he repeated his evening prayer, and began "Our
Father;" then stopped, waiting for her to join.
But no sound came from the little bowed figure kneel-
ing in the darkness, and he finished it as he began it, L
alone.
"Come away now," he whispered ; "I'm better."
And, taking her unresisting hand, he led her away.
They returned, as noiselessly as they came, to the now
dark and silent school-room.
"Come out," said Mervyn. "I don't want to go
back into that dreary room."
So they went down a little back staircase, and opened a
side door.
The moon was shining peacefully all over the lawns and
gardens as the children stepped out upon the grass, and
made fantastic shadows of the two little figures.
Lights were seen at the dining-room windows, and the
voices of the gentlemen sounded from within as they sat
over their wine.
"Come into the shrubbery," whispered Nina.
The way there led them past the drawing-room window,
and they could see in. The ladies were sitting in groups
all over the room. There was one old lady to whom
Mrs. Middleton was paying great court. These two were

near the open window, looking over a photograph-book;
and Nina fancied she caught her own name as she hur-
ried by.
The children sped on towards the shrubbery. As they
passed into its sombre paths, they came against the figure
of a man, and Nina started.
"It's only me, miss,"
gardener.
"Good-night, Watson," said Mervyn, pleasantly.
"Good-night, sir. You're out late this evening."
"Yes," said Mervyn; "we've come out for a little
air.''
"I suppose you and Miss Middleton are not afraid
of ghosts, sir, since you are going up to the shrubbery P"
"No," laughed Mervyn. "But is there a ghost
there P''
"So the story goes," answered the man. "I can't
say I've ever seen it myself; but they do say it is to be
seen on moonlight nights, and those who see it are
haunted by it for many a long night after."
"What is it?" asked Mervyn. "A shadowy lady, or
a man with his head in his hand, or what?"
"They say it's a pair of brothers," the gardener an-
swered, smiling. "They fought a duel there one moon-
light night, for the love of the same lady, and both
were killed. So they are doomed to walk arm-in-arm for-
ever on moonlight nights. They have eyes blazing like
live coal, they say, from the hatred they bear one another.
But, Lor' bless you, sir, it's all nonsenseit's just a tale,
and nothing more. Good-night to you." And the man
passed on.
"Did you ever hear the story before, Nina?" asked
Mervyn, as they walked along.
"No," she answered. "I have heard the maids say
said the voice of the head-

the shrubbery was haunted ; but I never asked more.
I hate ghost-stories."
"Do you?" he said. "I think they are rather fun.
Why should you mind? You don't believe them, do
you?"
"No," she answered; "not exactly; but they frighten
me all the same, and I think of them when I don't want
to, particularly when I can't sleep at night. Let us talk
of something else."
A short silence, and then Mervyn said, "Nina, why
wouldn't you join with me when I said "Our Father'?"
"I don't know," she answered, in a low voice.
"Oh, you must know, Nina."
"I was shy."
"Shy who of? Not me, surely 1"
Nina nodded.
"Oh, Nina, how funny! And what a funny thing to
be shy about ! I can fancy being shy of doing anything
wrong; but to be shy of saying your prayers I never
heard of such a thing."
Nina felt really shy now.
"It isn't exactly that," she said; "I can't quite
explain."
"No," he answered, "I don't suppose you can."
They had now reached an open part of the shrubbery,
and as they moved out of the darkness into it they were
struck by the beauty of the scene they came upon. The
lake lay before them, full in the light of the silvery moon.
There was not a sound to be heard, and their eyes were
almost dazzled by the glitter of the moonbeams on the
waters. The peace of it, and the beauty of it, affected
Mervyn strangely.
"Oh, Nina " he exclaimed, "how beautiful | I think
heaven must be like this; don't you?"

Nina didn't answer.
"Don't you often wonder what heaven is like?"
Still no answer.
"Why don't you speak, Nina? Don't you like talk-
ing about heaven P''
"YesnoI mean, I don't know what to say about it."
"But don't you often wonder about it?"
"No, I don't think I do. But you may go on talking
about it if you like. What do you think it's like P"
"I don't know exactly. One thing I'm sure it's not
like, and that's Granton.''
"I don't quite understand," said Nina.
"I mean that in heaven everybody loves everybody.
Mother says heaven is only another name for love.
There's not much of it at Granton," he said, rather bit-
terly, as he recalled his feelings on their return that even-
ing from the drawing-room. "So heaven can't be very
like Granton ; and if I thought it was, I'm sure I shouldn't
care to go there."
"Is it like Glen-Mervyn, do you think?" asked Nina,
timidly.
"More like, I think," he answered ; "at least when
mother is there. Not unless," he added, quickly, as
memory brought before him the lawns and gardens as
they had looked that day without her. "Oh, no l'" with
a little shudder, "not unless."
Nina seemed to be thinking deeply, and at last she said,
"If Aunt Magdalen were here, would you think Granton
more like heaven P''
"Oh, yes!" he said, eagerly.
"Well, but then," said Nina, rather puzzled, "it is
having her with you that makes you think a place like
heaven."
"Yes," he answered ; "and she says it will be being

with God that will make us so happy in heaven. Do you
know, she says she wouldn't care to go to heaven if God
were not there P''
Nina looked very puzzled, and a little scared.
"'In thy presence is the fullness of joy,'" said Mervyn;
"that is her favorite verse about heaven. She says it ex-
plains it so well. Do you understand it, Nina P"
"Do I understand what?"
"Why, that some day we shall love God so much that
we shall only be happy where He is, wherever that may
be.''
"No," she said, hardly above a whisper.
"Sometimes I think you never will."
"Do you ?"
"Well, just a little. I understand it this way, you see.
I know that I love mother so much that I am happiest
when I am with her. And so that helps me to see that
some day, when I love God as much as that, I shall be
happiest with Him. She says I shall understand it better
and better."
"But why do you say I shall never understand it?"
"Because you don't love your mother, Nina, and so I
don't see how you are ever to learn."
"But I love Totty," she said, quickly.
"Well, perhaps that may help you a little, but still
It doesn't seem to make you love other people,
Nina. I really think he is the only person. In heaven,
every one will love every one, and you love so few. She
says it's quite made of love But still," he said,
suddenly breaking off short from his train of reasoning,
and returning with a child's delight to the thought of
a material heaven, as he gazed on the lovely scene around
him, "besides all the love and the happiness, I dare say
there will be all this, and more. The moonlight, and the

beautiful stillness, the golden gates, and the angels, and
Hark! what's that?"
It was the sound of approaching ootsteps, and Mervyn
drew Nina back into the bushes, and both children peered
out eagerly into the darkness. Far down the shrubbery
path they saw two dark shadows approaching, and shining
from the figures were small red lights.
"What are they, Mervyn P" whispered Nina, seized
with a superstitious dread; "what can those shadows be?"
The gardener's story, so lately heard, forced itself upon
her unwilling attention; and, in spite of all she told her-
self to the contrary, she could not deny the witness of her
own eyes, which simply showed her, advancing steadily
along, two dark forms, arm-in-arm, with eyes like live coal.
At all times sensitive and imaginative, Nina's nerves were
just then strung to their highest pitch. The hour, the
scene around, the thoughts on which her mind had been
so lately dwelling, all conspired to lift her out of the
commonplace and to intensify her superstitious dread.
She felt herself to be suddenly standing on the narrow
boundary-line that separates the real from the unreal, the
natural from the supernatural; and she was, for the mo-
ment, unable to distinguish between the material and the
spirit world. Only one thought was clear: she wished she
had never come. She shivered before the slow approach
of the shadows, and longed to drive them back. Not only
did she dread them for the time, but she felt the thought of
them would forever haunt her, and nights of future terror
rose before her. Had not the gardener said as much just
now P She would have fled, but her feet seemed rooted
to the ground.
Mervyn was transfixed too, but it was more by wonder
than by fear. And now the shadows were close at hand.
But the mystery was soon cleared up.
## p. 217 (#223) ############################################
THE GA/OST /AW THE SHA'UBA EA' Y. 217
Two figures came out into the moonlight, and stopped
to look at the scene on which the children had been gazing.
They were those of two gentlemen staying in the house,
come out to enjoy a stroll and smoke. Their loud voices
and the smell of their cigars seemed to destroy the peace
and sweetness of the night. A passing cloud obscured
the moon at the same moment, and completed what their
presence had begun, bringing a blight on all around. Well
might Nina have dreaded their approach. No denizens
of an unseen world could have wrought her more ruin in
the present, or had power so to haunt her with consuming
fears for the future.
The two gentlemen walked on, talking.
"How many children has Middleton?"
"Oh, a large family; seven or eight, I believe."
"I saw a very pretty little boy at the nursery-window
this evening; but he looked terribly delicate. What is
the matter with him P''
"Well, that's a sad business. He has never had a
day's health since he was born. I only wonder he has
struggled on so long. But he will never live to grow up,
poor little fellow poor little fellow ! 7 y
And the voices and footsteps passed away down the
other side of the water, and were lost in the distance.
Like birds of evil omen they had come, and everything
rejoiced at their departure ; and the air grew still again,
and the sweet scents of nature resumed their sway, and
the moon shone out peaceful as before. Only one thing
was wanting. The trees, waving slightly in the breeze,
seemed to bend their heads and listen, as if waiting for
that missing sound, as if listening for the childish voices
to speak again of love and heaven. But they waited
and listened in vain. When the moonbeams reached
one of the two little figures in the bushes, they revealed

a face from which all life and color seemed to have
fled.
"Nina l' exclaimed Mervyn, terrified. "Nina 1 speak
to me ! Don't look like that '''
"Mervyn !" she gasped, " did you hear what they
said P''
"Mervyn," she entreated, without waiting for an
answer, "it isn't true, is it?"
And she clung to him as she spoke, looking as if life
and death hung upon his answer.
"No, no, Nina darling," he said, soothingly; "it
can't be true. They don't know. They have made a
mistake."
"But, Mervyn," she whispered, faintly, "if it should
be true !"
"Come home," he said, gently, but very firmly. "I
won't let you think about it. Their saying it doesn't
make it true. Don't think about it, Nina. Forget it."
His assumption of manly contempt for the assertion,
and his protecting care, gave her courage for a moment,
and she allowed him to lead her home. They passed
again the lighted drawing-room, now full of gentlemen,
laughing or talking, and drinking tea.
The child, flitting by in the darkness, had time to see
her mother, the gayest of the gay, fanning herself and
chatting gayly; had time even to see the door open, and
the two smokers enter; to see the very one who had pro-
nounced Totty's death-warrant take a chair by her mother's
side, and enter, laughing, into a conversation with her.
The child could hear the mother's loud laugh even at
that distance, and it jarred upon her till she turned shud-
deringly away.
"Can she know?" she asked herself; "can she really
know?"
## p. 219 (#225) ############################################
7THE GAMOS 7" ZAV 7THE SAWA' UEAPAA' V. 219
Only too readily the answer came, with the quick stern
judgment of the young :
"She knows, and she does not care /''
Wildly her heart swelled with the old indignation that
Totty should be so despised and uncared-for. It bore
down even the fresh new grief with which she had been
overwhelmed just now.
She let Mervyn lead her up-stairs, and, hardly knowing
where she was, or what she was doing, she found herself
standing at her bedroom door.
"Good-night, Nina darling, and promise not to think
of it again."
And Mervyn held both her hands, waiting for her
answer. The child's lips quivered, but she could make
no sound. She knew she could not promise what he
asked her. She held up her face to be kissed, and Mer-
vyn was satisfied.
But all night long the words rang in her brain, keeping
sleep away from her weary eyelids, and causing her to toss
to and fro in her restless anxiety.
"He will never live to grow up
grow up poor little fellow

Only varied by the constant question, "Can she know?
Can she really know?". Or the bitter, bitter answer,
"She knows, and she does not care."

horror that rose before her as she watched the shadows

SUNDAY AT GRANTON.
THE next day was Sunday; and ten o'clock found
Mervyn sitting in the school-room with his cousins. His
tutor did not come on Sunday. Nina and Cecily were
learning their collects and writing them out by heart, and
he was writing to his mother. Madame was not in the
room.
Conversation was carried on chiefly between Mervyn
and Cecily. Nina was nominally doing her Sunday work,
but in reality she was thinking of Totty, wondering over
and over again how much truth there might be in the con-
versation she had overheard. Her sleepless night had left
its traces on her pale little face. She hardly heard what
the others were saying.
"Mervyn," said Cecily, "which part of the pew are
you going to sit in to-day ?"
"As far as I can from you," he answered, laughing,
"because you fidget so."

"Oh, no, I won't, Mervyn; please sit by me."
"Why, last Sunday you dropped your prayer-book
twice, and tumbled over the hassock every time you stood
up."
"There'll hardly be room to stand up to-day. There
are such a lot of people in the house. I think there are
four ladies besides mamma, and six gentlemen besides
papa. How full the pew will be l''
"Why do you want to sit by me?" asked Mervyn, as
he wrote down a sentence in his letter.
"You're so kind, and find my places. Nina never
Will.''
"Why don't you find them before you go?"
"Such a trouble," she sighed; "I never can remember
those horrid old Roman figures. I think it was so silly
of them to have letters for figures; don't you? W.'s and
X.'s, and all that rubbish."
Mervyn laughed. "All right; I'll sit by you."
Cecily evinced much delight.
"I think it's rather fun having a lot of people in the
pew," she went on. "I like seeing how they behave, and
what sort of things they do, whether they take off their
gloves and veils, and whether they smell salts, and fan
themselves, and all that. I always think any one who
fans themselves affected. Then I like to see who kneels
at the prayers, and who is lazy, and sits or lolls instead,
and who listens to the sermon and who doesn't. It's
great fun. Papa always goes to sleep. Do you think
that's quite right of him, Mervyn 2 Nina thinks it's very
wrong indeed. I think it's rather unkind to poor Mr.
Heathcote, who's taken such trouble to make a nice
sermon. I believe it takes him a long time. It seems

"Do you listen, Cecily?"

"Oh, no, Mervyn ! I can't help thinking about other
things. I do try a little, but I get tired directly."
Just at that moment, to the children's astonishment,
the door opened, and Mrs. Middleton came into the
room. She was accompanied by an old lady, and in her
Nina instantly recognized the one to whom she had seen
her mother paying court the evening before through the
drawing-room window.
"These are my little girls," said Mrs. Middleton, "and
this is my nephew, Mervyn Lyndsay. Children, come
and say "How do you do?'"
Mervyn was up in a moment, with beaming face and
outstretched hand. Nina advanced coldly, and shook
hands without speaking. But Cecily hung back, shy and
frightened. Her mother's sudden entrance had alarmed
her, and she became conscious directly of rough hair and
inky fingers.
The difference between her children's manners and
those of her nephew struck Mrs. Middleton forcibly, and
she looked much annoyed. -
"Come forward, Cecily. What are you hiding for,
and why do you put your hand behind you?"
Cecily blushed all over, and stammered out something
unintelligible.
"Why can't you say "Good-morning' like a lady, and
not like a little charity-girl. Look at Mervyn; he shakes
hands properly."
"My hand is inky," she said, timidly.
"Young ladies' hands should never be inky. What
have you been doing to make them in such a state?"
"I've been copying out my collect," said Cecily,
hanging her head.
"And I've been writing to mother," laughed Mervyn,
holding out his hands. "Mine are worse than Cecily's."

The old lady turned to him directly. "What a hand-
some boy' she said, sotto voce; then added, out loud,
"Ah you've been writing to your mother, have you?
Give her my love, and tell her I think you are very like
her.''
"Do you know her?" said Mervyn, eagerly.
The old lady replied in the affirmative, and he at once
plunged into conversation with her.
Her attention was thus completely distracted from Mrs.
Middleton's children, although she had been brought to
the school-room on purpose to see Nina, whose photo-
graph she had admired in the book last night.
Mrs. Middleton was very much annoyed at Nina's pale
and languid appearance, which quite spoiled her good looks,
and provoked with both daughters for appearing to such
disadvantage. She felt that they had been a failure, and
that Mervyn had carried all before him. Still, she did
not feel angry with him. He looked so handsome, so
bright, and so pleasant, that she could not wonder the old
lady should have been most taken with him. She left the
room in a very bad temper, and went to put on her things
for church.
As soon as Nina was ready for church, she joined Mer-
vyn, and they both stood at the school-room window,
watching the party stream across the lawn.
"How smart they all are " he said. "Look at the
gowns and the parasols; every color under the sun. There
goes Uncle Rowley, with a white waistcoat and a flower
in his button-hole. Where's Aunt Lydia? Oh, there
she comes | She s lost something. Look what a hunt
she's having."
Mrs. Middleton heard voices, and looked up.
"What have you lost, Aunt Lydia?" shouted Mer-
vyn.

"My prayer-book," she answered ; "see if you can
find me one."
"Do you know the 'Te Deum' by heart?" he called
Out.
"Yes. Why?"
"Because I could lend you my second-best prayer-book
if you did. It's all there but the 'Te Deum,' and that's
torn out. Shall I throw it to you? Look out! Catch 1"
"No no! certainly not l" exclaimed Mrs. Middleton,
gesticulating violently; "bring it down."
She was too late. Mervyn had hurled the book at her,
and it came fluttering down through the air with so true
an aim that it hit her parasol and knocked it out of her
hand.
"Butter-fingers I" escaped involuntarily from Mervyn's
lips, but fortunately the word did not reach his aunt's
ears. "You needn't mind," he called out, as he observed
the look of horror with which she picked it up; "it's only
my second-best l"
Madame was now heard calling, and Mervyn and Nina
followed her down-stairs. They did not go the same way
as the drawing-room party, who avoided stiles and gates,
so they arrived in church first, and established themselves
before the others came.
Mervyn sat between Nina and Cecily, and all three
were told by Madame to take up as little room as possible.
She herself contrived to squeeze into a little, corner up
against a pillar, as flat as a pancake.
Cecily proceeded to announce everybody in a loud
whisper as they arrived.
"There's Mr. Mellish the miller, and his wife. Here
comes the butcher and his wife. They haven't brought
their little boy to-day. Perhaps he's got a cold. Oh,
look at the turnpike woman She's got a new bonnet !

She hasn't had one for a year. Here's poor old Langley;
see how bent double he is . One could quite sit on his
back. Look at his dear old smock-frock. Oh, Mervyn,
isn't it fun being early and seeing all the people arrive?
Here's Jones the gardener and his two daughters. How
stiff his neckcloth is lhe can hardly turn his head. You
see, he only wears it on Sunday. Oh, I say ! the cheese-
monger and all his family are gone into deep mourning
since last Sunday. What can have happened? Oh, dear
me, here's mamma " And Cecily instantly became
a model of propriety, as the party, led by Mrs. Middleton,
filed into church.
There was a great rustling and arranging, for it cer-
tainly was a large party, and quite as many as the pew
could hold. Nina's eyes were often on her father and
mother that day during the service. They were exactly
opposite her, for it was a square pew. Mrs. Middleton
was clearly in a very bad temper, and took no part in the
service at all, and Colonel Middleton was half the time
talking and laughing with the young man next him. Mer-
vyn, disturbed by the whispering, looked up once or twice,
and, his eye traveling on to Nina, he was astonished at
the expression of her face, and wondered what she could
be thinking of to make her look so. Once, during the
reading of the Commandments, Mrs. Middleton spoke
angrily to her husband. There was something wrong
with the seat, and she seemed to hold him responsible.
He answered, laughing, which seemed to make her more
angry than ever. In the middle of their discussion, Nina
raised her eyes. Just at that moment sounded in meas-
ured tones from the chancel, "Honor thy father and thy
mother." Clear rose the treble notes of Mervyn's voice,
and his eyes showed where his thoughts had flown. Deep
in her hands Nina buried her face, and from the tightly-
K+

closed little mouth came no sound at all. The clergy-
man gave for his text, "In thy presence is the fullness
of joy." Mervyn exchanged a glance with Nina, which
she acknowledged with her eyes. The sermon, as it went
on, affected her strangely. It was very homely, very
plain; but it recalled Mervyn's words by the moonlit
water, and seemed to make clearer what he had tried to
explain. When the clergyman spoke of happy homes,
warmed by family affection, she was all at sea: such hap-
piness found no parallel in her loveless home. But when
he went on to particular affections, she could think of her
little brother, and, placing herself in fancy by his bed, the
meaning dawned more clear. Thus does God choose the
weak things of the world to work his sovereign purposes.
For when the sermon ended, she had told herself that
if she only loved God as she loved Totty, she would be
able to say, with the Psalmist, "In thy presence is the
fullness of joy."
With these thoughts swelling in her heart, she followed
the party out of church.
"Well, that was a poor performance," said one of the
gentlemen.
"Terribly long," whined the old lady. "I nearly
went to sleep."
The others chimed in, in the same strain, and then
walked on, still talking the sermon over, and heedless of
the presence of the children. Their words and their voices
jarred, as they fell, upon the sensitive feelings of the child.
The thoughts suggested by the sermon fled away, her fair
dream vanished, and she felt as if she had been foolish to be
so impressed by what had affected grown-up people so little.
Half ashamed of her own feelings, and yet shrinking
from hearing the discourse pulled to pieces, she retreated
to Madame's side, and walked on in silence.

Cecily was hand-in-hand with her father some way on,
and Mervyn was running after them. Presently he fell
back, and came to join Nina.
"Nina, why do you stay behind P"
"I don't know."
"What is the matter, Nina?"
"I don't know."
"Come and talk," he said, pulling her away from Ma-
dame. Nina did not resist him.
"The clergyman said just the same as mother, didn't
he?" he said, triumphantly. "I was thinking of her all
the time. Who were you thinking of, Nina?"
"Totty," she answered, roused and comforted by his
sympathetic appreciation. "I liked the sermon, Mervyn;
didn't you?"
And she looked rather anxiously at him.
"Oh, yes," he said, warmly; "I listened to every
Word."
Just then Colonel Middleton was heard shouting to
Mervyn, and the boy ran away. But, though regretting
that their conversation should be so abruptly broken off,
Nina did not relapse into the sad state in which he had
found her. His few words, and the sight of his bright
face, had made her quite happy again, and she was in-
dependent now of the criticisms of her father's friends.
She entered quietly into conversation with Madame, and
troubled herself no more.
"Lydia," said Colonel Middleton, as he watched
Mervyn coming, "it strikes me we don't see enough
of this boy. He must be very dull here, cooped up in
a school-room with little girls. At any rate, his even-
ings must be slow work. Why not have him down to
dessert?"
Mrs. Middleton answered that as their own children

never came to dessert, it had not occurred to her, but
that she was quite willing he should come. "Only," she
added, "I won't have the girls. It is quite against my
principles."
"The girls are another affair," he answered. "Mervyn
is only here for a time, and I don't see why he is to be
kept so tight."
That evening a pompous message was sent up to the
school-room to the effect that Mr. Lyndsay was to pre-
sent himself for the future in the dining-room at a quarter
before nine, which message was received with acclama-
tions by the said Mr. Lyndsay.
"But I don't like leaving you alone, Nina dear," he
said, as they sat together in the school-room, waiting for
the hour to come; "shan't you be very dull and lonely?"
Nina had certainly felt a little dismayed at the prospect,
she had learned to prize his society so much, and to look
forward to their long evenings together; but she was
glad he should have some change. So she did not let her
own disappointment appear.
"I shall go to bed soon," she answered.
"Yes; and I'll come and tell you all about it on my
way to bed," he said, eagerly.
It was an unfortunate evening for Nina to be left alone;
for she was still haunted by the words she had overheard
the night before, and her mind was full of fears about her
little brother. He had caught a fresh cold a day or two
before, and two nights running she had found him awake
and coughing.
When Mervyn was gone down-stairs, she went to the
bedroom nursery, and found him awake again. No sing-
ing by his side had any effect; and at last she took him
out of bed, wrapped him in a shawl, and walked him up
and down the room. After a time he dozed off, and she

A M/DAV/G//Z" SCAEAVE. 229
was putting him gently into bed again, when the head-
nurse came in. She was very much offended at the whole
transaction, and gave vent to her annoyance in a volley
of words. But Nina did not heed her. Totty was asleep.
That was all she cared for, and she returned to her bed-
room comparatively satisfied about him. She was drop-
ping off to sleep herself, when Mervyn rushed in, full of
what had been said and done down-stairs, and his hands
full of candied orange-peel and other delicacies which he
had saved for her from his own dessert, and which he
crammed into her mouth in the darkness with great vigor.
C H A P T E R XVII.
A MIDNIGHT SCENE.
CoLONEL and Mrs. Middleton attended a county ball
the next evening, and as they drove home from it Mrs.
Middleton mused with great satisfaction on the events of
the evening. She had, altogether, been very successful.
Her party had enjoyed themselves; she had provided
some of the prettiest girls in the room; and she herself
had been asked to dance nearly all the quadrilles and
lancers. This last was a great satisfaction to her, because
she was always a little shaky about her age, always a little
afraid that she was considered a middle-aged woman. Her
husband looked, and was, so much younger than she, that
she was constantly in dread of being taken for his mother.
They reached home at about half-past one o'clock; and,
after wishing her guests good-night, Mrs. Middleton went
slowly up the stairs, candle in hand, humming a waltz,
2O
## p. 230 (#236) ############################################
23o 7A/A'O WAV 7'OGAE 7//EA'.
and laughingly remarking to her husband that her feet
quite ached with dancing.
As she passed a great mirror on the stairs, she involun-
tarily stopped to look at the reflection of herself in it,
with the light of the lamp shining on her. The glass gave
back the picture of a prosperous woman, a woman satisfied
with herself, and on good terms with the world in general.
"I am sure I improve in looks as I get older," she in-
wardly reflected. "I hope it will go on till Nina comes
out."
She was moving slowly on, when a sound from up-stairs
caused her involuntarily to stop and listen.
It was a low, wailing cry from the direction of the
nursery; and coming on the top of such different reflec-
tions, it struck her with a kind of chill.
"It is Totty," she said, half out loud. "What can
make him cry at this hour?" Then she remembered how
Wilson the head-nurse was away for a night, and how
that probably he was affected by her absence. She lis-
tened again, and the cry was repeated.
"Too bad of Wilson," muttered Mrs. Middleton;
"she accustoms him to this walking and singing, and
now he can't sleep without it."
She walked on ; but the wailing increased, and she
stopped again to listen.
"Perhaps he is not well. I think I will go up and see
what is the matter; but I must get off my gown first."
She went into her dressing-room, and rang for her
maid ; but the sound of crying pursued her even there,
and she began to get uneasy.
"Go up to the nursery, and see what is the matter
with Master Thomas," she said, hastily, as soon as her
maid appeared.
She walked up and down rather restlessly meanwhile.

A MIDAVIGHT SCEAVE. 23 I
"So tiresome, if he is going to be ill while Wilson is
away."
Mrs. Middleton had no experience of illness; all her
children had been strong; and Totty, the only exception,
she had always given over entirely to Wilson in matters
of health. She thought she saw difficulties presenting
themselves, and it made her rather nervous. She con-
tinued to pace up and down till her maid reappeared.
"Well?" she said, sharply.
"Master Thomas seems very unwell, ma'am," said the
maid. "The nursery-maid says he has not slept more than
an hour all night, and she can do nothing with him. He
seems very feverish, and coughs a good deal."
"Wait here till I come back," said Mrs. Middleton ;
and she went straight up-stairs as she was, satin gown,
wreath, diamonds, and all. She stopped for a minute at
the door of the bedroom nursery and looked in.
Totty, evidently very feverish, was tossing about rest-
lessly, crying and coughing. The nursery-maid was sitting
on his bed, vainly trying to quiet him and get him to
sleep.
"Sing Dinah," he kept on saying, piteously.
Mrs. Middleton was frightened. The child looked so
frail and ill, and she was so unaccustomed to the sight of
sick children. Totty, though delicate, had seldom been
seriously ill; and she felt so helpless in the absence of the
nurse, and saw that the nursery-maid was helpless too.
It was such a sudden change from the gay scene she had
left, so quick a transition from the thoughts on which
her mind had been so lately dwelling. In her fear she
jumped to conclusions directly. It was a new sensation
for her. She had never lost a child, or conceived the
possibility of such a thing ; and, as the idea rushed upon
her, a feeling of rare tenderness rose in her breast, and

she told herself that Totty, of all her children, was the
one she could least spare. "He is the only one of
the lot who ever comes to be kissed, or who shows me
any affection," said an unwonted voice in her heart.
The sense of personal responsibility, too, weighed her
down, and she advanced very nervously into the room.
Still, it was with her usual imperious manner that she
motioned away the nursery maid, and took her place on
the be 1.
But she had forgotten how startling her appearance
would be to the child,a figure decked in satin and
flowers coming into his room in the darkness, and was
not prepared for his convulsive start, and the expression
of terror in his eyes.
"Go away ! go away !" he exclaimed, shrinking from
her. "I don't want you. Smart lady, go away."
With the unwonted tenderness swelling in her heart,
the child's words fell blankly on the mother's ear. Not.
a muscle of her face moved ; for all the world, she would
not have shown how much they hurt her ; but they hurt her
none the less sharply for that.
She was obliged to get up and move out of the way,
while the dismayed nursery-maid exclaimed, "Master
Totty, dear, it's your mamma I Don't you know your
mamma P''
Totty stared hard, and Mrs. Middleton again advanced
to the bed; but the moment the night-light shone upon
her, he clung to Jane, as terrified as ever.
"No no l'' he cried; "send her away; she shines so.
She's on fire. Take the fire away. I'm so hot."
Mrs. Middleton and Jane both thought he must be
raving, till the latter perceived that the light just caught
the necklace and pendant on Mrs. Middleton's neck,
making them glow and sparkle.
## p. 233 (#239) ############################################
A MIDAV/GAT SCEAVE. 233
"I think it's the diamonds, ma'am," she said, timidly;
for all the servants were afraid of Mrs. Middleton.
"Then undo the thing and take it off," said her mis-
tress, harshly ; "and be quick '''
She came near and held her head, so that Jane should
unfasten the clasp. In so doing, the light played upon
her tiara, and Totty burst out again, -
"Her hair the fire | Look l''
With no gentle hand Mrs. Middleton tore the tiara
from her head and thrust it, with the necklace and brace-
lets, into Jane's hand. *
"Take them, and throw them under the bed '' she ex-
claimed. Her voice sounded dry and hard, and the hand
which held out the diamonds trembled a little ; but her
face was immovable.
"Totty, don't you know mamma now?" she said,
bending over the child.
The lustrous blue eyes met hers for a moment, and their
glance was one of recognition ; but there was no sign of
pleasure, no sign hardly of interest, and he relapsed into
his wailing cry, "Sing Dinah, mamma."
"What does he mean, Jane?"
"It's some song, ma'am, that Mrs. Wilson sings him
to sleep with, and he's been asking for it all night. The
tune's gone out of my head, or else I believe I should
have got him to sleep long ago."
"Mamma will sing you to sleep to-night, Totty,"
whispered Mrs. Middleton. "What shall she sing P"
"Sing Dinah, mamma," he repeated.
Mrs. Middleton had dance-music ringing in her head,
and began humming a slow, soothing valse.
But Totty burst out crying. "Not that not that
Sing Dinah."
Poor Mrs. Middleton tried another tune; but each one

was received by the same plaintive entreaty: "Oh, please,
not that I Sing Dinah."
"But, my dear little boy' she exclaimed, quite in
despair, "I don't know Dinah. I can't sing it."
All the mother was awake in her now, and she felt she
would give anything in the world to be able to find out
what the poor little fellow wanted, and to be the one to
soothe him to sleep.
He was getting very excited, and the chances of sleep
seemed slighter every moment. Crying, too, made him
cough more violently; and altogether she was getting
quite alarmed about him.
Anxiety had the effect of making her angry, and she
turned sharply round upon Jane.
"How is it you can't remember this tune?"
"I'm very sorry, ma'am," answered Jane, "but it's
clean gone out of my head. He'd go to sleep in a minute
if we could find it, and he'd wake quite well, for it's sleep
he wants more than anything."
"But what is to be done if we can't get him to sleep?"
exclaimed Mrs. Middleton. "Good gracious ! is there no
one in the house who has heard the child sung to skeep,
night after night as it goes on ? Does no one ever come
near the nursery, or take the slightest interest in x -
What could have made Mrs. Middleton stop short in her
sentence, and have caused that curious expression to pass
over her face? Her theories and her practice were per-
fect; she never could conceive herself to blame in any
way; she never by any chance owned herself in the wrong;
everything that she did must be right, simply because she
did it. What, then, could have made her cheek flush a
little as she put the question ? And why did she stop short
in her lecture to the nursery-maid P And why at that
moment, of all moments, when her thoughts were so pre-

occupied, should a foolish old proverb come dinning in
her head, which she had not heard or thought of for years?
"They that live in glass houses should not throw stones."
"What is to be done?" she hastily finished.
The nursery-maid was about to answer, when a slight
sound at the door made her look round ; and she was so
startled at what she saw there, that an exclamation burst
from her lips, which Mrs. Middleton was too preoccupied
to notice.
There, standing in the doorway, was Nina. She was in
her little white night-gown, and her feet were bare. Her
dark hair hung down over her shoulders, and she carried
a little lamp in her hand. The light, shining on her
features, revealed her handsome little face, wearing its
most resolute expression. Steadily she advanced into the
room, and her mother, bending over Totty, with her back
to the door, did not perceive her entrance. Nearer and
nearer she came, her eyes bright with excitement, and yet
having in them a far-away expression, as if they reached
on to her goal, Totty's bedside, and saw nothing either to
the right hand or the left on the way. Still, Mrs. Middle-
ton did not look round. Totty began tossing about more
restlessly than ever, perpetually moaning, "I so sleepy,
so sleepy. Sing Dinah, mamma."
"My poor little boy," exclaimed Mrs. Middleton, "I
wish I could. But I don't know the song, dear; I never
heard it." -
"I can sing it," said a clear young voice close by ; and
Mrs. Middleton, turning sharply round, came face to face
with her little daughter. Astonishment took from her the
power of utterance. She gazed at the little white-robed
figure as if it had been an apparition ; though, even in the
startled hurry of the moment, she had time to admire the
handsome little face with the lamp-light on it, the dark
## p. 236 (#242) ############################################
236 7A/A'O WAV 7'OGAE 7//ER.
eyes shining like two stars, and the firm mouth. Nina met
her mother's glance fully, and did not shrink the least. In
fact, she was the more unconcerned of the two, for Mrs.
Middleton did shrink a little from the glance of defiance
shot at her from those sparkling eyes. She was in an un-
usually tender frame of mind; unnerved and anxious ;
more in need of loving sympathy than she had ever been
in her life; and perhaps it struck her, as she met that
glance, how utterly void of childlike affection were those
dark eyes. Perhaps, too, already hurt by Totty's indiffer-
ence, she was wounded to find the same feeling intensified
in the heart of another of her children. But for the
moment all these feelings were drowned in relief, when
Totty held out his arms to his sister and said, "Carry
me, Nina; put me to sleep;" and Nina answered, "Yes,
darling, I will."
Mrs. Middleton watched her as in a dream. She saw
Nina put down the lamp, and, bending over Totty, push
back the hair from his face and arrange his night-gown
about his feet. She saw, with astonishment, the eyes that
had shot defiance at her, assume the glow of tender affec-
tion; she saw the love and the pity breaking out from
all parts of the face, till the child seemed transformed,
and she was too bewildered to speak.
"Sing Dinah, Nina; sing Dinah "
"I will, darling, I will."
Did that soft whisper come from Nina, from that cold,
imperious child? How tenderly she lifts him in her arms,
and how confidingly he puts his head on her shoulder and
his arms round her neck! Fearing that he may be cold,
she wraps a worsted shawl round him, carefully enveloping
his little bare feet. The oft-repeated entreaty meets with
a response now, and softly the quaint ditty sounds through
the room, and the plaintive wail of the child ceases:

Something have they of relief, something of humiliation,

earnestly desired, nor why her heart was so sore at not

first of all, and to be put before everybody. Here she

was nobody. It was a sore humiliation; her feelings and
her pride were alike hurt by it.
"Why do I not gain my children's affection ?" she
asked herself, bitterly, as she watched the two pacing up
and down, both seeming so far from her, so near to each
other.
In spite of herself, she was fascinated watching them;
in spite of herself, she admired and gazed at them. In
spite of herself, Nina's watchful face, bending over the
sleeping boy, attracted her and filled her with a new feel-
ing. She could not help looking at her with a certain
kind of respect; she felt that there was that in the child
of which she had had no idea; realized that there were
two sides to Nina's character, and was puzzled. The one
Nina was well known to her, but this Nina was a stranger;
this one lived a life of which she, her mother, knew
nothing, and with which she had nothing to do. And,
with a sharp pang at her heart, came into her mind the
passage, "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter."
Ever since the arrival of Mervyn, with his engaging
ways and pretty little attentions, she had had a dissatis-
fied feeling about her own children, and wondered
wherein the difference lay. Mow she began to think
that in Nina, perhaps, the same feelings lay dormant, -
and that it was she who failed in drawing them out. For
the first time she began to doubt herself, and to question
a little whether the fault did not lie with her. The look
which Nina had shot at her had hurt her, frightened her;
there was something so like hatred in the glance. It
came just at the moment, too, when she was feeling so
unusually tender ; otherwise she would not have noticed
it. Generally, she ascribed such expressions in Nina's
face to the child's nature; she was cold, proud, unac-
countable. But how could she think this now P How
## p. 239 (#245) ############################################
A M/DAV/G//7" SCEAVE. 239
could she mistake the tenderness which pervaded every
line of the face which was bending over the sleeping boy?
Nina, all this time, was quite unconscious of her
mother's presence. She was entirely wrapped in her little
brother, and had forgotten everything in her anxiety for
him. Up and down she paced, up and down, still softly
singing the monotonous tune; watching with trembling
anxiety the little face on her shoulder, lest the child should
awake again.
Satisfied at last that he was sleeping soundly, she signed
to the nursery-maid to rearrange his bed, and then gently
laid him down. But to the last she continued singing,
lest the change of position should rouse him.
Her labor of love completed, she sank down on a chair,
exhausted, arms and knees alike trembling under the boy's
weight.
Mrs. Middleton's impulse was to take her in her arms
and thank her, so great was the relief of seeing Totty
sleeping at last. But a kind of shyness born of pride
prevented her. She told herself not to act on impulse,
but to consider first what she meant to say.
She rose, and bent over the little bed, to gain a few
moments for reflection. When she turned round, Nina
was gone.
Mrs. Middleton hurried after her; but when she got to
the door the child had disappeared. The mother strained
her eyes through the darkness, to see if she could catch a
glimpse of the little white figure threading its way along
the passages; but she saw no sign of it.
With a sense of disappointment for which she could
not account, she turned towards her own apartments.
The clock struck three as she entered her dressing-room;
the candles had burnt down in their sockets, and her
maid had fallen asleep by the fire.

WAR TO THE KNIFE.
MRs. MIDDLETON woke the next morning to hear that
Totty had passed a good night, and was pretty well.
Things often look very different by daylight; and she
told herself she had been unnecessarily alarmed. With
the night, too, her other phases of feeling passed away,
and she accused herself of weakness with regard to both
children.
Nina's conduct, certainly, still filled her with surprise,
but it ceased to inspire her with any deeper emotion.
She mused upon it for a long time, but could not under-
stand it the least. That it was her habit to be a great
deal with Totty was evident, and that she exercised a very
strong influence over him was also very clear.
"I never saw her notice the younger ones," she re-
flected.
In vain did Mrs. Middleton try to get to the bottom of
it. She went up to the nursery as soon as she was dressed.
She heard Nina and Cecily going down to their school-
room breakfast, and was provoked with herself to find
that she was glad she had not passed them on the stairs.
She could not conceal from herself that she shrank from
meeting Nina after what had occurred.
She found Totty pale and languid, with a good deal of
cough, but otherwise much as he had been for some time
past. - -
In the course of the day, Wilson, the head-nurse, re-
turned, and Mrs. Middleton had a long talk with her, in
her dressing-room, about the boy. She harped on the old

WAR TO THE ATAVIEE. 24I
subject of singing him to sleep, proving that it was to that
habit that all the mischief of last night was attributable.
"I always said so, Wilson, and now you see how right
I am. The consequence is, that you can't go away for a
night without the child making himself ill for want of
sleep."
She then proceeded to relate how Nina had appeared,
and how at last Totty had been got to sleep. She was too
proud to ask Wilson any questions; but rather hoped the
nurse might, in her answer, throw some light upon the
subject.
Wilson, in defending herself, somehow contrived to
throw the blame upon Nina, implying that, of course, if
the child expected his sister after he had been put to bed,
he lay awake waiting for her.
"What do you mean?" asked Mrs. Middleton.
Wilson answered, that for some weeks past she had been
trying to break Totty of the habit, as he seemed a little
stronger, and had more than once put him to bed awake;
but that one evening, on returning at supper-time to see
how he was getting on, she had found Miss Nina singing
him to sleep.
The conversation lasted some time, and when it was
over Wilson was dispatched to the school-room to tell
Miss Middleton she was to come at once to her mother's
dressing-room.
When the nurse was gone, Mrs. Middleton went to the
open window and leaned out. She was musing on the
events of the night, and on what had passed between her
and Wilson. She was also trying to settle in her own
mind what she meant to say to Nina when she appeared.
She was determined to be very firm, and to insist upon
obedience. The arm of the law was on her side, and she
was going to take full advantage of it. And yet, for once
L 2 I

in her life, she felt a little nervous at the prospect. She had
an intuitive instinct that a struggle was impending, and
hardly knew how to nerve herself to meet it. The child
had come out in such a new light that she felt a little afraid
of her; involuntarily she respected her; she could not but
feel that Nina had been victorious last night, and who
could tell that she would not be the victor again?
Leaning out of the window, she debated the question in
her mind, and could find no satisfactory answer. So,
once before, did we see Magdalen Lyndsay stand; feeling,
just like Mrs. Middleton, that a struggle was impending,
and, like her, trying to nerve herself to meet it. But how
differently I Love, gentleness, and patience were the
weapons with which she armed herself, and she came to
the conflict with prayer. Mrs. Middleton was coming
destitute of all these, and unconscious how defenseless she
was without them. Her weapons were a strong will, un-
compromising determination, and the power of authority.
We shall see how she fared with them.
Three months ago that day, mother and son faced the
struggle of their lives; mother and daughter have theirs
before them now.
"Do you want me, mamma P"
Mrs. Middleton started as the clear young voice
sounded in the room, and involuntarily shrank back a
little. It brought back so clearly the scene of last night,
and the way in which the same measured tones had fallen
on her ear, "I can sing it." She recalled so vividly her
feelings when she turned around and confronted the little
white-robed figure with its streaming hair, and the sense
almost of fear with which she had met the glance of those
sparkling eyes. She felt as if she could not encounter
them again, lest she should read in them the dislike which
had dismayed her before.

JWAA' TO 7 HE RAWIFE. 243.
And then the cold ring in the voice, the indifferent,
independent tone. Just so had it rung on her ear at mid-
night; hurting and galling her as it fell. It hurt and
galled her now. And, as if to bring out the cold indiffer-
ence in sharper contrast, how it had changed to thrilling
tones of love directly after, in answer to Totty's appeal l
"I will, darling, I will."
She felt almost as jealous of the girl's love for her
brother as she had felt for the boy's love for Nina. Both
so independent of her. She was stung, injured, and in-
dignant, all in one. She felt more unwilling every instant
to confront the child again. With the little figure photo-
graphed in her mind, she dreaded to turn around and see
it standing there.
But sooner or later it must be done; and she wheeled
round suddenly, and saw Nina standing in the doorway.
But the aspect of the girl in her school-room pinafore
and plaited hair was so different from that of the image she
had conjured up, that Mrs. Middleton took courage.
The sparkle in the eyes was gone, and they were heavy
with want of sleep and undue excitement. There was no
brilliancy in the face: it was very white, and the child
looked altogether ill and languid. Many mothers would
have taken alarm at the girl's appearance, but Mrs. Mid-
dleton's only feeling was personal relief.
The pale little school-room girl before her was a
different creature from the beautiful defying apparition of
last night; and she felt less nervous at the thought of the
task which lay before her.
"Come in, and shut the door," she said.
Nina obeyed, and came and stood in front of her
mother, who had meanwhile seated herself in an arm-
chair. And then there was a silence. Nina waited quietly
for her mother to begin; and Mrs. Middleton felt that

nothing was more impossible. There she sat, and there,
opposite her, stood the erect, motionless little figure.
The ticking of the clock, and the crackling of the fire,
were distinctly heard in the silence that reigned in the
room. Mrs. Middleton got quite provoked with herself
at last for not knowing how to begin, but feared being at
a disadvantage if she hurried into the discussion too
unguardedly.
"Totty is better," she said, at last.
Clearly Nina had not expected this beginning, for her eyes
softened a little, and a faint glow broke out on her cheek.
"Yes," she answered.
"Did you know it before, Nina P"
"Yes, mamma."
"How P"
Nina hesitated.
"Speak out !" said Mrs. Middleton, sharply.
Nina's face instantly assumed an expression of haughty
indifference.
"I saw him this morning," she answered.
"Indeed And pray how do you find time to pay
visits to the nursery between breakfast and your lessons?"
"It wasn't between breakfast and lessons."
"When was it, then P"
No answer.
"Ninal answer me directly."
"It was before breakfast."
"Why, I was up there myself at eight, and heard you
and Cecily going straight down from your room to the
school-room."
"It was before that."
"Tell me instantly when it was."
"I don't know the exact hour."
"Was it before your hair was done?"
## p. 245 (#251) ############################################
WAA' TO 7 HE ATM/FE. 245
"Yes."
"Was it before you were dressed ?"
"Yes."
"Was it directly you were called?"
" No."
"When was it, then? Speak out."
Very unwillingly the answer came. "It was before I
was called, directly I woke ; but I don't know what
o'clock it was."
A short silence after this. Mrs. Middleton, with that
sore jalous feeling increasing in her heart, saw that
Nina's anxiety had been greater than her own, and that
she had been beforehand with her in inquiring after the
boy's health. She was nettled, and lost her temper.
"And pray how long is it since you took this fancy to
Totty?" she said, in her most disagreeable manner. "I
thought you were too grand to play with the younger
ones." -
Poor Nina | This sudden attack was too much for her.
Her eyes filled with tears, and she twisted her hands
nervously together. There was a terrible struggle between
her feelings and her pride. She would have given worlds
to have said she didn't care for Totty much, while at the
same time the very thought of him made her heart beat
wildly.
Mrs. Middleton felt more irritated than she had been
yet. No word of hers produced any effect upon Nina,
while the very mention of her little brother produced this
wonderful change. Again she seemed to see the face she
had watched last night hurl defiance at her, and then melt
and glow as it bent over Totty. Again she felt the out-
sider, the looker-on. Again she felt how near the two
were together, and how completely independent of her.
A few minutes ago she had felt jealous of Nina for hav-

ing been beforehand with her that morning in showing
anxiety and love for Totty. Mow she felt jealous of
Totty for being able to inspire all gentle emotions where
she failed to extract anything but coldness and indiffer-
ence. She bit her lip fiercely, lest her face should betray
some of the emotion she felt.
"How long," she resumed, presently, "have you been
in the habit of going to the nursery after Totty is in
bed P"
Nina winced a little, and then answered, "I can't re-
member." -
"That is nonsense, Nina."
"I really can't, mamma."
"Then think."
The ticking of the clock and the crackling of the fire
again made themselves heard; and Mrs. Middleton won-
dered if the girl meant to answer, and what course was
to be pursued if she did not.
But Nina raised her head presently, and said,
"It may be two years, or more. I have done it for so
long that I can't remember."
Mrs. Middleton was quite overwhelmed with astonish-
ment. "Why, Wilson spoke of it as of quite a new
thing the last few days."
"Wilson didn't know."
"Did no one ever know?"
"No, no one except"
"Except who P"
"Except Mervyn. He found it out."
The calm, cold little voice softened just a little as it pro-
nounced Mervyn's name; and the mother, with that sore
jealous feeling lying in her breast, noticed it directly.
Here, then, was another who could awaken in her child
feelings she herself was powerless to inspire.
## p. 247 (#253) ############################################
W.A.A. 7"O ZALE AAV/AAE. 2.47
"Why did you not tell me?" she burst out.
"Why should I?" answered Nina.
The cold answer stung Mrs. Middleton to the quick. It
showed again the perfect independence, the complete in-
difference. It was as much as to say, "Why should I
tell you of my hopes, my fears, my sorrows? What are
they to you ?"
And surging once more in her brain was the old verse
which had come into her mind with such a sharp pang
last night, "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this
matter."
"You knew very well I sheuld forbid it," she said,
coldly, after a few minutes' pause: "I suppose that was
why."
No answer.
"At any rate, now that I know it, I do forbid it. You
must never do it again, Nina."
The hot blood came rushing all over Nina's face and
neck, and she pressed her hands tightly together. She lost
all control over herself for a moment.
"Never do it again l'" she exclaimed, breathlessly,
"never go and see Totty at night again Oh, mamma,
mamma, you can't mean it !"
"But I do mean it," answered Mrs. Middleton.
"And why?" burst out Nina.
Mrs. Middleton, taken by surprise, was about to say it was
for Totty's own good, and to repeat what Wilson had said
about the child lying awake, expecting his sister; but
Nina's flashing eyes and imperious manner put her back
up, and she asked herself why she should condescend to
explain her reasons. Her innate selfishness resumed its
sway; and, forgetting the child's side of the question,
she only thought of her own, and grew indignant at the
idea of her authority being questioned. -

248 THA'O WW TOGETHER.
"That is no business of yours," she answered, in a hard,
dry voice. "Those are my orders, and all you have got
to do is to obey them."
All the passionate feeling faded out of Nina's eyes as
she listened. The flush died away from her cheek; she
drew herself up a little, and her face became almost rigid.
She had evidently taken a resolution of some kind, and
by it meant to abide. Mrs. Middleton waited for an an-
swer, but none came.
"Nina " she exclaimed, angrily.
"Yes, mamma."
"Do you hear what I say?"
"Yes, mamma."
"Are you going to obey me?"
Very quietly the child raised her dark eyes, looked her
mother full in the face, and answered, in a low, clear voice,
"I cannot obey you, mamma."
Mrs. Middleton could hardly believe her ears. She was
dumfounded, and did not know how to proceed. Her
temper got the better of her.
"How dare you speak to me like that?" she exclaimed;
"what do you mean by saying such a thing to your
mother?a wretched little girl like you !"
An angry retort rose to Nina's lips, when she heard a
sound in the garden below, and she checked herself and
listened. It was Mervyn's voice, calling to her in tones
of great joy and excitement:
"Nina | Ninal where are you? I have got a letter
from mother, and I want to read it to you. Oh, Nina l it
is such a dear letter!"
And a sound followed as if the boy were rapturously
kissing the paper. Mother and daughter, confronting
each other with flashing eyes and stormy faces, both
heard the words and the eager embraces; both recognized
## p. 249 (#255) ############################################
JVA R 7'O 7 PFA2 ATAV/FE. 249
the glad love in the tones; and both instinctively averted
their glance one from the other.
Mrs. Middleton turned sharply away to the window,
and pretended to be looking out, and Nina hastily dashed
away a tear that she felt rising to her eyes.
"You are the coldest, most unnatural child in the
world," said Mrs. Middleton, much agitated. "I wish
Mervyn was my child instead of you."
The moment she had said the words she would have
given worlds to recall them. She was determined to
crush the spirit of rebellion and disobedience in her
daughter by the force of authority, and feared she had
lost ground by her momentary weakness. She changed
her tone directly.
"Either you will obey me, Nina," she said, in her
hardest manner, " or you will take the consequence. So
choose for yourself. Do not for an instant suppose I am
not going to have my way."
There is no saying what answer Nina would have made
a few moments before ; but the very sound of Mervyn's
voice had wakened up all her better feelings, and her frame
of mind had changed. She was touched, too, by her
mother's unusual display of feeling.
"Mamma," she said, earnestly, "I do not want to
disobey you; indeed, I do not. But I cannot promise
not to go and see Totty, because I know I should break
my word. Please do not ask me."
Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke. But, alas! as
we have said, Mrs. Middleton's frame of mind had
changed too, and she was angry with herself for having
shown weakness, and with the child for having noticed it.
She thought, too, that Nina's emotion rose from the
sense of being defeated, and she eagerly seized upon the
temporary advantage it gave her. She turned round, and

spoke sharply, harshly,showed plainly that she looked
upon their relative positions as those of taskmaster and
slave, and laid down her commands accordingly. It was
the first time she had been thwarted so resolutely in her
life, and she was determined it should be the last.
Nina's spirit was roused too. She answered angrily
and disrespectfully. The outward covering of good be-
havior was thrown off, and Mrs. Middleton realized that
she had really no power or influence over the girl what-
ever.
In that galling moment she learned what an obedience
is worth which is not founded on religion, love, or venera-
tion. It was, as has been predicted, war to the knife
between mother and daughter. Mrs. Middleton felt she
had failed, and was at her wit's end. Stung with mortifi-
cation, in addition to all other feelings, she completely
lost all control over herself. "Once for all, and for the
last time," she cried, "will you obey me, or will you
not?"
"I cannot promise," the girl answered, firmly.
"Then go out of my sight this instant " And Nina
turned and went.

NINA.
ON the night of the county ball, Nina had been awak-
ened by the wheels of the carriage that brought her father
and mother home. All the day preceding she had been
unable to divest herself of the idea that Totty was worse;
not, as she told herself, on account of what she had over-

AWAAVA. 251
heard in the wood, but because he really seemed to her to
cough more, and to be weaker and more languid than
usual.
Her room was hot, and she got up and opened her door.
It was then that she heard Totty crying and coughing; and,
after listening for a few minutes, she made up her mind to
go and see what was the matter; for she remembered that
Wilson was away, and that Totty was not much accustomed
to the nursery-maid. She was surprised and alarmed,
when she reached the nursery-door, to find it open, and
to hear voices and see lights in the room; but her aston-
ishment increased when, peeping in, she saw her mother
sitting by the bed. Puzzled and frightened, she with-
drew for a minute, but soon returned to try and discover
what was going on.
She took in the state of affairs in a little while, and she
saw how necessary, for Totty's sake, her presence and
assistance were ; but she could not at first make up her
mind to go in. Concern for him, however, overcame, as
we have seen, every other feeling.
As long as she was employed in soothing the boy, she
had not thought much about her mother; but the moment
he was asleep a sudden fit of nervous shyness had seized
her, and she had fled away, regaining her room with a
beating heart. She had jumped hastily into bed, and had
fallen asleep, dreaming that her mother was pursuing her.
Totty's languor and cough, when she visited him next
morning, had impressed her more than it had Mrs.
Middleton, and her anxiety quite prevented her attending
to her lessons. In the midst of a struggle between French
history and fresh fears, her mother's message had reached
her. She had presented herself before her with some
trepidation, the summons was so unusual. She puzzled
much over what could be wanted of her, but concluded
## p. 252 (#258) ############################################
252 THA'O WAV 7'OGAE 7"HER.
that she was to be lectured for her conduct of the night
before. -
Her mother's first words had softened her directly.
She had realized that Mrs. Middleton shared her anxiety
about Totty, and had felt more drawn towards her than she
had ever done before. But as the conversation went on,
other and less pure feelings had been aroused. Still,
through it all, breaking forth every now and then, between
the dark clouds of dissension, she had recognized the
gleams of her mother's newly-awakened love for Totty.
Then, too, she had been moved with surprise, mingled
with a kind of pity, when she saw how overcome Mrs.
Middleton was at the contrast between Mervyn's love for
his mother and her own indifference.
She had so keenly realized herself, since Mervyn's ar-
rival, the great want of love in their home, that she was half
sorry for her mother when she saw she was going to real-
ize it too. She would have been glad to obey her if she
could, but she was too honest to promise what she knew
she should not perform. -
Totty must be considered first; she could not desert
him. It was no use her promising not to see him. She
knew that at the first sound of his cry, or at the mere
thought of his lying awake, frightened at every sound,
she should no more be able to keep away from him
than she could prevent the wind blowing in her face.
Earnestly she had spoken words to this effect, as we
have seen ; hoping that her mother, who seemed really
touched by Totty's condition, would see it in the same
light as herself. But her appeal had failed, and then,
alas ! had come upon her the change wrought by her
mother's harshness and outbreak of temper.
Nina had broken out then altogether. Her mother's
words and manner had goaded her to madness, and she
## p. 253 (#259) ############################################
AV/AVA. 253
had given vent to words of whose import and violence
she was hardly aware, till her return, after her summary
dismissal, to the calm of the school-room.
Sitting at her desk and musing over all that had passed,
she was able to think of the conversation more calmly.
She would have been more sorry or more frightened at
its results if concern for Totty had not been occupying
her mind so entirely.
As the day wore on, she accused herself of not having
done all she might on his behalf. Why had she not
tried more to inspire her mother with her own fears 2
Why had she not told her of the conversation she had
overheard in the garden, and boldly asked her if it were
true? And why had she irritated her mother into laying
this command upon her? For in that light she regarded
her mother's prohibition, and as such she felt she must
try to obey it. She had not promised; no, a promise
was too binding. Her word once given, she would not
have been able to retract. But she was going to try and
act up to her mother's injunction, if possible, by doing
all in her power to keep away from Totty that night. So,
as soon as Mervyn was gone down to dessert, she went
straight to her bedroom, undressed, and got into bed.
But she had not lain down long before a sort of terror
came over her, a terror of the darkness, a terror of the
howling of the wind without, a terror of every little
sound within ; a nameless terror, a shapeless, causeless
fear. She had sometimes had it before, but never so
strong as this. She generally fought against it; but to-
night her nerves were unstrung by all she had been
through, and she could not cope with it as usual. It was
this, in her, that enabled her to feel so much for Totty
in his nervous fears and fancies. She never laughed, but
felt for him sincerely, when he sometimes told her a black

man had peeped at him from between the curtains, or that
a great big dog had come and sat down close to his bed.
So, because she was thus restless herself, she feared he
might be restless too. Because she was suffering from
imaginary terrors, she feared he might be suffering too.
How that roaring noise of the wind in the chimney
would frighten him 1 And his bed was so near it, too !
The restless desire to see and console him came upon
her with overmastering power, and nine o'clock found
her stealing along the passage, lamp in hand.
Totty was asleep; but he seemed to her to breathe
with such difficulty that she bent over him to listen, her
lips nearly touching his as she did so. When she raised
her head again, she became aware that she was not alone
in the room. In the dim light she saw a figure sitting by
one of the other beds; and in that figure she recognized
her mother
>k x >k >k  >k >k
Very few and stern were the words that fell from Mrs.
Middleton's lips. She did not speak at all till they got
into the passage; and then she told her daughter that she
had not believed it possible she would be guilty of so
flagrant an act of disobedience, but had stationed herself
in the nursery to see; that she should for the future
provide against the repetition of such a breach of her
commands; that sure and certain means should be
adopted to insure an observance of her orders; and that
in the mean time Nina was to consider herself in disgrace,
and not to attempt to speak to, or hold any communica-
tion with, her mother on any pretense whatsoever.
Mrs. Middleton then disappeared down the passage,
and Nina went into her own room.
It was a very wearied little being that sank down upon
the bed. Exhausted she was, physically and mentally.
## p. 255 (#261) ############################################
AVIAWA. 255
She had hardly heard what her mother was saying; the
words had fallen on her ear without her taking in how
much they contained. For she could think of nothing
but Totty. She was sure she was not mistaken about
him; certain that he was not so well. His breathing
seemed to her to come in jerks, and he looked, even in his
sleep, so very ill. She was sure he ought to be shown to a
doctor. To Nina, a doctor was an infallible power that
stood between sickness and danger. In her present state
of nerves and feeling, the idea took hold of her with
extraordinary force. When she woke the next morning,
the same idea filled her mind. If only he were shown to
a doctor, she should feel safe and happy. But how was
she to get it done? -
Her mother was fully occupied with the county ball
party, not yet dispersed, and was not likely to pay
another visit to the nursery. Her temporary anxiety
about Totty was, Nina knew, completely allayed by his
improved appearance the morning before, and, proba-
bly, by finding him sleeping quietly in the evening. But,
then, she had not bent over him and heard that dreadful
jerky breathing. Wilson would very likely not notice it
either, and would put down his languor and paleness to
the sleeplessness of Monday night. Besides, poor little
Totty had cried "Wolf" too often for Wilson to be
likely to take alarm. All, then, depended upon herself;
and her whole heart was set on accomplishing her object.
Probably she would not have been so alive to Totty's
condition, had it not been for what she had overheard. *
His appearance, when she went for a minute into the
nursery, only confirmed her in her resolution. Wilson
was not there, or perhaps Nina would have tried to in-
spire the woman with her own fears. All the morning long
she was trying to shape a plan, but it was very difficult to

256 7A/RO WAV 7"OG/E 7THER.
know how to set about it. She half thought, in her des-
peration, of going straight to her mother. But then she
remembered that she was in disgrace, and had been for-
bidden to approach her on any pretense whatsoever.
Besides, the futility of offering advice to Mrs. Middleton
could not but occur to her. She passed a restless morn-
ing, and by luncheon-time could not hold her head up.
Unfortunately, she saw nothing of Mervyn, so she could
not relieve herself by consulting with him.
Colonel Middleton, full of his new idea that his nephew
was too much cooped up, had sent him out rabbiting
with the keeper, and there was no chance of his return
till dusk. Her luncheon was, by her mother's orders,
sent up to her in the school-room, and Madame, realizing
that something was wrong, dared not be lenient where
Mrs. Middleton was severe; though she was alarmed at
the girl's appearance, and felt sure she was ill. She
asked no questions, but she took it upon herself to forbid
Nina's going out that afternoon, and begged her to lie
down and rest while she and Cecily were taking their
walk. So the child was left alone in the school-room to
her own sad thoughts. Rest was out of the question.
The body could not rest while the mind was so unquiet.
She told herself, as she sat there, musing, that she was
doing nothing for Totty; that the afternoon was wearing
on, and that every moment was precious. She tortured
herself by the thought that the days were getting very
short, that the night would soon be here, and that then it
would be more difficult to send for the doctor.
"If I am to do it at all," she said, at last, out loud, "I
must do it at once. But what can I do?"
She got up and walked restlessly up and down the room.
Suddenly it came into her mind, as a last resource, that
she would make an appeal to her father. It must, indeed,

have been a resolution born of despair; but, once taken,
she hesitated no more.
She left the school-room, went straight down to the
smoking-room, and knocked at the door. There was no
answer, so she opened the door, and peeped in. The
room was empty, and a fear came into her mind that he
was already gone out, and that she was too late. She
went hastily into the hall, to see if his hat was missing.
But all his hats were there, and his great-coat, gloves, and
riding-whip put ready. He was evidently going for a ride,
and had not yet started. It was nearly half-past three by
the hall clock, so that if he were going at all he would go
soon. Would it be best to waylay him in the hall, or to
return to the smoking-room P. He would be sure to go in
there the last thing to fetch his cigars, and it would be
a better hiding-place than the hall. So the child retraced
her steps, and, fearful lest some one else might by chance
come in and find her there, she hid herself behind a sofa
near the window. Putting her head against it and stretch-
ing out her tired little limbs, she closed her weary eyes;
and while she thought she was listening to every sound
that might indicate his approach, slumber stole gently
over her, and bore her away from her present anxieties.
With her hands folded across her chest, her long, dark
eyelashes sweeping her cheek and contrasting with its
deadly paleness,white as a beautiful marble statue, and
almost as motionless,-she waited her father's coming.

THE STORM.
CoLonEL MIDDLETON was sadly out of a job that day,
and cast about for some employment. He strolled into
his wife's boudoir, where she was writing letters for the
afternoon post, and pulled down the blinds, saying that
the sun was ruining the carpet. He then pulled them up
again, as the sun went behind a cloud, and Mrs. Middle-
ton complained of the darkness. Then he discovered,
or thought he discovered, that the blind was out of
order, and that the springs didn't go quite right; so he
pulled it up and down, rapidly and with the utmost vio-
lence, for some minutes, making a most horrible noise.
Mrs. Middleton, fortunately for her, was called away
in the middle.
He then rang for the butler, and indignantly asked
him who was in the habit of pulling down these blinds,
because it was evident that that person did not know how
to do it. The butler was of opinion that it was in all
probability the housemaid, upon which he was commis-
sioned instantly to summon her to her master's presence.
The housemaid naturally repudiated the idea of not being
mistress of that simple machinery, and visited the blame
on the under-housemaid.
But Colonel Middleton was not particular; he only
wanted some one on whom to vent his grievance; and
she underwent a lecture of ten minutes or so on the art
of pulling up blinds, for which I am afraid she was any-
thing but grateful. That little occupation over, and the

housemaid dismissed, Colonel Middleton discovered a
miniature blot of ink on the wall behind one of the
writing-tables, and determined to trace it to its source.
His great desire on these occasions was not so much
to cure the evil as to find out its perpetrator; and he
instantly attacked the footman, who happened at that
moment to come in with the coals.
He discoursed to him for some time on the necessity of
care in dipping his pen into the ink when sitting at that
particular writing-table, as ink was so very likely to be
spurted on to the wall behind.
"It only wants a little care," he urged; "the com-
monest care would prevent it."
The footman listened respectfully, coal-scuttle in hand;
but, as he was innocent of writing his letters in the draw-
ing-room, Colonel Middleton's remarks did not fall upon
his ear with that power to which such eloquence was
entitled.
Pleased, however, with the sound of his own voice,
and having his hand well in, Colonel Middleton now
made 'some remarks on the want of brightness of the
coal-scuttle, and had some valuable hints to offer on the
scouring and cleaning of the same.
But no servant could stand being found fault with for
the neglected duties of a fellow-servant; and the foot-
man hastily reminded his master that cleaning and scour-
ing were not in his department, and referred him to a
certain "Ann," who seemed likely to prove the delin-
quent.
But this was a matter of detail, above which Colonel
Middleton's mind soared.
"I know, I know, my good fellow; I'm not blaming
you. I am only just saying, etc. etc. etc.;" upon which
he launched into a still longer dissertation on household

duties, till the footman, becoming desperate, suggested
fetching the said "Ann," that she might bear the brunt
of the remarks upon her short-comings. But Colonel
Middleton did not at all care to confront the trembling
form of Ann, and, having come to the end of his tether,
he dismissed the subject and the footman at the same
In Onnent.
Left alone in the boudoir, he strayed towards his wife's
writing-table, and began reading some notes and letters
he found lying there. They were evidently, in his
opinion, old, and not worth keeping; for he began tear-
ing up one or two, and gathering the scraps into a neat
little heap.
His wife came in, in the middle.
"My dear Lydia," he said, "how very untidy your
writing-table is Such an accumulation of old notes I
never saw."
"Oh, please, Rowley, leave them alonel What have
you been tearing up?"
"Only notes that might have been burnt long ago. I
can't think why yout keep them after they have been
answered."
"But how do you know they have been answered P I
wish you would not do these things without consulting
me. I do believe you have torn up the very one I was
just answering. Yes!" she went on, advancing to the
table, and hastily turning over the torn papers, "yes!
that you have. There it is, torn to shreds. That is Lady
Drewe's writing; and it was an invitation to go there
next month, and I haven't a notion what day she asked
us for. Really, it is very tiresome !"
Colonel Middleton felt rather small, and did not quite
know how to defend himself. -
"Well, you will be the sufferer," said Mrs. Middleton,
## p. 261 (#267) ############################################
7A/E STOA'AM. 261
biting her lips to keep down her irritation, "for you will
lose your shooting."
Colonel Middleton was always a little amused to see his
wife in a rage, and pretended to be provokingly indiffer-
ent; but the incident put an end to his "grievance-hunt-
ing'' for that day, and he went off to the smoking-room.
He walked in, whistling, and stood in front of the fire,
debating in his own mind what he would do next. As he
stood there, he fancied he heard a sound of breathing.
It was quite soft, but still audible, and very regular. He
looked about, but saw no means of accounting for it.
Still it went on, and he instituted a search, and, to his
surprise, came upon a little figure, evidently in hiding,
lying asleep on the floor, near the window. -
"Nina ('' he exclaimed.
But the worn-out child did not stir. He bent down
over her.
"Nina are you asleep?"
He touched her hair admiringly: "What a handsome
little creature she is l'' - -
Nina started up with a face of terror.
"Is he worse?" she exclaimed.
"Who?" laughed Colonel Middleton.
"Totty," she answered, looking round her, bewil-
dered.
"My dear little girl, I am afraid you are not very well
to-day, or else you are dreaming. There is nothing the
matter with Totty."
"Oh, yes, papa, there is l'" she exclaimed ; "I am sure
there is . I don't think mamma can know, or she would
send for the doctor. Papa, will you please ask her to
send for him P"
"Get up, my dear child, and sit in the arm-chair. I
don't quite understand all this."
## p. 262 (#268) ############################################
262 THROWN TOGETHER.
Nina seated herself in the arm-chair, and began to pour
out all that she had meant to say.
Colonel Middleton saw, by her incoherency, and the
nervous twist of her hands, that she was very much
agitated, and got puzzled, not seeing any sufficient
Cause. 
"Did you come here to tell me all this?"
"Yes, papa."
"And why?"
"I thought you would ask mamma to send for the
doctor."
Colonel Middleton looked much bored.
"Oh, my dear, I never interfere. If your mother and
the nurses saw any occasion, she would of course have
sent for him. Her not having done so proves there is no
cause for alarm. Don't you see ?"
"Oh, but, papa, I don't think she can know ! He looks
so ill, so dreadfully ill !" And Nina burst into tears.
Colonel Middleton had all a man's horror of tears. He
began to walk up and down the room.
"Oh, this will never do | You are nervous, Nina, or
over-tired, or something. I think it is you, and not
Totty, that requires a doctor. Come with me to your
mother, and we will see if she can't give you a little sal-
volatile, or something."
But Nina shrank back.
"Oh, no l'" she exclaimed ; "I can't go to mamma.
She won't see me !"
"Not see you!"
"She has forbidden me to come near her."
"Why, what naughty things have you been doing?"
said Colonel Middleton, patronizingly; "playing at fox-
hunting in the school-room, talking to the coachman out
riding, or what other enormity?"

-
The child was incapable of answering. She only shook
her head.
"So you want to make me the scapegoat, eh? I
couldn't undertake to mediate between ladies, really. It's
not in my line."
"Oh, papa, I don't want you to say anything about
me, only to try and persuade her to send for the doctor
for Totty."
"But whysupposing, for the sake of the argument, that
Totty was ill (which he is not)should you think you
know better than your mother and the nurses? Why, in
short, should you take the matter into your hands at all?
What is it to you?"
"I love him so, papa
The words burst from the girl's lips almost like a cry.
They seemed to escape her involuntarily, and she clasped
her hands together as she spoke. Her dark eyes glowed
and deepened, and seemed to say how powerful to her
that argument was, and how, in her mind, it explained
and accounted for everything.
Her father glanced at her rather uneasily, and felt, as
he had often felt before, that the girl was too much for
him.
"My dear little daughter," he said, "you take life
much too seriously. Now, do listen to the advice of
your father, who has lived a good many years longer than
you have, and try to take things as they come. I have:
always done so, and found it a capital plan. Now, I will
give you an excellent maxim, which I have always found
most consoling: 'Les choses s'arrangent " Try and
"believe that other people are sure to manage matters as
well, if not better, than you are. If you want a thing
well done, don't do it yourself. Leave everything to
other people. It all comes right in the end. And now

run up-stairs again. A cup of tea will refresh you, and I
want to get a ride before dusk."
They stood opposite each other, those two, -the easy-
going, shallow father, and the suffering, sensitive child.
The contrast between the two faces was very strongly
marked. Earnest intensity was written on every line of
hers, careless superficiality on his.
And in that moment the child recognized it, saw
that what she felt he would never feel ;-that what she
comprehended so clearly he would never, never under-
stand. -
Swift as an arrow there shot into her heart the convic-
tion that she was wasting her time and spending her
strength in vain,that she would never make more im-
pression on him than her own footfall would make upon
the shifting sand, which the next wave would efface alto-
gether. And, as the thought smote upon her, despair crept
into her heart; despair which would have been mingled
with contempt, if her sore heart had had room for any
other feeling.
She turned away without a word, and closed the door
behind her.
We need not follow the poor little thing up-stairs, nor
through the evening that followed, when, as night closed
in, all her fears returned with redoubled intensity. All
hope of the doctor coming was over. She went to her
bedroom as soon as Mervyn had gone down to dessert.
She did not communicate her anxieties to him : perhaps
she feared to give them expression.
She felt so tired, when she had undressed, that she lay
down on the bed to rest for a few minutes before going to
Totty.
It was one of those oppressive, thundery evenings
that come sometimes in October. She was overdone
## p. 265 (#271) ############################################
7 HE STORM. 265
by excitement and restless nights, and she fell asleep
directly.
She was awakened some hours after by the roll of dis-
tant thunder. She started up, wondering what it was,
and dismayed to find she had been to sleep, and that now
it was too late to go to Totty. But it is not the thunder
which causes such an expression of terror to come over
her face. There is a sound above the distant rumble, to
which she listens with a beating heart. It is the loud
ringing of the nursery-bell.
Again and again it peals, and it is followed by a stir
and commotion in the house.
It is as she feared, then | Her worst dread is realized,
Totty is taken ill; and now it is night, and the doctor
is far away !
With a beating heart she springs out of bed, crying,
"Oh, why didn't they listen to me? Why wouldn't they
believe what I said P''
Vague ideas of running, as she was, over fields and
meadows to fetch him, pass through her brain: who
would be so fleet as she P
There is no feeling of triumph in the poor child's breast
that the event has proved her right, and that she is justified
in her forebodings. No, only a deadly fear.
She gropes her way to the door, trembling in every
limb, and grasps the handle in her shaking hand. It
seems to resist, and she steadies her hand and tries again.
Still she cannot open it. The handle turns, but the door
will not open.
"I must have bolted it by mistake " she exclaims, im-
patiently, and she pulls nervously at the little bolt. All
to no purpose ; and the child is getting more and more
agitated.
Suddenly a thought seems to dart into her mind, and

words to which she has hitherto attached no meaning
flash clear across her brain. Her mother has locked
her in
:k  >k >k >k #:
This, then, is the punishment of which she spoke I this
the sure and certain means she has adopted to insure com-
pliance with her commands !
Then a mighty tempest passed over the soul of the child,
and her very being seemed shaken by the force of the
passions which stirred within her. Throwing herself upon
her knees, she called aloud, in her fury and despair,
"Mammal mamma! I hate you! I wish you were dead!"
Crouching against the door, she hammered upon it with
her hands, crying, "Open the door Open it, I say !
Open it directly l''
A loud clap of thunder was the answer, rattling and
crackling over her head till the very room seemed to
shake. It was a kind of relief to the child. It seemed
to express all the wild feelings which were raging in her
heart, wrath, rebellion, hatred, and revenge.
The lightning flashed into the darkness of the room,
revealing the little figure crouching by the door. It
played about her, and she felt no fear; it flashed in her
face, and she did not start or wince. The thunder hurled
with her anathemas against her mother, and she flashed
upon her in imagination with the lightning.
Down came the torrents of rain, beating against the
window as if the very doors of heaven were opening and
the waters pouring out.
It was a fearful storm ; but the tempest raging without
was as nothing compared with the tempest raging in the
heart of the child. To her the relief of tears did not
come. The fury of the tempest was spent, for the danger
is over when the rain comes. Not so with the child. The
## p. 267 (#273) ############################################
7A/E STOA'Al/. 267
storm of her fury was still raging, for the danger is not
over till the tears come.
And what is to bring them to her eyes? Those eyes
are hard and dry; the little heart is like a stone, and the
hot, parched lips have no sign of softening in them. But
is anything too hard for the Lord? He who smote the
stony rock that the waters gushed out, and ran in the
dry places, will soften the stony heart; and "Rivers of
water gush from mine eyes," will He make the proud lips
say.
He who rides upon the whirlwind and directs the storm
who rebuked the raging of the winds and waves, so that
they ceased, and there was a great calmwill direct the
whirlwind of anger, and say to the surging waves of pas-
sion, "Peace be still l''
Exhausted for a moment, the child lay quiet; and there
came into her mind, she knew not wherefore, the memory
of Mervyn kneeling by Totty's bedside. Then the thought
of the moonlight on the water, and the accents of Mervyn's
voice.
"In heaven," it seemed to repeat, "they all love every
one, and you love so few. Sometimes I think you will
never understand 3 *
"Forgive us our trespasses,

"Nina, why wouldn't you join with me?
The peace of the well-remembered scene, and the
thoughts of love and heaven connected with it, came
upon the child as she lay, like a cool hand laid upon a
burning forehead; like oil on the tempestuous waters;
like the chime of church-bells heard through the howling
of the wind on a wild wet night.
It seemed like a whisper from another world; something
which she in her fury of feeling had nothing to do with ;

it said again, "as we for-

which she was not pure enough to look upon, or holy
enough to understand.
Opposed to the atmosphere of wrath and hatred in
which she was now plunged, it seemed one of such peace
and love, and it seemed so far away ! Heaven itself could
not seem holier, since love is heaven, and heaven is peace
and love. Nor could heaven itself seem more far away !
Given up to all wicked feelings, she felt herself, as it
were, cut off from heaven, with its boundless universal
love, a prey to hatred and revenge, only fit now to look
from a distance on that scene of peace and purity. So
do we picture to ourselves the Lost looking from their
Place of Darkness, upon the Heaven which might have
been theirs
Struck with horror at the contrast, and longing to escape
from so terrible a condition, she cried aloud, in her desire
to be saved from herself, "Mervyn ! Mervyn !" Thus do
we ever seek first earthly comfort and support; flying ever
first to our brother man; forgetting that we have a friend
that sticketh closer than a brother, and that He is ever

Then came a pause in the storm, both within and with-
out; and there was a calm. The silence that reigned
made a sound in the passage audible; and the child lis-
tened intently.
Was it a voice? It was It must be l She

listened intently again. The voice was hardly above a
whisper, but the voice said, "Nina."
"Mervyn !" she exclaimed; "oh, Mervyn, is that
you?"
"Yes, Nina, I've been here some time; but you were
never quiet a moment, and I couldn't make you hear."
"Oh, Mervyn," said Nina, "unlock the door l''
"Hush, Nina. I can't. The key is not here. Listen
to what I am going to say. The doctor has come, and
he is in Totty's room."
"Oh, thank God thank God l'" she exclaimed, and
- the glad relief of tears came at last. "It will be all right
now." -
"Don't cry so, Nina dear. I will go and see if I can
find out more. Keep quiet till I come back. And please
don't cry."
No need to tell her to keep quiet now ; the storm-
tempest has spent its fury, and the wicked feelings have
fled away, dispelled by the very sound of his voice. The
tears came raining down after he had left her, cooling the
burning eyes, soothing and refreshing as a soft summer
shower. Gentler feelings came over her, feelings of re-
pentance and contrition, as she sat there, quiet, save for
a little sobbing sigh now and then,waiting for the first
indication of his return.
The confusion in the house got greater; doors opened
and shut, footsteps passed and repassed; but still the
little figure remained motionless as a statue, unheeding
and unmoved. A great calm had come upon the soul
of the child. The doctor was there ; what she had so
striven to bring about had been accomplished ; what she
had so despaired of had been brought to pass: the doctor
was there. That was all that mattered now.
Mervyn came back at last, whispering that he could

find out nothing, but that everybody was up and about
in the house, and his aunt shut up with the doctor in
Totty's room. Then he went away.
All, then, that could be done was being done, and
every one's mind full of Totty. Her own individual pres-
ence could be no great good. So she sat there calm and
content, satisfied, even thankful.
"Thank God 1" she whispered, every now and then ;
and that whisper was heartfelt prayer.
Her heart was thrilling with a nameless feeling, half
pride, half joy, that Totty should thus be recognized
as an object worthy the anxiety and attention of the
whole household. "Every one in the house is up,"
she repeated, half aloud ; "every one is thinking about
Totty."
A long time elapsed. Anxiety was beginning to creep
into her heart again, when the sudden sound of a car-
riage driving away completely upset her, and she started
to her feet with a great cry, and a sudden chill at her
heart.
"He is going because he can do no good l'' she ex-
claimed, wringing her hands, and running to the window.
Her suspicion, alas ! was fully confirmed when she caught
sight of the carriage vanishing in the distance; and from
that moment hope fled.
Then came the longing, so mercifully withheld before,
to see him, if only for once more ; to be with him, to
hear his voice again ; and she flung herself on her knees
and sobbed, "O God, pity me ! O God l help me !
By some way or other take me to him and let me see him
again l''
Her face was hidden in her hands, and her ear was deaf
to any sound but the cry she was uttering. So she did
not hear the unlocking of the door, nor see that some one
## p. 271 (#277) ############################################
7/// S 7 OA&M/. 271
had entered,till a hand was laid upon her shoulder, and
a voice said, "Come.''
Raising her head, she saw her mother standing before
her, and knew that her prayer was answered. There was
something in her mother's white face and shaking hands
that checked the words which trembled on the child's
lips, and she answered her never a word. But, as in a
dream, she rose and followed her, through the familiar
passages, into the familiar nursery, just as she was, in her
little white night-gown, with her dark hair streaming.
As in a dream, she was conscious of the many forms in
the room, of the weeping nurses, of the unwonted pres-
ence of her father; but she seemed to have no concern
with any one or anything but Totty. She thought of
nothing, saw nothing, but him.
Every one drew back to allow her to pass; and she
moved on alone to the little white bed, where the still
little figure was lying. The world seemed to retire, and
to leave the brother and sister alone. She knelt down by
his side and clasped his thin little hands.
"Totty," she whispered.
The blue eyes opened, and a faint smile broke over the
colorless little face.
"Nina," he just managed to breathe, "kiss me,
Nina."
And as she kissed himhe died.

MAGDALEN'S RETURN.
LADY WARDLAw to Colonel Middleton."Charlie
has been telegraphed for to Ireland, and went off at once.
I am coming straight to you, and hope to be at Granton
Thursday morning."
Such was the missive which was put into Mervyn's hand
the next day, as he sat by himself in the little study,
writing to his mother. It had arrived late the evening
before ; but in the confusion of events no one had re-
membered to inform him of its contents.
"Colonel Middleton told me to bring it direct to you,
sir," said the butler, as he handed the paper, "and to tell
you her ladyship will be here in a very few minutes."
Mervyn opened the paper listlessly. Sick at heart, the
boy felt very indifferent to its contents. His only feeling
was vexation at the interruption, for he wanted to relieve
his full heart by pouring out to his mother a recital of
the sad events of the last few days. "Her ladyship"
conveyed no idea to him. He had not a notion of whom
the butler was speaking. Slowly he opened the telegram,
and slowly he read the contents. But he did not take it
in. He read it again, and then again, and stared at it.
Suddenly his color deepened, and he put his hand up to
his head, as if to steady his brain and to try to understand
what he was reading. What did the telegram say?
By degrees the meaning dawned,just dawned slightly.
He gathered that she was coming ; but why, or how, or
when, he could not at first comprehend.
## p. 273 (#279) ############################################

"She is coming !" he said softly to himself; "she is
coming here !"
Still, he could not quite take it in, or realize all at once
what those few words really expressed.
"She is coming on Thursday," he said, presently; "on
Thursday morning. Thursday ! that is how many days
off? To-day is why, to-day is Thursday !" he sud-
denly exclaimed ; "she is coming to-day ! to-day !"
We must forgive him if, at that moment, all thoughts
of the sorrowing household fled away. He had room in
his heart for nothing but a joy so great, so boundless,
that his whole face changed, radiated with a sudden light;
and he sprang to his feet with a sound which would have
been a shout if something like a sob had not mingled
with it.
Sorrow and death, which had been weighing upon his
young spirit so heavily, lost their depressing power, and
from their depths he rose into the height and breadth of
a happiness that seemed to lift him out of himself. It
was almost too much for him. She was coming. She
would be here almost directly. Henceforth he would
have nothing to regret, nothing to long for.
"She will be here !" he told himself; "she will
stand in this very room | I shall see her, I, with my own
eyes!"
And while fancy is thus painting the scene to the heart
of the child, the picture is a reality; for Magdalen is
there; she is standing in the room; and if he only turns
his head, he will see her.
No need for her to try and attract his attention for fear
of startling him; no need for her to still her beating
heart and softly to pronounce his name ! He was con-
scious of her presence directly,knew the very rustle of
her gown and the sound of her light footfall,fet she was

there, and shaded his eyes with his hand before he turned
them on her, as if he feared to be dazzled by the sight of
what he had so longed for.
Then, too, suddenly, came the fear and the misgiving.
Would she be changed? Would there be some alteration P
Would it be quite the mother he remembered,whose
picture fancy had been painting all the time?
But when he really saw the sweet face, when his glance
rested on the well-known features and the familiar smile, L
when he met the eyes that were shining and glowing with
love for him, all his doubts and fears vanished. He threw
up his hands with a glad cry, and went straight into her
arms without a word. Nor did he find voice to express
his joy and welcome till he felt her arms enfold him, and
her soft kisses rain on his cheek. Then, and not till
then, did his feelings find vent in a tumult of love and
rejoicing !

For a whole hour they have been together, and still he
has not exhausted all he has to say. She is sitting with
his hand in hers, gazing at him as at something for which
her eyes have long been searching, listening while he
pours forth what he has to tell.
The bare outline of what had happened she had heard
at the station, and she had seen her brother for a few mo-
ments in the hall; but beyond that she knew nothing.
Very few words had passed between her and Colonel
Middleton. He had brought her at once to the door of
Mervyn's sitting-room, and had left her to enter alone,
while he went to tell his wife of her arrival.
So that Mervyn's explanations were fully needed. He
gave her an account of all that had happened, from the
night of the county ball. He enlarged upon the state of
affairs between mother and daughter, and painted a vivid
## p. 275 (#281) ############################################
Al/A G DAZAZAV'S RE 7"URAW. 275
picture of the lovelessness of the Granton atmosphere, and
of how he had suffered from it.
His mother drew him to her when he spoke of these
things, softly whispering, "It is all over now;" and Mer-
vyn put his head on her shoulder, with a delicious feeling
of security and peace. But his mind was more full of
the recent events than of his own bygone troubles, and
he returned to the subject of Nina.
"I have not seen her this morning," he concluded.
"I peeped into her room, but she was fast asleep."
"Is no one with her?" asked Lady Wardlaw. "Has
not your aunt been to her?" -
"She never goes into Nina's room, mother."
"But has the poor child no one looking after her ? not
even the nurse or governess?"
"Oh, no, mother I don't think Nina would like it ;
she is not very not exactly nice to the nurse and gov-
erness, you see. I think they would be afraid to go to
her.'' - -
"But it seems so sad the child should be alone in her
grief."
"She is asleep, mother."
"Yes, dear; but fancy what a lonely waking !"
Just then a message came that Mrs. Middleton would
like to see Lady Wardlaw ; and Magdalen rose directly.
She noticed Mervyn's look of disappointment.
"I am sorry to leave you so soon, darling, but we must
not be selfish, you and I. Other people want us just now,
as much as we want each other, don't they?"
"Oh, no l'' said Mervyn, promptly. But he recovered
himself directly, and said, "Yes, mother; and I'll go to
Nina and sit by her till she wakes." -
"Do, darling, if you think she would like it."
And then Magdalen followed the maid to Mrs. Middle-

ton's apartments, and Mervyn stole softly into Nina's
darkened room. He had grown so accustomed to her
sympathy in his pleasures and his pains, that it seemed
strange he should not be able to communicate to her the
joyful news of his mother's return. He half hoped to
find her awake; and as he went along he had debated
within himself whether he would not wake her up to tell
her. But when he stood by her bedside, his mind changed.
She looked so pale and sad that he felt he was quite selfish
to be glad about anything while she was so unhappy. His
bright face clouded when his eyes fell upon her face. He
remembered that she would wake to the memory of a
sorrow as deep as his joy; and he felt that it would indeed
be cruel to rouse her from her quiet sleep. For, pale and
ill though she looked, she was sleeping quietly the sleep
of thorough exhaustion. For the time she had forgotten
her troubles. If she woke, she would remember them
directly. Nothing that he could do or say could comfort
her like the quiet sleep she was enjoying. What could he
do for her, loving and willing as he was, that unconscious-
ness could do?
"What would we do for our beloved?
God giveth His belovdsleep!"
So he sat quietly down by her side to wait till she should
wake up herself. He did not mind waiting. He had
plenty to occupy his thoughts. The sun stole in through
the chinks of the closed shutters, and shone upon the
two children; on the one who had got back all that he
had longed for; on the other, from whom all that she had
loved had been taken away. One little figure was almost
as motionless as the other.
At last, with a sigh, Nina began to stir a little; and
Mervyn restrained his eagerness, and hardly allowed him-

self to breathe, lest he should hasten her return to the
consciousness of her sorrow. But in God's good provi-
dence the child's waking thoughts brought her a sense of
rest and peace, to which she had long been a stranger.
Dimly came back to her the scenes of last night, the
storm, and the tumult, and the passion; but above all
was that strange new feeling of quiet and relief.
For all anxiety is over now. Never again need she
start and tremble at the sound of the nursery-bell. Never
again need she lie awake restless, fearing he is restless
too. No more anxious listening to the wind in the
chimney, fearing it may be roaring near his bed. No
more will he suffer from nervous fancies, from sickness, or
from pain. Never again need she wrestle wildly with that
haunting fear and dread. The ghost which pursued her
is laid forever, and the worst is over now. Never again
need she chafe at the feeling that he is overlooked and
despised. The little "black sheep" is a white lamb now,
safe in the Shepherd's arms, is a ewe-lamb lying for ever
and ever in the bosom of his Saviour, above. Never again
need her heart beat wildly, and her jealous indignation
be aroused, because he is not summoned to his parents'
presence when the guests are assembled there. He is
more highly exalted now ! In his Father's presence for
ever and ever, and the shining angels round ! What recks
he now that his knees are feeble and his limbs powerless
and weak? Has he not wings to bear him whither his
Father wills him to go?
No thought of self mingled with these pure feelings.
Long ago Nina's self had gone out into Totty; and in
her love for him she had lost sight of it.
So quietly, and almost happily, she awoke, and found
Mervyn sitting by her bed.
"Mervyn !" she said, softly.

He bent over her, kissing her joyfully, but restraining
his words, lest his joy should seem selfish.
"Mervyn," she said, quickly, "let me look at your
face l''
"Why?" he said, coming closer, and thinking he was
cleverly hiding the joy which was shining out of his
honest eyes.
"Mervyn, Aunt Magdalen has come ! I am sure of it."
"Oh, never mind I'' he answered, joyously, but still
trying to look grave; "it doesn't matter a bit ! I mean
we won't talk about it if you'd rather not Oh, Ninal
how did you guess?" he finished, suddenly letting his
delight have its vent. "I didn't mean to tell you,
really "
"I guessed it by your face," she answered, smiling.
"I'm so, so glad, Mervyn ! I can never tell you how
glad I am . Oh, Mervyn, how happy you must be But
why do you say you had not meant to tell me?"
And she looked wistfully at his beaming eyes. Her
own glittered rather strangely, and her manner was very
excited.
A more experienced person than Mervyn would have
taken alarm at her appearance. He only took her hands
in his, and said,
"I was afraid of being selfish."
"Tell me all about it," she said, rather faintly, as she
tightened her hold on his hands. "I feel too tired and
too giddy to ask you questions; and I want so much to
hear."
Mervyn instantly poured forth his tale of joy; and she
listened with an excited attention.
"In thy presence is the fullness of joy," she whis-
pered, when he had finished. "Is Granton like heaven

Her lips quivered as she put the question.
"Oh, no, Nina darling !" he said, with a sudden im-
pulse, throwing his arms round her neck; "how can I
be quite happy when you are so miserable? If I have
got my heaven, you have lost yours l''
The pain of her loss, the terrible sense of the void in
her life, smote upon Nina at his words, and she gave way
to a burst of bitter, bitter weeping. Clinging to Mer-
vyn, she begged him to love her, for she had no one left
to love her now !

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER BROUGHT TOGETHER.
MEAN while Lady Wardlaw went straight to Mrs. Mid-
dleton's room. Her brother was just coming out, and at
sight of her he closed the door behind him rather hastily,
and drew her aside in the passage.
"I can't get her to cheer up at all," he said, with a
very rueful face. "I don't know when I have seen her
so cut up. Perhaps you will be more fortunate than I,
being a fresh arrival. You will be able to distract her a
little by telling her about your travels, and so on. Do
try what you can do. And, I say, Magdalen, come to
the smoking-room afterwards. Every one went off this
morning early, and I haven't a creature to speak to."
He passed on, and Magdalen opened the door and
went in.
Mrs. Middleton rose to receive her, a mere wreck, to
Lady Wardlaw's eyes, of the Mrs. Middleton of three

months ago. Even her manner was changed: all the
decision had gone out of it. Her voice shook when she
tried to speak, and the hand she held out trembled all
over. In one short night the work had been done. The
strong-minded, self-willed Mrs. Middleton had become
an unnerved, broken-down woman. A stronger than
she had met and overcome her, had taken away the
armor in which she trusted, and laid her powerless and
defeated in the dust. She had never, as we said before,
lost a child, or conceived the possibility of such a thing.
But, nevertheless, the King of Terrors had entered her
stronghold, and, heedless of her and of her will, had
taken away the spoil.
In the silent watches of the night she had been forced
to recognize a will stronger than her own, a strength
greater, a Power before which she must bow. Nor
had she known how to stand her defeat. From the
moment when, roused by the bell, she had rushed to the
nursery and found Totty had broken a blood-vessel, all
her power of self-control had fled. Utterly unnerved,
completely helpless, every maid in the house had been of
greater use than she.
In her undisciplined rebellion she had broken out into
reproaches first, into lamentations afterwards. She had
failed utterly; failed before the whole household; her
humiliation had been complete. Even the doctor had
been obliged to beg Colonel Middleton to take his wife
away, as her want of self-control was unnerving every
One.
In that supreme moment, too, she had realized her
husband's shallowness, and turned in loathing from his
superficial attempts at consolation. In her helplessness
and her terror she had felt he was no prop at all; and she
had longedshe who had always been more than sufficient

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. 28I
for herselffor some strength to lean upon, some one to
turn to.
Then had come to her the thought of her little daughter;
the recollection of the dauntless way in which the child
had withstood her to her face, sooner than promise to
neglect her little brother. With Totty dying before her
eyes, Mrs. Middleton had forgotten the disobedience, the
irreverence, the determined opposition. She had only
remembered the calmness, the fearlessness, the quiet. She
had only felt that the child who could act so was a tower
of strength. The very thought of the steadfast eyes and
the firm little mouth had been rest to her. Vividly she
had remembered the former scene in the bedroom nursery,
when the restless child had been lulled to sleep, and her
own anxiety allayed, by the calm influence of the girl's
presence and power. She had felt it might help her
again; she had felt she must have it at any price, though
she knew the price must be her own defeat. She had felt
she must fetch the girl, though she knew no hand but hers
could set the prisoner free. She must reverse her own
decree, herself put an end to the punishment she had
devised and inflicted. It was one step further into the
Valley of Humiliation; but she had hardly seemed to
care for that.
She was a vanquished woman: what did it matter?
So, while all were occupied with Totty, she had stolen
away to Nina's room. She had thought to find the child
asleep; had turned the key very softly, and entered gently,
for fear of waking her too suddenly.
The little kneeling figure that had met her gaze, the
face the child had turned towards her at her touch, the
calmness with which she had risen and followed her, the
utter absence of all questioning, of all excitement, of all
weak display of grief, the power of self-control with
24*

which she had knelt down by the bed and whispered the
dying boy's name, all this had been a moving panorama
before the mother's eyes ever since, making her heart
thrill with a feeling half of envy and half of admiration,
and causing her to regard the girl's strength, as contrasted
with her own weakness, in the light of something almost
superhuman.
She had been lying on the sofa in her dressing-room
ever since she had been brought in hysterics from the
bedroom nursery; and her one longing all that time had
been for Nina.
She wanted to learn the secret of her calmness, that she
might be calm too. She wanted to learn the secret of her
resignation, that she might be resigned too. Above all,
she wanted some one who could feel and suffer, to sympa-
thize and grieve with her. Her husband's remarks on the
sad event that morning, and his trivial talking over the
changes of plan it would entail, had driven her wild. She
had seen how little the loss personally affected him, and
every word he had let fall had jarred upon her. She had
felt as if no one but Nina and herself had cared for the
child at all. And yet she dared not send for her, dared
not go to her. It was not from pride,-poor woman she
was humbled to the dust now, it was positively from
fear.
Such was the state of mind in which Magdalen found
her when she entered the room. -
Her gentle words of sympathy made Mrs. Middleton
break down at first; but in a few minutes it seemed a
relief to her to give an account of the poor little fellow's
sudden illness and death.
There was silence between them when the recital was
OVer.
"Magdalen," said Mrs. Middleton, rather suddenly,

MOZAZEA? AAWD D.A. UGAZTEA'. 283
at last, "have you seen any of the children since you
came?" -
"Only Mervyn, dear Lydia."
"Did he mention any of them; Cecily, or
mund P''
"Not them; only poor little Nina."
Mrs. Middleton got up, and began to walk restlessly
up and down the room.
"What did he say about her?"
"He said he thought she was still asleep. But that
is some little time ago. She may be awake now. Do
you want to see her, Lydia?"
Mrs. Middleton put out her hand as if to keep the sub-
ject off, and walked up and down more restlessly than
ever. That she was much agitated Lady Wardlaw could
see, for her chest was heaving; and she held one hand to
her heart, as if to still its beating. -
"Magdalen," she said, suddenly turning round upon
her sister-in-law, and Lady Wardlaw was shocked to see
the expression of anguish which was painted on her face,
"oh, Magdalen you don't know how I long to see her,
and yet I do not dare You don't know what a child
that is I have only lately discovered it. She is full of
character and determination, full of thought and affection,
full of self-control and every other noble feeling. Un-
happily, she has thwarted me, and I have been very severe
with her. More unhappily still, the thwarting and the
severity were connected with my poor little boy.
And now I feel as if she would hate me. I know she is
one of those who must either love or hate ; and I know
she does not love me. So I am afraid yes, Magda-
len, afraid to see her. I could notmy heart is too

different. I could not be reproached, triumphed over,
despised  2
"Oh, hush, dear! hush '' said Magdalen, much shocked.
"Indeed, Lydia, I do not think you can know what you
are saying. The poor child is stupefied with grief. It
seems to me quite cruel to leave her alone. Won't you
come to her, and see?"
"No, no," said Mrs. Middleton; "I cannot, indeed
I cannot. Besides, I am sure she would not like it. You
don't understand her or me. How should you? You
and Mervyn are so different."
"Dear Lydia," remonstrated Magdalen, "you will
tire yourself so if you walk up and down like that. Pray
sit down."
Mrs. Middleton sat down.
"You have heard all this before, Magdalen P"
"Yes, Lydia."
"From Mervyn P"
"From Mervyn."
"Where is Mervyn now?"
"In Nina's room."
"Nina is very fond of Mervyn."
"So I fancy; and Mervyn is very fond of her."
"It is selfish of me to keep you away from Mervyn,
Magdalen. You must be longing to be with him, I am
sure. Pray do not stay here."
"Well, I will go to him for a few minutes, and then I
... will see how Nina is, and bring you word. Shall I?"
"I should be very grateful."
Magdalen left the room, and proceeded down the
passage. Just outside Nina's room she met Mervyn,
who came bounding up to her, whispering, eagerly,
"Mother, do go in and see Nina. I was coming to fetch
you."
## p. 285 (#291) ############################################
Al/O THER AAVD DAUGA/TEA'. 285
"But, my darling, do you think she would like it?
You forget I am quite a stranger to her."
For all answer Mervyn pushed open the door, and his
mother was obliged to go in. And then she found her-
self alone with Nina.
The girl was lying just as Mervyn had left her, after
soothing her burst of grief. She looked very ill: her
eyes were unnaturally large and bright, and had dark
rings under them. Though the general aspect of her face
was of a deadly pallor, there was a slight tinge of crim-
son on each cheek. She started up when she saw her
aunt, and held out her hands without speaking. Magdalen
took them both : they were burning hot. She was much
alarmed at the girl's appearance, and at the excitement
of her words and manner.
"Aunt Magdalen," she said, earnestly, "don't let
Mervyn stay here; don't leave him here without you.
He is not happy here. I can't tell you how miserable he
has been sometimes without you."
"No, dear," said Magdalen, soothingly; "I won't
leave him any more. But shan't you be sorry to lose
him P''
"Oh, yes! oh, yes! But that doesn't matter."
"Everything matters that makes you happy, my
child."
"I shall never be happy again,"
burst into tears.
"And yet," said Magdalen, gently, "you would not
call back that sweet little fellow from his happiness in
heaven to the life of weakness and suffering he led here?
He would not wish to come; he is happier now than he
has ever been before. You would not if you could, dear
child, would you?"
"Oh, no oh, no l'' exclaimed Nina.
' she said, and she

286 7A/A'O WAV 7TOGAE 7//EA'.
"God loved him so, dear, He wanted to have him
with himself. You can trust him to his Father, Nina,
who loves him even more than you."
"Aunt Magdalen," said Nina, passionately, "you
would have loved him, wouldn't you? You wouldn't
have minded his being weak and sickly? You wouldn't
have thought more of the others because they were stronger
than him P You wouldn't have been ashamed of him,
and have thought him the black sheep of the family, and
despised him 2 If Mervyn had been like him, you wouldn't
have done all this? I mean even if you had had other
children, stronger and finer than him?"
"God forbid, dear!" said Magdalen, wondering what
the girl was driving at. "Do you not know that the
weakest and least prosperous child is always the one a
mother holds most dear?"
"She never did I'' exclaimed Nina.
"Who, dear?" asked Magdalen, bewildered.
"Mamma l' she cried ; "she despised him, she was
ashamed of him I don't believe she will be sorry he is
dead."
Magdalen was inexpressibly shocked. Matters between
the mother and daughter seemed more hopeless than she
had expected. She was bewildered, too. Coming fresh
from Mrs. Middleton, in the abandonment of her grief,
the girl's statement seemed so contradictory. She could
not help feeling they were misunderstanding each other,
and that all might be set right between them. But the
most prominent idea in her mind was that Nina's state
should be put before Mrs. Middleton at once. She was
quite sure that the child was much shaken in nerves and
in body, and she felt she might very likely be on the brink
of a nervous fever, or some such illness.
No doubt it was her duty to call her sister-in-law's at-
## p. 287 (#293) ############################################
A/O 7THER AAWD D.A. UGA/7EA'. 287
tention to it without delay. The mother and daughter
must be brought together, and no weak fear of agitating
the former must prevent her instantly giving the alarm.
But she hardly liked to leave Nina alone, even while she
went to Mrs. Middleton's room on the other side of the
house. So she went to the door and called Mervyn. He
came directly.
"Stay with Nina," she whispered, " and tell her, if
you have an opportunity, how unhappy her mother is, and
how she is longing to see her."
But on her way she called to a servant in the hall, and
gave orders that the doctor should be sent for at once.
She found Mrs. Middleton sitting as she had left her;
but she looked up eagerly at her entrance, and said,
"Well ?" -
"I have nothing good to tell you, Lydia," she said,
very gravely. "I think Nina is very ill, and I don't think
you ought to lose a moment in going to see her."
Her gentle womanly heart smote her as she uttered the
words; but, foreign as it was to her nature to inflict pain,
she felt in this instance that it was the only thing to be
done. But she was not prepared for the effect of her
words on Mrs. Middleton.
"Ill !" she cried, starting to her feet, and hastily throw-
ing a shawl over her shoulders. "She is dying, Magda-
len I see it in your face. Oh, my God I am I to lose
two children in one day ? Take me to her. Oh, Magda-
len, take me quickly "
And she put her hand on her sister-in-law's shoulder
for support.
Magdalen answered, gently, "Believe me, Lydia, no.
She is not so bad as that. Only ill enough to require a
mother's care and attention."
"She shall have both !" exclaimed Mrs. Middleton.

"I would lay down my life for her I will do anything
and everything I can to"
As she was speaking, the door slowly opened, and Mer-
vyn entered, leading Nina by the hand. Her eyes, glow-
ing with mingled feelings, sought her mother's face.
"Mervyn has been telling me," she began, faintly; but
at sight of that mother, so wan-looking, so altered, she
stopped short.
The swollen eyes, the haggard look, the weak, nervous
motion of the hands, the change altogether, filled the
child with feelings which deprived her of speech. Her
mother stopped short, too, in what she was saying, and
stepped back just a little. But neither removed her eyes
from the other's face. Each recognized in the other the
presence of the same sacred common cause of sorrow, and
the change which that sorrow had effected. Each recog-
nized that from the other every trace of antagonism, pride,
resistance, and self-will had fled. Neither spoke, but both
understood. Pity, the mainspring of all that was tender
and holy in the girl, sprang up in her heart at the sight.
Anxiety and love, so long unknown, woke up in the
mother's breast, and pervaded every line of her face.
Very quietly Magdalen led Mervyn away, and closed
the door behind her.
So no eye but God's saw the meeting between mother
and daughter.

* BACK AT GLEN-MERWYN.
"DoESN'T it seem funny, mother," said Mervyn, "that
all this time I have never heard why you came back so
suddenly 2 Your last letter said not till December. I
have never had a minute to ask you till now."
It was evening, and he was sitting in his mother's bed-
room. She was lying on the sofa, and he was in his old
position on the floor, with his head against her, and her
hand in his.
Magdalen answered that a sudden Fenian outbreak on
Lord Wardlaw's estates in Ireland had resulted in the
murder of his agent, and that his immediate presence
there had been necessary. Summoned by telegram, he
had started directly.
As she spoke, she fancied she felt Mervyn shrink a little
into himself; but he said nothing, and she could not see
his face as she lay. His silence did not encourage her to
pursue the conversation, so she did not continue it. She
merely remarked that Lord Wardlaw would join them at
Glen-Mervyn as soon as he was able, but that she did not
know when that would be ; and then she wished the boy
a fond good-night, and begged him to get to bed as
quickly as possible, so as to have a good sleep after the
exciting events of the day. They had both, certainly,
been through a good deal of agitation. Nina, after the
meeting with her mother, had broken down altogether,
and the doctor, on his arrival, had declared her to be in
a very anxious state. She had never left her mother's

sofa, where she had first been laid. Her whole nervous
system had seemed unstrung, and her physical strength
exhausted. She had got a chill, too, and towards evening
had become feverish and disposed to wander. The doc-
tor's orders that she should be kept perfectly quiet, and
not confused by the sight of different faces, were most a
stringent; and the younger children were to be sent away,
and the house kept as free of noise and bustle as possible.
Under these circumstances Lady Wardlaw had settled
to leave Granton the next morning, taking Mervyn with
her. It was useless in staying, as far as Nina was con-
cerned, since the doctor desired that only one person
should go into her room besides the maid.
Mrs. Middleton had at once declared it her intention
to be that one, and had never left the girl's side since the
doctor's visit. It was not very likely that poor little
Nina would often be conscious enough to notice Mervyn's
absence, so Magdalen-had no scruples about taking him
away. Lady Wardlaw could not help feeling that it was
a providential arrangement that the mother and daughter
should thus be left alone, . and fervently hoped that
anxiety and care on the one side would hereafter draw
forth gratitude on the other, and pave the way to love
and confidence on both. -
Thus suddenly Mervyn's exile came to an end; and
early the next morning he left the scene of his varied ex-
periences, where he had unconsciously and indirectly been
the means of effecting so much.
They went straight to London, where they remained
for some little time. During their stay they had daily
telegrams and letters from Granton, which were on the
whole more cheering than otherwise. Magdalen also had
satisfactory accounts from her husband of the progress of
his affairs in Ireland, and he seemed likely to be able to
## p. 291 (#297) ############################################
AACK A 7" GLA2AW-MER IVYM. 291
get away sooner than he had expected. These letters
were not shared with Mervyn. He had never mentioned
his step-father, nor made any inquiry about him. Whether
it was from perversity, or sheer forgetfulness, Magdalen
could not determine. She knew well Mervyn's power of
putting from him subjects that were disagreeable or pain-
ful, and she feared sometimes that he had really succeeded
in shutting out altogether the fact of Lord Wardlaw's ex-
istence. Had it not been that the boy had gone through
so much lately, she would have questioned him about it;
but he was at times, in spite of their reunion, so cast down
and out of spirits, that she did not like to force unwel-
come topics upon him. He was sometimes filled with
compunction for having left Nina just when she seemed
to need him most ; he never could speak of Totty with-
out tears; and his anxiety over the telegrams and letters
was intense. So she made up her mind to wait till they
got back to Glen-Mervyn before she opened the subject.
As soon as the reports were really hopeful, she settled a
day for leaving London, for she was anxious to get Mervyn
back among his old associations, and to see him recover
his spirits.
They received a satisfactory account from Granton the
day they started on their journey, and Mervyn's spirits
rose accordingly. They rose still higher as he journeyed
on, and got into the familiar country which indicated his
entry into his beloved Wales. Every landmark seemed to
bring him nearer and nearer to his old life, and the troubles
of his recent one grew dimmer every instant. His mother
marked with joy the light of his eye and the animation of
his whole countenance. She really had begun to fear that
he had been cowed and saddened for good in his cousins'
home.
They arrived very late, and he was too tired to do more

than go straight to bed, reflecting on the happiness in store.
He woke the next morning in a perfect transport of delight.
The sight of the old Welsh hills from his bedroom window
made him spring out of bed with a shout, at the thought
that he was really back at Glen-Mervyn. Back at Glen-
Mervyn ! Back among the much-loved scenes and the
familiar surroundings | Back, with his mother at his side,
to be parted from her no more
When he went down-stairs and found her sitting in her
usual place at the breakfast-table, he felt as if he had never
been away, and as if the last three months had been part
of a hideous dream which had disappeared like a ghost at
cock-crow. How delightful it was to revisit all the familiar
scenes with his mother to take her to the gate where they
had parted, and to feel that all was over ! How delightful,
later in the day, to pay a visit with her to the vicarage,
and to feel so independent of Gwen and her tactless
speeches 1 to have no concern with the prim little parlor
and the stuffed birds ! to wander home in the autumn
sunset talking it all over, the words tumbling out unre-
strainedly as of old, instead of having to write and spell
them 1
"Oh, mother l'' he exclaimed, suddenly, "I feel now
just as if I had never been away from you or Glen-Mervyn !"
"Do you, darling?" she answered. "Don't you feel the
least bit different in yourself for all the changes you have
been through?"
"Different?" he said, quickly. "Oh, no! Not the
least. Why should I?"
"Not even in your interests?" she questioned again.
"No, mother." ---
Lady Wardlaw smiled, and slightly shook her head.
"I think I can prove the contrary," she said. "To-
day, certainly, the old familiar surroundings have revived

in you very strongly your old interests. But till now,
since we met, what has been the chief topic of your con-
versation,-your last thought at night, and your first in
the morning P" -
"Oh, Nina's illness," he answered.
"Nina's illness," she repeated; "and Nina altogether,
and poor little Totty, and your Aunt Lydia. In short,
all the Granton affairs. Now, in the old days, used we
to talk so much about them all?"
"No," he answered; "I did not take the same interest
in them."
"Whom did we chiefly talk of and take interest in P"
she asked.
"Ourselves, I suppose," he said, rather unwillingly.
"There is one difference in you, then, you see, already,"
she went on. "Your sympathies are enlarged, and the
range of your existence is widened. We were very happy
together here, no doubt, you and I, but perhaps there
was a danger of our getting selfish; so our isolated happi-
ness was brought to a close, and we were sent out into
the world, to form new interests, and to have our sympa-
thies for others drawn out. Do not for a moment, darling,
suppose that I think you love me less because you love
others more. I know you don't. But I do see a differ-
ence in you, for all the changes you have seen. And it is
a difference I am glad and thankful to see. For I used
to be a little frightened when you talked of 'you and I,'
as if "you and I' were the only two people in the world,
and as if there were no world at all outside Glen-Mervyn.
But now it is different; and I cannot tell you how glad I
am that it should be so."
"But, mother," he objected, "I don't know that it is
so different as you think. Since I have been home, I feel
quite to have forgotten Granton, and to take no interest

in any one or anything outside Glen-Mervyn; I assure you
I don't."
"Ah, Mervyn ! I know you better than you know
yourself. You think so, but I will prove to you that you
are wrong. Now I will make your heart beat and your
eyes sparkle by what I am going to say, and yet it does
not concern me, or you, or Glen-Mervyn."
Mervyn looked up, puzzled and unbelieving.
"Between the trees," she said, quietly, "I see the
telegraph-boy coming along, and"
But Mervyn had shot from her side, like an arrow from
a bow, and was tearing across the field to meet him, before
she could finish her sentence.
She walked on, smiling to herself, and in a little while
he came back breathless and eager, with the telegram in
his hand. It proved very satisfactory. Nina was going
on perfectly well. "We shall get a letter to-morrow,
with fuller accounts," remarked Mervyn, as he walked by
his mother's side, heart and mind full of Nina.
"So you feel no interest in anything outside Glen-
Mervyn P'' she said, presently, finding he continued
silent.
He looked up, smiling brightly. "You are always
right, mother," he said. "Is there a difference in you
too, for the changes you have seen?" he asked, after a few
minutes. "Have you got interests now outside Glen-
Mervyn?"
He put the question rather anxiously, and looked up
into her face. -
"Mervyn," she said, and it was evident she had not
heard what he had said, for her eyes were looking away
over the fields,-" just go and see what the telegraph-boy
is coming to the house for. Does he want to be paid, or
what?'"
## p. 295 (#301) ############################################
BACK AT GLEM-MER IVYN. 295
Mervyn went off, and came back running, with another
telegram in his hand. -
"There were two," he said. "The boy says I ran off
so quick, he had not time to tell me."
He handed it to his mother, and watched her while she
read it. Somehow, the autumn sunshine seemed to him
less bright, and the decaying leaves less golden.
She gave him the paper when she had read it.
"I must answer this by telegram," she said, "so I am
going in for a moment. I shall not be long."
Her eyes were shining with that new expression that he
had noticed once or twice since their reunion, and a
happy smile played about her mouth. And that was all
the answer he ever got to his question, as to whether she
had interests outside Glen-Mervyn. 
Very slowly he followed her towards the house, reading
the telegram that told him Lord Wardlaw was coming.
Magdalen, when she joined him on the terrace, saw how
it was. She felt she had perhaps been unwise in avoiding
the subject till now. But then she had not expected her
husband so soon. -- -
They were standing, she and Mervyn, outside the bow-
window, where she had broken the news to him. She felt
emboldened by the memory of that conversation, and the
complete conquest she had achieved. -
"Mervyn," she said, putting her hand on his shoulder,
"do you remember our conversation here that summer
night?" -
"Yes, mother."
But the answer came in rather a bored tone of voice.
"Have you often thought it over since?"
"No, mother."
Magdalen glanced at him quickly, and a shadow passed
over her face.
## p. 296 (#302) ############################################
296 THROWN 7'OGETHER.
"You don't mean to say you still put the subject from
you, Mervyn, after all these months?"
Mervyn nodded. -
"I was half afraid of this, from your letters. It is a
fatal habit of yours, Mervyn. I am grievously disap-
pointed."
Mervyn hung his head, without answering.
"This cannot go on," she said, very firmly. "The
sooner you turn your thoughts to the subject, the better;
for you see he is coming to-morrow."
"Who?" said Mervyn, perversely.
She hesitated a minute, and then said, "Your father."
"My father/" echoed Mervyn, his face crimsoning.
"Your step-father, then," she said; and there was
something like impatience in her tone; " or Charlie, or
whatever you like to call my husband."
And Magdalen turned her head away, and pressed her
hands together to control herself. She was surprised at
the difficulty she felt in restraining her indignation. She
wondered how far her patience and forbearance would
endure, if Mervyn was going to put them to the test again.
She realized that she was not so fit to bear with him now
as she had been on a former occasion. She wondered
why, and probed her heart and conscience to find an
answer. Conscience had no answer to make, but her full
heart gave it directly. -
Ah! it was all very well to be patient and to make
allowances when it was a question of an abstract Lord
Wardlaw, a man towards whom, in her then puzzled state
of mind, she had had no definite feeling, beyond the wish
to repair an act of injustice.
But now ! Now what was it? It was a question of the
husband she loved with all her heart and soul; the man
who in a few short months had flooded her life with sun-
## p. 297 (#303) ############################################
AACK A 7" GLAAV-MER VMAV. 297
shine, and brought back to her the grace and glory of
her youth; who had radiated her present and her future
with a light her past had never known; and had caused
the trials and disappointments of the morning of her life
to be lost in the full completeness of her noon-tide happi-
ness | And Magdalen was troubled at the thought.
"Am I getting selfish?" she asked herself. "Happi-
ness ought not to make me less able to think of and feel
for others. Can my new life be bad for me?"
But she knew it was not so. She knew that he who
had restored to her the ideal and the illusions of her girl-
hood had done not only that, but infinitely more. He
had also restored to her her faith in human nature, and
her belief in human goodness, by bringing before her a
living picture of what natural goodness can be, exalted by
time and trial; and the contact with such a character had
elevated her also, had implanted in her new aspirations,
and stimulated her to fresh efforts.
Even dwelling in thought on the beauty of his character
gave her strength now, and she felt it would teach her to
forbear.
His patience with his step-son would, she knew, be
inexhaustible; so hers must not fail. Besides, it was so
foolish to have fears. Did she not know that he would
win the boy over directly? Was it likely a loving nature
like Mervyn's could resist him? Then why allow herself
to be hurt and vexed by a mere prejudice on the boy's
part P Why not wait on quietly, certain that all would
be well?
So, turning to Mervyn with her usual gentle smile, she
said, "Call him what you like, darling. The time will
come when you will be glad to call him father, and till
then I will wait."

CH A P T E R XXIV.
MEETING OF LORD WARDLAW AND MERWYN LYNDSAY.
THE next morning's letter about Nina was as satisfac-
tory as possible. The worst was over, and she had now
only to get up her strength.
"I wish she could come here," said Mervyn; "she
would be so happy with us, mother."
"I hope she will come when she is well enough,"
Lady Wardlaw answered ; "but I sometimes doubt if
your Aunt Lydia will ever make up her mind to part with
her.''
A short conversation on the subject ensued; and then
Mervyn got ready to go, as usual, to his studies at the
vicarage. As he sped along through the autumn woods,
his thoughts were given to any and every subject but
the impending arrival. It had completely escaped his
memory. He received a warm welcome from the vicar,
who did not conceal his pleasure at having him to teach
again.
Studies over, Mervyn had a long talk with him on
divers events that had occurred during his absence from
Glen-Mervyn, and found so much to say that he stayed
chatting till half-past five.
"Why, I quite forgot I was not living here," he said,
laughing. "I must be running home to give mother her
tea."
As he went along, he mused on the pleasure of having
his mother to take care of again; of feeling that the
house contained her; that she was there, safe and sound.
## p. 299 (#305) ############################################
LOA'D WARDLA W AAWD MER VVM. 299
He thought of that sad day when he visited the deserted
terrace and looked up at the empty house; and the over-
whelming delight of hurrying home to her made him
almost wish to revive the old feeling of desolation, that
he might enjoy the present even more. So it came into
his head, when he got to the stables, to go round, as he
had done on the former occasion, and look at the house
from the garden.
It was dusk when he got there; but from the drawing-
room window came a blaze of warm light, which shone
out into the darkness. The heart of the child beat high
as he thought of his mother sitting in the fire-light, wait-
ing for him to return. Clinging to the branch of an old
tree, which showered down golden leaves under the im-
petus he gave to it, he swung himself up and peeped in
at the window, his eager eyes searching for the beloved
figure in its accustomed place. There was a long pause
and a long silence. Every distant sound was audible in
the stillness that prevailed : the barking of distant dogs,
the lowing of distant cattle, and the distant voices of
peasants as they wended their way home. But no nearer
sound was audible.
An old white owl, who had been disturbed in her seat
on the tree by the sudden bending of the branches, peered
down upon the little figure from an upper branch, as if
wondering what that was that sat so very still. The silence
was broken at last by a low sob and the half-whispered
words, "She doesn't want me; I needn't have hurried
home to give her her tea."
There was a rustle among the branches, another shower
of golden leaves from the tree, as the little watcher
dropped from his seat and stole away in the gathering
darkness.
The white owl, startled again and somewhat rudely

shaken from her perch, fluttered down upon the branch
he had left, and became a spectator of what had scared
the child away.
The fire was burning brightly, lighting up all the corners
of the room. It played upon the tea-equipage, revealing
that the cups were empty, and the repast concluded.
Magdalen was sitting in a low arm-chair, looking up to,
and in deep conversation with, a tall, fair man, who stood
on the hearth-rug, with his back to the fire, looking down
upon her as she sat.
The tell-tale firelight showed how intense was the
interest of the conversation, how happy were the faces of
the two as they talked. This was the scene which had
sent Mervyn rushing to his own little bedroom, instead
of going straight to his mother, as usual.
Half an hour afterwards, Lady Wardlaw, getting uneasy
at his absence, went in search of him, and, finding his
door locked, gently forced an entrance, and drew his
story from him. By that time he had grown tired of his
own society, and was ready to be consoled by her sooth- .
ing kisses, and her assurances that he was very much
wanted indeed, and that both she and Lord Wardlaw had
been expecting him every moment, and wondering what
could have become of him.
"Now, darling," she said, gently, but very firmly,
"brush your hair and run down. You will find Charlie
anxiously expecting you."
"Ain't you coming, mother?" said Mervyn, rather
blankly.
"No, dear," she answered, quietly ; "I am going to
dress. We dine earlier to-night. Why, Mervyn, you are
not going to persuade yourself you are shy 1"
Mervyn laughed a little at the idea of being shy; and
Magdalen, anxious to keep him in a cheerful vein, talked

on to him gayly all the time he was washing his hands and
brushing his hair. She was quite sure he and Lord Ward-
law would get on better without her, and had made up
her mind to leave them to themselves at first. She knew
well the boy's sociable and genial disposition, and felt he
would make friends directly.
"But you will come down soon, mother ?" he said, as
he kissed her and ran off.
As he passed through the hall, on his way to the draw-
ing-room, his eye fell on a gun-case, lying there with
other packages. Attracted by the sight, he stopped short,
and his eye sparkled.
"A breech-loader, I shouldn't wonder l'' he exclaimed.
He knelt down, undid the case, and examined the gun
eagerly.
"I say, what a jolly one! I wish I had a breech-loader
I wonder if I could carry this."
He took it out carefully, lifted it on to his shoulder,
and tried to rise to his feet, gun and all. It was very
heavy, and he nearly toppled over. In trying to recover
his balance, the gun fell from his shoulder, and came down
with a crash on the marble floor.
The drawing-room door opened hastily, and Lord
Wardlaw came out.
"Oh, I say, I'm so awfully sorry!" exclaimed Mervyn,
running up to him, and holding out his hands; "I hope
it is not hurt."
And he looked eagerly up into his step-father's face,
with flushed cheeks and glowing eyes.
Lord Wardlaw took both the boy's hands in his, and
returned the gaze with interest. His eyes never turned
towards the gun: they were riveted on the boy's face, and
he made no answer.
The past came rushing before him as he gazed. The
26

likeness of feature and coloring, the strange, indescribable
resemblance of voice and manner, the expression in the
eyes, took him back years and years, and he seemed to be
looking on the bright face of Magdalen Middleton as it
had appeared the first time he had seen her.
It reminded him so forcibly of that first meeting, riding
in the Park, when, a few minutes after their introduction,
his horse had fallen on its knees, and, as it recovered
itself, she had turned to him, saying, "I hope it is not
hurt 1."
It was the very same face, the very same manner, the
very same words. He felt himself carried straight back
to that day, and, as in a dream, he was about to answer as
he had done then, when with sudden bitterness came the
memory of another figure in that tableau, a figure riding
on her other side. He seemed to see again the sardonic
smile, and to hear the sarcastic remark on his horseman-
ship, and to feel the throb of furious anger mingled with
the sense of triumph as he marked the indignation in
Magdalen's face.
Then, when he thought how the child before him was
that man's son, the man who had spoiled his youth, and
embittered his early manhood; who had acted to him the
part of a traitor under the guise of a benefactor, and been
to him a very Judas, -he dropped the boy's hands, and
turned away without a word.
So curious are the sudden changes and phases of feeling !
He had not given his thoughts hitherto at all to this meet-
ing, and now it overpowered him. Mervyn, on the other
hand, who had dreaded and shrank from it, was com-
pletely absorbed in the gun, and perhaps only looked
upon his step-father in the light of the breech-loader's
owner. He was afraid, from Lord Wardlaw's manner,
that he was angry, and, taking hold of his hand again,
## p. 303 (#309) ############################################
A.O.R.D WARD/LA W AAWD MEA' WYAV. 303
he said, "I know I ought not to have touched it, but it
was so tempting."
Lord Wardlaw put his disengaged hand over his eyes,
and tried to clear away the past and return to the present.
The sublime and the ridiculous are ever ready to meet
and mingle, and his sense of humor suddenly showed him
the construction that might be put upon his behavior by
the boy in this, the beginning of their acquaintance,
namely, that he was a harsh and unforgiving step-father, -
an old ogre, in fact. It struck him as so ridiculous that
he should play a part so foreign to his nature, that he
laughed, and with that laugh the mist of bygone years
cleared away.
"Never mind the gun, my dear boy," he said; "I
dare say there is no harm done."
"Oh, but do let me see l'" said Mervyn, eagerly, and
greatly relieved: "it would be such a pity. A magnificent
breech-loader like that. Please look '''
Smiling at his eagerness, Lord Wardlaw knelt down,
and examined the gun carefully, Mervyn sitting on the
top of the packing-case looking on.
"Not injured a bit," he said, after a pause. "How did
it happen?"
"I was trying to see if it was too heavy for me," he
answered, frankly, "and I lost my balance. I do so
want a breech-loader," he went on. "Are they ever made
light enough for boys of my age?"
"To be sure," said Lord Wardlaw; "and you certainly
ought to have one. Can you shoot a hare yet?"
Mervyn launched at once into an account of his per-
formances, and Lord Wardlaw listened attentively at first;
but the voice and manner made him dreamy again after a
time, and he caught himself listening more to them than
to what the boy was actually saying. Mervyn brought

him up short by proposing to take the gun into the
drawing-room, that he might look at it in the light, and
try to understand it. -
Lord Wardlaw assented, but not readily. He would
...have preferred remaining in the darkened hall, listening
to the voice so full of association; and he was perhaps a
little dreading the sight of the boy in the full glare of the
lighted room, lest his eyes should detect in him some
faint likeness to his father, and so destroy the favorable
impression the child was making on him. Detecting in
him every moment, as he talked, traces of Magdalen's sen-
timents, tastes, and opinions, he was beginning to feel the
boy would become very dear to him, and he wanted to
forget everything that might produce a contrary feeling.
However, he rose, and did as Mervyn requested,carried
the gun into the drawing-room, and laid it on the hearth-
rug. Then he cast an anxious look at his step-son. But he
was reassured when his eye fell on the graceful figure and
beaming face. There was no sort of likeness to any one but
Magdalen, and Lord Wardlaw drew a long breath of relief.
Standing on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire,
he looked down admiringly upon Mervyn bending over
the gun, and went on talking.
"Do you understand it now?" he asked, after a brief
explanation.
"Quite," answered Mervyn; "and, oh, how I wish I
had one ! I say, how tall you are l'' he exclaimed, sud-
denly looking up, and measuring with his eye the figure
before him. "You must be taller than Uncle Rowley.
What is your height?"
"Six foot two," answered Lord Wardlaw, smiling.
"Oh, he is only six foot, so you are two inches taller
than him. I hope I shall be as tall as you. Mother is
five foot seven," he added, proudly.
## p. 305 (#311) ############################################
LORD WARDIA W AMD MER VPN. 305
Lord Wardlaw was dreaming again, and answered,
absently, "Five foot seven . That is not much of a
height." *
"Not much of a height !" exclaimed Mervyn, indig-
nantly; "why, it is a perfect height for a lady."
"A lady? Oh, yes. I beg your pardon. I thought
you were speaking of a man. I agree with you that five
foot seven is a charming height. What lady were you
speaking of?"
"Mother," answered Mervyn, his voice and manner
softening.
"Whose mother?" asked Lord Wardlaw, absently.
"Mine," answered Mervyn, in his firm tone of proud
appropriation. -
Lord Wardlaw still looked a little at sea, but, suddenly
recollecting himself, he said, "A perfect height; yes, I
did not understand you were speaking of Magdalen."
Lord Wardlaw's voice softened too, as he pronounced
his wife's name, and Mervyn looked up sharply. For
there was in the tone the same ring of proud appropria-
tion that had just sounded in his own. It might have
been its echo. -
And at that moment she entered, dressed for dinner.
Lord Wardlaw advanced and put a chair for her, uncon-
sciously coming up against Mervyn, who was in the act
of doing the same thing. All three laughed; but Mer-
vyn's smile died away soonest, and he brushed past Lord
Wardlaw, and went and stood by his mother rather de-
fiantly. His attitude expressed what the tone of his
voice had declared before, that he considered her his
exclusive possession, and wished to make patent his
right of monopoly.
"You must go up and dress, darling," she said, gently.
"Dinner will be early to-night." *.

Mervyn went off directly, and Lord Wardlaw prepared
to follow.
"Well, Charlie?" said his wife, questioningly, and
rather anxiously.
"We made friends over a breech-loader," he answered,
smiling, as he passed her. Left alone in the drawing-
room, by the flickering fire, Magdalen sank into a fit of
meditation. She wondered a little what had brought
that peculiar look into her husband's eye, and why her
entrance should so have changed the expression of Mer-
vyn's face. He looked happy and friendly when she had
first caught sight of him as she opened the door. She
suspected the truth very soon. She saw that it had been
hard for her husband to meet Mr. Lyndsay's son, and
she feared it had revived some old feelings of bitterness.
She saw that Mervyn would love and enjoy his step-father
except in so far as she was concerned; be perfect friends
apart from her, but feel differently in her presence. That
little contretemps about the chair gave her an idea of how
matters would be. Mervyn, accustomed to care for her
and monopolize her entirely, would resent Lord Ward-
law's interference, and she sighed as she wondered how it
would all go on. From that she fell to thinking what a
curious position theirs was. How curious it all was
What a curious thing life was . What an odd history
hers had been . How strange it was that Charlie Digby
should be, by a curious chain of circumstances, master,
as it were, in Mr. Lyndsay's home ! On what a different
scene had the walls of this room once looked down | As
she thought of that dreary time, so long ago, she wondered
how she ever could have borne it. What a life for a girl
to lead It was dangerous to turn her thoughts that way,
and to think that while she was living out day by day
that dreary, monotonous routine, incarcerated in a living

A. O.R.D - WAA'D/A PV AAWD MERP WAV. 307
tomb, Charlie had been living out his in exile, fretting
and chafing against her, against fate, against Providence,
even; thinking her worldly, mercenary, faithless; and that
all the while they might have been living happily together.
She knew he was thinking the same to-night: she had
seen it in his eyes. And as she thought it over, she could
not help wondering why it had all been allowed. It was
not as if he had been situated like most men, who, when
disappointed like him, can divert their thoughts by
change and amusement, and seek a new object of affec-
tion. For his life in the out-of-the-way foreign courts to
which it had throughout been his fate to be appointed,
had offered no distraction to him. No English face had
crossed his path, to put hers out of his head. So there
had been nothing to prevent the full force of early dis-
appointment falling upon him and being a sore trial.
Why should he have been tried like this? What had he
done that he should have had his youth marred and spoiled
in this way?
She was puzzled, till she began to meditate on a subject
of which she never tired,the beauty of her husband's
character; and then she began to understand a little.
For she could not but tell herself that it was that early
trial that had helped to make it what it now was. Though
it was the same character which had at first attracted
her to him, she could not but own that it was ennobled
and matured under the influence of time and trial. It
might have been that, in a spirit so light and happy,
something of depth and earnestness had been wanting,
and God, by giving him the trial, had developed the want
and supplied it. And the result was a character at once
rare and beautiful. For he was not, as many would have
been under the like circumstances, a soured, embittered
man. Far from it. He had borne his life bravely, and

retained through it all a natural sweetness of temper and
power of enjoyment; the freshness, in short, and the
charm of youth; an almost boylike zest and keenness in
both his amusements and his occupations.
Still, his character bore ineffaceable marks of his early
disappointment, giving the man strength, and depth, and
reality.
"So it has been for the best, after all," she said, half
out loud ; and as she spoke he came into the room.
"Charlie," she said, softly.
He came up smiling, but she detected through the
smile the same expression she had noticed before. He
stationed himself on the hearth-rug, and looked all round
the room, taking in its minutest details; and then his eye
met hers. She saw she was right in supposing that his
thoughts had followed the same train as her own; and a
few questions drew the truth from him.
"Life is difficult to understand, Charlie, isn't it P" she
said, rather wistfully.
"Difficult," he answered, "but not impossible."
The wistful look left her face at the firm answer, and
was succeeded by one of loving admiration. Mervyn's
entrance prevented further conversation, and soon after the
gong sounded.
Dinner passed off pleasantly. Lord Wardlaw gave an
account of some of his Fenian adventures, and Mervyn
was a delighted and interested listener. The conversation
branched off to shooting, cricket, and other subjects of a
like nature. Charlie and Mervyn talked eagerly, and
Magdalen listened, which she was well content to do.
Leaning back in her chair and watching the two she loved
so dearly rapidly progressing in intimacy, her doubts and
fears vanished, and Hope told her that all would be well.

THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE NEW MENAGE.
HoPE, however, told a flattering tale. That first even-
ing was a very fair type of what followed.
Attracted, in spite of himself, to Lord Wardlaw, Mer-
vyn soon grew very fond of him, in so far as he himself
was concerned, and took great delight in his society. He
found him a most charming companion, as keen and eager
as he was himself, and just as capable of enjoyment.
Mervyn had never had so much shooting, or so many
holidays, in his life, as he got in the first three weeks after
his step-father's arrival. Lord Wardlaw had given him a
breech-loader, and was always planning out days of fun
for him in which to use it. He was kindness itself to the
boy, and no doubt Mervyn's life was really the happier
for the change.
Formerly there had certainlythough he had never
found it outbeen a want in his life of a companion with
kindred tastes and pursuits. His mother's interest and
sympathy in all his pleasures, keen as they had always
been, were necessarily, as he grew older, a little forced,
a little those of a looker-on. She could enjoy them for
his sake, but she could not always join in them. But here
was one ever ready to share in them, and with the same
zest and unflagging zeal as himself.
Lord Wardlaw, on his side, soon got over the feel-
ings his first introduction to his step-son had temporarily
awakened, and daily found in him some new quality to
love and admire.
So far all went well. But the moment Lord Wardlaw

in any way came between the boy and his mother, the
moment he interfered in the slightest degree with what
Mervyn considered his exclusive rights, that moment all
was changed.
It might be only that he handed her her tea; that he
mounted her on her horse; that he brought her a flower
from the conservatory for her hair: it was enough to set
the boy's blood boiling with indignation, and to make
him at once assume an attitude of defiant appropriation.
He had always had a monopoly of her, and he could not
understand another interfering with it. He would in-
stantly assert his rights, and show that he considered he
had the first claim upon her.
Lord Wardlaw was very kind about it, but he could
not always give way; neither did Magdalen desire it. In
fact, she rather discouraged her husband's humoring
Mervyn, as he was inclined to do at first, for she thought
it was bad for the boy.
Mervyn soon became aware that any such displays on
his part, accompanied as they generally were by flushing
cheeks and other demonstrations of anger, were not pleas-
ing to his mother; but this, instead of affecting him in a
right way, only made him all the more angry with Lord
Wardlaw. He would have hated any one who caused
that look of sorrowful displeasure to come into her eyes.
One day they were all three walking in the direction
of the gate where Mervyn and his mother had parted.
Mervyn, who was a little way on in front, bounded over
it. Lord Wardlaw followed his example, and then turned
to assist his wife.
Magdalen, in getting over it, got her foot entangled in
her gown; and if Lord Wardlaw had not been close at
hand, she must have fallen.
Mervyn, looking hastily around, took in the position

of affairs, and was provoked with himself for not having
been as attentive as his step-father.
"It is an awkward gate for a lady," said Lord Ward-
law. "I think a step might be put on each side of the
third bar, to make it easier to climb. Don't you,
Magdalen?"
"I think it would be a very good plan," she answered,
"and very easily done."
"It had better be done at once, then," said her hus-
band, "as we so often come this way. I will speak
about it."
A sudden insane feeling of dislike to Lord Wardlaw's
interference came over Mervyn.
"It's always been like that," he said, quickly; "it
does very well."
Lord and Lady Wardlaw both looked round in surprise.
"My dear boy," said the former, "it doesn't do at all
well if your mother falls over it."
"She never fell over it before," said Mervyn, hardly
knowing what he was saying. "It must have been
your"
"Your fault," he was going to say; but a look in his
mother's eyes, of astonishment mixed with displeasure,
stopped him.
She walked on, talking quietly to her husband, and
Mervyn was left behind, not knowing whether to follow
them or not. Hot tears blinded his eyes as he got over
the gate again and went back into the wood.
"How dare he l'' he muttered, as he slowly retraced
his steps homewards; "how dare he interfere! He shan't
put a step on the gate 1 I won't have it done ! The
gate's not his. It's mother's and mine. Why should he

His chest heaved as he thought of the glance he had
received from his mother. "How dare he " he muttered
again, passionately, clinching his hands; "how dare he
make her angry with me! She was never angry with me
till he came."
He did not go home till he had recovered himself a
little. No notice was taken. His step-father treated him
exactly as if nothing had happened ; only in his mother's
eyes he thought he saw the same grave shadow, and it
made him miserable.
A fresh turn, however, was given to his thoughts by
his mother's announcement that Mrs. Middleton had
written to say Nina would come to Glen-Mervyn in a few
days.
For the next day or two he was full of plans for her
comfort and enjoyment. His mother saw the change
with pleasure, and greatly hoped that Nina's presence
would divert the boy's thoughts from herself, by giving
him a fresh object of love and care.
On the morning of her expected arrival, Mervyn, be-
fore starting for the vicarage, went out to superintend a
little garden he was having arranged for his cousin, close
to his own. She was to divide her journey in two, so
she would be at Glen-Mervyn about the middle of the
day. He had got leave from his mother to come away
from the vicarage two hours earlier than usual, so that he
might be at home to meet her.
The arrangements in the little garden completed, he
returned to the house to wish his mother good-by be-
fore starting. It occurred to him, on the way, to get a
bunch of violets for her; and, hastening into the break-
fast-room, he ran up to her and presented them. She was
in the act of receiving them with a smile, when Lord
Wardlaw came in, with the very ditto of Mervyn's gift
## p. 313 (#319) ############################################
DIFFICULTIES OF THE MEW MENAGE. 313
in his hand; and advancing, without perceiving what was
going on, he held them out to his wife. Magdalen looked
from one to the other, puzzled and smiling. Mervyn
flushed crimson, and was in the act of pushing back his
step-father's gift, when his mother stopped him with a
look he well understood.
"Oh, never mind," said Lord Wardlaw, kindly ; "I
did not see Mervyn had brought you some. I'll put mine
in the drawing-room." And he walked off, whistling.
Mervyn stood in front of his mother, with downcast
eyes, his violets in his hand. She did not offer to take
them. He heard her sigh, and, raising his head, he burst
out, passionately,
"Why does he always interfere? It's not my fault "
Lady Wardlaw made no answer, but moved away to
the window, and stood there looking out.
"Mother," pleaded Mervyn, following her, and hold-
ing out his violets, "please take them."
"No, dear," she answered, gently, but very firmly ; "I
cannot take them now."
"Why not?" burst out Mervyn.
"They would give me no pleasure," she answered ;
"they would only remind me that my boy's gift was only
what I fear his affection for me is fast becoming."
"What?" asked Mervyn, hotly, anxious and yet fearful
to hear the end of the sentence.
"Selfish," she answered, sadly; "utterly and entirely
selfish."
"I can't help it!" cried Mervyn; "it is all his fault.
I was never like this before."
"You were never tried," she answered, quietly. "Life
is easy enough while there are no trials or temptations.
The battle is no battle where there are no foes to contend
with. True soldiery in life's warfare consists in living in

the thick of the fight and contending with the enemies
that surround you."
"Then you do call him my enemy?" said Mervyn,
hardly knowing what he was saying.
"You know very well that I did not mean that," said
his mother. And in all his life he had never seen her
look so stern.
It maddened him. That his mother should speak and
look so, made him beside himself. He could not trust
himself to stay. His anger against his step-father, who
was the cause of these unwonted discussions between him
and his mother, rose too high in his heart, and he rushed
out of the room. In this mood he started for the vicar-
age, the incident having driven all thoughts of Nina out
of his head. Injured and moody, smarting under his
imaginary wrongs, he walked along slowly and listlessly,
as unlike his eager, bounding self as possible.
The vicar noticed he was absent and inattentive, but
he asked no questions. He had seen Mervyn thus once
or twice lately, and guessed a little at the reason. He
set him free at the hour his mother had named, and
walked a little way with him; but he found him so silent
and gloomy that he thought it best to leave him, and
turned off half-way to visit some of his poor people.
Left to himself, Mervyn walked slowly on. He was
thoroughly wretched and uncomfortable, angry with him-
self and displeased with everybody else. He dawdled
along, anxious to delay, as long as possible, his return
home. He reached the gate, and was getting absently
over it, when his foot struck against some unwonted
obstruction.
"What in the world is it?" he said to himself. And
he stooped down to see.
The ledge lthe step Lord Wardlaw had spoken of 1

DIFFICULTIES of THE MEW MEMAGE, 315
the step he, in his wrath, had declared should never be
Tput on. His smouldering anger burst out.
"How dare he l'' he exclaimed. "How dare he touch
our gates and interfere with our concerns ! I won't have
it ! Let him go and put steps on his own Fenian gates,
and leave ours alone. I said I would take it off if he
dared to put it on. And so I will I''
With all the strength of passion, the boy kicked at the
ledge with the heels of his boots, first on one side and
then on the other. When he had loosened it a little, he
took out his pocket-knife, and, with an energy and a
perseverance worthy of a better cause, dug out the nails
one by one. Then, standing on the bar of the gate, he
stamped upon the ledge with all his force, and drove it
from its place. It was easy after that to pull it off and
to throw it away; and then he drew a long breath and
turned homewards.
Meanwhile Nina had arrived, and was sitting by the
fire in the drawing-room, patiently awaiting his return.
Outwardly patient, at least; but it would have been diffi-
cult for any one to guess, from her calm exterior, how
tumultuously her heart was beating at the thoughts of
seeing Mervyn again. -
A hundred recollections were rushing over her as she
sat there with her hands folded, gazing into the fire.
Thoughts of their life together, of the help he had been
to her, of the good he had unconsciously done her.
Absence, memory, and illness had intensified her feeling
for him, and she had grown to look upon him as a sort of
angel-messenger of peace and goodness, who had played
the part of a guiding-star in her life, leading her on, by
the light of a bright example, to higher and holier things.
He reminded her of so much ; he was so interwoven with
every scene of the sacred past. He would be forever so

closely associated in her mind with her little dead brother,
and with the memories she held so sadly dear. When
she had, shrinking, heard Totty's death-warrant sounded
in her ears, it was Mervyn who had soothed and sup-
ported her. In that terrible struggle on the night of
the storm, it was the thought of him, and the sound
of his voice, that had calmed her and brought her to a
better state of feeling. When she woke the morning
after her little brother's death, she had found Mervyn
watching over her, striving in his unselfishness to hide
his own great joy in his pity for her sorrow. It was he
who had been instrumental in softening her heart towards
her mother; and his hand it was that had led her to her
mother and put an end to their estrangement.
So sat and pondered the pale-faced child by the fire,
her heart swelling with love and admiration; while the
object of her meditation, with eyes inflamed with passion,
was hacking away at the gate
Lady Wardlaw's motherly heart had ached when the
girl had first arrived, to see what a change her illness
had made. Nina was so pale and thin, so quiet and sub-
dued. She had felt it quite difficult to identify her with
the child who, with glittering eyes and crimson cheeks,
had addressed her so passionately. She took her up-stairs
at first, to take off her things, and tried to persuade her
to lie down and rest; but Nina, with an animation which
she had not yet shown, entreated so earnestly to be allowed
to come to the drawing-room, so as to catch the first
glimpse of Mervyn on his return, that Magdalen brought
her down again, and established her by the fire. She
tried, as they waited, to engage her in conversation; but
Nina's eyes wandered every moment to the door, and she
seemed to be listening to every sound.
The door opened rather suddenly after a time, and the

girl started and got crimson. But it was only Lord
Wardlaw.
"Mervyn is late," he said; "he ought to be here by
this time. I suppose you are too tired to come and meet
him, Nina P. It is a most lovely afternoon."
Nina looked so unfeignedly delighted at the idea, that
Magdalen had not the heart to demur, and sent for her
things. Lord Wardlaw wrapped her up carefully, and
promised, laughing, to carry her if she was tired. -
"This fine mountain air will soon put a color into
your little pale face," he said, kindly, as he opened the
hall-door. They stepped out into the autumn sunset;
and Nina's eyes rested with a feeling she could not define
on the grand old mountains, and the richly-wooded
country, lying under the warm glow of the setting sun.
They strolled on among the golden lights and the red-
brown leaves; Lord Wardlaw talking pleasantly, without
obliging her to answer. She was thinking how happy
and how peaceful it all seemed ; what a wild and beauti-
ful home Mervyn's was ; and how happy he must be.
When they got to a certain point, from which the path
through the woods to the gate could be seen for a very
long way, Lord Wardlaw spread a plaid on a heap of dead
leaves, and made Nina sit down.
"That is the way he will come," he said, as he seated
himself by her side; "so we will see him for a long time
before he gets up to us."
They did not have to wait very long. At the end
of the long vista a figure presently appeared in the shadow,
and emerged gradually into the light. Nina's face flushed
all over as Mervyn came in sight, and her beautiful eyes
glowed and deepened. They filled with tears too, even
while a smile of infinite pleasure illumined her face. The
yearning look which she fixed upon him as he came along

surprised and touched Lord Wardlaw. He had had no
idea the children were so fond of each other.
"He doesn't hurry himself," he observed; "I never
knew Mervyn walk so slow. The fact is, he doesn't see
us yet. He won't catch sight of you at first, as I think
I hide you a little by sitting on this side. Why, how
languidly the boy is coming ! He generally bounds
along."
Nina's heart beat quickly as she watched the graceful
figure approach; while, with something of her old charac-
teristics, she felt half inclined to run away and hide
herself. -
Mervyn, when he did at last catch sight of his step-
father, stopped short, and blushed scarlet. He did not
see who was sitting on the other side, and took it for
granted it must be his mother. He was seized with a
feeling of guilty shame, at the thought of what he had
just done. He had hardly realized, till that moment,
how wrongly he had been acting; but now conscience
told him how much he would dread his mother going on
to the gate and viewing the havoc he had made.
Suddenly, he recognized Nina; and the little figure in
its deep mourning, the pale face bearing upon it the traces
of sickness and sorrow, sent all other thoughts straight
out of his head, and transported him back to past scenes.
He is at Granton again, in the chilling atmosphere of that
cold, loveless home. Contrasting sharply with the warmth
and the love by which he is surrounded, comes the recol-
lection of the loneliness, the isolation, the terrible depres-
sion; of evenings of sadness in the sombre school-room,
before he had found in Nina a friend and a comforter; of
the terrible longing for his mother, and for the love and
the sympathy that had always been his.
The sight of the calm little face which had been such
## p. 319 (#325) ############################################
DIFFICULTIES of THE MEW MEAAGE. 319
a refuge to him in all that sad time, brought a burst of
love and gratitude to his heart; brought thoughts of the
companionship, and the ever-ready sympathy, which had
helped to reconcile him to his separation from his
mother; followed quickly by feelings of pity and tender-
ness at the memory of the closing scenes of his visit, her
terrible trial, and her illness, and his own compunction
at having had to leave her in sickness and in sorrow, just
as she seemed to need him most.
He stopped short for a minute as all this rushed over
him ; and then, in his old, impetuous way, he dashed for-
ward, calling out, as he ran, "Nina | Nina ''
Nina started from her seat, and went eagerly to meet
him, all her shyness having fled at the first sound of his
voice. 
Lord Wardlaw felt a little nervous as he saw the im-
petuous advance, fearing his step-son had forgotten how
weak and delicate Nina was. He held himself in readi-
ness to protect her, in case she should be knocked over,
little knowing that the noisy greeting and boisterous em-
braces were the best medicines the poor child could
have. But when, the meeting over, the children, with
arms entwined, and happy faces, came walking towards
him, their heads close together, in deep and eager con-
versation, he realized that there was no occasion for his
presence, and no need for his help, and, smiling, left them
together, and went home to tell the story to his wife.

THE SHOT IN THE WOODS.
LADY WARDLAw noticed a change in Mervyn that even-
ing, and a change which she was glad to see. He was
rather quiet and thoughtful ; he did not force his atten-
tions on his mother, and he was particularly nice and affec-
tionate to Lord Wardlaw. She thought some part of the
change arose from having his little cousin to care for and
attend to.
But it was not only that. Nina had brought with her
such an atmosphere of Granton, that Mervyn's own home
by contrast seemed to him an earthly paradise; and he
found himself constantly comparing Lord Wardlaw with
Colonel Middleton, and wondering that he had never con-
sidered before what a much kinder and nicer father one
was than the other.
Nina did not talk much. Her eyes, Lady Wardlaw
noticed, were seldom off Mervyn, and they followed his
every movement with an evident love and delight. Mag-
dalen fancied a day spent alone with her cousin would be
a satisfaction to the girl and make her feel more at home.
So she proposed to Lord Wardlaw that they should ride
the next day to a neighbor's house at a great distance, and
have luncheon, leaving Mervyn in charge of Nina at home.
A holiday was to be given him for the purpose; and the
arrangement gave satisfaction to all parties. So all the
next day the two children were alone, as in the old days.
Bit by bit, Nina told Mervyn of all the changes at
home ; of the happy state of things between her and her
mother; and of how different it all was now. She was

getting quite fond of the baby, she said, and Edmund had
become such a nice little boy. Cecily, too, had grown
so much more sensible, and used to sit in her room quite
quiet, and get her anything she wanted.
Mademoiselle, who had come back, was so nice now
that she didn't mind the least asking her about her head-
aches, and really wanted to hear the answer.
"When I was getting well, Mervyn," she said, softly,
" and had so much time to lie still and think, I used to
go over all the things you and I used to talk about. I
made up my mind then that I would do what you asked
me, and try to do what I used to call my impossible things.
You remember what they were. Do you know I found it
all so much easier than I expected, that I begin to think
it was all my fancy before, or else my fault P And, Mer-
vyn," she added, in a whisper, "I don't think you will
have to say again that you think I shall never understand
about the love of God, because I don't love my mother,
and that so you don't see how I am ever to learn. All
that is quite different now. I am beginning to understand
it in the same way that you said you did. She had a head-
ache one day, from sitting up with me at night, and I did
your cure, and I am always going to take care of her now
when she is ill. And, Mervyn, do you remember telling
me I loved so very few P. Well, I don't think that is the
case now. Every day I love them all more, and that
makes everything so different. You first made me think
how pleasant it would be to love everybody, and how much
easier it would make everything. And it does make me so
much happier. If I were to hear that sermon again about
happy homes, and the love of parents and children,
brothers and sisters, I should understand it much better
now. I feel it is all owing to you, Mervyn. For if you
had never come to Granton, I should never have known

what being loving and kind meant. You were always nice
and affectionate and attentive to every one, and made
every one love you wherever you went. I am always
wishing to be like you, and am going to try more and
more."
"Oh, stop, stop, Nina ('' exclaimed the conscience-
stricken Mervyn, jumping up, and blushing scarlet; "you
don't know what I am you don't really I don't deserve
to be praised; indeed I don't!"
Nina looked at him in surprise. Then she remembered
that on a former occasion, when she had praised him, he
had blushed in the same way, and that a certain reserve
had crept over him, for which she had not been able to
account. She had wondered then what the flaw could
be in a character which she considered perfect. She
wondered now. He was evidently fully aware of it him-
self: so, after a minute's pause, she said, gently,
"You wouldn't tell me about it once before, Mervyn;
but you'll tell me now?"
And he told her: confessed all his evil feelings and his
ill behavior, suppressing only what he had done to the
gate the day before, for not even to Nina could he tell
anything his mother did not know.
"You are dreadfully shocked, Nina," he said, anxiously,
when he had finished, observing the expression of her
face. -
Nina could not deny it; but the fact was, she was more
disappointed and puzzled than shocked. She had exalted
Mervyn's character into an idol, and now it had crumbled
away. Love, as demonstrated in him, had always seemed
to her such a pure feeling, as well as such a governing
impulse, that she was puzzled to find that that love was
now the very cause of his erring, the actual obstacle and
stumbling-block in his path. And she was tempted in
## p. 323 (#329) ############################################
THE SHOT IN THE WOODS. 323
that moment to believe, as many others have believed
before her, to their infinite pain and trouble, that it was
wrong, after all, to love so intensely, and to expend so
much affection on human beings; that it was, in fact, to
worship the creature more than the Creator; that such
love degenerated into idolatry, and brought a host of
evils in its train. The child would have been comforted
by the words of a writer of the present century: "No
one ever loved child, parent, or sister too much. It is
not the intensity of affection, but its interference with
truth or duty, that makes it idolatry. Love was given,
sanctioned, and encouraged . . . that self might be an-
nulled." Something of their sense and meaning came to
her as she thought. She tried in her own mind to excuse
him she loved by accusing herself, and turning back her
thoughts to her little dead brother,-sought whether, in
her love for him, such flaw had not existed. But it was
no use. Her innate truthfulness asserted itself over her
wish to screen Mervyn; and she could not but own to
herself that she would have cared little who rendered the
little boy tender and loving offices, provided he were
tended and loved. Nay, more, she would have loved any
one who loved him, and been grateful to any one who had
shown for him thought or consideration. Had not her
life been made better by the very want of love displayed
towards the child P Was not her new-born love for her
mother owing in a great measure to the love she had shown
for his memory P Did not her affection for Mervyn chiefly
date from the day she had found him playing in the
nursery with Totty? She knew that if she were Mervyn
she should love Lord Wardlaw ten times more for making
his mother so happy; and she was obliged to own to her-
self that the fault lay not in the love, but in Mervyn
himself. The flaw in his affection for his mother was a

slight tinge of selfishness; and selfishness is in itself a
contradiction to love.
Curiously enough, Mervyn's own thoughts had been
following in something of the same train. His mind had
traveled back to his mother's words of yesterday, when
she had refused to take his violets:
"They would give me no pleasure; for they would
only remind me that my boy's gift was what I fear his
affection for me is fast becoming."
And the scales fell from his eyes.
"I'll never be like that again," he said, impetuously.
"I see it all now. I see that if I loved mother as unself-
ishly as you loved Totty, I should not mind who did all
the things for her, so long as they were done. Now,
should I?''
"Perhaps not," said Nina, softly.
Mervyn's demeanor to his step-father that evening was
very marked. Twice he checked himself when about to
do some little service for his mother, because he saw Lord
Wardlaw on the point of doing it. He went to bed
happy, and full of new resolutions. But he quite forgot
to make his confession about the gate
"What a number of shooting-accidents there have been
lately 1" said Magdalen, the next morning at breakfast,
putting down the paper. "This is the third I have
seen in a fortnight. Charlie and Mervyn, please be
careful."
"I wish I had a chance," laughed Mervyn. "There
is no fear of my shooting myself till Saturday, mother
dear, I am sorry to say."
"Which way are you going to-day, Charlie?" asked
Magdalen.

Mervyn, "We may as well go together, Mervyn, as far as
we can. Our roads lie the same way for a bit."
The keeper and the dogs were waiting, and it was time
to start; so Mervyn went to get his books together, and
Magdalen and Nina went into the drawing-room.
"What shall be our plan for the day, Nina P"
"I must write mamma a long letter, Aunt Magdalen.
She sends you so many messages in hers, that I think you
had better read it."
Magdalen took it, and as she read rejoiced at the
anxious motherly tenderness and love it breathed.
"Good-by, Magdalen," said Lord Wardlaw, suddenly
appearing at the window.
"Good-by, Charlie," she said, going towards him;
"bear in mind my warning about shooting-accidents."
"No fear with only one gun," he answered, smiling,
as he leaned against the window and lighted his cigar. "I
shan't be late to-day. It gets too dark to do any good
after half-past four. Good-by, Nina. Where's Mervyn?"
Mervyn soon appeared, and the party started, Magdalen
and Nina watching them from the window. A pretty
sight, altogether, the tall, athletic man, with his gun
on his shoulder, the graceful boy bounding along by his
side, the keeper and the dogs behind. At any rate, the
wife and mother thought so, looking at them with loving
eyes.
Just as they disappeared she saw Mervyn look up at his
step-father, and Lord Wardlaw throw his arm around the
boy's shoulder, and she turned with a sigh of pleasure
from the window.
The morning passed pleasantly and quickly, and after
luncheon Magdalen and Nina started for a drive. There
was a good deal to do in the town, and they were detained
there longer than Lady Wardlaw had expected, so that it

was nearly dark when they reached home. She whipped
up the ponies as they neared Glen-Mervyn, saying she
almost thought her husband would have arrived first. But
on inquiring of the butler she found he had not returned.
The lamps were lighted in the drawing-room, and the tea
was ready. They went up to take off their things. When
Nina came down again she found Magdalen already there,
pouring out the tea.
"Charlie and Mervyn are both late," she said, "but
I dare say they will be here directly."
Nina drank her tea slowly, and found herself wishing
they would come in. Her illness had left her nervous,
and she had not so much self-control as she used to have.
Anything sudden was apt to startle her; the unexpected
ringing of a bell, or opening of a door, especially. Sev-
eral times since she had been at Glen-Mervyn her
heart had leaped into her mouth at sudden sounds, and
she had wondered to see her aunt unmoved and uncon-
cerned. -
She found herself now listening anxiously, and wonder-
ing why her uncle and cousin did not appear. It rendered
her unable to talk; and Magdalen, thinking she was
tired, took up a book, and began to read. Nina leaned
back in her chair, and watched her. How calm she
looked How quietly she was reading her book, and
how interested she seemed in it ! Nina sighed, and wished
she could be as calm, and not worry herself with imagi-
nary fears. It gave her strength, however; for she felt
that it was but nervousness on her part, and that there
was nothing really to be alarmed about.
"I will not let myself get fussy," she said, "till half-
past five."
Twenty minutes past five, five-and-twenty minutes past
five ; still no sound of any arrival. Nina's heart began
## p. 327 (#333) ############################################
THE SATO 7 AW 7A/E WOOADS. 327
to beat again, but a glance at the calm face opposite
quieted her. Still, she could not help wishing the room
were not quite so light and bright. It made everything
feel so like night, and she did not like to think it was so
late. What could they be doing? Why should both be
so late 2 It was impossible Lord Wardlaw could have
shot for the last hour. Why did he promise to be home
before dusk P And, oh, why had there been any talk
about shooting-accidents? It was that which made her
so nervous. Her aunt's gentle voice, breaking in upon
her thoughts, quite made her start.
"Nina," she said, putting down her book, "what time
did Charlie say he would be home?"
In vain did Nina try to steady her voice to answer.
The flutter in her heart betrayed itself in her voice; and
Lady Wardlaw, alarmed, got up and came to her.
"My dear child, what is the matter? Are you ill?"
Nina hid her face in the sofa-cushion, and tried to
escape from her aunt's eye. She did not want to say
what was the matter. The last thing she wished was
to infect Magdalen with her fears. She hated herself for
her weakness and want of self-control. She tried to say
she was only a little tired. Magdalen knelt down by her
side and put her arms round her. -
"Tell me what it is, dear, and then perhaps I can ex-
plain it away."
"Oh, it's nothing, nothing, Aunt Magdalen," she said,
still trying to hide her face; "it is only I am so silly.
Since that dreadful night, everything frightens me,
andand 7 x -
Just then the clock struck half-past five, and Nina
started.
"Are you frightened because they don't come home?"
said Magdalen, tenderly. "You need not be, dear,

really. Mervyn is apt to be unpunctual, and Charlie is
often much later than this."
"But he said " began Nina.
"He certainly said he would leave off shooting early;
but he was shooting at a great distance to-day, and would
have a long walk after he had left off. He would be sure
to shoot till the last moment, don't you see? I don't
think he could be home till now, I assure you, dear. He
must have been a long way off all day, for we have not
heard a single shot. Generally there is popping round
the house all the time he is out."
Comforted a little, Nina lay back in her chair again.
"I wonder if it is very dark," she said.
"Would you like to come to the window and see?
The air will refresh you, and drive away these nervous
fancies."
So saying, Magdalen walked across the room, drew
back the curtain, and opened the window.
Nina followed, and, leaning against it, peered out into
the darkness. The air refreshed her, and she began to
feel a little braver.
"Listen if there is any sign of them to be heard," said
Magdalen; and she bent her head. Nina did the same.
For some minutes no sound reached their ears. The
fresh air played on their faces, and rustled faintly among
the dying leaves on the trees close at hand; but otherwise
all was quiet.
Magdalen was just about to draw in her head, when
there rang out in the silence the loud report of a gun
It came so suddenly that they both started, and Nina
exclaimed, "Oh, Aunt Magdalen Aunt Magdalen what
can that be?"
- "It is all right, dear," Magdalen answered; but her
voice sounded rather strange. "It is Charlie letting off
## p. 329 (#335) ############################################
THE SHOT IN THE WOODS. 329
his gun before he comes into the house. He will soon be
here now."
"But that other sound," Nina whispered to herself, so
faintly that the words were inaudible.
"What?" said Magdalen, sharply.
"Oh, nothing, nothing," said Nina, shivering. "Let
us shut the window, Aunt Magdalen. It is so cold."
So they returned into the warm room, and the lamp-
light fell upon their faces, revealing Nina's paler than
ever, and a look on Magdalen's which had not been there
before.
She sat down again with her book, but she was not
reading it now; and Nina crouched by the fire, pretend-
ing to warm herself, but in reality to keep her back to
Magdalen and avoid meeting her eye.
What is it that has brought that new expression on
Magdalen's calm face? What is the unexpressed dread
that has risen in her breast? What was the sound she
heard AFTER the shot, to which she is trying to attach no
importance,which she is vainly persuading herself must
have been fancy?
It was a boy's voice, shouting, as if in mortal terror or
pain, and a terrible fear has entered the mother's heart.
For she knows it was Mervyn's voice.
What if Mervyn, running home in the darkness, had
not seen Lord Wardlaw's figure, and had come in the
way, unperceived, just as the gun was being let off?
It was, it must have been fancy. Nina evidently had
not heard it, or she would have Her eye wandered
on to the girl's figure, crouching by the fire.
Could it be possible that Oh, no! no impossible.
But why, then, did she sit huddled up like that, with
her back turned? Why did she not speak? What could
be the matter with the girl? She was cold, probably,

after standing at the window, cold, of course. It was a
cold night, and Nina was chilly after her illness. But
she ought to be warm by this time, in front of that roar-
ing fire.
What a curious thing attitude was It expressed so
much sometimes! What did that huddled-up, crouching
attitude express?
What if Nina had heard it too? Should she ask her?
But the mother's heart failed her. She could not ask,
lest she should hear from the child's lips a confirmation
of her own terrible suspicions. If both had heard it, it
could not be fancy.
She would wait five minutes more, and then
had not arrived, she would question the girl.
In the mean while she tried to persuade herself it had
not been Mervyn's voice. It was some boy passing,
either shouting to another, or startled by the sound of
the gun. - -
In vain The mother could not convince herself she
was mistaken ; knew in her heart that it was her boy's
voice; the voice she loved so dearly, the voice that had
been the music of her life for so many, many years!
The five minutes passed, and still she had not spoken.
But suddenly she feared she was selfish.
If Nina were really suffering from the same fear, how
cruel to let her bear it alonel Shattered in nerves
already, what agonies of mind she might be enduring !
This must not be. She must do violence to her own
feelings, in order to assist another.
Pressing her hands upon her breast, and summoning up
all her courage, she roused herself to speak.
"Nina," she said, softly, "come here." She was a
brave woman ; but she trembled when she saw the effect
of her words; for the girl started first and shuddered,
if they

then rose slowly, still keeping her face turned away, and
advanced to Magdalen's side.
It told its own tale, and the mother's heart sank
sank. Slowly she turned the pale face towards herself;
and as she saw the eyes quail before her glance, she knew
there was no need to put the question.
"You are a brave little thing, Nina," she said, taking
the icy hands in hers; "but you need not put a strain
upon yourself any longer. Sit down, dear, and tell me
all about it. You need not be afraid for me. We will
bear it together."
Nina sank down, sobbing, on the floor, and laid her
head against Magdalen's knee. Magdalen bent down and
kissed her without speaking.
"It is hard you should have new troubles, my poor
child," she said, faintly, after a pause; and as she spoke
she clasped her hands tightly together. "I won't ques-
tion you, darling, for we both know what we heard. But
we won't give up hope yet. It may be thatit WaS
averted just in time. And in that case they will be here
directly. We will wait patiently for ten minutes longer,
and then if they have not come we must send to
See what has happened. Do not speak, dear; there
is no need to answer. Only pray."
Her bowed head sank upon her clasped hands, her lips
just touching the girl's pale brow. Deep silence reigned
in the room ; no sound broke the solemn stillness, no
sound of lamentation from within, no sound of an arrival
from without. The ten minutes slowly ebbed away. Six
o'clock came and passed ; and still Magdalen and Nina
remained motionless,their eyes closed, and their hands
folded.

THE FOOTSTEPS ON THE DEAD LEAVES.
MERVYN bounded along by his step-father's side after
leaving Glen-Mervyn, full of spirits. His good resolu-
tions had strengthened, and his conscience was at rest.
He chatted on, on all sorts of subjects, till they came
to the spot where their roads diverged.
"Could I not meet you somewhere on the way back
this afternoon," he said, turning his bright face up to his
companion, "so that we might walk home together?"
Lord Wardlaw put his arm affectionately round the boy
as he answered, "Certainly, my dear fellow ! Let me see.
What shall we make our trysting-place? Suppose we say
the old gate P I shall have a good way to come after I
leave off shooting, so I don't suppose I shall be there till
a quarter-past five. You will arrive first ; but, if you don't
mind waiting, I shall be very glad of your company."
So saying, Lord Wardlaw wished him good-by, and,
whistling to the dogs, strode off.
Mervyn watched him as he went along, rather thought-
fully, and with a heightened color.
"How very unfortunate 1" he said to himself. "I wish
I had remembered to tell mother last night !"
He half thought of running after him and making his
confession, but was deterred by the thought of the keeper.
"Well, I must take care to be at the gate in good time,"
he said, after awhile, "so as to tell him all about it before
he finds out for himself. That would indeed spoil it all."
He turned round at last, and, full of hope and spirits,

THE FoozSTEPS oy THE DEAD LEAVES. 333
ran off to the vicarage, singing as he went. His last reso-
lution was that he would call Lord Wardlaw "father'' on
the very next opportunity, and he wondered vaguely when
that opportunity would be. He did not hurry away from
the vicarage at five. His step-father had said he should
not be at the gate till a quarter past; and, though he was
anxious to arrive there first, he did not wish to be too
soon, and to have to wait about in the dark.
He stayed chatting to the vicar for some time, till Mr.
Hughes remarked it was a dark evening, and he thought
he had better start.
"I could find my way home blindfold," laughed Mer.
vyn, "so it does not make much difference to me."
However, he jumped up, and on glancing at the clock
was surprised to find that it was very nearly time for Lord
Wardlaw to be at the trysting-place.
"If I run all the way, I shall just catch him," he said,
as he wished the vicar good-night.
He was surprised, when he got out of the vicarage, to
find how very dark it was. There were no stars, and he
could only just see his way. It was, as he had said, no
difficulty to him, knowing, as he did, every step of the
way; but he began to think Lord Wardlaw might be a
little puzzled.
"He will never find the gate," he said to himself: "it
is a good thing I am here to show him where it is."
He stopped for a minute to hear if there was any sound
of his approach. He fancied he heard something in the
distance, but was not quite sure. So he ran on till he
was within (as far as he could judge in the darkness) a
quarter of a mile of the gate. And then he stopped and
listened again. This time there was no mistake. He
heard Lord Wardlaw coming along plainly, in a cross
direction ahead of him, making straight for the gate.
## p. 334 (#340) ############################################
334 THA'O WAV 7TOGAE 7A/EA'.
He could distinguish his firm, quick footsteps, trampling
over the dead leaves; and the very words of the song he
was singing as he went along:
"I had a message to send her,
To her whom my soul loved best."
Mervyn wanted very much to attract his attention, and
to get him to wait till he came up to him, but his habit
of not calling him by any name made it rather awkward.
A false feeling of shyness prevented his calling out,
"Father '' as his heart dictated.
"Another time I will," he said to himself; "I can't
do it now." While he hesitated, Lord Wardlaw was
getting farther and farther away.
"Stop " Mervyn called out. "Halloo ! stop a
minute '''
It might have been the loud tones of his own song that
prevented Lord Wardlaw hearing; or, if the sound did
reach his ears, he must have thought it was some boy
passing by and calling to another, for he did not pause or
answer; and Mervyn only heard the receding footsteps,
and the song getting fainter in the distance,
"But I had my task to finish,
And she had gone home to rest."
"He must be nearly at the gate now," thought Mervyn.
"I shall never get up to him." Hardly had the thought
passed through his mind when it was succeeded by another,
which made him stop short and exclaim, "Good gracious!"
Quick as lightning came the thought that Lord Ward-
law in the darkness would not perceive the change on the
gate, and, expecting a step where there was none, would
most likely lose his footing in vaulting over it, and get a
very disagreeable fall. To make it worse, he had his gun

THE FOOTSTEPS OAV 7THE DEAD I, EA PES. 335
with him, and it would be loaded, for he never fired it
off till the last moment. Seized with a sudden dread,
Mervyn set off running with all his might, hoping that he
might just get within hearing in time, and warn his step-
father of the danger which threatened him.
He tore along at the top of his speed, shouting as he
ran, breathless and panic-stricken. He could hear the
loud tones of the manly voice above his own footsteps,
and above his own quick breathing, still singing the same
song; and he thought he must be gaining upon him, for
the song sounded clearer. But the gate must be very
near now, and Mervyn knew how quickly he would vault
over it. And then How could he stop him 2 What
could he do to attract his attention ? He must be gain-
ing upon him now, for he could distinguish every word
he was singing; every note of the music that was ringing
through the wood,
"And I cried, in my passionate longing,
Has the earth no angel-friend,
Who will carry my love the message
That my heart desires to send?"
The powerful voice drowned every sound, and Mer-
vyn's faint cries were unheard. And now the gate must
be close at hand. Breathless and despairing there burst
from the boy's lips the wild, piercing cry, "Father
father 1''
For one happy moment he fancied there was a pause,
and he strained every nerve and tore along at lightning
speed. But if the word did reach Lord Wardlaw's ears it
was, unhappily, too unfamiliar for him to suppose it could
apply to him, and Mervyn's pricking conscience told him
it was so. -
To his dismay, the song burst out afresh, and the firm

footsteps on the crackling leaves increased in speed, as
if nearing the end of their journey. Presently, voice and
footsteps stopped.
The darkness was broken by a sudden flash of light,
and simultaneously with a crash and a heavy fall there
rang out into the silence the sounds which, penetrating
far and wide, reached ever to the open window at Glen-
Mervyn,-the loud explosion of a gun, followed by an
agonized cry in a boy's voice.

THE TRYST BY THE GATE.
HE was lying, prone and silent, by the gate, under the
shadow of the old Welsh hills. They were looking down
upon him in the darkness with pity and mute despair.
By the son of the man who wronged him, wronged once
more 1
This was what was awaiting Mervyn, when at length
he succeeded in dragging his trembling limbs to the spot.
Among the hills and the echoeson the very spot en-
deared to the boy by a thousand recollectionslay the
form of his step-father, brought low by his means. The
old Welsh hills, his boon friends and companions, who
have loved to echo his merry shouts and laughter, who
have so often looked down upon him with pride and ad-
miration, have echoed sadly his wild, piercing cry, and,
relapsing into silence, are looking down despairingly on
the wreck and the ruin before them.
How the boy got there he never could afterwards tell;
how he reached the gate, how he climbed over it, he never

knew ; how he knelt down, how he dared kneel down, by
the motionless figure as it lay, he never could imagine,
he never could bear to think.
Frozen with horror, stupefied with grief, he was for a
time deprived of sense or motion. The silence, the dark-
ness, the loneliness, the impossibility of doing anything,
the horror of the whole thing...eprived him of the power
to act, to think, to feel. Help he must have, human aid
and succor, communion with some living thing, or he
will go mad. But, in that wild, secluded spot, how is it
to be found? His fainting heart reminds him of a day
gone by, when in sport he hid himself in that lonely
place and saw no passer-by from morn to nightfall. It
was horrible, horrible, to be alone in the darkness with
the dead. If he could lift up his voice and call, if his
frozen tongue could perform its office, even then who
would hear? Who would catch the sound of his cry and
bear it onwards towards his home? No one !
Stop ! He has in that wild place friends who have
carried his voice far and wide in happier moments.
Weird, wild friends, so familiar as almost to seem human
to him. The echoes | Will they not help him now P
Will they not repeat his cry for help, so that some one
shall be attracted by the sound P. It may be that they
will carry his appeal to the very doors of Glen-Mervyn.
They have done so before. His mother has often said,
"I heard the echoes ringing and laughing, so I knew that
my boy was near."
Exerting himself to the utmost, he tries to give a call.
In vain. The echoes are mute and silent, for from his
parched and trembling lips comes a sound so faint they
cannot catch it. His voice dies away, and his heart sinks
within him.
Darkness deeper, silence greater; and the boy's nerves

are giving way. It is horrible, horrible, to be alone in
the darkness with the dead. The moments drag heavily
on,-moments or hours, or whatever they be. To him
they seem whole days, nights; he has lost all count of
time. Alone, quite alone, and no hope of human help
Presently it seems to him so long since it all happened,
so long since the time he started from Glen-Mervyn, his
step-father in health by his side, the keeper and the dogs
behind. That could not have been this morning. Oh,
no! a long time ago . His step-father has been lying
there many days now, and he, for years, or all his life
long, it may be, Lhas been sitting silent, alone in the
darkness with the dead.
Why should Thought at that moment suddenly resume
her sway? Hitherto he has been too dazed, too bewil-
dered, to collect his ideas ; but now, all in a moment,
from the darkness around him, Thought brings clear ta-
bleaux before him, and gaze upon them he must, whether
he will or no. Three vivid tableaux,the past, the
present, and the future.
Puts before him first the picture of his bright and
happy home. Lifelike and distinct are the moving
figures, just as he saw them last.
Shifts the tableau, and shows him clearly that its
brightness and its joy are flown ; forces upon him the
sudden conviction that, through his passionate act of
selfish rebellion, he has wrecked his mother's new-found
happiness and blasted the peace of her home.
Shifts it again, and holds before him the darkest scene
of all. His mother's love turned to hatred, his mother's
face averted from him with looks of loathing, as the in-
strument and the cause of it all.
Drops the curtain, and leaves him shrinking, alone in
the darkness, with the dead.

He feels at last what he has done; and his one frantic
wish is to get away, away from it all, to hide himself
somewhere, where no one will ever see or hear of him
again. For he can never go home any more ; never face
her with the news; never see her look of grief first, of
horror and of loathing afterwards. He must go at once.
Why has he stayed so long? He must find his way to the
station, and catch the night-mail from Holyhead on its
way to London. He staggered to his feet, and tried to
remember which way he ought to take. But as the needle
turns to the north, so did his longing eyes turn with an
irresistible attraction towards his beloved home.
"Going," he muttered, "going far away; never to
come back any more."
All that he was leaving, all that he was losing, came
rushing over his soul like a whirlwind, and a sob burst
from his aching heart.
"Mother l'' he cried, holding out his hands in the
darkness, "I shall never see you again Oh, mother
good-by! good-by!"
But he could not leave her like this. He must find
some way to tell her of how it had all come about ; of all
he had meant to do; of his contrition and his firm reso-
lutions. -
"I have a message to send her," he said, sobbing, un-
consciously using the words of the fatal song; "and send
it I must and will."
But the echoes will not take it, cruel and unforgiving
as they are Help and succor have throughout been
wanting; messengers, then, are far away.
Oh, what was the nearest human habitation? What
was the last human voice that fell upon his ear? His
puzzled brain refused to remember; his fainting heart
told him it was days and days ago. This dark silence

has gathered around him, this hideous silence has been
here, since since since he heard loud notes of
music ringing through the paths of the wood
Linked were those notes to verses; what did those
verses say?
And there burst from his lips the words, 
"And I cried, in my passionate longing,
Has the earth no angel-friend,
Who will carry my love the message
That my heart desires to send?"
>k >k >k >k >k >k
Those words have expressed his longing, and shown him
at last a way.
There is still no chance of human succor, there is still
no hope of human aid; but childlike thoughts of angel-
spirits are floating round him now ! Songs that his
mother has sung him, hymns he has learned to say ! An
angel will whisper his message. His mother will hear it
some day !
Very quietly he knelt down by his step-father's side.
"Father l'' he said, softly, "you are my angel-friend.
I have a message to send her, and no one can give it but
you. I meant to tell you what I had done. I tried all I
could to overtake you. Oh, why did you go so quick 2
You will tell her all this in her dreams, and you will for-
give me, I know. And tell her, too, that I loved you, and
called you 'father' at last."
Suddenly the boy paused, and, starting, listened in-
tently. A vague feeling of electric hope thrilled through
his heart, and he bent over the figure again. There was
a slight rustle of the dead leaves, and a deep-drawn sigh.
Bending closer and closer, he heard the sigh repeated,
and a faint voice say,+
"Be comforted, my child; I am not much hurt 1"

THE MESSAGE.
IT was quite true. Lord Wardlaw, in falling, had
sprained his ankle, and been stunned for a time, by fall-
ing with his head against the gate; but the contents of
his gun had lodged themselves harmlessly in the ground,
and he had not so much as been singed. Not sufficiently
himself to be able to speak, he had yet been aware of the
boy's presence, and had gathered in the sense of what he
had said. -
We need not paint the boy's rapture, or his quick transi-
tion from the very depths of misery to an overwhelming
joy. Those who have followed Mervyn's history thus
far will know that his nature was capable of such sudden
changes.
Full and free forgiveness was bestowed upon him by his
step-father, who at once declared he should never give the
subject a thought again.
"I consider you my preserver," he said, laughing;
"for what should I do now if you had not pursued me
so perseveringly P I should be in a nice plight alone here,
in the dark, with no means of getting assistance. I think
I shall have to send you home to order some conveyance
from the stables, for I don't believe I can walk. Lend
me a hand, Mervyn, and let me see."
The result of the experiment was that he could not stand
with any comfort; and they held a long conversation as
to what had better be done. It was settled that Mervyn
should run to the stables, and give orders, and then go
on, and tell his mother what had happened.

"I am afraid she will be anxious about us," said Lord
Wardlaw, "as we are so far behind our time; so it will
be better for you not to return here, but to go on at once
to the house."
"I don't like leaving you alone," said Mervyn, wist-
fully.
"Never fear, my dear boy. I shall do very well."
"I'll rush all the way," eagerly exclaimed Mervyn,
"so that you shan't have to wait here long; and then
I'll go straight into the drawing-room and tell mother
all"
"I have a message to send her," interrupted Lord
Wardlaw,-and, dark as it was, Mervyn blushed crimson,
"and you must give it word for word. Will you prom-
ise to do so?"
"I will do anything you tell me," said the boy, and
the tears rushed to his eyes. "I will say anything, do
anything in the world, to please you."
"Very well," said his step-father, and his voice
showed how touched he was, "then say only this. Do
not add one word to my message, nor take one word
away. Say that I have sprained my foot getting over
the gate in the dark, and that I have sent you on to
say I shall be home as soon as a conveyance can be got
ready."
"Only that?" said Mervyn, wistfully; "nothing about
how wrongly I behaved, and how sorry I am?"
"Not a word," said Lord Wardlaw, firmly; "and,
above all, nothing about the gun."
He particularly wanted to prevent the boy rushing in
to his mother in his present state of excitement, and pour-
ing out his confessions. He knew what a confused account
he would give of what had happened; how long it would
take Magdalen and Nina to unravel the truth from the

vague recital; and how much time they would have to
take alarm in the mean time.
Mervyn said nothing more, but ran off to do his step-
father's bidding.
Consternation reigned in the stables at his news, and
willing hands made hasty preparations to go to Lord
Wardlaw's assistance.
Then the boy sped on. His heart was very full as he
entered the halls he had so short a time ago thought he
should never enter more, and sought the beloved presence
he had thought he should never seek again. Remember-
ing his step-father's injunctions, he checked his bounding
step in the passage, and quietly opened the drawing-room
door. -
He had meant to speak softly, he had meant to walk in
leisurely; but when he saw her start from her seat by the
fire, and come to meet him with outstretched hands and
a face on which yearning love and delight were vividly
painted, he forgot everything but the joy of meeting her
with no load on his heart, no heavy tidings to unfold, and
sprang to her embrace in a manner and with an eagerness
which at once confirmed her impression that he had
indeed been snatched from the jaws of death, and caused
her unquestioningly to clasp him in her arms, murmuring,
"Thank God thank God '''
Yet the boy wondered a little to see her so moved; he
wondered a little to feel her tremble; and when at last she
looked him all over, and said, "Not hurt not singed,
even l'' he wondered more.
He felt so undeserving of such love, he felt such a
longing to confess his misdemeanor, that, half fearing he
should tell all before he knew what he was saying, he
hastily delivered his message.
"Mother," he said, "he has sprained his ankle, getting

over the gate in the dark, and has sent me on to say
he is coming as soon as a conveyance can be got from the
stables. And that is all I may tell you."
Lady Wardlaw changed color as he spoke, but she
looked more puzzled than alarmed.
"Tell me all about it, my darling," she said, sitting
down and drawing him to her; "do not hide anything
from me. And, Nina, come here too, and help me to
understand."
Passing her arm round the slight form of the still trem-
bling girl, whose dark eyes never moved from Mervyn's
face, devouring him as one just risen from the grave,
Magdalen laid her disengaged hand on the boy's, and
waited for him to begin.
Mervyn's face was a study. Never in his life had he
been so puzzled and dumfounded. To refuse to com-
ply with a request of his mother's was a thing altogether
strange and impossible. On the other hand, to disobey
his step-father was equally impossible. To break his
promisea promise made under such peculiar circum-
stanceswas out of the question. He looked from his
mother to Nina, and from Nina to his mother, with a
scared face, and said nothing.
"Mervyn," said Magdalen, faintly, "something has
happened to Charlie."
For all answer Mervyn repeated his message, word for
word, adding, "That is all, mother, really."
"You are hiding something from me, child," she said,
in a sharp tone of pain. "That is not all, I am sure.
Why, your eyes are swollen with crying, and your face as
pale as death ! What has happened, Mervyn P I desire
you to answer me!"
Poor Mervyn positively writhed under the words.
Concealment was so foreign to his nature, disobedience

to his mother so utterly strange, that it was all he could
do to restrain himself from speaking. But above these
feelings rose his new-born love and loyalty to his step-
father, and prevailed.
"I wish I could, mother," he said, mournfully; "but
I promised faithfully not."
"This is dreadful '' exclaimed Magdalen. "Mervyn,
whatever promise you have made, I absolve you from it !
Whatever commands have been laid upon you, I release
you from them You never disobeyed me before. Do
not break my heart now !"
"Mother, mother l'' cried the boy, in despair; "don't,
please don't If you only knew all, you would say I was
right !"
"But why should I not know all," she demanded, "if,
as you say, there is nothing?"
"Because I have promised," said Mervyn.
"Tell me one thing," she said, and her voice faltered;
"why did you shout and cry as if in grief or terror when
the gun went off?"
"Good gracious !" exclaimed Mervyn, stepping back.
in his astonishment, "how did you know anything about
the gun? That is the very thing I was not to mention to
you."
Magdalen was dismayed at the effect of her words.
"There is some dreadful mystery here," she said, rising
and advancing to the bell; "and if you will not unravel
it, I must find others who will !"
She took the bell-rope in her hand, and was about to
ring, when she was startled by a glad shout from Mervyn,
and, looking round, saw her husband in the doorway.

"Was my messenger unfaithful?" said Lord Wardlaw,
rather sternly, as he took his wife in his arms.

"No, father, no!" said Mervyn, eagerly; "indeed I
was not Ask Nina l''
"I must believe him, I suppose," smiled Lord Wardlaw,
as he met the pale girl's glowing eyes.
"He would not say a word," said Nina, proudly.
"No, not even when Aunt Magdalen positively ordered
him to speak, and said she would release him from any
and every command that had been laid upon him."
"Well done!" said Lord Wardlaw; "well done, my
messenger and well done, little champion ''
"But I may speak now?" said Mervyn, eagerly; "I
may tell them the whole story from the very beginning?"
"Every word," replied his step-father: "only help me
to a chair first."
Mervyn flew on the wings of love to execute his bid-
ding, almost upsetting his mother in his eagerness to per-
form the office. She gave way, a little bewildered, but
well pleased to see the boy's demeanor. She sat down on
the sofa near, with her arm round Nina. The impetuous
boy flung himself at her feet, and poured forth his tale.
They all listened with breathless interest, an interest
that became quite painful when he painted in vivid lan-
guage his hot pursuit through the woods, the terrible d-
nouement, and the harrowing details of his lonely vigil
in the darkness. But when he went on to describe the
three pictures that had risen around him, and the deter-
mination to which gazing on them had brought him,
Magdalen held up her hand in mute entreaty, for it was
more than she could bear. But Mervyn would not stop,
would not spare himself or her, till he had made a full
and free confession. And he went on to tell them all
that he had felt, all that he had said, and all that he had
done. But he had gone too far. When he got to the
parting with his mother, when he repeated his words of

passionate farewell, when he spoke of the message he had
tried to send her, he broke down altogether, and sank,
sobbing, into her arms.
"I will tell you the rest, Magdalen," said Lord Ward-
law. "I will deliver the message that our boy desired to
send."
So he gave it. A message, as we know, so tender, so
humble, so full of childlike love and confidence, that his
own voice faltered as he repeated it ; and Magdalen, clasp-
ing her boy closer to her, bowed her head, weeping over
him, and whispered tender words of fervent blessing and
forgiveness.
"So, after all, Mervyn," said Lord Wardlaw, presently,
"a breech-loader has been, from first to last, our best
friend." -
"No, father," said Mervyn, eagerly; "it is Nina who
has been our best friend. She first made me see I was
wrong. The praise is all due to her. She is the best, the
most unselfish 2 *
"Mervyn !" burst passionately from the girl's lips,
"please do not praise me. Uncle Charlie, if you only
knew what I was before he came to Granton, you would see
how much I owe to him, and how grateful I ought to be."
She spoke in a tone of concentrated fervor, surprised
out of her usual reserve; and her beautiful eyes glowed
and deepened as she raised them beseechingly to Mervyn's
face.
"Hush '" said Magdalen, very softly; "hush, my
darlings I Love one another and be grateful to one
another, if you will; but give the praise only to Him by
whom you were thrown together."
The book is ended, and the story is told. The charac-

ters have acted before us, and the curtain has fallen on
them all. So we have done with them, and, returning
each to our own life, forget, or only slightly remember,
the parts they have played.
Yet it may be that in life's drama we are acting the
same parts as they ; it may be we are learning, in our
paths, the lessons they learned in theirs. Our circum-
stances may be different, and our surroundings very
unlike, but the spirit underlying all is forever the same.
Varying widely as we all do, we are at least alike in
this; that we are daily, each of us, shedding abroad an in-
fluence for good or for evil. Each upon each, and all
upon all. Some directly, some indirectly, some con-
sciously, and some unconsciously. But each has his use,
each his place and function, which none but himself can
fill.
The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong. The weak things of the world are sometimes
chosen to confound the mighty; the feeble and insignifi-
cant have their place too, and may, for aught we know,
be exerting an influence on the powerful and the mighty.
Strong and proud though we may be, some despised
one may be working in us, or in others, that which we
are powerless to accomplish. Therefore we can despise
neither ourselves nor others, nor the positions which we
fill; since one can supply what the other lacks, the parts
making a perfect whole. In that vast whole each is but a
unit, an atom; yet without it, it may be, the whole fabric
would fall to pieces.
Looking upwards on a starlight evening, do we realize
the units of the glittering sky? Standing by the sea, do
we consider the atoms of the sand we tread? Yet every
star in the heavens has its space to brighten; and every
grain of sand on the sea-shore has its place to fill.

THE MESSAGE. 349
/
Alike in Life and Nature, all seems chaos and confusion.
To us the sand seems ever vaguely shifting, the toy of every
wave and every footfall,to us the stars seem loosely scat-
tered, sown broadcast on the firmament; sand and stars
alike, in a meaningless, purposeless way. Yet there reigns
over all creation the law of purpose and of order.
So, to us, the infinite varieties of character in the world
seem thrown together in inextricable chaos, -a seething
mass of conflicting ingredients, working out their own
ends amid error and confusion. Yet all is pervaded by
a Sovereign Purpose, which we in our blindness did not
see. To us, all is in hopeless entanglement; to our dis-
ordered minds all things are out of course; to Him, all
the parts, fitly joined together, are working up to the end
He has ordained,to a perfect consummation. Silently
is He ordering all things to the same end; mysteriously
guiding our many feet, by the many thousand paths, to
the same goal, blending our countless notes to the same
glorious harmony; making, by His Almighty power, "all
things work together for good."
THE END.
