CORBET.An ancient leafless stump of a horse-chesnut stood in the middle of adusty field, bordered on the south side by a row of houses of somepretension.  Against this stump, a pretty delicate fair girl ofseventeen, whose short lilac sleeves revealed slender white arms, andher tight, plain cap tresses of flaxen hair that many a beauty mighthave envied, was banging a cocoa-nut mat, chanting by way ofaccompaniment in a sort of cadence--'I have found out a gift for my fur,I have found where the wood-pigeons breed;But let me the plunder forbear,She will say--''Hollo, I'll give you a shilling for 'em!' was the unlooked-forconclusion, causing her to start aside with a slight scream, as therestood beside her a stout, black-eyed, round-faced lad, his ruddy cheeksand loutish air showing more rusticity than agreed with his keen, saucyexpression, and mechanic's dress.'So that's what you call beating a mat,' said he, catching it from herhands, and mimicking the tender clasp of her little fingers. 'D'yethink it's alive, that you use it so gingerly?  Look here! Give it himwell!' as he made it resound against the tree, and emit a whirlwind ofdust.  'Lay it into him with some jolly good song fit to fetch a strokehome with!  Why, I heard my young Lord say, when Shakspeare was abutcher, he used to make speeches at the calves, as if they was for asacrifice, or ever he could lift a knife to 'em.''Shakspeare!  He as wrote Romeo and Juliet, and all that!  He abutcher!  Why, he was a poet!' cried the girl, indignantly.'If you know better than Lord Fitzjocelyn, you may!' said the boy.'I couldn't have thought it!' sighed the maiden.'It's the best of it!' cried the lad, eagerly.  'Why, Charlotte, don'tye see, he rose hisself.  Anybody may rise hisself as has a mind to it!''Yes, I've read that in books said Charlotte.  'You can, men can, Tom,if you would but educate yourself like Edmund! in the Old EnglishBaron.  But then, you know whose son you are.  There can't be nocatastrophe--''I don't want none,' said Tom.  'We are all equal by birth, so theorator proves without a doubt, and we'll show it one of these days. Arare lady I'll make of you yet, Charlotte Arnold.''O hush, Tom, I can never be a lady--and I can't stand dawdlinghere--nor you neither.  'Tisn't right to want to be out of our station,though I do wish I lived in an old castle, where the maidens workedtapestry, and heard minstrels, never had no stairs to scour. Come, giveme my mats, and thank you kindly!''I'll take 'em in,' said Tom, shouldering them.  ''Tis breakfast-hour,so I thought I'd just run up and ax you when my young Lord goes up toOxford.'He is gone,' said Charlotte; 'he was here yesterday to take leave ofmissus. Mr. James goes later--''Gone!' cried Tom.  'If he didn't say he'd come and see me at Mr.Smith's!''Did you want to speak to him?''I wanted to see him particular.  There's a thing lays heavy on mymind.  You see that place down in Ferny dell--there's a steep bank downto the water.  Well, my young Lord was very keen about building a kindof steps there in the summer, and he and I settled the stones, and Iwas to cement 'em.  By comes Mr. Frost, and finds faults, what Ithought he'd no call to; so I flings down my trowel, and wouldn't go onfor he!  I was so mortal angry, I would not go back to the work; and Ibelieve my Lord forgot it--and then he went back to college; andFrampton and Gervas, they put on me, and you know how 'twas I come awayfrom Ormersfield. I was not going to say a word to one of that lot! butif I could see Lord Fitzjocelyn, I'd tell him they stones arn't fixed;and if the frost gets into 'em, there'll be a pretty go next timethere's a tolerablish weight!  But there--it is his own look-out!  Ifhe never thought it worth his while to keep his promise, and come andsee me--''O Tom! that isn't right!  He only forgot--I hear Mrs. Beckett tellinghim he'd forget his own head if it wasn't fixed on, and Mr. James isalways at him.''Forget!  Aye, there's nothing gentlefolks forget like poor folks. ButI've done with he!  Let him look out--I kept my promises to him longenough, but if he don't keep his'n--''For shame, for shame, Tom!  You don't mean it!' cried Charlotte. 'But,oh!' with a different tone, 'give me the mat! There's the old Lord andMr. Poynings riding down the terrace!''I ain't ashamed of nothing!' said the lad, proudly; and as Charlottesnatched away the mats, and vanished like a frightened hare, he stalkedalong like a village Hampden, muttering, 'The old tyrant shall seewhether I'm to be trampled on!' and with both hands in his pockets, hegazed straight up into the face of the grave elderly gentleman, whonever even perceived him.  He could merely bandy glances with Poynings,the groom, and he was so far from indifferent that he significantlylifted up the end of his whip.  Nothing could more have gratified Tom,who retorted with a grimace and murmur, 'Don't you wish you may catchme?  You jealous syc--what is the word, sick of uncles or aunts, wasit, that the orator called 'em?  He'd say I'd a good miss of being oneof that sort, and that my young Lord there opened my eyes in time.  Nobetter than the rest of 'em--'And the clock striking eight, he quickened his pace to return to hiswork.  He had for the two or three previous years been nominally underthe gardener at Ormersfield, but really a sort of follower andfavourite to the young heir, Lord Fitzjocelyn--a position which hadbrought on him dislike from the superior servants, who were notpropitiated by his independent and insubordinate temper.  Faults onevery side had led to his dismissal; but Lord Fitzjocelyn had placedhim at an ironmonger's shop in the town of Northwold, where he had beenjust long enough to become accessible to the various temptations of alad in such a situation.Charlotte sped hastily round the end of the block of buildings, hurrieddown the little back garden, and flew breathlessly into her ownkitchen, as a haven of refuge, but she found a tall, stiff starched,elderly woman standing just within the door, and heard her last words.'Well! as I said, 'tis no concern of mine; only I thought it the partof a friend to give you a warning, when I seen it with my own eyes!--Ah! here she is!' as Charlotte dropped into a chair.  'Yes, yes, Miss,you need not think to deceive me; I saw you from Miss Mercy's window--''Saw what?' faintly exclaimed Charlotte.'You know well enough,' was the return.  'You may think to blind Mrs.Beckett here, but I know what over good-nature to young girls comes to.Pretty use to make of your fine scholarship, to be encouragingfollowers and sweethearts, at that time in the morning too!''Speak up, Charlotte,' said the other occupant of the room, a pleasantlittle brisk woman, with soft brown, eyes, a clear pale skin, and aface smooth, in spite of nearly sixty years; 'speak up, and tell Mrs.Martha the truth, that you never encouraged no one.'The girl's face was all one flame, but she rose up, and clasping herhands together, exclaimed--'Me encourage!  I never thought of what Mrs.Martha says!  I don't know what it is all about!''Here, Jane Beckett,' cried Mrs. Martha; 'd'ye see what 'tis tovindicate her!  Will you take her word against mine, that she's beengossiping this half hour with that young rogue as was turned off atOrmersfield?''Tom Madison!  cried the girl, in utter amaze.  'Oh! Mrs. Martha!''Well! I can't stop!' said Martha. 'I must get Miss Faithfull'sbreakfast! but if you was under me, Miss Charlotte, I can tell you itwould be better for you!  You'll sup sorrow yet, and you'll bothrecollect my advice, both of you.'Wherewith the Cassandra departed, and Charlotte, throwing her apronover her face, began to cry and sob piteously.'My dear! what is it now? exclaimed her kind companion, pulling downher apron, and trying to draw down first one, then the other of thearms which persisted in veiling the crimson face.  'Surely you don'tthink missus or I would mistrust you, or think you'd take up with thelikes of him!''How could she be so cruel--so spiteful,' sobbed Charlotte, 'when heonly came to ask one question, and did a good turn for me with themats.  I never thought of such a thing.  Sweetheart, indeed!  So cruelof her!''Bless me!' said Jane, 'girls used to think it only civility to saythey had a sweetheart!''Don't, Mrs. Beckett!  I hate the word!  I don't want no such thing! Iwon't never speak to Tom Madison again, if such constructions is to beput on it!''Well, after all, Charlotte dear, that will be the safest way. You areyoung yet, and best not to think of settling, special if you aren'tsure of one that is steady and religious, and you'd better keepyourself up, and not get a name for gossiping--though there's no harmdone yet, so don't make such a work.  Bless me, if I don't hear hislordship's voice!  He ain't never come so early!''Yes, he is,' said Charlotte, recovering from her sobs; 'he rode up asI came in.''Well, to be sure, he is come to breakfast!  I hope nothin's amiss withmy young Lord!  I must run up with a cup and plate, and you, make theplace tidy, in case Mr. Poynings comes in.  You'd better run into thescullery and wash your face; 'tis all tears!  You're a terrible one tocry, Charlotte!' with a kind, cheering smile and caress.Mrs. Beckett bustled off, leaving Charlotte to restore herself to thelittle handy piece of household mechanism which kind, patient, motherlytraining had rendered her.Charlotte Arnold had been fairly educated at a village school, andtenderly brought up at home till left an orphan, when she had beentaken into her present place.  She had much native refinement andimagination, which, half cultivated, produced a curious mixture ofromance and simplicity.  Her insatiable taste for reading wasmeritorious in the eyes of Mrs. Beckett, who, unlearned herself,thought any book better than 'gadding about,' and, after hearing herdaily portion of the Bible, listened to the most adventurous romances,with a sense of pleasure and duty in keeping the girl to her book.She loved the little fragile orphan, taught her, and had patience withher, and trusted the true high sound principle which she recognised inCharlotte, amid much that she could not fathom, and set downalternately to the score of scholarship and youth.Taste, modesty, and timidity were guards to Charlotte.  A broad starewas terror to her, and she had many a fictitious horror, as well asbetter-founded ones.  Truly she said, she hated the broad words Marthahad used.  One who craved a true knight to be twitted with asweetheart!  Martha and Tom Madison were almost equally distasteful, asconnected with such a reproach; and the little maiden drew intoherself, promenaded her fancy in castles and tournaments, kept underJane's wing, and was upheld by her as a sensible, prudent girl.CHAPTER II.AN OLD SCHOOLMISTRESS.I praise thee, matron, and thy dueIs praise, heroic praise and true;With admiration I beholdThy gladness unsubdued and bold.Thy looks and gestures all presentThe picture of a life well spent;Our human nature throws awayIts second twilight and looks gay.WORDSWORTH.Unconscious of Charlotte's flight and Tom's affront, the Earl ofOrmersfield rode along Dynevor Terrace--a row of houses with handsomecemented fronts, tragic and comic masks alternating over the downstairswindows, and the centre of the block adorned with a pediment andcolonnade; but there was an air as if something ailed the place: thegardens were weedy, the glass doors hazy, the cement stained andscarred, and many of the windows closed and dark, like eyes wantingspeculation, or with merely the dreary words 'To be let' enliveningtheir blank gloom.  At the house where Charlotte had vanished, he drewhis rein, and opened the gate--not one of the rusty ones--he enteredthe garden, where all was trim and fresh, the shadow of the house lyingacross the sward, and preserving the hoar-frost, which, in thesunshine, was melting into diamond drops on the lingering China roses.Without ring or knock, he passed into a narrow, carpetless vestibule,unadorned except by a beautiful blue Wedgewood vase, and laying downhat and whip, mounted the bare staircase, long since divested of allpaint or polish.  Avoiding the door of the principal room, he openedanother at the side, and stood in a flood of sunshine, pouring in fromthe window, which looked over all the roofs of the town, to thecoppices and moorlands of Ormersfield.  On the bright fire sung akettle, a white cat purred on the hearth, a canary twittered merrily inthe window, and the light smiled on a languishing Dresden shepherdessand her lover on the mantelpiece, and danced on the ceiling, reflectedfrom a beautifully chased silver cream-jug--an inconsistent companionfor the homely black teapot and willow-patterned plates, though the twocups of rare Indian porcelain were not unworthy of it.  The furniturewas the same mixture of the ordinary and the choice, either worn andshabby, or such as would suit a virtuoso, but the whole arranged withtaste and care that made the effect bright, pleasant, and comfortable.Lord Ormersfield stood on the hearth-rug waiting.  His face was that ofone who had learnt to wait, more considerate than acute, and bearingthe stamp both of toil and suffering, as if grief had taken away allmobility of expression, and left a stern, thoughtful steadfastness.Presently a lady entered the room.  Her hair was white as snow, and shecould not have seen less than seventy-seven years; but beauty was notgone from her features--smiles were still on her lips, brightness inher clear hazel eyes, buoyancy in her tread, and alertness and dignityin her tall, slender, unbent figure.  There was nothing so remarkableabout her as the elasticity as well as sweetness of her whole look andbearing, as if, while she had something to love, nothing could becapable of crushing her.'You here!' she exclaimed, holding out her hand to her guest.  'You arecome to breakfast.''Thank you; I wished to see you without interrupting your day's work.Have you many scholars at present?''Only seven, and three go into school at Easter.  Jem and Clara, wishme to undertake no more, but I should sorely miss the little fellows. Iwish they may do me as much credit as Sydney Calcott.  He wrote himselfto tell me of his success.''I am glad to hear it.  He is a very promising young man.''I tell him I shall come to honour, as the old dame who taught him tospell.  My scholars may make a Dr. Busby of me in history.''I am afraid your preferment will depend chiefly on James and youngCalcott.''Nay, Louis tells me that he is going to read wonderfully hard; and ifhe chooses, he can do more than even Sydney Calcott.''If!' said the Earl.Jane here entered with another cup and plate, and Lord Ormersfield satdown to the breakfast-table.  After some minutes' pause he said, 'Haveyou heard from Peru?''Not by this mail.  Have you?''Yes, I have.  Mary is coming home.''Mary!' she cried, almost springing up--'Mary Ponsonby?  This is goodnews--unless,' as she watched his grave face, 'it is her health thatbrings her.''It is.  She has consulted the surgeon of the Libra, a very able man,who tells her that there is absolute need of good advice and a colderclimate; and Ponsonby has consented to let her and her daughter comehome in the Libra.  I expect them in February.''My poor Mary!  But she will get better away from him.  I trust he isnot coming!''Not he,' said Lord Ormersfield.'Dear, dear Mary!  I had scarcely dared to hope to see her again,'cried the old lady, with tears in her eyes.  'I hope she will beallowed to be with us, not kept in London with his sister.  London doesher no good.''The very purport of my visit,' said Lord Ormersfield, 'was to askwhether you could do me the favour to set aside your scholars, andenable me to receive Mrs. Ponsonby at home.''Thank you--oh, thank you.  There is nothing I should like better, butI must consider--''Clara would find a companion in the younger Mary in the holidays, andif James would make Fitzjocelyn his charge, it would complete theobligation.  It would be by far the best arrangement for Mary'scomfort, and it would be the greatest satisfaction to me to see herwith you at Ormersfield.''I believe it would indeed,' said the old lady, more touched than theoutward manner of the Earl seemed to warrant.  'I would--you know Iwould do my very best that you and Mary should be comfortabletogether'--and her voice trembled--'but you see I cannot promise all atonce.  I must see about these little boys.  I must talk to Jem. Inshort, you must not be disappointed'--and she put her hands before herface, trying to laugh, but almost overcome.'Nay, I did not mean to press you,' said Lord Ormersfield, gently; 'butI thought, since James has had the fellowship and Clara has been atschool, that you wished to give up your pupils.''So I do,' said the lady, but still not yielding absolutely.'For the rest, I am very anxious that James should accept Fitzjocelynas his pupil.  I have always considered their friendship as the besthope, and other plans have had so little success, that--''I'm not going to hear Louis abused!' she exclaimed, gaily.'Yes,' said Lord Ormersfield, with a look nearly approaching a smile,'you are the last person I ought to invite, if I wish to keep yournephew unspoiled.''I wish there were any one else to spoil him!''For his sake, then, come and make Ormersfield cheerful.  It will befar better for him.''And for you, to see more of Jem,' she added.  'If he were yours, whatwould you say to such hours?'The last words were aimed at a young man who came briskly into theroom, and as he kissed her, and shook hands with the Earl, answered ina quick, bright tone, 'Shocking, aye.  All owing to sitting up tillone!''Reading?' said the Earl.'Reading,' he answered, with a sort of laughing satisfaction in dashingaside the approval expressed in the query, 'but not quite as yousuppose.  See here,' as he held up maliciously a railway novel.'I am afraid I know where it came from,' said Lord Ormersfield.'Exactly so,' said James.  'It was Fitzjocelyn's desertion of it thatexcited my curiosity.''Indeed.  I should have thought his desertions far too common to exciteany curiosity.''By no means.  He always has a reason.''A plausible one.''More than plausible,' cried James, excitement sparkling in his vividblack eyes.  'It happens that this is the very book that you would mostrejoice to see distasteful to him--low morality, false principles,morbid excitement, not a line that ought to please a healthy mind.'--'Yet it has interest enough for you.''I am not Fitzjocelyn.''You know how to plead for him.''I speak simple truth,' bluntly answered James, running his handthrough his black hair, to the ruin of the morning smoothness, so thatit, as well as the whole of his quick, dark countenance seemed to haveundergone a change from sunny south to stormy north in the few momentssince his first appearance.After a short silence, Lord Ormersfield turned to him, saying 'I havebeen begging a favour of my aunt, and I have another to ask of you,'and repeating his explanation, begged him to undertake the tutorship ofhis son.'I shall not be at liberty at Easter,' said James, 'I have all butundertaken some men at Oxford.''Oh, my dear Jem!' exclaimed the old lady, 'is that settled beyondalteration?''I'm not going to throw them over.''Then I shall hope for you at Midsummer,' said the Earl.'We shall see how things stand,' he returned, ungraciously.'I shall write to you,' said Lord Ormersfield, still undaunted, andsoon after taking his leave.'Cool!' cried James, as soon as he was gone.  'To expect you to give upyour school at his beck, to come and keep house for him as long as itmay suit him!''Nay, Jem, he knew how few boys I have, and that I intended to givethem up.  You don't mean to refuse Louis?' she said, imploringly.'I shall certainly not take him at Easter.  It would be a mere farceintended to compensate to us for giving up the school, and I'll notlend myself to it while I can have real work.''At Midsummer, then.  You know he will never let Louis spend a longvacation without a tutor.''I hate to be at Ormersfield,' proceeded James, vehemently, 'to seeFitzjocelyn browbeaten and contradicted every moment, and myself set upfor a model.  I may steal a horse, while he may not look over the wall!Did you observe the inconsistency?--angry with the poor fellow firstfor having the book, and then for not reading the whole, while itbecame amiable and praiseworthy in me to burn out a candle over it!''Ah! that was my concern.  I tell him he would sing another note if youwere his son.''I'd soon make him!  I would not stand what Louis does.  The more he isset down and sneered at, the more debonnaire he looks, till I couldrave at him for taking it so easily.''I hoped you might have hindered them from fretting each other, as theydo so often.''I should only be a fresh element of discord, while his lordship willpersist in making me his pattern young man.  It makes me hate myself,especially as Louis is such an unaccountable fellow that he won't.''I am sorry you dislike the plan so much.''Do you mean that you wish for it, grandmamma? cried he, turning fullround on her with an air of extreme amazement.  'If you do, there's anend of it; but I thought you valued nothing more than an independenthome.''Nor would I give it up on any account,' said she.  'I do not imaginethis could possibly last for more than a few months, or a year at theutmost.  But you know, dear Jem, I would do nothing you did not like.''That's nothing to the purpose,' replied James.  'Though it is to beconsidered whether Ormersfield is likely to be the best preparation forClara's future life.  However, I see you wish it--''I confess that I do, for a few months at least, which need interfereneither with Clara nor with you.  I have not seen Lord Ormersfield soeager for many years, and I should be very sorry to prevent those twofrom being comfortably together in the old home--''And can't that be without a chaperon?' exclaimed James, laughing.'Why, his lordship is fifty-five, and she can't be much less.  That isa good joke.''It is not punctilio,' said his grandmother, looking distressed.  'Itis needful to be on the safe side with such a man as Mr. Ponsonby. Myfear is that he may send her home with orders not to come near us.''She used to be always at Ormersfield in the old times.''Yes, when my sister was alive.  Ah! you were too young to know aboutthose matters then.  The fact was, that things had come to such a passfrom Mr. Ponsonby's neglect and unkindness, that Lord Ormersfield,standing in the place of her brother, thought it right to interfere.His mother went to London with him, to bring poor Mary and her littlegirl back to Ormersfield, and there they were till my sister's death,when of course they could not remain.  Mr. Ponsonby had just got hisappointment as British envoy in Peru, and wished her to go with him.It was much against Lord Ormersfield's advice, but she thought it herduty, poor dear.  I believe he positively hates Lord Ormersfield; andas if for a parting unkindness, he left his little girl at school withorders to spend her holidays with his sister, and never to be with us.''That accounts for it!' said James.  'I never knew all this! nor why wewere so entirely cut off from Mary Ponsonby.  I wonder what she is now!She was a droll sturdy child in those days!  We used to call herDownright Dunstable!  She was almost of the same age as Louis, and agreat deal stouter, and used to fight for him and herself too. Has notshe been out in Peru?''Yes, she went out at seventeen.  I believe she is an infinite comfortto her mother.''Poor Mary!  Well, we children lived in the middle of a tragedy, andlittle suspected it!  By the bye, what relation are the Ponsonbys tous?''Mrs. Ponsonby is my niece.  My dear sister, Mary--''Married Mr. Raymond--yes, I know!  I'll make the whole lucid; I'lldraw up a pedigree, and Louis shall learn it.'  And with elaborateneatness he wrote as follows, filling in the dates from the first leafof an old Bible, after his grandmother had left the room.  The task,lightly undertaken, became a mournful one, and as he read over hisperformance, his countenance varied from the gentleness of regret to alook of sarcastic pride, as though he felt that the world had dealthardly by him, and yet disdained to complain.KING ARTHUR-Pendragons and Dynevors innumerable-Roland Dynevor, d. 1793-1.                                                                    2.                                               3.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                     -                                             -Catharine, m.

College,Oxford.'Since 1816,' muttered James, as he finished.  'Thirty years ofdrudgery!  When shall I be able to relieve her?  Ha!  O. J. F. Dynevor,Esquire, if it were you who were coming from Peru, you would find ascore to settle!'He ran down stairs to assist his grandmother in the Latin lessons ofher little school, the usual employment of his vacations.Catharine Dynevor had begun life with little prospect of spendingnearly half of it as mistress of a school.Her father was the last male of the Dynevors of Cheveleigh--a familymounting up to the days of the Pendragons--and she had been made totake the place of an eldest son, inheriting the extensive landedproperty on condition that her name and arms should be assumed in caseof her marriage.  Her choice was one of the instances in which heraffections had the mastery over her next strongest characteristic,family pride.  She married a highly-educated and wealthy gentleman, ofgood family, but of mercantile connexions, such as her father, ifliving, would have disdained.  Her married life was, however, perfectlyunclouded, her ample means gave her the power of dispensing joy, andher temperament was so blithe and unselfish that no pleasure everpalled upon her.  Cheveleigh was a proverb for hospitality, affordingunfailing fetes for all ages, full of a graceful ease and freedom thatinspired enjoyment.Mr. Frost Dynevor was a man of refined taste, open-handed even toextravagance, liberal in all his appointments, and gratifying to theutmost his love of art and decoration, while his charities and generousactions were hearty and lavish enough to satisfy even his warm-heartedwife.Joined with all this was a strong turn for speculations.  When the mindhas once become absorbed in earthly visions of wealth and prosperity,the excitement exercises such a fascination over the senses that thejudgment loses balance.  Bold assumptions are taken as certainties, andmade the foundation of fresh fabrics--the very power of discerningbetween fact and possibility departs, and, in mere good-will, men,honest and honourable at heart, risk their own and their neighbours'property, and ruin their character and good name, by the very actionsmost foreign to to their nature, ere it had fallen under the strongdelusion.Mr. Frost Dynevor had the misfortune to live in a country rich inmineral wealth, and to have a brother-in-law easily guided, and withmore love of figures than power of investigating estimates on a largescale.  Mines were set on foot, companies established, and buildingscommenced, and the results were only to be paralleled by those of thechalybeate springs discovered by Mr. Dynevor at the little town ofNorthwold, which were pronounced by his favourite hanger-on to bedestined 'literally to cut the throat of Bath and Cheltenham.'Some towns are said to have required the life of a child ere theirfoundations could be laid.  Many a speculation has swallowed a life andfortune before its time for thriving has come.  Mr. Frost Dynevor andLord Ormersfield were the foremost victims to the Cheveleigh ironfoundries and the Northwold baths.  The close of the war brought acommercial crisis that their companies could not stand; and Mr.Dynevor's death spared him from the sight of the crash, which histalent and sagacity might possibly have averted.  He had shown nomisgivings, but, no sooner was he removed from the helm, than thevessel was found on the brink of destruction.  Enormous sums had beensunk without tangible return, and the liabilities of the companies farsurpassed anything that they had realized.Lord Ormersfield was stunned and helpless.  Mrs. Dynevor had but oneidea--namely, to sacrifice everything to clear her husband's name. Hersons were mere boys, and the only person who proved himself able to actor judge was the heir of Ormersfield, then about four-and-twenty, whocame forward with sound judgment and upright dispassionate sense ofjustice to cope with the difficulties and clear away the involvements.He joined his father in mortgaging land, sacrificing timber, andreducing the establishment, so as to set the estate in the way offinally becoming free, though at the expense of rigid economy andself-denial.Cheveleigh could not have been saved, even had the heiress not beenwilling to yield everything to satisfy the just claims of thecreditors.  She was happy when she heard that it would suffice, andthat no one would be able to accuse her husband of having wronged him.But for this, she would hardly have submitted to retain what her nephewsucceeded in securing for her--namely, an income of about 150 poundsper annum, and the row of houses called Dynevor Terrace, one of thebuilding ventures at Northwold.  This was the sole dependence withwhich she and her sons quitted the home of their forefathers.  'Nevermind, mother,' said Henry, kissing her, to prevent the tears fromspringing, 'home is wherever we are together!' 'Never fear, mother,'echoed Oliver, with knitted brow and clenched hands, 'I will win itback.'Oliver was a quiet lad, of diligent, methodical habits, and willinglyaccepted a clerkship in a mercantile house, which owed some obligationsto his father.  At the end of a couple of years he was sent to residein South America; and his parting words to his mother were--'When yousee me again, Cheveleigh shall be yours.''Oh, my boy, take care.  Remember, 'They that haste to be rich shallnot be innocent.''That was the last time she had seen Oliver.Her great object was to maintain herself independently and to completeHenry's education as a gentleman.  With this view she took up her abodein the least eligible of her houses at Northwold, and, dropping thearistocratic name which alone remained of her heiress-ship, opened aschool for little boys, declaring that she was rejoiced to recall thedays when Henry and Oliver wore frocks and learnt to spell. If anyhuman being could sweeten the Latin Grammar, it was Mrs. Frost, withthe motherliness of a dame, and the refinement of a lady, unfailingsympathy and buoyant spirits, she loved each urchin, and each urchinloved her, till she had become a sort of adopted grandmamma to allNorthwold and the neighbourhood.Henry went to Oxford.  He gained no scholarship, took no honours, buthe fell neither into debt nor disgrace; he led a goodnatured easy life,and made a vast number of friends; and when he was not staying withthem, he and his mother were supremely happy together.  He walked withher, read to her, sang to her, and played with her pupils.  He hadalways been brought up as the heir--petted, humoured, and waited on--apost which he filled with goodhumoured easy grace, and which hecontinued to fill in the same manner, though he had no one to wait onhim but his mother, and her faithful servant Jane Beckett.  Yearspassed on, and they seemed perfectly satisfied with their division oflabour,--Mrs. Frost kept school, and Henry played the flute, or shotover the Ormersfield property.If any one remonstrated, Henry was always said to be waiting for agovernment appointment, which was to be procured by the Ormersfieldinterest.  More for the sake of his mother than of himself, theOrmersfield interest was at length exerted, and the appointment wasconferred on him.  The immediate consequence was his marriage with thefirst pretty girl he met, poorer than himself, and all the Ormersfieldinterest failed to make his mother angry with him.The cholera of 1832 put an end to poor Henry's desultory life.  Hishouse, in a crowded part of London, was especially doomed by the deadlysickness; and out of the whole family the sole survivors were a littlegirl of ten months old, and a boy of seven years, the latter of whomwas with his grandmother at Northwold.Mrs. Frost was one of the women of whom affection makes unconsciousheroines.  She could never sink, as long as there was aught to need herlove and care; and though Henry had been her darling, the veryknowledge that his orphans had no one but herself to depend on, seemedto brace her energies with fresh life.  They were left entirely on herhands, her son Oliver made no offers of assistance. He had risen, so asto be a prosperous merchant at Lima, and he wrote with regularity anddutifulness, but he had never proposed coming to England, and did notproffer any aid in the charge of his brother's children.  If she hadexpected anything from him, she did not say so; she seldom spoke ofhim, but never without tenderness, and usually as her 'poor Oliver,'and she abstained from teaching her grandchildren either to look totheir rich uncle or to mourn over their lost inheritance.  Cheveleighwas a winter evening's romance with no one but Jane Beckett; and thegrandmother always answered the children's inquiries by bidding themprove their ancient blood by resolute independence, and by that truedignity which wealth could neither give nor take away.Of that dignity, Mrs. Frost was a perfect model.  A singular compoundof the gentle and the lofty, of tenderness and independence, she hadnever ceased to be the Northwold standard of the 'real lady,' too mildand gracious to be regarded as proud and poor, and yet too dignifiedfor any liberty to be attempted, her only fault, that touch of pride,so ladylike and refined that it was kept out of sight, and neveroffended, and everything else so sweet and winning that there wasscarcely a being who did not love, as well as honour her, for thecheerfulness and resignation that had borne her through her manytrials.  Her trustful spirit and warm heart had been an elixir ofyouth, and had preserved her freshness and elasticity long after hersister and brother-in-law at Ormersfield had grown aged and sunk intothe grave, and even her nephew was fast verging upon more than middleage.CHAPTER III.LOUIS LE DEBONNAIRE.I walked by his garden and saw the wild brier,The thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher.ISC WATTS.Ormersfield Park was extensive, ranging into fine broken ground, rockyand overgrown with brushwood; but it bore the marks of retrenchment;there was hardly a large timber tree on the estate, enclosures had beenbegun and deserted, and the deer had been sold off to make room forfarmers' cattle, which grazed up to the very front door.The house was of the stately era of Anne, with a heavy portico andclumsy pediment on the garden side, all the windows of the suite ofrooms opening on a broad stone terrace, whence steps descended to thelawn, neatly kept, but sombre, for want of openings in the surroundingevergreens.It was early March, and a lady wrapped in a shawl was seated on theterrace, enjoying the mild gleam of spring, and the freshness of thesun-warmed air, which awoke a smile of welcome as it breathed on herfaded cheek, and her eyes gazed on the scene, in fond recognition.It had been the home of Mrs. Ponsonby's childhood; and the slopes ofturf and belts of dark ilex were fraught with many a recollection ofgirlish musings, youthful visions, and later, intervals of tranquillityand repose.  After fourteen years spent in South America, how manythreads she had to take up again!  She had been as a sister to hercousin, Lord Ormersfield, and had shared more of his confidence thanany other person during their earlier years, but afterwards theirintercourse had necessarily been confined to brief and guarded letters.She had found him unchanged in his kindness to herself, and she was themore led to ponder on the grave, stern impassiveness of his manner toothers, and to try to understand the tone of mind that it indicated.She recalled him as he had been in his first youth--reserved, sensible,thoughtful, but with the fire of ambition burning strongly within, andever and anon flashing forth vividly, repressed at once as toodemonstrative, but filling her with enthusiastic admiration. Sheremembered him calmly and manfully meeting the shock of the failure,that would, he knew, fetter and encumber him through life--howresolutely he had faced the difficulties, how unselfishly he had puthimself out of the question, how uprightly he had dealt by thecreditors, how considerately by his father and aunt, how wise andmoderate his proceedings had been throughout.  She recollected how shehad shared his aspirations, and gloried in his consistent and prudentcourse, without perceiving what sorrow had since taught her-thatambition was to him what pleasure was to other young men.  What had itnot been to her when that ambition began to be gratified! when he hadbecome a leading man in Parliament, and by-and-by held office.There, a change came over the spirit of her dream; and though shesighed, she could not but smile at the fair picture that rose beforeher, of a young girl of radiant loveliness, her golden curls droopingover her neck, and her eyes blue as the starry veronica by the hedgeside, smiling in the sunshine.  She thought of the glances of prouddelight that her cousin had stolen at her, to read in her face, thathis Louisa was more than all he had told her.  Little was needed tomake her love the sweet, caressing young creature who had thrown herarms round her, and told her that she saw it was all nonsense to tellher she was such a good, grave, dreadful cousin Mary!  Yet there hadbeen some few misgivings!  So short an acquaintance!  Her cousin toobusy for more than being bewitched by the lovely face!  The Villiersfamily, so gay and fashionable!  Might not all have been foreseen? Andyet, of what use would foresight have been?  The gentleman was deeplyattached, and the lady's family courted the match, the distinction hehad won, atoning for his encumbered fortune.Other scenes arose on her memory--Louisa, a triumphant beauty, livingon the homage she received, all brilliance, grace, and enjoyment. Butthere was a darkening background which grew more prominent.  PoorLouisa had little wisdom by nature, and her education had been solelydirected to enable her to shine in the world, not to render her fit forthe companionship of a man of domestic tastes, accustomed to thesociety of superior women.  There was nothing to fall back upon,nothing to make a home, she was listless and weary whenever gaietyfailed her--and he, disappointed and baffled, too unbending to draw herout, too much occupied to watch over her, yielded to her tastes, andlet her pursue her favourite enjoyments unchecked.A time had come when childish vanity and frivolity were verging onlevity and imprudence.  Expostulations fell powerless on hershallowness.  Painful was the remembrance of the deprecating roguishglance of the beautiful eyes, and the coaxing caresses with which shekissed away the lecture, and made promises, only to forget them.  Shewas like the soulless Undine, with her reckless gaiety and sweetness,so loving and childish that there was no being displeased with her, soinnocent and devoid of all art or guile in her wilfulness, that herfaults could hardly bear a harsher name than follies.Again, Mrs. Ponsonby thought of the days when she herself had been leftto stay with her old uncle and aunt.  In this very house while herhusband was absent abroad, when she had assisted them to receive thepoor young wife, sent home in failing health.  She thought of the sadweeks, so melancholy in the impossibility of making an impression, orof leading poor Louisa from her frivolities, she recalled the sorrow ofhearing her build on future schemes of pleasure, the dead blank whenher prattle on them failed, the tedium of deeper subjects, and yet thebewitching sweetness overpowering all vexation at her exceedingsilliness.  Though full one-and-twenty years had passed, still thetears thrilled warm into Mrs. Ponsonby's eyes at the thought ofLouisa's fond clinging to her, in spite of many an admonition and evenexertion of authority, for she alone dared to control the spoiltchild's self-will; and had far more power than the husband, who seemedto act as a check and restraint, and whose presence rendered her nolonger easy and natural.  One confidence had explained the whole.'You know, Mary dear, I always was so much afraid of him!  If I had hadmy own way, I know who it would have been; but there were mamma andAnna Maria always saying how fortunate I was, and that he would bePrime Minister, and all the rest.  Oh! I was far too young and foolishfor him.  He should have married a sober body, such as you, Mary!  Whydid he not?  She wished she had never teased him by going out so much,and letting people talk nonsense; he had been very kind, and she wasnot half good enough for him.  That confession, made to him, would havebeen balm for ever; but she had not resolution for the effort, and thedays slid away till the worst fears were fulfilled.  Nay, were they theworst fears?  Was there not an unavowed sense that it was safer thatshe should die, while innocent of all but wayward folly, than be leftto perils which she was so little able to resist?The iron expression of grief on her husband's face had forbidden allsympathy, all attempt at consolation.  He had returned at once to hisbusiness in London, there to find that poor Louisa's extravagance hadequalled her folly, and that he, whose pride it had been to redeem hispaternal property, was thrown back by heavy debts on his own account.This had been known to Mrs. Ponsonby, but by no word from him; he hadnever permitted the most distant reference to his wife, and yet, withinconsistency betraying his passionate love, he had ordered one of themost beautiful and costly monuments that art could execute, for hergrave at Ormersfield, and had sent brief but explicit orders that,contrary to all family precedent, his infant should bear no name butLouis.On this boy Mrs. Ponsonby had founded all her hopes of a renewal ofhappiness for her cousin; but when she had left England there had beenlittle amalgamation between the volatile animated boy, and his graveunbending father.  She could not conjure up any more comfortablepicture of them than the child uneasily perched on his papa's knee,looking wistfully for a way of escape, and his father with an air ofhaving lifted him up as a duty, without knowing what to do with him orto say to him.At her earnest advice, the little fellow had been placed as a boarderwith his great aunt, Mrs. Frost, when his grandmother's death haddeprived him of all that was homelike at Ormersfield, He had been withher till he was old enough for a public school, and she spoke of him asif he were no less dear to her than her own grandchildren; but she wasone who saw no fault in those whom she loved, and Mrs. Ponsonby hadbeen rendered a little anxious by a certain tone of dissatisfaction inLord Ormersfield's curt mention of his son, and above all by his coldmanner of announcing that this was the day when he would return fromOxford for the Easter vacation.Could it be that the son was unworthy, or had the father's feelingsbeen too much chilled ever to warm again, and all home affections lostin the strife of politics?  These had ever since engaged him, whetherin or out of office, leaving little time for society or for anydomestic pursuit.Her reflections were interrupted by a call of 'Mamma!' and her daughtercame running up the steps.  Mary Ponsonby had too wide a face forbeauty, and not slightness enough for symmetry, but nothing could bemore pleasing and trustworthy than the open countenance, the steady,clear, greenish-brown eyes, the kind, sensible mouth, the firm chin,broad though rather short forehead, and healthy though nothighly-coloured cheek; and the voice--full, soft, and cheerful--wellagreed with the expression, and always brought gladness and promise ofsympathy.'See, mamma, what we have found for you.''Violets!  The very purple ones that used to grow on the orchard bank!''So they did.  Mary knew exactly where to look for them,' said Mrs.Frost, who had followed her up the steps.'And there is Gervas,' continued Mary; 'so charmed to hear of you, thatwe had almost brought him to see you.'Mrs. Ponsonby declared herself so much invigorated by Ormersfield air,that she would go to see her old friend the gardener.  Mary hurried tofetch her bonnet, and returned while a panegyric was going on upon herabilities as maid-of-all-work, in her mother's difficulties with malehousemaids--black and brown--and washerwomen who rode on horseback inwhite satin shoes.  She looked as if it were hardly natural that anyone but herself should support her mother, when Mrs. Frost tenderlydrew Mrs. Ponsonby's arm into her own; and it was indeed strange to seethe younger lady so frail and broken, and the elder so strong,vigorous, and active; as they moved along in the sunshine, pausing tonote each spring blossom that bordered the gravel, and entered thewalled kitchen-garden, where espaliers ran parallel with the walks,dividing the vegetables from the narrow flower-beds, illuminated bycrocuses opening the depths of their golden hearts to the sunbeams andthe revelling bees.   Old Gervas, in a patriarchal red waistcoat,welcomed Mrs. Ponsonby with more warmth than flattery.   Bless me,ma'am, I'm right glad to see you; but how old you be!''I must come home to learn how to grow young, Gervas,' said she,smiling; 'I hear Betty is as youthful as my aunt here.''Ay, ma'am, Betty do fight it out tolerablish,' was the reply to thiscompliment.'Why, Gervas, what's all that wilderness?  Surely those used to bestrawberry beds.''Yes, ma'am, the earliest hautboys; don't ye mind?  My young Lord cameand begged it of me, and, bless the lad, I can't refuse him nothing.''He seems to be no gardener!''He said he wanted to make a Botany Bay sort of garden,' said the oldman; 'and sure enough 'tis a garden of weeds he's made of it, and mineinto the bargain!  He has a great big thistle here, and the down blowsright over my beds, thick as snow, so that it is three women's work tobe a match for the weeds; but speak to him of pulling it up, ye'd think'twas the heart out of him.''Does he ever work here?''At first it was nought else; he and that young chap, Madison, alwaysbringing docks and darnel out of the hedges, and plants from thenursery gardens, and bringing rockwork, and letting water in to make aswamp.  There's no saying what's in the lad's head!  But, of late, he'snot done much but by times lying on the bank, reading or speakingverses out loud to himself, or getting young Madison off his work tolisten to him.  Once he got me to hear; but, ma'am, 'twas all aboutfairies and such like, putting an ass's head on an honest body as hadlost his way.  I told him 'twas no good for him or the boy to read suchstuff, and I'd ha' none of it; but, if he chose to read me some goodbook, he'd be welcome--for the candles baint so good as they used, andI can't get no spectacles to suit me.''And did he read to you?''A bit or two, ma'am, if the humour took him.  But he's young, you see,ma'am.  I'm right glad he'll find you here.  My old woman says he dowant a lady about the place to make him comfortable like.''And who is this young Madison?' asked Mrs. Ponsonby, when they hadturned from the old gardener.'To hear Jem, you would believe that he is the most promising plantrearing for Botany Bay!' said Mrs. Frost.  'He is a boy from that wildplace Marksedge, whom Louis took interest in, and made more familiarthan Jem liked, or than, perhaps, was good for him.  It did not answer;the servants did not like it, and it ended in his being sent to workwith Smith, the ironmonger.  Poor Louis! he took it sadly to heart, forhe had taken great pains with the boy.''I like to hear the old name, Louis!''I can't help it,' said Mrs. Frost.  'He must be his old aunt Kitty'sLouis le Debonnaire!  Don't you, remember your calling him so when hewas a baby?''Oh yes, it has exactly recalled to me the sort of gracious look thathe used to have--half sly, half sweet-and so very pretty!''It suits him as well now.  He is the kind of being who must have a petname;' and Mrs. Frost, hoping he might be already arrived, could hardlyslacken her eager step so as to keep pace with her niece's feeblemovements.  She was disappointed; the carriage had returned withoutLord Fitzjocelyn.  His hat and luggage were come, but he himself wasmissing.  Mrs. Frost was very uneasy, but his father silencedconjectures by saying, that it was his usual way, and he would make hisappearance before the evening.  He would not send to meet anothertrain, saying, that the penalty of irregularity must be borne, and thehorses should not suffer for such freaks; and he would fain have beenutterly indifferent, but he was evidently listening to every sound, andbetrayed his anxiety by the decision with which he checked allexpression of his aunt's fears.There was no arrival all that evening, no explanation in the morning;and Betty Gervas, whom Mary went to visit in the course of the day,began to wonder whether the young Lord could be gone for a soldier--theusual fate of all missing village lads.Mary was on her way home, through the park, along a path skirting thetop of a wooded ravine, a dashing rivulet making a pleasant murmuramong the rocks below, and glancing here and there through thebrushwood that clothed the precipitous banks, when, with a suddenrustling and crackling, a man leaped upon the path with a stone in eachhand.Mary started, but she did not lose her presence of mind, and her nextglance showed her that the apparition was not alarming, and was nearlyas much amazed as herself.  It was a tall slight young man, in a suitof shepherd's plaid, with a fair face and graceful agile form,recalling the word debonnaire as she had yesterday heard it applied. Ininstant conviction that this was the truant, she put out her hand bythe same impulse that lighted his features with a smile of welcome, andthe years of separation seemed annihilated as he exclaimed, 'My cousinMary!' and grasped her hand, adding, 'I hope I did not frighten you--''Oh no; but where did you come from?''Up a hill perpendicular, like Hotspur,' he replied, in soft low quiettones, which were a strange contrast to the words.  'No, see here,' andparting the bushes he showed some rude steps, half nature, half art,leading between the ferns and mountain-ash, and looking very inviting.'How delightful!' cried Mary.'I am glad you appreciate it,' he exclaimed; 'I will finish it off now,and put a rail.  I did not care to go on when I had lost the poorfellow who helped me, but it saves a world of distance.''It must be very pretty amongst those beautiful ferns!''You can't conceive anything more charming,' he continued, with thesame low distinct utterance, but an earnestness that almost took awayher breath.  'There are nine ferns on this bank--that is, if we havethe Scolopendrium Loevigatum, as I am persuaded.  Do you know anythingof ferns?  Ah! you come from the land of tree ferns.''Oh!  I am so glad to exchange them for our home flowers.  Primroseslook so friendly and natural.''These rocks are perfect nests for them, and they even overhang theriver.  This is the best bit of the stream, so rapid and foaming that Imust throw a bridge across for Aunt Catharine.  Which would be mostappropriate?  I was weighing it as I came up--a simple stone, or arustic performance in wood?''I should like stone,' said Mary, amused by his eagerness.'A rough Druidical stone!  That's it!  The idea of rude negligentstrength accords with such places, and this is a stone country.  I knowthe very stone!  Do come down and see!''To-morrow, if you please,' said Mary.  'Mamma must want me, and--but Isuppose they know of your return at home.''No, they don't.  They have learnt by experience that the right time isthe one never to expect me.'Mary's eyes were all astonishment, as she said, between wonder andreproof, 'Is that on purpose?''Adventures are thrust on some people,' was the nonchalant reply, withshoulders depressed, and a twinkle of the eye, as if he purposedamazing his auditor.''I hope you have had an adventure, for nothing else could justify you,'said Mary, with some humour, but more gravity.'Only a stray infant-errant, cast on my mercy at the junction station.Nurse, between eating and gossiping left behind--bell rings--enginesqueaks--train starts--Fitzjocelyn and infant vis-a-vis.''You don't mean a baby?''A child of five years old, who soon ceased howling, and confided hishistory to me.  He had been visiting grandmamma in London, and wasgoing home to Illershall; so I found the best plan would be to leavethe train at the next station, and take him home.''Oh, that was quite another thing!' exclaimed Mary, gratified at beingable to like him.  'Could you find his home?''Yes; he knew his name and address too well to be lost or mislaid. Iwould have come home as soon as I had seen him in at the door; but thewhole family rushed out on me, and conjured me first to dine and thento sleep.  They are capital people.  Dobbs is superintendent of thecopper and tin works--a thoroughly right-minded man, with a nice,ladylike wife, the right sort of sound stuff that old England's heartis made of.  It was worth anything to have seen it!  They doincalculable good with their work-people.  I saw the whole concern.'He launched into an explanation of the process, producing from hispocket, papers of the ore, in every stage of manufacture, and twistingthem up so carelessly, that they would have become a mass of confusion,had not Mary undertaken the repacking.As they approached the house, the library window was thrown up, andMrs. Frost came hurrying down with outstretched arms.  She was met byher young nephew with an overflow of fond affection, before he lookedup and beheld his father standing upright and motionless on the higheststep.  His excuses were made more lightly and easily than seemed tosuit such rigid looks; but Lord Ormersfield bent his head as ifresigning himself perforce to the explanation, and, with the softenedvoice in which he always spoke to Mrs. Ponsonby, said, 'Here heis--Louis, you remember your cousin.'She was positively startled; for it was as if his mother's deep blueeyes were raised to hers, and there were the same regular delicatefeatures, fair, transparent complexion, and glossy light-brown hairtinted with gold--the same careless yet deprecating glance, the sameengaging smile that warmed her heart to him at once, in spite of an airwhich was not that of wisdom.'How little altered you are!' she exclaimed.  'If you were not tallerthan your father, I should say you were the same Louis that I leftfourteen years ago.''I fear that is the chief change,' said Lord Ormersfield.'A boy that would be a boy all his life, like Sir Thomas More's son!'said Louis, coolly and simply, but with a twinkle in the corner of hiseye, as if he said it on purpose to be provoking; and Mrs. Frostinterposed by asking where the cousins had met, and whether they hadknown each other.'I knew him by what you said yesterday,' said Mary.'Louis le Debonnaire? asked Mrs. Frost, smiling.'No, Mary; not that name!' he exclaimed.  'It is what Jem calls me,when he has nothing more cutting to say--''Aye, because it is exactly what you look when you know you deserve ascolding--with your shoulders pulled down, and your face made up!' saidhis aunt, patting him.When Mrs. Ponsonby and Mary had left the room to dress, Louisexclaimed, 'And that is Mrs. Ponsonby!  How ill she does look!  Hervery voice has broken down, though it still has the sweet sound that Icould never forget!  Has she had advice?''Dr. Hastings saw her in London,' said his father.  'He sent her intothe country at once, and thinks that there is fair hope that completerest of spirits may check the disease.''Will she stay here?' said Louis, eagerly.  'That would be like oldtimes, and we could make her very comfortable.  I would train those twoponies for her drives--''I wish she would remain here,' said his father; 'but she is bent onbecoming my aunt's tenant.''Ha!  That is next best!  They could do nothing more commendable. Willthey be a windfall for the House Beautiful?''No,' said Mrs. Frost.  'They wish to have a house of their own, incase Mr. Ponsonby should come home, or Miss Ponsonby to stay with them.''The respected aunt who brought Mary up!  How long has she been atLima?''Four years.''Four years!  She has not made use of her opportunities!  Alas for theillusion dispelled!  The Spanish walk and mantilla melt away; andbehold! the primitive wide-mouthed body of fourteen years since!'Mrs. Frost laughed, but it seemed to be a serious matter with LordOrmersfield. 'If you could appreciate sterling worth,' he said, 'youwould be ashamed to speak of your cousin with such conceiteddisrespect.'All the effect was to make Louis walk quietly out of the room; but hisshoulder and eyebrow made a secret telegraph of amazement to Mrs. Frost.The new arrival seemed to have put the Earl into a state of constantrestless anxiety, subdued and concealed with a high hand, but stillvisible to one who knew him so intimately as did Mrs. Ponsonby.  Shesaw that he watched each word and gesture, and studied her looks tojudge of the opinion they might create in her.  Now the process wasmuch like weighing and balancing the down of Fitzjocelyn's ownfavourite thistle; the profusion, the unsubstantiality, and thevolatility being far too similar; and there was something positivelysad in the solicitous heed taken of such utter heedlessness.The reigning idea was the expedition to Illershall, and the excellentcondition of the work-people under his new friend the superintendent.Forgetful that mines were a tender subject, the eager speaker becamecertain that copper must exist in the neighbourhood, and what anemployment it would afford to all the country round.  'Marksedge mustbe the very place, the soil promises metallic veins, the discoverywould be the utmost boon to the people.  It would lead to industry andcivilization, and counteract all the evils we have brought on them.Mary, do you remember Marksedge, the place of exile?''Not that I know of.''No; we were too young to understand the iniquity.  In the lastgeneration, it was not the plan to stone Naboth, but to remove him.Great people could not endure little people; so, by way of kindness,our whole population of Ormersfield, except a few necessary retainers,were transported bodily from betwixt the wind and our nobility, locatedon a moor beyond our confines, a generous gift to the poor-rates ofBletchynden, away from church, away from work, away fromsuperintendence, away from all amenities of the poor man's life!'This was one of the improvements to which Mr. Dynevor had prompted thelast Earl; but Louis did not know whom he was cutting, as he utteredthis tirade, with a glow on his cheek and eye, but with his usual soft,modulated intonation and polished language, the distinctness anddeliberation taking off all air of rattle, and rendering his words moreimpressive.'Indeed! is there much distress at Marksedge?' said Mrs. Ponsonby.'They have gifts with our own poor at Christmas,' said LordOrmersfield, 'but they are a defiant, ungrateful set, always indistress by their own fault.''What cause have they for gratitude?' exclaimed his son.  'For beingturned out of house and home? for the three miles' walk to their dailywork!  Yes, it is the fact.  The dozen families left here, with edictsagainst lodgers, cannot suffice for the farmer's work; and all Norris'sand Beecher's men have to walk six miles every day of their lives,besides the hard day's work.  They are still farther from their parish,they are no one's charge, they have neither church nor school, and whomshould we blame for their being lawless?''It used to be thought a very good thing for the parish,' said Mrs.Frost, looking at her niece.  'I remember being sorry for the poorpeople, but we did not see things in the light in which Louis puts it.''Young men like to find fault with the doings of their elders,' saidLord Ormersfield.'Nothing can make me regard it otherwise than as a wicked sin!' saidLouis.'Nay, my dear,' mildly said Aunt Catharine, 'if it were mistaken, I amsure it was not intentionally cruel.''What I call wicked is to sacrifice the welfare of dependents to ourown selfish convenience!  And you would call it cruel too, AuntCatharine, if you could hear the poor creatures beg as a favour of Mr.Holdsworth to be buried among their kin, and know how it has preyed onthe minds of the dying that they might not lie here among their ownpeople.''Change the subject, Fitzjocelyn,' said his father: 'the thing is done,and cannot be undone.''The undoing is my daily thought,' said Louis.  'If I could have triedmy plan of weaving cordage out of cotton-grass and thistle-down, Ithink I could have contrived for them.'Mary looked up, and met his merry blue eye.  Was he saying it sogravely to try whether he could take her in?  'If you could--' shesaid, and he went off into a hearty laugh, and finished by saying, sothat no one could guess whether it was sport or earnest, 'Even takinginto account the depredations of the goldfinches, it would be anadmirable speculation, and would confer immeasurable benefits on theowners of waste lands.  I mean to take out a patent when I havesucceeded in the spinning.''A patent for a donkey,' whispered Aunt Catharine.  He responded with adeferential bow, and the conversation was changed by the Earl; butcopper was still the subject uppermost with Louis, and no sooner wasdinner over than he followed the ladies to the library, and begansearching every book on metals and minerals, till he had heaped up apile of volumes, whence be rang the changes on oxide, pyrites, andcarbonate, and octohedron crystals--names which poor Mrs. Frost hadheard but too often.  At last it came to certainty that he had seen thevery masses containing ore; he would send one to-morrow to Illershallto be analysed, and bring his friend Dobbs down to view the spot.'Not in my time,' interposed Lord Ormersfield.  'I would not wish for agreater misfortune than the discovery of a mine on my property.''No wonder,' thought Mrs. Ponsonby, as she recollected Wheal Salamancaand Wheal Catharine, and Wheal Dynevor, and all the other wheals thathad wheeled away all Cheveleigh and half Ormersfield, till the lastunfortunate wheal failed when the rope broke, and there were no fundsto buy a new one.  No wonder Lord Ormersfield trembled when he heardhis son launch out into those easily-ascending conjecturalcalculations, freely working sums in his head, so exactly like the oldEarl, his grandfather, that she could have laughed, but for sympathywith the father, and anxiety to see how the son would take the damp sovexatiously cast on his projects.He made the gesture that Mrs. Frost called debonnaire--read on for fiveminutes in silence, insisted on teaching his aunt the cause of thecolours in peacock ores, compared them to a pigeon's neck, and talkedof old Betty Gervas's tame pigeons; whence he proceeded to memories ofthe days that he and Mary had spent together, and asked which of theirold haunts she had revisited.  Had she been into the nursery?'Oh yes! but I wondered you had sent the old walnut press into thatlumber-room.''Is that satire?' said Louis, starting and looking in her face.'I don't know what you mean.''I have a better right to ask what you mean by stigmatizing myapartment as a lumber-room?''It was only what I saw from the door,' said Mary, a little confused,but rallying and answering with spirit; 'and I must maintain that, ifyou mean the room over the garden entrance, it is very like alumber-room.''Ah, Mary! you have not outgrown the delusions of your sex.  Is anEnglishman's house his castle while housemaids maraud over it,ransacking his possessions, irritating poor peaceful dust that onlywants to be let alone, sweeping away cherished cobwebs?''Oh, if you cherish cobwebs!' said Mary.'Did not the fortunes of Scotland hang on a spider's thread?  Did not acobweb save the life of Mahomet, or Ali, or a mediaeval saint--nomatter which?  Was not a spider the solace of the Bastille?  Have not Ilain for hours on a summer morning watching the tremulous lines of thebeautiful geometrical composition?''More shame for you!' said Mary, with a sort of dry humorous bluntness.'The very answer you would have made in old times,' cried Louis,delighted.  'O Mary, you bring me back the days of my youth!  You neverwould see the giant who used to live in that press!''I remember our great fall from the top of it.''Oh yes!' cried Louis;  'Jem Frost had set us up there bolt upright forsentries, and I saw the enemies too soon, when you would not allow thatthey were there.  I was going to fire my musket at them; but you usedviolence to keep me steady to my duty--pulled my hair, did not you?''I know you scratched me, and we both rolled off together!  I wonder wewere not both killed!''That did not trouble Jem!  He picked us up, and ordered us into arrestunder the bed for breach of discipline.''I fear Jem was a martinet,' said Mrs. Frost.'That he was!  A general formed on the model of him who, not contentedwith assaulting a demi-lune, had taken une lune toute entiere.  We hada siege of the Fort Bombadero, inaccessible, and with mortars firingdouble-hand grenades.  They were dandelion clocks, and there werenettles to act the part of poisoned spikes on the breach.''I remember the nettles,' said Mary, 'and Jem's driving you to gatherthem; you standing with your bare legs in the nettle-bed, when he wouldmake me dig, and I could not come to help you!''On duty in the trenches.  Your sense of duty was exemplary.  Iremember your digging on, like a very Casablanca, all alone, in themidst of a thunder-storm, because Jem had forgotten to call you in,crying all the time with fear of the lightning!''You came to help me,' said Mary.  'You came rushing out from thenursery to my rescue!''I could not make you stir.  We were taken prisoners by a sally fromthe nursery.  For once in your life, you were in disgrace!''I quite thought I ought to mind Jem,' said Mary, 'and never knewwhether it was play or earnest.''Only so could you transgress,' said Louis,--'you who never cried,except as my amateur Mungo Malagrowther.  Poor Mary! what an amazementit was to me to find you breaking your heart over the utmost penaltiesof the nursery law, when to me they only afforded agreeable occasionsof showing that I did not care!  I must have been intolerable till youand Mrs. Ponsonby took me in hand!''I am glad you own your obligations,' said Lord Ormersfield.'I own myself as much obliged to Mary for making me wise, as to Jem formaking me foolish.''It is not the cause of gratitude I should have expected,' said hisfather.'Alas! if he and Clara were but here!' sighed Louis.  'I entreated himin terms that might have moved a pyramid from its base, but the Frostwas arctic.  An iceberg will move, but he is past all melting!''I respect his steadiness of purpose,' said the Earl; 'I know no youngman whom I honour more than James.'His aunt and his son were looking towards each other with glisteningeyes of triumph and congratulation, and Mrs. Frost cleared her voice tosay that he was making far too much of her Jemmy; a very good boy, tobe sure, but if he said so much of him, the Marys would be disappointedto see nothing but a little fiery Welshman.CHAPTER IV.THISTLE-DOWN.Lightly soars the thistle-down,Lightly does it float--,Lightly seeds of care are sown,Little do we note.Watch life's thistles bud and blow,Oh, 'tis pleasant folly;But when all life's paths they strew,Then comes melancholy.Poetry Past and Present.Mary Ponsonby had led a life of change and wandering that had given herfew strong local attachments.  The period she had spent at Ormersfield,when she was from five to seven years old, had been the most joyouspart of her life, and had given her a strong feeling for the placewhere she had lived with her mother, and in an atmosphere of affection,free from the shadow of that skeleton in the house, which had darkenedher childhood more than she understood.The great weakness of Mrs. Ponsonby's life had been her over-hastyacceptance of a man, whom she did not thoroughly know, because herdelicacy had taken alarm at foolish gossip about herself and hercousin.  It was a folly that had been severely visited.  Irreligioushimself, Mr. Ponsonby disliked his wife's strictness; he resented heraffection for her own family, gave way to dissipated habits, and madeher miserable both by violence and neglect.  Born late of this unhappymarriage, little Mary was his only substantial link to his wife, and hehad never been wanting in tenderness to her: but many a storm had ragedover the poor child's head; and, though she did not know why the kindold Countess had come to remove her and her mother, and 'papa' wasstill a loved and honoured title, she was fully sensible of the calmsecurity at Ormersfield.When Mr. Ponsonby had recalled his wife on his appointment at Lima,Mary had been left in England for education, under the charge of hissister in London.  Miss Ponsonby was good and kind, but of narrowviews, thinking all titled people fashionable, and all fashionablepeople reprobate, jealous of her sister-in-law's love for her ownfamily, and, though unable to believe her brother blameless, holding itas an axiom that married people could not fall out without faults onboth sides, and charging a large share of their unhappiness on thehouse of Fitzjocelyn.  Principle had prevented her from endeavouring toweaken the little girl's affection to her mother; but it had been hergreat object to train her up in habits of sober judgment, and freedomfrom all the romance, poetry, and enthusiasm which she fancied had beeninjurious to Mrs. Ponsonby.  The soil was of the very kind that shewould have chosen.  Mary was intelligent, but with more sense thanfancy, more practical than intellectual, and preferring the homely tothe tasteful.  At school, study and accomplishments were mere tasks,her recreation was found in acts of kindness to her companions, and herhopes were all fixed on the going out to Peru, to be useful to herfather and mother.  At seventeen she went; full of active, housewifelyhabits, with a clear head, sound heart, and cramped mind, her spiritseven and cheerful, but not high nor mirthful, after ten years ofevenings spent in needlework beside a dry maiden aunt.Nor was the home she found at Lima likely to foster the joyousness ofearly girlhood.  Mr. Ponsonby was excessively fond of her; but hisaffection to her only marked, by contrast, the gulf between him and hermother.  There was no longer any open misconduct on his part, and Mrs.Ponsonby was almost tremblingly attentive to his wishes; but he waschill and sarcastic in his manner towards her, and her nervous attacksoften betrayed that she had been made to suffer in private fordifferences of opinion.  Health and spirits were breaking down; and,though she never uttered a word of complaint, the sight of hersufferings was trying for a warm-hearted young girl.Mary's refuge was hearty affection to both parents.  She would notreason nor notice where filial tact taught her that it was best to beignorant; she charged all tracasseries on the Peruvian republic, andset herself simply to ameliorate each vexation as it arose, and divertattention from it without generalizing, even to herself, on the stateof the family.  The English comfort which she brought into the Limenianhousehold was one element of peace; and her brisk, energetic habitsproduced an air of ease and pleasantness that did much to make homeagreeable to her father, and removed many cares which oppressed hermother.  To her, Mary was all the world-daughter, comforter, friend,and nurse, unfailing in deeds of love or words of cheer, and removingall sense of dreariness and solitude. And Mary had found her motherall, and more than all she remembered, and admired and loved her with adeep, quiet glow of intense affection.  There was so much call forMary's actual exertion of various kinds, that there was littleopportunity for cultivating or enlarging her mind by books, though thescenes and circumstances around her could not but take some effect.Still, at twenty-one she was so much what she had been at seventeen--sostaid, sensible, and practical, that Miss Ponsonby gladly pronouncedher not in the least spoilt.Fain would her aunt have kept both her and her mother as her guests;but Mrs. Ponsonby had permission to choose whatever residence bestsuited her, and felt that Bryanston-square and Miss Ponsonby would befatal to her harassed spirits.  She yearned after the home andcompanions of her youth, and Miss Ponsonby could only look severe, talkof London doctors, and take Mary aside to warn her against temptationsfrom fashionable people.Mary had been looking for the fashionable people ever since, and thefirst sign of them she had seen, was the air and figure of her cousinFitzjocelyn.  Probably good Aunt Melicent would distrust him; and yethis odd startling talk, and the arch look of mischief in the corners ofhis mouth and eyes, had so much likeness to the little Louis of oldtimes, that she could not look on him as a stranger nor as a formidablebeing; but was always recurring to the almost monitorial sense ofprotection, with which she formerly used to regard him, when she sharedhis nursery.Her mother had cultivated her love for Ormersfield, and she was charmedby her visits to old haunts, well remembering everything. She gladlyrecognised the little low-browed church, the dumpy tower, andgrave-yard rising so high that it seemed to intend to bury the churchitself, and permitted many a view, through the lattices, of the seats,and the Fitzjocelyn hatchments and monuments.She lingered after church on Sunday afternoon with Mrs. Frost to lookat Lady Fitzjocelyn's monument.  It was in the chancel, a recumbentfigure in white marble, as if newly fallen asleep, and with the lovelyfeatures chiselled from a cast taken after death had fixed and ennobledtheir beauty.'It is just like Louis's profile!' said Mrs. Frost, as they came out.'Well,' said Louis, who was nearer than she was aware, 'I hope at leastno one will make me the occasion of a lion when I am dead.''It is very beautiful,' said Mary.'May be so; but the sentiment is destroyed by its having been sixmonths in the Royal Academy, number 16,136, and by seeing it down amongthe excursions in the Northwold Guide.''Louis, my dear, you should not be satirical on this,' said Mrs. Frost.'I never meant it,' said Louis, 'but I never could love that monument.It used to oppress me with a sense of having a white marble mother!And, seriously, it fills up the chancel as if it were its show-room,according to our family tradition that the church is dedicated to theFitzjocelyns.  Living or dead, we have taken it all to ourselves.''It was a very fair, respectable congregation,' said his aunt.'Exactly so.  That is my complaint.  Everything belonging to hislordship is respectable--except his son.''Take care, Louis; here is Mary looking as if she would take you atyour word.''Pray, Mary, do they let no one who is not respectable go to church inPeru?''I do not think you would change your congregation for the wretchedcrowds of brown beggars,' said Mary.'Would I not?' cried Louis.  'Oh! if the analogous class here inEngland could but feel that the church was for them!--not driven outand thrust aside, by our respectability.''Marksedge to wit!' said a good-humoured voice, as Mr. Holdsworth, theyoung Vicar, appeared at his own wicket, with a hearty greeting. 'Inever hear those words without knowing where you are, Fitzjocelyn.''I hope to be there literally some day this week,' said Louis.  'Willyou walk with me?  I want to ask old Madison how his grandson goes on.I missed going to see after the boy last time I was at home.''I fear he has not been going on well, and have been sorry for it eversince,' said the Vicar.  'His master told me that he found him veryidle and saucy.''People of that sort never know how to speak to a lad,' said Louis. 'Itis their own rating that they ought to blame.''Not Tom Madison, I know,' said Mr. Holdsworth, laughing.  'But I didnot come out to combat that point, but to inquire after the commissionsyou kindly undertook.''I have brought you such a set of prizes!  Red rubrics, red margins;and for the apparatus, I have brought a globe with all the mountains inhigh relief;--yes, and an admirable physical atlas, and a box ofinstruments and models for applying mathematics to mechanics.  We mightgive evening lectures, and interest the young farmers.''Pray,' said the Vicar, with a sound of dismay, 'where may the bill be?I thought the limits were two pounds eighteen.''Oh!  I take all that on myself.''We shall see,' said Mr. Holdsworth, not gratefully.  'Was Origen senthome in time for you to bring?''There!' cried Louis, starting, 'Origen is lying on the very chairwhere I put him last January.  I will write to Jem Frost to-morrow tosend him to the binder.''Is it of any use to ask for the music?''I assure you, Mr. Holdsworth, I am very sorry.  I'll write at once toFrost.''Then I am afraid the parish will not be reformed as you promised lastChristmas,' said the Vicar, turning, with a smile, to Mrs. Frost.  'Wewere to be civilized by weekly concerts in the school.''What were you to play, Louis?' said Mrs. Frost, laughing.'I was to imitate all the birds in the air at once,' said Louis,beginning to chirp like a melee of sparrows, turning it into the croakof a raven, and breaking off suddenly with, 'I beg your pardon--Iforgot it was Sunday! Indeed, Mr. Holdsworth, I can say no more thanthat I was a wretch not to remember.  Next time I'll write it all downin the top of my hat, with a pathetic entreaty that if my hat bestolen, the thief shall fulfil the commissions, and punctually send inthe bill to the Rev. W. B. Holdsworth!''I shall hardly run the risk,' said Mr. Holdsworth, smiling, as heparted with them, and disappeared within his clipped yew hedges.'Poor, ill-used Mr. Holdsworth!' cried Aunt Catharine.'Yes, it was base to forget the binding of that book,' said Louis,gravely.  'I wish I knew what amends to make.''You owe amends far more for making a present of a commission.  I usedto do the like, to save myself trouble, till I came down in the world,and then I found it had been a mere air de grand seigneur.''I should not dare to serve you or Jem so; but I thought the school wasimpersonal, and could receive a favour.''It is no favour, unless you clearly define where the commission endedand the gift began.  Careless benefits oblige no one.'Fitzjocelyn received his aunt's scoldings very prettily.  His manner toher was a becoming mixture of the chivalrous, the filial, and theplayful.  Mary watched it as a new and pretty picture.  All hisconfidence, too, seemed to be hers; but who could help pouring out hisheart to the ever-indulgent, sympathizing Aunt Catharine?  It wasevidently the greatest treat to him to have her for his guest, and hisattention to her extended even to the reading a sermon to her in theevening, to spare her eyes; a measure so entirely after Aunt Melicent'sheart, that Mary decided that even she would not think her cousin sohopelessly fashionable.Goodnatured he was, without doubt; for as the three ladies were sittingdown to a sociable morning of work and reading aloud, he came in to sayhe was going to see after Tom Madison, and to ask if there were anycommands for Northwold, with his checked shooting-jacket pockets sopuffed out that his aunt began patting and inquiring. 'Provisions forthe House Beautiful,' he said, as forth came on the one side a longrough brown yam.  'I saw it at a shop in London,' he said, 'and thoughtthe Faithfull sisters would like to be reminded of their West Indianfeasts.'  And, 'to make the balance true,' he had in the other pocket alambswool shawl of gorgeous dyes, with wools to make the like, and thereceipt, in what he called 'female algebra,' the long knitting-pinsunder his arm like a riding-whip.  He explained that he thought itwould be a winter's work for Miss Salome to imitate it, and that shewould succour half-a-dozen families with the proceeds; and Mrs.Ponsonby was pleased to hear him speak so affectionately of the two oldmaiden sisters.  They were the nieces of an old gentleman to whom thecentral and handsomest house of Dynevor Terrace had been let.  He hadan annuity which had died with him, and they inherited very little butthe furniture with which they had lived on in the same house, in hopesof lodgers, and paying rent to Mrs. Frost when they had any.  There wasa close friendship and perfect understanding between her and them, and,as she truly assured them, full and constant rent could hardly havedone her as much good as their neighbourhood.  Miss Mercy was theSister of Charity of all Northwold; Miss Salome, who was confined toher chair by a complaint in her knee, knitted and made fancy-works, thesale of which furnished funds for her charities.  She was highlyeducated, and had a great knowledge of natural history.  Fitzjocelynhad given their abode the name of the House Beautiful, as beingredolent of the essence of the Pilgrim's Progress; and the title was sofully accepted by their friends, that the very postman would soon knowit. He lingered, discoursing on this topic, while Mary repacked hisparcels, and his aunt gave him a message to Jane Beckett, to send thecarpenter to No. 5 before Mary's visit of inspection; but sheprophesied that he would forget; and, in fact, it was no good augurythat he left the knitting-pins behind him on the table, and Mary wasonly just in time to catch him with them at the front door.'Thank you, Mary--you are the universal memory,' he said.  'What restyou must give my father's methodical spirit!  I saw you pile up allthose Blackwoods of mine this morning, just as he was going to fallupon them.''If you saw it, I should have expected you to do it yourself,' saidMary, in her quaint downright manner.'Never expect me to do what is expected,' answered he.'Do you do that because it is not expected?' said Mary, feeling almostas if he were beyond the pale of reason, as she saw him adjusting aplant of groundsel in his cap.'It is for the dicky-bird at my aunt's.  There's no lack of it at theTerrace; but it is an old habit, and there always was an illusion thatOrmersfield groundsel is a superior article.''I suppose that is why you grow go much.''Are you a gardener?  Some day we will go to work, clear the place, andseparate the botanical from the intrusive!''I should like it, of all things!''I'll send the horse round to the stable, and begin at once!' exclaimedLouis, all eagerness; but Mary demurred, as she had promised to read toher mother and aunt some of their old favourites, Madame de Sevigne'sletters, and his attention flew off to his restless steed, which hewanted her to admire.'My Yeomanry charger,' he said.  'We turn out five troopers.  I hopeyou will be here when we go out, for going round to Northwold broughtme into a direful scrape when I went to exhibit myself to the dear oldTerrace world.  My father said it was an unworthy ambition.  What wouldhe have thought, if he had seen Jane stroking me down with the brush onthe plea of dust, but really on the principle of stroking a dog!  Goodold Jane!  Have you seen her yet?  Has she talked to you about MasterOliver?'The horse became so impatient, that Mary had no time for more than amonosyllable, before Louis was obliged to mount and ride off; and hewas seen no more till just before dinner, when, with a shade of Frenchmalice, Mrs. Frost inquired about Jane and the carpenter: she had seenthe cap, still decorated with groundsel, lying in the hall, and had ashrewd suspicion, but the answer went beyond her expectations--'Ah!' hesaid, 'it is all the effect of the Norman mania!''What have you been doing?  What is the matter?' she cried, alarmed.'The matter is not with me, but with the magistrates.''My dear Louis, don't look so very wise and capable, or I shall thinkit a very bad scrape indeed!  Pray tell me what you have been about.''You know Sir Gilbert Brewster and Mr. Shoreland are rabid about thelittle brook between their estates, of which each wishes to arrogate tohimself the exclusive fishing.  Their keepers watch like the Austrianguard on the Danube, in a life of perpetual assault and battery.  LastSaturday, March 3rd, 1847, one Benjamin Hodgekin, aged fifteen, had themisfortune to wash his feet in the debateable water; the belligerentpowers made common cause, and haled the wretch before the PettySessions.  His mother met me.  She lived in service here till shemarried a man at Marksedge, now dead.  This poor boy is an admirableson, the main stay of the family, who must starve if he wereimprisoned, and she declared, with tears in her eyes, that she couldnot bear for a child of hers to be sent to gaol, and begged me to speakto the gentlemen.'  He started up with kindling eyes and vehementmanner.  'I went to the Justice-room!''My dear! with the groundsel?''And the knitting-needles!'On rushed the narration, unheeding trifles.  'There was the array: Mr.Calcott in the chair, and old Freeman, and Captain Shaw, and fat SirGilbert, and all the rest, met to condemn this wretched widow's son forwashing his feet in a gutter!''Pray what said the indictment?' asked Mrs. Ponsonby.'Oh, that he had killed an infant trout of the value of threefarthings!  Three giant keepers made oath to it, but I had his ownmother's word that he was washing his feet!'No one could help laughing, but Fitzjocelyn was far past perceiving anysuch thing.  'Urge what I would, they fined him.  I talked to oldBrewster!  I appealed to his generosity, if there be room forgenerosity about a trout no bigger than a gudgeon!  I talked to Mr.Calcott, who, I thought, had more sense, but Justice Shallow would havebeen more practicable!  No one took a rational view but Ramsbotham ofthe factory, a very sensible man, with excellent feeling.  When it isrecorded in history, who will believe that seven moral, well-meaningmen agreed in condemning a poor lad of fifteen to a fine of fiveshillings, costs three-and-sixpence--a sum he could no more pay than Ithe National Debt, and with the alternative of three months'imprisonment, branding and contaminating for life, and destroying allself-respect?  I paid the fine, so there is one act of destruction theless on the heads of the English squirearchy.''Act of destruction!''The worst destruction is to blast a man's character because the loveof adventure is strong within him--!'He was at this point when Lord Ormersfield entered, and after his dailycivil ceremonious inquiries of the ladies whether they had walked ordriven out, he turned to his son, saying, 'I met Mr. Calcott just now,and heard from him that he had been sorry to convict a person in whomyou took interest, a lad from Marksedge. What did you know of him?''I was prompted by common justice and humanity,' said Louis.  'Myprotection was claimed for the poor boy, as the son of an old servantof ours.''Indeed!  I think you must have been imposed on.  Mr. Calcott spoke ofthe family as notorious poachers.''Find a poor fellow on the wrong side of a hedge, and not a squire butwill swear that he is a hardened ruffian!''Usually with reason,' said the Earl.  'Pray when did this person'sparents allege that they had been in my service?''It was his mother.  Her name was Blackett, and she left us on hermarriage with one of the Hodgekins.'Lord Ormersfield rang the bell, and Frampton, the butler andconfidential servant, formed on his own model, made his appearance.'Do you know whether a woman of the name of Blackett ever lived inservice here?''Not that I am aware of, my Lord.  I will ascertain the fact.'In a few moments Frampton returned.  'Yes, my Lord, a girl namedBlackett was once engaged to help in the scullery, but was dischargedfor dishonesty at the end of a month.''Did not Frampton know that that related to me?' said Louis, sottovoce, to his aunt.  'Did he not trust that he was reducing me from asea anemone to a lump of quaking jelly?'So far from this consummation, Lord Fitzjocelyn looked as triumphant asDon Quixote liberating Gines de Pasamonte.  He and his father mighthave sat for illustrations of'Youth is full of pleasance,Age is full of care,'as they occupied the two ends of the dinner-table; the Earl concealinganxiety and vexation, under more than ordinary punctilious politeness;the Viscount doing his share of the honours with easy, winning graceand attention, and rattling on in an under-tone of lively conversationwith Aunt Catharine.  Mary was silently amazed at her encouraging him;but perhaps she could not help spoiling him the more, because there wasa storm impending.  At least, as soon as she was in the drawing-room,she became restless and nervous, and said that she wished his fathercould see that speaking sternly to him never did any good; besides, itwas mere inconsiderateness, the excess of chivalrous compassion.Mrs. Ponsonby said she thought young men's ardour more apt to beagainst than for the poacher.'I must confess,' said Aunt Catherine, with all the reluctance of ahigh-spirited Dynevor,--'I must confess that Louis is no sportsman! Hewas eager about it once, till he had become a good shot; and then itlost all zest for him, and he prefers his own vagaries.  He never takesa gun unless James drives him out; and, oddly enough, his father isquite vexed at his indifference, as if it were not manly. If his fatherwould only understand him!'The specimen of that day had almost made Mrs. Ponsonby fear that therewas nothing to understand, and that only dear Aunt Kitty's affectioncould perceive anything but amiable folly, and it was not much betterwhen the young gentleman reappeared, looking very debonnaire, and,sitting down beside Mrs. Frost, said, in a voice meant for heralone--'Henry IV; Part II., the insult to Chief Justice Gascoigne.  Myfather will presently enter and address you:'O that it could be provedThat some night-tripping fairy had exchangedIn cradle-cloths our children as they lay,--Call'd yours Fitzjocelyn--mine, Frost Dynevor!''For shame, Louis!  I shall have to call you Fitzjocelyn!  You arebehaving very ill.''Insulting the English constitution in the person of seven squires.''Don't, my dear!  It was the very thing to vex your father that youshould have put yourself in such a position.''Bearding the Northwold bench with a groundsel plume and aknitting-needle:'With a needle for a sword, and a thimble for a hat,Wilt thou fight a traverse with the Castle cat?'The proper champion in such a cause, since 'What cat's averse to fish?'''No, Louis dear,' said his aunt, struggling like a girl to keep hercountenance; 'this is no time for nonsense.  One would think you had nofeeling for your father.''My dear aunt, I can't go to gaol like Prince Hal.  I do assure you, Idid not assault the bench with the knitting-pins.  What am I to do?''Not set at nought your father's displeasure.''I can't help it,' said he, almost sadly, though half smiling.  'Whatwould become of me if I tried to support the full weight? Interferingwith institutions, ruining reputation, blasting bulwarks, patronizingpoachers, vituperating venerated--''Quite true,' cried Aunt Catherine, with spirit.  'You know you had nobusiness there, lecturing a set of men old enough to be yourgrandfathers, and talking them all to death, no doubt.''Well, Aunt Kitty, if oppression maddens the wise, what must it do tothe foolish?''If you only allow that it was foolish--''No; I had rather know whether it was wrong.  I believe I was tooeager, and not respectful enough to the old squire: and, on reflection,it might have been a matter of obedience to my father, not to interferewith the prejudices of true-born English magistrates.  Yes, I waswrong: I would have owned it sooner, but for the shell he fired over myhead.  And for the rest, I don't know how to repent of having protestedagainst tyranny.'There was something redeeming in the conclusion, and it was a comfort,for it was impossible to retain anger with one so gently,good-humouredly polite and attentive.A practical answer to the champion was not long in coming.  Hevolunteered the next day to walk to Northwold with Mrs. Frost and Mary,who wanted to spend the morning in selecting a house in DynevorTerrace, and to be fetched home by-and-by, when Mrs. Ponsonby took herairing.  Two miles seemed nothing to Aunt Catharine, who accepted hernephew's arm for love, and not for need, as he discoursed of all theanimals that might be naturalized in England, obtained from Mary anaccount of the llamas of the Andes, and rode off upon a scheme of animportation to make the fortune of Marksedge by a manufacture of Alpacaumbrellas.Meantime, he must show the beautiful American ducks which he hoped tonaturalize on the pond near the keeper's lodge: but, whistle and callas he would, nothing showed itself but screaming Canada geese.  He ranround, pulled out a boat half full of water, and, with a foot on eachside, paddled across to a bushy island in the centre,--but in vain.The keeper's wife, who had the charge over them, came out: 'Oh, myLord, I am so sorry!  They pretty ducks!''Ha! the foxes?''I wish it was, my Lord; but it is they poachers out at Marksedge thatare so daring, they would come anywheres--and you see the ducks wouldroost up in the trees, and you said I was not to shut 'em up at night.My master was out up by Beech hollow; I heerd a gun, and looked out; Iseen a man and a boy--I'd take my oath it was young Hodgekin.  They dosay Nanny Hodgekin, she as was one of the Blacketts, whose husband wastransported, took in two ducks next morning to Northwold.  Warrencouldn't make nothing of it; but if ever he meets that Hodgekin again,he says he shall catch it!''Well, Mrs. Warren, it can't be helped--thank you for the good care youtook of the poor ducks,' said Louis, kindly; and as he walked onthrough the gate, he gave a long sigh, and said, 'My dainty ducks! Sothere's an end of them, and all their tameness!'  But the smile couldnot but return.  'It is lucky the case does not come before the bench!but really that woman deserves a medal for coolness!''I suppose,' said Mary, 'she could have paid the fine with the price ofthe ducks.''Ah! the beauties!  I wish Mr. Hodgekin had fallen on the pheasantsinstead!  However, I am thankful he and Warren did not come to acollision about them.  I am always expecting that, having made thoseMarksedge people thieves, murder will be the next consequence.'A few seconds sufficed to bring the ludicrous back.  'How pat it comes!Mary, did you prime Mrs. Warren, or did Frampton?''I believe you had rather laugh at yourself than at any one else,'exclaimed his aunt, who felt baffled at having thrown away hercompassion.'Of course.  One knows how much can be borne.  Why, Mary, has that setyou studying,--do you dissent?''I was thinking whether it is the best thing to be always ready tolaugh at oneself,' said Mary.  'Does it always help in mending?'''Don't care' came to a bad end,' said Louis; 'but on the other hand,care killed a cat--so there are two sides to the question.'While Mary was feeling disappointed at his light tone, he changed it toone that was almost mournful.  'The worst of it is, that 'don't care'is my refuge.  Whatever I do care about is always thwarted by Framptonor somebody, and being for ever thrown over, I have only to fall assoftly as I can.''You know, my dear,' said Mrs. Frost, 'that your father has no commandof means to gratify you.''There are means enough for ourselves,' said Louis; 'that is theneedful duty.  What merely personal indulgence did I ever ask for thatwas refused me?''If that is all you have to complain of, I can't pity you,' said Mary.'Listen, Mary.  Let me wish for a horse, there it is!  Let me wish fora painted window, we can't afford it, though, after all, it would noteat; but horses are an adjunct of state and propriety.  So again, theparish feasted last 18th of January, because I came of age, and it wasproper; while if I ask that our people may be released from work onGood Friday or Ascension Day, it is thought outrageous.''If I remember right, my dear,' interposed his aunt, 'you wanted nowork to be done on any saint's-day.  Was there not a scheme that Mr.Holdsworth called the cricket cure!''That may yet be.  No one knows the good a few free days would do thepoor.  But I developed my plan too rapidly!  I'll try again for theirchurch-going on Good Friday.''I think you ought to succeed there.''I know how it will be.  My father will ring, propound the matter toFrampton; the answer will be, 'Quite impracticable, my Lord,' and therewill be an end of it.''Perhaps not.  At least it will have been considered,' said Mary.'True,' said Louis; 'but you little know what it is to have a Frampton!If he be a fair sample of prime ministers, no wonder Princes of Walesgo into the opposition!''I thought Frampton was a very valuable superior servant.''Exactly so.  That is the worst of it.  He is supreme authority, andwell deserves it.  When la Grande Mademoiselle stood before the gatesof Orleans calling to the sentinel to open them, he never stirred astep, but replied merely with profound bows.  That is my case.  I makea request, am answered, 'Yes, my Lord;' find no results, repeat theprocess, and at the fourth time am silenced with, 'Quite impracticablemy Lord.'''Surely Frampton is respectful?''It is his very essence.  He is a thorough aristocrat, respectinghimself, and therefore respecting all others as they deserve.  Herespects a Viscount Fitzjocelyn as an appendage nearly as needful asthe wyverns on each side of the shield; but as to the individualholding that office, he regards him much as he would one of the wyvernswith a fool's-cap on.'And with those words, Fitzjocelyn had sprung into the hedge to gatherthe earliest willow-catkins, and came down dilating on their silvery,downy buds and golden blossoms, and on the pleasure they would giveMiss Faithfull, till Mary, who had been beginning to compassionate him,was almost vexed to think her pity wasted on grievances of mere randomtalk.Warm and kindly was his greeting of his aunt's good old servant, JaneBeckett, whom Mary was well pleased to meet as one of the kind friendsof her childhood.  The refinement that was like an atmosphere aroundMrs. Frost, seemed to have extended even to her servants; for Jane,though she could hardly read, and carried her accounts in her head, hadmanners of a gentle warmth and propriety that had a grace of their own,even in her racy, bad grammar; and there was no withstanding the merrysmile that twitched up one side of her mouth, while her eyes twinkledin the varied moods prompted by an inexhaustible fund of good temper,sympathy, and affection, but the fulness of her love was for thedistant 'Master Oliver,' whose young nursery-maid she had been.  Hereyes winked between tears and smiles when she heard that Miss Mary hadseen him but five months ago, and she inquired after him, gloried inhis prosperity, and talked of his coming home, with far less reservethan his mother had done.Mary was struck, also, with the pretty, modest looks of the littleunderling, and remarked on them as they proceeded to the inspection ofthe next house.'Yes,' said Louis, 'Charlotte is something between a wood sorrel and afive-plume moth.  Tom Madison, as usual, shows exquisite taste. She isa perfect Lady of Eschalott.''Now, Louis!' said his aunt, standing still, and really lookingannoyed, 'you know I cannot encourage any such thing.  Poor littleCharlotte is an orphan, and I am all the more responsible for her.''There's a chivalry in poor Tom--''Nonsense!' said his aunt, as if resolved not to hear him out, becauseafraid of herself.  'Don't say any more about it.  I wish I had neverallowed of his bringing your messages.''Who set him down in the kitchen to drink a cup of beer?' said Louis,mischievously.'Ah! well! one comfort is, that girls never care for boys of the sameage,' replied Aunt Catharine, as she turned the key, and admitted theminto No. 7; when Fitzjocelyn confused Mary's judgment with hisrecommendations, till Aunt Catharine pointing out the broken shutter,and asking if he would not have been better employed in fetching thecarpenter, than in hectoring the magistrates, he promised to make upfor it, fetched a piece of wood and James's tools, and was quickly atwork, his Aunt only warning him, that if he lost Jem's tools she wouldnot say it was her fault.By the time Mary's imagination had portrayed what paper, paint,furniture, and habitation might make the house, and had discerned howto arrange a pretty little study in case of her father's return; he hadcompleted the repair in a workmanlike manner, and putting two fingersto his cap, asked, 'Any other little job for me, ma'am?'Of course, he forgot the tools, till shamed by Mary's turning back forthem, and after a merry luncheon, served up in haste by Jane, theybetook themselves to Number 8, where the Miss Faithfulls were seated ata dessert of hard biscuits and water, of neither of which they everpartook: they only adhered to the hereditary institution of sitting fortwenty minutes after dinner with their red and purple doileys beforethem.Mary seemed to herself carried back fourteen years, and to understandwhy her childish fancy had always believed Christiana's Mercy a livingcharacter, when she found herself in the calm, happy little household.The chief change was that she must now bend down, instead of reachingup, to receive the kind embraces.  Even the garments seemed unchanged,the dark merino gowns, black silk aprons, white cap-ribbons, the softlittle Indian shawl worn by the elder sister, the ribbon bow by theyounger, distinctions that used to puzzle her infant speculation, notaware that the coloured bow was Miss Mercy's ensign of youth, and thatits absence would have made Miss Salome feel aged indeed.  The twosisters were much alike--but the younger was the more spare, shrivelledup into a cheery nonpareil, her bloom changed into something quite asfresh and healthful, and her blithe tripping step always active, exceptwhen her fingers were nimbly taking their turn.  Miss Salome had becomemore plump, her cheek was smoother and paler, her eye more placid, herair that of a patient invalid, and her countenance more intellectualthan her sister's. She said less about their extreme enjoyment of theyam, and while Mrs. Frost and Mary held counsel with Miss Mercy onservants and furniture, there was a talk on entomology going on betweenher and Fitzjocelyn.It was very pretty to see him with the old ladies, so gently attentive,without patronizing, and they, though evidently doting on him, laughingat him, and treating him like a spoilt child.   He insisted on Mary'sseeing their ordinary sitting room, which nature had intended for ahousekeeper's room, but which ladylike inhabitants had rendered what hecalled the very 'kernel of the House Beautiful.' There were the standsof flowers in the window; the bullfinch scolding in his cage, the rareold shells and china on the old-fashioned cabinets that Mary so wellremembered; and the silk patchwork sofa-cover, the old piano, and MissFaithfull's arm chair by the fire, her little table with her beautifulknitting, and often a flower or insect that she was copying; for shestill drew nicely; and she smiled and consented, as Louis pulled outher portfolios, life-long collections of portraits of birds, flowers,or insects. Her knitting found a sale at the workshop, where the objectwas well known, and the proceeds were diffused by her sister, andwhether she deserved her name might be guessed by the basket of poorpeople's stores beside her chair.Miss Mercy was well known in every dusky Northwold lane or alley, whereshe always found or made a welcome for herself.  The kindly counsel andready hand were more potent than far larger means without them.Such neighbours were in themselves a host, and Mary and her mother bothfelt as if they had attained a region of unwonted tranquillity andrepose, when they had agreed to rent No. 5, Dynevor Terrace, from theensuing Lady-day, and to take possession when carpenters andupholsterers should have worked their will.Louis was half-way home when he exclaimed, 'There! I have missed TomMadison a second time.  When shall I ever remember him at the righttime?'Little did Louis guess the effect his neglect was taking!  CharlotteArnold might have told, for Mrs. Martha had brought in stories of hisunsteadiness and idle habits that confirmed her in her obedience toJane.  She never went out alone in his leisure hours; never looked forhim in returning from church--alas! that was not the place to look forhim now.  And yet she could not believe him such a very bad boy as shewas told he had become.CHAPTER V.THE TWO MINISTERS.'The creature's neither one nor t'other.I caught the animal last night,And viewed him o'er by candle-light;I marked him well, 'twas black as jet.You stare, but sirs, I've got him yet,And can produce him.'  'Pray, sir, do;I'll lay my life the thing is blue.''And I'll be sworn, that when you've seenThe reptile, you'll pronounce him green.''Well, then, at once to end the doubt,'Replies the man, 'I'll turn him out;And when before your eyes I've set him,If you don't find him black, I'll eat him.'He said--then, full before their sightProduced the beast, and lo! 'twas white!MERRICK.Mrs. Ponsonby had seen in the tropics birds of brilliant hues, thateven, whilst the gazer pronounced them all one beaming tint of gorgeouspurple, would give one flutter, and in another light would flash withgolden green or fiery scarlet.  No less startling and unexpected werethe aspects of Lord Fitzjocelyn, 'Every thing by starts, and nothinglong;' sometimes absorbed in study, sometimes equally ardent over achildish game; wild about philanthropic plans, and apparentlyforgetting them the instant a cold word had fallen on them; attemptingeverything, finishing nothing; dipping into every kind of book, andforsaking it after a cursory glance; ever busy, yet ever idle; full ofdesultory knowledge, ranging through all kinds of reading and naturalhistory, and still more full of talk.  This last was perhaps his mostdecided gift.  To any one, of whatever degree, he would talk, he couldhardly have been silent ten minutes with any human being, exceptFrampton or his father, and whether deep reflections or arrant nonsensecame out of his mouth, seemed an even chance, though both alike were inthe same soft low voice, and with the same air of quaint pensivesimplicity.  He was exceedingly provoking, and yet there was no beingprovoked with him!He was so sincere, affectionate, and obliging, that not to love him wasimpossible, yet that love only made his faults more annoying, and Mrs.Ponsonby could well understand his father's perpetual restless anxiety,for his foibles were exactly of the sort most likely to tease such aman as the Earl, and the most positively unsatisfactory part of hischaracter was the insouciance that he displayed when his trifling orhis wild projects had given umbrage.  Yet, even here, she could not butfeel a hope, such as it was, that the carelessness might be the effectof want of sympathy and visible affection from his father, whose veryanxiety made him the more unbending; and that, what a worse tempermight have resented, rendered a good one gaily reckless and unheeding.She often wondered whether she should try to give a hint--but LordOrmersfield seemed to dread leading to the subject, although on allelse that interested him he came to her as in old times, and seemedgreatly refreshed and softened by her companionship.An old friend and former fellow-minister had proposed spending a nightat Ormersfield.  He was the person whom the Earl most highly esteemed,and, in his own dignified way, he was solicitous that the householdshould be in more than usually perfect order, holding a long conferencewith the man of whom he was sure, Frampton.  Would that he could havebeen equally sure of his son!  He looked at him almost wistfullyseveral times during breakfast, and at last, as they rose, gave anexhortation 'that he would be punctual to dinner at half-past seven,which would give him ample time, and he hoped he would be--' He pausedfor a word, and his son supplied it.  'On my good behaviour, Iunderstand.'  With that he walked off, leaving Lord Ormersfield tellingMrs. Ponsonby that it was the first introduction, as he had 'forvarious reasons' thought it undesirable to bring Fitzjocelyn early toLondon, and betraying his own anxiety as to the impression he mightproduce on Sir Miles Oakstead.  His own perplexity and despondencyshowed themselves in his desire to view his son with the eyes ofothers, and he also thought the tenor of Fitzjocelyn's future lifemight be coloured by his friend's opinion.Evening brought the guest.  Mrs. Ponsonby was not well enough to appearat dinner, but Mary and Mrs. Frost, pleased to see an historicalcharacter, were in the drawing-room, enjoying Sir Miles's agreeableconversation, until they caught certain misgivings reflected in eachother's looks, as time wore on and nothing had been seen or heard ofLouis.  The half-hour struck; the Earl waited five minutes, then rangthe bell.  'Is Lord Fitzjocelyn come in?''No, my Lord.''Bring in the dinner.'Mary longed to fly in search of him, and spare further vexation.  Shehad assumed all an elder sister's feelings, and suffered for him as sheused to do, when he was in disgrace and would not heed it.  She heardno more of the conversation, and was insensible to the honour of goingin to dinner with the late Secretary of State, as she saw the emptyplace at the table.The soup was over, when she was aware of a step in the hall, and besideher stood a grey figure, bespattered with mud, shading his eyes withhis hand, as if dazzled by the lights.  'I beg your pardon,' were thewords, 'but I was obliged to go to Northwold.  I have shot arose-coloured pastor!''Shot him!' cried Mary.  'Was he much hurt?''Killed!  I took him to Miss Faithfull, to be sketched before he isstuffed--'A clearer view of the company, a wave of the hand from the Earl, andthe young gentleman was gone.  Next he opened the library door, saying,'Here's my pretty behaviour!''Louis! what is the matter?' cried Mrs. Ponsonby.'I entirely forgot the right honourable, and marched into thedining-room to tell Aunt Catharine that I have killed a rose-colouredpastor.''Killed what?''A bird, hardly ever seen in England.  I spied him in the fir-wood,went to Warren for a gun, brought him down, and walked on to the HouseBeautiful, where Miss Faithfull was enchanted.  She will copy him, andsend him to the bird-stuffer.  I looked in to give directions, and oldJenyns was amazed; he never knew one shot here before, so early in theyear too.  He says we must send the account to the Ornithological--''Do you know how wet you are?  exclaimed Mrs. Ponsonby, seeing rivuletsdropping from his coat.'I see.  It rained all the way home, and was so dark, I could not seethe footpath; and when I came in, my eyes were blinded by the light,and my head so full of the pastor, that the other minister neveroccurred to me, and remains under the impression that I have confesseda sacrilegious murder.''You really are incorrigible!' cried Mrs. Ponsonby.  'Why are you notdressing for dinner?''Because you are going to give me a cup of your tea.''Certainly not.  I shall begin to think you purposely mortified yourfather, when you know he wanted you to be reasonable.''The lower species never show off well to strangers,' said Fitzjocelyn,coolly; but, as he lighted his candle, he added, with more candour, 'Ibeg your pardon--indeed I did not do this on purpose, but don't sayanything about appearances--there's something in me that is sure torevolt.'So noiselessly that the moment was unknown, the vacant chair was filledby a gentleman irreproachably attired, his face glowing with exercise,or with what made him very debonnaire and really silent, dining rapidlyand unobtrusively, and never raising his eyes even to his aunt,probably intending thus to remain all the evening; but presently SirMiles turned to him and said, 'Pray satisfy my curiosity.  Who is therose-coloured pastor?'Louis raised his eyes, and meeting a pleasing, sensible face, outbeamed his arch look of suppressed fun as he answered, 'He is not atall clerical.  He is otherwise called the rose-coloured ouzel orstarling.''Whence is that other startling name?''From his attending flocks of sheep, on the same mission as jackdawsfulfil here--which likewise have an ecclesiastical reputation--'A great frequenter of the church.''Fearing alike nonsense and ornithology, Lord Ormersfield changed thesubject, and Louis subsided, but when the gentlemen came into thedrawing-room, Mrs. Ponsonby was surprised to see him taking a fairshare, and no more, of the conversation.  Some information had beenwanted about the terms of labour in the mining districts, and Louis'svisit to Illershall enabled him to throw light on the subject, withmuch clearness and accuracy.  Sir Miles had more literature than LordOrmersfield, and was more used to young men; and he began to drawFitzjocelyn out, with complete success.  Louis fully responded to thetouch, and without a notion that he was showing himself to the bestadvantage, he yielded to the pleasure, and for once proved of what hewas capable--revealing unawares an unusual amount of intelligence andobservation, and great power of expression.  Not even his aunt had everseen him appear so much like a superior man, and the only alloy was hisfather's, ill-repressed dread lest he should fall on dangerous ground,and commit himself either to his wildly philanthropical orextravagantly monarchical views, whichever might happen to be in theascendant.  However, such shoals were not approached, nor did Louisever plunge out of his depth.  The whole of his manner and demeanourwere proofs that, in his case, much talk sprang from exuberance ofideas, not from self-conceit.He was equally good in the morning: he had risen early to hunt up someinformation which Sir Miles wanted, and the clearness and readinesswith which he had found it were wonderful.  The guest was delightedwith him; gave him a warm invitation to Oakstead, and on being leftalone with Mrs. Ponsonby, whom he had formerly known, expressed hisadmiration of his friend's son--as a fine, promising young man, ofgreat ability and originality, and, what was still more remarkable, ofmost simple, natural manners, perfectly free from conceit.  He seemedthe more amazed, when he found, what he would hardly believe, thatFitzjocelyn was twenty-one, and had nearly finished his universityeducation.The liking was mutual.  No sooner had Sir Miles departed, than Louiscame to the library in a rapture, declaring that here was therefreshing sight of a man unspoilt by political life, which usually ateout the hearts of people.Mary smiled at this, and told him that he was talking 'like an oldstatesman weary of the world.''One may be weary of the world beforehand as well as after,' said he.'That does not seem worth while,' said Mary.'No,' he said, 'but one's own immediate look-out may not be flattering,whatever the next turn may bring;' and he took up the newspaper, andbegan to turn it over.  ''As butler--as single-handed man--as clerk andaccountant.'  There, those are the lucky men, with downright work, andsome one to work for.  Or, just listen to this!' and he plunged into astory of some heroic conduct during a shipwreck.  While he was readingit aloud, with kindling eyes and enthusiastic interest, his fatheropened the door.  'Louis,' he said, 'if you are doing nothing, I shouldbe obliged if you would make two copies of this letter.'Louis glanced at the end of what he was reading, laid the paper down,and opened a blotting-book.'You had better come into the study, or you will not write correctly.''I can write, whatever goes on.''I particularly wish this to be legible and accurate.  You have beguntoo low down.'Louis took another sheet.'That pen is not fit to write with.''The pens are delusions,' said Louis, trying them round, in an easy,idle way: 'I never could mend a quill!  How is this steel one? Refusesto recognise the purpose of his existence.  Aunt Catherine, do youstill forbid steel pens in your school?  If so, it must be the solitaryinstance.  How geese must cackle blessings on the inventor! He shouldhave a testimonial--a silver inkstand representing the goose that laidthe golden eggs,--and all writing-masters should subscribe.  Ha! wheredid this pen come from?  Mary, were you the bounteous mender!  Athousand thanks.'If Louis fretted his father by loitering and nonsense, his father wasno less trying by standing over him with advice and criticisms whichwould have driven most youths beyond patience, but which he bore withconstant good-humour, till his father returned to the study, when heexclaimed, 'Now, Mary, if you like to finish the wreck, it will notinterrupt me.  This is mere machine-work.''Thank you,' said Mary; 'I should like it better afterwards.  Do youthink I might do one copy for you?  Or would it not suit LordOrmersfield?'Louis made polite demurs, but she overruled them and began.He stretched himself, took up his Times, and skimmed the remainingincidents of the shipwreck, till he was shamed by seeing Mary half-waydown the first page, when he resumed his pen, overtook her, and thenrelapsed into talk, till Mrs. Frost fairly left the room, to silencehim.As the two copies were completed, Lord Ormersfield returned; and Mary,with many apologies, presented her copy, and received most graciousthanks and compliments on her firm, clear writing, a vexation to herrather than otherwise, since 'Fitzjocelyn' was called to account fordubious scrawls, errors, and erasures.He meekly took another sheet, consoling himself, however, by saying, 'Iwarn you that pains will only make it Miss Fanny.''What do you mean?'As if glad to be instigated, he replied, 'Did you never hear of mysignature being mistaken by an ingenious person, who addressed hisanswer to 'Miss Fanny Jocelyn?  Why, Fanny has been one of Jem'sregular names for me ever since!  I have the envelope somewhere as acuriosity.  I'll show it to you, Mary.''You seem to be proud of it!' exclaimed his father, nearly out ofpatience.  'Pray tell me whether you intend to copy this creditably ornot.''I will endeavour, but the Fates must decide.  I can scrawl, or, withpains, I can imitate Miss Fanny; but the other alternative only comesin happy moments.''Do you mean that you cannot write well if you choose?''It is like other arts--an inspiration.  Dogberry was deep when he saidit came by nature.''Then make no more attempts.  No.  That schoolgirl's niggle is worsethan the first.''Fanny, as I told you,' said Louis, looking vacantly up in resigneddespair, yet not without the lurking expression of amusement, 'I willtry again.''No, I thank you.  I will have no more time wasted.'Louis passively moved to the window, where he exclaimed that he sawAunt Catharine sunning herself in the garden, and must go and help her.'Did you ever see anything like that?' cried Lord Ormersfield,thoroughly moved to displeasure.'There was at least good-humour,' said Mrs. Ponsonby.  'Pardon me,there was almost as much to try his temper as yours.''He is insensible!''I think not.  A word from Aunt Catharine rules him.''Though you counselled it, Mary, I doubt whether her training hasanswered.  Henry Frost should have been a warning.'Mary found herself blundering in her new copy, and retreated with it tothe study, while her mother made answer: 'I do not repent of my advice.The affection between him and Aunt Catherine is the greatest blessingto him.''Poor boy!' said his father, forgetting his letters as he stoodpondering.  Mrs. Ponsonby seized the moment for reporting Sir Miles'sopinion, but the Earl did not betray his gratification.  'First sight!'he said.  'Last night and this afternoon he is as unlike as these are,'and he placed before her Louis's unlucky copies, together with a letterwritten in a bold, manly hand.  'Three different men might have writtenthese!  And he pretends he cannot write like this, if he please!''I have no doubt it is to a certain extent true.  Yes, absolutely true.You do not conceive the influence that mood has on some charactersbefore they have learnt to master themselves.  I do not mean temper,but the mere frame of spirits.  Even sense of restraint will often takeaway the actual power from a child, or where there is not a strongwill.''You are right!' said he, becoming rigid as if with pain.  'He is achild!  You have not yet told me what you think of him.  You need nothesitate.  No one sees the likeness more plainly than I do.''It is strong externally,' she said; 'but I think it is more externalthan real, more temperament than character.''You are too metaphysical for me, Mary;' and he would fain have smiled.'I want you to be hopeful.  Half the object would be attained if youwere, and he really deserves that you should.''He will not let me.  If I hope at one moment, I am disappointed thenext.''And how?  By nothing worse than boyishness.  You confirm what my aunttells me, that there has never been a serious complaint of him.''Never.  His conduct has always been blameless; but every tutor hassaid the same--that he has no application, and allows himself to besurpassed by any one of moderate energy!''Blameless conduct!  How many fathers would give worlds to be able togive such a character of a son!''There are faults that are the very indications of a manly spirit,'began the Earl, impatiently.  'Not that I mean that I wish--he hasnever given me any trouble--but just look at James Frost, and you wouldsee what I mean!  There's energy in him--fire--independence; you feelthere is substance in him, and like him the better for having a willand way of his own.''So, I think, has Louis; but it is so often thwarted, that it sinksaway under the sense of duty and submission.''If there were any consistency or reason in his fancies, they would notgive way so easily; but it is all talk, all extravagant notions--hereone day, gone the next.  Not a spark of ambition!''Ambition is not so safe a spark that we should wish to see it lighted.''A man must wish to see his son hold his proper station, and aim high!No one can be satisfied to see him a trifler.''I have been trying to find out why he trifles.  As far as I can see,he has no ambition, and I do not think his turn will be for a life likeyours.  His bent is towards what is to do good to others.  He wouldmake an admirable country gentleman.''A mere farmer, idling away his time in his fields.''No; doing infinite good by example and influence, and coming forwardwhenever duty required it.  Depend upon it, the benefit to others isthe impulse which can work on Louis, not personal ambition.  Birth hasalready given him more than he values.''You may be right,' said Lord Ormersfield, 'but it is hard to see somany advantages thrown away, and what sometimes seems like so muchability wasted.  But who can tell? he is never the same for an hourtogether.''May it not be for want of a sphere of wholesome action?''He is not fit for it, Mary.  You know I resolved that the wholeburthen of our losses should fall on me; I made it my object that heshould not suffer, and should freely have whatever I had at the sameage.  Everything is cleared at last.  I could give him the same incomeas I started in life with; but he is so reckless of money, that Icannot feel justified in putting it into his hands.  Say what I will,not a vacation occurs but he comes to tell me of some paltry debt often or fifteen pounds.''He comes to tell you!  Nay, never say he has no resolution!  Suchdebts as those, what are they compared with other young men's, of whichthey do not tell their fathers?''If he were like other youths, I should know how to deal with him. Butyou agree with me, he is not fit to have a larger sum in his hands.''Perhaps not; he is too impulsive and inexperienced.  If you were toask me how to make it conduce to his happiness, I should say, lay outmore on the estate, so as to employ more men, and make improvements inwhich he would take interest.''I cannot make him care for the estate.  Last winter, when he came ofage, I tried to explain the state of affairs; but he was utterlyindifferent--would not trouble himself to understand the papers he wasto sign, and made me quite ashamed of such an exhibition beforeRichardson.''I wish I could defend him!  And yet--you will think me unreasonable,but I do believe that if he had thought the welfare of others wasconcerned, he would have attended more.''Umph!''I am not sure that it is not his good qualities that make him so hardto deal with.  The want of selfishness and vanity seem to take away twocommon springs of action, but I do believe that patience will bring outsomething much higher when you have found the way to reach it.''That I certainly have not, if it be there!''To cultivate his sympathies with you,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, hesitating,and not venturing to look into his face.'Enough, Mary,' he said, hastily.  You said the like to me once before.''But,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, firmly, 'here there is a foundation towork on.  There are affections that only need to be drawn out to makeyou happy, and him--not, perhaps, what you now wish, but better thanyou wish.'His face had become hard as he answered, 'Thank you, Mary; you havealways meant the best.  You have always been kind to me, and to allbelonging to me.'Her heart ached for the father and son, understanding each other solittle, and paining each other so much, and she feared that the Earl'smind had been too much cramped, and his feelings too much chilled, forsuch softening on his part as could alone, as it seemed, prevent Louisfrom being estranged, and left to his naturally fickle and indolentdisposition.Mary had in the mean time completed her copies, and left them on theEarl's table; and wishing neither to be thanked nor contrasted withLouis, she put on her bonnet, to go in search of Aunt Catharine.  Notfinding her in the garden, she decided on visiting old Gervas and hiswife, who had gladly caught at her offer of reading to them.  The visitover, she returned by the favourite path above Ferny dell, gatheringprimroses, and meditating how to stir up Louis to finish off his rockysteps, and make one piece of work complete.  She paused at the summitof them, and was much inclined to descend and examine what was wanting,when she started at hearing a rustling beneath, then a low moan and anattempt at a call.  The bushes and a projecting rock cut off her view;but, in some trepidation, she called out, 'Is any one there?'  Littledid she expect the answer--'It is I--Fitzjocelyn.  Come!--I have had a fall.''I'm coming--are you hurt?' she cried, as with shaking limbs sheprepared to begin the descent.'Not that way,' he called; 'it gave way--go to the left.'She was almost disobeying; but, recalling herself to thought, shehurried along the top till the bank became practicable, and tore herway through brake and brier, till she could return along the side ofthe stream.Horror-struck, she perceived that a heavy stone had given way androlled down, bearing Louis with it, to the bottom, where he lay,ghastly and helpless.  She called to him; and he tried to raisehimself, but sank back.  'Mary! is it you?  I thought I should havedied here,' he said; as she knelt by him, exclaiming, 'Oh, Louis!Louis! what a dreadful fall!''It is my fault,' he eagerly interrupted.  'I am glad it has happenedto no one else.''And you are terribly hurt! I must go for help! but what can I do foryou?  Would you like some water?'Water!  Oh! I have heard it all this time gurgling there!'She filled his cap, and bathed his face, apparently to his greatrelief, and she ventured to ask if he had been long there.'Very long!' he said.  'I must have fainted after I got the stone offmy foot, so I missed Gervas going by.  I thought no one else would comenear.  Thank God!'Mary almost grew sick as she saw how dreadfully his left ankle had beencrushed by a heavy stone; and her very turning towards it made himshudder, and say, 'Don't touch me!  I am shattered all over.''I am afraid I should only hurt you,' she said, with difficultycontrolling herself.  'I had better fetch some one.'He did not know how to be left again; but the damp chilliness of hishands made her the more anxious to procure assistance, and, afterspreading her shawl over him, she made the utmost speed out of thethicket.  As she emerged, she saw Lord Ormersfield riding with hisgroom, and her scream and sign arrested him; but, by the time they met,she could utter nothing but 'Louis!''Another accident!' was the almost impatient answer.'He is dreadfully hurt!' she said, sobbing and breathless.  'His footis crushed!  He has been there this hour!'The alarm was indeed given.  The Earl seemed about to rush away withoutknowing whither; and she had absolutely to withhold him, while,summoning her faculties, she gave directions to Poynings. Then she lethim draw her on, too fast for speaking, until they reached the spotwhere Louis lay, so spent with pain and cold, that he barely opened hiseyes at their voices, made no distinct answers as to his hurts, andshrank and moaned when his father would have raised him.Mary contrived to place his head on her lap, bathed his forehead andchafed his hands, while Lord Ormersfield stood watching him with looksof misery, or paced about, anxiously looking for the servants.They came at last, all too soon for poor Louis, who suffered terriblyin the transport, and gave few tokens of consciousness, except a crynow and then extorted by a rougher movement.None of the household, scarcely even Mrs. Frost, seemed at first to beable to believe that Lord Fitzjocelyn could really have hurt himselfseriously.  'Again!' was the first word of every one, for his manyslight accidents were treated like crying 'Wolf;' but Frampton himselflooked perfectly pale and shocked when he perceived how the matterreally stood; and neither he nor Lord Ormersfield was half so helpfulas Mrs. Frost.  The shock only called out her energy in behalf of herdarling, and, tender as her nature was, she shrank from nothing thatcould soothe and alleviate his suffering; and it did infinitely comforthim, as he held her hand and looked with affection into her face, evenin the extremity of pain.Fain would others have been the same support; but his father, thoughnot leaving him, was completely unnerved, and unable to do anything;and Mrs. Ponsonby was suffering under one of the attacks that werebrought on by any sudden agitation.  Mary, though giddy and throbbingin every pulse, was forced to put a resolute check on herself--braceher limbs, steady her voice, and keep her face composed, while everyfaculty was absorbed in listening for sounds from her cousin's room,and her heart was quivering with an anguish of prayer and suspense.Could she but hide her burning cheeks for one moment, let out one ofthe sobs that seemed to be rending her breast, throw herself on herknees and burst into tears, what an infinite relief it would be!  ButMary had learnt to spend her life in having no self.CHAPTER VI.FAREWELLS.What yet is there that I should do,Lingering in this darksome vale?Proud and mighty, fair to view,Are our schemes, and yet they fail,Like the sand before the wind,That no power of man can bind.ARNDT, Lyra Germanica.Dynevor Terrace was said to have dark, damp kitchens, but by none whohad ever been in No. 5, when the little compact fire was compressed toone glowing red crater of cinders, their smile laughing ruddily backfrom the bright array on the dresser, the drugget laid down, the roundoaken table brought forward, and Jane Beckett, in afternoon trim,tending her geraniums, the offspring of the parting Cheveleigh nosegay,or gauffreing her mistress's caps.  No wonder that on raw evenings,Master James, Miss Clara, or my young Lord, had often been foundgossiping with Jane, toasting their own cheeks as well as the bread, orpinching their fingers in her gauffreing machine.Yet, poor little Charlotte Arnold learnt that the kitchen could bedreary, when Mrs. Beckett had been summoned to nurse Lord Fitzjocelyn,and she remained in sole charge, under Mrs. Martha's occasionalsupervision.  She found herself, her household cares over all too soon,on a cold light March afternoon, with the clock ticking loud enough formidnight, the smoke-jack indulging in supernatural groans, and thewhole lonely house full of undefined terrors, with an unlimited spaceof the like solitude before her.  She would even have been glad to besure of an evening of Mrs. Martha's good advice, and of darningstockings!  She sat down by the round table to Mr. James's wristbands;but every creak or crack of the furniture made her start, and think ofdeath-watches.  She might have learnt to contemn superstition, but thatdid not prevent it from affecting her nerves.She spread her favourite study, The Old English Baron, on the tablebefore her; but the hero had some connexion in her mind with TomMadison, for whom she had always coveted a battle-field in France. Whatwould he feel when he heard how he had filled up his course of evil,being well-nigh the death of his benefactor!  If any one ought to behaunted, it would assuredly be no other than Tom!Chills running over her at the thought, she turned to the fire as thething nearest life, but at the moment started at a hollow call of herown name.  A face was looking in at her through the geraniums!  Sheshrieked aloud, and clasped her hands over her eyes.'Don't make a row.  Open the door!'It was such a relief to hear something unghostly, that she sprang tothe door; but as she undid it, all her scruples seized her, and shetried to hold it, saying, 'Don't come in!  You unfortunate boy, do youknow what you have done?'But Tom Madison was in a mood to which her female nature cowered.  Hepushed the door open, saying authoritatively, 'Tell me how he is!''He is as ill as he can be to be alive,' said Charlotte, actuated atonce by the importance of being the repository of such tidings, and bythe excitement of communicating them to one so deeply concerned. 'Mr.Poynings came in to fetch Mrs. Beckett--he would have no one else tonurse him--and he says the old Lord and Missus have never had theirclothes off these two nights.''Then, was it along of them stones?' asked the lad, hoarsely.'Yourself should know best!' returned Charlotte.  'Mr. Poynings says'twas a piece of rock as big as that warming-pan as crushed his ankle!and you know--''I know nothing,' said Tom.  'Master kept me in all day yesterday, andI only heard just now at Little Northwold, where I've been to take homesome knives of Squire Calcott's.  Master may blow me up if he likes,but I couldn't come till I'd heard the rights of it.  Is he so verybad?''They've sent up to London for a doctor,' pursued Charlotte.  'Mr.Walby don't give but little hope of him.  Poor young gentleman, I'msure he had a good word from high and low!''Well! I'm gone!' cried Tom, vehemently.  'Goodbye to you, CharlotteArnold!  You'll never see me in these parts more!''Gone!  Oh, Tom! what do you mean!''D'ye think I'll stay here to have this here cast in my face?  Such aone as won't never walk the earth again!' and he burst out intopassionate tears.  'I wish I was dead!''Oh, hush, Tom!--that is wicked!''May be so!  I am all that's wicked, and you all turn against me!''I don't turn against you,' sobbed Charlotte, moved to the bottom ofher gentle heart.'You! you turned against me long ago.  You've been too proud to castone look at me these three months; and he forgot me; and that's whatdrew me on, when who cared what became of me--nor I neither now.''Don't speak that way!  Don't say 'twas pride.  Oh no! but I had tobehave proper, and how should I keep up acquaintance when they said youwent on--unsteady--''Aye, aye!  I know how it is,' said poor Tom, with broken-downhumility: 'I was not fit for you then, and I'm next thing to a murderernow; and you're like a white dove that the very fingers of me wouldgrime.  I'll take myself out of your way; but, let what will come ofme, I'll never forget you, Charlotte.''Oh, wait, Tom!  If I could but say it right!--Oh! I know there'ssomething about biding patiently, and getting a blessing--if you'd onlystop while I recollect it.''I thought I heard voices!' exclaimed Mrs. Martha, suddenly descendingon them.  'I wonder you aren't ashamed of yourselves, and the family insuch trouble!  Downright owdacious!''Be this your house?' said Tom, stepping before Charlotte, hisdejection giving way instantly to rude independence.'Oh, very well,' said Martha, with dignity.  'I know what to expectfrom such sort of people.  The house and young woman is in my charge,sir; and if you don't be off, I'll call the police.''Never trouble your old bones!' retorted Tom.'Good-bye to you, Charlotte;' and, as in defiance of Martha, he tookher passive hand.  'You'll remember one as loved you true and faithful,but was drove desperate!  Good-bye!  I'll not trouble no one no more!'The three concluding negatives with which he dashed out of the houseutterly overwhelmed Charlotte, and made her perfectly insensible toMrs. Martha's objurgations.  She believed in the most horrible anddesperate intentions, and sobbed herself into such violent hystericsthat Miss Mercy came in to assist--imagined that the rude boy hadterrified her, misunderstood her shamefaced attempts at explanation,and left her lying on her bed, crying quietly over her secret terrors,and over that first, strangely-made declaration of love. The whitedove! she did not deserve it, but it was so poetical! and poor Tom wasso unhappy!  She had not time even to think what was become of her owncharacter for wisdom and prudence.The next morning, between monition and triumph, Martha announced thatthe good-for-nothing chap was off with a valuable parcel of Mr.Calcott's, and the police were after him; with much more about hisformer idle habits,--frequenting of democratic oratory, public-houses,and fondness for bad company and strolling actors.  Meek and easilycowed, Charlotte only opened her lips to say she knew that he had takenhome Mr. Calcott's parcel.  But this brought down a storm on her forbeing impertinent enough to defend him, and she sat trembling till ithad subsided; and Martha retreating, left her to weep unrestrainedlyover her wild fancies, and the world's cruelty and injustice towardsone whom, as she was now ready to declare, she loved with her wholeheart.The bell rang sharply, knocks rattled at the front door!  She was surethat Tom had been just taken out of the river!  But instinct to answerthe bell awoke at the second furious clattering and double pealing,which allowed no time for her to compose her tear-streaked, swollenface, especially as the hasty sounds suggested 'Mr. James.'Mr. James it was, but the expected rebuke for keeping him waiting wasnot spoken.  As he saw her sorrowful looks, he only said, low andsoftly, 'Is it so, Charlotte?'  In his eyes, there could be but onecause for grief, and Charlotte's heart smote her for hypocrisy, whenshe could barely command her voice to reply, 'No, sir; my Lord has hada little better night.'He spoke with unusual gentleness, as he made more inquiries than shecould answer; and when, after a few minutes, he turned to walk on toOrmersfield, he said, kindly, 'Good-bye, Charlotte; I'll send you wordif I find him better:' and the tears rose in his eyes at the thoughthow every one loved the patient.He was not wrong.  There was everywhere great affection and sympathyfor the bright, fantastic being whom all laughed at and liked, andNorthwold and the neighbourhood felt that they could have better sparedsomething more valuable.The danger was hardly exaggerated even by Charlotte.  The chill of thelong exposure had brought on high fever; and besides the crushed ankle,there had been severe contusions, which had resulted in an acute painin the side, hitherto untouched by remedies, and beyond thecomprehension of the old Northwold surgeon, Mr. Walby.  As yet,however, the idea of peril had not presented itself to Louis, though hewas perfectly sensible.  Severe pain and illness were new to him; andthough not fretful nor impatient, he had not the stoicism either ofpride or of physical indifference, put little restraint on theexpression of suffering, and was to an almost childish degree absorbedin the present.  He was always considerate and grateful; and his fondaffection for his Aunt Catharine, and for good old Jane, never failedto show itself whenever they did anything for his relief; and they werethe best of nurses.Poor Lord Ormersfield longed to be equally effective; but he wasneither handy nor ready, and could only sit hour after hour beside hisson, never moving except to help the nurses, or to try to catch theslightest accent of the sufferer.  Look up when Louis would, he alwayssaw the same bowed head, and earnest eyes, which, as Mrs. Ponsonby toldher daughter, looked as they did when Louisa was dying.The coming of the London surgeon was an era to which Louis evidentlylooked anxiously, with the iteration of sickness, often reckoning thehours till he could arrive; and when at last he came, there was anevident effort to command attention.When the visit was over, and the surgeon was taking leave after theconsultation, Fitzjocelyn calmly desired to know his opinion, and kepthis eyes steadily fixed on his face, weighing the import of each word.All depended on the subduing the inflammatory action, in the side; andthere was every reason to hope that he would have strength for thesevere treatment necessary.  There was no reason to despond.'I understand--thank you,' said Louis.He shut his eyes, and lay so still that Mrs. Frost trusted that heslept; but when his father came in, they were open, and LordOrmersfield, bending over him, hoped he was in less pain.'Thank you, there is not much difference.'  But the plaintive sound wasgone, the suffering was not the sole thought.'Walby is coming with the leeches at two o'clock,' said LordOrmersfield: 'I reckon much on them.''Thank you.'  Silence again, but his face spoke a wish, and his auntCatharine said, 'What, my dear?''I should like to see Mr. Holdsworth,' said Louis, with eyes appealingto his father.'He has been here to inquire every day,' said the Earl, choosingneither to refuse nor understand.  'Whenever it is not too much foryou--''It must be quickly, before I am weaker,' said Louis.  'Let it bebefore Walby returns, father.''Whatever you wish, my dear--' and Lord Ormersfield, turning towardsthe table, wrote a note, which Mrs. Frost offered to despatch, thinkingthat her presence oppressed her elder nephew, who looked bowed down bythe intensity of grief, which, unexpressed, seemed to pervade the wholeman and weigh him to the earth: and perhaps this also struck Louis forthe first time, for, after having lain silent for some minutes, hesoftly said, 'Father!'The Earl was instantly beside him, but, instead of speaking, Louisgazed in his face, and sighed, as he murmured, 'I was meant to havebeen a comfort to you.''My dear boy--' began Lord Ormersfield, but he could not trust hisvoice, as he saw Louis's eyes moist with tears.'I wish I had!' he continued; 'but I have never been anything but acare and vexation, and I see it all too late.''Nay, Louis,' said his father, trying to assume his usual tone ofauthority, as if to prove his security, 'you must not give way tofeelings of illness.  It is weak to despond.''It is best to face it,' said the young man, with slow and feebleutterance, but with no quailing of eye or voice.  'But oh, father! Idid not think you would feel it so much.  I am not worth it.'For the Earl could neither speak nor breathe, as if smothered by onemighty unuttered sob, and holding his son's hand between both his own,pressed it convulsively.'I am glad Mrs. Ponsonby is here,' said Louis; 'and you will soon findwhat a nice fellow Edward Fitzjocelyn is, whom you may make just what--''Louis, my own boy, hush!  I cannot bear this,' cried his father, in anaccent wrung from him by excess of grief.'I may recover,' said Louis, finding it his turn to comfort, 'and Ishould like to be longer with you, to try to make up--''You will.  The leeches must relieve you.  Only keep up your spirits:you have many years before you of happiness and success.'The words brought a look of oppression over Louis's face, but itcleared as he said, 'I am more willing to be spared those years!'His father positively started.  'Louis, my poor boy,' he said, 'is itreally so?  I know I have seemed a cold, severe father.''Oh, do not say so!' exclaimed Louis; 'I have deserved far less-idle,ungrateful, careless of your wishes.  I did not know I could pain youso much, or I would not have done it.  You have forgiven often, say youforgive now.''You have far more to forgive than I,' said the Earl.'If I could tell you the half-waywardness, discontent, neglect, levity,wasted time--my treatment of you only three days back. Everythingpurposed--nothing done!  Oh! what a life to bring before the Judge!'And he covered his face, but his father heard long-drawn sobs.'Compose yourself, my dear boy,' he exclaimed, exceedingly grieved andperplexed.  'You know there is no cause to despond; and even--even ifthere were, you have no reason to distress yourself.  I can say, fromthe bottom of my heart, that you have never given me cause for realanxiety, your conduct has been exemplary, and I never saw suchattention to religion in any young man.  These are mere trifles--''Oh, hush, father!' exclaimed Louis.  'You are only making it worse;you little know what I am!  If Mr. Holdsworth would come!''He could only tell you the same,' said his father.  'You may takeevery comfort in thinking how blameless you have been, keeping so clearof all the faults of your age.  I may not have esteemed you as youdeserved, my poor Louis; but, be assured that very few can have solittle to reproach themselves with as you have.'Louis almost smiled.  'Poor comfort that,' he said, 'even if it weretrue; but oh, father!' and there was a light in his eye, 'I had thoughtof 'He hath blotted out like a cloud thy transgressions.'''That is right.  One like you must find comfort in thinking.''There is comfort ineffable,' said Louis; 'but if I knew what I maydare to take home to myself!  It is all so dim and confused.  This painwill not let anything come connectedly.  Would you give me that littlemanuscript book!'It was given; and as the many loose leaves fell under Louis's weakhand, his father was amazed at the mass of copies of prayers, texts,and meditations that he had brought together; the earlier pagescontaining childish prayers written in Aunt Catharine's hand. Louis'scheeks coloured at the revelation of his hidden life, as his father putthem together for him.'It is of no use,' he said, sadly; 'I cannot read.  Perhaps my auntwould come and read this to me.''Let me,' said his father; and Louis looked pleased.Lord Ormersfield read what was pointed out.  To him it was a glimpse ofa very new world of contrition, faith, hope, and prayer; but he saw theuneasy expression on Louis's face give place to serenity, as onealready at home in that sphere.'Thank you,' he said.  'That was what I wanted.  Mr. Holdsworth willsoon come, and then I don't want to say much more.  Only don't takethis too much to heart--I am not worth it; and but for you and the dearTerrace home, I can be very glad.  If I may hope, the hope is sobright!  Here there are so many ways of going wrong, and all I doalways fails; and yet I always tried to do Him service.  Oh, to haveall perfect!--no failure--no inconsistency--no self!  Can it be?''I always tried to do Him service!' Sadly and dejectedly as the wordswere spoken--mournful as was the contrast between the will and theresult, this was the true cause that there was peace with Louis.Unstable, negligent, impetuous, and weak as he had been, the oneearnest purpose had been his, guarding the heart, though not yetcontrolling the judgment.  His soul was awake to the unseen, and thusthe sense of the reality of bliss ineffable, and power to take comfortin the one great Sacrifice, came with no novelty nor strangeness.  Itwas a more solemn, more painful preparation, but such as he hadhabitually made, only now it was for a more perfect Festival.His father, as much awestruck by his hopes as distressed by hispenitence, still gave himself credit for having soothed him, and wentto meet and forewarn the Vicar that poor Fitzjocelyn was inclined todespond, and was attaching such importance to the merest, foibles in amost innocent life, that he required the most tender and carefulencouragement.  He spoke in his usual tone of authoritative courtesy;and then, finding that his son wished to be left alone with Mr.Holdsworth, he went to the library to seek the only person to whom hecould bear to talk.'Mary,' he said, 'you were right.  I have done so little to make thatpoor boy of mine happy, that he does not wish for life.'Mrs. Ponsonby looked up surprised.  'Are you sure of what he meant?'she said.  'Was it not that this life has nothing to compare with thatwhich is to come?''But what can be more unnatural?' said the Earl.  'At his age, witheverything before him, nothing but what he felt as my harshness couldso have checked hope and enjoyment.  My poor Louis!'  And, though eyeand voice were steady and tearless, no words could express the anguishof his under-tone.Mrs. Ponsonby adduced instances showing that, to early youth, withheart still untainted by the world, the joys of the Life Everlastinghave often so beamed out as to efface all that earth could promise, buthe could not be argued out of self-reproach for his own want ofsympathy, and spoke mournfully of his cold manner, sternness to smallfaults, and denial of gratifications.Mary the younger could not help rising from her corner to say, 'Indeed,Louis said the other day that you never had denied him any personalindulgence.''My dear, he never asked for personal indulgences,' said the Earl. Hisfurther speech was interrupted by a quick step, a slow opening of thedoor, and the entrance of James Frost, who grasped his outstretchedhand with a breathless inquiry.'He is very ill--' Lord Ormersfield paused, too much oppressed to saymore.'No better?  What did the London surgeon say? what?''He says there is no time to be lost in attacking the inflammation. Ifwe can subdue that, he may recover; but the state of the ankle weakenshim severely.  I believe myself that he is going fast,' said the Earl,with the same despairing calmness; and James, after gazing at him tocollect his meaning, dropped into a chair, covered his face with hishands, and sobbed aloud.Lord Ormersfield looked on as if he almost envied the relief of theoutburst, but James's first movement was to turn on him, as if he wereneglecting his son, sharply demanding, 'Who is with him?''He wished to be left with Mr. Holdsworth.''Is it come to this!' cried James.  'Oh, why did I not come down withhim?  I might have prevented all this!''You could not have acted otherwise,' said the Earl, kindly.  'Yourengagement was already formed.''I could!' said James.  'I would not.  I thought it one of your excusesfor helping us.''It is vain to lament these things now,' said Lord Ormersfield.  'It isvery kind in you to have come down, and it will give him great pleasureif he be able to see you.''If!'  James stammered between consternation and anger at the doubt,and treated the Earl with a kind of implied resentment as if forinjustice suffered by Louis, but it was affecting to see his petulancereceived with patience, almost with gratitude, as a proof of hisaffection for Louis.  The Earl stood upright and motionless before thefire, answering steadily, but in an almost inward voice, all thedetailed questions put by James, who, seated on one chair, with hishands locked on the back of the other, looked keenly up to him with hissharp black eyes, often overflowing with tears, and his voice broken bygrief.  When he had elicited that Louis had been much excited anddistressed by the thought of his failings, he burst out, 'Whatever youmay think, Lord Ormersfield, no one ever had less on his conscience!''I am sure of it.''I know of no one who would have given up his own way again and againwithout a murmur, only to be called fickle.''Yes, it has often been so,' meekly said Lord Ormersfield.'Fickle!' repeated James, warming with the topic, and pouring out whathad been boiling within for years.  'He was only fickle because hisstandard was too high to be reached!  You thought him weak!''There may be weakness by nature strengthened by principle,' said Mrs.Ponsonby.'True,' cried Jem, who, having taken no previous notice of her, had atfirst on her speaking bent his brows on her as if to extend to her thestorm he was inflicting on poor, defenceless Lord Ormersfield, 'he isthought soft because of his easy way; but come to the point where harmdisplays itself, you can't move him a step farther--though he hangsback in such a quiet, careless fashion, that it seems as if he was onlytired of the whole concern, and so it goes down again aschangeableness.''You always did him justice,' said Lord Ormersfield, laying his hand onhis cousin's shoulder, but James retreated ungraciously.'I suppose, where he saw evil, he actually took a dislike,' said Mrs.Ponsonby.'It is an absolute repugnance to anything bad.  You,' turning again onthe Earl, 'had an idea of his being too ready to run into all sorts ofcompany; but I told you there was no danger.''You told me I might trust to his disgust to anything unrefined ordissipated.  You knew him best.''There is that about him which men, not otherwise particular, respectas they might a woman or a child.  They never show themselves in theirtrue colours, and I have known him uphold them because he has neverseen their worst side!''I have always thought he learnt that peculiar refinement from yourgrandmother.''I think,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, softly, 'that it is purity of heartwhich makes him see heaven so bright.''Sydney Calcott walked part of the way with me,' continued Jem, 'andshowed more feeling than I thought was in him.  He said just what I do,that he never saw any one to whom evil seemed so unable to cling. Hespoke of him at school--said he was the friend of all the juniors, buttoo dreamy and uncertain for fellows of his own standing.  He said, atfirst they did not know what to make of him, with his soft looks andcool ways--they could not make him understand bullying, for he couldnot be frightened nor put in a passion.  Only once, one great louttried forcing bad language on him, and then Fitzjocelyn struck him,fought him, and was thoroughly licked, to be sure: but Calcott said itwas a moral victory--no one tried the like again--'James was interrupted by Mr. Holdsworth's entrance.  He said a fewwords apart to the Earl, who answered, with alarm, 'Not now; he hasgone through enough.''I told him so, but he is very anxious, and begged me to return in theevening.''Thank you.  You had better join us at dinner.'The Vicar understood Lord Ormersfield better than did James, and said,pressing his hand, 'My Lord, it is heart-breaking, but the blessednessis more than we can feel.'Mrs. Ponsonby and Mary were left to try to pacify James, who was halfmad at his exclusion from the sickroom, and very angry with every hintof resignation--abusing the treatment of the doctors, calling Mr. Walbyan old woman, and vehemently bent on prophesying the well-doing of thepatient.  Keenly sensitive, grief and suspense made him unusuallyirritable; and he seemed to have no power of waiting patiently, andtrusting the event to wiser Hands.Mrs. Ponsonby dared not entertain any such ardent wishes.  Life had notafforded her so much joy that she should deem it the greatest good, andall that she had heard gave her the impression that Louis was too softand gentle for the world's hard encounter,--most pure and innocent,sincere and loving at present, but rather with the qualities ofchildhood than of manhood, with little strength or perseverance, sothat the very dread of taint or wear made it almost a relief to thinkof his freshness and sweetness being secured for ever.  Even when shethought of his father, and shrank from such grief for him, she couldnot but see a hope that this affliction might soften the heart closedup by the first and far worse sorrow, and detach it from the intereststhat had absorbed it too exclusively.  All this was her food for silentmeditation.  Mary sat reading or working beside her, paler perhaps thanher wont, and betraying that her ear caught every sound on the stairs,but venturing no word except the most matter-of-fact remark, quietlygiving force to the more favourable symptoms.Not till after Mr. Walby's second visit, when there was a littlerespite in the hard life-and-death contest between the remedies and theinflammation, could Mrs. Frost spare a few moments for her grandson.She met him on the stairs--threw her arms round his neck, called himher poor Jemmy, and hastily told him that he must not make her cry.  Helooked anxiously in her face, and told her that he must take her place,for she was worn out.''No, thank you, my dear, I can rest by-and-by.'It sounded very hopeless.'Come, granny, you always take the bright side.''Who knows which is the bright side?' she said.  'Such as he are alwaysthe first.  But there, dear Jem, I told you not to make too much ofgranny--' and hastily withdrawing her hand, she gave a parting caressto his hair as he stood on the step below her, and returned to hercharge.It would have been an inexpressible comfort to James to have had someone to reproach.  His own wretchedness was like a personal injury, andan offence that he could resent would have been a positive relief.  Hewas forced to get out of the way of Frampton coming up with a tray oflemonade, and glared at him, as if even a station on the stairs weredenied, then dashed out of doors, and paced the garden, goaded by everyassociation the scene recalled.  It seemed a mere barbarity to deprivehim of what he now esteemed as the charm of his life--the cousin whohad been as a brother, ever seeking his sympathy, never offended by hissharp, imperious temper, and though often slighted or tyrannized over,meeting all in his own debonnaire fashion, and never forsaking thepoor, hard-working student, so that he might well feel that the worldcould not offer him aught like Louis Fitzjocelyn.He stood in the midst of the botanical garden, and, with almosttriumphant satisfaction, prognosticated that now there would be regretthat Louis's schemes had been neglected or sneered at, and when toolate, his father might feel as much sorrow as he had time for.  It wasthe bitterness, not the softness of grief, in which he looked forthinto the dull blue east-windy haze deepening in the twilight, andpresently beheld something dark moving along under the orchard bankbeneath.  'Hollo! who's there?' he exclaimed, and the form, rearingitself, disclosed young Madison, never a favourite with him, andthough, as a persecuted protege of Louis, having claims which atanother time might have softened him, coming forward at an unluckymoment, when his irritation only wanted an object on which to dischargeitself.  It was plain that one who came skulking in the private groundscould intend no good, and James greeted him, harshly, with 'You've nobusiness here!''I'm doing no harm,' said the boy, doggedly, for his temper was asstubborn as James's was excitable.'No harm! lurking here in that fashion in the dark!  You'll not make mebelieve that!  Let me hear what brings you here!  The truth, mind!''I came to hear how Lord Fitzjocelyn is,' said Tom, with briefbluntness and defiance.'A likely story!  What, you came to ask the apple-trees?' and Jamesscornfully laughed.  'There was no back-door, I suppose!  I couldforgive you anything but such a barefaced falsehood, when you know itwas your own intolerable carelessness that was the only cause of theaccident!''Better say 'twas yourself!' cried Tom, hoarse with passion and shakingall over.The provocation was intense enough to bring back James's real principleand self-restraint, and he spoke with more dignity.  'You seem to bebeside yourself, Madison,' he said, 'you had better go at once, beforeany one finds you here.  Lord Fitzjocelyn cared for you so much, that Ishould not wish for you to meet your deserts under presentcircumstances.  Go!  I wish to have no more of your tongue!'The boy was bounding off, while James walked slowly after to see himbeyond the grounds, and finding Warren the keeper, desired him to be onthe look-out.  Warren replied with the tidings that Madison had runaway from his place, and that the police were looking out for him onthe suspicion of having stolen Mr. Calcott's parcel, moralizing furtheron the depravity of such doings when my young Lord was so ill, butaccounting for the whole by pronouncing poaching to be bred in the boneof the Marksedge people.This little scene had done Jem a great deal of good, both by theexhalation of bitterness and by the final exertion of forbearance. Hehad, indeed, been under two great fallacies on this day,--soothingCharlotte for the grief that was not caused by Fitzjocelyn's illness,and driving to extremity the lad brimming over with sorrow not inferiorto his own.  Little did he know what a gentle word might have done forthat poor, wild, tempestuous spirit!Yet, James's heart smote him that evening, when, according to Louis'searnest wish, Mr. Holdsworth came again, and they all were admitted tothe room, and he saw the feeble sign and summons to the Vicar to benddown and listen.  'Tell poor Madison, it was wrong in me not to go tosee him.  Give him one of my books, and tell him to go on well!'That day had been one of rapid change, and the remedies and sufferinghad so exhausted Louis that he could scarcely speak, and seemed hardlyconscious who was present.  All his faculties were absorbed in the onewish, which late in the evening was granted.  The scene was like anepitome of his life--the large irregular room, cumbered with thedisorderly apparatus of all his multifarious pursuits, while there helay on his little narrow iron bed, his features so fair and colourlessas to be strangely like his mother's marble effigy--his eyes closed,and his brows often contracted with pain, so that there was a doubt howfar his attention was free, but still with a calm, pure sweetness, thatsettled down more and more, as if he were being lulled into a sleep.'He is asleep,' Mrs. Frost said, as they all rose up.They felt what that sleep might become.'We might as well wish to detain a snow-wreath,' thought Mr. Holdsworth.CHAPTER VII.GOSSAMER.Chaos is come again.--Othello.That sleep was not unto death.  When James and Mary came simultaneouslycreeping to the door in the grey twilight of the morning, they heardthat there had been less pain and more rest, and gradually throughoutthe day, there was a diminution of the dangerous symptoms, till thetrembling hope revived that the patient might be given back again tolife.James was still sadly aggrieved at being forbidden the sick-room, andexceedingly envied Lord Ormersfield's seat there.  He declared, so thatMary doubted whether it were jest or earnest, that the Earl onlyremained there because society expected it from their relativepositions, and that it must retard poor Fitzjocelyn's recovery to beperpetually basilisked by those cold grey eyes.  Mary stood upgallantly for the Earl, who had always been so kind to her, and, on hermother's authority, vouched for his strong though hidden, feelings; towhich Jem replied, 'Aye! he was hiding a strong fear of being too latefor the beginning of the Session.''I do not think it right to impute motives,' said Mary.'I would not, Mary, if I could help it,' said James, 'but through thewhole course of my life I have never seen a token that his lordship isworthy of his son.  If he were an ordinary, practical, common-placeblock, apt to support his dignity, he might value him, but all thegrace, peculiarity, and conventionality is a mere burthen and vexation,utterly wasted.'Mary knew that she was a common-place block, and did not wonder atherself for not agreeing with James, but cherishing a strong convictionthat the father and son would now leave off rubbing against each other;since no unprejudiced person could doubt of the strong affection of thefather, nor of the warm gratitude of the son. In spite of the asperitywith which James spoke of the Earl, she was beginning to like himalmost as much as she esteemed him.  This had not been the case intheir childhood, when he used to be praised by the elders for hisobedience to his grandmother and his progress in the Northwold GrammarSchool; but was terribly overbearing with his juniors, and whether hecuffed Louis or led him into mischief, equally distressed her.  Grownup, he was peculiarly vif, quick and ready, unselfish in all his ways,and warmly affectionate--very agreeable companion where hissensitiveness was not wounded, and meriting high honour by his deeperqualities.  Young as he was, he had already relieved his grandmotherfrom his own maintenance: he had turned to the utmost account hiseducation at the endowed school at Northwold; by sheer diligence, hadobtained, first a scholarship and then a fellowship at Oxford; and now,by practising rigid economy, and spending his vacations in tuition, hewas enabled to send his sister to a boarding-school.  He had stolen afew days from his pupils on hearing of Fitzjocelyn's danger, but wasforced to return as soon as the improvement became confirmed.  On theprevious day, he asked Mary to walk with him to the scene of theaccident, and they discussed the cause with more coolness than theyreally felt, as they shuddered at the depth of the fall, and the sizeof the stones.James declared it all the fault of that runaway scamp, young Madison,in whom Louis had always been deceived, and who had never been seensince the night of his apparition in the garden.'Poor boy! I suppose that was the reason he ran away,' said Mary.'A very good thing, too.  He would never have been anything but atorment to Louis.  I remember telling him he was setting the stones soas to break the neck of some one!''I think it would be of more use to build them up than to settle howthey broke down,' said Mary.  'Do you think we could manage it safely?''A capital thought!' cried James, eagerly, and no sooner said thandone.  The two cousins set to work--procured some cement from thebricklayer in the village, and toiled at their masonry with rightgood-will as long as light and time served them, then made anappointment to meet at half-past six next morning, and finish theirwork.When the rendezvous took place, they were rejoicing over Mrs. Frost'sreport of an excellent night, and over her own happy looks, from whichJames prognosticated that all her fatigue and watching had done no harmto her vigorous frame, for which gladness was always the best cordial.It was a joyous beginning on that spring morning, and seemed to addfresh sparkles to the dazzling dewdrops, and double merriment to theblackbirds and thrushes answering each other far and wide, around, asthe sun drew up the grey veil of morning mist. 'They all seem holding afeast for his recovery!' exclaimed Mary, warming for once into poetry,as she trudged along, leaving green footmarks in the silver dew.'Well they may,' said James; 'for who loves them better than he?  Igrudge myself this lovely morning, when he is lying there, and my poorClara is caged up at that place--the two who would the most enjoy it.''Your going to see her will be as good as the spring morning.''Poor child!  I dread it!' sighed Jem.It was his first voluntary mention of his sister.  He had always turnedthe conversation when Mrs. Ponsonby or Mary had tried to inquire forher, and Mary was glad to lead him on to say more.'I remember her last when you were teaching her to run alone, andletting none of us touch her, because you said she was your child, andbelonged to no one else.''I should not be so ungrateful, now that I am come to the sense of myresponsibility in teaching her to go alone.''But she has Aunt Catherine,' said Mary, thinking that he was puttingthe natural guardian out of the question as much now as in the daysreferred to.'My grandmother never had to do with any girl before, and does notprofess to understand them.  She let Clara be regularly a boy inschool, at first learning the same lessons, and then teaching; andwhatever I tried to impress in the feminine line, naturally, all wentfor nothing.  She is as wild as a hare, and has not a particle of agirl about her!''But she is very young.''There it is again!  She grows so outrageously.  She is not sixteen,and there she is taller than granny already.  It is getting quiteabsurd.''What advice do you want on that head?''Seriously, it is a disadvantage, especially to that sort of girl, whocan't afford to look like a woman before her time.  Well, as she mustprobably depend on herself, I looked out for as good a school as couldbe had for the means, and thought I had succeeded, and that she wouldbe brought into some sort of shape.  Granny was ready to break herheart, but thought it quite right.''Then, does it not answer?''That is just what I can't tell.  You have been used to schools: I wishyou could tell me whether it is a necessary evil, or Clara's ownidiosyncrasy, or peculiar to the place.''Whether what is?''Her misery!''Misery!  Why, there is nothing of that in her letters to my aunt.There is not a complaint.''She is a brave girl, who spares granny, when she knows it would be ofno use to distress her.  Judge now, there's the sort of letter that Iget from her.'Mary read.'DEAREST JEMMY,--Write to me as quick as ever you can, and tell me howLouis is; and let me come home, or I shall run mad.  It is no goodtelling me to command my feelings; I am sure I would if I could, forthe girls are more detestable than ever; but what can one do when onecannot sleep nor eat?  All the screaming and crying has got into onebump in my throat, because I can't get it out in peace.  If I couldonly shy the inkstand at the English teacher's head! or get one momentalone and out of sight!  Let me come home.  I could at least runmessages; and it is of no use for me to stay here, for I can't learn,and all the girls are looking at me.  If they were but boys, they wouldhave sense! or if I could but kick them!  This will make you angry, butdo forgive me; I can't help it, for I am so very unhappy.  Louis is asmuch to me as you are, and no one ever was so kind; but I know he willget well--I know he will; only if I knew the pain was better, and couldbut hear every minute.  You need not come to fetch me; only send me atelegraph, and one to Miss Brigham.  I have money enough for asecond-class ticket, and would come that instant.  If you saw the eyesand heard the whispers of these girls, I am sure you would.  I shouldlaugh at such nonsense any other time, but now I only ask to bewretched quietly in a corner.'Your affectionate, nearly crazy, sister,'CLARA FROST DYNEVOR.'Mary might well say that there was nothing more expedient than going tosee Clara, and 'much,' said poor James, 'he should gain by that,'especially on the head that made him most uneasy, and on which he couldonly hint lightly--namely, whether the girls were 'putting nonsense inher head.''If they had done her any harm, she would never have written such aletter,' said Mary.'True,' said Jem.  'She is a mere child, and never got that notion intoher head for a moment; but if they put it in, we are done for! Or ifthe place were ever so bad, I can't remove her now, when granny is thusoccupied.  One reason why I made a point of her going to school was,that I thought doing everything that Fitzjocelyn did was no preparationfor being a governess.''Oh! I hope it will not come to that!  Mr. Oliver Dynevor talks ofcoming home in a very few years.''So few, that we shall be grey before he comes.  No; Clara and I arenot going to be bound to him for the wealth heaped up while mygrandmother was left in poverty.  We mean to be independent.'Mary was glad to revert to Clara.'I must do the best I can for her for the present,' said Jem,--'try toharden her against the girls, and leave her to bear it.  Poor dear! itmakes one's heart ache!  And to have done it oneself, too! Then, in theholidays, perhaps, you will help me to judge.  You will be her friend,Mary; there's nothing she needs so much.  I thought she would havefound one at school but they are not the right stamp of animal.  Shehas been too much thrown on Louis; and though he has made a noble thingof her, that must come to an end, and the sooner the better.'Certainly, it was a perplexity for a young elder brother; but therecould not but remain some simple wonder in Mary's mind whether theobvious person, Mrs. Frost, had not better have been left to decide forher granddaughter.The building operations gave full occupation to the powers of the twocousins, and in good time before breakfast, all was successfullycompleted,--a hand-rail affixed, and the passage cleared out, till itlooked so creditable, as well as solid, that there was no more to wishfor but that Louis should be able to see their handiwork.James went away in the better spirits for having been allowed to shakeLouis by the hand and exchange a few words with him.  Mary augured thatit would be the better for Clara and for the pupils.All that further transpired from him was a cheerful letter to Mrs.Frost, speaking of Clara as perfectly well, and beginning toaccommodate herself to her situation, and from this Mary gathered thathe was better satisfied.The days brought gradual improvement to the patient, under Mrs. Frost'stender nursing, and his father's constant assiduity; both of which, ashe revived, seemed to afford him the greatest pleasure, and wererequited with the utmost warmth and caressing sweetness towards hisaunt, and towards his father with ever-fresh gratitude and delight.Lord Ormersfield was like another man, in the sick-room, whence henever willingly absented himself for an hour.One day, however, when he was forced to go to Northwold on business,Louis put on a fit of coaxing importunity.  Nothing would serve him butsome of Jane Beckett's choice dried pears, in the corner of the oakencupboard, the key of which was in Aunt Kitty's pocket, and no one mustfetch them for him but Aunt Kitty herself, he was so absurdly earnestand grave about them, that Jane scolded him, and Mrs. Frost sawrecovery in his arch eyes; understanding all the time that it was allan excuse for complimenting Jane, and sending her to air herself, visitthe Faithfull sisters, and inspect the Lady of Eschalott.  So sheconsented to accompany Lord Ormersfield, and leave their charge to Mrs.Ponsonby, who found Louis quite elated at the success of hismanoeuvre--so much disposed to talk, and so solicitous for the good ofhis nurses, that she ventured on a bold stroke.His chamber was nearly as much like a lumber-room as ever; for anyattempt to clear away or disturb his possessions had seemed, in hishalf-conscious condition, to excite and tease him so much, that it hadbeen at once relinquished.  Although the room was large, it was alwaystoo much crowded with his goods; and the tables and chairs that hadbeen brought in during his illness, had added to the accumulation whichwas the despair of Mrs. Beckett and Mr. Frampton. Mrs. Ponsonby thoughtit was time for Louis to make a sacrifice in his turn, and ventured tosuggest that he was well enough to say where some of his things mightbe bestowed; and though he winced, she persevered in representing howunpleasant it must be to his father to live in the midst of so muchconfusion.  The debonnaire expression passed over his face, as heglanced around, saying, 'You are right. I never reflected on thestretch of kindness it must have been.  It shall be done.  If I loseeverything, it will not be soon that I find it out.'It evidently cost him a good deal, and Mrs. Ponsonby proposed that Maryshould come and deal with his treasures; a plan at which he caught soeagerly, that it was decided that no time was like the present, andMary was called.  He could move nothing but his hands; but they wereeagerly held out in welcome: and his eyes glittered with the brightsmile that once she had feared never to see again. She felt a moisturein her own which made her glad to turn aside to her task even while hecomplimented her with an allusion to the labours of Hercules.  It didnot seem uncalled-for, when she began by raising a huge sheet of paperthat had been thrown in desperation to veil the confusion upon thetable, and which proved to be the Ordnance map of the county,embellished with numerous streaks of paint.  'The outlines of the oldSaxon wappentakes,' said Louis: 'I was trying to make them out in blue,and the Roman roads in red. That mark is spontaneous; it has beenagainst some paint.'Which paint was found in dried swamps in saucers, while cakes of lakeand Prussian blue adhered to the drawing-board.'The colour-box is probably in the walnut-press; but I advise you notto irritate that yet.  Let me see that drawing, the design for thecottages that Frampton nipped in the bud--''How pretty and comfortable they do look!' exclaimed Mary, pleased tocome to something that was within her sphere of comprehension. 'If theywere but finished!''Ah!  I thought of them when I was lying there in the dell!   Had theybeen allowed to stand where I wanted them, there would have been nolack of people going home from work; but, 'Quite impracticable' came inmy way, and I had no heart to finish the drawing.''What a pity!' exclaimed Mary.'This was Richardson's veto, two degrees worse than Frampton's; and Ishall never be able to abuse Frampton again.  I have seen him in histrue light now, and never was any one more kind and considerate.  Ha,Mary, what's that?''It looks like a rainbow in convulsions.''Now, Mary, did not I tell you that I could not laugh?  It is a diagramto illustrate the theory of light for Clara.''Does she understand that?' cried Mary.'Clara?  She understands anything but going to school--poor child! Yes,burn that map of the strata,--not that--it is to be a painted windowwhenever I can afford one, but I never could make money stay with me.I never could think why--'The why was evident enough in the heterogeneous mass--crumpledprints, blank drawing-paper, and maps heaped ruinously over and underbooks, stuffed birds, geological specimens, dislocated microscopes,pieces of Roman pavement, curiosities innumerable and indescribable;among which roamed blotting-books, memorandum-books, four pieces ofIndian rubber, three pair of compasses, seven paper-knives, ten knives,thirteen odd gloves, fifteen pencils, pens beyond reckoning, a purse, akey, half a poem on the Siege of Granada, three parts of an essay uponSpade Husbandry, the dramatis personae of a tragedy on QueenBrunehault, scores of old letters, and the dust of three years and ahalf.Louis owned that the arrangements conduced to finding rather thanlosing, and rejoiced at the disinterment of his long-lost treasures;but either he grew weary, or the many fragments, the ghosts of departedfancies, made him thoughtful; for he became silent, and only watchedand smiled as Mary quietly and noiselessly completed her reforms, andarranged table and chairs for the comfort of his father and aunt.  Hethanked her warmly, and hoped that she would pursue her kind taskanother day,--a permission which she justly esteemed a great testimonyto her having avoided annoying him.  It was a great amusement to him towatch the surprised and pleased looks of his various nurses as eachcame in, and a real gratification to see his father settle himself withan air of comfort, observing that 'they were under great obligations toMary.'  Still, the sight of the arrangements had left a dreary,dissatisfied feeling with Louis: it might have been caught from Mary'sinvoluntary look of disappointment at each incomplete commencement thatshe encountered,--the multitude of undertakings hastily begun, laidaside and neglected--nothing properly carried out.  It seemed a merewaste of life, and dwelt on his spirits, with a weariness of himselfand his own want of steadfastness--a sense of having disappointed herand disappointed himself, and he sighed so heavily several times, thathis aunt anxiously asked whether he were in pain.  He was, however, somuch better, that no one was to sit up with him at night--only hisfather would sleep on a bed on the floor.  As he bade him good night,Louis, for the first time, made the request that he might have hisBible given to him, as well as his little book; and on his fatheradvising him not to attempt the effort of reading, he said, 'Thank you;I think I can read my two verses: I want to take up my old habits.''Have you really kept up this habit constantly?' asked his father, withwonder that Louis did not understand.'Aunt Catharine taught it to us, he said.  'I neglected it onehalf-year at school; but I grew so uncomfortable, that I began again.'The Earl gave the little worn volume, saying, 'Yes, Louis, there hasbeen a thread running through your life.''Has there been one thread?' sadly mused Louis, as he found the weightof the thick book too much for his weak hands, and his eyes and headtoo dizzy and confused for more than one verse:--'I am come that they might have life,And that they might have it more abundantly.''The Bible sank in his hands, and he fell into a slumber so sound andrefreshing, that when he opened his eyes in early morning, he did notat first realize that he was not awakening to health and activity, norwhy he had an instinctive dread of moving.  He turned his eyes towardsthe window, uncurtained, so that he could see the breaking dawn.  Thesky, deep blue above, faded and glowed towards the horizon into gold,redder and more radiant below; and in the midst, fast becoming mergedin the increasing light, shone the planet Venus, in her pale, calmbrilliance.There was repose and delight in dwelling on that fair morning sky, andLouis lay dreamily gazing, while thoughts passed over his mind, moredefined and connected than pain and weakness had as yet permitted.Since those hours in which he had roused his faculties to meet withapproaching death, he had been seldom awake to aught but the sensationsof the moment, and had only just become either strong enough, orsufficiently at leisure for anything like reflection.  As he watchedthe eastern reddening, he could not but revert to the feelings withwhich he had believed himself at the gate of the City that needsneither sun nor moon to lighten it, and, for the first time, heconsciously realized that he was restored to this world of life.The sensation was not unmixed.  His youthful spirit bounded at theprospect of returning vigour, his warm heart clung round those whom heloved, and the perception of his numerous faults made him grateful fora longer probation; but still he had a sense of having been at theborders of the glorious Land, and thence turned back to a tedious,doubtful pilgrimage.There was much to occasion this state of mind.  His life had beenwithout great troubles, but with many mortifications; he had never beenlong satisfied with himself or his pursuits, his ardour had only beenthe prelude to vexation and self-abasement, and in his station in theworld there was little incentive to exertion.  He had a strong sense ofresponsibility, with a temperament made up of tenderness, refinement,and inertness, such as shrank from the career set before him.  He hadseen just enough of political life to destroy any romance ofpatriotism, and to make him regard it as little more than party spirit,and dread the hardening and deadening process on the mind.  He had adismal experience of his own philanthropy; and he had a conscience thatwould not sit down satisfied with selfish ease, pleasure, orintellectual pursuits.  His smooth, bright, loving temper had made himhappy; but the past was all melancholy, neglect, and futile enterprise;he had no attaching home--no future visions; and, on the outskirts ofmanhood, he shrank back from the turmoil, the temptations, and theroughness that awaited him--nay, from the mere effort of perseverance,and could almost have sighed to think how nearly the death-pang hadbeen over, and the home of Love, Life, and Light had been won forever:--'I am come that they might have life,And that they might have it more abundantly.'The words returned on him, and with them what his father had said, 'Youhave had a thread running through your life.'  He was in a statebetween sleeping and waking, when the confines of reflection anddreaming came very near together, and when vague impressions, hardlynoticed at the time they were made, began to tell on him without hisown conscious volition.  It was to him as if from that brighteningeastern heaven, multitudes of threads of light were floating hither andthither, as he had often watched the gossamer undulating in thesunshine.  Some were firm, purely white, and glistening here and therewith rainbow tints as they tended straight upwards, shining more andmore into the perfect day; but for the most part they were tangledtogether in inextricable confusion, intermingled with many a brokenend, like fleeces of cobweb driven together by the autumn wind,--somesailing aimlessly, or with shattered tangled strands-some white, somedark, some anchored to mere leaves or sprays, some tending down to theabyss, but all in such a perplexed maze that the eye could seldom tracewhich were directed up, which downwards, which were of pure texture,which defiled and stained.In the abortive, unsatisfactory attempt to follow out one fluctuatingclue, not without whiteness, and heaving often upwards, but frail,wavering, ravelled, and tangled, so that scarcely could he find oneline that held together, Louis awoke to find his father wondering thathe could sleep with the sun shining full on his face.'It was hardly quite a dream,' said Louis, as he related it to Mrs.Frost.'It would make a very pretty allegory.''It is too real for that just now,' he said.  'It was the moral of allmy broken strands that Mary held up to me yesterday.''I hope you are going to do more than point your moral, my dear.  Youalways were good at that.''I mean it,' said Louis, earnestly.  'I do not believe such anillness--ay, or such a dream--can come for nothing.'So back went his thoughts to the flaws in his own course; and chieflyhe bewailed his want of sympathy for his father.  Material obedienceand submission had been yielded, but, having little cause to believehimself beloved, his heart had never been called into action so as tosoften the clashings of two essentially dissimilar characters. Insteadof rebelling, or even of murmuring, he had hid disappointment inindifference, taken refuge in levity and versatility, and even consoledhimself by sporting with what he regarded as prejudice or unjustdispleasure.  All this cost him much regret and self-reproach at eachproof of the affection so long veiled by reserve.  Never would he havegiven pain, had he guessed that his father could feel; but he had grownup to imagine the whole man made up of politics and conventionalities,and his new discoveries gave him at least as much contrition aspleasure.After long study of the debates, that morning, his father prepared towrite.  Louis asked for the paper, saying his senses would just servefor the advertisements, but presently he made an exclamation ofsurprise at beholding, in full progress, the measure which had broughtSir Miles Oakstead to Ormersfield, one of peculiar interest to theEarl.  His blank look of wonder amused Mrs. Ponsonby, but seemedsomewhat to hurt his father.'You did not suppose I could attend to such matters now?' he said.'But I am so much better!'Fearing that the habit of reserve would check any exchange of feeling,Mrs. Ponsonby said, 'Did you fancy your father could not think of youexcept upon compulsion?''I beg your pardon, father,' said Louis, smiling, while a tear rose tohis eyes, 'I little thought I was obstructing the business of thenation.  What will Sir Miles do to me?''Sir Miles has written a most kind and gratifying letter,' said LordOrmersfield, 'expressing great anxiety for you, and a high opinion ofyour powers.'Louis had never heard of his own powers, except for mischief, and thecolour returned to his cheeks, as he listened to the kind and cordialletter, written in the first shock of the tidings of the accident. Heenjoyed the pleasure it gave his father far more than the commendationto himself; for he well knew, as he said, that 'there is somethingembellishing in a catastrophe,' and he supposed 'that had driven outthe rose-coloured pastor.''There is always indulgence at your age,' said the Earl.  'You havecreated an impression which may be of great importance to youby-and-by.'Louis recurred to politics.  The measure was one which approved itselfto his mind, and he showed all the interest which was usually stifled,by such subjects being forced on him.  He was distressed at detaininghis father when his presence might be essential to the success of hisparty, and the Earl could not bear to leave him while still confined tohis bed.  The little scene, so calm, and apparently so cold, seemed tocement the attachment of father and son, by convincing Louis of thefull extent of his father's love; and his enthusiasm began to investthe Earl's grey head with a perfect halo of wisdom slighted andaffection injured; and the tenor of his thread of life shone out brightand silvery before him, spun out of projects of devoting heart and soulto his father's happiness, and meriting his fondness.The grave Earl was looking through a magnifying-glass no less powerful.He had not been so happy since his marriage; the consciousness of hisown cold manner made him grateful for any demonstration from his son,and the many little graces of look and manner which Louis had inheritedfrom his mother added to the charm. The sense of previous injusticeenhanced all his good qualities, and it was easy to believe himperfect, while nothing was required of him but to lie still.  Day andnight did Lord Ormersfield wait upon him, grudging every moment spentaway from him, and trying to forestall each wish, till he became almostafraid to express a desire, on account of the trouble it would cause.Mary found the Earl one day wandering among the vines in the oldhothouse, in search of a flower, when, to her amusement, he selected astiff pert double hyacinth, the special aversion of his son, whonevertheless received it most graciously, and would fain have concealedthe headache caused by the scent, until Mrs. Frost privately abstractedit.  Another day, he went, unasked, to hasten the birdstuffer infinishing the rose-coloured pastor; and when it came, himself broughtit up-stairs, unpacked it, and set it up where Louis could best admireits black nodding crest and pink wings; unaware that to his son itseemed a memento of his own misdeeds--a perpetual lesson againstwayward carelessness.'It is like a new love,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'but oh! how much dependsupon Louis after his recovery!''You don't mistrust his goodness now, mamma!''I could not bear to do so.  I believe I was thinking of his fathermore than of himself.  After having been so much struck by hisreligious feeling, I dread nothing so much as his father finding himdeficient in manliness or strength of character.'CHAPTER VIII.A TRUANT DISPOSITION.Gathering up each broken thread.WHYTEHEAD.'Tom Madison is come back,' said the Vicar, as he sat besideFitzjocelyn's couch, a day or two after Lord Ormersfield had gone toLondon.'Come back--where has he been?' exclaimed Louis.'There!' said the Vicar, with a gesture of dismay; 'I forgot that youwere to hear nothing of it!  However, I should think you were wellenough to support the communication.''What is it?' cried Louis, the blood rushing into his cheeks sosuddenly, that Mr. Holdsworth felt guilty of having disregarded theprecautions that he had fancied exaggerated by the fond aunt.  'Poorfellow--he has not--' but, checking himself, he added, 'I amparticularly anxious to hear of him.''I wish there were anything more gratifying to tell you; but he tookthe opportunity of the height of your illness to run away from hisplace, and has just been passed home to his parish.  After all yourpains, it is very mortifying, but--''Pains!  Don't you know how I neglected him latterly!' said Louis.'Poor fellow--then--' but he stopped himself again, and added, 'Youheard nothing of the grounds?''They were not difficult to find,' said Mr. Holdsworth.  'It is the oldstory.  He was, as Mrs. Smith told me, 'a great trial'--more and moredisposed to be saucy and disobedient, taking up with the mostgood-for-nothing boys in the town, haunting those Chartist lectures,and never coming home in proper time at night.  The very last evening,he had come in at eleven o'clock, and when his master rebuked him, cameout with something about the rights of man.  He was sent to LittleNorthwold, about the middle of the day, to carry home somesilver-handled knives of Mr. Calcott's, and returned no more. Smithfancied, at first, that he had made off with the plate, and set thepolice after him, but that proved to be an overhasty measure, for theparcel had been safely left.  However, Miss Faithfull's servant foundhim frightening Mrs. Frost's poor little kitchen-maid into fits, andthe next day James Frost detected him lurking suspiciously about thegarden here, and set Warren to warn him off--'Louis gave a kind of groan, and struck his hand against the couch indespair, then said, anxiously, 'What then?''No more was heard of him, till yesterday the police passed him home tothe Union as a vagabond.  He looks very ill and ragged; but he is inone of those sullen moods, when no one can get a word out of him. Smithdeclines prosecuting for running away, being only too glad of theriddance on any terms; so there he is at his grandfather's, ready forany sort of mischief.''Mr. Holdsworth,' said Louis, raising himself on his elbow, 'you arejudging, like every one else, from appearances.  If I were at libertyto tell the whole, you would see what a noble nature it was that Itrifled with; and they have been hounding--Poor Tom! would it have beenbetter for him that I had never seen him?  It is a fearful thing, thisblind treading about among souls, not knowing whether one does good orharm!''If you feel so,' said Mr. Holdsworth, hoping to lead him from theunfortunate subject, 'what must we do?''My position, if I live, seems to have as much power for evil, withoutthe supernatural power for good.  Doing hastily, or leaving undone, areequally fatal!''Nay, what hope can there be but in fear, and sense of responsibility?''I think not.  I do more mischief than those who do not go out of theirway to think of the matter at all!''Do you!' said the Vicar, smiling.  'At least, I know, for my own part,I prefer all the trouble and perplexity you give me, to a squire whowould let me and my parish jog on our own way.''I dare say young Brewster never spoilt a Tom Madison.''The sight of self indulgence spoils more than injudicious care does.Besides, I look on these experiments as giving experience.''Nice experience of my best efforts!''Pardon me, Fitzjocelyn, have we seen your best?''I hope you will!' said Louis, vigorously.  'And to begin, will youtell this poor boy to come to me?'Mr. Holdsworth had an unmitigated sense of his own indiscretion, andnot such a high one of Fitzjocelyn's discretion as to make him thinkthe interview sufficiently desirable for the culprit, to justify thepossible mischief to the adviser, whose wisdom and folly were equallyperplexing, and who would surely be either disappointed or deceived.Dissuasions and arguments, however, failed; and Mrs. Frost, who wasappealed to as a last resource, no sooner found that her patient'sheart was set on the meeting, than she consented, and persuaded Mr.Holdsworth that no harm would ensue equal to the evil of her boy lyingthere distressing himself.Accordingly, in due time, Mr. Holdsworth admitted the lad, and, on asign from Louis, shut himself out, leaving the runaway standing withinthe door, a monument of surly embarrassment.  Raising himself, Louissaid, affectionately, 'Never mind, Tom, don't you see how fast I amgetting over it?'The lad looked up, but apparently saw little such assurance in the thinpale cheeks, and feeble, recumbent form; for his face twitched allover, resumed the same sullen stolidity, and was bent down again.'Come near, Tom,' continued Louis, with unabated kindness--'come andsit down here.  I am afraid you have suffered a great deal,' as the boyshambled with an awkward footsore gait.  'It was a great pity you ranaway.''I couldn't stay!' burst out Tom, half crying.'Why not?''Not to have that there cast in my teeth!' he exclaimed, with bluntincivility.'Did any one reproach you?' said Louis, anxiously.  'I thought no oneknew it but ourselves.''You knew it, then, my Lord?' asked Tom, staring.'I found out directly that there was no cement,' said Louis.  'I hadsuspected it before, and intended to examine whenever I had time.''Well!  I thought, when I came back, no one did seem to guess as 'twasall along of me!' cried Tom.  'So sure I thought you hadn't known it,my Lord.  And you never said nothing, my Lord!''I trust not.  I would not consciously have accused you of what wasquite as much my fault as yours.  That would not have been fair play.''If I won't give it to Bill Bettesworth!' cried Tom.'What has he done?''Always telling me that gentlefolks hadn't got no notion of fair playwith the like of us, but held us like the dirt to be trampled on! Butthere--I'll let him know--''Who is he?''A young man what works with Mr. Smith,' returned Tom, his sullennesshaving given place to a frank, open manner, such as any one but Louiswould have deemed too free and ready.'Was he your great friend at Northwold?''A chap must speak to some one,' was Tom's answer.'And what kind of a some one was he?''Why, he comes down Illershall way.  He knows a thing or two, and cango on like an orator or a play-book--or like yourself, my Lord.''Thank you.  I hope the thing or two were of the right sort.'Tom looked sheepish.'I heard something about bad companions.  I hope he was not one.  Iought to have come and visited you, Tom; I have been very sorry I didnot.  You'd better let me hear all about it, for I fear there must havebeen worse scrapes than this of the stones.''Worse!' cried Tom--'sure nothing could be worserer!''I wish there were no evils worse than careless forgetfulness,' saidLouis.'I didn't forget!' said Tom.  'I meant to have told you whenever youcame to see me, but'--his eyes filled and his voice began toalter--'you never came, and she at the Terrace wouldn't look at me!And Bill and the rest of them was always at me, asking when I expectedmy aristocrat, and jeering me 'cause I'd said you wasn't like the restof 'em.  So then I thought I'd have my liberty too, and show I didn'tcare no more than they, and spite you all.''How little one thinks of the grievous harm a little selfishheedlessness may do!' sighed Louis, half aloud.  'If you had onlylooked to something better than me, Tom!  And so you ran into mischief?'Half confession, half vindication ensued, and the poor fellow's storywas manifest enough.  His faults had been unsteadiness and misplacedindependence rather than any of the more degrading stamp of evils. Thepublic-house had not been sought for liquor's sake, but for that of theorator who inflamed the crude imaginations and aspirations thateffervesced in the youth's mind; and the rudely-exercised authority ofmaster and foreman had only driven his fierce temper further astray.With sense of right sufficient to be dissatisfied with himself, andtaste and principle just enough developed to loathe the evils roundhim, hardened and soured by Louis's neglect, and rendered discontentedby Chartist preachers, he had come to long for any sort of change orbreak; and the tidings of the accident, coupled with the hard wordswhich he knew himself to deserve but too well, had put the finishingstroke.Hearing that the police were in pursuit of him, he had fancied it wason account of the harm done by his negligence.  'I hid about for aday,' he said: 'somehow I felt as if I could not go far off, till Iheard how you were, my Lord, and I'd made up my mind that as soon asever I heard the first stroke of the bell, I'd go and find the police,and his Lordship might hang me, and glad!'Louis was nearer a tear than a smile.'Then Mr. Frost finds me, and was mad at me.  Nothing wasn't bad enoughfor me, and he sets Mr. Warren to see me off, so I had nothing for itbut to cut.''What did you think of doing?' sighed Louis.'I made for the sea.  If I could have got to them places in the Indies,such as that Philip went to, as you reads about in the verse-book--heas killed his wife and lost his son, and made friends with that therebig rascal, and had the chest of gold--''Philip Mortham!  Were you going in search of buccaneers?''I don't know, my Lord.  Once you told me of some English Sir, as killsthe pirates, and is some sort of a king.  I thought, may be, now you'dtell me where they goes to dig for gold.''Oh, Tom, Tom, what a mess I have made of your notions!''Isn't there no such place?''It's a bad business, and what can you want of it?''I want to get shut of them as orders one about here and there, withnever a civil word.  Besides,' looking down, 'there's one I'd like tosee live like a lady.''Would that make her happier?''I'll never see her put about, and slave and drudge, as poor motherdid!' exclaimed Tom.'That's a better spirit than the mere dislike to a master,' said Louis.'What is life but obedience?''I'd obey fast enough, if folk would only speak like you do--not driveone about like a dog, when one knows one is every bit as good as they.''I'm sure I never knew that!'Tom stared broadly.'I never saw the person who was not my superior,' repeated Louis,quietly, and in full earnest.  'Not that this would make rough wordspleasanter, I suppose.  The only cure I could ever see for the ills ofthe world is, that each should heartily respect his neighbour.'Paradoxes musingly uttered, and flying over his head, wore to Tom anatural and comfortable atmosphere; and the conversation proceeded.Louis found that geography had been as much at fault as chronology, andthat the runaway had found himself not at the sea, but at Illershall,where he had applied for work, and had taken a great fancy to Mr.Dobbs, but had been rejected for want of a character, since the goodsuperintendent made it his rule to keep up a high standard among hismen.  Wandering had succeeded, in which, moneyless, forlorn, and unableto find employment, he had been obliged to part with portions of hisclothing to procure food; his strength began to give way, and he hadbeen found by the police sleeping under a hedge; he was questioned, andsent home, crestfallen, sullen, and miserable, unwilling to stay atMarksedge, yet not knowing where to go.His hankering was for Illershall, and Louis, thinking of the judiciouscare, the evening school, and the openings for promotion, decided atonce that the experiment should be tried without loss of time.  Hedesired Tom to bring him ink and paper, and hastily wrote:'DEAR MR. DOBBS,--You would do me a great kindness by employing thispoor fellow, and bearing with him.  I have managed him very ill, but hewould reward any care.  Have an eye to him, and put him incommunication with the chaplain.  If you can take him, I will writemore at length.  If you have heard of my accident, you will excuse moreat present.'Yours very truly,'FITZJOCELYN.'Then arose the question, how Tom was to get to Illershall.  He did notknow; and Louis directed his search into the places where the loosemoney in his pocket might have been put.  When it was found, Tomscrupled at the proposed half-sovereign.  Three-and-fourpence would payfor his ticket.  'You will want a supper and a bed.  Go respectably,Tom, and keep so. It will be some consolation for the mischief I havedone you!''You done me harm!' cried Tom.  'Why, 'tis all along of you that Iain't a regularly-built scamp!''Very irregularly built, whatever you are!' said Louis.  But I'll tellyou what you shall do for me,' continued he, with anxious earnestness.'Do you know the hollow ash-tree that shades over Inglewood stile?  Ithas a stout sucker, with a honeysuckle grown into it--coming up amongthe moss, where the great white vase-shaped funguses grew up in theautumn.''I know him, my Lord,' said Tom, brightening at the detail, given withall a sick man's vivid remembrance of the out-of-doors world.'I have fixed my mind on that stick!  I think it has a bend at theroot.  Will you cut it for me, and trim it up for a walking-stick?''That I will, my Lord!''Thank you.  Bring it up to me between seven and eight in the morning,if you please; and so I shall see you again--'Mr. Holdsworth was already entering to close the conversation, whichhad been already over-long and exciting, for Louis, sinking back,mournfully exclaimed, 'The medley of that poor boy's mind is the worstof my pieces of work.  I have made him too refined for one class, andleft him too rough for another--discontented with his station, and toodesultory and insubordinate to rise, nobleness of nature turning toarrogance, fact and fiction all mixed up together. It would be a study,if one was not so sorry!'Nevertheless, Mr. Holdsworth could not understand how even Fitzjocelyncould have given the lad a recommendation, and he would haveremonstrated, but that the long interview had already been sufficientlytrying; so he did his best to have faith in his eccentric friend's goodintentions.In the early morning, Tom Madison made his appearance, in his bestclothes, erect and open-faced, a strong contrast to the jaded, downcastbeing who had yesterday presented himself.  The stick was prepared toperfection, and Louis acknowledged it with gratitude proportioned tothe fancies that he had spent on it, poising it, feeling the cool greybark, and raising himself in bed to try how he should lean on it.'Hang it up there, Tom, within my reach.  It seems like a beginning ofindependence.''I wish, my Lord,' blurted out Tom, in agitation, 'you'd tell me ifyou're to go lame for life, and then I should know the worst of it.''I suspect no one knows either the worst or the best,' said Louis,kindly.  'Since the pain has gone off, I have been content, and askedno questions.  Mr. Walby says my ankle is going on so well, that it isa real picture, and a pleasure to touch it; and though I can't say thepleasure is mutual, I ought to be satisfied.''You'll only laugh at me!' half sobbed Tom, 'and if there was butanything I could do!  I've wished my own legs was cut off--and serve meright--ever since I seen you lying there.''Thank you; I'm afraid they would have been no use to me!  But,seriously, if I had been moderately prudent, it would not havehappened.  And as it is, I hope I shall be glad of that roll in Fernydell to the end of my life.''I did go to see after mending them stones!' cried Tom, as if injuredby losing this one compensation; 'but they are all done up, and thereain't nothing to do to them.''Look here, Tom: if you want to do anything for me, it is easily told,what would be the greatest boon to me.  They tell me I've spoilt you,and I partly believe it, for I put more of my own fancies into you thanof real good, and the way I treated you made you impatient of control:and then, because I could not keep you on as I should have wished,--as,unluckily, you and I were not made to live together on a desertisland,--I left you without the little help I might have given.  Now,Tom, if you go to the bad, I shall know it is all my fault--''That it ain't,' the boy tried to say, eagerly, but Louis went on.'Don't let my bad management be the ruin of you.  Take a turn from thismoment.  You know Who can help you, and Who, if you had thought of Him,would have kept you straight when I forgot.  Put all the stuff out ofyour head about one man being equal to another.  Equal they are; butsome have the trial of ruling, others of obeying, and the last are thelucky ones.  If we could only see their souls, we should know it.You'll find evening schools and lectures at Illershall; you'd bettertake to them, for you've more real liking for that sort of thing thanfor mischief; and if you finished up your education, you'd get into aline that would make you happier, and where you might do much good.There--promise me that you'll think of these things, and take heed toyour Sundays.''I promise,' said Tom.'And mind you write to me, Tom, and tell how you get on.  I'll write,and let you know about your grandfather, and Marksedge news and all--'The 'Thank you, my Lord,' came with great pleasure and alacrity.'Some day, when you are a foreman, perhaps I may bring Miss Clara tosee copper-smelting.  Only mind, that you'll never go on soundly, noreven be fit to make your pretty tidy nest for any gentle bird, unlessyou mind one thing most of all; and that is, that we have had a newLife given us, and we have to begin now, and live it for ever and ever.'As he raised himself, holding out his pale, slender hand from his whitesleeve, his clear blue eyes earnestly fixed on the sky, his face allone onward look, something of that sense of the unseen passed into theconfused, turbulent spirit of the boy, very susceptible of poeticalimpressions, and his young lord's countenance connected itself with allthe floating notions left in his mind by parable or allegory.  He didnot speak, as Louis heartily shook his hardy red hand, and bade himgood speed, but his bow and pulled forelock at the door had in themmore of real reverence than of conventional courtesy.Of tastes and perceptions above his breeding, the very sense of his owndeficiencies had made him still more rugged and clownish, and removedhim from the sympathies of his own class, while he almost idolized thetwo most refined beings whom he knew, Lord Fitzjocelyn and CharlotteArnold.  On an interview with her, his heart was set. He had takenleave of his half-childish grandfather, made up his bundle, and marchedinto Northwold, with three hours still to spare ere the starting of theparliamentary train.  Sympathy, hope, resolution, and the sense ofrespectability had made another man of him; and, above all, he dwelt onthe prospect held out of repairing the deficiencies of his learning.The consciousness of ignorance and awkwardness was very painful, and helonged to rub it off, and take the place for which he felt his powers.'I will work!' thought he; 'I have a will to it, and, please God, whenI come back next, it won't be as a rough, ignorant lout that I'll standbefore Charlotte!''Louis,' said Mary Ponsonby, as she sat at work beside him thatafternoon, after an expedition to the new house at Dynevor Terrace, 'Iwant to know, if you please, how you have been acting like a gentleman.''I did not know that I had been acting at all of late.''I could not help hearing something in Aunt Catharine's garden that hasmade me very curious.''Ha!' cried Louis, eagerly.'I was sowing some annuals in our back garden, and heard voices throughthe trellis.  Presently I heard, quite loud, 'My young Lord has behavedlike a real gentleman, as he is, and no mistake, or I'd never have beenhere now.'  And, presently, 'I've promised him, and I promise you,Charlotte, to keep my Church, and have no more to do with them things.I'll keep it as sacred as they keeps the Temperance pledge; for sureI'm bound to him, as he forgave me, and kept my secret as if I'd beenhis own brother: and when I've proved it, won't that satisfy you,Charlotte?''And what did Charlotte say?''I think she was crying; but I thought listening any more would beunfair, so I ran upstairs and threw up the drawing-room window to warnthem.''Oh, Mary, how unfeeling!''I thought it could be doing no good!''That is so like prudent people, who can allow no true love under fivehundred pounds a year!  Did you see them?  How did they look?''Charlotte was standing in an attitude, her hands clasped over herbroom.  The gentleman was a country-looking boy--''Bearing himself like a sensible, pugnacious cock-robin?  Poor fellow,so you marred their parting.''Charlotte flew into the house, and the boy walked off up the garden.Was he your Madison, Louis? for I thought my aunt did not think itright to encourage him about her house.''And so he is to be thwarted in what would best raise and refine him.That great, bright leading star of a well-placed affection is not to beallowed to help him through all the storms and quicksands in his way.'Good Mary might well open her eyes, but, pondering a little, she said,'He need not leave off liking Charlotte, if that is to do him good; butI suppose the question is, what is safest for her?''Well, he is safe enough.  He is gone to Illershall to earn her.''Oh! then I don't care!  But you have not answered me, and I think Ican guess the boy's secret that you have been keeping.  Did you notonce tell me that you trusted those stones in Ferny dell to him?''Now, Mary, you must keep his secret!''But why was it made one?  Did you think it unkind to say that it washis fault?''Of course I did.  When I thought it was all over with me, I could notgo and charge the poor fellow with it, so as to make him a marked man.I was only afraid that thinking so often of stopping myself, I shouldbring it out by mistake.'Mary looked down, and thought; then raised her eyes suddenly, and said,as if surprised, 'That was really very noble in you, Louis!' Then,thinking on, she said, 'But how few people would think it worth while!''Yes,' said Louis; 'but I had a real regard for this poor fellow, andan instinct, perhaps perverse, of shielding him; so I could not accusehim on my own account.  Besides, I believe I am far more guilty towardshim.  His neglect only hurt my ankle--my neglect left him to fall intotemptation.''Yet, by the way he talks of you--''Yes, he has the sort of generous disposition on which a littledelicacy makes a thousand times more impression than a whole pile ofbenefits I hope and trust that he is going to repair all that is past.I wish I could make out whether good intentions overrule errors indetail, or only make them more fatal.'Mary was glad to reason out the question.  Abstract practical viewsinterested her, and she had much depth and observation, more originalthan if she had read more and thought less.  Of course, no conclusionwas arrived at; but the two cousins had an argument of much enjoymentand some advantage to both.Affairs glided on quietly till the Saturday, when Lord Ormersfieldreturned.  Never had he so truly known what it was to come home as whenhe mounted the stairs, with steps unlike his usual measured tread, andbeheld his son's look of animated welcome, and eager, outstretchedhands.'I was afraid,' said the Earl, presently, 'that you had not felt sowell,' and he touched his own upper lip to indicate that the samefeature in his son was covered with down like a young bird.Louis blushed a little, but spoke indifferently.  'I thought it a pitynot to leave it for the regulation moustache for the Yeomanry.''I wish I could think you likely to be fit to go out with the Yeomanry.''Every effort must be made!' cried Louis.  'What do they say in Londonabout the invasion?'It was the year 1847, when a French invasion was in every one's mouth,and Sydney Calcott had been retailing all sorts of facts aboutwar-steamers and artillery, in a visit to Fitzjocelyn, whose patriotismhad forthwith run mad, so that he looked quite baffled when his fathercoolly set the whole down as 'the regular ten years' panic.'  There wasa fervid glow within him of awe, courage, and enterprise, the outwardsymbol of which was that infant yellow moustache.  He was obliged,however, to allow the subject to be dismissed, while his father toldhim of Sir Miles Oakstead's kind inquiries, and gave a message ofgreeting from his aunt Lady Conway, delivering himself of it as anunpleasant duty, and adding, as he turned to Mrs. Ponsonby, 'Shedesired to be remembered to you, Mary.''I have not seen her for many years.  Is Sir Walter alive?''No; he died about three years ago.''I suppose her daughters are not come out yet?''Her own are in the school-room; but there is a step-daughter who ismuch admired.''Those cousins of mine,' exclaimed Louis, 'it is strange that I havenever seen them.  I think I had better employ some of my spare timethis summer in making their acquaintance.'Mrs. Ponsonby perceived that the Earl had become inspired with a deadlyterror of the handsome stepdaughter; for he turned aside and began tounpack a parcel.  It was M'Culloch's Natural Theology, into which Louishad once dipped at Mr. Calcott's, and had expressed a wish to read it.His father had taken some pains to procure this too-scarce book forhim, and he seized on it with delighted and surprised gratitude,plunging at once into the middle, and reading aloud a most eloquentpassage upon electricity.  No beauty, however, could atone to LordOrmersfield for the outrage upon method.  'If you would oblige me,Louis,' he said, 'you would read that book consecutively.''To oblige you, certainly,' said Louis, smiling, and turning to thefirst page, but his vivacious eagerness was extinguished.M'Culloch is not an author to be thoroughly read without a strongeffort.  His gems are of the purest ray, but they lie embedded in ahard crust of reasoning and disquisition; and on the first morning,Louis, barely strong enough yet for a battle with his own volatility,looked, and owned himself, dead beat by the first chapter.Mary took pity on him.  She had been much interested by his account ofthe work, and would be delighted if he would read it with her. Hebrightened at once, and the regular habit began, greatly to theirmutual enjoyment.  Mary liked the argument, Louis liked explaining it;and the flood of allusions was delightful to both, with his richness ofillustration, and Mary's actual experience of ocean and mountains.  Shebrought him whatever books he wanted, and from the benevolent view ofentertaining him while a prisoner, came to be more interested than hermother had ever expected to see her in anything literary.  It wasamusing to see the two cousins unconsciously educating each other--theone learning expansion, the other concentration, of mind.  Mary couldnow thoroughly trust Louis's goodness, and therefore began by bearingwith his vagaries, and gradually tracing the grain of wisdom that wasusually at their root; and her eyes were opened to new worlds, whereall was not evil or uninteresting that Aunt Melicent distrusted.  Louismade her teach him Spanish; and his insight into grammar and keendelight in the majestic language and rich literature infected her,while he was amused by her positive distaste to anything incomplete,and playfully, though half murmuringly, submitted to his 'goodgoverness,' and let her keep him in excellent order.  She knew whereall his property was, and, in her quaint, straightforward way, wouldrefuse to give him whatever 'was not good for him.'It was all to oblige Mary that, when he could sit up and use pen andpencil, he set to work to finish his cottage plans, and soon drew andtalked himself into a vehement condition about Marksedge.  Mary'spatronage drew on the work, even to hasty learning of perspectiveenough for a pretty elevation intelligible to the unlearned, and ahopeless calculation of the expense.The plans lay on the table when next his father came home, and theirinterest was explained.'Did you draw all these yourself?' exclaimed the Earl.  'Where did youlearn architectural drawing?  I should have thought them done by aprofessional hand.''It is easy enough to get it up from books,' said Louis; 'and Mary keptme to the point, in case you should be willing to consider the matter.I would have written out the estimate; but this book allows for bricks,and we could use the stone at Inglewood more cheaply, to say nothing ofbeauty.''Well,' said Lord Ormersfield, considering, 'you have every right tohave a voice in the management of the property.  I should like to hearyour views with regard to these cottages.'Colouring deeply, and with earnest thanks, Fitzjocelyn stated theinjury both to labourers and employers, caused by their distance fromtheir work; he explained where he thought the buildings ought to stand,and was even guarded enough to show that the rents would justify theoutlay.  He had considered the matter so much, that he could even haveencountered Richardson; and his father was only afraid that what was soplausible must be insecure.  Caution contended with a real desire togratify his son, and to find him in the right.  He must know the wishesof the farmer, be sure of the cost, and be certain of the spotintended.  His crippled means had estranged him from duties that hecould not fulfil according to his wishes, and, though not a hardlandlord, he had no intercourse with his tenants, took little interestin his estate, and was such a stranger to the localities, that Louiscould not make him understand the nook selected for the buildings.  Hehad seen the arable field called 'Great Courtiers,' and the farm called'Small Profits,' on the map, but did not know their ups and downs muchbetter than the coast of China.'Mary knows them!' said Louis.  'She made all my measurements there,before I planned the gardens.''Mary seems to be a good friend to your designs,' said the Earl,looking kindly at her.'The best!' said Louis.  'I begin to have some hope of my doings when Isee her take them in hand.'Lord Ormersfield thanked Mary, and asked whether it would betrespassing too much on her kindness to ask her to show him the placein question.  She was delighted, and they set out at once, the Earlalmost overpowering her by his exceeding graciousness, so that she wasnearly ready to laugh when he complimented her on knowing her waythrough the bye-paths of his own park so much better than he did. 'Itis a great pleasure to me that you can feel it something like home,' hesaid.'I was so happy here as a child,' said Mary, heartily, 'that it mustseem to me more of a home than any other place.''I hope it may always be so, my dear.'He checked himself, as if he had been about to speak even more warmly;and Mary did the honours of the proposed site for the cottages, a wastestrip fronting a parish lane, open to the south, and looking full ofcapabilities, all of which she pointed out after Louis's well-learnedlesson, as eagerly as if it had been her own affair.Lord Ormersfield gave due force to all, but still was prudent.  'I mustfind out,' he said, 'whether this place be in my hands, or included inMorris's lease.  You see, Mary, this is an encumbered property, withevery disadvantage, so that I cannot always act as you and Louis wouldwish; but we so far see our way out of our difficulties, that, ifguided by good sense, he will be able to effect far more than I haveever done.''I believe,' was Mary's answer, 'this green is in the farmer's hands,but that he has no use for it.''I should like to be certain of his wishes.  Farmers are so unwillingto increase the rates, that I should not like to consent till I knowthat it would be really a convenience to him.'Mary suggested that there stood the farmhouse; and the Earlapologetically asked if she would dislike their proceeding thither, ashe would not detain her long.  She eagerly declared that Louis would be'so glad,' and Lord Ormersfield turned his steps to the door, where hehad only been once in his life, when he was a very young man, trying tolike shooting.The round-eyed little maid would say nothing but 'Walk in, sir,' inanswer to inquiries if Mr. Norris were at home; and they walked into aparlour, chill with closed windows, and as stiff and fine as the lilacstreamers of the cap that Mrs. Norris had just put on for theirreception.  Nevertheless, she was a sensible, well-mannered woman, andafter explaining that her husband was close at hand, showed genuinewarmth and interest in inquiring for Lord Fitzjocelyn.  As theconversation began to flag, Mary had recourse to admiring a handsomesilver tankard on a side table.  It was the prize of a ploughing-matcheight years ago, and brought out a story that evidently always wentwith it, how Mrs. Norris had been unwell and stayed at home, and hadfirst heard of her husband's triumph by seeing the young Lord gallopingheadlong up the homefield, hurraing, and waving his cap.  He had takenhis pony the instant he heard the decision, and rushed off to be thefirst to bring the news to Mrs. Norris, wild with the honour of SmallProfits.  'And,' said the farmer's wife, 'I always say Norris was aspleased with what I told him, as I was with the tankard!'Norris here came in, an unpretending, quiet man, of the modern,intelligent race of farmers.  There was anxiety at first in his eye,but it cleared off as he heard the cause of his landlord's visit, andhe was as propitious as any cautious farmer could be.  He was strong onthe present inconveniences, and agreed that it would be a great boon tohave a few families brought back, such as were steady, and would notburden the rates; but the few recurred so often as to show that hewas afraid of a general migration of Marksedge.  Lord Ormersfieldthereupon promised that he should be consulted as to the individuals.'Thank you, my Lord.  There are some families at Marksedge that onewould not wish to see nearer here; and I'll not say but I should liketo have a voice in the matter, for they are apt to take advantage ofLord Fitzjocelyn's kindness.''I quite understand you.  Nothing can be more reasonable.  I only actedbecause my son was persuaded it was your wish.''It is so, my Lord.  I am greatly obliged.  He has often talked of itwith me, and I had mentioned the matter to Mr. Richardson, but hethought your lordship would be averse to doing anything.''I have not been able to do all I could have wished,' said the Earl.'My son will have it in his power to turn more attention to theproperty.'And he is a thorough farmer's friend, as they all say,' earnestlyexclaimed Norris, with warmth breaking through the civil formal manner.'True,' said Lord Ormersfield, gratified; 'he is very much attached tothe place, and all connected with it.''I'm sure they're the same to him,' replied the farmer.  'As aninstance, my Lord, you'll excuse it--do you see that boy driving in thecows?  You would not look for much from him.   Well, the morning thedoctor from London came down, that boy came to his work, crying so thatI thought he was ill.  'No, master,' said he, 'but what'll ever becomeof us when we've lost my young Lord?'  And he burst out again, fit tobreak his heart.  I told him I was sorry enough myself, but to go tohis work, for crying would do no good.  'I can't help it, master,' sayshe, 'when I looks at the pigs.  Didn't he find 'em all in the park, andme nutting--and helped me his own self to drive 'em out before Mr.Warren see 'em, and lifted the little pigs over the gap as tender as ifthey were Christians?''Yes, that's the way with them all,' interposed Mrs. Norris: 'he hasthe good word of high and low.'Lord Ormersfield smiled: he smiled better than he used to do, and tookleave.'Fitzjocelyn will be a popular man,' he said.Mary could not help being diverted at this moral deduced from thepig-story.  'Every one is fond of him,' was all she said.'Talent and popularity,' continued the Earl.  'He will have greatinfluence.  The free, prepossessing manner is a great advantage, whereit is so natural and devoid of effort.''It comes of his loving every one,' said Mary, almost indignantly.'It is a decided advantage,' continued the Earl, complacently.  'I haveno doubt but that he has every endowment requisite for success. You andyour mother have done much in developing his character, my dear; and Isee every reason to hope that the same influence continued will producethe most beneficial results.'Mary thought this a magnificent compliment, even considering that noone but her mamma had succeeded in teaching Louis to read when a littleboy, or in making him persevere in anything now: but then, when LordOrmersfield did pay a compliment, it was always in the style of LouisXIV.CHAPTER IX.THE FAMILY COMPACT.Who, nurst with tender care,And to domestic bounds confined,Was still a wild Jack-hareCOWPER.'Mary,' said Mrs. Frost.Mrs. Ponsonby was sitting by the open window of the library, inhalingthe pleasant scents of July.  Raising her eyes, she saw her aunt gazingat her with a look somewhat perplexed, but brim full of mischievousfrolic.  However, the question was only--'Where is that boy?''He is gone down with Mary to his cottage-building.''Oh! if Mary is with him, I don't care,' said Aunt Catharine, sittingdown to her knitting; but her ball seemed restless, and while shepursued it, she broke out into a little laugh, and exclaimed, 'I begyour pardon, my dear, but I cannot help it.  I never heard anything sofunny!''As this scheme,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, with a little hesitation.'Then you have the other side of it in your letter,' cried Mrs. Frost,giving way to her merriment.  'The Arabian Nights themselves, the twoviziers laying their heads together, and sending home orders to us tomake up the match!''My letter does not go so far,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, amused, but anxious.'Yours is the lady's side.  My orders are precise.  Oliver has talkedit over with Mr. Ponsonby, and finds the connexion would be agreeable;so he issues a decree that his nephew, Roland Dynevor--(poor Jem--hewould not know himself!)--should enter on no profession, but forthwithpay his addresses to Miss Ponsonby, since he will shortly be in aposition befitting the heir of our family!''You leave Prince Roland in happy ignorance,' said Mrs. Ponsonby,blushing a little.'Certainly--or he would fly off like a sky-rocket at the first symptomof the princess.''Then I think we need not alter our plans.  All that Mary's fathertells me is, that he does not intend to return home as yet, though hissuccessor is appointed, since he is much occupied by this newpartnership with Oliver, and expects that the investment will besuccessful.  He quite approves of our living at the Terrace, especiallyas he thinks I ought to be informed that Oliver has declared hisintentions with regard to his nephew, and so if anything should arisebetween the young people, I am not to discourage it.''Mary is in request,' said Mrs. Frost, slyly, and as she met Mrs.Ponsonby's eyes full of uneasy inquiry.  'You don't mean that you havenot observed at least his elder lordship's most decided courtship?Don't be too innocent, my dear.''Pray don't say so, Aunt Kitty, or you will make me uncomfortable instaying here.  If the like ever crossed his mind, he must perceive thatthe two are just what we were together ourselves.''That might make him wish it the more,' Aunt Catharine had almost said,but she restrained it halfway, and said, 'Louis is hardly come to thetime of life for a grande passion.''True.  He is wonderfully young, and Mary not only seems much older,but is by no means the girl to attract a mere youth.  I rather suspectshe will have no courtship but from the elders.''In spite of her opportunities.  What would some mammas--LordOrmersfield's bugbear, for instance, Lady Conway--give for such achance!  Three months of a lame young Lord, and such a lame young Lordas my Louis!''I might have feared,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, 'if Mary were not soperfectly simple.  Aunt Melicent managed to abstract all romance, and Inever regretted it so little.  She has looked after him merely becauseit came in her way as a form of kindness, and is too much his governessfor anything of the other sort.''So you really do not wish for the other sort?' said Mrs. Frost, halfmortified, as if it were a slight to her boy.'I don't know how her father might take it,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, eagerto disarm, her.  'With his grand expectations, and his view of thestate of this property, he might make difficulties.  He is fond ofexpressing his contempt for needy nobility, and I am afraid, after allthat has passed, that this would be the last case in which he wouldmake an exception.''Yet you say he is fond of Mary.''Very fond.  If anything would triumph over his dislike, it would behis affection for her, but I had rather my poor Mary had not to put itto the proof.  And, after all, I don't think it the safest way for amarriage, that the man should be the most attractive, and the woman themost--''Sensible!  Say it, Mary--that is the charm in my nephew's eyes.''Your great-nephew is the point!  No, no, Aunt Kitty; you are under adelusion.  The kindness to Mary is no more than 'auld lang-syne,' andbecause he thinks her too impossible.  He cannot afford for his son tomarry anything but a grand unquestionable heiress.  Mary's fortune,besides, depending on speculations, would be nothing to what LadyFitzjocelyn ought to have.''For shame!  I think better of him.  I believe he would be unworldlywhen Louis's happiness was concerned.''To return to James,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, decidedly: 'I am glad thathis uncle should have declared his intentions.''Oh, my dear, we are quite used to that.  I am only glad that Jem takesno heed.  We have had enough of that!--for my own part,' and the tearsarose, 'I never expect that poor Oliver will think he has done enoughin my lifetime.  These things do so grow on a man!  If I had but kepthim at home!''It might have been the same.''There would have been something to divide his attention.  His brotherused to be a sort of idol; he seemed to love him the more for hisquiet, easy ways, and to delight in waiting on him.  I do believe hedelays, because he cannot bear to come home without Henry!'Mrs. Ponsonby preferred most topics to that of Mrs. Frost's sons, andwas relieved by the sight of the young people returning across thelawn--Fitzjocelyn with his ash stick, but owing a good deal of supportto Mary's firm, well-knit arm.  They showed well together: evenlameness could not disfigure the grace of his leisurely movements; andthe bright changefulness and delicacy of his face contrasted well withthe placid nobleness of her composed expression, while her complexionwas heightened and her eyes lighted by exercise, so that she was almosthandsome.  She certainly had been looking uncommonly well lately.  Wasthis the way they were to walk together through life?But Mrs. Ponsonby had known little of married life save the troubles,and she was doubly anxious for her daughter's sake.  She exceedinglyfeared unformed characters, and natures that had no root in themselves.Mary's husband must not lean on her for strength.She was glad, as with new meaning, she watched their proceedings, tosee how easily, and as a matter of course, Louis let Mary bring hisfootstool and his slipper, fetch his books, each at the proper time,read Spanish with him, and make him look out the words in thedictionary when he knew them by intuition, remind him of orders to bewritten for his buildings, and manage him as her pupil.  If she ruled,it was with perfect calmness and simplicity, and the playfulness wasthat of brother and sister, not even with the coquettish intimacy ofcousinhood.The field was decidedly open to Roland Dynevor, alias James Frost.Mrs. Ponsonby was loth to contemplate that contingency, though in allobedience, she exposed her daughter to the infection.  He was expectedon that afternoon, bringing his sister with him, for he had notwithstood the united voices that entreated him to become Fitzjocelyn'stutor during the vacation, and the whole party had promised to remainfor the present as guests at Ormersfield.Louis, in high spirits, offered to drive Mrs. Ponsonby to meet thetravellers at the station; and much did he inflict on her poorshattered nerves by the way.  He took no servant, that there might bethe more room, and perched aloft on the driving seat, he could only usehis indefatigable tongue by leaning back with his head turned round toher.  She kept a sharp lookout ahead; but all her warnings of comingperils only caused him to give a moment's attention to the horses andthe reins, before he again turned backwards to resume his discourse.In the town, his head was more in the right direction, for he wasnodding and returning greetings every moment; he seemed to have abowing acquaintance with all the world, and when he drew up at thestation, reached down several times to shake hands with figures whomhis father would barely have acknowledged; exchanging good-humouredinquiries or congratulations with almost every third person.Scarcely had the train dashed up before Mrs. Ponsonby was startled by ashout of 'He's there himself!  Louis!  Louis!' and felt, as well assaw, the springing ascent to the box of a tall apparition, in a scantylilac cotton dress, an outgrown black mantle, and a brown straw bonnet,scarcely confining an overprofusion of fair hair. Louis let go thereins to catch hold of both hands, and cry, 'Well, old Giraffe! whathave you done with Jem?''Seeing to the luggage!  You won't let him turn me out!  I must sithere!''You must have manners,' said Louis; 'look round, and speak rationallyto Mrs. Ponsonby.''I never saw she was there!' and slightly colouring, the 'Giraffe'erected her length, turned round a small insignificant face slightlyfreckled, with hazel eyes, as light as if they had been grey; andstretched down a hand to be shaken by her new relation, but she waschiefly bent on retaining her elevation.'There, Jem!' she cried exultingly, as he came forth, followed by thetrunks and portmanteaus.'Madcap!' he said; 'but I suppose the first day of the holidays must beprivileged.  Ha! Fitzjocelyn, you're the right man in the right place,whatever Clara is.'So they drove off, James sitting by Mrs. Ponsonby, and taking care toinform her that, in spite of her preposterous height, Clara was onlysixteen, he began to ask anxious questions as to Fitzjocelyn'srecovery, while she looked up at the pair in front, and thought, fromthe appearance of things, that even Louis's tongue was more thanrivalled, for the newcomer seemed to say a sentence in the time he tookin saying a word.  Poor Mrs. Ponsonby! she would not have been happierhad she known in which pair of hands the reins were!'And Louis! how are you?' cried Clara, as soon as this point had beengained; 'are you able to walk?''After a fashion.''And does your ankle hurt you?''Only if I work it too hard.  One would think that lounging had becomea virtue instead of a vice, to hear the way I am treated.''You look--' began Clara.  'But oh, Louis!' cried she, in a sort ofhesitating wonder, 'what! a moustache?''Don't say a word:' he lowered his voice.  'Riding is against orders,but I cannot miss the Yeomanry, under the present aspect of affairs.''The invasion!  A man in the train was talking of the war steamers, butJem laughed.  Do you believe in it?''It is a time when a display of loyalty and national spirit may turnthe scale.  I am resolved to let no trifle prevent me from doing mypart,' he said, colouring with enthusiasm.'You are quite right,' cried Clara.  'You ought to take your vassals,like a feudal chief!   I am sure the defence of one's country ought tooutweigh everything.''Exactly so.  Our volunteer forces are our strength and glory, and area happy meeting of all classes in the common cause.  But say nothing,Clara, or granny will take alarm, and get an edict from Walby againstme.''Dear granny!  But I wish we were going home to the Terrace.''Thank you.  How flattering!''You would be always in and out, and it would be so much morecomfortable.  Is Lord Ormersfield at home?''No, he will not come till legislation can bear London no longer.''Oh!'--with a sound of great relief.'You don't know how kind he has been,' said Louis, eagerly.  'You willfind it out when you are in the house with him.'Clara laughed, but sighed.  'I think we should have had more fun athome.''What! than with me for your host?  Try what I can do.  Besides, youoverlook Mary.''But she has been at school!''Well!''I didn't bargain for school-girls at home!''I should not have classed Mary in that category.''Don't ask me to endure any one who has been at school!  Oh, Louis! ifyou could only guess--if you would only speak to Jem not to send meback to that place--''Aunt Kitty will not consent, I am sure, if you are really unhappythere, my poor Clara.''No! no! I am ordered not to tell granny.  It would only vex her, andJem says it must be.   I don't want her to be vexed, and if I tell you,I may be able to keep it in!'Out poured the whole flood of troubles, unequal in magnitude, but mosttrying to the high-spirited girl.  Formal walks, silent meals, setmanners, perpetual French, were a severe trial, but far worse was thecompanionship.  Petty vanities, small disputes, fretful jealousies,insincere tricks, and sentimental secrets, seemed to Clara a great dealmore contemptible than the ignorance, indolence, abrupt manners andboyish tastes which brought her into constant disgrace--and thereseemed to be one perpetual chafing and contradiction, which made hermiserable.  And a further confidence could not help following, thoughwith a warning that Jem must not hear it, for she did not mind, and hespent every farthing on her that he could afford.  She had been teasedabout her dress, told that her friends were mean and shabby, andrejected as a walking companion, because she had no parasol, and thatwas vulgar.'I am sure I wanted to walk with none of them,' said Clara, 'and whenour English governess advised me to get one, I told her I would give into no such nonsense, for only vulgar people cared about them. Such ascrape I got into!   Well, then Miss Salter, whose father is a knight,and who thinks herself the great lady of the school, always bridledwhenever she saw me, and, at last, Lucy Raynor came whispering up, tobeg that I would contradict that my grandmamma kept a school, for MissSalter was so very particular.''I should like to have heard your contradiction.''I never would whisper, least of all to Lucy Raynor, so I stood up inthe midst, and said, as clear as I could, that my grandmother hadalways earned an honest livelihood by teaching little boys, and that Imeant to do the same, for nothing would ever make me have anything todo with girls.''That spoilt it,' said Louis--'the first half was dignified.''What was the second?''Human nature,' said Louis.'I see,' said Clara.  'Well, they were famously scandalized, and thatwas all very nice, for they let me alone.  But you brought far worse onme, Louis.''I!''Ay!  'Twas my own fault, though, but I couldn't help it.  You mustknow, they all are ready to bow down to the ninety-ninth part of aLord's little finger; and Miss Brown--that's the teacher--always readsall the fashionable intelligence as if it were the Arabian Nights, andimparts little bits to Miss Salter and her pets; and so it was that Iheard, whispered across the table, the dreadful accident to ViscountFitzjocelyn!''Did nobody write to you?''Yes--I had a letter from granny, and another from Jem by the nextmorning's post, or I don't know what I should have done.  Granny wastoo busy to write at first; I didn't three parts believe it before, butthere was no keeping in at that first moment.''What did you do?''I gave one great scream, and flew at the newspaper.  The worst was,that I had to explain, and then--oh! it was enough to make one sick.Why had I not said I was Lord Ormersfield's cousin?  I turned into afine aristocratic-looking girl on the spot!  Miss Salter came andfondled, and wanted me to walk with her!''Of course; she had compassion on your distress--amiable feeling!''She only wanted to ask ridiculous questions, whether you werehandsome.''What did you reply?''I told them not a word, except that my brother was going to be yourtutor.  When I saw Miss Salter setting off by this line, I made Jemtake second-class tickets, that she might be ashamed of me.''My dear Giraffe, bend down your neck, and don't take such acommonplace, conventional view of your schoolfellows.''Conventional! ay, all agree because they know it by experience,' saidClara--'I'm sure I do!''Then take the other side--see the best.''Jem says you go too far, and are unreasonable with your theory ofmaking the best of every one.''By no means.  I always made the worst of Frampton, and now I know whatinjustice I did him.  I never saw greater kindness and unselfishnessthan he has shown me.''I should like to know what best you would make of these girls!''You have to try that!''Can I get any possible good by staying?''A vast deal.''I'm sure Italian, and music, and drawing, are not a good compared withtruth, and honour, and kindness.''All those things only grow by staying wherever we may happen to be,unless it is by our own fault.''Tell me what good you mean!''Learning not to hate, learning to mend your gloves.  Don't jerk thereins, Clara, or you'll get me into a scrape.'Clara could extract no more, nor did she wish it, for having relievedher mind by the overflow, she only wanted to forget her misfortunes.Her cousin Louis was her chief companion, they had always feltthemselves on the same level of nonsense, and had unreservedly sharedeach other's confidences and projects; and ten thousand bits ofintelligence were discussed with mutual ardour, while Clara's ecstasybecame uncontrollable as she felt herself coming nearer to hergrandmother.  She finally descended with a bound almost as distressingto her brother as her ascent had been, and leapt at once to the embraceof Mrs. Frost, who stood there, petting, kissing her, and playfullythreatening all sorts of means to stop her growth. Clara reared up hergiraffe figure, boasting of having overtopped all the world present,except Louis!  She made but a cold, abrupt response to her cousinMary's greeting, and presently rushed upstairs in search of dear oldJane, with an impetus that made Mrs. Frost sigh, and say, 'Poor child!how happy she is;' and follow her, smiling, while James looked annoyed.'Never mind, Jem,' said Louis, who had thrown himself at full length onthe sofa, 'she deserves compensation.  Let it fizz.''And undo everything!  What do you say to that, Mary?''Mary is to say nothing,' said Louis, 'I mean that poor child to haveher swing.''I shall leave you and James to settle that,' said Mary, quitting them.'I am very anxious that Clara should form a friendship with Mary,' saidJames, gravely.'Friendships can't be crammed down people's throats,' said Louis, in aweary indifferent tone.'You who have been three months with Mary--!''Mary and I did not meet with labels round our necks that here were apair of friends.  Pray do you mean to send that victim of yours back toschool?''Don't set her against it.  I have been telling her of the necessityall the way home.''Is it not to be taken into consideration that a bad--not to say abase-style of girl seems to prevail there?''I can't help it, Fitzjocelyn,' cried Jem, ruffling up his hair, as healways did when vexed.  'Girls fit to be her companions don't go toschool--or to no school within my means.  This place has soundsuperiors, and she must be provided with a marketable stock ofaccomplishments, so there's no choice.  I can trust her not to forgetthat she is a Dynevor.''Query as to the benefit of that recollection.''What do you mean?''That I never saw evils lessened by private self-exaltation.''Very philosophical! but as a matter of fact, what was it but the senseof my birth that kept me out of all the mischief I was exposed to atthe Grammar School!''I always thought it had been something more respectable,' said Louis,his voice growing more sleepy.'Pshaw!  Primary motives being understood, secondary stand common wearthe best.''As long as they don't eat into the primary.''The long and short of it is,' exclaimed James, impatiently, 'that wemust have no nonsense about Clara.  It is pain enough to me to inflictall this on her, but I would not do it, if I thought it were more thanmere discomfort.  Her principles are fixed, she is above thesetrumperies.  But you have the sense to see that her whole welfare maydepend on whether she gets fitted to be a valuable accomplishedgoverness or a mere bonne, tossed about among nursery-maids.  There'swhere poverty galls!  Don't go and set my grandmother on!  If she grewwretched and took Clara away, it would be mere condemning of her torudeness and struggling!''Very well,' said Louis, as James concluded the brief sentences,uttered in the bitterness of his heart, 'one bargain I make.  If I amto hold my tongue about school, I will have my own way with her in theholidays.''I tell you, Louis, that it is time to have done with childishness.Clara is growing up--I won't have you encourage her in all that wildflightiness--I didn't want to have had her here at all!  If she is everto be a reasonable, conformable woman, it is high time to begin.  Ican't have you undoing the work of six months! when Mary might makesome hand of her, too--'James stopped.  Louis's eyes were shut, and he appeared to becompletely asleep.  If silence were acquiescence, it was at leastgained; and so he went away, and on returning, intended to impress hislessons of reserve on Clara and her grandmother, but was prevented byfinding Mrs. Ponsonby and her daughter already in the library,consulting over some letters, while Clara sat at her grandmother's kneein the full felicity of hearing all the Northwold news.The tea was brought in, and there was an inquiry for Louis.  He cameslowly forward from the sofa at the dark end of the room, butdisclaimed, of course, the accusation of fatigue.'A very bad sign,' said James, 'that you have been there all this timewithout our finding it out.  Decidedly, you have taken me in. You don'tlook half as well as you promised.  You are not the same colour tenminutes together, just now white, and now--how you redden!''Don't, Jem!' cried Louis, as each observation renewed the tide ofburning crimson in his cheek.  'It is like whistling to a turkey-cock.If I had but the blue variety, it might be more comfortable, as well asmore interesting.'Clara went into a choking paroxysm of laughter, which her brother triedto moderate by a look, and Louis rendered more convulsive by quoting'Marked you his cheek of heavenly blue,'and looked with a mischievous amusement at James's ill-suppresseddispleasure at the merriment that knew no bounds, till even Mrs. Frost,who had laughed at first as much at James's distress as at Louis'stravestie or Clara's fun, thought it time to check it by saying, 'Youare right, Jem, he is not half so strong as he thinks himself.  Youmust keep him in good order.''Take care, Aunt Kitty,' said Louis; 'you'll make me restive.  A tutorand governess both!  I appeal!  Shall we endure it, Clara?''Britons never shall be slaves!' was the eager response.'Worthy of the daughter of the Pendragons,' said Louis; 'but it losthalf its effect from being stifled with laughing.  You should commandyourself, Clara, when you utter a sentiment.  I beg to repeat MissFrost Dynevor's novel and striking speech, and declare my adhesion,'Britons never shall be slaves!'  Liberty, fraternity, and equality!Tyrants, beware!''You ungrateful boy!' said Mrs. Frost; 'that's the way you use yourgood governess!''Only the way the nineteenth century treats all its good governesses,'said Louis.'When it gets past them,' said Mary, smiling.  'I hope you did notthink I was not ready to give you up to your tutor?'Mary found the renunciation more complete than perhaps she hadexpected.  The return of his cousins had made Fitzjocelyn a differentcreature.  He did indeed read with James for two hours every morning,but this was his whole concession to discipline; otherwise he was morewayward and desultory than ever, and seemed bent on teazing James, andamusing himself by making Clara extravagantly wild and idle.  Tired ofhis long confinement, he threw off all prudence with regard to health,as well as all struggle with his volatile habits; and the more he wasscolded, the more he seemed to delight in making meekly ridiculousanswers and going his own way.  Sometimes he and Clara would make anappointment, at some unearthly hour, to see Mrs. Morris make cheese, orto find the sun-dew blossom open, or to sketch some effect of morningsun.  Louis would afterwards be tired and unhinged the whole day, butnever convinced, only capable of promoting Clara's chatter; and readythe next day to stand about with her in the sun at the cottages, to theincrease of her freckles, and the detriment of his ankle.  Theirfrolics would have been more comprehensible had she been moreattractive; but her boisterous spirits were not engaging to any one butLouis, who seemed to enjoy them in proportion to her brother'sannoyance, and to let himself down into nearly equal folly.He gave some slight explanation to Mary, one day when he had beenreminded of one of their former occupations--'Ah! I have no time forthat now.  You see there's nobody else to protect that poor Giraffefrom being too rational.''Is that her great danger?' said Mary.'Take my advice, Mary, let her alone.  Follow your own judgment, andnot poor Jem's fidgets.  He wants to be 'father, mother both, anduncle, all in one,' and so he misses his natural vocation of elderbrother.  He wants to make a woman of her before her time; and now hehas his way with her at school, he shall let her have a littlecompensation at home.''Is this good for her?  Is it the only way she can be happy?''It is her way, at least; and if you knew the penance she undergoes atschool, you would not grudge it to her.  She is under his orders not todisclose the secrets of her prison-house, lest they should disquietAunt Catharine; and she will not turn to you, because--I beg yourpardon, Mary--she has imbibed a distrust of all school-girls; andbesides, Jem has gone and insisted on your being her friend more thanhuman nature can stand.''It is a great pity,' said Mary, smiling, but grieved; 'I should nothave been able to do her much good--but if I could only try!''I'll tell you,' said Louis, coming near, with a look betweenconfidence and embarrassment; 'is it in the power of woman to make herdress look rather more like other people's without inflaming the bloodof the Dynevors--cautiously, you know?  Even my father does not dare togive her half-a-sovereign for pocket-money; but do ask your mother ifshe could not be made such that those girls should not make her theirlaughingstock.''You don't mean it!''Aye, I do; and she has not even told James, lest he should wish tospend more upon her.  She glories in it, but that is hardly wholesome.''Then she told you?''Oh, yes!  We always were brothers!  It is great fun to have her here!I always wished it, and I'm glad it has come before they have made herget out of the boy.  He will be father to the woman some day; and thatwill be soon enough, without teasing her.'Mary wished to ask whether all this were for Clara's good, but shecould not very well put such a question to him; and, after all, it wasnoticeable that, noisy and unguarded as Clara's chatter was, therenever was anything that in itself should not have been said: though hermanner with Louis was unceremonious, it was never flirting; andrefinement of mind was as evident in her rough-and-ready manner as inhis high-bred quietness.  This seemed to account for Mrs. Frost'snon-interference, which at first amazed her niece; but Aunt Catharine'selement was chiefly with boys, and her love for Clara, though verygreat, showed itself chiefly in still regarding her as a mere child,petting her to atone for the privations of school, and while she mightassent to the propriety of James's restrictions, always laughing orlooking aside when they were eluded.James argued and remonstrated.  He said a great deal, always had theadvantage in vehemence, and appeared to reduce Louis to a condition ofquaint debonnaire indifference; and warfare seemed the normal state ofthe cousins, the one fiery and sensitive, the other cool and impassive,and yet as appropriate to each other as the pepper and the cucumber, toborrow a bon mot from their neighbour, Sydney Calcott.If Jem came to Mary brimful of annoyance with Louis's folly, a mildword of assent was sufficient to make him turn round and do battle withthe imaginary enemy who was always depreciating Fitzjocelyn.  To makeup for Clara's avoidance of Mary, he rendered her his prime counsellor,and many an hour was spent in pacing up and down the garden in thesummer twilight; while she did her best to pacify him by suggestingthat thorough relaxation would give spirits and patience for Clara'snext half year, and that it might be wiser not to overstrain his ownundefined authority, while the lawful power, Aunt Catharine, did notinterfere.  Surely she might safely be trusted to watch over her owngranddaughter; and while Clara was so perfectly simple, and Louis suchas he was, more evil than good might result from inculcating reserve.At any rate, it was hard to meddle with the poor child's few weeks ofhappiness, and to this James always agreed; and then he came the nextday to relieve himself by fighting the battle over again.  Soconstantly did this occur, that Aunt Kitty, in her love of mischief,whispered to Mrs. Ponsonby that she only hoped the two viziers wouldnot quarrel about the three thousand sequins, three landed estates, andthree slaves.Still, Louis's desertion had left unoccupied so many of the hours ofMary's time that he had previously absorbed, that her mother watchedanxiously to see whether she would feel the blank.  But she treated itas a matter of course.  She had attended to her cousin when he neededher, and now that he had regained his former companion, Clara, sheresigned him without effort or mortification, as far as could be seen.She was forced to fall back on other duties, furnishing the house,working for every one, and reading some books that Louis had broughtbefore her.  The impulse of self-improvement had not expired with hisattention, and without any shadow of pique she was always ready to playthe friend and elder sister whenever he needed her, and to be gratefulwhen he shared her interests or pursuits.  So the world went till LordOrmersfield's return caused Clara's noise to subside so entirely, thather brother was sufficiently at ease to be exceedingly vivacious andentertaining, and Mrs. Ponsonby hoped for a great improvement in thestate of affairs.CHAPTER X.THE BETTER PART OF VALOUR.For who is he, whose chin is but enrichedWith one appearing hair, that will not followThese culled and choice-drawn cavaliers 'gainst France?Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege.King Henry V.The next forenoon, Mary met James in the park, wandering in search ofhis pupil, whom he had not seen since they had finished their morning'swork in the study.  Some wild freak with Clara was apprehended, butwhile they were conferring, Mary exclaimed, 'What's that?' as a clatterand clank met her ear.'Only the men going out to join old Brewster's ridiculous yeomanry,'said Jem.'Oh, I should like to see them,' cried Mary, running to the top of abank, whence she could see into the hollow road leading from thestables to the lodge.  Four horsemen, the sun glancing on theirhelmets, were descending the road, and a fifth, at some distance ahead,was nearly out of sight.  'Ah,' she said, 'Louis must have been seeingthem off.  How disappointed he must be not to go!''I wish I was sure--' said James, with a start.  'I declare his follyis capable of anything!  Why did I not think of it sooner?'Clara here rushed upon them with her cameleopard gallop, sending hervoice before her, 'Can you see them?''Scarcely,' said Mary, making room for her.'Where's Louis'!' hastily demanded her brother.'Gone to the yeomanry meeting,' said Clara, looking in their faces inthe exultation of producing a sensation.James was setting off with a run to intercept him, but it was too late;and Clara loudly laughed as she said, 'You can't catch him.''I've done with him!' cried James.  'Can madness go further?''James!  I am ashamed of you,' cried the Giraffe, with greatstateliness.  'Here are the enemy threatening our coasts, and our townsfull of disaffection and sedition; and when our yeomanry are lukewarmenough to go off grouse-shooting instead of attending to their duty,what is to become of the whole country if somebody does not make anexertion?  The tranquillity of all England may depend on the face ouryeomanry show.''On Lieutenant Fitzjocelyn's yellow moustache!  Pray how long have youbeen in the secret of these heroic intentions?''Ever since I came home.''We all knew that he meant to go out if he could,' said Mary, in a tonecalculated to soothe Jem, and diminish Clara's glory in being soleconfidante, 'but we did not think him well enough.  I hope it will dohim no harm.''Exertions in a good cause can do no harm!' boldly declared Clara;then, with sudden loss of confidence, 'do you really think it will?''Just cripple him for life,' said James.'Mr. Walby wished him not to attempt riding,' said Mary.  'He thinksany strain on the ankle just now might hurt him very much; but it maybe over caution.''Mr. Walby is an old woman,' said Clara.  'Now, Jem, you said soyourself.  Besides, it is all for his duty!  Of course, he would riskanything for the good of his country.''Don't say another word, Clara,' exclaimed James, 'or you will drive medistracted with your folly.  One grain of sense, and even you wouldhave stopped it; but neither you nor he could miss a chance of hisfiguring in that masquerade dress!  Look at the sun, exactly like ared-hot oven!  We shall have him come home as ill as ever!'Clara had another milder and more sorrowful version of the scoldingfrom her grandmother, but Lord Ormersfield escaped the day's anxiety bybeing so busy with Richardson, that he never emerged from the study,and did not miss his son.It was an exceedingly sultry day, and the hopeful trusted that Louiswould be forced to give in, before much harm could be done; but it wasnot till five o'clock that the hoofs were heard on the gravel; and Jemwent out to revenge himself with irony for his uneasiness.'I hope you are satisfied,' he said, 'dulce est pro patria mori.'Louis was slowly dismounting, and as he touched the ground gave aslight cry of pain, and caught at the servant's arm for support.'No more than I expected,' said James, coming to help him; and at thesame moment Lord Ormersfield was heard exclaiming--'Fitzjocelyn--! what imprudence!''Take care,' hastily interrupted James, finding Louis leaninghelplessly against him, unable to speak or stand, and his flushed cheekrapidly changing to deadly white.They lifted him up the steps into the hall, where he signed to be laiddown on the seat of the cool north window, and trying to smile, said'it was only the hot sun, and his foot aching rather; it would soongo off.'  And when, with much pain and difficulty, Frampton hadreleased his swollen foot from the regulation-boot, into which he hadfoolishly thrust it, he went on more fluently.  'He had thought it hisduty, especially when Mr. Shaw, the captain of his troop, had chosen togo away--he had believed it could do no harm--he was sure it was only alittle present discomfort, and in the present crisis--'He addressed his aunt, but his eyes were on his father; and when heheard not a single word from him, he suddenly ceased, and presently,laying his head down on the window-sill, he begged that no one wouldstand and watch him, he should come into the library in a few minutes.The few minutes lasted, however, till near dinnertime, when he calledto Mary, as she was coming downstairs, and asked her to help him intothe library; he could remain no longer exposed to Frampton's pity, asdinner went in.He dragged himself along with more difficulty than he had found forweeks, and sank down on the sofa with a sigh of exhaustion; whileClara, who was alone in the room, reared herself up from an easy-chair,where she had been sitting in an attitude that would have been despairto her mistress.'Ha, Clara!' said Louis, presently; 'you look as if you had been theobject of invective?''I don't care,' exclaimed Clara,  'I know you were in the good oldcause.''Conde at Jarnac, Charles XII. at Pultowa--which?' said Louis.  'Ithought of both myself--only, unluckily, I made such frightfulblunders.  I was thankful to my men for bringing me off, like othergreat commanders.''Oh, Louis! but at least you were in your place--you set the example.''Unluckily, these things descend from the sublime to the other thing,when one is done up, and beginning to doubt whether self-will cannotsometimes wear a mask.''I'm sure they are all quite cross enough to you already, without yourbeing cross to yourself.''An ingenious and elegant impersonal,' said Louis.Clara rushed out into the garden to tell the stiff old rose-trees thatif Lord Ormersfield were savage now, he would be more horrid than ever.Meanwhile, Louis drew a long sigh, murmuring, 'Have I gone and vexedhim again?  Mary, have I been very silly?'The half-piteous doubt and compunction had something childish, whichmade her smile as she answered: 'You had better have done as you weretold.''The surest road to silliness,' said Louis, whose tendency was tomoralize the more, the more tired he was, 'is to think one is going todo something fine!  It is dismal work to come out at the other end ofan illusion.''With a foot aching as, I am afraid, yours does.''I should not mind that, but that I made such horrid mistakes!'These weighed upon his mind so much, that he went on, half aloud,rehearsing the manoeuvres and orders in which he had failed, from thedifficulty of taking the command of his troop for the first time, whenbewildered with pain and discomfort.  The others came in, and Jameslooked rabid; Louis stole a glance now and then at his father, whopreserved a grave silence, while Clara stood aloof, comparing theprostrate figure in blue and silver to all the wounded knights inhistory or fiction.He was past going in to dinner, and the party were 'civil andmelancholy,' Mrs. Frost casting beseeching looks at her grandson, whosat visibly chafing at the gloom that rested on the Earl's brow, andwhich increased at each message of refusal of everything but icedwater.  At last Mrs. Frost carried off some grapes from the dessert totempt him, and as she passed through the open window--her readiest wayto the library--the Earl's thanks concluded with a disconsolate murmur'quite ill,' and 'abominable folly;' a mere soliloquy and nearlyinaudible, but sufficient spark to produce the explosion.'Fitzjocelyn's motives deserve no such name as folly,' James cried,with stammering eagerness.'I know you did not encourage him,' said Lord Ormersfield.'I did,' said a young, clear voice, raised in alarm at her ownboldness; 'Jem knew nothing of it, but I thought it right.'Lord Ormersfield made a little courteous inclination with his head,which annihilated Clara upon the spot.'I doubt whether I should have done right in striving to prevent him,'said James.  'Who can appreciate the moral effect of heroism?''Heroism in the cause of a silver jacket!''Now, that is the most unfair thing in the world!' cried James, alwaysmost violent when he launched out with his majestic cousin. 'There isnot a man living more careless of his appearance.  You do him justice,Mrs. Ponsonby?''Yes, I do not believe that vanity had anything to do with it.  A manwho would bear what he has done to-day would do far more.''If it had been for any reasonable cause,' said the Earl.'You may not understand it, Lord Ormersfield,' exclaimed James, 'but Ido.  In these times of disaffection, a sound heart, and whole spirit,in our volunteer corps may be the saving of the country; and who cantell what may be the benefit of such an exhibition of self-sacrificingzeal.  The time demands every man's utmost, and neither risk norsuffering can make him flinch from his duty.''My dear Jem,' said a voice behind him at the window, 'I never see myfollies so plainly as when you are defending them.  Come and help me upstairs; Granny is ordering me up; a night's rest will set all smooth.'It was not a night's rest, neither did it set things smooth.  In vaindid Louis assume a sprightly countenance, and hold his head andshoulders erect and stately; there was no concealing that he was verypale, and winced at every step.  His ankle had been much hurt by thepressure of the stirrup, and he was not strong enough to bear withimpunity severe pain, exertion, and fatigue on a burning summer day. Itwas evident that his recovery had been thrown back for weeks.His father made no reproaches, but was grievously disappointed.  Hisexaggerated estimate of his son's discretion had given place to a noless misplaced despondency, quite inaccessible to Mrs. Ponsonby'sconsolations as to the spirit that had prompted the performance.  Hecould have better understood a youth being unable to forego theexhibition of a handsome person and dress, than imagine that any one ofmoderate sense could either expect the invasion, or use these means ofaverting it.  If imagination was to be allowed for, so much the worse.A certain resemblance to the childish wilfulness with which his wifehad trifled with her health, occurred to him, increasing his vexationby gloomy shadows of the past.His silent mortification and kind anxiety went to his son's heart.Louis was no less disappointed in himself, in finding his own judgmentas untrustworthy as ever, since the exploit that had been a perpetualfeast to his chivalrous fancy had turned out a mere piece ofself-willed imprudence, destroying all the newly-bestowed andhighly-valued good opinion of his father; and even in itself,incompetently executed.  'He had made a fool of himself every way.'That had been James's first dictum, and he adopted it from conviction.In the course of the day, goodnatured, fat Sir Gilbert Brewster, thecolonel of the yeomanry, who had been seriously uneasy at his looks,and had tried to send him home, rode over to inquire for him,complimenting him on being 'thorough game to the last.'  Louis relievedhis mind by apologies for his blunders, whereupon he learnt that hisgood colonel had never discovered them, and now only laughed at them,and declared that they were mere trifles to what the whole corps,officers and men, committed whenever they met, and no one cared exceptone old sergeant who had been in the Light Dragoons. Louis's veryrepentance for them was another piece of absurdity.  He smiled, indeed,but seemed to give himself up as a hopeless subject. His spiritsflagged as they had not done throughout his illness, and, unwell,languid, and depressed, he spent his days without an attempt to rally.He was only too conscious of his own inconsistency, but he had notenergy enough to resume any of the habits that Mary had so diligentlynursed, neglected even his cottage-building, would not trouble himselfto consider the carpenter's questions, forgot messages, put offengagements, and seemed to have only just vigour enough to bedesultory, tease James, and spoil Clara.Lord Ormersfield became alarmed, and called in doctors, who recommendedsea air, and James suggested a secluded village on the Yorkshire coast,where some friends had been reading in the last long vacation.  Thiswas to be the break-up of the party; Mrs. Frost and the two Marys wouldresort to Dynevor Terrace, Clara would return to school, and Jamesundertook the charge of Louis, who took such exceedingly little heed tothe arrangements, that Jem indignantly told him that he cared neitherfor himself nor anybody else.CHAPTER XI.A HALTING PROPOSAL.Shallow.  Will you upon good dowry, marry her?Slender.  I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request.Merry Wives of Windsor.The first thing that Louis did appear to care for was a letter thatarrived about three days previous to their departure, addressed to'Lord Fitsgosling, Hawmsfield Park, Northwold.'  Rather too personal,as he observed, he must tell his correspondent that it hurt hisfeelings.  The correspondent was Tom Madison, whose orthography laggedbehind his other attainments, if his account might be trusted of 'theylectures on Kemistry.'  His penmanship was much improved, and he wasprospering, with hopes of promotion and higher wages, when he shouldhave learnt to keep accounts.  He liked Mr. Dobbs and the chaplain, andwished to know how to send a crown per post to 'old granfer up atMarksedge; because he is too ignorant to get a border sinned.  Please,my lord, give my duty to him and all enquiring friends, and to Schirlt,up at the Teras.'Highly amused, Louis lay on the uppermost step from the library window,in the cool summer evening, laughing over the letter. 'There, AuntKitty, he said, 'I commit that tender greeting to your charge,' and asshe looked doubtful, 'Yes, do, there's a good aunt and mistress.''I am afraid I should not be a good mistress; I ought not to sanctionit.''Better sanction it above board than let it go on by stealth,' saidLouis.  'You are her natural protector.''So much the more reason against it!  I ought to wish her to forgetthis poor boy of yours.''Ay, and light Hymen's torch with some thriving tallow chandler, whowould marry a domestic slave as a good speculation, without one sparkof the respectful chivalrous love that--''Hush! you absurd boy.''Well, then, if you won't, I shall go to Jane.  The young ladies areall too cold and too prudent, but Jane has a soft spot in her heart,and will not think true love is confined within the rank that keeps agig.  I did think Aunt Kitty had been above vulgar prejudices.''Not above being coaxed by you, you gosling, you,' said Aunt Kitty;'only you must come out of the dew, the sun is quite gone.''Presently,' said Louis, as she retreated by the window.'I would not have been too cold or too prudent!' said Clara.'I well believe it!''You will be one if you are not the other,' said Mary, gathering herwork up, with the dread of one used to tropical dews.  'Are not youcoming in?''When I can persuade myself to write a letter of good advice, a thing Ihate.''Which,' asked Mary; 'giving or receiving it?''Receiving, of course.'--'Giving, of course,' said Clara and Louis atthe same instant.'Take mine, then,' said Mary, 'and come out of the damp.''Mary is so tiresome about these things!' cried Clara, as their cousinretreated.  'Such fidgetting nonsense.''I once argued it with her,' said Louis, without stirring; 'and she hadthe right side, that it is often more self-denying to take care ofone's health, than to risk it for mere pleasure or heedlessness.''There's no dew!' said Clara; 'and if there was, it would not hurt, andif it did, I should be too glad to catch a cold, or something to keepme at home.  Oh, if I could only get into a nice precarious state ofhealth!''You would soon wish yourself at school, or anywhere else, so that youcould feel some life in your limbs,' half sighed Louis.'I've more than enough!  Oh! how my feet ache to run! and my throatfeels stifled for want of making a noise, and the hatefulness of alwayssitting upright, with my shoulders even!  Come, you might pity me alittle this one night, Louis: I know you do, for Jem is always tellingme not to let you set me against it.''No, I don't pity you.  Pity is next akin to contempt.''Nonsense, Louis.  Do be in earnest.''I have seldom seen the human being whom I could presume to pity:certainly not you, bravely resisting folly and temptation, and with sodear and noble a cause for working.''You mean, the hope of helping to maintain grandmamma.''Which you will never be able to do, unless you pass through thisordeal, and qualify yourself for skilled labour.''I know that,' said Clara; 'but the atmosphere there seems to poison,and take the vigour out of all they teach.  Oh, so different fromgranny teaching me my notes, or Jem teaching me French--''Growling at you--''He never growled half as much as, I deserved.  I cared to learn ofhim; but I don't care for anything now,--no, not for drawing, which youtaught me!  There's no heart in it!  The whole purpose is to getamazing numbers of marks and pass each other.  All dates and words, andgabble gabble!''Ay! there's an epitome of the whole world: all ambition, and vanity,and gabble gabble,' said Louis, sadly.  'And what is a gosling, that heshould complain?''You don't mean that in reality.  You are always merry.'Some mirth is because one does not always think, Clara; and when onedoes think deeply enough, there is better cheerfulness.''Deeply enough,' said Clara.  'Ah! I see.  Knowing that the world ofgabble is not what we belong to, only a preparation?  Is that it!''It is what I meant.''Ah I but how to make that knowledge help us.''There's the point.  Now and then, I think I see; but then I go off ona wrong tack: I get a silly fit, and a hopeless one, and lose my clue.And yet, after all, there is a highway; and wayfaring men, thoughfools, shall not err therein,' murmured Louis, as he gazed on the firststar of evening.'Oh! tell me how to see my highway at school!''If I only kept my own at home, I might.  But you have theadvantage--you have a fixed duty, and you always have kept hold of yourpurposes much better than I.''My purpose!' said Clara.  'I suppose that is to learn as fast as Ican, that I may get away from that place, and not be a burthen togranny and Jem.  Perhaps Jem will marry and be poor, and then I shallsend his sons to school and college.''And pray what are your social duties till that time comes?''That's plain enough,' said Clara: 'to keep my tone from beingdeteriorated by these girls.  Why, Louis, what's that for?' as, with abow and air of alarm, he hastily moved aside from her.'If you are so much afraid of being deteriorated--''Nonsense!  If you only once saw their trumpery cabals, and vanities,and mean equivocations, you would understand that the only thing to bedone is to keep clear of them; take the learning I am sent for, butavoid them!''And where is the golden rule all this time?' said Louis, very low.'But ought not one to keep out of what is wrong?''Yes, but not to stand aloof from what is not wrong.  Look out, not forwhat is inferior to yourself, but what is superior.  Ah! you despair;but, my Giraffe, will you promise me this?  Tell me, next Christmas, agood quality for every bad one you have found in them. You shake yourhead.  Nay, you must, for the credit of your sex.  I never found theman in whom there was not something to admire, and I had rather notsuppose that women are not better than men.  Will you promise?''I'll try, but--''But, mind, it takes kind offices to bring the blossoms out.There--that's pretty well, considering our mutual sentiments as to goodadvice.''Have you been giving me good advice?''Not bad, I hope.''I thought only people like--like Mary--could give advice.''Ah! your blindness about Mary invalidates your opinion of yourschoolfellows.  It shows that you do not deserve a good friend.''I've got you; I want no other.''Quite wrong.  Not only is she full of clear, kind, solid sense, like apillar to lean on, but she could go into detail with you in yourtroubles.  You have thrown away a great opportunity, and I am afraid Ihelped you.  I shall hold you in some esteem when you are--to concludesententiously--worthy of her friendship.'Clara's laugh was loud enough to bring out the Earl, to summon themauthoritatively out of the dew.  Louis sat apart, writing his letter;Clara, now and then, hovering near, curious to hear how he hadcorrected Tom's spelling.  He had not finished, when the ladies badehim good-night; and, as he proceeded with it, his father said, 'What isthat engrossing correspondence, Louis?''Such a sensible letter, that I am quite ashamed of it,' said Louis.'I wonder at the time you chose for writing, when you are so soon topart with our guests.''I have no excuse, if you think it uncivil.  I never have spirit to setabout anything till the sun is down.'His father began at once to speak softly: 'No, I intended no blame; Ionly cannot but wonder to see you so much engrossed with Clara Dynevor.''Poor child! she wants some compensation.''I have no doubt of your kind intentions; but it would be safer toconsider what construction may be placed on attentions so exclusive.'Louis looked up in blank, incredulous amazement, and then almostlaughingly exclaimed, 'Is that what you mean?  Why, she is an infant, ababy--''Not in appearance--''You don't know her, father,' said Louis.  'I love her with all myheart, and could not do more.  Why, she is, and always has been, myshe-younger-brother!''I am aware,' said the Earl, without acknowledging this peculiarrelationship, 'that this may appear very ridiculous, but experience hasshown the need of caution.  I should be concerned that your heedlessgood-nature should be misconstrued, so as to cause pain anddisappointment to her, or to lead you to neglect one who has everyclaim to your esteem and gratitude.'Louis was bewildered.  'I have been a wretch lately,' he said, 'but Idid not know I had been a bear.''I did not mean that you could be deficient in ordinary courtesy; but Ihad hoped for more than mere indifferent civility towards one eminentlycalculated--' Lord Ormersfield for once failed in his period.'Are we talking at cross purposes?' exclaimed Fitzjocelyn.  'What haveI been doing, or not doing?''If my meaning require explanation, it is needless to attempt any.-- Isyour ankle painful to-night?'Not a word more, except about his health, could Louis extract, and hewent to his room in extreme perplexity.  Again and again did he revolvethose words.  Quick as were his perceptions on most points, they wereslow where self-consciousness or personal vanity might have sharpenedthem; and it was new light to him that he had come to a time of lifethat could attach meaning to his attentions.Whom had he been neglecting?  What had his father been hoping?  Who waseminently calculated, and for what?It flashed upon him all at once.  'I see! I see!' he cried, and burstinto a laugh.Then came consternation, or something very like it.  He did not want tofeel embarked in manhood.  And then his far-away dream of a lady-lovehad been so transcendently fair, so unequalled in grace, so perfect inaccomplishments, so enthusiastic in self-devoted charity, allundefined, floating on his imagination in misty tints of glory! Thatall this should be suddenly brought down from cloudland, to sink intoMary Ponsonby, with the honest face and downright manner for whomromance and rapture would be positively ridiculous!Yet the notion would not be at once dismissed.  His declaration that hewould do anything to gratify his father had been too sincere for himlightly to turn from his suggestion, especially at a moment when he wasfull of shame at his own folly, and eagerness to retain the ground hehad lost in his father's opinion, and, above all, to make him happy.His heart thrilled and glowed as he thought of giving his father realjoy, and permanently brightening and enlivening that lonely, solitarylife.  Besides, who could so well keep the peace between him and hisfather, and save him by hints and by helpfulness from giving annoyance?He had already learnt to depend on her; she entered into all hisinterests, and was a most pleasant companion--so wise and good, thatthe most satisfactory days of his life had been passed under hermanagement, and he had only broken from it to 'play the fool.'  He wassick of his own volatile Quixotism, and could believe it a relief to bekept in order without trusting to his own judgment.  She had everyright to his esteem and affection, and the warm feeling he had for hercould only be strengthened by closer ties.  The unworldliness of theproject likewise weighed with him. Had she been a millionaire or aDuke's daughter, he would not have spent one thought on the matter; buthe was touched by seeing how his father's better feelings had conqueredall desire for fortune or connexion.And then Mary could always find everything he wanted!'I will do it!' he determined.  'Never was son more bound to considerhis father.  Of course, she will make a much better wife than Ideserve.  Most likely, my fancies would never have been fulfilled. Shewill save me from my own foolishness.  What ought a man to wish formore than a person sure to make him good?  And--well, after all, itcannot be for a long time.  They must write to Lima.  Perhaps they willwait till her father's return, or at least till I have taken my degree.'This last encouraging reflection always wound up the series thatperpetually recurred throughout that night of broken sleep; and when herose in the morning, he felt as if each waking had added a year to hislife, and looked at the glass to see whether he had not grown quiteelderly.'No, indeed!  I am ridiculously youthful, especially since I shaved offmy moustache in my rage at the Yeomanry mania!  I must systematicallyburn my cheeks, to look anything near her age!'  And he laughed athimself, but ended with a long-drawn sigh.He was in no state of mind to pause: he was tired of self-debate, andwas in haste to render the step irrevocable, and then fit himself toit; and he betook himself at once to the study, where he astonished hisfather by his commencement, with crimson cheeks--'I wished to speak toyou.  Last night I did not catch your meaning at once.''We will say no more about it,' was the kind answer.  'If you cannotturn your thoughts in that direction, there is an end of the matter.''I think,' said Louis, 'that I could.''My dear boy,' said the Earl, with more eagerness than he could quitecontrol, 'you must not imagine that I wish to influence yourinclinations unduly; but I must confess that what I have seen for thelast few months, has convinced me that nothing could better secure yourhappiness.''I believe so,' said Louis, gazing from the window.'Right,' cried the Earl, with more gladness and warmth than his son hadever seen in him;  'I am delighted that you appreciate such sterlingexcellence!  Yes, Louis,' and his voice grew thick, 'there is nothingelse to trust to.''I know it,' said Louis.  'She is very good.  She made me very happywhen I was ill.''You have seen her under the most favourable circumstances.  It is theonly sort of acquaintance to be relied on.  You have consulted your ownhappiness far more than if you had allowed yourself to be attracted bymere showy gifts.''I am sure she will do me a great deal of good,' said Louis, stillkeeping his eyes fixed on the evergreens.'You could have done nothing to give me more pleasure!' said the Earl,with heartfelt earnestness.  'I know what she is, and what her motherhas been to me.  That aunt of hers is a stiff, wrongheaded person, butshe has brought her up well--very well, and her mother has done therest.  As to her father, that is a disadvantage; but, from what I hear,he is never likely to come home; and that is not to be weighed againstwhat she is herself.  Poor Mary! how rejoiced she will be, that herdaughter at least should no longer be under that man's power!  It iswell you have not been extravagant, like some young men, Louis.  If youhad been running into debt, I should not have been able to gratify yourwishes now; but the property is so nearly disencumbered, that you canperfectly afford to marry her, with the very fair fortune she musthave, unless her father should gamble it away in Peru.'This was for Lord Ormersfield the incoherency of joy, and Louis wasquite carried along by his delight.  The breakfast-bell rang, and theEarl rising and drawing his son's arm within his own, pressed it,saying, 'Bless you, Louis!' It was extreme surprise and pleasure toFitzjocelyn, and yet the next moment he recollected that he stoodcommitted.How silent he was--how unusually gentle and gracious his father to thewhole party! quite affectionate to Mary, and not awful even to Clara.There was far too much meaning in it, and Louis feared Mrs. Ponsonbywas seeing through all.'A morning of Greek would be insupportable,' thought he; and yet hefelt as if the fetters of fate were being fast bound around him, whenhe heard his father inviting James to ride with him.He wandered and he watched, he spoke absently to Clara, but felt as ifrobbed of a protector, when she was summoned up-stairs to attend to herpacking, and Mary remained alone, writing one of her long letters toLima.'Now or never,' thought he, 'before my courage cools.  I never saw myfather in such spirits!'He sat down on an ottoman opposite to her, and turned over somenewspapers with a restless rustling.'Can I fetch anything for you?' asked Mary, looking up.'No, thank you.  You are a great deal too good to me, Mary.''I am glad,' said Mary, absently, anxious to go on with her letter;but, looking up again at him--'I am sure you want something.''No--nothing--but that you should be still more good to me.''What is the matter?' said Mary, suspecting that he was beginning torepent of his lazy fit, and wanted her to hear his confession.'I mean, Mary,' said he, rising, and speaking faster, 'if you--if youwould take charge of me altogether.  If you would have me, I would doall I could to make you happy, and it would be such joy to my father,and--'(rather like an after-thought)'to me.'Her clear, sensible eyes were raised, and her colour deepened, but theconfusion was on the gentleman's side--she was too much amazed to feelembarrassment, and there was a pause, till he added, 'I know betterthan to think myself worthy of you; but you will take me in hand--and,indeed, Mary, there is no one whom I like half so well.'Poor Louis! was this his romantic and poetical wooing!'Stop, if you please, Louis!' exclaimed Mary.  'This is so verystrange!'  And she seemed ready to laugh.'And--what do you say, Mary?''I do not know.  I cannot tell what I ought to say,' she returned,rising.  'Will you let me go to mamma?'She went; and Louis roamed about restlessly, till, on the stairs, heencountered Mrs. Frost, who instantly exclaimed, 'Why, my dear, what isthe matter with you?''I have been proposing to Mary,' said he, in a very low murmur, hiseyes downcast, but raised the next moment, to see the effect, as if ithad been a piece of mischief.'Well--proposing what?''Myself;' most innocently whispered.'You!--you!--Mary!--And--' Aunt Catharine was scarcely able to speak,in the extremity of her astonishment.  'You are not in earnest!''She is gone to her mother,' said Louis, hanging over the baluster, soas to look straight down into the hall; and both were silent, till Mrs.Frost exclaimed, 'My dear, dear child, it is an excellent choice!  Youmust be very happy with her!''Yes, I found my father was bent on it.''That was clear enough,' said his aunt, laughing, but resuming a toneof some perplexity.  'Yet it takes me by surprise: I had not guessedthat you were so much attracted.''I do like her better than any one.  No one is so thoroughly good, noone is likely to make me so good, nor my father so happy.'There was some misgiving in Mrs. Frost's tone, as she said, 'DearLouis, you are acting on the best of motives, but--''Don't, pray don't, Aunt Kitty,' cried Louis, rearing himself for aninstant to look her in the face, but again throwing half his body overthe rail, and speaking low.  'I could not meet any one half so good, orwhom I know as well.  I look up to her, and--yes--I do love herheartily--I would not have done it otherwise.  I don't care for beautyand trash, and my father has set his heart on it.''Yes, but--' she hesitated.  'My dear, I don't think it safe to marry,because one's father has set his heart on it.''Indeed,' said Louis, straightening himself, 'I do think I am givingmyself the best chance of being made rational and consistent.  I neverdid so well as when I was under her.''N--n--no--but--''And think how my father will unbend in a homelike home, where allshould be made up to him,' he continued, deep emotion swelling hisvoice.'My dear boy!  And you are sure of your own feeling?''Quite sure.  Why, I never saw any one,' said he, smiling--'I nevercared for any one half so much, except you, Aunt Kitty, no, I didn't.Won't that do?''I know I should not have liked your grandpapa--your uncle, I mean-tomake such comparisons.''Perhaps he had not got an Aunt Kitty,' said Louis.'No, no!  I can't have you so like a novel.  No, don't be anxious. Itcan't be for ever so long, and, of course, the more I am with her, thebetter I must like her.  It will be all right.''I don't think you know anything about it,' said Mrs. Frost, 'butthere, that's the last I shall say.  You'll forgive your old aunt.'He smiled, and playfully pressed her hand, adding, 'But we don't knowwhether she will have me.'Mary had meantime entered her mother's room, with a look that revealedthe whole to Mrs. Ponsonby, who had already been somewhat startled bythe demeanour of the father and son at breakfast.'Oh, mamma, what is to be done?''What do you wish, my child?' asked her mother, putting her arm roundher waist.'I don't know yet,' said Mary.  'It is so odd!'  And the disposition tolaugh returned for a moment.'You were not at all prepared.''Oh no!  He seems so young.  And,' she added, blushing, 'I cannot tell,but I should not have thought his ways were like the kind of thing.''Nor I, and the less since Clara has been here.''Oh,' said Mary, without a shade on her calm, sincere brow, 'he hasClara so much with him because he is her only friend.'The total absence of jealousy convinced Mrs. Ponsonby that the heartcould hardly have been deeply touched, but Mary continued, in aslightly trembling voice, 'I do not see why he should have done this,unless--''Unless that his father wished it.''Oh,' said Mary, somewhat disappointed, 'but how could Lord Ormersfieldpossibly--''He has an exceeding dread of Louis's making as great a mistake as hedid,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'and perhaps he thinks you the best security.''And you think Louis only meant to please him?''My dear, I am afraid it may be so.  Louis is very fond of him, andeasily led by a strong character.'She pressed her daughter closer, and felt rather than heard a littlesigh; but all that Mary said was, 'Then I had better not think aboutit.''Nay, my dear, tell me first what you think of his manner.''It was strange, and a little debonnaire, I think,' said Mary, smiling,but tears gathering in her eyes.  'He said I was too good for him.  Hesaid he would make me happy, and that he and his father would be veryhappy.'  A great tear fell.  'Something about not being worthy.'  Maryshed a few more tears, while her mother silently caressed her; and,recovering her composure, she firmly said, 'Yes, mamma, I see it is notthe real thing.  It will be kinder to him to tell him to put it out ofhis head.''And you, my dear?''Oh, mamma, you know you could not spare me.''If this were the real thing, dearest--''No,' whispered Mary, 'I could not leave you alone with papa.'Mrs. Ponsonby went on as if she had not heard: 'As it is, I own I amrelieved that you should not wish to accept him.  I cannot be sure itwould be for your happiness.''I do not think it would be right,' said Mary, as if that were herstrength.'He is a dear, noble fellow, and has the highest, purest principles andfeelings.  I can't but love him almost as if he were my own child: Inever saw so much sweetness and prettiness about any one, except hismother; and, oh! how far superior he is to her!  But then, he isboyish, he is weak--I am afraid he is changeable.''Not in his affections,' said Mary, reproachfully.'No, but in purposes.  An impulse leads him he does not know where, andnow, I think, he is acting on excellent motives, without knowing whathe is doing.  There's no security that he might not meet the personwho--''Oh, mamma!''He would strive against temptation, but we have no right to expose himto it.  To accept him now, it seems to me, would be taking too muchadvantage of his having been left so long to our mercy, and it mightbe, that he would become restless and discontented, find out that hehad not chosen for himself--regret--and have his tone of mind lowered--''Oh, stop, mamma, I would not let it be, on any account.''No, my dear, I could not part with you where we were not sure the'real thing' was felt for you.  If he had been strongly bent on it, hewould have conducted matters differently; but he knows no better.''You and I don't part,' said Mary.Neither spoke till she renewed her first question,'What is to be done?''Shall I go and speak to him, my dear?''Perhaps I had better, if you will come with me.'Then, hesitating--'I will go to my room for a moment, and then I shallbe able to do it more steadily.'Mrs. Ponsonby's thoughts were anxious during the five minutes of Mary'sabsence; but she returned composed, according to her promise, whatevermight be the throbbings beneath.  As Mrs. Ponsonby opened the door, shesaw Louis and his aunt together, and was almost amused at theirconscious start, the youthful speed with which the one darted into thefurther end of the corridor, and the undignified haste with which theother hopped down stairs.By the time they reached the drawing-room, he had recovered himself soas to come forward in a very suitable, simple manner, and Mary said, atonce, 'Louis, thank you; but we think it would be better not--''Not!' exclaimed Fitzjocelyn.'Not,' repeated Mary; 'I do not think there is that between us whichwould make it right.''There would be!' cried Louis, gaining ardour by the difficulty, 'ifyou would only try.  Mrs. Ponsonby, tell her we would make her happy.''You would try,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, kindly; 'but I think she is right.Indeed, Louis, you must forgive me for saying that you are hardly oldenough to make up your mind--''Madison is younger,' said Louis, boyishly enough to make her smile,but earnestly proceeding, 'Won't you try me?  Will you not say that ifI can be steady and persevering--''No,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'it would not be fair towards either of youto make any conditions.''But if without them, I should do better--Mary, will you say nothing?''We had better not think of it,' said Mary, her eyes on the ground.'Why? is it that I am too foolish, too unworthy?'She made a great effort.  'Not that, Louis.  Do not ask any more; it isbetter not; you have done as your father wished--now let us be as wewere before.''My father will be very much disappointed,' said Louis, with chagrin.'I will take care of your father,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, and as Mary tookthe moment for escaping, she proceeded to say some affectionate wordsof her own tender feeling towards Louis; to which he only replied bysaying, sadly, and with some mortification, 'Never mind; I know it isquite right.  I am not worthy of her.''That is not the point; but I do not think you understand your ownfeelings, or how far you were actuated by the wish to gratify yourfather.''I assure you,' cried Louis, 'you do not guess how I look up to Mary;her unfailing kindness, her entering into all my nonsense--her firm,sound judgment, that would keep me right--and all she did for me when Iwas laid up.  Oh! why cannot you believe how dear she is to me?''How dear is just what I do believe; but still this is not enough.''Just what Aunt Kitty says,' said Louis, perplexed, yet amused at hisown perplexity.'You will know better by-and-by,' she answered, smiling: 'in themeantime, believe that you are our very dear cousin, as ever.'  And sheshook hands with him, detecting in his answering smile a little relief,although a great deal of disappointment.Mary had taken refuge in her room, where a great shower of tears wouldhave their course, though she scolded herself all the time. 'Have done!have done!  It is best as it is.  He does not really wish it, and Icould not leave mamma.  We will never think of it again, and we will beas happy as we were before.'Her mother, meanwhile, was waiting below-stairs, thinking that sheshould spare Louis something, by taking the initiative in speaking tohis father; and she was sorry to see the alacrity with which the Earlcame up to her, with a congratulatory 'Well, Mary!'  She could hardlymake him comprehend the real state of the case; and then hisresignation was far more trying than that of the party chieflyconcerned.  Her praise of Fitzjocelyn had little power to comfort. 'Isee how it is,' he said, calmly: 'do not try to explain it away; Iacquiesce--I have no doubt you acted wisely for your daughter.''Nothing would have delighted me more, if he were but a few yearsolder.''You need not tell me the poor boy's failings,' said his father, sadly.'It is on account of no failing; but would it not be a great mistake torisk their happiness to fulfil our own scheme?''I hoped to secure their happiness.''Ay, but is there not something too capricious to find happinesswithout its own free will and choice?  Did you never hear of the heart?''Oh! if she be attached elsewhere'--and he seemed so much relieved,that Mrs. Ponsonby was sorry to be obliged to contradict him in haste,and explain that she did not believe Fitzjocelyn's heart to be yetdeveloped; whereupon he was again greatly vexed.  'So he has offeredhimself without attachment.  I beg your pardon, Mary; I am sorry yourdaughter should have been so treated.''Do not misunderstand me.  He is strangely youthful and simple, bent onpleasing you, and fancying his warm, brotherly feeling to be what youdesire.''It would be the safest foundation.''Yes, if he were ten years older, and had seen the world; but in thesethings he is like a child, and it would be dangerous to influence him.Do not take it to heart; you ought to be contented, for I saw nothingso plainly as that he loves nobody half so well as you.  Only bepatient with him.''You are the same Mary as ever,' he said, softened; and she left him,hoping that she had secured a favourable audience for his son, who soonappeared at the window, somewhat like a culprit.'I could not help it!' he said.'No; but you may set a noble aim before you--you may render yourselfworthy of her esteem and confidence, and in so doing you will fulfil myfondest hopes.''I asked her to try me, but they would make no conditions.  I am sorrythis could not be, since you wished it.''If you are not sorry on your own account, there are no regrets to bewasted on mine.''Candidly, father,' said Louis, 'much as I like her, I cannot be sorryto keep my youth and liberty a little longer.''Then you should never have entered on the subject at all,' said LordOrmersfield, beginning to write a letter; and poor Louis, in hispraiseworthy effort not to be reserved with him, found he had beenconfessing that he had not only been again making a fool of himself,but, what was less frequent and less pardonable, of his fatherlikewise.   He limped out at the window, and was presently found by hisgreat-aunt, reading what he called a raving novel, to see how he oughtto have done it.  She shook her head at him, and told him that he wasnot even decently concerned.'Indeed I am,' he replied.  'I wished my father to have had some peaceof mind about me, and it does not flatter one's vanity.'Dear, soft-hearted Aunt Kitty, with all her stores of comfort readyprepared, and unable to forgive, or even credit, the rejection of herLouis, without a prior attachment, gave a hint that this might be hisconsolation.  He caught eagerly at the idea.  'I had never once thoughtof that!  It can't be any Spaniard out in Peru--she has too much sense.What are you looking so funny about?  What! is it nearer home?  That'sit, then!  Famous!  It would be a capital arrangement, if that terribleold father is conformable.  What an escape I have had of him!  I amsure it is a most natural and proper preference--''Stop! stop, Louis, you are going too fast.  I know nothing.  Don't saya word to Jem, on any account: indeed, you must not.  It is all goingon very well now; but the least notion that he was observed, or that itwas his Uncle Oliver's particular wish, and there would be an end ofit.'She was just wise enough to keep back the wishes of the other vizier,but she had said enough to set Louis quite at his ease, and put him inthe highest spirits.  He seemed to have taken out a new lease ofboyishness, and, though constrained before Mary, laughed, talked, andplayed pranks, so as unconsciously to fret his father exceedingly.Clara's alert wits perceived that so many private interviews had somesignification; and Mrs. Frost found her talking it over with herbrother, and conjecturing so much, that granny thought it best tosupply the key, thinking, perhaps, that a little jealousy would do Jemno harm.  But the effect on him was to produce a fit of heartylaughter, as he remembered poor Lord Ormersfield's unaccountableurbanity and suppressed exultation in the morning's ride.  'I honourthe Ponsonbys,' he said, 'for not choosing to second his lordship'sendeavours to tyrannize over that poor fellow, body and soul.  PoorLouis! he is fabulously dutiful.'But Clara, recovering from her first stupor of wonder, began scoldinghim for presuming to laugh at anything so cruel to Louis.  It was notthe part of a friend!  And with tears of indignation and sympathystarting from her eyes, she was pathetically certain that, thoughgranny and Jem were so unfeeling as to laugh, his high spirits wereonly assumed to hide his suffering.  'Poor Louis! what had he not saidto her about Mary last night!  Now she knew what he meant!  And as toMary, she was glad she had never liked her, she had no patience withher: of course, she was far too prosy and stupid to care for anythinglike Louis, it was a great escape for him.  It would serve her right tomarry a horrid little crooked clerk in her father's office; and poordear, dear Louis must get over it, and have the most beautiful wife inthe world.  Don't you remember, Jem, the lady with the splendid darkeyes on the platform at Euston Square, when you so nearly made us missthe train, with the brow that you said--''Hush, Clara, don't talk nonsense.'CHAPTER XII.CHILDE ROLAND.A house there is, and that's enough,From whence one fatal morning issuesA brace of warriors, not in buff,But rustling in their silks and tissues.The heroines undertook the task;Thro' lanes unknown, o'er stiles they ventured,--Rapped at the door, nor stayed to ask,But bounce into the parlour entered.Gray's Long Story.'No carmine?  Nor scarlet lake in powder?''Could procure some, my Lord.''Thank you, the actinia would not live.  I must take what I can find. Alump of gamboge--''If you stay much longer, he will not retain his senses,' mutteredJames Frost, who was leaning backwards against the counter, where thebewildered bookseller of the little coast-town of Bickleypool wasbustling, in the vain endeavour to understand and fulfil the demands ofthat perplexing customer, Lord Fitzjocelyn.'Some drawing-paper.  This is hardly absorbent enough.  If you have anyblock sketch-books?--''Could procure some, my Lord.'James looked at his watch, while the man dived into his innermostrecesses.  'The tide!' he said.'Never mind, we shall only stick in the mud.''How could you expect to find anything here?  A half-crown paint-box istheir wildest dream.''Keep quiet, Jem, go and look out some of those library books, like awise man.''A wise man would be at a loss here,' said James, casting his eye alongthe battered purple backs of the circulating-library books.'Wisdom won't condescend!  Ah! thank you, this will do nicely. Thosecolours--yes; and the Seaside Book.  I'll choose one or two. What ismost popular here?'James began to whistle; but Louis, taking up a volume, became engrossedbeyond the power of hints, and hardly stepped aside to make way forsome ladies who entered the shop.  A peremptory touch of the arm atlength roused him, and holding up the book to the shopman, he put itinto his pocket, seized his ash-stick, put his arm into his cousin's,and hastened into the street.'Did you ever see--' began Jem.'Most striking.  I did not know you had met with her.  What anidea--the false self conjuring up phantoms--''What are you talking of?  Did you not see her?''Elizabeth Barrett.  Was she there?''Is that her name?  Do you know her?''I had heard of her, but never--''How?--where?  Who is she?''I only saw her name in the title-page.''What's all this?  You did not see her?''Who?  Did not some ladies come into the shop?''Some ladies!  Is it possible?  Why, I touched you to make you look.''I thought it was your frenzy about the tide.  What now?--'James made a gesture of despair.  'The loveliest creature I ever saw.You may see her yet, as she comes out.  Come back!''Don't be so absurd,' said Fitzjocelyn, laughing, and, with instinctivedislike of staring, resisting his cousin's effort to wheel him round.'What, you will?' withdrawing his arm.  'I shall put off without you,if you don't take care.'And, laughing, he watched Jem hurry up the sloping street and turn thecorner, then turned to pursue his own way, his steps much less lame andhis looks far more healthful than they had been a month before.  Hereached the quay--narrow, slippery, and fishy, but not without beauty,as the green water lapped against the hewn stones, and rocked thelittle boats moored in the wide bay, sheltered by a richly-woodedpromontory.  'Jem in a fit of romance!  Well, whose fault will it be ifwe miss the tide?  I'll sit in the boat, and read that poem again.--Oh! here he comes, out of breath.  Well, Jem, did the heroine dropglove or handkerchief?  Or, on a second view, was she minus an eye?''You were,' said James, hurrying breathlessly to unmoor the boat.'Let me row,' said Louis; 'your breath and senses are both lost in thefair vision.''It is of no use to talk to you--''I shall ask no questions till we are out of the harbour, or you willbe running foul of one of those colliers--a tribute with which the FairUnknown may dispense.'The numerous black colliers and lighters showed that precautions wereneedful till they had pushed out far enough to make the little fishytown look graceful and romantic; and the tide was ebbing so fast, thatLouis deemed it prudent to spend his strength on rowing rather than ontalking.James first broke silence by exclaiming--'Do you know where Beauchastelis?''On the other side of the promontory.  Don't you remember the spirerising among the trees, as we see it from the water?''That church must be worth seeing.  I declare I'll go there nextSunday.'Another silence, and Louis said--'I am curious to know whether you sawher.''She was getting into the carriage as I turned the corner; so I wentback and asked Bull who they were.''I hope she was the greengrocer's third cousin.''Pshaw!  I tell you it was Mrs. Mansell and her visitors.''Oho!  No wonder Beauchastel architecture is so grand.  What animpudent fellow you are, Jem!''The odd thing is,' said James, a little ashamed of Louis having putMansell and Beauchastel together, as he had not intended, 'that itseems they asked Bull who we were.  I thought one old lady was staringhard at you, as if she meant to claim acquaintance, but you shot out ofthe shop like a sky-rocket.''Luckily there's no danger of that.  No one will come to molest ushere.''Depend on it, they are meditating a descent on his lordship.''You shall appear in my name, then.''Too like a bad novel: besides, you don't look respectable enough formy tutor.  And, now I think of it, no doubt she was asking Bull how hecame to let such a disreputable old shooting-jacket into his shop.'The young men worked up an absurd romance between them, as merrily theycrossed the estuary, and rowed up a narrow creek, with a whitewashedvillage on one side, and on the other a solitary house, the gardensloping to the water, and very nautical--the vane, a union-jack wavedby a brilliant little sailor on the top of a mast, and the arbour, halfa boat set on end; whence, as James steered up to the stone steps thatwere one by one appearing, there emerged an old, grizzly,weather-beaten sailor, who took his pipe from his mouth, and caughthold of the boat.'Thank you, Captain!' cried Fitzjocelyn.  'I've brought home the boatsafe, you see, by my own superhuman exertions--no thanks to Mr. Frost,there!''That's his way, Captain,' retorted Jem, leaping out, and helping hiscousin: 'you may thank me for getting him home at all!  But for me, hewould have his back against the counter, and his head in a book, thisvery moment.''Ask him what he was after,' returned Louis.'Which of us d'ye think most likely to lag, Captain Hannaford?' criedJem, preventing the question.'Which would you choose to have on board?''Ye'd both of ye make more mischief than work,' said the old seaman,who had been looking from one to the other of the young men, as if theywere performing a comedy for his special diversion.'So you would not enter us on board the Eliza Priscilla?' cried Louis.'No, no,' said the old man, shrewdly, and with an air of holdingsomething back; whereupon they both pressed him, and obtained foranswer, 'No, no, I wouldn't sail with you'--signing towardsFitzjocelyn--'in my crew: ye'd be more trouble than ye're worth.  Andas to you, sir, if I wouldn't sail with ye, I'd like still less to sailunder you.'He finished with a droll, deprecating glance, and Louis laughedheartily; but James was silent, and as soon as they had entered thelittle parlour, declared that it would not do to encourage that oldskipper--he was waylaying them like the Ancient Mariner, and wasactually growing impudent.'An old man's opinion of two youngsters is not what I call impudence,'began Louis, with an emphasis that made Jem divert his attack.Those two cousins had never spent a happier month than in these smalllodgings, built by the old retired merchant-seaman evidently on themodel of that pride of his heart, the Eliza Priscilla, his littlecoasting trader, now the charge of his only surviving son; for this wasa family where drowning was like a natural death, and old CaptainHannaford looked on the probability of sleeping in Ebbscreekchurchyard, much as Bayard did at the prospect of dying in his bed. Hisold deaf wife kept the little cabin-like rooms most exquisitely neat;and the twelve-years-old Priscilla, the orphan of one of the lost sons,waited on the gentlemen with an old-fashioned, womanly deportment andstaid countenance that, in the absence of all other grounds ofdistress, Louis declared was quite a pain to him.The novelty of the place, the absence of restraint, the easy life, and,above all, the freshness of returning health, rendered his spiritsexceedingly high, and he had never been more light-hearted and full ofmirth.  James, elated at his rapid improvement, was scarcely less fullof liveliness and frolic, enjoying to the utmost the holiday, whichperhaps both secretly felt might be the farewell to the perfectcarelessness of boyish relaxation.  Bathing, boating, fishing,dabbling, were the order of the day, and withal just enough quarrellingand teasing to add a little spice to their pleasures. Louis was overhead and ears in maritime natural history; but Jem, backed by Mrs.Hannaford, prohibited his 'messes' from making a permanent settlementin the parlour; though festoons of seaweed trellised the porch,ammonites heaped the grass-plat, tubs of sea-water flanked the approachto the front door; and more than one bowl, with inmates of a suspiciousnature, was often deposited even on the parlour table.On the afternoon following the expedition to Bickleypool, Louis wasseated, with an earthenware pan before him, coaxing an actinia with rawbeef to expand her blossom, to be copied for Miss Faithfull. Anotherbowl stood near, containing some feathery serpulas; and the weeds wereheaped on the locker of the window behind him, and on the back of thechair which supported his lame foot.  The third and only remainingchair accommodated James, with a book placed on the table; and asemicircle swept round it, within which nothing marine might extend.Louis was by turns drawing, enticing his refractory sitter, exhortingher to bloom, and complimenting her delicate beauty, until James, witha groan, exclaimed, 'Is silence impossible to you, Fitzjocelyn? I wouldgo into the garden, but that I should be beset by the intolerable oldskipper!''I beg your pardon--I thought you never heard nor heeded me.''I don't in general, but this requires attention; and it is past allbearing to hear how you go on to that Jelly!''Read aloud, then: it will answer two purposes.'This is Divinity--Hooker,' said James, sighing wearily.'So much the better.  I read some once; I wish I had been obliged to goon.''You are the oddest fellow!--After all, I believe you have a cravingafter my profession.''Is that a discovery?' said Louis, washing the colour out of his brush.'The only person I envy is a country curate--except a town one.''Don't talk like affectation!' growled James.'Do you know, Jem,' said Louis, leaning back, and drawing the brushbetween his lips, 'I am persuaded that something will turn up toprevent it from being your profession.''Your persuasions are wrong, then!''That fabulous uncle in the Indies--''You know I am determined to accept nothing from my uncle, were he tolay it at my feet--which he never will.''Literally or metaphorically?' asked Louis, softly.'Pshaw!''You Dynevors don't resemble my sea-pink.  See how she stretches herelegant fringes for this very unpleasant bit of meat!  There!  I won'ttorment you any more; read, and stop my mouth!''You are in earnest?''You seem to think that if a man cannot be a clergyman, he is not to bea Christian.''Then don't break in with your actinias and stuff!''Certainly not,' said Louis, gravely.The first interruption came from James himself.  Leaping to his feetwith a sudden bound, he exclaimed, 'There they are!' and stoodtransfixed in a gaze of ecstasy.'You have made me smudge my lake,' said Louis, in the mild tone of'Diamond, Diamond!''I tell you, there they are!' cried James, rushing into wild activity.'One would think it the Fair Unknown,' said Louis, not troublinghimself to look round, nor desisting from washing out his smudge.'It is! it is!--it is all of them!  Here they come, I tell you, and theplace is a very merman's cave!''Take care--the serpula--don't!' as James hurriedly opened the doorleading to the stairs--disposed of the raw meat on one step and theserpulas on another, and hurled after them the heap of seaweed, all butone trailing festoon of 'Luckie Minnie's lines,' which, while his backwas turned, Louis by one dexterous motion wreathed round the crown ofhis straw hat; otherwise never stirring, but washing quietly on, untilhe rose as little Priscilla opened the door, and stood aside, mutelyoverawed at the stream of flounced ladies that flowed past, and seemedto fill up the entire room.  It was almost a surprise to find that,after all, there were only three of them!'I knew I was not mistaken,' said a very engaging, affectionate voice.'It is quite shocking to have to introduce myself to you--Lady Conway--''My aunt!' cried Louis, with eager delight--'and my cousin!' he added,turning with a slight blush towards the maiden, whom he felt, ratherthan saw, to be the worthy object of yesterday's rapture.'Not quite,' she answered, not avoiding the grasp of his hand, butreturning it with calm, distant politeness.'Not quite,' repeated Lady Conway.  'Your real cousins are no fartheroff than Beauchastel--''Where you must come and see them,' added the third lady--a portly,cordial, goodnatured dame, whom Lady Conway introduced as Mrs. Mansell,who had known his mother well; and Louis making a kind of presentationof his cousin James, the two elder ladies were located on two of thechairs: the younger one, as if trying to be out of the way, placedherself on the locker.  Jem stood leaning on the back of the otherchair; and Louis stood over his aunt, in an ecstasy at the meeting--atthe kind, warm manner and pleasant face of his aunt--and above all, atthe indescribable pleasure imparted by the mere presence of thebeautiful girl, though he hardly dared even to look at her; and she wasthe only person whose voice was silent in the chorus of congratulation,on the wonderful chance that had brought the aunt and nephew together.The one had been a fortnight at Beauchastel, the other a month atEbbscreek, without guessing at each other's neighbourhood, until LadyConway's attention had been attracted at the library by Louis'sremarkable resemblance to her sister, and making inquiries, she hadlearnt that he was no other than Lord Fitzjocelyn.  She was enchantedwith the likeness, declaring that all she wished was to see him lookless delicate, and adding her entreaties to those of Mrs. Mansell, thatthe two young men would come at once to Beauchastel.Louis looked with wistful doubt at James, who, he knew, could not brookgoing to fine places in the character of tutor; but, to his surpriseand pleasure, James was willing and eager, and made no demur, exceptthat Fitzjocelyn could not walk so far, and the boat was gone out.Mrs. Mansell then proposed the ensuing Monday, when, she said, she andMr. Mansell should be delighted to have them to meet a party ofshooting gentlemen--of course they were sportsmen. Louis answered atonce for James; but for himself, he could not walk, nor even ride theoffered shooting-pony; and thereupon ensued more minute questionswhether his ankle were still painful.'Not more than so as to be a useful barometer.  I have been testing itby the sea-weeds.  If I am good for nothing else, I shall be a walkingweather-glass, as well as a standing warning against man-traps.''You don't mean that you fell into a man-trap!' exclaimed Mrs. Mansell,in horror.  'That will be a warning for Mr. Mansell!  I have such adread of the frightful things!''A trap ingeniously set by myself,' said Louis.  'I was only too gladno poor poacher fell into it.''Your father told me that it was a fall down a steep bank,' exclaimedLady Conway.'Exactly so; but I suppose he thought it for my credit to conceal thatmy trap consisted of a flight of stone stops, very solid and permanent,with the trifling exception of cement.''If the truth were known,' said James, 'I believe that a certain scampof a boy was at the bottom of those steps.''I'm the last person to deny it,' said Louis, quietly, though notwithout rising colour, 'there was a scamp of a boy at the bottom of thesteps, and very unpleasant he found it--though not without the bestconsequences, and among them the present--' And he turned to LadyConway with a pretty mixture of gracefulness and affection, enough towin the heart of any aunt.Mrs. Mansell presently fell into raptures at the sight of the drawingmaterials, which must, she was sure, delight Isabel, but she was ratherdiscomfited by the sight of the 'subject,'--called it an odiouscreature, then good-humouredly laughed at herself, but would not sitdown again, evidently wishing to escape from close quarters with suchmonsters.  Lady Conway likewise rose, and looked into the basin,exclaiming, in her turn, 'Ah!  I see you understand these things!  Yes,they are very interesting!  Virginia will be delighted; she has beenbegging me for an aquarium wherever we go.  You must tell her how tomanage it.  Look, Isabel, would not she be in ecstasies?'Miss Conway looked, but did not seem to partake in the admiration. 'Iam perverse enough never to like what is the fashion,' she said.'I tried to disgust Fitzjocelyn with his pets on that very ground,'said James; 'but their charms were too strong for him.''Fashion is the very testimony to them,' said Louis.  'I think I couldconvince you.'He would perhaps have produced his lovely serpula blossoms, but he wasforced to pass on to his aunt and Mrs. Mansell, who had found somethingsafer for their admiration, in the shape of a great Cornu ammonis inthe garden.'He can throw himself into any pursuit,' said James, as he paused atthe door with Miss Conway; but suddenly becoming aware of the slimyentanglement round his hat, he exclaimed, 'Absurd fellow!' and pulledit off rather petulantly, adding, with a little constraint, 'Recoverydoes put people into mad spirits!  I fancy the honest folks here lookon in amaze.'Miss Conway gave a very pretty smile of sympathy and consolation, thatshone like a sunbeam on her beautiful pensive features and dark, softeyes.  Then she began to admire the view, as they stood on the turf,beside Captain Hannaford's two small cannon, overlooking the watertowards Bickleypool, with a purple hill rising behind it.  A yacht wassailing into the harbour, and James ran indoors to fetch a spy-glass,while Lady Conway seized the occasion of asking her nephew his tutor'sname.Louis, who had fancied she must necessarily understand all his kindred,was glad to guard against shocks to Jem's sensitive pride, and eagerlyexplained the disproportion between his birth and fortune, and hisgallant efforts to relieve his grandmother from her burthens.  He waspleased to find that he had touched all his auditors, and to hearkind-hearted Mrs. Mansell repeat her special invitation to Mr. FrostDynevor with double cordiality.'If you must play practical jokes,' said James, as they watched thecarriage drive off, 'I wish you would choose better moments for them.''I thought you would be more in character as a merman brave,' saidLouis.'I wonder what character you thought you appeared in?''I never meant you to discover it while they were here, nor would you,if you were not so careful of your complexion.  Come, throw it at myhead now, as you would have done naturally, and we shall have fairweather again!''I am only concerned at the impression you have made.''Too late now, is it?  You don't mean to be bad company for the rest ofthe day.  It is too bad, after such a presence as has been here. She isa poem in herself.  It is like a vision to see her move in that calm,gliding way.  Such eyes, so deep, so tranquil, revealing the sphereapart where she dwells!  An ideal!  How can you be savage after sittingin the same room, and hearing that sweet, low voice?'Meantime the young lady sat back in the carriage, dreamily hearing, andsometimes answering, the conversation of her two elders, as theyreturned through pretty forest-drives into the park of Beauchastel, andup to the handsome, well-kept house; where, after a few words from Mrs.Mansell, she ascended the stairs.'Isabel!' cried a bright voice, and a girl of fourteen came skatingalong the polished oak corridor.  'Come and have some tea in theschool-room, and tell us your adventures!'  And so saying, she draggedthe dignified Isabel into an old-fashioned sitting-room, where a littlepale child, two years younger, sprang up, and, with a cry of joy, clunground the elder sister.'My white bind-weed,' said Isabel, fondly caressing her, 'have you beenout on the pony?''Oh I yes, we wanted only you.  Sit down there.'And as Isabel obeyed, the little Louisa placed herself on her lap, withone arm round her neck, and looked with proud glee at the kind,sensible-faced governess who was pouring out the tea.'The reconnoitring party!' eagerly cried Virginia.'Did you find the cousin?''Yes, we did.''Oh!  Then what is he like?''You will see when he comes on Monday.''Coming--oh!  And is he so very handsome?''I can see how pretty a woman your Aunt Louisa must have been.''News!' laughed Virginia; 'when mamma is always preaching to me to belike her!''Is he goodnatured?' asked Louisa.'I had not full means of judging,' said Isabel, more thoughtfully thanseemed justified by the childish question.  'His cousin is coming too,'she added; 'Mr. Frost Dynevor.''Another cousin!' exclaimed Virginia.'No; a relation of Lord Ormersfield--a person to be much respected. Heis heir to a lost estate, and of a very grand old family.  LordFitzjocelyn says that he is exerting himself to the very utmost for hisgrandmother and orphan sister; denying himself everything.  He is to bea clergyman.  There was a book of divinity open on the table.''He must be very good!' said Louisa, in a low, impressed voice, andfondling her sister's hand.  'Will he be as good as Sir Roland?''Oh! I am glad he is coming!' cried Virginia.  'We have so wished tosee somebody very good!'A bell rang--a signal that Lady Conway would be in her room, where sheliked her two girls to come to her while she was dressing. Louisareluctantly detached herself from her sister, and Virginia lingered tosay, 'Dress quickly, please, please, Isabel.  I know there is a new bitof Sir Roland done!  Oh! I hope Mr. Dynevor is like him!''Not quite,' said Isabel, smiling as they ran away.  'Poor children, Iam afraid they will be disappointed; but long may their craving be tosee 'somebody very good!''I am very glad they should meet any one answering the description,'said the governess.  'I don't gather that you are much delighted withthe object of the expedition.''A pretty boy--very pretty.  It quite explains all I have ever heard ofhis mother.''As you told the children.''More than I told the children.  Their aunt never by description seemedto me my ideal, as you know.  I would rather have seen a likeness toLord Ormersfield, who--though I don't like him--has something strikingin the curt, dry, melancholy dignity of his manner.''And how has Lord Fitzjocelyn displeased you?''Perhaps there is no harm in him--he may not have character enough forthat; but talk, attitudes, everything betrays that he is used to beworshipped--takes it as a matter of course, and believes nothing sointeresting as himself.''Don't you think you may have gone with your mind made up?''If you mean that I thought myself uncalled for, and heartily detestedthe expedition, you are right; but I saw what I did not expect.''Was it very bad?''A very idle practical joke, such as I dislike particularly.  Aquantity of wet sea-weed wound round Mr. Dynevor's hat.'Miss King laughed.  'Really, my dear, I don't think you know what youngmen like from each other.''Mr. Dynevor did not like it,' said Isabel, 'though he tried to pass itoff lightly as the spirits of recovery.  Those spirits--I am afraid hehas too much to suffer from them.   There is something so ungenerous inpractical wit, especially from a prosperous man to one unprosperous!''Well, Isabel, I won't contradict, but I should imagine that suchthings often showed people to be on the best of terms.'Isabel shook her head, and left the room, to have her dark hairbraided, with little heed from herself, as she sat dreamily over abook.  Before the last bracelet was clasped, she was claimed by her twolittle sisters, who gave her no peace till her desk was opened, and amanuscript drawn forth, that they might hear the two new pages of hermorning's work.  It was a Fouque-like tale, relieving and givingexpression to the yearnings for holiness and loftiness that had grownup within Isabel Conway in the cramped round of her existence.  Thestory went back to the troubadour days of Provence, where a knight, theheir of a line of shattered fortunes, was betrothed to the heiress ofthe oppressors, that thus all wrongs might be redressed.  They hadlearnt to love, when Sir Roland discovered that the lands in disputehad been won by sacrilege.  He met Adeline at a chapel in a littlevalley, to tell the whole.  They agreed to sacrifice themselves, thatrestitution should be made; the knight to go as a crusader to the HolyLand; the lady, after waiting awhile to tend her aged father, to entera convent, and restore her dower to the church.  Twice had Isabelwritten that parting, pouring out her heart in the high-souled tenderdevotion of Roland and his Adeline; and both feeling and descriptionwere beautiful and poetical, though unequal.  Louisa used to crywhenever she heard it, yet only wished to hear it again and again, andwhen Virginia insisted on reading it to Miss King, tears had actuallybeen surprised in the governess's eyes.  Yet she liked still betterAdeline's meek and patient temper, where breathed the feeling Isabelherself would fain cherish--the deep, earnest, spiritual life and highconsecrated purpose that were with the Provencal maiden through all herenforced round of gay festivals, light minstrelsy, tourneys, and Courtsof Love.  Thus far had the story gone.  Isabel had been writing a wild,mysterious ballad, reverting to that higher love and the true spirit ofself-sacrifice, which was to thrill strangely on the ears of thethoughtless at a contention for the Golden Violet, and which she hadadapted to a favourite air, to the extreme delight of the two girls.To them the Chapel in the valley, Roland and his Adeline, were verynearly real, and were the hidden joy of their hearts,--all the morebecause their existence was a precious secret between the three sistersand Miss King, who viewed it as such an influence on the young ones,that, with more meaning than she could have explained, she called ittheir Telemaque.  The following-up of the teaching of Isabel and MissKing might lead to results as little suspected by Lady Conway asFenelon's philosophy was by Louis XIV.Lady Conway was several years older than her beautiful sister, and hadmarried much later.  Perhaps she had aimed too high, and had met withdisappointments unavowed; for she had finally contented herself withbecoming the second wife of Sir Walter Conway, and was now his serene,goodnatured, prosperous widow.  Disliking his estate and neighbourhood,and thinking the daughters wanted London society and London masters,she shut up the house until her son should be of age, and spent theseason in Lowndes-square, the autumn either abroad, in visits, or atwatering-places.Beauchastel was an annual resort of the family.  Isabel was moreslenderly portioned than her half-sisters; and she was one of thenearest surviving relations of her mother's cousin, Mr. Mansell, whoselarge comfortable house was always hospitable; and whose wife, a greatdealer in goodnatured confidential gossip, used to throw out hints toher great friend Lady Conway, that much depended on Isabel'smarriage--that Mr. Mansell had been annoyed at connexions formed byothers of his relations--but though he had decided on nothing, the deargirl's choice might make a great difference.Nothing could be more passive than Miss Conway.  She could not rememberher mother, but her childhood had been passed under an admirablegoverness; and though her own Miss Longman had left her, Miss King, thesuccessor, was a person worthy of her chief confidence.  Attwo-and-twenty, the school-room was still the home of her affections,and her ardent love was lavished on her little sisters and her brotherWalter.Going out with Lady Conway was mere matter of duty and submission. Shehad not such high animal spirits as to find enjoyment in her gaieties,and her grave, pensive character only attained to walking through herpart; she had seen little but the more frivolous samples of society,scorned and disliked all that was worldly and manoeuvring, and hungback from levity and coquetry with utter distaste.  Removed from hernatural home, where she would have found duties and seen variousaspects of life, she had little to interest or occupy her in herunsettled wanderings; and to her the sap of life was in books, indreams, in the love of her brother and sisters, and in discussions withMiss King; her favourite vision for the future, the going to live withWalter at Thornton Conway when he should be of age.  But Walter wasyounger than Louisa, and it was a very distant prospect.Her characteristic was a calm, serene indifference, in which herstepmother acquiesced, as lovers of peace do in what they cannot help;and the more willingly, that her tranquil dignity and pensive graceexactly suited the style of her tall queenly figure, delicate features,dark soft languid eyes, and clear olive complexion, just tinged withrosebud pink.What Louis said of her to his tutor on the Monday night of theirarrival was beyond the bounds of all reason; and it was even morememorable that Jem was neither satirical nor disputatious, assented toall, and if he sighed, it was after his door was shut.A felicitous day ensued, spent by James in shooting, by Fitzjocelyn, inthe drawing-room; whither Mrs. Mansell had requested Isabel's presence,as a favour to herself.  The young lady sat at work, seldom raising hereyes, but this was enough for him; his intense admiration and pleasurein her presence so exhilarated him, that he rattled away to the utmost.Louisa was at first the excuse.  In no further doubt of hisgood-nature, she spent an hour in the morning in giving him anagrams toguess; and after she had repaired to the schoolroom, he went oninventing fresh ones, and transposing the ivory letters, rambling on inhis usual style of pensive drollery.  Happiness never set him off toadvantage, and either there was more froth than ordinary, or itappeared unusually ridiculous to an audience who did not detect theunder-current of reflection.  His father would have been in despair,Mrs. Ponsonby or Mary would have interposed; but the ladies ofBeauchastel laughed and encouraged him,--all but Isabel, who sat in thewindow, and thought of Adeline, 'spighted and angered both,' by aNavarrese coxcomb, with sleeves down to his heels, and shoes turned upto his knees.  She gave herself great credit for having already createdhim a Viscount.In the afternoon, Louis drove out lionizing with his aunt; but thoughthe ponies stopped of themselves at all the notable views; sea, hill,and river were lost on him.  Lady Conway could have drawn out a farless accessible person, and her outpouring of his own sentiments madehim regard her as perfect.She consulted him about her winter's resort.  Louisa required peculiarcare, and she had thought of trying mineral baths--what was thought ofNorthwold? what kind of houses were there?  The Northwold facultythemselves might have taken a lesson from Fitzjocelyn's eloquentanalysis of the chemical properties of the waters, and all old Mr.Frost's spirit would seem to have descended on him when he dilated onthe House Beautiful.  Lodgers for Miss Faithfull! what jubilee theywould cause!  And such lodgers!  No wonder he was in ecstasy.  All theevening the sound of his low, deliberate voice was unceasing, and hiscalm announcements to his two little cousins were each one morestartling than the last; while James, to whom it was likewise allsunshine, was full of vivacity, and a shrewd piquancy of manner thatgave zest to all he said, and wonderfully enlivened the often ratherdull circle at Beauchastel.Morning came; and when the ladies descended to breakfast, it was foundthat Lord Fitzjocelyn had gone out with the sportsmen.  The childrenlamented, and their elders pronounced a young gentleman's passion forshooting to be quite incalculable.  When, late in the day, the partyreturned, it was reported that he did not appear to care much for thesport; but had walked beside Mr. Mansell's shooting-pony, and hadfinally gone with him to see his model farm. This was a sure road tothe old squire's heart, and no one was more delighted with the guest.For Aunt Catharine's sake, Louis was always attracted by old age, andhis attentive manners had won Mr. Mansell's heart, even before hisinquiries about his hobby had completed the charm.  To expound and tolisten to histories of agricultural experiments that really answered,was highly satisfactory to both, and all the evening they were eagerover the great account-book which was the pride of the squire's heart;while Virginia and Louisa grumbled or looked imploring, and Isabelmarvelled at there being any interest for any one in old Mr. Mansell'sconversation.'What is the meaning of this?' asked James, as they went up stairs.Louis shrugged like a Frenchman, looked debonnaire, and said'Good-night.'Again he came down; prepared for shooting, though both pale and lame;but he quietly put aside all expostulations, walking on until, aboutfifty yards from the house, a pebble, turning under the injured foot,caused such severe pain that he could but just stagger to a tree andsit down.There was much battling before Mr. Mansell would consent to leave him,or he to allow James to help him back to the house, before going on toovertake the party.Very irate was Jem, at folly that seemed to have undone the benefits ofthe last month, and at changeableness that was a desertion of the queento whom all homage was due.  He was astonished that Louis turned intothe study, a room little inhabited in general, and said, 'Makehaste--you will catch the others; don't fall in with the ladies.''I mean to send your aunt to you.''Pray don't.  Can't you suppose that peace is grateful after havingcounted every mortal hour last night?''Was that the reason you were going to walk ten miles without a leg tostand upon?  Fitzjocelyn! is this systematic?''What is?' said Louis, wearily.'Your treatment of--your aunt.''On what system should aunts be treated?''Of all moments to choose for caprice!  Exactly when I thought even youwere fixed!''Pur troppo,' sighed Louis.'Ha!' cried Jem, 'you have not gone and precipitated matters!  Ithought you could never amaze me again; but even you might have feltshe was a being to merit rather more time and respect!''Even I am not devoid of the organ of veneration.'His meek tone was a further provocation; and with uplifted chin, hairruffled like the crest of a Shetland pony, flashing eyes, and distinctenunciation, James exclaimed, 'You will excuse me for not understandingyou.  You come here; you devote yourself to your aunt and cousins--youseem strongly attracted; then, all on a sudden, you rush outshooting--an exercise for which you don't care, and when you can'twalk: you show the most pointed neglect.  And after being done-upyesterday, you repeat the experiment to-day, as if for the mere objectof laming yourself for life.  I could understand pique or temper, butyou have not the--''The sense,' said Louis; 'no, nor anything to be piqued at.''If there be a motive,' said James, 'I have a right to demand not to betrifled with any longer.''I wish you could be content to shoot your birds, and leave me inpeace: you will only have your fun spoilt, like mine, and go into afury.  The fact is, that my father writes in a state of perturbation.He says, I might have understood, from the tenor of his conduct, thathe did not wish me to be intimate with my aunt's family!  He cannotknow anything about them, for it is all one warning against fashion andfrivolity.  He does not blame us--especially not you.''I wish he did.''But he desires that our intercourse should be no more than proprietydemands, and plunges into a discourse against first impressions,beauty, and the like.''So that's the counterblast!''You ought to help me, Jem,' said Louis, dejectedly.'I'll help you with all my heart to combat your father's prejudices.''An hour's unrestrained intercourse with these people would bestdestroy them,' said Louis; 'but, in the mean time--I wonder what hemeans.''He means that he is in terror for his darling scheme.''Mrs. Ponsonby was very right,' sighed Louis.'Ay!  A pretty condition you would be in, if she had not had too muchprinciple to let you be a victim to submission.  That's what you'llcome to, though!  You will never know the meaning of passion; you willescape something by it, though you will be twisted round his lordship'sfinger, and marry his choice.  I hope she will have red hair!''Negative and positive obedience stand on different grounds,' saidLouis, with such calmness as often fretted James, but saved theirfriendship.  'Besides, till I had this letter, I had no notion of anysuch thing.'James's indignation resulted in fierce stammering; while Louisdeliberately continued a viva voce self-examination, with his ownquaint naivete, betraying emotion only by the burning colour of cheekand brow.'No; I had no such notion.  I only felt that her presence had thegladdening, inspiriting, calming effect of moonlight or starlight. Ireverenced her as a dream of poetry walking the earth.  Ha! now onehears the sound of it--that is like it!  I did not think it was such aconfirmed case.  I should have gone on in peace but for this letter,and never thought about it at all.''So much the better for you!''My father is too just and candid not to own his error, and bethankful.''And you expect her to bear with your alternations in the mean time?''Towards her I have not alternated.  When I have made giggle with Claraunder the influence of the starry sky, did you suppose me giggling withLyra or the Pleiades!  I should dread to see the statue descend; itseemed irreverence even to gaze.  The lofty serenity keeps me aloof.  Ilike to believe in a creature too bright and good for human nature'sdaily food.  Our profane squinting through telescopes at the Lady Moonreveals nothing but worn-out volcanoes and dry oceans, black gulfs andscorched desolation; but verily that may not be Lady Moon's fault--onlythat of our base inventions.  So I would be content to markher--Isabel, I mean--queenly, moonlike name!--walk in beauty andtranquillity unruffled, without distorting my vision by personal aimsat bringing her down to my level.  There--don't laugh at me, Jem.''No, I am too sorry for you.''Why!' he exclaimed, impatient of compassion; 'do you think itdesperate?''I see your affection given to a most worthy object, and I know whatyour notions of submission will end in.''Once for all, Jem,' said Fitzjocelyn, 'do you know how you are usingmy father?  No; Isabel Conway may be the happiness or thedisappointment of my life--I cannot tell.  I am sure my father ismistaken, and I believe he may be convinced; but I am bound not to flyin the face of his direct commands, and, till we can come to anunderstanding, I must do the best I can, and trust to--'The last word was lost, as he turned to nurse his ankle, and presentlyto entreat James to join the sportsmen; but Jem was in a mood to donothing pleasing to himself nor to any one else.  A sacrifice isusually irritating to the spectators, who remonstrate rather thanlisten to self-reproach; and Louis had been guilty of three greatoffences--being in the right, making himself ridiculous, and submittingtamely--besides the high-treason to Isabel's beauty. It was well thatthe Earl was safe out of the way of the son of the Pendragons!Fitzjocelyn was in pain and discomfort enough to make James unwillingto leave him; though his good-will did not prevent him from keeping upsuch a stream of earplugs and sinister auguries, that it was almost theclimax of good-temper that enabled Louis to lie still, trying to read agreat quarto Park's Travels, and abstaining from any reply that couldaggravate matters.  As the one would not go to luncheon, the otherwould not; and after watching the sound of the ladies' setting out fortheir drive, Louis said that he would go and lie on the turf; but atthat moment the door was thrown open, and in ran Virginia.Explanations were quickly exchanged--how she had come to find Vertot'sMalta for Isabel, and how he had been sent in by hurting his foot.'Were you going to stay in all day?' said Virginia.  'Oh, come with us!We have the pony-carriage; and we are going to a dear old ruin, walkingand driving by turns.  Do, pray, come; there's plenty of room.'There could be no objection to the school-room party, and it was nosmall relief to escape from James and hope he was amused; soFitzjocelyn allowed himself to be dragged off in triumph, and James wasacceding to his entreaty that he would go in search of theshooting-party, when, as they reached the hall-door, they beheld MissConway waiting on the steps.There was no receding for her any more than for Louis, so she couldonly make a private resolution against the pony-carriage, and dedicateherself to the unexceptionable company of little sister, governess andtutor; for James had resigned the shooting, and attached himself to theexpedition.  It was an excellent opportunity of smoothing his cousin'sway, and showing that all was not caprice that might so appear: so hebegan to tell of his most advantageous traits of character, and toexplain away his whimsical conduct, with great ardour and ingenuity.He thought he should be perfectly satisfied if he could win but onesmile of approbation from that gravely beautiful mouth; and it came atlast, when he told of Fitzjocelyn's devoted affection to Mrs. Frost andhis unceasing kindness to the old ladies of Dynevor Terrace.  Thusgratified, he let himself be led into abstract questions ofprinciple,--a style of discussion frequent between Miss King andIsabel, but on which the latter had never seen the light of a man'smind thrown except through books.  The gentlemen whom she had met wereseldom either deep or earnest, except those too much beyond her reach;and she had avoided anything like confidence or intimacy: but Mr.Dynevor could enlighten and vivify her perplexed reflections, answerher inquiries, confirm her opinion of books, and enter into all thatshe ventured with diffidence to express.  He was enchanted to find thatno closer approach could dim the lustre of Louis's moon, and honouredher doubly for what she had made herself in frivolous society.  He feltsure that his testimony would gain credit where Fitzjocelyn's would beregarded as love-blinded, and already beheld himself forcing full proofof her merits on the reluctant Earl, beholding Louis happy, and Isabelemancipated from constraint.A five miles' walk gave full time for such blissful discoveries; forMiss Conway was resolute against entering the pony-carriage, and walkedon, protesting against ever being fatigued; while Louis was obliged tooccupy his seat in the carriage, with a constant change of companions.'I think, my dear,' said Miss King, when the younger girls had gone totheir mother's toilette, 'that you will have to forgive me.''Meaning,' said Isabel, 'that you are bitten too!  Ah! Miss King, youcould not withstand the smile with which he handed you in!''Could you withstand such an affectionate account of your cruel,tyrannical practical joker?''Facts are stubborn things.  Do you know what Mr. Dynevor is doing atthis moment?  I met him in the gallery, hurrying off to Ebbscreek forsome lotion for Lord Fitzjocelyn's ankle.  I begged him to let Mrs.Mansell send; but no-no one but himself could find it, and his cousincould not bear strangers to disarrange his room.  If anything werewanting, it would be enough to see how simply and earnestly such a manhas been brought to pamper--nay, to justify, almost to adore, the whimsand follies of this youth.''If anything were wanting to what?  To your dislike.''It would not be so active as dislike, unless--' Isabel spoke withdrooping head, and Miss King did not ask her to finish, but said, 'Hehas not given you much cause for alarm.''So; he is at least a thorough gentleman.  It may be conceit, or wrongself-consciousness, but from the moment the poor boy was spied in theshop, I had a perception that mamma and Mrs. Mansell marked him down.Personally he would be innocent, but, through all his chatter, I cannotshake off the fancy that I am watched, or that decided indifference isnot needed to keep him at a distance.''I wish you could have seen him without knowing him!''In vain, dear Miss King!  I can't bear handsome men.  I see hisfrivolity and shallowness; and for amiability, what do you think ofkeeping his cousin all the morning from shooting for such a merenothing, and then sending him off for a ten miles' walk?'For my part, I confess that I was struck with the good sense andkindness he showed in our tete-a-tete--I thought it justified Mr.Dynevor's description.''Yes, I have no doubt that there is some good in him.  He might havedone very well, if he had not always been an idol.'Isabel was the more provoked with Lord Fitzjocelyn, when, by-and-by, heappeared in the drawing-room, and related the result of his cousin'smission.  Jem, who would know better than himself where to find hisproperty, had not chosen to believe his description of the spot wherehe had left the lotion, and, in the twilight, Louis had found his footcoiled about by the feelers and claws of a formidable monster--no otherthan a bottled scorpion, a recent present from Captain Hannaford.  Hedid not say how emblematic the scorpion lotion was of that which Jemhad been administering to his wounded spirit all the morning, but heput the story in so ludicrous a light that Isabel decided that Mr.Dynevor was ungenerously and ungratefully treated as a butt; and sheturned away in displeasure from the group whom the recital was amusing,to offer her sympathy to the tutor, and renew the morning'sconversation.CHAPTER XIII.FROSTY, BUT KINDLY.Go not eastward, go not westward,For a stranger whom we know not.Like a fire upon the hearthstone,Is a neighbour's homely daughter;Like the moonlight or the starlight,Is the handsomest of strangers.Legend of Hiawatha.'What a laboured production had the letter been!  How many copies hadthe statesman written! how late had he sat over it at night! how muchmore consideration had he spent on it than on papers involving thesuccess of his life!  A word too much or too little might precipitatethe catastrophe, and the bare notion of his son's marriage with a pupilof Lady Conway renewed and gave fresh poignancy to the past.At first his anxieties were past mention; but he grew restless underthem, and the instinct of going to Mrs. Ponsonby prevailed.  At least,she would know what had transpired from James, or from Fitzjocelyn toMrs. Frost.She had heard of ecstatic letters from both the cousins, and Mary hadbeen delighted to identify Miss Conway with the Isabel of whom one ofher school friends spoke rapturously, but the last letter had beenfromJames to his grandmother, declaring that Lord Ormersfield wasdestroying the happiness of the most dutiful of sons, who was obedienteven to tameness, and so absurd that there was no bearing him.  Hislordship must hear reason, and learn that he was rejecting the mostadmirable creature in existence, her superiority of mind exceeding evenher loveliness of person.  He had better beware of tyranny; it waspossible to abuse submission, and who could answer for the consequencesof thwarting strong affections?  All the ground Fitzjocelyn had gainedin the last six weeks had been lost; and for the future, James wouldnot predict.'An uncomfortable matter,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, chiefly for the sake ofreading her daughter's feelings.  'If it were not in poor Louis's mindalready, his father and James would plant it there by their contraryefforts.''Oh! I hope it will come right,' said Mary.  'Louis is too good, andhis father too kind, for it not to end well.  And then, mamma, he willbe able to prove, what nobody will believe--that he is constant.''You think so, do you?' said her mother, smiling.Mary blushed, but answered, 'where he really cared, he would beconstant.  His fancy might be taken, and he might rave, but he wouldnever really like what was not good.--If he does think about MissConway, we may trust she is worthy of him.  Oh! I should like to seeher!'Mary's eyes lighted up with an enthusiasm that used to be a stranger tothem.  It was not the over-acted indifference nor the tender generosityof disappointment: it seemed more to partake of the fond, unselfish,elder-sisterly affection that she had always shown towards Louis, andit set her mother quite at ease.Seeing Lord Ormersfield riding into the terrace, Mary set out for awalk, that he might have his tete-a-tete freely with her mother.  Oncoming home, she met him on the stairs; and he spoke with a sadsoftness and tone of pardon that alarmed her so much, that she hastenedto ask her mother whether Louis had really avowed an attachment.'Oh no,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'he has written a very right-mindedletter, on the whole, poor boy! though he is sure the Conways have onlyto be known to be appreciated.  Rather too true!  It is in his MissFanny hand, stiff and dispirited; and his father has worked himselfinto such a state of uneasiness, that I think it will end in his goingto Ebbscreek at once.''O mamma, you won't let him go and torment Louis?''Why, Mary, have you been learning of James?  Perhaps he would tormenthim more from a distance; and besides, I doubt what sort of counsellorJames is likely to make in his present mood.''I never could see that James made any difference to Louis,' said Mary.'I know people think he does, because Louis gives up wishes and plansto him; but he is not led in opinions or principles, as far as I cansee.''Not unless his own wishes went the same way.''At least, Lord Ormersfield will see Miss Conway!''I am afraid that will do no good.  It will not be for the first time.Lady Conway has been his dread from the time of his own marriage; andif she should come to Northwold, he will be in despair. I do think hemust be right; she must be making a dead set at Louis.''Not Miss Conway,' said Mary.  'I know she must be good, or he wouldnot endure her for a moment.''Mary, you do not know the power of beauty.''I have heard of it,' said Mary; 'I have seen how Dona Guadalupe wasfollowed.  But those people were not like Louis.  No, mamma; I thinkJames might be taken in, I don't think Louis could be--unless he had avery grand dream of his own before his eyes; and then it would be hisown dream, not the lady that he saw; and by-and-by he would find itout, and be so vexed!''And, I trust, before he had committed himself!''Mamma, I won't have you think Miss Conway anything but up to hisdreams!  I know she is.  Only think what Jane Drummond says of her!'When the idea of going to see how matters stood had once occurred tothe Earl, he could not stay at home: the ankle and the affectionspreyed on him by turns, and he wrote to Sir Miles Oakstead to fix anearlier day for the promised visit, as well as to his son, to announcehis speedy arrival.  Then he forgot the tardiness of cross-countryposts, and outran his letter, so that he found no one to meet him atBickleypool; and on driving up to the gate at Ebbscreek, found alllooking deserted.  After much knocking, Priscilla appeared, round-eyedand gasping, and verified his worst fears with 'Gone to Bochattle.'However, she explained that only one gentleman was gone to dine there;the other was rowing him round the point, with grandfather;--they wouldsoon be back--indeed they ought, for the tide was so low, they wouldhave to land down by the shingle bar.She pointed out where the boat must come in; and thither the Earldirected his steps, feeling as if he were going to place himself undera nutmeg-grater, as he thought how James Frost would receive theimplied distrust of his guardianship.The sunset gleam was fading on the sleepy waves that made but a feintof breaking, along the shining expanse of moist uncovered sand, whentwo figures were seen progressing from the projecting rocks, castinglong shadows before them.  Lord Ormersfield began to prepare amollifying address--but, behold!  Was it the effect of light so much tolengthen Jem's form? nay, was it making him walk with a stick?  Asudden, unlooked-for hope seized the Earl.  The next minute he had beenrecognised; and in the grasping hands and meeting eyes, all wasforgotten, save the true, fond affection of father and son.'I did not expect this pleasure.  They told me you were dining out.''Only rowing Jem to the landing-place.  I told him to make my excuses.It is a dinner to half the neighbourhood, and my foot is alwaystroublesome if I do not lay it up in the evening.''I am glad you are prudent,' said his father, dismissing his fears inhis gratification, and proceeding to lay his coming to the score of hisfoot.Fitzjocelyn did not wish to see through the plea--he was much too happyin his father's unusual warmth and tenderness, and in the delights ofhospitality.  Mrs. Hannaford was gone out, and eatables were scarce;but a tea-dinner was prepared merrily between Priscilla, the Captain,and Louis, who gloried in displaying his school-fagging accomplishmentswith toast, eggs, and rashers--hobbled between parlour and kitchen,helping Priscilla, joking with the Captain, and waiting on his fatherso eagerly and joyously as to awaken a sense of adventure and enjoymentin the Earl himself.  No meal, with Frampton behind his chair, had everequalled Fitzjocelyn's cookery or attendance; and Louis's reminiscencesof the penalties he had suffered from his seniors for burnt toast,awoke like recollections of schoolboy days, hitherto in utter oblivion,and instead of the intended delicate conversation, father and son foundthemselves laughing over a 'tirocinium or review of schools.'Still, the subject must be entered on; and when Lord Ormersfield hadmentioned the engagement to go to Oakstead, he added, 'All is well,since I have found you here.  Let me tell you that I never felt moregrateful nor more relieved than by this instance of regard for mywishes.'Though knowing the fitful nature of Louis's colour, he would have beenbetter satisfied not to have called up such an intensity of red, and tohave had some other answer than, 'I wish you saw more of them.''I see them every year in London.''London gives so little scope for real acquaintance,' ventured Louisagain, with downcast eyes.'You forget that Lady Conway is my sister-in-law.'  Louis would havespoken, but his father added, 'Before you were born, I had fullexperience of her.  You must take it on trust that her soft,prepossessing manners belong to her as a woman of the world who cannotsee you without designs on you.''Of course,' said Louis, 'I yield to your expressed wishes; but my aunthas been very kind to me: and,' he added, after trying to mould thewords to their gentlest form, 'you could not see my cousins withoutbeing convinced that it is the utmost injustice--''I do not censure them,' said his father, as he hesitated betweenindignation and respect, 'I only tell you, Louis, that nothing couldgrieve me more than to see your happiness in the keeping of a pupil ofLady Conway.'He met a look full of consternation, and of struggles between filialdeference and the sense of injustice.  All Louis allowed himself to saywas, however, 'Surely, when I am her own nephew! when our poverty is aflagrant fact--she may be acquitted of anything but caring for mefor--for my mother's sake.'There was a silence that alarmed Louis, who had never before named hismother to the Earl.  At last, Lord Ormersfield spoke clearly andsternly, in characteristic succinct sentences, but taking breathbetween each.  'You shall have no reason to think me prejudiced.  Iwill tell you facts.  There was a match which she desired for suchcauses as lead her to seek you.  The poverty was greater, and she knewit.  On one side there was strong affection; on that which sheinfluenced there was--none whatever.  If there were scruples, shesmothered them.  She worked on a young innocent mind to act out herdeceit, and without a misgiving on--on his part that his feelings worenot returned, the marriage took place.''It could not have been all her own fault,' cried Louis.  'It must havebeen a willing instrument--much to blame--'His father cut him short with sudden severity, such as startled him.'Never say so, Louis.  She was a mere child, educated for that solepurpose, her most sweet and docile nature wasted and perverted.''And you know this of your own knowledge?' said Fitzjocelyn, stillstriving to find some loophole to escape from such testimony.The Earl paused, as if to collect himself, then repeated the words,slowly and decidedly, 'Of my own knowledge.  I could not have spokenthus otherwise.''May I ask how it ended?''As those who marry for beauty alone have a right to expect.  There wasneither confidence nor sympathy.  She died early.  I--we--those wholoved her as their own life--were thankful.'Louis perceived the strong effort and great distress with which thesewords were uttered, and ventured no answer, glancing hastily throughall his connexions to guess whose history could thus deeply affect hisfather; but he was entirely at a loss; and Lord Ormersfield, recoveringhimself, added, 'Say no more of this; but, believe me, it was to spareyou from her manoeuvres that I kept you apart from that family.''The Northwold baths have been recommended for Louisa,' saidFitzjocelyn.  'Before we knew of your objections, we mentioned MissFaithfull's lodgings.'What the Earl was about to utter, he suppressed.'You cannot look at those girls and name manoeuvring!' cried Louis.'Poor things.'After a silence, Lord Ormersfield added, with more anxiety thanprudence, 'Set my mind at rest, Louis.  There can have been no harmdone yet, in so short a time.''I--don't--know--' said Louis, slowly.  'I have seldom spoken to her,to be sure.  She actually makes me shy!  I never saw anything half solovely.  I cannot help her reigning over my thoughts.  I shall neverbelieve a word against her, though I cannot dispute what you say of myaunt.  She is of another mould, I wish you could let me hope that--'A gesture of despair from his father cut him short.'I will do whatever you please,' he concluded.'You will find that time conquers the fancy,' said the Earl, quickly.'I am relieved to find that you have at least not committed yourself:it would be no compliment to Mary Ponsonby.'Louis's lip curled somewhat; but he said no more, and made noobjections to the arrangements which his father proceeded to detail.Doubtful of the accommodations of Ebbscreek, Lord Ormersfield hadprudently retained his fly, and though Louis, intending to sleep on thefloor, protested that there was plenty of room, he chose to return tothe inn at Bickleypool.  He would call for Louis to-morrow, to take himfor a formal call at Beauchastel; and the day after they would gotogether to Oakstead, leaving James to return home, about ten dayssooner than had been previously concerted.Lord Ormersfield had not been gone ten minutes, before James's quickbounding tread was heard far along the dry woodland paths. He vaultedover the gate, and entered by the open window, exclaiming, as he didso, 'Hurrah!  The deed is done; the letter is off to engage the HouseBeautiful.''Doom is doom!' were the first words that occurred to Louis.  'The lionand the prince.''What's that?''There was once a king,' began Louis, as if the tale were the newest inthe world, 'whose son was predestined to be killed by a lion. Aftermuch consideration, his majesty enclosed his royal highness in a tower,warranted wild-beast proof, and forbade the chase to be mentioned inhis hearing.  The result was, that the locked-up prince died oflook-jaw in consequence of tearing his hand with a nail in the pictureof the lion.''I shall send that apologue straight to Ormersfield.''You may spare that trouble.  My father has been with me all theevening.''Oh! his double-ganger visits you.  That accounts for your freaks.''Double-gangers seldom come in yellow-bodied flys.''His lordship in propria persona.  You don't mean it.''He is sleeping at the 'George' at Bickleypool.  There is a lettercoming to-morrow by the post, to say he is coming to-day, with everyimaginable civility to you; but I am to go to the rose-colouredpastor's with him on Wednesday.''So there's an end of our peace and comfort!''I am afraid we have sadly discomposed his peace.''Did you discover whether his warnings have the slightest foundation?''He told me a history that somewhat accounts for his distrust of myaunt.  I think there must be another side to it, and nothing can bemore unjust than to condemn all the family, but it affected him soexceedingly that I do not wonder at his doing so.  He gave no names,but I am sure it touched him very nearly.  Can you tell who it couldhave been?'  And he narrated enough to make James exclaim, 'It ought totouch him nearly.  He was talking of himself.''Impossible!--my mother!' cried Louis, leaping up.'Yes--his own version of his married life.''How do you know?  You cannot remember it,' said Louis, though too wellconvinced, as he recollected the suppressed anguish, and the horrorwith which all blame of the young wife had been silenced.'I have heard of it again and again.  It was an unhappy, ill-assortedmarriage: she was gay, he was cold.''My Aunt Catharine says so?''As far as she can blame anything.  Your mother was a sweet blossom ina cold wind.  She loved and pitied her with all her heart.  Your auntwas talking, this very evening, of your father having carried hersister to Ormersfield, away from all her family, and one reason of herdesire to go to Northwold is to see those who were with her at last.'Louis was confounded.  'Yes! I see,' he said.  'How obtuse not to readit in his own manner!  How much it explains!' and he silently restedhis brow on his hands.'Depend upon it, there are two sides to the story.  I would not be apretty, petted, admired girl in his keeping.''Do you think it mends matters with me to fasten blame on either?' saidLouis, sadly.  'No; I was realizing the perception of such a thread ofmisery woven into his life, and thinking how little I have felt forhim.''Endowing him with your own feelings, and then feeling for him!''No.  I cannot estimate his feeling.  He is of harder, firmer stuffthan I; and for that very reason, I suspect, suffering is a moreterrific thing.  I heard the doctors saying, when I bore pain badly,that it would probably do the less future harm: a bad moral, but Ibelieve it is true of the mental as of the physical constitution.'Answering something between a look and a shrug of James, he mused on,aloud--'I understand better what the wreck of affection must have been.''For my part,' said James, 'I do not believe in the affection that cantyrannize over and blight a woman.''Nay, James! I cannot doubt.  My very name--my having been called byit, are the more striking in one so fond of usage and precedent. Thingsthat passed between him and Mrs. Ponsonby while I was ill--much that Ilittle regarded and ill requited--show what force of love and griefthere must have been.  The cold, grave manner, is the broken,inaccessible edge of the cliff rent asunder.''If romance softens the rough edge, you are welcome to it!  I may aswell go to bed!''Not romance--the sad reality of my poor father's history.  I trust Ishall never treat his wishes so lightly--'Impatient of one-sided sympathy, James exclaimed, 'As if you did notgive way to him like a slave!''Yes, like a slave,' said Louis, gravely.  'I wish to give way like ason who would try to comfort him for what he has undergone.''Now, I should have thought your feeling would have been for yourmother!''If my mother could speak to me,' said Louis, with trembling lips, 'shewould surely bid me to try my utmost, as far as in me lies, to bringpeace and happiness to my father.  I cannot tell where the errors mayhave been, and I will never ask.  If she was as like to me as they say,I could understand some of them!  At least, I know that I am doublybound to give as little vexation to him as possible, and I trust thatyou will not make it harder to me.  You lost your father so early, thatyou can hardly estimate--''The trial?' said James, willing to give what had passed the air of ajoke.'Exactly so--Good night.'CHAPTER XIV.NEW INHABITANTS.Sometimes a troop of damsels glad--Sometimes a curly shepherd lad,Or long-haired page in crimson clad,Goes by to towered Camelot;And sometimes, through the mirror blue,The knights come riding two and two.She hath no loyal knight and true--The Lady of Shalott.TENNYSON.'Oakstead, Oct. 14th, 1847.'My Dear Aunt,--I find that Fitzjocelyn is writing to you, but I thinkyou will wish for a fuller account of him than can be obtained from hisown letters.  Indeed, I should be much obliged if you would kindlyexercise your influence to persuade him that he is not in a conditionto be imprudent with impunity.  Sir Miles Oakstead was absolutelyshocked to see the alteration in his appearance, as well as in hisspirits; and although both our kind host and hostess are mostsolicitous on his account, it happens unfortunately that they are atthis juncture quite alone, so that he is without companions of his ownage.  I must not, however, alarm you.  The fact is, that circumstanceshave occurred which, though he has acted in the most exemplary manner,have harassed and distressed him a good deal, and his health suffersfrom the difficulty of taking sufficient exercise. James will triumphwhen he hears that I regret having shortened his stay by the sea-side;for neither the place nor the weather seems to agree with him: he hashad a recurrence of wakeful nights, and is very languid.  Poor boy!yesterday he wandered out alone in the rain, lost his way, and camehome so fatigued that he slept for three hours on the sofa, but to-dayhe seems better--has more colour, and has been less silent.  We go toLeffingham Castle from Monday till Thursday, when I shall take him toLondon for Hastings to decide whether it be fit for him to return toChristchurch after the vacation, according to his own most anxiouswish.  With my love to Mary Ponsonby and her daughter, and bestremembrances to James,'Your affectionate nephew,'ORMERSFIELD.'The same envelope contained another letter of many sheets, beginning ina scrawl:--'Scene--Rose-coloured Pastor's Nest.  Tables, chairs, books, papers,despatch-boxes.  The two ex-ministers writing and consulting. ViscountF. looking on like a colt running beside its parent at plough, thinkingthat harness leaves deep marks, and that he does not like the furrow.'October 13th, 1847.--That correct date must be a sign that he isgetting into harness.'Well, dear Aunt Kitty, to make a transition from the third to thefirst person, like Mrs. Norris, you have in this short scene an epitomeof the last fortnight.  Lady Oakstead is an honourable matron, whom Ipity for having me in her way; a man unable to be got rid of by thelawful exercises of shooting and riding, and with a father alwaysconsulting her about him, and watching every look and movement, tillthe blood comes throbbing to my temples by the mere attraction of hiseyes.  To be watched into a sense of impatience and ingratitude, is atrial of life for which one is not prepared.  My father and Sir Milesare very busy; I hang here an anomaly, sitting with them as being lessin their way than in Lady Oakstead's, and wondering what I shall betwenty years hence.  I am sick of the only course of life that willcontent my father, and I can see no sunshine likely to brighten it.But, at least, no one's happiness is at stake but my own.  Here is akind, cordial letter from Lady Conway, pressing me to join her atScarborough, make expeditions, &c.  My father is in such a state aboutme, that I believe I could get his consent to anything, but I supposeit would not be fair, and I have said nothing to him as yet.  On Mondaywe go to Leffingham, which, I hear, is formality itself.  After that,more state visits, unless I can escape to Oxford.  My father fancies menot well enough; but pray unite all the forces of the Terrace toimpress that nothing else will do me any good.  Dragging about in thisdreary, heartless way is all that ails me, and reading for my degreewould be the best cure.  I mean to work hard for honours, and, ifpossible, delude myself with hopes of success.  Work is the need.Here, there is this one comfort.  There is no one to talk to, no birdsin last year's nest, sons absent, daughters disposed of, but,unluckily, the Pastoress, under a mistaken sense of kindness, has askedthe Vicar's son to walk with me, and he is always lying in wait,--anEnsign in a transition state between the sheepish schoolboy and thefast man, with an experience of three months of depot.  Having rousedhim from the pristine form, I regret the alternative.'Did I ever write so savage a letter?  Don't let it vex you, or I won'tsend it.  What a bull!  There is such a delectable Scotch mist, that noone will suspect me of going out; and I shall actually cheat theEnsign, and get a walk in solitude to hearten me for the dismal statedinner party of the evening.'October 14th.--Is it in the book of fate that I should always treatthis rose-coloured pastor like a carrion crow?  I have done it again!And it has but brought out more of my father's marvellous kindness andpatience.'I plunged into the Scotch mist unsuspected and unpursued.  The visibleebullition of discontent had so much disgusted me that I must needs seewhether anything could be done with it, and fairly face the matter, asI can only do in a walk.  Pillow counsel is feverish and tumultuous;one is hardly master of oneself.  The soft, cool, mist-laden air, heavybut incense-breathing, was a far more friendly adjunct in the quietdecay of nature--mournful, but not foul nor corrupt, because man hadnot spoilt it.  It suited me better than a sunny, glaring day, such asI used to revel in, and the brightness of which, last spring, made mepine to be in the free air.  Such days are past with me; I had betterknow that they are, and not strive after them.  Personal happiness isthe lure, not the object, in this world.  I have my Northwold home, andI am beginning to see that my father's comfort depends on me as Ilittle imagined, and sufficiently to sweeten any sacrifice.  So I havewritten to refuse Scarborough, for there is no use in trying to combinetwo things, pleasing my father and myself.  I wish the determinationmay last; but mine have never been good for much, and you must help me.'Neither thinking nor fog conduced to seeing where I was going; andwhen my ankle began to give out, and I was going to turn, I ran into ahedge, which, looming through the mist, I had been taking for a finerange of distant mountains--rather my way of dealing with otherobjects.  Being without a horse on whose neck to lay the reins, I couldonly coast the hedge, hoping it might lead me back to Oakstead Park,which I had abandoned in my craving for space and dread of being doggedby the Ensign.  But the treacherous hedge led me nowhere but to ahorsepond; and when I had struggled out of the adjacent mire, andattained a rising ground, I could only see about four yards square ofbare down, all the rest being grey fog.  Altogether, the scene wasworth something.  I heard what I thought the tinkling of a sheep bellthrough the cloud, which dulled the sound like cotton wool; I pursuedthe call, when anon, the veil began to grow thin, and revealed, lookingjust like a transparency, a glimpse of a little village in a valleyalmost under my feet, trees, river, church-spire and all, and the bellbecame clearer, and showed me what kind of flock it was meant for.  Iturned that way, and had just found a path leading down the steep, whendown closed the cloud--a natural dissolving view--leaving me wonderingwhether it had been mirage or imagination, till presently, the curtaindrew up in earnest.  Out came, not merely form, but colour, as I haveseen a camera clear itself--blue sky, purple hills, russet and orangewoods, a great elm green picked out with yellow, a mass of brown oaks,a scarlet maple, a beech grove, skirting a brilliant water meadow, witha most reflective stream running through it, and giving occasion for asingle arched bridge, and a water mill, with a wheel draperied withwhite foam; two swans disporting on the water (I would not declare theywere not geese), a few cottony flakes of mist hanging over dampcorners, the hill rising green, with the bright whitewashed cottages ofthis district, on the side a rich, red, sandstone-coloured church, latearchitecture, tower rather mouldering--all the more picturesque;churchyard, all white headstones and ochreous sheep, surmounted by amushroom-shaped dark yew tree, railed in with intensely white rails,the whole glowing in the parting coup-de-soleil of a wet day, everytear of every leaf glistening, and everything indescribably lustrous.It is a picture that one's mental photograph ought to stamp for life,and the cheering and interest it gave, no one but you can understand. Iwished for you, I know.  It looks so poor in words.'After the service, I laid hold of the urchin whose hearty stare hadmost reminded me of Tom Madison, and gave him a shilling to guide meback to Oakstead, a wise measure, for down came the cloud, blotting allout like the Castle of St. John, and by the time I came home, it waspitch dark and raining hard, and my poor father was imagining me at thefoot of another precipice.  I was hoping to creep up in secret, butthey all came out, fell upon me, Lady Oakstead sent me tea, and orderedme to rest; and so handsomely did I obey, that when next I opened myeyes, and saw my father waiting, as I thought, for me to go down todinner with him, I found he had just come up after the ladies hadquitted the dining-room.  So kind and so little annoyed did he seem,that I shook myself, to be certified that I had broken no more bones,but it was all sheer forbearance and consideration--enough to go toone's heart--when it was the very thing to vex him most.  With greatpenitence, I went down, and the first person I encountered was the verycurate I had seen in my misterious village, much as if he had walkedout of a story book. On fraternizing, I found him to be a friend ofHoldsworth.  Lady Oakstead is going to take me, this afternoon, to seehis church, &c., thoroughly; and behold, I learn from him that she is anotable woman for doing good in her parish, never so happy as introtting to cottages, though her good deeds are always in thebackground. Thereupon, I ventured to attack her this morning on cottagegarniture, and obtained the very counsel I wanted about ovens andpiggeries, we began to get on together, and she is to put me up to allmanner of information that I want particularly.  I must go now, not tokeep her waiting, never mind the first half of my letter--I have notime to cancel it now.  I find my father wants to put in a note: don'tbelieve a word that he says, for I am much better to-day, body and mind.Goosey, goosey gander,Where shall we wander,Anywhere, everywhere, to remain still'Your most affectionate,'FITS GOSLING.'Dear Aunt Kitty!  One of her failings was never to be able to keep aletter to herself.  She fairly cried over her boy's troubles; and Mrs.Ponsonby would not have known whether to laugh or cry but for James'sdoleful predictions, which were so sentimental as to turn even hisgrandmother to the laughing party, and left him no sympathizer butMary, who thought it very hard and cruel to deride Louis when he wastrying so earnestly to be good and suffering so much.  Why should theyall--Aunt Catharine herself--be merry over his thinking the spring-daysof his life past away, and trying so nobly and patiently to resignhimself?'It is the way of the world, Mary,' said James.  'People think they arelaughing at the mistaking a flock of sheep for the army of Pentapolinof the naked arm, when they are really sneering at the lofty spirittaking the weaker side.  They involve the sublime temper in theridiculous accident, and laugh both alike to scorn.''Not mamma and Aunt Catharine,' said Mary.  'Besides, is not half theharm in the world done by not seeing where the sublime is invaded bythe ridiculous?''I see nothing ridiculous in the matter,' said James.  'His father hasdemanded an unjustifiable sacrifice.  Fitzjocelyn yields and suffers.''I do believe Lord Ormersfield must relent; you see how pleased he is,saying that Louis's conduct is exemplary.''He would sacrifice a dozen sons to one prejudice!''Perhaps Miss Conway will overcome the prejudice.  I am sure, if hethinks Louis's conduct exemplary, Louis must have the sort of happinesshe used to wish for most, and his father would do his very best togratify him.'That sentence was Mary's cheval de bataille in her discussions withJames, who could never be alone with her without broaching the subject.The two cousins often walked together during James's month atNorthwold.  The town church was not very efficiently served, and wasonly opened in the morning and late evening on Sundays, without anyafternoon prayers, and James was often in the habit of walking toOrmersfield church for the three o'clock service, and asking Mary tojoin him.  Their return was almost always occupied in descriptions ofMiss Conway's perfections, and Mary learnt to believe that two beings,evidently compounded of every creature's best, must be destined foreach other.'How well it is,' she thought, 'that I did not stand in the way.  Oh!how unhappy and puzzled I should be now.  How thankful I am that dearmamma understood all for us so well!  How glad I am that Louis iswaiting patiently, not doing anything self-willed.  As long as hisfather says he is exemplary, it must make one happy, and mamma willconvince Lord Ormersfield.  It will all turn out well; and howdelightful it will be to see him quite happy and settled!'Mary and her mother had by this time taken root at Dynevor Terrace, andformed an integral part of the inhabitants.  Their newspaper went theround of the houses, their name was sent to the Northwold book-club andenrolled among the subscribers to local charities, and Miss MercyFaithfull found that their purse and kitchen would bear deeper haulsthan she could in general venture upon.  Mary was very happy, workingunder her, and was a welcome and cheerful visitor to the many sick,aged, and sorrowful to whom she introduced her.If Mary could only have induced Aunt Melicent to come and see with herown eyes, to know Mrs. Frost and the Faithfull sisters, and, above all,to see mamma in her own house, she thought one of her most eager wisheswould have been fulfilled.  But invite as she and her mother might,they could not move Miss Ponsonby from Bryanstone Square.  Railroadsand country were both her dread; and she was not inclined, to overcomeher fears on behalf of a sister-in-law whom she forgave, but could notlove.'You must give it up, my dear,' said Mrs. Ponsonby.  'I let the timefor our amalgamation pass.  Melicent and I were not tolerant of eachother.  Since she has given you back to me, I can love and respect heras I never did before; but a little breach in youth becomes too wide inage for either repentance or your affection, my dear, to be able tospan it.'Mary saw what a relief it was that the invitations were not accepted,and though she was disappointed, she blamed herself for having wishedotherwise.  Tranquillity was such a boon to that wearied spirit, eachday was so much gain that went by without the painful, fluttered lookof distress, and never had Mrs. Ponsonby had so much quiet enjoymentwith her daughter and her aunt.  Mary was perfectly contented in seeingher better, and had no aims beyond the present trivial, commonplacelife, with so many to help by little ordinary services, and her motherserene and comfortable.  Placid, and yet active, she went busilythrough the day, and did not forget the new pleasures to which Louishad opened her mind.  She took up his books without a pang, and wouldsay, briskly and unblushingly, to her mother, how strange it was thatbefore she had been with him, she had never liked at all, what she nowcared for so much.The winter portended no lack of excitement.  Miss Faithfull's roomswere engaged.  When Miss Mercy ran in breathless to Mrs. Frost with thetidings, she little knew what feelings were excited; the hope and fear,the doubt and curiosity; the sense of guilt towards the elder nephew,in not preventing what she could not prevent, the rejoicing on behalfof the younger nephew; the ladylike scorn of the motives that broughtthe lodgers; yet the warm feeling towards what was dear to Louis andadmired by Jem.What a flapping and battering of carpets on the much-enduring stump!What furious activity of Martha!  What eager help of little Charlotte,who was in a perfect trepidation of delight at the rumour that a realbeauty, fit for a heroine, was coming!  What trotting hither andthither of Miss Mercy!  What netting of blinds and stitching of chintzby Miss Salome!  What envy and contempt on the part of other landladieson hearing that Miss Faithfull's apartments were engaged for the wholewinter!  What an anxious progress was Miss Mercy's, when she conductedMrs. Frost and Mary to a final inspection! and what was her triumphwhen Mary, sitting down on the well-stuffed arm-chair, pronounced thatpeople who would not come there did not understand what comfort was.Every living creature gazed--Mrs. Frost through her blind, Mary behindher hydrangea in the balcony, Charlotte from her attic window,--whenthe lodgers disembarked in full force--two ladies, two children, onegoverness, three maids, two men, two horses, one King Charles'sspaniel!  Let it be what it might, it was a grand windfall for the MissFaithfulls.Mary's heart throbbed as the first carriage thundered upon the gravel,and a sudden swelling checked her voice as she was about to exclaim'There she is!' when the second lady emerged, and moved up the gardenpath.  She was veiled and mantled; but accustomed as was Mary's eye tothe Spanish figure and walk, the wonderful grace of movement anddeportment struck her as the very thing her eye had missed ever sinceshe left Peru.  What the rest of the strangers were like, she knew not;she had only eyes for the creature who had won Louis's affection, anddoubtless deserved it, as all else that was precious.'So they are come, Charlotte,' said Mrs. Frost, as the maiden demurelybrought in the kettle.'Yes, ma'am;' and stooping to put the kettle on, and growingcarnation-coloured over the fire.  'Oh, ma'am, I never saw such a younglady.  She is all one as the king's sister in The Lord of the Isles!'While the object of all this enthusiasm was arriving at the Terrace,she was chiefly conscious that Sir Roland was sinking down on theramparts of Acre, desperately wounded in the last terrible siege; andshe was considering whether palmer or minstrel should carry the tidingsof his death to Adeline.  It was her refuge from the unpleasantfeelings, with which she viewed the experiment of the Northwold bathsupon Louisa's health.  As the carriage stopped, she cast one glance atthe row of houses, they struck her as dreary and dilapidated; she drewher mantle closer, shivered, and walked into the house.  'Small rooms,dingy furniture-that is mamma's affair,' passed through her mind, asshe made a courteous acknowledgment of Miss Mercy's greeting, and stoodby the drawing-room fire.  'Roland slowly awoke from his swoon; awhite-robed old man, with a red eight-pointed cross on his breast, wasbending over him.  He knew himself to be in--I can't remember whichtower the Hospitallers defended.  I wonder whether Marianne can findthe volume of Vertot.''Isabel, Isabel!' shrieked Virginia, who, with Louisa, had been roamingeverywhere, 'here is a discovery in the school-room!  Come!'It was an old framed print of a large house, as much of a sham castleas the nature of things would permit; and beneath were the words'Cheveleigh, the seat of Roland Dynevor, Esquire.''There!' cried Virginia; 'you see it is a castle, a dear old feudalcastle!  Think of that, Isabel!  Why, it is as good as seeing SirRoland himself, to have seen Mr. Dynevor Frost disinherited.  Oh! ifhis name were only Roland, instead of that horrid James!''His initials are J. R.,' said Isabel.  'It is a curious coincidence.''It only wants an Adeline to have the castle now,' said Louisa.  'Oh!there shall be an heiress, and she shall be beautiful, and he shan't gocrusading--he shall marry her.'The sisters had not been aware that the school-room maid, who had beensent on to prepare, was busy unpacking in a corner of the room. 'Theysay, Miss Louisa,' she interposed, 'that Mr. Frost is going to bemarried to a great heiress--his cousin, Miss Ponsonby, at No. 7.'Isabel requited the forwardness by silently leaving the room with thesisters, and Virginia apologized for not having been more cautious thanto lead to such subjects.  'It is all gossip,' she said, angrily;  'Mr.Dynevor would never marry for money.''Nay, let us find in her an Adeline,' said Isabel.The next day, Miss Mercy had hurried into No. 7, to declare that theladies were all that was charming, but that their servants gavethemselves airs beyond credence, especially the butler, who played theguitar, and insisted on a second table; when there was a peal of thebell, and Mary from her post of observation 'really believed it wasLady Conway herself;' whereupon Miss Mercy, without listening topersuasions, popped into the back drawing room to effect her retreat.Lady Conway was all eagerness and cordiality, enchanted to renew heracquaintance, venturing so early a call in hopes of prevailing on Mrs.Ponsonby to come out with her to take a drive.  She conjured uprecollections of Mary's childhood, declared that she looked to her fordrawing Isabel out, and was extremely kind and agreeable.  Mary thoughther delightful, with something of Louis's charm of manner; and Mrs.Ponsonby believed it no acting, for Lady Conway was sincerely affableand affectionate, with great warmth and kindness, and might have beenall that was excellent, had she started into life with a different codeof duty.So there was to be an intimacy.  For Fitzjocelyn's sake, as well as forthe real good-nature of the advances, Mrs. Ponsonby would not shrinkback more than befitted her self-respect.  Of that quality she had lessthan Mrs. Frost, who, with her innate punctilious spirit, avoided allfavours or patronage.  It was curious to see the gentle old lady fireup with all the dignity of the Pendragons, at the least peril ofincurring an obligation, and, though perfectly courteous, easy, andobliging, she contrived to keep at a greater distance than if she hadbeen mistress of Cheveleigh.  There, she would have remembered thatboth she and Lady Conway were aunts to Louis; at Northwold, her carewas to become beholden for nothing that she could not repay.Lady Conway did her best, when driving out with Mrs. Ponsonby, to drawher into confidence.  There were tender reminiscences from her heart ofpoor sweet Louisa, tearful inquiries respecting her last weeks,certainties that Mrs. Ponsonby had been of great use to her; for, poordarling, she had been thoughtless--so much to turn her head.  There wascause for regret in their own education--there was then so much lessattention to essentials.  Lady Conway could not have borne to bring upher own girls as she herself and her sisters had grown up; she hadchosen a governess who made religion the first object, and she wasdelighted to see them all so attached to her; she had never had anyfears of their being too serious--people had learnt to be reasonablenow, did not insist on the impracticable, did not denounce moderategaieties, as had once been done to the alarm of poor Louisa.Sweetest Louisa's son!  She could not speak too warmly of him, and shedeclared herself highly gratified by Mr. Mansell's opinion of hismodesty, attention, and good sense.  Mr. Mansell was an excellentjudge, he had such as opinion of Lord Ormersfield's public character.And, at a safe interval, she mentioned the probability that Beauchastelmight be settled on Isabel, if she should marry so as to please Mr.Mansell: he cared for connexion more than for wealth; if he had aweakness, it was for rank.Mrs. Ponsonby thought it fair that the Earl should be aware of thesefacts.  He smiled ironically.He left his card with his sister-in-law, and, to have it over whileLouis was safe at Oxford, invited the party to spend a day atOrmersfield, with Mrs. Frost to entertain them.  He was far tooconsiderate of the feelings that he attributed to the Ponsonbys to askthem to come; and as three out of the six in company were more or lessin a state of haughtiness and coolness, Lady Conway's graces failedentirely; and poor innocent Virginia and Louisa protested that they hadnever spent so dull a day, and that they could not believe their cousinFitzjocelyn could belong to such a tiresome place.Isabel, who had undergone more dull days than they had, contrived toget through it by torturing Adeline with utter silence of all tidingsfrom the East, and by a swarm of suitors, with the fantastic Viscountforemost.  She never was awake from her dream until Mr. Holdsworth cameto dinner, and was so straightforward and easy that he thawed every one.Afterwards, he never failed to return an enthusiastic reply to thequestion that all the neighbourhood were asking each other--namely,whether they had seen Miss Conway.No one was a more devoted admirer than the Lady of Eschalott, whosewebs had a bad chance when there was one glimpse of Miss Conway to beobtained from the window, and the vision of whose heart was that Mrs.Martha might some day let her stand in the housemaid's closet, tobehold her idol issue forth in the full glory of an evening dress--athing Charlotte had read of, but never seen anything nearer to it thanMiss Walby coming to tea, and her own Miss Clara in the scantiest ofall white muslins.But Mrs. Martha was in an unexampled state of vixenish crossness, andsnapped venomously at mild Mrs. Beckett for the kindest offers ofsparing Charlotte to assist her in her multiplied labours.  She seemedto be running after time all day long, with five dinners and teas uponher hands, poor woman, and allowing herself not the slightestrelaxation, except to rush in for a few seconds to No. 7, to indulgeherself by inveighing against the whole of the fine servants; and yetshe was so proud of having lodgers at all, that she hated them fornothing so much as for threatening to go away.The object of her bitterest invectives was the fastidious butler, Mr.Delaford, who by her account could do nothing for himself, grudged hermistresses their very sitting-room, drank wine with the ladies' maidslike a gentleman, and ordered fish for the second table; talked ofhaving quitted a duke, and submitting to live with Lady Conway becausehe compassionated unprotected females, and my Lady was dependent on himfor the care of Sir Walter in the holidays.  To crown his offences, henever cleaned his own plate, but drew sketches and played the guitar!Moreover, Mrs. Martha had her notions that he was making that sicklyFrenchified maid of Miss Conway's much too fond of him; and as to hiscalling himself Mr. Delaford--why, Mrs. Martha had a shrewd suspicionthat he was some kin to her first cousin's brother-in-law's shopman'swife in Tottenham-court-road, whose name she knew was Ford, and who hadbeen picked out of a gutter!  The establishment of such a fact appearedas if it would be the triumph of Mrs. Martha's life.  In the meantime,she more than hinted that she would wear herself to the bone ratherthan let Charlotte Arnold into the house; and Jane, generallyassenting, though seldom going all lengths, used to divert theconversation by comparisons with Mr. Frampton's politeness andconsideration.  He never came to No. 5 to give trouble, only to help.The invectives produced on Charlotte's mind an effect the reverse ofwhat was intended.  Mr. Delaford, a finer gentleman than Mr. Framptonand Mr. Poynings, must be a wonder of nature.  The guitar--redolent ofserenades and Spanish cloaks--oh! but once to see and hear it! The veryrudeness of Mrs. Martha's words, so often repeated, gave her a feelingin favour of their object.  She had known Mrs. Martha unjust before.Poor Tom! if he had only been a Spaniard, he would have sung about thewhite dove--his pretty thought--in a serenade, but then he might havepoignarded Mr. James in his passion, which would have been lessagreeable--she supposed he had forgotten her long ago--and so much thebetter!It was a Sunday evening.  Every one was gone to church exceptCharlotte, who was left to keep house.  Though November, it was notcold, the day had been warm and showery, and the full moon had risen inthe most glorious brightness, riding in a sky the blue of which lookedalmost black by contrast with her brilliancy.  Charlotte stood at theback door, gazing at the moon walking in brightness, and wandered intothe garden, to enjoy what to her was beyond all other delights, readingGessner's Death of Abel by moonlight.  There was quite sufficientlight, even if she had not known the idyll almost by heart; and in atrance of dreamy, undefined delight, she stood beside the darkivy-covered wall, each leaf glistening in the moonbeams, which shed asubdued pearliness over her white apron and collar, paled but gave ashadowy refinement to her features, and imparted a peculiar soft goldengloss to the fair braids of hair on her modest brow.A sound of opening the back gate made her give one of her violentstarts; but before she could spring into the shelter of the house, shewas checked by the civil words, 'I beg your pardon, I was mistaken--Itook this for No. 8.''Three doors off--' began Charlotte, discovering, with a shy thrill ofsurprise and pleasure, that she had been actually accosted by the greatMr. Delaford; and the moonlight, quite as becoming to him as to her,made him an absolute Italian count, tall, dark, pale, and whiskered.He did not go away at once, he lingered, and said softly, 'I perceivethat you partake my own predilection for the moonlight hour.'Charlotte would have been delighted, had it not been a great dealharder to find an answer than if the old Lord had asked her a question;but she simpered and blushed, which probably did just as well.  Mr.Delaford supposed she knew the poet's lines--'How sweet the moonlight sleeps on yonder bank--''Oh yes, sir--so sweet!' exclaimed the Lady of Eschalott, under herbreath, though yonder bank was only represented by the chequer-work ofMrs. Ponsonby's latticed trellis; and Mr. Delaford proceeded to quotethe whole passage, in a deep mellow voice, but with a great deal ofaffectation; and Charlotte gasped, 'So beautiful!''I perceive that you have a fine taste for poetry,' said Mr. Delaford,so graciously, that Charlotte presumed to say, 'Oh, sir! is it truethat you can play the guitar?'He smiled upon her tone of veneration, and replied, 'a trifle--a littleinstrumental melody was a great resource.  If his poor performancewould afford her any gratification, he would fetch his guitar.''Oh, sir--thank you--a psalm-tune, perhaps.  It is Sunday--if you wouldbe so kind.'He smiled superciliously as he regretted that his music was not of thatdescription, and Charlotte felt ready to sink into the earth at theindignity she had done the guitar in forgetting that it could accompanyanything but such songs as Valancourt sang to Emily.  She begged hispardon humbly; and he declared that he had a great respect for a lady'sscruples, and should be happy to meet her another evening.  'If Mrs.Beckett would allow her,' said Charlotte, overpowered with gratitude:'there would be the moon full to-morrow--how delightful!'  He couldspare a short interval between the dinner and the tea; and with thispromise he took leave.Honest little Charlotte told Mrs. Beckett the whole story, and all hereager wishes for to-morrow evening; and Jane sighed and puzzledherself, and knew it would make Martha very angry, but could not helpbeing goodnatured.  Jane had a great deference for Martha's strong,rough character; but then Martha had never lived in a great house, anddid not know 'what was what,' nor the difference between 'low people'and upper servants.   So Jane acted chaperon as far as her easydiscretion went, and had it to say to her own conscience, and to theangry Martha, that he never said one word that need offend any youngwoman.There was a terrible storm below-stairs in the House Beautiful at theidea of Delaford taking up with Mrs. Frost's littlekitchen-maid--Delaford, the lady's-maid killer par excellence, whereverLady Conway went, and whose coquetries whitened the cheeks of MissConway's poor Marianne, the object of his attentions whenever he had noone else in view.  He had not known Charlotte to be a kitchen-maid whenhe first beheld her, and her fair beauty and retiring grace had hadfull scope, assisted by her veneration for himself; and now the scornof the grand Mrs. Fanshawe, and the amusement of teasing Marianne, onlymade him the more bent on patronizing 'the little rustic,' as he calledher.  He was deferential to Mrs. Beckett, who felt herself in herelement in discussing plate, china, and large establishments with him;and he lent books, talked poetry, and played the guitar to Charlotte,and even began to take her portrait, with her mouth all on one side.Delaford was an admirable servant, said the whole Conway family; he wastrusted as entirely as he represented, and Lady Conway often gave himcharge over her son in sports and expeditions beyond ladies'management: he was, in effect, nearly the ruler of the household, andnever allowed his lady to go anywhere if he did not approve.  If it hadnot been for the 'little rustic's' attractions, perhaps he might havemade strong demonstrations against the House Beautiful.  Little didMiss Faithfull know the real cause of her receiving or retaining herlodgers.CHAPTER XV.MOTLEY THE ONLY WEAR.For better far than passion's glow,Or aught of worldly choice,To listen His own will to know,And, listening, hear his voice.The Angel of Marriage--REV. I. WILLIAMS.The friendships that grew up out of sight were far more effective thananything that Lady Conway could accomplish on the stage.  Miss King andthe Miss Faithfulls found each other out at once, and the governess wasentreated to knock at the door at the bottom of the stairs whenever herpupils could spare her.Then came eager wishes from her pupils to be admitted to the snuggery,and they were invited to see the curiosities.  Isabel believed the'very good' was found, and came with her sisters.  She begged to beallowed to help in their parish work, under Miss Mercy Faithfull'sguidance; and Sir Roland stood still, while she fancied she waslearning to make little frocks, but really listening to theirrevelations of so new a world.  She went out with Miss Mercy--sheundertook a class and a district, and began to be happier than everbefore; though how much of the absolute harder toil devolved on MissKing, neither she nor the governess understood.This led to intercourse with Mary Ponsonby; and Isabel was a verydifferent person in that homely, friendly parlour, from the lofty,frigid Miss Conway of the drawing-room.  Cold hauteur melted beforeMary's frank simplicity, and they became friends as fast as two ladiescould beyond the age of romantic plunges, where on one side there wasgood-will without enthusiasm, on the other enthusiasm and reserve.They called each other 'Miss Conway' and 'Miss Ponsonby,' and exchangedno family secrets; but they were, for all that, faster friends thanyoung ladies under twenty might imagine.One winter's day, the crisp, exhilarating frost had lured them faralong the high road beyond Mr. Calcott's park palings, talking overIsabel's favourite theme, what to wish for her little brother, when thesound of a large clock striking three made Isabel ask where she was.'It was the stable clock at Ormersfield,' said Mary, 'did you not knowwe were on that road?''No, I did not.'  And Isabel would have turned, but Mary begged her totake a few steps up the lane, that they might see how LordFitzjocelyn's new cottages looked.  Isabel complied, and added, after apause, 'Are you one of Lord Fitzjocelyn's worshippers?''I should not like to worship any one,' said Mary, lookingstraightforward.  'I am very fond of him, because I have known him allmy life.  And he is so good!''Then I think I may consider you exempt!  It is the only fault I haveto find with Northwold.  You are the only person who does not raveabout him--the only person who has not mentioned his name.''Have I not?  I think that was very unkind of me--''Very kind to me,' said Isabel.'I meant, to him,' said Mary, blushing; 'if you thought that I did notthink most highly of him--''Don't go on!  I was just going to trust to you for a calm,dispassionate statement of his merits, and I shall soon lose all myfaith in you.''My mother--' began Mary; but just then Lord Ormersfield came forthfrom one of the cottages, and encountered the young ladies.  Heexplained that Fitzjocelyn was coming home next week, and he had cometo see how his last orders had been executed, since Frampton and thecarpenter had sometimes chosen to think for themselves.  He was veryanxious that all should be right, and, after a few words, revealed aperplexity about ovens and boilers, in which Mary's counsel would beinvaluable.  So, with apologies and ceremonies to Miss Conway, theyentered, and Isabel stood waiting in the dull kitchen, smelling of rawplaster, wondering at the extreme eagerness of the discussion with themason over the yawning boiler, the Earl referring to his son's letter,holding it half-a-yard off, and at last giving it to Mary to decipherby the waning light.So far had it waned, that when the fixtures had all been inspected,Lord Ormersfield declared that the young ladies must not return alone,and insisted on escorting them home.  Every five minutes some onethought of something to say: there was an answer, and by good luck arejoinder; then all died away, and Mary pondered how her mother wouldin her place have done something to draw the two together, but shecould not.  She feared the walk had made Isabel more adverse to allconnected with Ormersfield than even previously; for the Ormersfieldroad was avoided, and the question as to Fitzjocelyn's merits was neverrenewed.Mary thought his cause would be safest in the hands of his greatchampion, who was coming home from Oxford with him, and was to occupyhis vacation in acting tutor to little Sir Walter Conway.  Louis came,the day after his return, with his father, to make visits in theTerrace, and was as well-behaved and uninteresting as morning callingcould make him.   He was looking very well--his general health quiterestored, and his ankle much better; though he was still forbidden toride, and could not walk far.'You must come and see me, Aunt Kitty,' he said; 'I am not availablefor coming in to see you.  I'm reading, and I've made a resignation ofmyself,' he added, with a slight blush, and debonnaire shrug, glancingto see that his father was occupied with James.They were to dine with Lady Conway on the following Tuesday.  In theinterim, no one beheld them except Jem, who walked to Ormersfield onceor twice for some skating for his little pupil Walter, and came backreporting that Louis had sold himself, body and soul, to his father.Clara came home, a degree more civilized, and burning to confide toLouis that she had thought of his advice, had been the less miserablefor it, and had much more on which to consult him.  She could notconceive why even grandmamma would not consent to her accompanying theskaters; though she was giving herself credit for protesting that shewas not going on the ice, only to keep poor Louis company, while theothers were skating.She was obliged to defer her hopes of seeing him until Tuesday, whenshe had been asked to drink tea in the school-room, and appear in theevening.  Mrs. Frost had consented, as a means of exempting herselffrom the party.  And Clara's incipient feminine nature began to flutterat her first gaiety.  The event was magnified by a present from Jem, ofa broad rose-coloured sash and white muslin dress, with a caution thatshe was not to consider the tucks up to the waist as a provision forfuture growth.She flew to exhibit the finery to the Miss Faithfulls, and to consulton the making-up, and, to her consternation, was caught by Miss Conwaykneeling on the floor, being measured by Miss Salome.  To Isabel, therewas a sort of touching novelty in the simplicity that could glory inpink ribbon when embellished by being a brother's gift; she looked onwith calm pleasure at such homely excitement, and even fetched somebows of her own, for examples, and offered to send Marianne down withpatterns.Clara was enchanted to recognise in Miss Conway the vision of theEuston-square platform.  The grand, quiet style of beauty was exactlyfitted to impress a mind like hers, so strongly imbued with sentimentslike those of Louis, and regarding Isabel as necessarily Louis'sdestiny, she began to adore her accordingly, with a girl-reverence,quite as profound, far more unselfish, and little less ardent than thatof man for woman.  That a female vision of perfection should engrossClara's imagination, was a step towards softening her; but, poor child!the dawn of womanhood was to come in a painful burst.Surprised at her own aspect, with her light hair dressed by Jane andwreathed with ivy leaves by grandmamma, and her skirts so full that shecould not refrain from making a gigantic cheese, she was inspected andadmired by granny and Jane, almost approved by Jem himself; and,exalted by the consciousness of being well-dressed, she repaired to theschool-room tea at the House Beautiful.Virginia and Louisa were, she thought, very poor imitations of Louis'scountenance--the one too round, the other too thin and sallow; but boththey, their brother, and Miss King were so utterly unlike anything atschool, that she was at once at ease, and began talking with Walterover schoolboy fun, in which he could not be a greater proficient thanherself.  Walter struck up a violent friendship for her on the spot,and took to calling her 'a fellow,' in oblivion of her sex; andVirginia and Louisa fell into ecstasies of laughter, which encouragedClara and Walter to compote with each other which should most astonishtheir weak minds.In the drawing-room, Lady Conway spoke so graciously, that Clara, wasquite distressed at looking over her head.  Mary looked somewhatoppressed, saying her mother had not been so well that day; and she wasdisposed to keep in the background, and occupy herself with Clara; butit was quite contrary to the Giraffe's notions to be engrossed by anyone when Louis was coming.  As if she had divined Mary's intentions ofkeeping her from importuning him, she was continually gazing at thedoor, ready at once to claim his attention.At first, the gentlemen only appeared in a black herd at the door,where Mr. Calcott had stopped Lord Ormersfield short, in his eagernessto impress on him the views of the county on a police-bill in course ofpreparation for the next session.  The other magistrates congregatedround; but James Frost and Sydney Calcott had slipped past, to thepiano where Lady Conway had sent Miss Calcott and Isabel.  'Why did notFitzjocelyn, come too?' was murmured by the young group in the recessopposite the door; and when at last he became visible, leaning againstthe wall, listening to the Squire, Virginia declared he was going toserve them just as he used at Beauchastel.'Oh, no! he shan't--I'll rescue him!' exclaimed Clara; and leaping upto her cameleopard attitude, she sprang forward, and, with a voiceaudible in an unlucky lull of the music, she exclaimed, 'Louis! Louis!don't you see that I am here?'As he turned, with a look of surprise and almost rebuke, her own wordscame back to her ears as they must have sounded to others; her facebecame poppy-coloured, nothing light but her flaxen eyebrows; and shescarcely gave her hand to be shaken.  'No, I did not know you werecoming,' he said; and almost partaking her confusion, as he felt alleyes upon her, he looked in vain for a refuge for her.How welcome was Mary's kind face and quiet gesture, covering poorClara's retreat as she sank into a dark nook, sheltered by the oldblack cabinet!  Louis thanked Mary by a look, as much as to say, 'Justlike you,' and was glad to perceive that James had not been present.He had gone to ask Miss Faithfull to supply the missing stanzas of aJacobite song, and just then returned, saying that she knew them, butcould not remember them.Fitzjocelyn, however, capped the fragment, and illustrated it with someanecdotes that interested Miss Conway.  James had great hopes that shewas going to see him to the best advantage, but still there was a greatdrawback in the presence of Sydney Calcott.  Idolized at home,successful abroad, young Calcott had enough of the prig to be aperpetual irritation to Jem Frost, all the more because he could nevermake Louis resent, nor accept, as other than natural, the goodnaturedsupercilious patronage of the steady distinguished senior towards theidle junior.Jacobite legends and Stuart relics would have made Miss Conwayoblivious of everything else; but Sydney Calcott must needs divert theconversation from that channel by saying, 'Ah! there Fitzjocelyn is inhis element.  He is a perfect handbook to the byways of history.''For the diffusion of useless knowledge?' said Louis.'Illustrated by the examination, when the only fact you could adduceabout the Argonauts was that Charles V. founded the order of the GoldenFleece.''I beg your pardon; it was his great-grandfather.  I had read myQuentin Durward too well for that.''I suspect,' said Isabel, 'that we had all rather be examined in ourQuentin Durward than our Charles V.'Ah!' said young Calcott, 'I had all my dates at my fingers' ends whenI went up for the modern history prize.  Now my sister could beat me.''A proof of what I always say,' observed Louis, 'that it is lost labourto read for an examination.''From personal experience?' asked Sydney.'A Strasburg goose nailed down and crammed before a fire, becomes aStrasburg pie,' said Louis.Never did Isabel look more bewildered, and Sydney did not seem at onceto catch the meaning.  James added, 'A goose destined to fulfil theterm of existence is not crammed, but the pie stimulus is not requiredto prevent it from starving.''Is your curious and complimentary culinary fable aimed against readingor against examinations?' asked Sydney.'Against neither; only against the connecting preposition.''Then you mean to find a superhuman set of students?''No; I'm past that.  Men and examinations will go on as they are; thegoose will run wild, the requirements will be increased, he will nailhimself down in his despair; and he who crams hardest, and has thehottest place will gain.''Then how is the labour lost?' asked Isabel.'You are new to Fitzjocelyn's paradoxes,' said Sydney; as if gloryingin having made Louis contradict himself.'The question is, what is lost labour?' said Louis.Both Sydney Calcott and Miss Conway looked as if they thought he wasarguing on after a defeat.  'Calcott is teaching her his ownobtuseness!' thought James, in a pet; and he exclaimed, 'Is the aim tomake men or winners of prizes?''The aim of prizes is commonly supposed to be to make men,' loftilyobserved Sydney.'Exactly so; and, therefore, I would not make them too analogous to theStrasburg system,' said Louis.  'I would have them close, searching,but not admitting of immediate cramming.''Pray how would you bring that about?''By having no subject on which superficial knowledge could make a show.''Oh!  I see whither you are working round!  That won't do now, my dearfellow; we must enlarge our field, or we shall lay ourselves open tothe charge of being narrow-minded.''You have not strength of mind to be narrow-minded!' said Louis,shaking his head.  'Ah! well, I have no more to say; my trust is in thenarrow mind, the only expansive one--'He was at that moment called away; Lord Ormersfield's carriage had beenannounced, and his son was not in a quarter of the room where he wishedto detain him.  James could willingly have bitten Sydney Calcott forthe observation, 'Poor Fitzjocelyn! he came out strong to-night.''Very clever,' said Isabel, wishing to gratify James.'Oh yes, very; if he had ever taken pains,' said Sydney.  'There isoften something in his paradoxes.  After all, I believe he is readinghard for his degree, is he not, Jem?  His feelings would not be hurt bythe question, for he never piqued himself upon his consistency.'Luckily for the general peace, the Calcott household was on the move,and Jem solaced himself on their departure by exclaiming, 'Well done,Strasburg system!  A high-power Greek-imbibing machine, he may be, butas to comprehending Fitzjocelyn--''Nay,' said Isabel, 'I think Lord Fitzjocelyn ought to carry about apocket expositor, if he will be so very startling.   He did not stay totell us what to understand by narrow minds.''Did you ever hear of any one good for anything, that was not accusedof a narrow mind?' exclaimed James.'If that were what he meant,' said Isabel,--'but he said his trust wasin the narrow mind--''In what is popularly so called,' said James.'I think,' said Mary, leaning forward, and speaking low, 'that he didnot mean it to be explained away.  I think he was going to say that theheart may be wide, but the mind must be so far narrow, that it willaccept only the one right, not the many wrong.''I thought narrowness of mind consisted in thinking your own way theonly right one,' said Isabel.'Every one says so,' said Mary, 'and that is why he says it takesstrength of mind to be narrow-minded.  Is not the real evil, thejudging people harshly, because their ways are not the same; not thebeing sure that the one way is the only right!  Others may be betterthan ourselves, and may be led right in spite of their error, butsurely we are not to think all paths alike--'And is that Lord Fitzjocelyn's definition of a narrow mind?' saidIsabel.  'It sounds like faith and love.  Are you sure you did not makeit yourself, Miss Ponsonby?''I could not,' said Mary, blushing, as she remembered one Sundayevening when he had said something to that effect, which had insensiblyoverthrown the theory in which she had been bred up, namely, that allthe sincere were right, and yet that, practically every one was to becensured, who did not act exactly like Aunt Melicent.She rose to take leave, and Clara clung to her, emerging from the shadeof her cabinet with colour little mitigated since her disappearance.James would have come with them, but was detained by Lady Conway for afew moments longer than it took them to put on their shawls; and Clarawould not wait.  She dragged Mary down the steps into the darkness, andgroaned out, 'O Mary, he can never speak to me again!''My dear! he will not recollect it.  It was very awkward, but newplaces and new people often do make us forget ourselves.''Everybody saw, everybody heard!  O, I shall never bear to meet one ofthem again!''I think very few saw or heard--' began Mary.'He did!  I did!  That's enough!  The rest is nothing!  I have been asbad as any one at school!  I shall never hold up my head there again asI have done, and Louis!  Oh!''Dear child, it will not be remembered.  You only forgot how tall youwere, and that you were not at home.  He knows you too well to care.'James shouted from behind to know why they had not been let into thehouse; and as Clara rushed in at the door and he walked on with Mary toleave her at home and fetch his grandmother, who had been spending theevening with Mrs. Ponsonby, he muttered, 'I don't know which is mostintolerable!  He neglects her, talks what, if it be not nonsense, mightas well be; and as if she were not ready enough to misunderstand,Sydney Calcott must needs thrust in his wits to embroil herunderstanding.  Mary! can't you get her to see the stuff he is made of?''If she cannot do that for herself, no persuasion of mine will makeher,' said Mary.'No! you do not half appreciate him either!  No one does!  And yet youcould, if you tried, do something with her!  I see she does not thinkyou prejudiced.  You made an impression to-night.'Mary felt some consternation.  Could it depend on her?   She couldspeak naturally, and from her heart in defence of Louis when occasionserved; but something within her forbade the thought of doing so on asystem.  Was that something wrong!  She could not answer; but contentedherself with the womanly intuition that showed her that anything ofpersuasion in the present state of affairs would be ineffectual andunbecoming.Meantime, Clara had fled to her little room, to bid her childhoodfarewell in a flood of bitter tears.Exaggerated shame, past disdain of the foibles of others, the fancythat she was publicly disgraced and had forfeited Louis's good opinion,each thought renewed her sobs; but the true pang was the perceptionthat old times were passed for ever.  He might forgive, he would stillbe friend and cousin; but womanhood had broken on her, and shown thatperfect freedom was at an end.  Happy for her that she wept but for theparting from a playfellow!  Happy that her feelings were young andundeveloped, free from all the cruel permanence that earlier vanity orself-consciousness might have given; happy that it could be so freelywashed away!  When she had spent her sobs, she could resolve to be wiseand steady, so as to be a fit governess to his children; and the tearsflowed at the notion of being so distant and respectful to hislordship.  But what stories she could tell them of his boyhood!  And inthe midst of--'Now, my dears, I will tell you about your papa when hewas a little boy,' she fell asleep.That party was a thing to be remembered with tingling cheeks for life,and Clara dreaded her next meeting with Louis; but the days passed onwithout his coming to the Terrace, and the terror began to wear off,especially as she did not find that any one else remembered heroutbreak.  Mary guarded against any unfavourable impression by a fewsimple words to Isabel and Miss King as to the brotherly terms that hadhitherto prevailed, and poor Clara's subsequent distress. Clara came infor some of the bright tints in which her brother was viewed at theHouse Beautiful; Walter was very fond of her, and she had been drawninto a friendship for Virginia, cemented in the course of long walks,when the schoolroom party always begged for Mr. and Miss Dynevor,because no one else could keep Walter from disturbing Louisa's nervesby teasing her pony or sliding on dubious ice.As Mrs. Ponsonby often joined in Lady Conway's drive, Mary and Isabelwere generally among the walkers; and Mary was considered by Louisa asan inestimable pony-leader, and an inexhaustible magazine of storiesabout sharks, earthquakes, llamas, and icebergs.James and Miss Conway generally had either book or principle todiscuss, and were usually to be found somewhat in the rear, either withor without Miss King.  One day, however, James gave notice that heshould not be at their service that afternoon; and as soon as Walter'slessons had been despatched, he set out with rapid steps forOrmersfield Park, clenching his teeth together every now and then withhis determinate resolution that he would make Louis know his own mind,and would 'stand no nonsense.''Ah!  James, good morning,' said the Earl, as he presented himself inthe study.  'You will find Louis in his room.  I wish you would makehim come out with you.  He is working harder than is good for him.'He spoke of his son far differently from former times; but Jem onlyreturned a judiciously intoned 'Poor fellow.'Lord Ormersfield looked at him anxiously, and, hesitating, said, 'Youdo not think him out of spirits?''Oh, he carries it off very well.  I know no one with so strong a senseof duty,' replied Jem, never compassionate to the father.Again the Earl paused, then said, 'He may probably speak moreunreservedly to you than to me.''He shuns the topic.  He says there is no use in aggravating thefeelings by discussion.  He would fain submit in heart as well as inwill.'Lord Ormersfield sighed, but did not appear disposed to say more; and,charitably hoping that a dagger had been implanted in him, Jem ranup-stairs, and found Louis sitting writing at a table, which looked asif Mary had never been near it.'Jem!  That's right!  I've not seen you this age.''What are you about?''I wanted particularly some one to listen.  It is an essay on thePolice--''Is this earnest?''Sober earnest.  Sir Miles and all that set are anxious to bring thematter forward, and my father has been getting it up, as he doeswhatever he may have to speak upon.  His eyes are rather failing forcandle-light work, so I have been helping him in the evening, till itstruck me that it was a curious subject to trace in history,--theCensors, the attempts in Germany and Spain, to supply the defectivelaw, the Spanish and Italian dread of justice.  I became enamoured ofthe notion, and when I have thrown all the hints together, I shall tryto take in my father by reading them to him as an article in theQuarterly.''Oh, very well. If your soul is there, that is an end of the matter.''Of what matter?''Things cannot run on in this way.  It is not a thing to lay upon me togo on working in your cause with her when you will not stir a step inyour own behalf.''I am very much obliged to you, but I never asked you to work in mycause.  I beg your pardon, Jem, don't fly into a Welsh explosion.  Noone ever meant more kindly and generously--' He checked himself inamaze at the demonstration he had elicited; but, as it was notaccompanied with words, he continued, 'No one can be more grateful toyou than I; but, as far as I can see, there is nothing for it but to bethankful that no more harm has been done, and to let the matter drop;'and he dropped his hand with just so much despondency as to make Jemthink him worth storming at, instead of giving him up; and he went overthe old ground of Louis being incapable of true passion and unworthy ofsuch a being if he could yield her without an effort, merely for thesake of peace.'I say, Jem,' said Louis, quietly, 'all this was bad enough on neutralground; it is mere treason under my father's own roof, and I will haveno more of it.''Then,' cried James, with a strange light in his eyes, 'you henceforthrenounce all hopes--all pretensions?''I never had either hope or pretension.  I do not cease to think her,as I always did, the loveliest creature I ever beheld.  I cannot helpthat; and the state I fell into after being with her on Tuesday,convinced me that it is safest to stay here and fill up time andthought as best I may.''For once, Fitzjocelyn,' said James, with a gravity not natural to him,'I think better of your father than you do.  I would neither treat himas so tyrannical nor so prejudiced as your conduct supposes him.''How?  He is as kind as possible.  We never had so much in common.''Yes.  Your submission so far, and the united testimony of the Terrace,will soften him.  Show your true sentiments.  A little steadiness andperseverance, and you will prevail.''Don't make me feverish, Jem.'A summons to Lord Fitzjocelyn to come down to a visitor in the librarycut short the discussion, and James took leave at once, neither cousinwishing to resume the conversation.The darts had not been injudiciously aimed.  The father and son wereboth rendered uneasy.  They had hitherto been unusually comfortabletogether, and though the life was unexciting, Louis's desire to beuseful to his father, and the pressing need of working for his degree,kept his mind fairly occupied.  Though wistful looks might sometimes beturned along the Northwold road, when he sallied forth in the twilightfor his constitutional walk, he did not analyse which number of theTerrace was the magnet, and he avoided testing to the utmost the powersof his foot.  The affection and solicitude shown for him at homeclaimed a full return; nor had James been greatly mistaken in ascribingsomething to the facility of nature that yielded to force of character.But Jem had stirred up much that Louis would have been contented toleave dormant; and the hope that he had striven to excite came almostteazingly to interfere with the passive acquiescence of an indolentwill.  Perturbed and doubtful, he was going to seek counsel as usual ofthe open air, as soon as the visitor was gone, but his father followedhim into the hall, asking whither he was going.'I do not know.  I had been thinking of trying whether I can get as faras Marksedge.'Marksedge would be fatal to the ankle, solitude to the spirits, thoughtthe Earl; and he at once declared his intention of walking with his sonas far as he should let him go.Louis was half vexed, half flattered, and they proceeded in silence,till conscious of being ruffled, and afraid of being ungracious, hemade a remark on the farm that they were approaching, and learnt inreturn that the lease was nearly out, the tenant did not want arenewal, and that Richardson intended to advertise.He breathed a wish that it were in their own hands, and this led to astatement of the condition of affairs, the same to which a year beforehe had been wilfully deaf, and to which he now attended chiefly for thesake of gratifying his father, though he better understood whatdepended on it.  At least, it was making the Earl insensible to thespace they were traversing, and the black outlines of Marksedge wererising on him before he was aware.  Then he would have turned, butLouis pleaded that having come so far, he should be glad to speak toMadison's grandfather, and one or two other old people, and heprevailed.Lord Ormersfield was not prepared for the real aspect of the hamlet.'Richardson always declared that the cottages were kept in repair,' hesaid.'Richardson never sees them.  He trusts to Reeves.''The people might do something themselves to keep the place decent.''They might; but they lose heart out of sight of respectability.  Iwill just knock at this door--I will not detain you a moment.'The dark smoky room, damp, ill-paved floor, and cracked walls producedtheir effect; and the name and voice of the inmate did more. LordOrmersfield recognised a man who had once worked in the garden, andcame forward and spoke, astonished and shocked to find him prematurelyold.  The story was soon told; there had been a seasoning fever as awelcome to the half-reclaimed moorland; ague and typhus were frequentvisitors, and disabling rheumatism a more permanent companion tolabourers exhausted by long wet walks in addition to the daily toil.At an age less than that of the Earl himself, he beheld a bowed andbroken cripple.Fitzjocelyn perceived his victory, and forebore to press it toohastily, lest he should hurt his father's feelings; and walked onsilently, thinking how glad Mary would be to hear of this expedition,and what a pity it was that the unlucky passage of last August shouldhave interfered with their comfortable friendship.  At last the Earlbroke silence by saying, 'It is very unfortunate;' and Louis echoed,'Very.''My poor Uncle Dynevor!  He was, without exception, the mostwrong-headed person I ever came in contact with, yet so excessivelyplausible and eager that he carried my poor father entirely along withhim.  Louis! nothing is so ruinous as to surrender the judgment.'Fully assenting, Louis wondered whether Marksedge would serve nopurpose save the elucidation of this truism, and presently anotherensued.'Mischief is sooner done than repaired.  As I have been allowing you,there has never been ready money at command.''I thought there were no more mortgages to be paid off.  The rents ofthe Fitzjocelyn estate and the houses in the lower town must come tosomething.'He was then told how these, with his mother's fortune, had been setapart to form a fund for his establishment, and for the first time hewas shown the object of arrangements against which he had often inheart rebelled.  His first impulse was to exclaim that it was a greatpity, and that he could not bear that his father should have deniedhimself on his account.'Do you think these things are sacrifices to me?' said the Earl.  'Myhabits were formed long ago.''Mine have been formed on yours,' said Louis.  'I should be encumberedby such an income as you propose unless you would let me lay it out inmaking work for the men and improving the estate, and that I had ratheryou undertook, for I should be certain to do something preposterous,and then be sorry.''Mrs. Ponsonby judged rightly.  It was her very advice.''Then!' cried Louis, as if the deed were done.'You would not find the income too large in the event of your marriage.''A most unlikely event!'His father glanced towards him. If there had been a symptom ofunhappiness, relenting was near, but it so chanced that Marksedge wasreigning supreme, and he was chiefly concerned to set aside thesupposition as an obstacle to his views.  The same notion as JamesFrost's occurred to the Earl, that it could not be a tenaciouscharacter which could so easily set aside an attachment apparently sofervent, but the resignation was too much in accordance with hisdesires to render him otherwise than gratified, and he listened withcomplacency to Louis's plans.  Nothing was fixed, but there was anunderstanding that all should have due consideration.This settled, Louis's mind recurred to the hint which his father hadthrown out, and he wondered whether it meant that the presentcompliance might be further stretched, but he thought it more likely tobe merely a reference to ordinary contingencies.  Things were far toocomfortable between him and his father to be disturbed by discussion,and he might ultimately succeed better by submitting, and leaving factsand candour to remove prejudice.To forget perplexity in the amusement of a mystification, he broughtdown his essay, concealing it ingeniously within a review flanked byblue-books, and, when Lord Ormersfield was taking out a pair ofspectacles with the reluctance of a man not yet accustomed to them, heasked him if he would like to hear an article on the Police question.At first the Earl showed signs of nodding, and said there was nothingto the purpose in all the historical curiosities at the outset, so thatLouis, alarmed lest he should absolutely drop asleep, skipped all hisfavourite passages, and came at once to the results of the recentinquiries.  The Earl was roused.  Who could have learnt those facts?That was telling--well put, but how did he get hold of it. The verything he had said himself--What Quarterly was it?  Surely the Christmasnumber was not out.  Hitherto Louis had kept his countenance and voice,but in an hiatus, where he was trying to extemporize, his father cameto look over his shoulder to see what ailed the book, and, glancingupwards with a merry debonnaire face, he made a gesture as if convicted.'Do you mean that this is your own composition?''I beg your pardon for the pious fraud!''It is very good!  Excellently done!' said Lord Ormersfield.  'Thereare redundancies--much to betray an unpractised hand--but--stay, let mehear the rest--' Very differently did he listen now, broad awake,attacking the logic of every third sentence, or else double shotting itwith some ponderous word, and shaking his head at Utopian views ofcrime to be dried up at the fountain head.  Next, he must hear thebeginning, and ruthlessly picked it to pieces, demolishing all theVehme Gericht and Santissima Hermandad as irrelevant, and, when he hadmade Louis ashamed and vexed with the whole production, astonishing himby declaring that it would tell, and advising him to copy it out fairwith these little alterations.These little alterations would, as he was well aware, evaporate allthe spirit, and though glad to have pleased his father, hisperseverance quailed before the task; but he said no more than thankyou.  The next day, before he had settled to anything, Lord Ormersfieldcame to his room, saying, 'You will be engaged with your more importantstudies for the next few hours.  Can you spare the paper you read to melast night?''I can spare it better than you can read it, I fear,' said Louis,producing a mass of blotted MS in all his varieties of penmanship, andfeeling a sort of despair at the prospect of being brought to book onall his details.His father carried it off, and they did not meet again till late in theday, when the first thing Louis heard was, 'I thought it worth while tohave another opinion on your manuscript before re-writing it.  I triedto read it to Mrs. Ponsonby, but we were interrupted, and I left itwith her.'Presently after.  'I have made an engagement for you.  Lady Conwaywishes that you should go to luncheon with her to-morrow.  I believeshe wants to consult you about some birth-day celebration.'Louis was much surprised, and somewhat entertained.'When will you have the carriage?' pursued the Earl.'Will not you come?''No, I am not wanted.  In fact, I do not see how you can be required,but anything will serve as an excuse.  In justice, however, I shouldadd that our friends at the Terrace are disposed to think well of theyounger part of the family.'Except for the cold constraint of the tone, Louis could have thoughtmuch ground gained, but he was sure that his holiday would be damped byknowing that it was conceded at the cost of much distress anduneasiness.Going to Northwold early enough for a call at No. 5, he was greeted byMrs. Frost with, 'My dear! what have you been about?  I never saw yourfather so much pleased in his life!  He came in on purpose to tell me,and I thought it exceedingly kind.  So you took him in completely.What an impudent rogue you always were!''I never meant it to go beyond the study.  I was obliged to write itdown in self-defence, that I might know what he was talking of.''I believe he expects you to be even with Sydney Calcott after all. Itis really very clever.  Where did you get all those funny stories?''What! you have gone and read it!''Ah, ha!  Mrs. Ponsonby gave us a pretty little literary soiree. Don'tbe too proud, it was only ourselves, except that Mary brought in MissConway.  Jem tried to read it, but after he had made that SpanishSociety into 'Hammer men dead,' Mary got it away from him, and readthrough as if it had been in print.''What an infliction!''It is very disrespectful to think us so frivolous.  We only wished allreviews were as entertaining.''It is too bad, when I only wanted to mystify my father.''It serves you right for playing tricks.  What have you been doing tohim, Louis?  You will turn him into a doting father before long.''What have you done with Clara?''She goes every day to read Italian with Miss Conway, and the governessis so kind as to give her drawing lessons.  She is learning far morethan at school, and they are so kind!  I should hardly know how toaccept it, but Jem does not object, and he is really very useful there,spends a great deal of time on the boy, and is teaching the youngladies Latin.''They are leaving you lonely in the holidays!  You ought to come toOrmersfield, your nephews would take better care of you.''Ah! I have my Marys.  If I were only better satisfied about the dearold one.  She is far less well than when she came.''Indeed!  Is Mary uneasy?''She says nothing, but you know how her eye is always on her, and shenever seems to have her out of her thoughts.  I am afraid they areworried about Lima.  From what Oliver says, I fear Mr. Ponsonby goes onworse than ever without either his family or his appointment to be arestraint.''I hope they do not know all!  Mary would not believe it, that is onecomfort!''Ah, Louis! there are things that the heart will not believe, but whichcut it deeply!  However, if that could be any comfort to them, hewishes them to spare nothing here.  He tells them they may live at therate of five thousand pounds a-year, poor dears.  Indeed, he and Oliverare in such glory over their Equatorial steam navigation, that I expectnext to hear of a crash.''You don't look as if it would be a very dreadful sound.''If it would only bring my poor Oliver back to me!''Yes--nothing would make Jem so civil to him as his coming floated inon a plank, wet through, with a little bundle in one hand and a parrotin the other.'Mrs. Frost gave one of her tender laughs, and filled up the picture.'Jane would open the door, Jane would know Master Oliver's black eyesin a moment--'No, no.  I must see him first!  If he once looked up Icould not miss him, whatever colour he may have turned.  I wonderwhether he would know me!''Don't you know that you grow handsomer every year, Aunt Kitty?''Don't flatter, sir.''Well, I most go to my aunt.'He tarried to hear the welcome recital of all the kind deeds of thehouse of Conway.  He presently found Lady Conway awaiting him in thedrawing-room, and was greeted with great joy.  'That is well!  I hopedto work on your father by telling him I did not approve of young mencarrying industry too far--''That is not my habit.''Then it is your excuse for avoiding troublesome relations!  No, not aword!  I know nothing about the secret that occupied Isabel at Mrs.Ponsonby's select party.  But I really wanted you.  You are more aufait as to the society here than the Ponsonbys and Dynevors.  Ah! whendoes that come off?''What is to come off?''Miss Ponsonby and Mr. Dynevor.  What a good creature he is!''I cannot see much likelihood of it, but you are more on the scene ofaction.''She could do much better, with such expectations, but on his account Icould not be sorry.  It is shocking to think of that nice young sisterbeing a governess.  I think it a duty to give her every advantage thatmay tend to form her.  With her connexions and education, I can have noobjection to her as a companion to your cousins, and with a fewadvantages, though she will never be handsome, she might marry well.They are a most interesting family. Isabel and I are most anxious to doall in our power for them.''Clara is obliged,' said Louis, with undetected irony, but secretwonder at the dexterity with which the patronage must have beenadministered so as not to have made the interesting family fly off at atangent.Isabel made her appearance in her almost constant morning dress of softdove-coloured merino entirely unadorned, and looking more like a maidenin a romance than ever.  She had just left Adeline standing on thesteps of a stone cross, exhorting the Provencals to arm against adescent of Moorish corsairs, and she held out her hand to Fitzjocelynmuch as Adeline did, when the fantastic Viscount professed hisintention of flying instead of fighting, and wanted her to sit behindhim on his courser.Lady Conway pronounced her council complete, and propounded the fetewhich she wished to give on the 12th of January in honour of Louisa'sbirthday.  Isabel took up a pencil, and was lost in sketching waysidecrosses, and vessels with lateen sails, only throwing in a word or twohere and there when necessary.  Dancing was still, Lady Conway feared,out of the question with Fitzjocelyn.'And always will be, I suspect.  So much for my bargain with Clara todance with her at her first ball!''You like dancing?' exclaimed Isabel, rejoiced to find anotherresemblance to the fantastic Viscount.'Last year's Yeomanry ball was the best fun in the world!''There, Isabel,' said Lady Conway, 'you ought to be gratified to find ayoung man candid enough to allow that he likes it!  But since thatcannot be, I must find some other plan--''What cannot be?' exclaimed Louis.  'You don't mean to omit thedancing--''It could not be enjoyed without you.  Your cousins and friends couldnot bear to see you sitting down--'Isabel's lips were compressed, and the foam of her waves laughedscornfully under her pencil.'They must get accustomed to the melancholy spectacle,' said Louis. 'Ido not mean to intermit the Yeomanry ball, if it take place while I amat home.  The chaperons are the best company, after all. Reconsider it,my dear aunt, or you will keep me from coming at all.'Lady Conway was only considering of tableaux, and Louis took fire atthe notion: he already beheld Waverley in his beloved Yeomanry suit,Isabel as Flora, Clara as Davie Gellatley--the character she would mostappreciate.  Isabel roused herself to say that tableaux were very dullwork to all save the actors, and soon were mere weariness to them.  Herstepmother told her she had once been of a different mind, when she hadbeen Isabel Bruce, kneeling in her cell, the ring before her.  'I wasyoung enough then to think myself Isabel,' was her answer, and she drewthe more diligently because Fitzjocelyn could not restrain aninterjection, and a look which meant, 'What an Isabel she must havebeen!'She sat passive while Lady Conway and Louis decked up a scene for FloraMacIvor; but presently it appeared that the Waverley of the piece wasto be, according to Louis, not the proper owner of the Yeomanryuniform, but James Frost.  His aunt exclaimed, and the rehearsals werestrong temptation; but he made answer, 'No--you must not reckon on me:my father would not like it.'The manful childishness, the childish manfulness of such a reply, wereimpenetrable.  If his two-and-twenty years did not make him ashamed ofsaying so, nothing else could, and it covered a good deal. He knew thathis father's fastidious pride would dislike his making a spectacle ofhimself, and thought that it would be presuming unkindly on to-day'sliberty to involve himself in what would necessitate terms moreintimate than were desired.The luncheon silenced the consultation, which was to be a great secretfrom the children; but afterwards, when it was resumed, with theaddition of James Frost, Fitzjocelyn was vexed to find the tableauxdiscarded; not avowedly because he excluded himself from a share, butbecause the style of people might not understand them. Theentertainment was to be a Christmas-tree--not so hackneyed a spectaclein the year 1848 as in 1857--and Louis launched into a world ofcouplets for mottoes.  Next came the question of guests, when LadyConway read out names from the card-basket, and Fitzjocelyn was infavour of everybody, till Jem, after many counter-statements, assuredLady Conway that he was trying to fill her rooms with the mostintolerable people in the world.'My aunt said she wanted to give pleasure.''Ah! there's nothing so inconvenient to one's friends as good nature.Who cares for what is shared indiscriminately?''I don't think I can trust Fitzjocelyn with my visiting-list just yet,'said Lady Conway.  'You are too far above to be sensible of the gradesbeneath, with your place made for you.''Not at all,' said Louis.  'Northwold tea-parties were my earliest,most natural dissipation; and I spoke for these good people for my ownpersonal gratification.''Nay, I can't consent to your deluding Lady Conway into Mrs. Walby.''If there be any one you wish me to ask, my dear Fitzjocelyn--' beganLady Conway.'Oh no, thank you; Jem is quite right.  I might have been playing onyour unguarded innocence; but I am the worst person in the world toconsult; for all the county and all the town are so kind to me, that Idon't know whom I could leave out.  Now, the Pendragon there will helpyou to the degree of gentility that may safely be set to consorttogether.''What an unkind fling!' thought Isabel.Louis took leave, exclaiming to himself on the stairs, 'There! ifcomporting oneself like a donkey before the object be a token, I'vedone it effectually.  Didn't I know the exclusiveness of the woman?Yet, how could I help saying a word for the poor little Walbys? and,after all, if they were there, no one would speak to them but AuntKitty and I.  And Isabel, I am sure she scorned the fastidiousnonsense; I saw it in her eye and lip.'After a quarter of an hour spent in hearing her praises from MissFaithfull, he betook himself to Mrs. Ponsonby's, not quite withoutembarrassment, for he had not been alone with the mother and daughtersince August.'I am glad you did not come before,' said Mary, heartily; 'I have justdone:' and she returned to her writing-table, while her mother wassaying,'We like it very much.''You have not been copying that wretched concern!' exclaimed Louis.'Why, Mary, you must have been at it all night.  It is a week's work.''Copying is not composing,' said Mary.'But you have mended it, made it consecutive!  If I had guessed that myfather meant to trouble any one with it!''If you take pains with it, it may be very valuable,' said Mrs.Ponsonby.  'We have marked a few things that you had better revisebefore it goes to Oakstead.''Goes to Oakstead!' said Louis, faintly.'Your father talks of sending it, to see if Sir Miles does not think itmight tell well in one of the Reviews.''I hope not.  I should lose all my faith in anonymous criticism, ifthey admitted such a crude undergraduate's omnium gatherum!  Besides,what an immense task to make it presentable!''Is that the root of your humility?''Possibly.  But for very shame I must doctor it, if Mary has wasted somuch time over it.  It does not look so bad in your hand!''It struck me whether you had rendered this Spanish story right.''Of course not.  I never stuck to my dictionary.'A sound dose of criticism ensued, tempered by repetitions of hisfather's pleasure, and next came some sympathy and discussion about thefarm and Marksedge, in which the ladies took their usual earnest part,and Mary was as happy as ever in hearing of his progress.  He said noword of their neighbours; but he could not help colouring when Marysaid, as he wished her good-bye, 'We like the party in the HouseBeautiful so much!  Miss Conway is such an acquisition to me! and theyare doing all you could ever have wished for Clara.'Mary was glad that she had said it.  Louis was not so glad.  He thoughtit must have been an effort, then derided his vanity for thesupposition.CHAPTER XVI.THE FRUIT OF THE CHRISTMAS-TREEAge, twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers,And call a train of laughing hours;And bid them dance, and bid them sing:And thou, too, mingle in the ring.WORDSWORTHThe 12th of January was the last day before James and Louis meant toreturn to Oxford, Jem taking Clara on from thence to school.  It was tobe the farewell to Christmas--one much enjoyed in Dynevor Terrace.Fitzjocelyn's absence was almost a relief to Clara; she could not makeup her mind to see him till she could hope their last encounter hadbeen forgotten; and in the mean time, her anticipations were fixed onthe great 12th.  She was aware of what the entertainment would consist,but was in honour bound to conceal her knowledge from Virginia andLouisa, who on their side affected great excitement and curiosity, andmade every ostentation of guessing and peeping.  Gifts were smuggledinto the house from every quarter--some to take their chance, somedirected with mottoes droll or affectionate.  Clara prepared a fewtrifles, in which she showed that school had done something for herfingers, and committed her little parcels to her brother's care; andMiss Mercy was the happiest of all, continually knocking at the lockeddoor of the back drawing-room with gilded fir cones, painted banners,or moss birds'-nests, from Miss Salome.Miss King and Isabel had undertaken the main business.  When rousedfrom her pensive stillness, Isabel could be very eager, active, andanimated; and she worked with the exhilaration that she could freelyenjoy when unrestrained by perceiving that she was wanted to produce aneffect.  What woman's height and hand could not perform fell to theshare of James, who, with his step-ladder and dexterous hands, wasinvaluable.  Merrily, merrily did the three work, laughing over theirsuspended bonbons, their droll contrivances, or predicting theadaptations of their gifts; and more and more gay was the laugh, thetutor more piquant, the governess more keen and clever, the young ladymore vivacious, as the twilight darkened, and the tree became moreladen, and the streamers and glass balls produced a more brillianteffect.Proudly, when the task was accomplished, did they contemplate theirwork, and predict the aspect of their tinsel and frippery when dulylighted up.  Then, as they dispersed to dress, James ran home, andhastily tapped at his sister's door.'What is the matter?' she cried.  'Have the tassels come off my purse?''Nothing of the kind, but--' he came quite in, and looked roundrestlessly, then hastily said, 'You gave me nothing for Miss Conway.''I wished it very much,' said Clara, 'but I could not bear to doanything trumpery for her.  Oh, if one could give her anything worthhaving!''Clara, I had thought--but I did not know if you would like to partwith it--''I had thought of it too,' said Clara; 'but I thought you would notlike it to be given away.'Pulling out a drawer, she opened an odd little box of queercuriosities, whence she took a case containing an exquisite ivorycarving, a copy of the 'Madonna della Sedia,' so fine that a magnifieralone could fully reveal the delicacy and accuracy of the features andexpression.  It was mounted as a bracelet clasp, and was a remnant ofpoor Mr. Dynevor's treasures.  It had been given to Mrs. Henry Frost,and had descended to her daughter.'Should you be willing?' wistfully asked James.'That I should!  I have longed to give her what she would really carefor.  She has been so very kind--and her kindness is so very sweet inits graciousness!  I shall always be the happier for the very thinkingof it.''I am glad--' began Jem, warmly; but, breaking off, he added--'Thiswould make us all more comfortable.  It would lessen the weight ofobligation, and that would be satisfactory to you.''I don't know.  I like people to be so kind, that I can't feel as if Iwould pay them off, but as if I could do nothing but love them.''You did not imagine that I rate this as repayment!''Oh! no, no!''No! it is rather that nothing can be too precious--' thenpausing--'You are sure you are willing, Clary?''Only too glad.  I like it to be something valuable to us as well as initself.  If I only had a bit of black velvet, I could set it up.'In ten minutes, Jem had speeded to a shop and back again, and stood byas Clara stitched the clasp to the ribbon velvet; while there was anamicable dispute, he insisting that the envelope should bear only theinitials of the true donor, and she maintaining that 'he gave the blackvelvet.'  She had her way, and wrote, 'From her grateful C. F. D. andJ. R. F. D.;' and as James took the little packet, he thanked her withan affectionate kiss--a thing so unprecedented at an irregular hour,that Clara's heart leapt up, and she felt rewarded for any semblance ofsacrifice.He told his grandmother that he had agreed with his sister that theycould do no otherwise than present the ivory clasp; and Mrs. Frost, whohad no specially tender associations with it, was satisfied to findthat they had anything worth offering on equal terms.She was to be of the party, and setting forth, they, found the HouseBeautiful upside down--even the Faithfull parlour devoted to shawls andbonnets, and the two good old sisters in the drawing-room; Miss Salome,under the protection of little Louisa, in an easy chair, opposite thefolding doors.  Small children were clustered in shy groups round theirrespective keepers.  Lady Conway was receiving her guests with thesmile so engaging at first sight, Isabel moving from one to the otherwith stately grace and courtesy, Virginia watching for Clara, and bothbecoming merged in a mass of white skirts and glossy heads, occupying awide area.  Mrs. Frost was rapturously surrounded by half-a-dozen youngmen, Sydney Calcott foremost, former pupils enchanted to see her, andkeeping possession of her all the rest of the evening.  She was adangerous person to invite, for the Northwold youth had no eyes but forher.The children were presently taken down to tea in the dining-room byMiss King and Miss Mercy; and presently a chorus of little voices andpeals of laughter broke out, confirming the fact, whispered by Delafordto his lady, that Lord Fitzjocelyn had arrived, and had joined thedownstairs party.While coffee went round in the drawing-room, Isabel glided out toperform the lighting process.'Oh, Mr. Dynevor!' she exclaimed, finding him at her side, 'I did notmean to call you away.''Mere unreason to think of the performance alone,' said James, settingup his trusty ladder.  'What would become of that black lace?''Thank you, it may be safer and quicker.''So far the evening is most successful,' said Jem, lighting above asshe lighted below.'That it is!  I like Northwold better than any place I have been insince I left Thornton Conway.  There is so much more heartiness andfriendliness here than in ordinary society.'I think Fitzjocelyn's open sympathies have conduced--'Isabel laughed, and he checked himself, disconcerted.'I beg your pardon,' she said; 'I was amused at the force of habit. IfI were to say the Terrace chimneys did not smoke, you would say it wasLord Fitzjocelyn's doing.''Do not bid me do otherwise than keep him in mind.'Down fell the highest candle: the hot wax dropping on Isabel's armcaused her to exclaim, bringing Jem down in horror, crying, 'I havehurt you! you are burnt!''Oh no, only startled.  There is no harm done, you see,' as she crackedaway the cooled wax--'not even a mark to remind me of this happyChristmas.''And it has been a happy Christmas to you,' he said, remounting.'Most happy.  Nothing has been so peaceful or satisfactory in mywandering life.''Shall I find you here at Easter?''I fear not.  Mamma likes to be in London early; but perhaps she mayleave the school-room party here, as Louisa is gaining so much ground,and that would be a pledge of our return.''Too much joy,' said James, almost inaudibly.'I hope Walter may spend his holidays here,' she pursued.  'It is agreat thing for him to be with any one who can put a few right notionsinto his head.'Jem abstained from, as usual, proposing Fitzjocelyn for his example,but only said that Walter was very susceptible of good impressions.'And most heartily we thank you for all you have done for him,' saidIsabel, doubting whether Walter's mother appreciated the full extent ofit; 'indeed, we have all a great deal to thank you for.  I hope mysisters and I may be the better all our lives for the helps andexplanations you have given to us.  Is that the last candle?  Howbeautiful!  We must open.''Miss Conway--''Yes'--she paused with her hand on the key.'No, no--do not wait,' taking the key himself.  'Yet--yes, I must--Imust thank you for such words--''My words?' said Isabel, smiling.  'For thanking you, or being happyhere?''Both! both!  Those words will be my never-failing charm.  You littleguess how I shall live on the remembrance.  Oh, if I could only conveyto you what feelings you have excited--'The words broke from him as if beyond his control, and under thepressing need of not wasting the tapers, he instinctively unlocked thedoor as he spoke, and cut himself short by turning the handle, perhapswithout knowing what he was about.Instantly Lady Conway and Miss King each pushed a folding leaf, Isabeland James drew back on either side, and the spectators beheld the tallglistening evergreen, illuminated with countless little spires oflight, glancing out among the dark leaves, and reflected from the giltfir-cones, glass balls, and brilliant toys.'Sister! sister!' cried Miss Mercy, standing by Miss Faithfull's chair,in the rear of the throng, and seizing her hand in ecstasy; 'it is likea dream! like what we have read of!  Oh, the dear little children!  Sovery kind of Lady Conway!  Could you have imagined--?' She quite gasped.'It is very pretty, but it was a nicer Christmas-tree last year at LadyRunnymede's,' said Louisa, with the air of a critic.  'There we hadcoloured lamps.''Little fastidious puss!' said Louis, 'I thought you keeping in thebackground out of politeness; but I see you are only blasee withChristmas-trees.  I pity you!  I could no more be critical at such amoment than I could analyse the jewels in Aladdin's cave.''Oh, if you and Miss Faithfull talk, Cousin Fitzjocelyn, you will makeit seem quite new.''You will deride the freshness of our simplicity,' said Louis, butpresently added, 'Miss Salome, have we not awakened to the enchantedland?  Did ever mortal tree bear stars of living flame?  Here arerealized the fabled apples of gold--nay, the fir-cones of Nineveh, thejewel-fruits of Eastern story, depend from the same bough. Yonder lampsshine by fairy spell.''Now, Cousin Fitzjocelyn, do you think I suppose you so silly--''Soft!  The Dryad of the Enchanted Bower advances.  Her floating robes,her holly crown, beseem her queenly charms.''As if you did not know that it is only Isabel!''Only!  May the word be forgiven to a sister!  Isabel!  The name isall-expressive.''She is looking even more lovely than usual,' said Miss Faithfull. 'Inever saw such a countenance.''She has a colour to-night,' added Miss Mercy, 'which does, as you say,make her handsomer than ever.  Dear! dear!  I hope she is not tired.  Iam so sorry I did not help her to light the tree!''I do not think it is fatigue,' said her sister.  'I hope it isanimation and enjoyment--all I have ever thought wanting to that sweetface.''You are as bad as my prosaic cousin,' said Louis, 'disenchanting themagic bower and the wood-nymph into fir, wax, and modern youngladyhood.''There, cousin, it is you who have called her a modern young lady.'Before Louisa had expressed her indignation, there was a call for her.'The Sovereign of the Bower beckons,' said Louis.  'Favoured damsel,know how to deserve her smiles.  Fairy gifts remain not with theunworthy.'As he put her forward, some one made way for her.  It was Mary, and heblushed at perceiving that she must have heard all his rhodomontade.As if to make amends, he paused, and asked for Mrs. Ponsonby.'Much more comfortable to-night, thank you;' and the pleasant, honestlook of her friendly eyes relieved him by not reproaching him.'I wish she were here.  It is a prettier, more visionary sight than Icould have conceived.''I wish she could see it; but she feared the crowd.  Many people in aroom seem to stifle her.  Is Lord Ormersfield here?''No, it would not be his element.  But imagine his having taken towalking with me!  I really think he will miss me.''Really?' said Mary, amused.'It is presumptuous; but he does not see well at night, and is notquite broken in to his spectacles.  Mary, I hope you will walk over tosee after him.  Nothing would be so good for him as walking you back,and staying to dinner with you.  Go right into the library; he would begreatly pleased.  Can't you make some book excuse?  And you have thecottages to see.  The people inaugurated the boilers with Christmaspuddings.''Mr. Holdsworth told us how pleased they were.  And the Norrises?''Mrs. Norris is delighted; she has found a woman to wash, and says itwill save her a maid.  The people can get milk now: I assure you theylook more wholesome already!  And Beecher has actually asked for twomore houses in emulation.  And Richardson found himself turned over tome!''Oh, that's right.''I've been at the plans all the afternoon.  I see how to contrive thefireplace in the back room, that we could not have in the first set,and make them cheaper, too.  My father has really made a point of thatold decrepit Hailes being moved from Marksedge; and Mary, he, andRichardson mean Inglewood to be made over to me for good.  I am to putin a bailiff, and do as I can with it--have the profits or bear thelosses.  I think I have an idea--'In spite of her willingness to hear the idea, Mary could not helpasking, 'Have you sent off the Police article?''Hush, Mary; it is my prime object to have it well forgotten.''Oh! did not Sir Miles like it?''He said it wanted liveliness and anecdote.  So the SantissimaHermandad, and all the extraneous history, were sent to him; and thenhe was well content, and only wanted me to leave out all the Christianchivalry--all I cared to say--''You don't mean not to finish?  Your father was so pleased, Isabel somuch struck!  It is a pity--''No, no; you may forgive me, Mary--it is not pure laziness.  It wasmere rubbish, without the point, which was too strong for the twopoliticians; rubbish, any way.  Don't tell me to go on with it; it wasa mere trial, much better let it die away.  I really have no time; if Idon't mind my own business, I shall be a plucked gosling; and thatwould go to his, lordship's heart.  Besides, I must get these plansdone.  Do you remember where we got the fire-bricks for the ovens?'Mary was answering, when Walter came bursting through the crowd. 'Whereis he?  Fitzjocelyn, it is your turn.''Here is a curious specimen for our great naturalist,' said Mrs. Frost,a glow in her cheeks, and her voice all stifled mirth and mischief.It was a large nest of moss and horsehair, partly concealed under thelower branches, and containing two huge eggs streaked and spotted withazure and vermilion, and a purple and yellow feather, labelled,'Dropped by the parent animal in her flight, on the discovery of thenest by the crew of H.M.S. Flying Dutchman.  North Greenland, April1st, 1847.  Qu.?  Female of Equus Pegasus.  Respectfully dedicated tothe Right Honourable Viscount Fitzjocelyn.''A fine specimen,' said the Viscount at once, with the air of aconnoisseur, by no means taken by surprise.  'They are not veryuncommon; I found one myself about the same date in the justice-room. Idare say Mr. Calcott recollects the circumstance.''Oh, my dear fellow,' exclaimed Sydney, instead of his father; 'youneed not particularize.  You always were a discoverer in that line.''True,' said Louis, 'but this is unique.  North Greenland--ah! Ithought it was from a Frosty country.  Ha, Clara?''Not I; I know nothing of it,' cried Clara, in hurry and confusion, notyet able to be suspected of taking liberties with him.'No?' said Louis, turning about his acquisition; 'I thought I knew thefemale that laid these eggs.  The proper name is, I fancy, GlaciesDynevorensis--var. Catharina--perhaps--'Walter and Louisa had brought their mother to see the nest, the pointof which she comprehended as little as they; and not understanding howmuch amusement was betokened by her nephew's gravity, she protestedthat none of her party had devised it, nor even been privy to it, andthat Mr. Dynevor must bear the blame, but he was very busy detachingthe prizes from the tree, and hastily denied any concern with it.  AuntCatharine was obliged to console Lady Conway, and enchant Louis byowning herself the sole culprit, with no aid but Miss Mercy's.Together they had disposed the nest in its right locality, as soon asthe Earl's absence was secure.'I had not courage for it before him,' she laughed.  'As for thisfellow, I knew he would esteem it a compliment.''As a tribute to his imagination?' said Isabel, who, in her mood ofbenevolence, could be struck with the happy understanding between auntand nephew revealed by such a joke, so received.'It would be a curious research,' said Louis, 'whether more of thesenidifications result from over-imagination or the want of it.''Often from want of imagination, and no want of cowardice,' said Isabel.'That sort of nest has not illuminated eggs like these,' said Louis.'They are generally extremely full of gunpowder, and might be paintedwith a skull and crossbones.  I say, Clara, has Aunt Kitty consideredthe consequences?  She has sacrificed her ostrich eggs!  I can neverpart with these original productions of her genius.'He exhibited his mare's nest with his own gay bonhommie to all who werecurious, and presently, when every one's attention had been againrecalled to the wonders which Isabel was distributing, and he hadturned aside to dispose of his treasure, he heard a sound of soliloquyhalf aloud, 'I wonder whether she has it!' from Clara, who stood alittle apart.'What?' asked Louia.'My ivory clasp with the Madonna,' said Clara.  'Jem and I thought itthe only thing worthy of Miss Conway.''Hem!' said Louis; 'it is not your fault, Clara; but it would begraceful to learn to receive a favour.''A favour, but not a grand thing like this,' said Clara, showing abeautiful little case of working implements.'Hardly worth, even intrinsically, your mother's bracelet,' said Louis.'But I am not going to talk treason to the family doctrine, though itis very inconvenient to your friends.''Then you think we ought not to have done it?''That depends on what I can't decide.''What's that?''Whether you give it out of love or out of pride.''I think we gave it out of one, and excused it by the other.''Very satisfactory.  To reward you, here is something for you to do. Ishall never get at Aunt Kitty to-night.  I see the midshipman, youngBrewster, will not relinquish her; so will you or will she administerthis letter to the Lady of Eachalott?''You don't mean that is Tom Madison!' exclaimed Clara.  'Why, it islike copper-plate.  No more Fitsgoslings!''No, indeed!  Is he not a clever fellow?  He has just reached the stageof civilization that breaks out in dictionary words.  I have been, inreturn, telling him the story of the Irish schoolmaster who puzzled themagistrate's bench by a petition about a small cornuted animal, meaninga kid.  But I should think it would be very edifying to Charlotte tosee herself commemorated as the individual at the Terrace, and hisgrandfather as his aged relative.  He sends the old man ten shillingsthis time, for he is promoted.  Don't you think I may be proud of him?Is Mary gone home?  She must hear about him.'As he turned away in search of Mary, Clara felt a soft hand on hershoulder, and Isabel beckoned her to follow into the back drawing-room,where the tree was burnt out and deserted.'I may thank you,' said Isabel, in a low, sweet voice, pressing herhand.'And Jem,' said Clara; 'he thought of it first.''It is the most beautiful Christmas gift; but I do not like for you topart with it, my dear.''We both wished it, and grandmamma gave leave.  We longed for you tohave something we prized like this, for it belonged to my mamma.  It isJem's present too, for he went out and bought the black velvet.''Clasp it on for me, dear Clara.  There!' and Isabel kissed the fingerswhich obeyed.  'It shall never leave my arm.'Clara's face burnt with surprise and pleasure amounting toembarrassment, as Isabel expressed hopes of meeting again, and engagedher to write from school.  She looked for her brother to take his shareof thanks; but he was determinately doing his duty in cutting chickenand cake for those who desired supper, and he did not come in their wayagain till all the guests were gone, and good-night and good-bye wereto be said at once.Lady Conway was warm in expressing her hopes that Walter would enjoythe same advantages another holidays, and told Mr. Dynevor she shouldwrite to him.  But Jem made little answer, nothing like a promise.Clara thought he had become stiff from some unknown affront, perhapssome oppressive present, for he seemed to intend to include all theyoung ladies in one farewell bow.  But Isabel advanced withoutstretched hand and flushing cheek, and her murmured 'Thank you' andconfiding pressure drew from him such a grasp as could not easily beforgotten.Clara's heart was all the lighter because she was sure that Fitzjocelynhad forgiven, and, what was more, forgotten.  She had spoken naturallyto him once more, and was ready for anything now--even though they hadmissed all confidential discussions upon school.She gave Charlotte Tom Madison's letter.  The little maiden took it,and twirled it about rather superciliously.  'What business had myyoung Lord,' she thought, 'to fancy she cared for that poor fellow?Very likely he was improved, and she was glad of it, but she knew whatwas genteel now.  Yes, she would read it at once; there was no fearthat it would make her soft and foolish--she had got above that!'CHAPTER XVII.THE RIVALS.'Which king, Bezonian?'--Henry IV.Sir Roland of Provence remained in suspense whether to be a novice oran irrevocably pledged Hospitalier.  The latter was most probable; andwhen Adeline's feelings had been minutely analysed, Miss Conwaydiscovered that she had better not show her morning's work to hersisters.Clara and Louis pronounced Jem to be as savage as a bear all throughthe journey.  Clara declared it was revenge for having been civil andamiable all through the vacation; and Louis uttered a theatrical aside,that even that could not have been maintained if he had notoccasionally come to Ormersfield to relieve himself a little upon theirtwo lordships.Laugh as he might, Fitzjocelyn was much concerned and perplexed by hiscousin's ill-humour, when it appeared more permanent than could bepuffed off in a few ebullitions.  Attempts to penetrate the gloom madeit heavier, and Louis resolved to give it time to subside.  He waitedsome days before going near James, and when he next walked to hiscollege found him engaged with pupils.  He was himself very busy, andhad missed his cousin several times before he at length found him alone.'Why, Jem, old fellow, what are you about?  You've not been near myrooms this term.  Are you renouncing me in anticipation of my plucking?''You won't be plucked unless you go out of your senses for theoccasion.''No thanks to your advice and assistance if I am not.  But it wouldconduce to my equanimity, Jem, to know whether we are quarrelling, asin that case I should know how to demean myself.''I've no quarrel with you.  You have far more reason--But,' added Jem,catching himself up, 'don't you know I have no leisure for trifling?The Ordination is the second week in March.''The Ordination!''Ay--you know it!  My fellowship depends on it.''I never liked to contemplate it.'  He sat down and mused, while Jamescontinued his occupation.  Presently he said, 'Look here.  Sir MilesOakstead asked me if I had any clever Oxford friend to recommend.  Ifhe comes into office, he--''I'll be no great man's hanger-on.''This matter is not imminent.  You are barely four-and-twenty.  Wait ayear or two; even a few months would--''You have tried my forbearance often enough,' broke in James; 'myobject is--as you very well know--to maintain myself and mine withoutbeing liable to obnoxious patronage.  If you think I should disgracethe office, speak out!'Louis, without raising his eyes, only answered with a smile.'Then, what do you mean?  As to your notions of a vocation, ninety-nineout of a hundred are in my case.  I have been bred up to this--nothingelse is open--I mean to do my duty; and surely that is vocation--no onehas a right to object--''No one; I beg your pardon,' meekly said Louis, taking up his stick togo; but both knew it was only a feint, and James, whose vehemence wasexhausting itself, resumed, in an injured tone, 'What disturbs you?what is this scruple of yours!--you, who sometimes fancy you would havebeen a curate yourself!''I have just inclination enough to be able to perceive that you havenone.''And is every one to follow his bent?''This is not a step to be taken against the grain, even for the bestearthly motives.  Jem!  I only beg you to ask advice.  For the veryreason that you are irreproachable, you will never have it offered.''The present time, for instance?' said James, laughing as best he might.'That is nothing.  I have no faith in my own judgment, but, thinking asI do of the profession and of you, I cannot help believing that mydistaste for seeing you in it must be an instinct.''Give me your true opinion and its grounds candidly, knowing that Iwould not ask another man living.''Nor me, if I did not thrust it on you.''Now for it!  Let us hear your objection.''Simply this.  I do not see that anything impels you to take HolyOrders immediately, except your wish to be independent, and irrevocablyfixed before your uncle can come home.  This seems to me to have asavour of something inconsistent with what you profess.  It might befine anywhere else, but will it not bear being brought into the lightof the sanctuary?  No, I cannot like it.  I have no doubt many go upfor ordination far less fit than you, but--Jem, I wish you would not.If you would but wait a year!''No, Fitzjocelyn, my mind is made up.  I own that I might havepreferred another course, and Heaven knows it is not that I thinkmyself worthy of this; but I have been brought up to this, and I willnot waver.  It is marked out for me as plainly as your earldom for you,and I will do my duty in it as my appointed calling.  There lies mycourse of honest independence: you call it pride--see what those arewho are devoid of it: there lie my means of educating my sister,providing for my grandmother.  I can see no scruple that should determe.'Fitzjocelyn having said his say, it was his turn and his nature to betalked down.'In short,' concluded James, walking about the room, 'there is noalternative.  Waiting for a College living is bad enough, but nothingelse can make happiness even possible.''One would think you meant one sort of happiness,' said Louis, with acalm considering tone, and look of inquiry which James could not brook.'What else?' he cried.  'Fool and madman that I am to dwell on thehopeless--''Why should it be hopeless?--' began Louis.'Hush! you are the last person with whom I could discuss this subject,'he said, trying to be fierce, but with more sorrow than anger.  'I mustbear my burthen alone.  Believe me, I struggled hard. If you and I bedestined to clash, one comfort is, that even I could never quarrel withyou.''I have not the remotest idea of your meaning.''So much the better.  No, so much the worse.  You are not capable offeeling what I do for her, or you would have hated me long ago.  Do notstay here!  I do not know that I can quite bear the sight of you--Butdon't let me lose you, Louis.'James wrung the hand of his cousin; and no sooner was he alone, than hebegan to pace the room distractedly.'Poor Jem!' soliloquized Fitzjocelyn.  'At least, I am glad the troubleis love, not the Ordination.  But as to his meaning!  He gives me tounderstand that we are rivals--It is the most absurd thing I everknew--I declare I don't know whether he means Mary or Isabel.  Isuppose he would consider Mary's fortune a barrier--No, she is tooserene for his storms--worthy, most worthy--but she would hate to beworshipped in that wild way.  Besides, I am done for in that quarter.No clashing there--! Nay, the other it can never be--after all hisefforts to lash me up at Christmas.  Yet, he was much with her, he madeClara sacrifice the clasp to her.  Hm!  She is an embodied romance,deserving to be raved about; while for poor dear Mary, it would besimply ridiculous.  I wish I could guess--it is too absurd to doubt,and worse to ask; and, what's more, he would not stand it.  If I didbut know!  I'm not so far gone yet, but that I could leave the field tohim, if that would do him any good.  Heigh ho! it would be en regle tobegin to hate him, and be as jealous as Bluebeard; but there!  I don'tknow which it is to be about, and one can't be jealous for two ladiesat once, luckily, for it would be immensely troublesome, unless a good,hearty quarrel would be wholesome to revive his spirits.  It is a badtime for it, though! Well, I hope he does not mean Mary--I could notbear for her to be tormented by him.  That other creature might reignover him like the full moon dispersing clouds.  Well! this is thequeerest predicament I ever heard of!'  And on he wandered, almost asmuch diverted by the humour of the doubt, as annoyed by the dilemma.He had no opportunity for farther investigation: James removed himselfso entirely from his society, that he was obliged to conclude that theprevailing mood was that of not being quite able to bear the sight ofhim.  His consolation was the hope of an opening for some generousproceeding, though how this should be accomplished was not visible,since it was quite as hard to be generous with other people's hearts asto confer a benefit on a Pendragon.  At any rate, he was so confidentof Jem's superiority, as to have no fear of carrying off the affectionof any one whom his cousin wished to win.James was ordained, and shortly after went to some pupils for theEaster vacation, which was spent by Louis at Christchurch, in studyinghard.  The preparation for going up for his degree ended by absorbinghim entirely, as did every other pursuit to which he once fairlydevoted himself, and for the first time he gave his abilities fullscope in the field that ought long ago to have occupied them. When,finally, a third class was awarded to him, he was conscious that itmight have been a first, but for his past waste of time.He was sorry to leave Oxford: he had been happy there in his owndesultory fashion; and the additional time that his illness had kepthim an undergraduate, had been welcome as deferring the dreaded momentof considering what was to come next.  He had reached man's estatealmost against his will.He was to go to join his father in London; and he carried thitherhumiliation for having, by his own fault, missed the honours that toolate he had begun to value as a means of gratifying his father.The Earl, however, could hardly have taken anything amiss from Louis.After having for so many years withheld all the lassez-aller ofpaternal affection, when the right chord had once been touched, hisfondness for his grown-up son had the fresh exulting pride, and almostblindness that would ordinarily have been lavished on his infancy.Lord Ormersfield's sentiments were few and slowly adopted, but they hadall the permanence and force of his strong character, and his affectionfor Fitzjocelyn partook both of parental glory in a promising only son,and of that tenderness, at once protecting and dependent, that fathersfeel for daughters.  This was owing partly to Louis's gentle andassiduous attentions during the last vacation, and also to his longillness, and remarkable resemblance to his mother, which renderedfondness of him a sort of tribute to her, and restored to the Earl someof the transient happiness of his life.It was a second youth of the affections, but it was purchased by a steptowards age.  The anxiety, fatigue, and various emotions of the pastyear had told on the Earl, and though still strong, vigorous, andhealthy, the first touch of autumn had fallen on him--he did not findhis solitary life so self-sufficing as formerly, and craved the homefeeling of the past Christmas.  So the welcome was twice as warm asLouis had expected; and as he saw the melancholy chased away, the sterngrey eyes lighted up, and the thin, compressed lips relaxed into asmile, he forgot his aversion to the well-appointed rooms in JermynStreet, and sincerely apologized that he had not brought home morecredit to satisfy his father.'Oakstead was talking it over with me,' was the answer; 'and wereckoned up many more third-class men than first who have distinguishedthemselves.''Many thanks to Sir Miles,' said Louis, laughing.  'My weak mind wouldnever have devised such consolation.''Perhaps the exclusive devotion to study which attains higher honoursmay not be the beat introduction to practical life.''It is doing the immediate work with the whole might.''You do work with all your might.''Ay! but too many irons in the fire, and none of them red-hot through,have been my bane.''You do not set out in life without experience; I am glad youreducation is finished, Louis!' said his father, turning to contemplatehim, as if the sight filled up some void.'Are you?' said Louis, wearily.  'I don't think I am.  It becomes myduty--or yours, which is a relief--to find out the next stage.''Have you no wishes?''Not at the present speaking, thank you.  If I went out and talked toany one, I might have too many.''No views for your future life?''Thus far: to do as little harm as may be--to be of some use athome--and to make turnips grow in the upland at Inglewood, I have somevague fancy to see foreign parts, especially now they are all in such arow--it would be such fun--but I suppose you would not trust me therenow.  Here I am for you to do as you please with me--a graciouspermission, considering that you did not want it.  Only the firstpractical question is how to get this money from Jem to Clara.  Ishould like to call on her, but I suppose that would hardly beaccording to the proprieties.''I would walk to the school with you, if you wish to see her.  My auntwill be glad to hear of her, if we go home to-morrow.''Are you thinking of going home?' exclaimed Louis, joyfully coming tolife.'Yes; but for a cause that will grieve you.  Mrs. Ponsonby is worse,and has written to ask me to come down.''Materially worse?''I fear so.  I showed my aunt's letter to Hastings, who said it was thenatural course of the disease, but that he thought it would have beenless speedy.  I fear it has been hastened by reports from Peru. She haddecided on going out again; but the agitation overthrew her, and shehas been sinking ever since,' said Lord Ormersfield, mournfully.'Poor Mary!''For her sake I must be on the spot, if for no other cause.  If I hadbut a home to offer her!'Louis gave a deep sigh, and presently asked for more details of Mrs.Ponsonby's state.'I believe she is still able to sit up and employ herself at times, butshe often suffers dreadfully.  They are both wonderfully cheerful.  Shehas little to regret.''What a loss she will be!  Oh, father! what will you do without her?''I am glad that you have known her.  She has been more than a sister tome.  Things might have been very different, if that miserable marriagehad not separated us for so many years.''How could it have happened?  How was it that she--so good andwise--did not see through the man?''She would, if she had been left to herself; but she was not.  Mymother discovered, when too late, that there had been foolish,impertinent jokes of that unfortunate trifler, poor Henry Frost, thatmade her imagine herself suspected of designs on me.''Mary would never have attended to such folly!' cried Louis.'Mary is older.  Besides, she loved the man, or thought she did. Ibelieve she thinks herself attached to him still.  But for Mary'sbirth, there would have been a separation long ago.  There ought tohave been; but, after my father's death, there was no one to interfere!What would I not have given to have been her brother! Well!  I nevercould see why one like her was so visited--!' Then rousing himself, asthough tender reminiscences were waste of time, he added, 'There yousee the cause of the caution I gave you with regard to Clara Dynevor.It is not fair to expose a young woman to misconstructions and idlecomments, which may goad her to vindicate her dignity by acting in amanner fatal to her happiness.  Now,' he added, having drawn his moral,'if we are to call on Clara, this would be the fittest time.  I haveengaged for us both to dine at Lady Conway's this evening: I thoughtyou would not object.''Thank you; but I am sure you cannot wish to go out after such news.''There is not sufficient excuse for refusing.  There is to be no party,and it would be a marked thing to avoid it.'Louis hazarded a suggestion that the meeting with Clara would be tolittle purpose if they were all to sit in state in the drawing-room;and she was asked for on the plea of going to see the new Houses ofParliament.  The Earl of Ormersfield's card and compliments wentupstairs, and Miss Frost Dynevor appeared, with a demure and astonishedcountenance, which changed instantly to ecstasy when she saw that theEarl was not alone.  Not at all afraid of love, but only ofmisconstructions, he goodnaturedly kept aloof, while Clara, clinging toLouis's arm, was guided through the streets, and in and out among theblocks of carved stone on the banks of the Thames, interspersing hernotes of admiration and his notes on heraldry with more comfortableconfidences than had fallen to their lot through the holidays.His first hope was that Clara might reveal some fact to throw light onthe object of her brother's affections, but her remarks only added tohis perplexity.  Once, when they had been talking of poor Mary, andlamenting her fate in having to return to her father, Louis hazardedthe conjecture that she might find an English home.'There is her aunt in Bryanston Square,' said Clara.  'Or if she wouldonly live with us!  You see I am growing wise, as you call it: I likeher now.''That may be fortunate,' said Louis.  'You know her destinationaccording to Northwold gossip.''Nonsense!  Jem would scorn an heiress if she were ten times prettier.He will never have an escutcheon of pretence like the one on the oldsoup tureen that the Lady of Eschalott broke, and Jane was so sorry forbecause it was the last of the old Cheveleigh china.'Louis made another experiment.  'Have you repented yet of giving awayyour clasp?''No, indeed!  Miss Conway always wears it.  She should be richlywelcome to anything I have in the world.''You and Jem saw much more of them than I did.''Whose fault was that?  Jem was always raving about your stupidity instaying at home.'He began to question whether his interview with James had been a dream.As they were walking back towards the school, Clara went on to tell himthat Lady Conway had called and taken her to a rehearsal of a concertof ancient music, and that Isabel had taken her for one or two drivesinto the country.'This must conduce to make school endurable,' said Louis.'I think I hate it more because I hate it less.''Translate, if you please.''The first half-year, I scorned them all, and they scorned me; and thatwas comfortable--''And consistent.  Well?''The next, you had disturbed me; I could not go on being savage withthe same satisfaction, and their tuft-hunting temper began to dischargeitself in such civility to me, that I could not give myself airs withany peace.''Have you made no friends?'One and a half.  The whole one is a good, rough, stupid girl, who comesto school because she can't learn, and is worth all the rest puttogether.  The half is Caroline Salter, who is openly and honestlypurse-proud, has no toad-eating in her nature, and straight-forwardlycontemns high-blood and no money.  We fought ourselves into respect forone another; and now, I verily believe, we are fighting ourselves intofriendship.  She is the only one that is proud, not vain; so weunderstand each other.  As to the rest, they adore Caroline Halter'senamelled watch one day; and the next, I should be their 'dearest' if Iwould but tell them what we have for dinner at Ormersfield, and whatcolour your eyes are!''The encounters have made you so epigrammatic and satirical, that thereis no coming near you.''Oh, Louis! if you knew all, you would despise me as I do myself! I dosometimes get drawn into talking grandly about Ormersfield; and thoughI always say what I am to be, I know that I am as vain and proud as anyof them: I am proud of being poor, and of the Pendragons, and of notbeing silly!  I don't know which is self-respect, and which is pride!''I have always had my doubts about that quality of self-respect. Inever could make out what one was to respect.''Oh, dear! les voila!' cried Clara, as, entering Hanover Square, theybeheld about twenty damsels coming out of the garden in couples.  'Iwould not have had it happen for the whole world!' she added, abruptlywithdrawing the arm that had clung to him so trustfully across many aperilous crossing.She seemed to intend to slip into the ranks without any farewells, butthe Earl, with politeness that almost confounded the little elderlygoverness, returned thanks for having been permitted the pleasure ofher company, and Louis, between mischief and good-nature, would notsubmit to anything but a hearty, cousinly squeeze of the hand, norrelinquish it till he had forced her to utter articulately the messageto grandmamma that she had been muttering with her head averted.  Atlast it was spoken sharply, and her hand drawn petulantly away, and,without looking back at him, her high, stiff head vanished into thehouse, towering above the bright rainbow of ribbons, veils, andparasols.The evening would have been very happy, had not Lord Ormersfield lookedimperturbably grave and inaccessible to his sister-in-law'sblandishments.  She did not use the most likely means of disarming himwhen she spoke of making a tour in the summer.  It had been a longpromise that Isabel and Virginia should go to see their old governessat Paris; but if France still were in too disturbed a state, they mightenjoy themselves in Belgium, and perhaps her dear Fitzjocelyn wouldaccompany them as their escort.His eyes had glittered at the proposal before he recollected the sorrowthat threatened his father, and began to decline, protesting that heshould be the worst escort in the world, since he always attractedaccidents and adventures.  But his aunt, discovering that he had neverbeen abroad, became doubly urgent, and even appealed to his father.'As far as I am concerned, Fitzjocelyn may freely consult his owninclinations,' said the Earl, so gravely, that Lady Conway could onlyturn aside the subject by a laugh, and assurance that she did not meanto give him up.  She began to talk of James Frost, and her wishes tosecure him a second time as Walter's tutor in the holidays.'You had better take him with you,' said Louis; 'he would really be ofuse to you, and how he would enjoy the sight of foreign parts!'Isabel raised her head with a look of approbation, such as encouragedhim to come a little nearer, and apeak of the pleasure that herkindness had given to Clara.'There is a high spirit and originality about Clara, which make her amost amusing companion.'Isabel replied, 'I am very glad of an hour with her, especially nowthat I am without my sisters.''She must be such a riddle to her respectable school-fellows, thatintercourse beyond them must be doubly valuable.''Poor child!  Is there no hope for her but going out as a governess?''Unluckily, we have no Church patronage for her brother; the onlylikely escape--unless, indeed, the uncle in Peru, whom I begin toregard as rather mythical, should send an unavoidable shower of gold onthem.''I hope not,' said Isabel, 'I could almost call their noble poverty asacred thing.  I never saw anything so beautiful as the reverentaffection shown to Mrs. Dynevor on Walter's birthday, when she was theQueen of the Night, and looked it, and her old pupils vied with eachother in doing her honour.  I have remembered the scene so often inlooking at our faded dowagers here.''I would defy Midas to make my Aunt Catharine a faded dowager,' saidLouis.'No; but he could have robbed their homage of half--nay, all its grace.'They talked of Northwold, and Isabel mentioned various details of Mrs.Ponsonby, which she had learnt from Miss King, and talked of Mary withgreat feeling and affection.  Never had Louis had anything so like aconversation with Isabel, and he was more bewitched than ever by theenthusiasm and depth of sensibilities which she no longer concealed bycoldness and reserve.  In fact, she had come to regard him as anaccessory of Northwold, and was delighted to enjoy some exchange ofsympathy upon Terrace subjects--above all, when separated from theschool-room party.  Time had brought her to perceive that the fantasticViscount did not always wear motley, and it was almost as refreshing asmeeting with Clara, to have some change from the two worlds in whichshe lived.  In her imaginary world, Adeline had just been rescued fromthe Corsairs by a knight hospitalier, with his vizor down, and wasbeing conducted home by him, with equal probabilities of his dying ather feet of a concealed mortal wound, or conducting her to her conventgate, and going off to be killed by the Moors.  The world of gaiety wasmore hollow and wearisome than ever; and the summons was as unwelcometo her as to Fitzjocelyn, when Lord Ormersfield reminded him that theladies were going to an evening party, and that it was time to takeleave.'Come with us, Fitzjocelyn,' said his aunt.  'They would be charmed tohave you;' and she mentioned some lions, whose names made Louis look athis father.'I will send the carriage for you,' said the Earl; but Louis had learntto detect the tone of melancholy reluctance in that apparentlyunalterable voice, and at once refused.  Perhaps it was for that reasonthat Isabel let him put on her opera-cloak and hand her down stairs.'I don't wonder at you,' she said; 'I wish I could do the same.''I wished it at first,' he answered; 'but I could not have gone withouta heavy heart.''Are you young enough to expect to go to any gaieties without a heavyheart?''I am sorry for you,' said he, in his peculiar tone: 'I suppose I amyour elder.''I am almost twenty-four,' she said, with emphasis.'Indeed!  That must be the age for care, to judge by the change it hasworked in Jem Frost.'The words were prompted by a keen, sudden desire to mark their effect;but he failed to perceive any, for they were in a dark part of theentry, and her face was turned away.'Fitzjocelyn,' said the Earl, on the way home, 'do not think itnecessary to look at me whenever you receive an invitation.  It makesus both appear ridiculous, and you are in every respect your ownmaster.''I had rather not, thank you,' said Louis, in an almost provokinglyindifferent tone.'It is full time you should assume your own guidance.''How little he knows how little that would suit him!' thought Louis,sighing despondingly.  'Am I called on to sacrifice myself ineverything, and never even satisfy him?'CHAPTER XVIII.REST FOR THE WEARY.Therefore, arm thee for the strifeAll throughout this mortal life,Soldier now and servant true,Earth behind, and heaven in view.REV. I. WILLIAMS.The first impression on arriving at Northwold was, that the danger hadbeen magnified.  Mrs. Frost's buoyant spirits had risen at the firstrespite; and though there was a weight on Mary's brow, she spokecheerfully, and as if able to attend to other interests, telling Louisof her father's wish for some good workmen to superintend the mines,and asking him to consult his friends at Illershall on the subject.Lord Ormersfield came down encouraged by his visit to the invalid, whomhe had found dressed and able to converse nearly as usual.  She beggedhim to come to dinner the next day, and spend the evening with her,promising with a smile that if he would bring Louis, their aunt shouldchaperon Mary.When the Earl went upstairs after dinner, the other three closed roundthe fire, and talked in a tranquil, subdued strain, on various topics,sometimes grave, sometimes enlivened by the playfulness inherent in twoof the party.  Aunt Kitty spoke of her earlier days, and Louis and Maryventured questions that they would have ordinarily deemed intrusive.Yet it was less the matter than the manner of their dialogue--the deep,unavowed fellow-feeling and mutual reliance--which rendered it sorefreshing and full of a kind of repose.  Louis felt it like thestrange bright stillness, when birds sing their clearest, fullestnotes, and the horizon reach of sky beams with the softest, brightestradiance, just ere it be closed out by the thunder-cloud, whose firstdrops are pausing to descend; and to Mary it was peace--peace which shewas willing gratefully to taste to the utmost, from the instinctiveperception that the call had come for her to brace all her powers ofself-control and fortitude; while to the dear old aunt, besides herenjoyment of her darling's presence, each hour was a boon that shecould believe the patient or the daughter, relieved and happy.Louis was admitted for a few minutes' visit to the sick-chamber, andwent up believing that he ought to be playful and cheerful; but he wasnearly overcome by Mrs. Ponsonby's own brightness, as she hoped thather daughter and aunt had made themselves agreeable.'Thank you, I never was so comfortable, not even when my foot was bad.''I believe you consider that a great compliment.''Yes, I never was so much off my own mind, nor on other people's:' andthe recollection of all he owed to Mrs. Ponsonby's kindness rushingover him, he looked so much affected, that Mary was afraid of hisgiving way, and spoke of other matters; her mother responded, and hecame away quite reassured, and believing Mrs. Frost's augury that atthe next call, the invalid would be in the drawing-room.On the way home, however, his father overthrew such hopes, and made himaware of the true state of the case,--namely, that this was but thelull before another attack, which, whether it came within weeks ordays, would probably be the last.'Does Mary know?''She does.  She bears up nobly.''And what is to become of her?'The Earl sighed deeply.  'Lima is her destiny.  Her mother is bent onit, and says that she wishes it herself; but on one thing I amresolved: she shall not go alone!  I have told her mother that I willgo with her, and not leave her without seeing what kind of home thatman has for her.  Mary--the mother, I mean--persists in declaring thathe has real affection for his child, and that her presence will savehim.''If anything could--' broke out Louis.'It should! it ought; but I do not trust him.  I know Robert Ponsonbyas his wife has never chosen to know him.  This was not a time fordisguise, and I told her plainly what I thought of risking her daughterout there.  But she called it Mary's duty--said that he was fully to betrusted where his child was concerned, and that Mary was no stranger atLima, but could take care of herself, and had many friends besidesOliver Dynevor there.  But I told her that go with her I would!''You to take the voyage!  Was not she glad?''I think she was relieved; but she was over-grateful and distressed,and entreating me to be patient with him.  She need not fear.  I neverwas a hasty man; and I shall only remember that she bears his name, andthat he is Mary's father--provided always that it is fit Mary shouldremain with him.  Miserable!  I can understand that death may well comeas a friend--But her daughter!' he exclaimed, giving way more than hemight have done anywhere but in the dark; 'how can she endure to leaveher to such a father--to such prospects!''She knows it is not only to such a father that she leaves her,'murmured Louis.'Her words--almost her words,' said the Earl, between earnestness andimpatience; 'but when these things come to pressing realities, it ispast me how such sayings are a consolation.''Not if they were no more than sayings.'There was silence.  Louis heard an occasional groaning sigh from hisfather, and sat still, with feelings strongly moved, and impelled toone of his sudden and impetuous resolutions.The next morning, he ordered his horse, saying he would bring the lastreport from the Terrace.That afternoon, Mrs. Ponsonby observed a tremulousneas in Mary's hand,and a willingness to keep her face turned away; and, on more minuteglances, a swelling of the eyelids was detected.'My dear,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, 'you should take a walk to-day.  Pray goout with the Conways.''Oh no, thank you, mamma.''If the cousins come in from Ormersfield, I shall tell Louis to takeyou to look at his farm.  It would be very good for you--My dear, whatis it?' for Mary's ears and neck, all that she could see, were crimson.'Oh, mamma! he has been doing it again.  I did not mean to have toldyou--' said Mary, the strong will to be calm forcing back the tears andeven the flush.'Nay, dear child, nothing can hurt me now.  You must let me share allwith you to the last. What did you say to him?''I told him that I could not think of such things now,' said Mary,almost indignantly.'And he?''He begged my pardon, and said he only did it because he thought itmight be a relief to you.''Only; did he say 'only?''I am not sure.  At least,' she added, with a deep sigh, 'I thought hemeant only--''And you, my dearest, if you had not thought he meant only?''Don't ask me, mamma; I cannot think about it!''Mary, dearest, I do wish to understand you.''Is it of any use for me to ask myself?' said Mary.'I think it is.  I do not say that there might not be insuperableobstacles; but I believe we ought to know whether you are stillindifferent to Louis.''Oh, that I never was!  Nobody could be!''You know what I mean,' said her mother, slightly smiling.'Mamma, I don't know what to say,' replied Mary, after a pause.  'I hadthought it wrong to let my thoughts take that course; but when he spokein his own soft, gentle voice, I felt, and I can't help it,that--he--could--comfort--me--better--than--any one.'Not hesitating, but slowly, almost inaudibly, she brought out thewords; and, as the tears gushed out irrepressibly with the last, shehastened from the room, and was seen no more till she had recoveredcomposure, and seemed to have dismissed the subject.Louis kept this second attempt a secret; he was not quite sure how hefelt, and did not wish to discuss his rejection.  At breakfast, hereceived a note from Mrs. Ponsonby, begging him to come to the Terraceat three o'clock; and the hope thus revived made him moreconversational than he had been all the former day.He found that Mary was out walking, and he was at once conducted toMrs. Ponsonby's room, where he looked exceedingly rosy and confused,till she began by holding out her hand, and saying, 'I wish to thankyou.''I am afraid I vexed Mary,' said Louis, with more than his usualsimplicity; 'but do you think there is no hope?  I knew it was a badtime, but I thought it might make you more at ease on her account.''You meant all that was most kind.''I thought I might just try,' pursued he, disconsolately, 'whether shedid think me any steadier.  I hope she did not think me verytroublesome.  I tried not to harass her much.''My dear Louis, it is not a question of what you call steadiness.  Itis the old story of last summer, when you thought us old ones so muchmore romantic than yourself.''You are thinking of Miss Conway,' said Louis, blushing, but withcurious naivete.  'Well, I have been thinking of that, and I really donot believe there was anything in it.  I did make myself rather a foolat Beauchastel, and Jem would have made me a greater one; but you knowmy father put a stop to it.  Thinking her handsomer than other peoplecan't be love, can it?''Not alone, certainly.''And actually,' he pursued, 'I don't believe I ever think of her when Iam out of the way of her!  No, indeed! if I had not believed that wasall over, do you think I could have said what I did yesterday?''Not unless you believed so.''Well, but really you don't consider how little I have seen of her. Iwas in awe of her at first, and since, I have kept away on purpose. Inever got on with her at all till the other evening.  I don't believe Icare for her one bit.  Then,' suddenly pausing, and changing his tone,'you don't trust me after all.''I do.  I trust your principle and kindness implicitly, but I think thevery innocence of your heart prevents you from knowing what you areabout.''It is very hard,' said Louis; 'every one will have it that I must bein love, till I shall have to believe so myself, and when I know itcannot come to good.''You are making yourself more simple than you really are,' said Mra.Ponsonby, half provoked.Louis shut his eyes, and seemed to be rousing his faculties; then,taking a new turn, he earnestly said, 'You know that the promises mustsettle the question, and keep my affections fast.''Ah, Louis! there is the point.  Others, true and sincere as yourself,have broken their own hearts, and those of others, from having madevows in wilful ignorance of latent feelings.  It would be a sin in meto allow you to bind yourself to Mary, with so little comprehension asyou have of your own sentiments.''Then I have done wrong in proposing it.''What would have been wrong in some cases, was more of blindness--ay,and kindness--in you.  Louis, I cannot tell you my gratitude for yourwish to take care of my dear girl,' she said, with tears in her eyes.'I hope you fully understand me.''I see I have made a fool of myself again, and that you have a right tobe very angry with me.''Not quite,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, smiling, 'but I am going to give yousome advice.  Settle your mind as to Miss Conway.  Your father isbeginning to perceive that his distrust was undeserved; he has promisedme not to object in case it should be for your true happiness; and I dobelieve, for my own part, that, in some respects, she is better fittedfor his daughter-in-law than my poor Mary.''No one ever was half as good as Mary!' cried Louis.  'And this is whatyou tell me!''Mind, I don't tell you to propose to her, nor to commit yourself inany way: I only tell you to put yourself in a position to form areasonable judgment of your own feelings.  That is due to her, toyourself, and to your wife, be she who she may.'Louis sighed, and presently added, smiling, 'I am not going to raveabout preferences for another; but I do want to know whether anythingcan be done for poor Jem Frost.''Ha! has he anything of this kind on his mind?''He does it in grand style--disconsolate, frantic, and frosty; but hepuzzles me completely by disclosing nothing but that he has no hope,and thinks me his rival.  Can nothing be done?''No, Louis,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, decidedly; 'I have no idea that thereis anything in that quarter.  What may be on his mind, I cannot tell: Iam sure that he is not on Mary's.'Louis rose.  'I have tired you,' he said, 'and you are very patientwith my fooleries.''You have been very patient with many a lecture of mine, Louis.''There are very few who would have thought me worth lecturing.''Ah, Louis! if I did not like you so well for what you are, I shouldstill feel the right to lecture you, when I remember the night Icarried you to your father, and tried to make him believe that youwould be his comfort and blessing. I think you have taught him thelesson at last!''You have done it all,' said Louis, with deep feeling.'And now, may I say what more I want to see in you?  If you couldacquire more resolution, more manliness--will you pardon my saying so?''Ah!  I have always found myself the identical weak man that all booksgive up as a hopeless case,' said Louis, accepting the imputation moreeasily than she could have supposed possible.'No,' she said, vigorously, 'you have not come to your time of lifewithout openings to evil that you could not have resisted if you hadbeen really weak.''Distaste--and rather a taste for being quizzed,' said Louis.'Those are not weakness.  Your will is indolent, and you take refuge infancying that you want strength.  Rouse yourself, not to be driftedabout--make a line for yourself.''My father will have me walk in no line but his own.''You have sense not to make duty to him an excuse for indolence anddislike of responsibility.  You have often disappointed yourself byacting precipitately; and now you are throwing yourself prone upon him,in a way that is unwise for you both.''I don't know what to do!' said Louis.  'When I thought the aim of mylife was to be to devote myself to his wishes, you--ay, and hetoo--tell me to stand alone.''It will be a disappointment to him, if you do not act and decide foryourself--yes, and worse than disappointment.  He knows what yourdevotional habits are; and if he sees you wanting in firmness orenergy, he will set down all the rest as belonging to the softer partsof your nature.''On the contrary,' exclaimed Louia, indignantly, 'all the resolution Iever showed came from nothing else!''I know it.  Let him see that these things make a man of you; and,Louis--you feel what a difference it might make!'Louis bowed his head thoughtfully.'You, who are both son and daughter to him, may give up schemes andpleasures for his sake, and may undertake work for which you have nonatural turn; but, however you may cross your inclinations, never beled contrary to your judgment.  Then, and with perseverance, I thinkyou will be safe.''Perseverance--your old lesson.''Yes; you must learn to work over the moment when novelty is gone andfailure begins, even though your father should treat the matter as acrotchet of your own.  If you know it is worth doing, go on, and hewill esteem you and it.''My poor private judgment! you work it hard! when it has generally onlyrun me full-drive into some egregious blunder!''Not your true deliberate judgment, exercised with a sense ofresponsibility.  Humility must not cover your laziness.  You have suchqualities and such talents as must be intended to do good to others,not to be trifled away in fitful exertions.  Make it your great effortto see clearly, and then to proceed steadfastly, without slackeningeither from weariness or the persuasions of others.''And you won't let me have the one person who can see clearly, and keepme steady?''To be your husband, instead of your wife!  No, Louis; you must learnto take yourself on your own hands, and lean neither on your father,nor on any one else on earth, before you can be fit for Mary, or--''And if I did?' began Louis.'You would make a man of yourself,' she said, interrupting him. 'Thatis the first thing--not a reed shaken with the wind.  You can do it;there is nothing that Grace cannot do.''I know there is not,' said Louis, reverently.'And, oh! the blessing that you would so bring on yourself and on yourdear father!  You have already learnt to make him happier than I everlooked to see him; and you must be energetic and consistent, that so hemay respect, not you, but the Power which can give you the strength.'Louis's heart was too full to make any answer.  Mrs. Ponsonby lay backin her chair, as though exhausted by the energy with which she hadspoken the last words; and there was a long silence.  He thought heought to go, and yet could not resolve to move.  At last shespoke--'Good-bye, Louis.  Come what may, I know Mary will find in youthe--all that I have found your father.''Thank you, at least, for saying that,' said Louis.  'If you would onlyhold out a hope--I wish it more than ever now!  I do not believe that Ishould ever do as well with any one else!  Will you not give me anyprospect?''Be certain of your own heart, Louis!  Nay,' as she saw his facebrighten, 'do not take that as a promise.  Let me give you a fewparting words, as the motto I should like to leave with you--'Quityourselves like men; be strong.'  And so, Louis, whatever be your fixedand resolute purpose, so it be accordant with the Will of Heaven, youwould surely, I believe, attain it, and well do you know how I shouldrejoice to see'--She broke off, and said, more feebly, 'I must not goon any longer.  Let me wish you good-bye, Louis: I have loved you onlyless than my own child!'Louis knelt on one knee beside her, held her hand, and bowed down hisface to hide the shower of tears that fell, while a mother's kiss and amother's blessing were on his brow.He went down stairs, and out of the house, and took his horse from theinn stables, without one word to any one.  The ostlers said to eachother that the young Lord was in great trouble about the lady at theTerrace.Mary came home; and if she knew why that long walk had been urged onher, she gave no sign.  She saw her mother worn and tired, and sherestrained all perception that she was conscious that there had beenagitation.  She spoke quietly of the spring flowers that she had seen,and of the people whom she had met; she gave her mother her tea, andmoved about with almost an increase of the studied quietness of thesick-room.  Only, when Mrs. Frost came in for an hour, Mary drew backinto a corner with her knitting, and did not speak.'Mary,' said her mother, when she came back from lighting her aunt downstairs, 'come to me, my child.'Mary came, and her mother took both her hands.  They were chilly; andthere was a little pulse on Mary's temple that visibly throbbed, andalmost seemed to leap, with fearful rapidity.'Dear child, I had no power to talk before, or I would not have keptyou in suspense.  I am afraid it will not do.''I was sure of it,' said Mary, almost in a whisper.  'Dear mamma, youshould not have vexed and tired yourself.''I comforted myself,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'I said things to him that Ihad longed to say, and how beautifully he took them!  But I could notfeel that he knew what he was about much better than he did the firsttime.''It would not be right,' said Mary, in her old tone.'I think your father might have been persuaded.  I would have written,and done my utmost--''Oh, mamma, anything rather than you should have that worry!''And I think things will be different--he is softened, and will be moreso.  But it is foolish to talk in this way, and it may be well that thetrial should not be made; though that was not the reason I answeredLouis as I did.''I suppose it will be Miss Conway,' said Mary, trying to smile.'At least, it ought to be no one else till he has seen enough of her toform a judgment without the charm of prohibition; and this he may dowithout committing himself, as they are so nearly connected.  I mustask his father to give him distinct permission, and then I shall havedone with these things.'Mary would not break the silence, nor recall her to earthly interests;but she returned to the subject, saying, wistfully, 'Can you tell methat you are content, dear child?''Quite content, thank you, mamma--I am certain it is right,' said Mary.'It would be taking a wrong advantage of his compassion.  I fall toofar short of what would be wanted to make him happy.'She spoke firmly, but her eyes were full of tears.  Her mother felt asif no one could fail of happiness with Mary, but, controlling theimpulse, said, 'It is best, dearest; for you could not bear to feelyourself unable to make him happy, or to fancy he might have more peacewithout you.  My dear, your prospect is not all I could have wished orplanned, but this would be too cruel.''It is my duty to go to papa,' said Mary.  'What would be selfish couldnot turn out well.''If you could be sure of his feelings--if he were only less strangelyyouthful--No,' she added, breaking off, as if rebuking herself, 'it isnot to be thought of, but I do not wonder at you, my poor Mary--I neversaw any one so engaging, nor in whom I could place such confidence.''I am so glad!' said Mary, gratefully.  'You used not to have thatconfidence.''I feared his being led.  Now I feel as sure as any one can dare of hisgoodness.  But I have been talking to him about self-reliance andconsistency.  He is so devoid of ambition, and so inert and diffidentwhen not in an impetuous fit, that I dread his doing no good as well asno evil.'Mary shook her head.  Did she repress the expression of the sense thather arm had sometimes given him steadiness and fixed his aim?''The resemblance to his mother struck me more than ever,' continuedMrs. Ponsonby.  'There is far more mind and soul, but almost the samenature--all bright, indolent sweetness, craving for something to leanon, but he shows what she might have been with the same principles.Dear boy! may he do well!''He will be very happy with Miss Conway,' said Mary.  'She will learnto appreciate all he says and does--her enthusiasm will spur him on. Ishall hear of them.'The unbreathed sigh seemed to be added to the weight of oppression onMary's patient breast; but she kept her eye steady, her brow unruffled.All the joys did indeed appear to be passing from her with her mother,and she felt as if she should never know another hour of gladness, norof rest in full free open-hearted confidence, but she could not dwelleither on herself or on the future, and each hour that her mother wasspared to her was too precious to be wasted or profaned by aught thatwas personal.Mrs. Ponsonby herself realized the weary soon to be at rest, theharassed well nigh beyond the reach of troubling.  She treated eachearthly care and interest as though there were peace in laying it downfor the last time.  At intervals, as she was able, she wrote a longletter to her husband, to accompany the tidings of her death; and sheheld several conversations with Mary on her conduct for the future.She hoped much from Mary's influence, for Mr. Ponsonby was fond of hisdaughter, and would not willingly display himself in his worst coloursbefore her; and Mary's steadiness of spirits and nerves might succeed,where her own liability to tears and trembling had always been aprovocation.  Her want of judgment in openly preferring her ownrelations to his uncongenial sister had sown seeds of estrangement anddiscord which had given Mrs. Ponsonby some cause for self-reproach, andshe felt great hope that her daughter would prevail where she hadfailed.  There was little danger that he would not show Mary affectionenough to make her home-duties labours of love; and at her age, andwith her disposition, she could both take care of herself, and be anunconscious restraint on her father.  The trust and hope that she wouldbe the means of weaning her father from evil, and bringing him home achanged man, was Mrs. Ponsonby's last bright vision.As to scruples on Lord Ormersfield becoming Mary's escort on thevoyage, Mrs. Ponsonby perceived his determination to be fixed beyondremonstrance.  Perhaps she could neither regret that her daughtershould have such a protector, nor bear to reject his last kindness; andshe might have lingering hopes of the consequences of his meeting herhusband, at a time when the hearts of both would be softened.These matters arranged, she closed out the world.  Louis saw her butonce again, when other words than their own were spoken, and when thescene brought back to him a like one which had seemed his own farewellto this earth.  His thread of life was lengthened--here was the momentto pray that it might be strengthened.  Firm purpose was wakeningwithin him, and the battle-cry rang again in his ears--'Quit yourselveslike men; be strong!'His eye sought Mary.  She looked, indeed, like one who could 'sufferand be strong.'  Her brow was calm, though as if a load sat on her,borne too patiently to mar her peace.  The end shone upon her, thoughthe path might be hid in gloom: one step at a time was enough, and shewas blest above all in her mother's good hope.A hush was on them all, as though they were watching while a tired,overtasked child sank to rest.There was a space of suffering, when Mary and Miss Mercy did all thatlove could do, and kept Mrs. Frost from the sight of what she couldneither cheer nor alleviate, and when all she could do was to talk overthe past with Lord Ormersfield.Then came a brief interval of relief and consciousness, precious forever to Mary's recollection.  The last words of aught beneath were--'Mydearest love to your father.  Tell him I know now how much he has toforgive.'The tender, impulsive, overhasty spirit had wrought for itself some ofthe trials that had chastened and perfected it, even while breakingdown the earthly tabernacle, so as to set free the weary soul, to enterinto Rest!CHAPTER XIX.MOONSHINE.He talked of daggers and of darts,Of passions and of pains,Of weeping eyes and wounded hearts,Of kisses and of chains:But still the lady shook her head,And swore by yea and nay,My whole was all that he had said,And all that he could say.W. MACKWORTH PRAED.Mary's strength gave way.  She was calm and self-possessed as ever, shesaw Lord Ormersfield, wrote to her aunt, made all necessaryarrangements, and, after the funeral, moved to Mrs. Frost's house. But,though not actually ill, she was incapable of exertion, could not walkup stairs without fatigue; and after writing a letter, or looking overpapers, Aunt Catharine would find her leaning back, so wan andexhausted, that she could not resist being laid down to rest on thesofa.She shrank from seeing any fresh face, and the effort of talking to theEarl resulted in such weariness and quiet depression, that Mrs. Frostdared not press her to admit any one else, except Louis, who rode tothe Terrace almost every day; but when the kind aunt, believing theremust be solace in the sight of her boy, begged to bring him in, Maryanswered, with unusual vehemence, 'Pray don't: tell him I cannot seeany one.'  And when Mrs. Frost returned from a sorrowful talk withLouis, she believed that Mary had been weeping.Louis was sad enough.  Out of the few friends of his childhood he couldill afford to lose one, and he grieved much for his father, to whom theloss was very great.  The Earl strove, in his old fashion, to stiflesorrow in letters of business, but could not succeed: the result was,that he would discuss the one, Mary's past, and the other, Mary'sfuture, till time waxed so short that he gladly accepted his son'sassistance.  Conversations with Richardson and orders to Framptondevolved on Louis, and the desire to do no mischief caused him toemploy his intellect in acquiring a new habit of attention and accuracy.His reverence for Mary was doubled, and he was much concerned at hisexclusion, attributing it to his mistimed proposals, and becomingsensible that he had acted boyishly and without due respect.  With alonging desire to do anything for her, he dared not even send her agreeting, a flower, or a book, lest it should appear an intrusion; andbut for his mournful looks, his aunt would have been almost vexed athis so often preventing her from going to make another attempt toinduce his cousin to see him.Mary first roused herself on finding that Lord Ormersfield was takingit for granted that she would wait to hear from her father beforesailing for Peru.  The correspondence which had passed since her motherhad begun to decline, had convinced her that he expected and wished forher without loss of time, and the vessel whose captain he chieflytrusted was to sail at the end of May.  She entreated to be allowed togo alone, declaring that she had no fears, and would not endure thatthe Earl should double Cape Horn on her account; but he stood fast--hewould not be deprived of the last service that he could render to hermother, and he had not reliance enough on her father to let her go outwithout any guardian or friend.Recent letters from Mr. Ponsonby and from Oliver Dynevor reiteratedrequests for an intelligent man conversant with mining operations, andOliver had indicated a person whom he remembered at Chevleigh; but, ashis mother said, he forgot that people grew old in the Easternhemisphere, and the application was a failure.  Finding that Maryregarded it as her charge, Fitzjocelyn volunteered to go to Illershallto consult his friend Mr. Dobbs; and his first meeting with Mary wasspent in receiving business-like instructions as to the person for whomhe should inquire.There were some who felt dubious when he was seen walking back from thestation with a young man who, in spite of broadcloth and growth, wasevidently Tom Madison.'I could not help it, Mary,' said Louis, 'it was not my fault thatDobbs would recommend him.'Mr. Dobbs had looked this way and that, and concluded with, 'Well, LordFitzjocelyn, I do not know who would answer your purpose better thanthe young fellow you sent here a year ago.'It appeared that Tom had striven assiduously both to learn his businessand to improve himself; and, having considerable abilities, alreadybrightened and sharpened by Louis, his progress had been surprising.He had no low tastes, and was perfectly to be relied on for allessential points; but Mr. Dobbs owned that he should be relieved byparting with him, as he was not liked by his fellows, and was thoughtby the foremen to give himself airs.  Quarrels and misunderstandingshad arisen so often, that he himself had been obliged to exert aninfluence on his behalf, which he feared might make him obnoxious tothe accusation of partiality.  He considered that the lad had worth,substance, and promise far beyond his fellows; but his blunt, haughtymanners, impatience of rough jokes, and rude avoidance of theunrefined, made him the object of their dislike, so that it wasprobable that he would thrive much better abroad and in authority; andat his age, he was more likely to adapt himself to circumstances, andlearn a new language, than an older man, more used to routine.The vision of the land for digging gold and silver seemed about to berealized, just as Tom had been growing learned enough to despise it.Enterprise and hopes of fortune made him wild to go; and Mary afterreading Dobbs's letter, and laying before Louis the various temptationsof Lima, found that he thought England to the full as dangerous for hisprotege.  She, therefore, sent for the young man, and decided asdispassionately as she could, upon taking him.The Ormersfield world was extremely indignant; Frampton and Gervasprophesied that no good would come of such a choice, and marvelled atthe Vicar, who gave the lad lodging in his house, and spent theevenings in giving him such mathematical instruction and teaching ofother kinds, as he thought most likely to be useful to him.To his surprise, however, Tom was much more grave and sober-mindedunder his promotion than could have been expected.  Louis, who hadundertaken his outfit, was almost disappointed to find him so much outof heart, and so little responsive to cheerful auguries; and at last alittle hint at bantering about the individual at the Terrace explainedhis despondence.It was all over.  Charlotte had hardly spoken to him while he waswaiting at No. 5, and Miss Faithfull's Martha had told him there hadbeen nothing but walking and talking with Lady Conway's fine butler,and that Charlotte would never have nothing more to say to him!  Now!Just as he might have spoken!  Was it not enough to knock the heart outof it all!  He never wished to go near No. 5 again.Louis strongly advised him at least to know his fate, and declared thatfor his part, he would never take any Mrs. Martha's word, rather thanthat of the lady herself.  Speak out, and, of course, Montrose's famousmotto came in, and was highly appreciated by Tom, though he still shookhis head ruefully, as he recollected what a lout he had been at hislast meeting with Charlotte, and how little he could compare with sucha fine gentleman as had been described, 'And she always had a taste forgentility.''Well, Tom, I would not wish to see a better gentleman any day, thanyou have stuff enough in you to make; and, if Charlotte be a girl worthhaving, she'll value that more than French polish.  You're gettingpolished, too, Tom, and will more as you get better and sounder, andthat polish will be true and not French.'Meantime Charlotte had been in twenty states of mind.  Had Tom strivenat once to return to the former terms, the Lady of Eschalott might havetreated it as mere natural homage, compared him with Delaford'sdelicate flatteries, and disclaimed him.  She had been chilling and shyat the first meeting, expecting him to presume on his promotion, butwhen he was gone, came no more, except for necessary interviews withMiss Ponsonby, and then merely spoke civilly, and went away directly,her heart began to fail her. Neglect mortified her; she was firstaffronted, sure she did not care, and resolved to show that she didnot; but then the vexation became stronger, she wondered if he hadheard of Delaford, was angry at her intercourse with the butler beingdeemed an offence, and finally arrived at a hearty longing for a returnto old times. Vanity or affection, one or the other, demanded Tom'sallegiance.And Tom came at last.  He did not come by moonlight--he did not come atall romantically; but as she was washing vegetables, he stood by thescullery door, and made no elegant circumlocutions.  Would she be hiswife, some time or other? and he would try to be worthy of her.Fitzjocelyn had judged her rightly!  Sound true love had force enoughto dispel every illusion of sentimental flattery.  Charlotte burst intoa flood of tears, and, sobbing behind her apron, confessed that shenever liked nobody like Tom, but she was afraid he would think she hadbeen false to him, for she did like Mr. Delaford's talk, all aboutpoetry and serenades; but she never would heed him no more, not if hewent down on his knees to her.Tom was a great deal more likely to perform that feat.He stood his ground when Mrs. Beckett came in, and told her all aboutit, and the good old soul mingled her tears with Charlotte's, wishedthem joy, and finished washing the greens.  Nevertheless Mrs. Frostthought the kitchen-clock was very slow.Their 'walking together' was recognised.  Martha was very angry withJane, and predicted that the young vagabone would never be heard ofmore; and that the only benefit would be, that it would settle thegirl's mind, and hinder her from encouraging any more followers.  Andeven Mrs. Frost had her doubts.  Her prudent counsel interfered withTom's wish to carry out poor little Charlotte as his wife; and they hadto content themselves with a betrothal until they should have 'savedsomething,' exchanging brooches, each with a memorial lock of hair.During the remaining week, the Lady of Eschalott neither ate nor slept,and though she did her work, her tears never seemed to cease.  Shedefended herself by averring that Miss Ponsonby's pillow was soakedevery morning; but if Mary's heavy eyelids corroborated her, herdemeanour did not.  Mary was busy in dismantling the house and inpacking up; speaking little, but always considerate and self-possessed,and resolute in avoiding all excitement of feeling.  She would not goto Ormersfield, as the Earl proposed, even for one day, and a few booksconnected with the happy lessons of last summer, were given into Mrs.Frost's keeping, with the steady, calm word, 'I had better not takethem.'  She made no outpouring even to that universal, lovingconfidante, Aunt Catharine; and the final parting did not break downher self-restraint, though, as the last bend of her head was given, thelast chimney of Northwold disappeared, her sensation of heartachealmost amounted to sickening.She was going to Bryanston Square.  Her aunt had been as kind aspossible, and had even offered to come to Northwold to fetch her home;but Mary had been too considerate to allow her to think of so dreadfula journey, and had in fact, been glad to be left only to her own AuntCatharine.  The last letters which had passed between Mrs. Ponsonby andAnnt Melicent had been such as two sincere Christian women could notfail to write in such circumstances as must soften down all asperities,alleviate prejudice and variance, and be a prelude to that perfectunity when all misunderstandings shall end for ever; and thus Mary hadthe comfort of knowing that the two whom she loved so fondly, hadparted with all mutual affection and cordial honour.She really loved the little prim stiff figure who stood on the stairsto welcome her.  The house had been her home for ten of the mosthome-forming years of her life, and felt familiar and kindly; it wasvery quiet, and it was an unspeakable comfort to be with one who talkedfreely of her father with blind partiality and love, and did notoppress her with implied compassion for her return to him.Yet Mary could not help now and then being sensible that good AuntMelicent was not the fountain of wisdom which she used to esteem her.Now and then a dictum would sound narrow and questionable, objectionsto books seemed mistaken, judgments of people hard, and withoutsufficient foundation; and when Mary tried to argue, she found herselfdecidedly set down, with as much confident superiority as if she hadbeen still sixteen years old.  Six years spent in going to the otherside of the world, and in seeing so many varieties of people, did notseem to Aunt Melicent to have conferred half so much experience assleeping every night in Bryanston Square, daily reading the MorningPost, and holding intercourse with a London world of a dozen oldladies, three curates, and a doctor.The worst of it was, that a hurt and angry tenderness was alwaysexcited in Mary's mind by the manner of any reference to Northwold orOrmersfield.  It seemed to be fixed, beyond a doubt, that everythingthere must have been wrong and fashionable; and even poor dear AuntKitty was only spoken of with a charitable hope that affliction hadtaught her to see the error of her days of worldly display.It was allowed that there was nothing objectionable in Clara Frost, whowas subdued by the sight of Mary's deep mourning, and in silent formalcompany could be grave and formal too.  But there was a severe shock ina call from Lady Conway and Isabel; and on their departure Mary wascross-examined, in the hope that they had been outrageously gay atNorthwold, and for want of any such depositions, was regaled withhistories of poor Lady Fitzjocelyn's vanities, which had not lost bytheir transmission through twenty-two years and twice as many mouths.Still more unpleasant was the result of a visit from the Earl and hisson to appoint the day of starting for Liverpool.  Louis was in no moodto startle any one; he was very sad at heart, and only anxious to beinoffensive; but his air was quite enough to give umbrage, and causethe instant remark, 'I never saw such a puppy!'Nothing but such angry incoherency occurred to Mary, that she forciblyheld her peace, but could not prevent a burning crimson from spreadingover her face.  She went and stood at the window, glad that MissPonsonby had just taken up the newspaper, which she daily read from endto end, and then posted for Lima.By and by came a little dry cough, as she went through thepresentations at the levee, and read out 'Viscount Fitzjocelyn, by theEarl of Ormersfield.'Mary's mind made an excursion to the dear Yeomanry suit, till her aunt,having further hunted them out among the Earls and Viscounts summed upat the end, severely demanded whether she had known of their intention.'I knew he was to be presented.''Quite the young man of fashion.  No doubt beginning that course, as ifthe estate were not sufficiently impoverished already.  I am notsurprised at the report that Lord Ormersfield was very anxious tosecure your fortune for his son.'This was too much, and Mary exclaimed, 'He never believes in anyfortune that depends on speculation.''Oh, so there was nothing in it!' said Miss Ponsonby, who would haveliked the satisfaction of knowing that her niece had refused to be aCountess, and, while Mary was debating whether her silence wereuntruthful, her bent head and glowing cheek betrayed her.  'Ah! mydear, I will ask no questions; I see you have been annoyed.  It alwayshappens when a girl with expectations goes among needy nobility.''You would not say that, if you knew the circumstances,' said Mary,looking down.'I won't distress you, my dear; I know you are too wise a girl to bedazzled with worldly splendours, and that is enough for me.'The poor old furniture at Ormersfield!Mary held her tongue, though reproaching herself for cruel injustice toall that was dearest to her, but how deny her refusal, or explain themotives.Not that her aunt wanted any explanation, except her own excellenttraining, which had saved her niece from partaking her mother'sinfatuation for great people.  She had a grand secret to pour into thebosom of her intimates in some tete-a-tete tea-party by-and-by, andpoor Mary little guessed at the glorification of her prudence which wasflowing from her aunt's well-mended pen, in a long letter to Mr.Ponsonby.  She thought it right that he should be informed, she said,that their dear Mary had conducted herself according to their fondestwishes; that the relations, among whom she had unfortunately beenthrown, had formed designs on her fortune, such as they had everyreason to expect; that every solicitation had been employed, but thatMary had withstood all that would have been most alluring to girlsbrought up to esteem mere worldly advantages.  It was extremelygratifying, the more so as the young gentleman in question might beconsidered as strikingly handsome to the mere outward eye, which didnot detect the stamp of frivolity, and the effect of an earlyintroduction to the world of fashion and dissipation.  She trusted thattheir dear young heiress would have a better fate, owing to her ownwisdom, than being chosen to support the extravagance of a young titledadventurer.Having worked herself up into enthusiastic admiration of her own work,Miss Ponsonby was kinder than ever to her niece, and pitied her forbeing harassed with Lord Fitzjocelyn's company to Liverpool.Mary was not as much relieved as she had expected, when her hand hadbeen released from his pressure, and she had seen the last glimpse ofhis returning boat.Henceforth her imagination was to picture him only with Isabel Conway.And so Viscount Fitzjocelyn was left with more liberty than he knewwhat to do with.  He was disinclined to begin the pursuit of MissConway, as if this would involve a want of delicacy and feeling, and hehad no other object.  The world was before him, but when he drove tothe Liverpool Station, he was unwilling to exert his mind to decide forwhat ticket to ask.The bias was given by the recollection of a message from his father toFrampton.  It would be less trouble to go home than to write, and,besides, Aunt Catharine was alone.  She was his unfailing friend, andit would be a great treat to have her to himself.Home then he went, where he spent the long summer days in listless,desultory, busy idleness, often alone, dreaming over last year, oftenpassing his evenings with his aunt, or bringing her to see his designs;dining out whenever he was invited, and returning odd uncertain answerswhen Mr. Calcott asked him what he was going to do.Mr. Holdswolth was going to leave James in charge of his parish, andtake a walking tour in Cornwall, and perversely enough, Louis's fancyfixed on joining him; and was much disappointed when Mrs. Frost proved,beyond dispute, that an ankle, which a little over haste or fatiguealways rendered lame, would be an unfair drag upon a companion, andthat if he went at all, it must not be on his own feet.At last, Lady Conway made a descent upon Northwold.  Paris had becomeso tranquil that she had no hesitation in taking her two elderdaughters to make their promised visit; and such appeals were made toLouis to join them, that it became more troublesome to refuse than tocomply, and, at the shortest notice, he prepared to set out as theescort of the Conway family.'Now for it!' he thought.  'If she be the woman, I cannot fail to findit out, between the inns and the sights!'Short as the notice was, the Lady of Eschalott could have wished itshorter.  No sooner had Mr. Delaford set foot in the House Beautiful,than Mrs. Martha announced to him that he would be happy to hear thatCharlotte Arnold was going to be married to a very respectable youngman, whom she had known all his life, and to whom Mr. Dynevor and MissPonsonby had given an appointment to the gold mines, out of respect forLord Fitzjocelyn.  Mr. Delaford gravely declared himself glad to hearit.But Delaford's purpose in life was, that no maiden should fail of beingsmitten with his charms; and he took Charlotte's defection seriously toheart.  His first free moment was devoted to a call in Number 5, butCharlotte was scouring in the upper regions, and Mrs. Beckett onlytreated him to another edition of the gold mines, in which, if theybecame silver, the power and grandeur of Mr. Oliver were mightilymagnified.  Mr. Delaford thrummed his most doleful tunes on the guitarthat evening, but though the June sun was sinking beauteously,Charlotte never put her head out.  However, the third time, he foundher, and then she was coy and blushing, reserved and distant, and somuch prettier, and more genuine than all his former conquests, thatsomething beyond vanity became interested.He courted the muses, and walked in with a pathetic copy of verses,which, some day or other, might serve to figure in the countynewspaper, complaining of desertion and cruelty.Charlotte sat at the little round table; Jane was upstairs, and withouther guardian, she felt that she must guard herself.  He laid the versesdown before her with a most piteous countenance.'Please don't, Mr. Delaford,' she said; 'I asked Mrs. Beckett to tellyou--''She has transfixed my breast,' was the commencement, and out poured aspeech worthy of any hero of Charlotte's imagination, but it was nothalf so pleasant to hear as to dream of, and the utmost she could saywas a reiteration of her 'please don't!'At last she mustered courage to say, 'I can't listen, sir.  I neverought to have done it.  I am promised now, and I can't.'A melodramatic burst of indignation frightened her nearly out of hersenses, and happily brought Jane down.  He was going the next day, buthe returned once more to the charge, very dolorous and ill-used; butCharlotte had collected herself and taken counsel by that time. 'Inever promised you anything, sir,' she said.  'I never knew you meantnothing.''Ah! Miss Arnold, you cannot interpret the heart!' and he put his handupon it.'Nor I don't believe you meant it, neither!' continued Charlotte, withspirit.  'They tell me 'tis the way you goes on with all young women ashave the ill-luck to believe you, and that 'tis all along of yourhard-heartedness that poor Miss Marianne looks so dwining.''When ladies will throw themselves at a gentleman's head, what can apoor man do?  Courtesy to the sex is my motto; but never, never did Ilove as I love you!' said Delaford--'never have I spoken as I do now!My heart and hand are yours, fairest Charlotte!''For shame, Mr. Delaford; don't you know I am promised?'He went on, disregarding--'My family is above my present situation,confidential though it be; but I would at once quit my present post--Iwould open an extensive establishment for refreshment at somefashionable watering-place.  My connexions could not fail to make itsucceed.  You should merely superintend--have a large establishmentunder you--and enjoy the society and amusements for which you areeminently fitted.  We would have a library of romance andpoetry--attend the theatre weekly--and,'--(finishing as if to clenchthe whole) 'Charlotte, do you know what my property consists of?  Ihave four hundred pounds and expectations!'If Charlotte had not been guarded, what would have been the effect ofthe library of poetry and romance?But her own poetry, romance, and honest heart, all went the same way,and she cried out--'I don't care what you have, not I.  I've promised,and I'll be true--get along with you!'The village girl, hard pressed, was breaking out.'You bid me go.  Cruel girl! your commands shall be obeyed.  I goabroad!  You know the disturbed state of the Continent.--In someconflict for liberty, where the desperate poniard is uplifted--there--''Oh! don't talk so dreadful.  Pray--''Do you bid me pause?  At a word from you.  You are the arbitress of mydestiny.''No; I've nothing to do--do go!  Only promise you'll not do nothingdangerous--''Reject me, and life is intolerable.  Where the maddened crowd riseupon their tyrants, there in thickest of the fray--''You'll be the first to take to your heels, I'll be bound!  Ain't youashamed of yourself, to be ranting and frightening a poor girl thatfashion?' cried the friendly dragon Martha, descending on them.'Do you apply that language to me, ma'am?''That I do! and richly you deserve it, too, sir!  See if your missusdoesn't hear of your tricks, if I find you at this again.'The 'sex' fairly scolded the courteous Delaford off the field; andthough she turned her wrath on Charlotte for having encouraged him, andwondered what the poor young man over the seas would think of it, herinterposition had never been so welcome.  Charlotte cried herself intotranquillity, and was only farther disturbed by a dismal epistle,conveyed by the shoe-boy on the morning of departure, breathing thelanguage of despair, and yet announcing that she had better think twiceof the four hundred pounds and expectations, for that it was herdestiny that she and no other should be the bride of Delaford.'If I could only know he would do nothing rash!' sighed Charlotte.Jane comforted her; Martha held that he was the last man in the worldwho would do anything rash.  Miss Conway's Marianne, who was leftbehind, treated Charlotte as something ignominious, but looked so ill,miserable, and pining, that Miss Mercy was persuaded she was going intoa decline, and treated her with greater kindness than she had met sinceshe was a child.In the meantime, Fitzjocelyn had begun with a fit of bashfulness. Theknowledge that this was the crisis, and that all his friends looked tothe result of the expedition, made him feel as if he were committinghimself whenever he handed Isabel in or out of a carriage, and find nocomfort except in Virginia's chattering.This wore off quickly; the new scene took effect on his impressiblemind, and the actual sights and sounds drove out all the rest.  Hishigh spirits came back, he freely hazarded Mrs. Frost's oldboarding-school French, and laughed at the infinite blunders for whichVirginia took him to task, was excessively amused at Delaford'snumerous adventures, and enjoyed everything to the utmost.  To MissConway he turned naturally as the person best able to enter into thecountless associations of every scene; and Isabel, becoming aware ofhis amount of knowledge, and tone of deep thought, perceived that shehad done Mr. Frost Dynevor injustice in believing his friendship blindor unmerited.They were on most comfortable terms.  They had walked all overVersailles together, and talked under their breath of the murderedQueen; they had been through the Louvre, and Isabel, knowing it well ofold, found all made vivid and new by his enthusiastic delight; they hadmarvelled together at the poor withered 'popular trees,' whose name hadconferred on them the fatal distinction of trees of liberty; they hadviewed, like earnest people, the scenes of republican Paris, anddiscussed them with the same principles, but with sufficient differencein detail for amicable argument.  They had thought much of things andpeople, and not at all of each other.Only Isabel thought she would make the Viscount into a Vidame, both asmore quaint and less personal, and involving slight erasures, and Louiswas surprised to find what was the true current of his thoughts.  WithIsabel propitious, without compunction in addressing her, with all thenovelty and amusement before him, he found himself always recurring toMary, trying all things by Mary's judgment, wondering whether he shouldneed approval of his theories in Mary's eyes, craving Mary'ssympathies, following her on her voyage, and imagining her arrival.Was it the perverse spirit of longing after the most unattainable?He demanded of himself whether it were a fatal sign that he regrettedthe loss of Isabel, when she went to spend a few days with her oldgoverness.  Miss Longman had left the Conway family in order to takecare of the motherless children of a good-for-nothing brother, who hadrun too deeply into debt to be able to return to England.  He was nowdead, but she was teaching English, and obtaining advantages ofeducation for her nieces, which detained her at Paris; and as she had abed to offer her former pupil, Isabel set her heart on spending herlast three days in the unrestrained intercourse afforded by a visit toher.  Louis found that though their party had lost the most agreeablemember, yet it was not the loss of the sun; and that he was quite asready to tease his aunt and make Virginia laugh, as if Isabel had beenlooking on with a smile of wonder and commiseration for their nonsense.CHAPTER XX.THE FANTASTIC VISCOUNT.Search for a jewel that too casuallyHath left mine arm: it was thy master's.  Shrew meIf I would lose it for a revenueOf any king's in Europe!--Cymbeline.'My dear Fitzjocelyn, what is to be done?  Have you heard?  Delafordsays these horrid creatures are rising!  There was an attack on theHotel de Ville last night!  A thousand people killed, at least!--TheNational Guard called out!''One of the lions of Paris, my dear aunt; Virginia is seeing it instyle.''Seeing it!  We must go at once.  They will raise those horridbarricades;--we shall be closed in.  And Isabel gone to that governess!I wish I had never consented!  How could I come here at all?Fitzjocelyn, what is to be done?''Drive round that way, if you are bent on going,' said Louia, coolly.'Meantime, Virginia, my dear, I will thank you for some coffee.''How can you talk of such things?' cried his aunt.  'It is all thosesavage wretches, mad because the national workshops are closed.Delaford declares they will massacre all the English.''Poor wretches, I believe they are starving.  I think you are makingyourself ill--the most pressing danger.  Come, Virginia, persuade yourmamma to sit down to breakfast, while I go to reconnoitre. Where arethe passports?'Virginia had lost all terror in excitement, but neither she nor hermother could bear to let him go out, to return they knew not when. Thecarriage had already been ordered, but Lady Conway was exceedinglyfrightened at the notion of driving anywhere but direct to the railwaystation; she was sure that they should encounter something frightful ifthey went along the Boulevards.'Could not Delaford go to fetch Isabel?' suggested Virginia, 'he mighttake a carriage belonging to the hotel.'Delaford was summoned, and desired to go to fetch Miss Conway, butthough he said, 'Yes, my Lady,' he looked yellow and white, andloitered to suggest whether the young lady would not be alarmed.'I will go with you,' said Louis.  'Order the carriage, and I shall beready.'Lady Conway, to whom his presence seemed protection, was almostremonstrating, but he said, 'Delaford is in no state to be of use. Hewould take bonjour for a challenge.  Let me go with him, or he willtake care the young lady is alarmed.  When we are all together, we cando as may seem best, and I shall be able better to judge whether we areto fight or fly.'Outside the door he found Delaford, who begged to suggest to hislordship that my Lady would be alarmed if she were left without eitherof them, he could hardly answer it to himself that she should remainwithout any male protector.'Oh yes, pray remain to defend her,' said Louis, much amused, andhastening down-stairs he ordered the carriage to drive to Rue ----, offthe Boulevard St. Martin.He thought there were signs boding tempest.  Shops were closed, and menin blouses were beginning to assemble in knots--here and there thered-cap loomed ominously in the far end of narrow alleys, and in thewider streets the only passengers either seemed in haste like himself,or else were National Guards hurrying to their alarm-post.He came safely to Miss Longman's apartments, where he found all on thealert--the governess and her nieces recounting their experiences ofFebruary, which convinced them that there was more danger in returningthan in remaining.  Miss Longman was urgent to keep Isabel and LordFitzjocelyn for at least a few hours, which she declared would probablybe the duration of any emeute, but they knew this would cause dreadfulanxiety, and when Fitzjocelyn proposed returning alone, Isabel insistedon accompanying him, declaring that she had no fears, and that hermother would be miserable if her absence should detain them.  Perhapsshe was somewhat deceived by the cool, almost ludicrous, light in whichhe placed the revolution, as a sort of periodical spasm, and MissLongman's predictions that the railway would be closed, only quickenedher preparations.After receiving many entreaties to return in case of alarm, they tookleave, Louis seating himself beside the driver, as well to keep alook-out, as to free Miss Conway from fears of a tete-a-tete.  Exceptfor such a charge of ladies, he would have been delighted at theexcitement of an emeute; but he was far from guessing how serious aturn affairs were taking.The dark blue groups were thickening into crowds; muskets and pikeswere here and there seen, and once he recognised the sinister red flag.A few distant shots were heard, and the driver would gladly havehastened his speed, but swarms of haggard-looking men began to impedetheir progress, and strains of 'Mourir pour la patrie' now and thenreached their ears.Close to the Porte St. Denis they were brought to a full stop by adense throng, above whose heads were seen a line of carriages, the redflag planted on the top.  Many hands were seizing the horses' heads,and Louis leapt down, but not before the door had been opened, andvoices were exclaiming, 'Descendez citoyenne; au nom de la nation,descendez.'  The mob were not uncivil, they made way for Louis, andbade him reassure her that no harm was intended, but the carriage wasrequired for the service of the nation.Isabel had retreated as far as she could from their hands, but sheshowed no signs of quailing; her eyes were bright, her colour high, andthe hand was firm which she gave to Louis as she stepped out. There wasa murmur of admiration, and more than one bow and muttered apologyabout necessity and the nation, as the crowd beheld the maiden in allher innate nobleness and dignity.'Which way?' asked Louis, finding that the crowd were willing to letthem choose their course.'Home,' said Isabel, decidedly, 'there is no use in turning back.'They pressed on past the barricade for which their carriage had beenrequired, a structure of confiscated vehicles, the interstices filledup with earth and paving stones, which men and boys were busily tearingup from the trottoirs, and others carrying to their destination.  Theywere a gaunt, hungry, wolfish-looking race, and the first words thatIsabel spoke were words of pity, when they had passed them, andcontinued their course along the Boulevards, here in desolatetranquillity.  'Poor creatures, they look as if misery made themfurious! and yet how civil they were.''Were you much alarmed?  I wish I could have come to you sooner.''Thank you; I knew that you were at hand, and their address was notvery terrific, poor things.  I do not imagine there was any realdanger.''I wish I knew whether we are within or without the barricades.  Ifwithin, we shall have to cross another.  We are actually becominghistorical!'He broke off, amazed by Isabel's change of countenance, as she put herhand to the arm he held, hastily withdrew it, and exclaimed, 'Mybracelet! oh, my bracelet!' turning round to seek it on the pavement.'The ivory clasp?' asked Louis, perceiving its absence.'Oh yes!' she cried, in much distress, 'I would not have lost it forall the world.''You may have left it at Miss Longman's.''No, no, I was never without it!'She turned, and made a few retrograde steps, searching on the ground,as if conscious only of her loss, shaking off his hand when he touchedher arm to detain her.A discovery broke on, him.  Well that he could bear it!'Hark!' he said, 'there is cannon firing!  Miss Conway, you cannot goback.  I will do my utmost to recover your clasp, but we must not stayhere.''I had forgotten.  I beg your pardon, I did not think!' said Isabel,with a species of rebuked submission, as if impressed by the calmnessthat gave authority to his manner; and she made no remark as he madeher resume his arm, and hurried her on past houses with closed doorsand windows.Suddenly there was the sound of a volley of musketry far behind.'Heaven help the poor wretches,' said Louis; and Isabel's grasptightened on his arm.Again, again--the dropping sound of shot became continual.  And now itwas in front as well as in the rear; and the booming of cannonresounded from the heart of the city.  They were again on the outskirtsof a crowd.'It is as I thought,' said Louis, 'we are between both.  There isnothing for it but to push on, and see whether we can cross thebarricades; are you afraid to encounter it!''No,' said Isabel.'There is a convent not far off, I think.  We might find shelter foryou there.  Yet they might break in.  It might not be easy to meet. Ibelieve you are safer with me.  Will you trust in me?''I will not have you endanger yourself for me.  Dispose of me as youwill--in a convent, or anywhere.  Your life is precious, your safety isthe first thing.''You are speaking in irony.''I did not mean it: I beg your pardon.'  But she coloured and faltered.'You must distinctly understand that this is only as Englishman toEnglishwoman.''As Englishman to Englishwoman,' repeated Louis, in her own formula.'Or rather,' he added, lowering his voice, 'trust me, for the sake ofthose who gave the clasp.'He was answered by her involuntary pressure of his arm, and finally, toset her at ease, he said, hurriedly, 'If it went wrong with me, itwould be to Lima that I should ask you to send my love.'There was no time for more.  They were again on the freshly-tornground, whence the pavement had been wrenched.  The throng hadthickened behind them, and seemed to be involving them in the vortex.Above their heads Louis could see in front between the tall houses, thesummit of another barricade complete, surmounted with the red flag, andguarded by a fierce party of ruffians.All at once, tremendous yells broke out on all sides.  The rattle of adrum, now and then, might be distinguished, shouts and shrieksresounded, and there was a sharp fire of musketry from the barricade,and from the adjoining windows; there was a general rush to the front,and Louis could only guard Isabel by pressing her into the recess ofthe closed doorway of one of the houses, and standing before her,preventing himself from being swept away only by exerting all hisEnglish strength against the lean, wild beings who struggled past him,howling and screaming.  The defenders sprang upon the barricade, andthrust back and hurled down the National Guards, whose heads were nowand then seen as they vainly endeavoured to gain the summit.  Thisdesperate struggle lasted for a few minutes, then cries of victorybroke out, and there was sharp firing on both sides, which, however,soon ceased; the red flag and the blouses remaining still inpossession.  Isabel had stood perfectly silent and motionless throughthe whole crisis, and though she clung to her protector's arm, it wasnot with nervous disabling terror, even in the frightful tumult of themultitude.  There was some other strength with her!'You are not hurt?' said Louis, as the pressure relaxed.'Oh no! thank God!  You are not?''Are you ready?  We must make a rush before the next assault.'A lane opened in the throng to afford passage for the wounded. Isabelshrank back, but Louis drew her on hastily, till they had attained thevery foot of the barricade, where a space was kept clear, and there wasa cry 'Au large, or we shall fire.''Let us pass, citizens,' said Louis, hastily rehearsing the French hehad been composing.  'You make not war on women.  Let me take thisyoung lady to her mother.'Grim looks were levelled at them by the fierce black-bearded men, andtheir mutterings of belle made her cling the closer to her guardian.'Let her pass, the poor child!' said more than one voice.'Hein!--they are English, who take the bread out of our mouths.''If you were a political economist,' said Louis, gravely, fixing hiseyes on the shrewd-looking, sallow speaker, I would prove to you yourmistake; but I have no time, and you are too good fellows to wish tokeep this lady here, a mark for the Garde Nationale.''He is right there,' said several of the council of chiefs, and apoissarde, with brawny arms and a tall white cap, thrusting forward,cried out, 'Let them go, the poor children.  What are they doing here?They look fit to be set up in the church for waxen images!''Take care you do not break us,' exclaimed Louis, whose fair cheek hadwon this tribute; and his smile, and the readiness of his reply, wonhis admission to the first of the steps up the barricade.'Halte la!' cried a large-limbed, formidable-looking ruffian on thesummit, pointing his musket towards them; 'none passes here who doesnot bring a stone to raise our barricade for the rights of the RedRepublic, and cry, La liberte, l'egalite, et la, fraternite, let it fithis perfidious tongue as it may.''There's my answer,' said Louis, raising his right arm, which wasdripping; with blood, 'you have made me mount the red flag!''Ha!' cried the friendly fishwife, 'Wounded in the cause of the nation!Let him go.''He has not uttered the cry!' shouted the rest.Louis looked round with his cool, pensive smile.'Liberty!' he said, 'what we mean by liberty is freedom to go wherewe will, and say what we will.  I wish you had it, my poor fellows.Fraternity--it is not shooting our brother.  Egalite--I preach thattoo, but in my own fashion, not yours.  Let me pass--si cela vou estegal.'His nonchalant intrepidity--a quality never lost on the French--raisedan acclamation of le brave Anglais.  No one stirred a hand to hindertheir mounting to the banquette, and several hands were held out toassist in surmounting the parapet of this extempore fortification.Isabel bowed her thanks, and Louis spoke them with gestures ofcourtesy; and shouts of high applause followed them as they sped alongthe blood-stained street.The troops were re-forming after the repulse, and the point was to passbefore the attack could be renewed, as well as not to be mistaken forthe insurgents.They were at once challenged, but a short explanation to the officerwas sufficient, and they were suffered to turn into the Rue Richelieu,where they were only pursued by the distant sounds of warfare.'Oh, Lord Fitzjocelyn!' cried Isabel, as he slackened his pace, andgasped for breath.'You are sure you are not hurt?' he said.'Oh no, no; but you--''It is very little,' he said--'a stray shot--only enough to work ontheir feelings.  What good-natured rogues they were.  I will only twistmy handkerchief round to stop the blood.  Thank you.'Isabel tried to help him, but she was too much afraid of hurting him todraw the bandage tight.They dashed on, finding people on the watch for tidings, and meetingbodies of the National Guard, and when at length they reached the PlaceVendome, they found the whole establishment watching for them, andVirginia flew to meet them on the stairs, throwing her arms round hersister, while Lady Conway started forward with the agitated joy, andalmost anger, of one who felt injured by the fright they had made hersuffer.'There you are!  What has kept you!  Delaford said they wereslaughtering every one on the Boulevards!''I warned you of the consequences of taking me,' said Louis, droppinginto a chair.'Mamma! he is all over blood!' screamed Virginia.Lady Conway recoiled, with a slight shriek.'It is a trifle,' said Louis;' Isabel is safe.  There is all cause forthankfulness.  We could never have got through if she had not beenevery inch a heroine.''Oh, Lord Fitzjocelyn, if I could thank you!''Don't,' said Louis, with so exactly his peculiar droll look and smile,that all were reassured.Isabel began to recount their adventure.'In the midst of those horrid wretches! and the firing!' cried LadyConway.  'My dear, how could you bear it?  I should have died offright!''There was no time for fear,' said Isabel, with a sort of scorn; 'Ishould have been ashamed to be frightened when Lord Fitzjocelyn took itso quietly.  I was only afraid lest you should repeat their horridwar-cry.  I honour your refusal.''Of course one would not in their sense, poor things, and oncompulsion,' said Louis, his words coming the slower from theexhaustion which made him philosophize, rather than exert himself. 'Ina true sense, it is the war-cry of our life.''How can you talk so!' cried Lady Conway.  'Delaford says the ruffiansare certain to overpower the Guard.  We must go directly. Very likelythis delay of yours may prevent us from getting off at all.''I will find out whether the way be open,' said Louis, 'when I have-'His words failed him, for as he rose, the handkerchief slipped off, agush of blood came with it, and he was so faint that he could hardlyreach the sofa.Lady Conway screamed, Virginia rang the bells, Isabel gave orders thata surgeon should be called.'Spirits from the vasty deep,' muttered Louis, in the midst of hisfaintness, 'the surgeons have graver work on hand.''For heaven's sake, don't talk so!' cried his aunt, without daring tolook at him; 'I know your arm is broken!''Broken bones are a very different matter, experto crede.  This will beall right when I can stop the bleeding,' and steadying himself withdifficulty, he reached the door, and slowly repaired to his own room,while the girls sent Fanshawe and Delaford to his assistance.Lady Conway, unable to bear the sight of blood, was in a state ofnervous sobbing, which Virginia's excited restlessness did not tend tocompose; and Isabel walked up and down the room, wishing that she coulddo anything, looking reproachfully at her mother, and exalting to theskies the courage, presence of mind, and fortitude of the woundedknight.Presently, Delaford came down with a message from Lord Fitzjocelyn thatit was of no use to wait for him, for as the butler expressed it, 'thehaemorrhage was pertinacious,' and he begged that the ladies woulddepart without regard to him.  'In fact,' said Delaford, 'it was aserious crisis, and there was no time to be lost; an English gentleman,Captain Lonsdale, who had already offered his services, would take careof his lordship, and my Lady had better secure herself and the youngladies.''Leave Fitzjocelyn!' cried Virginia.'Is it very dangerous, Delaford?' asked Lady Conway.'I would not be responsible for the consequences of remaining, myLady,' was the answer.  'Shall I order the horses to be brought out?''I don't know.  Is the street full of people?  Oh! there is firing!What shall I do?  Isabel, what do you say!'Isabel was sitting still and upright; she hardly raised her eyelids, asshe tranquilly said, 'Nothing shall induce me to go till he is better.''Isabel! this is most extraordinary!  Do you know what you are saying?'Isabel did not weaken her words by repetition, but signed to Delafordto leave them, and he never ventured to disregard Miss Conway. Virginiahung about her, and declared that she was quite right; and Lady Conway,in restless despair, predicted that they would all be massacred, andthat her nephew would bleed to death, and appealed to every one on theiniquity of all the doctors in Paris for not coming near him.Poor Louis himself was finding it very forlorn to be left to Fanshawe,whose one idea was essences, and Delaford, who suggested nothing butbrandy.  Some aunts and cousins he had, who would not have left him totheir tender mercies.  He was growing confused and feeble, speculatingupon arteries, and then starting from a delusion of Mary's voice torealize his condition, and try to waken his benumbed faculties.At last, a decided step was heard, and he saw standing by him avigorous, practical-looking Englishman, and a black-eyed, white-hoodedlittle Soeur de Charite.  Captain Lonsdale, on hearing the calls forsurgical aid, had without a word, hurried out and secured the brisklittle Sister, who, with much gesticulation, took possession of thearm, and pronounced it a mere trifle, which would have been nothing butfor the loss of blood, the ball having simply passed through the fleshypart of the arm, avoiding the bone.  Louis, pleased with this encounteras a result of the adventure, was soon in condition to rise, thoughwith white cheeks and tottering step, and to present to Lady Conway hernew defender.The sight of a bold, lively English soldier was a grand consolation,even though he entirely destroyed all plans of escape by assuring herthat there was a tremendous disturbance in the direction of theNorthern Railway, and that the only safe place for ladies was justwhere she was.  He made various expeditions to procure intelligence,and his tidings were cheerful enough to counteract the horrible storiesthat Delaford was constantly bringing in, throughout that Saturday, thedreadful 24th of June, 1848.It was late before any one ventured to go to bed; and Louis, weak andweary, had wakened many times from dreamy perceptions that somewonderful discovery had been made, always fixing it upon Mary, and thenfinding himself infinitely relieved by recollecting that it did notregard her.  He was in the full discomfort of the earlier stage of thisoft-repeated vision, when his door was pushed open, and Delaford'strembling voice exclaimed, 'My Lord, I beg your pardon, the massacre isbeginning.''Let me know when it is over,' said Louis, nearly in his sleep.Delaford reiterated that the city was bombarded, thousands of armed menwere marching on the hotel, and my Lady ought to be informed.  Adistant cannonade, the trampling of many feet, and terrified voices onthe stairs, finally roused Louis, and hastily rising, he quitted hisroom, and found all the ladies on the alert.  Lady Conway was holdingback Virginia from the window, and by turns summoning Isabel to leaveit, and volubly entreating the master of the hotel to secure it withfeather-beds to defend them from the shot.'Oh, Fitzjocelyn!' she screamed, 'tell him so--tell him to take us tothe cellars.  Why will he not put the mattresses against the windowsbefore they fire?''I should prefer a different relative position for ourselves and thebeds,' said Louis, in his leisurely manner, as he advanced to look out.'These are the friends of order, my dear aunt; you should welcome yourprotectors.  Their beards and their bayonets by gaslight are a grandmilitary spectacle.''They will fire!  There will be fighting here!  They will force theirway in.  Don't, Virginia--I desire you will not go near the window.''We are all right.  You are as safe as if you were in your owndrawing-room,' said Captain Lonsdale, walking in, and with his loudvoice drowning the panic, that Louis's cool, gentle tones onlyirritated.Isabel looked up and smiled, as Louis stood by her, leaving his auntand Virginia to the martial tones of their consoler.'I could get no one to believe me when I said it was only thesoldiers,' she observed, with some secret amusement.'The feather-bed fortress was the leading idea,' said Louis. 'Someladies have a curious pseudo presence of mind.''Generally, I believe,' said Isabel, 'a woman's presence of mind shouldbe to do as she is told, and not to think for herself, unless she beobliged.''Thinking for themselves has been fatal to a good many,' said Louis,relapsing into meditation--'this poor Paris among the rest, I fancy.What a dawn for a Sunday morning!  How cold the lights look, and howyellow the gas burns.  We may think of home, and be thankful!' andkneeling with one knee on a chair, he leant against the shutter, gazingout and musing aloud.'Thankful, indeed!' said Isabel, thoughtfully.'Yes--first it was thinking not at all, and then thinking not in theright way.'Isabel readily fell into the same strain.  'They turned from daylightand followed the glare of their own gas,' said she.So they began a backward tracing of the calamities of France; and, asLouis's words came with more than usual slowness and deliberation, theyhad only come to Cardinal de Richelieu, when Captain Lonsdaleexclaimed, 'I am sorry to interrupt you, Lord Fitzjocelyn, but may Iask whether you can afford to lose any more blood?''Thank you; yes, the bandage is loosened, but I was too comfortable tomove,' said Louis, sleepily, and he reeled as he made the attempt, sothat he could not have reached his room without support.The Captain had profited sufficiently by the Sister's example to beable to staunch the blood, but not till the effusion had exhaustedLouis so much that all the next day it mattered little to him that thecity was in a state of siege, and no one allowed to go out or come in.Even a constant traveller like Captain Lonsdale, fertile in resource,and undaunted in search of all that was to be seen, was obliged tosubmit, the more willingly that Fitzjocelyn needed his care, and theladies' terror was only kept at bay by his protection. He sat besidethe bed where lay Louis in a torpid state, greatly disinclined to beroused to attend when his aunt would hasten into the room, full of somehorrible rumour brought in by Delaford, and almost petulant because hewould not be alarmed.  All he asked of the Tricolor or of the DrapeauRouge for the present was to let him alone, and he would drop into adoze again, while the Captain was still arguing away her terror.More was true than he would allow her to credit and when the littleSoeur de Charite found a few minutes for visiting her patient's wound,her bright face was pale with horror and her eyes red with weeping.'Our good Archbishop!' she sobbed, when she allowed herself to speak,and to give way to a burst of tears.  'Ah, the martyr!  Ah, the goodpastor!  The miserable--But no--my poor people, they knew not what theydid!'And as Louis, completely awakened, questioned her, she told how thegood Archbishop Affre had begun that Sunday of strife and bloodshed byoffering his intercessions at the altar for the unhappy people, andthen offering his own life.  'The good shepherd giveth his life for thesheep,' were his words, as he went forth to stand between the hostileparties, and endeavour to check their fury against one another.  Sheherself had seen him, followed by a few priests, and preceded by abrave and faithful ouvrier, who insisted on carrying before him a greenbranch, as an emblem of his peaceful mission.  She described how, atthe sight of his violet robes, and the white cross on his breast, thebrave boy gardes mobiles came crowding round him, all black withpowder, begging for his blessing, some reminding him that he hadconfirmed them, while others cried, 'Your blessing on our muskets, andwe shall be invincible,' while some of the women asked him to carry thebandages and lint which they wished to send to the wounded.On he went, comforting the wounded, absolving the dying, and exhortingthe living, and at more than one scene of conflict the combatantspaused, and yielded to his persuasions; but at the barricade at theFaubourg St. Antoine, while he was signing to the mob to give him amoment to speak, a ball struck him, and followed by the weeping andhorror-struck insurgents, he was borne into the curate's house,severely wounded, while the populace laid down their weapons, to sign adeclaration that they knew not who had fired the fatal shot.'No, no, it was none of our people!' repeated the little nun.  'Not oneof them, poor lost creatures as too many are, would have committed theact--so sacrilegious, so ungrateful!  Ah! you must not believe themwicked.  It is misery that drove them to rise.  Hold!  I met a youngman--alas! I knew him well when he was a child--I said to him, 'Ah! myson, you are on the bad train.'  'Bread, mother--it is bread we musthave,' he answered.  'Why, would you speak to one who has not eaten fortwenty-four hours?'  I told him he knew the way to our kitchen.  'No,mother,' he said, 'I shall not eat; I shall get myself killed.''Many a lamentable detail of this description did she narrate, as shebusied herself with the wound; and Louis listened, as he had listenedto nothing else that day, and nearly emptied his travelling purse forthe sufferers.  Isabel and Virginia waylaid her on the stairs to admireand ask questions, but she firmly, though politely, put them aside,unable to waste any time away from her children--her poor wounded!On Monday forenoon tranquillity was restored, the rabble had beencrushed, and the organized force was triumphant.  Still the state ofsiege continued, and no one was allowed free egress or ingress, but theCaptain pronounced this all nonsense, and resolutely set out for awalk, taking the passports with him, and promising Lady Conway toarrange for her departure.By-and-by he came in, subdued and affected by the procession which hehad encountered--the dying Archbishop borne home to his palace on alitter, carried by workmen and soldiers, while the troops, who linedthe streets, paid him their military salutes, and the people crowded totheir doors and windows--one voice of weeping and mourning runningalong Paris--as the good prelate lay before their eyes, pale,suffering, peaceful, and ever and anon lifting his feeble hand for alast blessing to the flock for whom he had devoted himself.The Captain was so much impressed that, as he said, he could not getover it, and stayed for some time talking over the scene with the youngladies, before starting up, as if wondering at his own emotion, hedeclared that he must go and see what they would do next.Presently afterwards, Fitzjocelyn came down stairs.  His aunt wasjudiciously lying down in her own apartment to recruit her nerves afterher agitation, and had called Virginia to read to her, and Isabel waswriting her journal, alone, in the sitting-room.  Lady Conway wouldhave been gratified at her eager reception of him, but, as he seemedvery languid, and indisposed for conversation, she continued heroccupation, while he rested in an arm-chair.Presently he said, 'Is it possible that you could have left thatbracelet at Miss Longman's?''Pray do not think about it,' exclaimed Isabel; 'I am ashamed of mychildishness!  Perhaps, but for that delay, you would not have beenhurt,' and her eyes filled with tears, as her fingers encircled theplace where the bracelet should have been.'Perhaps, but for that delay, we might both have been shot,' saidLouis.  'No, indeed; I could not wonder at your prizing it so much.''I little thought that would be the end of it,' said Isabel.  'I amglad you know its history, so that I may have some excuse;' and shetried to smile, but she blushed deeply as she dried her eyes.'Excuse? more than excuse!' said Louis, remembering his fears that itwould be thrown away upon her.  'I know--''He has told you!' cried Isabel, starting with bashful eagerness.'He has told me what I understand now,' said Louis, coming near in aglow of grateful delight.  'Oh, I am so glad you appreciate him. Thankyou.''You are inferring too much,' said Isabel, turning away in confusion.'Don't you mean it!' exclaimed Louis.  'I thought--''We must not mistake each other,' said Isabel, recovering herself-possession.  'Nothing amounting to what you mean ever passed,except a few words the last evening, and I may have dwelt on them morethan I ought,' faltered she, with averted head.'Not more than he has done, I feel certain,' said Louis; 'I see it all!Dear old Jem!  There's no such fellow in existence.'  But hereperceiving that he was going too far, he added, almost timidly, 'I begyour pardon.''You have no occasion,' she said, smiling in the midst of her blushes.'I feared I had said what I ought not.  I little expected such kindsympathy.'She hastily left him, and Lady Conway soon after found him so full ofbright, half-veiled satisfaction, that she held herself in readinessfor a confession from one or both every minute, and, now that the panicwas over, gave great credit to the Red Republicans for having servedher so effectually, and forgave the young people for having been soprovoking in their coolness in the time of danger, since it proved howwell they were suited to each other.  She greatly enjoyed theuniversally-implied conviction with regard to the handsome young pair.Nor did they struggle against it; neither of them made any secret oftheir admiration for the conduct of the other, and the scrupulousappellations of Miss Conway and Lord Fitzjocelyn were discarded formore cousinly titles.The young hero fell somewhat in his aunt's favour when he was missingat the traveller's early breakfast, although Delaford reported him muchbetter and gone out.  'What if he should be late for the train?--whatif he should be taken up by the police?'  Virginia scolded her sisterfor not being equally restless, and had almost hunted the Captain intogoing in search of him; when at last, ten minutes before the moment ofdeparture, in he came, white, lame, and breathless, but his eyesdancing with glee, and his lips archly grave, as he dropped somethinginto Isabel's lap.'Her bracelet!' exclaimed Virginia, as Isabel looked up with swimmingeyes, unable to speak.  'Where did you find it?''In the carriage, in the heart of the barricade at the Porte St. Denis.''It is too much!' cried Isabel, recovering her utterance, and risingwith her hands locked together in her emotion.  'You make me repent myhaving lamented for it!''I had an old respect for Clara's clasp.''I never saw a prettier attention,' said his aunt.'It is only a pity that you cannot fasten it on for her.''That could only be done by the right hand,' muttered Louia, under hisbreath, enjoying her blush.'You have not told us how you got it!' said Virginia.'It struck me that there was a chance, and I had promised to lose none.I found the soldiers in the act of pulling down the barricade. What anastonishing construction it is!  I spoke to the officer, who was verycivil, and caused me to depose that I had hired the carriage, andbelonged to the young lady.  I believe my sling had a great effect; forthey set up a shout of acclamation when the bracelet appeared, lying onthe cushion as quietly as if it were in its own drawer.''The value will be greater than ever now, Isabel,' said Lady Conway.'You will never lose it again!'Isabel did not gainsay her.The Captain shrugged his shoulders, and looked sagacious at hispatient's preparation for the journey before him.Louis gravely looked into his face as he took leave of him, and said,'You are wrong.'The Captain raised his eyebrows incredulously.  As they left the city,the bells of all the churches were tolling for the martyred Archbishop.And not for him alone was there mourning and lamentation through thecity: death and agony were everywhere; in some of the streets, eachhouse was a hospital, and many a groan and cry of mortal pain wasuttered through that fair summer-day.  Louis, in a low voice, remindedIsabel that, on this same day, the English primate was consecrating theabbey newly restored for a missionary college; and his eyes glistenedas he dwelt with thanksgiving upon the contrast, and thought of the'peace within our walls, and plenteousness within our palaces.'He lay back in his corner of the carriage, too much tired to talk;though, by-and-by, he began to smile over his own musings, or to makesome lazily ludicrous remark to amuse Virginia.   His aunt caressed herwounded hero, and promoted his intercourse with Isabel, to hisexquisite amusement, in his passive, debonnaire condition, especiallyas Isabel was perfectly insensible to all these manuoevres.There she sat, gazing out of window, musing first on the meeting withthe live Sir Roland, secondly on the amends to be made in the 'Chapelin the valley.'  The Cloten of the piece must not even be a Vidamenothing distantly connected with a V; even though this prototype wascomporting himself much more like the nonchalant, fantastic Viscount,than like her resolute, high-minded Knight at the Porte St. Denis.CHAPTER XXI.THE HERO OF THE BARRICADES.The page slew the boar,The peer had the gloire.Quentin Durward.Great uneasiness was excited at Dynevor Terrace by the tidings of theinsurrection at Paris.  After extracting all possible alarm from herthird-hand newspaper, Mrs. Frost put on her bonnet to set off on aquest for a sight of the last day's Times.  James had offered to go,but she was too restless to remain at home; and when he haddemonstrated that the rumour must be exaggerated, and that there was noneed for alarm, he let her depart, and as soon as she was out of sight,caught up the paper to recur to the terrible reports of the first day'swarfare.  He paced about the little parlour, reviling himself for nothaving joined the party, to infuse a little common sense; Fitzjocelyn,no more fit to take care of himself than a baby, probably running intothe fray from mere rash indifference!  Isabel exposed to every periland terror!  Why had he refused to join them? The answer was maddening.He hated himself, as he found his love for his cousin melting under theinfluence of jealousy, and of indignation that his own vehement passionmust be sacrificed to the tardy, uncertain love which seemed almost aninsult to such charms.'What needs dwelling on it?' he muttered; 'doubtless they are engagedby this time!  I shall surely do something desperate if they come here,under my very eye.  Would that I could go to the Antipodes, ere Iforfeit Louis's love!  But my grandmother, Clara!  Was ever man somiserably circumstanced?'A hand was on the door; and he strove to compose his face lest heshould shock his grandmother.It was not Mrs. Frost.'Louis! for Heaven's sake, where are they!''In the House Beautiful.'James breathed--'And you! what makes you so pale?  What have you doneto your arm?'A little affair of the barricades.  I have been watering the FrenchRepublic with my blood.''Rushing into the thickest of the row, of course.''Only escorting Miss Conway through an assault of the Garde Nationalesaid Louis, in a tone as if he had been saying 'walking up the HighStreet.'  How could he help teasing, when he could make such amends?James began to pace up and down again, muttering something aboutmadness and frenzy.'It was not voluntary,' said Louis.  'When the carriage was confiscatedfor the service of the nation, what could we do?--I can tell you, Jem,'he added, fervently, 'what a gallant being she is! It was the gloriousperfection of gentle, lofty feminine courage, walking through theraging multitude--through shots, through dreadful sights, like Unathrough the forest, in Christian maidenly fearlessness.'James had flung himself into a chair, hiding his face, and steadyinghis whole person, by resting his elbow on his knee and his brow on hishand, as he put a strong force on himself that he might hear Louis outwithout betraying himself.  Louis paused in ardent contemplation of theimage he had called up, and poor James gruffly whispered, 'Go on: youwere happy.''Very happy, in knowing what cause I have to rejoice for you.'James gave a great start, and trembled visibly.'I did not tell you,' pursued Louis, 'that the single moment when shelost her firmness, was when she thought she had lost a certain ivoryclasp.'James could endure no more: 'Louis,' he said, 'you must try me nolonger.  What do you mean?'Louis affectionately put his hand on his shoulder: 'I mean, dear Jem,that I understand it now; and it is a noble heart that you have won,and that can value you as you deserve.'James wrung his hand, and looked bewildered, inquiring, and happy; buthis quivering lips could form no words.'It was a time to reveal the depths of the heart,' said Louis.  'A fewwords and the loss of the bracelet betrayed much: and afterwards, asfar as a lady could, she confessed that something which passed betweenyou the last evening--''Louis!' cried James, 'I could not help it!  I had been strivingagainst it all along; but if you could imagine how I was tried!  Younever would come to plead your own cause, and I thought to work foryou, but my words are too near the surface.  I cut myself short.  Ihave bitterly reproached myself ever since, but I did not know the harmI had done you.  Can you forgive me?  Can you--No, it is vain to ask;you never can be happy.''My dear Jem, you go on at such a pace, there is no answering you.There is no forgiveness in the case.  Further acquaintance had alreadyconvinced me that she was lovely and perfect, but that 'she is na mineain lassie.'  Yes, she caught my imagination; and you and my fatherwould have it that I was in love, and I supposed you knew best: butwhen I was let alone to a rational consideration, I found that to meshe is rather the embodied Isabel of romance, a beauteous vision, thanthe--the--in short, that there is another who has all that I am wantingin.  No, no, dear Jem; it was you who made the generous sacrifice.Have no scruples about me; I am content with the part of Una's Lion,only thankful that Sans-Loy and Sans-Foy had not quite demolished himbefore he had seen her restored to the Red Cross Knight.'It was too much for James; he hid his face in his hands, and burst intotears.  Such joy dawning on him, without having either offended orinjured his cousin, produced a revulsion of feeling which he could notcontrol, and hearing the street-door opened, he ran out of the room,just before his grandmother came hurrying in, on the wings of theintelligence heard below.'Yes!  I knew my own boy would come to me!' she cried.  'Even MissConway has not begun to keep him from me yet.''Nor ever will, Aunt Kitty.  There are obstacles in the way.  You mustbe granny, and mother, and sister and wife, and all my womankind, alittle longer, if you please.'  And he sat down fondly at her feet, ona footstool which had been his childish perch.'Not distressed, you insensible boy?''Very happy about Isabel,' said he, turning to look at her with eyesdancing with merry mystification.'A foolish girl not to like my Louis!  I thought better of her; but Isuppose my Lady has taught her to aim higher!''So she does,' said Louis, earnestly.'Ungrateful girl!  Why, Charlotte tells me you led her straight overthe barricades, with cannon firing on you all the time!''But not Cupid.''Then, it is true! and you have really hurt yourself!  And so pale! Mypoor boy--what is it?  I must nurse you.''I had so little blood left, that a gnat of tolerable appetite couldhave made an end of me on Sunday, without more ado.  But, instead ofthat, I had a good little Sister of Charity; and wasn't that aloneworth getting a bullet through one's arm?'Aunt Catharine was shuddering thankfully through the narration, whenJames came down, his brow unclouded, but his manner still agitated, asif a burthen had been taken away, and he hardly knew how to realize hisfreedom from the weight.Mrs. Frost could not part with her boy, and Jane Beckett evidently hada spite against 'they French bandages;' so that Louis only talked ofgoing home enough to get himself flattered and coaxed into remaining atNo. 5, as their patient.The two young men went in the afternoon to inquire after the Conwayparty, when they found that her ladyship was lying down, but Isabel,who had been summoned from a wholesale conflagration of all the MS.relating to the fantastic Viscount, brought down Miss King, apparentlyto converse for her; for she did little except blush, and seemed unableto look at either of the friends.As they took leave, Louisa came into the room with a message that mammahoped to see Mr. Frost Dynevor to-morrow, and trusted that he had madeno engagements for the holidays.James murmured something inaudible, and ran down stairs, snarling atLouis as he turned to the Miss Faithfulls' door, and telling him hewanted to obtain a little more petting and commiseration.'I could not waste such an opportunity of looking interesting!' saidLouis, laughing, as he tapped at the door.Delaford marshalled out the poor tutor with a sense of triumph.  'Hishopes, at least, were destroyed!' thought the butler; and he proceededto regale Marianne with the romance of the Barricades,--how he hadhimself offered to be Miss Conway's escort, but Lord Fitzjocelyn haddeclared that not a living soul but himself should be the young lady'schampion; and, seeing the young nobleman so bent on it, Mr. Delafordknew that the force of true affection was not to be stayed, no morethan the current of the limpid stream, and had yielded the point; and,though, perhaps, his experience might have spared her the contaminatingpropinquity of the low rabble, yet, considering the circumstances, hedid not regret his absence, since he was required for my lady'sprotection, and, no doubt, two fond hearts had been made happy.  Then,in the midnight alarm, when the young nobleman had been disabled,Delaford had been the grand champion:--he had roused the establishment;he had calmed every one's fears; he had suggested arming all thewaiters, and fortifying the windows; he had been the only undauntedrepresentative of the British Lion, when the environs swarmed withdeadly foes, with pikes and muskets flashing in the darkness.Fanshawe had been much too busy with her ladyship's nerves, and tooignorant of French, to gather enough for his refutation, had she wishedfor it; and, in fact, she had regarded him as the only safeguard of theparty, devoutly believing all his reports, and now she was equallywilling to magnify her own adventures.  What a hero Delaford was allover the terrace and its vicinity!  People looked out to see thedefender of the British name; and Charlotte Arnold mended stockings,and wondered whether her cruelty had made him so desperately courageous.She could almost have been sorry that the various arrivals kept thedomestic establishments of both houses so fully occupied!  Poor Tom!she had been a long time without hearing of him! and a hero was turningup on her hands!The world was not tranquil above-stairs.  The removal of the one greatobstacle to James's attachment had only made a thousand others visible;and he relapsed into ill-suppressed irritability, to the disappointmentof Louis, who did not perceive the cause.  At night, however, when Mrs.Frost had gone up, after receiving a promise, meant sincerely, howeverit might be kept, that 'poor Louis' should not be kept up late, Jamesbegan with a groan:'Now that you are here to attend to my grandmother, I am going toanswer this advertisement for a curate near the Land's End.''Heyday!''It is beyond human endurance to see her daily and not to speak! Ishould run wild!  It would be using Lady Conway shamefully.''And some one else.  What should hinder you from speaking?''You talk as if every one was heir to a peerage.''I know what I am saying.  I do not see the way to your marriage justyet, but it would be mere trifling with her feelings, after what haspassed already, not to give her the option of engaging herself.''I'm sure I don't know what I said!  I was out of myself.  I wasashamed to remember that I had betrayed myself, and dared not guesswhat construction she put on it.''Such a construction as could only come from her own heart!'After some raptures, James added, attempting to be cool, 'You candidlythink I have gone so far, that I am bound in honour to makeexplanation.''I am sure it would make her very unhappy if you went off inmagnanimous silence to the Land's End; and remaining as the boy'stutor, without confession, would be a mere delusion and treacherytowards my aunt.''That woman!''She is not her mother.''Who knows how far she will think herself bound to obedience?  Withthat sort of relationship, nobody knows what to be at.''I don't think Isabel wishes to make her duty to Lady Conway morestringent than necessary.  They live in utterly different spheres; and,at least, you can be no worse off than you are already.''I may be exposing her to annoyance.  Women have ten million ways ofpersecuting each other.''Had you seen Isabel's eye when she looked on the wild crowd, you wouldknow how little she would heed worse persecution than my poor auntcould practise.  It will soon be my turn to say you don't deserve her.'James was arguing against his own impulse, and his scruples onlydesired to be talked down; Louis's generous and inconsiderate ardourprevailed, and, after interminable discussion, it was agreed that,after some communication with the young lady herself, an interviewshould be sought with Lady Conway, for which James was alreadybristling, prepared to resent scorn with scorn.In the morning, he was savage with shamefacedness, could not endure anyspectator, and fairly hunted his cousin home to Ormersfield, whereLouis prowled about in suspense--gave contradictory orders to Frampton,talked as if he was asleep, made Frampton conclude that he had left hisheart behind him, and was ever roaming towards the Northwold turnpike.At about four o'clock, a black figure was seen posting along the centreof the road, and, heated, panting, and glowing, James came up--made adecided and vehement nod with his head, but did not speak till they hadturned into the park, when he threw himself flat on the grass under anold thorn, and Louis followed his example, while Farmer Morris'srespectable cows stared at the invasion of their privacy.'Tout va bien?' asked Louis.'As well as a man in my position can expect!  She is the most noble ofcreated beings, Louis!''And what is her mother?''Don't call her mother!  You shall hear.  I could not stay at home! Iwent to the Faithfulls' room: I found Miss Mercy waiting for her, tojoin in a walk to some poor person.  I went with them.  I checked herwhen she was going into the cottage.  We have been walking roundBrackley's fields--''And poor Miss Mercy?''Never remembered her till this moment!''She will forgive!  And her ladyship?''That's the worst of it.  She was nearly as bad as you could havebeen!--so intensely civil and amiable, that I began to think her all onmy side.  I really could be taken in to suppose she felt for us!''I have no doubt she did.  My good aunt is very sincerely loth to hurtpeople's feelings.''She talked of her duty!  She sympathized!  It was not till I was outof the house that I saw it was all by way of letting me downeasy-trapping me into binding myself on honour not to correspond.''Not correspond!' cried Louis, in consternation.  'Are you not engaged?''As far as understanding each other goes.  But who knows what may beher machinations, or Isabel's sense of obedience?''Does she forbid it?''No.  She went to speak to Isabel.  I fancy she found it unwise to testher power too far; so she came down and palavered me,--assured me thatI was personally all that heart could wish--she loved her dear childthe better for valuing solid merit.  Faugh! how could I stand suchgammon?  But I must perceive that she was peculiarly circumstanced withregard to Isabel's family, she must not seem to sanction an engagementtill I could offer a home suited to her expectations.  She saidsomething of my Uncle Oliver; but I disposed of that.  However, I daresay it made her less willing to throw me overboard!  Anyway, shesmoothed me and nattered me, till I ended by agreeing that she has nochoice but to remove instanter from the Terrace, and forbid me herabode!  And, as I said, she wormed a promise from me not to correspond.''You have no great loss there. Depend upon it that Isabel would neitherbrave her openly by receiving your letters, nor submit to do anythingunderhand.''Nor would I ask her!--but it is intolerable to have been tricked intocomplacent consent.''I am glad your belle-mere knows how to manage you.''I told you she was only less unbearable than yourself.  You have itfrom the same stock.''The better for your future peace.  I honour her.  If she had let theWelsh dragon show his teeth in style, he would only have had to makeunpleasant apologies when the good time comes.''When!' sighed James.'If Isabel be the woman I take her for, she will be easily content.''She is sick of parade; she has tried how little it can do for a mindlike hers: she desires nothing but a home like our own--but whatprospect have I of any such thing?  Even if the loss of my fellowshipwere compensated, how could I marry and let Clara be a governess? Claramust be my first consideration.  But, I say, we ought to be going home.''I thought I was at home.''My grandmother and Jane won't be pacified till they see you.  Theythink you are not fit to be in a house by yourself.  They both fell onme for having let you go.  You must come back, or my grandmother willthink you gone off in despair, as you ought to be, and I shall neverdare to speak to her.''At your service,' said the duteous Fitzjocelyn.  'I'll leave word atthe lodge.''By-the-bye, are you up to walking?''Candidly, now I think of it, I doubt whether I am.  Come, and let usorder the carriage.''No--no;--I can't stand waiting--I'll go home and get over the firstwith granny--you come after.  Yes; that's right.'So the hunted Louis waited, contentedly, while James marched back,chary of his precious secret, and unwilling to reveal it even to her,and yet wanting her sympathy.The disclosure was a greater shock than he had expected from her keenand playful interest in matters of love and matrimony.  It was arevival of the mournful past, and she shed tears as she besought himnot to be imprudent, to remember his poor father, and not rush into ahasty marriage.  He and his sister had been used to poverty, but it wasdifferent with Miss Conway.He bitterly replied, that Lady Conway would take care they were notimprudent; and that instant the granny's heart melted at the thought ofhis uncertain prospect, and at hearing of the struggles and sufferingsthat he had undergone.  They had not talked half an hour, before shehad taken home Isabel Conway to her heart as a daughter, and flown inthe face of all her wisdom, but assuring him that she well knew thatriches had little to do with happiness, auguring an excellent living,and, with great sagacity, promising to settle the Terrace on his wife,and repeating, in perfect good faith, all the wonderful probabilitieswhich her husband had seen in it forty years ago.When Louis arrived, he found her alone, and divided between pride inher grandson's conquest, and some anxiety on his own account, whichtook the form of asking him what he meant by saying that Isabel aimedhigher than himself.'Did she not?' said Louis; and with a sort of compunction for a playfulallusion to the sacred calling, he turned it off with, 'Why, what doyou think of Roland ap Dynasvawr ap Roland ap Gruffydd ap Rhys apMorgan ap Llywellwyn ap Roderic ap Caradoc ap Arthur ap Uther apPendragon?' running this off with calm, slow, impressive deliberation.'Certify me, Louis dear, before I can quite rejoice, that this fun isnot put on.''Did you think me an arrant dissembler?  No, indeed: before I guessedhow it was with them, I had found out--Oh! Aunt Kitty, shall I ever getMary to believe in me, after the ridiculous way in which I have behavedto her?''Is this what you really mean?''Indeed it is.  The very presence of Isabel could not keep me fromrecurring to her; and at home, not a room, not a scene, but is repletewith recollections of all that she was to me last year!  And that Ishould only understand it when half the world is between us! How mad Iwas!  How shall I ever persuade her to forget my past folly?  Past!Nay, folly and inconsistency are blended in all I do, and now they havelost me the only person who could help me to conquer them!  And now sheis beyond my reach, and I shall never be worthy of her.'He was much agitated.  The sight of James's success, and the return tohis solitary home, had stirred up his feelings very strongly; and heneeded his aunt's fond soothing and sympathy--but it was not difficultto comfort and cheer him.  His disposition was formed more foraffection than passion, and his attachment to Mary was of a calmernature than his fiery cousin would have allowed to be love. It took agood deal of working-up to make it outwardly affect his spirits ordemeanour, in general, it served only as an ingredient in thepensiveness that pervaded all his moods, even his most arrant nonsense.The building of castles for James, and the narration of the pleasingdelusion in which he had brought home his aunt, were sufficient toenliven him.  He was to go the next morning to call upon Lady Conway,and see whether he could persuade her into any concessions: James wasvery anxious that Isabel and his grandmother should meet, and wasbeginning to propose that Louis should arrange an interview for them inMiss Faithfull's room, before the departure, which was fixed for Monday.'I intend to call upon Lady Conway,' said Mrs. Frost, with dignity thatmade him feel as if he had been proposing something contraband.Louis went first, and was highly entertained by the air of apology andcondolence with which his aunt received him.  She told him howexcessively concerned she was, and how guilty she felt towards him--ascore on which, he assured her, she had no need to reproach herself.She had heard enough from Isabel to lead to so much admiration of hisgenerosity, that he was obliged to put a stop to it, without beingskilful enough to render sincerity amiable, but she seemed satisfied,eagerly assured him of her approval, and declared that she fullyunderstood him.Had she explained, he would have thought her understanding went toofar.  She entirely forgave him.  After all, he was her own sister'sson, and Isabel only a step-daughter; and though she had done her dutyby putting Isabel in the way of the connexion, she secretly commendedhis prudence in withstanding beauty, and repairing the dilapidatedestate with Peruvian gold.  She sounded him, as a very wise man, on thechances of Oliver Dynevor doing something for his nephew, but did notreceive much encouragement; though he prophesied that James was certainto get on, and uttered a rhapsody that nearly destroyed his newreputation for judgment.  Lady Conway gave him an affectionateinvitation to visit her whenever he could, and summoned the youngladies to wish him good-bye.  The mute, blushing gratitude of Isabel'slook was beautiful beyond description; and Virginia's countenance wasexceedingly arch and keen, though she was supposed to know nothing ofthe state of affairs.Lady Conway was alone when Mrs. Frost was seen approaching the house.The lady at once prepared to be affably gracious to her apologies anddeprecations of displeasure; but she was quite disconcerted by thedignified manner of her entrance;--tall, noble-looking, in all thesimple majesty of age, and of a high though gentle spirit, Lady Conwaywas surprised into absolute respect, and had to rally her ideas before,with a slight laugh, she could say, 'I see you are come to condole withme on the folly of our two young people.''I think too highly of them to call it folly,' said the heiress of theDynevors.'Why, in one way, to be sure,' hesitated Lady Conway, 'we cannot callit folly to be sensible of each other's merits; and if--if Mr. Dynevorhave any expectations--I think your son is unmarried?''He is;' but she added, smiling, 'you will not expect me to allow thatmy youngest child is old enough to warrant any calculations on thatscore.''It is very unfortunate; I pity them from my heart.  An engagement ofthis kind is a wretched beginning for life.''Oh, do not say so!' cried the old lady, 'it may often be the greatestblessing, the best incentive to both parties.'Lady Conway was too much surprised to make a direct answer, but shecontinued, 'If my brother could exert his interest--and I know that hehas so high an opinion of dear Mr. Dynevor--and you have so muchinfluence.  That dear, generous Fitzjocelyn, too--'As soon as Mrs. Frost understood whom Lady Conway designated as herbrother, she drew herself up, and said, coldly, that Lord Ormersfieldhad no church patronage, and no interest that he could exert on behalfof her grandson.Again, 'it was most unlucky;' and Lady Conway proceeded to say that shewas the more bound to act in opposition to her own feelings, becauseMr. Mansell was resolved against bequeathing Beauchastel to any of hiscousinhood who might marry a clergyman; disliking that the place shouldfall to a man who ought not to reside.  It was a most unfortunatescruple; but in order to avoid offending him, and losing any chance,the engagement must remain a secret.Mrs. Frost replied, that Mr. Mansell was perfectly right; and seemed innowise discomfited or conscious that there was any condescension on herladyship's part in winking at an attachment between Miss Conway and aDynevor of Cheveleigh.  She made neither complaint nor apology; therewas nothing for Lady Conway to be gracious about; and when the requestwas made to see Miss Conway, her superiority was so fully establishedthat there was no demur, and the favour seemed to be on her side.The noble old matron had long been a subject of almost timid venerationto the maiden, and she obeyed the summons with more bashful awe thanshe had ever felt before; and with much fear lest the two elders mighthave been combining to make an appeal to her to give up her betrothal,for James's sake.As she entered, the old lady came to meet her, held out both arms, anddrew her into her bosom, with the fond words, 'My dear child!'Isabel rested in her embrace, as if she had found her own mother again.'My dear child,' again said Mrs. Frost, 'I am glad you like my Jem, forhe has always been a good boy to his granny.'The homeliness of the words made them particularly endearing, andIsabel ventured to put her arm round the slender waist.'Yes, darling,' continued the grandmother; 'you will make him good andhappy, and you must teach him to be patient, for I am afraid you willboth want a great deal of patience and submission.''He will teach me,' whispered Isabel.Lady Conway was fairly crying.'I am glad to know that he has you to look to, when his old grandmotheris gone.''Oh, don't say--''I shall make way for you some day,' said Mrs. Frost, caressing her.'You are leaving us, my dear.  It is quite right, and we will notmurmur; but would not your mamma spare you to us for one evening? Couldyou not come and drink tea with us, that we may know each other alittle better?'The stepmother's affectionate assent, and even emotion, were a greatsurprise to Isabel; and James began to imagine that nothing was beyondMrs. Frost's power.Louis saved James the trouble of driving him away by going to dine withMr. Calcott, and the evening was happy, even beyond anticipation; thegrandmother all affection, James all restless bliss, Isabel serene amidher blushes; and yet the conversation would not thrive, till Mrs. Frosttook them out walking, and, when in the loneliest lane, conceived awish to inquire the price of poultry at the nearest farm, and sent theothers to walk on.  Long did she talk of the crops, discourse of theFrench and Bohemian enormities, and smilingly contradict reports thatthe young lord was to marry the young lady, before the loversreappeared, without the most distant idea where they had been.After that, they could not leave off talking; they took granny intotheir counsels, and she heard Isabel confess how the day-dream of herlife had been to live among the 'very good.'  She smiled with humbleself-conviction of falling far beneath the standard, as she discoveredthat the enthusiastic girl had found all her aspirations for 'goodness'realized by Dynevor Terrace; and regarding it as peace, joy, andhonour, to be linked with it.  The newly-found happiness, and theeffort to be worthy of it, were to bear her through all uncongenialscenes; she had such a secret of joy that she should never repine again.'Ah!  Isabel, and what am I to do?' said James.'You ask?' she said, smiling.  'You, who have Northwold for your home,and live in the atmosphere I only breathe now and then?''Your presence is my atmosphere of life.''Mrs. Frost, tell him he must not talk so wrongly, so extravagantly, Imean.''It may be wrong; it is not extravagant.  It falls only too far shortof my feeling!  What will the Terrace be without you?''It will not be without my thoughts.  How often I shall think I see thebroad road, and the wide field, and the mountain-ash berries, that werereddening when we came; and the canary in the window!  How little myfirst glance at the houses took in what they would be to me!'And then they had to settle the haunts she was to revisit atBeauchastel.  An invitation thither was the ostensible cause of therapid break-up from the House Beautiful; but the truth was not soveiled but that there were many surmises among the uninitiated.  Janehad caught something from my young Lord's demeanour which certifiedher, and made her so exceedingly proud and grand, that, though she wastoo honourable to breathe a word of her discovery, she walked with herkind old head three inches higher; and, as a great favour, showedCharlotte a piece of poor dear Master Henry's bridecake, kept for luck,and a little roll of treasured real Brussels lace, that she had savedto adorn her cap whenever Mr. James should marry.Charlotte was not absolutely as attentive as she might have been tosuch interesting curiosities.  She had one eye towards the window allthe time; she wanted to be certified how deeply she had wounded thehero of the barricade, and she had absolutely not seen him since hisreturn!  The little damsel missed homage!'You are not heeding me!' exclaimed Jane at last.'Yes; I beg your pardon, ma'am--''Charlotte, take care.  Mind me, one thing at a time,' said Jane,oracularly.  'Not one eye here, the other there!''I'm sure I don't know what you mean, Mrs. Beckett.''Come, don't colour up, and say you don't know nothing!  Why did youwater your lemon plant three times over, but that you wanted to belooking out of window?  Why did you never top nor tail the gooseberriesfor the pudding, but sent them up fit to choke my poor missus?  IfMaster Jem hadn't--Bless me! what was I going to say?--but we shouldsoon have heard of it!  No, no, Charlotte; I've been a mother to youever since you came here, a little starveling thing, and I'll speakplain for your good.  If you fancy that genteel butler in there, say sodownright; but first sit down, and write away a letter to give up theother young man!'Charlotte's cheeks were in a flame, and something vehement at the endof her tongue, when, with a gentle knock, and 'By your favour, ladies,'in walked Mr. Delaford.Jane was very civil, but very stiff at first, till he thawed her bygreat praise of Lord Fitzjocelyn, the mere prelude to his ownmagnificent exploits.Charlotte listened like a very Desdemona.  He was very pathetic, andall that was not self-exaltation was aimed at her.  Nothing could havebeen more welcome than the bullets to penetrate his heart, and heturned up his eyes in a feeling manner.Charlotte's heart was exceedingly touched, and she had tears in hereyes when she moved forward in the attitude of the porcelainshepherdess in the parlour, to return a little volume of selections oftender poetry, bound in crimson silk, that he had lent to her some timesince. 'Would she not honour him by accepting a trifling gift?'She blushed, she accepted; and with needle-like pen, in characters fineas hair, upon a scroll garlanded with forget-me-nots, and borne in midair by two portly doves, was Charlotte Arnold's name inscribed by thehero of the barricades.Oh, vanity! vanity! how many garbs dost thou wear!Delaford went away, satisfied that he had produced an impression suchas he could improve if they should ever be thrown together again.The Lady of Eschalott remained anything but satisfied.  She was touchyand fretful, found everything a grievance, left cobwebs in the corners,and finally went into hysterics because the cat jumped at thecanary-bird's cage.CHAPTER XXII.BURGOMASTERS AND GREAT ONE-EYERS.When full upon his ardent soulThe champion feels the influence roll,He swims the lake, he leaps the wall,Heeds not the depth, nor plumbs the fall.Unshielded, mailless, on he goes,Singly against a host of foes!Harold the Dauntless.'Jem!  Jem! have you heard?''What should I hear?''Mr. Lester is going to retire at Christmas!''Does that account for your irrational excitement?''And it has not occurred to you that the grammar-school would be themaking of you!  Endowment, 150 pounds--thirty, forty boys at 10 poundsper annum, 400 pounds at least.  That is 550 pounds--say 600 pounds forcertain; and it would be doubled under a scholar and a gentleman--1200pounds a year!  And you might throw it open to boarders; set up thehouses in the Terrace, and let them at--say 40 pounds?  Nine houses,nine times forty--''Well done, Fitzjocelyn!  At this rate one need not go out to Peru.''Exactly so; you would be doubling the value of your own property as asecondary consideration, and doing incalculable good--''As if there were any more chance of my getting the school than of therest of it!''So you really had not thought of standing?''I would, most gladly, if there were the least hope of success.  Ican't afford to miss any chance; but it is mere folly to talk of it.One-half of the trustees detest my principles; the others would thinkthemselves insulted by a young man in deacon's orders offering himself.''It is evident that you are the only man on whom they can combine whocan save the school, and do any good to all those boys--mind you, theimportant middle class, whom I would do anything to train in soundprinciples.''So far, it is in my favour that I am one of the few University meneducated here.''You are your grandmother's grandson--that is everything! and you havemore experience of teaching than most men twice your age.'James made a face at his experience; but little stimulus was needed tomake him attempt to avail himself of so fair an opening, coming so muchsooner than he could have dared to expect.  It was now September, andthe two months of waiting and separation seemed already like so manyyears.  By the time Mrs. Frost came in from her walk, she found the twoyoung gentlemen devising a circular, and composing applications fortestimonials.After the first start of surprise, and telling James he ought to go toschool himself, Mrs. Frost was easily persuaded to enter heartily intothe project; but she insisted on the first measure being to consult Mr.Calcott.  He was the head of the old sound and respectable party--thechairman of everything, both in county and borough--and had the castingvote among the eight trustees of King Edward's School, who, by oldcustom, nominated each other from the landholders within the town.  Shestrongly deprecated attempting anything without first ascertaining hisviews; and, as the young men had lashed themselves into great ardour,the three walked off at once to lay the proposal before the Squire.But Mr. Calcott was not at home.  He had set off yesterday, with MissCalcott and Miss Caroline, for a tour in Wales, and would not returnfor a week or ten days.To the imaginations of Lord Fitzjocelyn and Mr. Frost, this was fataldelay.  Besides, he would be sure to linger!--He would not come homefor a month--nay, six weeks at least!--What candidates might notstart--what pledges might not be given in the meantime!James, vehement and disappointed, went home to spend the evening on theconcoction of what his grandmother approved as 'a very proper letter,'to be despatched to meet the Squire at the post-office at Caernarvon,and resigned himself to grumble away the period of his absence,secretly relieved at the postponement of the evil day of the canvass,at which all the Pendragon blood was in a state of revolt.But Louis, in his solitude at Ormersfield, had nothing to distract histhoughts, or prevent him from lapsing into one of his most single-eyedfits of impetuosity.  He had come to regard James as the sole hope forNorthwold school, and Northwold school as the sole hope for James; andhad created an indefinite host of dangerous applicants, only to beforestalled by the most vigorous measures. Evening, night, and morning,did but increase the conviction, till he ordered his horse, andgalloped to the Terrace as though the speed of his charger would decidethe contest.Eloquently and piteously did he protest against James's promise to takeno steps until the Squire's opinion should be known.  He convinced hiscousin, talked over his aunt, and prevailed to have the letterre-written, and sent off to the post with the applications fortestimonials.Then the rough draft of the circular was revised and corrected, till itappeared so admirable to Louis, that he snatched it up, and ran awaywith it to read it to old Mr. Walby, who was one of the trustees, andvery fond of his last year's patient.  His promise, good easy man, waspretty sure to be the prize of the first applicant; but this did notrender it less valuable to his young lordship, who came back allglorious with an eighth part of the victory, and highly delighted withthe excellent apothecary's most judicious and gratifyingsentiments,--namely, all his own eager rhetoric, to which the good manhad cordially given his meek puzzle-headed assent.  Thenceforth Mr.Walby was to 'think' all Fitzjocelyn's strongest recommendations of hiscousin.There was no use in holding back now.  James was committed, and,besides, there was a vision looming in the distance of a scholar from aforeign University with less than half a creed.  Thenceforth promptmeasures were a mere duty to the rising generation; and Louis draggedhis Coriolanus into the town, to call upon certain substantialtradesmen, who had voices among the eight.Civility was great; but the portly grocer and gentlemanly booksellerhad both learned prudence in many an election; neither would make anyimmediate reply--the one because he never did anything but what Mr.Calcott directed, and the other never pledged himself till all thecandidates were in the field, and he had impartially printed all theiraddresses.Richardson, the solicitor, and man-of-business to the Ormersfieldestate, appeared so sure a card, that James declared that he wasashamed of the farce of calling on him, but they obtained no decidedreply.  Louis was proud that Richardson should display an independentconscience, and disdained his cousin's sneering comment, that he hadforgotten that there were other clients in the county besides theFitzjocelyns.No power could drag Mr. Frost a step further.  He would not hear ofcanvassing that 'very intelligent' Mr. Ramsbotham, of the Factory, whohad been chosen at unawares by the trustees before his principles haddeveloped themselves; far less on his nominee, the wealthy butcher,always more demonstratively of the same mind.James declared, first, that he would have nothing to do with them;secondly, that he could not answer it to the Earl to let Louis ask afavour of them; thirdly, that he had rather fail than owe his electionto them; fourthly, that it would be most improper usage of Mr. Calcottto curry favour with men who systematically opposed him; and, fifthly,that they could only vote for him on a misunderstanding of hisintentions.The eighth trustee was a dead letter,--an old gentleman long retiredfrom business at his bank to a cottage at the Lakes, where he waswritten to, but without much hope of his taking the trouble even toreply.  However, if the choice lay only between James and therepresentative of the new lights, there could be little reasonable fear.Much fretting and fuming was expended on the non-arrival of a letterfrom Mr. Calcott; but on the appointed tenth day he came home, and thenext morning James was at Ormersfield in an agony of disappointment.The Squire had sent him a note, kind in expression, regretting hisinability to give his interest to one for whom he had always so muchregard, and whose family he so highly respected, but that he hadalready promised his support to a Mr. Powell, the under-master of alarge classical school, whom he thought calculated for the situation,both by experience and acquirements.James had been making sure enough of the school to growl at hisintended duties; but he had built so entirely on success, and formed somany projects, that the disappointment was extreme; it appeared a cruelinjury in so old a friend to have overlooked him.  He had been muchvexed with his grandmother for regarding the veto as decisive; and heviewed all his hopes of happiness with Isabel as overthrown.Louis partook and exaggerated his sentiments.  They railed--the onefiercely, the other philosophically--against the Squire's domineering;they proved him narrow and prejudiced--afraid of youth, afraid ofsalutary reform, bent on prolonging the dull old system, and onbringing in a mere usher.  They recollected a mauvais sujet from thesaid classical school; argued that it never turned out good scholars,nor good men; and that they should be conferring the greatest benefiton Northwold burghers yet unborn, by recalling the old Squire to abetter mind, or by bringing in James Frost in spite of him.Not without hopes of the first, though, as James told him, no one wouldhave nourished them save himself, Louis set forth for Little Northwold,with the same valour which had made him the champion of the Marksedgepoacher.  He found the old gentleman good-natured and sympathizing, forhe liked the warm friendship of 'the two boys,' and had not the mostremote idea of their disputing his verdict.'It is very unlucky that I was from home,' he said.  'I am afraid thedisappointment will be the greater from its having gone so far.''May I ask whether you are absolutely pledged to Mr. Powell?''Why, yes.  I may say so.  Considering all things, it is best as it is.I should have been unwilling to vex my good old friend, Mrs. Frost; andyet,' smiling benignantly on his fretted auditor, 'I have to look outfor the school first of all, you know.''Perhaps I shall not allow that Mr. Powell is the best look-out for theschool, sir.''Eh?  The best under the circumstances.  Such a place as this wantsexperience and discipline more than scholarship.  Powell is the veryman, and has been waiting for it long; and young Frost could do muchbetter for himself, if he will only have patience.''Then his age is all that is against him?  The only inferiority to Mr.Powell?'Hm! yes, I may say so.  Inferior?  No, he is superior enough; it is amere joke to compare them; but this is not a post for one of your youngunmarried men.''If that be all,' cried Louis, 'the objection would be soon removed. Itmay be an inducement to hear that you would be making two people happyinstead of one.''Now, don't tell me so!' almost angrily exclaimed the Squire.  'JemFrost marry!  He has no business to think of it these ten years!  Heought to be minding his grandmother and sister.  To marry on thatschool would be serving poor Mrs. Frost exactly as his poor absurdfather did before him, and she is too old to have all that over again.I thought he was of a different sort of stamp.''My aunt gives her full consent.''I've no doubt of it! just like her!  But he ought to be ashamed to askher, at her age, when she should have every comfort he could give her.Pray, who is the lady?  There was some nonsense afloat about MissConway; but I never believed him so foolish!''It is perfectly true, but I must beg you not to mention it; I oughtnot to have been betrayed into mentioning it.''You need not caution me.  It is not news I should be forward tospread.  What does your father say to it?''The engagement took place since he left England.''I should think so!'  Then pausing, he added, with condescendinggood-nature, 'Well, Fitzjocelyn, I seem to you a terrible oldflint-stone, but I can't help that.  There are considerations besidestrue love, you know; and for these young people, they can't have pinedout their hearts yet, as, by your own showing, they have not beenengaged three months.  If it were Sydney himself, I should tell himthat love is all the better for keeping--if it is good for anything;and where there is such a disparity, it ought, above all, to be testedby waiting.  So tell Master Jem, with my best wishes, to take care ofhis grandmother.  I shall think myself doing him a kindness in keepinghim out of the school, if it is to hinder him from marrying atfour-and-twenty, and a girl brought up as she has been!''And, Mr. Calcott,' said Louis, rising, 'you will excuse my viewing mycousin's engagement as an additional motive for doing my utmost topromote his success in obtaining a situation, for which I consider himas eminently fitted.  Good morning, sir.''Good morning, my Lord.'Lord Fitzjocelyn departed so grave, so courteous, so dignified, soresolute, so comically like his father, that the old Squire threwhimself back in his chair and laughed heartily.  The magnificentchallenge of war to the knife, was no more to him than the adjurationhe had heard last year in the justice-room; and he no more expectedthese two lads to make any effectual opposition than he did to see themrepeal the game-laws.The Viscount meanwhile rode off thoroughly roused to indignation. Thegood sense of sixty naturally fell hard and cold on the ears oftwenty-two, and it was one of the moments when counsel inflamed insteadof checking him.  Never angry on his own account, he could beexceedingly wrathful for others; and the unlucky word, disparity, drovehim especially wild.  In mere charity, he thought it right to withholdthis insult to the Pendragons from his cousin's ears; but this veryreserve seemed to bind him to resent it in James's stead; and he wasfar more blindly impetuous than if, as usual, he had seen James sovehement that he was obliged to try to curb and restrain him.He would not hear of giving in!  When the Ramsbotham candidateappeared, and James scrupled to divide the contrary interest, Louislaid the whole blame of the split upon Mr. Calcott; while, as to poorMr. Powell, no words were compassionate enough for his dull, slouching,ungentlemanly air; and he was pronounced to be an old writing-master,fit for nothing but to mend pens.But Mr. Walby's was still their sole promise.  The grocer followed theSquire; the bookseller was liberal, and had invited the Ramsbothamcandidate to dinner.  On this alarming symptom, Fitzjocelyn fell uponRichardson, and talked, and talked, and talked, till the solicitorcould either bear it no longer, or feared for the Ormersfield agency,and his vote was carried off as a captive.This triumph alarmed Mrs. Frost and James, who knew how scrupulouslythe Earl abstained from seeking anything like a favour at Northwold;and they tried to impress this on Louis, but he was exalted far aboveeven understanding the remonstrance.  It was all theirdisinterestedness; he had no notion of that guarded pride which wouldincur no obligation.  No, no; if Jem would be beholden to no one, hewould accept all as personal kindness to himself.  Expect a return! hereturned good-will--of course he would do any one a kindness. Claims,involving himself! he would take care of that; and off he went laughing.He came in the next day, announcing a still grander and more formidableencounter.  He had met Mr. Ramsbotham himself, and secured his promisethat, in case he failed in carrying his own man, he and the butcherwould support Mr. Frost.The fact was, that Lord Fitzjocelyn's advocacy of the poacher, his freeaddress, his sympathy for 'the masses,' and his careless words, hadinspired expectations of his liberal views; Mr. Ramsbotham was notsorry to establish a claim, and was likewise gratified by the frankengaging manners, which increased the pleasure of being solicited by anobleman--a distinction of which he thought more than did all theopposite party.To put James beyond the perils of the casting vote was next the point.Without divulging his tactics, Louis flew off one morning by the train,made a sudden descent on the recluse banker at Ambleside, barbarouslyused his gift of the ceaseless tongue, till the poor old man was nearlydistracted, touched his wife's tender heart with good old Mrs. Frostand the two lovers, and made her promise to bring him comfortably andquietly down to stay at Ormersfield and give his vote.And so, when the election finally came on, Mr. Calcott found himselfleft with only his faithful grocer to support his protege.  Three voteswere given at once for the Reverend James Roland Frost Dynevor; thebookseller followed as soon as he saw how the land lay; and Ramsbothamand Co. swelled the majority as soon as they saw that their friend hadno chance.Poor Mr. Powell went home to his drudgery with his wrinkles deeper thanever; and his wife sighed as she resigned her last hope of sending herson to the University.Mr. Calcott had, for the first time in his life, been over-ridden by anunscrupulous use of his neighbour's rank; and of the youthfulness thatinspired hopes of fixing a claim on an untried, inexperienced man.The old Squire was severely hurt and mortified; but he was verymagnanimous--generously wished James joy, and congratulated Mrs. Frostwith all his heart.  He was less cordial with Louis; but the worst hesaid of him was, that he was but a lad, his father was out of the way,and he wished he might not find that he had got himself into a scrape.He could not think why a man of old Ormersfield's age should gofiguring round Cape Horn, instead of staying to keep his own son inorder.Sydney was absent; but the rest of the family and their friends wereless forbearing than the person chiefly concerned.  They talkedfuriously, and made a strong exertion of forgiveness in order not tocut Fitzjocelyn.  Sir Gilbert Brewster vowed that it would serve himright to be turned out of the troop, and that he must keep a sharp lookout lest he should sow disaffection among the Yeomanry.  Making friendswith Ramsbotham! never taking out a gun!  The country was gone to thedogs when such as he was to be a peer!END OF VOL. I.CHAPTER I.
THE TRYSTE.
One single flash of glad surprise
Just glanced from Isabel's dark eyes,
Then vanished in the blush of shame
That as its penance instant came--
'O thought unworthy of my race!'
The Lord of the Isles.
As little recked Fitzjocelyn of the murmurs which he had provoked, as
he guessed the true secret of his victory.  In his eyes, it was the
triumph of merit over prejudice, and Mrs. Frost espoused the same
gratifying view, though ascribing much to her nephew's activity, and
James himself, flushed with hope and success, was not likely to dissent.
Next they had to make their conquest available.  Apart from Louis's
magnificent prognostications, at the lowest computation, the head
master's income amounted to a sum which to James appeared affluence;
and though there was no house provided, it mattered the less since
there were five to choose from in the Terrace, even if his grandmother
had not wished that their household should be still the same.  With
Miss Conway's own fortune and the Terrace settled on herself, where
could be any risk?
Would Lady Conway think so? and how should the communication be made?
James at first proposed writing to her, enclosing a letter to Isabel;
but he changed his mind, unable to satisfy himself that, when absent
from restraint, she might not send a refusal without affording her
daughter the option.  He begged his grandmother to write to Isabel; but
she thought her letter might carry too much weight, and, whatever might
be her hopes, it was not for her to tell the young lady that such means
were sufficient.
Louis begged to be the bearer of the letter.  His aunt would certainly
keep terms with him, and he could insure that the case was properly
laid before Isabel; and, as there could be no doubt at present of his
persuasive powers, James caught at the offer.  The party were still at
Beauchastel, and he devised going to his old quarters at Ebbscreek, and
making a descent upon them from thence.
When he came to take up his credentials, he found James and his little
black leathern bag, determined to come at least to Ebbscreek with him,
and declaring it made him frantic to stay at home and leave his cause
in other hands, and that he could not exist anywhere but close to the
scene of action.
Captain Hannaford was smoking in his demi-boat, and gave his former
lodgers a hearty welcome, but he twinkled knowingly with his eye, and
so significantly volunteered to inform them that the ladies were still
at Beauchastel, that James's wrath at the old skipper's impudence began
to revive, and he walked off to the remotest end of the garden.
The Captain, remaining with Louis, with whom he was always on far more
easy terms, looked after the other gentleman, winked again, and
confessed that he had suspected one or other of them might be coming
that way this summer, though he could not say he had expected to see
them both together.
'Mind, Captain,' said Louis,' it wasn't I that made the boat late
this time last year.'
'Well!  I might be wrong, I fancied you cast an eye that way.  Then
maybe it ain't true what's all over the place here.'
Louis pressed to hear what.  'Why, that when the French were going on
like Robert Spear and them old times, he had convoyed the young lady
right through the midst of them, and they would both have been shot, if
my Lady's butler hadn't come down with a revolver, killed half-a-dozen
of the mob, and rescued them out of it, but that Lord Fitzjocelyn had
been desperately wounded in going back to fetch her bracelet, and Mr.
Delaford had carried him out in his arms.'
'Well!' said Louis, coolly, without altering a muscle of his face, as
the Captain looked for an angry negative.
'And when they got home,--so the story went,--Mr. Frost, the tutor, was
so mad with jealousy and rage, that my Lady declared those moorings
would not suit her no longer, but had let go, and laid her head right
for Beauchastel.'
'Pray what was the young lady supposed to think of the matter?'
'Stories appeared to vary.  One version said that Mr. Delaford had
found him on his knees to her; and that my Lady had snatched her
cruelly away, because she would not have her married before her own
daughters, and looked over all the post, for fear there should be a
letter for her.  Another declared that Miss Conway would not have him
at any price, and was set upon the poor tutor, and that he was lying
dangerously ill of a low fever. --The women will have it so,' observed
the Captain, 'the story's everywhere, except maybe in the parlour at
Beauchastel, and I wouldn't wonder if Mrs. Mansell knew it all herself,
for her maid has a tongue a yard long.  I won't say but I thought there
might be some grain of truth at the bottom--'
'And you shall hear it by-and-by, when I know what it is myself.'
'I'd not say I would have believed it the more if that fine gentleman
had taken his oath of it--a fellow that ain't to be trusted,' observed
the Captain.
This might have led to a revelation, if Louis had had time to attend to
it; but he had pity on James's impatient misery, and proceeded to ask
the loan of the boat.  The tide would not, however, serve; and as
waiting till it would was not to be endured, the two cousins set off to
walk together through the woods, Louis beguiling the way by chaffing
James, as far as he would bear, with the idea of Isabel's name being
trifled with by the profane crowd.
He left James at the gate of the park, prowling about like a panther to
try for a glimpse of Isabel's window, and feeding his despair and
jealousy that Louis should boldly walk up to the door, while he, with
so much better a right, was excluded by his unguarded promise to Lady
Conway.
All the tumultuary emotions of his mind were endlessly repeated, and
many a slow and pealing note of the church-clock had added fuel to his
impatience, and spurred him to rush up to the door and claim his
rights, before Louis came bounding past the lodge-gates, flourishing
his cap, and crying, 'Hurrah, Jem!  All right!'
'I'm going to her at once!' cried Jem, beginning to rush off; but Louis
caught and imprisoned his arm.
'Not so fast, sir!  You are to see her.  I promise you shall see her if
you wish it, but it must be in my aunt's way.'
'Let me go, I say!'
'When I have walked five miles in your service, you won't afford me an
arm to help me back.  I am not a horse with wings, and I won't be
Cupid's post except on my own terms.  Come back.'
'I don't stir till I have heard the state of the case.'
'Yes, you do; for all the sportsmen will be coming home, and my aunt
would not for all the world that Mr. Mansell caught you on the
forbidden ground.'
'How can you give in to such shuffling nonsense!  If I am to claim
Isabel openly, why am I not to visit her openly?  You have yielded to
that woman's crooked policy.  I don't trust you!'
'When you are her son, you may manage her as you please.  Just now she
has us in her power, and can impose conditions.  Come on; and if you
are good, you shall hear.'
Drawing James along with him through the beechwood glades, he began,
'You would have been more insane still if you had guessed at my luck. I
found Isabel alone.  Mrs. Mansell had taken the girls to some juvenile
fete, and Delaford was discreet enough not to rouse my aunt from her
letters.  I augured well from the happy conjunction.'
'Go on; don't waste time in stuff.'
'Barkis is willing, then.  Is that enough to the point?'
'Fitzjocelyn, you never had any feelings yourself, and therefore you
trifle with those of others.'
'I beg your pardon.  It was a shame!  Jem, you may be proud.  She
trusts you completely, and whatever you think sufficient, she regards
as ample.'
'Like her!  Only too like her.  Such confidence makes one feel a
redoubled responsibility.'
'I thought I had found something at which you could not grumble.'
'How does she look?  How do they treat her?'
'Apparently they have not yet fed her on bread and water.  No;
seriously, I must confess that she looked uncommonly well and lovely!
Never mind, Jem; I verily believe that, in spite of absence and all
that, she had never been so happy in her life.  If any description
could convey the sweetness of voice and manner when she spoke of you! I
could not look in her face.  Those looks can only be for you.  We
talked it over, but she heeded no ways and means; it was enough that
you were satisfied.  She says the subject has never been broached since
the flight from Northwold, and that Lady Conway's kindness never
varies; and she told me she had little fear but that her dear mamma
would be prevailed on to give sanction enough to hinder her from
feeling as if she were doing wrong, or setting a bad example to her
sisters.  They know nothing of it; but Walter, who learnt it no one
knows how, draws the exemplary moral, that it serves his mother right
for inflicting a tutor on him.'
'Has she had my letter?  Does she know I am here?'
'Wait!  All this settled, and luncheon being ready, down came my Lady,
and we played unconsciousness to our best ability.  I must confess my
aunt beat us hollow!  Isabel then left us to our conference, which we
conducted with the gravity of a tailor and an old woman making a match
in Brittany.'
'You came out with that valuable improvable freehold, the Terrace, I
suppose?'
'I told the mere facts!  My aunt was rather grand about a
grammar-school; she said even a curacy would sound better, and she must
talk it over with Isabel.  I gave your letter, conjuring her to let
Isabel have it, and though she declared that it was no kindness, and
would put the poor darling into needless perplexity, she was touched
with my forbearance, in not having given it before, when I had such an
opportunity.  So she went away, and stayed a weary while: but when she
came, it was worth the waiting.  She said Isabel was old enough to know
her own mind, and the attachment being so strong, and you so
unexceptionable, she did not think it possible to object: she had great
delight in seeing you made happy, and fulfilling the dictates of her
own heart, now that it could be done with moderate prudence. They go to
Scarborough in a fortnight, and you will be welcome there. There's for
you!'
'Louis, you are the best fellow living!  But you said I was to see her
at once.'
'I asked, why wait for Scarborough?' and depicted you hovering
disconsolately round the precincts.  Never mind, Jem, I did not make
you more ridiculous than human nature must needs paint a lover, and it
was all to melt her heart.  I was starting off to fetch you, when I
found she was in great terror.  She had never told the Mansells of the
matter, and they must be prepared.  She cannot have it transpire while
she is in their house, and, in fact, is excessively afraid of Mr.
Mansell, and wants to tell her story by letter.  Now, I think,
considering all things, she has a right to take her own way.'
'You said I was not to go without meeting her!'
'I had assented, and was devising how to march off my lunatic quietly,
when the feminine goodnatured heart that is in her began to relent, and
she looked up in my face with a smile, and said the poor dears were
really exemplary, and if Isabel should walk to the beach and should
meet any one there, she need know nothing about it.'
'What says Isabel?'
'She held up her stately head, and thought it would be a better return
for Mr. Mansell's kindness to tell him herself before leaving
Beauchastel; but Lady Conway entreated her not to be hasty, and
protested that her fears were of Mr. Mansell's displeasure with her for
not having taken better care of her--she dreaded a break, and so
on,--till the end of it was, that though we agree that prudence would
carry us off to-morrow morning, yet her ladyship will look the other
way, if you happen to be on the southern beach at eleven o'clock
to-morrow morning.  I suppose you were very headlong and peremptory in
your note, for I could not imagine Isabel consenting to a secret tryste
even so authorized.'
'I never asked for any such thing!  I would not for worlds see her led
to do anything underhand.'
'She will honour you!  That's right, Jem!'
'Neither as a clergyman, nor as a Dynevor, can I consent to trick even
those who have no claim to her duty!'
'Neither as a gentleman, nor as a human creature,' added Louis, in the
same tone.  'Shall I go back and give your answer?'
'No; you are walking lame enough already.'
'No matter for that.'
'To tell you the truth, I can't stand your being with her again, while
I am made a fool of by that woman.  If I'm not to see her, I'll be off.
I'll send her a note; we will cross to Bickleypool, and start by the
mail-train this very night.'
Louis made no objection, and James hurried him into the little parlour,
where in ten minutes the note was dashed off:--
My Own Most Precious One!--(as, thanks to my most unselfish of cousins,
I may dare to call you,)--I regret my fervency and urgency for an
interview, since it led you to think I could purchase even such
happiness by a subterfuge unworthy of my calling, and an ill return of
the hospitality to which we owed our first meeting.  We will meet when
I claim you in the face of day, without the sense of stolen felicity,
which is a charm to common-place minds.  My glory is in the assurance
that you understand my letter, approve, and are relieved.  With such
sanction, and with ardour before you like mine, I see that you could do
no other than consent, and there is not a shadow of censure in my mind;
but if, without compromising your sense of obedience, you could openly
avow our engagement to Mr. Mansell, I own that I should feel that we
were not drawn into a compromise of sincerity.  What this costs me I
will not say; it will be bare existence till we meet at Scarborough.
'Your own, J. E. F. D.'
Having written this and deposited it in the Ebbscreek post-office,
James bethought himself that his submissive cousin had thrown himself
on the floor, with his bag for a pillow, trying to make the most of the
few moments of rest before the midnight journey.  Seized with
compunction, James exclaimed, 'There, old fellow, we will stay
to-night.'
'Thank you--' He was too sleepy for more.
The delay was recompensed.  James was trying to persuade Louis to rouse
himself to be revived by bread-and-cheese and beer, and could extort
nothing but a drowsy repetition of the rhyme, in old days the war-cry
of the Grammar-school against the present headmaster,--
'The Welshman had liked to be choked by a mouse,
But he pulled him out by the tail,'--
when an alarum came in the shape of a little grinning boy from
Beauchastel, with a note on which James had nearly laid hands, as he
saw the writing, though the address was to the Viscount Fitzjocelyn.
'You may have it,' said Louis.  'If anything were wanting, the
coincidence proves that you were cut out for one another.  I rejoice
that the moon does not stoop from her sphere.'
'My Dear Cousin,--I trust to you to prevent Mr. F. Dynevor from being
hurt or disappointed; and, indeed, I scarcely think he will, though I
should not avail myself of the permission for meeting him so kindly
intended.  I saw at once that you felt as I did, and as I know he will.
He would not like me to have cause to blush before my kind friends--to
know that I had acted a deceit, nor to set an example to my sisters for
which they might not understand the justification.  I know that you
will obtain my pardon, if needed; and to be assured of it, would be all
that would be required to complete the grateful happiness of
'Isabel.'
The boy had orders not to wait; and these being seconded by fears of
something that 'walked' in Ebbscreek wood after dark, he was gone
before an answer could be thought of.  It mattered the less, since
Isabel must receive James's note early in the morning; and so, in fact,
she did--and she was blushing over it, and feeling as if she could
never have borne to meet his eye but for the part she had fortunately
taken, when Louisa tapped at her door, with a message that Mr. Mansell
wished to speak with her, if she were ready.
She went down-stairs still in a glow; and her old friend's first words
were a compliment on her roses, so pointed, that she doubted for a
moment whether he did not think them suspicious, especially as he put
his hands behind his back, and paced up and down the room, for some
moments.  He then came towards her, and said, in a very kind tone,
'Isabel, my dear, I sent for you first, because I knew your own mother
very well, my dear; and though Lady Conway is very kind, and has always
done you justice,--that I will always say for her,--yet there are times
when it may make a difference to a young woman whether she has her own
mother or not.'
Isabel's heart was beating.  She was certain that some discovery had
been made, and longed to explain; but she was wise enough not to speak
in haste, and waited to see how the old gentleman would finally break
it to her.  He blundered on a little longer, becoming more confused and
distressed every minute, and at last came to the point abruptly.  'In
short, Isabel, my dear, what can you have done to set people saying
that you have been corresponding with the young men at Ebbscreek?'
'I sent a note to my cousin Fitzjocelyn last night,' said Isabel, with
such calmness, that the old gentleman fairly stood with his mouth open,
looking at her aghast.
'Fitzjocelyn!  Then it is Fitzjocelyn, is it?' he exclaimed.  'Then,
why could he not set about it openly and honourably?  Does his father
object?  I would not have thought it of you, Isabel, nor of the lad
neither!'
'You need not think it, dear Mr. Mansell.  There is nothing between
Lord Fitzjocelyn and myself but the warmest friendship.'
'Isabel!  Isabel! why are you making mysteries?  I do not wish to pry
into your affairs.  I would have trusted you anywhere; but when it
comes round to me that you have been sending a private messenger to one
of the young gentlemen there, I don't know what to be at!  I would not
believe Mrs. Mansell at first; but I saw the boy, and he said you had
sent him yourself.  My dear, you may mean, very rightly--I am sure you
do, but you must not set people talking!  It is not acting rightly by
me, Isabel; but I would not care for that, if it were acting rightly by
yourself.'  And he gazed at her with a piteous, perplexed expression.
'Let me call mamma,' said Isabel.
'As you will, my dear, but cannot you let the simple truth come out
between you and your own blood-relation, without all her words to come
between?  Can't you, Isabel?  I am sure you and I shall understand each
other.'
'That we shall,' replied Isabel, warmly.  'I have given her no promise.
Dear Mr. Mansell, I have wished all along that you should know that I
am engaged, with her full consent, to Mr. Frost Dynevor.'
'To the little black tutor!' cried Mr. Mansell, recoiling, but
recollecting himself.  'I beg your pardon, my dear, he may be a very
good man, but what becomes of all this scrambling over barricades with
the young Lord?'
Isabel described the true history of her engagement; and it was
received with a long, low whistle, by no means too complimentary.
'And what makes him come and hide in holes and corners, if this is all
with your mamma's good will?'
'Mamma thought you would be displeased; she insisted on taking her own
time for breaking it to you,' said Isabel.
'Was there ever a woman but must have her mystery?  Well, I should have
liked him better if he had not given into it!'
'He never did!' said Isabel, indignant enough to disclose in full the
whole arrangement made by Lady Conway's manoeuvres and lax good-nature.
'I knew it would never do,' she added, 'though I could not say so
before her and Fitzjocelyn.  My note was to tell them so: and look
here, Mr. Mansell, this is what Mr. Dynevor had already written before
receiving mine.'
She held it out proudly; and Mr. Mansell, making an unwilling sound
between his teeth, took it from her; but, as he read, his countenance
changed, and he exclaimed, 'Ha! very well!  This is something like! So
that's it, is it?  You and he would not combine to cheat the old man,
like a pair of lovers in a trumpery novel!'
'No, indeed!' said Isabel, 'that would be a bad way of beginning.'
'Where is the young fellow?--at Ebbscreek, did you say?  I'll tell you
what, Isabel,' with his hand on the bell, 'I'll have out the dogcart
this minute, and fetch him home to breakfast, to meet my Lady when she
comes down stairs, if it be only for the sake of showing that I like
plain dealing!'
'Isabel could only blush, smile, look doubtful, and yet so very happy
and grateful, that Mr. Mansell became cautious, lest his impulse should
have carried him too far, and, after having ordered the vehicle to be
prepared, he caught her by the hand, and detained her, saying, 'Mind
you, Miss, you are not to take this for over-much.  I'm afraid it is a
silly business, and I did not want you to throw yourself away on a
schoolmaster.  I must see and talk to the man myself; but I won't have
anything that's not open and above-board, and that my Lady shall see
for once in her life!'
'I'm not afraid,' said Isabel, smiling.  'James will make his own way
with you.'
Isabel ran away to excuse and explain her confession to Lady Conway;
while Mr. Mansell indulged in another whistle, and then went to inform
his wife that he was afraid the girl had been making a fool of herself;
but it was not Lady Conway's fault that she was nothing worse, and he
was resolved, whatever he did, to show that honesty was the only thing
that would go down with him.
The boat was rocking on the green waves, and Louis was in the act of
waving an adieu to deaf Mrs. Hannaford, when a huntsman's halloo caused
James to look round and behold Mr. Mansell standing up in his dogcart,
making energetic signals with his whip.
He had meant to be very guarded, and wait to judge of James before
showing that he approved, but the excitement of the chase betrayed him
into a glow of cordiality, and he shook hands with vehemence.
'That's right!--just in time!  Jump in, and come home to breakfast. So
you wouldn't be a party to my Lady's tricks!--just like her--just as
she wheedled poor Conway.  I will let her see how I esteem plain
dealing!  I don't say that I see my way through this business; but
we'll talk it over together, and settle matters without my Lady.'
James hardly knew where he was, between joy and surprise.  The
invitation was extended to his companion; but Fitzjocelyn discerned
that both James and Mr. Mansell would prefer being left to themselves;
he had a repugnance to an immediate discussion with the one aunt, and
was in haste to carry the tidings to the other: and besides, it was
becoming possible that letters might arrive from the travellers.
Actuated by all these motives, he declined the offer of hospitality,
and rowed across to Bickleypool, enlightening the Captain on the state
of affairs as far as he desired.
CHAPTER II.
THE THIRD TIME.
Tho' this was fair, and that was braw,
And you the toast of all the town,
I sighed and said, amang them a',
Ye are not Mary Morison.
BURNS.
Mrs. Frost and Louis were very merry over the result of Lady Conway's
stratagems, and sat up indulging in bright anticipations until so late
an hour, that Louis was compelled to relinquish his purpose of going
home that night, but he persisted in walking to Ormersfield before
breakfast, that he might satisfy himself whether there were any letters.
It was a brisk October morning, the sportsman's gun and whistle
re-echoing from the hill sides; where here and there appeared the dogs
careering along over green turnip-fields or across amber stubble. The
Little Northwold trees, in dark, sober tints of brown and purple, hung
over the grey wall, tinted by hoary lichen; and as Louis entered the
Ormersfield field paths, and plunged into his own Ferny dell, the long
grass and brackens hung over the path, weighed down with silvery dew,
and the large cavernous web of the autumnal spider was all one thick
flake of wet.
If he could not enter the ravine without thankfulness for his past
escape, neither could he forget gratitude to her who had come to his
relief from hopeless agony!  He quickened his pace, in the earnest
longing for tidings, which had seized him, even to heart sickness.
It was the reaction of the ardour and excitement that had so long
possessed him.  The victory had been gained--he had been obliged to
leave James to work in his own cause, and would be no longer wanted in
the same manner by his cousin.  The sense of loneliness, and of the
want of an object, came strongly upon him as he walked through the prim
old solitary garden, and looked up at the dreary windows of the house,
almost reluctant to enter, as long as it was without Mary's own serene
atmosphere of sympathy and good sense, her precious offices of love,
her clear steady eyes, even in babyhood his trustworthy counsellors.
Was it a delusion of fancy, acting on reflections in the glass, that,
as he mounted the steps from the lawn, depicted Mary's figure through
the dining-room windows?  Nay, the table was really laid for
breakfast--a female figure was actually standing over the tea-chest.
'A scene from the Vicar of Wakefield deluding me,' decided Louis,
advancing to the third window, which was open.
It was Mary Ponsonby.
'Mary!'
'You here?--They said you were not at home!'
'My father!--Where?'
'He is not come down.  He is as well as possible.  We came at eleven
last night.  I found I was not wanted,' added Mary, with a degree of
agitation, that made him conclude that she had lost her father.
One step he made to find the Earl, but too much excited to move away or
to stand still, he came towards her, wrung her hand in a more real way
than in his first bewildered surprise, and exclaimed in transport, 'O
Mary! Mary! to have you back again!' then, remembering his inference,
added, low and gravely, 'It makes me selfish--I was not thinking of
your grief.'
'Never mind,' said Mary, smiling, though her eyes overflowed, 'I must
be glad to be at home again, and such a welcome as this--'
'O Mary, Mary!' he cried, nearly beside himself, 'I have not known what
to do without you!  You will believe it now, won't you?'--oh, won't
you?'
Mary would have been a wonderful person had she not instantly and
utterly forgotten all her conclusions from Frampton's having declared
him gone to Beauchastel for an unlimited time; but all she did was to
turn away her crimson tearful face, and reply, 'Your father would not
wish it now.'
'Then the speculations have failed?  So much the better!'
'No, no! he must tell you--'
She was trying to withdraw her hand, when Lord Ormersfield opened the
door, and in the moment of his amazed 'Louis!' Mary had fled.
'What is it? oh! what is it, father? cried Louis for all greeting, 'why
can she say you would not wish it now?'
'Wish it? wish what?' asked the Earl, without the intuitive perception
of the meaning of the pronoun.
'What you have always wished--Mary and me--What is the only happiness
that life can offer me!'
'If I wished it a year ago, I could only wish it the more now,' said
the Earl.  'But how is this?--I fully believed you committed to Miss
Conway.'
'Miss Conway!  Miss Conway!' burst out Louis, in a frenzy.  'Because
Jem Frost was in love with her himself, he fancied every one else must
be the same, and now he will be married to her before Christmas, so
that's disposed of.  As to my feeling for her a particle, a shred of
what I do for Mary, it was a mere fiction--a romance, an impossibility.'
'I do not understand you, Louis. Why did you not find this out before?'
'Mrs. Ponsonby called it my duty to test my feelings, and I have tested
them.  That one is a beautiful poet's dream.  Mary is a woman, the only
woman I can ever love.  Not an hour but I have felt it, and now,
father, what does she mean?'
'She means, poor girl, what only her own scrupulous delicacy could
regard as an objection, but what renders me still more desirous to have
a right to protect her.  The cause of our return--'
'How?  I thought her father was dead.'
'Far worse.  At Valparaiso we met Robson, the confidential agent.  I
learnt from him that Mr. Ponsonby had hardly waited for her mother's
death to marry a Limenian, a person whom everything pointed out as
unfit to associate with his daughter.  Even Robson, cautious as he was,
said he could not undertake to recommend Miss Ponsonby to continue her
journey.'
'And this was all?' exclaimed Louis, too intent on his own views for
anything but relief.
'All?  Is it not enough to set her free?  She acquiesced in my judgment
that she could do no otherwise than return.  She wrote to her father,
and I sent three lines to inform him that, under the circumstances, I
fulfilled my promise to her mother by taking her home.  I had nearly
made her promise that, should we find you about to form an
establishment of your own, she would consider herself as my child;
but--'
'Oh, father! how shall we make her believe you care nothing for her
scruple?  The wretched man!  But--oh! where is she?'
'It does not amount to a scruple in her case,' deliberately resumed the
Earl.  'I always knew what Ponsonby was, and nothing from him could
surprise me--even such an outrage on feeling and decency. Besides, he
has effectually shut himself out of society, and degraded himself
beyond the power of interfering with you.  For the rest, Mary is
already, in feeling, so entirely my child, that to have the right to
call her so has always been my fondest wish.  And, Louis, the months I
have spent with her have not diminished my regard.  My Mary! she will
have a happier lot than her mother!'
The end of the speech rewarded Louis for the conflict by which he had
kept himself still to listen to the beginning.  Lord Ormersfield had
pity on him, and went in search of Mary; while he, remembering former
passages, felt that his father might be less startling and more
persuasive, but began to understand what James must have suffered in
committing his affairs to another.
The Earl found Mary in what had been her mother's sitting-room,
striving to brace her resolution by recalling the conversation that had
taken place there on a like occasion.  But alas! how much more the
heart had now to say!  How much it felt as if the only shelter or rest
in the desolate world was in the light of the blue eyes whose tender
sunshine had been on her for one instant!
Yet she began firmly--'If you please, would you be so kind as to let me
go to Aunt Melicent?'
'By-and-by, my dear, when you think fit.'
'Oh, then, at once, and without seeing any one, please!'
'Nay, Mary,' with redoubled gentleness, 'there is one who cannot let
you go without seeing him.  Mary, you will not disappoint my poor boy
again.  You will let him be an amendment in my scheme.'
'You have been always most kind to me, but you cannot really like this.'
'You forget that it has been my most ardent wish from the moment I saw
you what only your mother's child could be.'
'That was before-- No, I ought not!  Yours is not a family to bring
disgrace into.'
'I cannot allow you to speak thus.  I knew your trials at home when
first I wished you to be my son's wife, and my opinion is unchanged,
except by my increased wish to have the first claim to you.'
'Lord Ormersfield,' said Mary, collecting herself 'only one thing. Tell
me, as if we were indifferent persons, is this a connexion such as
would do Louis any harm?  I trust you to answer.'
He paced along the room, and she tried to control her trembling.  He
came back and spoke: No, Mary.  If he were a stranger, I should give
the same advice.  Your father's own family is unexceptionable; and
those kind of things, so far off--few will ever hear of them, and no
one will attach consequence to them.  If that be your only scruple, it
does you infinite credit; but I can entirely remove it.  What might be
an injury to you, single, would be of comparatively little importance
to him.'
'Miss Conway,' faltered Mary, who could never remember her, when in
Louis's presence.
'A mere delusion, of our own.  There was nothing in it.  He calls you
the only woman who can make him happy, as I always knew you were.  He
must explain all.  You will come to him, my dear child.'
Mary resisted no more; he led her down stairs, and left her within the
dining-room door.
'Mary, you will now--' was all Louis said; but she let him draw her
into his arms, and she rested against his breast, as when he had come
to comfort her in the great thunderstorm in auld lang-syne.  She felt
herself come at length to the shelter and repose for which her heart
had so long yearned, in spite of her efforts, and as if the world had
nothing more to offer of peace or joy.
'Oh, Mary, how I have wanted you!  You believe in me now!'
'I am sure mamma would!' murmured Mary.
He could have poured forth a torrent of affection, but the suspicion of
a footstep made her start from him; and the next moment she was
herself, glowing, indeed, and half crying with happiness, but alarmed
at her own agitation, and struggling to resume her common-place manner.
'There's your father not had a morsel of breakfast!' she exclaimed,
hurrying back to her teacups, whose ringing betrayed her trembling
hand.  'Call him, Louis.'
'Must I go?' said Louis, coming to assist in a manner that threatened
deluge and destruction.
'Oh yes, go!  I shall be able to speak to you when you come back.'
He had only to go into the verandah.  His father was watching at the
library window, and they wrung each other's hand in gladness beyond
utterance.
Mary had seated herself in the solid stately chair, with the whole
entrenchment of tea equipage before her.  They knew it signified that
she was to be unmolested; they took their places, and the Earl carved
ham, and Louis cut bread, and Mary poured out tea in the most
matter-of-fact manner, hazarding nothing beyond such questions as, 'May
I give you an egg?'
Then curiosity began to revive: Louis ventured, 'Where did you land?'
and his father made answer, 'At Liverpool, yesterday,' and how the
Custom-house had detained them, and he had, therefore, brought Mary
straight home, instead of stopping with her at Northwold, at eleven
o'clock, to disturb Mrs. Frost.
'You would have found us up,' said Louis.
'You were sleeping at the Terrace?'
'Yes, I walked here this morning.'
'Then your ankle must be pretty well,' was Mary's first contribution to
the conversation.
'Quite well for all useful purposes,' said Louis, availing himself of
the implied permission to turn towards her.
'But, Louis,' suddenly exclaimed the Earl, 'did you not tell me
something extraordinary about James Frost?  Whom did you say he was
going to marry?'
'Isabel Conway.'
Never was his love of electrifying more fully gratified!  Lord
Ormersfield was surprised into an emphatic interjection, and inquiry
whether they were all gone mad.
'Not that I am aware of,' said Louis.  'Perhaps you have not heard that
Mr. Lester is going to retire, and Jem has the school?'
'Then, it must be Calcott and the trustees who are out of their senses.'
'Do you not consider it an excellent appointment?'
'It might be so some years hence,' said the Earl.  'I am afraid it will
tie him down to a second-rate affair, when he might be doing better;
and the choice is the last thing I should have expected from Calcott.'
'He opposed it.  He wanted to bring in a very ordinary style of person,
from ---- School, but Jem's superiority and the general esteem for my
aunt carried the day.'
'What did Ramsbotham and his set do?'
'They were better than could have been hoped; they gave us their votes
when they found their man could not get in.'
'Ha?  As long as that fellow is against Calcott, he cares little whom
he supports.  I am sorry that Calcott should be defeated, even for
James's sake.  How did Richardson vote?'
'He was doubtful at first, but I brought him over.'
Lord Ormersfield gave a quick, searching glance as he said,' James
Frost did not make use of our interest in this matter.'
'Jem never did.  He and my aunt held back, and were unwilling to oppose
the Squire.  They would have given it up, but for me.  Father, I never
supposed you could be averse to my doing my utmost for Jem, when all
his prospects were at stake.'
'I should have imagined that James was too well aware of my sentiments
to allow it.'
What a cloud on the happy morning!
Louis eagerly exclaimed: 'James is the last person to be blamed!  He
and my aunt were always trying to stop me, but I would not listen to
their scruples.  I knew his happiness depended on his success, and I
worked for him, in spite of himself.  If I did wrong, I can only be
very sorry; but I cannot readily believe that I transgressed by setting
the question before people in a right light.  Only, whose fault soever
it was, it was not Jem's.'
Lord Ormersfield had not the heart to see one error in his son on such
a day as this, more especially as Mary peeped out behind the urn to
judge of his countenance, and he met her pleading eyes, swimming in
tears.
'No, I find no fault,' he kindly said.  'Young, ardent spirits may be
excused for outrunning the bounds that their elders might impose. But
you have not removed my amazement.  James intending to marry on the
grammar-school!--it cannot be worth 300 pounds a year.'
'Isabel is satisfied.  She never desired anything but a quiet, simple,
useful life.'
'Your Aunt Catharine delighted, of course?  No doubt of that; but what
has come to Lady Conway?'
'She cannot help it, and makes the best of it.  She gave us very little
trouble.'
'Ah! her own daughter is growing up,' said the Earl, significantly.
'Isabel is very fond of Northwold,' said Mary, feeling that Louis was
wanting her sympathy.  'She used to wish she could settle there--with
how little consciousness!'
'If I had to judge in such a case,' said Lord Ormersfield,
thoughtfully, 'I should hesitate to risk a woman's happiness with a
temper such as that of James Frost.'
'Oh, father!' cried Louis, indignantly.
'I suspect,' said Lord Ormersfield, smiling, 'that of late years,
James's temper has been more often displayed towards me than towards
you.'
'A certain proof how safe his wife will be,' returned Louis.
His father shook his head, and looking from one to the other of the
young people, congratulated himself that here, at least, there were no
perils of that description.  He asked how long the attachment had
existed.
'From the moment of first sight,' said Louis; 'the fine spark was
lighted on the Euston Square platform; and it was not much later with
her.  He filled up her beau ideal of goodness--'
'And, in effect, all Lady Conway's pursuit of you threw them together,'
said Lord Ormersfield, much entertained.
'Lady Conway has been their very best friend, without intending it. It
would not have come to a crisis by this time, if she had not taken me
to Paris.  It would have been a pity if the catastrophe of the
barricades had been all for nothing.'
Lord Ormersfield and Mary here broke out in amazement at themselves,
for having hitherto been oblivious of the intelligence that had greeted
them on their first arrival, when Frampton had informed them of Lord
Fitzjocelyn's wound and gallant conduct, and his father had listened to
the story like the fastening of a rivet in Miss Conway's chains, and
Mary with a flush of unselfish pride that Isabel had been taught to
value her hero.  They both claimed the true and detailed account, as if
they had hitherto been defrauded of it, and insisted on hearing what
had happened to him.
'I dare say you know best,' said Louis, lazily.  'I have heard so many
different accounts of late, that I really am beginning to forget which
is the right one, and rather incline to the belief that Delaford
brought a rescue or two with his revolver, and carried us into a
fortress where my aunt had secured the windows with feather-beds--'
'You had better make haste and tell, that the true edition may be
preserved,' said Mary, rallying her spirits in her eagerness.
'I have begun to understand why there never yet has been an authentic
account of a great battle,' said Louis.  'Life would make me coincide
with Sir Robert Walpole's judgment on history.  All I am clear about
is, that even a Red Republican is less red than he is painted; that
Isabel Conway is fit to visit the sentinels in a beleaguered castle--a
noble being-- But oh, Mary! did I not long sorely after you when it
came to the wounded knight part of the affair!  I am more sure of that
than of anything else!'
Mary blushed, but her tender heart was chiefly caring to know how much
he had been hurt, and so the whole story was unfolded by due
questioning; and the Earl had full and secret enjoyment of the signal
defeat of his dear sister-in-law, the one satisfaction on which every
one seemed agreed.
It was a melancholy certainty that Mary must go to Mrs. Frost, but the
Earl deferred the moment by sending the carriage with an entreaty that
she would come herself to fetch her guest.  Mary talked of writing a
note; but the autumn sun shone cheerily on the steps, and Louis wiled
her into seating herself on the upper step, while he reclined on the
lower ones, as they had so often been placed when this was his only way
of enjoying the air.  The sky was clear, the air had the still calm of
autumn, the evergreens and the yellow-fringed elms did not stir a
leaf--only a large heavy yellow plane leaf now and then detached itself
by its own weight and silently floated downwards.  Mary sat, without
wishing to utter a word to disturb the unwonted tranquillity, the rest
so precious after her months of sea-voyage, her journey, her
agitations.  But Louis wanted her seal of approval to all his past
doings, and soon began on their inner and deeper story, ending with,
'Tell me whether you think I was right, my own dear governess--'
'Oh no, you must never call me that any more.'
'It is a name belonging to my happiest days.'
'It was only in play.  It reverses the order of things.  I must look up
to you.'
'If you can!' said Louis, playfully, slipping down to a lower step.
A tear burst out as Mary said, 'Mamma said it must never be that way.'
Then recovering, she added, 'I beg your pardon, Louis; I was treating
it as earnest.  I think I am not quite myself to-day, I will go to my
room!'
'No, no, don't,' he said; 'I will not harass you with my gladness,
dearest.'  He stepped in-doors, brought out a book, and when Mrs. Frost
arrived to congratulate and be congratulated, she found Mary still on
the step, gazing on without seeing the trees and flowers, listening
without attending to the rich, soothing flow of Lope de Vega's
beautiful devotional sonnets, in majestic Spanish, in Louis's low,
sweet voice.
CHAPTER III.
MISTS.
Therefore thine eye through mist of many days
Shines bright; and beauty, like a lingering rose,
Sits on thy cheek, and in thy laughter plays;
While wintry frosts have fallen on thy foes,
And, like a vale that breathes the western sky,
Thy heart is green, though summer is gone by.
F. TENNYSON.
Happy Aunt Kitty!--the centre, the confidante of so much love! Perhaps
her enjoyment was the most keen and pure of all, because the most free
from self--the most devoid of those cares for the morrow, which, after
besetting middle life, often so desert old age as to render it as free
and fresh as childhood.  She had known the worst: she had been borne
through by heart-whole faith and love, she had seen how often frettings
for the future were vain, and experienced that anticipation is worse
than reality.  Where there was true affection and sound trust, she
could not, would not, and did not fear for those she loved.
James went backwards and forwards in stormy happiness.  He had come to
a comfortable understanding with old Mr. Mansell, who had treated him
with respect and cordiality from the first, giving him to understand
that Isabel's further expectations only amounted to a legacy of a
couple of thousands on his own death, and that meantime he had little
or no hope of helping him in his profession.  He spoke of Isabel's
expensive habits, and the danger of her finding it difficult to adapt
herself to a small income; and though, of course, he might as well have
talked to the wind as to either of the lovers, his remonstrance was so
evidently conscientious as not to be in the least offensive, and Mr.
Frost Dynevor was graciously pleased to accept him as a worthy relation.
All was smooth likewise with Lady Conway.  She and Mr. Mansell
outwardly appeared utterly unconscious of each other's proceedings,
remained on the most civil terms, and committed their comments and
explanations to Mrs. Mansell, who administered them according to her
own goodnatured, gossiping humour, and sided with whichever was
speaking to her.  There was in Lady Conway much kindness and
good-humour, always ready to find satisfaction in what was inevitable,
and willing to see all at ease and happy around her--a quality which
she shared with Louis, and which rendered her as warm and even
caressing to 'our dear James' as if he had been the most welcome suitor
in the world; and she often sincerely congratulated herself on the
acquisition of a sensible gentleman to consult on business, and so
excellent a brother for Walter.  It was not falsehood, it was real
amiability; and it was an infinite comfort in the courtship, especially
the courtship of a Pendragon.  As to the two young sisters, their
ecstasy was beyond description, only alloyed by the grief of losing
Isabel, and this greatly mitigated by schemes of visits to Northwold.
The marriage was fixed for the end of November, so as to give time for
a little tranquillity before the commencement of James's new duties.
As soon as this intelligence arrived, Mrs. Frost removed herself, Mary,
and her goods into the House Beautiful, that No. 5 might undergo the
renovations which, poor thing! had been planned twenty years since,
when poor Henry's increasing family and growing difficulties had
decided her that she could 'do without them' one year more.
'Even should Miss Conway not like to keep house with the old woman,'
said she, by way of persuading herself she had no such expectation, 'it
was her duty to keep the place in repair.'
That question was soon at rest: Isabel would be but too happy to be
allowed to share her home, and truly James would hardly have attached
himself to a woman who could not regard it as a privilege to be with
the noble old lady.  Clara was likewise to be taken home; Isabel
undertook to complete her education, and school and tuition were both
to be removed from the contemplation of the happy girl, whose letters
had become an unintelligible rhapsody of joy and affection.
Isabel had three thousand pounds of her own, which, with that valuable
freehold, Dynevor Terrace, James resolved should be settled on herself,
speaking of it with such solemn importance as to provoke the gravity of
those accustomed to deal with larger sums.  With the interest of her
fortune he meant to insure his life, that, as he told Louis, with
gratified prudence, there might be no repetition of his own case, and
his family might never be a burden on any one.
The income of the school, with their former well-husbanded means, was
affluence for the style to which he aspired; and his grandmother,
though her menus plaisirs had once doubled her present revenue,
regarded it as the same magnificent advance, and was ready to launch
into the extravagance of an additional servant, and of fitting up the
long-disused drawing-room, and the dining-parlour, hitherto called the
school-room, and kicked and hacked by thirty years of boys.  She and
Clara would betake themselves to their present little sitting-room, and
make the drawing-room pleasant and beautiful for the bride.
And in what a world of upholstery did not the dear old lady spend the
autumn months!  How surpassingly happy was Jane, and how communicative
about Cheveleigh! and how pleased and delighted in little Charlotte's
promotion!
And Charlotte!  She ought to have been happy, with her higher wages and
emancipation from the more unpleasant work, with the expectation of one
whom she admired so enthusiastically as Miss Conway, and, above all,
with the long, open-hearted, affectionate letter, which Miss Ponsonby
had put into her hand with so kind a smile.  Somehow, it made her do
nothing but cry; she felt unwilling to sit down and answer it; and, as
if it were out of perverseness, when she was in Mrs. Martha's very
house, and when there was so much to be done, she took the most violent
fit of novel-reading that had ever been known; and when engaged in
working or cleaning alone, chanted dismal ballads of the type of
'Alonzo the brave and the fair Imogens,' till Mrs. Martha declared that
she was just as bad as an old dumbledore, and not worth half so much.
One day, however, Miss Ponsonby called her into her room, to tell her
that a parcel was going to Lima, in case she wished to send anything by
it.  Miss Ponsonby spoke so kindly, and yet so delicately, and
Charlotte blushed and faltered, and felt that she must write now!
'I have been wishing to tell you, Charlotte,' added Mary, kindly, 'how
much we like Mr. Madison.  There were some very undesirable people
among the passengers, who might easily have led him astray; but the
captain and mate both spoke to Lord Ormersfield in the highest terms of
his behaviour.  He never missed attending prayers on the Sundays; and,
from all I could see, I do fully believe that he is a sincerely good,
religions man; and, if he keeps on as he has begun, I think you are
very happy in belonging to him.'
Charlotte only curtsied and thanked; but it was wonderful how those
kind, sympathizing words blew off at once the whole mists of nonsense
and fancy.  Tom was the sound, good, religious man to whom her heart
and her troth were given; the other was no such thing, a mere
flatterer, and she had known it all along.  She would never think of
him again, and she was sure he would not think of her.  Truth had
dispelled all the fancied sense of hypocrisy and double-dealing: she
sat down and wrote to Tom as if Delaford had never existed, and
forthwith returned to be herself again, at least for the present.
Poor Mary! she might speak cheerfully, but her despatches were made up
with a trembling heart.  Louis and Mary missed the security and
felicity that seemed so perfect with James and Isabel.  In the first
place, nothing could be fixed without further letters, although the
Earl had tried to persuade Mary that her father had virtually forfeited
all claim to her obedience, and that she ought to proceed as if in fact
an orphan, and secure herself from being harassed by him, by hastening
her marriage.  Of this she would not hear, and she was exceedingly
grateful to Louis for abstaining from pressing her, as well as for
writing to Mr. Ponsonby in terms against which no exception could be
taken.
Till secure of his consent, she would not consider her engagement as
more than conditional, nor consent to its being mentioned to any one.
If Isabel knew it, that was James's fault.   Even the Faithfull sisters
were kept in ignorance; and she trusted thus to diminish the wrong that
she felt her secrecy to be doing to Aunt Melicent, who was so much
vexed and annoyed at her return, that she dreaded exceedingly the
effect of the knowledge of her engagement.  Miss Ponsonby was convinced
that the news had been exaggerated, and insisted that but for Lord
Ormersfield's dislike, it would have been further sifted; and she wrote
to Mary to urge her coming to her to await the full tidings, instead of
delaying among her father's avowed enemies.
Mary settled this point by mentioning her promise to Mrs. Frost to
remain with her until her grandchildren should be with her; and Miss
Ponsonby's correspondence ceased after a dry, though still kind letter,
which did not make Mary more willing to bestow her confidence, but left
her feeling in her honest heart as if she were dealing insincerely by
Aunt Melicent.
The discretion and reserve rendered requisite by the concealment were
such as to be very tormenting even to so gentle a temper as that of
Louis, since they took from him all the privileges openly granted to
the cousin, and scarcely left him those of the friend.  She, on whose
arm he had leant all last summer, would not now walk with him without
an escort, and, even with Mrs. Frost beside her, shrank from
Ormersfield like forbidden ground.  Her lively, frank tone of playful
command had passed away; nay, she almost shrank from his confidence,
withheld her counsel, and discouraged his constant visits.  He could
not win from her one of her broad, fearless comments on his past
doings; and in his present business, the taking possession of
Inglewood, the choice of stock, and the appointment of a bailiff,
though she listened and sympathized, and answered questions, she
volunteered no opinions, ahe expressed no wishes, she would not come to
see.
Poor Louis was often mortified into doubts of his own ability to
interest or make her happy; but he was very patient.  If disappointed
one day, he was equally eager the next; he submitted obediently to her
restrictions, and was remorseful when he forgot or transgressed; and
they had real, soothing, comforting talks just often enough to be
tantalizing, and yet to convince him that all the other unsatisfactory
meetings and partings were either his own fault, or that of some
untoward circumstance.
He saw, as did the rest, that Mary's spirits had received a shock not
easily to be recovered.  The loss of her mother was weighing on her
more painfully than in the first excitement; and the step her father
had taken, insulting her mother, degrading himself, and rending away
her veil of filial honour, had exceedingly overwhelmed and depressed
her; while sorrow hung upon her with the greater permanence and
oppression from her strong self-control, and dislike to manifestation.
All this he well understood; and, reverent to her feeling, he laid
aside all trifling, and waited on her mood with the tenderest
watchfulness.  When she could bear it, they would dwell together on the
precious recollections of her mother; and sometimes she could even
speak of her father, and relate instances of his affection for herself,
and all his other redeeming traits of character; most thankful to Louis
for accepting him on her word, and never uttering one word of him which
she could wish unsaid.
What Louis did not see, was that the very force of her own affection
was what alarmed Mary, and caused her reserve.  To a mind used to
balance and regulation, any sensation so mighty and engrossing appeared
wrong; and repressed as her attachment had been, it was the more
absorbing now that he was all that was left to her.  Admiration,
honour, gratitude, old childish affection, and caressing elder-sisterly
protection, all flowed in one deep, strong current; but the very depth
made her diffident.  She could imagine the whole reciprocated, and she
feared to be importunate.  If the day was no better than a weary
turmoil, save when his voice was in her ear, his eyes wistfully bent on
her, the more carefully did she restrain all expression of hope of
seeing him to-morrow, lest she should be exacting and detain him from
projects of his own.  If it was pride and delight to her to watch his
graceful, agile figure spring on horseback, she would keep herself from
the window, lest he should feel oppressed by her pursuing him; and when
she found her advice sought after as his law, she did not venture to
proffer it.  She was uncomfortable in finding the rule committed to
her, and all the more because Lord Ormersfield, who had learnt to talk
to her so openly that she sometimes thought he confounded her with her
mother, used in all his schemes to appear to take it for granted that
she should share with him in the managing, consulting headship of the
house, leaving Louis as something to be cared for and petted like a
child, without a voice in their decisions.  These conversations used to
make her almost jealous on Louis's account, and painfully recall some
of her mother's apprehensions.
That was the real secret source of all her discomfort--namely, the
misgiving lest she had been too ready to follow the dictates of her own
heart.  Would her mother have been satisfied?  Had not her fondness and
her desolation prevailed, where, for Louis's own sake, she should have
held back!  Every time she felt herself the elder in heart, every time
she feared to have disappointed him, every time she saw that his
liveliness was repressed by her mournfulness, she feared that she was
letting him sacrifice himself.  And still more did she question her
conduct towards her father.  She had only gradually become aware of the
extent of the mutual aversion between him and the Earl; and Miss
Ponsonby's reproaches awakened her to the fear that she had too lightly
given credence to hostile evidence.  Her affection would fain have
justified him; and, forgetting the difficulties of personal
investigation in such a case, she blamed herself for having omitted
herself to question the confidential clerk, and having left all to Lord
Ormersfield, who, cool and wary as he ordinarily was, would be less
likely to palliate Mr. Ponsonby's errors than those of any other
person.  Her heart grew sick as she counted the weeks ere she could
hear from Lima.
None of her troubles were allowed to interfere with Mrs. Frost's peace.
Outwardly, she was cheerful and helpful; equable, though less lively.
Those carpets and curtains, tables and chairs, which were the grand
topics at the House Beautiful, were neither neglected nor treated with
resigned impatience.  Mary's taste, counsel, and needle did good
service; her hearty interest and consideration were given to the
often-turned volume of designs for bedsteads, sofas, and
window-curtains; and Miss Mercy herself had hardly so many resources
for making old furniture new.  Many of her happiest half-hours with
Louis were spent as she sewed the stiff slippery chintz, and he held
the curtain rings, while Aunt Catharine went to inspect the workmen,
and many a time were her cares forgotten, and her active spirits
resumed, while Louis acted carpenter under her directions, and
rectified errors of the workmen.  It might not be poetical, but the
French sky-blue paper, covered with silvery fern-leaves, that Louis
took such pains to procure, and the china door-handles that he brought
over in his pockets, and the great map which Mary pasted over the
obstinate spot of damp in the vestibule, were the occasions of the
greatest blitheness and merriment that they shared together.  Much did
they enjoy the prediction that James would not know his own house;
greatly did they delight in sowing surprises, and in obtaining Aunt
Catharine's never-failing start of well-pleased astonishment.  Each
wedding present was an event;--Mr. Mansell's piano, which disconcerted
all previous designs; Lord Ormersfield's handsome plate; and many a
minor gift from old scholars, delighted to find an occasion when an
offering would not be an offence.  Even Mr. Calcott gave a valuable
inkstand, in which Mrs. Frost and Louis beheld something of forgiveness.
Isabel had expressed a wish that Mary should be one of her bridesmaids.
A wedding was not the scene which poor Mary wished to witness at
present; but she saw Louis bent on having her with him, and would not
vex him by reluctance.  He had also prevailed on his father to be
present, though the Earl was much afraid of establishing a precedent,
and being asked to act the part of father on future contingencies.
There was only one bride, as he told Louis, whom he could ever wish to
give away.  However, that trouble was spared him by Mr. Mansell; but
still Louis would not let him off, on the plea that James's side of the
house should make as imposing a demonstration as possible.
Mrs. Frost was less manageable.  Though warmly invited by the Conways,
and fondly entreated by her grandson, she shook her head, and said she
was past those things, and that the old mother always stayed at home to
cook the wedding dinner.  She should hear all when Clara came home the
next day, and should be ready for the happy pair when they would return
for Christmas, after a brief stay at Thornton Conway, which Isabel
wished James to see, that he might share in all her old associations.
All the rest of the party journeyed to London on a November day; and,
in gaslight and gloom, they deposited Mary at her aunt's house in
Bryanston Square.
Gaslight was the staple of Hymen's torch the next morning.  London was
under one of the fogs, of which it is popularly said you may cut them
with a knife.  The church was in dim twilight; the bride and bridegroom
loomed through the haze, and the indistinctness made Clara's fine tall
figure appear quite majestic above the heads of the other bridesmaids.
The breakfast was by lamp-light, and the mist looked lurid and grim
over the white cake, and no one talked of anything but the comparative
density of fogs; and Mr. Mansell's asthma had come on, and his speech
was devolved upon Lord Ormersfield, to whom Louis had imprudently
promised exemption.
What was worse, Lady Conway had paired them off in the order of
precedence; and Louis was a victim to two dowagers, between whom he
could neither see nor speak to Mary.  He was the more concerned,
because he had thought her looking depressed and avoiding his eye.
He tried to believe this caution, but he thought she was also eluding
his father, and her whole air gave him a vague uneasiness.  The whole
party were to dine with Lady Conway; and, trusting in the meantime to
discover what was on her spirits, he tried to resign himself to the
order of the day, without a farther glimpse of her.
When the married pair took leave, Walter gave his sister a great hug,
but had no perception of his office of handing her downstairs; and it
was Fitzjocelyn who gave her his arm, and put her into the carriage,
with an augury that the weather would be beautiful when once they had
left the fog in London.
She smiled dreamily, and repeated, 'beautiful,' as though all were so
beautiful already to her that she did not so much as perceive the fog.
James pressed his hand, saying, 'I am glad you are to be the one to be
happy next.'
'You do not look so,' said Clara, earnestly.
The two sisters had come partly downstairs, but their London habits had
restrained them from following to the street-door, as Clara had done;
and now they had rushed up again, while Clara, with one foot on the
staircase, looked in her cousin's face, as he tried to smile in answer,
and repeated, 'Louis, I hoped you were quite happy.'
'I am,' said Louis, quickly.
'Then why do you look so grave and uneasy?'
'Louis!' said an entreating voice above, and there stood Mary--'Pray
say nothing, but call a cab for me, please.  No, I am not ill--indeed,
I am not--but I cannot stay!'
'You look ill!  It has been too much for you!  Clara, take her--let her
lie down quietly,' cried Louis, springing to her side.
'Oh no, thank you-no,' said Mary, decidedly, though very low; 'I told
Lady Conway that I could not stay.  I settled it with Aunt Melicent.'
'That aunt of yours--'
'Hush!  No, it is for my own sake--my own doing.  I cannot bear it any
longer!  Please let me go!'
'Then I will take you.  I saw the brougham waiting.  We will go quietly
together.'
'No, that must not be.'
'I was thoughtless in urging you to come.  The turmoil has been too
much.  My poor Mary!  That is what comes of doing what I like instead
of what you like.  Why don't you always have your own way?  Let me
come; nay, if you will not, at least let Clara go with you, and come
back.'
Mary roused herself at last to speak, as she moved downstairs--'You
need not think of me; there is nothing the matter with me.  I promised
Aunt Melicent to come home.  She is very kind--it is not that.'
'You must not tell me not to think.  I shall come to inquire.  I shall
be with you the first thing tomorrow.'
'Yes, you must come to-morrow,' said Mary, in a tone he could not
interpret, and a tight lingering grasp on his hand, as he put her into
his father's carriage.
He stood hesitating for a moment as it drove off; then, instead of
entering the house, walked off quickly in the same direction.
Clara had stood all the time like a statue on the stairs, waiting to
see if she were wanted, and gazing intently, with her fingers clasped.
When both were gone she drew a long breath, and nodded with her head,
whispering to herself, in a grave and critical voice--'That is love!'
She did not see Fitzjocelyn again till nearly dinner-time; and, as he
caught her anxious interrogating eye, he came to her and said, very
low, 'I was not let in; Miss Ponsonby was engaged.  Miss Mary lying
down--I believe they never told her I was there.'
'It is all that aunt--horrid woman!'
'Don't talk of it now.  I will see her to-morrow.'
Clara grieved for him whenever she saw him called on to exert himself
to talk; and she even guarded him from the sallies of his young
cousins.  Once, when much music and talk was going on, he came and sat
by her, and made her tell him how fondly and affectionately she had
parted with her schoolfellows; and how some of her old foes had become,
as she hoped, friends for life; but she saw his eye fixed and absent
even while she spoke, and she left off suddenly.  'Go on,' he said, 'I
like to hear;' and with a manifest effort he bent his mind to attend.
'Oh!' thought Clara, as she went up that night--'why will the days one
most expects to be happy turn out so much otherwise?  However, he will
manage to tell me all about it when he and his father take me home
to-morrow.'
CHAPTER IV.
OUTWARD BOUND.
The voice which I did more esteem
Than music in her sweetest key--
Those eyes which unto me did seem
More comfortable than the day--
Those now by me, as they have been,
Shall never more be heard or seen.
GEORGE WITHER.
In suspense and impatience, Fitzjocelyn awaited the end of his father's
breakfast, that he might hasten to learn what ailed Mary. The post came
in, vexing him at first merely as an additional delay, but presently a
sound of dissatisfaction attracted his notice to the foreign air of two
envelopes which had been forwarded from home.
'Hem!' said the Earl, gravely, 'I am afraid this fellow Ponsonby will
give us some trouble.'
'Then Mary had heard from him!' cried Louis.  'She was keeping it from
me, not to spoil the day.  I must go to her this moment--'but pausing
again, 'What is it?  He cannot have had my letter!'
'No, but he seems to have anticipated it.  Puffed up as they are about
these speculations, he imagines me to have brought Mary home for no
purpose but to repair our fortunes; and informs me that, in the event
of your marriage, she will receive not a farthing beyond her mother's
settlements.  I am much obliged!  It is all I ever thought you would
receive; and but for me, it would have been in the bottom of some mine
long ago!  Do you wish to see what he says?'
Louis caught up the missive.  It was the letter of a very angry man,
too violent to retain the cold formality which he tried to assume. 'He
was beholden to his lordship for his solicitude about his daughter.  It
was of a piece with other assistance formerly rendered to him in his
domestic arrangements, for which he was equally obliged.  He was happy
to inform his lordship that, in this instance, his precautions had been
uncalled for; and referred him to a letter which he would receive from
Mr. Dynevor by the same mail, for an explanation of the circumstances
to which he referred.  He had been informed, by undoubted authority,
that Lord Fitzjocelyn had done his daughter the honour of soliciting
her hand.  It might console his lordship to learn that, should the
union take place, the whole of his property would be secured to Mrs.
Ponsonby, and his daughter's sole fortune would be that which she
inherited by her mother's marriage settlements.  Possibly this
intelligence might lead to a cessation of these flattering attentions.'
'Mrs. Ponsonby! he can mention her in the same sentence with Mary's
mother!' said the Earl.
Louis turned pale as he read, and scarcely breathed as he looked up at
his father, dreading that he might so resent the studied affronts as to
wish to break off the connexion, and that he might have him likewise to
contend with; but on that score he was set at rest.  The Earl replied
to his exclamation of angry dismay, 'It is little more than I looked
for.  It is not the first letter I have had from him. I find he has
some just cause for offence.  The marriage is less disgraceful than I
had been led to believe.  Here is Oliver Dynevor's testimony.'
Oliver Dynevor's was a succinct business-like letter, certifying his
cousin that he had been mistaken in his view of the marriage.  Dona
Rosita de Guzman was an orphan of a very respectable family, who had
come to spend the year before her intended noviciate at the house of an
uncle.  She was very young, and Mr. Dynevor believed that the marriage
had been hastened by her relations making her feel herself unwelcome,
and her own reluctance to return to her convent, and that she might not
be aware how very recently Mr. Ponsonby had become a widower.  For his
own part, he was little used to ladies' society, and could form no
judgment of the bride; but he could assure Lord Ormersfield that she
had been guilty of no impropriety; she was visited by every one; and
that there was no reason against Mary Ponsonby associating with her.
'What could the clerk be thinking of?' exclaimed Louis.
'My first impression was not taken from the clerk.  What I heard first,
and in the strongest terms, was from the captain of a ship at
Valparaiso.  In fact, it was in the mouth of all who had known the
family.  Robson neither confirmed nor contradicted, and gave me the
notion of withholding much from regard for his employer.  He lamented
the precipitation, but seemed willing to make excuses.  He distinctly
said, he would not take it on himself to recommend Miss Ponsonby's
continuing her journey.  He was right.  If I had known all this, I
should still have brought her home.  I must write an apology, as far as
her character is concerned; but, be that as it may, the marriage is
atrocious--an insult--a  disgrace!  He could not have waited six
weeks--'
'But I must go to Mary!' cried Louis, as though reproaching himself for
the delay.  'Oh! that she should have forced herself to that wedding,
and spared me!'
'I am coming with you,' said the Earl.  'She will require my personal
assurance that all this makes no difference to me.'
'I am more afraid of the difference it may make to her,' said Louis.
'You have never believed how fond she is of her father.'
On arriving, they were ushered into the room where Miss Ponsonby was at
breakfast, and a cup of tea and untasted roll showed where her niece
had been.  She received them with stiff, upright chillness; and to
their hope that Mary was not unwell, replied--'Not very well.  She had
been over-fatigued yesterday, and had followed her advice in going to
lie down.'
Louis began to imagine a determination to exclude him, and was eagerly
beginning to say that she had asked him to come that morning--could she
not see him? when the lady continued, with the same severity--'Until
yesterday, I was not aware how much concern Lord Fitzjocelyn had taken
in what related to my niece.'
At that moment, when Louis's face was crimson with confusion and
impatience, the door was softly pushed ajar, and he heard himself
called in low, hoarse tones.  Miss Ponsonby was rising with an air of
vexed surprise, but he never saw her, and, hastily crossing the room,
he shut the door behind him, and followed the form that flitted up the
stairs so fast, that he did not come up with her till she had entered
the drawing-room, and stood leaning against a chair to gather breath.
She was very pale, and her eyes looked as if she had cried all night,
but she controlled her voice to say, 'I could not bear that you should
hear it from Aunt Melicent.'
'We had letters this morning, dearest.  Always thinking for me!  But I
must think for you.  You can hardly stand--'
He would have supported her to the sofa, but she shrank from him; and,
leaning more heavily on the chair, said--'Do you not know, Louis, all
that must be at an end?'
'I know no such thing.  My father is here on purpose to assure you that
it makes not the slightest difference to him.'
'Yours!  Yes!  But oh, Louis!' with a voice that, in its faintness and
steadiness, had a sound of anguish--'only think what I allowed him to
make me do!  To insult my father and his choice!  It was a mistake, I
know,' she continued, fearing to be unjust and to grieve Louis; 'but a
most dreadful one!'
'He says he should have brought you home all the same--' began Louis.
'Mary, you must sit down!' he cried, interrupting himself to come
nearer; and she obeyed, sinking into the chair.  'What a state you are
in!  How could you go through yesterday?  How could you be distressed,
and not let me know?'
'I could not spoil their wedding-day, that we had wished for so long.'
'Then you had the letter?'
'In the morning.  Oh, that I had examined farther!  Oh, that I had
never come home!'
'Mary! I cannot hear you say so.'
'You would have been spared all this.  You were doing very well without
me--as you will--'
He cried out with deprecating horror.
'Louis!' she said, imploringly.  'Oh, Louis! do not make it harder for
me to do right.'
'Why--what?  I don't understand!  Your father has not so much as heard
how we stand together.  He cannot be desiring you to give me up.'
'He--he forbids me to enter on anything of the sort with you.  I don't
know what made him think it possible, but he does.  And--' again Mary
waited for the power of utterance, 'he orders me to come out with Mrs.
Willis, in the Valdivia, and it sails on the 12th of December!'
'But Mary, Mary! you cannot be bound by this.  It is only fair towards
him, towards all of us, to give him time to answer our letters.'
Mary shook her head.  'The only condition, he says, on which he could
allow me to remain, would be if I were engaged to James Frost.'
'Too late for that, certainly,' said Louis; and the smile was a relief
to both.  'At any rate, it shows that he can spare you.  Only give him
time.  When he has my father's explanation--and my father is certain to
be so concerned at having cast any imputation on a lady. His first
thought was to apologize--'
'That is not all!  I remember now that dear mamma always said she did
not know whether he would consent.  Oh! how weak I was ever to listen--'
'No, Mary, that must not be said.  It was my presumptuous, inveterate
folly that prevented you from trusting my affection when she might have
helped us.'
'I don't know.  It would have caused her anxiety and distress when she
was in no state for them.  I don't think it did,' said Mary,
considering; 'I don't think she ever knew how much I cared.'
The admission could only do Louis's heart good, and he recurred to his
arguments that her father could be persuaded by such a letter as he
felt it in him to write.
'You do not know all,' said Mary.  'I could not show you his letter;
but, from it and from my aunt, I better understand what impressions he
has of you all, and how hopeless it is.'
'Tell me!'
She could not help giving herself the relief, when that most loving,
sympathizing face was pleading with her to let him comfort her.  She
knew there was no fiery nor rancorous temper to take umbrage, and it
was best for him to know the completeness of the death-blow.
'Oh, Louis! he fancies that my dear mother's fondness for her own
family destroyed his domestic peace.  He says their pride and narrow
notions poisoned--yes, that is the word--poisoned her mind against him;
and that was the reason he insisted on my being brought up here, and
kept from you all.'
'But I don't understand why he let you come straight home to us, and
live in Dynevor Terrace?'
'Then he was really sorry mamma was so ill; and--and for all that was
past; I am sure he felt it was the last parting, and only wished to do
anything that could make up to her.  He freely gave her leave to go
wherever she pleased, and said not a word against Northwold.  It was
one of her great comforts that he never seemed in the least vexed at
anything she had done since we went home.  Besides, my aunt says that
he and Mr. Dynevor had some plans about James and me.'
'He will have that out of his head.  He will come to reason.  Fond of
you, and sorry for the past, he will listen.  No wonder he was in a
passion; but just imagine what it would be to heed half Jem Frost says
when he is well worked up!'
'Papa is not like James,' said Mary; 'things go deeper with him.  He
never forgets!  I shall never forgive myself for not having spoken to
Robson!  I know his manner, seeming to assent and never committing
himself, and I ought to have gone through anything rather than have
taken such an accusation for granted.'
To hinder his pleading against her self-conviction, she re-opened her
letter to prove the cruelty of the injustice.  Mr. Ponsonby professed
to have been unwilling to enter so speedily on the new tie; but to have
been compelled, by the species of persecution which was exercised on
Rosita, in order to make her return to her nunnery.  He dwelt on her
timid affection and simplicity, and her exceeding mortification at the
slur which Mary had been induced to cast upon her; though, he said, her
innocent mind could not comprehend the full extent of the injury; since
the step his daughter had taken would, when known, seriously affect the
lady's reception into society, in a manner only to be repaired by
Mary's immediately joining them at Lima.  He peremptorily indicated the
ship and the escort--a merchant's wife, well known to her and charged
her, on her duty, as the only proof of obedience or affection which
could remedy the past, to allow no influence nor consideration whatever
to detain her.  'You see?' said Mary.
'I see!' was the answer.  'Mary, you are right, you must go.'
The words restored her confiding look, and her face lost almost all the
restless wretchedness which had so transformed it.  'Thank you,' she
said, with a long breath; 'I knew you would see it so.'
'It will be a very pretty new style of wedding tour.  Andes for Alps!
No, Mary, you need not suspect me of trifling now!  I really mean it,
and, seriously, our going in that way would set this Rosita straight
with society much more handsomely and effectually.  Don't doubt my
father--I will fetch him.'
'Stop, Louis!  You forget!  Did I not tell you that he expressly warns
me against you?  He must have heard of what happened before: he says I
had prudence once to withstand, and he trusts to my spirit and
discretion to--' Mary stopped short of the phrase before her eyes--to
resist the interested solicitations of necessitous nobility, and the
allurements of a beggarly coronet.  'No,' she concluded; 'he says that
you are the last person whom he could think of allowing me to accept.'
She hid her face in her hands, and her voice died away.
'Happily that is done,' said Louis, not yet disconcerted; 'but if you
go, as I own you must, it shall be with a letter of mine, explaining
all.  You will plead for me--I think you will, and when he is satisfied
that we are no rebels, then the first ship that sails for Peru--Say
that will do, Mary.'
'No, Louis, I know my father.'  She roused herself and sat upright,
speaking resolutely, but not daring to look at him--'I made up my mind
last night.  It was weak and selfish in me to enter into this
engagement, and it must be broken off.  You must be left free--not
bound for years and years.'
'Oh, Mary!  Mary! this is too much.  I deserved distrust by my wretched
folly and fickleness last year, but I did not know what you were to me
then--my most precious one!  Can you not trust me!  Do you not know how
I would wait?'
'You would wait,' said poor Mary, striving with choking tears, 'and be
sorry you had waited.'
'Are you talking madness, Mary?  I should live for the moment to
compensate for all.'
'You would waste your best years, and when the time came, you would
still be young, and I grown into an old careworn woman.  You would find
you had waited for what was nothing worth!'
'How can you talk so!' cried Louis, wounded, 'when you know that to
cherish and make up to you would be my dearest, fondest wish!  No,
don't shake your head!  You know it is not a young rose and lily beauty
that I love,--it is the honest, earnest glance in my Mary's eyes, the
rest, and trust, and peace, whenever I do but come near her.  Time
can't take that away!'
'Pray,' said Mary, feebly, 'don't let us discuss it now.  I know it is
right.  I was determined to say it to-day, that the worst might be
over, but I can't argue, nor bear your kindness now.  Please let it
wait.'
'Yes, let it wait.  It is depression.  You will see it in a true light
when you have recovered the shock, and don't fancy all must be given up
together.  Lie down and rest; I am sure you have been awake all night.'
'I may rest now I have told you, and seen you not angry with poor papa,
nor with me.  Oh! Louis--the gratitude to you, the weight off my mind!'
'I don't think any one could help taking the same view,' said Louis.
'It seems to me one of the cases where the immediate duty is the more
clear because it is so very painful.  Mary, I think that you are
committing your way unto the Lord, and you know 'He shall bring it to
pass.''
As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and Miss Ponsonby, stiffly
entering, said, 'Excuse my interruption, but I hope Lord Fitzjocelyn
will be considerate enough not to harass you any longer with
solicitations to act against your conscience.'
'He is not persuading me,' said Mary, turning towards her aunt a face
which, through all her dejection, proved her peace in his support and
approval, 'he is helping me.'
'Yes,' said Louis to the astonished aunt; 'since I have heard the true
state of the case, I have been convinced that there is no choice for
her but to go out, to repair the injustice so unfortunately done to
this poor lady.  It is a noble resolution, and I perfectly concur with
her.'
'I am glad you think so properly, sir,' returned Miss Ponsonby. 'Lord
Ormersfield seems quite of another opinion.  He was desirous of seeing
you, Mary; but I have been telling him I could permit no more
interviews to-day.'
'Oh no,' said Mary, putting her hand to her head, as if it could bear
no more; 'not to-day!   Louis, tell him how it is.  Make him forgive
me; but do not let me see him yet.'
'You shall see no one,' said Louis, tenderly; 'you shall rest. There--'
and, as if he had the sole right to her, he arranged the cushions,
placed her on the sofa, and hung over her to chafe her hands, and bathe
her forehead with eau de Cologne; while, as he detected signs of hasty
preparations about the room, he added, 'Don't trouble yourself with
your arrangements; I will see about all I can to help you.  Only rest,
and cure your head.'
'Say that one thing to me again,' whispered Mary, ere letting his hand
go.
Again he murmured the words, 'Commit thy way unto the Lord, and He
shall bring it to pass.'
Then Mary felt her hand pressed to his lips, but she would not unclose
her burning eyes; she would fain sleep beneath the impress of that
spell of patient confidence.
The gentle authority of his manner had deprived Miss Ponsonby of all
notion of interfering.  This 'odious, frivolous young man of fashion,'
so entirely disconcerted her ideas of ardent lovers, or of
self-interested puppies, that she gazed at him, surprised and softened;
and when he looked at her anxiously, to judge whether Mary would find
in her a kind comforter, her eyes were full of tears, and she said as
they left the room, 'It must be a great relief to my poor Mary that you
see it so sensibly.  She has been suffering much in anticipation of
this meeting.'
'Her unselfishness goes to one's heart!' said Louis, almost overcome.
'If she would but have spared herself yesterday!'
'Ah! she said she could not bear that you should be pained on your
friend's wedding-day.  I am much comforted to find that you appreciate
the effort.'
This was not what Miss Ponsonby had intended to say, but there was
something about the young man that touched her exceedingly; even when
fresh from a very civil and decorous combat with his father, and a
ripping-up of all the ancient grievances of the married life of their
two relations, rendering wider than ever the breach between the houses
of Ponsonby and Fitzjocelyn.
Lord Ormersfield came forward to learn whether he might see Mary, and
was met by assurances that she must be kept as quiet as possible; upon
which he took leave, making a stately bend of the head, while Louis
shook Miss Ponsonby's hand, and said he should come to the door to
inquire before the day was over.
'I never saw her so broken down,' he said, in answer to his father's
compassionate but indignant exclamation as they walked home. 'Yesterday
was a terrible strain on her.'
'I wish we had never brought her here,' said Lord Ormersfield.  'The
aunt is your enemy, as she always was that of Mary's mother.  She
nearly avowed that she set her brother on making this premature
prohibition.'
'I do not think she is unkind to Mary,' said Louis; 'I could be almost
glad that the dear Aunt Kitty is spared all this worry.  It would make
her so very miserable.'
'Her influence would be in your favour, whereas this woman is perfectly
unreasonable.  She justifies her brother in everything, and is actually
working on that poor girl's scruples of conscience to send her out by
this ship.'
'Nay,' said Louis, 'after hearing her father's letter, I do not see
that it is possible for her to do otherwise.'
Lord Ormersfield hastily turned to look at his son's countenance,--it
was flushed and melancholy, but fully in earnest; nevertheless the Earl
would not believe his ears, and made a sound as if he had missed the
words.
'I am grieved enough to say so,' repeated Louis; 'but, as he puts it, I
do not see how Mary can refuse to obey him.'
'I declare, Fitzjocelyn,' exclaimed his father, with some anger, 'any
one who takes the trouble, may talk you into anything imaginable!'
'Not into believing her wrong.'
'I did not think you so weak!' continued his father.  'It is the very
case where a woman's exaggerated notions of right may be wrought on to
do her infinite harm!  They become quite ridiculous without some one to
show that such things may be carried too far!  I must say, I did expect
strength of mind and common sense for your own interest. I esteem it a
mere matter of duty to put an end to such nonsense.'
'My dear father,' said Louis, 'it was Mary and her mother who first
taught me my own obligations.  I should never dare to interfere with
any one's filial duty--above all, where my own happiness is so deeply
concerned.'
'Yours!  I am not talking of yours.  What is to become of Mary with
such a man as that? and this Spanish woman, who, if she does not
deserve all that has been said of her, no doubt soon will?--no
education, no principles, breaking out of her convent!  And you let
yourself be drawn into calling it Mary's duty to run into such company
as that!  You are not fit to protect her.'
'From all I have heard of Mr. Ponsonby, I am convinced he has too much
regard for his daughter to summon her into any improper society. I do
not hear that he has been to blame as a father.  I wish I could see it
as you do; but not only do I know that Mary could not have an instant's
peace under the sense of his displeasure, but it seems to me that this
is one of the express commands which could not be disobeyed without
setting aside the law of Heaven.  If I gave my voice against it, I
should fear to bring on us a curse, and not a blessing.'
'Fitzjocelyn, I always knew how it would be if you took to being one of
those very good people.  Nothing is so weak, and yet so unmanageable.
Any rational being would look on it as a duty to rescue her from such a
man as that; but that is too ordinary a virtue for you.  You must go
higher.'
Louis made no answer.  Never had his father pained him so much, and he
could ill brook additional suffering.
'However,' said the Earl, recovering, 'I shall see her.  I shall put
the matter in a just light.  She is a sensible girl, and will
understand me when she has recovered the shock.  On one head I shall
give warning.  She must choose between us and her father.  If she
persist in going out to join this establishment, I will have your
engagement given up.'
'Father! father! you would not be so cruel!'
'I know what I am saying.  Am I to allow you to be encumbered all the
time she is on the other side of the world, waiting Ponsonby's
pleasure, to come home at last, in ten or fifteen years' time, worried
and fretted to death, like her poor mother?  No, Louis, it must be now
or never.'
'You are only saying what I would not hear from her.  She has been
insisting on breaking off, and all my hope was in you.'
'She has?  That is like her!  The only reasonable thing I have heard
yet.'
'Then you will not help me?  You, who I thought loved her like your own
daughter, and wished for nothing so much!'
'So I might; but that is a different thing from allowing you to wear
out your life in a hopeless engagement.  If she cast off her family,
nothing could be better, otherwise, I would never connect you with
them.'
It did not occur to his lordship that he was straining pretty hard the
filial duty of his own son, while he was arguing that Mary should snap
asunder the same towards her father.
The fresh discomfiture made poor Louis feel utterly dejected and almost
hopeless, but lest silence should seem to consent, he said, 'When you
see Mary, you will be willing for me to do anything rather than lose
what is so dear and so noble.'
'Yes, I will see Mary.  We will settle it between us, and have it right
yet; but we must give her to-day to think it over, and get over the
first shock.  When she has had a little time for reflection, a few cool
arguments from me will bring her to reason.'
So it was all to be settled over Louis's passive head; and thus
satisfied, his father, who was exceedingly sorry for him, forgot his
anger, and offered to go home alone as Clara's escort, promising to
return on the Monday, to bring the full force of his remonstrances to
bear down Mary's scruples.
Lord Ormersfield believed Clara too much of a child to have any ideas
on what was passing; and had it depended on him, she must have gone
home in an agony of ignorance on the cause of her cousin's trouble, but
Louis came with them to the station, and contrived to say to her while
walking up and down the platform, 'Her father is bitter against me.  He
has sent for her, and she is going!'
Clara looked mutely in his face, with a sort of inquiring dismay.
'You'll hear all about it when my father has told Aunt Kitty,' said
Louis.  'Clara,'--he paused, and spoke lower--'tell her I see what is
right now; tell her to--to pray for me, that I may not be talked into
tampering with my conscience or with hers.  Don't let it dwell on you
or on my aunt,' he added, cheerfully.  'No, it won't; you will be
thinking of Jem and Isabel.'  And as his father came up, his last words
were, in his own bright tone, 'Tell granny from me that giraffes ought
always to be seen by gaslight.'
Clara's countenance returned him a look of sorrowful reproach, for
thinking her capable of being amused when he was in distress; and she
sat in silent musings all the way home--pondering over his words,
speculating on his future, wondering what Mary felt, and becoming blunt
and almost angry, when her grave escort in the opposite corner
consulted civility by addressing some indifferent remark to her, as if,
she said to herself, 'she were no better than a stuffed giraffe, and
knew and cared nothing about anybody!'
He might have guessed that she understood something by the sudden way
in which she curtailed her grandmother's rapturous and affectionate
inquiries about the wedding, ran upstairs on the plea of taking off her
bonnet, and appeared no more till he had gone home; when, coming down,
she found granny, with tearful eyes, lamenting that Mr. Ponsonby was so
harsh and unkind, and fully possessed with the rational view which her
nephew had been impressing on her.
'Ha!' said Clara, 'that is what Louis meant.  I'll tell you what,
granny, Lord Ormersfield never knew in his life what was right, half as
well as Louis does.  I wish he would let him alone.  If Mary is good
enough for him, she will go out and wait till her father comes round.
If she is not, she won't; and Lord Ormersfield has no business to tease
her.'
'Then you would like her to go out?' said Mrs. Frost.
'I like anything that makes Louis happy.  I thought it would have been
delightful to have him married--one could be so much more at
Ormersfield, and Mary would be so nice; but as to their being
over-persuaded, and thinking themselves half wrong! why, they would
never be happy in their lives; and Louis would be always half-asleep or
half mad, to save himself the trouble of thinking.  But he'll never do
it!'
On the Saturday morning Mary's healthy and vigorous spirit had quite
resumed its tone.  The worst was over when she had inflicted the stroke
on Louis, and seen him ready to support instead of adding to her
distress.  He found her pale and sorrowful, but calm, collected, and
ready for exertion.  By tacit consent, they avoided all discussion of
the terms on which they were to stand.  Greatly touched by her
consideration for him on the wedding-day, he would not torture her with
pleadings, and was only too grateful for every service that he was
allowed to render her without protest, as still her chief and most
natural dependence.
She did not scruple to allow him to assist her; she understood the
gratification to him, and it was only too sweet to her to be still his
object.  She could trust him not to presume, his approval made her
almost happy; and yet it was hard that his very patience and
acquiescence should endear him so much as to render the parting so much
the more painful.  The day was spent in business.  He facilitated much
that would have been arduous for two solitary women, and did little all
day but go about for Mary, fulfilling the commissions which her father
had sent home; and though he did it with a sore heart, it was still a
privilege to be at work for Mary.
Rigid as Miss Ponsonby was, she began to be touched.  There was a doubt
as to his admission when he came on Sunday morning--'Mistress saw no
one on Sunday,' but when his name was carried in, Miss Ponsonby could
not withstand Mary's face.  She took care to tell him her rule; but
that, considering the circumstances, she had made an exception in his
favour, on the understanding that nothing was to break in upon the
observance of the Sabbath.
Louis bent his head, with the heartfelt answer that he was but too glad
to be permitted to go to church once more with Mary.
Aunt Melicent's Sunday was not quite their own Sunday, but all that
they could desire was to be quietly together, and restricted from all
those agitating topics and arrangements.  It was a day of rest, and
they valued it accordingly.  In fact, Miss Ponsonby found the young
Lord so good and inoffensive, that she broke her morning's resolution,
invited him to partake of the cold dinner, let him go to church with
them again in the evening, and remain to tea; and when he took leave,
she expressed such surprised admiration at his having come and gone on
his own feet, his church-going, and his conduct generally, that Mary
could not help suspecting that her good aunt had supposed that he had
never heard of the Fourth Commandment.
Miss Ponsonby was one of the many good women given to hard judgments on
slight grounds, and to sudden reactions still more violent; and the
sight of Lord Fitzjocelyn spending a quiet, respectable Sunday, had
such an effect on her, that she transgressed her own mandate, and
broached 'the distressing subject.'
'Mary, my dear, I suppose this young gentleman is an improved
character?'
'He is always improving,' said Mary.
'I mean, that an important change must have taken place since I
understood you to say you had refused him.  I thought you acted most
properly then; and, as I see him now, I think you equally right in
accepting him.'
'He was very much what he is now,' said Mary.
'Then it was from no doubt of his being a serious character?'
'None whatever,' said Mary, emphatically.
'Well, my dear, I must confess his appearance, his family, and your
refusal, misled me.  I fear I did him great injustice.'
A silence, and then Miss Ponsonby said, 'After all, my dear, though I
thought quite otherwise at first, I do believe that, considering what
the youth is, and how much attached he seems, you might safely continue
the engagement.'
Mary's heart glowed to her aunt for having been thus conquered by
Louis--she who, three nights back, had been so severely incredulous, so
deeply disappointed in her niece for having been deluded into endurance
of him.  But her resolution was fixed.  'It would not be right,' she
said; 'his father would not allow it.  There is so little chance of
papa's relenting, or of my coming home, that it would be wrong to keep
him in suspense.  He had better turn his thoughts elsewhere while he is
young enough to begin again.'
'It might save him from marrying some mere fine lady.'
'That will never be, whatever woman he chooses will--' She could not go
on, but presently cleared her voice--'No; I should like to leave him
quite free.  I was less his choice than his father's; and, though I
thought we should have been very happy, it does not seem to be the
leading of Heaven.  I am so far his inferior in cleverness, and
everything attractive, and have been made so like his elder sister,
that it might not have been best for him.  I want him to feel that, in
beginning afresh, he is doing me no injury; and then in time, whenever
I come home, it may be such a friendship as there was between our
elders.  That is what I try to look forward to,--no, I don't think I
look forward to anything.  Good night, Aunt Melicent--I am so glad you
like him!'
In this mind Mary met Lord Ormersfield.  The delay had been an
advantage, for he was less irritated, and she had regained
self-possession.  Her passage had been taken, and this was an argument
that told on the Earl, though he refused to call it irrevocable.  He
found that there was no staggering her on the score of the life that
awaited her; she knew more on that subject than he did, had confidence
in her father, and no dread of Rosita; and she was too much ashamed and
grieved at the former effect of his persuasions to attend to any more
of a like description.  He found her sense of duty more stubborn than
he had anticipated, and soon had no more to say. She might carry it too
far; but the principle was sound, and a father could not well
controvert it.  He had designed the rupture with Louis as a penalty to
drive her into his measures; but he could not so propound it, and was
wondering how to bring it in, when Mary relieved him by beginning
herself, and stating the grounds with such sensible, unselfish, almost
motherly care of Louis's happiness, that he was more unwilling than
ever to let him resign her, and was on the point of begging her to
re-consider, and let Louis wait for ever rather than lose her.  But he
knew they ought not to be bound, under such uncertainties, and his
conviction was too strong to give way to emotion.  He thanked her, and
praised her with unwonted agitation, and regretted more than ever; and
so they closed the conference by deciding that, unless Mr. Ponsonby
should be induced to relent by his daughter's representations on her
arrival, Mary and Louis must consider themselves as mutually released.
That loophole--forlorn, most forlorn hope, as they knew it to be--was
an infinite solace to the young people, by sparing them a formal
parting, and permitting them still to feel that they belonged to each
other.  If he began declaring that nothing would ever make him feel
disconnected with Mary, he was told that it was not time to think of
that, and they must not waste their time.  And once Mary reminded him
how much worse it would be if they had been separated by a quarrel.
'Anger might give one spirits,' he said, smiling mournfully.
'At the time; but think what it would be not to be able to remember
happy times without remorse.'
'Then you do mean to recollect, Mary?'
'I trust to bring myself to remember rightly and wisely.  I shall try
to set it for a reward for myself to cure me of repinings,' said Mary,
looking into his face, as if the remembrance of it must bring
cheerfulness and refreshment.
'And when shall I not think, Mary!  When I leave off work, I shall want
you for a companion; when I go to work, the thought must stir me up.
Your judgment must try my own.'
'Oh, hush, Louis! this is not good.  Be yourself, and be more than
yourself, and only think of the past as a time when we had a great deal
of pleasantness, and you did me much good.'
'Did I?'
'Yes; I see it now I am with Aunt Melicent.  You put so many more
thoughts in my head, and showed me that so much more was good and
wholesome than I used to fancy.  Dear mamma once said you were
educating me; and I hope to go on, and not let your lessons waste away.'
'Nay, Mary, you won good everywhere.  If you had not been Mary, I might
have made you a great goose.  But you taught me all the perseverance I
ever had.  And oh! Mary, I don't wonder you do not trust it.'
'There is the forbidden subject,' said Mary, firmly.
That was the sort of conversation into which they fell now and then
during those last days of busy sadness.
Truly it could have been worse.  Suffering by their own fault would
have rent them asunder more harshly, and Louis's freedom from all
fierceness and violence softened all ineffably to Mary.  James Frost's
letter of fiery indignation, almost of denunciation, made her thankful
that he was not the party concerned; and Louis made her smile at
Isabel's copy of all his sentiments in ladylike phrases.
The last day came.  Louis would not be denied seeing Mary on board the
Valdivia; and, in spite of all Miss Ponsonby's horror of railways, he
persuaded her to trust herself under his care to Liverpool.  She
augured great things from the letter which she had entrusted to Mary,
and in which she had spoken of Lord Fitzjocelyn in the highest terms
her vocabulary could furnish.
They parted bravely.  Spectators hindered all display of feeling, and
no one cried, except Miss Ponsonby.
'Good-bye, Louis; I will not forget your messages to Tom Madison.  My
love to your father and Aunt Catharine.'
'Good-bye, Mary; I shall see Tom and Chimborazo yet.'
CHAPTER V.
THE NEW WORLD.
Still onward, as to southern skies,
We spread our sails, new stars arise,
New lights upon the glancing tide,
Fresh hues where pearl and coral hide:
What are they all but tokens true
Of grace for ever fresh and new!
Prayers for Emigrants.
There are some days in the early year, devoid indeed of spring
brilliance, but full of soft, heavy, steaming fragrance, pervading the
grey air with sweet odours, and fostering the growth of tender bud and
fragile stem with an unseen influence, more mild and kindly than even
the smiling sunbeam or the gushing shower.  'A growing day,' as the
country-people term such genial, gentle weather, might not be without
analogy to the brief betrothal of Louis and Mary.
Subdued and anxious, there had been little of the ordinary light of
joy, hope, or gaiety, and their pleasures had been less their own than
in preparing the happiness of their two friends.  It was a time such as
to be more sweet in memory than it was in the present; and the shade
which had hung over it, the self-restraint and the forbearance which it
had elicited, had unconsciously conduced to the development of the
characters of both, preparing them to endure the parting far more
effectually than unmixed enjoyment could have done. The check upon
Louis's love of trifling, the restraint on his spirits, the being
thrown back on his own judgment when he wanted to lean upon Mary, had
given him a habit of controlling his boyish ways.
It was a call to train himself in manliness and self-reliance.  It
changed him from the unstable reed he once had been, and helped him to
take one steady and consistent view of the trial required of him and of
Mary, and then to act upon it resolutely and submissively. With Mary
gone, he cared little what became of him until her letters could
arrive; and his father, with more attention to his supposed benefit
than to his wishes, carried him at once, without returning home, to a
round of visits among all his acquaintance most likely to furnish a
distracting amount of Christmas gaieties.  In the midst of these, there
occurred a vacancy in the representation of a borough chiefly under the
influence of Sir Miles Oakstead; and, as it was considered expedient
that he should be brought into Parliament, his father repaired with him
at once to Oakstead, and involved him in all the business of the
election.  On his success, he went with his father to London for the
session, and this was all that his friends at Northwold knew of him.
He wrote hurried notes to James or to Mr. Holdsworth on necessary
affairs connected with his farm and improvements, mentioning facts
instead of feelings, and promising to write to Aunt Catharine when he
should have time; but the time did not seem to come, and it was easy to
believe that his passiveness of will, increased by the recent stroke,
had caused him to be hurried into a condition of involuntary practical
activity.
Mary, meanwhile, was retracing her voyage, in the lull of spirits
which, after long straining, had nothing to do but to wait in patience,
bracing themselves for a fresh trial.  Never suffering herself, at sea,
her first feelings, after the final wrench of parting, were interrupted
by the necessity of attending to her friend, a young mother, with
children enough to require all the services that the indefatigable Mary
could perform.  If Mrs. Willis always averred that she never could have
gone through the voyage without Miss Ponsonby, Mary felt, in return,
that the little fretful boy and girl, who would never let her sit and
think, except when both were asleep, had been no small blessing to her.
Yet Mary was not so much absorbed and satisfied with the visible and
practical as had once been the case.  The growth had not been all on
Louis's side.  If her steadfast spirit had strengthened his wavering
resolution, the intercourse and sympathy with him had opened and
unfolded many a perception and quality in her, which had been as
tightly and hardly cased up as leaf-buds in their gummy envelopes.  A
wider range had been given to her thoughts; there was a swelling of
heart, a vividness of sensation, such as she had not known in earlier
times; she had been taught the mystery of creation, the strange
connexion with the Unseen, and even with her fellow-men.  Beyond the
ordinary practical kind offices, for which she had been always ready,
there was now mingled something of Louis's more comprehensive spirit of
questioning what would do them good, and drawing food for reflection
from their diverse ways.
She was sensible of the change again and again, when sights recurred
which once had only spoken to her eye.  That luminous sea, sparkling
like floods of stars, had been little more than 'How pretty! how
funny!' at her first voyage.  Now, it was not only 'How Louis would
admire it!' but 'How profusely, how gloriously has the Creator spread
the globe with mysterious beauty! how marvellously has He caused His
creatures to hold forth this light, to attract others to their needful
food!'  And the furrow of fire left by their vessel's wake spoke to her
of that path 'like a shining light, shining more and more unto the
perfect day.'  If with it came the remembrance of his vision of the
threads of light, it was not a recollection which would lead to
repining.
And when at Cape Horn, a mighty ice mountain drifted within view,
spired, pinnacled, encrusted with whiteness, rivalled only by the glory
of the summer cloud, caverned here and there into hollows of sapphire
blue, too deeply dazzling to behold, or rising into peaks of clear,
hard, chill green; the wild fantastic points sometimes glimmering with
fragments of the rainbow arch; the rich variety, endless beyond measure
in form and colouring, and not only magnificent and terrible in the
whole mass, but lovely beyond imagination in each crystal too minute
for the eye.  Mary had once, on a like occasion, only said, 'it was
very cold;' and looked to see whether the captain expected the monster
to bear down on the ship. But the present iceberg put her in mind of
the sublime aspirations which gothic cathedrals seem as if they would
fain embody.  And then, she thought of the marvellous interminable
waste of beauty of those untrodden regions, whence yonder enormous
iceberg was but a small fragment--a petty messenger--regions unseen by
human eye--beauty untouched by human hand-the glory, the sameness, yet
the infinite variety of perfect purity.  Did it not seem, with all the
associations of cold, of peril, of dreariness, to be a visible token
that indeed He who fashioned it could prepare 'good things past man's
understanding!'
It was well for Mary that southern constellations, snowy, white-winged
albatross, leaping flying-fish, and white-capped mountain-coast, had
been joined in her mind with something higher, deeper, and less
personal, or their recurrence would have brought her nothing but pain
unmitigated in the contrast with the time when first she had beheld
them six years ago.
Then she was full of hope and eager ardour to arrive, longing for the
parental presence of which she had so long been deprived, hailing every
novel scene as a proof that she was nearer home, and without the
anticipation of one cloud, only expecting to be loved, to love, and to
be useful.  And now, all fond illusions as to her father had been
snatched away, her very love for him rendering the perception doubly
cruel; her mother, her precious mother, far away in Ormersfield
churchyard--her life probably shortened by his harshness--her place
occupied by a young girl, differing in language, in Church, in
everything--Mary's own pardon uncertain, after all her sacrifices--A
sense of having deeply offended, hung upon her; and her heart was so
entirely in England, that had her home been perfect, her voyage must
still have been a cruel effort.  That one anticipation of being set at
rest by her father's forgiveness, and the forlorn despairing hope of
his relenting towards Louis, were all she dared to dwell on; and when
Mrs. Willis counted the days till she could arrive and meet her
husband, poor Mary felt as if, but for these two chances of comfort,
she could gladly have prolonged the voyage for the rest of her life.
But one burning tropical noon, the Valdivia was entering Callao
harbour, and Mary, sick and faint at heart, was arraying herself in a
coloured dress, lest her mourning should seem to upbraid her father.
The voyage was over, the ship was anchored, boats were coming offshore,
the luggage was being hoisted out of the hold, the passengers were
congregated on deck, eager to land, some gazing with curious and
enterprising eyes on the new country, others scanning every boat in
hopes of meeting a familiar face.  Mrs. Willis stood trembling with
hope, excitement, and the strange dread often rushing in upon the last
moment of expectation.  She clung to Mary for support, and once said--
'Oh, Miss Ponsonby, how composed you are!'  Mary's feelings were too
deep--too much concentrated for trembling.  She calmed and soothed the
wife's sudden fright, lest 'something should have happened to George;'
and she even smiled when the children's scream of ecstacy infected
their mother, when the papa and uncle they had been watching for with
straining eyes proved to be standing on deck close beside them.
Mary cast her eyes round, and saw nothing of her own.  She stood apart,
while the Willis family were in all the rapture of the meeting; she saw
them moving off, too happy and sufficient for themselves even to
remember her.  She had a dull, heavy sensation that she must bear all,
and this was the beginning; and she was about to begin her arrangements
for her dreary landing, when Mrs. Willis's brother, Mr. Ward, turned
back.  He was a middle-aged merchant, whom her mother had much liked
and esteemed, and there was something cheering in his frank, hearty
greeting, and satisfaction in seeing her.  It was more like a welcome,
and it brought the Willises back, shocked at having forgotten her in
the selfishness of their own joy; but they had made sure that she had
been met.  Mr. Ward did not think that she was expected by the
Valdivia; Mr. Ponsonby had not mentioned it as likely.  So they were
all seated in the boat, with the black rowers; and while the Willises
fondled their children, and exchanged home-news, Mr. Ward sat by Mary,
and spoke to her kindly, not openly referring to the state of her home,
but showing a warmth and consideration which evinced much delicate
sympathy.
They all drove together in the Willises' carriage up the sloping road
from Callao to Lima, and Mary heard astonishment, such as she had once
felt, breaking out in screams from the children at the sight of
omnibuses filled with gaily-dressed negroes, and brown horsewomen in
Panama hats and lace-edged trousers careering down the road.  But then,
her father had come and fetched her from on board, and that dear mamma
was waiting in the carriage!  They entered the old walled town when
twilight had already closed in, and Mrs. Willis was anxious to take her
tired little ones home at once.  They were set down at their own door;
but Mr. Ward, with protecting anxious kindness, insisted on seeing Miss
Ponsonby safely home before he would join them.  As they drove through
the dark streets, Mary heard a little restless movement, betraying some
embarrassment; and at last, with an evident desire of reassuring her,
he said, 'Senora Rosita is thought very pleasing and engaging;' and
then, as if willing to change the subject, he hastily added, 'I suppose
you did not speak the Pizarro?'
'No.'
'She has sailed about three weeks.  She takes home your cousin, Mr.
Dynevor.'
Mary cried out with surprise.
'I thought him a complete fixture, but he is gone home for a year. It
seems his family property was in the market, and he was anxious to
secure it.'
'How glad his mother will be!' was all Mary could say, as there rushed
over her the thought of the wonderful changes this would make in
Dynevor Terrace.  Her first feeling was that she must tell Louis; her
second, that two oceans were between them; and then she thought of Aunt
Catharine having lived, after all, to see her son.
She had forgotten to expect the turn when the carriage wheeled under
the arched entry of her father's house.  All was gloom and stillness,
except where a little light shone in a sort of porter's lodge upon the
eager negro features of two blacks, with much gesticulation, playing at
dice.  They came out hastily at the sound of the carriage; and as Mr.
Ward handed out Mary, and inquired for Mr. Ponsonby, she recognised and
addressed the white-woolled old Xavier, the mayor domo.  Poor old
Xavier!  Often had she hunted and teased him, and tried to make him
understand 'cosas de Inglaterra,' and to make him cease from his
beloved dice; but no sooner did he see her face than, with a cry of
joy, 'La Senorita Maria! la Senorita Maria!' down he went upon his
knees, and began kissing the hem of her dress.
All the rest of the negro establishment came round, capering and
chattering Spanish; and, in the confusion, Mary could not get her
question heard--Where was her father? and Xavier's vehement threats and
commands to the others to be silent, did not produce a calm.  At last,
bearing a light, there came forward a faded, sallow dame, with a candle
in her hand, who might have sat for the picture of the Duena Rodriguez,
and at her appearance the negroes subsided.  She was an addition to the
establishment since Mary's departure; but in her might be easily
recognised the Tia, the individual who in Limenian households holds a
position between companion and housekeeper.  She introduced herself by
the lugubrious appellation of Senora Dolores, and, receiving Mary with
obsequious courtesy, explained that the Senor and Senora were at a
tertulia, or evening party.  She lighted Mary and Mr. Ward into the
quadra; and there Mr. Ward, shaking hands with her as if he would
thereby compensate for all that was wanting in her welcome, promised to
go and inform her father of her arrival.
Mary stood in the large dark room, with the soft matted floor, and the
windows high up near the carved timbered ceiling, the single lamp,
burning in rum, casting a dim gleam over the well-known furniture, by
which her mother had striven to give an English appearance to the room.
It was very dreary, and she would have given the world to be alone with
her throbbing head, her dull heartache, and the weariness of spirits
over-long wound up for the meeting; but her own apartment could be no
refuge until it had been cleansed and made ready, and Dolores and
Xavier were persecuting her every moment with their hospitality and
their inquiries.  Then came a quick, manly tread, and for a moment her
heart almost seemed to stand still, in the belief that it was her
father; but it was only Robson, hurrying in to offer his services and
apologies.  Perhaps he was the very last person she could bear to see,
feeling, as she did, that if he had been more explicit all the offence
would have been spared.  He was so much aware of all family matters,
and was accustomed to so much confidence from her father, that she
could not believe him unconscious; and there was something hateful to
her in the plausible frankness and deferential familiarity of his
manners, as, brushing up his sandy hair upon his forehead, he poured
forth explanations that Mr. Ponsonby would be delighted, but grieved
that no one had met her--Valdivia not expected so soon--not anticipated
the pleasure--if they had imagined that Miss Ponsonby was a passenger--
'My father desired that I would come out by her,' said Mary.
'Ay, true--so he informed me; but since later intelligence'--and he
cast a glance at Mary, to judge how much further to go; but meeting
with nothing but severity, he covered the impertinence by saying, 'In
fact, though the Valdivia was mentioned, and Mrs. Willis, Mr. Ponsonby
had reason to suppose you would not receive his letters in time to
avail yourself of the escort.'
'I did so, however,' said Mary, coldly.
'Most gratifying.  Mr. and Mrs. Ponsonby will be highly gratified. In
fact, Miss Ponsonby, I must confess that was a most unfortunate blunder
of mine last August.  I should not have fallen into the error had I not
been so long absent at Guayaquil that I had had no opportunity of
judging of the amiable lady; and I will own to much natural surprise
and some indignation, before I had had the pleasure of personal
acquaintance with the charms and the graces--Hem! In effect, it was a
step that no one could have recommended; and when your noble relative
put it to me in so many words whether I would counsel your continuing
your journey, I could not take it on me to urge a measure so painful to
your feelings, unaware as I was then of the amiable qualities of the
lady who occupies the situation of the highly beloved and esteemed--'
Mary could not bear to hear her mother's name in his mouth, so she cut
him short by saying, 'I suppose you thought you acted for the best, Mr.
Robson; it was very unfortunate, but it cannot be helped. Pray can you
tell me where the lad Madison is?' she added, resolved to show him that
she would not discuss these matters with him; 'I have a parcel for him.'
'He is at the San Benito mine, Miss Ponsonby.'
'How does he go on?'
'Well--I may say very well, allowing for inexperience.  He appears a
steady, intelligent lad, and I have no doubt will answer the purpose
well.'
There was one gratification for Mary, at least, in the pleasure this
would afford at home; but Robson continued making conversation about
Mr. Dynevor's visit to England, and the quantity of work this temporary
absence entailed on him; and then on the surprise it would be to his
patron to find her, and Senora Rosita's interest in her, and the
numerous gaieties of the bride, and the admiration she excited, and his
own desire to be useful.   This afforded Mary an opportunity for
getting rid of him at last, by sending him to make arrangements for her
baggage to be sent from Callao the next morning.
Ten minutes more, half spent in conquering her disgust, half in sick
anticipation, and other feet were crossing the matted sala, the curtain
over the doorway was drawn aside, and there stood her father, and a
lady, all white and diamonds, by his side.  He held out his arms, Mary
fell into them, and it was the same kind rough kiss which had greeted
her six years back.  It seemed to be forgiveness, consolation,
strength, all at once; and their words mingled--'Papa, you forgive
me'--'Mary, my good girl, I did not think they would have let you come
back to me.  This was but a dreary coming home for you, my dear.'  And
then, instantly changing his language to Spanish, he added, appealing
to his wife, that had they guessed she was on board, they would have
come to meet her.
Rosita replied earnestly to that effect, and warmly embraced Mary,
pitying her for such an arrival, and hoping that Dolores had made her
comfortable.  The rest of the conversation was carried on in the same
tongue.  Rosita was much what Mary had expected--of a beautiful figure,
with fine eyes, and splendid raven hair, but without much feature or
expression.  She looked almost like a dream to-night, however, with her
snowy robes, and the diamonds sparkling with their dewdrop flashes in
her hair and on her arms, with the fitful light caught from the
insufficient candles.  All she ventured to say had a timid gracefulness
and simplicity that were very winning; and her husband glanced more
than once to see if she were not gaining upon his daughter; and so in
truth she was, personally, though it was exceedingly painful to see her
where Mary had been used to see that dear suffering face; and it was
impossible not to feel the contrast with her father as painfully
incongruous.  Mr. Ponsonby was a large man, with the jovial manner of
one never accustomed to self-restraint; good birth and breeding making
him still a gentleman, in spite of his loud voice and the traces of
self-indulgence.  He was ruddy and bronzed, and his eyebrows and hair
looked as if touched by hoar frost; altogether as dissimilar a partner
as could be devised for the slender girlish being by his side.
After a little Spanish conversation, all kind on his aide, and thus
infinitely relieving Mary, they parted for the night.  She laid before
him the packet of letters, which she had held all this time as the last
link to Louis, and sought his eye as she did so with a look of appeal;
but he carefully averted his glance, and she could read nothing.
Weary as she was, Mary heard again and again, through her unglazed
windows, the watchman's musical cry of 'Ave Maria purisima, las--es
temblado!'  'Viva Peru y sereno!' and chid herself for foolish
anticipations that Louis would hear and admire all the strange sounds
of the New World.  The kindness of her welcome gave her a little hope;
and she went over and over again her own part of the discussion which
she expected, almost persuading herself, that Louis's own conduct and
her aunt's testimony must win the day.
She need not have spent so many hours in preparation for the morning.
She was up early, in hopes of seeing her father before he went to his
office, but he was gone for a ride.  The English breakfast, which had
been established, much to his content, by her own exertions, had quite
vanished, each of the family had a cup of chocolate in private, and
there was no meeting till, late in the morning, Rosita sauntered into
her room, embraced her, made inquiries as to her rest, informed her
that she was going to the Opera that night, and begged her to accompany
her.  To appear in public with Rosita was the tribute for which Mary
had come out, so she readily agreed; and thereupon the Senora digressed
into the subject of dress, and required of Mary a display of all her
robes, and an account of the newest fashions of the English ladies.  It
was all with such innocent, earnest pleasure, that Mary could not be
annoyed, and good-naturedly made all her disappointing display.
The midday meal brought her father--still kind and affectionate, but
never dropping the Spanish, nor manifesting any consciousness of her
letters.  She had hopes of the period allotted to the siesta, to which
custom, in old days, she had never acceded, but had always spent the
interval on any special occupation--above all, to writing for him; but
he went off without any notice of her, and she was in no condition to
dispense with the repose, for her frame was tired out, though her hopes
and fears could not even let her dreams rest.
Then came a drive with Rosita, resplendent in French millinery, then
supper; then the Opera, to which her father accompanied them, still
without a word.  Another day was nearly the same, only that this time
she had to do her best to explain the newest fashions in behalf of a
dress of Rosita's, then being made, and in the evening to go to a party
at the Consul's, where she met Mr. Ward, and had some talk which she
might have enjoyed but for her suspense.
On the third, Rosita was made happy by unpacking an elegant little
black papier mache table, a present from Miss Ponsonby.  Good Melicent!
were ever two sisters-in-law more unlike?   But Lord Ormersfield had
done Rosita and her husband good service.  If Aunt Melicent had first
learned the real facts, her wrath would have been extreme--a mere
child, a foreigner, a Roman Catholic, a nun!  Her horror would have
known no bounds, and she would, perhaps, have broken with her brother
forever.  But by making the newly-married pair victims of injustice,
the Earl had made the reality a relief, and Melicent had written
civilly to her brother, and a sisterly sort of stiff letter to the
bride--of which the Limenian could not understand one word; so that
Mary had to render it all into Spanish, even to her good aunt's hopes
that Rosita would be kind to her, and use all her influence in favour
of her happiness.
Whether Rosita would have comprehended this without Mary's blushes
might be questioned, but she did say, 'Ah! yes! you were to have
married the Visconde, were you not?  El Senor was so angry!  Did his
father forbid when your father refused your portion?'
'Oh no, he would receive me if I brought nothing.'
'And you wish to marry?' said Rosita.
'If my father would only consent.'
'But why did you come here then?' said Rosita, opening her large eyes.
'My father commanded me.'
'England is a long way off,' said Rosita, languidly, 'he could not have
reached you there.  You would have been a great lady and noble! How
could you come away, if he would still have you?'
'Because it would have been wrong.  We could not have been happy in
disobeying my father.'
'Ah! but you could have done penance.  I had many penances to do for
quitting my convent; Padre Inigo was very severe, but they are over at
last, and I am free for giving alms twice a week, and the Sisters have
forgiven me, and send me so many silver flowers and dulces; I will show
them to you some day.  Could you not have done penance?'
'I am afraid not.'
'Ah! I forgot you were a heretic, poor thing!  How inconvenient!  And
so you will not come with me to the bull-fight next Sunday?'
Such being Rosita's ideas on the point, Mary gave up much hope in her
influence, and tried what a good-humoured announcement of her
re-establishment of the English breakfast would effect towards bringing
her father to a tete-a-tete, but he never came near it.  The waiting in
silence was miserable enough for herself, but she would have continued
to bear it except for the injustice to Louis, who must not be kept in
suspense.  The departure of the next English mail should be the limit
of her endurance, and after a day of watching, she finally went up to
her father when he would have bidden her good night, and said, in
English, 'Papa, if you please, I must speak to you.'
'So you shall, my dear, but we are all tired; we must have our night's
rest.'
'No, papa, it must be to-night, if you please.  It is necessary for me
to know before to-morrow how I am to write to Lord Fitzjocelyn.'
'Pshaw!  Mary, I've settled that young fellow!'
'Papa, I don't think you know--'
'I've written him a civil answer, if that's what you mean, much
civiller than he or his father deserve,' he said, speaking loud, and
trying to fling away from her, but she stood her ground, and spoke
calmly and steadily, though her heart beat violently.
'You do not understand the true state of the case, papa; and without
doing so, you cannot write such an answer as they deserve.'
'I know this, that old Ormersfield has been the curse of my life!' and
out poured one of those torrents of fierce passion which had been
slowly but surely the death of his wife.  Mary had never heard one in
the full tide before, but she stood firm; there were none of the tears,
auch as, in her mother, had been wont to exasperate him further, but
with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and hands locked together, her heart
was one silent entreaty that it might be forgiven him above.  Thus she
stood while the storm of anger raged, and when at last it had exhausted
itself, he said, in a lower voice, 'And so you are still taken with
this fellow's son, this young puppy!  I thought you had more spirit and
sense, Mary, or I never would have trusted you among them.'
'There are very few people in this world half so good or so
right-minded as Fitzjocelyn,' said Mary, earnestly and deliberately.
'It was he who bade me come to you, well knowing that we could never be
happy without your consent.'
'Oh! he did so, did he?  He is deeper than I thought would not risk
your fortune.  Why, Mary, I did not think a girl of your sense could be
so taken in!  It is transparent, I tell you.  They get you there,
flatter you up with their attentions, but when they find you too wise
for them the first time, off goes this youth to Miss Conway, finds her
a bad speculation, no heiress at all, and disposes of her to his
cousin.  I wonder if he'll find old Dynevor grateful.  Meanwhile the
old Lord must needs come out here, finds our gains a better prize than
he expected, trumps up this story at Valparaiso, takes you in, and
brings you home to this precious youth.  And you, and your aunt too,
are ready to believe it all!  I always knew that women were fools
whenever a title came in their way, I see it more than ever now, since
you and Melicent are both like the rest of 'em.'
'Papa,' said Mary, again rallying her firmness, 'we have found sadly
how easy it is to be deceived when one is not on the spot.  Will you
listen to me, who saw it all?'
'No, Mary, I will not hear the nonsense they have put into your head,
my poor girl.  No!  I tell you it is of no use!  It is my resolute
purpose that not one farthing of mine shall go to patch up the
broken-down Ormersfield property!  The man is my enemy, and has sown
dissension in my family from the first moment I connected myself with
him.  I'll never see my daughter his son's wife.  I wonder he had the
impudence to propose it!  I shall think you lost to all feeling for
your father, if you say another word about it.'
'Very well,' said Mary, with steady submission.  'Then I will only
write one more letter to Fitzjocelyn, and tell him that your objections
are insuperable, and that he must think of it no more.'
'That's right, Mary! you are a good girl, after all!  You'll stand by
your father, in spite of all the House of Peers!  I'm glad to see you
hold up your head so bravely.  So you did fancy being a Viscountess,
did you! but it is not a heartbreaking matter either, my girl!'
This was too much for Mary, and when her father would have kissed her,
she laid her head on his shoulder and wept silently but bitterly.
'Ha! what's all this?  Why, you don't pretend to care for a young
mercenary scamp like that?'
'He is the noblest, most generous, most disinterested man I ever knew!'
said Mary, standing apart, and speaking clearly.  'I give him up
because--you command me, father, but I will not hear him spoken of
unjustly.'
'Ha! ha! so long as you give him up, we won't quarrel.  He shall be all
that, and more too, if you like; and we'll never fight over the matter
again, since I have you safe back, my child.'
'I do not mean to mention him again,' said Mary; 'I wish to obey you.'
'Then there's an end of the matter.  You'll get over it, my girl, and
we'll find some honest man worth two of your niggardly, proud-spirited
earls.  There, I know you are a reasonable girl that can be silent, and
not go on teasing.  So, Mary, you may have a cup of tea for me
to-morrow in the sala, like old times.  Goodnight, my dear.'
Waiting upon himself!  That was the reward that Mr. Ponsonby held out
to his daughter for crushing her first love!
But it was a reward.  Anything that drew her father nearer to her was
received with gratitude by Mary, and the words of kindness in some
degree softened the blow. She had never had much hope, though now she
found it had been more than she had been willing to believe; and even
now she could not absolutely cease to entertain some hopes of the
results of Oliver's return, nor silence one lingering fancy that Louis
might yet wait unbound; although she told herself of his vacillation
between herself and Isabel, of his father's influence, and of the
certainty that he would see many more worthy of his love than herself.
Not any one who could love him so well--oh no!  But when Mary found her
thoughts taking this turn, she rose up as she lay, clasped her hands
together, and repeated half aloud again and again, 'Be Thou my all!'
And by the morning, though Mary's cheek was very white, and her eyes
sunken for want of sleep, she had a cheerful word for her father, and a
smile, the very sight of which would have gone to the heart of any one
of those from whom he had cut her off.
Then she wrote her letters.  It was not so hard to make this final
severance as it had been to watch Louis's face, and think of the pain
she had to inflict.  Many a time had she weighed each phrase she set
down, so that it might offend neither against sincerity nor
resignation, and yet be soothing and consoling.  Some would have
thought her letter stiff and laboured, but she had learned to believe
that a grave and careful style befitted a serious occasion, and would
have thought incoherency childish or affected.
She released him entirely from his engagement, entreating him not to
rebel against the decision, but to join her in thankfulness that no
shade need be cast over the remembrance of the happy hours spent
together; and begging him not to grieve, since she had, after the first
pain, been able to acquiesce in the belief that the separation might
conduce to his happiness; and she should always regard him as one of
those most near and dear to her, and rejoice in whatever was for his
welfare, glad that his heart was still young enough to form new ties.
'Forgive me for speaking thus,' she added; 'I know that it may wound
you now, but there may come a time when it may make you feel more at
ease and unfettered; and I could not endure to imagine that the
affection which you brought yourself to lavish on one so unworthy,
should stand in the way of your happiness for life.'  She desired him
to make no answer, but to consider this as the final dissolution: and
she concluded by all that she thought would prove most consoling, as to
the present state of affairs with her; and with a few affectionate
words, to show that he was still a great deal to her, though everything
he might not be.
This done, Mary faced her life in the New World.  She had to form her
habits for herself, for her importance in the house was gone; but she
went to work resolutely, and, lonely as she was, she had far more
resources than if she had never been at Ormersfield.  She had many
hours to herself, and she unpacked her books, and set herself courses
of study, to which Louis had opened the door.  She unveiled her eyes to
natural history, and did not find flower or butterfly unsoothing. She
undertook the not very hopeful task of teaching a tiny negro imp, who
answered the purpose of a bell, to read and work; and she was
persevering in her efforts to get Xavier and Dolores to make her father
comfortable.
Her father was decidedly glad of her company.  He liked conversation,
and enjoyed the morning meeting, to which Mr. Ward was often a welcome
addition, delighting in anything so English, and finding Miss Ponsonby
much improved by her introduction to English society. Sometimes Mary
wrote for her father, and now and then was consulted; and she was
always grateful for whatever made her feel herself of use.  She was on
kind and friendly terms with Rosita, but they did not become more
intimate than at first.  The Senora was swinging in a hammock
half-asleep, with a cigarette between her lips, all the morning; and
when she emerged from this torpid state, in a splendid toilette, she
had too many more congenial friends often to need her step-daughter in
her visits, her expeditions to lotteries, and her calls on her old
friends the nuns.  On a fast-day, or any other occasion that kept her
at home, she either arranged her jewels, discussed her dresses, or had
some lively chatter, which she called learning English.  She coaxed,
fondled, and domineered prettily over Mr. Ponsonby; and he looked on
amused, gratified her caprices, caressed her, and seemed to regard her
as a pretty pet and plaything.
CHAPTER VI.
THE TWO PENDRAGONS.
The red dragon and the white,
Hard together gan they smite,
With mouth, paw, and tail,
Between hem was full hard batail.
The History of Merlin.
SPRING was on the borders of summer, when one afternoon, as Clara sat
writing a note in the drawing-room, she heard a tap at the door of the
little sitting-room, and springing to open it, she beheld a welcome
sight.
'Louis!  How glad I am!  Where do you come from?'
'Last from the station,' said Louis.
'What makes you knock at that door, now the drawing-room is alive?'
'I could not venture on an unceremonious invasion of Mrs. James Frost's
territory.'
'You'll find no distinction of territory here,' laughed Clara.  'It was
a fiction that we were to live in separate rooms, like naughty
children.  Does not the drawing-room look nice?'
'As much improved as the inhabitant.  Where are the other natives?'
'Granny and Isabel are walking, and will end by picking up Jem coming
out of school.  We used to wait for him so often, that at last he said
we should be laughed at, so there's a law against it which no one dares
to transgress but granny.'
'So I conclude that you are a happy family.'
'After all, it was worth spending two years at school to enjoy properly
the having it over.'
'I give Jem credit for having secured a first-rate governess for you.'
'That she is!  Why, with her I really do like reading and drawing all
the morning!  I almost believe that some day I shall wake up and find
myself an accomplished young lady!  And, Louis, have you read the last
Western Magazine?'
'I have read very little for sport lately.'
'Then I must tell you.  Jem was bemoaning himself about having nothing
to give to the new Blind Asylum, and the next evening Isabel brought
out the prettiest little manuscript book, tied with blue ribbon, and
told him to do as he pleased with it.  It was a charming account of her
expedition to the Hebrides, written out for her sisters, without a
notion of anything further; but Jem sent it to this Magazine, and it is
accepted, and the first part is out.  She will have quite a sum for it,
and all is to go to the Blind Asylum!'
'Capital!--Let me take it home to night, Clara, and I will stand an
examination on it to-morrow.'
'We ask her whether she projects a sketch of the Paris Revolution,'
said Clara, laughing.  'She has a famous heap of manuscripts in her
desk, and one long story about a Sir Roland, who had his name before
she knew Jem, but it is all unfinished, she tore out a great many
pages, and has to make a new finish; and I am afraid the poor knight is
going to die of a mortal wound at his lady's feet.  Isabel likes sad
things best;--but oh! here they come, and I'm talking dreadful treason.'
Three more joyous-looking people could hardly have been found than
those who entered the room, welcoming Louis with delight, and asking
what good wind had brought him.
'Partly that Inglewood is crying out for the master's eye,' said Louis;
'and partly that my father fancied I looked fagged, and kindly let me
run down for a holiday.'
'I am of his mind,' said Mrs. Frost, tenderly; 'there is an M.P.
expression gathering on your brows, Louis.'
'For you to dispel, Aunt Kitty.  I told him you were the best
dissipation, and Virginia was of the same mind.  Isabel, she says
Dynevor Terrace is the only place she ever wishes to see again.'
'Do you often see Virginia?' asked Isabel.
'Not unless I go early, and beg for her; and then she generally has
some master.  That last onset of accomplishments is serious!'
'Yes,' said Isabel, 'the sense of leisure and tranquillity here is
marvellous!'
'Not leisure in the sense of idleness,' said James.
'No,' said Isabel; 'but formerly idle requirements thronged my time,
and for nothing worth doing could I find leisure.'
'There is nothing more exacting than idle requirements,' said James.
'Pray is Clara accepting that invitation?  Come to dinner, Louis, and
give us an excuse.'
'No, he won't,' said Mrs. Frost, 'he will take my side.  These young
people want to cast off all their neighbours.'
'Now, granny,' exclaimed James, 'have we not dutifully dined all round?
Did not Isabel conduct Clara to that ball?  Is it not hard to reproach
us with sighing at an evening immolated at the shrine of the
Richardsons?'
'Well, my dears, you must judge.'
'I am ready to do whatever you think right; I leave you to settle it,'
said Isabel, moving out of the room, that Louis might be free for a
more intimate conversation.
'Now,' cried James, 'is it in the nature of things that she should live
in such society as Mrs. Walby's and Mrs. Richardson's?  People who call
her Mrs. James!'
'Such a queen as she looks among them!' said Clara.
'One comfort is, they don't like that,' said James.  'Even Mrs. Calcott
is not flattered by her precedence.  I hope we shall soon be dropped
out of their parties.  As long as I do my duty by their sons, what
right have they to impose the penance of their society on my wife?  All
the irksomeness of what she has left, and none of the compensations!'
'Blissful solitude' said Louis, 'thereto I leave you.'
'You are not going yet!  You mean to dine here?' was the cry.
'My dear friends,' he said, holding up his hands, 'if you only knew how
I long to have no one to speak to!'
'You crying out for silence!' exclaimed James.
'I am panting for what I have not had these five months--space for my
thoughts to turn round.'
'Surely you are at liberty to form your own habits!' said James.
'I am told so whenever my father sees me receive a note,' said Louis,
wearily; 'but I see that, habituated as he is to living alone, he is
never really at ease unless I am in the way; so I make our hours agree
as far as our respective treadmills permit; and though we do not speak
much, I can never think in company.'
'Don't you have your rides to yourself?'
'Why, no.  My father will never ride enough to do him good, unless he
wants to do me good.  People are all surprised to see him looking so
well; the country lanes make him quite blooming.'
'But not you, my poor boy,' said his aunt; 'I am afraid it is a sad
strain.'
'There now, Aunt Kitty, I am gone.  I must have the pleasure of looking
natural sometimes, without causing any vituperation of any one beyond
seas.'
'You shall look just as you please if you will only stay.  We are just
going to dinner.'
'Thank you, let me come to-morrow.  I shall be better company when I
have had my sulk out.'
His aunt followed him to the stairs, and he turned to her, saying,
anxiously, 'No letter?'  She shook her head.  'It would be barely
possible,' he said, 'but if it would only come while I am at home in
peace!'
'Ah! this is sadly trying!' said she, parting his hair on his brow as
he stood some steps below her, and winning a sweet smile from him.
'All for the best,' he said.  'One thing may mitigate another.  That
political whirlpool might suck me in, if I had any heart or hopes for
it.  And, on the other hand, it would be very unwholesome to be left to
my own inertness--to be as good for nothing as I feel.'
'My poor dear boy, you are very good about it.  I wish you could have
been spared.'
'I did not come to make you sad, Aunt Kitty,' he replied, smiling; 'no;
I get some energy back when I remember that this may be a probation.
Her mother would not have thought me man enough, and that is what I
have to work for.  Whether this end well or not, she is the leading
star of my life.'  And, with the renewal of spirit with which he had
spoken, he pressed his aunt's hand, and ran down stairs.
When he rode to Northwold, the following afternoon, having spent the
morning in walking over his fields, he overtook a most comfortable
couple--James and Isabel, returning from their holiday stroll, and
Louis, leaving his horse at the inn, and joining them, began to hear
all their school affairs.  James had thrown his whole heart into his
work, had been making various reforms, introducing new studies, making
a point of religious instruction, and meditating on a course of
lectures on history, to be given in the evenings, the attendance to be
voluntary, but a prize held out for proficiency.  Louis took up the
subject eagerly, and Isabel entered into the discussion with all her
soul, and the grammar-school did indeed seem to be in a way to become
something very superior in tone to anything Northwold had formerly
seen, engrossing as it did all the powers of a man of such ability, in
the full vigour of youth.
Talking earnestly, the trio had reached the Terrace, and James was
unlatching the iron gate, when he interrupted himself in the midst of
detailing his views on modern languages to say, 'No, I have nothing for
you.'
'Sir, I beg your pardon!' was the quick reply from a withered, small,
but not ill-dressed old man, 'I only asked--'
'Let the lady pass,' said James, peremptorily, wishing to save his wife
from annoyance, 'it is of no use, I never look at petitions.'
'Surely he is not a beggar!' said Isabel, as he drew her on.
'You may be easy about him, my dear,' said James.  'He has laid hold of
Louis, who would swallow the whole Spanish legion of impostors. He will
be after us directly with a piteous story.'
Louis was after him, with a face more than half arch fun--'Jem, Jem, it
is your uncle!'
'Nonsense!  How can you be so taken in!  Don't go and disappoint
granny--I'll settle him.'
'Take care, Jem--it is Oliver, and no mistake!  Why, he is as like you
as Pendragon blood can make him!  Go and beg his pardon.'
James hastened down stairs, as Louis bounded up--sought Mrs. Frost in
the sitting-rooms, and, without ceremony, rushed up and knocked at the
bed-room door.  Jane opened it.
'He is come!' cried Louis--'Oliver is come.'
Old Jane gave a shriek, and ran back wildly, clapping her hands.  Her
mistress started forward--'Come!--where?'
'Here!--in the hall with Jem.'
He feared that he had been too precipitate, for she hid her face in her
hands; but it was the intensity of thanksgiving; and though her whole
frame was in a tremor, she flew rather than ran forward, never even
seeing Louis's proffered arm.  He had only reached the landing-place,
when beneath he heard the greeting--'Mother, I can take you
home--Cheveleigh is yours.'  But to her the words were drowned in her
own breathless cry--'My boy! my boy!'  She saw, knew, heard nothing,
save that the son, missed and mourned for thirty-four years, was safe
within her arms, the longing void filled up.  She saw not that the
stripling had become a worn and elderly man,--she recked not how he
came.  He was Oliver, and she had him again!  What was the rest to her?
Those words?  They might be out of taste, but Fitzjocelyn guessed that
to speak them at the first meeting had been the vision of Oliver's
life--the object to which he had sacrificed everything. And yet how
chill and unheeded they fell!
Louis could have stood moralizing, but his heart had begun to throb at
the chance that Oliver brought tidings of Mary.  He felt himself an
intrusive spectator, and hastened into the drawing-room, when Clara
nearly ran against him, but stood still.  'I beg your pardon, but what
is Isabel telling me?  Is it really?'
'Really!  Kindred blood signally failed to speak.'
Clara took a turn up and down the room.  'I say, Louis, ought I to go
down?'
'No; leave him and granny to their happiness,' said Louis; and James,
at the same moment running up, threw himself into a chair, with an
emphatic 'There!'
'Dear grandmamma!' said Isabel; 'I hope it is not too much for her.'
James made no answer.
'Are you disappointed in him, dear James?' she continued.
'I could not be disappointed,' he answered, shortly.
'Poor man--he has a poor welcome among you,' said Louis.
'Welcome is not to be bought,' said James.  'I could not stand hearing
him reply to poor granny's heartfelt rapture with his riches and his
Cheveleigh, as if that were all she could prize.'
Steps were mounting the stairs, and the alert, sharp tones of Oliver
were heard--'Married then?  Should have waited--done it in style.'
James and Isabel glanced at each other in amused indignation; and Mrs.
Frost entered, tremulous with joy, and her bright hazel eyes lustrous
with tears, as she leant on the arm of her recovered son. He was a
little, spare, shrivelled man, drolly like his nephew, but with all the
youthfulness dried out of him, the freckles multiplied by scores, and
the keen black eyes sunken, sharpened, and surrounded with innumerable
shrewd puckers.  The movements were even more brisk, as if time were
money; and in speech, the small change of particles was omitted, and
every word seemed bitten off short at the end; the whole man, in
gesture, manner, and voice, an almost grotesque caricature of all
James's peculiarities.
'Mrs. Roland Dynevor, I presume? said Oliver, as Isabel came forward to
meet him.
'Never so known hitherto,' returned her husband.  'My wife is Mrs.
James Frost, if you please.'
'That is over now,' said Oliver, consequentially; and as his mother
presented to him 'poor Henry's little Clara,' he kissed her
affectionately, saying, 'Well-grown young lady, upon my word!  Like her
father--that's right.'
'Here is almost another grandchild,' said Mrs. Frost--'Louis
Fitzjocelyn--not much like the Fitzjocelyn you remember, but a new M.P.
as he was then.'
'Humph!' said Oliver, with a dry sound, apparently expressing, 'So that
is what our Parliament is made of.  Father well?' he asked.
'Quite well, thank you, sir.'
Oliver levelled his keen eyes on him, as though noting down
observations, while he was burning for tidings of Mary, yet held back
by reserve and sense of the uncongeniality of the man.  His aunt,
however, in the midst of her own joy, marked his restless eye, and put
the question, whether Mary Ponsonby had arrived?
'Ha! you let her go, did you?' said Oliver, turning on Louis.  'I told
her father you'd be no such fool.  He was in a proper rage at your
letter, but it would have blown over if you had stuck by her, and he is
worth enough to set you all on your legs.'
Louis could not bring himself to make any answer, and his mother
interrupted by a question as to Dona Rosita.
'Like all the rest.  Eyes and feet, that's all.  Foolish business! But
what possessed Ormersfield to make such a blunder?  I never saw
Ponsonby in such a tantrum, and his are no trifles.'
'It was all the fault of your clerk, Robson,' said James; 'he would not
refute the story.'
'Sharp fellow, Robson,' chuckled Oliver; 'couldn't refute it.  No; as
he told me, he knew the way Ponsonby had gone on ever since his wife
went home, and of late he had sent him to Guayaquil, about the
Equatorial Navigation--so he had seen nothing;--and, says he to me, he
had no notion of bringing out poor Miss Ponsonby--did not know whether
her father would thank him; and yet the best of it is, that he pacifies
Ponsonby with talking of difficulty of dealing with preconceived
notions.  Knows how to get hold of him.  Marriage would never have been
if he had been there, but it was the less damage. Mary would have had
more reason to have turned about, if she had not found him married.'
'But, Oliver,' said his mother, 'I thought this Robson was an honest
man, in whom you had entire confidence!'
'Ha! ha!  D'ye think I'd put that in any man?  No, no; he knows how
far to go with me.  I've plenty of checks on him.  Can't get business
done but by a wide-awake chap like that.'
'Is Madison under him?' asked Louis, feeling as if he had been
apprenticing the boy to a chief of banditti.
'The lad you sent out?  Ay.  Left him up at the mines.  Sharp fellow,
but too raw for the office yet.'
'Too scrupulous!' said James, in an undertone, while his uncle was
explaining to his mother that he could not have come away without
leaving Robson to manage his affairs, and Mr. Ponsonby, and telling
exultingly some stories of the favourite clerk's sharp practice.
The party went down together in a not very congenial state.
Next to Mrs. Frost's unalloyed gladness, the most pleasant spectacle
was old Jane, who volunteered her services in helping to wait, that she
might have the delight of hovering about Master Oliver, to whom she
attended exclusively, and would not let Charlotte so much as offer him
the potatoes.  And Charlotte was in rather an excited state at the
presence of a Peruvian production, and the flutter of expecting a
letter which would make her repent of the smiles and blushes she had
expended over an elaborate Valentine, admired as an original
production, and valued the more, alas! because poor Marianne had
received none.  Charlotte was just beginning to repent of her
ungenerous triumph, and agitation made her waiting less deft and pretty
than usual; but this mattered the less, since to Oliver any attendance
by women-servants was a shock, as were the small table and plain fare;
and he looked round uneasily.
'Here is an old friend, Oliver,' said his mother, taking up a curious
old soup-ladle.
'I see.  It will take some time to get up the stock of plate.  I shall
give an order as I pass through London.  To be engraved with the
Dynevor crest as before, or would you prefer the lozenge, ma'am?'
'Oh, my dear, don't talk of it now!  I am only sorry this is nothing
but mutton-broth; but that's what comes of sudden arrivals, Oliver.'
'It shall be remedied at home,' said Oliver, as if he considered
mutton-broth as one degree from famine.
'I know you had it for me,' said Louis.  'If Jane excels in one art
before all others, it is in mutton-broth.'
Oliver darted a glance as if he imagined this compliment to be mere
derision of his mother and Jane.
Things went on in this style all the evening.  Oliver had two
ideas--Cheveleigh, and the Equatorial Steam Navigation Company--and on
these he rang the changes.
There was something striking in his devotion of a lifetime to redeem
his mother's fortunes, but the grandeur was not easily visible in the
detail.  He came down on Dynevor Terrace as a consequential, moneyed
man, contemptuous of the poverty which he might have alleviated, and
obtruding tardy and oppressive patronage.  He rubbed against the new
generation in too many places for charity or gratitude to be easy. He
was utterly at variance with taste, and openly broached unworthy
sentiments and opinions, and his kindness and his displeasure were
equally irksome.  If such repugnance to him were felt even by Louis,
the least personally affected, and the best able to sympathize with his
aunt; it was far stronger in James, abhorring patronage, sensible that,
happen what might, his present perfect felicity must be disturbed, and
devoid of any sentiment for Cheveleigh that could make the restoration
compensate for the obligation so unpleasantly enforced; and Isabel's
fastidious taste made her willing to hold aloof as far as might be
without vexing the old lady.
There was no amalgamation.  Fitzjocelyn and Isabel were near the
window, talking over her former home and her sisters, and all the
particulars of the society which she had left, and he had entered;
highly interesting to themselves and to the listening Clara, but to the
uninitiated sounding rather like 'taste, Shakspeare, and the musical
glasses.'
Oliver and his mother, sitting close together, were living in an old
world; asking and answering many a melancholy question on friends, dead
or lost sight of, and yet these last they always made sure that they
should find when they went home to Cheveleigh--that home to which the
son reverted with unbroken allegiance; while the whole was interspersed
with accounts of his plans, and explanations of his vast designs for
the renovation of the old place.
James hovered on the outskirts of both parties, too little at ease to
attach himself to either; fretted by his wife's interest in a world to
which he was a stranger, impatient of his uncle's plans, and trebly
angered by observing the shrewd curious glances which the old man cast
from time to time towards the pair by the window. Fortunately, Mrs.
Frost was still too absolutely wrapt in maternal transport to mark the
clouds that were gathering over her peace.  To look at her son, wait on
him, and hear his voice, so fully satisfied her, that as yet it made
little difference what that voice said, and it never entered her mind
to suppose that all her dear ones were not sharing her bliss.
'You were the first to tell me,' she said, as she bade Louis good night
with fondness additional to her messenger of good news; but, as he
pressed her dear old trembling hand, his heart misgave him whether her
joy might not be turned to pain; and when he congratulated Jane, and
heard her call it a blessed day, he longed to be certain that it would
prove so.
And, before he could sleep that night, he wrote a letter to Tom
Madison, warning him to let no temptation nor bad example lead him
aside from strict justice and fair dealing; and advising him rather to
come home, and give up all prospects of rising, than not preserve his
integrity.
James and Isabel were not merciful to their uncle when they could speak
of him without restraint; and began to conjecture his intentions with
regard to them.
'You don't wish to become an appendage to Cheveleigh?' said James,
fondly.
'I! who never knew happiness till I came here!'
'I do not know what my uncle may propose,' said James, 'but I know you
coincide in my determination that he shall never interfere with the
duties of my office.'
'You do not imagine that he wishes it?'
'I know he wishes I were not in Holy Orders.  I knew he disliked it at
the time of my ordination; but if he wished me to act according to his
views, he should have given himself the right to dictate.'
'By not neglecting you all your youth.'
'Not that I regret or resent what concerns myself; but it was his
leaving me a burden on my grandmother that drove me to become a
clergyman, and a consistent one I will be, not an idle heir-apparent to
this estate, receiving it as his gift, not my own birthright.'
'An idle clergyman!  Never! never!' cried Isabel.  'I should not
believe it was you!  And the school--you could not leave it just as
your plans are working, and the boys improving?'
'Certainly not; it would be fatal to abandon it to that stick, Powell.
Ah! Isabel,' as he looked at her beautiful countenance, 'how I pity the
man who has not a high-minded wife!  Suppose you came begging and
imploring me not to give any umbrage to the man, because you so doted
upon diamonds.'
'The less merit when one has learnt that they are very cold hard
stones,' said Isabel, smiling.
Isabel was a high-minded wife, but she would have been a still better
one if her loving admiration had allowed her to soften James, or to
question whether pride and rancour did not lurk unperceived in the
midst of the really high and sound motives that prompted him.
While their grandmother could only see Oliver on the best side, James
and Isabel could only see him on the worst, and lost the greatness of
the design in the mercenary habits that exclusive perseverance in it
had produced.  It had been a false greatness, but they could not grant
the elevation of mind that had originally conceived it.
The following day was Sunday, and nothing worse took place than little
skirmishes, in which the uncle and nephew's retort and rejoinder were
so drolly similar, that Clara found herself thinking of Miss
Faithfull's two sandy cats over a mouse; but she kept her simile to
herself, finding that Isabel regarded the faintest, gentlest comparison
of the two gentlemen almost as an affront.  All actual debate was
staved off by Mrs. Frost's entreaty that business discussion should be
deferred.  'Humph!' said Oliver, 'you reign here, ma'am, but that's not
the way we get on at Lima.'
'I dare say,' said James.
Mrs. Frost's joy was still undimmed.  It was almost a trance of
gladness, trembling in her smile, and overflowing in her eye, at every
congratulation and squeeze of the hand from her friends.
'Dear Jemmy,' said she, taking his arm as they went home in the
evening, 'did not that psalm seem meant for us?--'If riches increase,
set not your heart upon them.''
James had been thinking it meant for some one; but, as he said,
'certainly not for you, dear granny.'
'Ah! snares of wealth were set far enough from me for a time!  I never
felt so covetous as when there was a report that there was to be an
opposition school.  But now your dear uncle is bringing prosperity
back, I must take care not to set my heart even on what he has gained
for me.'
'I defy riches to hurt you,' said James, smiling.
'Ah!  Jemmy, you didn't know me as a county grandee,' she said, with a
bright sad look, 'when your poor grandpapa used to dress me up. I'm an
old woman now, past vanities, but I never could sit as loose to them as
your own dear wife does.  I never tried.  Well, it will be changed
enough; but I shall be glad to see poor old Cheveleigh.  It does me
good to hear poor Oliver call it home.  If only we had your dear
father!'
'To me Dynevor Terrace is home,' said James.
'A happy home it has been,' said the old lady.
''Goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life!'  And
now, Oliver, whom I never thought to see again--oh! what can I do to be
thankful enough!  I knew what he was doing!  I knew he was not what you
all thought him!  And roughing it has been no harm to you or Clara, and
it is all over now!  And the dear old place comes back to the old name.
Oh, James, I can sometimes hardly contain myself--that my poor boy has
done it, and all for me, and his brother's children!'
James could scarcely find it in his heart to say a single word to damp
her joy, and all his resolution enabled him to do was to say gently,
'You know, dear granny, we must not forget that I am a clergyman.'
'I know.  I have been telling your uncle so; but we can do something.
You might take the curacy, and do a great deal of good.  There used to
be wild places sadly neglected in my time.  I hope that, since it has
been given back to us, we may feel it more as a stewardship than I did
when it was mine.'
James sighed, and looked softened and thoughtful.
'Your uncle means to purchase an annuity for Jane,' she added; 'and if
we could only think what to do for the Faithfulls!  I wonder whether
they would come and stay with us.  At least they can never vex
themselves again at not paying rent!'
After a pause--'Jem, my dear, could you manage to give your uncle the
true account of your marriage?  He admires Isabel very much, I can tell
you, and is pleased at the connexion.  But I fancy, though he will not
say so, that Mr. Ponsonby has desired him to find out all he can about
Louis; and unluckily they have persuaded themselves that poor Louis
courted Isabel, supposing that she was to have Beauchastel, and,
finding his error, betook himself to Mary.'
'Turning Isabel over to me!  Extremely flattering.'
'Now, Jem, don't be angry.  It is only foolish talk!  But unluckily I
can't persuade your uncle not to think the real story all my
partiality; and you might do much more, if it be not too unpleasant to
you.'
'Thank you, granny, it is out of the question.  If it were as he does
us the honour to imagine, I should be the last person to confess it. My
evidence could be of no service to Fitzjocelyn, when my uncle's maxim
is to place confidence in no one.  The sole refutation in my power is
the terms on which we meet.'
'Now, I have vexed you.  I wish I had said nothing about it; but when
dear Louis's happiness may depend on his report--'
'If I were base enough to have acted as he supposes, I should be base
enough to deny it.  There is not enough to be hoped to make me speak
with unreserve on such a subject.'
He saved himself from saying--to such a man; but the shrewd, suspicious
old bachelor was not an inviting confidant for the vicissitudes of
delicate and tender feelings of such recent date, and Mrs. Frost
reproached herself with asking too much of her proud, sensitive
grandson.
The black gown and trencher cap by no means gratified Oliver, when
James set off to school on Monday morning; but he consoled himself with
observing, 'We shall soon put an end to that.'
'James is quite devoted to the school,' said Isabel, and she was
answered by the dry growl.
'It will be a hard thing to transplant our young people,' said Mrs.
Frost, 'they have managed to be very happy here.'
'So hard of transplantation that I doubt the possibility,' said Isabel.
'You have made us take very deep root here.'
'Have you ever seen Cheveleigh, Mrs. Dynevor?'
'Never.'
'Poor Oliver! you and I think no place equal to our birthplace,' said
Mrs. Frost.
'I should think Mrs. Roland Dynevor would find it compensation.  How
many beds did we make up, mother, the year my father was sheriff?'
'You must go to Jane for that,' said his mother, laughing.  'I'm sure I
never knew.'
'I believe it was twenty-seven,' said Oliver, gravely.  'I know there
were one hundred and eighty-five persons at the ball, and that the room
was hung with blue brocade, mother; and you opened the ball with Lord
Francis.  I remember you had violet satin and white blonde.'
'My dear, how can you remember such things!  You were a little bit of a
schoolboy!'
'I was sixteen' said Oliver.  'It was the year '13.  I will have the
drawing-room hung with blue brocade, and I think Mrs. Roland Dynevor
will own that nothing can exceed it.'
'Very likely,' said Isabel, indifferently; and she escaped, beckoning
with her Clara, who was rather entertained with the reminiscences over
which granny and Uncle Oliver seemed ready to linger for ever; and yet
she was rather ashamed of her own amusement and interest, when she
heard her sister-in-law say, 'If he did but know how weary I am of that
hateful thing, a great house!'
'I hope Cheveleigh is not grander than Ormersfield,' said Clara, in an
odd sort of voice.
The ladies, for the first time, did not sit together this morning.
Clara practised, and Isabel took the Chapel in the Valley out of her
desk, and began a process of turning the Sir Roland into Sir Hubert.
Oliver and his mother were in the sitting-room, and, on James's return
from school in the middle of the day, he was summoned thither. Mrs.
Frost was sitting by the fire, rather tearful and nervous, and her son
stood full in the front, as dignified and magnanimous as size and
features would permit, and the same demeanour was instantly and
unconsciously assumed by his nephew, who was beyond measure chafed by
the attempt at a grand coup.
'I have requested your presence,' began Oliver, 'as the eldest son of
my elder brother, and thus, after my mother, the head of our family.
You are aware that when unfortunate circumstances involved my mother's
property, it was my determination to restore the inheritance to her,
and to my dear brother Henry.  For this object, I have worked for the
last thirty-four years, and a fortunate accident having brought our
family estate into the market, I have been enabled to secure it.  I am
now ready to make it over to my mother, with entail to yourself and
your heirs, as representatives of my brother Henry, and settling five
thousand pounds on your sister, as the portion to which the younger
children of our family have always been entitled. If you are willing to
reside at our family seat with my mother, I will assure you of a
suitable allowance during her lifetime, and--'
Nothing was more intolerable to a man like James than a shower of
obligations; and his spirit, angered at the very length of the address,
caught at the first opening for avoiding gratitude, and beheld in the
last proposal an absolute bribe to make him sacrifice his sacred
ministry, and he burst forth, 'Sir, I am much obliged to you, but no
offers shall induce me to forsake the duties of my calling.'
'You mistake, if you think I want anything unclerical.  No occasion to
hunt--Mr. Tresham used in my day--no one thought the worse of
him--unlucky your taking Orders.'
'There is no use in entering on that point,' said James.  'No other
course was left open to me, and my profession cannot be taken up nor
laid down as a matter of convenience.'
'Young men are taught to think more seriously than they were in our
day,' said Mrs. Frost.  'I told you that you must not try to make him
turn squire.'
'Well! well! good living may be had perhaps.  Move to Cheveleigh, and
look out for it at leisure, if nothing else will content him.  But
we'll have this drudgery given up.  I'll not go home and show my
nephew, heir of the Dynevors, keeping a third-rate grammar-school,'
said Oliver, with his one remaining Eton quality of contempt for
provincial schools.
The Northwold scholar and master were both roused to arms in James.
'Sir,' he said, 'you should have thought of that when you left this
heir of the Dynevors to be educated by the charity of this third-rate
grammar-school.'
'Is this your gratitude, sir!' passionately exclaimed Oliver; 'I, who
have toiled my whole life for your benefit, might look for another
return.'
'It was not for me,' said James.  'It was for family pride.  Had it
been from the affection that claims gratitude, you would not have left
your mother in her old age, to labour unaided for the support of your
brother's orphans.  For ourselves, I thank you; the habits nurtured by
poverty are the best education; but I cannot let you suppose that a
grand theatrical restoration can atone to me for thirty years' neglect
of my grandmother, or that my gratitude can be extorted by benefactions
at the expense of her past suffering.'
'Jem! dear Jem! what are you saying!' cried Mrs. Frost.  'Don't you
know how kindly your uncle meant?  Don't you know how happy we have
been?'
'You may forgive.  You are his mother, and you were injured, but I can
never forget what I have seen you undergo.'
'You foolish boy, to forget all our happiness--'
'Nor,' proceeded James, 'can I consent to forego the career of
usefulness that has been opened to me.'
'But, Jem, you could be so useful in the parish! and your uncle could
not wish you to do anything unhandsome by the trustees--'
'I wish him to do nothing, ma'am,' said Oliver.  'If he is too high and
mighty to accept a favour, it is his own loss.  We can do without him,
if he prefers the Fitzjocelyn patronage.  Much good may it do him!'
James deigned no answer, looked at his watch, and found it time to
return to the school.
Oliver broke out into angry exclamations, and his mother did her utmost
to soothe him.  He had no turn for being a country-gentleman, he was
fit for nothing but his counting-house, and he intended to return
thither as soon as he had installed his mother at Cheveleigh; and so
entirely did all his plans hinge upon his nephew, that even now he was
persuaded to hold out his forgiveness, on condition that James would
apologize, resign the school, and call himself Dynevor.
Mrs. Frost hoped that Isabel would prevail on her husband to listen
favourably; but Isabel gloried in his impracticability, and would have
regarded any attempt at mediation as an unworthy effort to turn him
aside from the path of duty.  She replied, that she would never say a
word to change his notions of right, and she treated poor Oliver with
all the lofty reserve that she had formerly practised upon possible
suitors.
When Fitzjocelyn came in the afternoon to take leave, before his return
to London, Mrs. Frost begged him to use his influence with James.  'Who
would have thought it would have so turned out?' she said.  'My poor
Oliver! to be so met after all his generous plans! and yet Jem does
want to do right!'
Unfortunately, Louis felt that, to own Oliver's generosity, it was
necessary to be out of sight of him; and finding that there was silence
and constraint in the drawing-room, he asked Isabel to walk with him to
meet James.
'One breathes freely!' said she, as they left the house.  'Was there
ever a more intolerable man?'
'Never was a man who made a more unlucky error in judgment.'
'And that is all you call it?'
'The spurious object warped the mind aside,' said Louis.  'The grand
idea was too exclusive, and now he suffers for the exclusiveness.  It
is melancholy to see the cinder of a burnt-offering to Mammon,
especially when the offering was meant for better things.'
In this strain he chose to talk, without coming to particulars, till,
near the corner of the old square, they met the shouting throng of
boys, and presently James himself, descending the steps of the grim old
grey building.
'I thought you would forgive me for coming to meet you under such an
escort,' said Isabel, 'especially as it was to escape from our Peruvian
relative.'
'Poor man! it was a great pity he did not come last year!' said Louis.
'I am glad I have no temptation to bend to his will,' returned James.
'Ha!  I like the true core of the quarrel to display itself.'
'Fitzjocelyn, you do not mean that you do not fully approve of the
course I have taken!'
'Extremely magnanimous, but not quite unprecedented.  Witness St.
Ronan's Well, where the younger Scrogie abjures the name of Mowbray.'
'Pshaw!  Louis, can't you understand?  Frost is a glorious name to me,
recording my grandmother's noble exertions on our behalf, but I can
imagine it to be hateful to him, recalling the neglect that made her
slaving necessary.'
'For which amiable reason you insist on obtruding it.  Pray, are the
houses henceforth to be Frost Terrace or Arctic Row?'
'Are you come to laugh or to remonstrate?' exclaimed James, stopping.
'Oh! you want to put on your armour!  Certainly, I should never tell if
I were come to remonstrate, nor should I venture in such a case--'
'Then you are come to approve,' said Isabel.  I knew it!'
'Little you two care--each of you sure of an admiring double.'
'I care for your opinion as much as ever I did,' said James.
'Exactly so,' said Louis, laughing.
'I desire to have your judgment in this matter.'
'If I could judge, I would,' said Louis.  'I see you right in
principle, but are you right in spirit?  I own my heart bleeds for Aunt
Kitty, regaining her son to battle with her grandson.'
'I am very sorry for her,' said James; 'but it can't be helped.  I
cannot resign my duties here for the sake of living dependent on a
suitable allowance.'
'Ah! Jem! Jem!  Oliver little knew the damage his neglect did you.'
'What damage?'
'The fostering an ugly little imp of independence.'
'Aye! you grandees have naturally a distaste for independence, and make
common cause against it.'
'Especially when in a rabid state.  Take care, Jem.  Independence never
was a Christian duty yet--'
'Then, you want me to go and live on the hoards for the sake of which
my grandmother was left to toil.  You would like to see me loitering
about, pensioned to swell the vanity of Cheveleigh, neglecting my vows,
forsaking my duties--'
'You unreasonable man!  Is there no way in this whole world for you to
do your duty as a clergyman, but hearing Northwold boys the Latin
grammar?'
'Then, what do you want me to do?'
'I don't want you to do anything.  You are the man to know what is
right; only, Isabel, don't help him to hate people more than can
possibly be avoided; and don't break dear Aunt Kitty's heart amongst
you.  That's what I care most about!'
When Louis bade his aunt farewell, he threw his arm round her neck,
looked fondly at her, and said, 'Dear aunt, you won't let them tease
you?'
'No, my dear, I am getting past being teased,' she said.  'Vexations
don't hurt me as much as love does me good, and they'll not forget
their affection.  It is all goodness in Jem, and poor Oliver will
understand it when I have got him into our home ways again; but he has
been so long away from home, poor fellow!'
'That's right.  I won't be uneasy for you.  Squabble as they will, they
won't hurt you. But, oh!  Dynevor Terrace without you!'
'Ah! you must come to me at home!'
'Home!  I'm like Jem, jealous for this old house.'
'It is odd how little I feel these things,' said his aunt.  'If any one
had told me, when I tore myself away from Cheveleigh, that I should
have it back, how little I should have thought that I could take it so
easily!  I wonder at myself when I wake in the morning that I am not
more moved by it, nor by leaving this dear old place. I suppose it is
because I have not long to stay anywhere.  I can keep nothing in my
head, but that I have got my Oliver!'
'I believe it is the peace that is not of this world!' said Louis.
CHAPTER VII.
ROLAND AND OLIVER
'Twas old ancestral pride,
'Twas hope to raise a fallen house
From penury's disgrace,
To purchase back from usurers
The birthright of his race.
The Lump of Gold--C. MACKAY.
Mary's letter arrived not long after Louis's return to London; and her
calm, serious, beautifully-expressed farewell came upon him at last
like a blow which had been long impending, but of which preparation had
failed to lessen the weight.
'Ah!' said the Earl, when the chief part had been read to him, 'she is
admirable and excellent as ever.  It is a great disappointment that she
is unattainable, but I am glad she writes so sensibly, and sees that it
is right you should think no more about her.  After all, the connexion
with that fellow Ponsonby might have been very troublesome, and it is
well, as she says, that it was all over while you are so young.'
'Young or old, there is no other Mary in the world,' said Louis, sadly.
'We will say no more about it now.  I understand you, but you will
think differently by-and-by.'
Louis did not answer.  He knew that others might have been deceived by
the tardiness and uncertainty of his attachment, but that it had taken
such deep root, that he believed he could no more detach himself from
Mary than if she were his wife.  His heart fainted as he thought of
years without the strength and soothing which her very letter breathed
forth; as he pictured to himself alternations between his chill and
stately home and the weary maze of London, foresaw persuasions from his
father to induce him to form some new attachment, and dreaded to think
of the facility with which, perhaps, he might still be led out of his
own convictions.  Yet he still believed that patience and perseverance
would win the day, and tried to derive encouragement and energy from
the thought that this might be a trial sent for the very purpose of
training him in steadfastness.
A strong impulse drew him to Bryanston Square, where Miss Ponsonby was
very kind and warm, the more so because she had discovered how much
easier it had been to say than to unsay, and strongly regretted the
injustice she had done him.  He had the satisfaction of talking for a
good hour about Mary, and of sending a message, that he did not write
because he wished to be guided by her in everything, and that he was
striving to work so as to please her.  The conversation ended with some
good auguries as to the effect of Oliver's return to Peru; and Louis
went away cheered, bearing the final dismissal better than his father
had expected.  Lord Ormersfield attributed his tranquillity to having
his mind settled; and so it was, though not quite as his lordship
imagined.
Meantime, there was a lull at Dynevor Terrace.  Oliver was gone to take
possession and furnish the mansion, and Mrs. Frost's great object was
to keep the subject from irritating her grandson, so as to save him
from binding himself by any rash vows.  Cheveleigh was treated in the
domestic circle with judicious silence, Oliver's letters were read by
his mother in private, and their contents communicated to Jane alone,
whose happiness was surpassing, and her contempt for Dynevor Terrace
quite provoking to poor Mrs. Martha.
'Really,' said Charlotte one day, 'I don't think a catastrophe is half
so pretty as it ought to be.  Mr. Oliver is but a poor little puny man,
and I never knew Mr. James so hard to please.'
Charlotte and Marianne had begun to merge their rivalry in honest
friendship, cemented by Marianne's increasing weakness, and difficulty
in getting through even the light work her mistress required.  Jane
petted her now still more than Charlotte, and was always promising her
the delightful air and the luxuries of Cheveleigh.
'See here, Charlotte,' said Marianne, one afternoon when they sat down
together to their sewing; Marianne's eyes were brighter, and her cheeks
pinker, than for many days--'See here; it is for your good I show it
you, that you mayn't build on no false expectations.  It was marked
private; but I think it but fair you should see.'
'Mine was marked private too,' said Charlotte, slowly, as she fixed her
eyes on the envelope Marianne held out to her, and putting her hand
into her pocket, pulled out a similar one, directed to Miss Arnold.
Marianne scarcely suppressed a shriek, gasped, and turned pale.  Each
lady then proceeded to unfold a pink sheet of note-paper, containing an
original copy of verses, each labelled, 'On a hair of ----.'  Then came
a scented shining note, requesting to be informed whether the right
construction had been put on some words that had dropped from the Miss
Conways, and if it were true that the reverend and respected Mr. F.
Dynevor had come into a large fortune.  In that case, Mr. Delaford,
mercenary considerations apart, would take the earliest opportunity of
resigning his present position, and entering the family which contained
his charmer.
The Merry Wives were parodied by the hysterical maids.  Charlotte might
afford to laugh, but Marianne's heart was more in the matter, and they
struck up such a chorus that Jane broke upon them, declaring that they
would frighten Mrs. James Frost out of her senses.  When Charlotte told
her what was the matter, her comment was, 'And a very good thing, too,
that you should find him out in time!  A pair of silly girls you!  I
always was thankful I never could write, to be deluded with nonsense by
the post; and I am more so than ever now! Come, leave off crying,
Marianne; he ain't worth it.'
'But how shall we answer him, Mrs. Beckett?' said Charlotte.
'Never demean yourself to answer him,' said Jane; 'let him never hear
nought about you--that's the best for the like of him.  I can tell him
he need not be in no hurry about giving warning to Lady Conway. At
Cheveleigh we'll have a solemn, steady butler, with no nonsense, nor
verses, nor guitars--forty years old--and a married man.'
Charlotte took the advice, and acted with dignified contempt and
silence, relieved to imagine that Tom had never been in danger from
such a rival.  Marianne did not divulge the tender and melancholy
letter of reproach that she posted privately; but she grew paler, and
coughed more, all that bright summer.
Mrs. Frost had refused to let any cause remove her from Northwold,
until after an event which it was hoped would render James less
disdainful of his inheritance.  But--'Was there ever anything more
contrary?' exclaimed Jane, as she prepared to set out the table for a
grand tea.  'There's Master James as pleased and proud of that there
little brown girl, as if she was as fine a boy as Master Henry himself.
I do believe, upon my word, it is all to spite poor dear Master Oliver.'
Poor Jane, she was almost growing tart in her partizanship of Oliver.
The little brown girl was no dove of peace.  Her father decidedly
triumphed in the mortification that her sex was to others of the
family; and though he averred that the birth of a son would not have
made him change his mind, he was well satisfied to be spared the attack
which would have ensued.  Oliver, like Jane, appeared to regard the
poor child as a wilful offence, and revenged himself by a letter
announcing that Clara would be his heiress, information which Mrs.
Frost kindly withheld from her granddaughter, in the hope of a
reconciliation.
Lord Ormersfield took James in hand, undertaking to make him hear
common sense; but the sense was unfortunately too common, and the
authoritative manner was irritating, above all when a stately warning
was given that no Church-preferment was to be expected from his
influence; whereupon James considered himself insulted, and they parted
very stiff and grand, the Earl afterwards pronouncing that nothing was
so wrongheaded as a conscientious man.  But they were too much
accustomed to be on respectfully quarrelsome terms to alter their
regard for one retort more or less; and after all, there were very few
men whom Lord Ormersfield liked or esteemed half so much as the
fearless and uncompromising James Frost--James Frost--as he curtly
signed himself, in spite of all Louis's wit on Rolands and Olivers--and
yet those soft satirical speeches did more than all direct attacks to
shake his confidence in his own magnanimity; more especially because
Fitzjocelyn always declared himself incompetent to judge, and never
failed to uphold that he was so far right, that his ministry must stand
above all worldly considerations.
The breach had become so wide, that Oliver would not have accepted the
terms he had formerly offered.  His object seemed to be to pique his
nephew and niece, by showing them what they had lost.  He wrote the
most magnificent descriptions of Cheveleigh, and insisted that his
mother and Clara should come and take possession on the eightieth
birthday of the former, the 14th of September; and Isabel was
recovering so rapidly, that there was nothing to oppose to his project,
although the new Catharine would be scarcely three weeks old by that
time.
Thereupon came down, addressed to Clara, a case of Peruvian jewels,
newly set in London--intended doubtless to excite great jealousy in her
sister-in-law.  Poor Oliver! could he but have known that Isabel only
glanced at them to tell Clara the names of the ornaments, and to
relieve her mind by assurances that the whole of a set need not be worn
at once!  Next arrived an exceedingly smart French milliner, who, by
the help of Jane and Marianne, got Clara into her toils, and pinned and
measured her for a whole mortal morning; and even grandmamma ordered a
black velvet gown and accompaniments.
Lastly, there descended on Clara's devoted head a cheque for a sum
which terrified her imagination, and orders to equip herself suitably
as Miss Dynevor of Cheveleigh, who was to enjoy the same allowance
half-yearly.  Her first idea was what delightful presents could be made
to every one; but as she was devising showers of gifts for her niece,
James cut her short,--'I am sorry to give you pain, Clara, but it must
be understood that neither directly nor indirectly can I nor mine
receive anything bought with my uncle's money.'
'That was the only thing to make me not hate it.'
'It is best you should hate it.'
'I do!  Why did he come home to bother us?  Oh, Jem, can't I still live
here, and only visit there?'
'No, Clara.  The care of granny is your first duty; and during her
life, so long as you are single, her home must be yours.'
The edict was given in stern self-abnegation; but James was very kind
to her, treating her as a victim, and spending his leisure in walking
about with her, that she might take leave of every favourite haunt. He
was indulgent enough even to make no objection to going with her to
Ormersfield, where she wandered about the park, visited old scenes with
Louis, and went over all his improvements.  His cottages had as yet the
sole fault of looking too new, and one of his tenants would not shut up
his pigs; but otherwise all was going on well, and Inglewood was in the
excitement of Louis's first harvest.  He walked about with ears of
wheat in his hand, talked knowingly of loads and acres, and had almost
taught his father to watch the barometer.  It added to Clara's regrets
that she should miss the harvest-supper, for which he and Mr.
Holdsworth had wonderful designs; but it was not to take place until
Fitzjocelyn's return from Cheveleigh.  Oliver had invited him and his
father to conduct Mrs. Frost thither, and add eclat to her reception;
and this, as Clara said, 'was the only comfort in the business.'
James had effectually destroyed all pleasure on her part, and had made
the change appear an unmitigated misfortune, even though she did not
know what she would have thought the worst.  Congratulations were
dreadful to her, and it was all that Isabel could do to persuade her to
repress her dislike so as not to distress her grandmother.
To Mrs. Frost it was pain to leave what she owned, with thankful tears,
to have been a happy, peaceful refuge for her widowhood and poverty;
she grieved over each parting, clung to the Faithfulls, reiterated fond
counsels to Isabel, and could hardly bear to detach herself from the
great-grandchild.  But still it was her own son, and her own home, and
Oliver and Cheveleigh were more to her than even James and Dynevor
Terrace; so that, though she was sorry, it was not with a melancholy
sorrow, and she could still hope against hope, that uncle and nephew
might be brought together at last, and that a son of James would yet
reign in the dear old place.
Besides, she had not time to be unhappy.  She was fully employed
nursing Isabel, doing honour to the little one, answering Oliver's
letters, superintending Clara's wardrobe; choosing parting gifts for
innumerable friends, high and low; and making arrangements for the
inexperienced household.
Jane's place was to be--not exactly supplied, but occupied by a cook.
Miss Dynevor was to have 'a personal attendant;' and Mrs. Beckett
begged that Marianne might be chosen, since she could not bear to see
the poor thing sent away, when in so much need of care.  The diamonds,
the French millinery, and Jane's motherly care, came in strong contrast
to the miserable lodging, or the consumptive hospital, which poor
Marianne had begun to anticipate; and weeping with gratitude, she
declared that she had never seen nor thought of such kindness since her
mother died.
Isabel seldom roused herself to understand anything about her servants;
but she liked Marianne, and was glad Clara should have her, since she
was not strong enough to undertake nursery cares.  She believed it had
not agreed with her to sit up late.  Compunction for having been the
cause had never dawned on Isabel's mind.
Charlotte was to remain at Dynevor Terrace; James and Isabel wished to
keep her, and Mrs. Beckett thought her sufficiently indoctrinated with
her ways to have some chance of going on well.  'Besides,' as Jane
said, 'I can't be accountable for taking her into that large family,
until I see what company there may be.  She's a well-behaved girl
enough, but she's too pretty and too simple-like for me to have her
among the common run of servants.  I'll see what I can do for her, when
I see what sort of a housekeeper it is.'
And Jane gave Charlotte infinite injunctions, varying from due care of
the 'chaney images' to reserve with mankind.  'Because you see,
Charlotte' she said, 'you'll be terribly forsaken.  Mrs. James, poor
dear!--she would not know if the furniture weren't rubbed once in ten
years; but you must make it a pride to yourself to be faithful.'
'I am faithful!' cried Charlotte.  'I never cared for that traitor,
Delaford, and his guitar; but I could not get rid of him.  And I'll
tell you what--I'll seal up his fine red book, and all his verses; and
you shall leave them in London as you go through, with my compliments.
I think that will be proper and scornful.'
'Hoity-toity!  That's what she's at!  The best thing you can do too,
Charlotte; and I'm glad that you've too much spirit to pine like poor
Marianne.  I'd take my affidavit that if the crowner could sit upon her
when she dies--and die she will--that there fine gentleman and his
guitar will be found at the bottom of her chest.  But don't go off
about that now--though 'tis the reason I won't part from the poor thing
till I can help--the better luck for you that you'd got more in your
head than vanities and furbelows.  What I meant was not being faithful
to him out in Peru--that's your own affair, but the being faithful to
your duty to your mistress, whether she's after you or not.  You know
what a good servant is, and you've got to show it ain't all
eye-service.'
Charlotte cried heartily.  No one else was allowed that privilege when
the 13th came, excepting Mrs. Frost herself.  James, afraid that a
scene would hurt his wife, severely forbade Clara to give way; and the
poor girl, mute and white, did as she was told, and ventured not a word
of farewell, though her embraces were convulsive, and when she went
down stairs she could not help kissing Charlotte.
James handed his grandmother to her seat in the carriage which was to
take her to the station.
'Good-bye, my dear,' she said; 'I know the day will come when all this
will be made up.  You know how I have loved you both.'
'I wish my uncle all good.'
'I see it now,' she said, holding his hand between both of hers.  'It
is my fault.  I fostered our family pride.  May God take away the sin
from us both!'
The words were hardly articulate through tears, and perhaps James did
not hear.  He hurried Clara down the garden and into the carriage, and
she had her last nod from Miss Faithfull at the open window. Miss Mercy
was at the station, whither school-hours had hindered James from
accompanying them, but where they found Lord Ormersfield and Louis.
The warm-hearted little woman was all tears and smiles.  'Oh! dear Mrs.
Frost, I am so sorry, and yet it is selfish.  I am so happy! but where
shall we find such another neighbour?'
'Come and see us.  You know you are to persuade your sister.'
'Ah!'  She shook her head.  'Salome is hard to move.  But you--you are
such a traveller--you will come to see Mr. James?'
'I'm eighty to-morrow: I little expect to make any more journeys except
one, Mercy.  I never look to see poor Northwold more; but it has been a
place of blessings to me, and you have been one of them. Don't think
I'm too glad to go away, but I cannot but be thankful that my dear boy
is bringing me home to lay me down where my father and his father lie.'
It was said with that peculiar cheerfulness with which happy old age
can contemplate the end of the pilgrimage, and she looked at Louis with
a sunny smile.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE RESTORATION.
When silent time, wi' lightly foot,
Had trod on thirty years,
I sought again my native land
Wi' mony hopes and fears.
As I drew near my ancient pile,
My heart beat a' the way;
The place I passed seemed yet to speak
Of some dear former day.
Some pensy chiels, a new-sprung race,
Wad next their welcome pay;
*   *   *   *   *
But sair on ilka well-kenned face
I missed the youthful bloom.
Miss Blamire
Oliver had sent orders to his mother to sleep in London, and proceed
the next morning by a train which would arrive at about two o'clock.
On that eventful morning, Clara was the prey of Mrs. Beckett, Marianne,
and the French milliner, and in such a flounced glace silk, such a lace
mantle, and such a flowery bonnet was she arrayed, that Lord
Ormersfield bowed to her as a stranger, and Louis talked of the
transformations of the Giraffe.  'Is it not humiliating,' she said, 'to
be so altered by finery?  You might dress Isabel for ever, and her
nobleness would surmount it all.'
'If you are not the rose, at least you have lived near the rose,' said
Louis.  'You don't fall quite short of the character of Miss Dynevor.'
'I wish I were going to school,' said Clara, as they passed along
familiar streets; 'then, at least, some one would pity me.'
After two hours spent on the railroad, the train entered a district
with the bleakness, but not the beauty, of the neighbourhood of
mountains; the fresh September breeze was laden with smoke, and
stations stood thick upon the line.  As the train dashed up to one of
these, a flag was seen waving, and the shout of 'Cheveleigh, Cheveleigh
road!' greeted them.
On the platform stood a tall footman, in the most crimson of coats,
powdered hair, and a stupendous crimson and white shoulder-knot, auch
as Clara had only seen going to St. James's.  She would never have
imagined that she had any concern with such splendour; but her
grandmother asked him if the carriage were there, as a mere matter of
course, and Jane devolved on him all luggage cares, as coolly as if she
had been ruling over him all his life.
As they issued from the station, a thin, uncertain, boyish cheer rang
out, and before them stood a handsome open carriage and four chestnut
horses, with crimson postillions, and huge crimson-and-white satin
rosettes.
'Wont they all turn to rats and pumpkins?' whispered Clara to Louis.
'Bless the poor boy!' cried Mrs. Frost, between laughing and crying,
'what has he been about?  Does he think I am the Sheriff's lady still?'
The party entered the carriage, and the crowd of little boys and girls,
flymen and porters, got up another 'hurrah!' as the four horses went
thundering off, with Mrs. Frost apologizing--'Poor Oliver's notions
were on such a grand scale!--He had been so long absent, that he did
not know how much these things had been disused.' But no one could look
at her bright tearful eyes, and quivering mouth, without seeing that
she exulted in her son's affection and his victory; and after all it
was natural to her, and a resumption of old habits.
They drove through two miles of brown flat heath, with far-away
mountain outlines, which she greeted as dear friends.  Here and there
the engine-house of a mine rose up among shabby buildings, and
by-and-by was seen a square church-tower, with lofty pinnacles, among
which floated forth a flag.  The old lady caught hold convulsively of
Clara's hand--'The old church!--My old church!--See, Clara, that is
where your dear grandfather lies!--My last home!'
With brimming eyes Mrs. Frost gazed on it as it came forth more
distinctly, and Clara looked with a sense of awe; but rending her away
from grave thoughts, shouts burst upon her ears, and above them the
pealing crash of all the bells, as they dashed under a splendid
triumphal arch, all evergreens and dahlias, forming the word 'Welcome!'
and were met by a party on horseback waving their hats, while a great
hurrah burst out from the numbers who lined the street. Mrs. Frost
bowed her thanks and waved her hand.  'But oh!' she said, almost
sobbing, 'where am I?  This is not Cheveleigh.'
Lord Ormersfield showed her a few old houses that they both recognised,
looking antiquated in the midst of a modern growth of narrow, conceited
new tenements.  The shouting crowd had, to Fitzjocelyn's eyes, more the
aspect of a rabble than of a genuine rejoicing peasantry.  What men
there were looked beer-attracted rather than reputable, and the main
body were whooping boys, women, nurse-girls, and babies.  The suspicion
crossed him that it was a new generation, without memories of forty
years since, wondering rather than welcoming, in spite of arches,
bells, and shouts.
After another half-mile, a gate swung wide beneath another arch, all
over C. D., the F. studiously omitted; and the carriage wheeled in amid
a shower of tight little nosegays from a squadron of school-children.
They drove up the long approach, through fir plantations, which drew
from Mrs. Frost a cry of friendly recognition--for her husband had
planted them; but they had not taken kindly to the soil, and fifty
years had produced but a starveling growth.  Beyond lay an expanse of
parched brown turf, here and there an enclosure of unprosperous trees,
and full in front stood the wide space of stuccoed wall, with a great
Gothic window full in the midst, and battlements in the castellated
style of the early years of the nineteenth century.
No one spoke.  After the first glance, Mrs. Frost shut her eyes to
restrain the hot tears that arose at the thought of the wintry morning,
when ice-drops hung hoary on the fir-trees, as she had driven away from
the portal, whence music was now pealing forth a greeting, and where
Oliver was standing on the very spot where, with clenched hand, he had
vowed that all should be restored.
Alas! how much was in his power to restore?
Gaily-dressed people surrounded the entrance, and, amid triumphant
strains from the band, the carriage stopped, and Oliver held out his
hand, saying, 'Welcome home, mother!'
She leant forward, kissed his brow, and suffered him to lead her up the
steps to the hall-door, Lord Ormersfield conducting Clara.  At the door
Mrs. Frost paused, to turn, curtsey, and sign her thanks to the throng
who had followed.  Her noble aspect and demeanour, so full of dignity
and feeling, obtained a fresh and more genuine acclamation; but
throughout there was a strange sense of unreality; she seemed like one
performing a part to gratify her son.  Clara asked her cousin if it
were not like acting a play; and it was plain to him that the
spectators beheld it with more curiosity than sympathy.
They were a new race.  Property had changed hands rapidly in a region
of trade and manufacture, and the old Dynevor name had been forgotten
past recall, amid the very population who were thriving upon the
identical speculations which had swamped Mr. Frost's fortune.  If the
crowd without looked like a mob, the assembly within had a parvenu
appearance; and as Oliver handed his mother across the hall, he
muttered something, as if he were disappointed both in the number and
consequence of his guests.
He led her into a magnificent apartment, all gilding, blue brocade, and
mirrors, as far as might be after the model of the days of the
Shrievalty; but the bare splendour could ill recall the grace and
elegance that had then reigned there without effort.  Peru had not
taught Oliver taste either of the eye or of the mind, and his
indefatigable introductions--'My mother, Mrs. Dynevor, my niece, Miss
Dynevor, Lord Ormersfield, Lord Fitzjocelyn,' came so repeatedly as
quite to jingle in their ears.
Sir Andrew Britton, a burly cotton lord, with a wife in all the colours
of the rainbow, seemed to be the grand guest.  His lady seated herself
beside Mrs. Frost, and began to tell her, with a tone of patronage, how
good a neighbourhood it was, and how much pleasure she should have in
introducing Miss Dynevor.
In vain did Mrs. Frost look for a face she knew, and inquire from her
new acquaintance after familiar old names of places and people.  The
places were either become factories, or some charming new family lived
there; and for the people, it seemed as if she might as well ask for
antediluvians; Lady Britton had seldom heard their names, or if any
trace survived, they had never been on her visiting list.
At last Oliver came up to her, saying, 'Here, ma'am, Mr. Henderson
claims an early acquaintance with you.'
'Mr. Henderson!' and she eagerly started up, but looked baffled.
'Little George Henderson,' said the grey-headed gentleman--for once a
real gentleman--'I assure you I have not forgotten the happy days I
have spent here.'
'Little George!' as she took him by both hands--'who would have thought
it!  You were little George with the apple cheeks.  And are no more of
you here?'
He shook his head sadly.  'They would have been even more glad than I
am to welcome you home; they were older, and knew you better.'
'Ah!  I must learn to ask no questions.  And yet, that dear sister
Fanny of yours--'
'Gone many years since, ma'am.  She died in India.  I hope my daughter
Fanny may put you a little mind of her.'
'Is she not here?'
'Why, no.  I wished to bring her, but she is but fifteen, and mamma
will not trust her out without herself.  We are quiet people, and the
world is growing too gay for us.'
'Clara and I must come to find you out.  Can you believe this tall
creature is poor dear Henry's daughter?' as Clara hastened to greet her
father's playfellow, with an alacrity which piqued Lady Britton into a
supercilious aside to Lord Fitzjocelyn that the Hendersons were in poor
circumstances, and no one visited them.
'And is no one here whom I know?  Not one of the old set, George?'
asked the old lady, mournfully.
'I fear there is hardly any one,' said Mr. Henderson.  'All seem even
to me new people.  Stay, do you recollect old Mrs. Golding?'
After a little confusion, Mr. Henderson's old Mrs. Golding proved to be
Mrs. Frost's young Mrs. Golding; and, on the eager inquiry whether she
were present, ensued the melancholy answer that she was deaf and
infirm, only just able to smile with pleasure at the tidings of her old
friend's restoration; and the daughter, whom she could only just
believe to be grown up, was a worn, elderly woman.  Not even the one
heartfelt greeting was without sadness; and Clara likewise met with one
solitary satisfaction, and that a very mixed one.  Mr. Danvers, the
young curate, whom Oliver had not thought worth presenting, was hailed
by Fitzjocelyn as if their slight Oxford acquaintance had been an
intimacy, and was by him introduced to Clara as belonging to James's
college.  She frankly held out her hand, but was discomfited by his
inquiry for her brother, whom he had hoped to meet.  Louis said
something about not expecting the schoolmaster abroad in the half-year,
and Clara was not at all grateful to him for relieving her from the
embarrassment, but regarded the reply as a shabby prevarication, and
was much inclined to speak out; but Louis was drawing the curate into
conversation about the population, and hearing but a desponding
history.  It was interrupted when Oliver, after waiting in vain for
more distinguished company, began to marshal his guests to the grand
hall, paved with black and white marble, and with a vast extent of wall
and window, decked with evergreens, flags, and mottoes.  Here a cold
collation was prepared, with a band in a music-gallery above, and all
the et ceteras dear to county papers.  Oliver himself handed in Lady
Britton, his mother fell to the lot of the Earl, and Fitzjocelyn
received orders to conduct a handsome, young, giggling Mrs. Smithers,
who, never having been in contact with a live Lord, wanted to make the
most of him, and, before she had arrived at her place, was declaring
that it was a most interesting occasion, just like a scene at the Opera.
Louis glanced back to see what became of Clara, and, finding her
following with Sir Andrew Britton, contrived to sit immediately
opposite to her, at the long, narrow table, with nothing between them
but a couple of cold chickens and a tongue garnished with transfixed
crayfish.  His eyes were, perhaps, a greater support to her than even
conversation, for she gathered a little philosophy and charity from
their cheering smile and arch twinkling, and she managed to listen
civilly to her neighbour, while she saw that her cousin was being very
polite to Mrs. Smithers.  She was a great way from all other friends,
for the table had been spread for a more numerous assembly, and the
company sat in little clusters, with dreary gaps between, where moulds
of jelly quaked in vain, and lobster-salads wasted their sweetness on
the desert air.  Her uncle could just be seen in the far perspective at
the head of the table, and, between him and the Earl, Louis descried
his Aunt Catharine, looking bright, with a little embellishing flush on
her withered cheek.
Sir Andrew was not a lady's man; and, after he had heard how far Miss
Dynevor had come to-day, that she had never ridden, and had not seen
the Menai tubular bridge, he discontinued the difficult task; and she,
finding that he had not even seen the cathedral, which she had passed
only fifteen miles off, gave him up, and occupied herself with watching
the infinite variety of affectations which Mrs. Smithers was playing
off, and the grave diversion with which Louis received them. The lady
was evidently trying to discover what had been the intermediate history
of Mrs. and Miss Dynevor; and Louis was taking pleasure in baffling
her, with cool, quiet answers, especially when she came to the question
whether Miss Dynevor had not a brother, and why he was not present.  It
appeared that Oliver had made almost as if his mother had been buried
and dug up again; involving the thirty-four years of her exile in such
utter mystery, that people had begun to make all sorts of wild stories
to account for her proceedings; and Lord Fitzjocelyn's explanation that
she had lived in her own house in Northwold, and taught him the Latin
grammar, seemed quite a disappointment from the simplicity and want of
romance.
The weary banquet had arrived at ices, and Clara hoped the end was
near, when the worse trial of speeches began.  Mr. Henderson was
declaring how strongly he felt the honour which had been devolved on
him, of expressing the universal joy in having so excellent and
much-beloved a neighbour restored by the noble exertions of her son.
He said all that the rest of the world ought to have felt, and so
heartily and sincerely as to make every one imagine the whole the
general sentiment, and the welcoming hurrah was cordial and joyous.
Mrs. Frost was deeply touched and gratified, and Lord Ormersfield
congratulated himself on having instigated Oliver to give this toast to
Mr. Henderson.  If Clara could have driven James from her mind, she
would have been delighted, but there could be no triumph for her where
he was excluded.
The Earl returned thanks on behalf of his aunt, and said a great deal
that could have come from the mouth of no one 'unaccustomed to public
speaking,' ending by proposing the health of 'Mr. Oliver Frost
Dynevor.'  In the midst of 'the fine old English gentleman,' while
Louis was suppressing a smile at the incongruity, a note was brought to
him, which he tossed to Clara, purporting that he was to return thanks
for her.  She bent over the table to say, 'You will say nothing I
cannot bear to hear,' folded her hands, and shut her eyes, as if she
had been going to stand fire.
Oliver's clear, harsh tones, incapable of slowness or solemnity, began
to return thanks for himself, and pronounce this to be the happy day to
which he had been looking throughout his life--the day of restoring the
family inheritance to his mother, and the child of his elder brother;
he faltered--he never could calmly speak of Henry. Failing the presence
of one so dear, he rejoiced, however, to be able to introduce to them
his only daughter, and he begged that his friends would drink the
health of the heiress of Cheveleigh, Miss Dynevor.
Never did toast apparently conduce so little to the health of the
subject.  Unprepared as Clara was for such a declaration, it was to her
as if she had been publicly denounced as the supplanter of her brother.
She became deadly white, and sat bolt upright, stiff and motionless,
barely stifling a scream, and her eyes fixed between command and
entreaty on her cousin without seeing, far less acknowledging, the bows
levelled at her.  Louis, alarmed by her looks, saw that no time was to
be lost; and rising hastily before any one was ready, perilled his fame
for eloquence by rapidly assuring the gentlemen and ladies that Miss
Dynevor was truly sensible of the kindness of their welcome, and their
manner of receiving the toast. Then pushing back his chair, with 'never
mind,' to Mrs. Smithers and her scent-bottle, he was at the back of
Clara's chair almost before her confused eyes had missed him in her
gasps for breath, and impulse to do something desperate; and so she
might, if his voice had not been in her ear, his hand grasping hers,
both to console and raise her.  'Clara, come, take care.'  She obeyed,
but trembling so much that he was obliged to support her.  Others would
have risen in alarm, but he silenced them by signs, and entreaties that
no one would frighten her grandmother.  There was a large glass door
standing open under the Gothic window, and through it he led her out
upon a wide green lawn.  She drew her breath in sobs, but could not
speak.  Louis asked her to untie her bonnet, and touched the string,
which was merely a streamer.  This brought a kind of laugh, but she
unfastened the bonnet herself, and the first use she made of her breath
was fiercely to exclaim--'How could you!  Why did you not tell them I
never will--'
'Sit down,' said Louis, gently.  'Let me fetch some water.'
'No--no--let me get away from this place!' and she almost dragged him
along, as fresh cheers and peals of music broke out, till they had
entered a lonely walk in a sort of wilderness of shrubs.  Still she
hurried on, till they came out on a quiet little garden, where the
tinkling of a little fountain was the only sound; the water looked
clear and fresh with the gold-fish darting in it, and the sun shone
calmly on the bright flowers and wavy ferns adorning the rockwork.
'What are you doing, Clara?  You must rest here,' said he, drawing her
down on a rustic bench, intended to represent a crocodile.
'I can't rest here!  I must go home!  I'm going home to Jem!' she
exclaimed, obeying, however, because, though she could run, she could
not stand.
'Dear Clara,' he said, affectionately, 'it was much worse than I
expected.  I never believed he could have committed himself to such an
open declaration, especially without warning.'
'I'll not stay!' cried Clara, with all the vehemence of her Dynevor
nature.  'I'll go straight home to Northwold to-morrow
morning--to-night if I could.  Yes, I will!  I never came here for
this!'
'And what is to become of my poor Aunt Kitty?'
'She has her Oliver!  She would not have me put Jem out of his
birthright.'
'James will not be put into it.'
She wrenched away her hand, and looked at him with all her brother's
fierceness.  'And you!' she cried, 'why could not you speak up like a
man, and tell them that I thank none of them, and will have nothing to
say to any of them; and that if this is to belong to any one, it must
be to my noble, my glorious, generous brother; and, if he hasn't it, it
may go to the Queen, for what I care!  I'll never have one stone of it.
Why could you not say so, instead of all that humbug'!'
'I thought the family had afforded quite spectacles enough for one
day,' said Louis; 'and besides, I had some pity upon your grandmother,
and on your uncle too.'
'Jem told me grandmamma claimed my first duty; but he never knew of
this wicked plan.'
'Yes, he did.'
'Knew that I was to supplant him!'
'Yes; we all knew it was a threat of your uncle; but we spared you the
knowledge, thinking that all might yet be accommodated, and never
expecting it would come on you in this sudden way.'
'Then I think I have been unfairly used,' cried Clara; 'I have been
brought here on false pretences.  As if I would have come near the
place if I had known it!'
'A very false pretence that your grandmother must not be left alone at
eighty, by the child whom she brought up.'
'Oh, Louis! you want to tear me to pieces!'
'I have pity on my aunt; I have far more pity on your uncle.'  Clara
stared at him.  'Here is a man who started with a grand heroic purpose
to redeem the estate, not for himself, but for her and his brother; he
exiles himself, he perseveres, till this one pursuit, for which he
denies himself home, kindred, wife or child, absorbs and withers him
up.  He returns to find his brother dead; and the children, for whom he
sacrificed all, set against him, and rejecting his favours.'
This was quite a new point of view to Clara.  'It is his own fault,'
she said.
'That a misfortune is by our own fault is no comfort,' said Louis. 'His
apparent neglect, after all, arose from his absorption in the one
object.'
'Yes; but how shameful to wish James to forget his Ordination.'
'A strong way of putting it.  He asked too much: but he would have
been, and may yet be, contented with concessions involving nothing
wrong.  His way of life can hardly have taught him to appreciate
James's scruples, as we do; and even if right and wrong were more
neatly partitioned between them than I think they are, it would still
be hard on him to find this destined heir spurning his benefits.'
'What are you coming to, Louis!  You think James right?
'I would give the world to think so, Clara.  One motive is too high for
praise, the other--No, I will say nothing of it.  But I could wish I
had not precipitated matters last year.'
'What, would you have robbed us of our few happy months?'
'It was your uncle whom I robbed; he would otherwise have come home
like a good genius; but he found you all happy without him, and with no
gratitude to spare for him.  And there he sits at the head of that long
melancholy table, trying to bring back days that have gone too far ever
to be recalled, and only raising their spectres in this mocking finery;
scarcely one man present, whose welcome comes from his heart; his
mother past the days of heeding the display, except for his sake; his
nephew rejecting him; you indignant and miserable. Oh, Clara!  I never
saw more plainly money given for that which is not bread, and labour
for that which satisfieth not.  Empty and hollow as the pageant was, I
could better bear to take my part in it, so far as truth would let me,
than tell that poor man that the last of his brother's children rejects
him and his benefits.'
'At this rate, you will make a hero of Uncle Oliver.'
'It is because he is one of this world's heroes that he is distasteful
to you.'
'I don't understand.'
'Exclusive devotion to one object, grand though it was, has made him
the man he appears to us.  Think what the spirit must have been that
conceived and carried out such a design!  Depend upon it there is a
greatness in him, which may show, when, as dear granny says, she has
cured him of all he learnt away from home.  I think that must be the
work for which you are all brought together here.'
'But I can't thrust out Jem.  I won't stay here on those terms.  I
shall protest--'
'It is not graceful to make an uproar about your own magnanimity, nor
to talk of what is to happen after a man's death.  You don't come here
to be heiress, but to take care of your grandmother.  There is no need
to disturb the future, unless, to be sure, you were obliged to explain
your expectations.'
'Ah! to be sure, any way I could restore it all to James.'
'Or, better still, you may yet be able to draw the uncle and nephew
together, and bring back peace and union.'
'Then I must stay and bear all this, you think?'
'As a mere matter of obedience, certainly.'
Clara's countenance fell.
'That may deprive it of the brilliance of a voluntary sacrifice; but,
after all, it is what makes your course safe and plain.'
'And very dismal, just because no one will believe so.'
'So the safer for humility,' said Louis.  'Perhaps the dear old Terrace
did not offer training and trial enough.  I try to believe something of
the kind in my own case.  If choice had been mine, I should hardly have
been exactly what I am; and you know how my chief happiness has been
put far from me; but I can imagine that to be at the summit of my
wishes might foster my sluggishness, and that I might rest too much on
better judgment than my own, if it were beside me.  Probation maybe
safer than joy; and you may do more good to yourself and others than
even under Isabel's wing.  Only think of the means in your hands, and
all the wretched population round!  There will be some hope of help for
the curate now--besides, I shall know where to come for subscriptions
next time I run crazy about any wonderful charity.'
Clara smiled.  'I suppose I must bear it,' she said.
'For shame, Clara!  With Aunt Kitty, who would make a palace of a
dungeon, in the glorious glow of such a sunset, turning each cloud to
red and purple radiance by the very force of love and faith, who could
regret the being beside her?  My own dear and precious aunt, to see her
so happy, with bliss and peace so undisturbed, so far above these toys,
and these distresses, gives me a sort of fear--'
'Oh, don't, Louis--'
They were interrupted by approaching voices.  Clara hastily started up,
as her uncle and Lady Britton appeared in the green alley.
'Oh, must I go back to them all!  My head does ache!'
Louis gave her his arm, pursued the path in the opposite direction, and
emerged at the lower end of the bowling-green, with the battlemented
front of the house rising before them.  Presently, he met his father
searching for him.  'Poor Clara has been overcome,' he said, in
explanation.  'The speechifying has been too much for her.'
It was the first time that Clara had appeared to the Earl in any light
but that of an idle school-girl, and he said, kindly, 'It must have
been very trying.  There should have been more preparation. Your uncle
would have shown better taste in sparing your grandmamma so obtrusive a
reception, and I was much pained both for her and for you during some
of the speeches.'
Sympathy from Lord Ormersfield nearly overthrew Clara again, and she
involuntarily squeezed Louis's arm.  He asked for his aunt, and was
told, 'She is in the house, entertaining these people.  They do not
know when to go away.  How could Oliver inflict such a party on her and
such a style of people!'
'I must go and help her,' said Louis.
Clara was in no condition to appear, but Louis caused Mrs. Beckett to
be summoned, and committed her to her care.  Her transport was one of
the few pleasant things of that day.  'Oh, Miss Clara!  Oh, my Lord!
Was there ever the like?  Isn't Master Oliver the most blessed boy?
Missus in her own home again!  Eight men, and a French man-cook!  If
ever I thought to see the day!  Her old room just as it was, only
grander!  Oh, if poor Mr. James was but here!'
'Ay, Jane, and here's Clara thinking herself ill about Mr. James. Take
her up and give her some tea, and make her fit to behave prettily
by-and-by, that granny may not be vexed.'
Having seen her safe under Jane's fondling care and infectious
exultation, he betook himself to the drawing-room, relieved his aunt's
anxiety by a whisper, and won golden opinions from the whole company,
before they were fairly got rid of; and Oliver begged to conduct his
mother to her apartment.  'Yes, my dear, I must go to poor little
Clara.'
'I've no fears for Clara,' said Oliver, as he led her upstairs.
'Knowing young fellow to wait for my announcement!  I can give her near
double what Ponsonby could. I'd not object--old Dynevor blood--'
'My poor Oliver, you have so learnt to think of money, that you can't
believe others live for anything else.  You'll learn your mistake.'
'You think the young chap meant nothing?  I shall look sharp after him,
then.  I look on Clara as my own.  I'll have no trifling.'
'You may save yourself the trouble,' said his mother.  'They understand
each other--they have always been like brother and sister, and I cannot
have the children teased, or things put into their heads.'
Oliver laughed his scornful chuckle, and said he did not understand
that sort of brother and sister, but happily he became absorbed in
showing his mother the fittings of her splendid bedroom.
Clara had the comfort of clinging round her grandmother's neck, and
being told that it was all nonsense.  Jem should have his rights, and
Uncle Oliver would learn to love and honour him at last; and she was a
good child, and ought to have been prepared, if granny could have
guessed he would do it so publicly and suddenly, but she must forgive
him, for he was beside himself at having got them home again, and he
could not make enough of her because she was poor Henry's child.  So
she saw granny must not be grieved, and she let herself be dressed for
a constrained dinner in the vast dining-room, where the servants
outnumbered the diners, and the silver covers bore the Dynevor dragon
as a handle, looking as spiteful as some of the race could do.
Oliver was obliged to conclude that no offer had passed between the two
young people; but on the way home next morning the Earl observed,
'Clara Frost has a fine figure, and is much improved by dress.  She
shows excellent feeling, and does credit to her education.'
'The Pendragon blood never had a finer development,' said Louis.
'Even supposing justice done to poor James, she will have a handsome
portion.  Oliver will have far more to dispose of than the five
thousand pounds guaranteed to her.'
'Poor child!' said Louis.
'Yes, I pity her for being exposed to his parading.  He forgot the
gentleman in his merchant's office.  If you should ever have any
thoughts of rescuing her from him, my approval would not be wanting,
and it would be the easiest way of restoring her brother.'
'My dear father, if Clara and I were always sister and brother when she
was poor, we certainly shall be no more now.'
Lord Ormersfield mentally execrated Mr. Ponsonby, and felt that he had
spoken too soon.
Jane's felicity was complete when, a few days after, she received,
addressed in Lord Fitzjocelyn's handwriting, an Illustrated News, with
a whole page containing 'the reception of Mrs. Dynevor of Cheveleigh,'
with grand portraits of all the flounces and veils, many gratuitous
moustaches, something passing for Oliver standing up with a wine-glass
in his hand, a puppy that would have perfectly justified Mr. Ponsonby's
aversion representing Lord Fitzjocelyn, and no gaps at the
banquet-table.
That picture Mrs. Beckett caused to be framed and glazed, kept it as
her treasure for life, and put it into her will as a legacy to
Charlotte Arnold.
CHAPTER IX.
THE GIANT OF THE WESTERN STAR.
Come, let us range the subterranean vast,
Dark catacombs of ages, twilight dells,
And footmarks of the centuries long past,
Which look on us from their sepulchral cells.
Then glad emerge we to the cheering day,
Some sun-ranged height, or Alpine snowy crown,
Or Chimborazo towering far away
O'er the great Andes chain, and, looking down,
On flaming Cordilleras, mountain thrown
O'er mountain, vast new realms.
The Creation--REV. I. WILLIAMS.
The same impression of the Illustrated London News which delighted Jane
Beckett's simple heart in England, caused no small sensation at Lima.
Dona Rosita cast one glance at El Visconde there portrayed, and then
became absorbed in Clara's bonnet; Mr. Robson pronounced Lord
Ormersfield as good a likeness as Mr. Dynevor, Mr. Ponsonby cast a
scornful look and smile at the unlucky figure representing Fitzjocelyn;
and not a critical voice was heard, excepting Tom Madison's, who
indignantly declared that they had made the young Lord look as if he
had stood behind a counter all his life.
The juxtaposition of Lord Fitzjocelyn and Mr. Dynevor's niece, was not
by any means forgotten.  It looked very like a graceful conclusion to
Oliver's exertions that he should crown their union, and the county
paper, which had likewise been forwarded, very nearly hinted as much.
Mr. Ponsonby took care that the paragraph should be laid in his
daughter's way, and he offered her the sight of Oliver Dynevor's own
letter.
Mary suspected that he regarded it as something conclusive, and took
care to read it when there were no eyes to mark her emotions.
'Ormersfield and his son were there,' wrote Oliver.  'The young man is
not so soft as he looks.  They tell me he is going to work sensibly at
the estate, and he has a sharp eye for the main chance. I hear he
played fast and loose till he found your daughter had better prospects
than Miss Conway, whom my fool of a nephew chose to marry, and now he
is making up to my niece.  My mother dotes on him, and I shall make no
objection--no extravagance that I can see, and he will take care of the
property.  You will take no offence, since you refuse the tender
altogether.'
Of this Mary believed two sentences--namely, that Aunt Catharine doted
on Fitzjocelyn, and that he was not so soft as he looked, which she
took as an admission that he was not comporting himself foolishly.  She
was quite aware that the friendship between him and Clara might deceive
an uninitiated spectator; and, though she commanded herself to think
that an attachment between them would be equally natural and desirable,
she could not but look with great satisfaction at the easy unsuspicious
tone of Mrs. Frost's letter, which, after mentioning with much
affection and gratitude all Oliver's attempts to make her happy, in
spite of the many sad changes around, ended by saying that poor Clara
felt the separation from her brother so much, that without dear Louis
she did not know how she would have gone through the festivities.  'You
can guess how he is everything to us all,' said Aunt Kitty, 'and I
brightened up his looks with giving him your last letter to read.  I
dare say, Miss Mary, you would like to scold me.'
Aunt Kitty!  Aunt Kitty! you dearly loved a little kindly mischief! Let
that be as it might, Mr. Ponsonby thought that Mr. Dynevor's letter had
certainly not had much effect, for Mary was more lively and cheerful
than he had seen her since her first arrival.  Mary's cheerfulness was
becoming the more necessary to him, since he was beginning a little to
weary of the childish charms of his young Limenian wife.  Rosita had
neither education nor conversation; and when all her pretty ways had
been tried on him in succession, they began to grow tedious.  Moreover,
the playful submission which she had brought from her convent was
beginning to turn into wilfulness. Her extravagances in dress were
appalling.  She refused to wear the same dresses twice, and cried,
stamped her graceful foot, and pouted when he remonstrated.  She
managed to spend every evening in amusement, either at the Opera, or at
evening parties, where her splendid eyes, and scraps of broken English,
made great havoc among young lieutenants and midshipmen visiting Lima.
Mr. Ponsonby was growing tired of these constant gaieties, and
generally remained at home, sending Mary in his stead, as a sort of
guard over her; and Mary, always the same in her white muslin, followed
Rosita through all the salas of Lima--listened to the confidences of
Limenian beauties--talked of England to little naval cadets, more
homesick than they would have chosen to avow--and felt sure of some
pleasure and interest for the evening, when Mr. Ward came to stand by
her chair.
One afternoon, as Mary sat in her window reading, a gay voice
exclaimed, 'Beso las manos a Usted;' and looking up, she saw one of the
prettiest figures imaginable.  A full dark purple satin skirt just
revealed the point of a dainty white satin shoe.  It was plaited low on
the hips, and girded loosely with a brightly striped scarf. The head
and upper part of the person were shrouded in a close hood of elastic
black silk webbing, fastened behind at the waist, and held over the
face by the hand, which just allowed one be-ringed finger and one
glancing dark eye to appear, while the other hand held a fan and a
laced pocket-handkerchief.  So perfectly did the costume suit the air
and shape of the lady, that, as she stood among Mary's orange trees, it
was like an illusion, of the fancy, but consternation took away all the
charm from Mary's eyes.  'Tapada, she cried; 'you surely are not going
out, tapada?'
'Ah, you have found me out,' cried Rosita.  'Yes, indeed I am! and I
have the like saya y manto ready for you.  Come, we will be on the
Alameda; Xavier waits to attend us.  Your Senor Ouard will be at his
evening walk.'
But Mary drew back.  This pretty disguise was a freak, such as only the
most gay ladies permitted themselves; and she had little doubt that her
father would be extremely displeased at his wife and daughter so
appearing, although danger there was none; since, though any one might
accost a female thus veiled, not the slightest impertinence was ever
allowed.  Mary implored Bosita to wait till Mr. Ponsonby's views should
be known; but she was only laughed at for her English precision, and
the pretty creature danced away to her stolen pleasure.
She came in, all glory and delight at the perplexity in which she had
involved the English officers, the guesses and courtesies of her own
countrymen, and her mystification of Mr. Robson, who had evidently
recognised her, though pretending to treat her as a charming stranger.
The triumph was of short duration.  For the first time, she had aroused
one of Mr. Ponsonby's gusts of passion; she quailed under it, wept
bitterly, and made innumerable promises, and then she put on her black
mantilla, and, with Xavier behind her, went to her convent chapel, and
returned, half crying over the amount of repetitions of her rosary by
which her penance was to be performed, and thereby all sense of the
fault put away.  Responsibility and reflection never seemed to be
impressed on that childish mind.
Mary had come in for some of the anger, for not having prevented
Rosita's expedition; but they were both speedily forgiven, and Mary
never was informed again of her using the saya y manto.
Their minds were diverted by the eager desire of one of the young
officers to visit the silver mines.  It had been an old promise to Mary
from her father to take her to see them; but in her former residence in
Peru, it had never been fulfilled.  He now wished to inspect matters
himself, in order to answer the numerous questions sent by Oliver; and
Rosita, eagerly catching at any proposal which promised a variety, a
party was made up for ascending to the San Benito mines, some days'
journey from Lima.  Mary and Rosita were the only ladies; but there
were several gentlemen, three naval officers, and Mr. Ward, who was
delighted to have an opportunity of visiting the wonders which had
been, for many years, within his reach without his rousing himself from
his business to see them.  Tents, bedding, and provisions were to be
carried with them, and Mary had full occupation in stimulating Dolores
to bring together the requisite preparations; while Mr. Ward and Robson
collected guides, muleteers, and litters.
It was a merry party, seated on the gaily-trapped mules, with an idle
young midshipman to make mischief, and all in spirits to enjoy his
nonsense, in the exhilaration of the mountain air blowing freshly from
the snowy summits which seemed to rise like walls before them. The
steaming, misty, relaxing atmosphere of Lima was left behind, and with
it many a care and vexation.  Mr. Ponsonby brought his mule to the side
of his wife's litter, and exchanged many a joke in Anglo-Spanish with
her and the lieutenant; and Mr. Ward, his brow unfurrowed from
counting-house cares, walked beside Mary's mule, gathered each new
flower for her, and listened to her narrative of some of the causes for
which she was glad, with her own eyes, to see Tom Madison in his scene
of action.
The first day of adventure they slept at a hacienda, surrounded with
fields where numerous llamas were pasturing.  The next began the real
mountain work; the rock looked like a wall before them, and the white
summits were sharply defined against the blue sky.  The sharper air
made Rosita shiver; but the English travellers congratulated themselves
on something like a breeze, consoling them for the glow with which the
sunbeams beat upon the rocks.  The palms and huge ferns had given place
to pines, and these were growing more scanty. Once or twice they met a
brown Indian, robed in a coloured blanket, with a huge straw hat, from
beneath which he gazed with curious, though gentle eyes, upon the
cavalcade.  By-and-by, looking like a string of ants descending a
perpendicular wall, Mary beheld a row of black specks slowly moving.
She was told that these were the mules bringing down the metal in
panniers--the only means of communication, until, as the lieutenant
promised, a perpendicular railroad should be invented.  The electricity
of the atmosphere made jokes easily pass current.  The mountain was
'only' one of the spurs of the Andes, a mere infant among the giants;
but, had it been set down in Europe, Mont Blanc must have hid his
diminished head; and the view was better than on some of the more
enormous neighbours, which were both further inland, and of such
height, that to gaze from them was 'like looking from an air-balloon
into vacancy.'  Whereas here Mary had but to turn her head, as her mule
steadily crept round the causeway--a legacy of the Incas--to behold the
expanse of the Pacific, a sheet of glittering light in the sunshine,
the horizon line raised so high, that the first moment it gave her a
sense of there being something wrong with her eye, before the feeling
of infinity rushed upon her.
They were turning the flank of the mountain, and losing the sunshine.
The evening air was almost chill, and the clearness such that they
already saw the ragged height whither they were bound rising in craggy
shattered grandeur, every flat space or gentler declivity covered with
sheds and huts for the work-people, and cavernous mouths opening on the
cliff-side.  Dark figures could be distinctly seen moving about; and as
to the descending mules, they seemed to be close on the other side of a
narrow ravine.  Rosita, who, now it came to the point, was not without
fears of sleeping on the bare mountain-side, wanted to push on; she was
sure they could arrive before night, but she was told that she knew
nothing of mountain atmosphere; and she was not discontented with the
bright fire and comfortable arrangements on which they suddenly came,
after turning round a great shoulder of rock.  Mr. Robson and the
sumpter-mules had quietly preceded them, and the gipsying on the Andes
was likely to be not much less luxurious than an English pic-nic.  The
negro cook had done his best; Mary made her father's coffee, and Rosita
was waited on to her satisfaction.  And when darkness came on, too
early for English associations with warm days, the lights of the
village at the mine glittered merrily, and, apparently, close at hand;
and the stars above shone as Mary had never seen them, so marvellously
large and bright, and the Magellan clouds so white and mysterious.  Mr.
Ward came and told her some of the observations made on them by
distinguished travellers; and after an earnest conversation, she sought
her matted bed, with a pleasant feeling on her mind, as if she had been
unusually near Louis's world.
Clear, sharp, and cold was the air next day; the snow-fields glistened
gloriously in the rising sun, and a rose-coloured mist seemed to rise
from them.  Rosita was shown the unusual spectacle of hoar frost, and
shiveringly profited by Mary's ample provision of wraps.  The
hill-sides were beyond conception desolate and bare. Birds were an
almost unknown race in Peru; and here even green things had departed,
scarcely a tuft of blossom looking out on the face of the red and
purple rock; and the exceeding stillness so awful, that even the
boy-sailor scarce dared to speak above his breath.  Rosita began to
repent of having come near so horrible a place; and when she put her
head out of her litter, and beheld herself winding along a ledge
projecting from the face of a sheer precipice, she would have begged to
go back instantly; but her husband spoke in a voice of authority which
subdued her; she drew in her head into her basket-work contrivance, and
had recourse to vows to Sta Rosa of Lima of a chaplet of diamond roses,
if she ever came safely down again.
Mary had made up her mind that they should not have been taken thither
if there were any real danger; and so, though she could have preferred
her mule taking the inner side of the ledge, and was not too happy when
it climbed like a cat, she smiled, and answered all inquiries that she
did not think she ought to be frightened.  The region was in general
more stern than beautiful, the clefts between the hills looking so
deep, that it seemed as if an overthrown mountain could hardly fill
them; but now and then came sudden peeps of that wonderful ocean; or
almost under her feet, as if she could throw a stone into it, there
would lie an intensely green valley, shut in with feathering pines, and
the hacienda and grazing llamas dwindled, so that they could have been
taken for a Swiss farm and flocks of sheep.
Not till the middle of the day did they meet the line of mules, and not
until the sunset did they find themselves close before the wonderful
perforated San Benito summit.  It was, unlike many other metalliferous
hills, an isolated, sharply-defined mass of rock, breaking into sudden
pinnacles and points, traversed with veins of silver.  These veins had
been worked with galleries, which, even before the Spanish conquest,
had honeycombed the solid rock, and had been thought to have exhausted
its riches; but it had been part of Oliver Dynevor's bold speculations
to bring modern science to profit by the leavings of the Peruvians and
their destroyers.  It was a marvellous work, but it might still be a
question whether the profit would bear out the expense.
However, that was not the present consideration.  No one could feel
anything but admiring astonishment at the fantastic craggy height of
peaks and spires, rising against the darkening sky, like the very
stronghold of the Giant of the Western Star; and, with the black
openings of the galleries, here and there showing the lights of the
workmen within.  Mary remembered the tales, in which Louis used vainly
to try to interest her, of metal-working Dwarfs within the mountains;
and would have been glad to tell him that, after all, reality was quite
as strange as his legends.
The miners, Indians and negroes, might truly have been Trolls, as, with
their brown and black countenances, and wild bright attire, they came
thronging out of their rude houses, built of piled stones on every
tolerably level spot.  Three or four stout, hearty Cornish miners, with
picks on their shoulders, made the contrast stranger; and among them
stood a young man, whose ruddy open face carried Mary home to
Ormersfield in one moment; and she could not but blush almost as if it
had been Louis, when she bent her head in acknowledgment of his bow.
He started towards her as if to help her off her mule; but Mr. Ponsonby
was detaining him by questions, and Mr. Ward, as usual, was at her
rein.  In a wonderfully brief time, as it seemed to her, all the
animals were led off to their quarters; and Robson, coming up,
explained that Madison's hut, the only habitable place, had been
prepared for the ladies--the gentlemen must be content to sleep in
their tent.
'The hut was at least clean,' said Robson, as he ushered them in; and
Mary felt as if it were a great deal more.  It was rudely built, and
only the part near the hearth was lined with matting; the table and the
few stools and chairs were rough carpentry, chiefly made out of boxes;
but upon the wall hung a beautiful print from Raffaelle, of which she
knew the giver as surely as if his name had been written on it; and the
small bookcase suspended near contained, compressed together, an
epitome of Louis's tastes--the choicest of all his favourites, in each
class of book.  Mary stood by it, reading the names, and trying to
perceive Louis's principle of selection in each case.  It jarred upon
her when, as the gentlemen loitered about, waiting for the evening
meal, they came and looked at the titles, with careless remarks that
the superintendent was a youth of taste, and a laugh at the odd
medley--Spenser, Shakspeare, 'Don Quixote,' Calderon, Fouque, and
selections from Jeremy Taylor, &c.
Mary would hear no more comments.  She went to the fire, and tried to
persuade Rosita they would come safe down again; and then, on the
apology for a mantelshelf, she saw some fossils and some dried grasses,
looking almost as if Fitzjocelyn had put them there.
She did not see Madison that night; but the next morning he presented
himself to act as their guide through the wonders of the extraordinary
region where his lot had been cast.  She found that this was only the
first floor of the wondrous castle.  Above and above, rose galleries,
whence the ore was lowered down to the buildings here placed, where it
underwent the first process of separation.  The paths above were fit
for none, save a chamois, or a barefooted Indian, or a sailor--for the
midshipman was climbing aloft in such places, that Tom's chief work was
to summon him back, in horror lest he should involve himself in endless
galleries, excavated before the days of Atahualpa.
Much of the desperate scrambling which Madison recommended as
plain-sailing, was beyond Mr. Ponsonby; but where he went, Mary went;
and when he stopped, she, though she had not drawn since the master at
her school had resigned her, as a hopeless case, applied herself to the
perpetration of an outline of the rocks, that, as she said, 'her aunts
might see what sort of place it was.'  Her steady head, and firm,
enterprizing hand and foot, enabled her to see the crowning wonder of
the mountain, one of the ventanillas or windows.  Mr. Ward, having
visited it, came back bent on taking her thither; there was no danger,
if she were not afraid.  So, between him and Tom Madison, she was
dragged up a steep path, and conducted into a gallery cut out in the
living rock, growing gloomier and gloomier, till suddenly there was a
spot of light on the sparkling floor, and Mary found herself beneath an
opening through the mountain crown, right up into the sky, which,
through the wild opening, looked of the deepest, most ultra-marine,
almost purple blue, utterly beyond conception in the glory of intense
colour, bringing only to her mind those most expressive, yet most
inexpressive words, 'the body of heaven in His clearness.'  She felt,
what she had often heard said, that to all mountain tops is given
somewhat of the glory that dwelt on Sinai.  That ineffable blue was
more dazzling than even the fields beyond fields of marvellous white
that met her eye on emerging from the dark gallery.
'I never wish so much that Lord Fitzjocelyn should see anything as
that,' said Tom Madison, when Mary, in her gratitude, was trying to say
something adequate to the trouble she had given, though the beauty was
beyond any word of admiration.
'He would--' she began to answer, but the rest died away, only answered
by Tom with an emphatic 'He would!' and then began the difficulties
of getting down.
But Mary had the pleasure at the next pause of hearing Mr. Ward say,
'That is a very fine intelligent young fellow, worthy of his library. I
think your father has a prize in him!'
Mary's eyes thanked Mr. Ward, with all her heart in them.  It was worth
going up the Andes for such a sentence to put into a letter that Aunt
Kitty would show to Louis.
Robson seemed anxious to monopolize the attention of the gentlemen, to
the exclusion of Madison; and while Tom was thus thrust aside, Mary
succeeded in having a conversation with him, such as she felt was a
sort of duty to Louis.  She asked him the names of the various
mountain-peaks in sight, whose bare crags, too steep to support the
snow, here and there stood out dark in salient contrast to the white
scenery, and as he gave them to her, mentioning the few facts that he
had been able to gather respecting them, she was able to ask him
whether he was in the habit of seeing anything approaching to society.
He smiled, saying that his nearest neighbours were many miles off--an
engineer conducting some far more extensive mining operations, whom he
sometimes met on business, and an old Spanish gentleman, who lived in a
valley far down the mountain side, with whom he sometimes smoked his
cigar on a Sunday, if he felt inclined for a perpendicular promenade on
a Peruvian causeway for nearly four miles.  Mary asked whether he often
did feel inclined.  No, he thought not often; he had generally worked
hard enough in the week to make his book the best company; but he liked
now and then to see something green for a change after these bare
mountains and rocks, and the old Don Manrique was very civil and
agreeable.  Then, after a few minutes' conversation of this kind,
something of the old conscious abruptness of tone seemed to come over
the young man, and looking down, he said bluntly, 'Miss Ponsonby, do
you think there would be any objection to my coming into Lima just for
Christmas?'
'I suppose not; I cannot tell.'
Tom explained that all the miners would be making holiday, and the
senior Cornishman might safely be left in charge of the works, while he
only wished to spend Christmas-day itself in the city, and would be a
very short time absent.  He blushed a little as he spoke, and Mary
ventured to reply to what she gathered of his thought, 'No other day
would suit you as well?'
'No, ma'am, it hardly would,' he answered, gravely.
'I will try what can be done,' said Mary, 'unless you would speak to
Mr. Ponsonby yourself.'
He looked inquiringly at Mr. Ponsonby's figure some paces distant, and
shook his head.
'I will try,' repeated Mary; and then she added, 'These grand hill-tops
and blue sky almost make a church--'
'Yes, ma'am,' said Tom, his black eyes lighting at the thought; 'I've
felt so sometimes, but 'tis a mighty lonely one after a time.  I've
taken my book, and got out of earshot of the noise the blacks make; and
I do assure you, Miss Ponsonby, the stillness was enough to drive one
wild, with nothing but savage rocks to look at either!  Not a green
plant, nor a voice to answer, unless one got to the mountain echoes,
and they are worse--'
'But surely you have the Cornishmen!  What do they do on a Sunday?'
'They lie about, and smoke and sleep, or go down to the valley,' said
Tom.  'I never thought of them.'
'I think you should,' said Mary, gravely.  'If you are in any authority
over them, it must give you a charge over their souls. I think you
should, at least, give them the choice of reading the service with you.'
'I'll think about it,' said Madison, gruffly.
'I will send up some books for them to make an opening,' said Mary. 'I
should not like to think of men living in such scenes, without being
the better for them.'
Robson was here obliged to call Madison to refer some question to him;
but Mary had another talk with him, when he begged to know if there
were likely soon to be an opportunity of sending to England. He had
some fossils which he wished to send to Lord Fitzjocelyn; and he
fetched them, and explained his theories with regard to them as if he
had almost forgotten that she was not his young Lord.  She carried his
request to her father, and was answered that of course he might take a
holiday if he could leave the works with safety; he had better spend a
few days in the town when he did come.  With this answer she made him
happy; and they set off, to the extreme joy of Rosita, who had
engrossed much less attention than she had expected, and declared she
would never have come into these horrible places if she could have
imagined what they were like.  Certainly, no one wished to have her
company there again.
When Mr. Ponsonby mentioned the permission which he had accorded to
Madison, Robson coughed and looked annoyed.  Mary could not help
suspecting that this was because the request had not been preferred
through himself.  'So the young fellow wants to be coming down, does
he?  I thought his ardour was too hot to last long.'
'Very natural that the poor lad should want a holiday,' said Mr.
Ponsonby.  'It must take a tolerable flow of spirits to stand long,
being so many feet above the level of the sea, in caves fit for a
robber's den at the theatre.'
'Oh, I am making no objection, sir,' returned Robson; 'the young man
may take his pleasure for what I care, so he can be trusted not to
neglect his business.'
Here the path narrowed, and Mary had to fall back out of hearing; but
she had an unpleasant suspicion that Robson was telling her father
something to Tom's disadvantage, and she had to consider how to avoid
rousing a jealousy, which she knew might be dangerous.
Mr. Ward, however, came up to interrupt her thoughts and watch the
steps of her mule.  The worst difficulties of the descent had precluded
all conversation; and the party were just beginning to breathe freely,
think of terra firma as not far off, and gaze with easier minds on the
marvellous ocean.  Mary went on in very comfortable discussion of the
wonders they had seen, and of Madison's remark that the performances of
the Incas made one quite ashamed of the achievements of modern
science--a saying in which Mr. Ward perfectly agreed; and then he began
to say something rather long, and a little disconnected, and Mary's
mind took an excursion to Aunt Kitty, and the reading of the letter
that she was going to write, when suddenly something in Mr. Ward's
voice startled her, and recalling her attention, she discovered, to her
dismay, that he was actually making her an offer!  An offer!  She would
as soon have expected one from her father!  And oh! how well
expressed--how entirely what it ought to be!  How unlike every one of
those three of her past experience!
In great distress she exclaimed, 'Oh, Mr. Ward, pray do not--indeed, I
cannot!'
'I feared that I was but too likely to meet with such an answer,' said
Mr. Ward; 'and yet your father encouraged me to hope, that in course of
time--'
'Then papa has told you what he thinks?' said Mary.
'I applied to him before I could venture to join this party.  Mary, I
am aware that I can bring none of the advantages which have'--his voice
faltered--'which have forestalled me; but the most true and earnest
affection is already yours.'
'I am very sorry for it, Mr. Ward,' said Mary, gravely, though much
touched.  'It is very kind of you, but it is only fair and candid to
tell you that papa has probably led you into a mistake.  He thinks that
the--the object was weak and unworthy, and that my feelings could be
easily overcome.  He does not know--'
'He assured me that all was at an end--'
'It is,' said Mary; 'but I am certain that I shall never feel for any
one else the same as'--and the tears were coming last.  'You are very
kind, Mr. Ward, but it is of no use to think that this can ever be.'
'Forgive me for having harassed you,' said Mr. Ward, and they went on
so long in silence that Mary hoped it was over, and yet he did not go
away from her.  She was sorry to see the grieved, dejected expression
on his good, sensible, though somewhat worn countenance; and she
esteemed him highly; but who could have thought of so unlucky a fancy
coming into his head?  When, at length, he spoke again, it was to say
that he begged that she would forget what was past, and allow him to
continue on his former footing.  Mary was glad to have something
grateful to say, and answered that she should have been very sorry to
lose him as a friend; whereupon his face cheered up, he thanked her,
and fell back from her rein.  In spite of her past trials of the
futility of the attempt to live with a rejected suitor as if nothing
had happened, she had hopes of the possibility when her own heart was
untouched, and the gentleman nearly doubled her years; but when she
talked to her father, she gathered that it was considered by both
gentlemen that the proposal had been premature, and that her final
detachment from Louis was reckoned on as so certain that Mr. Ward was
willing to wait, as if it were only a matter of time.  He was so
wealthy and prosperous, and a connexion with him would have been so
useful to the firm, that Mary was grateful to her father for forbearing
to press her on what he evidently wished so earnestly. Mr. Ward had
exactly the excellent, well-balanced character, which seemed made to
suit her, and she could have imagined being very happy with him,
if--No, no--Mr. Ward could not be thought of at the same moment.
Yet, whatever she might say, no one would believe her; so she held her
peace, and wrote her history of the silver mines; and Mr. Ward haunted
the house, and was most kindly forbearing and patient, and Mary found
at every turn, how good a man he was, and how cruel and mistaken his
sister thought her.
And Christmas came, when the churches were perfect orange-groves, and
the scene of the wanderers of Bethlehem was acted from house to house
in the twilight.  The scanty English congregation met in the room that
served as a chapel in the Consul's house--poor Mary alone of all her
household there to keep the feast; and Mr. Ward was there, and Madison
had come down from his mountain.  There were hearts at home that would
rejoice to hear that.
Mary saw him afterwards, and he thanked her for her suggestion
respecting the miners.  Two had been only as shy as Tom himself; they
had been reading alone, and were glad to join company, a third was
beginning to come, and it had led to a more friendly intercourse. Mary
sent him away, very happy with some books for them, some new Spanish
reading for himself, an astronomical book, and her little celestial
globe--for the whole firmament of stars had been by no means lost on
him.  That interview was her Christmas treat.  Well for her that she
did not hear Robson say, 'That young man knows how to come over the
ladies.  I shall keep a sharper look-out after him. I know no harm of
him, but if there's one man I trust less than another, it is one that
tries the serious dodge.'
CHAPTER X.
THE WRONG WOMAN IN THE WRONG PLACE.
Give me again my hollow tree,
My crust of bread, and liberty.
The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse--POPE.
The new cook's first compliment to Charlotte was, 'Upon my word, you
are a genteel young woman, I dare say you have a lot of sweethearts.'
The indignant denial of the Lady of Eschalott was construed into her
being 'sly,' and Mrs. Cook promised herself to find her out.
Those were not happy days with the little maiden.  The nurse looked
down on her, and the cook filled the kitchen with idlers, whose looks
and speeches were abhorrent to her.  Sometimes the woman took offence
at her for being high; at others, she forced on her advice upon her
dress, or tried to draw out confidences either on lovers or the affairs
of the family.  Charlotte was sadly forlorn, and shut herself up in her
pantry, or in her own little attic with Jane's verbenas which cook had
banished from the kitchen, and lost her sorrows in books hired at the
library.  She read, and dreamt, created leisure for reading, lived in a
trance, and awoke from it to see her work neglected, reproach herself,
and strain her powers to make up for what was left undone.  Then,
finding her efforts failing, she would be distressed and melancholy,
until a fresh novel engrossed her for a time, and the whole scene was
enacted over again.
Still, it was not all idleness nor lost ground.  The sense of
responsibility was doing her good, she withstood the cook's follies,
and magnanimously returned unopened a shining envelope of Mr.
Delaford's.  At Christmas, when Mr. and Mrs. Frost went to pay a visit
at Beauchastel, and the cook enjoyed a course of gaieties, the only use
she made of her liberty was to drink tea once with Mrs. Martha, and to
walk over to Marksedge to see old Madison, who was fast breaking, and
who dictated to her his last messages to his grandson.
James and Isabel spent a pleasant lively Christmas with their
hospitable old friends, and James returned full of fresh vigour and new
projects.  His first was to offer his assistance to the Vicar, so as to
have a third service on the Sunday; but there were differences of
opinion between them, and his proposal was received so ungraciously,
that a coolness arose, which cut him off from many openings for
usefulness.
However, he had enough to occupy him in his own department, the school.
He was astonished at his boys' deficiency in religious instruction, and
started a plan for collecting them for some teaching for an hour before
morning service.  Mr. Calcott agreed with him that nothing could be
more desirable, but doubted whether the parents would compel their sons
to attend, and advised James to count the cost, doubting whether, in
the long run, he would be able to dispense with one day of entire rest.
This was the more to be considered, since James expended a wonderful
amount of energy in his teaching, did his utmost to force the boys on,
in class and in private, drilled his usher, joined in the games, and
gave evening lectures on subjects of general information.
Some responded to his training, and these he strenuously encouraged,
asking them to dinner and taking them to walk; and these were
enthusiastically fond of him, and regarded his beautiful wife as a
being of a superior order.  Fitzjocelyn and James used to agree that
intercourse with her was a very important element in their training,
and the invitations were made as impartial as possible, including the
intelligent and well-conducted, irrespective of station.  Isabel's
favourite guest was a good, well-mannered lad, son to Mr. Ramsbotham's
follower, the butcher, but, unluckily, Mrs. Richardson and her friends
did not esteem it a compliment when their sons were asked to meet him,
and, on the other hand, James did not always distinguish real merit
from mere responsiveness to his own mind. Dull boys, or such as had a
half sullen, half conservative dislike to change, did not gain notice
of an agreeable kind, and while intending to show strict justice, he
did not know how far he was affected by his prepossessions.
His lectures had emancipated him from evening parties; and, after Mrs.
Frost's departure, visiting gave Isabel little trouble.  The calm,
lofty manners that had been admired in Miss Conway, were thought pride
in Mrs. James Frost, and none of the ladies of Northwold even wished to
do more than exchange morning calls with her, and talk among themselves
of her fine-ladyism.  She recked nothing of their keeping aloof; her
book and her pen were far pleasanter companions on her alternate
evenings of solitude, and in them she tried to lose her wishes for the
merry days spent with granny and Clara, and her occasional perceptions
that all was not as in their time.  James would sometimes bring this
fact more palpably before her.
The separation of the families had not diminished the income of the
household, but the difference in comfort was great.  Isabel knew
nothing of management, and did not care to learn.  She had been willing
to live on a small scale, but she did not understand personal
superintendence, she was careless of display, and perfectly happy as
long as she was the guest of the grandmother, but she had no
comprehension of petty tidinesses or small economies.  Now James,
brought up on a very different scale, knew in detail how the household
ought to live, and made it a duty not to exceed a fixed sum.  He had
the eye for neatness that she wanted; he could not believe it a
hardship to go without indulgences to which his grandmother and sister
had not been accustomed.  Thus, he protested against unnecessary fires;
Isabel shivered and wore shawls; he was hurt at seeming to misuse her,
resigned his study fire, and still found the coals ever requiring to be
renewed, insisted that his wife should speak to the cook, and mystified
her by talking about the regulation of the draught of the kitchen fire;
and when Isabel understood, she forgot the lecture.
He was a devoted and admiring husband, but he could not coolly discover
innumerable petty neglects and wasteful habits.  Impatient words broke
out, and Isabel always received them so meekly that he repented and
apologized; and in the reconciliation the subject was forgotten, but
only to be revived another time.  Isabel was always ready to give warm
aid and sympathy in all his higher cares and purposes, and her mild
tranquillity was repose and soothing to him, but she was like one in a
dream.  She had married a vision of perfection, and entered on a
romance of happy poverty, and she had no desire to awaken; so she never
exerted her mind upon the world around her, when it seemed oppressive;
and kept the visionary James Frost before her, in company with Adeline
and the transformed Sir Hubert. It was much easier to line his tent
with a tapestry of Maltese crosses, than to consider whether the hall
should be covered with cocoanut matting.
How Christmas passed with Clara, may be seen in the following letter:--
'Cheveleigh, Jan. 1851.
'Dearest Jem,--I can write a long letter to-night, for a fortunate cold
has spared me from one of Sir Andrew's dinner-parties.  It is a
reminiscence of the last ball, partly brought on by compunction at
having dragged poor granny thither, in consideration of my unguarded
declaration of intense dislike to be chaperoned by Lady Britton. Granny
looks glorious in black velvet and diamonds, and I do trust that her
universal goodwill rendered the ball more tolerable to her than it was
to me.  She, at least, is all she seems; whereas I am so infested with
civilities, that I long to proclaim myself little Clara Frost, bred up
for a governess, and the laughing-stock of her school. Oh! for that
first ball where no one danced with me but Mr. Richardson, and I was
not a mere peg for the display of Uncle Oliver's Peruvian jewels!  I
have all the trouble in the world to be allowed to go about fit to be
seen, and only by means of great fighting and coaxing did I prevail to
have my dress only from London instead of Paris.
'And no wonder I shivered all the way to the ball.  Fancy Jane
insisting on my going to display my dress to that poor dying Marianne;
I was shocked at the notion of carrying my frivolities into such a
scene, but Jane said her mind ran on it, and it was 'anything to take
off her thoughts from that man.'  So I went into her room, and oh! if
you could have seen the poor thing, with her short breath and racking
cough, her cheeks burning and her eyes glistening at that flimsy
trumpery.  One bunch of the silver flowers on my skirt was wrong; she
spied it, and they would not thwart her, so she would have the needle,
and the skeleton trembling fingers set them right.  They said she would
sleep the easier for it, and she thanked me as if it had really set her
more at rest; but how sad, how strange it seems, when she knows that
she is sinking fast, and has had Mr. Danvers with her every day.   He
thinks all is well with her; but it was a melancholy, blank, untaught
mind, to begin to work on.  Louis would call her life a mournful
picture of our civilization.  She has told it all to Jane: she was of
the mechanic class, just above the rank that goes to Sunday-schools;
she went to a genteel weekly school, and was taken out pleasuring on
Sunday--no ground-work at all.  An orphan at fifteen, she never again
knew tenderness.  Then came dressmaking till her health failed, and she
tried service.  She says, Isabel's soft tones made a paradise for her;
but late hours, which she did not feel at the time, wore her out, and
Delaford trifled with her. Always when alone he pretended devotion to
her, then flirted with any other who came in his way, and worry and
fretting put the finish to her failing health.  She had no spirit to
break entirely with him, and even now is pining for one kind word,
which he seems to be too hard and selfish to send to her, in answer to
a letter of forgiveness that she wrote a fortnight back.  What a wretch
he must be!  Jane says, he tried flirting with poor little Charlotte,
and that she was a little 'took up' with his guitar and his verses; but
then, Jane says, 'Charlotte has somewhat at the bottom, and knows
better than to heed a man as wasn't real religious.'  I suppose that is
the true difference between Charlotte and Marianne, and even if we
looked into Delaford's history, most likely we should find him another
nineteenth-century victim to an artificial life.  At least, I trust
that Jane has been the greatest blessing, Marianne herself speaks of
her as more than a mother to her; and I believe I told you of the poor
girl's overpowering gratitude, when she found we would not turn her out
to die homeless.  We read, and we talk, and Mr. Danvers comes; but I
believe dear old Jane does more for her than all.
'Poor Jane! when her task of nursing is over, I do not know what she
will turn to.  The grand servants only keep terms with her because
Uncle Oliver gave notice that no one should stay in the house who did
not show respect to his friend Mrs. Beckett.  It takes all her love
for Missus and Master Oliver to make her bear it; and her chief solace
is in putting me to bed, and in airing Master Oliver's shirt and
slippers.  You would laugh to hear her compassionating the home
minced-pies! and she tells me she would give fifty pounds rather than
bring Charlotte here.  My uncle wished grandmamma to manage the house,
and she did so at first, but she and the servants did not get on well
together; and she said, what I never knew her say before, that she is
too old, and so we have an awful dame who rules with a high hand.
'You ask whether the dear granny is happy.  You know she is all
elasticity, and things are pleasanter here to her than to me, but I do
not think she enjoys life as she did at home.  It is hard to have her
whole mission reduced to airing those four horses.  We have tormented
my uncle out of making us use more than two at a time, by begging for
six and the Lord Mayor's coach; but aired alternately they must be, and
we must do it, and by no road but what the coachman chooses; and this
does not seem to me to agree with her like trotting about the town on
her errands.  There is no walking here, excepting in the
pleasure-ground, where all my grandfather's landscape-gardening has
been cut up so as to be a mere vexation to her.  The people round are
said to be savage and disaffected, and the quarter of a mile between
the park and the village is subject to miners going home.  They did
once holloa at me, and orders were issued that I should walk no more.
I believe that if they saw me fearless, and coming among them for
friendly purposes, they would leave off hooting; but the notion
frightens granny, so I am a prisoner.  They are the people to think it
a mockery to be visited by a lady bedizened as I am, and stuck up in a
carriage; so we can do very little except through Mr. Danvers, and my
uncle is always discontented at the sight of him, and fancies he is
always begging. A little sauciness on my part has the best effect when
anything is wanted, for my uncle is very kind to me in his own fashion,
which is not mine.
'We have made something of a nest in the last of the suite of rooms,
the only one habitably small; but it is wonderful where all the time in
the day goes.  My uncle likes me to ride with him in the morning, and I
have to help granny air the horses in the afternoon; and in the
evening, when we are lucky enough to dine alone, I play them both
asleep, unless they go to backgammon.  Think of granny reduced to that!
We should be very happy when he is detained in his study, but that
granny thinks it is bad for him.  Dear granny!
I see the object of her life is to win him back to serious thoughts.
She seems to think of him like a schoolboy who must be lured to find
home pleasanter than idle ways; and she begs me quite sadly to bear
with him, and make him happy, to prevent him from longing after his
counting-house at Lima.  She tried to make him promise never to go
back, but he has only promised never to go while she lives, and she
seems to think it would be fatal, and to charge all his disregard of
religious matters upon herself for having sent him out.  If you could
see her pleased smile when we extort a subscription, or when she gets
him to church; but when those South American mails come in on
Sundays--alas!  Those accounts are his real element, and his moments of
bliss are over the 'Money-market and City intelligence,' or in
discussing railway shares with Sir Andrew.  All the rest is an
obstinate and dismal allegiance to the days of Shrievalty, about as
easy to recall as the days when the Pendragons wore golden collars and
armlets.  Imitated hospitality turns into ostentation; and the people
who seek after silver covers and French cookery are no more to my taste
than they are, in good earnest, to Uncle Oliver's.  The nice people, if
there are any, won't come in our way, except Mr. Henderson; and when we
do pluck up courage to disgust Mr. Coachman by calling on Mrs.
Henderson, we are very happy.  But she is a wise woman, and will not
bring her pretty Fanny into our world; and when I press her, behold! I
remember what I used to think of patronage.
'But Louis has promised to come at Easter, and he will teach me a
little more charity, I hope; and, what is better (no, I don't mean
that), will tell me about the dear, dear, trebly dear Terrace and all
the doings.  I hope you will begin your Sunday scheme; but granny fears
the bad set will not care, and the good will prefer having their
families together.  It is worse than I expected even of Mr. Purvis to
refuse the afternoon service, when you offered to take all the trouble
off his hands; granny hopes you will take care what you are about with
him.  Tell Louis we have a famous letter from Mary to show him if he
will bring us all news of every one, and especially of his godchild.
Contrary to custom, you tell us more about her than her mamma does.
'Your most affectionate Sister,
'CLARA.'
Before Easter, Charlotte's poor rival was lying at rest in Cheveleigh
churchyard, and Jane's task of love was at an end.
CHAPTER XI.
AUNT CATHARINE'S HOME.
The lady sleeps--O may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This bed being changed for one more holy,
This room for one more melancholy,
Some tomb, that oft hath flung its black
And wing-like panels fluttering back,
Triumphant o'er the fluttering palls
Of her grand family funerals.
E. A. POE.
The summer was nearly over, when, one morning at breakfast, Louis
surprised his father by a sound, half consternation, half amusement,
and handed him a note, containing these words:--
'DEAR F.,--There were three of us last night; there are five this
morning.  Isabel and the twins are doing well.  Heaven knows what is to
become of us!
'Yours,
J. F.'
'What would you have?' said Lord Ormersfield, calmly.  'The poorer
people are, the more children they have!'
He went on with his own letters, while Louis laughed at the enunciation
of this inverse ratio; and then took up the note again, to wonder at
the tone of anxiety and distress, so unlike James.  He went to call on
Lady Conway, and was better satisfied to find that James had written in
a lively strain to her, as if proud of his little daughters, and
resolved not to be pitied.  Of this he was in no danger from his
sisters-in-law, who looked upon twin-girls as the only blessing needed
to complete Isabel's felicity, had devised three dozen names for them,
and longed to be invited to Northwold to see them.
Nothing was heard of James for more than a week, and, as London grew
hotter, dustier, and drearier than ever, Fitzjocelyn longed, more than
he thought wholesome to confess, after Ormersfield turf, the deep
ravines, and rushing brooks.  The sun shone almost through the blind of
the open window on the large library table, where sat Louis at his own
end, writing to his Inglewood bailiff, and now and then solacing
himself by lifting with the feather of his pen one of the bells of a
delicate lily in a glass before him--a new spectacle on the Earl's
writing-table; and so was a strip of vellum, with illuminations rich
and rare--Louis's indulgence when he felt he had earned an hour's
leisure.  There was a ring at the door, a step on the stairs, and
before the father and son stood James, his little black bag in his
hand, like himself, all dust, and his face worn, heated, and tired.
'Then you have not heard from Cheveleigh?' he said, in answer to their
astonished greetings, producing a note, which was eagerly read:--
'Dearest Jem,--My uncle says I may write to you, in case you can leave
Isabel, that he will be glad to see you.  I told you that dear
grandmamma had a cold, and so we would not let her come to Isabel; but
I little guessed what was coming.  It only seemed a feverish cold, and
Jane and I almost laughed at my uncle for choosing to send for a
doctor.  He was not alarmed at first, but yesterday she was inert and
sleepy, and he asked for more advice.  Dr. Hastings came to-day, and
oh! Jem, he calls it a breaking up of the constitution, and does not
think she will rally.  She knows us, but she is almost always drowsy,
and very hard to rouse.  If you can come without hurting Isabel, I know
you will.  We want you all the more, because my uncle will not let me
send for Mr. Danvers.  Poor Uncle Oliver is dreadfully troubled.
'Your most affectionate CLARA.'
'Transplantation has killed her--I knew it would!' said James, as Louis
stood, with the note in his hand, as if not yet understanding the blow.
'Nay,' said the Earl, 'it is an age at which we could hardly hope she
would long be spared.  You could leave Mrs. James Frost with comfort?'
'Yes, Miss Mercy undertakes her--she is doing well--she would not hear
of my staying.  I must go on, the train starts at two,' he added,
hastily, looking at the time-piece.
'We will send you,' said Lord Ormersfield.  'Take time to rest.  You
look very ill!  You should have some luncheon.'
'No, thank you!' said James, at first with the instinct of resistance;
but yielding and confessing, 'Charlotte went into hysterics, and I had
nothing to eat before I came away.'
Louis came forward from the window where he had been standing as in a
dream, he laid his hand on James's shoulder, and said, 'I will go!' His
voice was hardly audible, but, clearing it, and striving to recall his
thoughts, he added, 'Father, I can be spared.  The division is not
coming on to-night, or you could get me a pair.'
The Earl looked doubtfully at James.
'Yes, let me go,' said Louis.  'I must see her again.  It has been
mother and son between us.'  And, hiding his face in his hands, he
hurried out of the room.
'Let him come,' said James.  'If duty and affection claim a right, none
have such as he.'
'I hesitate only as to acting unceremoniously by your uncle.'
'This is no moment for ceremony--no time to deprive her of whatever she
loves best.'
'Be it so, then.  His own feelings are his best passport, and well has
she deserved all that he can ever feel!  And, James, if she should
express any desire to see me, if I can be of any use in settling
matters, or could promote any better understanding with your uncle, I
am ready at a moment's notice.  I would come at once, but that many
might be burdensome to your uncle and sister.'
The two cousins were quickly on their way.  James took a second-class
ticket, the first time he had ever done so in travelling with his
cousin.  Fitzjocelyn placed himself beside him without remark.
James dozed as well as the narrow seat would permit, and only woke to
chafe at each halt, and Louis mused over the associations of those
scenes, and last year's triumphant return.  Had the change of habits
truly hastened the decay of her powers? had her son's toil and success
been merely to bring her home to the grave of her fathers, at the
expense of so many heartburnings, separations, and dissensions? At
least, he trusted that her last hours might be crowned by the
peacemaker's joy, and that she might see strife and bitterness laid
aside between Oliver, and Henry's only surviving son.
Alas! it was not to be.  The shutters and blinds were closed, and Clara
met them at the door, her pale face and streaming eyes forestalling the
tidings.  The frame, hitherto so vigorous and active, had been spared
long or weary decay; and tranquil torpor had mildly conducted the
happy, gentle spirit to full repose.  She had slumbered away without
revival or suffering, as one who did 'rest from her labours,' and her
eyes had been closed on the previous night.
Clara wept as she spoke, but she had been alone with her sorrow long
enough to face it, and endure calmly.
Not so her brother.  It was anguish to have come too late, and to have
missed the last word and look; and he strode madly up and down the
room, almost raving at the separation and removal which he declared had
killed her.
'Oh, speak to him, Louis!' cried Clara.  'Oh, what shall I do?'
As she spoke, the door was opened, and Mr. Dynevor came in, with a
grief-stricken look and quieter manner, but his entrance instantly
silenced all James's demonstrations, and changed them into a haughty,
compressed bitterness, as though he actually looked on him in the light
of his grandmother's destroyer.
'Ah! James,' began his uncle, gently, 'I wish you had been here
earlier!'
'I left home by the first train after hearing.  I ought to have heard
sooner.'
'I could not suppose you would choose to come here without serious
reason,' said Oliver, with more dignity than usual.  'However, I would
willingly forget, and you will remain here for the present.'
'I must apologize for having thrust myself on you, sir,' said Louis,
'but, indeed, I could not stay away.  After what she has been to me,
ever since I can remember her--' and tears cut him short.
'Sir, it does you honour!' returned Oliver.  'She was attached to you.
I hope you will not leave us as yet.'
Louis felt as if he could not leave the house where what was mortal of
his dear old aunt yet remained, and he likewise had a perception that
he might be a support and assistance to Clara in keeping the peace
between her brother and uncle; so he gratefully accepted the invitation.
Mr. Dynevor presently explained that he intended the funeral to take
place at the end of the week.
'I can not be so long from home,' said James, in a quick, low voice.
Clara ran up to her uncle, laid her hand on his arm, and drew him into
a window, whence he presently turned, saying, 'Your sister tells me
that you cannot be so long absent in the present state of your family.
If possible, the day shall be hastened.'
James was obliged to say, 'Thank you!' but any concession seemed to
affect him like an injury.
Grievous work was it to remain at Cheveleigh, under the constant dread
of some unbecoming outbreak between uncle and nephew. Fortunately,
Oliver had too much on his hands to have much time to spend with the
others; but when they were together, there was scarcely a safe subject,
not even the intended names of the twins. James made hasty answer that
they had already received their names, Mercy and Salome.  Louis and
Clara both cried out incredulously.
'Yes,' said James.  'We don't like family names.'
'But such as those!'
'I wish nothing better for them than to be such another pair of
faithful sisters.  May they only do as well, poor children!'
The end was softer than the beginning, and there was a tight short
sigh, that seemed to burst upward from a whole world of suppressed
anxiety and despondence.
It was not easy to understand him, he would not talk of home, was brief
about his little Catharine; and when Clara said something of Isabel's
writings, formerly his great pride, and feared that she would have no
more time for them, his blunt answer was, 'She ought not.'
These comparatively indifferent topics were the only resource; for he
treated allusions to his grandmother as if they were rending open a
wound, and it was only in his absence that Louis and Clara could hold
the conversations respecting her, which were their chief comfort and
relief.  If they were certain that Oliver was busy, and James writing
letters, they would walk up and down the sheltered alley, where Louis
had last year comforted Clara.  The green twilight and chequered shade
well accorded with the state of their minds, darkened, indeed, by one
of the severest losses that could ever befall either of them, and yet
it was a sorrow full of thankfulness and blessed hope.
Louis spoke of his regret that scenes of uncongenial gaiety should have
been forced upon her last year.
'I believe it made very little difference to her,' said Clara.  'She
did just what Uncle Oliver wished, but only as she used to play with
us, no more; nay, rather less for her own amusement than as she would
play at battledore, or at thread-paper verses.'
'And she was not teased nor harassed?'
'I think not.  She was grieved if I were set against Uncle Oliver's
plans, and really hurt if she could not make him think as she did about
right and wrong, but otherwise she was always bright.  She never found
people tiresome; she could find something kind to say to and for the
silliest; and when my uncle's display was most provoking, she would
only laugh at 'poor Oliver's' odd notions of doing her honour.  I used
to be quite ashamed of the fuss I would make when I thought a thing
vulgar; when I saw that sort of vanity by the side of her real
indifference, springing from unworldliness.'
'And then her mornings were quiet?'
'More quiet than at home.  While we were riding, she used to sit with
her dear old big Bible, and the two or three old books she was so fond
of.  You remember her Sutton and her Bishop Home, and often she would
show me some passage that had struck her as prettier than ever, well as
she had always known it.  Once she said she was very thankful for the
leisure time, free from household cares, and even from friendly gossip;
for she said first she had been gay, then she had been busy, and had
never had time to meditate quietly.'
'So she made a cloister of this grand house.  Ah! I trusted she was
past being hurt by external things.  That grand old age was like a pure
glad air where worldly fumes could not mount up.  My only fear would
have been this unlucky estrangement making her unhappy.'
'I think I may tell you how she felt it,' said Clara; 'I am trying to
tell James, but I don't know whether I can.  She said she had come to
perceive that she had confounded pride with independence.  She blamed
herself, so that I could not bear to hear it, for the grand fine things
in her life.  She said pride had made her stand alone, and unkindly
spurn much that was kindly meant.  I don't mean that she repented of
the actions, but of the motives; she said the glory of being beholden
to no one had run through everything; and had been very hurtful even to
Uncle Oliver.  She never let him know all her straits, and was too
proud, she said, to ask, when she was hurt at his not offering help,
and so she made him seem more hard-hearted, and let us become set
against him.  She said she had fostered the same temper in poor Jem,
who had it strongly enough by inheritance, and that she had never known
the evil, nor understood it as pride, till she saw the effects.'
'Did they make her unhappy?'
'She cried when she spoke of it, and I have seen her in tears at
church, and found her eyes red when she had been alone, but I don't
think it was a hard, cruel sorrow; I think the sunshine of her nature
managed to beam through it.'
'The sunshine was surely love,' said Louis, 'making the rainbow of hope
on the tears of repentance.  Perhaps it is a blessing vouchsafed to the
true of heart to become aware of such a hidden constitutional infirmity
in time to wash it out with blessed tears like those.'
'Hidden,' said Clara, 'yes, indeed it was, even from herself, because
it never showed in manner, like my pride; she was gracious and affable
to all the world.  I heard the weeding-women saying, 'she had not one
bit of pride,' and when I told her of it, she shook her head, and
laughed sadly, and said that was the kind of thing which had taken her
in.'
'Common parlance is a deceitful thing,' said Louis, sighing; 'people
can't even be sincere without doing harm!  Well, I had looked to see
her made happy by harmony between those two!'
'She gave up the hope of seeing it,' said Clara, 'but she looked to it
all the same.  She said meekly one day that it might be her penalty to
see them at variance in her own lifetime, but over her grave perhaps
they would be reconciled, and her prayers be answered. How she did love
Uncle Oliver!  Do you know, Louis, what she was to him showed me what
the mother's love must be, which we never missed, because--because we
had her!'
'Don't talk of it, Clara,' said Louis, hastily; 'we cannot dwell on
ourselves, and bear it patiently!'
It was truly the loss of a most tender mother to them both; bringing
for the first time the sense of orphanhood on the girl, left between
the uncongenial though doting uncle, and the irritable though
affectionate brother; and Louis, though his home was not broken up,
suffered scarcely less.  His aunt's playful sweetness had peculiarly
accorded with his disposition, and the affection and confidence of his
fond, clinging nature had fastened themselves upon her, all the more in
the absence of his own Mary.  Each loss seemed to make the other more
painful.  Aunt Kitty's correspondence was another link cut away between
him and Peru, and he had never known such a sense of dreariness in his
whole life.  Clara was going patiently and quietly through those trying
days, with womanly considerateness; believing herself supported by her
brother, and being so in fact by the mere sisterly gratification of his
presence, though she was far more really sustained and assisted by
Fitzjocelyn.  How much happier was the sorrow of Louis and Clara than
that of James or Oliver!  Tempers such as those in which the uncle and
nephew but too closely resembled each other were soured, not softened
by grief, and every arrangement raised discussions which did not tend
to bring them nearer together.
Oliver designed a stately funeral.  Nothing was too much for him to
lavish on his mother, and he was profuse in orders for hangings,
velvet, blazonry, mutes, and hired mourners, greedy of offers of the
dreary state of empty carriages, demanding that of Lord Ormersfield,
and wanting James to write to Lady Conway for the same purpose.
Nothing could be more adverse to the feelings of the grandchildren; but
Clara had been schooled into letting her uncle have his way, and knew
that dear granny would have said Oliver might do as he pleased with her
in death as in life, owning the affection so unpleasantly manifested;
James, on the other hand, could see no affection, nothing but
disgusting parade, as abhorrent to his grandmother's taste as to his
own.  He thought he had a right to be consulted, for he by no means
believed himself to have abdicated his headship of the family; and he
made his voice heard entirely without effect, except the indignation of
his uncle, and the absence of the Conway carriage; although Lord
Ormersfield wrote that he should bring Sir Walter in his own person,
thus leaving James divided between satisfaction in any real token of
respect to his grandmother, and dislike to gratifying Oliver's
ostentation by the production of his baronet kin.
Sydney Calcott wrote to him in the name of various former scholars of
Mrs. Frost, anxious to do her the last honours by attending the
funeral.  Homage to her days of gallant exertion in poverty was most
welcome and touching to the young people; but their uncle, without
taste to understand it, wishing to forget her labours, and fancying
them discreditable to a daughter of the Dynevors, received the proposal
like an indignity; and but for Fitzjocelyn's mediation and
expostulations, it would have been most unsuitably rejected.  He was
obliged to take the answer into his own hands, since Oliver insisted
that his mother was to be regarded in no light save that of Mrs.
Dynevor, of Cheveleigh; and James was equally resolved that she should
be only Mrs. Frost, of Dynevor Terrace.
It was heart-sickening to see these bickerings over the grave of one so
loving and so beloved; and very trying to be always on the alert to
obviate the snappings that might at any time become a sharp dissension;
but nothing very distressing actually arose until the last day before
the funeral, when the three cousins were sitting together in the
morning-room; James writing letters.
'I am asking Lady Conway to give you a bed to-morrow night, Clara,' he
said.  'We shall be at home by three o'clock.'
'Oh, Jem!' said Clara, clasping her hands to keep them from trembling;
'I never thought of that.'
'You are not ready!  That is unlucky, for I cannot come to fetch you;
but I suppose you can travel down with Jane.  Only I should have
thought it easier to do the thing at once.'
'But, Jem! has my uncle said anything?  Does he wish me to go?'
James laid down his pen, and stood upright, as if he did not understand
her words.
Clara came up to him, saying, 'I believe I ought to do what he may
wish.'
'I told you,' said James, as if her words were not worth considering,
'that you need only remain here on her account, who no longer needs
you.'
Louis would have left them to themselves, but Clara's glance sued for
his protection, and, as he settled himself in his chair, she spoke with
more decision.--'Dear James, nothing would make me so happy as to go to
dear home; but I do not think grandmamma would like me to leave Uncle
Oliver.'
'Oh, very well,' said James, sitting down to his writing, as if he had
done with her; 'I understand.'
'Dear James!  O tell me you are not angry with me!  Tell me you think I
am right!' cried Clara, alarmed by his manner.
'Quite right in one point of view,' he said, with acrimony.
'James,' said Louis, very low, but so as to make them both start, 'that
is not the way to treat your sister!'
'We will renew the discussion another time, if you wish it, Clara,'
said James.
'No,' said Clara, 'I wish Louis to be here.  He will judge for me,' and
she spoke clearly, her face colouring.  'It was grandmamma's great wish
that I should love my uncle.  She used to beg me to be patient with
him, and rejoiced to see us together.  She often said he must not be
left with no one to make a home for him, and to go out to Lima again.'
'Did she ever desire you to remain here?'
'No,' said Clara, 'she never did; but I am convinced that if she had
known how soon she was to leave us, she would have done so.  I feel as
much bound as if she had.  I have heard her call him my charge. And not
only so, but my uncle has never varied in his kindness to me, and when
he worked all his life for grandmamma, and my father, it would be
wicked and cruel in me--if he does care for me--to forsake him, now he
has lost them all, and is growing old.'
'You need not scruple on that score,' said James.  'He has attained his
object, and made the most of it.  He is free now, and he will soon find
a Rosita, if his mines are not sufficient for him.'
'James, you should not say wrong things,' said Clara.
'I am not likely to think it wrong, whatever you may.  I have no
expectations.  Do not rise up in arms against me, Fitzjocelyn, I do not
accuse her.  I might have foreseen it.  She meant well at first, but
the Terrace cannot bear competition with a place like this. Where two
so-called duties clash, she is at perfect liberty to make her choice.
It would not be easy to come down to what I have to offer.  I
understand.  The world will call it a wise choice.  Say no more, Clara,
I feel no anger.'
She attempted no words; she clasped her hands over her face, and ran
out of the room.
'James,' said Louis, rising, indignation rendering his voice more low
and clearly distinct than ever, 'I little thought to hear you insult
that orphan sister of yours in her grief.  No! I shall not defend her,
I shall go to give her what comfort I can.  Heaven help her, poor
lonely child!'
He was gone.  James paced about in desperation, raving against Louis
for maintaining what he thought Clara's self-deception; and, in the
blindness of anger, imagining that their ultra-generosity would conduct
them to the repair of Ormersfield with the revenues of Cheveleigh; and,
disdainful as he was, it seemed another cruel outrage that his rightful
inheritance should be in the hands of another, and his children
portionless.  He was far too wrathful to have any consistency or
discrimination in his anger, and he was cruelly wounded at finding that
his sister deserted him, as he thought, for her uncle's riches, and
that his own closest friend was ready to share the spoil.
In the stillness of the house, the sound of a door had revealed to
Louis where to seek his cousin.  It was in the grand saloon, where the
closed shutters availed not to exclude the solid beams of slanting
sunlight falling through the crevices, and glancing on the gilding,
velvet, and blazonry upon the costly coffin, that shut her out from the
dear tender hands and lips that had never failed to caress away her
childish griefs.  At first, the strange broad lines of shadowy light in
the gloom were all he could see, but one ray tinged with paly light a
plaited tress, which could only be Clara's flaxen hair.
She had flung herself, crouching in a heap, on the floor, never
stirring, so that he almost feared she had fainted; and, kneeling on
one knee beside her, spoke soothingly: 'My poor little dear Clary, this
is the worst of all, but you know it was not Jem who spoke.  It was
only prejudice and temper.  He is not himself.'
The dim light seemed to encourage Clara to lift her head to listen to
the kind words.  'Was I so very wrong?' she murmured; 'you know I never
thought of that!  Will he forgive me, and let me come home? But, oh,
granny! and what is to become of my uncle?' she ended, with a sound of
misery.
'Not here, not now, Clara--' said Louis; 'She is in perfect peace;
unhurt by our unhappy dissensions; she is with Him who looks at hearts,
who can take away all variance.'
There was a short space of silence, as the two cousins knelt in the
darkened room, in the sunbeams, which seemed as if they could not yet
forsake her who had lived in the light of love.
Presently Louis gave Clara his hand to raise her, and led her into the
adjoining room, also dim, but full of sweet fragrant breezes from the
garden.  He seated her on a low couch, and stood by, anxiously watching
her.
'If he had only told me I was wrong!' she sighed.
'He could not tell you so, Clara, for it is not wrong, and he knows it
is not.  He will thank you by-and-by for not attending to him, now that
he does not know what he says.  He is fairly distracted with this grief
coming upon his home cares.'
'Cares at dear, dear happy home!' cried Clara.  'Never!'
'Ah, Clara!  I fear that much comfort went away with dear granny. I
think he is overtasking himself at the school; and three children
within a year may well make a man anxious and oppressed.'
'And I have vexed and disappointed him more!' exclaimed she.  'No
wonder he was angry, and ready to impute anything!  But he will believe
me, he will forgive me, he will take me home.'
'It is my belief,' said Fitzjocelyn, in his peculiar way, 'that the
worst injury you could do to James would be to give way to the spirit
that has possessed him.'
'But, Louis,' cried Clara, wildly astonished, 'I must go; I can't have
Jem saying these things of me.'
'His saying them does not make them true.'
'He is my brother.  He has the only right to me.  If I must choose
between him and my uncle, he must be mine--mine.'
'You have not to choose between him and your uncle.  You have to choose
between right and wrong, between his frenzy and his true good.'
'My brother! my brother!  I go with my brother!' was still her vehement
cry.  Without listening to her cousin's last words, she made a gesture
to put him aside, and rose to hurry to her brother.
But Louis stood before her, and spoke gravely.  'Very well.  Yield
yourself to his management.  Go back to be another burden upon a
household, poor enough already to sour him with cares.  Let him tell
your uncle that both his brother's children loathe the fruit of the
self-sacrifice of a lifetime.  Transgress your grandmother's wishes;
condemn that poor man to a desolate, objectless, covetous old age; make
the breach irreconcilable for ever; and will James be the better or the
happier for your allowing his evil temper the full swing?'
Clara wrung her hands.  'My uncle!  Yes, what shall I do with my uncle?
If I could only have them both?'
'This way you would have neither.  Keep the straight path, and you may
end in having both.'
'Straight--I don't know what straight is!  It must be right to cling to
my own brother in his noble poverty.  Oh! that he should imagine me
caring for this horrid, horrid state and grandeur!'
Louis recurred to the old argument, that James did not know what he was
saying, and recalled her to the remembrance of what she had felt to be
the right course before James's ebullition.  She owned it most
reluctantly; but oh! she said, would James still forgive her, and not
believe such dreadful things, but trust and be patient with her, and
perhaps Uncle Oliver might after all be set on going to Peru, and
beyond remonstrance.  Then it would all come right--no, not right, for
granny had dreaded his going.  Confused and distressed by the
conflicting claims, Clara was thankful for the present respite given to
her by Louis's promise that his father should sound her uncle as to his
wishes and intentions.  Lord Ormersfield's upright, unimpassioned
judgment appeared like a sort of refuge from the conflict of the
various claims, and he was besides in a degree, her guardian, being the
sole executor of the only will which Mrs. Frost had ever made, soon
after the orphans came under her charge, giving the Terrace to James,
and dividing the money in the Funds between the two.
Weeping, but not unhopeful--convinced, though not acknowledging
it--only praying for strength and patience, and hungering for one kind
word from James--Clara quitted that almost brother, in whose counsel he
had constrained her to seek relief, and went to her own chamber, there
to throw herself on the guidance of that Friend, who sticketh closer
than a brother.
The remaining part of the day passed quietly.  James did not
consciously make any difference in his manner, meaning to be still
affectionate, though disappointed, and pitying her mistake, both as to
her present happiness and future good.
Lord Ormersfield and Walter arrived in the evening, and James applied
himself to finding occupation for his brother-in-law, whom he kept out
of the way in the garden very satisfactorily.  The Earl was so softened
and sorrowful, that Clara hardly knew him.  He deeply felt the loss of
the kind, gentle aunt, whose sympathy had been more to him than he had
known at the time; the last remnant of the previous generation, the
last link with his youth, and he was even more grieved for the blank
she left with Louis than for himself.  By Louis's desire, he inquired
into Oliver's intentions.  'Must stay here,' was the answer.  'Can't
leave that child alone with the property.  I can look to the Equatorial
Company here--must do without me out there.  No, no, I can't leave the
girl to her brother; he'd teach her his own nasty, spiteful temper, and
waste the property on all those brats.  No, I'm fixed here; I must look
after Henry's child, fine girl, good-tempered girl; takes after Henry,
don't you think so?'
That Clara took after her father in anything but being tall and fair,
would hardly have been granted by any one who knew her better than the
Earl, but he readily allowed it, and Oliver proceeded:--'As long as she
does not marry, here I am; but I trust some one will soon take the care
of her off my hands--man who would look after the property well.  She's
a good girl too, and the finest figure in the whole county; lucky him
who gets her.  I shall be sorry to part with the child, too, but I
shall be working for her, and there's nothing left that cares a rush
for me now, so I might as well be out of the way of the young things.
I know the old place at Lima, and the place knows me; and what do I
care for this now my mother is gone?  If I could only see Clara safe
settled here, then I should care as little what became of me as I
suppose she would.'
The Earl was touched by the dreary, desponding tone of the reply, and
reported it to Louis and Clara with such terms, that Clara's decision
was made at once, namely, that it would be wrong and cruel to cast away
her uncle, and be swayed by James's prejudice; and Lord Ormersfield
told her with grave approval that she was quite right, and that he
hoped that James would recover from his unreasonable folly.
'Make Jem forgive me,' said Clara, faintly, as her announcement of her
purpose, when she finally sought her room, obliged to be thought meanly
of, rather than do ill, denying her fondest affections, cutting herself
off from all she loved, and, with but this consolation, that she was
doing as grandmamma would have bidden her. Oh, how her heart yearned
after home!
On the morrow, Clara sorrowed in her solitary chamber alone with
faithful Jane, who, amid her bursts of tears, felt the one
satisfaction, that her dear mistress had lived to be buried like the
stock she came of, and who counted the carriages and numbered the
scarfs, like so many additional tributes from the affection of her dear
Master Oliver.
Once on that day James was visibly startled from his heavy, stern mood
of compressed, indignant sorrow.  It was as he advanced to the entrance
of the vault, and his eye was struck by a new and very handsome tablet
on the wall.  It was to the father, mother, and young brother and
sisters, whose graves had been hastily made far away in the time of the
pestilence, the only Dynevors who did not lie in the tombs of their
fathers.  For one moment James moved nearer to his uncle.  Could he
have spoken then, what might not have followed? but it was impossible,
and the impulse passed away.
But he was kind when he hurried upstairs for a last embrace to Clara.
He still felt fondly, brotherly, and compassionate; and all the more,
because she had proved more weak against temptation than he had
expected.  His farewell was, 'Good-bye, my poor Clara, God bless you.'
'Oh, thank you!' cried Clara, from the bottom of her heart.  'You
forgive me, James?'
'I forgive; I am sorry for you, my poor child.  Mind, Dynevor Terrace
is still your home, if you do not find the happiness you expect in your
chosen lot.'
'Happiness!' but he had no time to hear.  He was gone, while she sobbed
out her message of love for Isabel, and Louis ran up, pale with
repressed suffering, and speaking with difficulty, as he wrung her
hand, and murmured, 'Oh, Clara! may we but abide patiently.'
After his good-bye, he turned back again to say, 'I'm selfish; but let
me put you in mind not to let the Lima correspondence drop.'
'Oh, no, no; you know I won't.'
'Thank you!  And let me leave you Mary's keynote of comfort, 'Commit
thy way unto the Lord, and He will bring it to pass.''
'Thank you,' said Clara, in her turn, and she was left alone.
CHAPTER XII.
THE FROST HOUSEHOLD.
The wind of late breathed gently forth,
Now shifted east, and east by north,
Bare trees and shrubs but ill, you know,
Could shelter them from rain or snow,
Stepping into their nests they paddled,
Themselves were chilled, their eggs were addled,
Soon every father bird and mother
Grew quarrelsome, and pecked each other.
Pairing Time Anticipated--COWPER.
Three weeks longer did the session drag on, but on the joyful day when
release was given, Lord Ormersfield was surprised to find Mr. Dynevor's
card upon his table, with an address at Farrance's hotel.
Louis alone was at leisure to repair thither.  He found Clara alone,
looking as if her grief were still very fresh, and, though striving to
speak gaily, the tears very near the surface.
'We are going abroad,' she said; 'Uncle Oliver thinks it a part of my
education, and declares he will not have me behind the Miss Brittons.
We are bound straight for Switzerland.'
'Lucky girl,' said Louis.
'I'm sure I don't care for it,' said Clara; 'mountains and pictures are
not a bit in my line, unless I had Isabel and you, Louis, to make me
care.'
'Learn, then,' said Louis; 'it shows that your education is defective.
Yes, I see,' he continued, as Clara signed heavily, 'but you don't know
the good it will do you to have your mind forcibly turned aside.'
'If I could only sit quiet in a corner,' said Clara.
'So you will, in many a corner of a railway carriage.'
She smiled a little.  'The truth is,' she said, 'that poor Uncle Oliver
cannot be quiet.  I can't see what pleasure Italy will be to him, but
he is too miserable at home.  I never saw such restless unhappiness!'
and her eyes filled with tears.  'Oh, Louis!  I am glad you would not
let me say anything about leaving him.  Sometimes when he bids me good
night, he puts his arm round me, and says so pitifully that I do not
care for him.  Do you know, I think mine is the little spar of love
that he tries to cling to in the great ship wreck; and I feel quite
sorry and hypocritical that it is such a poor, miserable shred.'
'It will grow,' said Louis, smiling.
'I don't know; he is terribly provoking sometimes--and without dear
granny to hinder the rubs.  O, Louis! it is true that there is no
bearing to stay at home in those great empty rooms!'
'And Jane?'
'Oh, she goes,' said Clara, recovering a smile; 'she is firmly
persuaded that we shall run into another revolution, and as she could
not frighten us by the description of your wounds, she decides to come
and dress ours when we get any.  Dear old Jenny, I am glad she goes;
she is the only creature I can talk to; but, Louis, before my uncle
comes in, I have something to give you.'
It was the letters that Mary had written to her aunt since the parting,
and the Spanish books which she had left in her charge.
'It is very kind in you, Clara,' said Louis, fervently.
They talked of Mary, and a little of James, from whom Clara had once
heard; but it had been a stiff letter, as if a barrier were between
them, and then Mr. Dynevor came in, and seemed pleased to find Louis
there; even asking him whether he could not join them on their tour,
and help Clara to speak French.
'No, thank you, sir,' said Louis, 'I am afraid my company brought no
good luck last time.'
'Never mind that--manage better now--ha, Clara.'
'It would be very nice; but he has a great deal too much to do at
home,' said Clara.
Oliver would not be persuaded that Fitzjocelyn would not meet them
abroad, and began magniloquently talking of his courier, and his route,
and while he was looking for the map, the two cousins smiled, and Clara
said,--'Lucky you to have work at home, and to stay with it.'
'Only I say, Clara, when you break down anywhere, send me a telegraph.'
'No such good luck,' sighed Clara.
'So he won't come,' said her uncle, when he was gone; 'but we shall
have him following us yet--Ha! ha!  Never mind, Clara.'
Clara laughed.  She knew what her uncle meant, but the notion was to
her too impossible and ridiculous even to need a blush.  She did not
think the world contained Louis's equal; but she had always known that
his love was disposed of, and she no more thought of wishing for it
than for any other impossible thing.  His affection for Mary gave her
no more pain than did that of James for Isabel; and she would have
treated with scorn and anger anything that impeached his constancy.
The pleasure with which he received Mary's letters was the single
satisfaction that she carried away with her.
And so she was borne away, and her sad heart could not choose but be
somewhat enlivened by change and novelty, while her uncle made it his
business to show her everything as rapidly as it could be seen,
apparently with no relish himself for aught but perpetual movement.
So passed the autumn with Clara.  It was not much brighter at Dynevor
Terrace.  Clara, being still under age, had it not in her power to
resign her half of her grandmother's income, even if her brother would
have accepted it; and 70 pounds made a difference in such an income as
James's, more especially as his innovations did not tend to fill the
school.
Murmurs were going about that Mr. Frost was severe, or that he was
partial.  Some censured his old opinions, others his new studies; one
had been affronted by being almost told his boy was a dunce, another
hated all this new-fangled nonsense.  The ladies were all, to a woman,
up against his wife, her airs, her poverty, her twins, and her
housekeeping; and seldom spoke of her save to contrast her with good
old Mrs. Frost.  And then it was plain that something was wrong between
him and his uncle, and no one could believe but that his temper had
been the cause.  The good Miss Faithfulls struggled in vain to silence
scandal, and keep it from 'coming round;' and luckily Isabel was the
last person likely either to hear or resent.
The boys met with decreased numbers after the holidays; and James
received them with undiminished energy, but with failing patience, and
a temper not improved by the late transactions at Cheveleigh, and
fretted, as Louis had divined, by home cares.
Of all living women, Isabel was one of the least formed by habits or
education to be an economical housewife and the mother of twins.
Maternal love did not develop into unwearied delight in infant
companionship, nor exclusive interest in baby smiles; and while she had
great visions for the future education of her little maidens, she was
not desirous to prolong the time spent in their society, but in general
preferred peace and Sir Hubert.  On the other hand, James was an
unusually caressing father.  After hours among rough inattentive boys,
nothing rested him so much as to fondle those tender creatures; his
eldest girl knew him, and was in ecstasy whenever he approached; and
the little pair of babies, by their mere soft helplessness, gave him an
indescribable sense of fondness and refreshment.  His little ones were
all the world to him, and he could not see how a pattern mother should
ever be so happy as with them around her.  He forgot the difference
between the pastime of an hour and the employment of a day.  The need
of such care on her part was the greater since the nursery
establishment was deficient.  The grand nurse had almost abdicated on
the double addition to her charge, and had only been bribed to stay by
an ill-spared increase in wages, and a share in an underling, who was
also to help Charlotte in her housemaid's department.  Nevertheless,
the nurse was always complaining; the children, though healthy, always
crying, and their father always certain it was somebody's fault.  Nor
did the family expenses diminish, retrench his own indulgences as he
might.  It was the mistress's eye that was wanting, and Isabel did not
know how to use it.  The few domestic cares that she perceived to be
her duty were gone through as weary tasks, and her mind continued
involved in her own romantic world, where she was oblivious of all that
was troublesome or vexatious.  Now and then she was aware of a sluggish
dulness that seemed to be creeping over her higher aspirations--a want
of glow and feeling on religious subjects, even in the most sacred
moments; and she wondered and grieved at a condition, such as she had
never experienced in what she had thought far more untoward
circumstances.  She did not see the difference between doing her best
when her will was thwarted, and her present life of neglect and
indulgence.  Nothing roused her; she did not perceive omissions that
would have fretted women of housewifely instincts, and her soft dignity
and smooth temper felt few annoyances; and though James could sometimes
be petulant, he was always withheld from reproving her both by his
enthusiastic fondness, and his sense that for him she had quitted her
natural station of ease and prosperity.
On a dark hazy November afternoon, when the boys had been unusually
obtuse and mischievous, and James, worn-out, wearied, and uncertain
whether his cuts had alighted on the most guilty heads, strode home
with his arm full of Latin exercises, launched them into the study, and
was running up to the drawing-room, when he almost fell over Charlotte,
who was scouring the stairs.
She gave a little start and scream, and stood up to let him pass.  He
was about to rebuke her for doing such work at such an hour; but he saw
her flushed, panting, and evidently very tired, and his wrath was
averted.  Hurrying on to the drawing-room, he found Isabel eagerly
writing.  She looked up with a pretty smile of greeting; but he only
ran his hand through his already disordered hair, and exclaimed--
'Our stairs are like the Captain of Knockdunder's.  You never know they
are cleaned, except by tumbling over the bucket and the maid.'
'Are they being done?' said Isabel, quietly.  'I suppose the maids were
busy this morning.'
'And Charlotte, too!  She looks half dead.  I thought Ellen was to do
such work, and ought to have done it in proper time.'
'Little Catharine is so fretful, that Ellen cannot be spared from the
nursery.'
'I suppose she might be, if you were not absorbed in that writing.'
'I had the children with me, while the servants were at dinner; but
Kitty was so troublesome, that I could not keep her.  I am particularly
anxious to finish this.'
'Some people would think a sick child more engrossing than that--' He
had very nearly said trash, but he broke off short.
'There is nothing really the matter with her,' began Isabel,
composedly; but James did not wait to listen, and muttering, 'That girl
will be killed if she goes on,' he ran up to the nursery, whence he
already heard a sound of low fretting.
The child was sitting on the nurse's lap, with a hot red spot on one
cheek, teased and disturbed by the noises that the lesser ones were
constantly making, as one lay in her cot, and the other was carried
about by the girl.  As he entered, she shrieked joyously, and stretched
out her arms, and Kitty was at once clinging, hugging round his neck.
Sending Ellen down to finish the stairs, he carried off the little
girl, fondling and talking to her, and happy in her perfect content.
But he did not go to the drawing-room.  'No, no, mamma must not be
interrupted,' he bitterly thought, as he carried her down to the
fireless study, hung his plaid round himself and her, and walked up and
down the room with her, amusing her till she fell into a slumber on his
shoulder.
Isabel could not at once resume her pen.  Her even temper was for once
ruffled, and her bosom swelled at the thought that his reproach was
unjust; she was willing to do what was fitting, and he ought not to
expect her to be an absolute nursery-maid.  Women must keep up the tone
of their own minds, and she might be being useful to the world as well
as to her own family.  If he wanted a mere household drudge, why had he
not looked elsewhere?  Up went her queenly head, as she believed her
powers were meant for other things; but her heart gave a painful throb
at the recollection that poverty had been her voluntary choice, and had
seemed perfect felicity with James.  Alas! she loved, honoured, and
admired him, as her upright, unselfish, uncompromising husband, but
worries, and rebukes, and tart answers, had made many a rent in the
veil in which her fancy had enfolded him.  Sir Roland had disappeared,
and James and Sir Hubert were falling farther and farther asunder.
And Isabel sighed, partly at the memory of the imaginary being for whom
she had taken James, and partly at the future prospect, the narrow
sphere, the choice between solitude and dull society, the homely toils
that must increase, worn-out garments, perpetual alphabets, children
always whining, and James always irritated, thinking her remiss, and
coming in with that furrow on his forehead, and his hair standing up
wildly.  She shrank from the contemplation, took her letter-case on her
knee, moved close to the fire to profit by the light, stirred up a
clear flame, and proceeded with the benevolent hermit, who came to the
rescue when Sir Hubert was at the last gasp, and Adeline had received
his beautiful resigned words. The hermit had transported him into his
hut, and comforted Adeline, and was beginning a consolatory harangue,
making revelations that were to set everything right, when just as he
had gone as far as 'My son, know that I did not always wear this
amice,' there was a tap at the door, and she saw Fitzjocelyn, who had
been at Oakstead for the last few weeks, attending to some matters
connected with his constituency.
'Ah! is it you?' she said, her lap too full of papers for her to rise.
'I did not know you were come home.'
'I came yesterday; and what company do you think I had in the train as
far as Estminster?'
'Ah, I can guess! How does Louisa look?'
'Rather languid; but Estminster is to work wonders.  She declares that
Northwold is her best cure, and I am speculating whether she will
prevail.  I think Lady Conway dreads your example.'
'Mamma does not allow for the force of imagination,' said Isabel, not
exactly knowing what prompted either the words or the sigh.
'I am come to ask if you will kindly give me a dinner.  My father is
gone to the book-club meeting, so I thought we would try to revive old
times,' he said, smiling, but sadly, for the present scene was little
like the No. 5 of old times.
'We shall be delighted,' said Isabel, with alacrity, relieved at
avoiding a tete-it-tete with her husband at present, and refreshed by
the sight of one belonging to her former life, and external to her
present round of monotonous detail.  'Fortunately, it is not a lecture
night and James will be very glad.'
I suppose he is not come in from school?'
'Yea, he is.  I think he is in the study.  I will let him know,' she
said, with her hand on the bell.
'I will go to him,' said Louis, departing out of consideration that she
might wish for space to attend to dinner, room, and dress.  The two
last were scarcely in such a state as he had been used to see at No. 5:
books were on the sofa, the table-cover hung awry; the Dresden
Shepherd's hat was grimed, and his damsel's sprigged gown hemmed with
dust; there were no flowers in the vases, which his aunt had never left
unsupplied; and Isabel, though she could not be otherwise than handsome
and refined, had her crape rumpled, and the heavy folds of her dark
hair looking quite ready for the evening toilette; and, as she sat on
her low seat by the fire, the whole had an indescribable air of comfort
passing into listless indulgence.
Fitzjocelyn politely apologized to Ellen for a second time stepping
over her soapy deluge, and, as he opened the study door with a
preliminary knock, a voice, as sharp and petulant as it was low, called
out, 'Hollo!  Be quiet there, can't you!  You've no business here yet,
and I have no time to waste on your idleness.'
'I am sorry to hear it,' said Louis, advancing into the dim light of
the single bed-room candle, which only served to make visible the
dusky, unshuttered windows, and the black gulf of empty grate.  James
was sitting by the table, with his child wrapped in the plaid, asleep
on his breast, and his disengaged hand employed in correcting
exercises.  Without moving, he held it out, purple and chilled,
exclaiming, 'Ha! Fitzjocelyn, I took you for that lout of a Garett.'
'Is this an average specimen of your reception of your scholars?'
'I was afraid of his waking the child.  She has been unwell all day,
and I have scarcely persuaded her to go to sleep.'
'Emulating Hooker.'
'As little in patience as in judgment,' sighed James.
'And which of them is it who is lulled by the strains of 'As in
proesenti?''
'Which?' said James, somewhat affronted.  'Can't you tell sixteen
months from five?'
'I beg her pardon; but I can't construct a whole child from an inch of
mottled leg--as Professor Owen would a megalosaurus from a tooth. Does
she walk?'
'Poor child, she must!' said James.  'She thinks it very hard to have
two sisters so little younger than herself,' and he peeped under the
plaid at the little brown head, and drew it closer round, with a look
of almost melancholy tenderness, guarding carefully against touching
her with his cold hands.
'She will think it all the better by-and-by,' said Louis.
'You had better not stay here in the cold.  I'll come when I have heard
that boy's imposition and looked over these exercises.'  And he ran his
hand through his hair again.
'Don't!  You look like enough to a lion looking out of a bush to
frighten ten boys already,' said Louis.  'I'll do the exercises,'
pulling the copy-books away.
'What, you don't trust me?' as James detained them.
'No, I don't,' said James, his cousin's brightness awakening his
livelier manner.  'It needs an apprenticeship to be up to their
blunders.'
'Let me read them to you.  I gave notice to Isabel that I am come to
dinner, and no doubt she had rather I were disposed of.'
James objected no farther, and the dry labour was illuminated by the
discursive remarks and moralizings which Louis allowed to flow in their
natural idle course, both to divert his dispirited cousin, and to
conceal from himself how much cause there was for depression. When the
victim of the imposition approached, Louis prevented the dreaded clumsy
entrance, seized on a Virgil, and himself heard the fifty lines,
scarcely making them serve their purpose as a punishment, but sending
the culprit away in an unusually amiable temper.
Services from Louis were too natural to James to be requited with
thanks; but he was not uncivil in his notice of a wrong tense that had
been allowed to pass, and the question was argued with an eagerness
which showed that he was much enlivened.  On the principle that Louis
must care for all that was his, as he rose to take the still-sleeping
child upstairs, he insisted that his cousin should come with him, if
only for the curiosity of looking at the other two little animals, and
learning the difference between them and Kitty, at whom he still looked
as if her godfather had insulted her.
It was pretty to see his tenderness, as he detached the little girl
from her hold, and laid her in the cot, making a little murmuring
sound; and boasted how she would have shown off if awake, and laughed
over her droll little jealousies of his even touching the twins.  As
she was asleep, he might venture; and it was comical to hear him
declaring that no one need mistake them for each other, and to see him
trying to lay them side by side on his knees to be compared, when they
would roll over, and interlace their little scratching fingers; and
Louis stood by teasing him, and making him defend their beauty in terms
that became extravagant.  He was really happy here; the careworn look
smoothed away, the sharpness left his tones, and there was nothing but
joyous exultation and fondness in his whole manner.
The smile did not last long, for Louis was well-nigh thrown downstairs
by a dustpan in a dark corner, and James was heard muttering that
nothing in that house was ever in its right place; and while Louis was
suggesting that it was only himself who was not in the right place,
they entered the drawing-room, which, like the lady, was in the same
condition as that in which he had left it.  Since Isabel had lost
Marianne and other appliances, she had thought it not worth while to
dress for dinner; so nothing had happened, except that the hermit had
proved to be Adeline's great uncle, and had begun to clear up the
affair of the sacrilege.
He was reluctant to leave off when the gentlemen appeared; but Isabel
shut him up, and quietly held out the portfolio to James, who put it on
the side-table, and began to clear the books away and restore some sort
of order; but it was a task beyond his efforts.
Dinner was announced by Charlotte, as usual, all neat grace and
simplicity, in her black dress and white apron, but flushed and heated
by exertions beyond her strength.  All that depended on her had been
well done; but it would not seem to have occurred to her mistress that
three people ate more than two; and to Louis, who had been too busy to
take any luncheon, the two dishes seemed alarmingly small.  One was of
haricot mutton, the other of potatoes; and Charlotte might be seen to
blush as she carried Lord Fitzjocelyn the plate containing a chop
resembling Indian rubber, decorated with grease and with two balls of
nearly raw carrot, and followed it up with potatoes apparently all
bruises.
Louis talked vigorously of Virginia and Louisa--secretly marvelling how
his hosts had brought themselves down to such fare.  Isabel was dining
without apparently seeing anything amiss, and James attempted nothing
but a despairing toss of his chin, as he pronounced the carrots
underdone.  After the first course there was a long interval, during
which Isabel and Louis composedly talked about the public meeting which
he had been attending, and James fidgetted in the nervousness of
hardly-restrained displeasure; but suddenly a frightful shrieking
arose, and he indignantly cried, 'That girl!'
'Poor Charlotte in her hysterics again,' said Isabel, moving off,
quickly for her, with the purple scent-bottle at her chatelaine.
'Isabel makes her twice as bad,' exclaimed James; 'to pet her with
eau-de-Cologne is mere nonsense.  Some day I shall throw a bucket of
cold water over her.'
Isabel had left the door open, and they heard her softly comforting
Charlotte with 'Never mind,' and 'Lord Fitzjocelyn would not care,'
till the storm lulled.  Charlotte crept off to her room, and Isabel
returned to the dinner-table.
'Well, what's the matter now?' said James.
'Poor Charlotte!' said Isabel, smiling; 'it seems that she trusted to
making a grand appearance with the remains of yesterday's pudding, and
that she was quite overset by the discovery that Ellen and Miss
Catharine had been marauding on them.'
'You don't mean that Kitty has been eating that heavy pudding at this
time of night?' cried James.
'Kitty eats everything,' was the placid answer, 'and I do not think we
can blame Ellen, for she often comes down after our dinner to find
something for the nursery supper.'
'Things go on in the most extraordinary manner,' muttered James.
'I suppose Charlotte misses Jane,' said Louis.  'She looks ill.'
'No wonder,' said James, 'she is not strong enough for such work. She
has no method, and yet she is the only person who ever thinks of doing
a thing properly.  I wish your friend Madison would come home and take
her off our hands, for she is always alternating between fits of
novel-reading and of remorse, in which she nearly works herself to
death with running after lost time.'
'I should be sorry to part with her,' said Isabel; 'she is so quiet,
and so fond of the children.'
'She will break down some day,' said James; 'if not before, certainly
when she hears that Madison has a Peruvian wife.'
'There is no more to come,' said Isabel, rising; 'shall we come
upstairs?'
James took up the candles, and Louis followed, considerably hungry, and
for once provoked by Isabel's serene certainty that nobody cared
whether there were anything to eat.  However, he had forgotten all by
the time he came upstairs, and began to deliver a message from Lady
Conway, that she was going to write in a day or two to beg for a visit
from Isabel during her sojourn at Estminster, a watering-place about
thirty miles distant.  Isabel's face lighted with pleasure. 'I could
go?' she said, eagerly turning towards James.
'Oh, yes, if you wish it,' he answered, gruffly, as if vexed at her
gratification.
'I mean, of course, if you can spare me,' she said, with an air of more
reserve.
'If you wish it, go by all means.  I hope you will.'
'The Christmas holidays are so near, that we may both go,' said Isabel;
but James still had not recovered his equanimity, and Louis thought it
best to begin talking of other things; and, turning to James, launched
into the results of his Inglewood crops, and the grand draining plan
which was to afford Marksedge work for the winter, and in which his
father had become much interested.  But he did not find that ready heed
to all that occupied him of which he used to be certain at the Terrace.
Isabel cared not at all for farming, and took no part in 'mere country
squire's talk;' and James was too much overburthened with troubles and
anxieties to enter warmly into those of others.  Of those to whom
Louis's concerns had been as their own, one had been taken from him,
the other two were far away; and the cold 'yes,' 'very good,' fell
coldly on his ear.
The conversation reverted to the school; and here it appeared that two
years' experience had taken away the freshness of novelty, and the
cycle of disappointment had begun.  More boys were quitting the school
than the new-comers could balance; and James spoke with acute vexation
of the impracticability of the boys, and the folly of the parents.  The
attendance at his evening lectures had fallen off; and he declared that
there was a spirit of opposition to whatever he did. The boys
disobeyed, knowing that they should be favoured at home, and if they
were punished, the parents talked of complaints to the trustees.  The
Sunday teaching was treated as especially obnoxious: the genteel
mothers talked ridiculously about its resembling a charity-school, the
fathers did not care whether their sons went or not, and he had
scarcely five boys who appeared there regularly, and of them one was
the butcher's son, who came rather in spite of his parents than with
their consent.  Attendance at church was more slack than ever; and when
he lectured the defaulters, and gave them additional tasks in the week,
it was resented as an injustice.  To crown all, Mr. Ramsbotham had
called, and had been extremely insolent about a boy whose ears had been
boxed for reading Pickwick in school, under cover of his Latin grammar,
and Isabel was almost indignant with Miss Faithfull for having ventured
to hint to her that she wished Mr. Frost would be a little more gentle
with the boys.
Isabel was fully alive now, and almost as vehement as her husband, in
her complaints against his many foes.  There was no lack of sympathy
here, indeed, there might be rather too much, for she did not afford
the softening influence that James had hitherto found at home.
'Well, Jem,' said Louis, at last, 'I think you should keep your hands
off the boys.'
'You are not bitten with the nonsense about personal dignity and
corporal punishment?' said James.
'By no means.  I have an infinite respect for the great institution of
flogging; but a solemn execution is one thing, a random stroke another.'
'Theories are very good things till you come to manage two score dunces
without sense or honour.  There is only one sort of appeal to their
feelings that tells.'
'Maybe so, but I have my doubts whether you are the man to make it.'
Louis was sorry he had so spoken, for a flush of pain came up in
James's face at the remembrance of what Fitzjocelyn had long ago
forgotten--a passionate blow given to deter him from a piece of wilful
mischief, in which he was persisting for the mere amusement of
provoking.  It stood out among all other varieties of cuff, stroke, and
knock, by the traces it had left, by Mrs. Frost's grief at it, and the
forgiveness from the Earl, and it had been the most humiliating
distress of James's childhood.  It humbled him even now, and he
answered--
'You may be right, Louis; I may be not sufficiently altered since I was
a boy.  I have struck harder than I intended more than once, and I have
told the boys so.'
'I am sure, if they had any generosity, they would have been touched
with your amends,' cried Isabel.
'After all, a schoolmaster's life does not tend to mend the temper,'
concluded James, sighing, and passing his hand over his forehead.
'No,' thought Louis, 'nor does Isabel's mutton!'
CHAPTER XIII.
THE CONWAY HOUSEHOLD.
And ye shall walk in silk attire,
And siller hae to spare,
Gin ye'll consent to be his bride,
Nor think of Donald mair.
Miss BLAMIRE.
What makes you so lame to-day?' asked Lord Ormersfield, as Louis
crossed the library, on returning from an interview to which he had
been summoned in another room.
'I only stumbled over an obstruction on the Frost staircase yesterday,'
said Louis. 'Poor Jem chose to have me up to the nursery; and to see
him in the paternal character is the funniest as well as the
pleasantest spectacle the house affords.'
'Ah! it is not what it was,' said the Earl.  'I suppose I must call
there before the holidays, though,' he added, reluctantly.  'But what
did that man, Ramsbotham, want with you?'
'To ask our interest for that appointment for his friend Grant.'
'Indeed! what could bring him here?'
'Why, unluckily, he fancied he had some claim on me, on the score of
Jem Frost's election.  I was too innocent then to know what those
things go for.'
'You may say so!' ejaculated the Earl.  'So he was insolent enough to
bring that up, was he?'
'Worse,' said Fitzjocelyn; 'he wanted to threaten that, unless I would
oblige him now, there were matters which it was his duty to lay before
the trustees.  I told him he would do, of course, whatever was his
duty; whereupon he thought my Lordship was interested in Mr. Frost.'
'Intolerably impertinent!  I hope you set him down!'
'I told him that neither Mr. Frost nor I should wish him to pretermit
his duty on any consideration whatever.  Then he harked back to what he
did for us at the election; and I was forced to tell him that if he
considered that he had thereby established a claim on me, I must own
myself in his debt; but as to reciprocating it, by putting in a person
like Grant, that was against my conscience.  He flew into a passion,
informed me that Mr. Frost would take the consequences, mounted the
British Lion, and I bowed him out upon that majestic quadruped, talking
grandly of illiberal prejudices and the rising generation.'
'You acknowledged that he had a claim on you?'
'As things go in this world, I suppose it is true.'
'Louis! you will never know how to deal with those people.'
'I am afraid not.  I could not, either boldly or diplomatically, get
rid of the charge; so there was nothing for it but to confess. That's
not the worst of it.  I am afraid he really will be able to take
revenge on poor Jem, and I'm sure he can't afford to lose any more
scholars.'
'Such a fellow as that will not have much in his power against James,'
said Lord Ormersfield.  'What I am afraid of is, that you have cut the
ground from under your feet.  I cannot see how you are ever to stand
for Northwold.'
'Nor I,' said Louis.  'In fact, father, I have always thought it most
wonderfully kind forbearance that you never reproached me more for my
doings on that occasion.  I believe we were all too happy,' he
presently added, with a sigh, which was re-echoed by his father, at the
same time trying to say something about youthfulness, to which Louis,
who had been leaning thoughtfully on the mantelpiece, presently
answered--'How much wiser old people are than young!  An original
axiom, is not it? but it is the last which one learns!'
'You would hardly act in the same way now?' said his father.
'I wonder when it ever answers to interfere with the natural course of
events!' responded Louis, musingly.  'There were two things that Mr.
Calcott told me once upon a time.'  Those two things he left unuttered.
They were--that the gentleman would be wasted on the school, and that
the lady was not made for a poor man's wife.  No wonder they made him
sigh, but he concluded by exclaiming aloud--
'Well, I hope they will both go to Estminster, and come back with fresh
life!'
The Estminster invitation was already on the road; but, unfortunately,
Lady Conway had been unable to secure lodgings large enough to receive
the children.  She was urgent, however, that Isabel should come as soon
as possible, since Louisa had been more unwell than usual, and was
pining for her eldest sister; and she hoped that James would join her
there as soon as the holidays should set him free.
James was hurt to find Isabel so much delighted to go, but resolved
that she should not be deprived of the pleasure, and petulantly denied
the offers, which became even entreaties, that she might wait till he
could accompany her.  He arranged, therefore, that he should follow her
in a fortnight's time, the Miss Faithfulls undertaking the charge of
their small namesakes; and Lady Conway wrote to fix a day when Delaford
should come to take care of Isabel on her journey.
James and Isabel laughed at this measure.  Mrs. James Frost was
certainly not in circumstances to carry such a hero of the buttery in
her suite; and Lady Conway herself had more sense than to have proposed
it, but for Delaford's own representations.  In fact, there was a
pretty face at Dynevor Terrace, and he had been piqued enough by the
return of his letters to be resolved on re-establishing his influence.
Therefore did he demonstrate to my Lady that the only appropriate
trains would bring him to Northwold at seven in the evening, and take
him and Mrs. James Frost Dynevor away at eleven next morning; and
therefore did Isabel look up in a sudden fit of recollection, as the
breakfast was being removed, and say, 'Charlotte, Delaford is coming on
Tuesday to fetch me to Estminster, and will sleep here that night.'
Isabel little guessed that in the days when she viewed the fantastic
Viscount as her greatest enemy, the announcement of his approach would
have been far less appalling to her.
'The wretch! the traitor! the vile deceiver!' thought Charlotte, not
chary of her epithets, and almost ready to wreak her vengeance on the
silver spoons.  'He has gone and broken poor Marianne's heart, and now
he wants to treat me the same, and make me faithless to poor Tom, that
is up in the mountain-tops and trusts to me!  O me, what shall I do?
Mrs. Beckett is gone, and there's no one to give me an advice! If I
speak to him or scorn him, he'll take his advantage all alike--and his
words are so fine and so soft, that do what I will to hate him when I'm
away, he is sure to wind round me when he's there; and I can't get
away, and I'm a poor, lonely, fatherless and motherless orphan, and a
vain girl, that has listened already to his treacherous suit more than
poor Tom would think for.'
Charlotte worked on in much grief and perplexity for some minutes,
revolving the vanity that had led to her follies, and humbling herself
in her own eyes.  Suddenly, a flash of thought crossed her, and woke a
smile upon her face, almost a look of mischief.  She tied on a clean
apron, and running upstairs, opened the drawing-room door, and said,
'If you please, ma'am, might I ask Miss Faithfull's Martha to tea on
Tuesday night?'
'Oh yes, if you like,' said Isabel, never raising her eyes from the
rebuilding of the ruined chapel in the valley.
Away skipped Charlotte, and in two minutes was at the back door of the
House Beautiful.  Mrs. Martha had been grimly kind to her ever since
she had been afflicted with the cook for a fellow-servant, and received
her only with a reproof for coming gadding out, when she ought to be
hard at work; but when she heard the invitation, she became
wrathful--she had rather go ten miles out of her way than even look at
'that there Ford.'
But Charlotte explained her purpose, and implored, and put her in mind
that Mrs. Beckett was gone, and she had no protector; and Martha
relented, told her that if she had minded her she would never have been
in the scrape at all, but agreed, not without satisfaction, to afford
Mr. Delaford the society of his old acquaintance.
And so when Mr. Delaford, with his whiskers freshly curled and his
boots in a state of fascinating polish, walked up Dynevor Terrace, the
door was opened by Ellen, and the red-faced cook and the upright Mrs.
Martha sat on either side the fire.  Daintily did he greet them, and
stand warming himself before the fire, adapting his conversation to
them for the next ten minutes, before he ventured to ask whether Miss
Arnold were still an inmate.  'Taking out dinner--taking in tea,'
gruffly replied Martha.
Mr. Delaford waited, but Ellen only ran in for one moment to fetch the
kettle, and Martha discoursed as usual on the gold mines in Peru.
By-and-by, when the parlour tea could by no possibility be supposed to
be farther prolonged, there swept into the kitchen the stately nurse.
Charlotte had run up to the nursery, and begged as a favour that she
might be left to watch the children, while Mrs. Nurse entertained Mr.
Delaford below-stairs; and in pity to so grand a gentleman, constrained
to mix with such 'low servants,' the nurse had yielded, and Charlotte
sat safe and sound by the nursery fire, smiling at his discomfiture,
and reading over Tom's letters with an easier conscience than for many
a day.
Mr. Delaford was too much of a gentleman to be uncivil to the three
dames by the kitchen fire, but he watched every step and every creaking
door.  He even went the length of coming up to family prayers, in hopes
of there meeting Charlotte; but she only joined the procession at the
parlour door, and had flown upstairs, like a little bird, before he was
out again.
The gentleman was affronted, and resolved to make her feel it.  They
could not but meet at the kitchen breakfast, and he barely acknowledged
her.  This was the most trying stroke of all, for it set her, in the
eyes of the cook and nurse, on a level with the inferior servants, to
whom he would not have deigned a look, and it was not easy to resist
showing that she was on more familiar terms with him than all.  But the
instinct of self-protection and the wisdom of sincerity came to her
aid.  She abstained from raising her eyes to his face, from one
conscious word or glance; she locked herself into her pantry when she
took down the breakfast-things, and avoided every encounter, even when
she had begun to feel that it would have been more flattering had he
made more efforts.  At last, dire necessity obliged her to accept his
aid in carrying her mistress's box down the stairs.  He walked
backwards, she forwards.  She would not meet his eye, and he was too
well-bred for one word on the stairs; but in the garden he exclaimed,
'Miss Arnold, what have I done?'
'I never ought to have listened to you,' said Charlotte.  'It was not
right by neither of us; so please say no more.'
'If you could understand--'
'I don't want to understand nothing.'
Charlotte drove him on with the box till they were close to the fly,
and then, leaving him and the man to adjust the packing, flew back to
announce that all was ready for her mistress.  The last kisses were
given to the children, and a message left with Charlotte for her
master, who was in school; then she stood with Miss Catharine in her
arms, and saw the fly drive off.
'Well,' said Mrs. Cook, 'that butler thinks himself a great beau, no
doubt!  I asked him whether he thought you pretty, Charlotte, and he
said you hadn't no air nor no complexion.  It's as I tells you--nobody
will never take no notice of you while you goes about so dowdy.'
Charlotte did not know whether she was glad that the cook could not
tease her about Delaford, or mortified to be supposed beneath his
notice.  No air, forsooth!  She who had often heard it said that she
looked like any lady!
'But oh,' said Charlotte to herself, as she spent her daily five
minutes at noonday in quiet thought, 'am I not a poor silly thing not
to be thankful that care has been round me this time, and that I have
not been let to do nothing giddy nor false by Tom, whatever I may have
thought!'
Meanwhile, Isabel had found it much harder to part with her babies for
three weeks than it had seemed at the first proposal; and there were
tears in her eyes as she gazed at the peaked, red-tiled roof of the old
grammar-school, and reckoned the days and hours before her husband
would join her.
Other associations revived when she found herself at Estminster, and
was received with shrieks of joy, caresses, and exclamations too fond
and foolish to bear repetition; and then the pale Louisa rested against
her, stroking her hand, and Lady Conway fondled her, and Virginia,
looking formed and handsome, retreated a little way to study her and
declare that she was the same Isabel, neither altered nor grown
older--it was all a dream that she had ever left them.
She almost felt it so herself, so entirely did she fit into the old
habits, the little quiet dinner (only it seemed unusually good), the
subsequent closing round the fire with the addition of Miss King and
Louisa, the easy desultory chat, the books with Mudie's stamp lying
about, the music which must be practised.  It was very like being Miss
Conway still; and when she awoke the next morning to find it late, and
to the impulse of hurrying up, or not hurrying, expecting to find
James making breakfast himself, and cross at being made late for
school, she turned on her pillow, half doubting whether she had dreamt
these two years in one long night, and remembering that captive
mermaid, who had but to resume her maritime headgear and return to her
native element, to forget the very existence of her fisherman husband
and children.  No! Isabel was not come to that! but she was almost
ashamed to enjoy her extra hour's repose; and then the leisurely
breakfast--nay, even the hot rolls and clear coffee were appreciated;
and she sighed as she called up the image of the breakfast over an hour
ago, the grim kettle, the bad butter, the worse fire, and James, cold
and hurried, with Kitty on his knee gnawing a lump of crust.  It was a
contrast to Lady Conway reading her letters and discussing engagements
with comfortable complacency, and Virginia making suggestions, and
Louisa's grave bright eyes consulting hers, and Miss King quietly
putting in a remark, and the anticipation of Walter's return, as if he
were the only person wanting.
The sisters always resented their mother's habit of talking of 'poor
Isabel,' regarding her as the happiest of women; and they were
confirmed in their belief by seeing her looking exceedingly well and
handsome, with perhaps a little more dignity and a sweeter smile.
Virginia loved to snatch private interviews with Miss King, to express
her confidence in dear Isabel's felicity, in the infallibility and
other perfections of James, and in the surpassing cleverness of little
Catharine; and Louisa was always sighing to behold the twins.  But, to
the delight of the school-room, the chapel in the valley was produced
in a complete form, and a very pretty romance it was; but the hermit
and the brilliant denouement were quite a shock to the young ladies,
just when their tears were prepared, and Virginia was almost angry.
'Oh, my dear, there is trouble enough in the world!' said Isabel;
'Hubert and Adeline have been my companions so long, that at least I
must leave them happy.'
'Indeed,' said Miss King, 'I am almost surprised that you have been
able to finish them at all, with so much re-writing.'
To her surprise, Isabel blushed, and her answer partook of
self-defence.  'James is so busy, and the children so young, that this
has been my great resource.  When my little girls are older, I must
begin educating in earnest.  I want to talk over Madame Neckar's book
with you, Miss King.'
'All systems begin alike from infant obedience, I believe,' said the
governess.
'Yes,' said Isabel, 'little Catharine is obedience itself with us. It
is curious to see how well she knows the difference between us and the
nurses.  There are great tempests upstairs, and her papa takes them
very much to heart.  He always has her downstairs when he is at home;
and he has accustomed her to so much attention, that there is no doing
anything while she is by, or I would have her more with me.'
The self-justifying tone rather puzzled Miss King.  She noted likewise
that Isabel was backward in entering into details of her home life, and
that she never said a word to encourage her sister's wishes to visit
her at Northwold.  Knowing Isabel as the governess did, she was sure
that she would not merely talk of things on the surface, if her spirit
were fully content.  Only once did she go any deeper, and that was as
she took up a little book of religious poetry of which she had been
very fond.  'Ah!' she said, 'I don't feel these things as I used.  I
think practical life dulls one.'
'I should have said, practical life made things real,' said Miss King.
Isabel had not found out that having duties and not doing them was less
practical than having no particular task.
Another cloud of mystery was over the relations with Mr. Dynevor and
Clara.  Isabel baffled all Lady Conway's inquiries and advice by
entering into no particulars, but adhering to her own version of the
matter, 'that Mr. Dynevor had required of James conditions incompatible
with his duty,' and not deigning to explain either duty or conditions,
as beyond the capacity of her hearer.
Of Clara no account was vouchsafed, except that Isabel believed she was
abroad; 'they had been very much disappointed in her,' and Isabel was
afraid that she was a good deal altered; and the subject seemed so
painful, that Virginia did not venture to push her inquiries any
farther.
The great subject of interest in the Conway family was that Virginia
and Louisa were going to lose their maid; and the suggestion somehow
arose that Charlotte should be her successor.  It was agreed on all
hands that nature had formed her for a lady's-maid, and a few lessons
from a hairdresser would make her perfection; and she would be
invaluable in reading to Louisa when restless and unable to sleep.
Isabel gave herself credit for the most notable arrangement she had
ever made--promoting the little maiden, whom she really liked, and
relieving herself from the constant annoyance about sparing Ellen from
the nursery by obtaining a stronger housemaid.  She had only a few
scruples, or rather she knew that James would have some, as to exposing
Charlotte to Delaford's attentions after what she had heard in Clara's
letter; but the least hint on this score led to a panegyric upon
Delaford's perfections--his steadiness, his prudence, his cleverness on
journeys, his usefulness in taking care of Walter. 'I know that Walter
is safe when he is with Delaford,' said Lady Conway.  And even the
sensible Miss King observed, smiling, 'that there always would be
nonsense between men and maidservants; and there were many more
dangerous places than the present.  She would watch over Charlotte, and
Fanshawe was quite to be trusted.'
The Conway family knew rather less about their own servants' hall than
they did of feudal establishments five hundred years ago.
Still, Isabel, in her superior prudence, resolved to consult Fanshawe
on the true state of affairs.  Fanshawe was a comfortable portly
personage, chiefly absorbed in her caps and her good cheer, and faring
smoothly through life, on the principle of always saying what was
expected of her, and never seeing anything to anybody's disadvantage.
She assured Mrs. James Frost that she did not think Delaford to blame;
many girls would be foolish about a man with personal advantages, but
she could not see it was his fault.  Poor Marianne had been always
weakly, and, 'After all, ma'am, some young women will put constructions
upon anything,' said Mrs. Fanshawe, deciding that at least she should
make no mischief by sacrificing poor Marianne.
Isabel did not like to come to more individual inquiries, lest she
should prepare discomfort for Charlotte; but she easily satisfied
herself that all was as right as convenient, and having occasion to
write some orders to Charlotte, communicated the proposal, saying that
all should be settled on her return.
There was wild work in the brain of the poor little Lady of Eschalott.
No more stairs to scrub!  No more mats to shake!  No more hurrying
after lost time, and an uneasy remembrance of undone duties! No more
hardening of fingers, no more short-sleeved lilac, no more vulgarities
from the cook!  Ladylike dress, high wages, work among flowers and
gauzes, reading to Miss Louisa, housekeeper's-room society, rank as
'Arnold' or 'Miss Arnold!'  How much more suitable to the betrothed of
the Superintendent at San Benito!  To be sure, she was aware that a
serpent lurked among the flowers; but she had shown him a bit of her
mind once, and she found she could take care of herself, and keep him
at a distance.
With her eyes shut, she already beheld Jane Beckett meeting her, when
seated at the back of a carriage, with a veil and a parasol, addressing
her as a grand lady, and kissing and praising her when she found her
little Charlotte after all.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE TRUSTEES' MEETING.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
As You Like It.
'My Lord,' said Frampton, entering the library late one evening, in
visible perturbation, and addressing himself to Fitzjocelyn, 'there is
a person wishing to see you.'
'What person at this time of night?' said Louis.
'In fact, my Lord,' said the butler, hesitating, 'it is the young
person at Mr. Frost's.'
'Something must be the matter!' cried Louis, starting up.
'She would explain nothing to me, she insisted on seeing your lordship;
and--in fact--she was in such a state of agitation that I left her with
Mrs. Bowles.'
Louis lost no time in hurrying into the hall.  Charlotte must have
followed Frampton without his knowledge, for she was already there;
and, springing with clasped hands towards Fitzjocelyn, she cried,
sobbing, 'My Lord, my Lord, come to master!'
'Is he ill? or the children?'
'No, no! but he'll be off, he'll be off like poor Tom!' exclaimed
Charlotte, between her gasps; 'but I've locked it!' and she waved a
door-key, and seemed about to laugh hysterically.
'Sit down, Charlotte,' said Louis, authoritatively, bringing a chair.
'If you do not explain yourself reasonably at once, I shall call Mrs.
Bowles, and desire her to put you to bed.'
She made an imploring gesture, sank trembling into the chair, and,
after a few incoherent efforts, managed to speak--'If you would but
come to master, my Lord--I know it is something bad.'
Louis thought it wisest to despatch Frampton at once to order the
carriage to be brought out immediately; and this so far pacified
Charlotte, that she could speak comprehensibly on the cause of her
alarm.  'He is in such a way!' she began.  'He went out to the
school-examination, I believe, in his cap and gown, this morning; he
was gone all day, but just at dusk I heard him slam-to the front door,
fit to shake the house down, like he does when he is put out. I'd a
thought nothing of that; but by-and-by I heard him stamping up and down
the study, like one in a frenzy, and I found his cap and gown lying all
of a heap in a corner of the hall.  Then, Mr. Calcott came to call; and
when I went into the study, master had his head down on the table, and
wouldn't see no one; he fairly stamped to me to be gone, and bring him
no more messages.  Mr. Calcott, he looked so sorry and concerned, and
sent in again.  I was to say that he hoped some arrangement might be
made, if Mr. Frost would only see him; but master had locked the door,
and hallooed out that I was to say he was obliged, but couldn't see
nobody.  So Mr. Calcott was forced to go; and there was poor master.
Not one morsel of dinner has he had.  I knocked, but he would not open,
only said he did not want for nothing.  No, not even when 'twas time
for Miss Catharine to come down.   She thumped at the door, and called
'Papa' so pretty; but he never heeded, except to call out, 'Take her
away!'  Charlotte was crying so much that she could hardly proceed.
'Then I knew it must be something very melancholy indeed.  But
by-and-by he opens the door with a great jerk, and runs right up to the
lumber-room.  I saw his face, and 'twas like a corpse, my Lord; and he
brings down his portmanteau into his dressing-room, and I hears him
pulling out all his drawers.  'He'll be gone!' I thinks, 'he'll be off
to America, too!  And my poor mistress!'  So I went up quietly, and in
secret, unbeknown to them all, and got my bonnet; and I've run every
step of the way--for you are the only one, my Lord, as can soothe his
wounded spirit; and I've locked both the doors, and here's the key, so
he can't be gone till you come.'
'Locked the doors!' cried Louis.  'What have you done?  Suppose your
mistress or Miss Clara were ill?'
'Oh, no--no, it is not that,' said Charlotte; 'or why should he flee
from the face of his children?  Why, I took Miss Salome up to the top
of the stairs, when she was screaming and crying with all her might,
and you would not have thought he was within a mile of her.  No, my
Lord, no one can't do nothing but you.'
'I'll come at once,' said Louis.  'You did quite right to fetch me; but
it was a frightful thing to lock the door.'
Sending Charlotte to the housekeeper, he went to communicate her
strange intelligence to his father, who shared his dismay so much as
almost to wish to come with him to Northwold; but Louis felt he could
deal better alone with James.  His fears took the direction of the
Italian travellers, knowing that any misfortune to them must recoil on
James with double agony after such a parting.
In very brief space the carriage was at Northwold, and desiring that it
should wait at the corner of the Terrace, Louis followed Charlotte, who
had jumped down from the box, and hastened forward to unlock the door;
and he was in time to hear the angry, though suppressed, greeting that
received her.  'Pretty doings, ma'am!  So I have caught you out at
last, though you did think to lock me in!  He shan't come in!  I wonder
at your impudence!  The very front door!'
'Oh, cook, don't!'  The poor breathless voice managed at last to be
heard.  'This is Lord Fitzjocelyn.'
Cook had vanished out of sight or hearing before Louis's foot was
within the threshold.  The study-door was open, the fire expiring, the
books and papers pushed back; and James's fierce, restless tread was
heard pacing vehemently about his own room.  Louis ran hastily up, and
entered at once.  His cousin stood staring with wild eyes, his hair was
tossed and tangled, his face lividly pale, and the table was strewn
with fragments of letters, begun and torn up again; his clothes lay
tumbled in disorder on the floor, where his portmanteau lay open and
partly packed.  All Louis's worst alarm seemed fulfilled at once.
'What has happened?' he cried, catching hold of both James's hands, as
if to help him to speak.  'Who is ill?--not Clara?'
'No--no one is ill,' said James, withdrawing his hands, and kneeling
down by his box, with an air of feigned indifference; 'I am only going
to London.'
'To London?'
'Aye, to see what is to be done,--ship--chaplaincy, curacy, literature,
selling sermons at five shillings each,--what not. I am no longer
master of Northwold school!'  He strove to speak carelessly, but
bending over his packing, thrust down the clothes with desperate blows.
Louis sat down, too much dismayed to utter a word.
'One morning's work in the conclave,' said James, with the same assumed
ease.  'Here's their polite reprimand, which they expected me to put up
with,--censuring all my labour, forbidding Sunday-classes, accusing me
of partiality and cruelty, with a lot of nonsense about corporal
punishment and dignity.  I made answer, that if I were master at all, I
must be at liberty to follow my own views, otherwise I would resign;
and, would you believe it, they snapped at the offer--they thought it
highly desirable!  There's an end of it.'
'Impossible!' cried Louis, casting his eye over the reprimand, and
finding that the expressions scarcely warranted James's abstract of
them.  'You must have mistaken!'
'Do you doubt that?' and James threw to him a sheet where, in
Richardson's clerkly handwriting, the trustees of King Edward's
Northwold Grammar School formally accepted the resignation of the
Reverend James Roland Frost Dynevor.
'They cannot be so hasty!  Did not Mr. Calcott call to gee you?'
'An old humbug!'
'I'll go and see him this instant.  Something may be done.'
'No,' said James, holding him down by the shoulder, 'I will not be
degraded by vain solicitations.'
'This must be that wretched Ramsbotham!' exclaimed Louis.  'Oh, Jem! I
little thought he had so much power to injure you.'
'It is as well you did not,' said James.  'It would have made no
difference, except in the pain it would have cost you; and the only
gratification in this business is, that I suffer because neither you
nor I would deny our principles.  I thank you, Fitzjocelyn!' and he
straightened himself in the satisfaction of persecuted rectitude.
'You have very little to thank me for,' said Louis, wringing his hand,
and turning aside, as if unable yet to face the full extent of the evil.
'Never fear for us,' continued James, boldly; 'we shall struggle on.
Mens conscia,--you see I can't forget to be a schoolmaster.'
'But what are you about?  Where are you going?'
'To London.  You spoke to a publisher about my lectures on history;
they will serve for introduction.  He may make me his hack--a willing
one, while I advertise--apply for anything.  I must be gone!'
'You do not look fit for a night journey.  You would be too early at
Estminster to see Isabel.'
'Don't name her!' cried James, starting round as if the word were a
dart.  'Thank Heaven that she is away!  I must write to her.  Maybe,
Lady Conway will keep her till I am settled--till I have found some
lodging in London where no one will know us.'
'And where you may run up a comfortable doctor's bill.'
With a gesture--half passion, half despair--James reiterated, 'There's
no staying here.  I must be gone.  I must be among strangers.'
'Your mens conscia would better prove that it has no cause for shame by
staying here, instead of rushing out of sight into the human
wilderness, and sacrificing those poor little--'
James struck his foot on the floor, as though to intercept the word;
but Louis continued, apparently unmoved by his anger--'Those poor
little children.  If misfortune and injury be no disgrace to the
injured, I call it cowardly pride to fly off by night to hide oneself,
instead of living in your own house, like an honest man.'
'Live!--pray what am I to live on?' cried James, laughing hoarsely.
'You will not find out by whirling to London in your present state.'
In fact, Louis's most immediate care was to detain him for that one
night.  There was a look of coming illness about him, and his
desperate, maddened state of mind might obscure his judgment, and urge
him into some precipitate measure, such as he might afterwards rue
bitterly for the sake of the wife and children, the bare thought of
whom seemed at present to sting him so intolerably.  Moreover, Louis
had a vague hope that so harsh a proceeding would be abandoned by the
trustees; his father would remonstrate, and James might be able to
think and to apologize.  He was hardly a rational being to-night, and
probably would have driven away any other companion; but long habit,
and external coolness, enabled Louis to stand his ground, and to
protract matters till the clock, striking eleven, relieved him, as much
as it exasperated James, by proving it so late that the last train
would have already past.
He persisted in declaring that he should go by the first in the
morning, and Louis persuaded him to go to bed, after Charlotte had
brought them some tea, which, he said, choked him.  Deciding on
sleeping at No. 5, Louis sent home the carriage, with a note to his
father; and Charlotte pressed her hands together in a transport of
gratitude when she found that he was not going to abandon her master.
She did her best to make the forlorn house comfortable; but it was but
cold comfort, with all the fires gone out, and he was too sad and
anxious to heed it.
She was at his door early the next morning, with a summons more
alarming than surprising.  She was sure that master was very ill.
There was James lying across his bed, half-dressed, turned away from
the dim morning light, and more frightfully pale than ever.  He started
angrily at Louis's entrance, and sprang up, but fell back, insisting
with all his might that nothing ailed him but a common headache, which
needed only to be left quiet for an hour or two.  He said it venomously.
'A very uncommon headache,' thought Louis.  'My belief is, that it is
little short of brain fever!  If I could only feel his pulse!  But it
would be very like taking a mad dog's hand.  There's nothing for it but
to fetch old Walby.  He may have some experience of refractory
patients.'
'Go home, Louis,' reiterated James, savagely, on opening his eyes and
finding him not gone.  'I tell you I want nobody.  I shall be in London
before night.'
And starting up, he tried to draw the curtain at his feet, to shut out
the tardy dawn; but too giddy to persevere, he sank back after one
noisy pull.
Louis drew it completely, shaded the window, and would have settled the
pillows, but was not allowed; and obtaining an impatient grunt by way
of dismissal, he ran down stairs, caught up hat and stick, and set off
to summon Mr. Walby from his comfortable family breakfast-table.  The
good old doctor was more concerned than amazed.  He could hardly
surmount the shock to his trustee conscience, on hearing of the
consequence of yesterday's proceedings.
'I was much grieved at the time,' he said, as they walked to the
Terrace together.  'You will believe me that I was no willing party, my
Lord.'
'I could never believe that you would do anything hard towards any one,
Mr. Walby,' said Louis, kindly; and a few more like assurances led the
old man to volunteer the history of the case in confidence.
Ramsbotham had brought before the meeting of the trustees a serious
mass of charges, on which he founded a motion that Mr. Frost should be
requested to resign.  Every one rejected such a measure, and the
complaints were sifted.  Some were palpably false, others exaggerated,
others related to matters of principle; but deducting these, it still
was proved that the Sunday attendance and evening lectures were too
visibly the test of his favour, and that the boys were sometimes
treated with undue severity, savouring of violent temper.  'I must
confess, my Lord,' said Mr. Walby, sinking his voice, 'I am afraid Mr.
Frost is too prompt with his hand.  A man does not know how hard he
hits, when he knocks a boy over the ears with a book.  Mrs. Barker's
little boy really had a gathering under the ear in consequence;--I saw
it myself.'
Louis was confounded; he had nothing to say to this; he knew the force
that irritation gave to James's hand too well to refuse his credence,
and he could only feel shame and dismay, as if himself guilty by his
misjudged patronage.
Mr. Walby proceeded to say that, under the circumstances, the trustees
had decided on remonstrating by letter, after the examination; and it
was easy to perceive that the reprimand, which might have been wise and
moderate from the Squire, had gained a colour from every one concerned,
so as to censure what was right and aggravate what was wrong.  Mr.
Frost's reply had been utterly unexpected; Ramsbotham and the
bookseller had caught at the resignation, and so did the butcher, who
hated the schoolmaster for having instilled inconveniently high
principles into his son. Richardson abstained from voting; Mr. Calcott
fought hard for Mr. Frost, but the grocer was ill, and only poor old
Mr. Walby supported him, and even they felt that their letter had not
deserved such treatment.  Alas! had not Fitzjocelyn himself taught
Northwold that the Squire was not a dictator?  Even then, Mr. Calcott,
still hoping that an apology might retrieve the day, had set forth to
argue the matter with James Frost, whom he could not suppose serious in
his intentions, but thought he meant to threaten the trustees into
acquiescence.  The doors had been closed against him, and Mr. Walby
feared that now the step was known, it was too late to retract it. 'The
ladies would never allow it,' he declared; 'there was no saying how
virulent they were against Mr. Frost; and as to consideration for his
family, that rather inflamed their dislike.  They had rich relations
enough!  It would be only too good for so fine a lady to be brought
down.'  Every one had some story of her pride, neglect, or bad
housewifery.  'And I can tell you,' said Mr. Walby, 'that I am not in
their good books for declaring that I never saw anything from her but
very pretty, affable manners.'
With these words they reached the house; and with sighs and murmurs of
'Ah! poor young man!'  Mr. Walby followed Louis to the landing-place,
where they both paused, looking at each other in doubt how to effect an
entrance, Louis suddenly remembering that no presence would be more
intolerable to the patient than that of a trustee.  However, there was
nothing for it but to walk in, and announce, as a matter of course,
that he had thought it right to call in Mr. Walby.
The extremity of displeasure brought James to his feet, and out into
the passage, saying, with grave formality, that he was much obliged,
and glad to see Mr. Walby as a friend, but Lord Fitzjocelyn was
mistaken in thinking him in need of his advice.  Many thanks, he would
trouble him no further; and affecting a laugh, he said that Fitzjocelyn
seemed never to have heard of a bad headache.
'Acting does not mend matters, Jem,' said Louis.  'You had much better
confess how really ill you are.'
Excessive giddiness made James stagger against his cousin, and Louis,
throwing his arms round him, looked in great alarm to the doctor for
help, but was answered by something very like a smile.  'Aye, aye, sir,
there's nothing for it but to go to bed.  If his lordship there had
seen as many cases of jaundice as I have, he would not look so
frightened.  Very wholesome disorder!  Yes, lie down, and I'll send you
a thing or two to take.'
So saying, Mr. Walby helped Louis to lay their unwilling invalid on the
bed without much resistance or reply, and presently departed, so
infinitely relieved that he could not help indulging in a little
chuckle at the young Viscount's mistake.  As soon as he was gone, James
revived enough to protest that it was all nonsense, doctors must needs
give a name to everything; if they would only let him alone, he should
be himself and off to London in two hours; and that it was Fitzjocelyn
himself who was looking excessively ill, and as yellow as a guinea.  He
would not hear of undressing and going absolutely to bed, and fairly
scolded every one out of sight.  Good Miss Mercy, who had trotted in at
the tidings of illness, stood at the nursery-door, telegraphing signs
of commiseration in answer to Louis's looks of perplexity.
'At least,' she said, 'you had better come to breakfast with us, and
hear what my sister says--Salome always knows what is best.'
He soon found himself in the snug parlour, where the small round
breakfast-table, drawn close to Miss Faithfull's fireside chair, had a
sort of doll's-house air of cheerful comfort, with the tiny plates,
tea-cups, and the miniature loaf, and the complicated spider-legs,
among which it was not easy to dispose of his own length of limb.
The meal passed in anxious consultation.  There might be no danger, but
the disorder was severe and increasing.  James's health had long been
suffering from harass of mind, want of exercise, and unwholesome diet;
and the blow of the previous day had brought things to a crisis.  There
he lay, perfectly unmanageable, permitting neither aid nor consolation,
unable to endure the sight of any one, and too much stupefied by
illness to perceive the impracticability of his wild scheme of seeking
employment in London.
Miss Faithfull pronounced that either Mercy or Lord Fitzjocelyn must go
and fetch Mrs. James Frost home.
'I was only thinking how long we could keep her away,' said Louis.
'Pray don't be shocked, dear Miss Mercy, but I thought I could nurse
poor Jem much better alone than with another dead weight on our hands.'
'They would neither of them thank you,' said Miss Faithfull, laughing.
'Depend upon it, she will know best how to deal with him.'
'Well, you see more of their household than I do, but I have never
dared to think of her!  Do you remember the words, 'if thou hast run
with the footmen and they have wearied thee--''
'There are some people who can run with the horsemen better than with
the footmen,' said Miss Salome.  'You know we are very fond of young
Mrs. Frost.  We cannot forget her sweetness when she lived in this
house, and she has always been most kind and friendly.  I do believe
that to display the most admirable qualities, she only needs to be
roused.'
'To live in the house with Jem, and Jem's three babies, and yet want
rousing!'
'I have thought,' said Salome, diffidently, 'that he was only too
gentle with her.'
'Do you know how very severe you are growing, Miss Faithfull?' said
Louis, looking her in the face, in the gravity of amusement.
'I mean,' said Miss Faithfull, blushing, 'though of course I do not
know, that I have fancied it might be better for both if he could have
gone to the root of the matter, and set fairly before her the prime
duties requisite in the mistress of such a family.  He may have done
so.'
'I think not,' said Louis; 'it would be awkward when a woman fancied
she embraced poverty voluntarily for his sake.  Poverty!  It was riches
compared with their present condition. Isabel on 150 pounds a-year!  It
may well make poor Jem ill to think about it!  I only wonder it is not
a brain-fever!'
'Lord Fitzjocelyn regrets that brain-fever,' said Miss Faithfull.
'Probably my ideas on the subject are derived from the prevalence of
the complaint in light literature,' said Louis, smiling.  'It would be
more dignified, and suit Isabel better.  Poor Isabel!  I hope I have
done her injustice.  She behaved gloriously at the barricades, and has
a great soul after all; but I had begun to think heroines not
calculated for moderate circumstances.  May they do better in no
circumstances at all!  Heighho! how a heavy heart makes one talk
nonsense!  So I am to fetch the poor thing home, Miss Faithfull.'
This was determined on, whether with or without James's consent; Miss
Mercy undertaking that she and Martha would help Charlotte, and dispose
of the children in the House Beautiful; and she went back with Louis to
fetch them, when little Catharine was found peeping through the bars of
her prison-gate at the top of the nursery-stairs, shouting lustily for
papa.  She graciously accepted her godfather as a substitute, and was
carried by him to her kind neighbour's house, already a supplementary
home.  As to her father, Louis found him more refractory than ever.
His only greeting was, 'Why are not you gone home?'  He scorned Mr.
Walby's prescriptions, and made such confident assertions that he
should be off to London in the evening, that Fitzjocelyn almost
reverted to the brain-fever theory, and did not venture to hint his
intention to any one but Charlotte, telling her that he should now
almost think her justified in locking the doors.
Sending information to his father, he started for Estminster, very
disconsolate, and full of self-reproach for the hasty proceedings which
had borne such bitter fruits.  The man and the situation had been an
injustice to each other; a sensitive irritable person was the very last
to be fit for a position requiring unusual judgment and temper, where
his energy had preyed upon itself.  His being placed there had been the
work of Louis's own impetuous scorn of the wisdom of elder and graver
heads.  Such regrets derived additional poignancy from the
impossibility of conferring direct assistance upon James, and from the
degree of justice in the hard measure which had been dealt to him,
would make it for ever difficult to recommend him, and yet the devising
future schemes for his welfare was the refuge which Louis's mind most
willingly sought from the present perplexity of the communication in
store for poor Isabel.
As he put out his head at the Estminster station, a familiar voice
shouted, 'Hollo!  Fitzjocelyn, how jolly!  Have you got James there? I
told Isabel it would be no use; but when she did not get a letter this
morning, she would have it that he was coming, and got me to walk up
with her.'
'Where is she?' asked Louis, as he jumped out and shook hands with
Walter.
'Walking up and down the esplanade.  She would not come into the
station, so I said I would run up to satisfy her.  I don't know what
she will say to you for not being Frost.'
'Do you mean that she is anxious!'
'It is the correct thing, isn't it, when wives get away from their
husbands, and have not the fragment of a letter for twenty-four whole
hours?  But what do you mean, Fitzjocelyn?' asked the boy, suddenly
sobering.  'Is anything really the matter?'
'Yes, Walter,' said Louis; 'we must tell your sister as best we can.
James is ill, and I am come for her.'
Walter was silent for a few minutes, then drew a sigh, saying, 'Poor
Isabel, I wish it had not been!  These were the only comfortable
holidays I have had since she chose to marry.'
Isabel here came in sight, quickening her pace as she first saw that
her brother had a companion, but slackening in disappointment when she
perceived that it was not her husband; then, the next moment hurrying
on, and as she met them, exclaiming, 'Tell me at once! What is it?'
'Nothing serious,' said Louis.  'The children are all well, but I left
James very uncomfortable, though with nothing worse than a fit of
jaundice.'
The inexperienced Isabel hardly knew whether this were not as
formidable as even the cherished brain-fever, and becoming very pale,
she said, 'I am ready at once--Walter will let mamma know.'
'There will be no train for two hours,' said Louis.  'You will have
plenty of time to prepare.'
'You should have telegraphed,' said Isabel, 'I could have come by the
first train.'
Trembling, she grasped Walter's arm, and began hastening home,
impatient to be doing something.  'I knew something was wrong,' she
exclaimed; 'I ought to have gone home yesterday, when there was no
letter.'
'Indeed, there--was nothing the matter yesterday, at least, with his
health,' said Louis.  'You are alarming yourself far too much--'
'To be sure, Isabel,' chimed in Walter.  'A fellow at my tutor's had
it, and did nothing but wind silkworm's silk all the time.  We shall
have James yet to spend Christmas with us.  Everybody laughs at the
jaundice, though Fitzjocelyn does look so lugubrious that he had almost
frightened me.'
'Is this true?' said Isabel, looking from one to the other, as if she
had been frightened in vain.
'Quite true, Isabel,' said Walter.  'Never mind Fitzjocelyn's long
face; I wouldn't go if I were you!  Don't spoil the holidays.'
'I must go, Walter dear,' said Isabel, 'but I do not think Lord
Fitzjocelyn would play with my fears.  Either he is very ill, or
something else is wrong.'
'You have guessed it, Isabel,' said Louis.  'This illness is partly the
effect of distress of mind.'
'That horrid meeting of trustees!' cried Isabel.  'I am sure they have
been impertinent.'
'They objected to some of his doings; he answered by threatening to
resign, and I am sorry to say that the opposition set prevailed to have
his resignation accepted.'
'A very good thing too,' cried Sir Walter.  'I always thought that
school a shabby concern.   To be under a lot of butchers and bakers,
and nothing but cads among the boys!  He ought to be heartily glad to
be rid of the crew.'
Isabel's indignation was checked by a sort of melancholy amusement at
her brother's view, but Louis doubted whether she realized the weight
of her own words as she answered--'Unfortunately, Walter, it is nearly
all we have to live upon.'
'So much the better,' continued Walter.  'I'll tell you--you shall all
go to Thornton Conway, and I'll come and spend my holidays there,
instead of kicking my heels at these stupid places.  I shan't mind your
babies a bit, and Frost may call himself my tutor if he likes. I don't
care if you take me away from Eton.'
'A kind scheme, Walter,' said Isabel, 'but wanting in two important
points, mamma's consent and James's.'
'Oh, I'll take care of mamma!'
'I'm afraid I can't promise the same as to James.'
'Ah! I see.  Delaford was quite right when he said Mr. Frost was a
gentleman who never knew what was for his own advantage.'
As they arrived at the house, Isabel desired to know how soon she must
be ready, and went upstairs.  Walter detained his cousin--'I say,
Fitzjocelyn, have they really got nothing to live on?'
'No more than will keep them from absolute want.'
'I shall take them home,' said Walter, with much satisfaction. 'I shall
write to tell James that there is nothing else to be done. I cannot do
without Isabel, and I'll make my mother consent.'
Fitzjocelyn was glad to be freed from the boy on any terms, and to see
him go off to write his letter.
Walter was at least sincere and warm-hearted in his selfishness, and so
more agreeable than his mother, whom Louis found much distressed, under
the secret conviction that something might be expected of her. 'Poor
Isabel!  I wish she could come to me; but so many of them--and we
without a settled home.  If there were no children--but London houses
are so small; and, indeed, it would be no true kindness to let them
live in our style for a little while.  They must run to expenses in
dress; it would be much more economical at home, and I could send
Walter to them if he is very troublesome.'
'Thank you,' said Louis.  'I think James will be able to ride out the
storm independently.'
'I know that would be his wish.  And I think I heard that Mr. Dynevor
objected to the school.  That might be one obstacle removed.'
Lady Conway comforted herself by flourishing on into predictions that
all would now be right, and that poor dear Isabel would soon be a much
richer woman than herself; while Louis listened to the castle-building,
not thinking it worth while to make useless counter-prophecies.
The sisters were upstairs, assisting Isabel, and they all came down
together.  The girls were crying; but Isabel's dark, soft eyes, and
noble head, had an air of calm, resolute elevation, which drove all
Louis's misgivings away, and which seemed quite beyond and above the
region of Lady Conway's caresses and affectionate speeches.  Walter and
Virginia came up to the station, and parted with their sister with
fondness that was much mure refreshing, Walter reiterating that his was
the only plan.
'Now, Fitzjocelyn,' said Isabel, when they were shut into a coupe,
'tell me what you said about distress of mind.  It has haunted me
whether you used those words.'
'Could you doubt his distress at such a state of affairs?'
'I thought there could be no distress of mind where the suffering is
for the truth.'
'Ah! if he could quite feel it so!'
'What do you mean?  There has been a cabal against James from the first
to make him lay aside his principles, and I cannot regret his refusal
to submit to improper dictation, at whatever cost to myself.'
'I am afraid he better knows than you do what that cost is likely to
be.'
'Does he think I cannot bear poverty?' exclaimed Isabel.
'He had not said so--' began Louis; 'but--'
'You both think me a poor, helpless creature,' said Isabel, her eyes
kindling as they had done in the midst of danger.  'I can do better
than you think.  I may be able myself to do something towards our
maintenance.'
He could not help answering, in the tone that gave courtesy to almost
any words, 'I am afraid it does not answer for the wife to be the
bread-winner.'
'Then you doubt my writing being worth anything?' she asked, in a hurt
tone of humility.  'Tell me candidly, for it would be the greatest
kindness;' and her eye unconsciously sought the bag where lay Sir
Hubert, whom all this time her imagination was exalting, as the hero
who would free them from their distresses.
'Worth much pleasure to me, to the world at large,' said Louis;
'but--you told me to speak plainly--to your home, would any
remuneration be worth your own personal care?'
Isabel coloured, but did not speak.
Louis ventured another sentence--'It is a delicate subject, but you
must know better than I how far James would be likely to bear that
another, even you, should work for his livelihood.'
When Isabel spoke again, it was to ask further particulars; and when he
had told all, she found solace in exclaiming at the folly and injustice
of James's enemies, until the sense of fairness obliged him to say, 'I
wish the right and the wrong ever were fairly divided in this world;
and yet perhaps it is best as it is: the grain of right on either side
may save the sin from being a presumptuous one.'
'It would be hard to find the one grain of right on the part of the
Ramsbotham cabal.'
'Perhaps you would not think so, if you were a boy's mother.'
'Oh!' cried Isabel, with tears in her eyes, 'if he thought he had been
too hasty, he always made such reparation that only cowards could help
being touched.  I'm sure they deserved it, and much more.'
'No doubt,' said Louis; 'but, alas! if all had their deserts--'
'Then you really think he was too severe?'
'I think his constitutional character was hardly fit for so trying a
post, and that his family and school troubles reacted upon each other.'
'You mean Clara's conduct; and dear grandmamma--oh! if she could but
have stayed with us!  If you could have seen how haggard and grieved he
came home from Cheveleigh!  I do not think he has been quite the same
ever since.'
'And No. 5 has never been the same,' said Louis.
'Tell me,' said Isabel, suddenly, 'are we very poor indeed?'
'I fear so, Isabel.  Till James can find some employment, I fear there
is a stern struggle with poverty before you.'
'Does that mean living as the Faithfulls do?'
'Yes, I think your means will be nearly the same as theirs.'
'Fitzjocelyn,' said Isabel, after a long pause, 'I see what you have
been implying all this time, and I have been feeling it too.  I have
been absorbed in my own pursuits, and not paid attention enough to
details of management, and so I have helped to fret and vex my husband.
You all think my habits an additional evil in this trial.'
'James has never said a word of the kind,' cried Louis.
'I know he has not; but I ought to have opened my eyes to it long ago,
and I thank you for helping me.  There--will you take that manuscript,
and keep it out of my way?  It has been a great tempter to me.  It is
finished now, and it might bring in something.  But I can have only one
thought now--how to make James happier and more at ease.'
'Then, Isabel, I don't think your misfortunes will be misfortunes.'
'To suffer for right principles should give strength for anything,'
said Isabel.  'Think what many better women than I have had to endure,
when they have had to be ashamed of their husband, not proud of him!
Now, I do hope and trust that God will help us, and carry us and the
children through with it!'
Louis felt that in this frame she was truly fit to cheer and sustain
James.  How she might endure the actual struggle with penury, he dared
not imagine; at present he could only be carried along by her lofty
composure.
James still lay on his tossed, uncomfortable bed in the evening
twilight.  The long, lonely hours, when he imagined Louis to have taken
him at his word and gone home, had given him a miserable sense of
desertion, and as increasing sensations of illness took from him the
hopes of moving on that day, he became distracted at the thought of the
anxiety his silence would cause Isabel, and, after vainly attempting to
write, had been lying with the door open, watching for some approaching
step.
There was the familiar sound of a soft, gliding step on the stairs,
then a pause, and the sweet soft voice, 'My poor James, how sadly
uncomfortable you are!'
'My dear!' he cried, hastily raising himself, 'who has been frightening
you?'
'No one, Fitzjocelyn was so kind as to come for me.'
'Ah! I wished you to have been spared this unpleasant business.'
'Do you think I could bear to stay away!  Oh, James! have I been too
useless and helpless for you even to be glad to see me?'
'It was for your own sake,' he murmured, pressing her hand.  'Has
Fitzjocelyn told you?'
'Yes,' said Isabel, looking up, as she sat beside him.  'Never mind,
James.  It is better to suffer wrong than to do it.  I do not fear but
that, if we strive to do our duty, God will help us, and make it turn
out for the best for our children and ourselves.'
He grasped her hand in intense emotion.
'I know you are anxious about me,' added Isabel.  'My ways have been
too self-indulgent for you to think I can bear hardness.  I made too
many professions at first; I will make no more now, but only tell you
that I trust to do my utmost, and not shrink from my duties.  And now,
not a word more about it till you are better.'
CHAPTER XV.
SWEET USES OF ADVERSITY.
One furnace many times the good and bad will hold;
But what consumes the chaff will only cleanse the gold.
R. C. TRENCH.
During the succeeding days, James had little will or power to consider
his affairs; and Isabel, while attending on him, had time to think over
her plans.  Happily, they had not a debt.  Mrs. Frost had so entirely
impressed her grandson's mind with her own invariable rule of paying
her way, that it had been one of his grounds for pride that he had
never owed anything to any man.
They were thus free to choose their own course, but Lord Ormersfield
urged their remaining at Northwold for the present.  He saw Mr.
Calcott, who had been exceedingly concerned at the turn affairs had
taken, and very far from wishing to depose James, though thinking that
he needed an exhortation to take heed to his ways.  It had been an
improper reprimand, improperly received; but the Earl and the Squire
agreed that nothing but morbid fancy could conjure up disgrace, such as
need prevent James Frost from remaining in his own house until he could
obtain employment, provided he and his wife had the resolution to
contract their style of living under the eye of their neighbours.
This gave neither of them a moment's uneasiness.  It was not the
direction of their pride; and even before James's aching head was
troubled with deliberation, Isabel had discussed her plan with the Miss
Faithfulls.  She would imagine herself in a colony, and be troubled
with no more scruples about the conventional tasks of a lady than if
she were in the back-woods.
They would shut up some of the rooms, take one servant of all-work, and
Isabel would be nursery-maid herself.  'We may do quite as well as the
carpenter's wife,' she said; 'she has more children and less income,
and yet always seems to me the richest person whom I know.'
James groaned, and turned his face away.  He could not forbid it, for
even Isabel's exertion must be permitted rather than the dishonour of
living beyond their means; and he consoled himself with thinking that
when the deadening inertness of his illness should leave him, he should
see some means of finding employment for himself, which would save her
from toil and exertion, and, in the meantime, with all his keen
self-reproach, it was a blessed thing to have been brought back to his
enthusiastic admiration for her, all discontents and drawbacks utterly
forgotten in her assiduous affection and gallant cheerfulness.
Lord Ormersfield had readily acceded to his son's wish to bring the
party to spend Christmas at Ormersfield, as soon as James could be
moved.  During their visit the changes were to be made, and before
setting out Isabel had to speak to the servants.  Charlotte's alacrity
and usefulness had made her doubly esteemed during her master's
illness; and when he heard how she was to be disposed of, he seemed
much vexed.  He said that she was a legacy from his grandmother, and
too innocent and pretty to be cast about among strange servants in all
the places where the Conways visited; and that he would not have
consented to the transfer, but that, under their present circumstances,
it was impossible to keep her.  If any evil came to her, it would be
another miserable effect of his own temper.
Isabel thought he exaggerated the dangers, and she spoke brightly to
Charlotte about fixing the day of her going to Estminster, so as to be
put into the ways of the place before her predecessor departed. The
tears at once came into Charlotte's eyes, and she answered, 'If you
please, ma'am, I should be very sorry to leave, unless I did not give
satisfaction.'
'That is far from being the reason, Charlotte; but we cannot keep so
good a servant--Mr. Frost has given up--'
'I have been put out of the school,' said James, from his sofa, in his
stern sense of truth.  'We must live on as little as possible, and
therefore must part with you, Charlotte, though from no fault of yours.
You must look on us as your friends, and in any difficulty apply to us;
for, as Mrs. Frost says, we look on you as a charge from my
grandmother.'
Charlotte escaped to hide her tears; and when, a few minutes after, the
Ormersfield carriage arrived, and nurses and babies were packed in, and
her master walked feebly and languidly down stairs, and her mistress
turned round to say, kindly, 'You will let me know, Charlotte?' she
just articulated, 'Thank you, ma'am, I will write.'
Mr. Frost's words had not been news to Charlotte.  His affairs had been
already pretty well understood and discussed, and the hard, rude,
grasping comments of the vulgar cook--nay, even of the genteel
nurse--had been so many wounds to the little maiden, bred up by Jane in
the simplicity of feudal reverence and affection for all that bore the
name of Frost Dynevor.
Her mistress left to the tender mercies of some servant such as these,
some one who might only care for her own ease and profit, and not once
think of who and what she had been!  The little children knocked about
by some careless girl!  Never, never!  All the doubts and scruples
about putting her own weak head and vain heart in the way of being made
faithless to Tom revived, reinforced by her strong and generous
affection.  A romantic purpose suddenly occurred to her, flushing her
cheek and brightening her eye.  In that one impulse, scrubbing, washing
dishes, short lilac sleeves were either forgotten, or acquired a
positive glory, and while the cook was issuing her invitations for a
jollification and gossip at the expense of Mr. and Mrs. Frost,
Charlotte sat in her attic, amid Jane's verbenas, which she had
cherished there ever since their expulsion from the kitchen, and wrote
and cried, and left off, to read over, and feel satisfied at, the
felicity of her phrases, and the sentiment of her project.
'Dear and Honoured Madam,--Pardon the liberty I am taking but I am sure
that you and my reverend and redoubted master would not willingly have
inflicted so much pain as yesterday on a poor young female which was
brought up from an orphan child by my dear late lamented mistress and
owes everything to her and would never realize the touching lines of
the sublime poet
Deserted in his utmost need
By those his former bounty fed.
As to higher wages and a situation offering superior advantages such as
might prove attractive to other minds it has none to me.  My turn is
for fidelity in obscurity and dear and honoured lady I am a poor
unprotected girl which has read in many volumes of the dangers of going
forth into the snares of a wealthy and powerful family and begs you not
to deprive her of the shelter of the peaceful roof which has been her
haven and has been the seen of the joys and sorrows of her career.
Dear lady pardon the liberty that I have taken but it would brake my
heart to leave you and master and the dear children espeshilly in the
present winter of adversity which I have hands to help in to the best
of my poor abilities.  Dear and honoured lady I have often been idle
but I will be so no more I love the dear little ladies with all my
heart and I can cook and act in any capacity and wages is no object I
will not take none nor beer neither--and the parlour tea-leaves will be
sufficient.  Dear and honoured master and mistress forgive the liberty
a poor girl has taken and lend a favourable ear to my request for if
you persist in parting with me I know I shall not survive it.
'Your humble and faithful Servant,
'CHARLOTTE ARNOLD.'
Isabel received this letter while she was at breakfast with Lord
Ormersfield and Louis, and it was, of course, impossible to keep it to
herself.  'Talking of no wages!' said the Earl.  'Send her off at once.'
'You will despise me,' said Isabel, with tears in her eyes; 'but there
is something very touching in it, in spite of the affectation. I
believe she really means it.'
'Affectation is only matter of taste,' said Louis.  'Half the
simplicity of our day is only fashion; and Charlotte's letter, with a
few stops, and signed Chloe, would have figured handsomely in Mrs.
Radcliffe's time.'
'It does not depend on me,' said Isabel; 'James could not bear her
going before, and I am sure he will not now.'
'I think he ought not,' said Louis.  'Poor girl!  I do believe the
snares of wealthy families and fidelity in obscurity, really mean with
her the pomps and vanities versus duty and affection.'
'I am sure I would not drive her back to them,' said Isabel; 'but I am
only afraid the work will be too much for her strength.'
'The willing heart goes all the way,' said Louis; 'and maybe it will be
more wholesome than London, and sitting up.'
Isabel coloured and sighed; but added, that it would be infinite relief
on the children's account to keep some one so gentle-handed, and so
entirely to be trusted.
James's decision was immediate.  He called the letter a farrago, but
his laugh was mixed with tears at the faithful affection it displayed.
'It was mere folly,' he said, 'to think of keeping her without wages;
but, if she would accept such as could be afforded after taking a rough
village girl for her food to do the hard work, the experiment should be
made, in the hope that the present straits would only endure for a
short time.
This little event seemed to have done him much good, and put him more
at peace with the world.  He was grateful for Lord Ormersfield's
kindness and forbearance, and the enforced rest from work was
refreshing him; while Isabel had never been so cheerful and lively in
her life as now, when braced manfully for her work, full of energy, and
feeling that she must show herself happy and courageous to support his
depressed spirits.  She was making a beginning--she was practising
herself in her nursery duties, and, to her surprise, finding them quite
charming; and little Kitty so delighted with all she did for her, that
all the hitherto unsounded depths of the motherly heart were stirred
up, and she could not think why she had never found out her true
happiness.  She looked so bright and so beautiful, that even Lord
Ormersfield remarked it, pitying her for trials which he thought she
little realized; but Louis augured better, believing that it was not
ignorance but resolution which gave animation and brilliancy to her
dark eye and cheerfulness to her smile.
Fitzjocelyn took her to Dynevor Terrace in the afternoon to settle the
matter with Charlotte; and, on the way, he took the opportunity of
telling her that he had been reading Sir Hubert, and admired him very
much, discussing him and Adeline with the same vivid interest as her
own sisters showed in them as persons, not mere personages. Isabel said
they already seemed to her to belong to a world much farther back than
the last fortnight.
'There is some puzzle in the middle,' said Louis.  'I can't make out
the hero whose addresses were so inconvenient to Adeline, and who ran
away from the pirates.  He began as a crabbed old troubadour, who made
bad verses; and then he went on as a fantastic young Viscount, skipping
and talking nonsense.'
'Oh!' cried Isabel, much discomposed.  'Did I leave that piece there? I
took it to Estminster by mistake, and they told me of it.  I should
have taken it out.'
'That would have been a pity,' said Louis, 'for the Viscount is a much
more living man than the old troubadour.  When he had so many plans of
poems for the golden violet that he made none at all, I was quite taken
with him.  I began to think I was going to have a lesson.'
Isabel blushed and tried to laugh, but it was so unsuccessful that
Louis exclaimed in high glee--'There!  I do believe I was the fantastic
Viscount!  Oh! Isabel, it was too bad!  I can fairly acquit myself of
skipping ever since I had the honour of your acquaintance.'
'Or of running away from the pirates,' said Isabel.  'No, it was a
great deal too bad, and very wrong indeed.  It was when you did not run
away that I was so much ashamed, that I thought I had torn out every
atom.  I never told any one--not even Virginia!'
Louis had a very hearty laugh, and, when Isabel gaw him so excessively
amused, she ventured to laugh too at her ancient prejudice, and the
strange chance which had made the fantastic Viscount, Sir Roland's
critic.
'You must restore him,' said Louis, returning to business.  'That old
troubadour is the one inconsistency in the story, evidently not fitting
into the original plot.  I shall be delighted to sit for the portrait.'
'I don't think you could now,' said Isabel.  'I think the motley must
have been in the spectacles with which I looked at you.'
'Ah! it is a true poem,' said Louis, 'it must have been a great relief
to your feelings!  Shall I give it back to you?
'Oh!  I can't touch it now!' cried Isabel.  'You may give it to me, and
if ever I have time to think again of it, I may touch it up, but
certainly not now.'
'And when you do, pray don't omit the Viscount.  I can't lose my chance
of going down to posterity.'
He went his way, while Isabel repaired to the Terrace, and found
Charlotte awaiting her answer in much trepidation.
The low wages, instead of none at all, were a great disappointment,
doing away with all the honour and sentiment, and merely degrading her
in the eyes of her companions; but her attachment conquered this
objection, and face to face with her mistress, the affectation
departed, and left remaining such honest and sincere faithfulness and
affection, that Isabel felt as if a valuable and noble-hearted friend
had suddenly been made known to her.  It was a silly little fanciful
heart, but it was sound to the core; and when Isabel said,  'There will
be very hard work, Charlotte, but we will try to do our best for Mr.
Frost and the children, and we will help each other,' Charlotte felt as
if no task could be too hard if it were to be met with such a look and
smile.
'Is it settled?' asked Lord Fitzjocelyn, as Charlotte opened the door
for him.
'Oh, yes, thank you, my Lord--'
'But, Charlotte, one thing is decided.  Mrs. Frost can afford no more
eau de Cologne.  The first hysterics and you go!'
He passed upstairs, and found Isabel beginning to dismantle the
drawing-room--'Which you arranged for us!' she said.
A long, deep sigh was the answer, and Louis mused for some moments ere
he said--'It is hard work to say good-bye to trifles with which
departed happiness seems connected.'
'Oh, no!' cried Isabel, eagerly.  'With such a home, the happiness
cannot be departed.'
'No, not with such a home!' said Louis, with a melancholy smile; 'but I
was selfish enough to be thinking who hung that picture--'
'I don't think you were the selfish person,' said Isabel.
'Patience and work!' said Louis, rousing himself.  'Some sort of good
time must come,'--and he quickly put his hand to assist in putting
the Dresden shepherd and shepherdess into retirement, observing that
they seemed the genii of the place, and he set his mind on their
restoration.
'I do not think,' said Isabel, as she afterwards narrated this scene to
her husband, 'that I ever realized his being so much attached to Mary
Ponsonby; I thought it was a convenient suitable thing in which he
followed his father's wishes, and I imagined he had quite recovered it.'
'He did not look interesting enough?  Yes! he was slow in knowing his
own mind; but his heart once given there is no recalling it, whatever
his father may wish.'
'Or my mother,' said Isabel, smiling.
'Ah!  I have never asked you what your party say of him in the London
world.'
'They say he quite provokes them by being such a diligent member, and
that people debate as to whether he will distinguish himself.  Some say
he does not care enough, and others, that he has too many crotchets.'
'Just so!  Public men are not made of that soft, scrupulous stuff,
which only hardens and toughens when principle is clear before him.
Well, as to society--'
'Virginia says he is hardly ever to be had; he is either at the House,
or he has something to do for his father; he slips out of parties, and
they never catch him unless they are in great want of a gentleman to
take them somewhere, and then no one is so useful. Mamma has been
setting innumerable little traps for him, but he marches straight
through them all, and only a little tone of irony betrays that he sees
through them.  Every one likes him, and the only complaint is, that he
is so seldom to be seen, keeping almost entirely to his father's set,
always with his father--'
'Ay! I can bear to watch his submission better than formerly.  His
attentions are in such perfect good taste that they are quite
beautiful; and his lordship has quite ceased snubbing, and begins to
have a glimmering that when Louis says something never dreamt of in his
philosophy, the defect may be in his understanding, and not in
Fitzjocelyn's.'
'I could excuse him for not always understanding Fitzjocelyn!  But
there never were two kinder people in the world; and I could not have
imagined that I should ever like Lord Ormersfield half so much.'
'He is improved.  Louis's exclusive devotion has not been lost on him.
Holdsworth has been sitting with me, and talking of the great change in
the parish.  He told me that at his first arrival here, seven years
ago, when he was very young, he found himself quite disheartened and
disgusted by the respectability of the place.  Every one was cold,
distant, correct, and self-esteeming; so perfectly contented with
themselves and the routine, that he felt all his ardour thrown  away,
and it seemed to him that he was pastor to a steam-engine--a mere item
in the proprieties of Ormersfield.  He was almost ready to exchange,
out of weariness and impatience, when Fitzjocelyn came home, and awoke
fresh life and interest by his absurdities, his wonderful
philanthropies, and extraordinary schemes. His sympathy and earnestness
were the first refreshment and encouragement; and Holdsworth declares
that no one can guess the benefit that he was to him even when he was
most ridiculous.  Since that, he says, the change has been striking,
though so gradual. Louis has all the same freshness and energy, but
without the fluctuation and impetuosity.  And his example of humility
and sincerity has worked, not only in reclaiming the wild outlying
people, but even awakening the comfortable dependents from their
self-satisfaction.  Even Frampton is far from the impenetrable person
he used to be.'
'And I suppose they have done infinite good to the wild Marksedge
people!'
'Some are better, some are worse.  I believe that people always are
worse when they reject good.  I am glad to find, too, that the
improvements answer in a pecuniary point of view.  His Lordship is
amazed at his son's sagacity, and they have never been so much at ease
in money matters.'
'Indeed!  Well, I must own that I have always been struck with the very
small scale on which things are done here.  Just the mere margin of
what is required by their station, barely an indulgence!'
'I fancy you must look into subscriptions for Fitzjocelyn's means,'
said James; 'and for the rest, they have no heart for new furniture
till he marries.'
'Well!  I wonder if Mary is worth so much heart!  It might be the best
thing for him if she would find some worthy merchant.  He is very young
still, and looks younger.  I should like him to begin the world again.'
'Ha!  Isabel, you want to cook up a romance of your own for him.'
James was recovering cheerfulness.  He thought he was bracing himself
to bear bravely with an unmerited wrong.  The injustice of his sentence
hid from him the degree of justice; and with regard to his own temper,
he knew better what he restrained than what he expressed, and
habitually gave himself credit for what he did not say or do. There was
much that was really good in his present spirit, and it was on the way
to be better; but his was not the character to be materially altered by
the first brunt of a sudden shock.  It was a step that he had brought
himself to forgive the trustees.  He did not yet see that he had any
need to be forgiven.
At the end of three weeks James and Isabel returned to their home, and
to their new way of life; and Fitzjocelyn had only time to see that
they were beginning their struggle with good courage, before the
meeting of Parliament summoned him to London.
Isabel fully justified Miss Faithfull's prediction.  She was too truly
high-minded to think any task beneath her; and with her heart in, not
out of her immediate work, she could not fail to be a happier woman.
Success gave as much pleasure in a household duty as in an
accomplishment--nay, far more when it was a victory over herself, and
an increase to the comfort of her husband.  Her strength was much
tried, and the children often fatigued and harassed her; but there was
unspeakable compensation in their fondness and dependence on her, and
even in the actual services themselves.  The only wonder began to be
how she could have ever trusted them in any hands but her own. Her
husband's affection and consideration were sources of joy ever renewed;
and though natural irritability and pressing anxieties might now and
then betray him into a hasty word, his penitence so far surpassed the
momentary pain it might have cost her, that she was obliged to do her
utmost to comfort him.  She sometimes found herself awkward or
ignorant, and sometimes flagged from over-exertion; yet throughout,
James's approval, and her own sense that she was striving to do her
best, kept her mind at rest.  Above all, the secret of her happiness
was, that the shock of adversity had awakened her from her previous
deadness and sluggishness of soul, and made her alive to a feeling of
trust and support, a frame of mind ever repenting, ever striving
onwards.  Thus she went bravely through the very class of trials that
she would once have thought merely lowering, inglorious, and devoid of
poetry.  What would have been in itself sordid, gained a sweetness from
the light of love and duty, and never in all her dreamy ease had she
been as cheerful and lighthearted as in the midst of hardship and rigid
economy.  Her equable temper and calm composure came to her aid; and
where a more nervous and excitable woman would have preyed upon
herself, and sunk under imaginary troubles, she was always ready to
soothe and sustain the anxious and sensitive nature of her husband.
After all, hers was the lightest share of the trial. To her, the call
was to act, and to undergo misfortunes occasioned by no fault of hers;
to him, the call was the one most galling to an active and eager
man--namely, to endure, and worse, to see endured, the penalty of his
own errors.  In vain did he seek for employment. A curacy, without a
fair emolument, would have been greater poverty than their present
condition, as long as the house was unlet; and, though he answered
advertisements and made applications, the only eligible situations
failed; and he knew, among so many candidates, the last to be chosen
would be a person of violent temper, unable to bear rebuke.
Disappointment came upon disappointment, and the literary work, with
which, through Louis's exertions, he had been supplied, was not likely
to bring in any speedy return.
All that he could do was to take more than his part in domestic
trifles, such as most men would have scorned, and to relieve his wife
as far as possible of the children, often at the cost of his writing.
He bore the brunt of many a trial of which she was scarcely
aware--slights from the harsh vulgar, and compassion from the kind
vulgar; and the proud self-assertion was gone which had hardened him to
all such stings.  To his lot fell the misery of weighing and balancing
what comforts could best be cut off without positive injury to his wife
and little ones.  To consider whether an empty house should be repaired
for a doubtful tenant, to make the venture, and have it rejected, was a
severe vexation, when the expense trenched on absolute necessaries, and
hardly less trying was it to be forced to accept the rent of the House
Beautiful, knowing how ill it could be spared; and yet, that without it
he must lapse into the hopeless abyss of debt.  Moreover, there was
The terrible heart thrill
To have no power of giving
to some of the poor who had learnt to look to the Terrace in his
grandmother's time, and meals were curtailed, that those in greater
need might not be left quite unaided.
Nor was this the only cause for which James underwent actual stern
privation.  The reign of bad cookery was over.  Charlotte, if
unmethodical, was delicately neat; and though she kept them waiting for
their dinner, always served it up with the precision of past
prosperity.  Cheap cookery and cottage economy were the study, and the
results were pronounced admirable; but the master was the dispenser;
and when a modicum of meat was to make nourishing a mountain of rice,
or an ocean of broth, it would occur to him, as he helped Isabel, that
the piece de resistance would hardly hold out for the kitchen
devourers.  He would take the recipe at its word, and dine on the
surrounding structure; and in spite of the cottage economy, he was
nearly as hungry after dinner as before it, and people began to say
that he had never recovered his looks since his illness.  These daily
petty acts of self-denial and self-restraint had begun to tame his
spirit and open his eyes in a manner that neither precept nor example
had yet effected.
Charlotte had imbibed to the full the spirit of patient exertion which
pervaded the house.  Mrs. Martha had told her she was a foolish girl,
and would be tired of the place in a fortnight; but when she did not
see her tired, she would often rush in after her two mistresses were
shut up for the evening, scold Charlotte for her want of method, and
finish all that was left undone, while Charlotte went up to the nursery
to release her mistress.  As to novels and sentiment, they had gone
after Sir Hubert; and though Charlotte was what Martha expressively
called 'fairly run off her feet,' she had never looked better nor
happier.  Her mistress treated her like a friend; she doted on the
children, and the cook was out of the kitchen; Delaford was off her
mind, and neither stairs nor even knife-cleaning could hurt her
feelings.  To be sure, her subordinate, a raw girl from Marksgedge,
devoured all that was set before her, and what was not eatable, she
broke; but as she had been sent from home with no injunctions but to
'look sharp and get stout,' so she was only fulfilling her vocation,
and on some question of beer, her mother came and raved at Charlotte,
and would have raved at Mrs. Frost, if her dignified presence had not
overawed her.  So she only took the girl away in offence, and Charlotte
was much happier with an occasional charwoman to share her labours.
There was much happiness in No. 5, notwithstanding that the spring and
summer of 1851 were very hard times; and perhaps felt the more, because
the sunny presence of Louis Fitzjocelyn did not shine there as usual.
He was detained in London all the Easter recess by his father's
illness.  Lord Ormersfield was bound hand and foot by a severe attack
of rheumatism, caught almost immediately after his going to London. It
seemed to have taken a strong hold of his constitution, and lingered on
for weeks, so that he could barely move from his armchair by the fire,
and began to give himself up as henceforth to be a crippled old man--a
view out of which Louis and Sir Miles Oakstead tried by turns to laugh
him; indeed, Sir Miles accused him of wanting to continue his monopoly
of his son--and of that doubly-devoted attention by which Louis
enlivened his convalescence.
Society had very little chance with Fitzjocelyn now, unless he was
fairly hunted out by the Earl, who was always haunted by ungrounded
alarms for his health and spirits, and never allowed him to fail in the
morning rides, which were in fact his great refreshment, as much from
the quiet and the change of scene, as from the mere air and exercise.
'Father,' said he, coming in one day a little after Easter, 'you are a
very wise man!'
'Eh!' said the Earl, looking up in wonder and expectation excited by
this prelude, hoping for the fulfilment of some political prediction.
'He is a wise man,' proceeded Louis, 'who does not put faith in
treasures, especially butlers; also, who does not bring a schoolboy to
London with nothing to do!'
'What now?' said the Earl.  'Is young Conway in a scrape?'
'I am,' said Fitzjocelyn; 'I have made a discovery, and I don't exactly
see what to do with it.  You see I have been taking the boy out riding
with me, as the only thing I could well do for him these holidays.  You
must know he is very good and patronizing; I believe he thinks he could
put me up to a few things in time.  Well, to-day, as we passed a
questionable-looking individual, Walter bowed, as if highly elated by
the honour of his acquaintance, and explained to me that he was the
celebrated--I forget who, but that's owing to my defective education.
The fact is, that this Delaford, to whom my aunt implicitly trusts, has
been introducing this unlucky boy to a practical course of Bell's
Life--things that I went through Eton, and never even heard of.'  And
he detailed some of them.
'No more than she might have expected,' said Lord Ormersfield.
'And what is to be done?'
'I should say, never interfere between people and their servants, still
less between them and their sons.  You will do no good.'
'I cannot see this go on!' cried Louis.  'The boy told me all, by way
of showing me his superiority.  I believe he wants to introduce me to
some of his distinguished friends.  They flatter him, and make him a
great man; and as to any scruples about his mother, Delaford has
disposed of her objections as delicate weaknesses.  When I began to
look grave, the poor boy set it down to my neglected training, always
spending my holidays in the country, and not knowing what fast men are
up to.'
'And so he goes to destruction--just the sort of boy that does,' said
the Earl, with due acquiescence in the course of the world.
'He need not,' exclaimed Louis.  'He is a nice boy, a very nice boy, if
only he cared for his mother, or knew right from wrong.'
Lord Ormersfield smiled at these slight exceptions.
'He is heartily fond of Isabel,' said Louis.  'If I thought Jem could
do any good, I would send for him; but he has made my aunt so much
afraid of unworldliness just now, that I only wonder she lets Miss King
stay on.'
'You had better leave it alone,' said the Earl, 'unless you can do
anything with the boy.  I am glad that I am not his guardian!'
'I wish I was,' sighed Louis.
'I suppose you will grow older some day,' said Lord Ormersfield.
'However, I see you will not be contented without going your own way to
work.'
'When the Earl saw his son the next day, Louis looked radiant at having
taken one step.  He had seen his aunt, and she had endured the
revelation with more equanimity than he could have supposed possible.
'It was a house where they took things easily,' as he said; a house
where nothing was more feared than a scene; and Lady Conway had thanked
her nephew greatly for his communication; promised what he did not ask,
that he should not be betrayed to Walter; assured him that the butler
should be dismissed, without giving any reason, before the summer
holidays; and for the few remaining days before Walter returned to
Eton, she thought she might reckon on her dear Fitzjocelyn for keeping
his eye upon him: no doubt all would be right when Delaford was once
gone.
It was the old want of a high standard--the love of ease rather than
the love of right.  The Earl laughed at her short-sighted policy, and
resented her saddling Louis with the care of her son; while Louis
philosophized upon good-nature, and its use and abuse.
Whether Mr. Delaford learnt that Sir Walter had betrayed him to Lord
Fitzjocelyn, or whether he took alarm from the young gentleman being
kept under surveillance, he scented danger; and took the initiative, by
announcing to my Lady that he intended to retire from his situation
into private life at the month's end.
Lady Conway rejoiced in being spared the fabrication by which she had
intended to dismiss her paragon without hurting his feelings, thanked
Fitzjocelyn more than ever, and was sure that dear Walter would do very
well.
But no sooner had Delaford departed than a series of discoveries began
to be made.  Lady Conway's bills reached back to dates far beyond those
of the cheques which she had put into Delaford's hands to pay them, and
a tissue of peculation began to reveal itself, so alarming and
bewildering to her, that she implored her nephew to investigate it for
her.
Louis, rather against the will of his father, who was jealous of any
additional tasks thrown on him, entered into the matter with the head
of an accountant, and the zeal of a pursuer of justice; and stirred up
a frightful mass of petty and unblushing fraud, long practised as a
mere matter of course upon the mistress, who had set the example of
easy-going, insincere self-seeking.  It involved the whole household so
completely, that there was no alternative but a clearance of every
servant, whether innocent or guilty, and a fresh beginning.  Indeed, so
great had been the debts which had accumulated, that there was no doubt
that the treacherous butler must have been gambling to a great extent
with his mistress's money; and the loss was so heavy that Lady Conway
found she should be obliged to retrench, 'just when she should have
been so glad to have helped poor dear Isabel!'  She must even give up a
season in London, but dear Virginia was far too good and sensible to
repine.
Lord Ormersfield, who had become much interested in the investigation,
and assisted much by his advice, wanted her to go to Thornton Conway;
and Louis urged the step warmly as the best hope for Walter.  But she
could not live there, she said, without far too heavy an expenditure;
and she would make visits for the present, and find some cheap place
abroad, where the girls could have masters.
And so her establishment was broken up, and Louis wrote warm
congratulations to James that poor little Charlotte had not been
tempted into the robber's den.  Isabel could not help reading the whole
history to Charlotte, who turned white at the notion of such
wickedness, and could hardly utter a word; though afterwards, as she
sat rocking little Mercy to sleep, she bestowed a great deal of good
advice on her, 'never to mind what nobody said to her, above all, when
they talked like a book, for there were a great many snakes and vipers
in the grass, and 'twas best to know good friends when one had them.'
And coupled with her moralizing, there was no small degree of humble
thankfulness for the impulse that had directed her away from the evil.
How could she ever have met Tom again if she had shared in the stigma
on the dishonest household?  Simple-hearted loyalty had been a guard
against more perils than she had even imagined!
CHAPTER XVI.
THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.
This Valley is that from whence also the King will give to His their
Vineyards; and they that go through it shall sing, as Christian did,
for all he met with Apollyon.--Pilgrim's Progress.
The close of the session still found Lord Ormersfield so stiff, bent,
and suffering, that Louis with some difficulty persuaded him into
trying the experiment of foreign baths, and in a few weeks' time they
were both established at the Hotel du Grand Monarque at Aix-la-Chapelle.
The removing his son to a dull watering-place, when he had so many
avocations at home, had been a great vexation to the Earl; but he was
delighted at the versatile spirits which made a holiday and delight of
the whole, and found an endless fund of interest and occupation even in
his attendance on the wearisome routine of health-seeking. German
books, natural history, the associations of the place, and the
ever-fresh study of the inhabitants and the visitors, were food enough
for his lively conversation; and the Earl, inspirited by improving
health, thought he had never enjoyed his son so much.
They were already old inhabitants of their hotel, when one afternoon
they were much amused by finding a consequential courier gesticulating
vehemently to the whole establishment on the apartments he was to
secure for a superb Milord Anglais, who seemed to require half the
hotel.  Their sitting-room, overlooking the court, was especially
coveted, and the landlord even followed them upstairs with many excuses
to ask if they could exchange it for another for only two days.  Lord
Ormersfield's negative had all the exceeding politeness of offended
dignity; and Louis was much amused at the surmises, with which he
consoled himself, that this was nothing but some trumpery speculator,
most likely a successful quack doctor--no one else went about in such a
style.
In a grave, grand way, he was not a little curious, and took care to
place himself where he could command a view of the court; while Louis,
making no secret of his own amusement, worked up an excitement to
entertain his father, and stood watching at the window.
'Crack! crack! there are the postilion's whips!  Now for the Grand
Monarque himself--thundering under the archway!  Why, there are only
two of them, after all!--a lady and a little yellow old man!  Father,
you are right after all--he is the very pattern of a successful quack!
How tall the lady is!  Halloo!' and he stood transfixed for a moment,
then sprang to the door, replying to his father's astonished
question--'Clara!  Clara Dynevor!'
The party were in course of proceeding up the principal staircase--the
tall figure of a young lady in mourning moving on with so stately, so
quiet, and almost weary a manner, that Louis for a moment drew back,
doubting whether the remarkable height had not deceived him.  Her head
was turned away, and she was following the host, scarcely exerting
herself to gaze round, when she came close to the open door, where
Louis moved slightly forwards.  There was a little ecstatic shriek, and
both her hands were clasped in his, while her face was glowing with
animation and delight.
'I don't know how to believe it!' she said; 'can you be here?'
'We are curing my father.  Had you not heard of his illness?'
'I hear nothing,' said Clara, sadly, as she held out her hand to Lord
Ormersfield, who had also come to meet her; and her uncle, who followed
close behind, was full of cordial rejoicings on the encounter.
There was Jane Beckett also, whom Louis next intercepted on her way to
the bedrooms, laden with bags, and smiling most joyously to see him.
'To be sure, my young Lord!  And your papa here too, my Lord! Well!
who'll be coming abroad next, I wonder?'
'I wonder at nothing since I have met you here, Jane.'
'And I am right glad of it, my Lord.  You'll cheer up poor Miss Clara a
bit, I hope--for--Bless me! wont those Frenchmen never learn to carry
that box right side up?'
And off rushed Jane to a never-ending war of many tongues in defence of
Clara's finery; while Louis, following into the sitting-room, found Mr.
Dynevor inviting his father to the private dinner which he had ordered
for greater dignity.
The proposal was accepted for the sake of spending the evening
together, but little was thus gained; for, excepting for that one
little scream, Louis would hardly have felt himself in the company of
his Giraffe.  She had become a very fine-looking person, not quite
handsome, but not many degrees from it, and set off by profuse hair,
and every advantage of figure and dress; while her manner was
self-possessed and formal, indifferent towards ordinary people, but
warm and coaxing towards her uncle.  Blunt--almost morose to others--he
was fondling and affectionate towards her; continually looking at the
others as if to claim admiration of her, appealing to her every moment,
and even when talking himself, his keen eye still seeming to watch
every word or gesture.
The talk was all Switzerland and Italy--routes and pictures, mountains
and cathedrals--all by rote, and with no spirit nor heart in the
discussion--not a single word coming near home, nothing to show that
Dynevor Terrace had any existence.  Louis bade Clara good-night,
mortified at the absence of all token of feeling for her brother, and
more than half repenting his advice to remain with her uncle.  How
could the warm-hearted girl have become this cold, haughty being,
speaking by mechanism?  He scarcely felt inclined to see her again; but
early the next morning, as he was at breakfast with his father, there
was a knock at the door, and a voice said, 'May I come in?' and as
Louis opened, there stood the true Clara, all blushes and abruptness.
'I beg your pardon if it is wrong,' she said, 'but I could not help it.
I must hear of him--of James.'
Lord Ormersfield welcomed her in an almost fatherly manner, and made
her sit down, telling her that she had come at a good moment, since
Louis had just received a letter; but he feared that it was not a very
good account of Isabel.
'Isabel!  Is anything the matter?'
'You are behindhand.  Had you not heard of the arrival of number four?'
'I never hear anything,' said Clara, her eyes overflowing.
'Ha! not since we last met?' asked the Earl.
'They wrote once or twice; but you know they thought me wrong, and it
has all died away since I went abroad.  The last letter I had was dated
in November.'
'You know nothing since that time!'
'No; I often thought of writing to Miss Faithfull, but I could not bear
to show how it was, since they would not answer me.  So I made bold to
come to you, for I cannot ask before my uncle.  He is quite passionate
at the very name.'
'He is kind to you?' asked Lord Ormersfield, hastily.
'Most kind, except for that, the only thing I care about.  But you have
a letter!  Oh! I am famishing to hear of them!'
She did not even know of the loss of the school; and her distress was
extreme as she heard of their straits.  'It must be killing Isabel,'
she said; 'if I could but be at home to work for her!'
'Isabel has come out beyond all praise,' said Louis.  'I am afraid
there is much for them to undergo; but I do believe they are much
happier in the midst of it.'
'Everybody must be happy in Dynevor Terrace,' said Clara.
Louis shook his head and smiled, adding, 'But, Clara, I do believe, if
it were to come over again, Jem would hardly act in the same way.'
'Do you think he has forgiven me?'
'Judge for yourself.'
Her hand trembling, she caught at the well-known handwriting that to
her seemed as if it could hardly be the property of any one else; and
it was well for her that Louis had partly prepared her for the tone of
depression, and the heavy trials it revealed, when she had been
figuring to herself the writer enjoying all the felicity from which she
was banished.
'No. 5, Dynevor Terrace, Sept. 14th, 1851.
'Dear Fitzjocelyn,--I ought to have written yesterday; but I took the
whole duty at Ormersfield on Sunday, and was too lazy the next day to
do more than keep the children out of the way, and look after Isabel;
for, though I am told not to be uneasy, she does not regain strength as
she has done before.  Over-exertion, or bad nursing, one or both, tell
upon her; and I wish we may not have too dear a bargain in the nurse
whom she chose for cheapness' sake.  My lectures were to have paid the
expenses, but the author's need is not always the first consideration;
the money will not be forthcoming till Christmas, and meantime we
cannot launch out.  However, Ormersfield partridges are excellent fare
for Isabel, and I could return thanks for the abundant supply that
would almost seem disproportionate; but you can guess the value as
substantial comforts.  A box of uneatable grouse from Beauchastel,
carriage twelve shillings, was a cruel subject of gratitude; but those
good people mean more kindly than I deserve; and when Isabel is well
again, we shall rub on.  This little one promises more resemblance to
her than the others.  We propose to call her Frances, after my poor
mother and sister.  Do you remember the thrill of meeting their names
in Cheveleigh church?  That memorial was well done of my uncle.  If
these children were to be left as we were, you would, I know, be their
best friend; but I have a certain desire to see your own assurance to
that effect.  Don't fancy this any foreboding, but four daughters bind
a man to life, and I sometimes feel as if I hardly deserved to see good
days.  If I am spared to bring up these children, I hope to make them
understand the difference between independence and pride.
'I have been looking back on my life; I have had plenty of time during
these months of inaction, which I begin to see were fit discipline.
Till Holdsworth left his parish under my charge the other day for six
weeks, I have exercised no office of my ministry, as you know that Mr.
Purvis's tone with me cut me off from anything that could seem like
meddling with him.  I never felt more grateful to any man than I did
when Holdsworth made the proposal.  It was as if my penance were
accepted for the spirit against which you too justly warned me before
my Ordination.  Sunday was something between a very sorrowful and a
very happy day.
'I did not see the whole truth at first.  I was only aware of my
unhappy temper, which had provoked the immediate punishment; but the
effort (generally a failure) to prevent my irritability from adding to
the distresses I had brought on my poor wife, opened my eyes to much
that I had never understood.  Yet I had presumed to become an
instructor--I deemed myself irreproachable!
'I believe the origin of the whole was, that I never distinguished a
fierce spirit of self-exaltation from my grandmother's noble resolution
to be independent.  It was a demon which took the semblance of good,
and left no room for demons of a baser sort.  Even as a boy at the
Grammar-school, I kept out of evil from the pride of proving myself
gentlemanly under any circumstances; the motive was not a bit better
than that which made me bully you.   I can never remember being without
an angry and injured feeling that my uncle's neglect left my
grandmother burdened, and obliged me to receive an inferior education;
and with this, a certain hope that he would never put himself in the
right, nor lay me under obligations.  You saw how this motive actuated
me, when I never discerned it. I trust that I was not insincere, though
presumptuous and self-deceiving I was to an extent which I can only
remember with horror.  If it approached to sacrilege, may the wilful
blindness be forgiven!  At least, I knew it not; and with all my heart
I meant to fulfil the vows I had taken on me.  Thus, when my uncle
actually returned, there was a species of revengeful satisfaction in
making my profession interfere with his views, when he had made it the
only one eligible for me.  How ill I behaved--how obstinately I set
myself against all mediation--how I wrapped myself in
self-approval--you know better than I do.  My conceit, and absurdity,
and thanklessness, have risen up before me; and I remember offers that
would have involved no sacrifice of my clerical obligations--offers
that I would not even consider--classing them all as 'mere truckling
with my conscience.'  What did I take for a conscience?
'Ever since, things have gone from bad to worse, grieving my dear
grandmother's last year, and estranging me from my poor little sister
because she would not follow my dictation.  At last my sins brought
down the penalty, and I would not grieve except for the innocent who
suffer with me.  Perhaps, but for them, I should never have felt it.
Nor do I feel tempted to murmur; for there is a strange peace with us
throughout, in spite of a sad heart and too many explosions of my
miserable temper, and the sight of the hardships so bravely met by my
dear wife.  But for all this, I should never have known what she is!
She whispered to me last evening, when she saw me looking tired and
depressed, that she had no fears for the future, for this had been the
happiest year of her life.  Nothing can make her forget to soothe me!
'I have written a long rigmarole all about myself; but an outpouring is
sometimes a relief, and you have borne with me often enough to do so
now.  My poor Clara's pardon, and some kind of clerical duty, are my
chief wishes; but my failures in the early part of the year have taught
me how unworthy I am to stir a step in soliciting anything of the kind.
Did I tell you how some ten of the boys continue to touch their hats to
me? and Smith, the butcher's son, often comes to borrow a book, and
consult me on some of the difficulties that his father throws in his
way.  He is a fine fellow, and at least I hope that my two years at the
school did him no harm.  I was much impressed with the orderliness at
Ormersfield Sunday-school.  I wish I could have got half as much
religious knowledge into my poor boys.  I walked through your turnips
in the South field, and thought they wanted rain.  Frampton tells me
the Inglewood harvest is in very good condition; but I will see the
bailiff, and give you more particulars, when I can be better spared
from home for a few hours.  Kitty's assistance in writing has
discomposed these last few lines.
'Yours ever,
'J.R.F.D.'
Clara turned away and groaned aloud several times as she read; but all
she said, as she gave it back to Louis, was, 'What is to be done? You
must talk to my uncle.'
'Ah, Clara! young gentlemen of the nineteenth century make but a bad
hand of the part of benevolent fairy.'
'I don't think my speaking would be of any use,' said Clara.  'Oh, if
this only would have been a boy!'
Lord Ormersfield undertook to sound Mr. Dynevor, and found an early
opportunity of asking whether he had heard of poor James's misfortune.
Yes, he had known it long ago.  No wonder, with such a temper.  Kept it
from the child, though.  Would not have her always hankering after them.
Was he aware of his great distress and difficulties?  Ha, ha! thought
so!  Fine lady wife!  No end of children--served him right!--to bring
down his pride.
Lord Ormersfield hazarded a hint that James had seen his errors, and
the school was no longer in the way.
'No, no!' said Oliver.  'Too late now.  Drink as he has brewed.  He
should have thought twice before he broke my poor mother's heart with
his cantankerous ways.  Cheveleigh beneath him, forsooth!  I'm not
going to have it cut up for a lot of trumpery girls!  I've settled the
property and whatever other pickings there may be upon my little
Clara--grateful, and worthy of it!  Her husband shall take Dynevor name
and arms--unless, to be sure, he had a title of his own.  The girl was
much admired at Rome last winter, had a fair offer or two, but not a
word will she say to any of them.  I can't tell what's in her head, not
I!'
And he looked knowingly at Lord Ormersfield, and willingly extended his
stay at Aix-la-Chapelle, letting Fitzjocelyn organize expeditions from
thence to Liege and other places in the neighbourhood.
The two cousins were so glad to be together, and the Earl so much
pleased that Louis should have anything which gave him so much delight
as this meeting with his old playfellow, that he did all in his power
to facilitate and prolong their intercourse.  He often sacrificed
himself to Oliver's prosings on the Equatorial navigation, that the two
young people might be at liberty; and he invited Clara to their early
breakfast and walk before her uncle wanted her in the morning.  These
were Clara's times of greatest happiness, except that it gave her a new
and strange sensation to be talked to by his lordship like a
grown-up--nay, a sensible woman.  Once she said to herself, laughing,
'He really treats me almost as if I were poor Mary herself.'  And then
came another flash: 'Perhaps he would even like me on the same terms!'
And then she laughed again, and shook her head:  'No, no, my Lord, your
son is much too good for that!  Uncle Oliver would not have looked so
benignant at us when we were sitting in the gardens last night, if he
had known that I was giving Louis all my Lima letters.  I wish they
were more worth having!  It was very stupid of me not to know Mary
better, so that we write like two old almanacs.  However, my letter
from hence will be worth its journey to Peru.'
Clara's heart was several degrees lighter, both from the pleasure of
the meeting and a suggestion of the Earl's, upon which she had at once
acted, and which seemed, even as she laid pen to paper, to bring her
somewhat nearer to her brother.
Her letter arrived at No. 5, on the next Monday morning at
breakfast-time.  It did not at first attract the attention of James.
The Sunday exertions had again left a mental and physical lassitude,
showing how much care and privation had told upon his strength; and
Isabel's still tardy convalescence weighed him down with anxiety for
the future, and almost with despair, as he thought of the comforts for
want of which she suffered, though so patiently and silently dispensing
with them.  To his further vexation, he had, on the previous Saturday,
seen Charlotte receiving at the back-door an amount of meat beyond her
orders; and, having checked himself because too angry and too much
grieved to speak at once, had reserved the reproof for the Monday, when
Charlotte brought in her book of petty disbursements.
Failing to detect the obnoxious item, he said, 'Where's the account of
the meat that came in on Saturday?'
'There, sir!' said Charlotte, indicating the legitimate amount, but
blushing violently.
'That was not all?' he said, with a look of stern, interrogation.
'Oh! if you please, sir, that was nothing!'
'This will not do, Charlotte!  I can have nothing taken into my house
without being paid for.  I insist on knowing what you could mean?'
'Oh, sir!' tearfully exclaimed the girl, 'it is paid for--I'll show you
the account, if you will--with my own money.  I'd not have had you hear
of it for the world; but I could not bear that nurse's insinuations
about her meat five times a-day--she that never nursed nothing like a
real lady before!  But I meant no harm, sir; and I hope you'll excuse
the liberty, for I did not mean to take none; and I'm sure I'm quite
contented for my own part, nor never meant to complain.'
'I know you did not, Charlotte!  You are only too patient and kind--'
But his voice broke down, and he was forced silently to sign to her to
leave him.
'Can humiliation go farther!' he thought.  'My boasted independence
ending in this poor, faithful servant being stung, by the sneers of
this hired woman, into eking out her scanty meals with her own
insufficient wages!'
Little Catharine, who had been gazing with dilated black eyes, came
scrambling on his knee to caress him, perceiving that he was grieved.
'Ah!  Kitty, Kitty!' he said, 'it is well that you are too young to
feel these troubles!'
'Papa! letter!' cried Kitty, waving the unregarded letter in the
triumph of discovery.
'The Reverend James Frost.'  It was the writing formed by his own
copies, which he could not see without a sharp pang of self-reproach
for cruel injustice and unkindness.
Kitty slid down with the empty envelope to act reading to the twins,
whom she caught by turns as they crawled away, and set up straight
before her.  Her operations and their remonstrances, though as loud as
they were inarticulate, passed utterly unheard and unheeded by their
father, as he read:--
'Hotel du Grand Monarque. Aix-la-Chapelle,
Sept. 18th.
'My Dearest James,--As a mere matter of honesty and justice, I may
venture to write to you.  You always accepted from dear grandmamma the
income from the money in the Stocks.  I did not know that half of it
has since come to me, till Lord Ormersfield paid me this last year's
dividend; and if you will not have his enclosed cheque for it, put it
in the fire, for I will never have it in any form.  It is not my
uncle's, but my own; and if you would make me very happy, write to me
here.  You must not suppose that I am trying to buy a letter; but I
look on this as yours, and I thought you had it till Lord Ormersfield
told me about it.  We met him and Louis quite unexpectedly--the best
thing that has happened to me for years, though they told me much that
grieves me exceedingly--but I cannot write about it till I know that I
may.  Tell me of dear Isabel and the babes.  My heart yearns after
them! it would leap up at the sight of a stone from the Terrace!
'Your ever affectionate
'Clara.'
His first impulse was, as though he feared to repent, to turn to his
desk, the tears of feeling still in his eyes, and dash off these
words:--
'Your bounty, my dearest sister, is scarcely less welcome than the
forgiving spirit which prompted it.  I will not conceal that I was
sorely in need of means to supply Isabel with the comforts that she
requires.  That your affection can survive my treatment last year,
makes me equally grateful to you and ashamed of what then took place.'
He scarcely dared to look upon those phrases.  Great as were his needs,
and kindly as the proffer was made, it was new and painful to him to be
under any such obligation, and he could hardly bend his spirit to know
that never again should he be able to feel that he had never been
beholden for money to a living creature.  And while he felt it due to
his sister to own the full extent of the benefit, he weighed his words
as he wrote on, lest the simplest facts should look like a craving for
further assistance.
Charlotte came up to remove the breakfast, and he looked up to give an
order for some nourishing dainty for her mistress, adding, 'What did
that mutton come to?  No, I am not displeased with you, but Miss Clara
has sent me some money.'
His assurance was needed, for Charlotte went down thinking she had
never seen master look so stern.  He had spoken from a sense that the
truth was due to the generous girl, but each word had been intense
pain.  He wrote on, often interrupted by little riots among the
children, and finally by a sharp contention, the twins having possessed
themselves of a paper-knife, which Kitty, with precocious notions of
discipline, considered as forbidden; and little Mercy was rapped over
the fingers in the struggle.  The roar brought down interference, and
Kitty fell into disgrace; but when, after long persuasion, she was
induced to yield the paper-cutter, kiss and make friends, Mercy,
instead of embracing, locked her fingers into her dark curls, and
tugged at them in a way so opposite to her name, that all Kitty's
offence was forgotten in her merit for stopping her scream half-way at
the sight of her father's uplifted finger, and his whisper of 'Poor
mamma!'
That life of worry and baby squabbles, the reflection of his own
faults, was hard to bear; and with a feeling of seeking a refuge, when
the two little ones had fallen into their noonday sleep, and were left
with their mother to the care of good Miss Mercy, he set out for some
parish work at Ormersfield, still taking with him little Kitty, whose
quicksilver nature would never relieve her elders by a siesta.
He was afraid to speak to Isabel until he should have composed himself,
and, harassed and weary in spirits and in frame, he walked slowly, very
sore at the domestic discovery, and scarcely feeling the diminution of
the immediate pressure in the new sense of degradation. He could own
that it was merited, and was arguing with himself that patience and
gratitude were the needful proofs that the evil temper had been
expelled.  He called back his thankfulness for his wife's safety, his
children's health, the constancy of his kind friends, and the
undeserved ardour of his young sister's affection, as well as poor
little Charlotte's unselfishness.  The hard exasperated feeling that
once envenomed every favour, and barbed every dart that wounded him,
was gone; he could own the loving kindness bestowed on him, both from
Heaven and by man, and began to find peace and repose in culling the
low fragrant blossoms which cheered even the Valley of Humiliation.
He turned down the shady lane, overhung by the beech-trees of Mr.
Calcott's park, and as he lifted Kitty in his arms to allow her the
robin-redbreast, he did not feel out of tune with the bird's sweet
autumnal notes, nor with the child's merry little voice, but each
refreshed his worn and contrite spirit.
The sound of hoofs approaching made him turn his head; and while Kitty
announced 'horse!' and 'man!' he recognised Mr. Calcott, and felt
abashed, and willing to find a retreat from the meeting; but there was
no avoiding it, and he expected, as usual, to be passed with a bow; but
the Squire slackened his pace as he overtook him, and called out,
good-humouredly, 'Ha, Mr. Frost, good morning' (once it would have been
Jem).  'I always know you by the little lady on your shoulder.  I was
intending to call on you this afternoon on a little business; but if
you will step up to the house with me, I shall be much obliged.'
James's heart beat thick with undefined hope; but, after all, it might
be only to witness some paper.  After what had occurred, and Mrs.
Calcott considering herself affronted by Isabel, bare civility was
forgiveness; and he walked up the drive with the Squire, who had
dismounted, and was inquiring with cordial kindness for Mrs. Frost, yet
with a little awkwardness, as if uncertain on what terms they stood,
more as if he himself were to blame than the young clergyman.
Arriving at the house, James answered for his little girl's absence of
shyness, and she was turned over to the Miss Calcotts, while the Squire
conducted him to the study, and began with hesitation and something of
apology--'It had struck him--it was not worth much--he hardly liked to
propose it, and yet till something better should turn up--anything was
better than doing nothing.'  To which poor James heartily agreed.  The
board of guardians, where Mr. Calcott presided, were about to elect a
chaplain to the union workhouse; the salary would be only fifty pounds,
but if Mr. Frost would be willing to offer himself, it would be a great
blessing to the inmates, and there would be no opposition.
Mr. Calcott, making the proposal from sincere goodwill, but with some
dread how the Pendragon blood would receive it, was absolutely
astounded by the effect.
Fifty pounds additional per annum was a boon only to be appreciated
after such a pinching year as the past; the gratitude for the old
Squire's kind pardon was so strong, and the blessing of re-admission to
pastoral work touched him so deeply, that, in his weakened and dejected
state, he could not restrain his tears, nor for some moments utter a
word.  At last he said, 'Oh, Mr. Calcott, I have not deserved this at
your hands.'
'There, there,' said the Squire, trying to laugh it off, though he too
became husky, 'say no more about it.  It is a poor thing, and can't be
made better; but it will be a real kindness to us to look after the
place.'
'Let me say thus much,' said James, 'for I cannot be at peace till I
have done so--I am aware that I acted unjustifiably in that whole
affair, both when elected and dismissed.'
'No, no, don't let's go over that again!' said Mr. Calcott, in dread of
a scene.  'An over-ardent friend may be a misfortune, and you were very
young.  Not that I would have taken your resignation if it had been
left to me, but the world is grown mighty tender.  I dare say you never
flogged a boy like what I underwent fifty years ago, and was the better
for it,' and he launched into some frightful old-world stories of the
like inflictions, hoping to lead away from personalities, but James was
resolved to say what was on his mind. 'It was not severity,' he said,
'it was temper.  I richly deserved some portion of the rebuke, and it
would have been well for me if that same temper had allowed me to
listen to you, sir, or to reason.'
'Well,' said Mr. Calcott, kindly, 'you think very rightly about the
matter, and a man of six-and-twenty has time to be wiser, as I tell
Mrs. Calcott, when Sydney treats us to some of his theories.  And now
you have said your say, you must let me say mine, and that is, that
there are very few young couples--aye, or old ones--who would have had
the sense to go on as you are doing, fighting it out in your own
neighbourhood without nonsense or false shame.  I honour you and Mrs.
Frost for it, both of you!'
James coloured deeply.  He could have found commendation an
impertinence, but the old Squire was a sort of patriarch in the county,
and appreciation of Isabel's conduct must give him pleasure. He
stammered something about her having held up wonderfully, and the
salary being an immense relief, and then took refuge in matter-of-fact
inquiries on his intended functions.
This lasted till nearly half-past one, and Mr. Calcott insisted on his
staying to luncheon.   He found the ladies greatly amused with their
little guest--a very small, but extremely forward and spirited child,
not at all pretty, with her brown skin and womanly eyes, but looking
most thoroughly a lady, even in her little brown holland frock, and
white sun-bonnet, her mamma's great achievement.  Neither shy nor
sociable, she had allowed no one to touch her, but had entrenched
herself in a corner behind a chair, through the back of which she
answered all civilities, with more self-possession than distinctness,
and convulsed the party with laughing, when they asked if she could
play at bo-peep, by replying that 'the children did.' She sprang from
her place of refuge to his knee as soon as he entered, and occupied
that post all luncheon time, comporting herself with great discretion.
There was something touching in the sight of the tenderness of the
young father, taking off her bonnet, and settling her straggling curls
with no unaccustomed hands; and Mrs. Calcott's heart was moved, as she
remarked his worn, almost hollow cheeks, his eyes still quick, but sunk
and softened, his figure spare and thin, and even his dress not without
signs of poverty; and she began making kind volunteers of calling on
Mrs. Frost, nor were these received as once they would have been.
'He is the only young man,' said Mr. Calcott, standing before the fire,
with his hands behind him, as soon as the guest had departed, 'except
his cousin at Ormersfield, whom I ever knew to confess that he had been
mistaken.  That's the difference between them and the rest, not
excepting your son Sydney, Mrs. Calcott.'
Mamma and sisters cried in chorus, that Sydney had no occasion for such
confessions.
The Squire gave his short, dry laugh, and repeated that 'Jem Frost and
young Fitzjocelyn differed from other youths, not in being right but in
being wrong.'
On which topic Mrs. Calcott enlarged, compassionating poor Mr. Frost
with a double quantity of pity for his helpless beauty of a fine
lady-wife; charitably owning, however, that she really seemed improved
by her troubles.  She should have thought better of her if she had not
kept that smart housemaid, who looked so much above her station, and
whom the housekeeper had met running about the lanes in the dark, the
very night when Mr. Frost was so ill.
'Pshaw! my dear,' said her husband, 'cannot you let people be judges of
their own affairs?'
It was what he had said on the like occasions for the last thirty
years; but Mrs. Calcott was as wise as ever in other folks' matters.
The fine lady-wife had meanwhile been arranging a little surprise for
her husband.  She was too composed to harass herself at his not
returning at midday, she knew him and Kitty to be quite capable of
taking care of each other, and could imagine him detained by parish
work, and disposing of the little maiden with Betty Gervas, or some
other Ormersfield friend, but she had thought him looking fagged and
worried, she feared his being as tired as he had been on the Sunday,
and she could not bear that he should drink tea uncomfortably in the
study, tormented by the children.  So she had repaired to the parlour,
and Miss Mercy, after many remonstrances, had settled her there; and
when the good little lady had gone home to her sister's tea, Isabel lay
on the sofa, wrapped in her large soft shawl, languidly attempting a
little work, and feeling the room dreary, and herself very weak, and
forlorn, and desponding, as she thought of James's haggard face, and
the fresh anxieties that would be entailed on him if she should become
sickly and ailing.  The tear gathered on her eyelash as she said to
herself, 'I would not exert myself when I could; perhaps now I cannot,
when I would give worlds to lighten one of his cares!'  And then she
saw one little bit of furniture standing awry, in the manner that used
so often to worry his fastidious eye; and, in the spirit of doing
anything to please him, she moved across the room to rectify it, and
then sat down in the large easy chair, wearied by the slight exertion,
and becoming even more depressed and hopeless; 'though,' as she told
herself, 'all is sure to be ordered well.  The past struggle has been
good--the future will be good if we can but treat it rightly.'
Just as the last gleams were fading on the tops of the Ormersfield
coppices, she heard the hall-door, and James's footstep; and it was
more than the ordinary music of his 'coming up the stair;' there was a
spring and life in it that thrilled into her heart, and glanced in her
eye, as she sat up in her chair, to welcome him with no forced smile.
And as he came in with a pleased exclamation, his voice had no longer
the thin, worn sound, as if only resolute resignation prevented
peevishness; there was a cheerfulness and solidity in the tone, as he
came fondly to her side, regretted having missed her first appearance,
and feared she had been long alone.
'Oh, no; but I was afraid you would be so tired!  Carrying Kitty all
the way, too!  But you look so much brighter.'
'I am brighter,' said James.  'Two things have happened for which I
ought to be very thankful.  My dear, can you bear to be wife to the
chaplain of the Union at fifty pounds a-year!'
'Oh! have you something to do? cried Isabel; 'I am so glad!  Now we
shall be a little more off your mind.  And you will do so much good! I
have heard Miss Mercy say how much she wished there were some one to
put those poor people in the right way.'
'Yes; I hope that concentrated earnestness of attention may do
something to make up for my deficiency in almost every other
qualification,' said James.  'At least, I feel some of the importance
of the charge, and never was anything more welcome.'
'And how did it happen?'
'People are more forgiving than I could have hoped.  Mr. Calcott has
offered me this, in the kindest way; and as if that were not enough,
see what poor little Clara says.'
'Poor little Clara!' said Isabel, reading the letter; 'you don't mean
to disappoint her!'
'I should be a brute if I did. No; I wrote to her this morning to thank
her for her pardoning spirit.'
'You should have told me; I should like to send her my love.  I am glad
she has not quite forgotten us, though she mistook the way to her own
happiness.'
'Isabel! unless I were to transport you to Cheveleigh a year ago,
nothing would persuade you of my utter wrong-headedness.'
'Nor that, perhaps,' said Isabel, with a calm smile.
'Not my having brought you to be grateful for the Union chaplaincy?'
'Not if you had brought me to the Union literally,' said Isabel,
smiling.  'Indeed, dear James, I think we have both been so much the
better and happier for this last year, that I would not have been
without it for any consideration; and if any mistakes on your part led
to it, they were mistakes on the right side.  Don't shake your head,
for you know they were what only a good man could have made.'
'That may be all very well for a wife to believe!'
And the rest of the little dispute was concluded, as Charlotte came
smiling up with the tea.
CHAPTER XVII.
'BIDE A WEE.'
Come unto these yellow sands,
And then take hands!
Tempest
The Ponsonby family were spending the hot season at Chorillos, the
Peruvian watering-place, an irregular assembly of cane-built,
mud-besmeared ranches, close on the shore of the Pacific, with the
mountains seeming to rise immediately in the rear.
They had gone for Mr. Ponsonby's health, and Rosita's amusement; and in
the latter object they had completely succeeded.  In her bathing-dress,
full trousers, and a beautifully-embroidered blouse, belted at the
waist, a broad-brimmed straw hat, and her raven hair braided in two
long tresses, she wandered on the shore with many another fair
Limenian, or entered the sea under the protection of a brown Indian;
and, supported by mates or gourds, would float for hours together among
her companions, splashing about, and playing all sorts of frolics, like
so many mermaids.
In the evening she returned to more terrestrial joys, and arraying
herself in some of her infinite varieties of ball-dresses, with flowers
and jewels in her hair, a tiny Panama hat cocked jauntily on the top of
her head, and a rich shawl with one end thrown over the shoulder, she
would step daintily out in her black satin shoes, with old Xavier in
attendance, or sometimes with Robson as her cavalier, to meet her
friends on the beach, or make a call in the lamp-lit corridor of some
other rancho.  There were innumerable balls, dances, and pic-nics to
the rich and fertile villages and haciendas around, and fetes of every
description almost every evening; visits to the tombs of the old
Peruvians, whose graves were often rudely and lightly searched for the
sake of their curious images and golden ornaments.  The Senora declared
it was the most lovely summer she had ever spent, and that nothing
should induce her to return to Lima while her friends remained there.
The other object, of re-invigorating Mr. Ponsonby, had not been
attained.  He had been ailing for some time past, and, instead of
deriving benefit from the sea-breezes, only missed the comforts of
home.  He was so testy and exacting that Mary would have seldom liked
to leave him to himself, even if she had been disposed to lead the life
of a fish; and she was seldom away from him, unless Robson came down
from Lima to transact business with him.
Mary dreaded these interviews, for her father always emerged from them
doubly irritable and dispirited; and when Rosita claimed the Senor
Robson as her knight for her evening promenade, and the father and
daughter were left alone together, he would blame the one lady for
going, the other for staying--then draw out his papers again, and
attempt to go over them, with a head already aching and confused--be
angry at Mary's entreaties that he would lay them aside, or allow her
to help him--and presently be obliged with a sigh to desist, and lie
back in his chair, while she fanned him, or cooled his forehead with
iced water.  Yet he was always eager and excited for Robson to come;
and a delay of a day would put his temper in such a state that his wife
kept out of his sight, leaving Mary to soothe him as she might.
'Mary,' said her father one evening, when she was standing at the
window of the corridor, refreshing her eye with gazing at the glorious
sunset in the midst of a pile of crimson and purple clouds, reflected
in the ocean--'Mary, Ward is going to Mew York next week.'
'So soon?' said Mary.
'Aye, and he is coming here to-morrow to see you.'
Mary still looked out with a sort of interest to see a little gold
flake change its form as it traversed a grand violet tower.
'I hope you will make him a more reasonable answer than you did last
time,' said her father; 'it is too bad to keep the poor man dangling on
at this rate!  And such a man!'
'I am very sorry for it, but I cannot help it,' said Mary; 'no one can
be kinder or more forbearing than he has been, but I wish he would look
elsewhere.'
'So you have not got that nonsense out of your head!' exclaimed Mr.
Ponsonby, with muttered words that Mary would not hear.  'All my fault
for ever sending you among that crew!  Coming between you and the best
match in Lima--the best fellow in the world--strict enough to content
Melicent or your mother either!  What have you to say against him,
Mary?  I desire to know that.'
'Nothing, papa,' said Mary, 'except that I wish he could make a better
choice.'
'I tell you, you and he were made for each other.  It is the most
provoking thing in the world, that you will go on in this obstinate
way!  I can't even ask the man to do me a kindness, with having an eye
to these abominable affairs, that are all going to the dogs. There's
old Dynevor left his senses behind him when he went off to play the
great man in England, writing every post for remittances, when he knows
what an outlay we've been at for machinery; and there's the Equatorial
Company cutting its own throat at Guayaquil, and that young fellow up
at the San Benito not half to be trusted--Robson can't make out his
accounts; and here am I such a wretch that I can hardly tell what two
and two make; and here's Ward, the very fellow to come in and set all
straight in the nick of time; and I can't ask him so much as to look at
a paper for me, because I'm not to lay myself under an obligation.'
'But, papa, if our affairs are not prosperous, it would not be fair to
connect Mr. Ward or any one with them.'
'Never you trouble yourself about that!  You'll come in for a pretty
fortune of your own, whatever happens to that abominable cheat of a
Company; and that might be saved if only I was the man I was, or
Dynevor was here.  If Ward would give us a loan, and turn his mind to
it, we should be on our legs in an instant.  It is touch and go just
now!--I declare, Mary,' he broke out again after an interval, 'I never
saw anything so selfish as you are!  Lingering and pining on about this
foolish young man, who has never taken any notice of you since you have
been out here, and whom you hear is in love with another woman--married
to her very likely by this time--or, maybe, only wishing you were
married and out of his way.'
'I do not believe so,' answered Mary, stoutly.
'What! you did not see Oliver's letter from that German place?'
'Yes, I did,' said Mary; 'but I know his manner to Clara.'
'You do?  You take things coolly, upon my word!'
'No,' said Mary.  'I know they are like brother and sister, and Clara
could never have written to me as she has done, had there been any such
notion.  But that is not the point, papa.  What I know is, that while
my feelings are what they are at present, it would not be right of me
to accept any one; and so I shall tell Mr. Ward, if he is still
determined to see me.  Pray forgive me, dear papa.  I do admire and
honour him very much, but I cannot do any more; and I am sorry I have
seemed pining or discontented, for I tried not to be so.'
A grim grunt was all the answer that Mr. Ponsonby vouchsafed.  His
conscience, though not his lips, acquitted poor Mary of discontent or
pining, as indeed it was the uniform cheerfulness of her demeanour that
had misled him into thinking the unfortunate affair forgotten.
He showed no symptoms of speaking again; and Mary, leaning back in her
chair, had leisure to recover herself after the many severe strokes
that had been made at her.  There was one which she had rebutted
valiantly at the moment, but which proved to have been a poisoned
dart--that suggestion that it might be selfish in her not to set Louis
even more free, by her own marriage!
She revolved the probabilities: Clara, formed, guided, supported by
himself, the companion of his earlier youth, preferred to all others,
and by this time, no doubt, developed into all that was admirable. What
would be more probable than their mutual love?  And when Mary went over
all the circumstances of her own strange courtship, she could not but
recur to her mother's original impression, that Louis had not known
what he was doing.  Those last weeks had made her feel rather than
believe otherwise, but they were far in the distance now, and he had
been so young!  It was not unlikely that even yet, while believing
himself faithful to her, his heart was in Clara's keeping, and that the
news of her marriage would reveal to them both, in one rush of
happiness, that they were destined for each other from the first.
Mary felt intense pain, and yet a strange thrill of joy, to think that
Louis might at last be happy.
She drew Clara's last letter out of her basket, and re-read it, in
hopes of some contradiction.  Clara's letters had all hitherto been
stiff.  She had not been acknowledged to be in the secret of Mary's
engagement while it subsisted, and this occasioned a delicacy in
writing to her on any subject connected with it; and so the mention of
the meeting at the 'Grand Monarque' came in tamely, and went off
quickly into Lord Ormersfield's rheumatism and Charlemagne's tomb. But
the remarkable thing in the letter was the unusual perfume of happiness
that pervaded it; the conventional itinerary was abandoned, and there
was a tendency to droll sayings--nay, some shafts from a quiver at
which Mary could guess.  She had set all down as the exhilaration of
Louis's presence, but perhaps that exhilaration, was to a degree in
which she alone could sympathize.
Mary was no day-dreamer; and yet, ere Rosita's satin shoe was on the
threshold, she had indulged in the melancholy fabric of a castle at
Ormersfield, in which she had no share, except the consciousness that
it had been her self-sacrifice that had given Louis at last the
felicity for which he was so well fitted.
But at night, in her strange little room, lying in her hammock, and
looking up through her one unglazed window, high up in the roof, to the
stars that slowly travelled across the space, she came back to a more
collected opinion.  She had no right to sacrifice Mr. Ward as well as
herself.  Louis could not be more free than she had made him already,
and it would be doing evil that good might come, to accept the
addresses of one man while she could not detach her heart from another.
'Have I ever really tried yet? she thought.  'Perhaps I am punishing
him and poor Mr. Ward, because, as papa says, I have languished, and
have never tried in earnest to wean my thoughts from him.  He was the
one precious memory, besides my dear mother, and she never thought it
would come to good.  He will turn out to have been constant to Clara
all the time, though he did not know it.'
Even if Mr. Ponsonby had been in full health, he would have had no
inclination to spare Mary the conversation with Mr. Ward, who took his
hot nine miles' ride from Lima in the early morning, before the shadow
of the mountains had been drawn up from the arid barren slope leading
to Chorillos.
He came in time for the late breakfast, when the table was loaded with
various beautiful tropical fruits, tempting after his ride, and in his
state of suspense.  He talked of his journey, and of his intended
absence, and his regret, in a manner half mechanical, half dreamy,
which made Mary quite sorry for him; it was melancholy for a man of his
age to have fixed so many fond hopes where disappointment was in store
for him.  She wished to deal as kindly with him as she could, and did
not shrink away when her father left them, muttering something about a
letter, and Rosita went to take her siesta.
With anxious diffidence he ventured to ask whether she remembered what
had passed between them on the San Benito mountain.
'Yes, Mr. Ward, but I am afraid I do not think differently now, in
spite of all your kindness.'
Poor Mr. Ward's countenance underwent a change, as if he had hoped
more.  'Your father had given me reason to trust,' he said, 'that you
had recovered your spirits; otherwise I should hardly have presumed to
intrude on you.  And yet, before so long an absence, you cannot wonder
that I longed to hear something decisive.'
'Indeed I wished what I said before to be decisive.  I am very sorry to
give pain to one so much kinder than I deserve, and to whom I look up
so much, but you see, Mr. Ward, I cannot say what is untrue.'
'Miss Ponsonby,' said Mr. Ward, 'I think you may be acting on a most
noble but mistaken view.  I can well believe that what you have once
experienced you can never feel again.  That would be more than I should
dare to ask.  My own feeling for you is such that I believe I should be
able to rejoice in hearing of the fulfilment of your happiness, in your
own way; but since there seems no such probability, cannot you grant me
what you can still give, which would be enough to cause me the greatest
joy to which I have ever aspired; and if my most devoted affection
could be any sufficient return, you know that it is yours already.'
The grave earnestness with which he spoke went to Mary's heart, and the
tears came into her eyes.  She felt it almost wrong to withstand a man
of so much weight and worth; but she spoke steadily--'This is very
kind--very kind indeed; but I do not feel as if it would be right.'
'Will you not let me be the judge of what will satisfy me?'
'You cannot judge of my feelings, Mr. Ward.  You must believe me that,
with all my esteem and gratitude, I do not yet feel as if I should be
acting rightly by you or by any one else, under my present sentiments.'
'You do not yet feel?'
Mary felt that the word was a mistake.  'I do not think I ever shall,'
she added.
'You will not call it persecution, if I answer that perhaps I may make
the venture once more,' he said.  'I shall live on that word 'yet'
while I am at New York.  I will tease you no more now; but remember
that, though I am too old to expect to be a young lady's first choice,
I never saw the woman whom I could love, or of whom I could feel so
sure that she would bring a blessing with her; and I do believe that,
if you would trust me, I could make you happy.  There! I ask no answer.
I only shall think of my return next year, and not reckon on that.  I
know you will tell me whatever is true.'  He pressed her hand, and
would fain have smiled reassuringly.
He took leave much more kindly than Mary thought she deserved, and did
not appear to be in low spirits.  She feared that ahe had raised
unwarrantable hopes, but the truth was, that Mr. Ponsonby had privately
assured him that, though she could not yet believe it, poor girl! the
young man in England would be married before many months were over to
old Dynevor's niece.  There would be no more difficulty by the time he
came back, for she liked him heartily already, and was a sensible girl.
So Mr. Ward departed, and Mary was relieved, although she missed his
honest manly homage, and sound wise tone of thought, where she had so
few to love or lean on.  She thought that she ought to try to put
herself out of the way of her cousins at home as much as possible, and
so she did not try to make time to write to Clara, and time did not
come unsought, for her father's health did not improve; and when they
returned to Lima, he engrossed her care almost entirely, while his
young wife continued her gaieties, and Mary had reason to think the
saya y manto disguise was frequently donned; but it was so much the
custom of ladies of the same degree, that Mary thought it neither
desirable nor likely to be effectual to inform her father, and incite
him to interfere.  She devoted herself to his comfort, and endeavoured
to think as little as she heard of English cousins.
There was not much to hear.  After returning home quite well, Lord
Ormersfield was laid up again by the first cold winds, and another
summer of German brunnens was in store for him and Louis.  Lady Conway
had taken a cottage in the Isle of Wight, where Walter, having found
the Christmas holidays very dull, and shown that he could get into
mischief as well without Delaford as with him, she sent him off in a
sort of honourable captivity to James and Isabel, expecting that he
would find it a great punishment.  Instead of this, the change from
luxury to their hard life seemed to him a sort of pic-nic.  He enjoyed
the 'fun' of the waiting on themselves, had the freedom of Ormersfield
park for sport; and at home, his sister, whom he had always loved and
respected more than any one else.  James had time to attend to him, and
to promote all his better tastes and feelings; and above all, he lost
his heart to his twin nieces.  It was exceedingly droll to see the half
quarrelsome coquetries between the three, and to hear Walter's grand
views for the two little maidens as soon as he should be of age.  James
and Louis agreed that there could not be much harm in him, while he
could conform so happily to such a way of life.  Everything is
comparative, and the small increase to James's income had been
sufficient to relieve him from present pinching and anxiety in the
scale of life to which he and Isabel had become habituated.  His
chaplaincy gave full employment for heart and head to a man so
energetic and earnest; he felt himself useful there, and threw himself
into it with all his soul; and, what was more wonderful, he had never
yet quarrelled with the guardians; and the master told Mr. Calcott that
he had heard Mr. Frost was a fiery gentleman, but he had always seen
him particularly gentle, especially with the children in school.  The
old women could never say enough in his praise, and doated on the
little brown fairy who often accompanied him.
There was plenty to be done at home--little luxury, and not much rest;
but Isabel's strength and spirits seemed a match for all, in her own
serene quiet way, and the days passed very happily.
Charlotte had a workhouse girl under her, who neither ate nor broke so
vehemently as her predecessor.  One night, when Charlotte sat mending
and singing in the nursery, the girl came plodding up in her heavy
shoes, saying, 'There's one wanting to see ye below.'
'One!  Who can it be?' cried Charlotte, her heart bounding at the
thought of a denouement to her own romance.
'He looks like a gentleman,' said the girl, 'and he wanted not to see
master, but Miss Arnold most particular.'  More hopes for Charlotte.
She had nearly made one bound downstairs, but waited to lay awful
commands on the girl not to leave the children on no account; then flew
down, pausing at the foot of the stairs to draw herself up, and
remember dignity and maidenliness.  Alas for her hopes!  It was
Delaford!  His whiskers still were sleek and curly; he still had a
grand air; but his boots were less polished--his hat had lost the
gloss--and he looked somewhat the worse for wear.
Poor Charlotte started back as if she had seen a wild beast in her
kitchen.  She had heard of his dishonesty, and her thoughts flew
distractedly to her spoons, murder, and the children.  And here he was
advancing gracefully to take her hand.  She jumped back, and exclaimed,
faintly, 'Mr. Delaford, please go away!  I can't think what you come
here for!'
'Ah! I see, you have listened to the voice of unkind scandal,' said Mr.
Delaford.  'I have been unfortunate, Miss Arnold--unfortunate and
misunderstood--guilty never.  On the brink of quitting for ever an
ungrateful country, I could not deny myself the last sad satisfaction
of visiting the spot where my brightest hours have been passed;' and he
looked so pathetic, that Charlotte felt her better sense melting, and
spoke in a hurry--
'Please don't, Mr. Delaford, I've had enough of all that.  Please go,
and take my best wishes, as long as you don't come here, for I know all
about you.'
But the intruder only put his hand upon his heart, and declared that he
had been misrepresented; and let a cruel world think of him as it
might, there was one breast in which he could not bear that a false
opinion, of him should prevail.  And therewith he reached a chair, and
Charlotte found herself seated and listening to him, neither believing,
nor wishing to believe him, longing that he would take himself away,
but bewildered by his rhetoric.  In the first place, he had been
hastily judged; he had perhaps yielded too much to Sir Walter--but
youth, &c.; and when Lady Conway's means were in his hands, it had
seemed better--he knew now that it had been a weakness, but so he had
judged at the time--to supply the young gentleman's little occasions,
than to make an eclat.  Moreover, if he had not been the most
unfortunate wretch in the world, a few lucky hits would have enabled
him to restore the whole before Lord Fitzjocelyn hurried on the
inquiry; but the young gentleman thought he acted for the best, and Mr.
Delaford magnanimously forgave him.
Charlotte could not follow through half the labyrinth; and sat pinching
the corner of her apron, with a vague idea that perhaps he was not so
bad as was supposed; but what would happen if her master should find
him there?   She never looked up, nor made any answer, till he began to
give her a piteous account of his condition; how he did not know where
to turn, nor what to do; and was gradually beginning to sell off his
'little wardrobe to purchase the necessaries of life.'  Then the
contrast began to tell on her soft heart, and she looked up with a
sound of compassion.
In the wreck of his fortunes and hopes, he had thought of her; he knew
she had too generous a spirit to crush a wretch trodden down by
adversity, who had loved her truly, and who had once had some few hopes
of requital.  Those were, alas! at an end; yet still he saw that
'woman, lovely woman, in our hours of ease'--And here he stumbled in
his quotation, but the fact was, that his hopes being blasted in
England, he had decided on trying his fortune in another hemisphere;
but, unfortunately, he had not even sufficient means to pay for a
passage of the humblest description, and if he could venture to entreat
for a--in fact, a loan--it should be most faithfully and gratefully
restored the moment the fickle goddess should smile on him.
Charlotte felt a gleam of joy at the prospect of getting rid of him on
any terms.  She belonged to a class who seldom find the golden mean in
money matters, being either exceedingly close and saving, or else
lavish either on themselves or other people.  Good old Jane had never
succeeded in saving; all her halfpence went to the beggars, and all her
silver melted into halfpence, or into little presents; and on the
receipt of her wages, she always rushed on to the shop like a child
with a new shilling.  Reading had given Charlotte a few theories on the
subject, but her practice had not gone far.  She always meant to put
into the savings' bank; but hiring books, and daintiness, though not
finery, in dress, had prevented her means from ever amounting to a sum,
in her opinion, worth securing.  The spirit of economy in the household
had so far infected her that she had, in spite of her small wages, more
in hand than ever before, and when she found what Mr. Delaford wanted,
a strange mixture of feelings actuated her.  She pitied the change in
his fortunes; she could not but be softened by his flattering
sayings,--she could not bear that he should not have another chance of
retrieving his character--she knew she had trifled unjustifiably with
his feelings, if he had any,--and she had a sense of being in fault.
And so the little maiden ran upstairs, peeped into her red-leather
work-box, pulled out her bead-purse, and extracted therefrom three
bright gold sovereigns, and ran downstairs again, trembling at her own
venturesomeness, afraid that their voices might be heard.  She put the
whole before Delaford, saying--
'There--that is all that lays in my power.  Don't mention it, pray.
Now, please go, and a happy journey to you.'
How she wished his acknowledgments and faithful promises were over! He
did hint something about refreshment, bread-and-cheese and beer, fare
which he used to despise as 'decidedly low,' but Charlotte was obdurate
here, and at last he took his leave.  There stood the poor, foolish,
generous little thing, raking out the last embers of the kitchen fire,
conscious that she had probably done the silliest action of her life,
very much ashamed, and afraid of any one knowing it; and yet strangely
light of heart, as if she had done something to atone for the past
permission that she had granted him to play with her vanity.
'Some day she might tell Tom all about it, and she did not think he
would be angry, for he knew what it was to have nowhere to go, and to
want to try for one more chance.'
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE CRASH.
Late and early at employ;
Still on thy golden stores intent;
Thy summer in heaping and hoarding is spent,
What thy winter will never enjoy.
SOUTHEY.
'Stitch! stitch!' said James Frost, entering the nursery on a fine
August evening, and finding his wife with the last beams of sunshine
glistening on her black braids of hair, as she sat singing and working
beside the cot where slept, all tossed and rosy, the yearling child.
'Stitch! stitch!  If I could but do needlework!'
'Ah!' said Isabel, playfully, lifting up a sweeter face than had ever
been admired in Miss Conway, 'if you will make your kittens such little
romps, what would you have but mending?'
'Is it my fault?  I am very sorry I entailed such a business on you.
You were at that frock when I went to evening prayers at the Union, and
it is not mended yet.'
'Almost; and see what a perfect performance it is, all the spots
joining as if they had never been rent.  I never was so proud of
anything as of my mending capabilities.  Besides, I have not been doing
it all the time: this naughty little Fanny was in such a laughing mood,
that she would neither sleep herself nor let the rest do so; and Kitty
rose up out of her crib, and lectured us all.  Now, don't wake
them--no, you must not even kiss the twin cherries; for if they have
one of papa's riots, they will hardly sleep all night.'
'Then you must take me away; it is like going into a flower-garden, and
being told not to gather.'
'Charlotte is almost ready to come to them, and in the meantime here is
something for you to criticise,' said she, taking from the recess of
her matronly workbasket a paper with a pencilled poem, on the Martyrs
of Carthage, far more terse and expressive than anything she used to
write when composition was the object of the day.  James read and
commented, and was disappointed when they broke off short-- 'Ah! there
baby woke.'
'Some day I shall give you a subject.  Do you know how Sta. Francesca
Romana found in letters of gold the verse of the Psalm she had been
reading, and from which she had been five times called away to attend
to her household duties?'
'I thought you were never to pity me again--'
'Do you call that pitying you?'
'Worse,' said Isabel, smiling.
'Well, then, what I came for was to ask if you can put on your bonnet,
and take a walk in the lanes this lovely evening.'
A walk was a rare treat to the busy mother, and, with a look of
delight, she consented to leave her mending and her children to
Charlotte.  There seldom were two happier beings than that pair, as
they wandered slowly, arm-in-arm, in the deep green lanes, in the
summer twilight, talking sometimes of the present, sometimes of the
future, but with the desultory, vague speculation of those who feared
little because they knew how little there was to fear.
'It is well they are all girls,' said James, speaking of that constant
topic, the children;  'we can manage their education pretty well, I
flatter myself, by the help of poor Clara's finishing governess, as
Louis used to call you.'
'If the edge of my attainments be not quite rusted off.  Meantime, you
teach Kitty, and I teach nothing.'
'You don't lose your singing.  Your voice never used to be so sweet.'
'It keeps the children good.  But you should have seen Kitty chaunting
'Edwin and Angelina' to the twins this morning, and getting up an
imitation of crying at 'turn Angelina, ever dear,' because, she said,
Charlotte always did.'
'That is worth writing to tell Fitzjocelyn!  It will be a great
disappointment if they have to stay abroad all this winter; but he
seems to think it the only chance of his father getting thoroughly
well, so I suppose there is little hope of him.  I should like for him
to see Kitty as she is now, she is so excessively droll!'
'Yes; and it must be a great deprivation to have to leave all his farm
to itself, just as it is looking so well; only he makes himself happy
with whatever he is doing.'
'How he would enjoy this evening!  I never saw more perfect rest!'
'Yes;--the sounds of the town come through the air in a hush! and the
very star seems to twinkle quietly!'
They stood still without speaking to enjoy that sense of stillness and
refreshment, looking up through the chestnut boughs that overshadowed
the deep dewy lane, where there was not air enough even to waft down
the detached petals of the wild rose.
'Such moments as these must be meant to help one on,' said James, 'to
hinder daily life from running into drudgery.'
'And it is so delightful to have a holiday given, now and then, instead
of having a life all holiday.  Ah! there's a glow-worm--look at the
wonder of that green lamp!'
'I must show it to Kitty,' said James, taking it up on a cushion of
moss.
'Her acquaintance will begin earlier than mine.  Do you remember
showing me my first glow-worm at Beauchastel?  I used to think that the
gem of my walks, before I knew better.  It is a great treat to have
poor Walter here in the holidays, so good and pleasant; but I must say
one charm is the pleasure of being alone together afterwards.'
'A pleasure it is well you do not get tired of, my dear, and I am
afraid it will soon be over for the present.  I do believe that is
Richardson behind us!  An attorney among the glow-worms is more than I
expected.'
'Good evening, sir,' said the attorney, coming up with them; 'is Mrs.
Frost braving the dew?'  And then, after some moments, 'Have you heard
from your sister lately, Mr. Frost?'
'About three weeks ago.'
'She did not mention then,' said Mr. Richardson, hesitating, 'Mr.
Dynevor's health?'
'No!  Have you heard anything?'
'I thought you might wish to be aware of what I learnt from, I fear,
too good authority.  It appears that Mr. Dynevor paid only a part of
the purchase-money of the estate, giving security for the rest on his
property in Peru; and now, owing to the failure of the Equatorial Steam
Navigation Company, Mr. Dynevor is, I fear, actually insolvent.'
'Did you say he was ill?'
'I heard mentioned severe illness--paralytic affection; but as you have
not heard from Miss Clara, I hope it may be of no importance.'
After a few more inquiries, and additional information being elicited,
good-nights were exchanged, and Mr. Richardson passed on. At first
neither spoke, till Isabel said--
'And Clara never wrote!'
'She would identify herself too much with her uncle in his misfortune.
Poor dear child! what may she not be undergoing!'
'You will go to her?'
'I must.  Whether my uncle will forgive me or not, to Clara I must go.
Shall I write first?'
'Oh! no; it will only make a delay, and your uncle might say 'don't
come.''
'Right; delay would prolong her perplexities.  I will go to-morrow, and
Mr. Holdsworth will see to the workhouse people.'
His alert air showed how grateful was any excuse that could take him to
Clara, the impulse of brotherly love coming uppermost of all his
sensations.  Then came pity for the poor old man whose cherished design
had thus crumbled, and the anxious wonder whether he would forgive, and
deign to accept sympathy from his nephew.
'My dear,' said James, doubtfully; 'supposing, what I hardly dare to
imagine, that he should consent, what should you say to my bringing him
here?
'I believe it would make you happy,' said Isabel.  'Oh! yes, pray
do--and then we should have Clara.'
'I should rejoice to offer anything like reparation, though I do not
dare to hope it will be granted; and I do not know how to ask you to
break up the home comfort we have prized so much.'
'It will be all the better comfort for your mind being fully at ease;
and I am sure we should deserve none at all, if we shut our door
against him now that he is in distress.  You must bring him, poor old
man, and I will try with all my might to behave well to him.'
'It is a mere chance; but I am glad to take your consent with me. As to
our affording it, I suppose he may have, at the worst, an allowance
from the creditors, so you will not have to retrench anything.'
'Don't talk of that, dearest.  We never knew how little we could live
on till we tried; and if No. 12 is taken, and you are paid for the new
edition of the lectures, and Walter's pay besides--'
'And Sir Hubert,' added James.
'Of course we shall get on,' said Isabel.  'I am not in the least
afraid that the little girls will suffer, if they do live a little
harder for the sake of their old uncle.  I only wish you had had your
new black coat first, for I am afraid you won't now.'
'You need not reckon on that.  I don't expect that I shall be allowed
the comfort of doing anything for him.  But see about them I must. Oh,
may I not be too late!'
Early the next morning James was on his way, travelling through the
long bright summer day; and when, after the close, stifling railway
carriage, full of rough, loud-voiced passengers, he found himself in
the cool of the evening on the bare heath, where the slanting sunbeams
cast a red light, he was reminded by every object that met his eye of
the harsh and rebellious sensations that he had allowed to reign over
him at his last arrival there, which had made him wrangle over the bier
of one so loving and beloved, and exaggerate the right till it wore the
semblance of the wrong.
By the time he came to the village, the parting light was shining on
the lofty church tower, rising above the turmoil and whirl of the
darkening world below, almost as sacred old age had lifted his
grandmother into perpetual peace and joy, above the fret and vexation
of earthly cares and dissensions.  The recollection of her confident
trust that reconciliation was in store, came to cheer him as he crossed
the park, and the aspect of the house assured him that at least he was
not again too late.
The servant who answered the bell said that Mr. Dynevor was very ill,
and Miss Dynevor could see no one.  James sent in his card, and stood
in an agony of impatience, imagining all and more than all he deserved,
to have taken place--his uncle either dying, or else forcibly
withholding his sister from him.
At last there was a hurried step, and the brother and sister were
clasping each other in speechless joy.
'O Jem! dear Jem! this is so kind!' cried Clara, as with arms round
each other they crossed the hall.  'Now I don't care for anything!'
'My uncle?'
'Much better,' said Clara; 'he speaks quite well again, and his foot is
less numb.'
'Was it paralysis?'
'Yes; brought on by trouble and worry of mind.  But how did you know,
Jem?'
'Richardson told me.  Oh, Clara, had I offended too deeply for you to
summon me?'
'No, indeed,' said Clara, pressing his arm, 'I knew you would help us
as far as you could; but to throw ourselves on you would be robbing the
children, so I wanted to have something fixed before you heard.'
'My poor child, what could be fixed?'
'You gave me what is better than house and land,' said Clara.  'I wrote
to Miss Brigham; she will give me employment in the school till I can
find a place as daily governess, and she is to take lodgings for us.'
'And is this what it has come to, my poor Clara?'
'Oh, don't pity me! my heart has felt like an India-rubber ball ever
since the crash.  Even poor Uncle Oliver being so ill could not keep me
from feeling as if the burthen were off my back, and I were little
Clara Frost again.  It seemed to take away the bar between us; and so
it has!  O Jem! this is happiness.  Tell me of Isabel and the babies.'
'You will come home to them.  Do you think my uncle would consent?'
She answered with an embrace, a look of rapture and of doubt, and then
a negative.  'Oh, no, we cannot be a burthen on you.  You have quite
enough on your hands.  And, oh! you have grown so spare and thin.  I
mean to maintain my uncle, if--' and her spirited bearing softened into
thoughtfulness, as if the little word conveyed that she meant not to be
self-confident.
'But, Clara, is this actual ruin?  I know only what Richardson could
tell me.'
'I do not fully understand,' said Clara.  'It had been plain for a long
time that something was on Uncle Oliver's mind; he was so restless all
the winter at Paris, and at last arranged our coming home very
suddenly.  I think he was disappointed in London, for he went out at
once, and came back very much discomposed.  He even scolded me for not
having married; and when I tried to coax him out of it, he said it was
for my good, and he wanted to see after his business in Peru.  I put
him in mind how dear granny had begged him to stay at home; but he told
me I knew nothing about it, and that he would have gone long ago if I
had not been an obstinate girl, and had known how to play my cards.  I
said something about going home, but that made him more furious than
ever.  But, after all, it is not fair to tell all about the last few
months.  Dr. Hastings says his attack had been a long time coming on,
and he must have been previously harassed.'
'And you had to bear with it all?'
'He was never unkind.  Oh, no; but it was sad to see him so miserable,
and not to know why--and so uncertain, too!  Sometimes he would insist
on giving grand parties, and yet he was angry with the expense of my
poor little pony-carriage.  I don't think he always quite knew what he
was about; and while he hoped to pull through, I suppose he was afraid
of any one guessing at his embarrassments.  On this day fortnight he
was reading his letters at breakfast--I saw there was something amiss,
and said something stupid about the hot rolls, because he could not
bear me to notice.  I think that roused him, for he got up, but he
tottered, and by the time I came to him he seemed to slip down into my
arms, quite insensible.  The surgeon in the village bled him, and he
came to himself, but could not speak. I had almost sent for you then,
but Dr. Hastings came, and thought he would recover, and I did not
venture.  Indeed, Jane forbade me; she is a sort of lioness and her
whelps.  Well, the next day came Mr. Morrison, who is the Mr.
Richardson to this concern, and by-and-by he asked to see me.  He kept
the doctor in the next room.  I believe he thought I should faint or
make some such performance, for he began about his painful duty, and
frightened me lest my poor uncle should be worse, only he was not the
right man to tell me.  So at last it came out that we were ruined, and
I was not an heiress at all, at all!  If it had not been for poor Uncle
Oliver, I should have cried 'Hurrah!'  I did nearly laugh to hear him
complimenting my firmness. I believe the history is this:--Hearing that
this place was for sale, brought Uncle Oliver home before his affairs
could well do without him.  He paid half the price, and promised to pay
the rest in three years, giving security on the mines and the other
property in Peru; but somehow the remittances have never come properly,
and he trusted to some great success with the Equatorial Company to set
things straight, but it seems that it has totally failed, and that was
the news that overthrew him.  Then the creditors, who had been put off
with hopes, all came down on him together, and there seems to be
nothing to be done but to give up everything to them.  Poor Uncle
Oliver!--I sat watching him that evening, and thinking how Louis would
say the sea had swept away his whole sand castle with one wave.'
'Does he know it?  Have any steps been taken?'
'Mr. Morrison showed me what my poor uncle had done.  He had really
executed a deed giving me the whole estate; he would have borne all the
disgrace and persecution himself--for you know it would have been a
most horrible scrape, as he had given them security on property that
was not really secure.  Mr. Morrison said the deed would hold, and that
he would bring me counsel's opinion if I liked.  But, oh, Jem!  I was
so thankful that my birthday was over, and I was my own woman!  I made
him draw up a paper, and I signed it, undertaking that they shall have
quiet possession provided they will come to an amicable settlement, and
not torment my uncle.'
'I hope he is a man of sense, who will make the best terms?'
'You may see to that now.  I'm sure he is a man of compliments.  He
tells me grand things about my disinterestedness, and the creditors and
they have promised to let us stay unmolested as long as I please, which
will be only till my uncle can move, for I must get rid of all these
servants and paraphernalia, and in the meantime they are concocting the
amicable adjustment, and Mr. Morrison said he should try to stipulate
for a maintenance for my uncle, but he was not sure of it, without
giving up what may yet come from Peru.  Jane's annuity is safe--that is
a comfort!  What work I had to make her believe it! and now she wants
us all to live upon it.'
'That was a rare and beautiful power by which my grandmother infused
such faithful love into all her dependants.  But now for the person
really to be pitied.'
'It was only three days ago that it was safe to speak of it, but then
he had grown so anxious that the doctors said I must begin.  So I
begged and prayed him to forgive me, and then told what I had done, and
he was not so very angry.  He only called me a silly child, and said I
did not know what I had done in those few days that I had been left to
myself.  So I told him dear granny had had it, and that was all that
signified, and that I never had any right here.  Then,' said Clara,
tearfully, 'he began to cry like a child, and said at least she had
died in her own home, and he called me Henry's child: and then Jane
came and turned me out, and wont let me go near him unless I promise to
be good and say nothing.  But I must soon; for however she pats him,
and says, 'Don't, Master Oliver,' I see his mind runs on nothing else,
and the doctor says he may soon hear the plans, and be moved.'
'Can you venture to tell him that I am here?'
Before Clara could answer, Jane opened the door--'Miss Clara, your
uncle;' and there she stopped, at the unexpected sight of the brother
and sister still hand in hand.  'Here, Jane, do you see him?' cried
Clara; and James came forward with outstretched hand, but he was not
graciously received.
'Now, Master James, you ain't coming here to worrit your poor uncle?'
'No, indeed, Jane.  I am come in the hope of being of some use to him.'
'I'd rather by half it had been Lord Fitzjocelyn,' muttered Jane, 'he
was always quieter.'
'Now, Jane, you should not be so cross,' cried Clara, 'when it is your
own Jemmy, come on purpose to help and comfort us all!  You are going
to tell Uncle Oliver, and make him glad to see him, as you know you
are.'
'I know,' said James, 'that last time I was here, I behaved ill enough
to make you dread my presence, Jane; but I have learnt and suffered a
good deal since that time, and I wish for nothing so much as for my
uncle's pardon.'
Mrs. Beckett would have been more impressed, had she ever ceased to
think of Master Jemmy otherwise than as a self-willed but candid boy;
and she answered as if he had been throwing himself on her mercy after
breaking a window, or knocking down Lord Fitzjocelyn--
'Well, sir, that is all you can say.  I'm glad you are sorry.  I'll see
if I can mention, it to your uncle.'
Off trotted Jane, while Clara's indignation and excited spirits
relieved themselves by a burst of merry laughter, as she hung about her
brother, and begged to hear of the dear old home.
The old servant, in her simplicity, went straight upstairs, and up to
her nursling, as he had again become.  'Master Oliver,' said she, 'he
is come.  Master Jem is come back, and 'twould do your heart good to
see how happy the children are together--just like you and poor Master
Henry.'
'Did she ask him here?' said Mr. Dynevor, uneasily.
'No, sir, he came right out of his own head, because he thought she
would feel lost.'
Oliver vouchsafed no reply, and Jane pressed no farther.  He never
alluded to his guest; but when Clara came into the room, his eye dwelt
on her countenance of bright content and animation, and the smiles that
played round her lips as she sat silent.  Her voice was hushed in the
sick-room, but he heard it about the house with the blithe, lively ring
that had been absent from it since he carried her away from Northwold;
and her steps danced upstairs, and along the galleries, with the light,
bounding tread unknown to the constrained, dignified Miss Dynevor.  Ah
the notice he took that night was to say, petulantly, when Clara was
sitting with him, 'Don't stay here; you want to be down-stairs.'
'Oh, no, dear uncle, I am come to stay with you.  I don't want, in the
least, to be anywhere but here.'
He seemed pleased, although he growled; and next morning Jane reported
that he had been asking for how long his nephew had come, and saying he
was glad that Miss Dynevor had someone to look after her--a sufferance
beyond expectation.  In his helpless state, Jane had resumed her
nursery relations with him; and he talked matters over with her so
freely that it was well that the two young people were scarcely less
her children, and had almost an equal share of her affection, so that
Clara felt that matters might be safely trusted in her hands.
Clara's felicity could hardly be described, with her fond affections
satisfied by her brother's presence, and her fears of managing ill,
removed by reliance on him; and many as were the remaining cases, and
great as was the suspense lest her uncle should still nourish
resentment, nothing could overcome the sense of restored joy ever
bubbling up, not even the dread that James might not bear patiently
with continued rebuffs.  But James was so much more gentle and tolerant
than she had ever known him, that at first she could not understand
missing the retort, the satire, the censure which had seemed an
essential part of her brother.  She was always instinctively guarding
against what never happened, or if some slight demonstration flashed
out, he caught himself up, and asked pardon before she had perceived
anything, till she began to think marriage had altered him wonderfully,
and almost to owe Isabel a grudge for having cowed his spirit.  She
could hardly believe that he was waiting so patiently in the guise of a
suppliant, when she thought him in the right from the first; though she
could perceive that the task was easier now that the old man was in
adversity, and she saw that he regarded his exclusion from his uncle's
room in the light of a just punishment, to be endured with humility.
James, on his side, was highly pleased with his sister.  Having only
seen her as the wild, untamed Giraffe, he was by no means prepared for
the dignity and decision with which Miss Dynevor reigned over the
establishment.  Her tall figure, and the simple, straightforward ease
of her movements and manners, seemed made to grace those large, lofty
rooms; and as he watched her playing the part of mistress of the house
so naturally in the midst of the state, the servants, the silver
covers, and the trappings, he felt that heiress-ship became her so
well, that he could hardly believe that her tenure there was over, and
unregretted.  'Even Isabel could not do it better,' he said, smiling;
and she made a low curtsey for the compliment, and laughed back, 'I'm
glad you have come to see my performance.  It has been a very long,
dull pageant, and here comes Mr. Morrison, I hope with the last act.'
Morrison was evidently much relieved that Miss Dynevor should have some
relative to advise with, since he did not like the responsibility of
her renunciation, though owning that it was the only thing that could
save her uncle from disgraceful ruin, and perhaps from prosecution;
whereas now the gratitude and forbearance of the creditors were
secured, and he hoped that Mr. Dynevor might be set free from the
numerous English involvements, without sacrificing his remaining
property in Peru.  The lawyer seemed to have no words to express to
James his sense of Miss Dynevor's conduct in the matter, her
promptitude and good sense having apparently struck him as much as her
generosity, and there was no getting him to believe, as Clara wished,
that the sacrifice was no sacrifice at all--nothing, as she said, but
'common honesty and a great riddance.'  He promised to take steps in
earnest for the final settlement with the creditors; and though still
far from the last act, Clara began to consider of hastening her plans.
It was exceedingly doubtful whether Oliver would hear of living at
Dynevor Terrace, and Clara could not be separated from him; besides
which, she was resolved that her brother should not be burthened, and
she would give James no promises, conditional or otherwise.
Mr. Dynevor had discovered that Morrison had been in the house, and was
obviously restless to know what had taken place.  By-and-by he said to
Jane, with an air of inquiry, 'Why does not the young man come near me?'
Mrs. Beckett was too happy to report the invitation, telling 'Master
Jem' at the same time that 'he was not to rake up nothing gone and
past; there was quite troubles enough for one while.'  Clara thought
the same, and besides was secretly sure that if he admitted that he had
been wrong in part, his uncle would imagine him to mean that he had
been wrong in the whole.  Their instructions and precautions were
trying to James, whose chaplaincy had given him more experience of the
sick and the feeble than they gave him credit for; but he was patient
enough to amaze Clara and pacify Jane, who ushered him into the
sick-chamber.  There, even in his worst days, he must have laid aside
ill-feeling at the aspect of the shrunken, broken figure in the
pillowed arm-chair, prematurely aged, his hair thin and white, his face
shrivelled, his eyelid drooping, and mouth contracted.  He was still
some years under sixty; but this was the result of toil and climate--of
the labour generously designed, but how conducted, how resulting?
He had not learned to put out his left hand--he only made a sharp nod,
as James, with tender and humble respect, approached, feeling that, how
his grandmother was gone, this frail old man, his father's brother, was
the last who claimed by right his filial love and gratitude.  How
different from the rancour and animosity with which he had met his
former advances!
He ventured gently on kindly hopes that his uncle was better, and they
were not ill taken, though not without fretfulness. Presently Oliver
said, 'Come to look after your sister?  that's right--good girl, good
girl!'
'That she is!' exclaimed James, heartily.
'Too hasty! too great hurry,' resumed Oliver; 'she had better have
waited, saved the old place,--never mind what became of the old man,
one-half dead already.'
'She would not have been a Clara good for much, if she had treated you
after that fashion, sir,' said James, smiling.
He gave his accustomed snort.  'The mischief a girl let alone can do in
three days, when once she's of age, and one can't stop her!  Women
ought never to come of age, ain't fit for it, undo all the work of my
lifetime with a stroke of her pen!'
'For your sake, sir!'
'Pshaw!  Pity but she'd been safe married--tied it up well with
settlements then out of her power.  Can't think what that young
Fitzjocelyn was after--it ain't the old affair.  Ponsonby writes me
that things are to be settled as soon as Ward comes back.'
'Indeed!'
'Aye, good sort of fellow--no harm to have him in our concerns--I hope
he'll look into the accounts, and find what Robson is at.  After all, I
shall soon be out there myself, and make Master Robson look about him.
Mad to allow myself to stay--but I'll wait no longer. Morrison may put
the fellows off'--I'll give him a hint; we'll save the place, after
all, when I once get out to Lima.  If only I knew what to do with that
girl!'
James could not look at him without a conviction that he would never
recover the use of his hand and foot; but this was no time to
discourage his spirits, and the answer was--'My sister's natural home
would be with me.'
'Ha! the child would like it, I suppose.  I'd make a handsome allowance
for her.  I shall manage that when my affairs are in my own hands; but
I may as well write to the mountains as to Ponsonby.  Aye, aye!  Clara
might go to you.  She'll have enough any way to be quite worth young
Fitzjocelyn's while, you may tell him.  That mine in the San Benito
would retrieve all, and I'll not forget.  Pray, how many children have
you by this time?'
'Four little girls, sir,' said James, restraining the feeling which was
rising in the contact with his uncle, revealing that both were still
the same men.
'Hm!  No time lost, however!  Well, we shall see!  Any way, an
allowance for Clara's board won't hurt.  What's your notion?'
James's notion was profound pity for the poor old man.  'Indeed, sir,'
he said, 'Clara is sure to be welcome.  All we wish is, that you would
kindly bring her to us at once.  Perhaps you would find the baths of
service; we would do our utmost to make you comfortable, and we are not
inhabiting half the house, so that there would be ample space to keep
the children from inconveniencing you.'
'Clara is set on it, I'll warrant.'
'Clara waits to be guided by your wishes; but my wife and I should
esteem it as the greatest favour you could do us.'
'Ha! we'll see what I can manage.  I must see Morrison'--and he fell
into meditation, presently breaking from it to say fretfully, 'I say,
Roland, would you reach me that tumbler?'
Never had James thought to be grateful for that name!  He would gladly
have been Roland Dynevor for the rest of his days, if he could have
left behind him the transgressions of James Frost!  But the poor man's
shattered thoughts had been too long on the stretch; and, without
further ceremony, Jane came in and dismissed his nephew.
Clara hardly trusted her ears when she was told shortly after, by her
uncle, that they were to go to Northwold.  Roland wished it; and, poor
fellow! the board and lodging were a great object to him.  He seemed to
have come to his senses now it was too late; and if Clara wished it,
and did not think it dull, there she might stay while he himself was
gone to Lima.
'A great object the other way,' Clara had nearly cried, in her
indignation that James could not be supposed disinterested in an
invitation to an old man, who probably was destitute.
Brother and uncle appeared to have left her out of the consultation;
but she was resolved not to let him be a burthen on those who had so
little already, and she called her old friend Jane to take counsel with
her, whether it would not be doing them an injury to carry him thither
at all.  So much of Jane's heart as was not at Cheveleigh was at
Dynevor Terrace, and her answer was decided.
'To be sure, Miss Clara, nothing couldn't be more natural.'
'Nothing, indeed, but I can't put them to trouble and expense.'
'I'll warrant,' said Jane, 'that I'll make whatever they have go twice
as far as Charlotte ever will.  Why, you know I keeps myself; and for
the rest, it will be a mere saving to have me in the kitchen! There's
no air so good for Master Oliver.'
'I see you mean to go, Jane,' said Clara.  'Now, I have to look out for
myself.'
'Bless me, Miss Clara, don't you do nothing in a hurry.  Go home quiet
and look about you.'
Jane had begun to call Northwold home; and, in spite of her mournings
over the old place, Clara thought she had never been so happy there as
in her present dominion over Master Oliver, and her prospects of her
saucepans and verbenas at No. 5.
Poor Oliver! what a scanty measure of happiness had his lifelong
exertions produced!  Many a human sacrifice has been made to a grim and
hollow idol, failing his devotees in time of extremity.  Had it not
been thus with Oliver Dynevor's self-devotion to the honour of his
family?
CHAPTER XIX.
FAREWELL TO GREATNESS.
Soon from the halls my fathers reared
Their scutcheons must descend.
Scott
Mr. Holdsworth contrived to set James at liberty for a fortnight, and
he was thus enabled to watch over the negotiation, and expedite matters
for the removal.  The result was, that the resignation of the estate,
furniture, and of Clara's jewels, honourably cleared off the debts
contracted in poor Mr. Dynevor's eagerness to reinstate the family in
all its pristine grandeur, and left him totally dependent on whatever
might be rescued in Peru.  He believed this to be considerable, but the
brother and sister founded little hopes on the chance; as, whatever
there might be, had been entangled in the Equatorial Company, and
nothing could be less comprehensible than Mr. Robson's statements.
Clara retained her own seventy pounds per annum, which, thrown into the
common stock, would, James assured her, satisfy him, in a pecuniary
point of view, that he was doing no wrong to his children; though he
added, that even if there had been nothing, he did not believe they
would ever be the worse for what might be spent on their infirm old
uncle.
Notice was sent to Isabel to prepare, and she made cordial reply that
the two rooms on the ground-floor were being made ready for Mr.
Dynevor, and Clara's own little room being set in order; Miss Mercy
Faithfull helping with all her might, and little Kitty stamping about,
thinking her services equally effectual.
Oliver was in haste to leave a place replete with disappointment and
failure, and was so helpless and dependent as to wish for his nephew's
assistance on the journey; and it was, therefore, fixed for the end of
James's second week.  No one called to take leave, except the Curate
and good Mr. Henderson, who showed Clara much warm, kind feeling, and
praised her to her brother.
She begged James to walk with her for a farewell visit to her
grandmother's other old friend.  Great was her enjoyment of this
expedition; she said she had not had a walk worth having since she was
at Aix-la-Chapelle, and liberty and companionship compensated for all
the heat and dust in the dreary tract, full of uncomfortable
shabby-genteel abodes, and an unpromising population.
'One cannot regret such a tenantry,' said Clara.
'Poor creatures!' said James.  'I wonder into whose hands they will
fall.  Your heart may be free, Clara; you have followed the clear path
of duty; but it is a painful thought for me, that to strive to amend
these festering evils, caused very likely by my grandfather's
speculations, might have been my appointed task.  I should not have had
far to seek for occupation.  When I was talking to the Curate
yesterday, my heart smote me to think what I might have done to help
him.'
'It would all have been over now.'
'It ought not.  Nay, perhaps, my presence might have left my uncle free
to attend to his own concerns.'
'I really believe you are going to regret the place!'
'After all, Clara, I was a Dynevor before my uncle came home.  It might
have been my birthright.  But, as Isabel says, what we are now is far
more likely to be safe for the children.  I was bad enough as I was,
but what should I have been as a pampered heir!  Let it go.'
'Yes, let it go,' said Clara; 'it has been little but pain to me.  We
shall teach my poor uncle that home love is better than old family
estates.  I almost wish he may recover nothing in Peru, that he may
learn that you receive him for his own sake.'
'That is more than I can wish,' said James.  'A hundred or two a-year
would come in handily.  Besides, I am afraid that Mary Ponsonby may be
suffering in this crash.'
'She seems to have taken care of herself,' said Clara.  'She does not
write to me, and I am almost ready to believe her father at last.  I
could not have thought it of her!'
'Isabel has always said it was the best thing that could happen to
Louis.'
'Isabel never had any notion of Louis.  I don't mean any offence, but
if she had known what he was made of, she would never have had you.'
'Thank you, Clara!  I always thought it an odd predilection, but no one
can now esteem Fitzjocelyn more highly than ahe does.'
'Very likely; but if she thinks Louis can stand Mary's deserting him--'
'It will be great pain, no doubt; but once over, he will be free.'
'It never will be over.'
'That is young-ladyism.'
'I never was a young lady, and I know what I mean.  Mary may not be all
he thinks her, and she may be dull enough to let her affection wear
out; but I do not believe he will ever look at any one again, as he did
after Mary on your wedding-day.'
'So you forbid him to be ever happy again!'
'Not at all, only in that one way.  There are many others of being
happy.'
'That one way meaning marriage.'
'I mean that sort of perfect marriage that, according to the saying, is
made in heaven.  Whether that could have been with Mary, I do not know
her well enough to guess; but I am convinced that he will always have
the same kind of memory of her that a man has of a first love, or first
wife.'
'It may have been a mistake to drive him into the attachment, which
Isabel thinks has been favoured by absence, leaving scope for
imagination; but I cannot give up the hope that his days of happiness
are yet to come.'
'Nor do I give up Mary, yet,' said Clara.  'Till she announces her
defection I shall not believe it, for it would be common honesty to
inform poor Louis, and in that she never was deficient.'
'It is not a plant that seems to thrive on the Peruvian soil.'
'No; and I am dreadfully afraid for Tom Madison.  There were hints
about him in Mr. Ponsonby's letters, which make me very anxious; and
from what my uncle says, it seems that there is such an atmosphere of
gambling and trickery about his office, that he thinks it a matter of
course that no one should be really true and honest.'
'That would be a terrible affair indeed!  I don't know for which I
should be most concerned, Louis or our poor little Charlotte.  But
after all, Clara, we have known too many falsehoods come across the
Atlantic, to concern ourselves about anything without good reason.'
So they talked, enjoying the leisure the walk gave them for
conversation, and then paying the painful visit, when Clara tried in
vain to make it understood by the poor old lady that she was going
away, and that James was her brother.  They felt thankful that such
decay had been spared their grandmother, and Clara sighed to think that
her uncle might be on the brink of a like loss of faculties, and then
felt herself more than ever bound to him.
On the way home they went together to the church, and pondered over the
tombs of their ancestry,--ranging from the grim, defaced old knight,
through the polished brass, the kneeling courtier, and the dishevelled
Grief embracing an urn, down to the mural arch enshrining the dear
revered name of Catharine, daughter of Roland, and wife of James Frost
Dynevor, the last of her line whose bones would rest there.  Her grave
had truly been the sole possession that her son's labours had secured
for her; that grave was the only spot at Cheveleigh that claimed a pang
from Clara's heart.  She stood beside it with deep, fond, clinging love
and reverence, but with no painful recollections to come between her
and that fair, bright vision of happy old age.  Alas! for the memories
that her brother had sown to spring up round him now!
Apart from all these vipers of his own creating, James after all felt
more in the cession of Cheveleigh than did his sister.  These were days
of change and of feudal feeling wearing out; but James, long as he had
pretended to scorn 'being sentimental about his forefathers,' was
strongly susceptible of such impressions; and he was painfully
conscious of being disinherited.  He might have felt thus, without any
restoration or loss, as the mere effect of visiting his birthright as a
stranger; but, as he received all humbly instead of proudly, the
feeling did him no harm.  It softened him into sympathy with his uncle,
and tardy appreciation of his single-minded devotion to the estate,
which he had won not for himself, but for others, only to see it first
ungratefully rejected, and then snatched away.  Then, with a thrill of
humiliation at his own unworthiness, came the earnest prayer that it
might yet be vouchsafed to him to tend the exhausted body, and train
the contracted mind to dwell on that inheritance whence there could be
no casting out.
Poor Oliver was fretful and restless, insisting on being brought down
to his study to watch over the packing of his papers, and miserable at
being unable to arrange them himself.  Even the tenderest pity for him
could not prevent him from being an exceeding trial; and James could
hardly yet have endured it, but for pleasure and interest in watching
his sister's lively good-humour, saucy and determined when the old man
was unreasonable, and caressing and affectionate, when he was violent
in his impotence; never seeming to hear, see, or regard anything unkind
or unpleasant; and absolutely pleased and gratified when her uncle, in
his petulance, sometimes ungraciously rejected her services in favour
of those of 'Roland,' who, he took it for granted, must, as a man, have
more sense.  It would sometimes cross James, how would Isabel and the
children fare with this ill-humour; but he had much confidence in his
wife's sweet calm temper, and more in the obvious duty; and, on the
whole, he believed it was better not to think about it.
The suffering that the surrender cost Oliver was only shown in this
species of petty fractiousness, until the last morning, when his nephew
was helping him across the hall, and Clara close at his side, he made
them stand still beside one of the pillars, and groaned as he said,
'Here I waited for the carriage last time!  Here I promised to get it
back again!'
'I wish every one kept promises as you did,' said James, looking about
for something cheerful to say.
'I had hope then,' said Oliver; and well might he feel the contrast
between the youth, with such hopes, energies, and determination mighty
within him, and the broken and disappointed man.
'Hope yet, and better hope!' James could not help saying.
'Not while there's such a rascal in the office at Lima,' cried Oliver,
testily.
'Oh! Uncle Oliver, he did not mean that!' exclaimed Clara.
Mr. Dynevor grumbled something about parsons, which neither of them
chose to hear; and Clara cut it short by saying, 'After all, Uncle
Oliver, you have done it all!  Dear grandmamma came back and was happy
here, and that was all that signified.  You never wanted it for
yourself, you know, and my dear father was not here to have it.  And
for you, what could you have had more than your nephew and niece to--to
try to be like your children!  And hadn't you rather have them without
purchase than with?'  And as she saw him smile in answer to her bright
caress, she added merrily, 'There's nothing else to pity but the fir
trees and gold fish; and as they have done very happily before without
the Pendragon reign, I dare any they will again; so I can't be very
sorry for them!'
This was Clara's farewell to her greatness, and cheerily she enlivened
her uncle all the way to London, and tried to solace him after the
interviews that he insisted on with various men of business, and which
did not tend to make him stronger in health or spirits through the next
day's journey.
The engine whistled its arriving shriek at Northwold.  Happy Clara!
What was the summer rain to her?  Every house, every passenger, were
tokens of home; and the damp rain-mottled face of the Terrace, looking
like a child that had been crying, was more welcome to her longing eyes
than ever had been lake or mountain.
Isabel and little Catharine stood on the step; but as Mr. Dynevor was
lifted out, the little girl shrank out of sight with a childish awe of
infirmity.  The dining-room had been made a very comfortable
sitting-room for him, and till he was settled there, nothing else could
be attended to; but he was so much fatigued, that it was found best to
leave him entirely to Jane; and Clara, after a few moments, followed
her brother from the room.
As she shut the door, she stood for some seconds unobserved, and
unwilling to interfere with the scene before her.  Halfway upstairs,
James had been pulled down to sit on the steps, surrounded by his
delighted flock.  The baby was in his arms, flourishing her hands as he
danced her; Kitty, from above, had clasped tightly round his neck,
chattering and kissing with breathless velocity; one twin in front was
drumming on his knee, and shrieking in accordance with every shout of
the baby; and below, leaning on the balusters, stood their mother's
graceful figure, looking up at them with a lovely smiling face of
perfect gladness.  She was the first to perceive Clara; and, with a
pretty gesture to be silent, she pointed to the stand of the Wedgewood
jar, under which sat the other little maid, her two fat arms clasped
tight round her papa's umbrella, and the ivory handle indenting her
rosy cheek, as she fondled it in silent transport.
'My little Salome,' whispered Isabel, squeezing Clara's hand, 'our
quiet one.  She could not sleep for expecting papa, and now she is in a
fit of shy delight; she can't shout with the others; she can only nurse
his umbrella.'
Just then James made a desperate demonstration, amid peals of laughter
from his daughters.  'We are stopping the way!  Get out, you unruly
monsters!  Let go, Kitty--Mercy; I shall kick!  Mamma, catch this
ball;' making a feint of tossing the crowing Fanny at her.
Assuredly, thought Clara, pity was wasted; there was not one too many.
And then began the happy exulting introductions, and a laugh at little
Mercy, who stood blank and open-mouthed, gazing up and up her tall
aunt, as if there were no coming to the top of her.  Clara sat down on
the stairs, to bring her face to a level, and struck up a friendship
with her on the spot, while James lilted up his little Salome, her joy
still too deep and reserved for manifestation; only without a word she
nestled close to him, laid her head on his shoulder, and closed her
eyes, as if languid with excess of rapture--a pretty contrast to her
sister's frantic delight, which presently alarmed James lest it should
disturb his uncle, and he called them up-stairs.
But Clara must first run to the House Beautiful, and little Mercy must
needs come to show her the way, and trotted up before her,
consequentially announcing, 'Aunt Cara.'  Miss Faithfull alone was
present; and, without speaking, Clara dropped on the ground, laid her
head on her dear old friend's lap, and little Mercy exclaimed, in
wondering alarm, 'Aunt Cara naughty--Aunt Cara crying!'
'My darling,' said Miss Faithfull, as she kissed Clara's brow and
stroked her long flaxen hair, 'you have gone through a great deal. We
must try to make you happy in your poor old home.'
'Oh, no! oh, no!  It is happiness!  Oh! such happiness! but I don't
know what to do with it, and I want granny!'
She was almost like little Salome; the flood of bliss in returning
home, joined with the missing of the one dearest welcome, had come on
her so suddenly that she was almost stifled, till she had been calmed
and soothed by the brief interval of quiet with her dear old friend.
She returned to No. 5, there to find that her uncle was going to bed,
and Charlotte, pink and beautiful with delight, was running about in
attendance on Jane.  She went up straight to her own little room, which
had been set out exactly as in former times, so that she could feel as
if she had been not a day absent; and she lost not a moment in adding
to it all the other little treasures which made it fully like her own.
She looked out at the Ormersfield trees, and smiled to think how well
Louis's advice had turned out; and then she sighed, in the fear that it
might yet be her duty to leave home.  If her uncle could live without
her, she must tear herself away, and work for his maintenance.
However, for the present, she might enjoy to the utmost, and she
proceeded to the little parlour, which, to her extreme surprise, she
found only occupied by the four children--Kitty holding the youngest
upon her feet, till, at the new apparition, Fanny suddenly seated
herself for the convenience of staring.
'Are you all alone here!' exclaimed Clara.
'I am taking care of the little ones,' replied Kitty, with dignity.
'Where's mamma!'
'She is gone down to get tea.  Papa is gone to the Union; but we do not
mean to wait for him,' answered the little personage, with an air
capable, the more droll because she was on the smallest scale, of much
less substance than the round fat twins, and indeed chiefly
distinguishable from them by her slender neat shape; for the faces were
at first sight all alike, brown, small-featured, with large dark eyes,
and dark curly hair--Mercy, with the largest and most impetuous eyes,
and Salome with a dreamy look, more like her mother.  Fanny was in a
different style, and much prettier; but her contemplation ended in
alarm and inclination to cry, whereupon Kitty embraced her, and
consoled her like a most efficient guardian; then seeing Mercy becoming
rather rude in her familiarities with her aunt, held up her small
forefinger, and called out gravely, 'Mercy, recollect yourself!'
Wonders would never cease!  Here was Isabel coming up with the tea-tray
in her own hands!
'My dear, do you always do that?'
'No, only when Charlotte is busy; and,' as she picked up the baby, 'now
Kitty may bring the rest.'
So, in various little journeys, the miniature woman's curly head arose
above the loaf, and the butter-dish, and even the milk-jug, held
without spilling; while Isabel would have set out the tea-things with
one hand, if Clara had not done it for her; and the workhouse girl
finally appeared with the kettle.
Was this the same Isabel whom Clara last remembered with her baby in
her lap, beautiful and almost as inanimate as a statue?  There was
scarcely more change from the long-frocked infant to the bustling
important sprite, than from that fair piece of still life to the active
house-mother.  Unruffled grace was innate; every movement had a lofty,
placid deliberation and simplicity, that made her like a disguised
princess; and though her beauty was a little worn, what it had lost in
youth was far more than compensated by sweetness and animation.  The
pensive cast remained, but the dreaminess had sobered into thought and
true hope.  Her dress was an old handsome silk, frayed and worn, but so
becoming to her, that the fading was unnoticed in the delicate neatness
of the accompaniments.  And the dear old room!  It looked like a
cheerful habitation; but Clara's almost instant inquiry was for the
porcelain Arcadians, and could not think it quite as tidy and orderly
as it used to be in old times, when she was the only fairy Disorder.
'However, I'll see to that,' quoth she to herself.  And she gave
herself up to the happy tea-drinking, when James was welcomed by
another tumult, and was pinned down by Kitty and Salome on either
side--mamma making tea in spite of Fanny on her lap--Mercy adhering to
the new-comer--the eager conversation--Kitty thrusting in her little
oar, and being hushed by mamma--the grand final game at romps, ending
with Isabel carrying off her little victims, one by one, to bed; and
James taking the tea-tray down stairs.  Clara followed with other parts
of the equipage, and then both stood together warming themselves, and
gossiped over the dear old kitchen fire, till Isabel came down and
found them there. And then, before any of the grand news was discussed,
all the infant marvels of the last fortnight had to be detailed; and
the young parents required Clara's opinion whether they were spoiling
Kitty.
Next, Clara found her way to the cupboard, brought the shepherd and
shepherdess to light, looked them well over, and satisfied herself that
there was not one scar or wound on either--nay, it is not absolutely
certain that she did not kiss the damsel's delicate pink cheek--set
them up on the mantelpiece, promised to keep them in order, and stood
gazing at them till James accused her of regarding them as her penates!
'Why, Jem!' she said, turning on him, 'you are a mere recreant if you
can feel it like home without them!'
'I have other porcelain figures to depend on for a home!' said James.
'Take care, James!' said his wife, with the fond sadness of one whose
cup overflowed with happiness; 'Clara's shepherdess may look fragile,
but she has kept her youth and seen many a generation pass by of such
as you depend on!'
'She once was turned out of Cheveleigh, too, and has borne it as easily
as Clara,' said James, smiling.  'I suspect her worst danger is from
Fanny.  There's a lady who, I warn you, can never withstand Fanny!'
Isabel took up her own defence, and they laughed on.  Poor Uncle
Oliver! could he but have known how little all this had to do with
Cheveleigh!
CHAPTER XX.
WESTERN TIDINGS.
O lady! worthy of earth's proudest throne!
Nor less, by excellence of nature, fit
Beside an unambitious hearth to sit
Domestic queen, where grandeur is unknown--
Queen and handmaid lowly.
WORDSWORTH.
A house in the Terrace was let, and the rent was welcome; and shortly
after, Clara had an affectionate letter from her old school-enemy, Miss
Salter, begging her to come as governess to her little brother,
promising that she should be treated like one of the family, and
offering a large salary.
Clara was much afraid that it was her duty to accept the proposal,
since her uncle seemed very fairly contented, and was growing very fond
of 'Roland,' and the payment would be so great an assistance, but James
and Isabel were strongly averse to it; and her conscience was satisfied
by Miss Mercy Faithfull's discovery of a family at the Baths in search
of a daily governess.
Miss Frost was not a person to be rejected, and in another week she
found herself setting out to breakfast with a girl and three boys,
infusing Latin, French, and geography all the forenoon, dining with
them, sometimes walking with them, and then returning to the merry
evening of Dynevor Terrace.
Mr. Dynevor endured the step pretty well.  She had ascendancy enough
over him always to take her own way, and he was still buoyed up by the
hope of recovering enough to rectify his affairs in Peru.  He was
better, though his right side remained paralysed, and Mr. Walby saw
little chance of restoration.  Rising late, and breakfasting slowly,
the newspaper and visits from James wiled away the morning.  He
preferred taking his meals alone; and after dinner was wheeled out in a
chair on fine days.  Clara came to him as soon as her day's work was
over; and, when he was well enough to bear it, the whole party were
with him from the children's bedtime till his own.  Altogether, the
invalid-life passed off pretty well.  He did not dislike the children,
and Kitty liked anything that needed to be waited on.  He took Clara's
services as a right, but was a little afraid of 'Mrs. Dynevor,' and
highly flattered by any attention from her; and with James his moods
were exceedingly variable, and often very trying, but, in general, very
well endured.
Peruvian mails were anticipated in the family with a feeling most akin
to dread.  The notice of a vessel coming in was the signal for
growlings at everything, from the post-office down to his dinner; and
the arrival of letters made things only worse.  As Clara said, the
galleons were taken by the pirates; the Equatorial Company seemed to be
doing the work of Caleb Balderston's thunderstorm, and to be bearing
the blame of a deficit such as Oliver could not charge on it. The whole
statement was backed by Mr. Ponsonby, whose short notes spoke of
indisposition making him more indebted than ever to the exertions of
Robson.  This last was gone to Guayaquil to attempt to clear up the
accounts of the Equatorial Company, leaving the office at Lima in the
charge of Madison and the new clerk, Ford; and Mr. Dynevor was promised
something decisive and satisfactory on his return.  Of Mary there was
no mention, except what might be inferred in a postscript:--'Ward is
expected in a few weeks.'
Mr. Dynevor was obliged to resign himself; and so exceedingly fractious
was he, that Clara had been feeling quite dispirited, when her brother
called her to tell her joyously that Lord Ormersfield and Louis were
coming home, and would call in on their way the next evening.  Those
wretched children must not take her for a walk.
Nevertheless, the wretched children did want to walk, and Clara could
not get home till half-an-hour after she knew the train must have come
in; and she found the visitors in her uncle's room.  Louis came forward
to the door to meet her, and shook her hand with all his heart, saying,
under his breath,
'I congratulate you!'
'Thank you!' she said, in the same hearty tone.
'And now, look at him! look at my father!  Have not we made a good
piece of work of keeping him abroad all the winter?  Does not he look
as well as ever he did in his life?'
This was rather strong, for Lord Ormersfield was somewhat grey, and a
little bent; but he had resumed all his look of health and vigour, and
was a great contrast to his younger, but far older-looking cousin.  He
welcomed Clara with his tone of courteous respect, and smiled at his
son's exultation, saying, Fitzjocelyn deserved all the credit, for he
himself had never thought to be so patched up again, and poor Oliver
was evidently deriving as much encouragement as if rheumatism had been
paralysis.
'I must look in at the House Beautiful,' said Louis, presently. 'Clara,
I can't lose your company.  Won't you come with me?'
Of course she came; and she divined why, instead of at once entering
the next house, he took a turn along the Terrace, and, after a pause,
asked, 'Clara, when did you last hear from Lima?'
'Not for a long time.  I suppose she is taken up by her father's
illness.'
He paused, collected himself, and asked again, 'Have you heard nothing
from your uncle?'
'Yes,' said Clara, sadly, 'but Louis,' she added, with a lively tone,
'what does not come from herself, I would not believe.'
'I do not.'
'That's right, don't be vexed when it may be nothing.'
'No; if she had found any one more worthy of her, she would not
hesitate in making me aware of it.  I ought to be satisfied, if she
does what is best for her own happiness.  Miss Ponsonby believes that
this is a man of sterling worth, probably suiting her better than I
might have done.  She was a good deal driven on by circumstances
before, and, perhaps, it was all a mistake on her side.'  And he tried
to smile.
Clara exclaimed that 'Mary could not have been all he had believed,
if--'
'No,' he said, 'she is all, and more than all.  I comprehend her better
now, and could have shown her that I do.  She has been the blessing of
my life so far, and her influence always will be so.  I shall always be
grateful to her, be the rest as it may, and I mean to live on hope to
the last.  Now for the good old ladies.  Really, Clara, the old Dynevor
Terrace atmosphere has come back, and there seems to be the same sort
of rest and cheering in coming into these old iron gates!  After all,
Isabel is growing almost worthy to be called Mrs. Frost.'  And in this
manner he talked on, up to the very door of the House Beautiful, as if
to cheat himself out of despondency.
'That was a very pretty meeting,' said Isabel to her husband, when no
witness was present but little Fanny.
'What, between his lordship and my uncle?'
'You know better.'
'My dear, your mother once tried match-making for Fitzjocelyn.  Be
warned by her example.'
'I am doing no such thing.  I am only observing what every one sees.'
'Don't be so common-place.'
'That's all disdain--you must condescend.  I have been hearing from Mr.
Dynevor of the excellent offers that Clara refused.'
'Do you think Uncle Oliver and Clara agree as to excellence?'
'Still,' continued Isabel, 'considering how uncomfortable she was, it
does not seem improbable that she would have married, unless some
attachment had steeled her heart and raised her standard.  I know she
was unconscious, but it was Fitzjocelyn who formed her.'
'He has been a better brother to her than I have been; but look only at
their perfect ease.'
'Now it is my belief that they were made for each other, and can
venture to find it out, since she is no longer an heiress, and he is
free from his Peruvian entanglement.'
'Fanny, do you hear what a scheming mamma you have?  I hope she will
have used it all upon Sir Hubert before you come out as the beauty of
the Terrace!'
'Well, I mean to sound Clara.'
'You had better leave it alone.'
'Do you forbid me?'
'Why, no, for I don't think you have the face to say anything that
would distress her, or disturb the friendship which has been her
greatest benefit.'
'Thank you.  All I intend is, that if it should be as I suppose, the
poor things should not miss coming to an understanding for want--'
'Of a Christmas-tree,' said James, laughing.  'You may have your own
way.  I have too much confidence in your discretion and in theirs to
imagine that you will produce the least effect.'
Isabel's imagination was busily at work, and she was in haste to make
use of her husband's permission; but it was so difficult to see Clara
alone, that some days passed before the two sisters were left together
in the sitting-room, while James was writing a letter for his uncle.
Isabel's courage began to waver, but she ventured a commencement.
'Mr. Dynevor entertains me with fine stories of your conquests, Clara.'
Clara laughed, blushed, and answered bluntly, 'What a bother it was!'
'You are very hard-hearted.'
'You ought to remember the troubles of young ladyhood enough not to
wonder.'
'I never let things run to that length; but then I had no fortune. But
seriously, Clara, were all these people objectionable?'
'Do you think one could marry any man, only because he was not
objectionable?  There was no harm in one or two; but I was not going to
have anything to say to them.'
'Really, Clara, you make me curious.  Had you made any resolution?'
'I know only two men whom I could have trusted to fulfil my
conditions,' said Clara.
'Conditions?'
'Of course! that if Cheveleigh was to belong to any of us, it should be
to the rightful heir.'
'My dear, noble Clara! was that what kept you from thinking of
marriage?'
'Wasn't it a fine thing to have such a test?  Not that I ever came to
trying it.  Simple no answered my purpose.  I met no one who tempted me
to make the experiment.'
'Two men!' said Isabel, 'if you had said one, it would have been
marked.'
'Jem and Louis, of course,' said Clara.
'Oh! that is as good as saying one.'
'As good as saying none,' said Clara, with emphasis.
'There may be different opinions on that point,' returned Isabel, not
daring to lift her eyes from her work, though longing to study Clara's
face, and feeling herself crimsoning.
'Extremely unfounded opinions, and rather--'
'Rather what?'
'Impertinent, I was going to say, begging your pardon, dear Isabel.'
'Nay, I think it is I who should beg yours, Clara.'
'No, no,' said Clara, laughing, but speaking gravely immediately after,
'lookers-on do not always see most of the game.  I have always known
his mind so well that I could never possibly have fallen into any such
nonsense.  I respect him far too much.'
Isabel felt as if she must hazard a few words more--'Can you guess what
he will do if Mr. Ponsonby's reports prove true?'
'I do not mean to anticipate misfortunes,' said Clara.
Isabel could say no more; and when Clara next spoke, it was to ask for
another of James's wristbands to stitch.  Then Isabel ventured to peep
at her face, and saw it quite calm, and not at all rosy; if it had
been, the colour was gone.
Thus it was, and there are happily many such friendships existing as
that between Louis and Clara.  Many a woman has seen the man whom she
might have married, and yet has not been made miserable.  If there be
neither vanity nor weak self-contemplation on her side, nor trifling on
his part, nor unwise suggestions forced on her by spectators, the
honest, genuine affection need never become passion.  If intimacy is
sometimes dangerous, it is because vanity, folly, and mistakes are too
frequent; but in spite of all these, where women are truly refined, and
exalted into companions and friends, there has been much more happy,
frank intercourse and real friendship than either the romantic or the
sagacious would readily allow.  The spark is never lighted, there is no
consciousness, no repining, and all is well.
Fresh despatches from Lima arrived; and after a day, when Oliver had
been so busy overlooking the statement from Guayaquil that he would not
even take his usual airing, he received Clara with orders to write and
secure his passage by the next packet for Callao.
'Dear uncle, you would never dream of it!  You could not bear the
journey!' she cried, aghast.
'It would do me good. Do not try to cross me, Clara.  No one else can
deal with this pack of rascals.  Your brother has not been bred to it,
and is a parson besides, and there's not a soul that I can trust. I'll
go.  What! d'ye think I can live on him and on you, when there is a
competence of my own out there, embezzled among those ragamuffins?'
'I am sure we had much rather--'
'No stuff and nonsense.  Here is Roland with four children
already--very likely to have a dozen more.  If you and he are fools,
I'm not, and I won't take the bread out of their mouths.  I'll leave my
will behind, bequeathing whatever I may get out of the fire evenly
between you two, as the only way to content you; and if I never turn up
again, why you're rid of the old man.'
'Very well, uncle, I shall take my own passage at the same time.'
'You don't know what you are talking of.  You are a silly child, and
your brother would be a worse if he let you go.'
'If Jem lets you go, he will let me.  He shall let me.  Don't you know
that you are never to have me off your hands, uncle?  No, no, I shall
stick to you like a burr.  You may go up to the tip-top of Chimborazo
if you please, but you'll not shake me off.'
It was her fixed purpose to accompany him, and she was not solicitous
to dissuade him from going, for she could be avaricious for James's
children, and had a decided wish for justice on the guilty party; and,
besides, Clara had a private vision of her own, which made her dance in
her little room.  Mary had written in her father's stead--there was not
a word of Mr. Ward--indeed, Mr. Ponsonby was evidently so ill that his
daughter could think of nothing else.  Might not Clara come in time to
clear up any misunderstanding--convince Mr. Ponsonby--describe Louis's
single-hearted constancy during all these five years, and bring Mary
home to him in triumph?  She could have laughed aloud with delight at
the possibility; and when the other alternative occurred to her, she
knit her brows with childish vehemence, as she promised Miss Mary that
she would never be her bridesmaid.
Presently she heard Fitzjocelyn's voice in the parlour, and, going
down, found him in consultation over a letter which Charlotte had
brought to her master.  It was so well written and expressed, that
Louis turned to the signature before he could quite believe that it was
from his old pupil.  Tom wrote to communicate his perplexity at the
detection of the frauds practised on his employers.  He had lately been
employed in the office at Lima, where much had excited his suspicion;
and, finally, from having 'opened a letter addressed by mistake to the
firm, but destined for an individual, he had discovered that large
sums, supposed to be required by the works, or lost in the Equatorial
failure, had been, in fact, invested in America in the name of that
party.'  The secret was a grievous burthen.  Mr. Ponsonby was far too
ill to be informed; besides that, he should only bring suspicion on
himself; and Miss Ponsonby was so much occupied as to be almost equally
inaccessible.  Tom had likewise reason to believe that his own
movements were watched, and that any attempt to communicate with her or
her father would be baffled; and, above all, he could not endure
himself to act the spy and informer. He only wished that, if possible,
without mentioning names, Charlotte could give a hint that Mr. Dynevor
must not implicitly trust to all he heard.
James was inclined to suppress such vague information, which he thought
would only render his uncle more restless and wretched in his
helplessness, and was only questioning whether secrecy would not amount
to deceit.
'The obvious thing is for me to go to Peru,' said Louis.
'My uncle and I were intending to go,' said Clara.
'How many more of you?' exclaimed James.
'I would not change my native land
For rich Peru and all her gold;'
chanted little Kitty from the corner, where she was building houses for
the 'little ones.'
'Extremely to the purpose,' said Louis, laughing.  'Follow her example,
Clara.  Make your uncle appoint me his plenipotentiary, and I will try
what I can to find out what these rogues are about.'
'Are you in earnest?'
'Never more so in my life.'
James beckoned him to the window, and showed him a sentence where Tom
said that the best chance for the firm was in Miss Ponsonby's marriage
with Mr. Ward, but that engagement was not yet declared on account of
her father's illness.
'The very reason,' said Louis, 'I cannot go on in this way.  I must
know the truth.'
'And your father?'
'It would be much better for him that the thing were settled.  He will
miss me less during the session, when he is in London with all his old
friends about him.  It would not take long, going by the Isthmus.  I'll
ride back at once, and see how he bears the notion. Say nothing to Mr.
Dynevor till you hear from me; but I think he will consent.  He will
not endure that she should be left unprotected; her father perhaps
dying, left to the mercy of these rascals.'
'And forgive me, Louis, if you found her not needing you!'
'If she be happy, I should honour the man who made her so.  At least, I
might be of use to you.  I should see after poor Madison.  I have sent
him to the buccaneers indeed!  Good-bye!  I cannot rest till I see how
my father takes it!'
It was long since Louis had been under an excess of impetuosity; but he
rode home as fast as he had ridden to Northwold to canvass for James,
and had not long been at Ormersfield before his proposition was laid
before his father.
It was no small thing to ask of the Earl, necessary as his son had
become to him; and the project at first appeared to him senseless. He
thought Mary had not shown herself sufficiently sensible of his son's
merits to deserve so much trouble; and if she were engaged to Mr. Ward,
Fitzjocelyn would find himself in an unpleasant and undignified
position.  Besides, there was the ensuing session of Parliament!  No!
Oliver must send out some trustworthy man of business, with full powers.
Louis only answered, that of course it depended entirely on his
father's consent; and by-and-by his submission began to work.  Lord
Ormersfield could not refuse him anything, and took care, on parting
for the night, to observe that the point was not settled, only under
consideration.
And consideration was more favourable than might have been expected.
The Earl was growing anxious to see his son married, and of that there
was no hope till his mind should be settled with regard to Mary.  It
would be more for his peace to extinguish the hope, if it were never to
be fulfilled.  Moreover, the image of Mary had awakened the Earl's own
fatherly fondness for her, and his desire to rescue her from her
wretched home.  Even Mr. Ponsonby could hardly withstand Louis in
person, he thought, and must be touched by so many years of constancy.
The rest might be only a misunderstanding which would be cleared up by
a personal interview.  Added to this, Lord Ormersfield knew that Clara
would not let her uncle go alone, and did not think it fit to see her
go out alone with an infirm paralytic; James could not leave his wife
or his chaplaincy, and the affair was unsuited to his profession; a
mere accountant would not carry sufficient authority, nor gain
Madison's confidence; in fact, Fitzjocelyn, and no other, was the
trustworthy man of business; and so his lordship allowed when Louis
ventured to recur to the subject the next morning, and urge some of his
arguments.
The bright clearing of Louis's face spoke his thanks, and he began at
once to detail his plans for his father's comfort, Lord Ormersfield
listening as if pleased by his solicitude, though caring for little
until the light of his eyes should return.
'The next point is that you should give me a testimonial that I am a
trustworthy man of business.'
'I will ride into Northwold with you, and talk it over with Oliver.'
Here lay the knotty point; but the last five years had considerably
cultivated Fitzjocelyn's natural aptitude for figures, by his attention
to statistics, his own farming-books, and the complicated accounts of
the Ormersfield estate,--so that both his father and Richardson could
testify to his being an excellent man of business; and his coolness,
and mildness of temper, made him better calculated to deal with a rogue
than a more hasty man would have been.
They found, on arriving, that James had been talking to Mr. Walby, who
pronounced that the expedition to Lima would be mere madness for Mr.
Dynevor, since application to business would assuredly cause another
attack, and even the calculations of the previous day had made him very
unwell, and so petulant and snappish, that he could be pleased with
nothing, and treated as mere insult the proposal that he should entrust
his affairs to 'such a lad.'
Even James hesitated to influence him to accept the offer.  'I
scruple,' he said, drawing the Earl aside, 'because I thought you had a
particular objection to Fitzjocelyn's being thrown in the way of
speculations.  I thought you dreaded the fascination.'
'Thank you, James; I once did so,' said the Earl.  'I used to believe
it a family mania; I only kept it down in myself by strong resolution,
in the very sight of the consequences, but I can trust Fitzjocelyn.  He
is too indifferent to everything apart from duty to be caught by
flattering projects, and you may fully confide in his right judgment.
I believe it is the absence of selfishness or conceit that makes him so
clear-sighted.'
'What a change! what a testimony!' triumphantly thought James.  It
might be partial, but he was not the man to believe so.
That day was one of defeat; but on the following, a note from James
advised Fitzjocelyn to come and try his fortune again; Mr. Dynevor
would give no one any rest till he had seen him.
Thereupon Louis was closeted with the old merchant, who watched him
keenly, and noted every question or remark he made on the accounts;
then twinkled his eyes with satisfaction as he hit more than one of the
very blots over which Oliver had already perplexed himself.  So
clear-headed and accurate did he show himself, that he soon perceived
that Mr. Dynevor looked at him as a good clerk thrown away; and he
finally obtained from him full powers to act, to bring the villain to
condign punishment, and even, if possible, to dispose of his share in
the firm.
Miss Ponsonby was much relieved to learn that Lord Fitzjocelyn was
going out, though fearing that he might meet with disappointment; but,
at least, her brother would be undeceived as to the traitor in whom he
was confiding.  No letters were to announce Louis's intentions, lest
the enemy should take warning; but he carried several with him, to be
given or not, according to the state of affairs; and when, on his way
through London, he went to receive Miss Ponsonby's commissions, she
gave him a large packet, addressed to Mary.
'Am I to give her this at all events!' he asked, faltering.
'It would serve her right.'
'Then I should not give it to her.  Pray write another, for she does
not deserve to be wounded, however she may have decided.'
'I do not know how I shall ever forgive her,' sighed Aunt Melicent.
'People are never so unforgiving as when they have nothing to forgive.'
'Ah! Lord Fitzjocelyn, that is not your case.  This might have been far
otherwise, had I not misjudged you at first.'
'Do not believe so.  It would have been hard to think me more foolish
than I was.  This probation has been the best schooling for me; and,
let it end as it may, I shall be thankful for what has been.'
And in this spirit did he sail, and many an anxious thought followed
him, no heart beating higher than did that of little Charlotte, who
founded a great many hopes on the crisis that his coming would produce.
Seven years was a terrible time to have been engaged, and the little
workhouse girl thought her getting almost as old as Mrs. Beckett.  She
wondered whether Tom thought so too!  She did not want to think about
Martha's first cousin, who was engaged for thirty-two years to a
journeyman tailor, and when they married at last, they were both so
cross that she went out to service again at the end of a month.
Charlotte set up all her caps with Tom's favourite colour, and 'turned
Angelina' twenty times a-day.
Then came the well-known Peruvian letters, and a thin one for
Charlotte.  Without recollecting that it must have crossed Lord
Fitzjocelyn on the road, she tore it open the instant she had carried
in the parlour letters.  Alas! poor Charlotte!
'I write to you for the last time, lest you should consider yourself
any longer bound by the engagements which must long have been
distasteful.  When I say that Mr. Ford has for some months been my
colleague, you will know to what I allude, without my expressing any
further.  I am already embarked for the U. S.  My enemies have
succeeded in destroying my character and blighting my hopes.  I am at
present a fugitive from the hands of so-called justice; but I could
have borne all with a cheerful heart if you had not played me false.
You will never hear more of one who loved you faithfully.
'TH. MADISON.'
Poor Charlotte!  The wound was a great deal too deep for her usual
childish tears, or even for a single word.  She stood still, cold, and
almost unconscious till she heard a step, then she put the cruel letter
away in her bosom, and went about her work as usual.
They thought her looking very pale, and Jane now and then reproached
her with eating no more than a sparrow, and told her she was getting
into a dwining way; but she made no answer, except that she 'could do
her work.'  At last, one Sunday evening, when she had been left alone
with the children, her mistress found her sitting at the foot of her
bed, among the sleeping little ones, weeping bitterly but silently.
Isabel's kindness at length opened her heart, and she put the letter
into her hand.  Poor little thing, it was very meekly borne: 'Please
don't tell no one, ma'am,' she said; 'I couldn't hear him blamed!'
'But what does he mean?  He must be under some terrible error.  Who is
this Ford?'
'It is Delaford, ma'am, I make no doubt, though however he could have
got there!  And, oh dear me! if I had only told poor Tom the whole,
that I was a silly girl, and liked his flatteries now and then, but
constant in my heart I always was!'
Isabel could not but suppose that Delaford, if it were he, might have
exaggerated poor Charlotte's little flirtation; but there was small
comfort here, since contradiction was impossible.  The U. S., over
which the poor child had puzzled in vain, was no field in which to
follow him up--he had not even dated his letter; and it was a very,
very faint hope that Lord Fitzjocelyn might trace him out, especially
as he had evidently fled in disgrace; and poor Charlotte sobbed
bitterly over his troubles, as well as her own.
She was better after she had told her mistress, though still she shrank
from any other sympathy.  Even Jane's pity would have been too much for
her, and her tender nature was afraid of the tongues that would have
discussed her grief.  Perhaps the high-toned nature of Isabel was the
very best to be brought into contact with the poor girl's spirit, which
was of the same order, and many an evening did Isabel sit in the
twilight, beside the children's beds, talking to her, or sometimes
reading a few lines to show her how others had suffered in the same
way.  'It is my own fault,' said poor Charlotte; 'it all came of my
liking to be treated like one above the common, and it serves me right.
Yes, ma'am, that was a beautiful text you showed me last night, I
thought of it all day, and I'll try to believe that good will come out
of it.  I am sure you are very good to let me love the children!  I'm
certain sure Miss Salome knows that I'm in trouble, for she never fails
to run and kiss me the minute she comes in sight; and she'll sit so
quiet in my lap, the little dear, and look at me as much as to say,
'Charlotte, I wish I could comfort you.'  But it was all my own fault,
ma'am, and I think I could feel as if I was punished right, so I knew
poor Tom was happy.'
'Alas!' thought Isabel, after hearing Charlotte's reminiscences; 'how
close I have lived to a world of which I was in utter ignorance!  How
little did we guess that, by the careless ease and inattention of our
household, we were carrying about a firebrand, endangering not only
poor Walter, but doing fearful harm wherever we went!'
CHAPTER XXI.
STEPPING WESTWARD.
On Darien's sands and deadly dew.
Rokeby.
Enterprise and speed both alike directed Fitzjocelyn's course across
the Isthmus of Panama, which in 1853 had newly become practicable for
adventurous travellers.  A canal conducted him as far as Cruces, after
which he had to push on through wild forest and swamp, under the escort
of the muleteers who took charge of the various travellers who had
arrived by the same packet.
It was a very novel and amusing journey, even in the very discomforts
and the strange characters with whom he was thrown, and more
discontented travellers used to declare that Don Luis, as he told the
muleteers to call him, always seemed to have the best success with the
surly hotel-keepers, though when he resigned his acquisitions to any
resolute grumbler, it used to be discovered that he had been putting up
with the worst share.
A place called Guallaval seemed to be the most squalid and forlorn of
all the stations--outside, an atmosphere of mosquitoes; inside, an
atmosphere of brandy and smoke, the master an ague-stricken Yankee, who
sat with his bare feet high against the wall, and only deigned to jerk
with his head to show in what quarter was the drink and food, and to
'guess that strangers must sleep on the ground, for first-comers had
all the beds'--hammocks slung up in a barn, or unwholesome cupboards in
the wall.
At the dirty board sat several of the party first arrived, washing down
tough, stringy beef with brandy.  Louis was about to take his place
near a very black-bearded young man, who appeared more civilized than
the rest, and who surprised him by at once making room for him, leaving
the table with an air of courtesy; and when, in his halting Spanish, he
begged 'his Grace' not to disturb himself, he was answered, in the same
tongue, 'I have finished.'
After the meal, such as it was, he wandered out of the hut, to escape
the fumes and the company within; but he was presently accosted by the
same stranger, who, touching his slouched Panama hat, made him a speech
in Spanish, too long and fluent for his comprehension, at the same time
offering him a cigar.  He was civilly refusing, when, to his surprise,
the man interrupted him in good English.  'These swamps breed fever, to
a certainty.  A cigar is the only protection; and even then there is
nothing more dangerous than to be out at sunset.'
'Thank you, I am much obliged,' said Louis, turning towards the hut.
'Have you been long out here?'
'The first time on the Isthmus; but I know these sort of places. Pray
go in, my Lord.'
The title and the accent startled Louis, and he exclaimed, 'You must be
from the Northwold country?'
He drew back, and said bluntly, 'Never mind me, only keep out of this
pestiferous air.'
But the abrupt surliness completed the recognition, and, seizing his
hand, Louis cried, 'Tom! how are you?'  You have turned into a thorough
Spaniard, and taken me in entirely.'
'Only come in, my Lord; I would never have spoken to you, but that I
could not see you catching your death.'
'I am coming: but what's the matter?  Why avoid me, when you are the
very man I most wished to see?'
'I'm done for,' said Tom.  'The fellows up there have saddled their
rogueries on me, and I'm off to the States.  I--'
'What do you say?  There, I am coming in.  Be satisfied, Tom; I am come
out with a commission from Mr. Dynevor, to see what can be arranged.'
'That's right,' cried Tom, 'now poor Miss Ponsonby will have one
friend.'
'Your letter to Charlotte brought me out--' began Louis; but Madison
broke in with an expression of dismay and self-reproach at seeing him
walking somewhat lame.
'It is only when I am tired, and not thinking of it,' said Louis; 'do
you know that old ash stick, Tom, my constant friend?  See, here are
the names of all the places I have seen cut out on it.'
'I knew it, and you, the moment you sat down by the table,' said Tom,
in a tone of the utmost feeling, as Louis took his arm.  'You are not
one to forget.'
'And yet you were going to pass me without making yourself known.'
'A disgraced man has no business to be known,' said Tom, low and
hoarsely.  'No, I wish none of them ever to hear my name again; and but
for the slip of the tongue that came so naturally, you should not, but
I was drawn to you, and could not help it.  I am glad I have seen you
once more, my Lord--'
He would have left him at the entrance, but Louis held him fast.
'You are the very man I depend on for unravelling the business.  A man
cannot be disgraced by any one but himself, and that is not the case
with you, Tom.'
'No, thank Heaven,' said Tom, fervently; 'I've kept my honesty, if I
have lost all the rest.'
Little more was needed to bring Madison to a seat on a wooden bench
beside Fitzjocelyn, answering his anxious inquiries.  The first tidings
were a shock--Mr. Ponsonby was dead.  He had long been declining, and
the last thing Tom had heard from Lima was, that he was dead; but of
the daughter there was no intelligence; Tom had been too much occupied
with his own affairs to know anything of her. Robson had returned from
Guayaquil some weeks previously, and in the settlement of accounts
consequent on Mr. Ponsonby's death, Tom had demurred giving up all the
valuable property at the mines under his charge, until he should have
direct orders from Mr. Dynevor or Miss Ponsonby.  A hot dispute ensued,
and Robson became aware that Tom was informed of his nefarious
practices, and had threatened him violently; but a few hours after he
had returned, affecting to have learnt from the new clerk, Ford, that
Madison's peculations required to be winked at with equal forbearance,
and giving him the alternative of sharing the spoil, or of being
denounced to the authorities.  He took a night to consider; and, as
Louis started at hearing of any deliberation, he said, sadly, 'You
would not believe me, my Lord, but I had almost a mind.  They would
take away my character, any way; and what advantage was my honesty
without that? And as to hurting my employers, they would only take what
I did not; and such as that is thought nothing of by very many.  I'd
got no faith in man nor woman left, and I'd got nothing but suspicion
by my honesty; so why should I not give in to the way of the world, and
try if it would serve me.  But then, my Lord, it struck me that if I
had nothing else, I had still my God left.'
Louis grasped his hand.
'Yes, I'm thankful that Miss Ponsonby asked me to read to the Cornish
miners,' said Madison.  'One gets soon heathenish in a heathenish
place; and but for that I don't believe I should ever have stood it
out.  But Joseph's words, 'How can I do this great wickedness, and sin
against God,' kept ringing in my ears like a peal of bells, all night,
and by morning I sent in a note to Mr. Robson, to say No to what he
proposed.'
Every other principle would have cracked in such a conflict, and Louis
looked up at Tom with intense admiration, while the young man spoke on,
not conscious that it had been noble, but ashamed of owning himself to
have been brought to a pass where mere integrity had been an effort.
He had gone back at once to his mines, in some hopes that the threats
might yet prove nothing but blustering; but he had scarcely arrived
there when an Indian muleteer, to whom he had shown some kindness,
brought him intelligence that la justida was in quest of him, but in
difficulties how to get up the mountains.  The poor Indians guided his
escape, conducting him down wonderful paths only known to themselves,
hiding him in strange sequestered huts, and finally guiding him safely
to Callao, where he had secretly embarked on board an American vessel
bound for Panama.  Louis asked why he had fled, instead of taking his
trial, and confuting Robson; but he smiled, and said, my Lord knew
little of foreign justice; besides, Ford was ready to bear any witness
that Robson might put into his mouth;--and his face grew dark.  Who was
this Ford?  He could not tell; Mr. Robson had picked him up a few
months back, when there was a want of a clerk; like loved like, he
supposed, but it was no concern of his. Would it be safe for him to
venture back to Peru, under Fitzjocelyn's protection, and assist him in
unmasking the treacherous Robson!  To this he readily agreed, catching
at the hope of establishing his innocence; but declaring that he should
then go at once to the States.--'What, not even go home to see
Charlotte?  I've got a letter for you, when I can get at it.'
Tom made no answer, and Fitzjocelyn feared that, in spite of all his
good qualities, his fidelity in love had not equalled his fidelity to
his employers.  He could not understand his protege during the few days
of their journey.  He was a great acquisition to his comfort, with his
knowledge of the language and people, and his affectionate deference.
At home, where all were courtly, he had been almost rude; but here, in
the land of ill manners, his attentions were so assiduous that Louis
was obliged to beg him to moderate them lest they should both be
ridiculous.  He had become a fine-looking young man, with a foreign air
and dress agreeing well with his dark complexion; and he had acquired
much practical ability and information.  Mountains, authority, and a
good selection of books had been excellent educators; he was a very
superior and intelligent person, and, without much polish, had laid
aside his peasant rusticities, and developed some of the best qualities
of a gentleman. But though open and warm-hearted on many points with
his early friend, there was a gloom and moodiness about him, which
Louis could only explain by thinking that his unmerited disgrace preyed
on him more than was quite manly.  To this cause, likewise, Louis at
first attributed his never choosing to hear a word about Charlotte; but
as the distaste--nay almost sullenness, evoked by any allusion to her,
became more apparent, Louis began unwillingly to balance his suspicions
between some fresh attachment, or unworthy shame at an engagement to a
maidservant.
The poor little damsel's sweet blushing face and shy courtesy, and all
her long and steady faithfulness, made him feel indignant at such a
suspicion, and he resolved to bring Madison to some explanation; but he
did not find the opportunity till after they had embarked at the
beautiful little islet of Toboga for Callao.  On board, he had time to
find in his portmanteau the letter with which she had entrusted him,
and, seeking Madison on deck, gave it to him.  He held it in his hand
without opening it; but the sparkle in his dark eye did not betoken the
bashfulness of fondness, and Louis, taking a turn along the deck to
watch him unperceived, saw him raise his hand as if to throw the poor
letter overboard at once.  A few long steps, and Louis was beside him,
exclaiming, 'What now, Tom--is that the way you treat your letters?'
'The little hypocrite!  I don't want no more of her false words,'
muttered Tom, returning, in his emotion, to his peasant's emphatic
double negative.
'Hypocrite!  Do you know how nobly and generously she has been helping
Mr. and Mrs. Frost through their straits? how faithfully--'
'I know better,' said Tom, hoarsely; 'don't excuse her, my Lord; you
know little of what passes in your own kitchens.'
'Too true, I fear, in many cases,' said Louis; 'but I have seen this
poor child in circumstances that make me feel sure that she is an
admirable creature.  What misunderstanding can have arisen?'
'No misunderstanding, my Lord.  I saw, as plain as I see you, her name
and her writing in the book that she gave to Ford--her copying out of
his love-poems, my Lord, in the blank pages,--if I had wanted any proof
of what he alleged.'
And he had nearly thrown the letter into the Pacific; but Louis caught
his arm.
'Did you ever read Cymbeline, Tom?'
'Yes, to be sure I have,' growled Tom, in surprise.
'Then remember Iachimo, and spare that letter.  What did he tell you?'
With some difficulty Fitzjocelyn drew from Madison that he had for some
time been surprised at Ford's knowledge of Northwold and the
neighbourhood; but had indulged in no suspicions till about the epoch
of Robson's return from Guayaquil.  Chancing to be waiting in his
fellow-clerk's room, he had looked at his books, and, always attracted
by poetry as the rough fellow was, had lighted on a crimson
watered-silk volume, in the first page of which he had, to his horror,
found the name of Charlotte Arnold borne aloft by the two doves, and in
the blank leaves several extremely flowery poems in her own handwriting.
With ill-suppressed rage he had demanded an explanation, and had been
met with provokingly indifferent inuendoes.  The book was the gift of a
young lady with whom Ford had the pleasure to be acquainted; the little
effusions were trifles of his own, inscribed by her own fair hands.
Oh, yes! he knew Miss Arnold very well--very pretty, very complaisant!
Ah! he was afraid there were some broken hearts at home!  Poor little
thing! he should never forget how she took leave of him, after forcing
upon him her little savings!  He was sorry for her, too; but a man
cannot have compassion on all the pretty girls he sees.
'And you could be deceived by such shallow coxcombry as this!' said
Louis.
'I tell you there was the book,' returned Tom.
'Well, Tom, if Mr. Ford prove to be the Ford I take him to be, I'll
undertake that you shall see through him, and be heartily ashamed of
yourself.  Give me back the letter,--you do not deserve to have it.'
'I don't want it,' said Tom, moodily; 'she has not been as true to me
as I've been to her, and if she isn't what I took her for, I do not
care to hear of her again.  I used to look at the mountain-tops, and
think she was as pure as they; and that she should have been making
herself the talk of a fellow like that, and writing so sweet to me all
the time!--No, my Lord, there's no excusing it; and 'twas her being
gone after the rest that made it so bitter hard to me!  If she had been
true, I would have gone through fire and water to be an honest man
worthy of her; but when I found how she had deceived me, it went hard
with me to cut myself off from the wild mountain life that I'd got to
love, and my poor niggers, that will hardly have so kind a master set
over them.'
'You have stood the fiery ordeal well,' said Louis; 'and I verily
believe that you will soon find that it was only an ordeal.'
The care of Tom was a wholesome distraction to the suspense that became
almost agony as Louis approached Peru, and beheld the gigantic summits
of the more northern Andes, which sunset revealed shining out white and
fitfully, like the Pilgrim's vision of the Celestial City, although,
owing to their extreme distance, even on a bright noonday, nothing was
visible but clear deep-blue sky.  They seemed to make him realize that
the decisive moment was near, when he should tread the same soil with
Mary, and yet, as he stood silently watching those glorious heights,
human hopes and cares seemed to shrink into nothing before the eternity
and Infinite Greatness of which the depth and the height spoke.  Yet He
remembereth the hairs of our heads, Who weigheth the mountains in the
balance, and counteth the isles as a very little thing.  Louis took
comfort, but nerved himself for resignation; his prayer was more, that
he might bear rightly whatever might be in store, than that he should
succeed.  He could hardly have made the latter petition with that
submissiveness and reserve befitting all entreaty for blessings of this
passing world.
CHAPTER XXII.
RATHER SUDDEN.
O! would you hear of a Spanish lady,
How she woo'd an Englishman?
Garments gay, as rich as may be,
Decked with jewels she had on.
Old Ballad.
The white buildings of Callao looked out of the palm gardens, and, with
throbbing heart, Fitzjocelyn was set on shore, leaving Madison on board
until he should hear from him that evening or the next morning.
Hiring a calesa, he drove at once to Lima, to the house of the late Mr.
Ponsonby.  The heavy folding gates admitted him to the archway, where
various negroes were loitering; and as he inquired for the ladies, one
of them raised a curtain, and admitted him into the large cool twilight
hall, so dark that, with eyes dazzled by the full glare of day, he
could hardly discern at the opposite end of the hall, where a little
more light was admitted from one of the teatina windows, two figures
seated at a table covered with ledgers and papers.  As if dreaming, he
followed his barefooted guide across the soft India matting, and heard
his Spanish announcement, that, might it please her Grace, here was a
Senor from England.
Both rose; the one a well-dressed man, the other--it was the well-known
action--'Mary!' it was all that he had the power to say; he was hardly
visible, but what tone was ever like that low, distinct, earnest voice?
Mary clasped her hands together as if in bewilderment.
'Xavier should not--I will speak,' whispered her companion to her, and
beginning, 'Address yourself to me, sir!'
But Mary sprang forward, signing him back with her hand.  'It is my
cousin, Lord Fitzjocelyn!' she said, as if breath and effort would
serve no more, and she laid her hand in that of Louis.
'Mr. Ward?' said Louis, barely able to frame the question, yet striving
for a manner that might leave no thorns behind.
'No; oh, no!  Mr. Robson.'
The very sound of the 'No' made his heart bound up again, and his hand
closed fast on that which lay within it, while a bow passed between him
and Robson.
'And you are come?' as if it were too incredible.
'I told you I should,' he answered.
'I will leave you, Miss Ponsonby,' said Robson; 'we will continue our
little business when you are less agreeably engaged.'
He began to gather the papers together, an action which suddenly
recalled Louis to the recollection of Tom's cautions as to prudence and
alertness, and he forced himself to a prompt tone of business.
'I hope to be able to be of use,' he said, turning to Mary.  'Mr.
Dynevor has given me a commission to look into his affairs,' and he put
into Robson's hands the letter written by James, and signed by Oliver.
'Thank you, Lord Fitzjocelyn, I shall be very happy to give any
explanations you may wish,' said Robson, measuring with his eye his
youthful figure and features, and piling up the books.
'I should prefer having these left with me,' said Louis; 'I have but
little time before me, and if I could look them over to-night, I should
be prepared for you to-morrow.'
'Allow me.  You would find it impossible to understand these entries.
There is much to be set in order before they would be ready for the
honour of your lordship's inspection.'
'I particularly wish to have them at once.  You give me authority to
act for you, Miss Ponsonby?' he added, looking at her, as she stood
holding by the table, as one half awake.
'Oh! yes, I put the whole into your hands,' she answered, mechanically,
obeying his eye.
'Allow me, my Lord,' said Robson, as Fitzjocelyn laid the firm hand of
detention on the heavy ledgers, and great leathern pocket-book.
'Yes; we had better know exactly what you leave in my charge, Mr.
Robson,' said Louis, beginning to suspect that the clerk fancied that
the weight and number of the books and bundles of bills might satisfy
his unpractised eye, and that the essential was to be found in the
pocket-book, on which he therefore retained a special hold; asking, as
Robson held out his hand for it, 'is this private property?'
'Why, yes; no, it is and it is not,' said Robson, looking at the lady,
as though to judge whether she were attending.  'I only brought it here
that Miss Ponsonby might have before her--always a satisfaction to a
lady, you know, sir--though Miss Ponsonby's superior talents for
business quite enable her to comprehend.  But our affairs are not what
I could wish.  The Equatorial bubble was most unfortunate, and that
unfortunate young man, who has absconded after a long course of
embezzlement, has carried off much valuable property.  I was laying the
case before Miss Ponsonby, and showing her what amount had been
fortunately secured.'
'What is in the pocket-book?' asked Louis of Mary; and, though she was
apparently conscious of nothing around her, he obtained a direct reply.
'The vouchers for the shares.'
'In the Equatorial.  Unlucky speculation--so much waste paper,'
interrupted Robson.  'Your lordship had better let me clear away the
trash, which will only complicate the matter, and distract your
understanding.'
'Thank you; as you say there has been fraud, I should be better
satisfied to be able to tell Mr. Dynevor that the papers have never
been out of my hands.  I will call on you early to-morrow.'
Mr. Robson waited to make many inquiries for Mr. Dynevor's health, and
to offer every attention to Lord Fitzjocelyn, to introduce him to the
Consul, to find apartments for him, &c.; but at last he took leave, and
Louis was free to turn to the motionless Mary, who had done nothing all
this time but follow him with her eyes.
All his doubts had returned, and, in the crisis of his fate, he stood
irresolute, daring neither to speak nor ask, lest feelings should be
betrayed which might poison her happiness.
'Is it you?' were her first words, as though slowly awakening.
'It is I, come to be whatever you will let me be,' he answered, as best
he could.
'Oh, Louis!' she said, 'this is too much!'  And she hid her face in her
hands.
'Tell me--one word, Mary, and I shall know what to do, and will not
harass nor grieve you.'
'Grieve me!  You!' exclaimed Mary, in an inexpressibly incredulous tone.
'Enough!  It is as it was before!' and he drew her into his arms, as
unresistingly as five years ago, and his voice sank with intense
thankfulness, as he said, 'My Mary--my Mary! has He not brought it to
pass?'
The tears came dropping from her eyes, and then she could speak.
'Louis, my dear father withdrew his anger.  He gave full consent and
blessing, if you still--'
'Then nothing is wanting--all is peace!' said Louis.  'You know how you
are longed for at home--'
'That you should have come--come all this way!  That Lord Ormersfield
should have spared you!' exclaimed Mary, breaking out into happy little
sentences, as her tears relieved her.  'Oh, how far off all my distress
and perplexity seem now!  How foolish to have been so unhappy when
there you were close by!  But you must see Dona Rosita,' cried she,
recollecting herself, after an interval, 'I must tell her.'
Mary hurried into another room by a glass door, and Louis heard her
speaking Spanish, and a languid reply; then returning, she beckoned to
him to advance, whispering, 'Don't be surprised, these are the usual
habits.  We can talk before her, she never follows English.'
He could at first see no one, but presently was aware of a grass
hammock swung from the richly-carved beams, and in it something white;
then of a large pair of black eyes gazing full at him with a liquid
soft stare.  He made his bow, and summoned his best Spanish, and she
made an answer which he understood, by the help of Mary, to be a
welcome; then she smiled and signed with her head towards him and Mary,
and said what Mary only interpreted by colouring, as did Louis, for
such looks and smiles were of all languages.  Then it was explained
that only as a relation did she admit his Excellency el Visconde,
before her evening toilette in her duelos was made--Mary would take
care of him.  And dismissing them with a graceful bend of her head, she
returned to her doze and her cigarito.
Mary conducted Louis to the cool, shaded, arched doorway, opening under
the rich marble cloister of the court-yard, where a fountain made a
delicious bubbling in the centre.  She clapped her hands--a little
negro girl appeared, to whom she gave an order, and presently two more
negroes came in, bringing magnificent oranges and pomegranates, and
iced wine and water, on a silver tray, covered with a
richly-embroidered napkin.  He would have felt himself in the Alhambra,
if he could have felt anything but that he was beside Mary.
'Sit down, sit down, you have proved yourself Mary enough already by
waiting on me.  I want to look at you, and to hear you.  You are not
altered!' he cried joyfully, as he drew her into the full light. 'You
have your own eyes, and that's your very smile! only grown handsomer.
That's all!'
She really was.  She was a woman to be handsomer at twenty-seven than
at twenty-one; and with the glow of unexpected bliss over her fine
countenance, it did not need a lover's eye to behold her as something
better than beautiful.
And for her! who shall tell the marvel of scarcely-credited joy, every
time she heard the music of his softly-dropped distinct words, and
looked up at the beloved face, perhaps a little less fair, with rather
less of the boyish delicacy of feature, but more noble, more
defined--as soft and sweet as ever, but with all the indecision gone;
all that expression that had at times seemed like weakness.  He was not
the mere lad she had loved with a guiding motherly love, but a man to
respect and rely on--ready, collected, dealing with easy coolness with
the person who had domineered over that house for years.  He was all,
and more than all, her fondest fancy had framed; and coming to her aid
at the moment of her utmost difficulty, brought to her by the love
which she had not dared to confide in nor encourage!  No wonder that
she feared to move, lest she should find herself awakened from a dream
too happy to last.
'But oh, Louis,' said she, as if it were almost a pledge of reality to
recollect a vexation, 'I must tell you first, for it will grieve you,
and we did not take pains enough to keep him out of temptation. That
unhappy runaway clerk--'
'Is safe at Callao,' said Louis, 'and is to help me to release you from
the meshes they have woven round you.  Save for the warning he sent
home, I could never have shown cause for coming to you, Mary, while you
would not summon me.  That was too bad, you know, since you had the
consent.'
'That was only just at last,' faltered Mary.  'It was so kind of him,
for I had disappointed him so much!'
'What?  I know, Mary; his letters kept me in a perpetual fright for the
last year; and not one did you write to poor little Clara to comfort
us.'
'It was not right in me,' said Mary; 'but I thought it might be so much
better for you if you were never put in mind of me.  I beg your pardon,
Louis.'
'We should have trusted each other better, if people would have let us
alone,' said Louis.  'In fact, it was trust after all.  It always came
back again, if it were scared away for a moment.'
'Till I began to doubt if I were doing what was kind by you,' said
Mary.  'Oh, that was the most distressing time of all; I thought if I
were out of the way, you might begin to be happy, and I tried to leave
off thinking about you.'
'Am I to thank you?'
'I could not,--that is the truth of it,' said Mary.  'I was able to
keep you out of my mind enough, I hope, for it not to be wrong; but as
to putting any one else there--I was forced at last to tell poor papa
so, when he wanted to send for Mr. Ward; and then--he said that if you
had been as constant, he supposed it must be, and he hoped we should be
happy; and he said you had been a pet of my mother, and that Lord
Ormersfield had been a real friend to her.  It was so kind of him, for
I know it would have been the greatest relief to his mind to leave
things in Mr. Ward's charge.'
Mary had been so much obliged to be continually mentioning her father,
that, though the loss was still very recent, she was habituated to
speak of him with firmness; and it was an extreme satisfaction to tell
all her sorrows, and all the little softening incidents, to Louis.  Mr.
Ponsonby had shown much affection and gratitude to her during the few
closing days of his illness, and had manifested some tokens of
repentance for his past life; but there had been so much pain and
torpor, that there had been little space for reflection, and the long
previous decline had not been accepted as a warning.  Perhaps the
intensity of Mary's prayers had been returned into her bosom, in the
strong blindness of filial love; for as she dwelt fondly on the few
signs of better things, the narration fell mournfully on Louis's ears,
as that of an unhopeful deathbed.
An exceeding unwillingness to contemplate death, had prevented Mr.
Ponsonby from making a new will.  By one made many years back, he had
left the whole of his property, without exception, to his daughter, his
first wife having been provided for by her marriage settlements, and
now, with characteristic indolence and selfishness, he had deferred
till too late the securing any provision for his Limenian wife; and
only when he found himself dying, had he said to Mary, 'You will take
care to provide for poor Rosita!'
So Mary had found herself heiress to a share in the miserably-involved
affairs of Dynevor and Ponsonby; and as soon as she could think of the
future at all, had formed the design of settling Rosita in a convent
with a pension, and going herself to England.
But Rosita was not easily to be induced to give up her gaieties for a
convent life; and, moreover, there was absolutely such a want of ready
money, that Mary did not see how to get home, though Robson assured her
there was quite enough to live upon as they were at present.  Nor was
it possible to dispose of the mines and other property without Mr.
Dynevor's consent, and he might not be in a state to give it.
The next stroke was young Madison's sudden disappearance, and the
declaration by Robson that he had carried off a great deal of
property--a disappointment to her even greater than the loss.  Robson
was profuse in compliments and attentions, but continually deferred the
statement of affairs that he had promised; and Mary could not bear to
accept the help of Mr. Ward, the only person at hand able and willing
to assist her.  She had at last grown desperate, and, resolved to have
something positive to write to Mr. Dynevor, as well as not to go on
living without knowing her means, she had insisted on Robson bringing
his accounts.  She knew just enough to be dissatisfied with his vague
statements; and the more he praised her sagacity, the more she saw that
he was taking advantage of her ignorance, which he presumed to be far
greater than it really was. At the very moment when she was most
persuaded of his treachery, and felt the most lonely and desolate--when
he was talking fluently, and she was seeking to rally her spirits, and
discover the path of right judgment, where the welfare of so many was
concerned--it was then that Fitzjocelyn's voice was in her ear.
She had scarcely explained to Louis why his coming was, if possible,
doubly and trebly welcome, when the negro admitted another guest, whom
Rosita received much as she had done his predecessor, only with less
curiosity.  Mary rose, blushing deeply, and crossing the room held out
her hand, and said simply, but with something of apology, 'Mr. Ward,
this is Lord Fitzjocelyn.'
Mr. Ward raised his eyes to her face for one moment.  'I understand,'
he said, in a low, not quite steady voice.  'It is well.  Will you
present me?' he added, as though collecting himself like a brave man
after a blow.
'Here is my kindest friend,' she said, as she conducted him to Louis,
and they shook hands in the very manner she wished to see, learning
mutual esteem from her tone and each other's aspect.
'I am sorry to have intruded,' said Mr. Ward.  'I came in the hope that
you might find some means of making me of use to you; and, perhaps, I
may yet be of some assistance to Lord Fitzjocelyn.'
He enforced the proposal with so much cordiality, and showed so plainly
that it would be his chief pleasure and consolation to do anything for
Miss Ponsonby, that they did not scruple to take him into their
counsels; and Mary looked on with exulting wonder at the ability and
readiness displayed by Louis in the discussion of business details,
even with a man whose profession they were.  In remote space, almost
beyond memory, save to enhance the present joy of full reliance, was
the old uncomfortable sense of his leaning too much upon her.  To have
him acting and thinking for her, and with one touch carrying off her
whole burthen of care, was comfort and gladness beyond what she had
even devised in imagination.  The only drawback, besides compassion for
Mr. Ward, was the shock of hearing of the extent of the treachery of
Robson, in whom her father had trusted so implicitly, and to whom he
had shown so much favour.
They agreed that they would go to the Consul, and concert measures;
Mary only begging that Robson might not be hardly dealt with, and they
went away, leaving her to her overwhelming happiness, which began to
become incredible as soon as Louis was out of sight.
By-and-by, he came back to the evening meal, when Rosita appeared, with
her uncovered hair in two long, unadorned tresses, plaited, and hanging
down on each shoulder, and arrayed in black robes, which, by their
weight and coarseness, recalled Eastern fashions of mourning, which
Spain derived from the Moors.  She attempted a little Spanish talk with
El Visconde, much to his inconvenience, though he was too joyous not to
be doubly good-natured, especially as he pitied her, and regarded her
as a very perplexing charge newly laid on him.
He had time to tell Mary that he was to sleep at the Consul's, whence
he had sent a note and a messenger to fetch Tom Madison, since it
appeared that the prosecution, the rumour of which had frightened the
poor fellow away, had not been actually set on foot before he decamped;
and even if it had been, there were many under worse imputations at
large in the Peruvian Republic.
Fitzjocelyn had appointed that Robson should call on him early in the
morning, and, if he failed to detect him, intended to confront him with
Madison before the Consul, when there could be little doubt that his
guilt would be brought home to him.  He found that the Consul and Mr.
Ward had both conceived a bad opinion of Robson, and had wondered at
the amount of confidence reposed in him; whereas Madison had been
remarked as a young man of more than average intelligence and
steadiness, entirely free from that vice of gambling which was the bane
of all classes in Spanish South America.  Mary sighed as she heard
Louis speak so innocently of 'all classes'--it was too true, as he
would find to his cost, when he came to look into their affairs, and
learn what Rosita had squandered.  Next, he asked about the other
clerk, Ford, of whom Mary knew very little, except that she had heard
Robson mention to her father, when preparing to set out for Guayaquil,
that in the consequent press of business he had engaged a new
assistant, who had come from Rio as servant to a traveller.  She had
sometimes heard Robson speak in praise of his acquisition, and exalt
him above Madison; and once or twice she had seen him, and fancied him
like some one whom she had known somewhere, but she had for many months
seldom left her father's room, and knew little of what passed beyond it.
Louis took his leave early, as he had to examine his prize, the
pocket-book, and make up his case before confronting Robson; and he
told Mary that he should refrain from seeing her on the morrow until
the 'tug of war should be over.'  'Mr. Ward promises to come to help
me,' he added.  'Really, Mary, I never saw a more generous or
considerate person.  I am constantly on the point of begging his
pardon.'
'I must thank him some way or other,' said Mary; 'his forbearance has
been beautiful.  I only wish he would have believed me, for I always
told him the plain truth.  It would have spared him something; but
nobody would trust my account of you.'
The morning came, and with it Madison; but patient as Fitzjocelyn
usually was, he was extremely annoyed at finding his precious time
wasted by Robson's delay in keeping his appointment.  After allowing
for differing clocks, for tropical habits, and every other imaginable
excuse for unpunctuality, he decided that there must have been some
mistake, and set off to call at the counting-house.
A black porter opened the door, and he stepped forward into the inner
room, where, leaning lazily back before a desk, smoking a cigar over
his newspaper, arrayed in a loose white jacket, with open throat and
slippered feet, reposed a gentleman, much transformed from the spruce
butler, but not difficult of recognition.  He started to his feet with
equal alacrity and consternation, and bowed, not committing himself
until he should see whether he were actually known to his lordship.
Fitzjocelyn was in too great haste to pause on this matter, and quickly
acknowledging the salutation, as if that of a stranger, demanded where
Mr. Robson was.
In genuine surprise and alarm, Ford exclaimed that he had not seen him;
he thought he was gone to meet his lordship at the Consular residence.
No! could he be at his own house?  It was close by, and the question
was asked, but the Senor Robson had gone out in the very early morning.
Ford looked paler and paler, and while Louis said he would go and
inquire for him at Miss Ponsonby's, offered to go down to the Consul's
to see if he had arrived there in the meantime.
Mary came to meet Louis in the sala, saying that she was afraid that
they had not shown sufficient consideration for poor Dona Rosita, who
really had feeling; she had gone early to her convent, and had not yet
returned, though she had been absent two hours.
Louis had but just explained his perplexity and vexation, when the old
negro Xavier came in with looks of alarm, begging to know whether La
Senora were come in, and excusing himself for having lost sight of her.
She had not gone to the convent, but to the cathedral; and he, kneeling
in the crowded nave while she passed on to one of the side chapels, had
not seen her again, and, after waiting far beyond the usual duration of
her devotions, had supposed that she had gone home unattended.
As he finished his story, there was a summons to Lord Fitzjocelyn to
speak to Mr. Ford, and on Mary's desiring that he should be admitted,
he came forward, exclaiming, 'My Lord, he has not been at the Consul's!
I beg to state that he has the keys of all the valuables at the office;
nothing is in my charge.'
Louis turned to consult Mary; but, as if a horrible idea had come over
her, she was already speeding through the door of the quadra, and
appearing there again in a few seconds, she beckoned him, with a
countenance of intense dismay, and whispered under her breath, 'Louis!
Louis! her jewels are gone!  Poor thing! poor thing! what will become
of her?'
Mary had more reasons for her frightful suspicion than she would detain
him to hear.  Robson, always polite, had been especially so to the
young Limenian; she had been much left to his society, and Mary had
more than once fancied that they were more at ease in her own absence.
She was certain that the saya y manto had been frequently employed to
enable Rosita to enjoy dissipation, when her husband's condition would
have rendered her public appearance impossible; and at the Opera or on
the Alameda, Robson might have had every opportunity of paying her
attention, and forwarding her amusements. There could be no doubt that
she had understood more of their plans than had been supposed, had
warned him, and shared his flight.
Pursuit, capture, and a nunnery would be far greater kindness to the
poor childish being, than leaving her to the mercy of a runaway
swindler; and all measures were promptly taken, Ford throwing himself
into the chase with greater ardour and indignation than even Madison;
for he had trusted to Robson's grand professions that he could easily
throw dust into the young Lord's inexperienced eyes, come off with
flying colours, and protect his subordinate.  If he had changed his
mind since the Senora's warning, he had not thought it necessary to
inform his confederate; and Ford was not only furious at the desertion,
but anxious to make a merit of his zeal, and encouraged by having as
yet seen no sign that he was recognised.
Regardless of heat and fatigue, Fitzjocelyn, Mr. Ward, and the two
clerks, were indefatigable throughout the day, but it was not till near
sunset that a Spanish agent of Mr. Ward's brought back evidence that a
Limenian lady and English gentleman had been hastily married by a
village padre in the early morning, and Madison shortly after came from
Callao, having traced such a pair to an American vessel, which was long
since out of harbour.  It was well that the pocket-book had been saved,
for it contained securities to a large amount, which Robson, after
showing to Mary to satisfy her, doubtless intended to keep in hand for
such a start as the present.  Without it, he had contrived, as Madison
knew, to secure quite sufficient to remove any anxieties as to the
Senora Rosita owning a fair share of her late husband's property.
The day of terrible anxiety made it a relief to Mary to have any
certainty, though she was infinitely shocked at the tidings, which
Louis conveyed to her at once.  Mrs. Willis, whom Mr. Ward had sent to
be her companion, went to her brother in the outer room, and left the
lovers alone in the quadra, where Mary could freely express her grief
and disappointment, her sorrow for the insult to her father, and her
apprehensions for the poor fugitive herself, whom she loved enough to
lament for exceedingly, and to recall every excuse that could be found
in a wretched education, a miserable state of society, a childish mind,
and religion presented to her in a form that did nothing to make it
less childish.
Mary's first recovery from the blow was shown by her remembering how
fatigued and heated Louis must be, and when she had given orders for
refreshment for him, and had thus resumed something of her ordinary
frame, he sat looking at her anxiously, and presently said, 'And what
will you do next, Mary!'
'I cannot tell.  Mrs. Willis and Mrs. ---- have both been asking me
very kindly to come to them, but I cannot let Mrs. Willis stay with me
away from her children.  Yet it seems hard on Mr. Ward that you should
be coming to me there.  I suppose I must go to Mrs. ----; but I waited
to consult you.  I had rather be at home, if it were right.'
'It may easily be made right,' quietly said Louis.
'How!' asked Mary.
'I find,' he continued, 'that the whole affair may be easily settled,
if you will give me authority.'
'I thought I had given you authority to act in my name.'
'It might be simplified.'
'Shall I sign my name!'
'Yes--once--to make mine yours.  If your claims are mine, I can take
much better care of the Dynevor interest.'
Mary rested her cheek on her hand, and looked at him with her grave
steady face, not very much discomposed after the first glimpse of his
meaning.
'Will you, Mary?'
'You know I will,' she said.
'Then there is no time to be lost.  Let it be to-morrow.  Yes'--going
on in the quiet deliberate tone that made it so difficult to interrupt
him--'then I could, in my own person, negotiate for the sale of the
mines.  I find there is an offer that Robson kept secret. I could wind
up the accounts, see what can be saved for the Northwold people, and
take you safe home by the end of a fortnight.'
'Oh, Louis!' cried Mary, almost sobbing, 'this will not do.  I cannot
entangle you in our ruinous affairs.'
'Insufficient objections are consent,' said Louis, smiling.  'Do you
trust me, Mary?'
'It is of no use to ask.'
'You think I am not to be trusted with affairs that have become my own!
I believe I am, Mary.  You know I must do my utmost for the Dynevors;
and I assure you I see my way.  I have no reasonable doubt of clearing
off all future liabilities.  You mean to let me arrange?'
'Yes, but--'
'Then why not obviate all awkward situations at once?'
'My father!  You should not ask it, Louis.'
'I would not hasten you, but for the sake of my own father, Mary.  He
is growing old, and I could not have left him for anything but the hope
of bringing him his own chosen daughter.  I want you to help me take
care of him, and we must not leave him alone to the long evenings and
cold winds.'
Mary was yielding--'I must not keep you from him,' she said, 'but
to-morrow--a Sunday, too--'
'Ah!  Mary, do you want gaiety!  No, if we cannot have it in a holy
place, let it at least have the consecration of the day--let us have
fifty-two wedding days a year instead of one.  Indeed, I would not
press you, but that I could take care of you so much better, and it is
not as if our acquaintance had not begun--how long ago--twenty-seven
years, I think?'
'Settle it as you like,' she managed to say, with a great flood of
tears-but what soft bright tears!  'I trust you.'
He saw she wanted solitude; he only stayed for a few words of earnest
thanks, and the assurance that secrecy and quietness would be best
assured by speed.  'I will come back,' he said, 'when I have seen to
the arrangement.  And there is one thing I must do first, one poor
fellow who must not be left in suspense any longer.'
Tired as he ought to have been, he lightly crossed the sala to the room
appropriated to business, where he had desired the two clerks to wait
for him, and where Tom Madison stood against the wall, with folded
arms, while Ford lounged in a disengaged attitude on a chair, but rose
alert and respectful at his appearance.
Louis asked one or two necessary questions on the custody of the office
for the night and ensuing day, and Ford made repeated assurances that
nothing would be found missing that had been left in his charge.  'I
believe you, Mr. Delaford,' said Fitzjocelyn, quietly.  'I do not think
the lower species of fraud was ever in your style.'
Delaford tried to open his lips, but visibly shook.  Louis answered,
what he had not yet said, 'I do not intend to expose you.  I think you
had what excuse neglect can give, and unless I should be called on
conscientiously to speak to your character, I shall leave you to make a
new one.'
Delaford began to stammer out thanks, and promises of explaining the
whole of Robson's peculations (little he knew the whole of them).
'There is one earnest of your return to sincerity that I require,' said
Louis.  'Explain at once the degree of your acquaintance with Charlotte
Arnold.'
Tom Madison still stood moody--affecting not to hear.
'Oh! my Lord, I did not know that you were interested in that young
person.'
'I am interested where innocence has been maligned,' said Louis,
sternly.
'I am sure, my Lord, nothing has ever passed at which the most
particular need take umbrage,' exclaimed Delaford.  'If Mr. Madison
will recollect, I mentioned nothing as the most fastidious need--'
Mr. Madison would not hear.
'You only inferred that she had not been insensible to your
attractions?'
'Why, indeed, my Lord, I flatter myself that in my time I have had the
happiness of not being unpleasing to the sex,' said Delaford, with a
sigh and a simper.
'It is a mortifying question, but you owe it to the young woman to
answer, whether she gave you any encouragement.'
'No, my Lord.  I must confess that she always spoke of a previous
attachment, and dashed my earlier hopes to the ground.'
'And the book of poems!  How came that to be in your possession?
Delaford confessed that it had been a little tribute, returned upon his
hands by the young lady in question.
'One question more, Mr. Delaford: what was the fact as to her lending
you means for your voyage?'
Delaford was not easily brought to confession on this head; but he did
at length own that he had gone in great distress to Charlotte, and had
appealed to her bounty; but he distinctly acknowledged that it was not
in the capacity of suitor; in fact, as he ended by declaring, he had
the pleasure of saying that there was no young person whom he esteemed
more highly than Miss Arnold, and that she had never given him the
least encouragement, such as need distress the happy man who had
secured her affections.
The happy man did not move till Delaford had left the room, when Louis
walked up to him and said, 'I can further tell you, of my own
knowledge, that that good girl refused large wages, and a lady's-maid's
place, partly because she would not live in the same house with that
man; and she has worked on with a faithful affection and constancy,
beyond all praise, as the single servant to Mr. and Mrs. Frost in their
distress.'
'Don't talk to me, my Lord,' cried Tom, turning away; 'I'm the most
unhappy man in the world!'
'I did not ask you to shake hands with Delaford to-night.  You will
another day.  He is only a vain coxcomb, and treated you to a little of
his conceit, with, perhaps, a taste of spite at a successful rival; but
he has only shown you what a possession you have in her.'
'You don't know what I've done, my Lord.  I have written her a letter
that she can never forgive!'
'You don't know what I've done, Tom.  I posted a letter by the mail
just starting from Callao--a letter to Mr. Frost, with a hint to
Charlotte that you were labouring under a little delusion; I knew, from
your first narration, that Ford could be no other than my old friend,
shorn of his beams.'
'That letter--' still muttered Tom.
'She'll forgive, and like you all the better for having afforded her a
catastrophe, Tom.  You may write by the next mail; unless, what is
better still, you come home with us by the same, and speak for
yourself.  If I am your master then, I'll give you the holiday.  Yes,
Tom, it was important to me to clear up your countenance, for I want to
bespeak your services to-morrow as my friend.'
'My Lord!' cried Tom, aghast.  'If you do require any such service,
though I should not have thought it, there are many nearer your own
rank, officers and gentlemen fitter for an affair of the kind.  I never
knew anything about fire-arms, since I gave up poaching.'
'Indeed, Tom, I am very far from intending to dispense with your
services.  I want you to guide me to procure the required weapon!'
'Surely,' said Tom, with a deep, reluctant sigh, 'you never crossed the
Isthmus without one?'
'Yes, indeed, I did; I never saw the party there whom I should have
liked to challenge in this way.  Why, Tom, did you really think I had
come out to Peru to fight a duel on a Sunday morning?'
'That's what comes of living in this sort of place.  Duels are meat and
drink to the people here,' said Tom, ashamed and relieved, 'and there
have been those who told me it was all that was wanting to make me a
gentleman.  But in what capacity am I to serve you, my Lord!'
'In the first place, tell me where I may procure a wedding-ring! Yes,
Tom, that's the weapon!   You've no objection to being my friend in
that capacity!'
Tom's astonished delight went beyond the bounds of expression, and
therefore was compressed into an almost grim 'Whatever you will, my
Lord;' but two hot tears were gushing from his eyes.  He dashed them
away, and added, 'What a fool I am!  You'll believe me, my Lord, though
I can't speak, that, though there may be many nearer and more your
equals, there's none on earth more glad and happy to see you so, than
myself.'
'I believe it, indeed, Tom; shake hands, to wish me joy; I am right
glad to have one here from Ormersfield, to make it more home-like. For,
though it is a hurry at last, you can guess what she has been to me
from the first.  Knowing her thoroughly has been one of the many, many
benefits that Ferny dell conferred on me.'
There was no time for more than to enjoin silence.  Louis had to hurry
to the Consul and the Chaplain, and to overcome their astonishment.
On the other hand, Mary was, as usual, seeking and recovering the
balance of her startled spirits in her own chamber.  She saw the matter
wisely and simply, and had full confidence in Louis, with such a
yearning for his protection that, it may be, the strange suddenness of
the proposal cost her the less.  She came forth and announced her
intention to Mrs. Willis, who was inclined to resent it as derogatory
to the dignity of womanhood, and the privileges of a bride; but Mary
smiled and answered that, 'when he had taken so much trouble for her,
she could not give him any more by things of that sort.  She must be as
little in his way as possible.'
And Mrs. Willis sighed, and pitied her, but was glad that she should be
off her poor brother's mind as soon as might be, and was glad to resign
her task of chaperoning her.
Only three persons beyond the Consul's family knew what was about to
happen, when Miss Ponsonby, in her deep mourning, attended the morning
service in the large hall at the Consul-house; and such eyes as were
directed towards the handsome stranger, only gazed at the unwonted
spectacle of an English nobleman, not with the more eager curiosity
that would have been attached to him had all been known.
Mr. Ward lingered a few moments, and begged for one word with Miss
Ponsonby. She could not but comply, and came to meet him, blushing, but
composed, in that simple, frank kindness which only wished to soften
the disappointment.
'Mary,' he said, 'I am not come to harass you.  I have done so long
enough, and I would not have tormented you, but on that one head I did
not do justice to your judgment.  I see now how vain my hope was. I am
glad to have met him--I am glad to know how worthy of you he is, and to
have seen you in such hands.'
'You are very kind to speak so,' said Mary.
'Yes, Mary, I could not have borne to part with you, if I were not
convinced that he is a good man as well as an able man.  I might have
known that you would not choose otherwise.  I shall see your name among
the great ladies of the land.  I came to say something else.  I wished
to thank you for the many happy hours I have spent with you, though you
never for a moment trifled with me.  It was I who deceived myself.
Good-bye, Mary.  Perhaps you will write to my sister, and let her know
of your arrival.'
'I will write to you, if you please,' said Mary.
'It will be a great pleasure,' he said, earnestly.  'And will you let
me be of any use in my power to you and Lord Fitzjocelyn?'
'Indeed, we shall be most grateful.   You have been a most kind and
forbearing friend.  I should like to know that you were happy,' said
Mary, lingering, and hardly knowing what to say.
'My little nieces are fond enough of their uncle.  My sister wants me.
In short, you need not vex yourself about me.  Some day, when I am an
old man, I may come and bring you news of Lima.  Meanwhile, you will
sometimes wear this bracelet, and remember that you have an old friend.
I shall call on Lord Fitzjocelyn at the office to-morrow, and see if we
can find any clue to Robson's retreat.  Good-bye, and blessings on you,
Mary.'
Mary rejoined Louis, to speak to him of the kind and noble man who so
generously and resolutely bore the wreck of his hopes.  They walked up
and down together in the cool shade of the trees in the Consul's
garden, and they spoke of the unselfishness which seemed to take away
the smart from the wound of disappointment.  They spoke sometimes, but
the day was for the most part spent in the sweetness of pensive, happy
silence, musing with full hearts over this crowning of their long
deferred hopes, and not without prayer that the same protecting Hand
might guide them, as they should walk together through life.
By-and-by Mary disappeared.  She would perhaps have preferred her
ordinary dress--but the bridal white seemed to her to be due both to
Louis and to the solemn rite and mystery; and when the time came, she
met him, in her plain white muslin and long veil, confined by a few
sprays of real orange flowers, beneath which her calmly noble face was
seen, simple and collected as ever, forgetting in her earnestness all
adjuncts that might have been embarrassing or distressing.
The large hall was darkening with twilight, and the flowers and
branches that decked it showed gracefully in the subdued light. Prayer
and praise had lately echoed there, and Louis and Mary could feel that
He was with them who blessed the pair at Cana, far distant as they were
from their own church--their own home.  Yes, the Church, their mother,
their home, was with them in her sacred ritual and her choice
blessings, and their consciences were free from self-will, or
self-pleasing, such as would have put far from them the precious gifts
promised in the name of their Lord.
When it was over, and they first raised their eyes to one another's
faces, each beheld in the other a look of entire thankful content, not
the less perfect because it was grave and peaceful.
'I think mamma would be quite happy,' said Mary.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE MARVEL OF PERU.
Turn, Angelina, ever dear,
My charmer, turn to see
Thy own, thy long-lost Edwin here,
Restored to love and thee,
GOLDSMITH.
Lord Ormersfield sat alone in the library, where the fire burnt more
for the sake of cheerfulness than of warmth.  His eyes were weary with
reading, and, taking off his spectacles, he turned his chair away from
the table, and sat gazing into the fire, giving audience to dreamy
thoughts.
He missed the sunny face ever prompt to watch his moods, and find or
make time for the cheerful word or desultory chat which often broke and
refreshed drier occupation.  He remembered when he had hardly tolerated
the glass of flowers, the scraps of drawing, the unbusinesslike books
at his son's end of the table, but the room looked dull without them
now, and he was ready to own the value of the grace and finish of life,
hindering the daily task from absorbing the whole man, as had been the
case with himself in middle life.
Somewhat of the calm of old age had begun to fall on the Earl, and he
had latterly been wont to think more deeply.  These trifles could not
have spoken to his heart save for their connexion with his son, and
even Louis's tastes would have worn out with habit, had it not been for
the radiance permanent in his own mind, namely, the thankful, adoring
love that finds the true brightness in "whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report."
This spirit it was which had kept his heart fresh, his spirit youthful,
and changed constitutional versatility into a power of hearty
adaptation to the least congenial tastes.
Gentleness, affection, humility, and refinement were in his nature.
Mrs. Frost had trained these qualities into the beauty of Christian
graces; and Mrs. Ponsonby and her daughter had taught him to bring his
high principles to supply that which was wanting.  Indolence of will,
facility of disposition, unsteadiness of purpose, inconsiderate
impulses without perseverance, had all betokened an inherent weakness,
which the Earl's cure, ambition, had been powerless to remedy; but duty
had been effectual in drawing strength out of what had been feeble by
nature.  It was religion that had made a man of Louis; and his father
saw and owned it, no longer as merely the woman's guide in life and the
man's resource chiefly in death, to be respected and moderately
attended to, but never so as to interfere unreasonably with the world.
No; he had learnt that it was the only sure and sound moving-spring: he
knew it as his son's strengthening, brightening thread of life; and
began to perceive that his own course might have been less gloomy and
less harsh, devoid of such dark strands, had he held the right clue.
The contrast brought back some lines which, without marking, he had
heard Louis and his aunt reading together, and, albeit little wont to
look into his son's books, he was so much haunted by the rhythm that he
rose and searched them out--
Yea, mark him well, ye cold and proud,
Bewildered in a heartless crowd,
Starting and turning pale
At rumour's angry din:
No storm can now assail
The charm he bears within.
Rejoicing still, and doing good,
And with the thought of God imbued,
No glare of high estate,
No gloom of woe or want,
The radiance may abate,
Where Heaven delights to haunt.
The description went to his heart, so well did it agree with Louis. Yet
there was a sad feeling, for the South American mail had been some days
due, and he had not heard of his son since he was about to land at
Callao.  Five months was a long absence; and as the chances of failure,
disappointment, climate, disease, and shipwreck arose before him, he
marvelled at himself for having consented to peril his sole treasure,
and even fancied that a solitary, childless old age might be the
penalty in store for having waited to be led heavenward by his son.
It was seldom that the Earl gave way, and, reproaching himself for his
weakness, he roused himself and rang the bell for better light. There
was a movement in the house, and for some moments the bell was not
answered; but presently the door was opened.
'Bring the other lamp.'
'Yes, my Lord.'
The slow, soft voice did not belong to Frampton.  He started up, and
there stood Louis!
'My dear father,' he said; and Lord Ormersfield sprang up, grasped his
son's hand, and laid the other hand on his shoulder, but durst ask no
questions, for the speedy return seemed to bespeak that he had failed.
He looked in Louis's face, and saw it full of emotion, with dew on the
eyelashes; but suddenly a sweet archness gleamed in the eyes, and he
steadied his trembling lip to say with a smile,
'Lady Fitzjocelyn!'
And that very moment Mary was in Lord Ormersfield's arms.
'My children! my dear children, happy at last!  God bless you!  This is
all I ever wished!'
He held a hand of each, and looked from one to the other till Mary
turned away to hide her tears of joy; and Louis, with his eyes still
moist, began talking, to give her time to recover.
'You will forgive our not writing?  We landed this morning, found the
last mail was not come in, and could not help coming on.  We knew you
would be anxious, and thought you would not mind the suddenness.'
'No, indeed,' said his father; 'if all surprises were like this one!
But you are the loser, Mary.  I am afraid this is not the reception for
a bride!'
'Mary has dispensed with much that belongs to a bride,' said Louis.
'See here!' and, seizing her hand, he began pulling off her glove, till
she did it for him; 'did you ever see such a wedding-ring?--a great,
solid thing of Peruvian gold, with a Spanish posy inside!'
'I like it,' said Mary; 'it shows--'
'What you are worth, eh, Mary?  Well! here we are!  It seems real at
last!  And you, father, have you been well?'
'Yes, well indeed, now I have you both!  But how came you so quickly?
You never brought her across the Isthmus?'
'Indeed I did.  She would come.  It was her first act of rebellion; for
we were not going to let you meet the frosts alone--the October frosts,
I mean; I hope the Dynevor Frosts are all right?'
Frampton was here seen at the open door, doubtful whether to intrude;
yet, impelled by necessity, as he caught Fitzjocelyn's eye, he,
hesitating, said--
'My Lord, the Spanish gentleman!'
'The greatest triumph of my life!' cried Louis, actually clapping his
hands together with ecstacy, to the butler's extreme astonishment.
'Why, Frampton, don't you know him?'
'My Lord!!!'
'Let me introduce you, then, to--Mr. Thomas Madison!' and, as Frampton
still stood perplexed, looking at the fine, foreign-looking man, who
was keeping in the background, busied with the luggage, Louis
continued, 'You cannot credit such a marvel of Peru!'
'Young Madison, my Lord!' repeated Frampton, slowly coming to his
senses.
'No other.  He has done Lady Fitzjocelyn and all of us infinite
service,' continued Louis, quickly, to prevent Madison's reception from
receiving a fall in proportion to the grandeur of the first impression.
'He is to stay here for a short time before going to his appointment at
Bristol, in Mr. Ward's counting-house, with a salary of 180 pounds. I
shall be much obliged if you will make him welcome.'
And, returning in his glee to the library, Louis found Mary explaining
how 'a gentleman at Lima,' who had long professed to covet so good a
clerk as Madison, had, on the break-up of their firm, offered him a
confidential post, for which he was well fitted by his knowledge of the
Spanish language and the South American trade, to receive the cargoes
sent home.  'In truth,' said Louis, coming in, 'I had reason to be
proud of my pupil.  We could never have found our way through the
accounts without him; and the old Cornish man, whom we sent for from
the mines, gave testimony to him such as will do Mr. Holdsworth's heart
good.  But nothing is equal to Frampton's taking him for a Spanish Don!'
'And poor Delaford's witness was quite as much to his credit,' said
Mary.
'Ay! if Delaford had not been equally willing to depose against him
when he was the apparent Catiline!' said Louis.  'Poor Delaford! he was
very useful to us, after all; and I should be glad to know he had a
better fate than going off to the diggings with a year's salary in his
pocket!'
(Footnote.  A recent writer relates that he found the near relation of
a nobleman gaining a scanty livelihood as shoe-black at the diggings.
Query.  Might not this be Mr. Delaford?)
'Then everything is settled?' asked his father.
'Almost everything.  The mines are off our hands, and the transfer will
be completed as soon as Oliver has sent his signature; and there's
quite enough saved to make them very comfortable.  You have told me
nothing of them yet?'
'They are all very well.  James has been coming here twice a-week since
I have been at home, and has been very attentive and pleasant; but I
have not been at the Terrace much.  There never was such a houseful of
children.  Oliver's room is the only place where one is safe from
falling over two or three.  However, they seem to like it, and to
think, the more the better.  James came over here the morning after the
boy was born, as much delighted as if he had had any prospects.'
'A boy at last!  Poor Mr. Dynevor!  Does he take it as an insult to his
misfortunes?'
'He seems as well pleased as they; and, in fact, I hope the boy may
not, after all, be unprovided for.  Mr. Mansell wrote to offer to be
godfather, and I thought I could not do otherwise than ask him to stay
here.  I am glad I did so, for he told me that now he has seen for
himself the noble way they are going on in, he has made up his mind.
He has no relation nearer than Isabel, and he means to make his will in
favour of her son.  He asked whether I would be a trustee, but I said I
was growing old, and had little doubt you would be glad enough.  You
will have plenty of such work, Louis.  It is very dangerous to be known
as a good man-of-business, and good-natured.'
'Pray, how does Jem bear it?'
'With tolerable equanimity.  It may be many years before the child is
affected by it, if Mrs. Mansell has it for her life.  Besides, James is
a wiser man than he used to be.'
'He has been somewhat like Robinson Crusoe's old goat,' said Louis.
'Poor Jem! the fall and the scanty fare tamed him.  I liked him so well
before, that I did not know how much better I was yet to like him.
Mary, you must see his workhouse.  Giving up his time to it as he does,
he does infinite good there.'
'Yes, Mr. Calcott says that he lives in fear of some one offering him a
living,' said Lord Ormersfield.
'And the dear old Giraffe?' said Louis.
'Clara?  She is looking almost handsome.  I wish some good man would
marry her.  She would make an excellent wife.'
'I am not ready to spare her yet,' said Mary; 'I must make acquaintance
with her before any excellent man carries her off.'
'But there is a marriage that will surprise you,' said the Earl; 'your
eldest cousin, whose name I can never remember--'
'Virginia,' cried Louis.  'Captain Lonsdale, I hope!'
'What could have made you fix on him?'
'Because the barricades could not have been in vain, and he was an
excellent fellow, to whom I owe a great deal of gratitude.  He kept my
aunt's terrors in abeyance most gallantly; and little Virginia drank in
his words, and built up a hero!  But how was it?'
'You remember that Lady Conway would not take our advice, and stay
quietly at home.  On the first steamer she fell in with this captain,
and it seems that she was helpless enough, without her former butler,
to be very grateful to him for managing her passports and conducting
her through Germany.  And the conclusion was, that she herself had
encouraged him so far, that she really had not any justification in
refusing when he proposed for the young lady, as he is fairly provided
for.'
'My poor aunt!  No one ever pities her when she is 'hoist with her own
petard!'  I am glad poor Virginia is to be happy in her own way.'
'I shall send my congratulations to-morrow,' said the Earl, smiling
triumphantly, 'and a piece of intelligence of my own.  At H. B. M.
Consul's, Lima--what day was it, Louis?'
Mary ran away to take off her bonnet, as much surprised by the Earl's
mirth as if she had seen primroses in December.  Yet such blossoms are
sometimes tempted forth; and affection was breathing something like a
second spring on the life so long unnaturally chilled and blighted.
If his shoulders were bowed, his figure had lost much of its rigidity;
and though his locks were thinned and whitened, and his countenance
slightly aged, yet the softened look and the more frequent smile had
smoothed away the sternness, and given gentleness to his dignity.
No sooner was she out of the room than Lord Ormersfield asked, 'And
what have you done with the Spanish woman?'
The answer excited a peal of laughter, which made Louis stand aghast,
both at such unprecedented merriment and at the cause; for hitherto he
had so entirely felt with Mary, as never to have seen the ludicrous
aspect of the elopement.  Presently, however, he was amused by
perceiving that his father not merely regarded it as a relief from an
embarrassing charge, but as an entire acquittal for his own conscience
for any slanders he had formerly believed of Dona Rosita.
Louis briefly explained that, the poor lady being provided for by
Robson's investments in America, he had thought it right that the
Ponsonby share of the firm should bear the loss through these
embezzlements; and he had found that her extravagance had made such
inroads on the property, that while the Dynevor share (always the
largest) resulted in a fair competence, Louis had saved nothing out of
the wreck of the Ponsonby affairs but Mary herself.  'Can you excuse
it, father?' he said, with all the old debonnaire manner.
'You will never be a rich man, Louis.  You and she will have some
cares, but--' and his voice grew thick--'you are rich in what makes
life happy.  You have left me nothing more to ask or wish for!'
'Except that I may be worthy of her, father.  You first taught me how
she ought to be loved.  You have been very patient with me all this
time.  I feel as if I must thank you for her--' and then, changing his
tone as she opened the door--'Look at her now she has her bonnet
off--does not she look natural?'
'I am sure I feel so,' said Mary.  'You know this always seemed more
like home than anything else.'
'Yes, and now I do feel sure that I have you at last, Mary.  That
Moorish castle of yours used to make me afraid of wakening: it was so
much fitter for Isabel's fantastic Viscount.  By-the-bye, has she
brought that book out?'
'Oh, yes, and James is nearly as proud of it as he is of his son.  He
actually wanted me to read it!  He tells me it is selling very well,
and I hope it may really bring them in something.'
'Now, then--there's the tea.  Sit down, Mary, and look exactly as you
did the morning I came home and found you.'
'I'm afraid I cannot,' said Mary, looking up in his face with an arch,
deprecating expression.
'Why not?'
'Don't you know that I am so much happier?'
Before breakfast next morning Fitzjocelyn must visit his farm, and Mary
must come with him.
How delicious was that English morning after their voyage; the slant
rays of the sun silvering the turf, and casting rainbows across the
gossamer threads from one brown bent to another; the harvest fields on
the slopes dotted with rich sheaves of wheat; the coppices, in their
summer glory, here and there touched with the gold of early autumn, and
the slopes and meadows bright with lively green, a pleasant change for
eyes fresh from the bare, rugged mountain-side and the rank unwholesome
vegetation of Panama.  Shaggy little Scottish oxen were feeding on the
dewy grass, their black coats looking sleek in the sun beyond the long
shadows of the thorns; but as Mary said, laughing, 'Only Farmer
Fitzjocelyn's cattle came here now,' and she stopped more than once to
be introduced to some notable animal, or to hear the history of
experiments in fatting beasts.
'There! they have found you out!  That's for you,' said Louis, as a
merry peal of bells broke out from the church tower, and came joyously
up through the tranquil air.  'Yes, Ormersfield, you are greeting a
friend!  You may be very glad, old place!  I wish Mr. Holdsworth would
come up to breakfast!  Is it too wet for you this way, Mary?'
This way was into Fernydell, and Mary answered, 'Oh, no--no; it is
where I most wanted to go with you.  We have never been there together
since--'
'No, you never would walk with me after I could go alone!' said Louis,
with a playful tone of reproach, veiling deep feeling.
In silence he handed her down the rocky steps, plunging deeper among
the hazels and rowan-trees; then pausing, he turned aside the luxuriant
leaves of a tuft of hartstongue, and showed her, cut on a stone, veiled
both by the verdure and the form of the rock, the letters--
Deo Gratias,
L. F. 1847.
'I like that!' was all that Mary's full heart allowed her to say.
'Yes,' said Louis, 'I feel quite as thankful for the accident as for
the preservation.'
'And that dear mamma was with us,' added Mary.  'Between her and you,
it was a blessing to us all.  I see these letters are not new; you must
have cut them out long ago.'
'As soon as I could get here without help,' he answered.  'I thought I
should be able to find the very spot where I lay, by remembering the
cross which the bare mountain-ash boughs made against the sky; but by
that time they were all leaf and flower; and now, do you see, there
they are, with the fruit just formed and blushing.'
'Like other things,' said Mary, reaching after the spray, 'once all
blossom, now--'
'Fruit very unripe,' as he said, between a smile and a sigh; 'but there
is some encouragement in the world after all, and every project of mine
has not turned out like my two specimens of copper ore.  You remember
them, Mary and our first encounter?'
'Remember it!' said Mary.  'I don't think I forgot a day of that
summer.'
'What I brought you here for,' said Louis, 'was to ask you to let me do
what I have long wished--to let me put the letter M here?'
'I think you might have done it without leave,' said Mary.
'So I might at first, but by the time I came here again, Mary, you had
become in my estimation 'a little more than kin,' and less than--no, I
wont say that, but one could not treat you as comfortably as Clara.  I
lost a cousin one August day, and never found her again!'
'Never?'
'Never--but the odd thing is, that I cannot believe that what I did
find has been away these seven years.'
'Yes, that is very strange,' said Mary; 'I have felt it so.  Wo do seem
to understand and guess each other's thoughts as if we had been going
on together all this time.  I believe it is because you gave me the
first impulse to think, and taught me the way.'
'And I know who first taught me to think to any purpose,' said Louis,
smiling.  'But who is this descending on us?'
It was the Spanish gentleman, reddening all over at such an encounter,
in mid-career towards her at the Terrace, and muttering something,
breathless and almost surly, about begging pardon.
'Look here, Tom,' said Louis, lifting the leaves to show the letters.
'That is all I ever could feel on that matter, and so should you.
There, no more about it,--you want to be on your way; and tell Mr.
Frost that we shall be at Northwold in the afternoon.'
About half an hour after, Clara was delicately blowing the dust out of
the wreath of forget-me-nots on the porcelain shepherdess's hat, when a
shriek resounded through the house, and, barely saving the Arcadian in
her start, she rushed downstairs.  James, in his shirt-sleeves, was
already on his way to the kitchen.  There Kitty was found, too much
frightened, to run away, making lunges with the toasting-fork at a
black-bearded figure, who held in his arms Charlotte Arnold, in a fit
of the almost forgotten hysterics.  The workhouse girl shrieked for the
police; Jane was at Master Oliver's door, prepared for flight or
defence; Isabel stood on the stairs, with her baby in her arms, and her
little flock clinging to her skirts, when Clara darted back, laughing
too much to speak distinctly, as she tried to explain who the ruffian
really was.
'And Louis is coming, and Mary!  Oh! Isabel, he has her at last!  Oh!
Jem! Jem! did we ever want dear granny so much!  I always knew it would
come right at last!  Jane, Jane, do you hear, Lord Fitzjocelyn is
married!  Let me in; I must go and tell Uncle Oliver!'
James looked at Isabel, and read in her smile Clara's final acquittal
from all suspicions beneath the dignity of both.  Uncle Oliver would
have damped her joy, had it been in his power.  He gave up his affairs
as hopeless, as soon as he found that young Fitzjocelyn had only made
them an excuse for getting married, and he was so excessively angry
with her for being happy, that she found she must carry her joyous face
out of his sight.
It was not easy to be a dignified steady governess that morning, and
when the lessons were finished, she could have danced home all the way.
She had scarcely reached the Terrace gate, when the well-known sound of
the wheels was heard, and in another moment she was between the two
dear cousins; Fitzjocelyn's eyes dancing with gladsomeness, and Mary's
broad tranquil brow and frank kindly smile, free from the shadow of a
single cloud!  Clara's heart leapt up with joy, joy full and unmixed,
the guerdon of the spirit untouched by vanity or selfishness, without
one taint that could have mortified into jealous, disappointed pain.
It was bliss to one of those whom she loved best, it was the winning of
a brother and sister, and perhaps Clara's life had never had a happier
moment.
Lord Ormersfield could have thanked her for that joyous, innocent
welcome.  He had paid her attentions for his son's sake, of which he
had become rather ashamed; and as Louis and Mary hastened on to meet
James and Isabel, he detained her for a moment, to say some special
words of kindness.  Clara, perhaps, had an intuitive perception of his
meaning, and reference to her past heiress state, for she laughed
gaily, and said, 'Yes, I never was more glad of anything!  He was so
patient that I was sure he deserved it!  I always trusted to such a
time as this, when he used to talk to me for want of dear grandmamma.'
Mary was led upstairs to be introduced to the five children, while the
gentlemen went over the accounts in Oliver's room.  Enough had been
rescued from the ruin to secure, not wealth, but fair competence; the
mines were disposed of to a company which would pay the value by
instalments, and all the remainder of the business was in train to be
easily wound up by Mr. Ward.  Mr. Dynevor's gratitude was not
overpowering: he was short and dry, privately convinced that he could
have managed matters much better himself, and charging all the loss on
Fitzjocelyn's folly in letting Robson escape.  But, though James was
hurt at his unthankfulness, and Lord Ormersfield could have been very
angry, the party most concerned did not take it much to heart; he
believed he had done his best, but an experienced eye might detect
blunders, and he knew it was hard to trust affairs out of one's own
hands.
Even the Earl was glad to escape to the sitting-room, though every one
was talking at once, and Mercy the loudest; and Louis, as the children
would call him in spite of their mamma, was at once seized on by Kitty
to be introduced to 'our brother.'
'And what is his name, Kitty?'
'Woland!' shouted all the young ladies in chorus.
'Sir Woland is in the book that mamma did make,' said Kitty.
Louis looked at Isabel with laughing eyes.
'It was Uncle Oliver's great wish,' she said, 'and we did not wish to
remember the days of Sir Hubert.'
Before Lord Ormersfield was quite deafened, Louis recollected that they
must show Mary at the House Beautiful; and they took leave.  The Earl
begged James to come back to dinner with them, and Louis asked if Clara
could not find room in the carriage too.  It was the earnest of what
Ormersfield was to be to her henceforth, and she was all delight, and
earnestness to be allowed to walk home with James by starlight.  And
the evening realized all she could wish.  The gentlemen had their
conversation in the dining-room, and Mary and Clara sat on the steps
together in the warm twilight, and talked of granny; and Clara poured
out all that Mary did not yet know of Louis.
'I hear you have been in hysterics again,' had been Lord Fitzjocelyn's
greeting to Charlotte.  'You are prepared for the consequences.'
Charlotte was prepared.  The mutual pardon had not been very hard to
gain, and Tom had only to combat her declarations that it was downright
presumptuous for her to have more than master had a year, and her
protests that she could not leave her mistress and the dear children in
their poverty.  The tidings that they were relieved from their present
straits answered this scruple, and Charlotte was a pretty picture of
shrinking exultation when she conducted her betrothed to Mrs. Martha,
who, however, declared that she would not take his hundred and eighty
pounds a year--no, nor twice that,--to marry him in that there black
beard.
Mrs. Beckett made him exceedingly welcome, and he spent the chief part
of his time at No. 5, where he was much more at ease than at
Ormersfield.  He confessed that, though not given to bashfulness before
any man, there was something in Mr. Frampton's excessive civility that
quite overcame him, and made him always expect to be kicked out of
doors the next minute for sauciness.
Charlotte's whirlwinds of feeling had nearly expended themselves in
that one shock of meeting.  The years of cheerful toil, and the weeks
of grief and suspense, had been good training for that silly little
heart, and the prospect of her new duties brought on her a sobering
sense of responsibility.  She would always be tender and clinging, but
the fragrant woodbine would be trained round a sound, sturdy oak, and
her modesty, gentleness, and sincerity, gave every promise of her being
an excellent wife.
Tom had little time to spare before undertaking his new office, and it
was better that the parting should be speedy, for it was a grievous
one, both to the little bride and to Isabel and the children.  Friend
rather than servant, her place could be ill supplied by the two maids
who were coming in her room, and Isabel could have found it in her
heart to sympathize with Mercy and Salome in their detestation of the
black man who was coming to take away their dear Charlotte.
Clara's first outlay, on her restoration to comparative wealth, was on
Charlotte's wedding-dress.  It was a commission given to Mary, when
with Fitzjocelyn, she went to London for one day, to put the final
stroke to the dissolution of the unfortunate firm, and to rejoice Aunt
Melicent with the sight of her happiness.
Good old Miss Ponsonby's heart was some degrees softer and less narrow
than formerly.  She had a good many prejudices left, but she did not
venture on such sweeping censures as in old times, and she would have
welcomed Lord Ormersfield with real cordiality, for the sake of his
love to her Mary.  Indeed, Louis's fascinations and Mary's bright face
had almost persuaded her into coming home with them; but the confirmed
Londoner prevailed, and she had a tyrant maid-servant, who would not
let her go, even to the festival at Ormersfield in honour of her niece.
The Earl was bent on rejoicings for his son's marriage, and Louis
dexterously managed that the banquet should take place on the day fixed
for Tom's wedding, thus casting off all oppressive sense of display, by
regarding it as Madison's feast instead of his own. Clara, who seemed
to have been set free from governess tasks solely to be the willing
slave of all the world, worked as hard as Mary and Louis at all the
joyous arrangements; nor was the festival itself, like many such
events, less bright than the previous toils.
The wedding took place in Ormersfield Church, on a bright September
morning; James Frost performed the marriage, Lord Fitzjocelyn gave the
bride away, and little Kitty was the bridesmaid.  The ring was of
Peruvian gold, and the brooch that clasped the bride's lace collar was
of silver from the San Benito mine.  In her white bonnet and
dove-coloured silk, she looked as simple and ladylike as she was
pretty, and a very graceful contrast to her Spanish gentleman
bridegroom.
The Ormersfield bowling-green, which was wont to be so still and
deserted, hemmed in by the dark ilex belt, beheld such a scene as had
not taken place there since its present master was a boy.  There were
long tables spread for guests of all ranks and degrees.  Louis had his
own way with the invitations, and had gathered a miscellaneous host.
Sir Miles Oakstead had come to see his old friend made happy, and to
smile as he was introduced to the rose-coloured pastor in his glass
case.  Mr. Calcott was there, and Mrs. Calcott, all feuds with Mrs.
James Frost long since forgotten; and Sir Gilbert Brewster shone in his
colonel's uniform,--for Lady Fitzjocelyn had intimated a special desire
that all the members of the yeomanry should appear in costume; and many
a young farmer's wife and sister came all the more proudly, in the fond
belief that her own peculiar hero looked in his blue and silver 'as
well as Lord Fitzjocelyn himself.'  And Miss Mercy Faithful was there,
watching over Oliver, to make up for the want of her sister.  And old
Mr. Walby was bowing and gossiping with many a patient; and James, with
his little brown woman in his hand, was looking after the party of
paupers for whom he had obtained a holiday; and Mr. Holdsworth was
keeping guard over his village boys, whose respectable parents remained
in two separate throngs, male and female; and Clara Frost was here,
there, and everywhere--now setting Mrs. Richardson at ease, now
carrying little Mercy to look at the band, now conveying away Salome
when frightened, now finding a mother for a village child taken with a
sobbing fit of shyness, now conducting a stray schoolboy to his
companions, now running up for a few gay words to her old uncle, to
make sure that he was neither chilly nor tired.  How pleasant it was to
her to mingle with group after group of people, and hear from one and
another how handsome and how happy Lord Fitzjocelyn looked, and Lady
Fitzjocelyn quite beautiful; and, then, as they walked from party to
party, setting all at ease and leaving pleased looks wherever they
went, to cross them now and then, and exchange a blithe smile or merry
remark.
No melancholy gaps here! thought she, as she helped her uncle to the
easy chair prepared for him at the dinner-table; no spiritless
curiosity, no forced attempts to display what no one felt!
There must needs be toasts, and such as thought themselves assembled
for the sake of the 'marriage in high life,' were taken by surprise
when Lord Fitzjocelyn rose, and began by thanking those assembled for
assisting in doing honour to the event of the day--the marriage of two
persons, for each of whom he himself as well as those most dear to him
felt the warmest respect and gratitude for essential services and
disinterested attachment, alike in adversity and in prosperity.
Unpleasant as he knew it was to have such truths spoken to one's face,
he could not deny himself the satisfaction of expressing a portion of
the esteem and reverence he felt for such noble conduct as had been
displayed by those whose health he had the pleasure to propose--Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas Madison.
'There,' was his aside, as he sat down, 'I only hope I have not made
him surly; poor fellow, I have put him in a predicament, but it could
not be otherwise!'
Clara had tears in her eyes, but not like those she had shed at
Cheveleigh; James gave Louis a look of heartfelt gratitude, bowed the
lowest to the happy pair, and held up little Kitty that her imitative
nod and sip might not be lost upon them.
Mrs. Beckett said, 'Well, I never!  If ever a girl deserved it,'
choked, and flourished her white handkerchief; Frampton saluted like my
Lord and Louis XIV. rolled into one; and Warren and Gervas privately
agreed that they did not know what was coming of the world, since
Marksedge poachers had only to go to foreign parts to be coined goold
in the silver mines.  Mrs. Madison's pretty face was all blushes,
smiles, and tears.  Mr. Madison rose to reply with unexpected alacrity,
and Louis was soon relieved from anxiety, at least, as far as regarded
his eloquence, for he thought in the majestic Spanish idiom, and
translated as he went--
'My Lords,' he began, 'gentlemen and ladies and neighbours, my Lord
Fitzjocelyn has done my wife and myself an honour as unlooked-for as
undeserved; and the manner of the favour is such that we shall carry
the grateful remembrance to the end of our lives.  He has been so
condescending as to speak of such services as it was in our power to
render; but he has passed over in silence that which gives him a claim
to the utmost that I could place at his feet.  He will forgive me for
speaking openly, for I cannot refrain from disburthening my mind, and
letting you know, even more than you are at present aware of, what your
Senor--what your Lord truly is.  Most of you have known me but too
well.  It is not ten years since I was a rude, untaught boy upon the
heath, such as a large proportion of those present would deem beneath
their notice: Lord Fitzjocelyn did not think so.  His kindness of
manner and encouraging words awakened in me new life and energy.  He
gave me his time and his teaching, and, what was far more, he gave me
his sympathy and his example.  It was these which gave vitality to
lessons dimly understood, or which had fallen dead on my ears, when
only heard in my irregular attendance at school. But the work in me was
tardy, and at first I requited his kindness with presumption,
insubordination, and carelessness.  Then, when I had been dismissed,
and when my wilful neglect had occasioned the accident of which the
traces are still only too visible, then, did I not merit to be exposed
and cast off for ever?  I knew it, and I fled, as if I could leave
behind me my grief and my shame.  Little did I dare to guess that he
was dealing with me as though I had been his own brother, and
scrupulously concealing my share in the misfortune.  When I returned,
sullen and overwhelmed, he alone--yes! and while still suffering
severely--spoke a kind word to me, and exerted himself to rescue me
from the utter ruin and degradation to which despair would have led me.
He placed me in the situation which conducted me to my present
position; he gave me the impulse to improve myself; and, above all, he
infused into me the principles without which the rest would have been
mere temptations.  If I have been blest beyond my deserts--if I have
been prosperous beyond reasonable expectation--if, among numerous
failures, I have withstood some evils--all, under the greatest and
highest Benefactor, is owing to the kindness, and, above all, to the
generous forbearance of Lord Fitzjocelyn.  I wish I could testify my
gratitude in any better manner than by speaking of him to his face; but
I am sure you will all drink his health more heartily, if possible, for
knowing one more trait in addition to your own personal experience of
his character!'
Alas! that all things hidden, and yet to be proclaimed on the
house-tops, would bear the light as well as Fitzjocelyn's secret!  The
revelation of this unobtrusive act of patience and forbearance excited
a perfect tumult of enthusiasm among persons already worked up to great
ardour for one so beloved; and shouts, and even tears, on every side
strove in vain to express the response to Madison's words.
'Too bad, Tom!' was Louis's muttered comment.
'You are paid in your own coin,' retorted Mary, raising her glistening
eyes, full of archness.
'I perceive it is no surprise to you, Lady Fitzjocelyn!' said Sir Miles
Oakstead; 'and, I own, nothing from that quarter' (nodding at Louis)
'surprises me greatly.'
'She practised eavesdropping,' said Louis, 'when the poor fellow was
relieving his mind by a confession to the present Mrs. Madison.'
'And I think Mrs. Madison and I deserve credit for having kept the
secret so long,' said Mary.
'It explains,' observed Mr. Holdsworth.  'I did not understand your
power over Madison.'
'It was the making of us both,' said Louis; 'and a very fine specimen
of the grandeur of that rough diamond.  It elucidates what I have
always said, that if you can but find the one vulnerable place, there
is a wonderful fund of nobleness in some of these people.'
'Do you take this gentleman as an average specimen?'
'Every ploughboy is not an undeveloped Madison; but in every parish
there may be some one with either the thinking or the rising element
in his composition; and if the right ingredient be not added, the
fermentation will turn sour, as my neglect had very nearly made it do
with him.  He would have been a fine demagogue by this time, if he had
not had a generous temper and Sunday-school foundation.'
'Hush!' said Mary, smiling--'you must not moralize.  I believe you are
doing it that poor Farmer Norris may not catch your eye.'
Louis gave a debonnaire glance of resignation; and the farmer, rising
in the full current of feeling caused by Madison's speech, said, with
thorough downright emotion, that he knew it was of no use to try to
enhance what had been already so well expressed, but he believed there
was scarcely a person present who did not feel, equally with Mr.
Madison, the right to claim Lord Fitzjocelyn as a personal friend,--and
an irrepressible hum of fervent assent proved how truly the farmer
spoke.  'Yes,--each had in turn experienced so much of his friendly
kindness, and, what was more, of his sympathy, that he could
confidently affirm that there was scarcely one in the neighbourhood who
had not learnt the news of his happiness as if some good thing had
happened to himself individually.  They all as one man were delighted
to have him at home again, and to wish him joy of the lady, whom many
of them know already well enough to rejoice in welcoming her for her
own sake, as well as for that of Lord Fitzjocelyn.'
Again and again did the cheers break forth--hearty, homely, and
sincere; and such were the bright, tearful, loving eyes, which sought
those of Fitzjocelyn on every side, that his own filled so fast that
all seemed dazzled and misty, and he hastily strove to clear them as he
arose; but the swelling of his heart brought the happy dew again, and
would scarcely let him find voice.  'My friends, my dear, good friends,
you are all very kind to me.  It is of no use to tell you how little I
deserve it, but you know how much I wish to do so, and here is one who
has helped me, and who will help me.  We thank you with all our hearts.
You may well wish my father and me joy, and yourselves too.  Thank you;
you should not look at me so kindly if you wish me to say more.'
The Earl, who had studied popularity as a useful engine, but had never
prized love beyond his own family, was exceedingly touched by the
ardour of enthusiastic affection that his son had obtained,--not by
courting suffrages, not by gifts, not by promises, but simply by real
open-hearted love to every one.  Lord Ormersfield himself came in for
demonstrations of warm feeling which he would certainly never have
sought nor obtained ten years ago, when he was respected and looked up
to as an upright representative of certain opinions; but personally,
either disliked or regarded with coldness.
He knew what these cheers were worth, and that even Fitzjocelyn might
not long be the popular hero; but he was not the less gratified and
triumphant, and felt that no success of his whole life had been worth
the present.
'After all, Clara,' said Oliver Dynevor, as his nephew and niece were
assisting him to the carriage, 'they have managed these things better
than we did, though they did not have Gunter.'
'Gunter can't bring heart's love down from town in a box,' said Clara,
in a flash of indignation.  'No, dear uncle, there are things that
can't be got unless by living for them.'
'Nor even by living for them, Clara,' said James; 'you must live for
something else.'
Lord Ormersfield had heard these few last words, and there was deep
thought in his eye as he bade his cousins farewell at the hall door.
Clara was the last to take her place; and, as she turned round with a
merry smile to wish him goodbye, he said, 'You have been making
yourself very useful, Clara, I am afraid you have had no time to enjoy
yourself.'
'That's a contradiction,' said Clara, laughing; 'here's busy little
Kitty, who never is thoroughly happy but when she thinks she is useful,
and I am child enough to be of the same mind.  I never was unhappy but
when I was set to enjoy myself.  It has been the most beautiful day of
my life.  Thank you for it.  Goodbye!'
The Earl crossed the hall, and found Mary standing alone on the terrace
steps, looking out at the curling smoke from the cottage chimneys, and
on the coppices and hedge-rows.
'Are you tired, my dear?' he said.
'Oh no!  I was only thinking of dear mamma's persuading Louis to go on
with the crumpled plans of those cottages.  How happy she would be.'
'I was thinking of her likewise,' said the Earl.  'She spoke truly when
she told me that he might not be what I then wished to make him, but
something far better.'
Mary looked up with a satisfied smile of approval, saying, 'I am so
glad you think so.'
'Yes,' said Lord Ormersfield, 'I have thought a good deal since.  I
have been alone here, and I think I see why Louis has done better than
some of his elders.  It seems to me that some of us have not known the
duties that lay by the way-side, so to speak, from the main purpose of
life.  I wish I could talk it over with your mother, my dear, what do
you think she would say?'
Mary thought of Louis's vision of the threads.  'I think,' she said,
'that I have heard her say something like it.  The real aim of life is
out of sight, and even good people are too apt to attach themselves to
what is tangible, like friendship or family affection, or usefulness,
or public spirit; but these are like the paths of glory which lead but
to the grave, and no farther.  It is the single-hearted, faithful aim
towards the one thing needful, to which all other things may be added
as mere accessories.  It brings down strength and wisdom.  It brings
the life everlasting already to begin in this life, and so makes the
path shine more and more unto the perfect day!'

1.F.
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
https://www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
