Such were the anxious thoughts of the ex-
piring Captain Rivington, when his sur-
geon pronounced the appalling sentence,
that he had only a few hours to survive;

and that the wound which he had. re.
ceived in the service of his country must
terminate an existence which a young
family rendered doubly valuable in his
sight.
Captain Rivington was a man whom
nature had endowed with the highest sen-
timents of honour; in his character reli-
gion and morality were so happily com-
bined, that he was not only a pattern of
imitation for his brother officers, but an
example for every individual in the more
private walks of life. That such an ami-
able being should have been cut off, in the
very flower of manhood, was not only a
misfortune to his family, but a serious
loss to all his friends; and even the
death of the gallant Nelson was not more
deeply or sincerely deplored. His wife
was young, beautiful, and amiable; and
being an orphan when he married her,
had vo protector but himself; therefore,
when he reflected upon the various trials

which she would be exposed to, his forti-
tude forsook him at the approach of
death. His children too, those dear
pledges of conjugal felicity, how could
he bear the thought of leaving them in
an unprotected state !for well did he
know, that the mildness of their mother's
disposition was ill calculated to subdue
the natural turbulence of the eldest boy.
Even in infancy Richard Rivington
had dispayed marks of a violent temper,
seldom discoverable at that early period
of life; and on no subject had Captain.
R. and his wife ever differed in opinion
but in the different methods. they
adopted in educating this child. Argu-
ments, during childhood, of course could
avail little; but the fond mother fancied
this darling boy would be influenced by
their weight; and from this false opinion
she lost that authority which every parent
ought to maintain.-Richard loved, with-
out fearing, his mother; and would

even dispute her authority before he was
five
years
of age; he soon became an ob-
ject of terror to his little brothers and
sister-for, except in his father's pre-
sence, his word was their law. Still there
were many amiable traits in his charac-
ter; he had a generous disposition and
a feeling heart; for if the impetuosity of
passion led him to commit any act of
violence, he was miserable until he had
made some atonement for his fault.
Each child was equally dear to Captain
Rivington, but Richard was the one
which excited the most anxiety in his
heart; as he was well aware that his dis-
position required the nicest of
the nicest of manage-
ment; for though he was convinced se-
verity would have hardened it, yet by
too much indulgence he was certain it
would be spoiled. The fate of war Cap-
tain Rivington knew to be uncertain ;
therefore, previous to quitting his family,
he made his will; and though he left his

three younger children under the sole di-
rection of their mother, Richard was
placed under the guardianship of two of
his most intimate friends, to whom he
separately addressed an affecting epistle,
filled with admonitory instructions re-
specting the future education of his boy.
When the melancholy news arrived of
the death of the gallant Rivington, the
youthful hero of the ensuing narrative
had just completed his tenth year; and
the very strong marks of sorrow which
ho testified upon the occasion, convinced
his guardians that indulgence had not
destroyed sensibility of heart: for three
or four days he could scarcely be per-
suaded to take any nourishment; he ab-
stained from those amusements in which
he had been accustomed to take so much
delight, and his mother was so much
alarmed by these proofs of unfeigned af-
fection, that she began to fear that the
death of a beloved husband would be

followed by a stroke almost as afilictive,
and that it would ultimately occasion
the loss of her favourite child.
"Violent passions however, fortunately,
seldom are very durable : Richard soon
began to derive pleasure from his childish
sports; and as the Christmas, vacation
was nearly completed, his guardians, in
obedience to the directions pointed out
in Captain Rivington's last proof of pa-
rental solicitude, informed his mother it
was their intention to send him immedi-
ately to a public school. As Captain R.
had received his education at Eton, he
had expressed a wish that his son should
do the same; and it was his opinion that a
public seminary would be the most likely
means of subduing the natural turbu-
le..cy of Richard's mind.
His mother was completely averse to
this proceeding : the - bare idea of her
darling's being exposed to the authority
of boys of a superior age, struck her as

an absolute piece of cruelty, and she
weakly resolved to dispute her husband's
will. It was in vain that Mr. Sandford
(which was the name of one of Richard's
guardians) endeavoured to convince her
of the propriety of the plan, or pointed
out the advantages arising from a public
education, when a boy is endowed with
good natural parts. Representation ra-
ther strengthened than weakened her an-
tipathy, and she resolved to consult a
distant relation, eminent in the law; but
being informed that the will of her hus-
band was as irrevocable as an edict, she .
found it necessary to submit.
To lessen as much as possible the pang
of separation, and to gratify the wishes
of this petted boy, Mrs. Rivington re-
solved to let the house in which, during
the life of her husband, she had resided,
and hire one within a short distance of
Richard's school. This plan once formed,
was rapidly put into execution ; and the

elegant little villa, which Captain Ri-
vington had taken so much pains to em-
bellish, with a taste peculiarly striking to
every beholder, was forsaken for a small
red brick house in one of the dirtiest
streets of Windsor, merely to gratify the
caprice of a spoiled child.
Few changes in life are more striking
than that which Richard Rivington ex-
perienced, for this little monarch, instead
of ruling with an iron sceptre, found him-
self suddenly compelled to obey his
school-fellows' commands; and as sub-
mission was forced, and the orders he re-
ceived executed with ill-humour, he was
made completely sensible of the degrad-
ing situation of a fag.
The lad, (to whom, according to the
rules of the school, he was compelled to
shew obedience) was the son of a rich
East Indian, recently arrived from Ben-
gal, and who had purchased one of the
most beautiful estates in Berkshire, for

the satisfaction of residing near this
hopeful young man. George M'Lean,
at the time the hero of my story became
an inhabitant of Eton, had just entered
into his fifteenth year; and being a boy
of strong natural parts, and blest with
a retentive memory, was considered as
one of the first geniuses in the school.-
Emulation was a striking feature in the
character of this gentleman, yet it did
not proceed from that praise-worthy de-
sire of becoming an ornament to that
station he was destined to fill, but from
a wish of displaying a superiority over
boys of his own age. An undeviating
attention to his studies, and a refined
plausibility of manners, rendered George
M'Lean an universal favourite with the
different masters who attended the school;
and though no boy had a stronger pro-
pensity to mischief, yet cunning and sa-
gacity enabled him always to get out of
every scrape.

RICHARD THE RUNAWAY.
Though born in India, George's pa-
rents were natives of Scotland, and had,
during childhood, instilled into his duc-
tile mind that pliancy of opinion to his
superiors which is so useful in a com-
merce with the world; and by the aid of
which, it was said that his father had ele-
vated himself from a very humble station
in life.
Yet let not my young readers imagine
I mean to condemn affability of man-
ners, or to censure those who laudably
endeavour to please ; for I am aware that
too much praise cannot be bestowed
upon those whose amiable disposition
leads them to study the happiness of those
with whom they associate in life, and to
relinquish self-gratification for the satis-
faction of rendering themselves agreeable
to their friends. Still it is necessary to
impress the youthful imagination with a
love of honour, and a sacred veneration
for truth; for the being wh from mo-
tives of self-interest prostitutes his real

sentiments, I consider as a character no
less despicable than the man who robs
upon the high road.
Artifice in youth, is a vice so innatural,
that I scarcely can find language suffi-
ciently strong to paint the detestation it
inspires; whilst the ingenuous acknow-
ledgment of a fault committed in the
moment of inconsiderate folly, imper-
ceptibly destroys that resentment which
the commission of it inspires. George
M.Lean, however, was seldom detected
in those juvenile indiscretions to which
boys of his age are generally prone ; for
by precaution and plausibility he so
completely imposed upon his instructors,
that he was not even suspected of being
guilty of a fault.
It has been observed, that Mrs. Ri.
vington had quitted a beautiful villa
upon the banks of the Avon for the
purpose of residing near the destined
abode of her favourite son; and upon

removing her young family to Windsor,
her first measure was to introduce ner-
'self to the head master of the school.
Doctor had witnessed too many
instances of the effect of maternal affec-
tion, to express any astonishment at the
measure Mrs. Rivington had pursued;
and finding the sympathy of his nature
excited by the tecent misfortune of this
plooming young widow, he promised to
shew a peculiar degree of indulgence to
her son.
The rules of the school, he in-
formed her, could not be infringed upon,
and for a short space of years the dar-
ling of her affection must inevitably be-
come a fag, or, in other words, submit
to the direction of a boy much older than
himself.
This was an appalling piece of intelli-
gence to this too partial mother, who
had flattered herself with the hope of in-
ducing Doctor H-- to receive the ob-
ject of her solicitude under his immediate

care, without having him subject to
the rules and regulations to which every
boy at a public seminary necessarily must
submit. To reconcile her as much as
possible to an irremediable misfortune,
the doctor promised to place Richard
under.tbe protection of the most amiable
lad in the school, and one, who, so far
from abusing the authority he was in-
vested with, would treat the little fellow
with as much tenderness as if he was a
brother of his own.

to whose care he was entrusted a pro-
tector and a friend. In selecting George
M'Lean as the guardian, or rather di-
rector, of young Rivington's actions,
Doctor H doubtless, believed he
was placing him under the protection of
an amiable boy, whose erample would be
far more instructive than precept, and
who would gently admonish him for any
childish fault.
Unfortunately for the young hero of
my narrative, the arrangement made be-
tween Doctor H and Mrs. Riving-
ton did not meet with the approbation
of Master M Lean, who, knowing his
former fag was sufficiently forward in
his studies to rise to the dignity of fag-
ging, had selected a domestic from the
junior boys, who had been some time at
school. As the terms fag and domestic

a public school, I think it necessary to in-
form them, that those boys who have ac-
quired a certain degree of knowledge in
the different sciences have each a junior
placed under their care, whom it is ex-
pected, during the hours of recreation,
they will endeavour to instruct.
This judicious intention has certainly,
in great measure, been perverted; for
the weak are compelled to pay the most
abject submission to the strong; and in-
stead of merely aiding them in their
learning (which was the original inten-
tion), the great boys compel the little
ones to perform the most menial tasks;
in short, they are forced to fulfil the
office of a domestic in the literal sense of
the word. The superiors, however, of
these respectable and learned institutions
apprehend that this infringement upon the
original design is attended with the most
salutary advantages to the rising age;
for they conceive that it humbles the

proud spirit of the overbearing, and ex-
cites emulation in the youthful mind;
as the little fag is solicitous to obtain
that degree of forwardness in his studies
which will insure him an equal portion of
authority in his turn.
I will no longer trespass upon
the
pa-
tience of my young readers, either by ex-
planations or remarks, but inform them,
that soon after the close of the Christ-
mas vacation, Master Rivington made
his first appearance in a public school.-
Nature certainly had been very bountiful
to this young gentleman; he was not
only handsome, but remarkably well
made: yet these advantages were coun-
teracted by a gloominess of countenance,
and a reservedness of manners, uncommon
in a boy of his age.-Certain it is, that
he did not possess the happy art of con-
ciliation ; he was not greeted by his
schoolfellows with that hearty welcome
which cheerfulness and good-humour inva-

riably receives; and MLean was so lit-
tle pleased with the proteg Doctor
H had assigned to him, that he
could scarcely assume an appearance of
kindness whilst in his master's sight.
Richard had too long been accustomed
to exert authority over his brothers and
sister patiently to submit to controul;
but as obedience was enforced by means
much more powerful than argument, he
found that remonstrance would be vain.
Ten days elapsed without obtaining sight
of his indulgent parent, and during that
tedious period of time what a vicissitude
had taken place ! Instead of servants at
command, and ready to gratify all his
childish caprices, he now found himself
reduced to an absolute menial state. The
footman who attended Richard to Eton,
unfortunately, had lived with a relation
of George M'Lean's, and entering into
conversation with that young gentle-
man, expressed the joy all the servants

felt at the prospect of his removal from
home ; and described him as a little ty-
rant, whom it was impossible for any
creature to love.
I merely mention this circumstance to
convince my young readers of the advan-
tages they. may derive even from conci.
liating the good opinion of those in the
most inferior stations of life; for the
manner in which Richard Rivington was
spoken of by his mother's servant was
soon circulated throughout the school;
and as first impressions are not easily era-
dicated, the few attachments he formed
at Eton may probably be attributed to
that cause.
The first interview that took place be-
tween Richard and his attached mother,
after their separation, certainly was of the
most affecting kind : those little hard-
ships which, at a public school, every
boy must submit to, were converted into
acts of cruelty, and Doctor H- was

harassed with the relation of a thousand
petty complaints. The character George
M'Lean had acquired, however, was not
to be. injured by the representations
of a petted boy, who, upon the departure
of his mother, was severely reprimanded
for having attempted to tarnish the
bright fame of so amiable a youth.
Unfortunately for
poor Richard,
MLean was made acquainted with the
account he had given his mother; and as
a tell-tale is generally considered a most
despicable creature, he was  scouted by all
the little boys in the school. His life
might now truly be called an uncomfort-
able one; for when from under the eye
of his tutor, MLean treated him with
a severity which it was disgraceful to ex-
ercise over a mere child; yet in their
presence he behaved to him with the af-
fectionate kindness of an elder brother,
and always voluntarily offered to assist
him in his tasks. By this specious mode

21
of conduct he imposed upon his diffe-
rent preceptors, and the complaints the
little hero of my story had alleged
against him were considered as proofs
of a wayward disposition or dissatisfied
turn of mind, for the masters were no
strangers to the weak fondness his mo-
ther had displayed.
Urged by the repeated complaints of
Mrs. Rivington, Colonel Clayton and
Mr. Sandford at length determined to
investigate into their cause, and for this
purpose drove one morning to Eton, re-
solving to have some private conversa-
tion with the head master. After apolo-
gizing to Doctor H-for taking the
liberty' of animadverting upon the con-
duct of any young gentleman under his
care, they frankly related several in-
stances of M'Lean's oppressive mode
of treating their little petted ward.
The Doctor not only listened to the
charge with great good-humour, but

offered to call M'Lean, to give him an
opportunity of acquitting himself; at
the same time declaring he was certain
there was not a word of truth in the re-
port Richard had made ;
For I assure
you, gentlemen, (said he) there is not a
-, boy in the whole college of a more gen-
tle and humane disposition than M.Lean;
but
you are well aware, that your ward
has been so completely indulged by his
mother, that the necessary form ob-
served in  public school must, to a
boy petted from his infancy, appear a
hardship."
Perfectly convinced by the Doctor's
description of M'Lean's disposition that
Richard had complained without any
just cause, Colonel C. and Mr. Sand-
ford informed his mother they should
scrupulously attend to the dying injunc-
tions of their friend, and continue their
ward at Eton, without attending to frivo-
lous complaints.--Had Colonel Clayton

23
or Mr. Sandfordenquired M Lean's cha-
racter from the boys instead of their
masters, they would have discovered
that Richard did not repine without suf-
ficient cause; for though he was allowed
to possess superior abilities, he was uni-
versally hated throughout the school,
and he had obtained the affection of his
superiors by subtilty, hypocrisy, and ad-
dress.
Again poor Richard was unfortunate;
for this petty tyrant accidentally became
acquainted with the purport of his guar..
dians' visit; and the dislike which he
had formerly felt was converted into an
antipathy, which he took every means in
his power of evincing. To the tutors
M'Lean represented him so mischiev-
ous and spiteful, during the hours of re-
creation, that he had lessons set him
which could not be completed in school-
hours; and when these were finished,
his tyrant (if I may use the expression)

never failed to employ him in the usual
drudgery of a fag, and, in fact, made
his life truly uncomfortable.
Though Richard, as I before observed,
did not possess conciliating manners, and
the account which Mrs. Rivington's man
had given of his behaviour at home had
prejudiced the servants, yet, out of
school hours, they could not help ob-
serving the manner in which M'Lean
treated him, and it frequently induced
them to assist him in performing those
orders he had scarcely sufficient strength
to fulfil. The boys likewise, actuated
by principle rather than affection, be-
gan to sympathize in the oppressive
treatment which, to their astonish-
ment, Richard appeared patiently to re-
ceive; for, having formed his plan of
conduct, he no longer openly murmured
at his situation, but patiently submitted
to his destiny.
My young readers may probably ima-

tale re-
gine that the little hero of
my
flected
upon the tyranny he had
usurped over his brothers and sister,
and considered the treatment he re-
ceived from M'Lean was a punish-
ment inflicted for his unkindness to
such near relations : but the patience
and forbearance he displayed pro-
ceeded, I am sorry to say, from a
very different cause ; for, instead of
MLean's unkindness exciting penitence
or remorse in his youthful bosom, it
only seemed to harden his heart.-
Whilst his mother gratified all his
childish whims and caprices, he evinced
towards her a mixture of tenderness
and regard ; but from the moment she
informed him he must remain at Eton,
he no longer treated her with marks of
affection or respect, and on the con-
trary, had the audacity to tell her he
was convinced she did not love him, or

she would not suffer' his guardians to
place him in a situation contrary to his
wishes. Of his guardians he spoke in
terms highly disrespectful: in short, it
was only fear that made him treat
them with external marks of respect.;
and they so repeatedly heard accounts
of his misconduct, that they heartily
regretted having had any thing to do
with him.

It is a well-known fact, that even lit-

greater latitude allowed them in their
play hours than those of double their
age are permitted to enjoy at a private

of all traffic, buying, and selling slaves.
Jack Gennings, even during the age of
childhood, had displayed a disposition
of the most daring kind; and at six
years of age was so headstrong and
overbearing, that his poor mother was
totally unable to conquer him ; and he
even paid no respect to his father's in-
junctions, unless they were enforced
with the rod or a stick. With this un-
principled boy Richard, unfortunately,
formed an acquaintance, about sixteen
months after his residence at Eton ;
and as he was nearly four years older
than the youthful hero of my narra-
tive, his opinions and advice were ob-
served by him as a law. He com-
menced his instructions by ridiculing

spirit, Master Rivington, (he would
ask) ever submitted to petticoat govern-
ment? Why, even in the Bible, from
the beginning of the creation, women
were all obliged to serve the men; and
if

had been into as many foreign
parts as I have, you'd see how mothers

Richard would represent the
many acts
of kindness he was continually receiving
from his mamma; but these marks of
filial affection gradually lessened by
bad erample and pernicious advice.

made in the most solemn manner, and
even the name of the great Creator of
the universe called upon, to prove the
sincerity of it. After this sacred en-
gagement the mind of Mrs. Rivington
became perfectly easy; convinced her
son would never dare, with impious
hardiness, to break through it.
The proposal, however, was no
sooner made by Gennings, than the
promise was no longer considered bind-
ing; and though it could not be ef-
faced from his memory, was resolved
to be broken through. " We must take
care to keep our plan quite secret,

(said Richard), for my mother made
me promise never to row upon the ri-
ver; and if she should discover our in-
tention, I am sure I shall not finger
the cash."" Promises and pie-crusts
are made to be broken, (exclaimed
Gennings) Master Richard ; and I
thought you had been a boy of too
much spirit to mind a promise ! -A pack
of nonsense, indeed ; never row upon
the river ! I wonder she is not afraid
of your being drowned in the basin you
wash
your
hands !"
This piece of wit completely silenced
the slight effort of conscience; and a
boy of the name of Heberdine having
observed that Richard would be rowed,
instead of rowing, the promise was al-
lowed not to be broken, but very judi-
ciously evaded; and the imprudent
boy, with ardour and exultation, readi-
ly embraced the proposed plan.

For seven shillings they were to be
furnished with a boat; another seven
was to be given the rower; the remain-
ing one pound eight was to be spent in
regaling their appetite, for the two gui-
neas were obtained without the least
: hesitation, upon Richard informing his
mother he wished to spend the next
day with his favourite, and make him
a present before he sailed.
Every thing seemed to conspire to
render the excursion pleasant; for a
nobleman, who the preceding evening
placed his only son under Doctor
H-'s immediate protection, had so-
licited a holiday, and M'Lean had
just been sent for express to Scotland,
to receive the last blessing of an expire
ing parent. The morning proved fine;
the river appeared smooth as a mirror,
and Richard had furnished a basket
with a cold chicken and some ham,

the day proved a favourable circum-
stance, for they caught a sufficient
nuinber to furnish a dish before two
o'clock; in addition to these, they or-
dered some veal cutlets and a currant
tart; and whilst these things were pre-
paring they amused themselves by
playing at skettles and trap-ball.
These athletic sports naturally made
the young party thirsty, which con-
sisted of six boys; the master of the
feast, Edward Mortimer, Charles He-
berdine, Frank Hartley, Jack Gen-
nings, and the son of a boat-builder,

who was permitted to become a sharer
of the entertainment at the intreaty
of Gennings. Pievious to dinner, they
had amongst them contrived to drink
three pots of
porter; and for the satis-
faction of appeariog lads of spirit, they
ordered a bottle of port, and a five
shilling bowl of punch.
Though the master of the inn, or
rather public-house, had frequently enter-
tained the young gentlemen of Eton,
and would not intentionally have of-
fended any party that made use of his
house, yet as he was a man of princi; le,
and the father of a large family, he in-
treated the party not to drink too
much; " For, young gentlemen (said.
he) you are but fresh water sailors,
and mayhap, if you drink too freely,
you may upset the boat."
" Fresh-water sailors, indeed !" ex-
claimed Jack Gennings;
.
" do you

call a man a fresh-water sailor who
has made three voyages to the coast
of Senegal? But I'd have you to know,
Mr. Prudence, that I am able to pilot
a man of war! and dash my buttons,
if our captain has not often given me
the command of his ship!"
This brayado-like assertion was made
by the young mariner with such an air
of assurance, that all his companions de-
clared they would sooner depend upon
his skill in navigation than any water-
man who had spent the greater part of
his life upon the Thames. The party
soon emptied the bottle of port, and
had nearly seen the bottom of the
bowl which had contained the punch,
when their noisy mirth was arrested by
a vivid flash of lightning. The beauty
of the day had began to overcast be-
fore dinner was placed upon the table,
and torrents of rain had fallen, with-

out exciting the slightest anmadver-
sion. The sudden illumination, how-
ever, suspended for a few moments
their noisy mirth ; and a pause ensu-
ing, the distant peals of thunder struck
their astonished ears.
Frank Hartley, who was neafly
eighteen months older than Richard,
instantly avowed a resolution of not
returning in the boat ; and looking
out of a window which faced the
water, declared he had never seen it so
violently agitated. The undaunted
Gennings ridiculed the pusillanimity
of this resolution. " What! strike
your colours to the enemy before
you are attacked, Master Hartley ?-
Why, you do not deserve to be called
an Englishman; for the worst you can
have to fear is a wet jacket.""I am no
coward," replied Frank, "I assure you,

afraid to venture out: but, to tell you
the truth, I think both you and your as-
sistant have drank rather too much to
be able to weather such a storm; and my
advice is, that we leave the boat until
to-morrow morning, and send for a
post-chaise to take us to Windsor."
"But I hope your advice won't be
followed, Master Hartley," rejoined
Gennings;

chaise; but if there is, dear Jack, do
not conceal it, for we had better be
found out than lose our lives."
"Danger !" repeated Jack, in an iro-
nical accent; "" why, you might as
well think there is danger in crossing
a gutter in Windsor street. Talk of
danger to me, who have rode safely upon
the billows when they rose mountains
high! I'll bring ye all safe into port,
I warrant you, or may I never again
mount the main-mast." This assurance
of perfect safety, united to the tone in
which it was uttered, satisfied the whole
party, except Hartley, who declared his
resolution of not returning home by the
boat unless the wind became calm ;
and his representation of the danger at
length induced his cousin Mortimer to
make a similar resolution.
The master of the inn, upon deliver-

ing the bill which had been called for,
offered to procure a careful rower for
his guests; assuring them, that as the
tide was not in their favour, they would
not reach Windsor until near ten :
"and besides, young gentlemen, (con-
tinued he) your pilot is, I fear, a little
top-heavy, and if any mishap should
befal you, only think of the sorrow it
would occasion your parents.
"Well done, Mr. Methodist Preacher!
(exclaimed Gennings, who had entered
the room unperceived by the landlord)
I'll make you my chaplain as soon as I
have a ship: and that you may not
forget from what situation you was
raised to that high office, you shall
preach your sermon upon a barrel
of gin." This improper jest was
much more, agreeable to the young
party than to the worthy landlord,
who justly observed, that if Gennings

was ever fortunate enough to be master
of a ship, he did not believe any chap-
lain would condescend to make a voy-
age with him : adding, that he seemed
to have too little sense of religion
for a man of any probity to associate
with.' And I am sorry to see young
gentlemen like the present party (con-
tinued he) keep company with a lad so
much beneath themselves." So saying,
he quitted the apartment, leaving the
crest-fallen Gennings not a little mor-
tified by the remark.
" An impudent puppy! I'll never
come into his house again;" (exclaimed
Richard, offended at the insult which
had been offered to his friend).
" Come, Hartley, the boat is ready,
and it does not rain a single drop:"-
" I do not like the thought of going

" Oh, they intend spending the

Gennings) -I only wish I had him

peccavi, and teach him to keep his
tongue silent too :--but come along,

gaged a waterman to follow them;
feeling a presentiment some accident
would occur. Having informed Hart-
ley and Mortimer the stages did not al-
way's pass his door, but sometimes
made a slight deviation, they resolved
to accompany the waterman, who was
sent as a protector to their friends.
Though to overtake the boat was not
trieir intention, (for the landlord re-
quested them merely to keep it in view)
yet this they could have done without
any exertion, as Gennings rowed in a per,
fect zig-zag, and sometimes evidently
grounded it, as they perceived two or
three. hands were exerted to get it into
the stream again.: When within about
two miles of Wndsor, the shades of
evening overspread the horizon; the
wind began to rise, and a misty rain
descended, which in a great measure
obscured the object they had in view.

We had better hail them now,
Masters, (said the boatman) and they
get into our, or we into their boat;' for
I am sure and satin some mishap will
befal them, or my name is not John
Sparks." The two boys approving the
proposal, Sparks instantly exclaimed,
Young gemmen, here be two of your
companions alongside; they be comed
from the White Hart, and if you'll
come in tow with us, we'll take you into
this here boat, for the night is mortal
dark, and you may run foul of some of
the colliers, and get a ducking before
you're aware on't."
" You had better keep aloof, old
Neptune, (exclaimed Gennings) with
your two pigeon-hearted companions, or
I'll give you all a ducking with my oars,
or, at best, a good splashing; so keep
your distance, if you wish us to be
friends."

Sparks made no reply to this imper-
tinent piece of advice; but, resting his
oars a few minutes, suffered them to
gain ground, Hartley and Mortimer
were animadverting upon the impro-
per conduct of Gennings, when their
ears were shocked by reiteratedshrieks,

was vociferated from voices apparently
emerging out of the deep. Every sen-
timent of resentment was instantly for-
gotten : the humane waterman rowed
forward with all his might; the deck
of a collier lying in the river was sud-
denly illuminated, and they distinctly
perceived the boat upset. Rivington
and Heberdine were clinging to the edge
of it, and in the most piteous accents im-
plored assistance. Honest Sparks in-
stantly caught the latter by the collar,
and dragged him into the boat, whilst
the same humane action was performed

under the upset vessel ; and, aided by
the assistance of two men belonging to
the collier, replaced it in its former si-
tuation ; but, alas ! neither Gennings
or his friend appeared. "They be
sucked under the barge, and the Lord
have mercy upon them !" (exclaimed
Sparks, whilst thetear of commiseration
stood trembling in his eye.)"Buthave
you no net? For God's sake, let us try
to save them,' 'for, young as they are,
they are not fit to die."
"The net!

moment !" was vociferated from several

voices: the latter was produced the
instant it was called for, and Sparks
seized it out of a waterman's hand.
"I have something here!" (he' ex-
claimed, drawing the apparently lifeless
Gennings out of the water, and desir-
ing one of the by-standers to hold him
up by the heels. At that instant the
boat-builder's son rose froin the wa-
tery element, and was instantly caught
by the hair of his head; some rowed
on shore to fetch a surgeon, whilst
others were employed in rubbing the
two apparently lifeless bodies.
Near ten minutes elapsed before any
signs of life were visible, either in Gen-
nings or 'his friend; but at length to
the great joy of the spectators,' it was
then evident' neither were dead. A
violent heaving of the stomach was
succeeded by a copious discharge of

that moment a surgeon arrived, and
taking out his lancet, prepared to let
Gennings blood; but upon cutting off
the jacket, perceived his right arm was
broken. " This (said the Doctor) must
be a secondary consideration." Then
tying up the left arm, he opened a
vein, and afterwards performed a simi-
lar operation on the other lad. Ri-
vington and Heberdine, providentially,
had received no other injury than that
which might arise from terror and a
wet jacket, and refused following the
surgeon's council, who advised them to
lose a little blood.
The groans of Gennings, as sense
and feeling were restored to him, were
truly horrible; which, added to his
swollen features, rendered him a piti-
able spectacle. . The accident had, for-
tunately, happened near a public-
house, where all the sufferers were pro-

dertook the painful office of making
their friends acquainted with what had
happened.
Mrs. Rivington had accidentally
heard in what manner her son was
passing the day; and between the op-
posite emotions of fear and displea--
sure, was in the most pitiable state of
mind. " Where is my Richard ! where
is my child !" she exclaimed in a voice
of terror, upon seeing Hartley and the
honest Sparkes enter the room without
him.-"Safe, thank God!" replied the
humane waterman; " and saved, I
may say, by a miracle; but God Al-
nighty is all sufficient, and I bless his
goodness that made me an instrument
in his hands." "You! (rejoined the
delighted mother.) Did you save my
darling boy ?". Then rushing impetu-
ously forward, she hugged the old man

round the neck; called him the pre-
server of her own existence, and ut-
tered ten thousand, thousand thanks.
The gratitude of the enraptured
Mrs. Rivington was not confined to
mere expression; for opening the drawer
of her writing-desk, she took out
two fifteen pound notes; and though
Sparkes repeatedly refused receiving any
reward for what he termed an act of
duty, she assured him it was only a pre-
lude to her future intentions towards
him." !
The carriage was ordered to be got
ready with the utmost quickness,, and
in the space of half an hour she arrived
at the public-house, accompanied by
the humane preserver of the life of her
son.,
Not one reproving word passed

planet (exclaimed his poor mother), for
this is the third narrow escape he has
had! He fell from the top of 'Squire
Darnley's high pear-tree one night,

melting lead in a shovel, it ran all over

expect."
Aye, Dame, when roses grow upon
nettles, and woodbines upon brambles

may expect to find comfort from Jack;
howsomedever, we must go and see
after him, for, as you say, he is our own
flesh and blood. The worthy parents of
that worthless boy, after thanking the
young gentlemen for the trouble they
had taken, trudged off together to vi-
sit their tortured son, whose groans
they heard long before they reached
the chamber, as the surgeon had just
set his arm. The next morning he was
visited by his honourable acquaintance,
who obtained his mother's permission to
have the carriage for the purpose of

knowing whether the surgeon thought
Jack sufficiently well to be conveyed
home in it. Providentially, no greater
degree of fever attended the accident,
than that which might have been ex-
pected from the pain which he en-
dured; and as the surgeon had several
patients in Windsor, he consented to
visit him at his father's house. Pile
lows were accordingly put into the
carriage, and the anxious Mrs. Gen-
nings supported her son in her arms.
The coachman was ordered to drive
with the greatest gentleness; yet poor
Jack suffered the most hcute pain,
which he endured with so little forti-
tude, that he actually shrieked at the
slightest jolt the carriage made.
Jack Gennings, under bodily suffer-
ing, was the same hardened character
as in the hours of health and ease; and :

gate his anguish, or endow him with
fortitude to bear the pain; he was
never heard to offer up a petition to
his Maker, or to return him thanks for
the miraculous manner in which his
life had been preserved. Even his
friend Rivington was shocked at his
want of gratitude and religion; but as
the accident had happened from Jack's
wish of affording him pleasure, he vi-
sited him daily, and paid him as much
attention as if he had been the nearest
and dearest relation. As the health of
this wicked boy improved, his natural
cheerfulness returned with it; and
Richard found his company so com-
pletely entertaining, that the greater
number of hours which were devoted
to recreation were passed with the
carpenter's son.
Letters arrived from M'Lean's
friends, to inform the head master he

tion, which was joyful intelligence to
Richard, who, as has been observed,
had completely formed his plan of ac-
tion. This plan my young readers
doubtless expected to have been made
acquainted with at the close of the Se,
cond Chapter, but it was necessary to
let them know the circumstance which
gave rise to the very great intimacy
which subsisted between a young gen-
tleman like Master Rivington and a
carpenter's son.
Gennings, during the daily visits
Richard made him whilst confined by
the accident, constantly amused him
with some entertaining tale respecting
the inhabitants of the different coun-
tries h had visited, and embellished
these tales with a variety of falsehoods.
After Richard had listened to the mar-
cellous circumstances which were re.
lated, he would frequently exclaim,

"Oh, how I should like to be a sailor!"
What would I give, Jack, would
my mother consent to my going the
next voyage with you!" Jack artfully
took every means in his power to in-
crease his young friend's desire of what
he termed seeing the world. Gold, he
assured him, might be picked up in
Africa with as much ease as dirt; and
that a sailor's life was one continued
scene of mirth, frolic, and fun.
r. Would I, Master Rivington (he
would say to the credulous Richard),
do you think, submit to be treated in
the manner you are, if I was a young
gentleman? No, I would soon shew
them the difference, I warrant you.--
A fag, indeed, to that tyrannical beg-
gar! for I hear you could buy all
M'Lean's family: and as to your mo-
ther, she ought to be ashamed of her-
self;--in truth, all Windsor cry shame
of her!
## p. 59 (#69) ##############################################
RICHARD THE RUNAWAY.
59
To the last observation Richard, at
first, brought a thousand instances to
prove his mother's kindness and affec-
tion. " All a trick ! (he would ex-
claim) my dear young gentleman, to
impose upon you. No, no-she has no
more affection for you than I have for
a negro; and I am sure you are treated
like one by that vile dog M'Lean."
Remarks like these, in time pro-
duced the effect Gennings expected ;
and Richard gradually lost every filial
sentiment, and considered his mother
as a selfish creature, wh actually
wished for his death. "She wants you
to fret yourself into a consumption,
Master Rivington, that she and your
worthless guardians may enjoy your for
tune; but I'd give them the slip, if I
was you, and not return to England
till I was old enough to fight my own
battles, and make them give an account:

of every farthing my father left me;
and this is what I advise you to do."
This pernicious advice the ill-fated
boy resolved to follow; but as money
was necessary to put the scheme in
practice, he submitted to the drudgery
of a fag more patiently than he other-
wise would have done, until he had, as
Gennings termed it, well feathered his
nest. The accident Richard's wickedad-
viser had met with prevented him from
accompanying his master in the fourth
voyage; and by feigning sickness when
the ship returned England he avoided
it another time. During all these
months Richard was hoarding up
every farthing he could collect toge-
captain for his passage, and purchasing
those articles which would be most
likely to prove lucrative to himself and
friend; for that they were to be sharers

in the profit of them was a settled
thing
Not a week elapsed, from the time
that Richard had resolved to follow the
fortune of his abandoned associate,
that he did not make some plausible
pretence for obtaining money from his
attached parent. Sometimes he in-
formed her the boys at Doctor H~'s
had presented all the servants with
half-a-guinea. .At others, a collection
had been made for a poor distressed
family. Again, he would invent a
falsehood, and declare he had lost a
gold seal, with the initials of his
name engraven upon it; and solicit
money to procure another, and then
produced the one which he had given
to Gennings to keep for him, who took
care, before it was shewn Mrs. Ri-
vington, to clean it thoroughly with
soft soap and whitening. By this de-

ceptive mode of conduct, united to the
generous allowance his mother made
him, in the course of fifteen months,
Richard had amassed together the asto-
nishing sum of sixty-five pounds.
As Captain Brownlove's friends
(which was the name of the person to
whom Jack Gennings was apprenticed)

sor, he regularly paid them a visit
when he returned from each voyage,
and Jack received a summons to meet

faculties of Gennings : yet, as the late
ter had intreated him not to make his
father and mother acquainted with
Master Rivington's intentions, their
plan was conducted with the greatest
secrecy, which, perhaps, was in some
measure occasioned by that young gen-
tleman readily consenting to advance
the money agreed upon,
for his
passage.
About two days previous to the time
fixed upon for Richard's elopement
from the sheltering arms of a' fond
mother, that mother, at the pressing
solicitation of a friend, who had passed
some time at Windsor, consented to
accompany her into Oxfordshire;
though not until she had received an
assurance from the ungrateful Richard
that he should not be unhappy by a

as if this fond parent had a presenti-
ment of the misery which awaited her;

for when the moment of separation ar-
rived, she was scarcely able to fulfil
her promise, or bid adieu to her dar-
ling child.
Remorse for the pangs he was go-
ing to inflict on the being who doated
upon him with such an excess of fond-
ness, made Richard not an unaffected
spectator of her grief, and as the car-
riage door closed, he exclaimed, "God
bless you, my dear mother !" and hur-
ried into the parlour to give free scope
to bis tears. Had any guardian angel in
the form of a friend arrived at that
moment, Richard, in the fulness of his
heart, would have disclosed his designs,
for the force of natural affection was
then struggling against pernicious
council, and he emphatically exclaim-
ed, "I never can bear to leave my
mother! for I never thought she loved?

brothers and sister wept around him,
each lamenting the absence of their
dear mamma, though with much less
reason than the being who was medi-
tating the destruction of her happiness.
Instead of a guardian angel, how-
ever, the fiend Gennings presented
himself, who had been watching the
departure of the carriage, and by the
united force of raillery and persuasion
soon banished the impression of natu-,
ral affection from his breast. Gen-
nings, who was a very expert penman,
proposed writing a note to Doctor
H-in Mrs. Rivington's name, re-
questing that her son might on the fol-
lowing evening, be sent to London
.by the Windsor stage. To this hold
stroke Richard at first objected, as the
original plan had been to run away at
an early hour; but Gennings having

made it clear that detection was impos-
sible, the note was given to one of the
servants as by Mrs. Rivington's com-
mand; and the hand being imitated
to the greatest exactness, the doctor
did not make the slightest hesitation
at complying with the contents, and
one of his own servants accompanied
the ingrate to the stage.
Gennings and the strong box (for
he was Richard's steward) were already
at the inn, and nothing particular oc-
curred until their arrival in London,
when they took a hackney-coach, and
drove with their treasures down to the
ship, where the captain was ready to
receive them, and gave the runaway a
very cordial reception. The next morn-
ing the two friends went on shore, ac-
companied by the captain, for the pur-
pose of buying those articles of mer

that her name had not been misapplied;
for though she did not hoist a greater
number of sails, and was equally heavy
laden, in the course of a few days she
left them completely behind.
Before I describe the circumstances
which occurred from this rapid progress;
I shall pause to reflect upon the vari-
ous sensations which must have occu-
pied my youthful adventurer's mind;
who at a period of life when most re-
quiring a skilful pilot to conduct him,
he had incautiously launched into the
great deep, without a helm to guide, or
compass to steer against the shoals
and quicksands he was certain to meet
with in; his voyage. Or, in other
words, not to make use of metaphors,
or nautical expressions, he had quit-
ted the asylum a fond mother had
prepared for him, and renounced the
protecting aid of friends ; and though

little more than in his teens, had be-
came an adventurer; renouncing all
the dear ties of nature, and going in
pursuit of a shadow when the sub-
stance was within his reach. -
Even the pernicious council of the
unprincipled Gennings could not
completely harden the roving Richard's
heart; and though he had suffered
himself to be duped by false misrepre-
sentation, yet, for the two first days,
he frequently retired to his little cabin
(or rather birth) for the purpose of
concealing those tears which he found
it impossible to restrain, when he re-
flected upon the excruciating pangs he
had inflicted upon his attached parent.
The original author of these pangs,
however, suspecting the cause of his
friend's retirement, resolved to rally
him out of a dejection which might
prove abortive to his designs; and

succeeded so well, that in the course of
a few days, England and all its dear
connections were forgotten !
That dreadful sickness which usual-
ly attends young mariners might,
perhaps, have recalled them to Ri-
chard's recollection; but, to the asto-
nishment of the whole ship's company,
he never felt it; and from this circum-
stance it was declared he was not only
destined to be a sailor, but to make a
fortune by an element so favourable to
him. To the luxury of wine, Richard
bad been accustomed from his very
childhood; and, without being affected
by it, could drink a larger potion than
any boy of his age ; and he now found
he could take his glass of grog with
the oldest seaman in the service; and
instead of being stupified by it, found
his spirits raised :-in short, he was
considered as the life of the whole

company; he told many humorous
stories, and sang several excellent songs;
he could likewise play back-gammon,
and in this joyous manner passed the
first ten days.
The wind and weather had hitherto
been perfectly favourable; and as the
captain might be said to have two
strings to his bow, he had, to oblige a
particular friend, engaged to deliver
some title deeds in person to a gentle-
man, who was lieutenant of a regiment
at Gibraltar. This commission he ful-
filled with the greatest punctuality,
and received a variety of attentions
from the gentleman with whom he had
business to transact, and who was so
pleased with the sprightly conversation
and gentlemanlike manners of young
Rivington, that he pressed him to re-
main his guest until the ship had dis-
embarked her cargo, and made those

purchases on the coast of Africa, for
which she had made the voyage. Gib-,
raltar presented a tlrousand charmis to
a mind like that of the youthful hero
of my story, independent of the no-
velty of the scene; for a fortified town
inspired him with a thirst of military
glory, and his new acquaintance en-
couraged this enthusiastic turn of
mind.
Richard had been introduced to this
gentleman (whose name was Eliott) as
a youth whose desire of seeing the
world had induced him to place him-
self under Captain Brownlow's protec-
tion; not as a rambling Runaway,
who, from pernicious advice, and a de-
sire of freeing himself from restraint
and authority, had quitted the foster-
ing arms of an attached mother. Far
different would have been the recep-
tion Mr. Eliott would have given him

had he known the real motives which
influenced Richard's voyage, for he then
would have forcibly detained him, un-
til he found a proper opportunity of
returning him to his friends.
Gennings, who, from being merely
an apprentice to Captain Brownlow,
could not be introduced into Mr.
Eliott's family, heard the account of
his young friend's having been invited
to remain at Gibraltar with fear and
dismay, as all hopes of sharing in the
profits of the merchandize would then
have been totally destroyed. To add
to his apprehension, Richard seemed
inclined to embrac Lieutenant Eliott's
proposal, for the duty of a garrison af-
forded, him delight, and the Captain,
who had been paid for his voyage, left
hiin at perfect liberty to consult his in-
clination.

"No, no, my dear Jack, I am not
so ungrateful as you imagine," replied
Richard; "I never will forsake you
whilst I live; and as long as I have a.
shilling, you shall share it, that
shall, my dear, dear Jack." As Richard
made this declaration of uninterested
friendship, he threw his arms round
the artful Gennings's neck, and min-
gled tears of sincerity and affection,
with those of hypocrisy and artifice.

my young readers against forming

Jack Gennings, from the moment of
his acquaintance with the ill-fated
Richard, was a regular train of fraud
and deception, and had that poor boy
been a few years older, he must have
perceived that he was guided by self-
interest, and a desire of rendering his
new associate as wicked as himself.
Gennings having thus artfully worked
upon the feelings of the too credulous
Richard, felt no longer alarmed at the
idea of a dissolution of friendship, if
such a term can be applicable to a
league formed upon the basis of self-
interest.
Immediately after the preceding
conversation, the young adventurer

informed Lieutenant Eliott that he
should decline his friendly invitation ;
for as he had quitted England for the
sole purpose of visiting the African
settlements, he should be laughed at
if he went no farther than Gibraltar.
"Well, Christopher Curious," (a name
which Mr. Eliott had jocosely given
him) he replied, clapping him upon
the shoulder," I heartily wish you may
not have reason to repent extending
your travels ; but remember, if ever
you want the aid of a friend, or a com-
fortable asylum, my advice and my
house will both be at your service :-

the packet will sail in three days; and

banish the recollection of those dear
connexions you have left in Old Enga
land."
This was touching Richard upon a
tender chord, and one that conscience
would not allow him to reflect upon;
for, in spite of his endeavour to divest
himself of the anguish his mother was
suffering, her image would frequently
force itself upon his thoughts, and his
heart told him he was a little ingrate,
wholly undeserving such a fond mother.
To the information Lieutenant Eliott
had given him respecting the sailing of
the packet, he made such an em-
barrassed reply, as gave that gentleinan
reason to imagine he had quitted Eng-
land without the knowledge of his fa-
mily; and having accidentally, in the
course of conversation, discovered Mrs.
Rivington resided at Windsor, he
wrote to a friend who lived in the

contrary way;
"and if every cap-full
of wind is to detain us, (he added) we
shall lose the best of the market.
The word of a commander on board
a ship, is as irrevocable as the laws of the
Medes and Persians; the mate, there-
fore, did not make use of remonstrance,
but set about his duty with the utmost
alacrity, very judiciously preparing for
the difficulties 'he was destined to en-
counter. The clouds, which had long
been gathering, soon burst over theves-
sel; the varying winds seemed as if they
were attracted into a point, and that
the Speedwell was the focus which
allured them; for it was scarcely pos-
sible to determine which predomi-
nated.
Though the captain did not chuse
to acknowledge his error, yet it was'evi-
dent that he considered the mate's
judgment superior to his own; for he

ordered every sailor on board the ves-
sel implicitly to obey Mr. Fowler's
commands. The main and mizen-
masts were lowered ; every part of the
rigging tightened, and each man or-
dered to his separate post; but, alas!
human precaution avails little, when
put in competition with the warring
elements.
The ship was one minute elevated
to the height of a mountain, then as
suddenly descended into the briny
deep: each man was obliged to be
lashed to the post allotted him, to pre-
vent him from being washed away by
the waves. The cracking of the beams,
and the whirling sound produced by
the canvas,struck terror upon the af-
frighted Richard's mind, who, at the
commencement of the storm, had slunk
into his hammock, overpowered with
1 death-like sickness. - There he lay

without a friend to solace him, the
companion of his own penitential reflec-
tions; all the tenderness he had re-
ceived from his mother then rushed
upon his recollection, and he repeated-
ly exclaimed, " Lord be merciful to
me, an undutiful, an ungrateful wretch!"
Instead of wishing for the society of
Gennings to console him, he felt happy
that the ship's duty prevented him
from approaching his birth; for he
then considered him as the source of
all his troubles, and the being who had
banished every virtuous impression
from his heart.
When he heard the sailors chopping
away the masts to save the vessel from
upsetting, he thought it was dashing
to pieces upon a rock, and committing
his trembling soul to the mercy of his
Creator, terror threw his body into a
swoon. How long he remained in this

situation is uncertain; but he was
roused to recollection by the captain's
voice, calling upon his name in a
tone of authority, and demanding why
he lay hulking in his nest, when he
might be of some use? With scarce
sufficient strength to crawl, he descend-

penetrable overspread the horizon,
which in the course of half an hour
was illuinated by vivid flashes of
lightning, that served to make their
situation appear the more horrible, for
the retiring waves presented both shoals
and precipices, which were almost in-
stantaneously covered by the waves
which broke over them in their re-
turning course.
All was noise, terror, and confusion;
for the sailors, aware that the captain's
obstinacy had brought them into this
perilous situation, paid not the slightest
attention to his commands; though
this total want of subordination had, in
some measure, been occasioned by their
having had free ingress into the stew-
ard's apartment, where they had swal-
lowed such a large quantity of liquor,
that they were unfit to perform their
allotted tasks.

It was in vain that Mr. Fowler,
(which was the name of the officer who
had advised the captain not to quit the
Straits) implored them to act like men
and Christians, and endeavour to pre-
serve the vessel from the fury of the
waves; for they declared, that as Brown-
low, as they termed him, had madly
endangered their existence, they would
not make the slightest effort to pre-
serve his life, and thus, from the mad
principle of revenge, inspired by the aid
of liquor, they hastened the dreadful
catastrophe, which might probably
been avoided. Rivington, Gennings,
the boatswain, and two lads who had
never been at sea before, were the only
persons who aided the captain and mate
in their exertions to save the ship; for
the sailors were so completely intoxi-
cated, that after they had vented their
imprecations against their commander,

they lay rolling about like pigs, and
two had been washed overboard by
the violence of the surge.
As daylight appeared, they found
their situation, if possible, more dread-
ful than they had apprehended ; for
danger presented itself on every side;
they were perfectly out of their lati-
tude, and one of the sailors, in a fit of
phrenzy, had thrown all the captain's
mathematical instruments into the sea,
declaring they could not be of any use
to a blockhead, who would quit a safe
birth in the very teeth of an approach-
ing storm. As the vessel had for some
time defied the power of direction, it
was thought prudent to lighten her of
all her heavy stores, and to let her ride
upon the billows, conceiving that the
only means of preventing her from
driving upon the rocks.
This measure was accordingly adopt-

ed; but Rivington's cargo yet escaped,
or at least that part of it, which con-
tained tinsel, beadspocket looking-
glasses, and knives ; 'articles which the
Africans are very fond of, and for
which they will exchange gold-dust
to ten times the value of each. He
had likewise purchased a chest of saws,
hatchets, and a variety of mechanical
instruments, which are also held in
high estimation by the African chiefs ;
but these, as being very weighty, were,
with the greater part of the cargo,
thrown overboard. About three o'clock
in the afternoon the storm visibly
abated, and as the sailors had in great
measure slept off the effect of the li-
quor, they returned to a sense of their
duty; apologized to their captain for
their improper behaviour, implored Hea-
ven to pardon their past sins, resolving
not to touch another drop of liquor,

but to use their utmost exertions to
preserve the ship. Richard, who was
completely exhausted by bodily labour,
readily resigned his post at the pump
to a man named Frank Bowling, and
again retiring to his hammock, ex-
pected every moment would be his
last; for though the violence of the
storm was abated, the ship rode at the
mercy of the waves.
As night p-
proached, the winds again collected';
the surge mounted to an increased
height, and every sailor upon deck
was obliged to be lashed to his station,
to prevent him from being washed
overboard.
What a night was this for the wretch-

they were unable to utter a prayer.-
Near six-and-thirty hours had elapsed,
since the captain or Mr. Fowler had
taken any nourishment, except a small
piece of biscuit and a little
grog ;
but
about six o'clock in the morning the
latter felt himself completely exhausted,
and proposed having the kettle put on,
for the purpose of refreshing them-
selves with tea and some slices of cold
beef: to this proposal the captain ac-
ceded, but the ship rolled with so much
violence, they could neither make use
of cups nor saucers; and having
thrown a handful of tea into the tea-
kettle, they alternately drank a portion
of it out of a little black jack: this be-
verage having refreshed the captain,
he seemed suddenly to recollect the
helpless being who had placed himself
under his protection; and vociferat-

chard made his appearance more dead
than alive.
" This, perhaps, is the last meal we
shall ever swallow together, young
gentleman," said he, giving Richard
the black jack, and a piece of cold heef;
and God'forgive me for having taken
you on board my ship; for instead of
so doing, I ought to have taken you
to your poor mother, who, perhaps,
may be pining with grief for your loss."
Richard, who had passed the whole
night in deploring his undutiful con-
duct, at the sound of his mother's
name burst into a flood of tears. "Who
knows (replied he)
but this storm is
a judgment of Heaven for
my undutiful
conduct!"
"If I thought so," rejoined the
captain, addressing himself to Mr.
Fowler, "I would treat him as the
sailors of the * Tarshish vessel did

dreadful tempest has befallen us, on
account of his undutiful conduct to

poor
mother." " No, no, (rejoined
the mate) " we will not endeavour to
preserve our own existence by robbing
a fellow-creature of his; but I must
say, captain, you were very blameable
to take that young chap aboard, if you
knew, (as I fear you did,) he was,

Scarcely hd Mr. Fowler made this
observation, when the vessel received
such a violent shock, that he was drie

this judgment had come upon them for his disobedi-
ence, implored the mariners to cast him into the sea,

the river, in a still more miraculous
one, snatched him from the engulphing
waves !By the sudden dash upon the
rock the port-holes were forced open,
and through the apertures Mr. Fowler,
the boatswain's boy, and Richard,
were forced into the sea; the former
of whom, was an excellent swimmer,
and catching the latter by the skirts of
his jacket, supported him upon the sur-
face of the waves; for though he could
swim, he had been stunned by a blow
against the hatchway, and was totally
insensible.
Though daylight was scarcely clear,
yet land was perceptible within the dis-
tance of a quarter of a mile; and
though the retiring waves threw the
mate, and the burden which retarded
his progress, several times back from
it, yet, after much labour and exer.
tion, they reached the wished-for goal,

and found the boatswain's boy embrac-
ing the earth with ecstacy, and return-
ing thanks for his deliverance to a pro-
tecting God.
Mr. Fowler's heart was not less
grateful; but observing the being he
had preserved remained insensible,
his first attention was devoted to his
recovery, and his exertions were hap-
pily crowned with success; for though
he had no cordials to administer to him,
he fortunately had a lance t in his
breeches pocket, and having learnt the
art of phlebotomy, he opened a vein in
the arm, and in the space of five mi-
nutes had the happiness of seeing the
object of his solicitude
open
his
eyes.-
"Where am I? Where is my mother?"
enquired the resuscitated Richard, in a
feeble tone of voice; as soon as the or-
gan of speech was restored to him, he
gazed upon his surviving companions
with a vacant stare,

" Heaven only knows where we are,"
replied the friendly mate to his inter-
rogations; " but that we are miracu-
lously preserved is a certainty ; so let
us return thanks to that great Power,
who has so mercifully delivered us from
the jaws of death and the devouring
waves!"-So saying, he fell upon his
knees, and in the most fervent accents
returned thanks to the Almighty for
his miraculous escape, in which he was
joined by the boy and Richard, though
the latter felt himself too much ex-
hausted to rise.
Having performed this act of grati-
tude and devotion, Mr. Fowler left the
exhausted Richard to the care of the
boatswain's boy; and as a distant part
of the little island to which they had
escaped appeared to be elevated, he

they were. Every step that carried
him beyond the sight of his forlorn
companions seemed to increase the
emotion of fear, for he was no stranger
to the barbarous customs which pre-
vailed in those islands, and he was in
momentary expectation of either los-
ing his liberty or life. He had in his
waistcoat pockets, however, a brae of
very small pistols, with a small quan-
tity of powder in a horn, not larger
than a Snuff-box, which, though every
part of his clothing was dripping, for-
tunately remained perfectly dry. The
sea-water which he had unwillingly
swallowed when first plunged into the
briny element, united to the fatigue he
had gone through, excited the most
excessive thirst, and he eagerly ex-
plored every nook and crevice, in the
hope of finding a spring to allay his
drought. He proceeded near half a

mile over a kind of barren common,
totally uncultivated, and presenting a
dreary view; when, ascending that
eminence which had attracted his at-
tention, he perceived a most gratifying
prospect on the other side, for, to a
man parching with thirst, and exhaust-
ed by exertion, what could be more de-
lightful than to behold the most deli-
cious melons growing wild. He de-
scended with inconceivable rapidity,
seized the golden harvest, and found
his strength revived; then taking an
eager survey of the surrounding coun-
try, he endeavoured to discover on
what part of the world he had been so
miraculously thrown,
The rain continued to fall; the wind
still blew with violence; and there was

guished a range of mountains, some
leagues distant from him, but knew
not whether they were the Sierra
Leona, Mount Atlas, or the Mountain
of the Moon : as he had no polar star
to guide him, and was upon a spot
wholly unknown, he concluded he was
upon one of those islands which the
African pirates frequent for the pur-
pose of taking in fresh water, when in
pursuit of their prizes. That it was
not inhabited was evident, as he ex-
plored it for near three hours without
discovering the slightest marks of po-
pulation ; but upon returning to his
companions, he made a slight circuit,
and as he approached the shore, disco-
vered a kind of cave, which labour
had evidently hollowed, and which
the sea, at high tide, approached with-
in the distance of a few yards. With
a heart palpitating between fear and

pleasure he slowly entered the solitary
abode, blessing Heaven for conducting
him to a habitation which might shield
him from the inclemency of the wea-
ther, yet dreading lest some of the pi-
rates, who evidently took shelter in it,
should rob him of that liberty which
was dear to him as life.
Having slightly surveyed the pre-
mises, he resolved not to penetrate to
the end of this subterraneous mansion
without his companions' aid ; and, la-
den with five or six beautiful melons,
he hastened to the spot where he had
left the two boys. Richard embraced
his friend and preserver with tears of
joy; and the boatswain's boy (whose
name was Mason) met him likewise
with open arms, as from the length of
his absence these poor fellows had
imagined the protector, they looked up
to, hail been devoured by wild beasts,

or that the savage race whom Mason
had been informed infested that coun-
try, had either made him captive, or
destroyed his existence.
Never did the rising moon present
an object more pleasing to the sight of
a benighted traveller, than were the
view of these melons to the eyes of these
poor parched boys, whose thirst was so
excessive that they had been obliged to
masticate the
grass, and though the
flavour was extremely unpleasant, yet
a. small quantity of juice was pressed
out of it, which moistened their dry
mouths. Having regaled themselves
with this delicious fruit, which in that
part of the universe acquires a greater
degree of perfection than an English
palate can conceive, they found their
strength and spirits renovated, and
readily followed Mr. Fowler into the
cave.

That many days had not elapsed
since it had been the abode of pirates
was discernible from some ashes, over
which a kind of caldron hung, not
being completely cold, and near the
spot were two pieces of wood fixed
upon a kind of spindle, which, by turn-
ing with great rapidity, produced
sparks. With this method of producing
fire the mate was perfectly acquainted;
and penetrating farther into the cave,
he discovered a store of dried wood,
and from being no longer exposed to
the air, or taking actual exercise, he
began to feel the effect of his wet.

to be done was to benefit by what ap-
peared the boon of Heaven; they
lighted a fire, and might truly be said-
to enjoy warmth, for they all were seized
with a sudden shivering, and the me-
lons which had refreshed them for a

moment felt like ice in their stomachs.
This coldness was succeeded by the
most excruciating torture; and poor
Richard, who suffered much more
keenly than Mason, imagined all his
sorrows were going to end : in vain
did Mr. Fowler apply heat to his body,
for the pain, instead of abating, seemed
to augment.
" As the pirates, Sir, have surely
made this place their habitation, (said
Mason) who knows but they may have
ieft some provisions? If I light a piece
of wood, I shall at least be able to see
whether there is any thing that can do
Master Rivington good." From the
gloominess of the abode, Mr. Fowler
had imagined it did not extend farther
than twenty yards , but when Mason
had explored that distance, he found a
small aperture, which compelled him
to stoop before he could pass, and

having done so, to his utter astonish-
ment he beheld a spacious apartment.
The first thing which caught his at-
tention was the skin of an animal
about the size of a fox, dried and
formed into a bottle, filled with spirits.
At this welcome sight a shout of joy
burst from him, and he ran towards
the suffering Richard with the prize in
his arms, exclaiming,
" Here comes
the doctor, Sir, who says you must
take a large draught !"
Mr. Fowler eagerly seized the medi-
cine (as Mason termed it), and having
tasted a small quantity, found it excel-
lent; then holding the bottle to the
lips' of his suffering companion, im-
plored him to drink a little. The cor-
dial acted as a charm upon
the
poor
fellow, but in a few minutes, he be-
came dreadfully sick, and providen-
tially relieved his stomach from the

load which had occasioned all his suf-
fering, and in less than an hour felt
perfectly restored to health.
Mr. Fowler, who had not quitted the
side of his patient, resolved to explore
the inner apartment as soon as he saw
him relieved, and examining every part
most minutely, discovered what at that
moment appeared more valuable than
all the treasures of the East; for in an
earthen vessel, hollowed within, some-
thing like a large wash-hand basin, he
discovered a quantity of oil, and a tube
was formed in the centre, for the
purpose of supporting the wick. By
the side of this curious lamp lay a large
bundle of twisted flax, evidently pre-
pared for wicks; and a little farther
he had the pleasure of finding a large
cake of wax.
Having had the good fortune to
make these discoveries, they flattered

themselves they might find something
to satisfy that hunger which they all
began to feel ; but in this hope they
were disappointed, though they found
two or three curious earthen utensils,
which had evidently been used for
cooking. Mr. Fowler was, fortunately
for his young companions, endowed
with the most exalted opinion of the
goodness of Providence; and when he
heard them repine under their misfor-
tunes, and express a dread of starving
with hunger, he rebuked them in the
strongest manner.
" Can you (said he) so soon forget
the miraculous manner in which Pro-
vidence has saved us? Are not we
the only creatures out of a whole ship's
crew, who have been preserved? And
was it not his directing hand which
conducted us to this sheltered spot?

Do you expect our great Creator will
shower down manna from heaven? or
do you think that the Almighty will
direct the ravens to bring us food ?
No:-Such miraculous instances,
though recorded in the sacred writ-
ings, are not to be looked for now:
God has, in a most merciful manner,
preserved our existence, and we must
endeavour to sustain it by our own ex-
ertions: the wind has fallen; the tide
is ebbing, and we will try if we can-
not procure some fish."
Struck with the force of the worthy
man's observations, the two boys ac-
knowledged their fault; and Richard,
in the fulness of his feelings, clasped
his hands together, exclaiming, "God
forgive us !" Though the devouring
waves had swallowed up all the ill-fated
Rivington's treasures, he had preserved

present situation, was doubly valua-
ble, and this was a watch, which had
been his respected father's, the chain
of which he had fortunately passed
through a button-hole, for Mr.
Fowler's had either been washed out of
his pocket, or had been left in the ca-
bin. By this useful noter of time, it
was half past three when the ship-
wrecked mariners quitted the cave in
the hope of finding something to satisfy
their appetites; and they had not pro-
ceeded an hundred yards from it, when
their eyes were gratified with the sight
of several turtles' eggs. These, in-
deed, were like manna dropped from
heaven, for they at once supplied the
place of meat and bread; but finding
their thirst return, without daring to
quench it by the melons, they resolved

once more to explore the land, con-
vinced a spring of fresh water must be
within a short distance of the cave, or
the pirates would not have selected it as
a place of retreat. Mr. Fowler, there-
fore, resolved to make an opposite cir-
cuit to that, which he had done be-
fore; when, to their unutterable joy,
they discovered a most delicious spring
within fifty paces of their destined
abode. The emotions of delight and
gratitude which they experienced
may be imagined, though the
language can but faintly express : Ri-
chard alternately blessed the Al-
mighty for his goodness, and kissed
the ground the water issued from, so
exquisite was the joy which he felt.

water. Upon retasting this acceptable
cordial, that gentleman declared it to
be a something between toddy * and
arrack, which confirmed him in the
opinion that cocoa-trees flourished in
the island.
Having returned' thanks to the
great Giver of all sustenance for the
unlooked-for support to their constitu-
tions, they began to reflect in what
manner they should secure themselves
against any nightly depredators.--
Though the part of the island on which
they had been thrown was not woody,
yet on the other side the eminence
which Mr. Fowler had ascended he had
observed that the whole country was
covered with trees, and that their

After mature deliberation, it was deter-
mined to remove a large quantity of
dry wood which they had found in the
inner apartment to the outside the
cave; and when darkness enveloped

knowing that beasts of

ceiving the two boys were much ex-
hausted, kindly declared his-resolution
of taking the first turn, promising to
rouse Mason at two o'clock.
Having loaded his pistols, and set fire
to the faggots, he for a short time
paced up and down near the entrance
of the cavern; but neither hearing or
-seeing any thing that was likely to
molest him, he stretched his body upon
the bare earth, and in spite of his mi-
serable situation, was just dropping
into a quiet slumber, when he was
roused by what he at first imagined to
be a human groan. Starting from his
reclining position, he seized the pistols
which he had laid by his side ;-the
groan, or rather howl, was not only
repeated but re-echoed, and he then
evidently discovered that it proceeded
from a lion, a tiger, or some other
least of prey, The terror produced by

the sound made him fancy it much
nearer than it really was ;-his hair
seemed to erect; every limb felt pal-
sied, and he was forced to sustain his
tottering frame some moments against
the wall of the cave. The terrific
sound was not only repeated, but evi.
dently drew nearer; when, committing
himself to the protection of Provi-
dence, he rushed out of the cave,
and
discharged the brace of pistols in the
open air. Reiterated yells or howls
was the instantaneous effect of this ju-
dicious action; and the enemies he
hisd so much reason to dread returned
to their covert : he therefore stirred
the decaying embers, added fresh fuel
to them, and reloaded his pistols. All
inclination to sleep had now vanished ;
his heart palpitated at every blast; and
even the shadow of his own person as
he walked backwards and forwards (as

reflected from the 'blaze) made him
start.
The hour was already passed when
he had promised to rouse Mason; but
not chusing to trust the watching to a
mere youth, he resolved to let both
sleep until day-light, and then take
his turn. Short-sighted mortals that we
are ! how should we know on what to
place reliance for our best concerted
plans frequently prove our bane; and
so it happened in the present instance,
as will soon be discovered.
That the island was not inhabited
by any of the savage hordes of Afri-
cans, which lead a kind of wandering
life along the coasts, the worthy mate
was persuaded, from the observations
he had made the preceding day; there-
fore, to guard against any attack from
the animal creation was all that struck
him as necessary. But, alas! the very

method he had adopted to preserve his
existence, was the means of depriving
him of that which he held as dear as
life. The island, it has been observed,
in which the shipwrecked mariners
had found shelter, was elevated above
the sea which surrounded it, and the
night being extremely calm, the blaze
was distinguishable at the distance of
several miles.
With anxious expectation Mr.
Fowler waited the approach of day-
light; and quitting the cave to exa-
mine whether he could discover any
rosy tints in the East, he distinctly
heard the dashing of oars at a short
distance, and his palpitating heart
leaped with joy; for the first idea
which struck him was, that some part
of the crew of the Speedwell had been
miraculously saved. He remained
transfixed to the spot, as a new

was realized, flight would be vain. The
vessel drew nearer human voices
were discoverable, but the sound froze
the vital blood in his veins ! for ac-
cents to him the most uncouth, and
voices the most in harmonious, saluted
his astonished ear! He paused a few
moments; then darting forward, he
rushed into the cave the very image
of despair !
Catching Rivington by the arm,
and shaking him with a kind of phren-
zied motion, he exclaimed, "Rouse,
sleeper! all our hopes of liberty are
lost! The pirates have discovered us;
and to become slaves to these barba-
rians we were preserved !". A com-
plete band had by this time entered,
who surrounded the helpless trio with
a mixture of exultation and delight:

he was unable to make any reply..
Though no more than five or six had
at first entered the cavern, they were
soon followed by five times that num-
ber, and amongst them was a man whose
appearance and different dress (parti-
cularly that of the turban) gave Mr.
Fowler reason to believe was their com-
mander. As he drew nearer, the mate
was confirmed in this opinion, for the
men who had first entered fell back
into two ranks, and as their chief

dies according to the Turkish * mode

attendants, convinced Mr. Fowler he
had certainly not fallen into the hands
of pirates, as he was well aware that
amongst a band of depredators little
external respect to persons was ob-
served. To this personage, (whom he
instantly conjectured to be a Turkish
bashaw) he desired his companjons, if
they valued their existence, to dis-
play the most profound marks of re-
spect ; and setting them the example,
he approached him with arm's elevated
and body bent; then kneeling with
profound humiliation, he saluted the
ground under his feet.
This mark of humiliation seemed to
please the mighty potentate, for he
spoke to one of his attendants in a con-
ciliating tone of voice, who instantly
stepped forward, and assisted the
cap-
tive to rise. The hero of niy tale
and his companion both followed the

mate's example, and the same form of
raising them from the earth was prac-
tised by two different persons.
As
Rivington's person had been bent as
he approached his qugust enslaver, he
had not appeared to pay any attention
to it; but when his form was erected,
and he beheld the expressive turn of
his countenance, he appeared to be
wonderfully struck.
As beauty in either sex is but a se-
condary consideration, and, in general,
can be of very little consequence to a
boy, I have avoided even mentioning
the personal attractions which Riving-
ton possessed; but as they evidently
made an impression upon the being who
was destined tohave his life and liberty
at disposal, I shall inform my young
readers, that a finer face, or a more
justly proportioned figure it was impossi-
ble for any boy to possess. His dark blue

eyes were shaded by long ebon lashes,
which gave them, at first view, an ap-
pearance of being black. His com-
plexion was naturally fair, but rather
sun-burnt, which actually proved an
improvement; and the colour in his
cheeks was so exquisitely beautiful, that
it would have been difficult for an art-
ist to do justice to it.--In short, his
features were all faultless, and his fi-
gure, as I before observed, not only
justly proportioned, but very finely
formed; and so much taller than the
generality of boys at his age, that
most people would have imagined he
was at least sixteen.
Such was the youth who had evi-
dently made a favourable impression
upon the principal personage who en-
tered the cavern, and who for some
moments gazed upon him with a mix-
ture of pleasure and surprise ; chea
extending his hand towards him, he

desired him to approach; which he
did, bowing most respectfully, and
then raising the bashaw's extended
hand to his lips.
At beholding this action, every
nerve in the mate's body trembled ; for
he apprehended some instant token of
offended greatness would be displayed,
well knowing that the religious preju-
dices of the Mahometans are so un-
bounded, that they consider them-
selves almost contaminated by an as-
sociation with Christians, and that the
incautious boy should have ventured
to embrace any part of the body of a
Musselman, struck him as an act of
temerity which might produce the most
terrible effect.
Even the attendants or guards, (for
he knew not what they were) ap-
peared astonished, and two of them
rushed forward as if they intended to
seize poor Richard, who, totally insen-

priety, remained with his hand in that of
his new sovereign's, and his
eyes
bent
towards the ground: a repulsive glance
towards the officious attendants pre-
vented them from laying hands upon
the youthful favourite; for such, by
the gracious smile bestowed upon him,
it was clear he would prove: then,
turning him round, and minutely exa-
mining every part of his person, he
passed his hand several times round his
mouth; then, placing it upon his
head, and looking at Mr. Fowler with
a complacent countenance, he said
something he did not understand, but
which he comprehended to be, that the
partner of his misfortunes was younger
than he appeared, as from feeling his
face, and touching his hair immedi-
ately afterwards, he concluded he had

his inferiority, and remained for some
minutes standing with his arms up-

it, and condescended to bestow a con-

boy, which seemed to act as a cordial
to his drooping spirits; and yet, so
unconquerable were his fears, that he

upon the retinue by whom the chief
was surrounded, he fixed them upon
his only protector with an imploring
look.

During these awful moments of sus.
pense, the agitated Mr. Fowler was
committing his soul to the protection
of his Redeemer; for, understanding
a few words of the Arabic language,
he was persuaded their lives were go-
ing to be sacrificed, as he knew enough
to comprehend that these men had as-
sured their lawgiver the cords they
had shewn him would answer the pur-
pose they designed. He likewise knew
that strangulation was a mode of civil
justice in that part of the universe;
and from a few other words he had en.
deavoured to interpret, he had reason
to imagine they thought the trio be-
longed to a piratical vessel which had
been wrecked on that shore; and being
well aware that the Deys never dis-
played mercy to those vile depredators,
he resolved to meet his fate with chris-
tian fortitude. Fortunately for the

hero of my tale, he was as ignorant of
these eastern customs as he was of the
conflicting emotions which passed in
the mate's mind; and though he
thought the cords might be intended
to secure their persons, he had not the
most distant idea that they might be-
come the instruments of depriving
them of life.
Near five minutes elapsed in this
wretched state of uncertainty, when
the sound of the chief's voice struck
bim as the signal for destruction ;
and though he repeated several sen-
tences with great energy, he could not

in the most submissive manner, implor-

Fortunately, or rather providentially,
for the party, Mr. Fowler had had a
liberal education; and though but a
very indifferent Greeian, was able to
make himself understood; and the
Dey (for such he proved) no sooner
heard himself addressed in sounds
which were familiar to bim, than he
ordered him to rise ; revived his hopes

It is not in the power of language to
describe the extatic joy which filled
the breast of the delighted Mr. Fowler,
at hearing himself addressed in sooth-

knowledge of the Arabic language,
he had imagined the silken cords,
which were merely intended to bind
his arms or legs together, were to
be used as bands of strangulation.

In the reign of James the First, the two noble-

dreadful treasonous combination, known by the ap-

die, but actually had their heads upon the block,

deavoured to give him a candid de-

had thrown him and his forlorn com-
panions upon that apparently unculti-
vated part of the globe; but all his at-

a more perfect knowledge of the Gre-

tion nor the misfortunes they had en-
countered could have 'been properly
explained.
Richard, aware that he could ex-
plain their misfortunes with more per-
spicuity than the mate, and encouaged
so to do, by the conciliating looks

stowed upon him, in the most respect-
ful terms, and with the most submis-
sive gestures, not only related the dis-
asters which had befallen himself and
his companions, but implored the pro-
tection of their deliverer, as he judi.
ciously termed the Dey of Algiers.
And here my young readers must
permit me to digress for a few moments,
for the purpose of pointing out the
advantages which may arise to them
from a perfect acquaintance with dif-
ferent languages; for when Richard
Rivington was studying the classics at
Eton, he little imagined that the slight
knowledge he had of them, would
prove
the means of preserving his existence;
yet that it did so, is evident; and most
sincerely do I hope that the benefits he
derived from paying attention to his
studies during childhood, may be the
means of inducing all those who pe-

ruse his history to follow his example;
reflecting at the same time, that I only
hold hiin up as a pattern for the im-
provement of their minds, for every one
who reads bis history must be con-
vinced I neither wish them to follow
his example in undutifulness to his
pa-
rents, or in forming a friendship with
persons in inferior situations.
But to return to Richard and his
companions ; the Dey and all his at-
tendants listened to the recital with
evident emotion ; and at the conclu-
sion of it, the former gave him the
strongest assurances of protection : the
cords which had excited so much ter-
ror in the mind of Mr. Fowler were
replaced in their former situation, and
quitting the cave at their commander's
injunction, following him into a large
barge which lay at the mouth of a
creek.
## p. 137 (#147) ############################################
RICHARD THE RUNAWAY. 137
At the distance of about a quarter
of a mile they perceived a sloop or
small frigate, which did not venture to
approach nearer, on account of the
rocks and shoals, but which seeing the
barge draw near, was instantly manned
in the same order that an English ves-
sel is, when the Admiral is going on
board.
My young readers are already aware
that the ship-wrecked mariners had
fallen into the hands of the Dey of Al-
giers; but they still are to be informed
of the motive which induced him to
sail so many leagues from his native
shore. This Dey, whose name was
Mumul Hamet, had, from a mere boy,
displayed a partiality for maritime pur-
suits; and finding that the commerce
of the country was interrupted by the
depredations committed by the Spanish
pirates, determined, if possible, to put

a stop to them; and for this purpose
he not only manned several vessels to
intercept them, but took the command
i of one himself.
It has been observed that the island
upon which the unfortunate Richard
and his companions had been cast was
elevated; and likewise, that to pre-
serve themselves from the attacks of
the tigers, hynas, and other des
structive animals which infest that
country, they had made a large fire
at the mouth of the cave, the illumi-
nation of which was seen at a great
distance, and attracted the attention of
the Dey. To bring the vessel in which
they sailed o anchor near the spot
where they discovered the fire was im-
possible; the Dey therefore selected
about twenty of the bravest of the
crew, resolving to fall upon these sup-
posed depredators, and if they refused

to surrender, slay them all. The mo-
ment the chief beheld his captives, he
was persuaded they were not persons
of the description he had imagined
them to be ; and when his attendants
would have fallen upon them, and de-
prived them of liberty, if not of life,
he repressed their rage by a stern
mandate, which terrified poor Mason
to the degree which has been described.
The Algerines who accompanied the
Dey were well aware that the cave in
which the unfortunate mariners had
found an asylum was a spot in which
the pirates frequently lodged their
prizes; and fearing they might be sud-
denly surprized and overpowered by
superior numbers, urged the necessity
of putting them to death, and making
the best of their way to the frigate be-
fore their enemies arrived.
Fortunately, or rather providentially,

for them, the Dey was a man endowed
with humane feelings ; and, disregard-
ing the advice of his attendants, mere?
ly gave orders to bind the captives, and
conduct them to the barge ; but this
coercive measure was not practised
when he became acquainted with their
real situation.
The Dey was received on board
his vessel with more homage than
would have been shewn the king of
England in a similar situation : car-
pets were spread before him as he de-
scended into the cabin, and cushions
placed within the distance of two or
three yards for him to rest upon. The
captain of the ship had been left to
protect her, and several of the superior
officers, who all seemed 'to testify as
much joy and emotion at the return of
their sovereign as if he had encoun-
tered the most terrible dangers. To

these gentiemen the Dey alternately
presented the captives, and evidently
described the situation in which they
had been found; but as he did this
in the Lingua Franca language,
neither Mr. Fowler
nor Richard
could completely comprehend their
remarks, though the latter understood
enough to find that the Dey intended
to keep him about his own person, and
likewise determined to make him em-
brace the Mahometan religion. This
ill-fated youth had unfortunately paid
but little attention during childhood
to the doctrines which his Redeemer -
had taught, yet his heart inwardly
shrunk with horror at the bare idea of
being compelled to renounce his be-
lief in Christ, and to embrace the doc-
trines of an impostor*, whose pre-

tended miracles had, imposed upon the
unenlightened part of mankind.
As soon as the ceremony of intro-
duction was over, the three captives
were conducted into a small cabin ad-
joining the state apartment; coffee,
and dried and fresh fruits, were pre-
sented to them by two young
who afterwards brought in three ewers
and basins for them separately to wash
in, with beautiful towels richly em-
broidered. Mr. Fowler, who was no
stranger to the Turkish customs, in-
stantly made use of the water, desiring
Turks ;
gion, was born in the year 571, at the city of Mecca,
in Arabia, and by pretended miracles induced the
unenlig'tened inhabitants of that part of the universe
to believe that the sanctity of his life had procured
him the favour of the great Creator of the world. He
even had the audacity to declare that the Almighty
condescended to converse with him, and give him
a code of laws, which were termed the KORAN, and
which all his followers to this day rigidly observe.

a pity it is to let a drop of water come

and it was accompanied by some excel-
lent cakes, or rather biscuits, made of
rice, of which the two boys ate very
heartily, and which their companion
likewise thought extremely nice; but
his mind was too much occupied by
reflecting upon the singularity of his
situation to permit him to partake of
them with any appetite. The domes-
tics having removed the refreshments,
re-entered the cabin laden with cu-
shions, which having spread upon the
floor in three separate directions, made
signs for them to repose upon them,

first spreading over each a covering of
mohair, something resembling, though
much thicker, than a shawl.
Joy and astonishment were depictured
upon the countenances of the two youth-
ful captives, but Mr. Fowler knew not
whether he had reason to rejoice or be
sorrowful; for wellaware that the Turks
are by nature treacherous, he could
not help fearing the uncommon atten-
tion which was paid them was the ef-
fect of some deep-laid plan. Deter-
mining, however, not to give way to
suspicions which might prove un-
founded, he dropped upon his knees,
returned thanks to the Almighty for
his deliverance, and implored his far-
ther protection ; and in this devo-
tional act he was followed by his com-
panions, who prayed with greater
fervour than they had ever done in
their lives. They then stretched them-

selves on the downy cushions which
had been prepared for them; and
though the hero of my story had en-
joyed three or four hours' sleep in the
cave, the superior comfort of his pre-
sent quarters soon lulled him into the
arms of Morpheus again, and they did
not awake until the firing of guns or
cannon roused them, and, as might na-
turally be expected, put them into a
terrible fright. The cause of the ex-
plosion was, however, instantly made
known unto them; the vessel was ar-
rived in the port of Algiers, and the
firing was in compliment of the Dey's
return. The captives followed the
person upon deck who had given
them this intelligence, and the beauty
of the surrounding country at once
struck them with astonishment and
delight; for it is impossible for the
power of imagination to paint or the

pen of fiction to describe a more pic-
turesque prospect than that which pre-
sented itself to their astonished sight.
The town of Algiers is built upon
the declivity of a mountain, at the
bottom of which, flows an immense ex- |
panse of waters, where ships of differ-
cnt sizes find a safe and commodious
harbour, and where smaller vessels are
seen in perpetual motion. The houses
rise in regular succession, and to those
who are in the harbour present the
appearance of an amphitheatre: the
tops are all flat; and those belonging
to the principal inhabitants are covered
with gravel, and the borders planted
with different shrubs. In these gar-
dens their possessors walk in the cool
of the evening, and enjoy the sea's
refreshing breezes; but the effect
pro-
duced upon the sight, by the intermix-
ture of gardens and habitations, is too

beautiful for language to do justice.
Though, from the gradual ascent of
these buildings, the town appears so
beautiful from the harbour, yet the
streets are all extremely narrow; still
this mode of building answers the de-
signed purpose, namely, that of keep-
ing off the heat. The environs of
the town is one continued garden,
adorned with cooling fountains,
abounding with delicious fruits, and
embellished with a variety of villas, to
which the grandees and principal mer-
chants retire during thesummermonths.
Their fruits are at once abundant and
delicious; they have oranges, lemons,
citrons, pomegranates, figs, almonds,
olives, and a species of melon which
is in perfection in winter, and another
in summer; the stems of their grape
vines are so immensely thick, that it
is with difficulty a man can grasp them

with both arms, and the bunches of fruit
which grow from them measure a foot
and half in length, and are delicious to
the taste: yet this exuberance of na-
ture is only attached to certain parts
of the country of Algiers; for in others,
it is dry, barren, and mountainous,
and very thinly inhabited; the natives
are a distinct race, who wander about
the country dwelling in tents, instead
of established habitations.
My young readers will, I trust, par-
don this digression; and under that
idea, I will trespass no farther upon
their patience than to inform them
that the spot the hero of my tale was
destined to take up his abode in, is the
capital of the country that bears the
name, (which is one of the states of Bar-
bary, but divided into three provinces).
That the appearance of a town so pic-
turesquely beautiful, should produce a

striking effect upon the mind of so
young a traveller as Richard is natu-
ral: he stood for some moments per-
fectly transfixed with delight; then
turning to Mr. Fowler, he exclaimed,
"Surely, my dear Sir, that place must
be Paradise !"* " Paradise or Purga-
tory," he replied, "my dear fellow ;
but remember all is not gold that glit-
ters : I now know where we are;
though from what motive we have
been treated with so much civility, and
attention, I confess myself unable even
to conjecture."
A numerous body of janizaries ap-
peared to have been waiting the ar-
rival of the Algerine sovereign, aecom-
panied by their respective officers,
who crowded forward to testify as
much joy at his safe arrival, as if he

months as hours. A beautiful Arabian

edge of the water between two grooms,
whilst two attendauts walked on each
side the saddle, holding over the ani-
mal a large embroidered umbrella.
The horse was preceded by a grandee of
distinction, followed by two pages,
who, upon the Dey's setting his foot
on shore, presented the charger, on
which he vaulted with as much agility
as those men who are bred to feats of
activity at Astley's, or the Circus. The
soldiers instantly formed themselves
into lines, through which, the Dey
passed with an air of majestic triumph,
whilst the band played the most mar-
tial airs. Though the captives beheld
this august sight with a mixture of de-
light and astonishment, they were to-
tally ignorant what was to be their
fate; for the Dey had landed without
addressing a single word to them, al-

though they had ventured to follow in
his train. The suspense they endured,
however, was not of long duration; for
the two superior officers, who had at-
tended their sovereign in his aquatic
expedition, informed Mr. Fowler, by
the aid of gesture and language, they
had received orders to pay them every
attention; though, from the mixed
dialect they spoke, it was with the ut-
most difficulty that either Rivington
or Mr. F. could comprehend their
meaning.

in this state of uncertainty, when the

that the asses were intended for himself
and his companions.
With an air of supercilious haughtie

now presented itself to the sight of the
astonished Richard; and as curiosity
was the object of his quitting the shel-
tering arms of his attached mother, it
appeared likely to be gratified; yet
gladly would he have consented to re-

of England for the whole term of his
existence, could he have transported
himself back to his native soil-SO
alarmed was he by the fierce looks of
the persons who surrounded him, and
so fearful was he that the loss of liber-
ty was but a prelude to the loss of
life.
As he disrobed himself of that dress
which distinguished his, country, the
tears involuntarily started into his eyes;
and upon untying a cravat, which was
as they are not only considered beneficial to the con-
stitution, but frequent immersions, form a part of
their religious ceremonies,

marked with the hair of his affection-
ate parent, he actually wept like a
child; and turning to Mr. Fowler, he
exclaimed, " Oh, never shall I behold
those dear hands which marked this
handkerchief! Never shall I see that
face which always gazed upon me with
a smile !!!
Ill-fated boy! who, like too many
others, never knew the value of a trea-
sure until they have lost the possession
of it ;-how deeply did he then feel the
impropriety of his own conduct, and
when it was too late, how sincerely did
he repent!
My young readers will doubtless re-
collect that this misguided youth hadh
availed himself of the time of his mo-
ther's absence on a visit to a friend in
Oxfordshire to make his elopement,
and they will likewise recollect a letter
which had been sent to the head mas-,

ter of Eton, the writing of which was
an exact imitation of Mrs. Rivington's
hand; and so little suspicion had Doctor
H of the preconcerted measures
between his pupil and the abandoned
Gennings, that he concluded the for-
mer was with his mother in London.
Three days elapsed without any cir-
cumstance occurring to prove the in-
correctness of this opinion; when, on
the fourth, a letter arrived, addressed
to Master Rivington, which, as, was
customary, the Doctor opened.
To form a just idea of this amiable
preceptor's agitation and astonishment
is impossible; for upon perusing the
epistle he found it was written by his
pupil's attached mother, who inform-
ed the ungrateful boy that, notwith-
standing the urgent intreaties of her
friends in Oxfordshire, she intended
being at Windsor on the following

Sunday at three o'clock; and intreated
he would solicit his master to permit
him not only to dine with her, but re-
main at home until Monday morning.
The Doctor instantly went to the inn:
from which the stage had set out, and
examining the office day-book, disco
vered the names of the passengers:
who had accompanied the Runaway as
far as London; as the servant who
had earried his portmanteauhad merely
delivered it to the book-keeper, and
seen his charge enter the vehicle,
without observing who were his com-
panions. One of the passengers hap-
pened to prove a Mr. Wilson, who
kept a confectioner's shop in the town,
which the Eton boys where in the habit
of frequenting, and of course, were on
familiar terms with the master of it.
To Mr. Wilson's house, therefore, the
Doctor directed his footsteps, and from

him discovered that Gennings was an
outside passenger; bt so completely
precautious had both the youths con-
ducted themselves, that the circum-
stance appeared the effect of accident;
for when the stage stopped to change
horses, each .appeared astonished at
finding the other was bound for the
metropolis. Mr. Wilson likewise in-
formed Doctor H-, that in the
course of conversation he had asked
Master Rivington whether he was go-
ing to spend any time in London, or
whether his mother, or any of her ser-
vants, were to meet him at the inn.-
The former question he negatived very
laconically; but, after a pause of a
into Oxfordshire to his mamma; that
a friend of her's would meet him, and
accompany him in a post-chaise. As
soon as the stage drove into the inn-

yard, Gennings descended from the
top of the coach ; and after conversing
a few moments with a man who was a
stranger to Mr. Wilson, approached Ri-
chard, saying, "Master Rivington, your
mamma's friend could not meet you, but
has sent his servant with a hackney,
coach: shall I see your luggage put
into it? for you are not much acquaint-
ed with the tricks that are often played
in London." Mr. Wilson then took
leave of his fellow-traveller, without
the slightest suspicion.
Having obtained this unsatisfactory
intelligence, the Doctor instantiy went
to Gennings's father, and accused him
of being accessary to his pupil's elope-
ment, and alternately threatened and
persuaded him to acknowledge he had
been so : but the poor man appeared
actually shocked at such a charge; la-
mented the hour that a young gentle-

man, like Master Rivington, should
have formed an attachment for such
an ungracious rascal, as he termed his
son; offered to go directly to Cap-
tain Brownlow's residence, for the pur-
pose of discovering (if possible) whe-
ther the hero of my tale had ac-
companied him in his
voyage.
This
measure was highly approved by the
superior of the college, who, at the
same time, set off for the metropolis,
examined every person at the inn, but
all to: no purpose, as neither Riving-
ton or Gennings were scarcely recol-
lected.
From the inn Doctor Hwent
to the Custom-house, fancying that
the passengers' names, as well as the
freight of all vessels, which quit the
river, might have been inserted. But
alas ! disappointment attended all his,
exertions, and he returned to the inn

mortified, dejected, and dispirited. The
next measure he practised was to cir-
culate hand-bills, and to put an ad
vertisement in all the
papers,
describ-
ing the person of the youth; his height,
dress, &c, and offering a hundred
pounds reward for any intelligence of
him.
Having taken these active
measures, he ordered a post-chaise for
Eton, when the idea suddenly occurred
to him that Mrs. Rivington might see
the advertisment. Friendship and hu-
manity therefore induced him to alter
his design; and instead of going
home immediately, he resolved to
be the communicator of this melan-
choly intelligence. None but a mo-

ings, upon being made acquainted
with the unnatural conduct of the
being to whom she had given life!

She wept and raved by turns; for
several hours refused all kind of suste-
nance; but at length, exhausted by
mental suffering, she fell into an un-
quiet sleep.
Her friends in the mean time called
in the aid of a physician, for they
dreaded witnessing a return of those
violent paroxysms of grief: she awoke,
however, more composed than they
expected, yet declaring she should not
many days survive the loss of her be-
loved child.
" For shame, Madam!" exclaimed
Doctor Hamilton (which was the name
of the physician); " is it thus you
would perform the duties you were
sent into the world to fulfil? Ought

am not mistaken, even to the erclusion

and sister had'an equal claim. Who

be sent by the hand of Omnipotence,
to recal you to a sense of duty, and re-

claims ! Let me advise you, then, nog
to offend your Maker by yielding to
immoderate grief. Make use of every

yourself for not having testified an
equal portion of affection to all."
There was too much truth in the Doc-
tor's remarks, and too much genuine
piety in his sentiments, for them not to
make an impression upon a naturally
susceptible heart; and the disconsolate
Mrs. Rivington determined to follow
his advice, Other advertisements were
rapidly circulated, promising a reward
of five instead of one hundredpo unds,
to any person who would only give her
information respecting her son.
Captain Brownlow, however, had
i sailed within so short a time after the
hero of my tale arrived in London,
that his person was as completely un-
known as his name : Doctor Hamilton's
council, however, was not lost upon
his mother, and in the course of a few
weeks she became tolerably resigned;

turn of Captain Brownlow. A dread-
ful blow, notwithstanding, awaited

Some weeks elapsed in doubt and

The worthy Mr. Eliott not only de-

young friend, but
regretted having written to his corre-

readers will remember he had intreated
to call upon Mrs. Richardson,and en-

would be the most likely measures to
induce him to return.

exclaimed Mr. Millington-" he will

assurance of your forgiveness. I am

must attend such a voyage; and in

authority over him, and I assure you
it is not possible to place it in better
hands. Eliott will compel him to
leave the low associates with whom he'
has leagued in that abominable ship,

escort of some officer, on whose kind-

This judicious advice was not only
faithfully followed, but the most grate-
ful letter that the heart of a fond mo.

upon a house of credit, as an acknow-

received: but to prevent Captain E.
from thinking the sum too great a r-
turn for the kindness he had displayed
towards Richard, Mrs. R. intreated
out of it he would discharge any debts
he might have contracted.
This draft and letter arrived soon
after Mr. Eliott had received the me-
lancholy intelligence of the loss of the
Speedwell; and his heart almost bled
as he perused the proofs of maternal
tenderness which the letter contained.

affection, she lost the being on whom
the greatest portion of her temporal
happiness had been placed ; yet, when
she reflected upon the natural impetu-

might in mercy have cut short the
thread of life. To the improper friend:

worthless young man, Gennings, she
attributed the unwarrantable step he
had taken and convinced that his
heart was naturally good, she felt per-

idea firmly impressed upon her mind,

a Christian; and gave orders for a mo-

parental affection to the memory of her
darling child.
But we will now return to the Al
gerine captives, who having laid aside
their English habit, scarcely knew
each other in their new dress, with
which Mason seemed not only satisfied
but actually delighted. I must now
recal my young readers' attention to
the first meeting between the Dey and
Richard, and account for that apparent
partiality which the former instanta-
neously displayed. This potent prince,
it seems, had, about sixteen years
back, taken a Spanish vessel, in which
was on board a beautiful young wo-
man and an infant at the breast, the
charms of whose person so completely
captivated him, that in fact he be-

came her slave. The husband of the
lovely Spaniard lost his life in the en-
gagement, and she found herself with-
out relation, protector, or friend; but
these tender ties seemed all restored to
her by the soothing attentions she hour-
ly received from the Dey.
He was at first under the necessity
of disclosing the passion she had in-
spired him with by the aid of an inter-
preter; but in a few weeks each were
able to converse with the other; the
prince offered to espouse her, on con-
dition that she would embrace the
Mahometan' faith. Whether allured
by the splendour of royalty, or whe-
ther induced by affection, I cannot pre-
tend to say, but certain it is, that the
fair Zaida abjured religion, friends, and
country, and took the Alcoran, * in-
stead of the Bible, for her guide. The
* Alcoran, the Mahometan code of religious laws.

child, who of course, was bred up in
the same persuasion, was called Al-
cander, and as Zaida had no children
by her second husband, this boy was
the idol both of the Dey and his mo-
'ther. About six weeks before the
cap-
tivity of Richard, Alcander was seized
with a fever, which in a few days ter-
minated his life, and a resemblance
between the two youths, not only ap-
peared striking to the African sove-
reign, but to all his attendants.
To this resemblance, in all probabi-
lity, were the three captives indebted
for their humane treatment; for no
sooner had the Dey cast his eyes upon
the youthful hero of my story, than the
idea struck him that he might act as a
balm to the afflicted bosom of the ob-
ject of his affection, whom he imme-
diately went to prepare for the sight of
a stranger, who in beauty equalled, if
not exceeded, her lost son.

The attention Mr. Fowler received
proceeded from a motive opposite to
affection, namely interest; for the
same epidemic fever which had cut off
the youthful Alcander proved fatal to
the Dey's principal clerk, who trans-
acted all the business in the European
trade. It seemed as if Providence had
ordained these events to happen at a
time most favourable to the shipwreck-
ed mariners, and Mr. Fowler joyfully
accepted a situation likely to prove so
truly advantageous.
So different was the effect which
the sight of the young European pro-
duced upon the mind of the afflicted
Zaida, to that which her doating hus-
band had expected, that the moment
she beheld him, she uttered a most pierc-
ing shriek; and stretching herself upon
the sofa on which she was reclining,
remained for some minutes without the
slightest symptom of life. The inno.

cent cause of this tender conflict of
maternal feelings remained fixed to
the spot motionless and terrified; for
the alarm which the Dey testified for
the fate of the object in whom all his
earthly, happiness: seemed centred, was
rather that of an enraged madman
than the calm composure of real dis.

first overspread the still beautiful
Zaida, he hung over her in all the
speechless agony of grief; then drop-

eyes; but still beholding the object
which had' occasioned the internal
struggle, waved her liand in token of
having him removed from 'her sight;
upon which, the Dey in a voice resem-
bling thunder, ordered him to be car-
ried to the furthermost extent of his
dominions. As the command was ut-
tered in the Moorish language, the
poor lad fortunately did not compre-
hend it ; one of the attendants, how.
ever, rudely seized him, and instead
of conducting, absolutely dragged him
out of the apartment.
Thus in one moment vanished all
those airy visions of happiness which
the sanguine mind of the youthful hero
of my narrative had indulged, from
the account he had received from
one of the attendants who acted as in-
terpreter, and who had made him ac-
quainted with the sudden partiality his

consequence of the strong resemblance
he had discovered between him and
his son-in-law.
Instead of the ill-fated boy being
reconducted to the companions of his
misfortune, he was led into a kind of
solitary prison,' into which he was
thrust with a savage barbarity of action,
and the door instantly double-locked.

of conduct may be imagined, but to
describe it would be impossible, He:

half an hour, without being able to
compose his feelings, or even to collect
his scattered thoughts; for the dread
of instant death, and the terrific glances
the Dey had, directed towards him, for
a length of time deprived him of the
power of recollection.
The apartment into which he had
been so inhumanly thrust was adjoin-
ing the stables; and independent of
size, resembled one : it was, in fact, a
mere closet, in which some of the trap-
pings for the Dey's

deprived himself of personal gratifica-
tions to relieve the wants of the dis-
tressed; and the consolation he de-
rived from reflecting upon these duties,
was superior to any thing language
can express. He fervently implored
the forgiveness of his Heavenly Father,
and besought him to shower down bless-
ings on his earthly parent's head,
recommended his brothers and sister to
his protection, and with a mind more
composed than could have been ex-
pected, awaited the stroke of death.-
Yet when the sound of feet approached
the door, his heart palpitated so vio-
lently, that he could with difficulty
draw his breath ; it was thrown open,
and some boiled rice placed before him
by an old negro, who made signs for
him to eat.

displayed traces of sympathy and bene-
volence, yet he was incapable of com-:

Fowler to him, or to contrive some

" Me naw, and ye naw !" were the
replies which the old African made
both to the ill-fated Richard's solicita-.
tions, and the imploring gestures he
used: this language he construed into
broken English, implying that the ne-
gro
dare not admit Mr. Fowler into that
apartment, and that the prisor er must
not go out of it. Whether he was
right or wrong in the conjecture is un-
certain ; but after remaining with the
captive about a quarter of an hour, he
took his' leave with a friendly nod,

Fowler or Mason made their appear

had acquired from reflecting upon throse
duties he had not neglected totally for

the floor in a paroxysm of affliction,

would break. From this state of de-

by the unbolting of his prison door;;

tered who had accompanied him in
his aquatic excursion. On the coun..

and mildness were depictured : le ada

able to understand it was the Dey's
pleasure that he was to be sent several
miles up the country, where his em-
ployment would be to cultivate one of
that prince's summer gardens, and to
instruct a certain number of Moorish
children in the English language.
This information was imparted and
understood with great difficulty; ges-
ture, however, supplied the incorrect-
ness of speech; but when the ill-fated
youth discovered that neither Mr.
Fowler or Mason were to accompany
him, he displayed the most violent
symptoms of grief, and falling on his
knees, he assured the officer that if he
was to be separated from his comrades
it would be an act of charity to end
his life. All his entreaties only to bid
farewell to the partners of his misfore

day-break, which he did, accompanied
by two Moorish conductors, whose lan-
guage he could neither comprehend nor
speak. That this severity should have
been displayed towards the unoffending
Richard, must strike my young readers
as very extraordinary; but they must re-
collect that equity and justice seldom in-
fluence the actions of the inhabitants of
barbarous and unpolished nations.-
Love, that passion which is known to
soften the breasts of the greatest sa-
vages, had induced the Dey of Algiers
to treat the poor Runaway with atten-
tion and kindness; but the moment
he found that the object of his affec.
tion instead of being gratified by the
sight of a being who resembled her lost
Alcander was disgusted with his ap-
pearance, his wish was, to prevent a
repetition of it; and for that cause
alone he was sent up the country, and

not even permitted to wait the return
of his friend.
At the moment Richard was pre-
sented to the disconsolate Zaida, Mr.
Fowler was conducted to the habita-
tion the deceased clerk had occupied ;
and having obtained permission for
Mason to accompany him in the capa-,
city of a superior servant, began exa
mining into the nature of his office.-
Grateful to Providence for having so
unexpectedly thrown him into a way of
making a rapid fortune, several hours
elapsed without a thought of Richard,
whom he had understood was to reside
with him, at least for the present. His
absence, however, did not excite any
apprehension ;' he even imagined the
Dey's evident partiality had induced
him to detain the ill-fated boy in his
palace. Though he sincerely deplored
the loss of the Speedwell, yet he blessed

Heaven for the good fortune which had
fallen to the lot of the surviving few,
and retired to rest with a mind at once
grateful, happy, and tranquillized.
Far different were his sensations the
next morning when he discovered
poor Richard's adverse fate; he could
scarcely avoid openly condemning the
capricious conduct of his royal master,
or execrating that of his favourite.--
He was well aware, however, of the
necessity of confining his feelings in
his own bosom; for it is only the in;
habitants of England who are indulged
with the freedom of speech : he like-
wise was sensible of the many advan-
tages which attended his present situa-
tion, and resolved not to utter a word,
or be guilty of a single action which
might be the means of depriving him
of it. He was even fearful of enquiring

wrecked companion had been trans-
ported, and actually remained ignorant
of it near three months; during that
time notwithstanding, he had been in-
defatigable in his exertioris to disco-
ver his abode. A short time after
Mr. Fowler's establishment in his new
office, he had an opportunity of send-
ing a letter to Gibraltar, in which he
made Mr. Eliott acquainted with every
circumstance which had happened
since the Speedwell's quitting the Spa-
nish coast. Though at the time of
writing, he was ignorant of Richard's
destination, yet he expressed a convic-
tion that he soon should be made ac-
quainted with it; and concluded his
letter by assuring him, that though he
could not appear an active party in
obtaining the poor lad's liberty, yet,
with Mr. Eliott's assistance, he had no
doubt of accomplishing it.

The youthful hero of my story, upon

the beauty of the surrounding country,

and after travelling about four hours,
he was delighted at perceiving his com-
panions ride up to a mansion enclosed
within a kind of Indian palisade. That
his journey terminated was very fortu-
nate; for had it only extended one
mile, he must have fallen from the
mule; so intense was the heat, and so
completely fatiguing the rate at which
they had rode. His companions, un-
ceremoniously, entered a kind of court-
yard, and were instantly surrounded
by several of their countrymen, who
by their gestures testified a mixture of
joy and astonishment.
Their joy, of course, was excited by
unexpectedly seeing two old acquaint-
ance; their astonishment, by the apo
pearance of the youth who accompa-
nied them ; who, whilst 'hiscon ductors
were relating what they knew of his
history, felt ready to expire with heat

and fatigue. Totally unmindful of his
sensations, they remained gabbering
together for a length of time, and pro-
bably would have discoursed much
longer, had not their attention been
roused by hearing a deep sigh from
the breast of the exhausted Richard,
who at the moment of breathing it
fell, apparently lifeless, from his seat.
How long he remained in that state of
insensibility is uncertain; but when
recollection was restored, he found
bimself stretched on a kind of sofa,
under the shade of several large trees,'.
with his head supported by a venerable
old Mussulman, whose dress bespoke
him to be a priest. On the counte:
nance of this man benignity and hu-
manity were depictured ; he held a
cordial to the lips of the exhausted

the party could understand his lan-
guage, he silently yielded to the propen-
sity of nature, and fell into a profound
sleep. A certain portion of the lethargic
drug* had, in all probability, been in-
fused in the cordial, for near four and
twenty hours elapsed before he awoke ;
and when he did, he found his health
completely recruited, and that languor
which had overpowered him entirely
vanished. To attempt describing the
feelings of the disconsolate Richard, or
painting his sensations, would occupy
too large a space in so confined a work;
I shall therefore merely say, that in
the course of a few days he became
more reconciled to his situation, and
with a mixture of cheerfulness and
alacrity fulfilled his daily tasks.

the bottom of that garden which it
kvas Richard's business to keep in or-
der; and instructed those children in
the duties of the Mahometan religion,
whom the hero of my story taught (or
rather attempted to teach) the English
language.
Although Richard had been consi-
dered as one of the best Grecians at
Eton, yet the language spoken by the
lower order of people in Africa had a
mixture of the Moorish dialect with it;
he therefore found himself reduced to
great difficulty, both in comprehending
what they said to him, and making
himself understood. The spot to which
it was the Dey's pleasure to banish
him, was a villa to which that prince
sometimes resorted for the purpose of
hunting; and as the object of his af-

shared that amusement, he was sent
thither to prevent the too susceptible
Zaida from being affected by his re-
semblance to her son.
Botany was a favourite study with
the Dey of Algiers; and he spared no
expence to have his various gardens
furnished with choice plants from every
part of the world. Under the care of
the head gardener (whose name was
Hazel) was Richard placed by his con-
ductors, and a hard task-master he
proved; for from the dawn of day, until
night overspread the horizon, Hazel
kept poor Richard constantly at work.
During the meridian heat it doubtless
was impossible even for the Africans
to labour, yet no part of the day elapsed
in idleness, as at those hours his time
was occupied in teaching twelve chil-
dren his native language.

The situation of the ill-fated boy was
truly pitiable : the Mahomet in priest
who had displayed so much humanity
towards him upon his arrival, was the
only being who in the slightest degree
seemed to commiserate his situation :
that cheerfulness natural to youth
soon degenerated into despondency, and
all his hopes of happiness were centred
in a futureworld. That great and com-
passionate Being, whom, amidst all his
failings, he had always worshipped,
mercifully commiserated his distressed
situation, and raised him up a friend
at a moment when he had no reason to

the Dey's prisoner. Mr. Eliott's feel-
ings were not merely the effect of
sympathy; he despised that friendship
which would not put itself to any in-
convenience : he willingly would have
hazarded his own existence to obtain
liberty for the being whom he pro-
fessed to love as a child. The moment
he perused Mr. Fowler's epistle, he re-
solved to set sail for Algiers; and
knowing that money would obtain every
thing, he resolved to request the Dey
to fix a price upon his prisoner.
Prosperous winds soon wafted him
into the port of Algiers: upon landing
he enquired for Mr. Fowler, and was
immediately conducted to his habita-
tion. That gentleman no sooner dis-
covered that any required sum would
be paid for his shipwrecked companion's
liberty, than he avowed his readiness to
transact the business with his employer,

whose love of money, he was certain,
would induce him readily to consent to
the captive's liberation. One hundred
guineas was demanded, and paid in-
stantly by the anxious Mr. Eliott, who
immediately quitted Algiers, accompa-
nied by Mr. Fowler, to give happiness
and liberty to the youthful hero of my
work. They set out from Algiers
about three hours after dinner, and as
the intense heat of the sun had abated,
they arrived at the end of their jour-
ney just as Richard was completing
his daily toil.
In the few weeks Mr. F. had been in
his employment he had acquired suf-
ficient knowledge of the Moorish lan-
guage to converse with the natives of
the country, at least to ask common
questions; he therefore desired the ser-
vant who opened the door to them to
conduct them to the English captive.

RICHARD THE RUNAWAY,
As they entered the garden, Richard
had just finished his evening employ-
ment of watering it, and was walking
towards the house, meditating upon
his forlorn situation, with the watering-
pot in his hand. His eyes were bent
towards the earth-his steps were slow
and measured, and so little anticipa-
tion had he of the happiness which
awaited him, that he did not raise them
at his friends' approach, and evidently
would have passed them had not Mr.
Eliott caught him in his arms, at the
same time exclaiming, My dear,
dear Richard !"
"Is it a dream? or is it a vision " re-
joined the delighted youth, grasping
his friend with a fervour that proved
the extatic joy of his heart.
" No, my dear fellow, it is neither
dream, or vision," replied the worthy
Mr. Eliott. "I am come to prove that

friendship I professed towards
you
be-
fore you left Gibraltar; and not only
to restore you to liberty, but to the
longing arms of your affectionate mo-
ther."
" Liberty, and mother !" faintly he
articulated ; and before Mr. Eliott had
time to prevent his fall, dropped upon
the earth apparently lifeless, so com-
pletely did joy unstring his nerves.
One of his kind friends flew to procure
water, whilst the other untied his cra-
vat, threw off the turban which en-
twined his forehead, and sprinkled it
with the water which was very near
them. Refreshed by the reviving ap-
plication, the pallid Richard opened
his languid eyes, grasped the hand of
the kind restorer of his liberty to his
bosom, and burst into a flood of tears.
"Oh, my friend, my preserver ! did

I perfectly understand you?" said he,
in a half suffocated tone of voice; " is
it really true, that I am at liberty to
leave this hated country, and again to.
visit my dear native land ?-and, above
all, shall I once more see my
beloved
mother, and again be enfolded in her
maternal arms ?"
"Yes, my dear fellow, these bless-
ings are, I trust, in store for you ;" re-
plied Mr. Eliott; and "consider me,
dear Richard, merely as an humble in-
strument under the hand of Provi-
dence, to whom your heart ought to
glow with gratitude for the unexpecte
ed attainment of your release."
"Death would soon have released
me, Sir," rejoined the transported Ri-
chard, " if the Almighty had not in
mercy sent you to my aid; for I have
been ill, very ill, the last ten days, and

already feel myself a new creature, and

Richard's wardrobe required but lit-
tle time to collect together, neither
was much spent in the form of taking
leave. The Mahometan priest, who
had displayed so much kindness to-
wards him upon his arrival, was the
only person he parted from, with the
slightest regret; and he vaulted upon
the mule which Mr. Fowler had brought
for him with a heart glowing with
pleasure and delight. The trio quitted
the spot of the hero of
my
tale's capti-
vity about eight in the evening, though:
so desirous was he of obtaining liberty
that he would joyfully have encoun-
tered the meridian sun;, in consequence
of this, the delighted trio did not arrive
at Mr. Fowler's habitation until his
servants had retired to resti

RICHARD THE RUNAWAY.
Though the Runaway, as I have
thought proper to call him, re-entered
Algiers with very different sensations
to those he had experienced at quitting
it, yet so apprehensive was he of again
falling under the displeasure of its ca-
pricious sovereign, and so fearful of
being seen by his favourite, that he in-
treated Mr. Eliott to quit it on the fol-
lowing day, although he could not take
leave of Mr. Fowler without testifying
sorrow and regret. Not any thing
worth relating occurred during the
passage from Algiers to Gibraltar,
at which place they arrived at the mo-
ment the officers were quitting evening
parade: to several of them Richard
had been introduced by Lieutenant
Eliott, during the Speedwell's short
stay in the Bay of Gibraltar; and hav.
ing been informed both of his miracu-
lous escape, as' well as his captivity,

205
they crowded round him to testify their
joy at his safe return.
Scarcely had Mr. Eliott set his foot
on shore, when the commanding officer
summoned him into his presence; he
therefore committed his young compa-
nion to one of his brother officers'
care, and hastened to head-quarters to
know what was the general's urgent
business with him. He remained ab,
sent so long, that Richard began to
feel apprehensive something unplea-
sant had occurred; but the moment
he appeared, the pleasure which ani-
mated his countenance completely ba-
nished every sensation of fear.
"My dear fellow," said he, extend-
ing his hand towards Richard, " I had
the satisfaction of congratulating you
upon the good fortune which awaited
you a few hours ago, and you have
now an opportunity of returning the

compliment; for be it known to you
I am no longer Lieutenant Eliott. My
friends in England have long been en-
deavouring to obtain a company for
me, and I was gazetted this day month :
but what renders this circumstance
still more gratifying; the regiment I
now belong to is in England; therefore I
shall have the satisfaction of being the
companion of your voyage."
This intelligence was as pleasing to
the hero of my story, as advantageous
to the person who imparted it; and in
less than ten days both quitted Gibraltar
in one of the packets; Captain Eliott,
amidst the regret of his brother offi-
cers, and Richard with their united.
prayers and good wishes.
My young readers will doubtless re-
collect that Mrs. Rivington had been
made acquainted with the loss of the
Speedwell; they will likewise remem-

ber that affectionate mother had or-
dered a monument to be erected to the
memory of her beloved son.
This
proof of maternal affection was com-
pleted on the day a second letter arriv-
ed from Mr. Eliott, the purport of which
was to inform her, he had reason to
believe her son's life had been most
miraculously preserved, and that he
was going to Algiers for the purpose
of discovering whether the intelligence
which had reached him was true or.
false.
As the amiable Mr. Eliott thought
death preferable to captivity, he avoided
letting this attached mother know the
real situation of her son ; and had he
not been able to obtain his liberty, he
would have carefully concealed his exist-
ence; but the moment they arrived at
Gibraltar both wrote by the first vessel
that quitted the port. These letters,

however, by some accident, 'never
reached the hands of Mrs. Rivington;
she received the one that gave her rea-
son to hope her son had escaped the
wreck, in consequence of which the
monument was not erected, but re-
mained in the sculptor's hands. The
state of her mind, during the painful
period of uncertainty, may be imagined
much better than expressed :-one
hour she indulged hope the next she
was overwhelmed with apprehension,
and the conflict her feelings suffered
became too powerful for bodily strength
to sustain ; a nervous fever was the
consequence, and even the physicians
began to have fears for the preservation
of her life,
No adverse winds arose to alarm the
apprehension of Captain Eliott and his
companion, or any calm ones to impede
the swiftness of the passage ; but they

arrived in England in high health and
spirits, without a single circumstance
having occurred either to injure the
former or to make the latter depressed.
As Captain Eliott imagined the'letters
which had been written from Gibraltar
had prepared Mrs. Rivington for the
sight of her beloved son, he did not
think it necessary to send a messenger
before him, but travelled post with the
utmost expedition. When they arrived
within about two miles of Windsor the
agitation of the hero of my story's
feelings was too forcible to be con-
cealedand bursting into a flood of
tears, he laid his hand upon the knee
of his companion, exclaiming, "In-
deed, I do not think I can bear to see
my mother this night!"
" Not bear to see your mother!" re-
peated the Captain in a tone of asto-
nishment-" What can this mean? Of

what crime have you been guilty ?
There is something completely incom-
prehensive in all this !"-Instead of re-
plying to this degrading suspicion, the
agitated Richard concealed his face
with both hands, and though observing
a total silence, actually sobbed like a
child who had been whipped.
You must explain the meaning of
this singular mode of conduct, young
man;" said Mr. Eliott, in an authori-
tative tone of voice, " for I cannot
help fearing I have been strangely de-
ceived by you : from whence proceeds
this appearance of sorrow, when I ex-
pected to behold symptoms of de-
light ?"
"It proceeds, Sir," replied Richard,
roused by his companion's insinuation,
" from sensations which I had flattered
myself you would have applauded, ram
ther than condemned: it proceeds from

a mixture of joy and apprehension, at
the thought of beholding that dear
parent whom I have so justly offended.
For the last ten miles, Sir, I have been
endeavouring to conquer my feelings,
but they have, as you perceive,' proved
victorious. I have been culpable
enough, God knows; but no other
crime have I committed beyond that
of quitting a fond mother without her
permission.
The manly tone of voice which Ri-
chard had assumed whilst he made this
declaration completely failed him at
the close of it; and at the expression
of fond mother, his voice not only faul-
tered, but he again absolutely sobbed.
" Forgive the unjust suspicion, my
dear fellow," said Captain Eliott,
"and allow me to say I admire your
sensibility: we will contradict the or-
ders we had given the postillion, and

instead of driving to your mother's, go
to an inn, where you shall have time
to regain your composure, and I will
prepare her for a meeting, which, from
our letters, she must daily expect. This
judicious plan meeting with the appro-
bation of the party so deep'y interested
in it, the postillion was ordered to
drive to the Castle. The landlord in-
stantly approached the carriage, but
had not the slightest recollection of
his old acquaintance.
The Castle was not only the inn
which Mrs. Rivington always made
use of, but the Eron boys in general
frequented it; yet change of climate
had not only altered Richard's com-
plexion, but he was grown many inches
taller than when he quitted England.
The travellers entered the room to
which they were conducted, without
accosting each other by name; and

the landlord having' enquired what re-
freshment would be agreeable, quitted
it, without entertaining the slightest
suspicion of liis guest.
Richard so forcibly felt the improprie-
ty of his former conduct, that it was a re-
lief to bis mind to find his person not re.
collected; and he was delighted that the.
shades of evening were so fast approach-
ing, that when he walked to his mo-
ther's there would be no chance of any
person recognizing him. A pint of
wine and biscuits having been brought
into the apartment, Captain Eliott pre-
pared to be the messenger of joyful
nes; and having received instruc-
tion from Richard which way to direct
his footsteps, had not the slightest dif-
ficulty in discovering the house. A
muffled rapper was the first object
which checked those pleasurable sensa-
tions so natural fur a mind o fsensibi-

lity to experience at the prospect of
conveying intelligence likely to inspire
the hearer with exquisite happiness.
He rapped--but no person appear-
ing, he gently pulled the bell, upon
which a footman opened the door with
great gentleness, and civilly requested
to know his business. "I wish to
speak with Mrs. Rivington," said Cap-
tain Eliott. The seryant shook his
head, and, with an air of deep concern,
informed him his mistress was too ill
to be spoken with.
"I must see her," said Mr. Eliott,
" or any intimate friend that may be
staying with her, for I have intelli-
gence to communicate that will be
more serviceable than medicine."-At
that instant an elderly gentleman beg-
ged leave to pass Captain Eliott, who
had not observed any person attempt-
ing to go in.

" This gentleman, Doctor Im,
wishes to speak with my mistress," said
the servant.
"I am sorry to inform
you, Sir," replied the physician, "Mrs.
Rivington is too ill even to receive a
visit from her most intimate acquaint-
ance; in short, her present situation is
extremely critical; but as I am not
only her physician but a friend of the
family, perhaps you will do me the ho-
nour of entrusting me with the nature
of your business." As Doctor L-
said this, he led the way to a small
breakfast parlour, and throwing open
the door of it, invited the Captain to
enter by a motion of his hand.
The moment Doctor

siness, and discovered how kind and
active a friend he had proved, he ex-

noon sent a messenger to London, to

request Doctor Blane's opinion, but in my
own, your presence will prove more effica-
cious than the whole College of Physi-
cians; for the cause of the complaint in
the
first instance was mental, and the body
naturally becomes a victim to the mind's
disease. We must, however, act with
the greatest care and circumspection :
poor Mrs. Rivington's nerves are as
weak as those of a new-born child. I
will cautiously prepare her for the un-
expected happiness which awaits her,
and in the mean time intreat you to
bring young Rivington home; for it
will be adviseable to let him be in the
house at any rate : and then we will
either introduce him this evening, or
defer it a few hours, as we see his at-
tached mother is affected by the joyful
intelligence we impart. Her mind, fr
the last two months, has been in a state
of actual torture.The letter (which

ration to liberty never reached her
hands. She believed him dead, and
supported the shock with greater forti-
tude than I expected; but when your
letter arrived, which excited a hope of
his being in existence, the conflict be-
tween that, emotion, and fear, became
too powerful either for mind or body
calmly to sustain; a nervous fever was
the consequence; and this morning I
thought her so seriously ill, that I have
called in farther advice."
At the close of this speech, Doctor
- took leave of his new acquaint-
with as much cordiality as if they
had been old friends ; for the mutual
solicitude each felt upon the same sub-
ject, set both coldness and formality at
defiance. Captain Eliott found his young
friend pacing the apartment with his
arms folded and his eyes swollen; he

him as the father of the prodigal in the
Scriptures had done?
"I have not seen Mrs. Rivington,"
replied Captain Eliott in a melancholy
tone of voice.-" Not seen her, Sir!"
repeated Richard, throwing himself
into a chair that was near him.-"Oh
my God! what will become of me?

this is what I feared !"

thizing friend of poor Richard; "but,

out the agitated penitent. "I alone
have been the cause of this illness ! but
I will fly to her immediately, on my
knees implore forgiveness, and never
rise from that posture until she pro-
nounces it." So saying, he snatched
up the hat which lay upon the table,
and had not his friend forcibly detained
him, would have hurried out of the
room. Captain Eliott then related the
conversation which had passed between
himself and the physician, and soon
convinced him how necessary it would
be to act with precaution.
With trembling steps the hero of my
story approached those doors which
had always flown open at his approach.
Doctor L-was waiting for him in
the parlour, and hearing a gentle ring,
went into the passage, holding up his
finger, as a token for him not to utter
a word. The moment Richard beheld

feelings of his agitated bosom were
again displayed by tears. " Thank
God, you are arrived !" said the Doc-
tor, in a friendly tone of voice; " for

have been over.-I will not reproach
you at the present moment, it would

quired the anxious Richard, grasping
the physician's arm.--"That you were
an ungracious dog, to be sure, " he
replied, smiling, " and deserved to be
either transported or hanged; I cannot
positively say which of the two punish-
ments she thought adequate to the
crime

" I conjure you not to jest upon so
serious a subject, Doctor," rejoined
Richard. "In truth," he replied, " it
is serious enough; and if you met with
your deserts, young man, the former

completely, that he unhesitatingly as-
sures me he can effect a cure."
"The remedy I shall have the satis-
faction of administering, Madan," said
Captain Eliott; approaching the sofa
on which Mrs. Rivington was reclin-
ing, so will, I trust, prove as salutary
as I know it must be pleasing."
" Even to behold the kind friend of
a beloved child, Sir, must of course be
salutary," replied the suffering victim
of maternal solicitude ; " but when in
you I see the very preserver of his exist-
ence, conceive (if possible) what must
be my sensations, for I feel myself un-
able to express them !" Tears for
some moments prevented the attached
mother from proceeding, and Captain
Eliott caught the soft infection.
"ome, come, good people, I must
call
you to order," said Doctor -
in a jocose tone of voice: "Doctor,

continued he, turning to Mr. Eliott,
"is this the Spanish mode of practice?
I will laugh with my patients as often
as they think proper to require it, but
not a single tear shall any one have
from my eyes,

manner which accompanied this decla-
ration produced a smile on Mrs. Ri-
vington's pallid cheek, when Captain
Eliott began a circumstantial relation
of his embassy to Algiers, and con-
cluded by informing her he had ob-
tained Richard's freedom.
"And where is my boy, Sir? where
is
my
beloved Richard." exclaimed the
delighted mother, as she pressed the
narrator's hand to her palpitating
breast. Is he, or is he not, in England?
Let me intreat you not to keep me in
suspense." Captain Eliott directed his
eyes towards the Doctor, who, without
suffering him to reply, said, " My dear

Mrs. Rivington, if you will promise to
compose your feelings, that question

and approaching the door it flew open,
and the penitent hero of my story
rushed into his mother's arms.
As the force of language could but
imperfectly do justice to this inter-
view, I shall pass it over in silence;
and, in fact, few other words passed in
this affecting meeting than, " Can you
forgive me?" and " Yes, yes, my be-
loved son ?" For some minutes the
fond mother pressed the child of her
fondest affection to her maternal bo-
som; then gently pushed him from
her to observe the alteration his fea-
tures had undergone-again drew him
towards her, and alternately embraced
his cheeks, his forehead, and his
hands. Doctor L, truly anxious
for his debilitated patient, said, But,

my dear Madam, have you not a sin-
gle kiss to bestow upon this gentleman
and myself; some little mark of
gra-
titude, I think, is due to us, for restor-
ing this Runaway to your arms.
"My gratitude will cease but with
my existence, I assure you, my dear
Doctor; and as to Captain Eliott, half
my fortune is at this moment at his
command. In short, I only wish to
have an opportunity of evincing the
high sense I entertain of his kind-
ness, and of the warm effusions of
my
heart."
"I am amply repaid, my dear Ma-
dam," replied Captain Eliott," by the
scene I have just witnessed ; and in-
will never mention the term
obligation, unless you wish to wound
my feelings: for what purpose were
we sent into this world, but to become

At this instant Martha entered; for,
in spite of Doctor 's commands,
she was no longer able to restrain the
joy she experienced at her young mas-
ter's return. "Ah! my dear, dear Ma-

them ; but to-morrow morning I will
send Martha for them, that I may once
more have the gratification of seeing
my children together. I would dis-
patch her this evening, but in all pro-,
bability they are already retired to
rest."
" And if you were to do the same,
my dear Madam, it would be an act of
prudence," said the considerate phy-
sician; " and though I am using
the freedom of friendship by request-
ing Mr. Eliott to conclude his visit,
yet when he considers the motive
which induces me to take this liberty,
I am persuaded he will not be offended:

he, addressing Richard, " you must go
home and sup with me, or I know you
will be talking with your mother until

pearance, and exhibit

ous gazers at sixpence a-head."
The pallid countenance of Mrs.
Rivington evinced that nature was
exhausted by the exquiste sensibility
of her feelings, and she did not make
the slightest objection to the Doctor's
proposal ; in short, she had scarcely
sufficient strength to inform Captain
Eliott a bed would be prepared for
him, and that she expected him to
return with her son. - 'Captain Eliott,
however, proposed to his young
fellow-
traveller that both should sleep at the
Castle; for as Doctor positively
insisted upon their supping with him,
they thought returning to the house
might disturb the invalid, and Martha
was therefore desired not to sit
up
for
them, or to make her mistress ac-
quainted with their intended plan.
The anxious Richard eagerly re-

quested Doctor L-'s candid opinion
respecting the state of his fond parent's
health, and had the happiness of hear-
ing that gentleman declare, that as the
meeting had produced no violent agi-
tation, he did not doubt but his patient
would in a few weeks be perfectly well.
Doctor was not only a very
worthy, but what is termed a face-
tious man: and as the trio were walk-
ing home with him, he exclaimed,
" Dick, I have a mind to play my
family a trick! for you are so com,
pletely changed by that frying climate,
that not one of them, I am persuaded,
will recognize your person; besides, it
is not quite a certain circumstance in
their opinion, whether you were swal-
lowed by a whale, or are a prisoner on
the Barbary coast. I am determined, at
any, rate, to introduce you as Mr.
Richards, and Captain Eliott as an old

friend, whom I have not seen for many
years.
You must prepare yourself,
however, for hearing your conduct
censured pretty severely by Mrs.
I-, who, as regularly as I return
from visiting your poor mother, en-
quires whether any farther intelligence
has arrived of that ingrate her son.
"No censure can be passed upon
me, Sir, beyond that which I merit,"
replied Richard; "but depend upon it
Henry will know me the moment I
enter." "In that case," rejoined the
Doctor, it will be an agreeable surprise
to him; but at any rate we will make
trial of his discriminating powers,
Upon arriving at the Doctor's house
they were ushered into a handsome
library, where Mrs. L-and her son
Henry were sitting with a large map of
Europe before them, whilst the former
was tracing the route of the British

army, according to the account given
of it in the Morning Post.
"Give me leave to introduce Cap-
tain Eliott, my dear, an old friend of
mine, just arrived from the continent,
and his nephew Mr. Richards, who
accompanied him in his travels." Mrs.
welcomed the strangers with
the politeness of a polished gentle-
woman, and Henry, having placed
chairs for them, drew his own close to
that of Richard's. The conversation
became general until after supper,
when Mrs. L-exclaimed,
- Oh!
*my dear Doctor, I forgot to enquire
after poor Mrs. Rivington this even-
ing; how did you find her? Has any
intelligence yet arrived from Gibral-
tar?"
" She is materially better, I assure
you,' replied the Doctor; "in short, I
think I may venture to pronounce her

out of danger." Thank God !" said
she with peculiar emphasis : " then I
trust her life will not fall a sacrifice
to the imprudence of an ungrateful
son." Doctor -, without replying,
turned his eyes towards Richard, and
beheld his countenance suffused with
the deepest crimson, which in a mo-
ment was succeeded by a pallid hue.
" You did not answer me; I asked:
whether any news had arrived from
Gibraltar." Yes," said the Doctor,
and most satisfactory; and to that do
I in great measure attribute the sud-
den favourable turn in the disease.'
" Well, and is the ingrate likely to
obtain his liberty through the inter-
cession of his friend? I have forgot-
ten the gentleman's name," said the
physician's lady in any enquiring tone
of voice."

Doctor; " and from what I under-
stand, has been severely punished for
the fault you reprobate."
"I reprobate !" surely, my dear
Doctor, every parent must do the
same. I ought to apologize, Sir," con-
tinued Mrs. L., turning to Captain
Eliott, " for entering upon a subject
in which you cannot take a part; but
the truth is, the lady in whose reco-
very I take so warm an interest is my
particular friend, and the dangerous
illness under which she labours has
been entirely brought on by the undu-
tiful, I may say, bur barous conduct, of
a boy on whom she doated to excess.'
Mrs. L- then described the various
proofs of maternal fondness which the
ingrate (as she termed bim) from his
very infancy had received from his too
partial parent; and concluded by saying,
that if ever the Runaway returned to

England, he should never enter her
doors.
My young readers may form some
idea of the sensations Richard Riving-
ton must have experienced whilst at-
tentively listening to the preceding
conversation : though they can have
but an imperfect one of the various
emotions which agitated his labouring
heart: conscience, that never-failing
monitor, it is true, had reproached
him for his undutiful conduct to the
best of mothers ; yet he had never
imagined it would have brought upon
him universal censure and contempt.
When Mrs. L-declared he should
never enter her hospitable mansion, a
mixture of indescribable sensations in-
duced him to rise from his seat; and
though he could not repress the start-
ing tear, with a manly dignity he ap-
proached her, and apologized for hav-

ing forced himself into her society
under a feigned name.
" Most sensibly, Madam," said he,
" do I feel the censure you have passed
upon me; and have only to hope that
my future conduct will convince you
I am not so depraved a being as you
imagine: a desire of seeing the world,
without reflecting upon the misery that
desire would occasion my dear mo-
ther, induced me to yield to the perni-
cious council of Gennings; but I saw
the impropriety of my conduct when
it was too late to retrieve it, and se-
verely have I felt the consequences of
it."
So completely astonished was Mrs.
1 at the unexpected discovery,
and so vexed with herself for having
condemned the culprit in such 'severe
terms, that some moments elapsed
without any reply being made to the

self-condemned Richard, who in the
mean time asked Captain Eliott if he
was ready to depart.
Though I can scarcely credit the
evidence of my senses," said Mrs.
L-, recovering herself, yet you
doubtless must be the son of
my friend;
and though I certainly would not have
wounded your feelings by expressing
my real sentiments, had I recognized
your person, yet not a single word do I
wish to retract; but permit me to add,
that as you seem so truly sensible of the
impropriety of your conduct, I shall
never mention the subject again, and
no longer wish to prevent you from re.
newing your intimacy with Henry,
after the sentiments I have heard you
express.
Henry, who had arose from his seat
the moment Richard approached the
lady of the mansion, at this declara-

tion of his mother's, rushed forwards,
exclaiming, "My dear, dear Riving-
'ton, how happy am I to welcome your
return! I have not been able to take
my eyes from you the whole evening, ,
fancying in your countenance I traced
the features of an old friend; yet the
change in your complerion and voice,
united to the idea of your being in cap-
tivity, made me fancy the resemblance
must have been merely idea."
Richard not only returned the salu-
tation of his young friend with that
warmth natural to his disposition ; but
approaching Mrs.L-, said he should
endeavour to profit by the knowledge
he had accidentally obtained of her
sentiments, and endeavour to convince
her it was possible for an undutiful to
become'a dutiful son.
Captain Eliott, who had listened to
Mrs. L's animadversions on his

young favourite's conduct with the
most painful emotions, undertook his
defence by pleading the force of exam-
ple, and the effect of persuasion ; and
concluded by saying, it was the duty
of every parent to prevent their chil-
dren from forming improper connec-
tions. " Mrs. Rivington," continued
the Captain, '" ought, in the first in-
stance, to have checked all intimacy
with her son and a boy in such an infe-
rior station of life; but when once a
mother merely studies the present gra-
tification, instead of the future good of
her children, she must take upon her-
self the consequences. Yet do not
suppose I mean to exculpate your con-
duct," said he, turning to Richard ;
no, young man, far from it; it was
degrading, deceptious, and undutiful ;
but the effects it produced have been a
sufficient punishment, and I hope and

trust it will prove a lesson to you
through the whole course of your ex-
istence."
The party soon afterwards separated,
and the two travellers returned to the
Castle; but what was their astonish-
ment at seeing near twenty persons sur-
round them as they entered the yard,
exclaiming, " Thank God, Master Ri-
vington, you are safely returned !"
Honest Martha, it seems, in the ful-
ness of her joy, had been to the
Castle to give particular orders her
young master's bed might be properly
aired ; and as the greater part of the
inhabitants of Windsor had believed
him to be buried in the bosom of the
ocean, the landlord heard the account
of his resuscitation with a sort of in-
credulous pleasure; and some trades-
men whom Mrs. Rivington dealt with,
being in the bar when Martha gave

the unexpected intelligence of her
young master's arrival, determined to
wait for the purpose of giving him a
hearty welcome. In the person of one,
Richard recognized his mother's butcher,
in that of another, her baker, &c. &c.
and expressed his sense of the compli-
ment they paid him in the most grate-
ful terms. Captain Eliott, perceiving
that not any of the party had been
guilty of an excess in drinking, desired
the landlord to furnish them with a half-
guinea bowl of punch, that they might
celebrate the Runaway's return.
The mind of Richard was too much
agitated for him to enjoy a tranquil
repose, and at six o'clock on the
following morning he dressed himself
and walked to his mother's house; but
observing the windows still closely bar-
ricadoed, he felt a strong inclination
to revisit his old haunts, and directing

his course towards Eton, who should
he accidentally encounter but the object
of his former aversion, Maclean. The
young man's attention was so deeply
engaged by a book he was perusing,
that he passed the hero of my story
without even seeing him; but the mo-
ment after, not perceiving a drain,
recently made for the purpose of letting
off the water, he stepped into it, and
struck his shin against the edge of a
large stone.
Though Richard had experienced a
secret satisfaction at not having been
recognized by his former schoolfellow,
whom it must be remembered behaved
most tyrannically toward him, yet the
moment he saw him fall, he flew
towards him, saying, " I''hope you,
have not hurt yourself, Sir?" Reiter-
ated groans were the only replies made
to the inquiry, for several moments-

247
whilst the anxious youth knelt by the
side of the extended sufferer, and re-
quested to know whether he could not
offer him any assistance.
" Thank you, thank you !" said
Maclean, recovering himself a little ;
" but I fear you have not strength suf-
ficient. My leg is evidently broken,
and the excessive pain prevented me
from replying to your interrogations."
" I scarcely know how to leave
you," replied the agitated Richard ;
yet had I not better fly and fetch the
servants ? they can assist you better
than I can; and I will afterwards, if
you think proper, fetch Mr. D-
the surgeon." " Do you know me,
then ?" said the agonized young man,
gazing attentively upon his former
schoolfellow. --- Yes, I do know, and
shall never forget you," said Richard,
in a tone of kindness, rot of censure or-

sarcasm; "but only tell me shall I
stay with you, or fly to the college ?"
" Go, I intreat you," replied Maclean,
" for the pain I suffer is intolerable."
The hero of my story was at the doc-
tor's house in less than five minutes;
and returned in nearly the same space
of time, accompanied by two servants,
who by his direction brought a mat-
tress. He then breathless ran for a
surgeon, intreating the servants not to
attempt moving the sufferer until Mr.
D- gave directions in what man-
ner he was to be carried.,
As Richard approached the sur-
geon's door, he perceived him just in
the act of mounting his horse; he
sprang forward, vociferating his name
in loud accents, and of course stopped
bis progress. Mr. D- neither re-
collected the person or voice of Ri-
chard, but supposing him to be a total

stranger to Mr. Maclean, complimented
him upon the humanity of his conduct;
though each walked, or rather ran,
with too much swiftness to admit of
much conversation passing.
The fracture proved a compound
one; and the bone had broke in
such an oblique direction as to form
a perfect point, which had actually
forced a passage even through the
stocking. As Richard had informed
the surgeon that his assistance was
required immediately to a gentleman
with a broken leg, he ordered the ser-
vant who was holding the horse for him
to desire his pupil to follow immedi-
ately, and to bring the proper appara-
tus with him for setting the dislo-
cated limb, and he arrived in a few
minutes after his master. The spot
where this unfortunate accident hap-
pened was about a quarter of a mile:

from the Doctor's house; therefore te
remove a person that distance suffering
acute torture required a mixture of
tenderness and judgment.
Mr. D--- gave the supposed stran-
ger great credit for having ordered a
mattress to be brought, but declared a
more firm support would be necessary;
and espying at a short distance a sheep-
fold, ordered one of the servants to
fetch a hurdle, upon which the mat-
tress was placed, and the patient laid
upon
it with all possible gentleness.
By this time three of the assisting mas-
ters of Eaton, accompanied by several
of the head boys, arrived, not only to
offer their services, but to testify their
concern. The cavalcade moved slowly
on, and the sufferer bore the motion
with as much fortitude as could be ex-
pected; and when they arrived within
a few yards of his dwelling, he intreat-

ed some person to go forward and ap-
prize Dr. Hof the circumstance,
lest he should accidentally see the par-
ty approaching, and fancy the accident
even more dreadful than it was.
This attentive precaution, however,
proved unnecessary, for one of the
female servants had made her mistress
acquainted with what had happened,
and Richard at that moment seeing
her approaching, exclaimed, "Oh, Sir,
there is Mrs. He !" "You know
Mrs. H-- then, young gentleman, it
seems ?" said the surgeon, "and
though I most days see the family, I
have not the slightest recollection of
your features." Richard's countenance
was suffused with crimson at this ob-
servation, but before he had time to
reply to it, the lady. in question ap-
proached Maclean, and expressed her
concern for the pain under which he
or and yet,

laboured with as much tenderness as if
he had been her son. At this moment
Richard approached the surgeon for
the purpose of informing him, that as
his services did not appear necessary,
he
would take his leave; adding, that he
would send a servant in the evening
to inquire after the young gentleman's
health. Then hastening to his mo-
ther's house, his first inquiry was how
she had passed the night.

It has been observed by some judicious
author, that adversity invariably soft-
ens or hardens the natural turn of the
human mind; and, fortunately for the
hero of my story, it produced the for-
mer effect; for had he been fostered
in the lap of bis too indulgent parent,

and had all his childish whims and ca-
prices gratified, he would (in all proba-
bility) have become a proud, over-bear-
ing, and unamiable man; and instead of
proving a comfort to his mother and an
ornament to society,destroyed the hap-
piness of the one, and been held by the
other in detestation or contempt.
It has been proved that an ciety of
mind was the sole cause of the indispo-
sition under which Mrs. Rivington
laboured, and that being removed by
the unexpected appearance of the ob-
ject who had occasioned it, she felt
herself comparatively well; gave di-
rections to Martha to order the car-
riage at an early hour the next morn-
ing, for the purpose of fetching the
children, who were at school about
four miles distant, and then retiring to
rest, she enjoyed a more refreshing
sleep than she had experienced since
the departure of her son..

255
The anxious Richard, understand-
ing his mother was awake, hastened to
her apartment, and alternately em-
braced her face and hands'; and whilst
tears of joy and affection trickled down
his sun-burnt features, repeatedly in-
quired whether she could ever forgive
him?
" If I could refuse you forgiveness,
my dear boy," said the fond mother,
" how could I presume to ask it from
that great Being whom we all daily
offend ? from my heart do I. pardon
and forgive you; only promise never
to leave me clandestinely again."
"Leave you clandestinely, my dear
mother!" he exclaimed emphatically
- Oh could you but know the re-
proaches with which conscience has
pierced my heart, you would not think
it possible for me ever to bear such a
thought. I am, it is true, no longer a

child; and it will be necessary for me
to follow some profession or pursuit;
but whatever may be my own inclina-
tions, I will scrupulously be directed
by your wishes and advice."
In conversation like this hours
passed like moments, until the arrival
of Captain Eliott summoned Richard
from the side of his mother's bed ; for
until his name was mentioned, both
had actually forgot that he was left at
the inn.
The apology which Richard offered
for a breach of politeness was readily
accepted by his unceremonious friend,
whose affectionate heart warmly parti-
cipated in those sensations which both
mother and son must have experi-
enced; but when he was made ac-
quainted with the assistance Richard
had afforded his former persecutor, he
clapped him upon the shoulder, ex-

claiming, " That was nobly done! Yet
(continued he) do not suppose I think
there was any thing very meritorious in
the action, for none but a sacage could
have refused to lend assistance in such
a case of distress; still the feeling
manner in which you have related the
circumstance convinced me that your
heart is incapable of harbouring the
degenerate passions of resentment and
revenge; and I should not be surprised
if you and Maclean were to become
sworn friends.
"I entirely forgive him, Sir;" replied
Richard, "but never can forget his
conduct; for though I am persuaded
it is as necessary for the junior boys in
a public school to be in a certain de-
gree subservient to their seniors, as it
is for them to go regularly through
the classics, yet the latter ought nei-
ther to forget the disproportion of years

there is between them, or unfeelingly
to act the part of tyrants."
" And did you never act that part
with
your
brothers' inquired Cap-
tain Eliott, smiling, yet wholly unac- .
quainted with the overbearing disposi-
tion of his young friend before he went
to Eton. A crimson glow overspread
his features, and the force of a reprov-
ing conscience kept him entirely mute.
"Oho!" exclaimed the Captain, in a
still more jocose accent,
" the thorny
helmet exactly fits the head, and
you feel it at this moment pricking
your temples ; is it not so, my young
friend?"
" It pricks my heart," replied Ri-
chard with evident emotion : " but
pray, Sir, who informed you I had been a
tyrant to my brothers ?.!! "I never
heard you had been such, neither can I
believe it possible, (replied the Cap-

259
tain) for that good-humoured counte-
nance does not seem formed for acting
the part of a Turk."
A loud ring at the street-door pre-
vented Richard from answering, and
instantly the feet of three or four chil-
dren were heard running up stairs ; the
door was instantly thrown open, and
Richard alternately pressed his bro-
thers and sister to his beating heart.
He easily recognized them, although
they were very much grown during
his absence; but they could scarcely
believe him to be their lost brother, so
great was the alteration produced by
the heat of climate upon his sun-burnt
features.
" How happy I am !" "How de-
lighted I am to see you, my dear, dear
brother!" were expressions momenta-
rily bursting from the lips of these ami-
able children; whilst the still more

agitated Richard could not restrain his
tears.
Captain Eliott remained some mi-
nutes a silent observer of the interest-
ing groupe, until Richard, whose na-
tural urbanity seldom forsook him,
first introduced his brothers Henry and
George, and then his sister Emma.---
In performing this act of politeness,
Richard remarked their sable appa-
rel, which until that moinent had
escaped his observation. " For whom
are you in mourning, my dear Emma?"
he inquired in an eager yet melancholy
tone.
"Oh dear, dear!for nobody," re-
plied the hesitating Emma: then throw-
ing her arms round the neck of her
astonished brother, she burst into a
flood of tears.
When the news of

death reached the ears of his afflicted

mother, the whole family, of course,
were put in mourning; but when Cap-
tain Eliott's first letter arrived, which
gave a hope of his being in existence,
Mrs. Rivington immediately changed
her apparel, and wrote to the gentle-
man and lady under whose care she had
placed her surviving children, to desire
they might likewise change theirs; but
the father of Mr. Morton (which was
the name of the clergyman to whose
protection the three children had been
entrusted) dying a few days afterwards,
the order was countermanded, as a
mark of respect to the family, and re-
gard to the memory of the deceased.
Honest Martha, who went in the
carriage to fetch the children, was so
eager to introduce them to their long-
lost brother, that she would not allow
time to make any alteration in their

appearance; and, in fact, it never
struck her that they were in mourning.
Richard so little imagined the real -
cause of his sister's agitation, that, re-
turning her embrace with equal ten-
derness, he again implored her to tell
him who was dead.  My dear, dear
Emma!" continued he, finding her still:
silent," why will you keep me in sus-
pense? besides, I cannot think which
of our relations you have reason to be-
wail so much !"
" We are in mourning for Doctor
Morton, brother," said Henry, sup-
pressing the tears-which started as he
Yes, yes, we are in mourn-
ing for Doctor Morton, dear Richard,"
rejoined the susceptible Emma, endea-
vouring to smile through her tears.
Richard evidently seemed to doubt the
truth of the assertion, but was pre-
spoke. "

vented from expressing his sensations
by the entrance of the physician, who
had just been visiting his patient, and
declared he had found a surprising
amendment. The three children, hay-
ing paid their compliments to the Doc-
tor, hastened to their mother's
apart-
ment, and with tears of joy congratu-
lated her upon the arrival of their long-
lost brother.
" But oh!: mamma," exclaimed
Emma, " how sorry I am we did not
change our dress; for my brother
asked who we were in mourning for,
and I knew not what reply to make;
for though we continued to wear it for
Doctor Morton, you know it was put
on when you heard the account of the
Speedwell being wrecked; and when he
suddenly put the question to me, I felt
as if my heart would break."
" It was very inconsiderate of Mrs.

Morton to suffer you to appear in the
trappings of woe upon so joyful an
occasion," replied Mrs. Rivington';
" when she might naturally suppose
that, like the father of the prodigal son
in the Scriptures, I should kill the fat-
ted calf, in commemoration of the
return of a beloved son, who was
dead, and is alive again; who was lost,
and is found.'"
-- You must blame Martha, not Mr.
Morton," rejoined Emma; " for, she
would hardly suffer a change of clothes
to be put into the trunk, so anxious
was she for us to see my brother, and
so fearful you should want her assist-
ance before she returned : yet pray,
mamma, do not be angry with her, for
I am sure she entirely forgot we were
in black.'

to see the preserver of your dear bro-
ther's life, for as such I shall ever con
sider Captain Eliott."
An easy mind and refreshing sleep
had produced such an alteration in the
appearance of Mrs. Rivington, that
Captain Eliott could scarcely believe
it to be the same person he had been
introduced to the preceding evening;
and the party were attentively listen-
ing to Richard's recital of his adven-
tures, when the footman announced Mr.
Gennings The honest man was dressed
in deep mourning, and approaching
Mrs. Rivington said, " I humbly
beg pardon, Madam, for the liberty I
have taken; but hearing as how the
young 'squire had been preserved as it
were by a miracle, I could not help

wishing to set my eyes upon him,
thinking as how he is the only one who
can tell me the rights of my poor son
Jack ! He was my own flesh and blood,
Madam,"continued he, in a voice almost
choaked by sensibility; "and if he
warn't what he should be, the more my
mishap. I bless God, he had a good
example set before him, and I am sure
I have prayed night and day that he
might amend! Yet to have him cut
off in that way, Madam, as one may
say, like the snuff of a candle; and
just with all his faults upon his head;
it is that which grieves both me and
his poor mother, even more than the
loss of him."
Here the poor man's feelings com-
pletely stopped his utterance, and lean-
ing his elbow upon the table, and hiding
his face with his hand, he remained si-
lent for some minutes, and no one pre-

of sympathy destroyed the power of
speech. Captain Eliott, who had been
pacing the room, and endeavouring to
conquer that emotion which the art-
less bewailing of the honest carpenter
had produced, approached him with
an air of kindness, saying, "Recollect,
my worthy fellow, that we must submit
to the Almighty's will. The loss of a
child, I allow, is a severe trial; one of
the severest human nature can sustain;
yet what a delightful prospect does
Christianity lay before us, by assuring
us that the nearest and dearest con-
nexions will meet again !-Meet in
those mansions of bliss where neither
winds nor waves can separate them,
and where they will jointly participate
in the purest delights !"

tiently submit to the Almighty's will."
" Then you may be certain of that,
Mr. Gennings !" exclaimed Richard
hastily, rising from his seat, and throw.
ing his arm over the worthy carpen-
ter's shoulder, whilst tears of commise-
ration rolled rapidly down his cheeks.
"God Almighty bless you for this
piece of intelligence !" exclaimed the
attached parent, clasping Richard in
his arms as he uttered the benediction,
and pressing him closely to his agitated
breast. Near two hours passed away
rapidly, whilst Richrd was relating to

count of the loss of the Speedwell, from

the moment of her quitting Gibraltar
to her becoming a wreck; when the
poor man took his leave with many
expressions of gratitude for the "relief
which his kind communicator had
afforded his anxious mind.
The intelligence of Richard's unex-
pected return soon circulated through
Windsor, and Mrs. Rivington's door
was thronged with congratulatory
friends; but as Doctor L had
assured her her nerves were neither in
a state to bear agitation nor company,
some days elapsed before any were
admitted.
We will now return to the young
gentleman towards, whom Richard had
displayed so much humanity, who for
several hours had suffered as acute
agony as it is possible for a human
being to have felt. The bone, it
has been observed, had forced itself

Though Mr. D-- was not only very
skilful, but very eminent in his profes-
sion, yet as a great degree of fever
instantly succeeded the accident, he
intreated Dr. H--would oblige him
by calling in Sir James Earle, or Mr.
Clyne. The former gentleman, as re-
siding at the west end of the metropo-
lis, was fixed upon; and a servant dis-
patched with the utmost speed, not-
withstanding which, it was near nine in
the evening before that celebrated sur-
geon arrived. Mr. D, through-
out the whole day, had scarcely quit-
ted his suffering patient, during which
time he had been indefatigable in his
endeavours to reduce the swelling ;
which, instead of yielding to various
applications, hourly increased. A short

time before Sir James arrived, Mr.
D--- was sent for to a patient, and
then heard the news of Richard's ar-
rival; and from the same lady learnt
that he had been the person who had
displayed so much humanity towards
Maclean.--Upon returning to Eton,
and finding that young gentleman
rather easier, he said, "You were de-
sirous some little time back of know-
ing the name of the young stranger to
whom you were so much indebted this
morning; but the pain you endured,
I suppose, prevented you from recog-
nizing an old acquaintance, for such he
proves, I assure you, though I had not
the slightest recollection of him.'
"An acquaintance!" repeated the in-
valid in a tone of astonishment."Yet
now you name him as such, I recol-
lect he said he knew me; do, dear Sir,

inform me who he is; I hope he has
not left Windsor, for I wish personally
to express my gratitude for his huma-
nity and kindness."
Will you believe me if I tell you it
was young Rivington ?" enquired the
surgeon. "No, on my honour, (re-
pied Maclean)." for in the first place,
the young gentleman who displayed
so much kindness towards me is at
least ten shades darker than Rivington,
and much taller than it is possible for
him to be, even allowing for growth;
besides, Sir, we were never partial to
each other; and instead of rendering
me assistance, I believe he would have
seen me die for want of help."

assure you," rejoined the surgeon ;

apartment, without waiting to hear the
sufferer's reply. Doctor H- and the
two medical gentlemen soon entered
the sick chamber : the former atten-
tively watched the countenances of the
two latter, whilst examining the limb;.
and felt his heart sicken with appre-
hension at the intelligent looks which
passed between them. During this
process, the groans, or rather shrieks, of
the agonized Maclean were dreadful;
and he repeatedly exclaimed, " I can-
not support this torture! Kill me at
once !

like this !"
Upon quitting the apartment, Sir
James informed the Doctor that ampu-
tation was the only chance the patient
had for existence; for the fracture was
so bad, there was little hope of the bones
uniting; and there was every reason to
expect mortification, as the gross habit
of the young man's body had produced
a greater degree of fever than he had
ever witnessed in so short a space of
time. Mr. Dproposed deferring
the dreadful operation until morning,
and continuing soothing applications
during the night; but Sir James Earle
represented the little chance there was
of success crowning their endeavours,
and likewise declared he must be in
London the following morning pre-
cisely at nine; adding, at the same

time, he had no objection to sleeping
at Doctor Hs, and giving the pa-
tient a chance of avoiding pangs he
feared would be necessary until five
o'clock.
A bed was accordingly prepared for
that celebrated surgeon; instruments
for amputation sent for from Mr.
D-, who kindly offered to sit up
with his patient, accompanied by one
of his pupils. Fomentations and em-
brocations were resorted to, through
the whole of that memorable night;
and at four on the ensuing morning,
Mr.Dawoke Sir James for the pur-
pose of informing him every applica-
tion which had been resorted to un-

of opinion immediate amputation must:

close their eyes in slumber, and the
worthy head of it had never quitted
his pupil's bed-side ; he was, how-
cver, summoned from it into Sir
James's apartment, who intreated him
to take upon himself the painful office
of informing the patient of the abso-
lute necessity of immediate amputa-
tion. It has been observed that Mac.
lean was naturally of a tyrannical dis,
position, although he had artfully con
cealed that unamiable propensity from,
his superiors; yet in this young man
the adage that tyrants are generally
cowards was completely verified; for
the moment he heard the appalling
intelligence which the Doctor commu-
nicated, he uttered the most piercing
groans, declared he neither could, or
would submit to it; and in short, be-
haved like a perfect child.
Neither the convincing arguments

of the surgeons, or the urgent in-
treaties of his preceptor, for a length of
time could induce him to submit; and
until Sir James declared he had other'
patients waiting for him, and that he
must leave Eton before six, adding that
death in a few hours must be the con-
sequence of such obstinacy, that he
consented.
All the necessary apparatus had
been prepared the preceding evening.
The moment consent was given, the
painful operation commenced; but the
shrieks of the sufferer were so dreadful,
that every person but those in the
apartment actually ran out of thehouse.
The moment the limb was severed
from the body, the exhausted youth
fell into a swoon, and remained so long
in that state of insensibility, that even
the surgeons began to fear all was
over. During that period, however,

the veins and arteries had all been
taken up, and the proper dressings ap-
plied. The moment sense and feeling
returned an opiate was administered,
which fortunately produced the desired
effect.
Though the hero of my story had
twice called upon Mr. D-during
the day the accident happened, yet,
unable to leave his delighted parent,
(who could scarcely suffer him to be
absent from her ten minutes) he had
not extended his walk so far as Eton
;
but about ten o'clock on the following
morning he expressed a desire of pay-
ing his respects to his former master,
and at the same time personally enquir-
ing after Maclean's health. "I must,
my dear mother, (said he) expect to
receive those reproaches I so justly
merit, and therefore the sooner I en-
counter them, the sooner my mind

will be at ease: yet could the worthy
Doctor know how sincerely I repent
my past misconduct, I am persuaded
he would not add to the shame I
feel."
Richard, having obtained his mother's
permission, directed his steps towards
Eton by the most unfrequented streets;
but though his person was so much al-
tered, yet his dress had been so mi-
nutely described, that he had not pro-
ceeded twenty paces, when he even
heard the little boys in the street say.
ing to each other, " That is Master
Rivington! that is the young gentle-
man who ran away from school !"
Yes, and then he was shipwrecked,
and swallowed up by a great fish-aye,
and the fish was dragged on shore by
some Turks who happened to see it,
and

out!"
" Lack-a-daisy, Jack, I never

can believe that !" exclaimed another.
- But it is as true (replied Jack) as
that I stand here now; and more than
that, he was taken prisoner by the
prince on whose island the fish was
brought, and there he was loaded with
irons, and foreed to become a Mahome-
tot, for else they would have offed with
his head in a jiffee'; so, Lord bless ye,
he is no Christiannow, and never can
be, my father says; for gentlefolks in
them there parts are no more than you
or I are, so I think he has made a pretty
kettle of fish of it; he'll remember
what it is to run away, I warrant him;
but they say as how Jack Gennings
was at the bottom of all the mischief."
Richard's pride and indignation were
so completely wounded, that the first
idea which struck him was to give his
aceusers a good thrashing; but reason
coming to his aid, he recollected that

281
truth and falsehood were generally
blended, and that his own imprudence
had been the occasion of the censure
which had been passed upon him ; he
therefore quickened his pace,
deter-
mining never again to listen to any re-
marks which were made upon him:
yet he had not proceeded far, when he
heard some bricklayers' labourers say
to each other, " That's him! that's
him ! that's the Mahometot, that ran
away, and almost broke his poor mo-
ther's heart!--they say as how he could
not even larn his letters, and used to be
flogged almost every day; and so to keep
a whole jacket, the dunce resolved to
take to his heels."
"The bricklayers' remarks were even
more degrading than those which he
had heard the boys make; for Richard,
conscious of his own abilities, could not
support the idea of being thought a

dunce, even by those whose opinion he
held in the most contemptible light.--
The next person destined to wound
the feelings of my hero was the shop-
keeper who accompanied him in the
stage to London on the memorable
day of his flight. Ah, Master Ri-
chardson ! is it you?" he exclaimed in
a tone of astonishment; "Pray, Sir,
how do you do? Little did I think,
(continued the honest man, without
permitting Richard to return his salu-
tation) when I was in the stage with
you, what a sad trick you were going
to play your poor mamma, or I should
have made bold to stop your journey, I
assure you, young gentleman. Oh
Sir, Sir! what heart-rending pangs
you
occasioned your
fond mother! but
God Almighty has, I hope, spared you
to make her amends for all she suf
fered."

"I hope so too," replied Richard, ,

terruptions he reached the Doctor's
door. If, thought Richard, I have
met with these severe accusations from
those who had no right to condemn
my conduct, what am I to expect from
those who have ? How shall I be
able to encounter even the reproving
glances of my justly-offended precep-
tor after my treacherous conduct to
him? He paused some moments be-
fore he could obtain sufficient resolu-
tion to rap; but at length summoning
resolution, he gave the signal, and was
instantly let in. The Doctor was de-
scending the stairs as the door opened,
and instantly recognized his former
pupil. --" Rivington, I rejoice, sin-
cerely rejoice, to see you !" said he,

springing forward, and seizing him
affectionately by the hand.
for Your kindness overpowers me,
Sir," replied Richard;
" for I am
aware that I do not merit a reception
like this. I can say nothing, Sir, in
extenuation of my conduct, but assure
you that I have sincerely repented."
I believe it," rejoined the Doctor,
in the kindest accent; "we will bury
the past in oblivion, and only hope
that the future will be a complete com-
pensation for the fault: but come
with me; Mrs. H- will rejoice to
see you, as you always were one of her
favourites."
The reception Richard met with
from the lady of the mansion was
equally kind and gratifying to his sus-
ceptible heart; but how deeply was he
affected at the account she gave him
of the ill-fated Maclean! Though

Mr. Dbad desired the apartment
might be kept completely quiet, yet
when Richard expressed an earnest de-
sire of merely seeing him, the Doctor
said he would venture to infringe upon
the order, on condition Richard would
not address him. On tip-toe they
crept into the chamber, and silently
approached the bed; the invalid opened
his eyes at the same moment, and in a
feeble voice requested a little drink.-
Doctor H pointed to Richard to
conceal himself behind the curtain, at
the same time taking the cup out of
the nurse's hand, tenderly raised the
head of the poor sufferer, who eagerly
swallowed the beverage.
"I have been dreaming of Riving-
ton," said he to the doctor; "I wish, Sir,
you would be kind enough to send for
him, for I have often thought my be-
haviour to him might have been one

motive for his quitting Eton ; and I
should like to know whether that is, or
is not, to be added to my catalogue of
offences."
" I am persuaded not," replied the
Doctor; " but, my dear fellow, try
and compose yourself again ; every
thing depends upon quiet; and Sir
James Earle and Mr. D-both in-
treated you not to speak.
"I only wish to see Rivington, to
ask that one question: do, I intreat
you, send for him; my mind will be
more easy, I assure you, if you will
comply with this request."
" Well then, you shall see him (said
the Doctor,) for he happens to be in
the house; I will fetch him to you
immediately, only promise you will not
attempt to talk,"
Doctor Hthen quitted the bed,

few moments, saying, "My dear Mac-

merely proceeded from the persuasions
of Gennings, who represented a sea-
faring life in such glowing colours,
that this Runaway fellow was desir-
pus of tasting the sweets of it; though,
alas! it proved a bitter pill to swallow,
and a still harder one to digest."-
"s Let me conjure you not to talk, dear
Maclean," said Richard; "yet permit
me to assure you Gennings was the sole
occasion of my flight from the arms of
the tenderest of mothers, and the pro-
tection of the best of friends: I will
only add, that I grieve to hear the ac-
cident proved so dreadful in its conse-
quences, but hope every hour will
lessen your sufferings."

mind is relieved by the declaration
which you have just made. Let me
see you to-morrow, dear Rivington,
when, perhaps, I may be more able to
speak:-if not, God Almighty bless
you for the humanity you displayed
towards me." But I have the pleasure
of informing my young readers that
Maclean's fears of not seeing his old
schoolfellow again were happily erro-
neous, for the fever gradually abated,
and in six weeks he was able to quit
his bed. The hero of my story could
not avoid drawing a comparison be.

duced from an apparently trifling ac-
cident, and his own various and mira-
culous escapes. Whilst his thoughts
dwelt upon these circumstances, his
heart naturally glowed with gratitude
towards his divine Protector; and he
secretly formed the pious resolution

never to be guilty of a single action
that could disgrace an existence which
had been so mercifully preserved. -
The resolutions then formed were most
scrupulously attended to; and if ever
he felt an inclination in the slightest
instance to deviate from the path of
rectitude, he recalled to mind the
pe-
culiar care which Providence had dis-
played towards him in his miraculous
preservation.
At the request of Mrs. Rivington,
Captain Eliott consented to pass a few
days at Eton before he joined his regi-
ment, and during that period, took an
opportunity of making that attached
mother acquainted with the secret
hopes and desires of her son.
Richard, during the Speedwell's re-
maining in the Straits of Gibraltar,
had imbibed no small portion of mili-
tary ardour :-the social life the offi-

cers passed in the garrison, and the
enthusiastic manner in which they de-
scribed the gratification to be derived
from deeds of heroism and valour, made
such a deep impression upon his youth-
ful imagination, that even the degrada-
tion of captivity could not repel its
force; and when employed in the me-
nial office of a gardener, he would
shoulder his shovel or present his rake.
During his voyage from Gibraltar, he
was constantly conversing with his
companion upon military subjects, and
declaring, that though he was deter-
mined to follow whatever profession
his mother directed, yet as a soldier he
could only expect to enjoy real hap-
piness.
Law was the profession Mrs. Riving-
ton had always expressed a wish her
sou should follow; but its dry study
was uncongenial to a mind like Ri-

chard's; and Captain Eliott, at his re-
quest, kindly undertook to persuade
her to gratify his ambitious desires. He
took the opportunity of introducing
the subject in Dr. H-'s presence,
to whom he had previously imparted
the young man's hopes and fears; and
as he had kindly promised to use his
influence with the lady, the two
friends of the hero of my story com-
menced a regular siege. The Captain
represented his young favourite as
formed by nature to adorn a profession
in which personal bravery and magna-
nimity were essential requisites ; and
the Doctor produced a variety of ex-
amples of the evil consequences which
bad arisen from parents thwarting
their children's inclination in a point
where their future happiness and pros-
perity might be said to depend.

The two champions of Richard had
judiciously introduced the subject dur-

turned much sooner than they ima-

tived, or given her consent.
Though just restored to, I find

venture to say, without offending the
present company, the whole universe
can scarcely produce his equal."
" But it is in the army alone, my
dear mother, that I can imitate his glo-
rious conduct, and prove myself wor-
thy of bearing his exalted name;
nevertheless, my dearest mother, if
you do not heartily concur with my
wishes, I will never mention the sub-
ject again ; and if Doctor H  will
condescend to receive me as his pupil,
I will study law, physic, or divinity."
" That is nobly resolved ;" said the
Doctor, clapping Richard upon the
shoulder. "I must not be out-done
in generosity or sentiment," rejoined
Mrs. Rivington, at the same time
rising, and reaching a sword out of an
escrutoire " Take that, my son, it

* Richard received the precious relic
with the liveliest emotion, and gazing
upon it with eyes overflowing with
tears said, in a voice half choaked
with emotion, " This precious boon,
my dear mother, will speak volumes to
my heart !"-then, pressing her 'hand
to his bosom, he hurried out of the
room to conceal his tears.
The future plan of my young hero's
life being fixed upon, and his guar-
dians' consent easily obtained; it was
determined that he should be sent to
the military school at Marlow, for a
couple of years. .

made her, and became one of the most
dutiful as well as one of the most af-
fectionate of sons.
