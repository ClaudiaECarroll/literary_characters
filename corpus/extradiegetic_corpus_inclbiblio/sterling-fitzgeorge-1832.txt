CHAPTER I.
THE SYMPOSIUM.
After three hours spent at the toilet the Hon-
ourable Augustus Fitzgeorge took his station in
the drawing-room to receive his expected guests.
From many a long and lofty mirror was that
form reflected which he most of all admired,
which was the centre of his thoughts and the
pride of his life. There many an attitude was
studied, many a smile was practised, and many
a bow rehearsed. The doors were
and the Honourable Lionel Leppard was an-
rown open,

nounced. A brow of thought and a lip of smiles
were the bearing of Lionel, alike prepared for
fun or philosophy.
" This is as it should be," exclaimed Fitz-
george, pressing the hand of Leppard, with a
studied earnestness, till the guest thought his
host as sincere as himself; "the first in my
estimation to be the first in keeping his ap-
pointment."
Fitzgeorge, I give you joy on coming into
life and liberty; now you are at liberty to show
the world what life is."
" Here comes one," said Fitzgeorge, "who
needs not to be told what life is."
The Honourable Drury Borrowman was an-
nounced. A cordial pressure of the hand, and
a smile of courtly grace, seemed to say that his
presence was peculiarly acceptable. " Leppard
is telling me that I must show the world what
life is."
" Then," said Borrowman, " you will show
the world that life is a farce."

" That is your serious opinion?"
" Pardon me, but I am serious in nothing,
save in congratulating you on being liberated
from leading-strings and shoulders of mutton."
"And I," said Fitzgeorge, taking his two
friends by the hand," am never more serious
than when I congratulate myself on possessing
two such valuable and valued friends as Leppard
and Borrowman."
The eyes of Fitzgeorge glanced with gratified
pride around the splendid apartment which had
been furnished, finished and decorated under
his own immediate, minute, and incessant atten-
tion. Every article of use and of ornament had
not been merely chosen by himself, but its pat-
tern had been devised by his own exuberant
taste. His own individual genius had presided
over the industry and skill of the workmen:
there was not a single moulding that was not
familiar to his eye and imagination, for he had
devised or improved their form. It was his
pride to rejoice in the superb singularity of his

taste, and to stand alone as the mark and model
of exterior elegance. His eye was everywhere,
and his thoughts were constantly filled with
images of beauty; the activity of his mind was
occupied with devices of decoration and antici-
pations of luxury and homage. No man perhaps
ever practised less self-deception than he did
in matters of this nature, and in the general de-
sign and promise of life ;for he hesitated not to
avow it to himself that his design and hope were
to enjoy the luxuries and elegances of life to
their utmost attainable extent. He did not for
a moment pretend, either to himself or to any one
else, that he had any other ambition than to
enjoy the fulness of luxurious indulgence.
Though but a young man just come of age,
yet being of a high and ancient family, of great
expectations, and of political consequence and
influence, his friends were liberal in their homage
and lavish in their compliments. The dexterity
with which they could nourish vanity with the
fumes of flatterythe grace with which they

could gild over the grossness of sensuality-
the lightness with which they could laugh at the
vulgar restrictions, which bind inferior spirits,
rendered their society most acceptable to a
youth who had just burst the bondage of mi-
nority, and who felt that he had nothing to do
in life but to enjoy it. For the strictness of
early discipline, and the abstemiousness which
had been forced upon him in a state of pu-
pilage, gave a stimulus to the appetite for indul-
gence, and awakened the wanton pruriency of
imagination to devise all forms of luxury.
He was now beginning to realize the dreams
of his minority. What had been to him castles
in the air were coming to have a local habitation
and a name. This was the first party which
he had entertained in a mansion, that he could
call his own; and this party consisted of many
others than the two above named; but they
were all choice spirits, all in love with them-
selves, and joying in any acquisition to their
own equivocal sense of their importance, and it

was indeed an addition to their importance that
they shared the smiles of the gay and graceful
Fitzgeorge. There sat at his table wits, states-
men, and philosophers, men of thought and
men of thoughtlessness; it was a day of glad-
ness to Fitzgeorge, for it was a day of promise,
a bright harbinger of a brilliant and glorious
life. Every thing was as it should be; the
duties of the toilet had been supereminently
successful, the whole force of culinary science
had been developed, and the ars celare artem
had been carried to its utmost conceivable per-
fection. The banqueting-room, though not so
vast in its dimensions or so superb in its ap-
pointments as the halls of Sardanapalus or
Belshazzar, was not deficient in such deco-
rations as wealth could purchase, or as an ac-
tive imagination could devise. The genius of
Fitzgeorge, which reached to every part of his
mansion, and devised every form of its deco-
ration and accommodation, had been not inac-
tive in the hall of feasting. Pleased was the

luxurious young man to see the dazzled eyes
of his admiring guests diverted and distracted
between the table and the apartment. Happy
was he to see the well-trained servants, quick
as light and silent as shadows, move about
their ministrations. Both he and his guests
endeavoured to look as though there was
nothing extraordinary in the apartment or the
entertainment; but it was not easy to conceal
the admiration of the eye, however studiously
silent the tongue might be; and Fitzgeorge
knew that on the morrow his fame would be
spread, that fame in which he most delighted.
One bad feeling which sometimes subsists be-
tween the entertainer and the entertained had
no place at this meeting, there was no feeling
of jealous rivalry. The guests were not in a
situation to vie in splendour with their host
Augustus Fitzgeorge had it in his power to
select as companions and intimates the highest
of the high, who would have been proud of his
acquaintance, but he knew that they were also

proud of themselves, and he preferred such as
would sensibly feel the honour of his conde-
scension, such as would repay condescension by
flattery. As he was in his own rank high and
enviably distinguished, he was under no neces-
sity of seeking to derive clat from the rank or
opulence of those with whom he associated; he
selected his companions therefore from among
those who met his humour; who were distin-
guished for the brilliancy of their wit, the pro-
fundity of their talents, or the variety of their
acquisitions ; who would be agreeable at the
festive board, and who with all the visible ease
of acquaintanceship and familiarity could dex-
terously blend an essential servility, moral and
political. Being of age and past the restraints
of discipline, he had no wish to continue under
a voluntary vassalage, by placing around him-
self severe moralists, or men of formal, puri-
tanical habits. His very incompetence to govern
himself made him the more eager to be his own
master. The direction of his conduct being put

g
into his own hands, he felt disposed to keep it
there irresponsibly; for he thought, not unrea-
sonably, that when an individual is arrived at
years of discretion, there is little moral use,
though often much annoyance, in the reproofs
and censures to which the mind gives no echo.
He placed around him therefore those from
whom nothing of this kind was to be expected,
and his style of intercourse with them was such
as to admit of no farther familiarity than that
which he was pleased to allow; he guided them
with the reins of condescension, but he had a
quick eye
and a firm hand on the curb of arro-
gance, by which he prevented familiarity from
transgressing into an unpleasant impertinence,
and they knew well enough on what terms they
associated with him. They were happy to bask
in the sunshine of his prosperity, and to rejoice
in the light of his countenance. From him they
were prepared to take the tone of their morals,
their politics, their religion ;-or if they should
presume to differ from him, it would be merely

to sharpen their wits by discussion, not to con-
vince the mind by reasoning.
It was not, therefore, with any view of di-
rectly or indirectly reproving the epicurean pro-
pensities of his host, that Borrowman, whose
eyes twinkled with ecstacy over a glass of claret,
said, " Why is all the world so unanimous in
praise of temperance, and scarcely one solitary
logician has a single word to say in praise of
luxury?"
" Because," replied Fitzgeorge, " luxury
speaks for itself."
" But why is luxury reprobated ?"
" It is only reprobated when it is inacces-
sible."
" Not only, nor always so," said Leppard;
" there have been declaimers against luxury,
who have had the means of enjoying it."
They have been proud," said Borrowman,
" of the ingenuity with which they could make
the worse appear the better cause. Or perhaps
they have been stoics in the school and epi-

cureans at the table ; for it is no bad policy to
persuade those who are without luxuries that
indulgence is undesirable. The happiest con-
trivance of all is to represent luxury as a
sin."
" Methinks I see you, Borrowman," replied
Fitzgeorge, "delivering a homily against good
living."
" Do you think I could not keep my counte-
nance ?"
" I think
you could not get rid of your coun-
tenance, which would tell mightily against your
theory and interfere with the sanctity of your
homily."
" Yet I have seen a well-fed dignitary, of no
mean circumference, prosingly haranguing on
the merits of contentment and starvation, while
his half-fed curate was sitting in the desk be-
low, yawning from the emptiness of his own
stomach and the rector's head."
" Such a scene would bear dramatizing,"

answered Fitzgeorge, " were it not rather too
broad for farce."
" Not at all too broad for farce, or even for
serious comedy," said Leppard, " for they are
best qualified to impose upon others who have
not been imposed upon themselves."
" You think then that a man can speak best
in praise of temperance, who is not convinced
by his own arguments ?"
They are the best logicians," replied Lep-
pard, " who can convince others by arguments
which do not convince themselves."
" But will not a man speak most effectually
on any topic when he himself is convinced of
the soundness of his cause and the truth of his
own theory ?"
" So far as passion is concerned a man may
speak more persuasively, but so far as logic is
concerned he will not speak more convincingly
for any confidence he may have in the sound-
ness and truth of his cause. For when an in-

dividual is fully possessed with the idea of the
truth of a theory or the justness of a principle
he is not so aware of its weak points as one who
is not so convinced."
" For that reason, then," said Fitzgeorge,
"litigants intrust their defence more wisely to
other hands than their own."
They do so: and an advocate can do the
best for his cause, when he is fully aware of its
weakness."
My good friends," said Borrowman, starting
from a reverie, and filling his glass, "your whole
argument is not worth an argument; the truth
lies in a nutshell; our senses tell us that we like
what we like, and our reason tells us that we
like what we dislike."
" You are right," said Fitzgeorge, " and one
of the finest illustrations of your remark may be
found in Cicero's Tusculan Questions. Few
men have had a greater dread of death than he
had; he died at last like a coursed hare, almost
with mere fright:--and yet he has written one of

FITZGEORGE.
the most ingenious arguments imaginable, to
prove
that death is not an evil. I believe it is
the very first of the Tusculan Questions. So
far as reasoning goes, he has proved his point;
but he convinces nobody, and most clearly he
did not convince himself."
Might he not have written that disquisi-
tion," asked Leppard," to exhibit his ingenuity
in proving to others that which he did not be-
lieve himself?"
"What he might have done," replied Fitz-
george, " I cannot say; but I am decidedly of
opinion that the whole argument, from begin-
ning to end, was but a vain endeavour to re-
concile himself to that which he knew to be
unavoidable. He whistled aloud to keep his
courage up. If you have ever read the dying-
speeches of criminals, you will find them almost
uniformly reconciled to death; but the recon-
ciling power has been despair. Cicero would
not have died to this hour, if he could have
helped himself."

" You must acknowledge," said one of the
party, addressing himself to Fitzgeorge, " that
there is great beauty in his Treatise on Old
Age."
" Certainly; and great ingenuity of reason-
ing: but it is precisely of the same nature, and
upon the same principle, as the first of the Tus-
culan Questions, in which he endeavours to
prove
that death is not an evil. Being afraid of
death, he was of course alarmed at the approach
of old age; but as it was unavoidable, he at-
tempted to persuade himself that it was not an
evil."
"Was there much insincerity in the character
of Cicero ?" said the person who had asked the
last question.
"I should be sorry to think so," said Lep-
pard, " because I regard him as the model of
a highspirited Whig."
"You sympathize with his oratorical powers,"
said Fitzgeorge, "and love Whiggery because
it rules by eloquence."

"Are you not with us yourself?"
" As a matter of party, I am," replied Fitz-
george, "but not as a matter of principle; if
Lord Fitzgeorge were a Whig, I should be a
Tory; but as Lord Fitzgeorge is a Tory, I am a
Whig."
" You treat yourself unjustly," said Leppard,
"in accusing yourself of want of principle."
" Pray let us have no talk about principle,"
said Borrowman," we shall grow stupid if we
get on that topic. Fitzgeorge has as much
principle as any one elseI very much like his
principle, too, of enjoying life while it lasts."
" That I believe," said Fitzgeorge, " is a
point on which few differ in reality; and when
men rail in good set terms at indulgence, it is
because they love it, and cannot attain it. So
the good things of life have the suffrage of all,
of those who praise, and of those who vitu-
perate them; and he at last is the only truly
honest man who enjoys them as heartily and as
much as he can."

There was sitting at the table one who never
sat there again, a pale and studious-looking
young man, who had in the world a reputa-
tion for philosophic. acuteness and dialectic
dexterity; it was the same that had ventured
an opinion on the beauty of Cicero's Treatise
on Old Age; Fitzgeorge wished to draw him
out, and to extract amusement from his philo-
sophy. " Come, philosopher, as the topic is
luxury, let us have the benefit of your opinion."
The wine was mounting the philosopher's
head, and was, by its inspiration, rendering
him rather more philosophical than usual, cer-
tainly more eloquent or voluble. Forgetting,
or not considering, the character and disposition
of his host, he replied, "If, sir, you ask my
opinion of luxury, you must permit me, with
great freedom of speech, to utter my opinion
according to the best of my poor judgment and
ability."
Fitzgeorge gave a significant look to Borrow-
man, and replied to the philosopher, "Speak
## p. 18 (#30) ##############################################

FITZGEORGE.
freely, my dear fellow; freedom is the soul of
philosophy."
" Then, sir," resumed the philosopher,--with
a slowness of utterance which was partly the
result of formality, and partly produced by a
consciousness that his tongue might trip if it
were hurried," of luxury I must say, having
observed human nature with great attention,
that whatever be the quantum of enjoyment in
any man's life, whether that enjoyment be
mental or bodily, in proportion to his enjoyment
will be his suffering, of one kind or other. Our
pleasures come from our pains, and our pains
are the parents of our pleasures. Those pains
are the most acute which are the consequence
of our pleasures, and those pleasures are the
most poignant which are the result of our
pains. Therefore, I opine, that they who seek
for pleasure through the medium of luxury,
though they may fancy that they enjoy pleasure,
yet provide for themselves afterwards an un-
easiness or pain which counterbalances the
## p. 19 (#31) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE.
19
pleasures of their indulgence. Nature will not
be cheated, she has provided a certain quantity
of pleasure and a certain quantity of pain for
us all, which we can neither increase nor dimi-
nish."
:"Amen," said Fitzgeorge, "a very capital
sermon !"
" But permit me to proceed."
Oh, no, no; you have given us a most ex-
cellent homily," said Fitzgeorge; " you shall
take orders, and Lord Fitzgeorge will give you
a living. You shall be his domestic chaplain."
Fitzgeorge then ordered the table to be
cleared of the glasses and decanters, and di-
rected that others of a different construction
should supply their place. Each guest was
furnished with glasses that had no feet, and
could only be held in the hand; while globular
decanters also that could not stand, but must
of necessity pass from guest to guest, were set
moving round the table.
" Come, Mr. Philosopher," exclaimed Fitz-

george, " taste the present pleasure, and leave
the future pain to chance."
"I contend," said the philosopher," that
there is no such thing as chance. There is a
concatenation of causes and effects eternally
held together by the great chain of necessity."
" Pardon me, my good sir," said Fitzgeorge,
interrupting him; " but I must beg that you
will not interfere with the concatenation of
causes and effects by holding the decanter eter-
nally in your hand.".
" Pardon me," said the philosopher in reply,
but I was thinking.
" Thinking !" exclaimed Borrowman," how
can you think of thinking in such good com-
pany as this ?"
" Your business," said Fitzgeorge to the phi-
losopher, "should rather be to make us think.
Come, pass the bottle."
The philosopher did so, and the bottle came
round to him again and again so rapidly, that
it bewildered his faculties. Nor was it only

one who suffered ; the lights danced and
twinkled, the room reeled to many eyes, the
tongues of many that had been comparatively
silent were let loose, and there was a loud and
manifold talking; and with a natural instinct
all the talkers addressed their discourse to
their host. In their cups, however, there was
not a total oblivion of the dignity of their en-
tertainer: they addressed him freely and fami-
liarly, but not without a consciousness that in
so doing they were taking a liberty which in
a state of perfect sobriety they would not have
presumed upon.
Now there was eloquence
from every tongue, and there was pathos in every
tone ;-smiles and tears, wit and wisdom, pro-
fanity and piety, indecency and fastidiousness,
politeness and rudeness, keenness and stupidity
all were blended together in a babbling chaos
from whence no light or order could be extracted.
Attempts were made at consecutive discourse,
.but every attempt failed. The continuity of
thought was broken in every mind, and no two

eyes in the whole party could look for two
minutes steadily and steadfastly on one object.
Hands were stretched out to bespeak atten-
tion, but no attention could be given, because no
one was conscious of the movement save the
individual who made it; voices were raised
louder and louder one above another, but such
was the disorder, they scarcely knew each man
his own voice. The decanters which were made
not to stand, were compelled to lie downsome
on the floor, and some on the table, and some
on seats deserted by their living occupants;
the glasses that lacked feet soon lacked legs also,
and in shining fragments lay scattered here and
there. A cloudy and misty recollection of the
various topics that had been discussed during
the symposium still hovered about the recol-
lection of some few of the party, and curious
were the fragments of philosophic observation
or witty remark which occasionally were blurted
forth by those, whose tongues yet retained the
power of articulation. Seated on the ground,

between two chairs, Borrowman still murmured
forth his pungent witticisms, as the wounded
soldier on the routed field lies firing at inter-
vals the musket which he has barely strength
to hold, but not steadiness to direct.
By the assistance of the domestics the party
were separated and removed each to his respec-
tive residence; but oblivion had crept upon them
before they parted, and they knew not how they
reached their homes.

CHAPTER II.
THE NEXT MORNING.
As it is morning all day long on some part
of the globe or other, so it is morning all day
long to some individuals or others in society.
Fitzgeorge's morning commenced at half-past
two o'clock P. M., when he awoke with a
burning headache and a confused recollection.
His first thought and greatest fear was, that in
the familiarity of his symposium he had com-
promised his dignity, and had suffered greater
license of speech, than the distance in rank
between himself and some of his guests would
warrant. By degrees his memory grew more

25
clear, the events of the preceding day stood
more distinctly before his recollection, and he
surveyed them not with perfect satisfaction.
He was not well pleased with the language
of the philosopher who had contended for the
equality of human enjoyment, and for the
powerlessness of man over his own destiny.
" I have health and strength," said he to
himself; " I have the hopes and appetites of
youth. I have more in possession than most
young men, far less to desire than any of my
companions. There is not one with whom I
would change placesthere are many who
would willingly change places with me. I have
wealth to purchase every conceivable luxury, I
have rank to command good society, I have
manners and address to pass well in the world.
I love homage, and can command it; for it is
an honour in the estimation of many to be in-
vited to my table, and it would be a punish-
ment to be banished from my society. I can
attract whomsoever I please to invite to my

society, and the moment that they become
disagreeable I can dismiss them again. If I
have political ambition, I can indulge myself
there, for I have political influence. I can
command the artist and can enjoy the arts. I
can exclude all that is disagreeable and I can
command all that is agreeable. Why then can
I not have a life of pleasure unmixed with
pain? What can prevent me from the fulness
of human enjoyment? What should that lean-
visaged man know of life and of its capacities?
I will have no more of his society ;-) will
hear no more of his raven talk. I will lay it
down as an invariable rule, never on any oc-
casion to be departed from, to get speedily rid
of every thing that annoys me, and to obtain at
any price whatever pleases or attracts me. I
will let my friends see that I can value and
reward compliance with my humours, and that
I can resent contradiction. I will enjoy the
pleasures of society and familiarity, but I will
not and need not compromise my dignity.
## p. 27 (#39) ##############################################

Many persons make themselves wretched by
neglecting to use vigorous and decisive measures
to rid themselves of annoyances. It shall not
be so with me. Decision does much for the
character in other respects, I will try what it
will do in the matter of enjoyment."
Thus did Fitzgeorge reason with himself,
and promise to himself the enjoyment of life. He
knew well enough that many moral writers had
abundantly and irrefragably proved that un-
mingled enjoyment is not the portion of huma-
nity; but he could not help thinking that there
might be an exception in some cases, and if
in any, surely in his: for he had advantages
that fall to the lot of few; he was above all
fear of poverty or disdain; wealth and honour
were his inheritance ;-he was the eldest son
and heir of Lord Fitzgeorge, a nobleman of
high character, of ancient family and distin-
guished opulence ; - he had been educated
with most consummate care; tutors of the high-
est character for moral and intellectual qualifi-

cations had been engaged to store his mind
with knowledge, and to develop the powers of
his understanding ;-an eye of the strictest
attention had watched over his morals, and as
his father and mother were remarkable for their
punctilious observance of the duties and deco-
rums of life, they were anxious and hoping
that their son might tread in their steps. As
the young man on coming of age was destined
to inherit a large fortune independent of his
parents, a double vigilance seemed necessary
to form him to such habits as should prevent
the dangers arising from almost unlimited means
of indulgence. He was therefore not initiated
into habits of luxury, but care was taken to
keep him from the society of such as might
have any injurious influence over his mind.
But it was impossible, and perhaps it was hardly
attempted, to keep flattery away from his eye
and ear. It was impossible for him, even in
his very earliest days, not to see that he was re-
garded as a person of some importance. The

strictness of the discipline under which he was
placed, the high character and high considera-
tion of his tutors, the anxiety which they mani-
fested for his improvement, the satisfaction
and delight which they so loudly and warmly
expressed at every indication of the success of
their efforts, all tended to impress on the mind
of Augustus Fitzgeorge that he was an individual
of more than ordinary importance. He saw in
very early youth that they who received homage
from others paid homage to him, and he thus
felt himself to be of a superior nature to those
by whom he was surrounded. The studious
frugality and plainness of his table, though
mortifying to his appetite, was gratifying to
his vanity; for though it was not a desirable
distinction, it was a distinction. He saw readily
and clearly enough that he was under no neces-
sity of struggling into notice and forcing his
way to eminence, for that by the very condi-
tion of his birth he was a person of conse-
quence. He soon understood that fortune was

waiting his acceptance, not proffered to his
diligence. Therefore, in the construction of those
arial castles, which are the favourite architec-
ture of youth, he was not devising means of
acquisition, but meditating modes of enjoy:
ment. He was abundantly pleased with the
consideration with which he was treated in a
state of pupilage, and he anticipated that not
less respect would be shown to him when arrived
at the state of manhood, but that the restraints
of minority would then be withdrawn. He re-
garded with equal distaste the plainness of his
table and the strictness of his moral superin-
tendance, and he anticipated with no small de-
light the time when he should be his own mas,
ter, and should take under his own cognizance
the ordering of his table, the selection of his
associates, and the regulation of his morals.
He had been initiated most completely into a
high estimation of himself; he had experienced
enough of the rigidity of restraint to long for
liberty; and he had by the constrained tem-

31
perance of his boyhood, impatiently borne,
been prepared for the wildness of unbridled
luxury.
When, therefore, the time of his liberty
arrived, and with it the means of indulgence,
he was prepared for any excess and for every
extravagance. He had the spirit of luxury, and he
thought that he had its science in full perfection.
In this apprehension, however, he was wrong;
for no man knows the science of life till he has
spent all the days of his life, and when all is
over he knows how it ought to have been re-
gulated.
Scarcely had Fitzgeorge finished a late and
yawning breakfast, when a reverend visitant
was announced, a full-blown dignitary, who
had experienced some of the beneficial effects
of Lord Fitzgeorge's patronage, and was look-
ing forward to the enjoyment of more. This
reverend doctor was in a situation of some little
difficulty. All his earthly hopes were fixed on
the Fitzgeorge family. Lord Fitzgeorge had

still some livings in his gift which might fall
during his lordship's life, or which might, for
life is uncertain, be at the disposal of the next
Lord Fitzgeorge. It was the doctor's policy,
and a duty which he owed to himself and family,
to conciliate the good will of the Fitzgeorges,
both father and son; but it was not easy to
stand well at the same time with a careful and
rigid parent and with a careless and luxurious
son;and the mission on which he was now
sent was one of expostulation and reproof. But
all animals have an instinct of self-preservation,
and the clerical animal not less, perhaps, than
any other. When the doctor was ushered into
the presence of Augustus Fitzgeorge, the young
gentleman was reclining on a sofa, attired in a
damask morning gown, and reading in a morn-
ing paper a poetical and exaggerated account
of his own grand and select entertainment of
the preceding day; for while the guests had
been drawn home senselessly in their respective
carriages, the busy sons of the press had been

compiling, composing, and printing a full, true,
and particular account of the splendid dinner
given by Augustus Fitzgeorge to some of the
most distinguished wits, statesmen, and philo-
sophers of the day, describing with great minute-
ness the magnificent furniture of the mansion
and the superb appointments of the table. This
morning paper had been at a much earlier hour
in the hands of Lord Fitzgeorge, and he had
seen with no great satisfaction an account of
his son's extravagance, and a list of his son's
companions. In much haste therefore, and in
no little anger, he commissioned this reverend
doctor to wait on Augustus, and to give him a
serious admonition of the impropriety of his
conduct. It was an unpleasant commission, but
it must be executed. There are some well-dis-
ciplined countenances, which can blend with the
grave frowns of moral rebuke the gentle smiles
of courteous deference. They are fine paper

blind-tooling. Such was the clerical expostula-
tor who now presented himself to Augustus
Fitzgeorge.
" It grieves me, sir," said he, "to be the mes-
senger of reproof; but I have it in command
from your honoured father, Lord Fitzgeorge, to
express the deep concern which he feels, that
you have selected such unsuitable companions ;
and that in their society you have been led into
such unbecoming excesses."
The reverend doctor carefully watched the
countenance of Fitzgeorge, which showed some
symptoms, though but slight, of displeasure.
"I do not take it upon myself," continued the
messenger,
to dictate what should be the con-
duct of a gentleman so exalted in rank, and so
distinguished in society. I merely fulfil the
duty which, from my situation, devolves on me,
of bearing to you your honoured father's sen-
timents."
Doctor," replied Fitzgeorge, "my honoured
father has singular notions on many topics; and

I believe you have generally found that there is
a difference of opinion between fathers and sons in
the matter of conduct and enjoyment. Your
profession also leads you to regard juvenile
follies, as they are called, with rather more
severity than they deserve."
" True, sir, very true," answered the doctor;
it is highly proper that persons in my situation
should preserve a degree of decorum in their
sentiments and demeanour; yet I would not
have you imagine that I am a mere ascetic,
and that I inveterately set my face against all
the enjoyments and innocent pleasures of life.
True religion, Mr. Fitzgeorge-true religion is a
cheerful and not a melancholy thing. True re-
ligion does not seek to deprive us of any real
pleasureit merely teaches us moderation in
the use of the good things of this life. I con-
sider it the business of my profession to render
religion attractive to all persons, It is the beauty
of religion that it adapts itself to all classes and

conditions in society. The highest are not above
it, the lowest are not beneath it."
Exactly so, doctor, I wish you had been of
our party yesterday. We had with us a gloomy
philosopher who would fain have persuaded us
that there is a perfect and absolute equality
of enjoyment in the human condition."
Blasphemy! blasphemy!" replied the doc-
nothing is so hostile to true religion as
philosophy. Ever while you live, my dear sir,
avoid the society of philosophers. Gloom and
philosophy are both hostile to religion; and as
for equalityyou are the last person in the world
who should give countenance to any thing like
the doctrine of equality."
I
you, doctor, I gave no countenance
to his doctrine, but I punished him for the pro-
mulgation of it by laying him under the table.
He was the first that fell."
The doctor frowned a smiling frown and said,

whether it was not wrong to punish him through
the medium of intoxication, for intoxication is not
one of the Christian virtues, it is rather a sin."
" A sin," replied Fitzgeorge, " that brings
its own punishment with it."
"Right," said the doctor, with a smile of
approbation, "perfectly right. I see that you
have very just views, and you have only to act
As I have said before, and as I
often say in my public ministrations, religion
does not interfere with any of our real com-
forts, but only prohibits those things which
would be injurious to us."
" Then, if I understand you rightly," replied
Fitzgeorge, "religion does not prohibit drink-
ing, but merely drunkenness."
"It is so, most undoubtedly," replied the
doctor; "and drinking in moderation, that is
to say, in moderation, is a pleasure; Scripture
itself saith, Wine rejoiceth man's heart.' But
drinking to excess is painful and injurious."
" Therefore," said Fitzgeorge, "it is irreli-

gious, because it is unwholesome. Very good:
But, doctor, is there no excuse to be ever made
for a little exuberance of vivacity, for an oc-
casional excess ?"
Certainly, I would not be so rigid as to
deny that there may be some cases in which an
extraordinary cup may not be sinful; and
sometimes it may happen that the most cautious
are off their guard. But there is nothing to
be so carefully avoided as vicious principles.
They poison the very fountain of morality
and the source of action. It has been rumoured
that you have shown too great an inclination
to countenance persons of licentious principles.
It really shocks me to think that any gentleman
at your table should presume to say a word in
favour of equality, a doctrine subversive of all
order and decorum and good government. A
more pernicious notion could never by any
means take possession of the mind of man."
" Your pardon, doctor," replied Fitzgeorge ;
"my philosophical visiter said not a word in

FITZGEORGE.
39
favour of political equality of condition; he
merely contended for the equality of human en-
joyment, whatever might be the inequality of
position or situation."
"A worse doctrine still, if possible," said
the doctor, " for it is nearly blasphemy, and
contrary to all human experience. Is it not
clear that the Creator favours some of his crea-
tures more highly than others ? Is not England
a highly-favoured country, blessed above all
other countries on the face of the globe ?
And are not the nobles of this highly-favoured
country blessed with peculiar and distinguished
blessings ? Now, yourself, for instance, I speak
it not to flatter you, for flattery becomes not
my sacred professionbut are you not in posses-
sion of all that heart could wish or humanity
desire ? You have rank, you have wealth, you
have youth, you have the advantage of a fine
person, of a superior understanding, and of a
well-furnished mind;- and have you not,
therefore, higher and brighter prospects of hap-

piness than the great multitude and mass of
common people, whom Providence hath not so
highly favoured ?"
" That is exactly my notion of the matter,"
said Fitzgeorge; "and I intend to act upon the
principle, and to enjoy life as well and as
heartily as I can."
Right, my good sir, very right, it would
be ungrateful in you not to enjoy life. To
enjoy is to obey,' as the poet hath it. It is not a
supposable case that Providence hath furnished
mankind with the means of enjoyment without
intending that they should be used."
" Then, doctor, you are not of the same
opinion as my philosophical friend ; you do not
admit of the equality of human enjoyment."
"I should be very sorry," said the doctor,
" to entertain any opinion in common with a
philosopher. I do not know any set of men
more pernicious to society than philosophers.
They turn the world upside down, and intro-
duce confusion and every evil work. If it were

not for philosophers, the world would go on
quietly and regularly enough; men would fear
God, honour the king, pay tithes and taxes,
mind their own business, and be thankful for all
the blessings of a good government;but now-
a-days, alas ! instead of that beautiful order,
we find all the world dissatisfied and discon-
tented; no one knows what he would have;
all the old landmarks are broken up, and peo-
ple, instead of reverently obeying the laws, and
piously attending to religious instruction, are
presuming to speak evil of dignities, and ob-
truding their unholy criticism and impertinence
even on the sacred functions of a regularly or-
dained priesthood. Such men as Leppard and
Borrowman are, notwithstanding their great and
acknowledged talents, seriously guilty in en-
couraging such disaffection.
Lord Fitzgeorge
is especially grieved that you should associate
with such men-men who are of such mischie-
vous politics too."
My worthy friend,".. replied Fitzgeorge,
## p. 42 (#54) ##############################################
42
FITZGEORGE.
"you know that I do not trouble myself much
with politics; and as for Leppard and Borrow-
man, they have not much sympathy with the
rabble, or they would never pay their court so
assiduously to me.
"And I am sure," said the doctor, " that
it does not become me to meddle with politics.
All that I know of politics is what I learn from
the Bible, which teaches me that every soul
should be subject to the higher powers, and that
the powers that be are ordained of God. It has
always been the concern and care of my life to
treat my superiors with respect; and I hope
that in conveying the paternal admonition to
you on the present occasion, I have not shown
myself wanting in the deference due to exalted
rank."
" By no means," said Fitzgeorge, making at
the same time that kind of movement which
sagacious men so well understand as being a
signal of leave to depart. The reverend doctor
took his leave, rejoicing in the dexterity with
## p. 43 (#55) ##############################################

43
which he had contrived to give most grave ad-
vice without offence, and pleased with the pow-
erful logic by which he had proved the agree-
ableness of religion.
On the departure of the divine, there sprung
up in the mind of Fitzgeorge another set of re-
flections. "I like," said he to himself, "the
sensual religion of this priest far better than the
rigid moroseness of the affected philosopher.
I profess myself to be neither philosophical nor
religious ; philosophy is a mere ignis fatuus ;
philosophers are only respected by philosophers,
the rest of the world understands them not.
In all but their philosophy they are fools, and
perhaps in that too. A deep philosophy is not
fit for a gentleman, and a shallow philosophy
suits not my ambition. The frowns of thought
spoil the countenance, the abstraction of inves-
tigation produce absence of mind and constraint
of manners, As for religionit will be time
enough for me to think of that fifty years hence.
My father is religiousafter a fashion ; he says

his prayers at church much louder than I do
and by the same rule, at the theatre he laughs
much more heartily than I do; but he is as
full of craft as those who say no prayers at all,
and can be as pettish and ill-humoured as those
who never laugh. I will heed neither philo-
sophy nor religion, but will frame my conduct
on a surer basis-my own apprehension of what
is good and desirable."

CHAPTER. III.
:
FIRST-LOVE.
When so brilliant a star as Fitzgeorge ap-
peared in the hemisphere of life, all eyes were
fixed upon it with a gaze of admiration,
and astonishment. Some looked with envy
as well as admiration, but homage was paid
by all; for envy is homage, and so is calumny
and a loud detraction.  Fitzgeorge was the
universal model ;-he was the centre to which
every eye was directed, and the topic on
which all tongues discoursed. In public
he was the point of attraction; at theatres
no pathos of tragedy nor humour of comedy
could draw the general attention from him.". In

the crowded assembly, where all pressed round
him, yet reverence preserved an unincumbered
space about him; partly, perhaps, from a feeling
of respect, and partly also that his fine figure
and commanding port might be seen to better
advantage. When he spoke every tongue was
silent, every ear attentive, and every eye was
fixed with reverend observance. Was he disposed
to be humorous ?. The ready laugh or grace-
ful smile was at his command from every coun-
tenance. Did he affect wisdom ? He was an
oracle. Did he discourse on matters of taste ?
There was but one opinion among his auditors,
and that one opinion was his. Fashion from
him had no appeal. His word was a law to
which more reverence was paid than to the
gospel. Nature had conferred upon liim the
dictatorship in all matters of dress and decora-
tion; in the realm of ornament he was supreme
and absolute. Fair eyes gazed upon him ad-
miringly, but amidst the myriads that admired,
few, very few, were they who could aspire to his
hand; the admiration which was without hope

FITZGEORGE.
47
was also without fear. At a distance haughty,
and apparently reserved, yet on a nearer ap-
proach such were the fascinations of his man-
ners, that the haughtiness which was known
was not felt. There is in some minds a grati-
tude for admiration and a readiness to return
the compliment. It was not so with Fitzgeorge;
he accepted it as a due, and he so far deserved
it, that he laboured hard to attain it. Nor only
did he study to gain admiration, but heartily
did he enjoy it, when he had gained it. When
many eyes were fixed on him in public he was
deeply conscious of the honouring gaze. Thus
were his thoughts driven backward upon him-
self, and wherever he moved he had a lesson of
self-love, which he was but too apt to learn.
Yet he thought that he could love.
As the sublime and the ridiculous are sepa-
rated by an inconceivably short interval, so is
there in a first-love either the utmost seriousness
of profound feeling, or the weakest and most
contemptible selfishness and self-ignorance.
## p. 48 (#60) ##############################################

FITZGEORGE.
There is scarcely a single interest in human
nature, or accident of being, that tries and de-
velopes the mind so completely as a first-love.
In all subsequent attachments, except when a
man is in his dotage, there is something of de-
sign, of intention, of reflection ; but in a first-
love there is an overwhelming of all the faculties,
a revolution of all the feelings, a confusion of
the vision, and a paralysis of the judgment;
the multitudinous world then seems to contain
but two beings. There is then to the lover but
one being worthy of regard, there is but one
image in his mind and one thought in his heart.
The whole aspect of nature is changed to him !
Sun, moon, and stars, the bright blue sky, and
the verdant fields, have no beauty in his eyes
but as they are blended with thoughts of his
beloved one. He that had lived for
many
ob-
jects, and in whose mind there had been mani-
fold ambitions, has now but one object for which
he lives, and but one ambition to which his
thoughts can be directed. All other joys to him

49
are sorrows, and all other society to him is so-
litude. There is one with whom all trials, toils,
and difficulties can be cheerfully met, and with-
out whom there is neither light in the day nor
beauty in nature. There is one for whom the
lover is prepared to sacrifice wealth, luxury,
lifeevery thing but the pride of rank.
It was Fitzgeorge's lot to lose his heart, if a
man may
be said to lose that which he never had,
to one at such an immense distance from himself
in rank, that for a while he could scarcely be-
lieve his senses. It has been said, and it will be
seen,
that it was the deliberate intention and de-
cided study of his mind to enjoy life to the ut-
most of its capacity of enjoyment, to seek after
pleasure wherever it was to be found, and to
purchase it at whatever price it might cost; in
a word, to sacrifice every thing to pleasure, and
to sacrifice pleasure to nothing-save to his pride,
which was his greatest pleasure. As it was his
object to enjoy a life of pleasure, he looked for
it where the world ordinarily says that it is to

be found, and where every body goes to seek for
it-in public assembliesin halls of festivity-
in theatresin masquerades. In these places
was his vanity gratified, and he was admired by
many, though there were but few that he ad-
mired. But there stole upon him imperceptibly
a passionate admiration of one of those, whose
profession it is to mimic the joys and sorrows of
human life-converting into an amusing poetry
the dull prose of actual being.
" You are unusually attentive to the play to-
night," said Sir William Dangle to Augustus
Fitzgeorge, at the close of the fourth act of
Romeo and Juliet.
Fitzgeorge almost sighedwhen waking from
his reverie, he said, "I never till now saw the
beauty of Shakspeare's genius. His conception
of the character of Juliet is superb."
" The actors do something for a play," said
Dangle.
" The Juliet does every thing for this," replied
Fitzgeorge: "as for the Romeo, methinks I

a
could enact the character better myself. There
is no passion-no sentiment. The fellow is as
cold as moonlight!"
" Does there not appear," said Dangle,
little affectation in Juliet ?"
" Affectation !" exclaimed Fitzgeorge, almost
angrily.
Dangle, who did not presume to differ from
Fitzgeorge, and who was afraid, as the old
saying hath it, to call his soul his own in
Fitzgeorge's presence, backed hastily out of the
accusation, and defined affectation to mean no-
thing but what was sublime, pretty, beautiful,
agreeable, or any thing that Fitzgeorge pleased.
"We do sometimes see," continued Fitzgeorge,
"performers throw such a new life and spirit
into an old play, as theugh the character, which
was written a hundred years ago, was made ex-
pressly and exclusively for them. I have seen
many Juliets, but never one like this."
Sir William Dangle was going to speak again,
but the curtain rose, and Fitzgeorge gave him a

look which 'signified silence, and that look was
obeyed. It had usually been Fitzgeorge's prac-
tice at the theatre to amuse himself rather with
the audience than with the performance-to en-
joy the involuntary admiration of the multitude
of eyes attracted by the gracefulness of his
per-
son and the splendour of his dress; but on the
present occasion all this was forgotten. He saw
nothing but Juliet-he cared for nothing but Ju-
liet: his eyes were fixed upon her, as though he
was fascinated. It seemed for a while that he
would set the unfashionable fashion of attention to
the business of the stage. His attention, however,
as it was seen by some more knowing than him-
self, was not on the performance so much as on
the performer: his sympathy was not with the
mimic Juliet, but with the real and actual indi-
vidual who performed the character: he cared
for the living being, not for the poetic abstraction;
and when the curtain fell, his eager eyes seemed
straining as though they would prevent its fall,

53
or lift it again to gaze once more on the lovely
form that had so sweetly imitated death.
A party supped with Fitzgeorge after the play.
For the first and perhaps last time in his life, he
was heedless of those around him. There was
wit from the witty-gaiety from the gay-and
wisdom froin the wise; but wit, gaiety, and
wisdom had no charms for him-his thoughts
were in the tomb of the Capulets. There were
new luxuries on the table, and new decorations
in the apartments, to catch the eyes and admira-
tion of his guests; but he heeded not the luxu-
ries, the decorations, or his guests. If the name
of Juliet was mentioned, his eye kindled up with
new lustre, and his heart beat quick with new
emotions. All this abstraction and all this emo-
tion were of course unobserved by himself, or he
would have used some effort to subdue them.-
They were not, however, unobserved by his
guests; for he was a person of too much import-
ance, and was too uch a centre of the world's
eye, for any movement of his mind or feature to
## p. 54 (#66) ##############################################
54
FITZGEORGE.
pass unnoticed. He never spoke a word that fell
unheeded from his lips, nor did a thought ever
cross his mind, or a passion disturb his breast,
giving to his look an appearance of emotion,
without exciting the sagacity and conjectures of
those around him.
The following morning there was no news-
paper on Fitzgeorge's breakfast table."What's
the meaning of this omission ?" said Fitzgeorge
hastily and haughtily to his valet. This anger
was caused by an impatience to read what was
said in the morning papers concerning the
beauty and pathos of Juliet. The absence
of the paper was owing to the fact that the
valet had previously seen that there was a
paragraph in it alluding too pointedly to his
master.
Not having invented an excuse for the ab-
sence of the paper, or not having determined
which to select of the many lies, which occurred
to him in simultaneous abundance, the servant
hesitated and was confused.
## p. 55 (#67) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE.
55
" I insist on having a paper this instant. Fly,
sirrah! and if you wish to keep your place let
me have every morning paper that is published."
Fitzgeorge was not to be disobeyed, and the
papers were brought. The affairs of Europe
were as the dust of the balance in comparison
with the affairs of Drury Lane Theatre. On
that part of the paper which criticized the
dramatic performances his eye first rested; with
an intense eagerness he perused every line that
spoke of Juliet till he fancied himself to be the
real Romeo. The scene was recalled to his
mind's eye, and the music of that sweet voice
was heard again. He saw again the soft lan-
guishing look which, even during the perform-
ance, had so often met his admiring and un-
deviating gaze. But, saddest sight of all, he
saw that the ignominious people of the press
had dared to profane his name by placing it
in their columns satirically. He had the mor-
tification to read as follows.

performance of Juliet when we say that the
Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge, who usually amuses
himself at the theatre rather more with the au-
dience than with the performance, was so at-
tracted by the fascinations of the acting or of
the actress, that when Juliet was on the stage
his attention was not for a moment withdrawn.
We thought, but we might be mistaken, that
he occasionally showed symptoms of deep emo-
tion ; we thought that more than once we ob-
served in him an illustration of the poet's words,
and that he
Unable to conceal his pain,

Fitzgeorge scowled disdainfully, and drew
himself up to the full attitude of supreme con-
tempt for the arrogant presumption of the
nameless reptiles who dared to profane his
name with their insolent banter. There is

something in a good hearty fit of profound con-
tempt and bouncing pride, which, though some-
what ludicrous, is not altogether ridiculous,
Pride may be ridiculous, but when it is carried
with a high hand and a hearty spirit, the ridi-
culousness of the feeling is lost in the sublimity
of the earnestness with which it is developed.
Sir William Dangle was announced. "My
dear Dangle," said Fitzgeorge, " I am at home
to nobody but you this morning."
This Sir William Dangle was a young gentle-
man of fair aspect, of mild manners, and gentle
demeanour. He had nothing to do with his
time and talents but to adorn his
person
and
get rid of the day. He was always very happy
to make himself useful to his superiors, and so
good-humoured as never to be rude or insolent
to his inferiors. In a word, he was one of those
whom the world calls a pretty fellow ;-he lived
upon the surface of life as carelessly and lightly
as the bodyless flies that skim the surface of
a summer stream.

" Read that," said Fitzgeorge.
Dangle took the paper and did as he was bid,
though he had read it all before ; but it was
all in the day's business, for it was his business
to do whatever Fitzgeorge might please to com-
mand him.
"What do you think of that?"
Think !" said Dangle, who did not know
what to think till Fitzgeorge told him.
Ay, think," replied Fitzgeorge; "is it not
villanous ?"
" Scandalous," replied Dangle.
"But she is a lovely creature."
" Beautiful," answered Dangle, who was
then almost in love with her himself, if Fitz-
george had not commanded otherwise.
" You sometimes attend the rehearsals, and
gossip in the green room."
"Occasionally Ido. I was there this morning."
Ay," said Fitzgeorge, eagerly," yes-yes-
there this morning-well-50-how did she
look ?"

FITZGEORGE:

" Lovely, interesting."
" Had she seen the papers
?-Was
my name
mentioned ?-Was any remark made ? -- Did
you converse with her ?"
" I believe that some one observed that there
was at least one admirer of the performance of
Juliet."
Alluding to me?" said Fitzgeorge.
" Or to me?" said Dangle.
" To you?" exclaimed Fitzgeorge, in such a
tone as convinced the worthy baronet that he
must not for a moment presume to be an ad-
mirer. " You must attend the rehearsal to-
morrow, and discover who and what she is,-
andandyou must take a note to her."
Dangle knew it must come to this, and he
sighed bitterly, but concealed his sorrows from
Fitzgeorge. Suppose," said he, "the affair
should come to the knowledge of Lord Fitz-
george."
" Let it: I heed it not."

" But if I am seen in the business, I shall
lose my good name with Lord Fitzgeorge."
"And if you are not, you will lose your good
name with me. Dangle, mark me-I am not
to be trifled with!"
" But what will Lord Fitzgeorge say? He
must certainly hear of it. The papers will make
town talk of it."
" What he will say to me is nothing to you ;
and what he may say to you is nothing to me.
Settle that matter with yourself.-I am Romeo,
and you must bear a letter to my Juliet: you
must convey my vows of eternal fidelity."
Fitzgeorge wrote with his own hand, and
sealed with his own seal, a note which con-
tained nonsense enough to win the silliest heart
that ever beat in a fair, frail bosom.
This note
Sir William Dangle, as in duty bound, took to
Juliet's lodgings. Dangle had not acknow-
ledged to Fitzgeorge that he was in the habit
of visiting this lady at her lodgings, and that he

was in the almost daily practice of calling and
sitting there for two or three hours every morn-
ing and entertaining her with his insipid prate
and meaningless looks, mistaking softness for
tenderness.
Juliet, for by that name alone we shall call
her, was young, beautiful, interesting, romantic,
-a creature of sensibility, looking around her
for pathos and poetry, fancying that life was
made for nothing but tenderness and sentimen-
tality, breathing sighs with every breath, and
throwing languishment into every look. She
had been attracted to the stage by the pure
passion for romance; the reality of life was too
harsh and cold for her; she was only happy in
the utterance of passion's wildest language, and
in the expression of those emotions which be-
long to a heart full of impulse and void of
balance. In the performance of those characters
which delineate the mere woman, the being of
susceptibility and tenderness, she was quite at
home. She studied, indeed, but little was the

study she needed; and to good effect was that
study given. As yet she had not met with any
being in the world answerable to those fairy-tale
notions which had crept into her infant mind
and which had grown with her growth, and
strengthened with her strength; even on the
stage, all her passion in the character of Juliet
had been directed, not to the living personifica-
tion of the Romeo that was before her partici-
pating in the labours of the mimic scene: there
was, however, on the night that Fitzgeorge
visited the theatre, a realization of the vision of
her romantic notion in his fine person and grace-
ful manners; the smile that placidly played on
his approving features as he looked with ap-
plause on the successful efforts of the impas-
sioned actress, the manliness of his figure, and
courtesy of his demeanour as he received and
returned the accidental homage of those near
him; the fine exclusive pride which played like
a halo of glory around him, lifting him, as it
were, above the earth, were enough, and more

63
than enough, to captivate the heart of young
simplicity, and to dazzle the imagination which
had never submitted itself to the cooler restraints
of judgment. Juliet that night acted with her
heart and with her eyes; the lustre of confiding
love, the passionate tenderness of unsuspecting
credulity, the glee of a nameless and a bound-
less hope, the overflowings of a passionate heart,
guileless, but for the simple vanity that moved
it, threw into the personification such an ex-
quisite reality, and so superb a spirit of poetry,
that the house was in a rapture of admiration
and applause. To this passionate and simple
creature-yet not altogether simpleSir Wil-
liam Dangle came as a messenger of Fitz-
george's love.
Dangle himself, as we have said, was a fre-
quent attendant at Juliet's lodgings, and he
would often accompany the sweet singing of
her lovely voice with the violin, and sometimes
he would join her in some languishing duetto,
imagining himself and Juliet a pair of turtle

doves. But now his mission was of a far dif,
ferent kind; a harsher duty now devolved upor
him and a more severe employment was des-
tined for him. He entered the apartment with
a graver aspect, an air of embarrassment hung
about him, and he appeared very much indeed
like an awe-stricken lover, conscious of his
pre-
sumption in aspiring to the hand of an angel.
Women have eyes keen as light and quick as
lightning ! they can read deep thoughts, if
there be passion in their depth. Juliet saw
that there was constraint and hesitation in Sir
William's look; Juliet suspected, but for a
moment, that the baronet was framing his lips
and summoning up his courage to tell a tender
tale, and send his soul in sighs. The messenger
of Fitzgeorge's love now drew the tender billet
from its perfumed abode, and with an imper-
fectly suppressed sigh presented it to the fair
hands for which it was destined. The seal was
visible, but Juliet looked as though she saw it
not.
## p. 65 (#77) ##############################################

65
"Shall I read it immediately?"
Immediately."
There was a profound silence ;a silence so
profound that Juliet heard the beating of her
heart. Sir William looked on the ground or
he might have seen the superbest blush that
ever came into a lovely countenance, rendering
it ten thousand times more lovely than ever.
For some seconds after she had read the note
Juliet was speechlessSir William looked for
a replythe only signature to the note was,
" Romeo." Who was Romeo? Juliet could
guess but would not say. Prettily feigning an
ignorance of the writer, she asked with as much
calmness as she could collect, "Who is Ro-
meo?"
" Can you not guess? Who should he be?".
the fair one simperingly said, "Who but Sir
William Dangle can it be?"
Sir William placed his right hand on his left
side, and bowing with much humility and
sheepish diffidence, replied, "Surely you cannot
## p. 66 (#78) ##############################################
66
FITZGEORGE.
think that I should be guilty of such pre-
sumption."
" Who can it be?"
The baronet pointed to the seal. 16 'Tis abso-
lutely impossible," said Juliet, from whose mind
the image of the gay and gallant Fitzgeorge had
not departed for a single instant from the
very
moment that looks of intelligence had passed
between them ;" Fitzgeorge! the graceful, the
gentle Fitzgeorge-no-no-Sir William, you
are mocking me-I may not believe it."
" Not believe it !" exclaimed the baronet;
who was astonished that any one should dis-
believe what he knew to be a fact, and who
could not think it possible that Juliet was affect-
ing ignorance and incredulity;
you must have
observed the marked attention he gave to every
passage of your performance, and you cannot
have forgotten the graceful bow with which he
honoured you, and the smile with which he
received your acknowledgment of his con-
descension."
## p. 67 (#79) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE.
67
" Forget! oh, 'tis impossible to forget, and
as impossible not to admire. But can one in
his exalted sphere deign to regard with more
than a passing approbation so humble a being
as I ? Sir William, you know the simplicity of
my poor heart, and you are making sport of
me."
Then, suddenly checking herself and
altering the tone of her voice, she said, " Ah!
what have I said ?- Is this notice an honour ?
-Have I cause to be proud of it? No-no-
'tis humiliating'tis dishonourable ?"
Offering the note again to the bearer, Juliet
continued in a tone of well-feigned gravity:
"I must beg that you will be pleased, Sir
William Dangle, to return this note to him from
whom
you received it, and to say from me that
I cannot, may not, must not commence a cor-
respondence which will certainly terminate in
misery. Ever shall I look up to him with pro-
found respect! I shall ever regard him as the
first and best of men, an honour to the human

speciesbut I dare not listen to the proposals
herein contained. Think what the pious and
the good Lord Fitzgeorge would say! Oh, it
would break his fatherly heart! Think too of
the strict decorum of Lady Fitzgeorge !"
Sir William Dangle was completely posed.
He knew not what to say or what to think.
Having been in the habit of looking up to
Fitzgeorge as one whose
very
wishes were com-
mands, and whose words demanded an unques-,
tioning obedience, he was surprised at the re-
quest to take back the note and to pronounce
the negotiation at an end almost as soon as it
had commenced. But Juliet was as good an
actress off the stage as on.
The sentimental
drama was her forte; so that in the present in-
stance she imposed most effectually on Sir Wil-
liam Dangle, who thought that his embassy
had altogether failed, and that he had nothing
to carry back to his employer but intelligence
that Juliet was inexorable.

" But you will not send the note back again;
it will be more courteous to write."
" And more politic," thought Juliet;she
wrote accordingly, and kept the charming
Romeo's billet to muse on in her solitude.

CHAPTER IV.
THE NEGOTIATION.
Fitzgeorge was in love, deeply, desperately,
but not despairingly. Actually there were mo-
ments when he thought of Juliet with so pas-
sionate an emotion and with such an over-
whelming interest, that he almost imagined that
he could be happier with her in a cottage than
without her in a palace; and so perhaps he
could have been for a month or two. When he
read the pretty, modest, poetical and sentimental
note which Juliet had written to him, he sighed
over ithe wept over it. He sat in solitude in
a superb saloon, and lifting up his eyes to the

71
gilded roof, could not but admire the taste which
he had displayed in devising such splendid forms
of decoration; he looked round on the walls
where hung the choicest specimens of the pro-
ductions of the first artists in the world, and
he was proud of the tact which could distin-
guish their excellence and of the wealth that
could purchase them; he looked on the sump-
tuous furniture of the apartment, and all was
perfect; he surveyed his own form reflected
from a lofty mirror which stood before him,
and he rejoiced in the thought that there was
perfection in that form. His imagination wan-
dered
away
from the scene before him to halls
of festivity, and he recollected the homage with
which he was there received, and anticipated a
homage yet more complete on some future day,
when the title of the great Lord Fitzgeorge
should be his, and when he should have nothing
to desire. There was nothing within and nothing
without, nothing in the past, nothing in the fu-
ture to disturb, terrify, or annoy him; he was,
## p. 72 (#84) ##############################################
72
FITZGEORGE.
or at least he thought that he ought to be, the
happiest of mortals, the most enviable and the
most envied of the human species; but still
there was a drop of bitterness in his cup. The
thought of Juliet dwelt painfully on his mind,
yet painful as was the thought, he would not for
worlds have been without it.
" With Juliet," said he to himself, "I should
be the happiest of mortals, without her I am the
most wretched. What avails the splendour that
surrounds me? What the value of the homage,
with which I am every where received ? What
the use of the treasures which have been poured
into my coffers ? What the satisfaction of my
exalted rank and my honourably distinguished
name? But a few days ago I thought that
every thing that heart could desire was within
my reach, and now the very luxuries, in which
I gloried and exulted, grow flat and insipid.
Is there any truth in the sentiment of the
morose philosopher, that every condition of life
must have its annoyances, that pain is pur-

FITZGEORGE.
73
chased by pleasure, and pleasure by pain? No,
no; it cannot be. Nothing is wanting now to
my perfect happiness but to call Juliet mine;
mine by the bonds of an undying affection, by
bonds stronger than human laws !"
He paused awhile in his meditations, and
then again the current of his thoughts took
another direction. " I am almost tempted,"
continued he, in his soliloquy, " to envy the
free condition of the humbler race of mortals
who, having no dignity of rank to maintain,
can marry whom they will, and can enjoy their
quiet homes in peace, independent of the world's
eye and heedless of its idle talk."
It was not long that such envy dwelt in the
breast of Fitzgeorge. The strong and decided
taste for ostentation, for the luxury of the eye,
which was one of the most inseparable of his
passions, recovered its dominion, and it may be
more than suspected that he would not have
surrendered any of the pomps of his station,
could he even by the sacrifice have made Juliet

his own.
Another and another perfumed billet
found its way to the escrutoire of Juliet, who
punctually and prettily answered them. As
these answers were conveyed through the hands
of Sir William Dangle, and as the young lady
had not yet had any interview with Fitzgeorge,
they were always expressed with the utmost
caution, and as it were, with some lurking sus-
picion of the identity of the writer with the in-
dividual whose name they bore. Written pro-
testations could not meet and obviate this
difficulty; and Fitzgeorge more than once me-
ditated a personal visit to the fascinating actress.
But though of age, and so far independent, he
had some little fear of Lord Fitzgeorge before his
eyes, nor was he altogether desirous of the eclat
which such a visit would give him with the
public press. His visits, however, to the theatre,
were more frequent; and his attention to the
hesitating and doubting fair one, was more
decided and unequivocal. There he thought
not how many eyes were upon him; but heed-

FITZGEORGE.
75
less of all observation, his whole soul was en-
grossed by one object, and all his ingenuity was
brought into exercise to give intimations to
Juliet, that he was veritably the writer of the
sweet notes, which she had so romantically, so
modestly, and so unbelievingly answered. There
was such an ineffable grace in his manners,
such a fascination in his fine eyes, so sweet a
condescension in his smile, he was altogether-
so Juliet thought-a model of manly and gen-
tlemanly perfection. Her eyes told him that
she adored him; and as she had eyes only for
him in all the crowded theatre, she thought not
of the myriads of eyes which were fixed on her,
some censoriously and some jealously.
When the performance at the theatre was
over, Juliet would retire to her lodgings, and
would bring before her mind's eye an image of
the graceful Fitzgeorge, and she would invest
that image with all poetic colouring and un-
earthly glory. To her mind he was the only
living being that answered to her notion of a

perfect character. Perfection to different minds
is a word which has different meanings; to some
it presents moral notions, to others intellectual,
but to the mind of Juliet it presented only the
elements which in their combination form the
romantic. Her's indeed was not the romance of
historic chivalry, but of an outrageous and girl-
ish sentimentality. Her apprehension of mental
qualities was intensely and essentially superficial.
The
grace
that could turn a sentence and modu-
late a period, was to her the understanding that
could evolve an idea. The music of the voice
was to her ear and apprehension the harmony
of the soul; she saw nothing deeper than the
smile which played on the features; and with
all the mere mechanism of outward manners, her
fancy blended every pleasing or desirable attri-
bute of mind. A passion for Fitzgeorge took
possession of her heart, and she knew it not.
She thought that she might innocently and
harmlessly admire, with an admiration bordering
on idolatry, one so far above her. She could

FITZGEORGE.
77
not but know the meaning of the correspondence
which he had commenced, but she wilfully shut
her eyes to it, and indulged herself in thoughts
of the goodness, kindness, and gentleness of
heart, which distinguished Fitzgeorge in her
imagination above all other human beings.
Perhaps she did not think how much the ele-
gance of his manners and the beauty of his per-
son, and the eclat of his rank, contributed to
heighten, if not to form, this goodness, kindness,
and gentleness of heart. While she seemed to
herself to be gently blaming his passionate con-
descension, and proving to herself the utter im-
possibility of continuing the correspondence, she
was in reality merely devising means to form
the arrangement contemplated by her gallant
and graceful lover. As soon as her imagination
had started a difficulty, that same imagination
heard the sweet voice of Fitzgeorge musically
removing the difficulty, and softly dispersing
her fears.
Fitzgeorge was young and inexperienced. He

knew not, nor could he discern, that which all
others could see, the love of Juliet for him. In-
tensely and heartily as a vain man may flatter
and persuade himself that all who see and hear
him must admire him, it is not easy for the vain-
est of men, when passionately in love, to dis-
cover in the beloved object the passionate return
of that love. It may perhaps be laid down as a
general axiom, that the more deeply a young
man is in love, the less able is he to detect
symptoms of love in another; and when a lover
sees that he is beloved, then there frequently
follows a growing indifference towards the hi-
therto beloved. These common-place notions
Fitzgeorge had not yet learned; he might have
heard of them, or have read of them in books,
but he believed them not, because he appre-
hended them not. So his love for Juliet was yet
more and more sincere ; his thoughts were in-
cessantly occupied about her, and he cared com-
paratively little for all the other interests of life.
The various artists who were in ordinary requi-

79
sition with their skill and toil to decorate his
person and his dwelling, found him compara-
tively indifferent to them. When contemplating
some new design for decorative furniture, he
would manifest a strange absence of mind, and
interrupt the examination of a pattern by the
heaving of a lover's sigh. As yet Fitzgeorge
had little to do with political business, but men
of politics were about him and political talk was
frequently their topic. Liberality of sentiment
was his profession, and he affected to rank him-
self in the Opposition. But when the passion
for Juliet had taken possession of him, he cared
for neither Whig nor Tory, and he had no spirit
to enter into the agitating topics of the day.
A young man of very high rank, of very large
fortune, and of still larger expectations, has, of
course, a great number of friends; and the
friends of such a one generally consider it a
part of their duty, and a manifestation of their
friendship, to humour him in all his caprices,
and to countenance him in all his follies. They

are his friends not so much from friendship to
him as from friendship to themselves, and they
know that they can only continue to be his
friends so long as they are subservient to his
purposes, and are compliant with his humours.
The friends of Fitzgeorge saw that he had lost
his heart, and that he was dying for the lovely
Juliet. They consulted one with another, and
they agreed that it was a sad pity that the peace,
happiness, character, and reputation of a young
lady of no rank or fortune should be in the
way
of Fitzgeorge's happiness, and not be sacrificed
to a passion which they did not suppose likely
to endure many months. Sir William Dangle,
as having been the messenger from Fitzgeorge
to Juliet, was a principal person in the consulta-
"tions which were held on this momentous topic.
As man, being lord of the creation, exercises his
lordship over the animals which he can subdue
by his strength, or manage by his craftiness,
eating those which he likes to eat, killing those
which it is sport to kill, tormenting others which

it may be amusing to torment, and making slaves
of such as have strength to labour and docility
to be taught,-as man does all this with the ut-
most coolness, and without the slightest degree:
of compunction, regarding it as the immutable
law of nature, that the weaker should submit to
the stronger, and that the inferior should minis-
ter to the wants or caprices of the superior, so
in his demeanour towards his own species he
acts upon the same principles, and is moved by
the same impulses. He seems to think that the
offences of the weaker towards the stronger are
of a nature so heinous, as to require the visitation
of a most tremendous punishment, but that the
offences of the stronger towards the weaker are
exceedingly venial, scarcely deserving reproof.
He seems to think that the possessions of the
weak are the property of the strong, and that it
is a kind of profane rebellion in the inferior to
withhold ought from the superior. On this
principle man acts, and gravely admires the
beautiful gradations of rank which hold toge-

ther, as he fancies, the mystic chain of social
being
Be this as it may, it is certain that Fitz-
george's friends thought it the absurdest thing
in the world that Juliet should hesitate to sacri-
fice herself to one so immensely her superior.
Even Juliet herself, to the shame of humanity
be it spoken, was blinded by the brilliance of
rank and the dazzle of wealth, and admitted a
deliberation on a proposal, which would have
been rejected with stern disdain, if coming from
one of lower grade in society than the gay and
fascinating Fitzgeorge.
Sir William Dangle, in his visits to Juliet,
was accompanied by other friends of Fitzgeorge;
men past the confines of thoughtless youth-
bearing titles at which the multitude is taught
to stare with undefinable reverence. It was no
longer a doubt with her now that Fitzgeorge was
in earnest, passionately, sincerely in earnest.-
She heard from the lips of grave and titled se-
nators, that Fitzgeorge was dying for her her

83
head grew dizzy with vanity, and her heart
swelled with sympathy. It was sad, indeed, to
think that so good, so generous, so noble a being
as Fitzgeorge, should for a moment suffer on her
account. In imagination she heard his sighs
and saw his tears-sighs more gracefultears
more brilliant than ever hero of romance had
heard or shed. The convenient baronet, at one
of his visits, presented to Juliet a miniature of
her inamorato set in gold, and adorned with
pearls. Dull was the gold and worthless the
pearls in her estimation, compared with the in-
teresting resemblance of the gentle Fitzgeorge.
On those features, so familiar to her mind's eye,
and so dear to her romantic heart, the lovely
Juliet looked and sighed and meditated :-the
voice, indeed, was not familiar to her ear, but
she gave, by the exercise of an active and fond
imagination, a voice of music to those features
of harmony and gracefulness. Miniature por-
traits are made for loversthey soften the fea-
tures, and they bring the resemblance into so

condensed a form, that only one pair of eyes
can gaze upon it at once.
Juliet's doubts and fears now began to dis-
perse-her scruples grew lighter and fainter,
till at length they vanished into thin air. Seated
at her toilet, with the portrait of Fitzgeorge be-
fore her, and thinking deeply of the labours and
toils of her theatrical profession, which, so far
from promising any support for the latter days
of her life, was scarcely adequate to meet the
unavoidable expenses of the passing hour-know-
ing the generosity of Fitzgeorge, and calculat-
ing, not wisely indeed, on the permanence of his
attachment from the strength of her own affec-
tion, she was prepared to consent to a meeting.
In contemplating the arrangement proposed by
Fitzgeorge, a complete revolution of feeling had
taken place. No longer did she regard it in the
light of a transgression, but took to herself a
degree of merit for the heroism with which she
would dare to brave the world's opinion for the
dear sake of her gentle Fitzgeorge. Pleasant

and curious to all but those who use them are
the sophistries by which people give to the acts
of their inclination the aspect of virtue. The
world's censure-the grave anger of the good
Lord Fitzgeorgethe virtuous indignation of the
punctilious Lady Fitzgeorgewere now forgot-
ten, or regarded with indifference.
At length, when sufficient previous talk and
interchange of notes had been made, and when
Fitzgeorge's friends had assured him, that matters
had now proceeded far enough to justify him, on
the score of policy, in making regular proposals
in the form of a handsome settlement, the young
lover, in the ardour of his new passion, drew up
and sent by his faithful negociator a bond for se-
veral thousand pounds, forming to the mind and
apprehension of Juliet a handsome independence
for the remainder of life, let what might befal
her in the chapter of human accidents. Gazing
on the bond with a pleasing kind of incredulity,
which was just enough to delay and prolong the
pleasure of receiving the delightful intelligence,

Juliet admired and almost adored the generosity
of her gallant and graceful lover.
" Yet what," said she to herself, in a passion
of romance, " is all the wealth in the world,
compared with the smiles and affections of my
dear Fitzgeorge? Have I not the supreme feli-
city, the enviable happiness, of calling the best,
the kindest, the noblest heart in the empire,
mine by all the bonds of a tender affection ?-
'Tis well, indeed, that he has thus sent me this
token of his generosity; but the value of it is
not in the nominal amount of itnot in the mere
gross pecuniary form-its real value to me is the
indication which it gives of the nobleness of his
spirit--of the generosity of his nature."
Fitzgeorge had a seat in the vicinity of the
metropolis. To avoid as much as possible all
needless publicity, it was now arranged that a
meeting should take place there, and that the
meeting should be after sun-set; that Sir William
Dangle should take charge of the lady, and that
at this interview such farther arrangement should

be made as would remove the necessity of any
messengers between the parties.
To the eye of Fitzgeorge never did the sun
set more gloriously than it did on the evening of
this interesting day. He thought for once in his
life that the heavens looked more beautiful than
his own gilded roof; but beautiful as was the
sight of the glorious sun with its
gorgeous
reti-
nue of multiform and many-coloured clouds, he
was impatient at the slow departure of lagging
day-light. Nor was the romantic Juliet less in-
terested in the day's decline; she watched the
sun's declining rays, and saw with indescribable
emotion the lengthening shadows of evening.--
Poor Sir William Dangle, in whose custody she
had placed herself for the day, and with whom
she dined at an obscure inn not far from the
place of rendezvous, was melancholy enough in
the thought that his beloved one should be sa-
crificed to another; and he also, by sympathy,
took part in the absence of mind which Juliet
displayed ; so that had they been visible to a

third person, not knowing for what purpose they
were together, they would have presented a scene
altogether and most exquisitely ridiculous.
At length the hour of meeting arrived. Wrap-
ping themselves up in a close disguise, and
silently gliding along the star-lit paths like
thieves or persons afraid of thieves, they entered
the park which surrounded Fitzgeorge's man-
sion, and took their station beneath a broad
spreading oak. Whether the evening was light
or dark, cold or warm, Juliet knew not. Her
eyes were fixed on the mansion from whence
Fitzgeorge was soon to emerge, and her heart
throbbed with strong emotion as she stood si-
lently waiting his approach. He came punctual
to his appointment. Juliet knew it was he by
the superb gracefulness of his gait. He also
was disguised, but no disguise could hide
from the penetrating eye of love and admiration
the object of its idolatry. Sir William Dangle,
like a well trained spaniel, withdrew to a modest
distance. Moving as rapidly as was consistent

89
with that grace and dignity which he never for-
got, Fitzgeorge advanced to the spot where Juliet
stood, and extending his hand he said in tones
more sweet than music ever breathed, "It is my
Juliet!"
Juliet with a trembling confidence and hum-
ble pride, took the proffered hand, and would
have said, "My Fitzgeorge!", but her heart
swelled, her knees trembled, and sinking almost
to the ground with a lowly curtsey, she kissed
the hand which was offered to her and sighed.
The passionate lover raised her from the volun-
tary humility, and drawing her arn within his,
whispered sweet words, such as make young
lovers' hearts throb with ecstacy.
" 'Tis kind, 'tis generous, my beloved one,"
said the enraptured Fitzgeorge, "that despising
the world's reproaches you thus condescend to
permit me to call you mine, mine for ever, mine
by every bond save that feeblest, coldest of all
which is mere shadow, mere name, mere cere-
mony, a bond which holds together in most un-

natural union hearts that have no sympathy
with one another."
Fitzgeorge," exclaimed Juliet, and her lips
trembled while she uttered that name which she
alone was permitted to utter with the familiarity
of love, and which all the rest of the world men-
tioned with profound respect,"Fitzgeorge, I know
thegenerosity of your nature. I do unhesitatingly
confide in you.
For
you
I surrender every-
thing, and by you I know I never shall be de-
ceived."
"Dear, sweet, confiding, intelligent creature!"
replied Fitzgeorge, "I have admired, adored
you for the unrivalled splendor of your talents
for your fascinating, bewitching manners, but
you have now indeed made me inviolably your's by
this sweet interesting confidence. This, this in-
deed is love, of which inferior and vulgar minds
can have no apprehension. I perceive the no-
bleness of your nature in this dignity of your
sentiments, and I have only to regret that the
absurd customs of an ignorant and stupid world

91
render it impossible for me to honour you as I
ought to do."
Alas, dear Fitzgeorge," said the emboldened
and impassioned Juliet, "what is the world to
me? You are my world. Is there any living
creature on the face of the earth, whose good
word I can for a moment put in competition
with your's? Will not a smile from you more
than counterbalance the frowns of the whole
world ? If I hear your applauding voice, I hear
all the applause I can desire."
" Excellent woman!" said Fitzgeorge, "We
were clearly and undoubtedly formed for each
other. Our sentiments are in such perfect har-
mony, our apprehensions are coincident. I per-
ceive that we are bound to each other by an
inseparable chain of sympathy. We need not
the idle forms and ceremonies of a jealous
world, we are above such low considerations."
Juliet sighed, not in sorrow, but in a passion-
ate admiration of the superb and elevated sen-
timents of Fitzgeorge. It was delightful to her

to find that there was in the world another being
as romantic as herself. Then again as romantic
people are always exceedingly virtuous accord-
ing to their notions of virtue, Juliet could not
help saying: "But what if the good Lord Fitz-
george should hear of our acquaintance; will
not his peculiar opinions be somewhat shocked?
May it not be a cause of uneasiness to him ?"
" Lord Fitzgeorge," replied the lover, " has
indeed peculiar opinions; but are we, therefore,
to sacrifice our happiness to his peculiar opi-
nions ? No, my beloved Juliet; if
not for my sake to brave the world, I will not
hesitate for your sake to brave the anger of
Lord Fitzgeorge."
"Oh! most excellent man! Most noble and
generous Fitzgeorge !" exclaimed Juliet, " the
more I see of
your
excellent nature, the more
heartily I adore you! Oh! what is there in the
world worth a thought compared with the con-
fiding ingenuousness of undoubted and un-
doubting love? We will brave the world; we

are above its narrow and confined notions. Has
the world any thing to give at all equal to the
generosity of true affection ?"
In such talk as this some few more minutes
passed, till Fitzgeorge, whose pride and selfish-
ness never forsook him even in the
very passion
and pathos of his affectionate love, thought that
his absence from the mansion might be observed,
and therefore signified his wish to bring the in-
terview to a close. This, however, was not done
till such arrangements had been made as were
necessary for their future meetings.

CHAPTER V.
EXTRAVAGANCE.
At the desire of her lordly lover, Juliet now
quitted the stage, retiring from the publicity of
gaping eyes to the still greater publicity of re-
proachful or jealous tongues. But Juliet was
happy and so was the enamoured Fitzgeorge.
Juliet was happy in a residence more splendid
than anything which had hitherto courted her
fond imagination. Juliet was happy in the
means of much magnificence of attire, and in ex-
ceeding those who had exceeded her. Surely
there must be something very delightful in
victory, in the outdoing or surpassing another ;
## p. 95 (#107) #############################################

95
since, for victory such toils will be undergone,
such pains will be taken; it is for victory that
men kill and are killed; it is for victory that
we are struggling through the whole feverish
course of our agitated being. Juliet, however,
happy as she might be in the life of luxury and
splendour which she lived by means of what
she called the liberality and noble generosity of
her gentle Fitzgeorge, was still more happy in
his society, in hearing his rapturous protesta-
tions of eternal fidelity; in listening to his some-
what ingenious, yet not altogether insincere flat-
teries; in conversing with him on the infinite
and exhaustless topics of the fine arts and ele-
gant literature; in criticising with him the
pro-
duct of the artist's pencil and the effusions of
the poet's muse. Fitzgeorge had taste, and so
had Juliet; and both were gifted with a most
admirable fluency of speech on the lighter and
livelier topics of criticism. Both were pleased
with each other, and found or made a wonder-
ous similarity of taste and sentiment. Was

there a painting that Fitzgeorge admired ? Juliet
was enraptured with it, and was ingenious in
discovering all its beauties, the more latent as
well as the obvious. Did Fitzgeorge read aloud
to his adored Juliet? the fair one to whom his
voice was more than mortal melody, gave the
whole attention of her soul; and from his lips
every beauty and every grace of composition
came forth more beautiful and more graceful.
She knew by the intonation of his voice, and
by the gentle smoothness and prolonged enun-
ciation with which he dwelt on any particular
passage, that it contained something which gra-
tified his taste and pleased his fancy;and then
would she, with an expression at once sincere
and well-acted, proclaim, as if by an irresistible
impulse, her hearty commendation of the poet's
skill. Fitzgeorge was musical; he had a voice,
- he had a taste,-he had a passion for music.
Music of every description was familiar to the
lovers, from the light lays of the love-inspiring
song to the more ennobling and impassioned

compositions of the sacred oratorio. They
chaunted together the music of the cathedral
they sang the lays of chivalry; and they war-
bled the well-poised cadences of the smooth
duett which blend two voices in one with an un-
distinguishable harmony. Never did domestic
bliss appear more brilliant than with this ele-
gant and enamoured pair. Fitzgeorge was happy
in the admiration with which Juliet regarded
the luxurious decorations with which she was
surrounded. Musical instruments were pro-
vided for her, not merely of the finest tone and
the utmost accuracy of construction, but of the
most splendid forms and the most expensive
materials; harps, richly gilded and curiously
carved; pianofortes of such exquisite tone and
decoration, that even Fitzgeorge himself, with
all his subtlety of taste, knew not whether most
to admire the inside or the out. Fitzgeorge and
Juliet were happy in the mutual encouragement
which they gave to each others' luxury and ex-
travagance. It was possible, indeed, so far

selfishness prevailed in his character and com-
position, for Fitzgeorge to enjoy the solitary
contemplation of his own splendour, and to an-
ticipate in his select meditations the eclat with
which the brilliance of his appointments would
be received in public; but his pleasure was in-
creased by having an approving voice near him
to echo his own sentiments on every new pur-
chase, and commend loudly his self-admired
taste in every form of ornament which he de-
vised, --whether of dress, of equipage, or furni-
ture. Michael Angelo himself never gazed on
the poetic creations of his superb imagination
with more heartfelt and glowing satisfaction,
than did Fitzgeorge survey the operations of
the tailor or upholsterer in giving being to the
devices of his taste. A coat without a wrinkle,
a carpet of unprecedented pattern, hangings of
luxurious richness and expense which made
them unattainable by any but himself;these,
and a myriad of other dear, delightful blessings,
made Fitzgeorge exquisitely happy, while their

novelty lasted. Happy also, was he, when en-
gaged, as he often would be, in deep consulta-
tion with some skilful architect, whose greatest
skill consisted, perhaps, in the dexterity with
which he could anticipate and embody the
fancies and the freaks of Fitzgeorge's taste.
And could Juliet do aught else than admire that
which he admired ?-Certainly not. Over-
whelmed was she with wonder at the universal
genius of her gentle Fitzgeorge; and there
dwelt on her mind perpetually, with increasing
strength, a sentiment of gratitude for his kind-
ness and liberality to her. She thought notm
and why should she ?that his very liberality
was selfishness.
She who had been with much difficulty
struggling, by means of a laborious and imper-
fectly recompensed profession, to keep up the
appearance of elegance and style; she who had
felt nothing more deeply than the mability to
maintain the little splendour of which she was
so proud, now reposed with a delightful satis-

faction on the thought that the day of want and
of difficulty was passed away for ever. She
who had blended in her notions of romance a
love of show as one component part of the great
happiness of life, was now enraptured with the
elegance that surrounded her and the luxuries
which were at her command. For all this she
was indebted to Fitzgeorge, to him who had
every recommendation which could ingratiate
him with the female heart; so that being de-
lighted with all that was about her, and know-
ing that all was owing to him or connected with
him, she regarded him with the utmost pas-
sionate admiration, at once loving, respecting,
admiring, and esteeming him. There was ad-
miration for his mental qualities and graceful-
ness of demeanour, respect for the superiority
of his rank, gratitude for his liberality, and love
for his tenderness and affectionateness of heart.
There was no good or desirable quality which
Juliet did not see in Fitzgeorge in a most emi-
nent and supereminent degree. He was the centre

FITZGEORGE.
101
of all her thoughts, and the very god of her
idolatry. He was everything to her, because
for his sake she had regarded and treated the
world as nothing. So she was not only drawn
towards him by the attractions of kindness and
elegance, but driven towards him by the world
without. With him she was everything, with-
out him she was nothing, less than nothing-a
despised, neglected, forsaken, broken-hearted,
withering creature, perishing in the world's ne-
glect, and withering beneath its strong contempt.
She could not return to her old profession, and
there was no new one to receive her. Strongly,
however, as such feelings might influence her,
they did not make their approach to the mind
in any visible or tangible form. She thought
of Fitzgeorge only and always with admiration,
and not thinking or considering that she had
already sacrificed the world for him, she was
always imagining that her love for him was so
great that she could readily sacrifice a world for
him.
## p. 102 (#114) ############################################
102
FITZGEORGE.
No longer now did Juliet think gravely of
the world's censorious eyes and its reproachful
tongue; she heard no sound but the sweet music
of her Fitzgeorge's voice, while the splendour
of her equipage blinded her vision to everything
else that surrounded her. No longer now did
she dread the stern displeasure of Lord Fitz-
george, or the virtuously indignant reproaches
of Lady Fitzgeorge, but proudly passed them
in the public street, whenever by any chance
their equipages met.
Whensoever virtuous sentiment has taken
possession of any heart, whether by means of
fanaticism, young affection, or timid gentleness
of spirit, it is some time before that sentiment
can be wholly eradicated. Fitzgeorge, who had
made it the ruling principle of his life to have
enjoyment where and whenever it was attaina-
ble, and at whatever cost, liked not that any
sentiment of remorse, repugnance, or self-re-
proach should interfere with the ease and com-
fort of his spirit; therefore he took no small

FITZGEORGE.
103
pains to remove from the mind of Juliet the
least and last vestiges of consciousness or self-
reproach; and there is no logic so convincing
as the logic of a lover. Juliet heard him, ad-
mired his liberality of sentiment, marvelled at
the narrow views which she had formerly en-
tertained, and was exalted in her own esteem
by the thought of the more generous freedom of
her own sentiments, as her mind became en-
lightened by conversation with Fitzgeorge.
Thus she became Fitzgeorge's own most en-
tirely, she lived but for him, and he was her
only light, life and glory. She calculated not
on the durability, nor anticipated the extinction
of this rhapsodical fever of fondness. She
thought it not possible that Fitzgeorge should
ever withdraw his affection from her. In fact,
the cessation of his esteem was not to be thought
of, for there was nothing to look to beyond it;
there was nothing for her, when that was gone,
but utter darkness and despair, the solitude of
her own sad thoughts, and the silence of a home

robbed of its splendour. Therefore she became
almost voluntarily and wilfully blind-she lived
in the present, for there was nothing but the
present for her to live in the past was too great
a contrast to be a pleasing contemplation, it
could not be recalled; and the future was of so
exquisite an uncertainty, that its images danced
confusedly before the mind's eye, and wearied
the soul in its very attempts to think. As the
present was the only object of contemplation
and thought, that only was enjoyed, and it was
enjoyed with a marvellous intemperance of blind
delight. Grief shortens life by bringing the
frame to an untimely grave; joy shortens life
by whirling away the hours with a rapidity that
surprises the traveller on the road of life.
Ju-
liet let the hours pass jauntily away, thinking
herself to be Fitzgeorge's goddess, when, in
truth, she was but his victim. Often, however,
in the course of her brief gaiety there were
hours of solitude, when the eye had no images,
and the spirits no stimulus; then would an un--

defined feeling of melancholy creep upon her,
and she would sigh, she scarcely knew where-
fore. But not long were her thoughts withdrawn
from Fitzgeorge; on him and his exalted quali-
ties, and generous sentiments, and amiable sym-
pathies, would she meditate with a fond delight
and an inexpressible rapture: and when after
slight intervals of absence they met again, then
did Juliet, rising from a momentary depression
of spirits, break out into an intemperate joy,
and she would meet her gentle Fitzgeorge with
go ardent an admiration, and so confiding a fond-
ness, that he almost felt himself flattered and
honoured. But pleasure is as restless as am-
bition;
these raptures, while their intensity in-
creased with Juliet, gradually abated of their
effect on Fitzgeorge. There was, however, one
delight which he always had, and which, with
him, never lost its charm, and that was the de-
light of splendid extravagance: and he fancied
that his love for Juliet remained long after it
had ceased to rule his spirit, because he felt

pleased with the splendour with which he sur-
rounded her.
It is, perhaps, possible, that love in a cottage
might have had charms for Juliet, but it is not
very probable that such love would have had
such powerful attractions as the love which
was manifested by a liberal expenditure, and
blazoned in a lavish display of wealth. Per-
haps it may be said of Fitzgeorge and Juliet,
that they were both deceived and both de-
ceiving

CHAPTER VI.
ALIENATION.
No man learns philosophy from books and
aphorisms, for if he reads that which he has not
experienced, he either disbelieves or misunder-
stands it. Fitzgeorge had read, and he had
been told by others, especially by the grave
philosopher who had once sat among his guests
at the festive board, that pleasure purchases
pain, and that pain purchases pleasure, and that
no mortal can enjoy unmixed pleasure. Fitz-
george had read, but he had not believed, that
man never is, but always to be blessed." True,
indeed, he found, and acknowledged to himself
## p. 108 (#120) ############################################
108
FITZGEORGE.
that he had found it to be, that in the very out-
set of his career of sensuality and luxury, he
had not experienced unmingled happiness.
Notwithstanding all the care which he had
taken, and all the unceremonious indifference
with which he had regarded the happiness,
pleasure, feelings, or accommodations of others,
when put in competition with his own, he still
found that he did not possess that perfect and
complete sensual enjoyment which he had
pro-
mised himself. He had not, in the possession
of his splendid establishment, and in the luxuri-
ous arrangements of his table, that continued
stimulus of whieh he was in search; but still he
could not and would not acknowledge that the
satisfaction after which he was aspiring was pro-
bably unattainable. He knew something of the
history of man-he had read of Creesus, Sarda-
napalus, Nero, and others, and there was not
one of them whom he thoroughly envied: he
saw that in the lives of all these were pains,
annoyances, drawbacks, and sad deductions ;
## p. 109 (#121) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
109
yet he could not and would not persuade him-
self that the same lot awaited him in all the
meandrings and changing scenes of his life.
When he was sighing for Juliet, he thought
that with her he must be perfectly and su.
premely blest; and for a while he fancied that
he was so. But gradually there came upon
his spirit a sadness, a weariness, a cold dis-
taste. Juliet's voice seemed to have lost its
music; her taste looked like servility, her fond-
ness was excessive ;- and when fondness trans-
gresses the lover's notion of what fondness
should be, it ceases to excite sympathy, and
provokes antipathy; and when antipathy is thus
once excited, no human power or art can ever
prevent its downward tendency to disgust.
There is no impossibility in nature so great as
the impossibility of recalling the departed or
departing passion of a once ardent lover. As
well might it be attempted to send the sun back
to the east, or to urge a river to its fountain's-
head, as to awake anew departed love.
## p. 110 (#122) ############################################
110
FITZGEORGE.
Fitzgeorge now began to find the fondness of
Juliet too excessive, her simplicity too insipid.
Her bright eyes had to his apprehension lost
their brightness, and he was for a while an-
noyed at the thought that he must either be at
the trouble of ridding himself altogether of her
society, or of keeping up an acquaintance which
had ceased to charm. At first he had some
little thought of the pain which he must of ne-
cessity inflict upon her whom he had once most
tenderly loved, and who had once most ten-
derly loved him. He had some thought of sighs,
and tears, and sobs, and passionate emotions;
and all these things troubled him, for he loved
a life of perfect ease, and wished to command
all the events of life, and to derive from every
circumstance and condition of his being the
mere pleasure, not only unmingled with pain,
but unalloyed even with the slightest annoyance
or inconvenience. Youth, however, let it be as
luxurious as it may, and as wanton and reckless
as it can be in the pursuit of pleasure, still has

FITZGEORGE.
111
some sentiments and emotions of generosity,
some little thought of others' feelings :and
with Fitzgeorge this natural feeling was not
quite gone, when he began to grow weary of
the faithful fondness of his once adored and still
adoring Juliet.
Juliet herself indeed perceived not, for she
could not, or would not, think of any thing so
dreadful as the abatement of Fitzgeorge's affec-
tion. She was still living in a confiding and
pleasing dream, that the romance of a few
months was destined to be the whole complexion
and character of her life. Pleasing indeed is
the credulity which, by shutting its eyes to the
precipice to which it is hastening, fancies by its
very blindness to escape the danger.
There were many gay, fascinating, witty, and
not highly-principled fair ones, who were jealous
of the place which Juliet held in the affections
and establishment of the gay and gallant Fitz-
george. Many were the artifices which one or
other used to attract
his attention and wean his

112
FITZGEORGE.
attachment. To all these arts for a while Fitzs
george was totally insensible : while he was de-
lighted with the society of Juliet, and happy in
her young and fond affection, he saw not the
fascinations of those who surrounded him, spread-
ing their various lines in hopes to catch his
roving heart. But when the fondness of Juliet
had satiated and begun to weary him  and
when he had ceased to regard her as the most
fascinating of her sex, and as the only individual
with whose mind and sentiments he had a per-
fect sympathythen he could look with a little
more attention on others, and from making com-
parisons which gave Juliet the preference, he
came to make comparisons not much to her
advantage.
Among the intimates of Fitzgeorge were men
of almost every description, save the demure
and sober and sentimental. Gravity had no
great recommendation for him, unless it was ac-
companied with a very high degree of talent;
but profligacy itself, especially if blended with

FITZGEORGE.
113
some share of buffoonery and singularity, was
always highly attractive. There was a young
gentleman who, having procured a commis-
sion in the army by means of Fitzgeorge's in-
terest, wished to show his gratitude to his be-
nefactor; and as we think that we most compli-
ment our friends when we present them with that
which we like ourselves, this young gentleman
thought that he showed his great regard for
Fitzgeorge by introducing him to society of
the most profligate description. Colonel Fitz-
maurice was a man of most singular and para-
doxical character; proud as Lucifer-vulgar as
a drayman-mean as a miser-extravagant as
the veriest spendthrift-aspiring to the highest,
and associating, at times, with the lowest society
-punctilious as a man of the nicest honour, and
yet at times careless of and almost inviting the
insolence of his companions-he seemed as if his
sole aim in life was to puzzle all beholders, and
even to astonish himself. It might have been
thought that he had two souls in one body,
## p. 114 (#126) ############################################
114
FITZGEORGE.
which delighted in laughing at one another, and
rendering each other ridiculous. He was one
whom you might find any where, every where,
and no where. His digressions were ludicrously
absurd, and he might have been considered ab-
solutely insane, but amidst all his eccentricities
he seemed thoroughly sensible of his own absur-
dities and to rejoice in them. The acquaintance
which he had with the world was such, that he
used not unfrequently to boast, that he was ac-
quainted with all the courts of Europe and all
the alleys of London. He was at home with
the highest, and equally at home with the lowest;
and, as the fancy took him, could assume the
dignity of a prince or the swagger of a tapster.
A genius of this description was naturally at-
tractive to Fitzgeorge, who was constantly on
the look out for something stimulating and
amusing. The laborious, thinking, and plod-
ding part of the world little knows and little
thinks the pains and trouble which they must
take who live only to amuse themselves, and

115
have but little wit to devise forms of amusement.
Fitzgeorge was attracted to Colonel Fitzmaurice
from the power which the colonel had of pre-
senting new ideas, combinations, and excite-
ments. The very character also of Fitzmaurice
was a matter of amusement in itself, and he was
the most stimulating of all the friends of Fitz-
george, because he was decidedly the most in-
dependent. Still, however, amidst all his in-
dependence, apparent and real, for it was not
all real, he knew how to humour Fitzgeorge,
and humouring, how to govern
him.
At the first acquaintance of Juliet and Fitz-
george, the colonel took no notice of the matter,
for he knew enough of human life to be aware
that young love is too grave a personage to bear
a jest. He also knew enough of the character
of Fitzgeorge to be very well satisfied that this
passion of his could not last for life or for
years.
He knew also that, while the violence of the at-
tachment continued, Fitzgeorge could easily dis-
pense with other society, therefore he seldom

116
FITZGEORGE.
presented himself and was not missed. But
still further he knew that when Fitzgeorge's
love for Juliet should abate, there would be an
opportunity for some other fair one to take her
place, and that for the making of this arrange-
ment some such friend as Colonel Fitzmaurice
might be very convenient.
Fitzmaurice could easily see that Juliet had
not strength of mind sufficient to be the master
as well as mistress of Fitzgeorge, and the colonel
naturally conjectured that if she could not be
his master she would not long be his mistress.
As soon therefore as any symptoms appeared of
an abatement of the ardour of Fitzgeorge's at-
tachment to Juliet, Fitzmaurice made his ap-
pearance again just in time not to be long
missed.
" The least expected, but most welcome
visitor!" exclaimed Fitzgeorge.
" You are not going to Ascot to-day I pres
sume ?"
Why not ?"
## p. 117 (#129) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
117
" Your friends say that the world is likely to
lose you, that there is but one attraction for
Fitzgeorge."
" Psha !" replied Fitzgeorge.
There was
a great deal of meaning in that apparently un-
meaning expletive; and no man had a keener
insight into such meanings than Colonel Fitz-
maurice, who with all his oddities, faults, follies,
failings, and eccentricities, had no small share
of discernment. Some of his friends indeed used
to say that his apparently singular manner of
living and miscellaneous habits of intercourse with
all classes in society, arose from the deep interest
which he felt in studying human nature; even
as a genuine and passionate botanist will as rea-
dily descend into a ditch as climb a green hill
in search of specimens. When Fitzgeorge
therefore met the colonel's allusion to Juliet by
an exclamation of impatience, Fitzmaurice
understood it to mean, as it really did, partly
that he was angry at the allusion to his fond-
ness, and partly that he was beginning, and
## p. 118 (#130) ############################################
118
FITZGEORGE.
more than beginning, to grow weary of the
object of that fondness.
This was the first time that Fitzgeorge had
even to his own ear given any expression to an
incipient feeling of weariness and disgust: and
he felt it somewhat of a relief and as a first step
to encourage him in throwing aside a feeble but
troublesome chain; of which he had been some
time tired, but of which he had not yet resolu-
tion to divest himself. A faint smile played on
the sarcastic features of Fitzmaurice. Fitz-
george observed it, and at that smile, whatever
slight compassion for Juliet he might have had,
vanished. He had been long thinking, though
not very decidedly, that his fondness was his
folly; he was now corroborated in his suspicions
by the look and smile of Fitzmaurice. With
what profound and indignant contempt, moral-
ists, in their studies, as they sit nibbling their
pens and balancing their periods, can think and
write of the weakness of mind which suffers
sentiment, sympathy, good feeling, and a prin-

119
ciple of possible virtue to wither beneath the
half-formed smile of a sneering witling and
yet, if the moralist would contemplate absolute
weakness and inanity, where can he find it in
greater perfection, than in his own arguments
and eloquence that are not competent to meet
and grapple with those sneers and contemptu-
ous smiles, and which cannot present to those
who live in society  panoply to the world's
censure, and enable them to hold up their heads
in spite of the sneers and reproaches of the pro-
fligate and silly?
Fitzgeorge and Fitzmaurice conversed for a
few seconds, with looks that said much though
they spake nothing. Fitzgeorge understood
Fitzmaurice to say that he was astonished that
a man of such sense as Fitzgeorge should al-
most withdraw himself from the rest of the
world for the society of a weak and fond girl.
Fitzmaurice understood Fitzgeorge to say that
he was now pretty well weary of the silly fond-
ness of Juliet, and that he was very willing, if

the matter could be managed without much
trouble, to relieve himself of the burden.
"Who is of your party for Ascot?" said
Fitzgeorge.
" A lady or two; you had better not join
us, there will be a little jealousy in a certain
quarter."
Fitzgeorge swore. It was rather an effort,
but it was in order to get rid of a burden that
lay heavily on his mind, and in order to break
the ice for more unreserved talk on the topic to
which allusion had been made.
Fitzmaurice saw his advantage, and that he
might speak very freely without fear of offend-
ing the magnificent and irritable Fitzgeorge. In
truth, the colonel had perceived, or had fancied
he perceived, that there was a lady of his ac-
quaintance who might supplant Juliet in Fitz-
george's affections.
Fitzmaurice had heard
Fitzgeorge in days past speak highly of the
lady's wit and spirit, and lately it had been ob-
served that in public, more than once or twice
## p. 121 (#133) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
121
Fitzgeorge had been evidently attracted by this
lady's charms. It was gratitude, and it was
interest also on the part of the colonel, that led
him to render himself so subservient to Fitz-
george's pleasures and so observant of his ca-
prices.
" Isabella will be of our party," said Fitz-
maurice," and if you are not afraid"
Fitzgeorge swore again more strongly and
more loudly than before ; and he joined the
party to Ascot.
Isabella was of plebeian origin, but of patrician
association and ambition. So obscure was her
origin, that no one knew whence she came, but
so brilliant was her career that her name was on
every tongue, and her figure was familiar to
every eye. She lived much in public, and in
public she talked loud and laughed loud. A
greater contrast with Juliet could not well be.
Isabella despised sentiment and sentimentality,
romance and pathos. She regarded the world
with a degree of arrogant insolence, and de-

lighted in most outrageously braving the cen-
sure of the grave and exciting the astonishment
of the timid and the modest. In person she
was handsome; in carriage, perfectly easy of
course, and by no means ungraceful. She was
said to be rather proud of a long neck and a fine
set of teeth; these personal ornaments indeed
belonged to her, and were much displayed; but
it is not quite so certain that she was proud of
them. Many were her admirers; and with no
small degree of confident impertinence did she
demean herself towards them. It was not sup-
posed by Fitzmaurice, however, that her style of
behaviour towards Fitzgeorge would be of the
same complexion as towards other of her ad-
mirers and suitors. In this he was disap-
pointed.
" Fitzgeorge will be at Ascot," said Fitz-
maurice to Isabella.
" There will be two objects of attraction,
then," was her reply.
" And, perhaps, the attractors of others will

be themselves attracted. You have never seen
Fitzgeorge but at a distance."
" Nor wish to see him but at a distance."
" You would be proud of an introduction to
him."
66 Prouder than I am now I never can be."
" You would be charmed by his fascinating
manners."
" I am already charmed to see him in public.
He is the very prince of coxcombs."
" He is something more than a coxcomb."
" He is so much of a coxcomb that I cannot
think it possible that he can be anything more.
But let me tell you, Fitzmaurice, that I admire
a hearty coxcomb. There is something really
magnificent in the heartiness with which the
man gives himself up to dress and luxury. I
hate the little meanness that loves puppyism and
pretends to despise it. I see nothing admirable
in the folly which affects not to enjoy the ad-
miration and envy of the world."
" You will allow, then, that there is some-

thing of genius in the sublimity and heartiness
of puppyism ?"
Clearly so."
" Suppose I were to tell you
that Fitzgeorge
was one of your sincerest admirers."'
" Can he admire any one so sincerely and
heartily as he admires himself?"
" Is there any value in the admiration of a
man who has not an admiration for himself ?"
Perhaps not.But allow me to say that if
Fitzgeorge has commissioned you to negociate
with me for an introduction to his acquaintance,
you
and he are both deceived in me."
The colonel had much difficulty in persuading
Isabella that Fitzgeorge had not given him any
such commission. After much talk Isabella put
an end to the conversation, saying, " I'll not be
sued at second hand."
All the world knew that Fitzgeorge intended
to honour Ascot with his presence, and there-
fore all the world went there to see him and to
be seen by him. The road there was a long line

of living beings for many a mile, not many a
weary mile, for the livingness of the scene re-
moved all idea of weariness. All eyes were
fixed on Fitzgeorge, and he drank in the visible
homage of admiration with no small degree of
satisfaction. His toilet had not been that day
neglected, but the lover of fashion saw new
wonders in his dress, and new graces in the style
of his attire. There was originality everywhere,
in every part of his dress, and in the very mode
of wearing it. Even on the race-ground he
was a living volume of haberdashery, a moving
cyclopedia of tailoring. The horses ran, and
lost or won. Purses changed owners; the usual
number of gulls and greenhorns paid the usual
price for their folly, but the interest, the general
interest, was in Fitzgeorge. It might have
seemed as though all the world were tailors,
and that Fitzgeorge was the model that they
were studying

caused many significant looks towards itself and
towards Fitzgeorge ;-an open yellow carriage,
splendidly decorated, and occupied by as pretty
a piece of female affectation as ever wore

The beautiful and interesting Juliet
was the occupant of the carriage. Fitzgeorge
was on horseback, and accompanied by Fitz-
maurice. As though fearful of encountering
the rude gaze of Fitzmaurice, or desirous of
drawing the voluntary and marked attention of
Fitzgeorge, Juliet studiously kept at a distance
from the group by which her idol was sur-
rounded; but her keen expressive eyes watched
his every look and every movement; her glances
were not, however, looks of jealousy, but looks
of love, of admiration, and of tenderness. She
saw also the bold and haughty Isabella stu-
diously displaying her valiant horsemanship
riding a fiery steed that gave her abundant
opportunity of exhibiting her fearlessness, and

finding, in the management of an almost un-
manageable animal, a task all but too much
for her nearly masculine strength. But pride
feels no pain, and the love of admiration will
encounter many difficulties for the gratification
of its passion. Many were the admirers of Isa-
bella's bold horsemanship; but Juliet thought
less of the spirit and pride of her horsemanship
than of the unfeminine boldness of her style.
Juliet looked upon her without jealousy, for
she believed so firmly in her gentle Fitzgeorge's
sincere and deep admiration of her own most
sweet and sentimental style of thought and con-
versation, that she thought it not possible that
he should admire ought so diametrically oppo-
site. Alas! poor simple Juliet made two mis-
takes. She mistook Fitzgeorge's flattery of her
sentimentality for his own sincere admiration of
it, and considered not that his politeness was so
exquisitely elastic that he could with as much
ease adapt his flatteries to Isabella as to Juliet.
She made also another mistake in not calcu-

lating on the possibility that sweets might cloy,
and that however heartily the voluptuous love
beauty, they are quite as deeply in love with
variety.
When Juliet observed that though Isabella
seemed almost purposely to throw herself in the
way of Fitzgeorge, yet she took no notice of the
slight and passing attention with which he re-
garded her, she concluded, of course, that his
pride must be offended, and she was antici-
pating at no short distance of time an interesting
and sentimental discussion with Fitzgeorge on
the folly and absurdity of masculine rudeness
in a female. Here again the simple Juliet mis-
calculated. There was to the mind of Fitz-
george something piquant and striking in that
bold and hearty independence of manner which
Isabella exhibited. Craftily did she watch the
movements of Fitzgeorge's countenance when
she arrogantly affected to be heedless of his
notice, and she saw there the smile of admira-
tion at her spirit, and no symptom of mortified
pride.

The day wore away. Fitzgeorge seemed not
to be conscious that Juliet was present. Was
it possible that he had really overlooked her ?
Could his so vigilant eyes overlook any thing ?
Did he not know the livery of her servants ?
He had devised their pattern, and had deter-
mined their colour. Could he have forgotten
her carriage, which had been built under his
own inspection ? Could he have forgotten her
dress, which had been of his own choice, and in
the arrangement of which he had suggested
many important improvements ?
She ordered her carriage to be driven in the
direction in which Fitzgeorge was.
Was it ac-
cident or intention, that at that instant he left
the ground ? If accident, how strange! If in-
tention, how much more strange! What a long
time it takes to open the eyes which have been
closed by the infatuation of fondness! There
is a love which displays itself by a fretful and
pettish jealousy, which cannot bear a wander-
ing eye or a roving thought, which seems to

fear the loss of its victim every movement that
it makes; and there is also a love stronger, per-
haps, in one sense, and in another weaker, which
cannot be jealous if it would, which is strong in
its own confidence, and confiding in its own
strengthwhich will not believe its own senses,
which, instead of seeing that which is invisible,
is totally insensible to that which is staringly
and outrageously visible, which possesses that
which may be called a negative imagination, for
it does not imagine that to be which is not, but
it imagines that not to be which obviously is.
Such was the love of Juliet for Fitzgeorge. He
had loved her once, and she had loved him-
her love for him was not abated, and therefore
she inferred, with a most defective, though not
uncommon logic, that his love for her was not
abated.
Juliet returned to her lodgings, and to the
perusal of the poetry which she and Fitzgeorge
had read together; to the perusal also of much
poetry written by herself. She luxuriated long

in metrical sighs and imaginary sorrows.
She
read of broken hearts, not thinking that her
own was to be broken, or that it should break
by its own weakness. She looked on Fitz-
george's miniature, sighed over it, wept over it,
kissed it, and pressed it to her bosom; her heart
swelled nigh unto bursting; she held the picture
at arm's-length, it almost seemed to live and
smile; she spoke to it, she trembled at her own
voice in the solitude of her apartment, and she
thought that her voice was really as musical as
Fitzgeorge, in the exuberance of his flattery, had
said it was.
She thought of him as the best,
the kindest, the dearest, the sweetest, the most
generous, the noblest creature in the universe;
as the highest of God's works, almost himself a
god. He was a god to her, for she worshipped
none else.
She was his by the fondness of an
unconquerable affection, and so spaniel-like was
her love, that had he spurned her with his foot,
she would have loved him still and have kissed
the foot that kicked her, as the lamb will lick

the hand that is raised to shed its blood. To
her Maker she merely said her prayers, but to
Fitzgeorge she looked with a living devotion.
No Catholic ever gazed on a crucifix with half
the veneration and holy zeal with which Juliet
gazed on the portrait of Fitzgeorge. What
eyes! how brilliant and how beautiful! What
lips! how full of sweetness! What a brow !
how full of noble and of generous thought!
She almost begged pardon of the very picture
for having even for a moment thought of think-
ing ought suspiciously of the original.
" No, no," said she to herself, " he cannot,
he cannot forget me, he did not overlook me,
his thoughts were with me, although his eye did
not meet mine. But he had his reasons, he is
as. wise as he is good ! His reasons are not for
me to comprehend. I must submit; I am his-
hismore than I am my own."
A volume of Pope's poems was lying on her
table, open as it often had been at the epistle
from Heloisa to Abelard. She read some of

the lines, indeed she knew them all by heart,
she thought them beautiful, but comparatively
cold.
" Heloisa," she exclaimed, " could not love
as I do, for what was Abelard compared to Fitz-
george ? a pedant to a prince! Is Fitzgeorge
noble, princelike ?Nay-nay, he is more! Oh,
God forgive me, subdue my fond heartI shall
be guilty of profaneness in my thoughts of him !
Oh, why was such perfection ever created ?"

CHAPTER VII.
A HEART-BREAKING SCENE.
Juliet's servant brought to his mistress, on
a silver salver, with no small share of ceremony
and respect, a letter. He seemed to look with
reverence on the letter, with reverence on the
silver salver, and with reverence on his mistress
who was thus distinguished with style and
honour to which she had not been accustomed.
With a sweet simper Juliet took the letter, and
she bent her graceful fingers into various af-
fected attitudes as she opened it. She knew
the writing and she knew the seal, yet she

135
looked at them interrogatively, as though she
would ask from whence the letter came.
With a soft sigh she said to herself, " And
when is my beloved to honour his slave with a
visit?"
This soliloquy was hardly uttered, when with
a shriek of agony the letter fell from her para-
lyzed hand.
Her servants were within hearing, and they
rushed unbidden to her assistance. The pale-
ness of death was on her face, pale was her
cheek and lustreless her eye. The presence of
her servants awakened her from her trance; they
lifted up the letter, she recovered for a moment,
she smiled their dismissal, and she in solitude
again perused and reperused the note which
had caused this extemporaneous agony.
" How beautifully he expresses himself !"
she said.
Let us see how beautifully he expressed him-
self. The following is a copy of his note to
Juliet.

FITZGEORGE.'
" We can meet no more. Circumstances
of a most imperious nature compel me to this
step, which is no doubt unpleasant to your
feelings, as it is, I assure you, to mine.' But
necessity has no law. It must be so. Believe
me ever yours.
" AUGUSTUS FITZGEORGE."

Notwithstanding the beautifulness of the
expression of this note, as she called it, its con-
tents came on her heart like a thunderbolt.
She was shaken to the very centre of her soul;
but her confidence in Fitzgeorge was not shaken,
nor was her love for him abated. She read the
letter ten, twenty, thirty times over. " Circum-
stances of a most imperious nature compel
me," She dwelt on this passage with such
an intensity of compassion that she pitied Fitz-
george for being under the influence of circum-
stances of such an imperious nature.
"Dear, generous Fitzgeorge !" she exclaimed,
"it is impossible that he should be forgetful of

137
his Juliet! He cannot, oh he cannot be for 
moment, even in thought, guilty of aught that
approaches the confines of cruelty-I know-I
am assured that he feels this as deeply as I can
do, nay, he even says that he does ;and no-
thing but truth ever came from his pen or fell
from his lips. Why should I not believe him?"
Then came tears to her relief, and she wept
abundantly. She wept long and bitterly, and
though weeping so far relieved her as to abate
the stunning sensation with which she had re-
ceived the intelligence at first, yet it left a more
settled melancholy upon her soul. She then
felt her solitary and sad condition. She saw
her utter destitution--her hopelessness and
helplessness. In spite of all her protestations;
in spite of all her blind fondness, she could not
quite keep herself free from the thought that
another had supplanted her in the affections of
Fitzgeorge. Her wilful blindness was not quite
strong enough to keep out every ray of the
light that surrounded her. Still, however, she

138
FITZGEORGE.
fought against the suspicion. She attributed
the apparent change in his affection to the in-
fluence of Lord or Lady Fitzgeorge. She gave
a most generous interpretation to the phrase,
" Circumstances of an imperious nature."
"But why," said she to herself, " did he have
recourse to this mode of parting? Why did
he not see me-speak to me and in his kind
and gentle manner soften the
pangs
of
separa-
tion. Alas! perhaps it would have been too
much for his own feelings; perhaps he thought
it would be too much for mine. His letter is
shortbut affectionate--very affectionate."
Then she read the letter again. She looked
into it with an eagerly scrutinizing eye, as if by
looking more closely at it and reading it more
frequently, she might be able to extort from it
more interpretation of itself, or to find some
new expression in it. But there it remained in
all its brevity, cruelty, and abruptness. Yet she
would not despair.
The letter reached her two days after she had

FITZGEORGE.
139
been at Ascot. It was morning when she first
read the letter, and the day had made approach
to its close before she ceased her perusals and
doubtful meditations.
"I will see him," she said at last ; " I will
see him-I must see him. It will be death and
worse than death if I see him not. Oh there is
pity in his generous naturehe is goodnesshe
is all goodness."
She ordered her carriage and drove to Fitz-
george's town house. He was not there. It
was growing dark, and not only dark but tem-
pestuous. Heavy clouds were rolling up from
the west, broad flashes of lightning were spread-
ing from the horizon, and the mutterings were
heard of the distant thunder. Timid as she
ordinarily was, and shrinking from the very
roughness of the breeze, she now heeded not
the coming storm, and was insensible to all
thought of danger or emotion of fear. She
astonished her coachman by ordering him to
drive to Fitzgeorge's country house. It was an
## p. 140 (#152) ############################################
140
FITZGEORGE.
amusement to her melancholy, and a kind of
living poetry for her to meditate on the sub-
limity of the storm. She delighted in the
thought that her love for Fitzgeorge rendered
her insensible to everything else, and communi-
cated a supernatural impulse to her soul.
It was nearly midnight when she arrived at
the mansion. The sound of merriment and
revelry was heard. Her arrival was announced
and a message came from the hall of feasting,
that Fitzgeorge was not to be seen. There was
madness in her agitated spirit. Never did the
acted drama present so complete and fine repre-
sentation of mental agony as did the expression
of Juliet's countenance and attitude at this
message. The messenger gazed at once with
pity and admiration at the perturbed and
agonized Juliet; for, on hearing it announced
that Fitzgeorge refused to see her, an electric
shock of agony ran through her whole frame,
the paleness of despair in an instant fixed itself
on her marble features, her hands convulsively

141
clasped each other, while lifting her eyes up-
wards she seemed to be asking of heaven the
mercy of a tear to cool the burning anguish of
her soul. She spoke not, she moved not, and
scarcely did she breathe.
"I have it in command from the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge," said the messenger after
an intcrval of painful suspense, "to desire that
you would immediately leave the house and re-
turn to your home."
He repeated his message several times before
Juliet paid the least attention to it, or seemed
in the slightest degree conscious that any one
was speaking to her. But presently her senses
returned, and on hearing the word "home,"
she shrieked in an agony of unrestrained pas-
sion, and exclaimed, "Home !-Oh GodI
have no home-no home on earth, no home in
heaven. For him I have sacrificed all-and
without him I am a solitary outcast. Did I not
love him ? did I not? do I not? and shall I
not for ever and ever? with him earth was hea-

venwithout him heaven itself would not be
heaven. I shall go madI am madI have
always been mad. It was madness to give
away my heartbut I have given it and it can-
not be recalled."
The messenger took her hand and led her to
the door; she withdrew it hastily, exclaiming,
"No no, touch it not, this hand is Fitzgeorge's.
Then softening a little the passionateness of her
expression, she said in a suppliant tone to the
messenger. "Oh, sir, if you can have any com-
passion for a broken and a bleeding heart, I
pray you, I entreat you by all the feelings of
humanity, to permit me to see my beloved Fitz-
george once more before I die. Oh plead with
him, plead with him, I beseech you, he will
listen to you. If I must be driven hence, let it
be by his own sweet voice. I must go if he
commands me, it is impossible for me ever to
disobey a command of his."
"Indeed madam, I must beg that you will
not urge it. It is, I assure you, absolutely im-
possible."
## p. 143 (#155) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
143
The violence of her passion returned, and her
madness rekindled itself. "I must, I must see
him, I cannot, I will not leave this place but at
his command. Oh no-no-no it cannot be.
Let me die here; life has nothing more for me
than darkness and sad despair."
Another messenger came from the hall of
feasting, where Fitzgeorge was surrounded by
half intoxicated flatterers, who were offering to
him the sweet incense of admiration. More
effectual language was used, and the spirit of
the wretched Juliet was at length subdued to
an acquiescence in the harsh mandate of the
unfeeling Fitzgeorge.
How strangely chequered is human life! In
the experience of some are continual alternations
of joy and sorrow succeeding each other at brief
intervals, while others have long continued
prosperity and daily gladness of heart, till some
unforeseen and unexpected event ruffles the
current of life, and then all the use of past joy
seems to be merely to render the present agony

144
FITZGEORGE.
the more intense. Some begin life in joy and
end it in tears--some through pain and sorrow
struggle on to peace and quiet and a happy
enjoyment. But without these, or some such
alternations, no life can possibly be passed. It
was the wish, aim, and hope of Fitzgeorge, to
have nothing but life's sweets and none of its
bitters. He was disappointed. As well might
a planet, revolving round a sun, expect to have
perpetual daylight in both hemispheres, as a
man may expect in this life to enjoy happiness
throughout unmixed with sorrow or pain. Fitz-
george made it the whole business of his life
and thought to study the means of enjoyment,
and to sacrifice every other consideration to the
pursuit of pleasure. As he carefully avoided all
that might be personally painful, so he as care-
fully avoided all sympathy with others, thinking
that pain for others' sufferings was merely in-
flicting a gratuitous annoyance on himself. From
being by constitution and calculation insensible
to the sufferings of others, he very naturally and

145
of course proceeded to the sacrifice, where it
could be made, of the happiness of others to
his own caprices. His consideration was his
own pleasure, and not the pain of others. He
had seen Juliet, and admired and loved her. He
sought and obtained her: and for the purpose
of obtaining her he had used all artifices and
protestations, which were only so far sincere, as
they were manifestations that he was in earnest
in his pursuit. For a while he had been well
pleased with her; but this lasted not long. As
her attachment to him strengthened and in-
creased, twining its fibres about her heart and
shooting its roots into her very soul, the passion
of Fitzgeorge gradually and almost insensibly to
himself abated, growing less and less, till at
length it was gone, and more than gone, for its
place was supplied by a growing disgust and
weariness. That fondness which once had flat-
tered him now wearied him, and he began to
entertain a contempt for her understanding that
she was not able to discern how exceedingly in-
VOL. I.

different he had become to her. It was not the
system of Fitzgeorge to sacrifice his own conve-
nience to any thing, but to sacrifice every thing
to his own convenience, humour, or passion. As
soon, therefore, as he had found out how very
indifferent he was towards Juliet, he was fain to
throw away his human toy. What she might
suffer was nothing to him, so long as her suffer-
ings were not communicated to him by the con-
tagion of sympathy or by the annoyance of a
visible knowledge. He had not activity enough
of imagination to enter into her thoughts, or to
imagine the acute feelings of her mind. It was
for his own sake, and not for hers, that he had
first sought her acquaintance; and now that
he dismissed her, he regarded merely his own
inclination, and had no regard for aught that
she might suffer. The sight of suffering is to
many persons an almost physical annoyance :
nature has implanted this principle in our con-
stitution, as the means of awakening our minds
to sympathy, and of inducing us to the activity

FITZGEORGE.
147
of beneficence for our own sakes, that this pain
or annoyance may be removed. When, there:
fore, a benevolently-disposed mind would move
itself to acts of generosity and kindness, it
brings before its contemplation the pangs of the
distressed, and sympathizes with griefs thought
of but not seen, so making to itself a pain, that
it may through that pain enjoy a pleasure. But
Fitzgeorge's notion was to enjoy pleasure only,
and to avoid pain with the utmost care and di-
ligence. He had so much of imagination as to
think that Juliet would suffer something of
mental distress at the separation, and he sup-
posed that if in his presence the sentence of se-
paration were pronounced it would be accom-
panied by some tears, perhaps some hysterics
and shrieks, all which would be painful to him-
self. This he was desirous of avoiding, and
therefore he had sent a mere letter of dismissal;
and as he was accustomed to a prompt obedience
from his many servants, and a ready compliance
with his humours from his more numerous and

FITZGEORGE,
more obsequious friends, he of course expected
that this mandate would readily and promptly
be obeyed by Juliet, and that she would keep
her sorrows to herself. In this he was disap-
pointed.
When Juliet came, therefore, to his house in
the passionate fulness of her grief, and inter-
rupted by her unwished presence the smiles
and gaiety in which Fitzgeorge had his being
and his glory, he was annoyed and provoked to
a petulance of irritation. Solomon has said,
that dead flies cause the ointment of the apo-
thecary to send forth a stinking savour, by
- which figure he means to set forth the fact, that
that which is most superlatively fragrant may
not only lose its fragrancy but become odious
to the sense by means of a trifling interruption;
for what is more fragrant than the unguent of
- the perfumer, and what more insignificant than
a dead fly? Solomon applies the proverb to
the effect of wisdom, marred and mutilated by
a little folly. It is equally applicable to the

FITZGEORGE
149
effect of much enjoyment interrupted by a
trifling annoyance. Fitzgeorge, who was a
mere sensualist, imagined himself to be an epi-
curean, and fancied that he knew aright the
philosophy of enjoyment; but he deceived him-
self, and he let his friends deceive him. He
prated and he fancied that he reasoned; he
plotted and he imagined that he planned. He
had not the wit to comprehend the system of
life's antagonisms, and to see that for enjoy-
ment there must be appetite, and that for appe-
tite there must be vigour of exertion, exercise,
pain, and self-denial. A gloomy philosopher at
his first symposium had told him this, but he
believed it not. He felt the pleasures of liberty
when he first brake the bands of his minority,
and he was full of joy, life, spirits, and vivacity;
but he had not the discernment to perceive that
he had, through the manifold annoyances of a
tedious minority, been preparing himself with
an appetite for the enjoyment of the exercise of
his unrestrained will. He fancied that the

pleasure of the first possession of liberty was
the prelude to more glorious delights with in-
creasing means and influence, and he regarded
the delightfulness of the commencement of the
days of liberty as prospective and promising,
not as retrospective and contrasted. He forgot,
or observed not, that the happiest of men owe
much of their happiness to contrast and hope.
Feeling himself, therefore, annoyed by this in-
terruption, he was angry with the cause of it;
and instead of pitying the pangs of heart which
the discarded one suffered, he was indignant at
her presumption in daring to obtrude her un-
welcome sorrows within the sacred confines of
his mansion dedicated to hilarity and festivity.
He sent, as it has been seen, a messenger to
order her instant departure; but as 'that first
message availed not, he sent a second in mighty
wrath, not a little pleased, perhaps, at the ex-
cuse which Juliet's importunity gave him, for
converting his possible pity into actual anger.

the persuasion of whose better managed entrea-
ties Juliet had been induced to comply with the
harsh command of her own gentle and affec-
tionate Fitzgeorge. The colonel who had the
power of being most rudely insulting, had also
an equal power of throwing into his behaviour
a winning gracefulness of manner which most
completely fascinated and deluded. He could
easily assume any character, for having none of
his own, the assumed one very easily fitted itself
to the wearer for the time being. Juliet, who
of the simple was the most simple, and whose
simplicity of character neutralized whatever
subtlety she might attempt to intermix with
the component parts of her mind and manner,
was absolutely softened and subdued by the in-
genious, yet heartless affectations of Fitzmaurice.
She believed him most sincerely when he at-
tempted, with a face of marvellous gravity to
persuade her that Fitzgeorge could not trust his
feelings to the proposed interview. She be-
lieved him when he descanted most learnedly,

152
FITZGEORGE,
yet most obscurely on those imperious circum-
stances which compelled Fitzgeorge to a line of
conduct apparently harsh and severe. She be-
lieved him when he told her with the hypocri-
tical mockery of compassion, that his heart bled
for her, and that he also as deeply pitied and
sympathized with Fitzgeorge, who was under a
most distressing necessity of doing sad violence
to his own feelings.
"He is a good and gentle being," said Juliet,
with affectation of manner, but with sincerity of
heart,
" He is all goodness and gentleness; the world
is not aware of the excellences of his heart and
understanding," responded Fitzmaurice, with
equal affectation of manner, but not with equal
sincerity of heart,
" This cannot be his own act and deed," said
Juliet.
" Most assuredly not," replied Fitzmaurice ;
"has he not in every heart and in every voice
the reputation of the highest generosity."
## p. 153 (#165) ############################################
FITZGEORGE,
153
"He has, indeed," answered Juliet ; " and I
pity him that he is placed under any circum-
stances of restriction which prevent him from
yielding to the generous impulses of his nature.
But might I not see him? One lookone kind
look-one word-one generous worday-
even the word "farewell'would from his lips
be a treasure of remembrance to my heart as
long as memory shall hold its seat."
The colonel shook his head and sighed. He
could upon occasion shake his head with an ex-
quisite gravity, and he could sigh with wondrous
pathos of hypocrisy. "Ah, no!-my dear lady.
-See him, did you say?"
"Yes-only let me see him-once-for the
last time!"
" Oh, my good madam, you know not the
tenderness of his heart. You know not the bit-
ter pang which it would cost him. Would you
afflict and pain your once beloved Fitzgeorge ?"
Once beloved !--Ever beloved !-That
once includes eternity! No-no-I would

not grieve my beloved one. Oh! rather may every
tear I shed, and every pang that I suffer, be the
means of joy and smiles to him. Let me but
know that he is happy, then nothing can make
me miserable."
" Generous heart!" replied the colonel ; " one
every way worthy of Fitzgeorge. I lament, from
my inmost soul, the hard necessity which sepa-
rates two hearts so truly noble and so well fitted
for each other. But the hour grows late.--Your
carriage is waitingpermit me to conduct you
to it. And spare your beloved Fitzgeorge all far-
ther
pangs of separation."
So Juliet was won and managed. Fitzmaurice
handed her to the carriage-gracefully, gently,
bowing and smiling; and Juliet returned the
courtesy of hypocrisy with the courtesy of since-
rity, peradventure not unmixed with affectation.
Tell himtell him," said Juliet, as she was
stepping into the carriage but swelling grief
prevented her from giving utterance to her
thoughts.
## p. 155 (#167) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
155
" Most assuredly," replied the colonel, some-
what less perfectly, than before, concealing his
impatience.
6 Teli him I love him, for ever, for ever!',
So saying Juliet seated herself in the carriage,
and Fitzmaurice with his own hands closed the
door, and with his own voice gave the word to
the coachman, "Home."
Away whirled the carriage, and at that word
"home," which the very horses seemed to un-
derstand, Juliet's heart sunk and nearly lost the
power of impelling the blood through her veins.
The storm in the atmosphere had passed away
and the night was still and clear; but the storm
in Juliet's bosom which had awhile been stilled
by the exquisite hypocrisy of Fitzmaurice, now
raged with greater fury than before. She loved
Fitzgeorge with a passion too strong for words
to express, and with a blindness that no light
could disperse or penetrate. She had been dis-
missed from his housebanished from his pre-
sence-prohibited access to him for ever. She

156
FITZGEORGE,
suffered a grief that seemed almost lost in its
own greatness. She had lost everything but the
power of suffering, and there was suffering
whithersoever she turned. What was memory
but the record of pleasures past, the recollection
of which gave pungency to present grief? What
was darkness but a living death? And what
was light but a gloomy solitude and a heartless
waste? For whom but Fitzgeorge had her
heart so long been beating? And what to her
had been the use of eye or ear, or gentle thought,
but to gaze on his beautiful form, to listen to
the music of his voice, and to meditate on the
generous qualities of his noble, his exalted
mind ? Now all this was gone-gone at once
and for ever! And wherewithal was this mighty
grief to be expressed or alleviated? Would a
few childish tears or girlish sighs suffice ?
She arrived at her home. Ah! what anguish
and ecstacy there are in that one word ! Poets,
moralists, and philosophers, have talked about
it ever since it had an existence, and they will

157
continue to talk about as long as the world shall
last. To Juliet the sight of home presented
nought but images of sorrow and promptings to
a sad despair. Fitzgeorge was virtually in-
scribed on every object that met her eye, and
actually engraven on many. Who had chosen
her residence ?-Fitzgeorge. Whose taste had
selected the furniture ?-Fitzgeorge's. From
whose library came those gilded and fragrant
volumes of heart-touching poetry ?From Fitz-
george's. By whose patronage did the artist
flourish, whose pencil gave life and animation
to those beautiful landscapes ?-By Fitzgeorge's
-kind, liberal patron of the arts ! Whose
miniature is that enshrined in gold and pearls ?-
Fitzgeorge's. And whither could Juliet fly from
these reminiscences ?-His shade would haunt
her every where; his image was blended with
all her thoughts.
While Juliet, thus discarded, was bewailing
her sad lot in a melancholy solitude, the heart-
less Fitzgeorge sat surrounded by his flatterers

and friends, for he was one who could not
distinguish friendship from flattery, and who
thought that there was no friendship where there
was no flattery.
" We have dismissed her," said Fitzmaurice,
laughingly, "and a finer scene I never saw.
She must go back to the stage, for she is sur-
prisingly improved in acting. She may at first
undergo a little hissing from the puritanical
geese, who have no other virtue about them
than hissing at vice; but when they see how
well able she is to entertain them by her dra-
matic talents, they will suffer their moral cen-
sures to be outvoted by their scenic applause.'
" So as she annoys me not again," said Fitz-
george, " she may go whither she pleases, to
the stage or to the"
Fitzgeorge paused, and gave a significant
look towards an individual of the party, who
was as unlike a clergyman as a man in a black
coat possibly could be. This reverend gentle-
man, for reverend he certainly was according to

159
law, had once professed as the law directs, that
he believed himself moved by the Holy Ghost
to take upon himself the function and office of a
clergyman; and the bishop believed him and
laid holy hands upon him accordingly; and he
forthwith became a teacher of morality, for
which he was as well qualified as a lame man is
to be a dancing-master: in other words, he was
more capable of performing his duty by precept
than by example. He was of course a bit of a
priest, but he was also a bit of a bully and a bit
of a blackleg. He could read prayers; he had
read prayers and had kept his countenance the
while. He had written pious cogitations in a
Sunday newspaper, and he had laughed at them
among his friends, for fear he should be by them
suspected of any temporary lapse into what that
coterie considered the unpardonable sin of piety.
He had slipped occasionally into the venial trans-
gression of intoxication, and had quarrelled,
and had called his man out and had shot at
him, but missed him. This reverend gentleman's

qualifications, which rendered him an acceptable
and favoured companion to Fitzgeorge, might
have been equalled or exceeded by many others,
but the graces of his mind received in the eyes
of Fitzgeorge an additional piquancy from the
clerical character which he bore. Oaths, drink-
ing, gambling and duelling, are to men of Fitz-
george's taste interesting in a layman, but more
particularly so in a clergyman. To this gentle-
man Fitzgeorge directed his eyes significantly
when he paused with an unfinished sentence.
"It would be an affront to your cloth, Brad-
ley," continued Fitzgeorge, after a moment's
pause, " to speak of the devil in your com-
pany."
" Make no stranger of me," said Bradley,
only if you must mention any friend of mine,
let it be respectfully."
" Respectfully enough I think it is mentioned
in company with so lovely a creature as Juliet,"
said Sir William Dangle with a sort of sigh,
intimating that if the lady were to descend to

FITZGEORGE,
161
the personage in question he should have little
objection to be of the party.
"What a pity it is Dangle that you did not
accompany her to town! Suppose she should
be met and robbed on Hounslow Heath," said
Bradley
"On that supposition," said Fitzgeorge,
" Dangle would think it no pity to be absent."
Dangle attempted to frown and look big, but
the insipidity of his features prevented the one,
and the subserviency of his spirit prevented the
other.
"Come," continued Fitzgeorge, "if the bot-
tle moves no quicker we shall part sober."
"In which case," said Drury Borrowman,
" we had better not part at all. Such is the
tenderness of my nature that I cannot bear to
part from dear friends, and I therefore am gene-
rally carried from them by main force."
" What is the toast ?" said Bradley.
" Variety !" exclaimed Fitzgeorge, " suppose
we drink it in pint bumpers."
## p. 162 (#174) ############################################

PITZGEORGE.
" It would be more appropriately drunk in
variety," quoth Borrowman.
" Excellently well said," exclaimed Fitz-
george. " Excellently well said," exclaimed the
rest of the party.
The wines were mingled. "Let us drink the
toast with spirit," said Bradley. The brandy
was not omitted. The large goblets were lifted
high in triumph. The villainous mixture was
quaffed. Down fell many a glass.
Down
dropped many a jaw. Eyes wandered, tongues
tripped ; lights twinkled ; round spun the room, ,
and the party parted after the usual style.
Those were glorious days!

CHAPTER VIII.
EMBARRASSMENT.
" Am I not happy now?" said Fitzgeorge,
as he woke next day with a burning brow and
feverish headache. " Am I not happy now?"
said Fitzgeorge, as certain twinges of remorse
came over him for his cruelty to the abandoned
Juliet. " Am I not happy now?" said Fitz-
george, as there came into his mind the thought
that he must this day meet his steward, and
with him discuss certain financial matters more
necessary than pleasing. "No," answered the
headache. No," answered the name of Juliet.
"No," answered the financial embarrassments.
## p. 164 (#176) ############################################

FITZGEORGE.
Owing, peradventure, to the paternal mild-
ness of the British Government, and to the un-
paralleled condescension of the British aristo-
cracy, a certain set of low-minded plebeians,
called tradesmen, whose proper business it is to
administer to the necessities, and to admire in
speechless awe and with distant reverence the
magnificence of their superiors, have of late
years, much to the injury of religion and good
order, taken it into their heads that they ought
to be paid for those things in which they mi-
nister to the aristocracy. They manage these
things better in Ireland, where the demand for
debt is met by a challenge to single combat,
and better still in Turkey, where the bastinado
is a receipt in full of all demands. Never can
the beauties of our glorious constitution be too
much extolled.
" I will see him at four o'clock," said Fitz-
george to his valet, who announced the arrival
of the steward.
"I will see him at six," said Fitzgeorge at
four o'clock.
## p. 165 (#177) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
165
" I will see him after dinner," said Fitzgeorge
at six o'clock. Seeing after dinner was with
him a matter of great uncertainty, he might see
two stewards, or he might see none at all.
Putting off the meeting from day to day did
not mend the matter, it added more items to the
account and rendered the discussion less agree-
able by previously irritating and unhinging the
mind. People began to talk ;people will talk,
which is all owing to the great condescension
of the aristocracy who let them talk. Trades-
men began to grumble;that also may be at-
tributed to the condescension of the aristocracy.
When the interview could be no longer de-
layed Fitzgeorge consented to see his steward.
The most homely proverbs are generally the
most frequently applicable, they become homely
from that cause. Applicable in the present in-
stance is the proverb which says, " One man
may lead a horse to water, but ten cannot make
him drink." Fitzgeorge was persuaded to see
his steward, and the steward came, bringing

with him serious looking books, serious looking
bills, and a serious looking face.
"Well, sir," said Fitzgeorge.
The steward bowed and looked as serious as
an undertaker. Then opening his books and
spreading his bills on the table, he was pre-
paring to commence a solemn harangue on the
sad necessities of the case. Fitzgeorge hastily
interrupted him saying, " What's all this to
me? These matters ought to be settled without
any reference to me. It is giving me much
needless trouble."
" But, sir," said the steward," if you will con-
descend to look into the state of your affairs"
" Pish," said Fitzgeorge, "I must beg of you
not to annoy me with this kind of prate. I was
not educated for an accountant, and am not
dexterous at such matters. If tradesmen bring
in their bills and you have money, pay them
if not; they must wait."
They have waited, sir," replied the steward:
" Then let them wait a little longer."
## p. 167 (#179) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
167
" They have waited as long as they possibly
can," answered the steward; " and they begin
to be
very
clamorous."
"Must you be clamorous, therefore?"
The steward spread out his hands and looked
at the books and at the bills, and fixing, at last,
his inquiring eyes on his master, said, " What
must be done?"
This was a question that the steward could
more easily ask, than Fitzgeorge could answer.
" It will not do," said the steward, "to tell
them that they will never be paid."
" It will certainly not do to tell them so," re-
plied Fitzgeorge.
" But they will begin to suspect it, and they
will be reluctant to supply the establishment.
Notice has also been given of a bond to a very
inconvenient amount, and threats have been
held out of applying to Lord Fitzgeorge.
At the name of the bond which he had given
to Juliet, and at the thought of another which
he had given to Isabella, a greater degree of

perplexity took possession of his mind than was
quite consistent with his notions of happiness.
Marvellous it is to those who do not think until
they deeply feel, that the very circumstance
which seemed to promise their greatest security
and completest enjoyment should prove a source
of pain and perplexity. So it was with Fitz-
george. When he first emerged from his mi-
nority and became possessed of a splendid in-
come, he thought, of course, that he was des-
tined to the enjoyment of every thing which
money could purchase; and so he was; but he
forgot that money could not purchase every
thing. Money will not purchase prudence, and
without prudence the greatest wealth will bring
the greatest poverty.
He is a great simpleton
who imagines that the chief power of wealth is
to supply wants. In ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred, it creates more wants than it supplies.
Keen are the pangs of hunger, and sad is the
spirit of him who is sinking into an early grave
for want of the common necessaries of life, but

FITZGEORGE.
169
not less keen are the mortifications and cares of
him who, nursed in ease and luxury, is thrown
by circumstances into dark perplexities which
his mental indolence cannot unravel, and who
is reduced even to an apprehension of the want
of those luxuries which were to him more than
life. The poor man who lives by bread alone,
lives for life alone; it is enough for him to be ;
but the rich man lives for morefor much more
than mere lifefor honour and reputation-for
the eyes and thoughts of others; and to him well-
being is more than being. The utmost that a poor
man can suffer from the most abject, scorned,
and deserted poverty, is to die for want; but
men in the highest spheres of human life suffer
many a living death. Can any one think for a
moment of comparing the pinings of want,
which come gradually and gently on the sinking
spirit, with the agonies of heart which he suffers
who has wrecked his fortune on the gaming-
table? Want merely unties the cords of life;
but disappointment, mortification, embarrass-

ment of circumstances, rends them with a hard
convulsive wrench, for the expression of which
imagination can find no adequate figures.
Fitzgeorge, then, in the presence of his stew-
ard, was not happy, very far indeed was he from
happiness. He began inwardly to curse the
perplexities of wealth, and, for a moment, to
envy the lot of those who, having a necessity to
earn their daily living, have an occupation in
their daily labour, and a pleasure in procuring
the means of pleasure and enjoyment. But
these feelings soon experienced a revulsion. He
began to philosophize, according to his notions
of philosophy, and the result of this philoso-
phizing was a still farther hardening of his heart
against the feelings of others.
These fellows," said he to his steward,
" dare not for their lives presume on the im-
pertinence of a personal annoyance; they may
send their insolent papers to you, and you may
them."
" But it is very distressing to me"-
## p. 171 (#183) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
171
" Silence, fellow, what are your distresses to
me?"
The distresses of his steward were something
to Fitzgeorge, and he felt that they were when
the mention of them excited his anger. Soft-
ening down a little, he continued, "And why
should you be distressed or concerned for these
matters?"
"I feel concerned," said the steward with
most reverent inclination of the head, " for my
worthy master's honour."
" Honour !" replied Fitzgeorge, in a tone of
slow contempt, "what have people of that des-
cription to do with honour?"
After a little pause the patient steward pushed
the books towards Fitzgeorge, and meekly said,
"Will you be graciously pleased, Sir, to conde-
scend to cast your eye over these memoran-
dums, and to suggest to your servant what
is best to be done in the present posture of
affairs ?"
" I have no suggestions to make," said Fitz-

george, "it is really very offensive to be an-
noyed by such people."
For awhile, however, he made an effort and
showed some symptoms of attention to the mat-
ters before him. He looked at divers bills, he
turned over many leaves in his steward's books.
He listened patiently or rather passively, to the
arithmetical prate
of the exact man of accounts.
The result of all this was to leave him precisely in
the same situation as it found him, that is to
say, with a conviction that his debts were nu-
merous, his tradesmen clamorous, his expenses
beyond his means, and that he knew not what
remedy to find or make for all these grievances.
Then pride was galled, confidence was shaken,
hope abated, and the insolence of a haughty
spirit was made to bite the dust.
Being at length left alone to the companion-
ship of his own thoughts, he turned over in his
mind many devices whereby to extricate himself
from present annoyances, and to provide, if pos-
sible, against the repetition of them. "I was

wrong," said he to himself, " in my computa-
tion of the unmixed happiness which awaited
me. I mistook the means of enjoyment for en-
joyment itself. I regarded a princely income
as an inexhausible income. I thought that be-
cause I could command much, I could command
everything. I have so far deceived myself, and
perhaps I have suffered my friends to aid in the
deception. No man, perhaps, can be deceived
by others till he first deceives himself. Yet
what avail my rank, my fortune, my expecta-
tions, my high consideration in society, if I am
nevertheless under the necessity of stooping and
bending myself down to the trammels of a mer-
cantile computation and prudential management
of my affairs. I thought that I had nothing to do
but to desire, and to have my desires satisfied ;
that I had only to name my wants to have those
wants removed. Juliet's bond too! There I
was indeed a simpleton. I would not for a
world have the world know how mortified I feel
at the recollection of the folly of my fondness

for that feeble creature. Oh, she has wearied
me with her ill-disguised adulation. I love the
incense of flattery, but I am disgusted with the
clumsiness that offers it so crudely and so
grossly. Her bond indeed! Why the poor
fool would even now let me have it again. I
have only to ask for it and I may have it. Ay,
is there meanness in the thought? But who
shall dare accuse me of meanness? Who can
look on me, formed in the fairest symmetry,
graceful in every movement, honoured and idol-
ized wherever I turn, the envy and admiration
of all eyes, and call me mean! The world will
find a thousand excuses for me more ingeniously
and readily than I can find them for myself.
The world has indeed a strange mode of mea-
suring out its justice; for ten guineas ingeniously
given where there is neither claim nor expecta-
tion, I may purchase a reputation for generosity
which thousands withheld, where there is a claim,
will not be able to cancel."
Fitzgeorge pursued his soliloquy, and medi-

tated on the resources of those who, having no
resources, continue to live on a par with those
who have. He thought of the turf and the
gaming-table, of the many ingenious devices
who pass tolerably well in the world,
tolerably, that is to say, in such society as Fitz-
george was in the habit of keeping, have at
various times had recourse to in order to reple-
nish a consumptive purse, or bolster up a sink-
ing credit. It occurred to him that there were
many stratagems that might be used which as
yet had not been used, and which might be used
with good success. It is an erroneous notion
which is entertained by many persons in the
middling and humbler walks of life, that the
higher and titled classes have nothing to do but
to devise means and modes of spending money,
and that they have no trouble to procure it, nor
any anxiety and care about its regular and con-
stant supply. 'Tis quite the reverse; they have
no trouble as to the means of disposing of it,
but often they have very great difficulty and

perplexity as to the means of obtaining it. You
see a splendid carriage standing at the door of a
magnificent mansion, many servants in livery
about the entrance of the house and carriage;
these servants are in lively conversation with
each other; presently my lord makes his appear-
ance,-all is silence and obsequiousness, six or
eight human beings seem to be worshipping
one, the carriage looks a remarkably easy one,
the coachman is a portly man, and the horses
lead a fine holiday life. The blind beggar who
stands by the way side, assisted by a little dog
that holds in its mouth the battered crown of a
greasy hat, has not a tithe of that anxiety for
the means of procuring a dinner which the no-
bleman, who looks so placidly, has for getting
rid of some villainous incumbrance which is
eating out his very vitals and wasting away his
life day after day.
This was a kind of care which Fitzgeorge had
not contemplated or anticipated, and when he
laid down his plan of life and looked from the
## p. 177 (#189) ############################################

177
gay portals of his youth through the long vista
of coming years, he saw all bright and clear
before him. Tis true that he heard of the
poverty of the rich and the necessities of the
splendid, but then he had seen them gay, laugh-
ing, lively, always apparently at their ease, as if
mocking fate and fortune. He did not know
what bitterness of heart lay concealed beneath
those smiles. He now began to experience it,
but this did not soften his heart or the more
humanize his soul, rather was it the means of
inducing him, after the manner of Pharaoh, to
harden his heart still more.
Pride and sensu-
ality, two strong passions of our nature, have,
when indulged in without restraint, a sad pro-
pensity to degrade and injure the soul; but
when persisted in systematically, they are by
some accident thwarted and opposed, then there
springs up a bitter and malignant feeling in the
mind which quite u humanizes the man. And
he that is not at peace with himself is not at
peace with the world; he has no regard for the

well-being of others, he has no consideration for
them, but rather looks upon them as his enemies
and uses them accordingly. So it may be found
in every class of life, from the highest to the
lowest, that they who directly or indirectly
plunder and prey upon their fellow men, are
such as have been disappointed, thwarted, or
opposed in their sensuality or pride.

CHAPTER IX.
STRATAGEMS.
It is a hard thing for a man to be forced to
live upon his wits who has no wits to live upon.
But this is seldom the case; wit of some kind
or other most men have, and even if nature have
given them none, necessity will supply the
deficiency. There is wit of various kinds, from
the highest degree of intellectual discernment
and sagacity, down to the lowest and dirtiest
degree of craft and cunning. There is wit in
the elbow of the gambler and in the fingers of
the pick-pocket. There is wit in well-balancing
the betting-book and in devising some scheme

whereby that which shall seem chance to the
loser is certainty to the winner. It is not, per-
haps, quite so easy as some persons imagine,
to draw the precise line between skill and craft.
A definition may, indeed, be given in so many
words, but there is a difficulty to make particu-
lar and individual cases square exactly with
that definition. Almost every new case requires
a new law; the whole system of human society
is a sort of jockey club, and all the vast appa-
ratus of legislation is but a multiform and com-
plex contrivance to guard against foul play.
The distinction between cheating and outwitting
is remarkably fine, and, perhaps, in many minds
is rather evanescent and shifting. He who has
few wants and many means of supplying them
is far more fastidious in the matter of honesty,
than he who has many wants and few means of
supplying them. It is, however, necessary for
the keeping of society together, that there
should be something like principle everywhere
and in all social transactions, so that while we

find among honest people more roguery than
we had expected, we find among rogues more
honesty than we had expected.
Fitzgeorge had horses at Newmarket. They
had served him for playthings and as topics of
talk. He had at Ascot and at Newmarket been
familiar with the principal sporting characters
high and low, more especially the latter. There
was a pungency and piquancy in the style of
this kind of society which was an exquisite re-
lief to the more reserved and formal intercourse
of the metropolis. He had won and lost at dif-
ferent times, but had not kept any exact record
of either winnings or losings. Perhaps he had
a stronger recollection of his losings than of his
winnings, inasmuch as the former were more
disagreeable than the latter, and therefore made
a deeper impression; for as every one expects
to win, losing produces a shock of disappoint-
ment and mortification. He knew that many
frequented Newmarket whose only income was
the produce of their wits, and he supposed very

naturally that some of his losses had been the
consequence more of the superior dexterity of the
winner, than of the regular chapter of accidents.
It now came to the turn of Fitzgeorge to avai.
himself of those little irregularities of arrange-
ment by which chance is made certain, and by
which the blind goddess is persuaded to lift up
the bandage from one corner of her eye, and
cast a look of partiality to some ingenious votary
of hers. He had a horse entered to run at
Newmarket, so great a favourite, that scarcely a
single bet could be got against it. But know-
ing ones are sometimes taken in, and so it hap-
pened in the present instance. This most won-
derful horse, on which the most sagacious and
experienced men at Newmarket would have
staked their whole fortune, did by some caprice
of fortune, or by some mismanagement, or by
some management, lose the race.
Fitzgeorge himself was on the ground, watch-
ing the race with an anxious eye. He had some
few bets on the favourite, not many, though it

was afterwards ascertained that he might have
had more if he would. The few that he had, of
course he lost; but instead of congratulating
himself on his good fortune that he lost no
more, he was exceedingly angry that he lost.
He cursed the horse, and he cursed his stars,
and he cursed the jockey, and he cursed those
who won his money, and he cursed himself who
lost it. So many and so various curses seldom
at one time, and on one occasion, pass the lips
of one individual, as at this time and on this
occasion passed the lips of the Honourable Au-
gustus Fitzgeorge. They who were about him
on the turf, knowing his imperious disposition
and the impatience with which he bore the
slightest opposition to his will, or contradiction
of his humour, were not a little amused at the
towering passion into which he was most gra-
ciously pleased to put himself on the present
occasion. Then, when this wonderful horse had
lost, the knowing ones began to find out that
they had suspected beforehand that it must be

FITZGEORGE.
so. They were like certain ingenious politicians
who, prophesying what will come to pass,
never tell their prophecies till the event is
found to coincide with the prophecy. Then it
was discovered that the horse had been exces-
sively overrated; many said that they would
have betted more against it, if they could have
found takers. Verily it was a marvellous thing
that, before the horse did run, there should be
so few betters against it; and that after it had
run, there should be a complaint that there were
so few takers against it.
: Another chance, however, was to be given
to the unfortunate animal, in order that it
might regain its lost reputation. To gain a re-
putation is a very difficult task; but to regain
: reputation is almost next to impossible. It is
so with human beings, and, perhaps, the gen-
tlemen of the turf who know as much of horse-
flesh as they do of human nature, if not more,
thought that it was thus with horses; for they,
one and all, dissuaded Fitzgeorge from ventur-

ing a second time the animal which had de-
ceived him once. But he would not be moved ;
he felt confident, he said, that it would win the
next time, and he was ready to back his opinion
to any amount. However, when certain odds
were offered, he seemed to be rather shy of
taking; and the prudent ones commended him
for being content with his first loss. Even the
jockey who was to ride, did not seem very ready
to take the bets that were offered him. So the
late favourite was at a miserable discount.
Every mouth was now loudly opened against
the unfortunate beast, and most absurdly extra-
vagant odds were offered, which seemed to be
almost as absurdly refused. Just before start-
ing, however, Fitzgeorge, by way of obliging
some particular friends who were anxious for
the honour of being in the books of so great a
man, took a few bets that were offered to him,
and as he seemed exceedingly indifferent, and
betting, as it were, in despair, he had at length
a very pretty book to shew with very pretty and

responsible names embellishing it. He looked
as demure and dull as if he had no concern in
the business of the turf; and when the signal
was given and the horses started, he scarcely
looked towards the course, and only woke from
his reverie when, to the astonishment of all con-
cerned, and apparently as much to his own as-
tonishment, his horse was declared the winner.
Then he very smilingly received the congratu-
lations of his friends, and he was once more at
his ease again.
Fitzgeorge was not quite so well pleased a few
minutes after the race as he had been immedi-
ately on its termination. He was not left quite
alone, but by some queer accident, of course he
could not think it anything but accident, but
so it happened, that those who usually on these
occasions attended him into the town eagerly
conversing with him, and delighting in the no-
tice which he might condescend to take of
them, now were conversing with one another,
and were apart from him. He might have

joined the party, but he was a proud man,
and
thought it rather their business to pay court to
him than his to pay court to them. Yet he
could not help, in spite of himself, casting now
and then a sidelong and significant look towards
the group, which look of his they saw and un-
derstood. Presently the party separated a
little, and one or another joined conversation
with him. Amongst them was Colonel Fitz-
maurice, who pushing his horse between Fitz-
george and a plebeian black-leg, who was riding
in proud familiarity by his side, abruptly
said,
" Rather lucky to-day."
" Better than I had reason to expect," replied
Fitzgeorge, constrainedly.
" You did not expect to win?"
Of course not."
" And I suppose you did not expect to lose
the first race ?"
Of course not."

in gold. Worth all the rest of your stud. You
would not part with him for a trifle."
"For a trifle I certainly would not. He ought
to have won the first day," said Fitzgeorge.
" So I thought," replied the colonel, "and
so thought everybody, I believe, but there are
some horses that will win and lose just as they
please ; I think I could make a princely fortune
with such a horse as that, if I always knew when
it would win and when it would lose."
Others of the party joined them, and the con-
versation became general. Not a word more
was said about the race, and in the evening
Fitzgeorge found himself in rather humbler
company than usual at the hazard table. If he
had won every shilling that the whole party was
worth it would have been but of little service to
him. He retired therefore early in some degree
of disgust.
Another race-day remained, but he attended
it not. He vanished early in the morning and
dined that day in London, knowing what it is

189
to have a smiling face wherewithal to cover an
aching heart. Now again there came to his
recollection the dismal view which the gloomy
philosopher had taken of human life. But he
was not convinced that this was a correct view.
It is true that just at the present moment he
felt himself not at ease with himself; he had
been using a stratagem, an artifice, a trick, and
he more than suspected that it was seen through.
Here was a double, a triple, a quadruple morti-
fication; he was mortified and annoyed at his
own want of dexterity, that he had not been
able to manage the matter better; he had for-
gotten that he was surrounded by keener eyes
and longer heads than his own; he was mor-
tified at the decided manner in which it seemed
to be taken up by the party at Newmarket, who
were in general so exceedingly obsequious to
him. It was a sad mortification to be looked
down upon by those who had been habituated
to look up to him; saddest of all, however,
was the thought that when 'settling-day should

arrive he might have no plea for refusing to pay
his losses, and no claim whereon to demand his
winnings. He was annoyed not a little at the
rude familiarity of Fitzmaurice, whom he could
not so easily repel and wither by neglect as he
could many others. Fitzmaurice could take
liberties which no other man could. Thus in a
comparatively short space of time, Fitzgeorge
made the discovery that it was possible for a
young man of high family, of large fortune, of
elegant manners, of great political influence, of
remarkably handsome person, and in the stu-
dious and careful pursuit of pleasure, and only
pleasure, to be involved in circumstances of mi-
serable perplexity and most irritating annoyance.
Had
any one at the very commencement of his
career told him, that a time was not far distant
when money and reputation should both at once
fail him, he would have regarded the prophet
with utter incredulity. Into this perplexity,
however, he was now brought, and he saw no
immediate means of extricating himself.
## p. 191 (#203) ############################################
FITZGEORGE,
191
The effect of all this was not to give him
more rational and consistent ideas of human life
and its interests, but to determine him to a still
more studious and decided pursuit of his own
peculiar pleasure and enjoyment. He did not
learn wisdom from experience, but was the more
confirmed in his folly of expecting even yet un-
mingled pleasure. It is true that he felt op-
pressed by present dejections, and embarrassed
by present difficulties ; but he had hopes, even
good hopes, of surmounting present difficulties,
and of rising above his present dejection. He
had still all the elasticity of youthful hope, and
though so far he had found some little practical
contradiction to the notion which he entertained
that he was destined only to the enjoyment of
unmixed pleasure, yet he regarded this as merely
an accidental occurrence, not likely to be re-
pealed, and far from being the natural and un-
avoidable condition of his situation and moral
temperament. That fine and invaluable lesson
which nature means to teach the luxurious and

the sensual through the pains and mortifications
which luxury and indulgence inflict, Fitzgeorge
had not the wisdom to learn or the faith to be-
lieve; for Nature, when it visits the sensualist
and the luxurious with sadness, perplexity, and
ennui, means by that sad discipline to inform
them that such is the condition of human life,
that we have only to choose between the in-
voluntary pains which spring from indulgence,
selfishness, and indolence, and the voluntary
pains of mental diligence, thought, and moral
application, which will most certainly be fol-
lowed by a fairer enjoyment of pleasure, or by
that moral energy which bears up against ad-
versity, converting sorrow itself into a blessing,
by the fortitude with which it is met and endured.
The settling-day at Tattersall's was near at
hand. Fitzgeorge had many of those things
which the world calls friends, but not one of them
had mentioned the matter to him. In fact, no
mortal being can be a friend to him who is no
friend himself; but the courtesy of human lan-

FITZGEORGE.
193
guage requires the frequent use of the word
friend ; and as it is most frequently used with
greater latitude than accuracy, let it pass and
be used in this narrative, as it is all the world
over. Fitzmaurice, however, the boldest and
most careless of all who called themselves
friends, and aspired to an intimate familiarity
with Fitzgeorge, presented himself the day be-
fore settling-day, and without any preface said,
"Do you go to Tattersall's ?"
The question was put in such a manner that
Fitzgeorge understood it perfectly well, and
with the understanding of it there entered into
his mind a feeling of as deep mortification and
bitter annoyance, as ever human being endured.
Although mental pain is far more acute and
distressing than bodily pain, yet when mental
pain is at the greatest, it then produces a degree
of bodily pain. Fitzgeorge felt this;  his
pride was wounded, stung, agonised. He
felt himself to be prodigiously little: Fond
as he was of pomp and show and gorgeous de-

coration, he could not at this moment have
enjoyed all the pomp and splendour which the
east showers upon her barbarous monarchs;
for it was not merely for the sake of his own eye
that he loved splendour, he had regard to the
eyes, the envy, the approbation of others, and
he felt that it would be a miserable mockery to
be surrounded with splendour, while he himself,
the centre of all that brilliance, was an object
of scorn and contempt. For a moment he was
humbled, and he humbled himself to say to
Fitzmaurice, "What would you advise?"
" I would advise you to stay at home," was
the reply.
" The bets were fairly won," said Fitzgeorge.
" There are differences of opinion on that
topic," replied the colonel ; " and I can tell
you
that the fellow who rode your horse has
undergone an examination before the Jockey
Club."
"Well," replied Fitzgeorge, affecting a great
degree of indifference.

" 'Tis not well," said the colonel, " I am com-
missioned to inform you that you are no longer
a member of the Jockey Club."
Fitzgeorge was pale with anger. "How were
the votes ?"
We never tell tales out of school."

CHAPTER X.
A VISIT FROM MR. GRAVES.
That a young man in the morning of life should
be out of spirits, that a man of large fortune
should be in want of money, that a person of
high rank should be in deep disgrace, that a
studious and attentive pursuer of pleasure,
having all the apparent means of pleasure in
his possession, should not only miss the object
of his pursuit, but bring himself into trouble
and annoyance, was perplexing indeed and pa-
radoxical to Fitzgeorge, who could scarcely un-
derstand his own situation. He had indeed left
his paternal roof, and so far was removed from
## p. 197 (#209) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
197
paternal restraint; but he yet stood somewhat
in awe of paternal admonition, for he knew not
where to look but to his father's purse to supply
his present deficiencies, and to help him through
his present difficulties. He was extremely re-
luctant to make the application, for he was sure
of reproof, but not sure of relief. Lord Fitz-
george, the father of our hero, was an ordinary
man in extraordinary circumstances, having a
little mind but great wealth and power, deep in
a fox-like cunning, but not profound in real
thought; quick in conception, hasty in utter-
ance, seeing well what he saw at all, but not
seeing much; loving power and all that gave
or strengthened power, therefore loving money,
which gives power to any rank of life, and the
want of which takes power from the highest :
he knew that a rich peasant has more power
than a poor lord; and as he loved wealth and
power with an equal and undivided affection, he
loved them alike even to their minutest fractions;
his fingers disdained not the touch of copper,

198
FITZGEORGE.
and he was not satisfied with the mere homage
of his tenants, unless he knew that the meanest
scullion in his kitchen was also conscious of
his power. He loved power with so hearty
an attachment, that he was not satisfied with
the possession and exercise of it during the time
of his natural life, with the certainty of trans-
ferring it to his posterity; he would fain have
it buried with him, and was absolutely jealous
of his heir. After the manner of all little minds
he made a fuss about everything, he could take
nothing coolly; so that in fact he could hardly
be said to use wealth and power so much as to
be used by them, they were not so much his as
he was theirs ; he had not a power over power.
Thus also he was, like a weak and silly lover,
jealous where there was no real ground for jea-
lousy; showing his weakness where he thought
that he was displaying his power ; losing the
substance for the sake of the shadow of homage;
using ever a kind of left-handed cunning which
he mistook for wisdom. He was also mightily

FITZGEORGE.
199
religious withal-made his appearance very re-
gularly at church, attracting the eyes of the
congregation by the loudness with which he
made the responses, as if he had been candidate
for the place of parish clerk, criticizing sermons
and detecting all traces of false doctrine; yet so
impatient of being preached to, that he would
express manifest symptoms of weariness, if the
discourse lasted beyond a certain number of
minutes. He would, had it been possible, have
been
parson
and clerk too in his own church.
Like many other persons whose religion is of
this noisy kind, he made great secular use of
his religion, and on the strength of it dogmatized
much on other matters. The undefined syllo-
gism which passed through the mind of Lord
Fitzgeorge on the subject of religion was some-
thing like the following: It is right to be reli-
gious, I am religious, therefore I am right, and
if am right, nothing that I say, think, or do,
wrong; but if nothing that I say, think,
or do, can be wrong, they who say, think, or
can be

do, that which is contrary to my notions must
be wrong. Hence there is a pleasant amd inex-
haustible topic of apology for all manner of
impertinent interference with others, and as this
interference is generally more or less resented,
hence there arises a spirit of waspishness and
irritability.
Now this Lord Fitzgeorge had a confidential
and favourite servant, or steward, called Mr.
Graves, and to this servant, so far as his lord-
ship could entrust or confide any thing, he trusted
the
management of his estates and the receipt of
his rents. Man and master seemed to be made
for each other; there certainly was a difference
in their characters, but this difference was but
necessary for their relative situations. Mr.
Graves was born of honest parents, and had re-
ceived an education which fitted him, in all re-
spects, for the situation which he held under
Lord Fitzgeorge. He resembled his master in
his love of power, but he and his master did not
quarrel on this point; for instead of entertaining
## p. 201 (#213) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
201
any feeling of jealousy towards each other, they
found that their power was mutually strength-
ened; for Mr. Graves had no power except what
he acquired under the patronage and in the ser-
vice of Lord Fitzgeorge; and his lordship also
found that his power was increased and strength-
ened by the faithful services of Mr. Graves.-
When Mr. Graves first came into the service of
Lord Fitzgeorge he was a very young man, but
had nothing youthful about him save the date of
his birth. He was as cool-headed and sedate as
a man of sixty. He had no other passion than
the love of ruling; and so well and heartily did
he love to rule, that for this purpose he would
submit himself, with the most perfect elasticity
of obedience, to all the commands and caprices
of Lord Fitzgeorge. There seemed to be on
either side a sort of understanding that they were
essential to one another; and each submitted to
be made a tool of, while each thought that he
was out-witting the other. Lord Fitzgeorge
never undertook any thing in the management

FITZGEORGE.
of his estates, or the disposal of his family, with-
out first consulting Mr. Graves. This consulta-
tion, however, was not for the purpose of asking
advice, but to be more firmly fixed in his own
opinion, by the additional suffrage of another.
Mr. Graves found his situation as steward to
Lord Fitzgeorge by no means a sinecure: he had
much business constantly on his hands, and he
was under the necessity of keeping in his ser-
vice, and attached to his interests, a consider-
able number of spies and tale-bearers, from whom
he learned every thing that was going on in the
world that at all concerned Lord Fitzgeorge, ei-
ther directly or indirectly. Of course, among
other matters, he was not unacquainted with all
the proceedings of Augustus Fitzgeorge-with
all his perplexities and stratagemswith his ir-
regular habits and disorderly associates. All
these matters, as in duty bound, he communi-
cated to his master; for it is an especially crafty
contrivance of cunning varlets to be filling the
ears of their masters with all the minuteness of
## p. 203 (#215) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
203
gossip and tittle-tattle; by this contrivance they
at first imply and at last obtain confidence. It
is in service as in friendship, and in all the in-
tercourse of human life, that no one great action
prevails so much over the mind, to win and to
rule it, as an infinite number of small and mi-
nute attentions. A servant who should save his
master's life, house, or fortune, would not creep
so effectually into his master's good graces, as
one who should be always carrying to his ear the
prate, prattle, and idle gossip of the neighbour-
hood, especially if the said master were a little-
minded man, having a strong appetite for such
food.
It was exceedingly obvious to Mr. Graves, that
Lord Fitzgeorge was jealous of his son, envying
him his present popularity, and grudging him
the reversion of the title and estates. But Mr.
Graves knew better than to let his lordship
know that he saw all this:-lie was able to in-
dulge his lordship in the encouragement of his
evil feelings towards his son, without giving an

204
FITZGEORGE.
intimation that he suspected their existence.-
Lord Fitzgeorge saw no newspapers but such as
Mr. Graves thought proper to put in his way;
for it is a remarkably wise arrangement of the
British Constitution, for which, no doubt, we are
indebted to the wisdom of our ancestors, that
hereditary legislators should be kept in profound
ignorance of the people for whom they have to
legislate. We have two houses of legislature,
one of which knows the people and the other
does not, and these two houses must agree be-
fore any bill can be passed into a law. But let
Mr. Graves never withheld from
Lord Fitzgeorge any newspaper which recorded
the mad freaks, follies and vagaries of the young
Augustus; and when there appeared in a morn-
ing paper an account of the expulsion of the
young hopeful from the Jockey Club, Mr. Graves
took care that Lord Fitzgeorge should see it.
After breakfast, when the steward waited on
his lordship for his orders, the following dia-
logue took place between them.
that pass.
## p. 205 (#217) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
205
" Graves! Graves! What's this? Look here
-look-read-read!" said his lordship, hand-
ing the paper to the steward, who looked at it as
calmly curious as if he had never seen it before.
When he had read the paragraph that was
pointed out to him, he returned the paper to his
master, and lifted up his eyes, and sighed at
the wickedness of the young man as heartily as
Blifil used to bewail the wickedness of Tom
Jones.
" Is it possible, my lord ? Can it be true ?-
Surely there must be some mistake. How
very
unfortunate that this melancholy intelligence
should have come thus abruptly to your lord-
ship's knowledge."
" Unfortunate! No, no-not at allnot at
all-glad I know it. Shall know how to ma-
nage him now ! Get him in my power! he shall
marry, that he shall-or he shall not have an-
other sixpence! Graves, go and tell him that
he must marry immediately, as the only chance
of receiving any assistance from me."

FITZGEORGE.
" Yes, my lord," replied Graves; "but to
whom would your lordship wish him to pay his
addresses ?"
" Pay his addresses !" exclaimed Lord Fitz-
george : " he pay his addresses !Nonsense ! -
I'll provide him a wife;but tell him he must
marry. I can manage him better when he is
married than I can now."
" Your lordship, then," replied Graves, with
the utmost formality, "would have me inform
the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge, that it is
your lordship's sovereign will and pleasure, that
he should hold himself in readiness to marry
whatever lady your lordship may be pleased to
select for him."
Exactly so," replied his lordship; "if I
leave the choice to him, he will be ten years
making it. No, no!I had no choice, as any
body may see, and I will not suffer him to have
one. Now, Graves, you understand me."
" Perfectly, my lord."
Ay, ay! you are a clever fellow, Graves-

FITZGEORGE.
207
very clever fellow ! I should not know what to
do without you. You shall go to Augustus di-
rectly. I'll order the carriage for you; and, do
you hear, I wish as you go that you would call
at my chaplain's at Lambeth, and tell him that
I am very angry with him for keeping so much
company. He had two tea-parties last week!
They played at cards, too! I will have none of
my chaplains play at cards, except on an emer-
gency, when I want to make up a table in my
own house. There's nothing about cards in the
Bible. And tell Augustus, that I wish he would
go to church more regularly. If church is good
enough for me, it is good enough for him !
Therenow you have your commission.-Do
you understand ?"
" I do, my lord, perfectly."
" Tell Augustus, that if he will marry imme-
diately, and go to church twice every Sunday,
and every Wednesday and Friday in Lent,- I'll
-I'll do something towards paying his debts."
Full of his high commission, the solemn Mr.

Graves hastened to the mansion of Fitzgeorge,
where, sending in his name, he soon had access
to the young gentleman's presence: for all who
had any favour to seek, or any anger to depre-
cate from Lord Fitzgeorge, paid studious court
to Mr. Graves. Indeed, it was supposed at the
time, and with much reason, that it was in this
kind of homage that Mr. Graves had his chief
delight and principal rewardfor he had very
low wages from Lord Fitzgeorge, and few, if
any perquisites.
Now Augustus Fitzgeorge had a very great
contempt for this Mr. Graves, and the man knew
that very well; but he was a crafty dissembler,
and put a good face on the matter, smiling and
bowing, as if he were all goodness and conde-
scension. The contrast, indeed, between Fitz-
george and Mr. Graves was very great. The one
was a man of business and the other was a man
of pleasure. The one was all companionship and
gaiety of heartthe other was as demure as a
frozen old maid; and even in his cupsfor he

209
could drink occasionally-he was mightily cau-
tious and circumspect. A man of ordinary craft
in the situation of Mr. Graves, naturally wishing
to retain his situation under the next heir, would
have paid, perhaps, a little more real and practi-
cal homage to Augustus; but the fact is, that
this Mr. Graves was as deep as the bottomless
pit. He knew that he was paying most effec-
tual court to the next successor by taking part
with the father against the son.
He knew the
temperament and disposition of Augustus better,
perhaps, than he knew it himself, and was well
aware that, however opposed the son was now
to his father, yet, if the son should become Lord
Fitzgeorge, he would be quite as well inclined
as his father to domineer over his vassals and de-
pendents ;-so Mr. Graves was virtually recom-
mending himself to Augustus by thwarting and
opposing him. The truly crafty man has neither
loves nor hatredsfor love and hatred are pas-
sions--and passion blinds a man to his own in-
terest. Therefore, if a man's object be wealth

or power, let him eschew all indulgence in any
of the passions of his nature: happy in such cir-
cumstances they who by nature are endowed
with no passionsbut wise are they who subdue
them or conceal them. In this happy state of
apathetic indifference was Mr. Graves; and he
was able to govern and direct others by means
of the absence of all passion; for he had just
such an advantage over men of passion, as a
sober man has over drunken men, or as a man
with one eye over those that are blind. More-
over, being the favourite servant of a powerful and
opulent nobleman, he had much power and in-
fluence; for all the world knows, that in a great
family a servant, who is a favourite, has greater
power than a child who is not a favourite.
Fitzgeorge was quite a gentleman, and Mr.
Graves, from living among people of high rank,
had acquired a pretty fair smattering of gentle-
manly manners. Now the very essence of gen-
tlemanly manners is appropriateness of de-
meanour, or adapting the manner of address to

211
the style and rank of those addressed. Most
reverently and respectfully did Mr. Graves ad-
dress himself to Augustus Fitzgeorge, as if mind-
ful of the high rank and expectations of the
individual before him; but with all this courtesy
of address, both he and Fitzgeorge knew, that
though the apparent humility was on one side,
the real humility was on the other.
" This is a troublesome affair, Mr. Graves,"
said Fitzgeorge; " my father, of course, knows
all the particulars."
" The world, upon these occasions," replied
Mr. Graves, "is sufficiently communicative.
The particulars of your present difficulties may
not be all known to my honoured master, the
Lord Fitzgeorge; for I felt it my duty to con-
ceal from his lordship whatever might be calcu-
lated to give him pain."
"Of course he knows," replied Fitzgeorge,
" that I have been outvoted at the Jockey Club,
and that I am surrounded with duns."
" All this his lordship knows perfectly well,

212
FITZGEORGE.
and feels deeply grieved at his knowledge of
the fact," said Mr. Graves.
" And is, no doubt, ready to give a helping
hand to get me out of the scrape: for which
purpose,
I suppose, you, Mr. Graves, will be
kind enough to use your influence, which all the
world knows to be very great."
" Whatever influence I may chance to have,
either from my poor abilities, or my faithful ser-
vices, I would use that influence solely for the
benefit of that great and good man whom I have
the honour to serve."
Very right, Mr. Graves, perfectly com-
mendable. But at the same time I think it
would be greatly to the advantage of Lord Fitz-
george, that his son's debts were paid."
" But where are the means to be procured?"
replied Mr. Graves.  Great as is the wealth
of my Lord Fitzgeorge, that wealth is not inex-
haustible. You will consider, also, that his
lordship has a large family to provide for. More-
over, with reverence be it spoken, you should

213
bly;
consider what a great number of poor relations
your honoured mother, the Lady Fitzgeorge, has
to provide for. Besides, the establishment which
Lord Fitzgeorge must of necessity keep up, is
not to be provided for without very considerable
expense."
" All this I know perfectly well, Mr. Graves ;
but permit me to say, that my father's tenants
do not pay half so much rent as they can afford
to pay: he might raise his rents very considera-
and as I am rather a favourite with many
of the tenants, I do not think that they would
grumble, if they knew that it was for my accom-
modation."
Mr. Graves smiled, or, more properly speak-
ing, he put his features into that forced and un-
usual position which he intended to represent a
smile, and said, "Ah, my honoured sir, you
know not the heart of a tenant, and you
know
not the look of a tenant when he is called upon
I am personally and practically
acquainted with these matters; I know the diffi-
for money.

214
FITZGEORGE.
culty which already exists of procuring the pre-
sent payments, and I tremble at the thought of
demanding more, even in cases of imperious ne-
cessity, where the claim is reasonable and just.
Now, though you may be a favourite with some
few of Lord Fitzgeorge's tenants," Mr. Graves
laid great stress on the words some few, "yet
you would cease to be a favourite with them if
they found you to be expensive to them. If the
rents are to be raised, all must be raised; the
rents of those with whom you may be a favour-
ite, and the rents also of those with whom you
may not be a favourite; for your friends and
admirers would be very reluctant to bear the
whole burden among themselves."
" My good Sir," replied Fitzgeorge banter-
ingly, " I care not who bears the burden so as
it is removed from my shoulders."
" Ah !" replied Mr. Graves, who affected to
understand the speech literally, " that is a bad
principle, a very bad principle; pardon me, but
it is not consistent with the high station which

215
you hold in society. Moreover, it is also incon-
sistent with the well known generosity of your
character. But there is one mode by which you
might not only get rid of your present difficul-
ties, but place yourself in a truly honourable
situation, thereby conciliating the esteem of the
wise and good."
Now it so happened that there was no set of
people on the face of the earth for whom Fitz-
george had so utter a distaste, as for those who
are called by themselves the wise and the good.
He considered them to be spoonies, flats and
hypocrites. He hated them for their mawkish
sentimentality and their moral conceit; and there-
fore, when Mr. Graves talked to him about
conciliating their esteem, he felt a kind of dis-
gust, and replied with some degree of pettish-
ness, "And pray, Mr. Graves, how am I ever to
conciliate the esteem of the wise and good ?"
" By entering into the holy state of matri-
mony," said Mr. Graves.
Fitzgeorge did sometimes swear, yet seldom,
## p. 216 (#228) ############################################
216
FITZGEORGE.
very seldom indeed in the presence of Mr.
Graves, who was a very solemn man, but on the
present occasion, and at the present recommen-
dation, he was so far transported as to violate
propriety and the ears of Mr. Graves, by swear-
ing a great many more oaths than it is now the
custom to print, even in the most eviscerated
form.
Matrimony! matrimony! Mr. Graves, do
you think I am mad? when plebeians cannot pay
their debts they go to prison; from that punish-
ment I am exempt, but a very pretty fool I
should be to expose and submit myself to a still
greater punishment than imprisonment. To
whom, I pray you, does my honoured father de-
sign to yoke me in matrimony ?"
" On that topic," replied Mr. Graves, "his
lordship has not condescended to enlighten me.
From what passed, indeed, I apprehend that the
choice is not yet made, but that his lordship
waits your consent before he will fix on the
happy choice."
## p. 217 (#229) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
217
" Then let him wait for ever," said Fitz-
george. " No, Mr. Graves : look you here.'
Then he pointed to the splendid furniture and
pictures with which the room in which they
were sitting was adorned. "Every article of use
and clecoration in this, and in every other room
in the house, shall come under the hammer of
the auctioneer, sooner than I will consent to the
arrangement which you propose. I will send
my horses and my carriages to fetch what they
will-I will break up my establishment, and
dismiss my servants; I will sell my wines and
my plate, every article of use or luxury shall go
to pay my debts, but I will not marry. You
may carry
this message,
if you will, to my ho-
noured father; and ask him if he wishes to see
the name of Fitzgeorge made humble in the
public eye."
" All this I can certainly do," said Mr.
Graves; "but I am decidedly of opinion that
it will be to no purpose.
Lord Fitzgeorge, as
you may know, is very firm of purpose, and is

not easily beaten out of his humour. If he make
up his mind to any given line of conduct, not
all the persuasions, threats, or arguments in the
world can induce him to change. But why
should you object to matrimony ? See you not
what great domestic bliss your honoured father
enjoys in that holy state ?"
" It is a bliss," replied Fitzgeorge, "that I
envy not."
" Furthermore," continued Mr. Graves," your
honoured father commissions me to say, that be
greatly disapproves your neglect of church."
" Possibly he may," replied Augustus, " he
has a remarkable fancy for church-going, in
which taste I by no means agree with him. The
whole result of your embassy to me, Mr. Graves,
amounts to nothing. I tell you plainly and
positively I will not comply with your con-
ditions; and if I cannot get rid of my incum-
brances in any other way, I will dispose of
every
article I possess in the world. My difficulties
are already known, my father's penuriousness is

not, or at least there is not a general conviction
of it. I will let the world see it, by reducing
myself down to a state of comparative indigence
and obscurity."
This was but a sudden freak which entered
the mind of Fitzgeorge while conversing with
Mr. Graves, and when that solemn man was
gone, the gay young spendthrift amused him-
self with meditating on his new scheme.-
" 'Twill do," said he to himself, " 'twill do. It
is a most admirable contrivance; I shall gain
great credit with the public; I shall be pitied,
and I shall be popular. It will be altogether a
new kind of life to me; and after all, however
divested I may be of my trappings and decora-
tions, plainly as I may live, plainly as I may
dress, plainly as I may be lodged, I shall not
and cannot descend into the plebeian caste. I
shall still be the Honourable Augustus Fitz-
george,
I shall still be honoured and respected
for
my rank and family. By this contrivance
I shall also mortify my father most effectually;

and when I find that he is mortified indeed,
and offers to make terms with me, I will take
care to make such terms as shall be really bene-
ficial to me. My father fancies that he has
power over me, I will let him see that I have
power over him."

CHAPTER XI.
RETRENCHMENT.
FITZGEORGE was thoroughly sulky, and he
determined to carry on the work of retrench-
ment with an unsparing hand. He assembled
about himself the auctioneers, and other con-
venient people, by whose. means money is
raised from the sale of the various playthings
with which great babies amuse themselves.
There is a pleasure to a child in the acqui-
sition of a new toy, and there, is perhaps,
nearly, if not quite as great a pleasure, in
the demolition of an old one. Fitzgeorge had
feasted and gratified his sight, in viewing and
## p. 222 (#234) ############################################
222
FITZGEORGE.
reviewing the splendid and decorative furni-
ture with which the ingenious and tasteful
upholsterers had adorned his mansion; he had
seen his house gradually grow in embellish-
ment, under the operation of his own inventive
skill and power of design, and now he had a
new, and quite unanticipated pleasure, in order-
ing and witnessing the demolition of this finery.
He could not but think with admiration of the
magnificent catalogue which the auctioneers
would have to put forth, of the invaluable valu-
ables which formed the sum total of his domes-
tic possessions.  He took account, also, of his
horses and carriages, and his rare and curious
wines, and thought that, peradventure, he might
make a good merchandize of them, selling them
for more than they cost, by virtue of his dis-
tinguished name and acknowledged taste. Not
very accurately knowing his father's character,
or appreciating his motives, he thought he
should be thus revenging himself, by exposing
his necessities to the world. Moreover, he had
## p. 223 (#235) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
223
some and no small degree of satisfaction, in the
thought of the world's sympathy with his priva-
tions, and of its commendations of his greatness
of mind. Alack, alack! the world does not
often think how much littleness there is at the
basis and foundation of that which it is pleased
to call greatness.
As in that part of his career which Fitzgeorge
had already rm, he had experienced many a
pain, and suffered many a mortification which
he had not anticipated-so now he was enjoying
a pleasure which he had not anticipated. It is
thus that reality loves to mock our fond imagi-
nations, giving us pleasure where we expected
pain, and pain where we had anticipated
pleasure.
My dear fellow," said Borrowman to Fitz-
george, one day during the progress and pa-
roxysm of this fit of retrenchment, "are you
mad? Are you going to relinquish all the plea-
sures and gaieties of life, and turn hermit?"
" No such thing, my dear Borrowman," re-

224
FITZGEORGE.
plied Fitzgeorge; "I am merely trying to
mortify the old gentleman, and to get myself
a fresh appetite for gaiety by a temporary absti-
nence."
" But you are not serious in your intention of
paying your debts; because, if you are guilty of
such an unconstitutional trick as that, your
friends must cut you."
" Have you never paid a debt in the whole
course of your life?" said Fitzgeorge.
" I must acknowledge that I did once; but
that was merely to make a man stare. I went
one evening to my banker's, purposely after
banking hours, for I knew that my account was
over-drawn, and seeing only one solitary clerk
there, I begged him to lend me ten guineas with
all the air of a man who is punctual in his pay-
ments; and whether it was from compassion,
or whether it was from a mere frolic, or from an
inability to deny me, I cannot tell, but he lent
me the money, and I paid him again at the time
appointed."
## p. 225 (#237) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
225
" And he stared with astonishment," said
Fitzgeorge.
Why, no," replied Borrowman; "he, was.
going to stare, but recollecting his manners, and
thinking that it might be rude to shew such
marked symptoms of wonderment, he put the
money into his pocket with an air of exquisite
indifference, just as if he had expected to re-,
ceive it.But how long, in the name of wonder,
do you design to carry on this farce ?"
" Till I feel tired of the change. There is
nothing like a little variety to give a zest to
life."
" So I suppose the next time you go to make
papa a visit, you will go in a hackney coach."
Ay, any thing that will mortify the old boy."
"But let me give you a word of advice.
Mortify the old gentleman as much as you
please; sting him, gall him, quiz him, bother
him, but do not let the world see that you study
to annoy him; rather let it appear that he per-
secutes you, but that you bear it all with most

0
exemplary patience, and that you are a most
dutiful son.
That is the true way to obtain
public sympathy."
" Thank you for your advice, which, by the
way," said Fitzgeorge, "is rather superfluous,
for it is the precise line of conduct which I hail
laid down for myself. You may assure your-
self, Borrowman, that I am by no means un-
aware of the value of a good name, just at this
time, among my father's tenants. I shall ex-
hibit myself to them as a marvellously pretty
piece of injured innocence; and while I profess
myself a most dutiful son, I shall most effectu-
ally provoke the public feeling against my ho-
noured father. He may thank himself for it all,
whatever craft and duplicity I have learnt, I
have learnt from him. It is really amusing to
see how he, and that demure varlet, Graves,
play off their stratagems one against the other.
Graves fancies that he is trusted in every thing,
but the truth is, he is trusted in nothing. He
is an useful instrument; he manages the estate

FITZGEORGE.
227
so as to make it productive, and he bears all
the odium of those measures, which he fancies
are his own, but which, in reality, are my fa-.
ther's. I am really amused to see a solemn ass,
who thinks himself prodigiously wise, thus used
as a mere cat's-paw and scape-goat. My worthy
lady mother, too, finds him a most serviceable
creature in helping her poor relations. My only
fear, indeed, is that they will all three play such
tricks with the estate, that when it comes into
my possession it will be scarcely worth having."
" Never fear that," exclaimed Borrowman,
" it is a capital estate, and will bear a great deal
of improvement yet. But that fellow Graves is
a piece of such exquisite formality and old maid-
ishness, that he will never hear a word of im-
provement or alteration. The land is capital,
and the tenants industrious, substantial, and re-
sponsible men; they may grumble now and
then, and talk of throwing up their farms, but
they know better; they know when they are
well off, and I know when they will be better
off."
## p. 228 (#240) ############################################
228
FITZGEORGE.
"Ay, Borrowman," replied Fitzgeorge, "I
think that, with the assistance of your advice,
and that of our friend Leppard, we might make
some considerable improvements in the state of
things in general. But at present we must only
think of retrenchment."
"But," continued Borrowman, "you adver-
tise your wines; do you intend to empty your
cellars without the assistance of your friends ?"
"We shall fill them again, and perhaps we
may find it expedient to retain a little, just a
little. But the fact is, that it is desirable to
make our retrenchments as ostentatious as pos-
sible. We must appear to the world to wear
sackcloth and ashes."
" Capital-you will be an object of universal
pity and universal praise. Fathers will talk
about you, and point you out as an example to
their
sons ;
creditors will extol you as the prince
of debtors, and the very model of high-minded
integrity. You will even impose upon your fa-
ther."
## p. 229 (#241) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.

" Not quite," replied Fitzgeorge, "he has
known me from my childhood; and he knows
that it is no part of my system or habit to ex-
pose myself wilfully and voluntarily to any real
mortification or painful self-denial."
So the work of dismantling and retrenchment
went on most swimmingly. The Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge was no more the gay, the
extravagant, the fashionable ; but he had re-
duced his establishment to a mere nothing; he
was as plain and economical in his dress and in
his table as any of his father's agricultural
tenants. Newmarket and Ascot heard nothing
of his stud, the mansion which had been the
life and bustle of the neighbourhood in which
it stood, was now as silent as a convent and
dark as a sepulchre. He occupied only one or
two small rooms, leaving the others deprived
of their furniture, and denied even the embel-
lishment of daylight. His friends expostulated
with him, his enemies taunted him, the world
talked about him. Strange to say, notwith-

230
FITZG EORGE.
standing his decided and unbounded taste for
splendour and ostentation, he did not find this
seclusion and retirement at all wearisome or
annoying. He seemed rather to imagine that
it opened to him a new chapter in the volume
of human life. In many respects it opened to
him new and hitherto unexperienced scenes.
Still he pursued the course of pleasure, for the
whole business of his life was pleasure. When
he was not occupied in life's gaieties, or shining
in its splendours, he was still devoted to his pur-
suits of sensuality.
In this interval of privacy and apparent self-
denial there was good opportunity for the
activity of the imagination in devising new forms
of luxury and new styles of decoration. An
empty house gave room enough for the fancy
to run riot and to create for its own amusement
images of future splendour. The accuracy of
mercantile calculation was no part of the system
or practice of Fitzgeorge. His preceptors had
not failed indeed to instruct him in the use and

FITZGEORGE.
231
power of figures, but he knew nothing of their
practical application. Figures were to him
pure
abstractions, and he regarded them by no means
in connection with pounds, shillings, and pence.
Involved in debt to nearly ten times the amount
of his annual income, he had a sort of vague
notion that a few months' abstinence from his
usual extravagances would be sufficient to get
rid of his incumbrances, or so to remove the im-
mediate pressure and annoyance of them that
he might presently return again to his old habits
and shine as brightly and brilliantly as ever.
His principal hope, however, was that he might
shame his father into some concession. In this
hope he was disappointed, nor did the formation
and encouragement manifest any great degree
of practical wisdom. It might have been clear
enough to him by this time that Lord Fitzgeorge
was not easily to be moved from his purposes,
and that the more absurd those purposes were
the more pertinaciously he was likely to adhere
to them. Opposition always had the effect of

fixing him more decidedly and obstinately on
what he meditated and desired. Moreover, it
generally happens that persons in the highest
as well as people in the lowest conditions of
society are equally inaccessible by shame. In
the lowest grades there is nothing to lose by
way of reputation, and in the highest, though
there may be something to gain, yet there are
always about them those who pay precisely the
same homage to the individual, whatever be the
moral and intellectual character; nothing is
heard but the language of compliment and the
music of a gentle flattery. There was no one
about Lord Fitzgeorge who dared to tell him
that his conduct towards his son
temptible and mean, and that the shallowest
observers of human life could easily see through
the thin veil of hypocrisy, with which he
attempted to conceal and disguise it. There
was no one who dared say to him that by this
persecution he did not shew so manifestly his
hatred of vice as his mean malignity against his
was con-

233
own son.
There was no one who dared to tell
him that he was corroborating, and that inten-
tionally, the reckless habits of the young spend-
thrift. There was no one who dared to tell him
that when this fit of retrenchment should be
over, the fever of extravagance would break
forth again with redoubled violence and a force
of greater distructiveness.
When Mr. Graves, who was known, or per-
haps, to speak more accurately, was supposed
to have great influence over Lord Fitzgeorge,
was persuaded to use his power to induce Lord
Fitzgeorge to do something for the relief of his
son's embarrassments, the unnatural parent
affected to be so considerate of his tenants,
that he would not raise the rents for the sup-
port, as he called it, of the young man's extra-
vagance. Yet, at the same time, he was col-
lecting money from his tenants to send to his
wife's poor relations, and that not so much to
relieve their actual poverty, which no one would
have blamed him for, as to put them into a

FITZGEORGE.
sphere of life far above anything to which they
had been accustomed, or any of their ancestors
before them. The relations of Lady Fitzgeorge
were, indeed, gentlefolks by birth and educa
tion; they had estates, though very small ones,
and the very circumstance which had induced
Lord Fitzgeorge's mother to select him a wife
amongst the little gentry, was, that the young
woman might be subservient, and feel herself
dependant. It was little thought, though it
might have been expected, that she would have
quartered her poor relations on 'Lord Fitz-
george's tenants; so, however, she did, and they
had the vanity to think, that they had a right
to cut as great a figure in the world almost
as Lord Fitzgeorge himself. So while his lord-
ship was feeding, clothing and decorating these
gentry, his own son his eldest son and heir
was left to be surrounded with duns, and an-
noyed by his embarrassed circumstances.
Now

235
duced, would willingly, of their own accord,
have come forward to assist him, but they knew
that Lord Fitzgeorge would not be pleased that
they should, therefore they abstained. In no-
thing, perhaps, did Lord Fitzgeorge more shew
his weakness, than by making among his friends
a frequent boast of his duplicity. He affected
to be exceedingly partial to artifice, and strata-
gem, but then he was weak enough to talk
about it, and he managed it so clumsily, that
the merest child could discover it. In truth, he
deceived nobody but himself, and he deceived
himself so completely, as to persuade himself
that he was a perfect master of artifice, when
artifice was completely the master of him.
Men of the profoundest duplicity never talk of
artifice.
It is not to be supposed that an individual,
so entirely and systematically devoted to indul-
gence as Augustus Fitzgeorge, should, even in
his temporary retirement from the public eye,
cease from the pursuit to which his whole life

there wanting those who carried to the pious
Lord Fitzgeorge, and to the fastidious and su-
peraccurate Lady Fitzgeorge, a full account of
the proceedings of their promising son. And
the pious Lord Fitzgeorge said his prayers very
loudly twice every Sunday in his parish church,
knowing at the very time, that he was lifting
up his eyes so piously as to fascinate the parish
clerk, that he was suffering his son to run into
all manner of excesses, without contriving,
wishing, or desiring, to extricate him from his
morally perilous condition. The virtuous Lady
Fitzgeorge also heard, with great indifference,
of her sons irregularities, so long as she had
money to send to her poor relations, and so
long as she could have her person decorated
with diamonds, and her cabinets filled with
curiosities.

In the mean time, the poor forsaken and for-
lorn Juliet was living in the solitude of a miser-
able lodging, which had once been decorated
with many ornaments, and gladdened by the
presencethe graceful presence of her beloved
and gentle Fitzgeorge. By degrees these orna-
ments vanishedone after another they found
their way into shop-windows again, tempting
once more the eye of thoughtless extravagance,
and inviting simple people to part with their
pence. Fitzgeorge had now deserted, forsaken,
neglected her; poor Juliet, however, was not
merely a sacrifice to retrenchment, but she was
forsaken, because she had ceased to please, by
attempting to please too much. Her love had
been too great to meet return. She had the mor-
tification of knowing that another had taken her
place; that another was living in comparative
luxury and gaiety at the expense of Fitzgeorge,
who had once been hers-and only hers. Still
she possessed the bond which Fitzgeorge had
given her: it was a painful memorandum of the

humiliation, and it is more than I can bear
Poor dear Fitzgeorge! Merciless creditors sur-
round him! and merciless creditors surround me
too! I can sympathise with him!"
But Juliet knew that her creditors were not
to be satisfied with sentimentality, or to be
blown away with sighs, or washed away with
tears. Retrenchment was a matter of more
seriousness to Juliet than it was to Fitzgeorge.
She could not make a jest of her obscurity, or
enjoy the joke of riding in a hackney coach in-
stead of a gilded chariot. She had no brilliant
expectations and reversions, whereby creditors
may be taught respectfulness, even in the midst
of their importunities. With her destitution
was not transient, but permanent. She could
not return to the profession, which for the sake
of Fitzgeorge she had left, nor was there any
other to which the could return. By her own
weakness and by the wickedness of Fitzgeorge,

she suffered a threefold destitution. She had
been first deprived of a profession by ineans of
which she might have subsisted ! she was in the
next place so initiated in luxury, and so sur-
rounded with elegancies and indulgence, that
her wants were increased, and many things
became necessaries, which once had been su-
perfluities; and lastly, she was rendered totally
unable to return again to that line of life from
whence she had been taken. Then did she lament
her folly; but even then she did not reproach
Fitzgeorge.
Influenced more by a foolish and romantic
fondness than by any higher sentiment of gene-
rosity, she abstained long from urging her claim
upon the bond. For the supply of her daily
expenses,
which had been reduced to the nar-
rowest possible compass, she had recourse to the
disposing of the various pretty trinkets and toys
which in the days of his fondness her thought-
less lover had lavished upon her. But these
things could not last for ever, nor could they

last long; there is a great difference too between
the money which toys cost, and the money
which toys will fetch for those who can no lon-
ger afford to keep them. Moreover, there is a
great deal of difference between the retrench-
ment that cuts down superfluities merely, and
that which encroaches upon the necessaries of
life. The one is seen and the other is felt.
The time came at length when, in spite of all
her magnanimous and sentimental resolves,
Juliet was driven to have recourse to her bond.
She looked at it, and wept over it, and sighed
over it. It was the only memorial that was
now left of her beloved Fitzgeorge, and very
strongly did she suspect that it was as worthless
and valueless as he that had given it. It had
to the eye all the appearance of a valuable and
veritable document; but when presented to one
who had no means of redeeming it, it became
a mere mockery. To the beloved, but no longer
loving giver of the bond, Juliet at last was in-
duced to write a long and sentimental letter,
VOL. I.

stating her great necessities, and alluding to the
bond in terms as delicate and respectful as pos-
sible. But neither the English language, nor
any other language on the face of the earth has
terms sufficiently delicate wherewith money may
be demanded of one that has not the means of
paying it. Her letter remained unanswered.
Another and another was written; an answer was
at length extorted, and an interview was at last
appointed.
How gaily then did beat and bound the heart
of the simple Juliet! Then did she begin to
flatter herself that the roving heart was coming
back to her, that the buried love was coming
to life again, and that Fitzgeorge would once
more be hers. She neither knew him nor knew
herself. She now took more pains, if possible,
than ever with the duties of the toilet, and
she seemed to imagine that she looked as beau-
tiful and as interesting as ever.
She could see
no difference, except it were for the better,
between her present appearance and that which

243
first had captivated Fitzgeorge; but there was
one charm which she had possessed then, which
she did not now, which no art could give and
without which the heart of Fitzgeorge was ab-
solutely inaccessible, that charm was novelty.
Not being tired of her own pretty face she
thought that Fitzgeorge could not be tired of it,
and fondly imagined that the more she could
make herself look like what she had been, the
more likely she should be to regain the lost
affections of her former lover. She was wrong,
miserably wrong. Spill water on the sand and
gather it up again, destroy life and restore it,
persuade yesterday to give back its departed
hours, and make that which has been not to
have been; then may a man be persuaded to
love a second time her whom he hath once ceased
to love. Love may exist for ever, but it can
only exist once. This is the only true theory
of the unity of love. A man may love more
than once, but he cannot love the same person

more than once. Seldom does he attempt it,
and if he does he is sure to fail.
A politer man than Augustus Fitzgeorge never
lived,his formality was so exquisitely graceful,
that it might pass for sincerity. How kindly did
he receive the forlorn and suppliant Juliet! No
haughtiness, no coldness, no repulsive frozen
look or embarrassed shyness, that looks as if it
wished to forget what it could not forget; but
all was ease and gracefulness, and pleasant gen-
tleness of manner, as though there had never
been the slightest alienation. Vulgar men, un-
der such circumstances, must have been rude or
sheepish, pained themselves, and giving pain to
others. It was not so with Fitzgeorge. Juliet,
whose heart fluttered and trembled with agita-
tion before she was ushered into his presence,
felt herself at once at ease; she forgot his de-
srtion, and forgave his inconstancy. Nothing
of the past was remembered, save that which it
was pleasant to think of. The countenance of

the lady brightened up at this reception, and she
felt as though all that had passed since last she
saw Fitzgeorge was merely an unpleasant dream
from which she was now waking to a pleasant
reality.
Surely. I have had enemies," said Juliet,
" who have endeavoured to injure me in the es-
teem of my best, my dearest, my only friend!"
" It is the invariable lot of real worth," replied
Fitzgeorge, " to be exposed to the shafts of ca-
lumny."
" Yes," answered Juliet, "and if the good
and generous Fitzgeorge himself cannot escape
the tongue of the calumniator, how can I expect
or hope exemption from it?"
" Your only consolation and defence against
it," said Fitzgeorge, "must be the consciousness
of your integrity, a consolation which will never
fail
you or forsake you."

interesting, but the fascinating and interesting
looks of Fitzgeorge would not pay Juliet's debts,

her door. The bond had not been alluded to in
the interview, and though Juliet had named it.
in her letters, there was a want of courage to
speak of it in his presence. Oh the generosity,
the delicacy, the noblemindedness of the good
Fitzgeorge! He spared the trembling and agi-
tated Juliet the pain of introducing the topic,
by alluding to it himself in terms so generous,
and with such an exquisite propriety, that she
was ready to cancel the obligation at once, and
let her creditors wait till they were tired.
Oh name it not !" she exclaimed with a
passionate earnestness, "I grieve for the sad
necessity that exists for any allusion to it.
Between us there should be no other bonds than
those of generous sentiment."
Fitzgeorge wished that there were no others,
for those he could very easily dispense with.
" Dearest Juliet," said he, in a tone and with a
look worth at least half the money, "the bond
exists--given by me freely, knowingly, and it
must be paid."

" Must be paid !" replied Juliet, " did I say
must?'"
not so.
"No, my beloved, you were too good and
generous to say it," answered Fitzgeorge, " but
I say it must and shall. If every other obligation
is neglected, and all my other creditors should
be deprived of their claims, my Juliet shall not
be wronged of a single farthing. The bond is
yours, and shall be paid."
Oh, no, no," said Juliet, affectedly, " say
It shall not, it must not. I know the
generosity of Fitzgeorge's heart."
" Dearest Juliet," said Fitzgeorge again, in a
tone which was well worth the other half of
the bond," say no more; but it shall be paid
and that, if possible, on this very instant."
Softening down his tone, from the high roman.
tic to the mild and gentle pathetic, he continued,
"Ah, my beloved friend, the world has used
me harshly, ungenerously, unjustly! Common,
vulgar minds cannot enter into the feelings of
those who are born in life's higher spheres.

aitely more, my beloved friend."
" To think, also, of the littleness of those
tradespeople," said Fitzgeorge, "they are the
very pest of society. They interfere with, and
embitter all the sweets and comforts of life.
They, forsooth, must be paid, little thinking at

the same time, how inconvenient, and some-
times how impossible it is to pay them."
"Base fellows!" replied Juliet. "I know it;
yes, my Fitzgeorge, I know how absurdly im-
portunate they are. Oh, they have not the
slightest notion of true generosity of soul, or
high liberality of feeling."
" Things would go on pleasantly enough,"
said Fitzgeorge, " if it were not for them ; but
they mar everything that is beautiful, and in-
terfere with all the enjoyments of life. They
* deserve to suffer for their very insolence and
impertinence."
" Nothing is too bad for them," replied
Juliet, moved to this cruelty of expression more,
perhaps, by her sympathy with Fitzgeorge, than
by the actual, though numerous annoyances
which she herself had suffered, and was likely
to suffer from them.
" But my Juliet's bond shall be paid," said
Fitzgeorge; "yes, if the work of dismantling
proceed yet farther, and if I be reduced to a

of my vulgar creditors; yes, I will even brave
the anger of my unnatural father, and will insist
upon it that he shall
pay
the bond. Let me en-
dure what I may of parental anger, or personal
privation, my Juliet's bond shall be paid."
This was said with such an amazng emphasis,
and such a tone of deep feeling and earnestness,
that Juliet was overwhelmed and lost in asto-
nishment at his loftiness of thought and subli-
mity of sentiment. She sat for a while in a
maze of wonderment and stupor, scarcely know-
ing what to think, or whether to think at all.
The unparalleled generosity of this best of men,
60 superior to all the little meannesses of dirty
tradespeople, quite captivated her heart afresh.
-Ten thousand conflicting thoughts rushed
through her agitated soul. Love, pity, joy,
gratitude, sorrow, grief, and ecstacy of spirit, all
blended together, threw her into an indescribable
agitation, and rising from her seat, she took the
bond from her pocket-book, and then directing

to Fitzgeorge a look as lovely as any Juliet ever
gave to any Romeo, and modulating her voice
into a most musical key, she exclaimed, " Ne-
ver ?" Then she tore the bond in half. " Never !"
Then she tore it into four pieces. " Never!"-
Then she tore it into eight. "Never-never-
never-never !" So she went on, tearing the
bond into pieces smaller and smaller, till at
length it was reduced to mince-meat. Then she
sat down, exhausted with fatigue, and over-
whelmed with admiration of her own generosity
and elevation of sentiment.
Fitzgeorge himself was so taken by surprise,
that he was absolutely thunderstruck, and had
not presence of mind sufficient to prevent the
catastrophe. So there the bond lay on the floor,
all in very little pieces-so little, that it would
have been impossible to put it together again.
" What have you done ?" exclaimed Fitz-
george.
" An act of justice !" she replied.
" An act of generosity !" he responded.
## p. 252 (#264) ############################################
252
FITZGEORGE.
"Oh, Juliet! This is too much! This must not
be allowed or thought of. I must replace that
bond, which you have, in the madness of your
generosity, so thoughtlessly destroyed."
Nay, most excellent of men !" replied Juliet,
" say not thoughtlessly but considerately ; it
was from an impulse of feelingbut it was an
act of the judgement."
Then she rose to depart; and Fitzgeorge said,
" But when, my beloved, when shall we meet
again ?"
" I am your slave," said Juliet. And so they
parted. Juliet returned to her apartments full
of admiration of her beloved Fitzgeorge, and
prepared to treat the importunities of her cre-
ditors with the contempt which they deserved.
Fitzgeorge that day sat gaily down to dinner
with Fitzmaurice and Isabella, and the party
laughed heartily at the amusing narrative which
Fitzgeorge gave of his interview with the senti-
mental Juliet.

CHAPTER XII.
MORE
EXTRAVAGANCE.
When he who has been long accustomed to a
well-spread table, with all its suitable appoint-
ments and becoming elegancies, is by any acci-
dent of situation, as a day's sport in hunting or
shooting, drawn far away from home, and is
driven, by the sharp necessity of a pressing hun-
ger, to sit down at the humble table of a cot-
tager, he feels so great a relish in the refresh-
ment, together with an amusement in the va-
riety, that he fancies he could always live thus;
but soon he grows tired of the change, and sighs
for his ordinary mode of satisfying his daily

hunger. So did the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge
grow soon tired of that obscurity which had at
the first taste so much pleased and amused him.
He soon began to find that the element of his
life and being was in the eye of society, and in
the admiration of a gaping world. Having by
some contrivance, he scarcely knew what, ma-
naged to get rid of some few of his incum-
brances, and having, by his abstinence from his
former gaieties gained a mighty share of ad-
miration and applause, he now thought of look-
ing like himself again, and keeping up the dig-
mity of his rank which had so long been in
abeyance.
All the various artisans were again set to
work. The embellishments and furniture of the
mansion in town were restored in greater splen-
dour than before. Sounds of festivity were
heard again; friends came again in copious
abundance; congratulations and applause were
heard from many tongues; and Fitzgeorge now
resolved that he would enjoy life to his heart's

FITZGEORGE.
255
content. Again his gilded carriages graced the
streets, and again the life and bustle of his re-
furnished mansion gave animation to the neigh-
bourhood. There is, perhaps, no object in na-
ture so truly deplorable as a magnificent, de-
serted mansion; 'midst woods and wilds, and
rocky mountains, no one looks for the human
face divine, or listens for the busy hum of men;
solitude is the fit society of the desert; even in
the massy ruins of buildings and cities of a by-
gone age, when the ivy has climbed the walls,
and the unsociable bird of twilight has made its
nest in the not yet crumbled pinnacles, there is
something of a poetic beauty, and the imagina-
tion loves to have room for the creation of its
own fanciesthe human face is not missed, be-
cause not looked for amidst those picturesque
ruins, which are as the last long shadows of a
departed generation: but the empty mansion in
a living city, the glazed but eyeless windows,
the untrodden steps, the cold, smokeless chim-
neys, the unfurnished halls, the tongueless bells,

FITZGEORGE.
and the silent knocker, are mournful, melancholy
--not like the calm sublimity of death, but like
the gaping agony of dying. From this state of
sad paralysis the mansion of Fitzgeorge revived.
Even his creditors, his unpaid creditors, were
not sorry to see the rekindling of that light
which had been the joy and pride of the neigh-
bourhood. And now his father, Lord Fitz-
george, was in hopes that he might gain two ad-
vantages over the young man, that by increasing
difficulties and new expenses, and a stronger
taste for extravagance, he might be compelled,
for his relief and extrication, to have recourse to
matrimony, and to the adoption of his father's
line of politics. But Augustus inherited so much
of the paternal temperament as to possess a
strong feeling of obstinacy. To the bondage of
matrimony he had a decided objection; but to
the person whom his father might select he had
a still stronger objection: he knew not exactly
who it might be, but he could partly guess, and
the conjecture pleased him not.
## p. 257 (#269) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
257
As the father had anticipated, so it was.
This second fit of extravagance exceeded the
first. Refinement grew upon refinement, and
one folly was the parent of a dozen more.
Professor Malthus may be greatly alarmed at
the carelessness of Providence, which, not hav-
ing consulted him at the creation of the world,
has most unwisely allowed the human race to
increase in a geometrical ratio ; but the follies
of fashion and extravagance increase in a ratio
still more alarming, and more irrational. It
was the ambition of Fitzgeorge to be the first in
the walks of fashion, refinement, elegance and
superfineness. He aimed to set, not to follow
the fashion ; and he undoubtedly had a good eye
for patterns, forms and colours. Whatever new
modes of dress or furniture he might devise,
they were sure to meet with the approbation of
men of taste; and so fertile was his imagina-
tion, that there was no need of any auxiliaries, ,
nor any room for the intrusion of rivals. He
stood unrivalled, at the summit of his profession,
## p. 258 (#270) ############################################
258
FITZGEORGE.
for profession certainly it was, though not so
classed or arranged, according to the ordinary
acceptation of the term profession. A setter of
fashions was clearly the profession of Fitz-
george, for it was his only occupation, his con,
stant study, his greatest ambition. He aspired
not to shine in the senate, or in the field; he
gave not up his days or nights to the study of
philosophy, or the cultivation of letters, and for
one hour that he spent with any other book, he
spent five with the pattern book.
It is no
doubt a very interesting and curious study, to
men who have minds capable of that high reach
and deep profundity, to ascertain at each chang-
ing season of the ever-various year, what colours
best become the infinite variety of the human
complexion and countenance, modified as they
incessantly are, by a changing climate, and by
the unforeseen fluctuation of interests and poli-
tical movements. The people of Asia, who live
beneath a cloudless sky and an unrelenting, un-
resisted despotism, still keep the monotony of

their garb and manners, wearing the same dress
at the present day, and keeping the same cus-
toms to the present hour, as were worn and kept
by the father of the faithful. It is not so with
European nations, especially the English ;-
they are constantly changing the shape and co-
lour of their attire, and are progressing, in an
infinite course, towards unattainable perfection
Seeing this peculiarity, and observing its foun-
dation in a deep and curious principle, Fitz-
george bent all the powers of his mighty mind
to modify and regulate these changes. While
common minds, and the thoughtless mass of
mankind carelessly, clumsily, and impatiently
lend their bodies for a few minutes to the tailor's
measures, and thus encourage or tolerate the
production of ill-formed habiliments, it was the
glory of Fitzgeorge to think, that whatever was
worth doing at all was worth doing well. He
received not his tailor impatiently, nor dismissed
him hastily, and while he was employed in the
work of admeasurement, and in consultation and

investigation of shape and colour, his mind was
not idly wandering away after matters of minor
importance, but he bent his whole powers to
the subject, and gave it the deepest and closest
attention. Blue, black, brown, green, pink,
are words by which the indiscriminating many
express the diversity of colour, but the eye of
Fitzgeorge was far more recondite. Amidst the
primary colours he had discernment to distin-
guish an infinite variety of shades, and to ascer-
tain which was the most beautiful and most ap-
propriate; and of the many artizans who were
at various times employed to embody the crea-
tions of his brilliant imagination, not one has
been found who ever detected the slightest in-
accuracy in Fitzgeorge's taste. Whatever co-
lour, or whatever shade and combination of co-
lour he might fix on as the most beautiful for the
time being, was sure to be the very perfection
of beauty. He was

261
Nor indeed is it much to be wondered at that
he should have been always so superbly success-
ful in his choice of cut and colour, for though
much might, and no doubt did, depend upon an
innate genius, and on mental powers peculiarly
adapted to such subjects, yet much was also the
result of great and continued application to the
topic. He not only brought talent, but he gave
time and diligence to the investigation. It is too
much the practice and habit of genius to depend
mainly on its inherent powers, and to trust to
almost extemporaneous efforts, but this was not
a failing of which Fitzgeorge was guilty, although
a genius of the first order in dress and decora-
tion. On the contrary, he disdained not to spend
hour after hour in close and closetted consulta-
tion with his tailors, watching, peradventure, the
effect of various lights on various shades of
colour as the day advanced or receded: for a
colour that is beautiful at ten o'clock may alter
its aspect beneath a meridian sun, and a dress
that is graceful at two may be seen under ano-

ther aspect at five or six. Moreover, he had the
judgment to consider, that by many superficial
persons novelty itself may be taken for elegance,
and that even more profound observers may be
deceived by the first contemplation of a new
form or colour; therefore he thought it neces-
sary, previous to the publication of any new
form of dress, to dwell attentively on the exa-
mination and inspection of it; for it would have
been a source of much regret, and of serious
remorse, if he had by any haste or inconside-
rateness published a coat which would not bear
the test of the nicest examination. When Fitz-
george, therefore, did exhibit himself, he was
properly prepared for the exhibition, and by the
superb arrangements of his toilet paid all proper
homage and respect to the admiring public ;
and when the public saw him decorated with all
that can contribute to the rightly ornamenting
of the human frame, they saw the result of many
hours' labour and much serious thought.
Happy is it for those who by their exalted

station and attractive manners are able to select
their associates and companions from every pos-
sible variety of human character and condition.
So it was with Fitzgeorge ; he was not only a
gentleman by birth, but a gentleman by man-
ners, mind, feeling, habit, taste, principle, con-
stitution, everythinghe was a most complete
and perfect gentleman, an unrivalled gentleman,
a gentleman in every point of view, and in every
particular which constitutes that undefinable yet
obvious being called gentleman. It is true that
he did not pay his creditors, because he could
not, but still he was a gentlemen; it is true that
he had sacrificed poor simple Juliet's peace of
mind, profession, reputation, such as it was, to
his own transient passion, but still he was a
gentleman; it is true that he cared for no one
but himself, and followed his own caprices and
humours, regardless of the feelings of others,
but still he was a gentleman. And when we
have said that a man is a gentleman, we forget
or heed not any minor considerations. There

may be in a man's character and conduct folly,
wickedness, mischief, indolence, arrogance, dis-
honesty, brutality, and a thousand other modi-
fications of ungoverned passion; but still, if he
be a gentleman, we must look up to him with
admiration and respect, and must take it for
granted that he must be infinitely more proud
of being a gentleman than ashamed of any of
the minor blots and blemishes in his character.
The brightness and brilliancy of the gentlemanly.
character eclipses and conceals all defects.
Fitzgeorge then was a gentleman, and of
course all who attempted to be or thought then-
selves to be gentlemen, admired in him that
which they admired in themselves. Gentlemen,
who had made it the whole study of their little
lives to learn how to dress and move the body,
to regulate the inflexion of the spine, to manage
the movements of the toes and fingers and knees
and shoulders, to arrange the important simper,
and to direct the magnificent sneer; these gen-
tlemen dressed themselves at the model of Fitz-

george as at a mirror, and not more perfectly
could the African ape imitate with edifying gra-
vity the movements of a human being than did
these creatures imitate all that Fitzgeorge did,
said, looked, dressed, and perhaps thought.
Whenever, therefore, he appeared in Hyde Park
to take what is in London called and seriously
thought to be the air, but which in reality is the
refuse gas of a million lungs and the refuse
smoke of a million chimneys, gentlemen were
to be seen around him in rich abundance pester-
ing him with their multitudinous gazings, and
persecuting him with the homage of bows which
it was a task and a pleasure to returna task
because there was so much of it to be done, and
a pleasure because he could do it so well. He
never, perhaps, heard any one say, but he knew
that every body did say, "How graceful is the
bow of Augustus Fitzgeorge !" In that know-
ledge of course he was happy.
Having the power, as has been said above, to
select whom he would for his acquaintanceship,

he made, of course, that selection according to
his own accurate and exuberant taste. The
friends of Fitzgeorge were of various qualities
and of wide diversity of character, but they were
all chosen for the sake of some coincidence with
his own mind and feelings. If it may be per-
mitted in a slight and sketchy narrative like the
present, to aim at any speculations at all ap-
proaching the philosophic or analytical, we
might say, that as every human being has a
character formed from the combination of various
elements, as those elements are in every charac-
ter variously combined, and as in no two cha-
racters-perhaps is there a decided similarity of
combination, no two individuals can be decided
and exclusive associates by virtue of a perfect
similarity of mind and a complete sympathy of
sentiment, but that association in friendship or
acquaintanceship results from a similarity and
coincidence in certain points. So we see in the
world there are various societies formed in which
the whole of the associates are met and do keep:

together on only one point. So natural history
or philosophy may unite men who are not by
any means united on other matters; so men may
coincide in politics who agree not on any other
topic. This will account for the variety in the
character of the associates of Fitzgeorge, and an
examination of the durability or otherwise of his
friendships, will show on what ground there was
sympathy and wherein the attraction consisted.
For thoughtless and unobservant people will
often say of such an one that he deserts his
friend, that he changes his mind, that he is
fickle, false, and capricious; let us vindicate
Fitzgeorge from that reproach, should it be
found in the course of this little history that he
should fall away from any of those whom once
he may have professed to admire, esteem, or
befriend.
Our vindication may as well be made at this
period of the narrative, in which we are speaking
of Fitzgeorge's emerging from temporary obscu,
rity into the light of apparent prosperity and

renewed extravagance, for it is in these
parox-
ysms of magnificence and splendour that men
have most friends. Whatever change there may
be seen in the conduct or feelings of Fitzgeorge
towards those called his friends, that change is
more apparent than real, or the change is
founded on the same principle as that on which
the friendship was founded ; and surely wisdom
itself cannot demand or expect of the human
character greater consistency than this, that a
man's reason for ceasing his friendships should
be quite as good as his reasons for commencing
them. Thus with respect to Leppard, a man
differing in many points of view from Fitzgeorge,
and from most of Fitzgeorge's friends, it might
be said or thought that the integrity of his mind,
the generosity of his heart, the stores of his
knowledge, the kindness of his feelings never
ceased, never diminished, never changed-per-
haps not; but it was not on account of these
things that Fitzgeorge sought his acquaintance,
or honoured him with his friendship; Fitzgeorge

269
was not attracted to Leppard by his integrity,
by his generosity, by his knowledge, or by his
benevolence, but by the sympathy of Whig poli-
tics; the moment, therefore, that sympathy
ceased, that very moment Fitzgeorge cared not
a straw for any of the mental and imtellectual
qualities which once perhaps he might have
professed to admire. Fitzgeorge loved wit, and
therefore he was attracted to Borrowman and
rejoiced in his friendship. Fitzgeorge had need
of some obedient, thick and thin counsellor and
negociator, who would serve him with a steady
and reckless zeal, who would go any where, say
any thing, and do every thing to serve him, there-
fore he loved Borrowman; and he confided in
him and spoke familiarly to him, and called
him his best friend, and perhaps for a while
actually thought him so. Fitzgeorge also loved
the symposium, the heartiness of a jolly party,
the sparkling wit that oozes from the sparkling
wine, the light of fun which gleams on the margin
of the mantling cup, the humour that springs from

the social glass, and the adulatory incense
which they who drink administer to him who
gives them drink. But when the taste changed,
when Borrowman's wit grew dim, or Fitzgeorge's
apprehension of it grew dull;when by change
of circumstances there was no longer need of the
convenient aid of a spaniel friend ;when Fitz-
george found it convenient to renounce his
Whiggery, and when the humour of Borrowman
cease to stimulate, and his services were no
longer needed, he was dismissed, forgotten, for-
saken, and neglected. Fitzgeorge might have
admired the virtues of Leppard's character and
the keen wit and good humour of Borrowman,
but the virtues of the one and the good humour
of the other were admired not merely as virtues
and good humour, but as the virtues and good
humour of convenient friends.
Nothing can be, therefore, plainer than that
when two persons are associated together, in
what the world calls friendship, the association
is not from a perfect but from a partial coinci-

dence and sympathy. So we see wise men and
-foolsgood men and bad men-temporarily con-
nected in a friendship of what may be called an
imperfect sympathy. As Fitzgeorge was now
blazing forth again in a mighty brilliance of style,
and floating high on the frothy summit of po-
pular admiration, and as his highest glory was
that of dress and decoration, he most especially
drew the attention of the great masters of the
science of human ornament. Amongst these, or
rather at their head, was one Sir Nicholas Boba-
dil, who fain would have had the presumption
to contend with Fitzgeorge for the empire of
fashion. He piqued himself on the profundity
of his knowledge of what is called fashion, a
most curious topic indeed of knowledge, for
there is no possibility of saying in what record
it is kept, or by what means the knowledge is
to be acquired: for a time was when whatever
Sir Nicholas might do, and whatever Sir Ni-
cholas might wear, and whatever Sir Nicholas
"might eat, and whatever Sir Nicholas might

drink, was certain of being the fashion, absur-
dity, folly, or inconvenience being no bar what-
ever to its adoption. The mind of Sir Nicholas
was the store-room of fashion, and whatever
came from thence, or through that, was fashion-
able.
The union of two such mighty forces as Sir
Nicholas Bobadil and the Hon. Augustus Fitz-
george created much such a sensation in the
world of fashion, as the union of the courts of
Paris and London would create on the continent
of Europe; and the two new friends were proudly
conscious of the honourable and envied situa-
tion in which they stood. It is the lot of huma-
nity to be ruled by man. Much and proudly
as the human race may talk about independence,
it is a thing more talked about than apprehended.
We cannot be independent;--let independence
be presented to us, and we could not avail our-
selves of the boon. We must have leaders in
every thing. We must be told when and what
and how to eat. We have not spirit enough to

seasoning of our own meat, or the times of our
own eating and drinking. We must submit in
all these things to the dominion and despotism
of fashion. Who is fashion? What is fashion ?

called an officer of the king, we should regard
that king as a great and grievous tyrant; but
let fashion dictate whatever vagaries it may
please,directing and guiding us to any repul-
sive habits, or food, or drink, fashion must be
obeyed, and is cheerfully obeyed. Excellent is
the satire of the picture which represents a naked
man with a piece of cloth in one hand and a pair
of shears in the other, waiting to know in what
form fashion may direct him to cut his coat.
Let satire laugh, then, loudly as it will at the
absurd gravity of those who profess to set the

those who, with greater gravity, and with more
absurdity, follow the fashions thus set.
Dress, however, is but part of a gentleman,
and is that which an ingenious tailor may make
for a man who is not a gentleman. Manner is
infinitely more, and that is what no tailor can
make-it is a species of freemasonry, which
none but the initiated can understand it con-
sists of many mental tricks and aperiesit is the
suppressor of all real emotion, and the regulator
of all artificial emotion. It is the measure of a
man's knowledge, and the dictator of his igno-
rance. It is the polished medium through which
he vents his self-conceit, and the music by which
he modulates his insolence to the uninitiated.

time, and illustrative of character, were the
many anecdotes related of this pair of superfine
gentlemen. They encouraged one another in
excesses of absurdity, and carried that absurdity
to such lengths, as to make it almost respect-
able by its excessiveness. Perhaps the true se-
cret of what is now, or has been recently, termed
dandyism, is definable in two wordsit is the
seriousness of folly. Let the professors once
show that they regard their profession ludicrously,
the charm is broken and the mystery vanishes.
As a specimen of exquisite arrogance, the fol-
lowing reply has been attributed by some to
Fitzgeorge, and by others to Sir Nicholas Bob-
adil. They were exhibiting themselves in Hyde
Park, and they received much notice as usual,
some of which they acknowledged and others
of which they disdained to acknowledge. One
individual, in passing and repassing, had bowed
nearly twenty times without receiving any ac-
knowledgment. At length a bow was given in
return. " You have returned his bow at last."

" Rather say his bows one of mine is a re-
turn worth twenty of his."
It was Sir Nicholas Bobadil, we believe, who,
when dining at Fitzgeorge's table in company
with a bishop, and hearing mention made of the
" Act of Uniformity," affected to think that the
uniformity referred to the dress of the clergy,
and pretended to regard the act as very cruel and
oppressive.

CHAPTER XIII.
FATHER AND SON IN NO ADVANTAGEOUS
POINT OF VIEW.
It is not to be wondered at that Lord Fitz-
george, who was so passionately fond of ruling,
should be excessively annoyed and indignant at
the thought that he could not rule his own son.
But Augustus bore restraint with sufficient im-
patience in his minority, and of course was not
likely to submit to it with a better grace when
his minority was passed. The parties were at
issue on the matter of ruling from this circum-
stance, viz., their high rank in society. Lord
Fitzgeorge being a lord, and ruling many vassals,
tenants, and dependents, thought it a hard and

278
FITZGEORGE.
strange thing that he should not be able to rule
his own son; while, on the other hand, Augus-
tus Fitzgeorge, who was destined to rule over
others, thought it very strange that he should
not be suffered to rule himself. On this ground,
therefore, there was a perpetual struggle be-
tween the parties.
Lord Fitzgeorge, who was as near-sighted,
morally speaking, as a man could possibly be,
thought that he might excite the sympathy of
his neighbours and tenants against his son, by
appearing to the world as a pious and moral fa-
ther, opposed and thwarted by a vicious, pro-
fligate, and extravagant son. So that even in
his lordship's devotions, whatever sincerity there
might be in them, there was a strong admix-
ture of earthly and malignant feeling. Having
also a strong inclination to penurious habits,
and
no taste for the amusements and elegancies of
life, he thought to exhibit to his tenants a con-
trast with his more expensive son. But herein
they could see through him, and were not easily

FITZGEORGE.
279
deceived, except some few, such as were parti-
cularly favoured in the rent of their farms, or
such as had the run of the pantry at the hall.
Generally speaking, his tenants knew him too
well to be deceived by him; for though they saw
that he was penurious in trifles, yet they knew
he was extravagant in other matters, and that
he had very much wasted and exhausted their
resources by litigations with his neighbours,
great part of the expense of which fell upon
them; and they also knew that he was always
sending money to his wife's poor relations.
Augustus Fitzgeorge, who thought himself
exceedingly ill-treated by his father, wished also
to gain partisans among his neighbours, by let-
ting the world see how ill-disposed his father
was towards him, For this purpose he con-
trived, after there had been some unpleasant
correspondence between them, or some discus-
sion of an irritating nature, to meet his father
in public, and appear to salute him most respect-
fully; and then, when the bow was not returned,

280
FITZGEORGE.
every one would be sure to say,
that no one could
behave more respectfully to a parent than Au-
gustus did to Lord Fitzgeorge, but that the harsh
and unforgiving father was so unnatural as not
to return his salutation. Now, in the salutation
of Augustus Fitzgeorge there was such a cap-
tivating elegance, that all the world was charmed
with it; but the very elaborateness and studied
carefulness of his manner appeared to his father
more in the light of a mockery; this politeness,
therefore, instead of at all conciliating, rather
the more irritated and provoking.
It happened one day, that as Drury Borrow-
man, who never heeded what he said to Fitz-
george or to any one else, was dining with him in
private, and the conversation turned on their pe-
cuniary difficulties, Fitzgeorge remarked, I
know not how it is, but it seems to me that
there is nothing saved by saving."
" There is something lost by it," replied Bor-
rowman, "and that is time, patience, spirits,
and enjoyment."
## p. 281 (#293) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.

"There is my most honoured and worthy
father," said Fitzgeorge," who is so saving that
his fingers always smell of copper; I wonder
what he can be saving for."
" For fun," replied Borrowman; " it is very
fine fun for a man to have in the last days of
his life his pocket full of money, and his brains
full of maggots, and to set his poor relations
hunting after his maggots for the sake of his
money."
Fitzgeorge coupled something of an oath with
the mention of poor relations.
" It appears to me rather odd," said Borrow-
man, " that your father should so persecute you,
and, I may say, rob you for the sake of your
mother's relations. I was talking about you
the
other day with Leppard, and we agreed that you
ought to call the old gentleman to some account
about the management of your affairs during
your minority. You have been imposed on most
grossly. He is remarkably fond of a good name
among his neighbours and dependents, and if

you but threaten to show him up and to make
a legal investigation of the matter, he will not
care how he fleeces his tenants to save himself
and his darling reputation. He has not spirit
enough to aspire after the character of a good
fellow, but he goes sneaking about to get him-
self the reputation of being a good man."
" Now you mention this, I am inclined to
think that there is really something in it.
The rents of my estates and the interest of my
property must have been more than enough for
all the expenses of my minority.
my minority. But the fact
is that I know no more about arithmetic, as a
matter of business, or as applicable to pecuni-
ary transactions, than a mere child does. Let
us talk to Graves about it."
Certainly," replied Borrowman," he is the
best
person to speak to in the first instance. He
will for his own credit's sake do what he can to
prevent the exposure. Upon my word, you
great folks seem to do just what you like, and
to pay no regard whatever to the law."

FITZGEORGE.

" Ay," replied Fitzgeorge, "we may some-
times laugh at the law, when we can contrive to
manage or to silence it, but we never laugh at
public opinion. We are by that kept in check.
That is our law, and when that is in our favour
we care for no other."
are.
" I will speak to Graves on this subject," said
Borrowman.
" I will leave the matter entirely in your
hands," answered Fitzgeorge, " for I believe
that I have not in the world a surer, steadier,
more faithful, or more talented friend than you
The time may come, Borrowman, when I
may have it in my power to reward your ser-
vices with something more substantial than
hollow thanks and unsubstantial praises."
" My dear fellow," said Borrowman, "my
services, such as they are, reward themselves."
It is well that they did, for he never got any
other reward.
In pursuance of his resolution Borrowman
waited on the deep and solemn Mr. Graves.
## p. 284 (#296) ############################################
284
FITZGEORGE.
There was no person whom Mr. Graves disliked
more than, or indeed so much, as Drury Bor-
rowman. If a demure, matter-of-fact kind of a
gentleman dislikes a merry Andrew he has a
still greater abomination for a jack pudding, and
he that looks down contemptuously on a lion
looks down with still greater contempt on a
jackal. Thus did Mr. Graves regard Drury
Borrowman; for despising the principal, he still
more despised the friend and humble companion.
Besides Borrowman had the reputation of being
something of a wit, which was of all things the
most odious to Mr. Graves ; for he could not
see what was the use of wit. He had been
brought up to business, and to the exact keep-
ing of accounts and collecting of rents, and he
could not see the use of any people in the world,
save landlords, tenants, and collectors of rents.
He thought that tenants were very useful to
occupy farms, and landlords he considered as
properly engaged when they lived in great
houses and rode in fine coaches, and looked as

FITZGEORGE.
285
wise and as solemn as owls. Any thing ap-
proaching to a joke was his utter abomination.
When Borrowman, therefore, was ushered into
the little room where Mr. Graves sat, surrounded
with books, bills, parchments, and all the so-
lemn apparatus of business, the impatient stew-
ard thrust his pen behind his ear, pushed back
his spectacles over his forehead, and putting his
hands into his waiscoat pockets, he said, "Well,
sir, what is your business ?" He used the word
business with such an emphasis as to indicate
that he wished to hear of nothing but business,
and to hear that treated in a business-like
manner.
Sir," replied Borrowman, with a kind of
mock solemnity and half-laughing gravity, "I
have the honour to wait on you on most im-
portant business. I presume you are acquainted
with my worthy friend, the Hon. Augustus Fitz-
george."
"I am sorry to say that I am," replied Mr.
Graves; very sorryand I am sorry that you
## p. 286 (#298) ############################################
286
FITZGEORGE.
are so too; but I am glad that I am not so in-
timately acquainted with him as you are."
"Really, Mr. Graves," replied Borrowman,
" I am quite at a loss to know which is the
greatest, your joy or your sorrow."
Perhaps, sir," said Mr. Graves, rather pet-
tishly, "it does not much signify; for if you
did know, you would neither sympathize with
my sorrows nor exult in my joys. But if you
have business here, state it; if not"
Mr. Graves made a pause-and Borrowman
finished the sentence for him, by saying"Ay!
-if not, you think, I suppose, that I have no
business here. Very good ! But mark me, Mr.
Graves-I have business here of rather a serious
nature. My business is to inquire whether you
are prepared to give, when called upon, a full
statement of the expenses of the education of
the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge."
" A what?" said Mr. Graves, with all the
solemnity and indignation of an undertaker in a
passion. " I shall give no such account !"
## p. 287 (#299) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
287
" And will you advise Lord Fitzgeorge to re-
fuse the statement, should it be formally de-
manded ?"
" For what purpose can it be asked ?" re-
plied Mr. Graves ; " and who is to demand it ?"
"It is to be asked for the purpose of informa-
tion," said Borrowman; " and it is to be de .
manded by him who has a right and an autho-
rity to demand it. You may put a solemn face
on the matter; but you will not be able to stop
inquiry by wise looks. If your master has no-
thing to fear from the investigation, he will
suffer it to be made ;-if he has, he will know
how to prevent it."
Mr. Graves sat uneasily in his chair, and
looked as if he fain would be rid of his trouble-
some visiter, but as if he almost feared that it
would be dangerous to send him away unsatis-
fied or unpropitiated. The solemn steward,
therefore, relaxed a little from the rigidity of his
manners, and said, "Mr. Borrowman, this is,
## p. 288 (#300) ############################################
288
FITZGEORGE.
indeed, a curious and rather singular sort of
inquiry. 'Tis very odd that no mention has been
made of it before this time. I suppose that some
of Fitzgeorge's friends have been raising this
foolish suspicion in his mind. But can you se-
riously imagine that the world will believe it
possible that so good and pious a man as Lord
Fitzgeorge has been guilty of so gross a derelic-
tion of principle as to rob or plunder his own
son?"
" What the world may think I cannot say,"
replied Borrowman ; " but I will tell you plainly
what I think. I think and I know, and you
know that the whole annual proceeds of the
estates and properties of Augustus Fitzgeorge
were not spent in his maintenance and educa-
tion during his minority; they must, therefore,
have been otherwise applied. So my good Mr.
Graves, just as a matter of curiosity, we should
like to know what has become of the money. It
must be somewhere: and it is an inquiry in
## p. 289 (#301) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
289
which I am exceedingly interested to know where
it is. You can assist me in the inquiry, and so
perhaps can Lord Fitzgeorge himself."
" You are interested in the inquiry?" said Mr.,
Graves, rather sneeringly; "no doubt you are
interested ;
and
may
I ask to what amount ?"
" To what amount ?" responded Borrowman:
" I cannot understand you."
"Yes, yes," answered Mr. Graves," you
can understand; but perhaps it is desirable that
I should speak a little more plainly. You
are interested, Mr. Borrowman, in making an
inquiry, and your interest is to a certain amount,
either expressed or understood: suppose, now,
it should be found that your interest should be
greater to be silent, and suppress inquiry, than
it is to promote inquiry. You can easily imagine
that to be the case."
"So you think, Mr. Graves, that you can buy
me over from
my
friend."
" Politicians are marketable articles, Mr. Bor.
rowman.'

" But friends are not, Mr. Graves."
"A hem !" replied Mr. Graves; " Friends!
Friend is a fine word ; but if a man is fond of
being a friend, the best person that he can be a
friend to is himself. He that is evil to himself,
to whom will he be good ?"
Borrowman smiled, and replied, " No, no-
'twill not do. I do not hold my own esteem so
lightly as to play the traitor to him who depends
on my friendship, who confides in me who
wishes me well."
" I know Fitzgeorge better than you do," re-
plied Mr. Graves: " let it be his interest, his
passion, his caprice, or his desire from any cause
whatever, to be rid of
your friendship,
he will let you go as coolly as he will part with
an empty bottle."
"Ay, but I am not an empty bottle yet," re-
plied Borrowman.
" Perhaps not; but he will make you, or think
you so. Besides, what good can he do you ?"
Not much at present; but a time may
you and
come-

" Borrowman, you are a goose," said Mr.
Graves, with rather more animation than usual ;
you know nothing of the world. You have head
enough for a dozen, and yet too much heart for
your
head. For whom does a sensualist care but
for himself? You minister to his pleasures now,
and he flatters you, and calls you friend. So
you think, that when he becomes Lord Fitz-
george he will take as much pains to befriend
you, as you now take to befriend him. Not he,
depend upon it, he will want a new set of friends
then, and friends of a different kind---not men
of pleasure, but men of business."
" He will never be a man of business," re-
plied Borrowman.
" Certainly he will not," answered Graves;
" and for that reason he must put himself into
the hands of men of business."
" Look ye here," said Borrowman, almost
angry at the insinuations cast out against his
friend Fitzgeorge, " I am not a man of business,
and never shall be, if by a man of business

you mean a crafty, time-serving, selfish, money-
getting varlet, with no other idea than that of
pounds, shillings and pence. "
" Pounds, shillings and pence are very use-
ful things, Mr. Borrowman," said Mr. Graves;
some of these days you may find them so."
"One word for all," answered Borrowman:
"I tell you plainly, that if some account be not
very soon rendered to my friend, the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge, of the monies spent in his
education and maintenance during his minority,
legal and vigorous measures will speedily be
taken to compel an account. Your precious, pious,
fatherly, economical, home-keeping Lord Fitz-
george shall be exposed in his true colours ;-
the world shall see and know what they now very
little suspect to be that man's true character."
Why, surely, Mr. Borrowman," replied
Graves, " you will never be guilty of so gross
a violation of all decency as to advise and en-
courage a son to go to law with his own father!
And suppose, after all, be should be defeated."
## p. 293 (#305) ############################################
FITZGEORGE.
293
" A fiddlestick's end !" said Borrowman ;
decency, indeed! What sort of decency has
Lord Fitzgeorge shown towards his son ? I am
occupying your valuable time, Mr. Graves; so
I will leave you with the intimation, that unless
some account is soon forthcoming, you and your
master shall hear of it."
So saying, Borrowman departed to tell Fitz-
george the success of his mission, and to exult
in the anticipation, that means would soon be
forthcoming for a little more splendour and a
little more extravagance on the part of his be-
loved and esteemed friend, Fitzgeorge. Some
persons who knew the parties better than they
knew themselves, were very much surprised that
aman of so much acuteness as Borrowman should
not be able to discover more clearly the real cha-
racter of Fitzgeorge; but the fact was, as Mr.
Graves had told him, he had too much heart for
his head; he suffered his feelings to run away
with his judgment.
Mr. Graves, meanwhile, betook himself to his

as gentle as he could devise, the threats which
had been used by Borrowman.

it come to that? I think I had trouble enough with
him in his minority, without being now called

too much already."
" His creditors, my lord," replied Mr. Graves,
" will be the most ready to believe him. They
will hope, from the proceeds of the litigation, to
gain some part at least of their demands."
" True, true, yes, yes, I know all that," said
Lord Fitzgeorge, " I don't need to be reminded.
I see how it is perfectly. We must stop his
mouth, and take care that the world knows no-
thing about the matter. You shall go to church

" Your lordship is profound in wisdom," said
Mr. Graves. "There is not such another to be
found in the kingdom."
" Don't flatter, Mr. Graves," replied Lord
Fitzgeorge, you know I like not flattery; if you
would try your skill at flattery go to my son,
he loves flattery, and he will reward you for it
with fine promises, quite as much as it is
worth."
"I feel no inclination," said Mr. Graves, "to
leave wisdom for folly, carefulness for extrava-
gance, piety for profanity."
Lord Fitzgeorge bowed, Mr. Graves bowed,
and they separated. " Deep fellow, deep fel-
low," said his lordship to himself," understands
his business well, and I understand mine too."

CHAPTER I.
A NEw ATTACHMENT.
LoRD FITZGEORGE, like many other people,
was deeper than he was taken to be by some
of his neighbours, but not quite so deep as he
thought himself to be. He was prodigiously ob-
stinate; but he sometimes did change his mind,
and even when he made a change, he affected to
be persevering in his own original opinion. He
never would appear to be corrected by another
but if he found himself set right, he seemed to
think that the discovery was his own. So it was

in the matter narrated at the end of the last
chapter of the preceding volume. He was, at first
mention of the subject, fully against any conces-
sion to his son, or his son's counsellors; but on
more mature reflection, thinking of the unpopu-
larity which he might thereby incur, and consi-
dering the probability that he might be com-
pelled to surrender more than he could conve-
niently part with, he determined to make some-
thing of a compromise. In proposing or sub-
mitting to this compromise, he had also two
farther considerations: he knew that his son's
necessities were such, that for the sake of an
immediate supply he would be willing to make a
great sacrifice; and he knew also, that to a per-
son so involved as Augustus, a partial supply,
so far from extinguishing his debts, would ra-
ther increase them, and provoke him to farther
extravagance; so that at last his necessities
would compel him to surrender at discretion to
his father's proposal, that he should marry.
It was a matter of difficulty to some of the

FITZ GEORGE. 3
friends of the Fitzgeorge family, that considering
how jealously Lord Fitzgeorge regarded his son
and heir, that his lordship should be anxious to
settle him in marriage. Probably the truth is,
that it was nothing more than the love of power
that urged him in the matter, thinking that he
should have more influence over him, and that
he might govern him by means of his wife. Be
it as it may, the paternal exhortation perpe-
tually inculcated matrimony, while the filial in-
clination still persisted in the love of liberty.
A compromise, however, was made of the de-
mand which Augustus, by means of his friend,
Borrowman, set up against Lord Fitzgeorge;
and so happy was Augustus at the thought and
receipt of this temporary and timely supply,
that he thought himself at the summit of human
bliss, and at the height of human pride. He
now envied no man, and his fertile imagination
run riot amidst thoughts of carriages, and horses,
and dining-rooms, and drawing-rooms, and gilt
mouldings, and velvet curtains, and brilliant

chandeliers, and crowded rooms, and universal
admiration, till he found, or might have found,
if he had sought for the fact, that he had medi-
tated the expenditure of at least ten times the
amount of the sum that was promised. Then,
in the ardour of his selfish delight, which he
mistook for gratitude, he poured forth such a
torrent of thanks to his valuable and invaluable
friend, Borrowman, that Borrowman was per-
fectly satisfied that the ill-natured remarks which
Mr. Graves had made concerning the ingratitude
and selfishness of Fitzgeorge were totally un-
founded.
"Borrowman,'

said Fitzgeorge, "you have
done me a service which I cannot forget the
longest day that I have to live. A time may
come, and in all probability will, when I may
have it in my power to reward you as I ought
to do for your kindness and zeal. Thanks alone
can never repay you."
"Not a wordnot a word, my good friend,"
replied Borrowman; "I am more than repaid
## p. 5 (#15) ###############################################
FITZG EORGE. 5
by the very thought that I have had the happi-
ness of doing you a service. You mistake my
nature, if you fancy that I have any thought in
serving my friends beyond the pleasure which
that service brings me."
"And you mistake my nature," said Fitz-
george, "if you think that I can ever be un-
mindful of thezealous attachment of my friends."
It is a common mistake which people make,
both in joy and in sorrow, to measure and esti-
mate the whole of life by the sensations and
emotions of the passing hour. In high spirits, and
under circumstances of a temporary prosperity
or success, they are apt to consider themselves
the happiest beings in the universe; under cir-
cumstances of depression, sorrow, and disap-
pointment, they, by the same rule, or rather
want of rule, consider themselves the most
miserable and unhappy creatures that ever
lived. Now the very strength of the emotion,
be it of joy, or be it of sorrow, is a proof that
this is not so much a specimen as an exception.
## p. 6 (#16) ###############################################

If grief and depression were the general con-
dition of a man's being, he would not, at any
particular time, regard himself as particularly
unfortunate; nor, on the other hand, if he were
always prosperous and always in high spirits,
would he at any time think it so very remark-
able, as to pronounce himself the happiest of
men. It is as impossible to pass through life
always in joy and glee, as it would be to cross
the Atlantic Ocean always riding on the top-
most summit of the waves. Some persons re-
quire a longer time than others to find out this
fact; Fitzgeorge was one, who, not liking to
believe it, endeavoured to close his eyes against
the evidence of it. Reasoning he would not un-
derstand, because he would not attend to it;
and, as for experience, he reasoned against it with
an inverted logic; for instead of inferring that the
thing which has been is the thing that may be,
he reasoned that that which has been once is that
which never will be again; and instead of regard-
ing that which he had already experienced of life,
## p. 7 (#17) ###############################################
PITZ GEORGE. 7
as a sample of what it was, and would be, and
wnust be, he regarded it as an accidental excep-
tion, which, in future, might be easily avoided
and corrected. The language of the philoso-
pher, who, at his first symposium, had told him
that life was an alternation of joy and sorrow,
of light and darkness, often came to his recol-
lection by the practical illustration which it
received from facts; but it never became part of
his real, absolute, and positive belief. He had
certainly experienced many more annoyances
than he had anticipated, and he had not enjoyed
life with quite so unmingled a zest as he had
hoped to do. His actual condition since he
came of age had not realized the dreams of his
minority; but still he continued to dream on,
and to build his aerial castles with all the dili-
gence and romance of an inexperienced child.
We have seen that he was speedily disen-
chanted of his dream of eternal fondness, by
the insipid and silly servility of the roman-
tic Juliet, and from this disappointment he

took refuge in an almost diametrically opposite
attachment to the bold and masculine Isabella,
of whose brief career, and short-lived triumph,
nothing more needs to be said, than that however
soon Fitzgeorge might be wearied by an insipid
fondness and a spaniel-like servility, he rather
sooner tired of the affected impertinence of an
ignorant conceit, which, aware of the slavery of
its situation, yet bears itself with the free fami-
liarity of companionship and equality. Isabella
passed away like a shadow, soon, and willingly,
and easily forgotten.
Amidst the multitudinous acquaintance of
Fitzgeorge, there was one who caught at once
his fancy and admiration. She spread no lures
to win his roving heart, she played no tricks,
assumed no affectations to draw his attention;
nay, she sought not for and thought not of his
attention; but when accident brought him near
to her, and when he addressed her in ordinary
conversation, her language and sentiments, her
tone and manners, were so exceedingly delightful

to him, that he was fascinated unknowingly
and unthinkingly. There are many scenes and
combinations in nature, which are beautiful
beyond all language to describethe beauty of
which is rather felt than seen. There is an in-
terest and a beauty, for instance, in some land-
scapes, in certain conditions of the air and sky,
and temperament of him who views them, which
cannot be readily described or defined ;-there
is nothing, perhaps, to excite a loud applause,
or to call forth a rapturous exclamation as to
the verdure of the trees, or the undulations of
the green hills, or the fragrance of the groves,
or the music of the birds, or the balmy softness
of the air, or the cerulean stillness of the bright
sky, or the genial warmth of the sun; but
every thing harmonizes together, pouring into
the soul a fulness of delight, which is too sacred
for words, or for passionate admiration. There
is the same kind of harmony in many of the
works of art, as in a well-inspired oratorio,
where every thing is so perfectly beautiful that

nothing is peculiarly beautifulwhere there is
the perfection of propriety and pathos, where
there is a right arrangement and a due appor-
tionment of all the component parts, so that
the sentiment of devotion is not clumsily inter-
rupted by the impertinence of imperfect art;
but where the perfection of art, silently, invisi-
bly, and unobtrusively, ministers to the produc-
tion of the high devotional and poetic effect of
the whole. Such perfect harmony, such orderly
beauty as this, is sometimes found in the hu-
man character, when mind and features, style,
manner, thought, sentiment, tone and expres-
sion, all harmonize in one general beauty; so
that there is no sacrifice of one good quality to
another; so that the mind does not rob the
face, nor the face the mind; so that there is
beauty which the eye may admire, and thought
with which the mind may converse; so that
while the goodness of the understanding will
not let us dwell exclusively on the beauties of
the person, the handsomeness of the features

FITZGEORGE. 11
will not suffer us to give all our admiration to
the strength of the understanding; and while
the elegance of the expression divides our atten-
tion to the soundness of the thoughtthe jus-
tice of the sentiments gives us something more
to admire than merely external elegance of
Tnanner.
Little, however, as such harmony may strike
us with admiration at the moment, it leaves a
deep impression, and silently weaves a web which
has its strength in the fineness of its fibres. So
was Fitzgeorge fascinated by the mind and man-
ners, the style, the grace, the pure and perfect
propriety, of Emily. He was proud of himself
that he could admire and appreciate such ex-
cellence. He had reason to think more highly
of himself for having a mind capable of such
an attachment, and susceptible of such an ad-
miration. He now thought more contemptuously
than ever of the feeble and mindless Julietof
the bold and thoughtless Isabella. He had
gained for a moment his own moral approbation,

-

and was beginning to think that he was as much
superior to the mass of mankind in moral and
intellectual apprehension, as he was in the cut
of his coats and the gracefulness of his manners.
The admiration, however, of excellence is not
always the true apprehension of excellence; and
it is very possible that many may have an ad-
miration for an excellent, amiable, and intelli-
gent woman, who may not fix their admiration,
or originate their approbation in the amiableness
and intellect of the character. Fitzgeorge ad-
mired, with a passionate and respectful ad-
miration, the charming and interesting Emily.
Yet it is very possible, and more than probable,
that his admiration of her would have been but
feeble, had there not been much personal beauty
and great elegance of manners. True strength
and beauty of character is seen in the right cul-
tivation of internal strength and external ele-
gance; they are feeble who cultivate manner
alone, and are merely attentive to outward ap-
pearance; and they are not truly admirable who,

cultivating the intellectual and moral powers,
have no time or thought for external manners.
But Fitzgeorge bestowed his most exquisite at-
tention on that which was external, and what-
ever cultivation he gave to his mind by thought
or reading, was merely subordinate and mini-
strative to appearance. He lived for himself
and the world;for himself so far as enjoyment
was concerned, and for the world in the matter
of admiration. Part of his love for, and his
approbation of, Emily, was a thought of the
world, and of the admiration with which she
was regarded.
But in this new attachment there sprung up
a great and serious difficulty, perplexing Fitz-
george, and disappointing his philosophy. He
had commenced life with most brilliant pros-
pects and most sanguine hopes, and had ap-
peared to the eye of the world, and at times
even to himself, as an object of universal envy;
for there was no one, he thought, who would

not be happy to hold such a rank as he did in
societyto live in such splendourto enjoy
such homage; and yet, notwithstanding that he
appeared to be such an object of universal envy,
he was even in these very enviable circumstances,
and almost by the very means of them, placed
in awkward perplexities; so that it should seem
that the order of things was quite inverted, and
that nobody was so poor as the rich, and no-
body was kept in so much restraint as those who
imposed restraint on others. He loved Emily

to him, preventing that stagnation of mind and
feeling which is the most miserable condition of
being that can be imagined.
So much awe do real goodness of heart and
decided strength of mind inspire, that Fitzgeorge
in the presence of Emilywas irresistibly
compelled to the utmost reverence and respect-
fulness of manner, and in the contemplation of
her mental and moral superiority he lost all
thought of inferiority of caste. As far as man-
mer is concerned, no one could be a more agree-
able companion than Fitzgeorge. Charmed by
the attractiveness of his manners, and perhaps
flattered not a little by the notice of so distin-
guished and admired a personage, Emily treated
not her lover with any distance or cold reserve,
because she regarded him not as a lover.There is
often fear where there is no danger, and there is
Sometimes danger where there is no fear. This
is especially true in affairs of the heart. Two

pany, but not apprehensive of serious attach-

ment, are in imminent danger, from their very
security, of gradually becoming more and more
essential to each other. This was the case with
Emilyand Fitzgeorge, more especially as it
concerned the lady. So very accurate was her
sense and perception of propriety, that it was
morally impossible for Fitzgeorge to propose any
other than the most honourable arrangement;
and so situated was he, that he could not pro-
pose marriage. But as self-denial was not any
part or parcel of the system or habit of his de-
portment, he regarded not these obstacles, and
saw not, or thought not, of the difficulties in
which both would be involved on the supposi-
tion that a mutual attachment should grow up
between them. Every opportunity, therefore,
that he could find or make, he eagerly em-
braced, for the purpose of enjoying the in-
creasingly interesting society of Emily.
It was not till the attachment had proceeded
too far to be lightly broken, that the parties them-
selves became sensible of it, and of the per-

plexing difficulties into which it would plunge
them.
"There is no other alternative," said Fitz-
george, "than a private marriage, which shall
be so effectually concealed from the world,

When there is a sincere and real attachment,
there is not always a readiness of utterance, nor
a clearness of apprehension, of what the mind
means, and what the tongue would say. Sen-
tences are frequently begun which it is not easy
to finish, and of those that are finished, there is
sometimes a difficulty of interpretation. To the
above unfinished sentence uttered by Fitzgeorge,
and which was unfinished, not because it was
interrupted, but because the speaker knew not
well how to proceed, Emily replied"A mar-
riage so private, that it shall leave me exposed
to reproaches not more undeserved than an-
swerable !"
"But such a marriage as I would offer, you
know I cannot." replied Fitzgeorge.

Here the lady left a sentence unfinished,
which Fitzgeorge attempted to finish for her.
"Therefore," said he, "the acquaintance ought
not to have proceeded so far. Your remark is
just; but since it has proceeded thus far, and

since we are
There was a strong intimation in the above
fragment of a sentence that Fitzgeorge took it
for granted that the attachment was mutual, and
that the parties were so much interested in each
other as to be essential to each other's happi-
ness. There may be to some minds a little dif-
ficulty to reconcile to their notions of propriety
the fact, that a lady of so much apparent dis-
cernment and so much good feeling, and almost
moral dignity, should, knowing, as she must
have known, the general character of Fitzgeorge,
have given to him so much of her society, and
## p. 19 (#31) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 19
have suffered an attachment to him to take pos-
session of her heart. It is undoubtedly a dif-
ficulty to account for the fact; and there are in
the world many moral difficulties, and in the
conduct of the human race there are many
unaccountablenesses, which give to humanity
much of its interest. There would, indeed, be
next to no interest in the study of human nature
were there not many of its movements not easily
explicable, for these excite the curiosity and
stimulate the mind to research. Much as the
human heart may have been investigated as to
its motives and principles, there is much yet to be
learned about it; the human race is by no means
well acquainted with itselfperhaps it is too
interestedperhaps it is too proud to learn
perhaps that which it might learn would have a
tendency to humiliate itor there may be ten
thousand other reasons which we cannot dis-
cover or do not suspect, and which contribute to
blind us to the true philosophy of our nature.
So, however, it was, that this lady, from what-

ever cause, or on whatever principle, being her-
self of high repute and good moral feeling, and
strong sense of propriety, did, notwithstanding
the well-known profligacy of Fitzgeorge, and
notwithstanding that she could not but know
of the history of Juliet and of Isabella, look on
him with approbation, and with a feeling of at-
tachment and deep regard. For his sake, and
for the sake of propriety, and to avoid those
evils which her reflective and discerning mind
saw to be likely to result from the indulgence of
the attachment, she separated herself as much
as possible from himresisting his importuni-
tiesavoiding his societyand sincerely hop-
ing that absence and distance might wean his
mind and thoughts from her. Fitzgeorge, though
not himself a person of great delicacy of senti-
ment and true generosity of feeling, was yet
highly capable of admiring these qualities in
others. Even as a coward, who is such by na-
tural constitution, and is nervously afraid of
every wind that blows and every shadow that
## p. 21 (#33) ##############################################
FITZG EORGE. 21
moves, is not insensible to the majesty of a firm
and decided courage; so it not seldom happens
that a thoroughly selfish sensualist, who is dis-
posed to sacrifice every thing to his own indul-
gence and enjoyment, is capable of appreciating
and admiring a natural generosity of spirit which
sacrifices itself to another's welfare from a sense
of beauty and moral elegance;perhaps, in-
deed, they who are most heartily selfish, are
most truly and deeply susceptible of the impres-
sion of the beauty of generosity, inasmuch as
they are most ready to avail themselves of the
advantages offered by the generous. Present or
absent, therefore, his attachment to Emily in-
creased and strengthened hourly and daily.
All this intelligence was regularly carried to
Lord Fitzgeorge, and the proceedings of Au-
gustus were watched with the utmost strictness:
his father, indeed, knew that there could be with
him and Emily only a private marriage, if any,
and he also knew, that with whatever scruple
that marriage might be regarded by the lady, or

however sacred it might be in her eyes, it would
not be considered as a matter of much sanctity
by Augustus. It was the policy of Lord Fitz-
george, and of his crafty steward, Mr. Graves,
to keep a constant watch upon all the movements
of Augustus; so that while he had no suspicion
that his proceedings were at all known or even
suspected, they were all as well known to his
father as to himself.
Even in this more reputable, as in his other
less reputable, attachments, Fitzgeorge found
himself annoyed and disturbed. The language
of him whom he had called the gloomy philoso-
pher was perpetually recurring to his mind, and
he was more than half inclined at some moments
to believe that there was some truth in it; but
then again, on the other hand, his luxurious
mind could not bear to anticipate in life nothing
better than he had hitherto enjoyed. Still,
therefore, he dwelt in the pleasing hope that
these annoyances would cease, and that he
should have the full accomplishment of his san-
## p. 23 (#35) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 23
guine and selfish wishes to enjoy life to the ut-
most of human desire. All the happiness which
mortals, according to the present constitution of
their being, enjoy, is the alleviation of their pains,
the gratification of their desires, the removal of
their wants. What would be their condition,
whether enviable or not, did they feel no pains,
were they to be disturbed by no desires, or to
be pressed by no wantswe cannot tell, because
there never has been a being so situated. It
was, however, the ambition of Fitzgeorge to aim
at this state of universal and general ease; but
having passed through several years of the life
of his majority, he had not as yet found that
perfect content which he had anticipated. He
continued to encourage the hope, and perhaps
by the very extravagance of his wishes he was
all the farther removed from contentment and
mental quiet.

CHAPTER II.
A PRIVATE MARRIAGE.
FitzGeoRGE was not easily to be disputed,
reasoned, or persuaded out of his humour. Self-
willed, and obstinate as an untaught child, he
could not bear contradiction, or submit his ca-
prices to regulation. He had settled it in his
own mind, that his only prospect of happiness
was in the society of Emily; and though with
the intention, and probably the hope of divert-
ing him from his pursuit, she had withdrawn
herself from his society, depriving herself also
of much other agreeable society, in and with
which she had hitherto lived, it was all in vain;
## p. 25 (#37) ##############################################
FITZG EORGE. 25
the attachment of Fitzgeorge still continued,
and his happiness still appeared to depend on
her. Returning, therefore, again into the so-
ciety from which she had so long voluntarily
and considerately secluded herself, Emily found
Fitzgeorge still as devotedly attached as ever,
and as importunate as ever for her consent to a
private marriage.
Whether any secret has ever been kept, save
that of the authorship of Junius's Letters, is not
to be ascertained; and perhaps that secret was
only kept successfully, because suspicion fell
not at the time upon the real author; for had
he been suspected, he must have been detected.
But to keep secret a marriage between Fitz,
george and Emily would have been next to im-
possible; because, by the parties desiring to
ascertain it, the marriage was suspected. Mr.
Graves, therefore, and the people in his employ,
were incessantly on the watch, and it was no
small difficulty to elude their vigilance.
Fitzgeorge and Emily might lay their plans

26 FITZGEORGE.
with the utmost sagacity; but as for the purpose
even of the most private of marriages, the co-
operation of other persons than themselves was
absolutely necessary, they could not, of course,
be certain that their secret should be inviolably
and securely kept. Furthermore, it might have
been very easily imagined by Fitzgeorge, that
when such a step was once contemplated as
possible by those who were watching him, they
would not hesitate to accuse him of the marriage,
whether they had sufficient evidence or not that
it had taken place. In the general course and
current of Fitzgeorge's life, it had been his
almost invariable practice to regard himself
alone, and to seek only for his own personal
gratification, caring not whom or what he might
sacrifice to it; but as pure selfishness, and per-
fect sensuality are not instincts of our nature, as
we have the instincts of affection and sympathy,
and as these are only to be destroyed or neutra-
lized by a long course of sensuality, and by.
many years of studious devotion to selfishness,
## p. 27 (#39) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 27
Fitzgeorge had occasionally exhibited, to his
friends and others, symptoms of a regard to the
common sympathies and integrity of humanity;
he had not been from the beginning, and
throughout, perfectly without all good feeling,
therefore there still adhered to him those who
sought for, and who fancied that they possessed,
his confidence. Now he had craft enough to
suppose, that one most effectual method of
keeping secret a private marriage from the rest
of the world, would be to keep it secret from
those of his friends whom he had apparently
and really treated with the greatest confidence.
Perhaps they showed no great penetration,
when, in spite of all their wit and wisdom,
they still thought that he would never violate
the sanctity of truth and friendship towards
them, even though in so many other instances
he had manifested so little regard for the obli-
gations or right feelings of humanity.
Having at length, by dint of ceaseless impor-
tunity, persuaded Emily to consent to a mar-

riage that should be more than ordinarily pri-
vate, and that, in fact, should never be divulged
to the world at large, he took care that the
secret should be as much as possible in his own
keeping; for he bound her to a perfect silence,
under a stipulation, that with those by whom
it most concerned her to be honourably re-
ceived, and respectfully thought of, there should
be sufficient understanding, that whatever she
might appear to the rest of the world, she might
be considered as the wife of Fitzgeorge.
"I am yours," said he, "for life;the absurd
condition which is attached to my title and
estates, controlling and regulating me in the
article of marriage, is not able to compel me to
marriage. In the eye of the law, I am single.

if he will, but his importunities shall not avail

of us had occasion to remark, that while it is the
business of lawyers to make laws clear and in-
telligible, it is their amusement to make them
obscure and unintelligible. Every where, but
at the mansion of Lord Fitzgeorge, you will be
received as my wife."
"Lord Fitzgeorge," replied Emily, "suspect-
ing the relation in which I stand to you, may,
from a feeling of resentment, be still more im-
portunate in urging you to marriage, thinking
that he may thereby compel you to an acknow-
ledgment that shall involve you in much diffi-
culty. You will be thereby exposed to a con-
stant persecution."
"A persecution of notes and messages," re-
plied Fitzgeorge, "I can bear with most ex-
emplary fortitude."
"I have so far consented to be yours, as that,
should there be a necessity for you to marry ac-
cording to the conditions annexed to your in-
heritance, it may be done, and I am no obstacle
in the way."

"I duly and deeply appreciate yourgenerosity,
- but I trust and am assured that there will be no
necessity at any period of my life to avail my-
self of it. Such confidence on your part de-
mands, and will experience on mine, an equal
degree of liberality." - -
Fitzgeorge was far differently affected to-
wards Emily than he had been towards Juliet
or Isabella. In the silliness of the first, and in
the boldness of the last, he had found a tem-
porary but not a durable interest. There was
nothing in either of them to command respect,
or to retain affection. They were not either of
them able to exercise the slightest power over
him; they did not govern him, but they were
merely his human toys; and, from the violence
of a passionate fondness, he soon passed by a
quick and easy transition to indifference, dis-
gust, contempt. In the character and mind of
Emily there was moral beauty and intellectual
strength; she had power by virtue of her moral
qualities; she ruled by mind, and a sound, ju-
## p. 31 (#43) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 31
dicious power of thought. The style of her con-
versation was such, indeed, as, notwithstanding
the multiplicity of his acquaintance and inter-
course with the world, he had not been accus-
tomed to. There was elegance and mental su-
periority, a mild lustre that made home beauti-
ful and society brilliant. -
Fitzgeorge professed liberality and generosity;
they were virtues for which he had an admira-
tion, but the admiration which he most deeply
and sincerely felt for them was founded in a
contemplation of their usefulness to himself;
and this is an advantage that a person in a high
condition in society very peculiarly enjoys, that
he may make a little liberal sentiment and talk
go a great way; he may make an admirable
market of his condescension; he may gain much
applause for that which, from a person of in-
ferior rank, would not excite any very loud lan-
guage of commendation. Greatness is so much
admired for itself, that all which it does and
says is regarded as somewhat marvellous, and

worthy of all praise and consecration. Of this
peculiarity in greatness, Fitzgeorge was willing
to avail himself most abundantly, and he had
sagacity enough to see his advantage. He knew
that a great man's promise is worth more than a
little man's performance. This, and many other
lessons, he learned in the course of his life, and
he grew more and more perfect by practice and
perseverance. In like manner, as the virtues
are exaggerated in persons in lofty stations, so
also are the mental powers and endowments of
the understanding. The stores of erudition and
the accomplishments of mind of persons in the
highest walks in life are estimated according to
the elevation of the rank, not according to the
actual and real ability. In the enjoyment,
therefore, of intellectual pleasures, and in the
exercise of the mind in thought, he had a re-
ference to applause and a high esteem; so the
very virtues and mental powers of Emily be-
came to him the means of a lofty pride. He
had been proud of Juliet's beauty, and of Isa-

FITZ GEORGE. 33
bella's bold and haughty spirit; he was now
equally proud of the superior and commanding
intelligence of Emily. There was a pleasant
variety to him in the change of his object of
idolatry, and he could easily persuade himself
that he was as much superior to the rest of the
world in intellect and mind as he was in fashion
and manners.
Privately as his marriage had been performed,
accompanied by all the caution which prudence,
timidity, and craftiness could suggest, Mr.
Graves had contrived to find it out, and to
ascertain all the particulars, and to possess him-
self of all the evidence which was necessary to
establish and to blazon the fact, if there should be
need of such a step. The information, of course,
was immediately carried to Lord Fitzgeorge,
who heartily rejoiced in the perplexity to which
his son was thus likely to be reduced, and little
heeded the endless and perhaps ruinous litiga-
tion which might follow, provided any public or
legal notice might be taken of the matter.
C 3

There had been one evil in the previous at-
tachments of Fitzgeorge which did not at first
sight appear to attach itself to the present; for
Juliet and Isabella had been pennyless, and
therefore expensive companions; but Emily had
property. Such, however, was the constitu-
tional and inseparable carelessness of Fitzgeorge,
that scarcely any conceivable income would
have been sufficient for his lavish and thought-
less expenditure. The term thoughtless seems
almost improperly applied to his expenditure,
inasmuch as there appeared to be a studious
extravagancean exercise, as it were, of the ut-
most ingenuity to devise modes of getting rid
of money, and when money was gone to devise
modes of increasing embarrassments. It is not,
however, literally true that Fitzgeorge really
did make a business of studying modes of ex-
pense; his extravagance was merely to supply
his wants, and his wants were every thing he
saw or thought of. If jewels more costly than
those worn by Emily appeared on any other
## p. 35 (#47) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 35
individual, it was impossible for Emily to appear
in public again till her brilliants exceeded those
ofevery rival. If a chair, a table, a sofa, a carpet,
a sideboard, a curtain, or any piece of furniture or
decoration appeared in any other house rivalling
or approaching the corresponding articles in the
mansion of Fitzgeorge, it forthwith became es-
sential to his well-being that a more sumptuous
and expensive style of decoration should be pro-
vided; and immediately the ingenuity of inven-
tion was set to work, and the extravagance of
fancy was called into exercise. If any other
mansion presumed to vie in magnificence with his,
then it became an absolute necessary of life that
new rooms should be constructed or old ones
enlarged, and if a new apartment when finished
did not quite answer the expectation formed of
its appearance or proportions, it was presently
dismantled and reconstructed. Fitzgeorge had
a taste, Emily also had a taste, and at no
regard to expense the taste was gratified. Fitz-
george had in truth no other occupation than

devising forms of luxury and modes of ex-
travagance. Painters, architects, and all the
contributors to the pride of the eye, were con-
stantly around him, receiving orders, sug-
gestions, and hints, which of course they took
care to improve to their own professional ad-
vantage. It was a pleasant amusement, when
his presence was not demanded at the toilet or
the table, to draw out plans of architectural
improvement, and to amuse the eye with
sketches of furniture that promised to eclipse
all that had been constructed in past ages.
All this required money, more money than Fitz-
george could possibly command. He was not
unfrequently tempted to amuse himself with
devising how many and how splendid mansions
he would cause to be erected when the title and
estates of Lord Fitzgeorge should devolve upon
him. He saw in his mind's eye edifices rising
in every direction, surpassing in extent and
beauty all that had ever been in existence.
Such indeed was the extent of his ability in this

department of architectural invention, that the
professional persons who attended upon him
could not withhold their admiration, but pro-
nounced him to have been born with such a
genius as might wellentitle him to the appellation
of the prince of architects. In like manner he
was also equal to any thing in the invention and
construction of articles of dress, so that he might
be called with as much propriety the prince of
tailors. It was his ambition to excel in whatever
he directed his attention to, and for that purpose
he very wisely directed his attention only to
those matters in which he was sure to excel.
He knew his own strengththe power of his
mind, the reach of his intellect, the stretch of
his thought.
All this time where was poor Juliet 2 What

the reward of notice, thanks, or recognition.
Fitzgeorge was surrounded by architects,
tailors, jewellers, musicians, and many more
consumers of the means of the opulent; he had
nothing to spare for Juliet. The bond was
destroyed; there was no claim upon him but
on the ground of humanity, of honour, of de-
cency; and what are humanity, honour, and
decency, when put in competition with splendid

Juliet had heard the loud whisper that circu-
lated every where, and that said that Fitzgeorge
was married to Emily. Juliet was almost com
pelled to believe that he had now quite for-
gotten her; but she was reluctant to believe.
She dared not present herself again to him at
his house, and she hesitated to remind him even
by letter or message of the act of generosity of
which she had been so foolishly guilty. But she
could throw herself purposely and frequently in
his way; he was visible in the parks, but she
was not visible to him. Many were the at-

FITZGEORGE. 39
tempts which she made to draw his attention,
but they all failed because he would not see her.
Poor simpleton She even then persisted in
believing that she had lost his regard, not from
his own caprice, or because she had ceased to
please, but because she had enemies who had
calumniated her and misrepresented her. They
are silly people for the most part who talk of
having enemies! Enemies can do but little
harm to those who are not enemies to them-
selves; and, generally speaking, people are more
engaged in endeavouring to do good to them-
selves than in endeavouring to do harm to others.
Whenever one is injured by another it is mostly,
if not solely, when one stands in the way of
another; for few will put themselves much out
of the way to do good to others, and fewer still
will go much out of their way to do ill to others.
If Juliet had possessed common sense, and a
little more thought than a mere child, neither
Fitzgeorge nor any one else could have done
her any harm.

Certainly it was exceedingly mortifying and
distressing to Juliet, that while she was sur-
rounded with duns, pressed with difficulties, in
want of the common comforts of life, he who had
been the means of reducing her to that situation
should be living in the midst of luxuries, and
lavishing in an idle and profitless expenditure
that wealth, one very, very small portion of
which would have rescued her from distress. It
was mortifying indeed to Juliet, that having in
a moment of generous frenzy cancelled the bond,
when Fitzgeorge was in difficulty and humility,
she should now be scorned and neglected by him
when he was again shining in prosperity and
wealth. Poor Juliet ! She was a pitiable ob-
ject, but not perhaps much more pitiable than
Fitzgeorge himself. - -

CHAPTER III.
DU.N.S.
WHILE Fitzgeorge and Emily were living in
an enviable and envied splendour, and the eyes
of the world were fixed upon them in a gaze of
admiration, Lord Fitzgeorge and Mr. Graves
were watching their progress, and observing with
no small degree of satisfaction the accumulation
of embarrassments. Every particular was con-
veyed to Lord Fitzgeorge; every model and every
plan, every device and every extravagance; and
with the follies, as he called them, of his son the
old gentleman would make merry.

and son, and comparing the splendid and extra-
vagant mode in which the son lived with the
penurious and unostentatious way in which the
father livedcomparing the wit and levity of
Fitzgeorge's companions with the wisdom and
gravity which distinguished Mr. Graves and the
company who generally visited Lord and Lady
Fitzgeorge, comparing also the piety of Lord
Fitzgeorge, who went to church very much and
said his prayers very loud, with the negligence
of Augustus, who not frequently went to church,
and when he did, made no more noise than the
rest of the congregationcomparing also the
attachment and fidelity of Lord Fitzgeorge to
one woman not remarkable for wit or beauty,
with the changing and ranging attachments of
Fitzgeorge to various individuals remarkable

plete contrast between the two, and that it was
impossible to approve of the one without disap-

proving of the other, and that it was equally im-
possible to blame the one without praising the
other. But there were some people who could
and did see that the difference between father
and son was rather nominal than real, and more
superficial than substantial. It was clear enough
to those, who would observe, that both father
and son were exceedingly self-willed and deci-
dedly selfish, and that the moving principle in
each was differently modified, but of equal moral
merit or demerit. If Augustus was lavish in his
expenditure, it was in pursuit of his humour; and
if Lord Fitzgeorge was careful and penurious, it
was also in pursuit of his humour. If Augustus
parted with money, it was because he liked to
part with it; and if Lord Fitzgeorge put change
for sixpence into his pocket, it was because he
did not like to part with it. If Lord Fitzgeorge's
penuriousness did any one an injury, it was totally
unintentional ; and if Augustus by his extrava-
gance conferred a benefit on any one, that was
also as unintentional. Their moral tastes were

different in manifestation, but alike in their roots
and origin. They pleased themselves, or at least
they endeavoured to do so, but were not always
successful; they were often angry with them-
selves, and then fancied that they were angry
with one another; for no man is very angry with
another who is not angry with himself. If a man
be at ease within he is at ease without; it is only
when there is something not right in a man's own
mind, conduct, or concerns, that he is mightily
angry with others. Lord Fitzgeorge was not
very well at his ease in his own ostentatious de-
votion, and therefore he was angry with his son
for a lack of devotion. Lord Fitzgeorge was
not at ease in matters of a pecuniary nature, and
therefore he was shocked at the abominations of
his son's extravagance; and it may be strongly
suspected that it was not merely a sense of his
own domestic bliss that urged the father on to
importune the son to marriage. We do not
ordinarily find that they who are perfectly satis-
fied and happy in their own situations are very

FITZGEO frc E. 45
restless in urging others to come into the same
situations. The monkey who had lost his tail
took great pains to persuade others to part with
their tails, but they who had not lost their tails
did not make so great a fuss with their attempts
to induce others to keep their tails. Lord Fitz-
george perhaps was not weary of the marriage
yoke, and his life perhaps had not been posi-
tively imbittered by it; but it was not quite so
sweet as he endeavoured to persuade himself
that it was, and therefore he wished to make
himself believe that it was happier than he had
recognised it to be, even as they whose faith is
doubtful are exceedingly anxious to gain prose-
lytes to keep themselves in countenance.
Now Lord Fitzgeorge was somewhat pleased to
find that this step of his son, in contracting a pri-
vate marriage, had brought him more completely
into the toils that had been laid for him: for the
father knew that his son would never be so
mad as to plead this concealed marriage as a
valid bond, preventing his marriage with ano-

46 EITZGEORGE.
ther. Lord Fitzgeorge knew well enough that
his son would not sacrifice his title and estates
for the sake of any woman, how fascinated so-
ever he, for a time, might be with her; and this
pious nobleman, notwithstanding all his pretence
to religion, would have no scruple whatever in
urging his son to a violation of the laws of God,
by contracting a second marriage, when and
while his first wife was living. Nay, rather did
this man of affected conscientiousness mightily
rejoice in the almost certainty that the expenses
and embarrassments of this concealed marriage
would compel him to submit to a public mar-
riage. The sincerity of a man's religion can
never be ascertained while a compliance with
the dictates of that religion runs in a line with
his own humour, or subserves to the purposes of
his own interests; but the moment that religion
induces an actual self-denial, an opposition to a
man's humour, there is seen the sincerity of
obedience, and then is manifested the strength
of principle.

The pious Lord Fitzgeorge rubbed his hands
and smiled, and said, "Ha, ha, I thought so
thought soknew what it would come to"
when the solemn Mr. Graves, with a solemn
face, informed him that the Hon. Augustus
Fitzgeorge was in difficulties again.
"What do his debts amount to?" asked Lord
Fitzgeorge. -
"They are variously stated," said the crafty
steward.
"Variously stated 1" echoed his lordship;
"nonsense, Mr. Graves, nonsense Don't tell
me about various statements. It is your busi-
ness to know the exact amount. I tell you
whatlet him go onlet him go on, till there
is no possibility of his paying them by any re-
trenchments out of his income. And can't you
persuade his creditors to annoy him by their
importunities: set them at him in the park and
in the streets, let them drive him away from
his public haunts, and interfere with his vanity
when he is displaying himself in public. If he

goes to the theatre, let some of his creditors get
into the next box, or into the pit immediately
beneath him, and let him hear them talk loudly."
"This will look like persecuting him," re-
plied Graves.
"No doubtso it ishe ought to be perse-
cuted; what else does he deserve? I was never
so extravagant when I was a young man. I
married as soon as my mother bade me to
marry, and took up with the choice that my mo-
ther made for me. Augustus has father and
'mother too to make a choice for him; and yet
he has the impudence to despise and neglect
both. He shall marryI am resolved he shall
marry."
Fitzgeorge's creditors were not with any great
difficulty persuaded, by the situation of affairs,
to urge for payment of their numerous and in-
creasing demands. They had held back for a
while, and continued to supply goods to a great
amount, because they would not loose a good
customer. They had been afraid of using any

FITZGEORGE. 49
importunity, lest it should recoil with injurious
effect on themselves, and deprive them of busi-
ness. But the accumulation of debts rendered
it absolutely necessary that some steps should
be taken to procure a liquidation of them. It
was in vain to apply to Fitzgeorge's steward, he
had no means to meet their numerous and deep
demands; and it was in vain that the steward
made his personal application to Fitzgeorge
himself, for he had no means whereby any satis-
factory answer could be given to such applica-
tion. Letters were sent, but letters were easily
burnt; and it was considered far better to burn
them without opening them, than to waste time
in perusing words that were not very pleasant to
read, and which, in all their various modifica-
tions, only meant one and the same thing. As
letters were sent in vain, the next resource was
personal application. The porter, indeed, could
keep the impertinent people out of the house;
but there was no power that could prevent these
same people from waylaying Fitzgeorge in the

.
streets, and forcing in person their demands
upon him. They knew, indeed, that he had not
wherewithal to pay; but they were in hopes that,
by provoking and annoying him, they should
compel him to some scheme whereby their
silence might be purchased.
Very few months passed during the whole
course of the life of Fitzgeorge in which he had
not, on some account or other, reason to call to
mind the language of the gloomy philosopher;
and every time that he called it to mind, he had
increasing reason to believe in its truth; but
still, whenever its truth was forcing itself upon
his mind, he used all manner of efforts to resist
the impression. In his present condition, sur-
rounded by importunate creditors, whom he
could neither satisfy by payment nor silence by
a plausible promise, his situation was by no
means enviable. He dared not to examine into
the state of his affairs, for, in the first place, the
examination would be attended with a great deal
of trouble, which was a thing that he exceed-

FITZGEORGE. 51
ingly disliked; and, in the next place, his know-
ledge of his affairs would not at all contribute
to his extrication from his difficulties. He
thought again of retrenchment, but he liked it
notgaiety, publicity, and splendour, had be-
come more necessary for him as his life ad-
vanced; and however careless he might be that
the plebeian multitude knew of his difficulties,
he was reluctant to advertise his necessities to
his gay and fashionable acquaintance, though,
perhaps, many of them were very similarly
situated.
His friends, Borrowman and Leppard, who
still imagined that they possessed his confi-
dence, but who had not been let into the secret
of his marriage, volunteered their services to
try what they could do towards persuading
Mr. Graves to use his influence with Lord Fitz-
george.
"But you know," said Leppard, "that the
world very positively asserts that you are ac-
tually married to Emily. I do not know that

52 FITZGEORGE.
you are, or that you are not; but it will be neces-
sary for me to deny it very positively, and from
authority, if Mr. Graves should affirm it to be
so. If, however, you really are married, it is
desirable that I should know it, in order that I
may more easily and dexterously evade the
question. I have never curiously inquired into
your situation, but as I am regarded as in your
confidence, it may be desirable that I should
let the world know that I really am in your
confidence."
"My good friend," replied Fitzgeorge, "it is
perfectly true that you are in my confidence;
and it is but right that, in endeavouring to serve
me, you should have every advantage of being
able to speak of what concerns me from the
very best authority. You have, then, my own
express authority for denying that I am mar-
ried. I declare to you, on my honour, that I
am not married."
"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Leppard,
" and I am very glad to hear it." Leppard
## p. 53 (#65) ##############################################
FITZ GEORGE. 53
spoke truly, he was glad to hear of any thing
which he thought might be advantageous to his
friend Fitzgeorge. Leppard was a better friend
than Fitzgeorge deserved. There was in the
heart of Leppard a spirit of integrity, a feeling
of kindness. His impulses were to generosity
and good humour; he was ever ready and ever
happy to do a service, and much of his own
happiness was in the happiness of others.
Moroseness and stratagem belonged not to
him; he was direct and plain in all his inter-
course with his friends, and he was more likely
to be deceived than capable of deceiving. See-
ing, indeed, how many inconveniences result
from honesty and candour, and how many ad-
vantages are gained from indirectness and stra-
tagem, some minds are almost led to doubt the
truth of the proverb, that honesty is the best
policy. Leppard, however, had the discern-
ment to see farther than merely to present
advantage, and he had strength of mind to
carry him on through a line of active honesty
and real integrity.
## p. 54 (#66) ##############################################
54 FITZG EORGE.
When he and his friend, Borrowman, arrived
at the house of Mr. Graves, they found that very
deep gentleman, engaged with a large party of
Lord Fitzgeorge's tenants, and there was some
discussion going forwards about raising rents.
This was not, indeed, a very pleasant amuse-
ment to any of them; but still it was necessary,
and there was no possibility of evading it. It
happened that Leppard and Borrowman them-
selves were also tenants under Lord Fitzgeorge;
therefore, of course, the discussion interested
them, and they had as good a right to take
part in the discourse as any one there. Mr.
Graves, indeed, did not like to see them, and if
he could have had his will, he would never have
suffered them to join the party. He was aware
that Leppard was confidently looking forward
to fill the place of steward, under the next
Lord Fitzgeorge, and therefore, of course, he
hated him very heartily. He endeavoured,
however, to behave as civilly as he could, and
said to Leppard and Borrowman, "Well, gen-
tlemen, I am very happy to see you; we have
## p. 55 (#67) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 55
been consulting about raising the rents. Our
kind and good landlord has been very liberal
and generous to us, and it does not become us
to take advantage of his liberality; and, as he
is rather straitened for money at present, in
consequence of his liberality to us, I think we
may as well agree to a little advance in the rent
of our several occupations. For my own part,
I am sure I shall have no objection."
Most of the party present applauded Mr.
Graves when he had made this speech, and they
could not but admire, they said, the readiness
which he himself showed to take his part of the
burden. But Leppard was as cunning as Graves
was deep, and replied very readily; "Nobody
can doubt, Mr. Graves, your readiness to agree
to an advance of rent; for of course the more
money Lord Fitzgeorge has to collect from his
tenants, the better your place will be. Now for
my part, I should have no objection to an ad-
vance provided my Lord Fitzgeorge would have
the goodness to take a little thought of his son's
## p. 56 (#68) ##############################################
56 FitzGeoRGE.
affairs, and do something to extricate him from
his present perplexities."
"Indeed," replied Mr. Graves, rather haugh-
tily, but with an effort to appear civil, "I do
not see what business we have with his lord-
ship's disposal of what is his own. And Lord
Fitzgeorge may surely govern his own family
without our assistance. Besides, as to his son's
perplexities, there is a much greater perplexity
into which Augustus Fitzgeorge has brought
himself, I mean his private marriage."
Upon hearing this, all the tenants who were
present stared with astonishment, and many of
them said, "Oh dear, I hope that is not true!"
For they knew that his title to the estate de-
pended somehow or other on his marrying into
a certain family.
Mr. Graves looked very serious, and said,
"I am sorry to say that it is too true." But
Leppard and Borrowman laughed outright, and
affected not to believe it. And the rest of the
tenants said, "These gentlemen must certainly
## p. 57 (#69) ##############################################
FITZ GEORGE. 57
know whether it is true or not, for they are very
intimate with Augustus."
"True, gentleman " replied Leppard. "Do
you ask me whether the report of Fitzgeorge's
marriage is true? I can tell you flatly and
plainly that it is not true."
Mr. Graves looked very knowing, and not at
all put out of countenance, when all the party
directed their eyes to him. Some of the tenants
who were present thought that he did not know
what he had been saying, when he affirmed so
positively that Augustus was actually married;
for the fact is, that Mr. Graves was a terrible
drinker.
Leppard seeing how great an effect this denial
of Fitzgeorge's marriage had produced on the
party, determined to follow it up; and he con-
tinued saying, "Gentlemen, I am as sure that
Augustus Fitzgeorge is not married as I am sure
of my own existence. I pledge you my word of
honour that he is not. Married Why, he is

no more married than my worthy friend, Mr.
Graves is."
Thereat all the party set up a loud laugh at
the expense of Mr. Graves, who was a formal old
bachelor, and did not seem to care a fig for the
ladies. Still, however, Mr. Graves was not
laughed out of countenance; and there might
be seen a lurking smile of confidence in his face
for when he did smile, it was very faintly and
very queerly. All his concern seemed to be to
manage Lord Fitzgeorge's estates, and to drink
his three bottles of wine after dinner.
"Married or not," replied Mr. Graves, "I
can tell you that Lord Fitzgeorge will not pay
any of his son's debts, and will not increase his
allowance. The best way for him to convince
the world that he is not privately married, will
be for him to marry publicly, and then Lord Fitz-
george will do something towards helping him
out of his present scrapes."
Just as the party was breaking up, Mr. Graves

FITZGEORGE. 59
tapped Leppard on the shoulder and said, "I
wish you would stay and give me an opportunity
of having a word or two with you in private."
So Leppard staidfor Mr. Graves did not ask
Borrowman; for though Leppard was no great
favourite with the steward, Borrowman was
more odious by half than his friend and com-
panion.
As soon as they were alone, Mr. Graves be-
gan: "I am quite astonished that a man of
your sense and acuteness should submit to be
made such a tool of as you are by that profligate
fellow, Augustus Fitzgeorge."
"I made a tool of !" said Leppard, with in-
dignation; "pray, sir, what do you mean by
such language?"
"Don't put yourself in a passion," said Mr.
Graves, with all the coolness imaginable; "I
mean what I say. You suffer yourself to be
made a tool of by a profligate and thoughtless
man, who affects to call you his friend, but
never trusts you with any thing. And so he has

really suffered you to suppose that he is not
married to Emily q"
"He has not only suffered me to suppose so,"
replied Leppard, "but he has positively de
clared to me, upon his honour, that he is not
married."
"A fig for his honour!" replied Mr. Graves:
"yes, yes, Mr. Leppard, I am not a man to
make assertions hastily about matters of fact
which I can readily ascertain. He is married, I
tell you; and I can convince you that he is."
So saying, Mr. Graves opened a private
drawer in his desk, and took out a small bundle
of letters tied with red tape, and handing them
to Leppard, said, "Read these." Leppard
took the packet and did as he was bid, reading
them all through with the greatest attention and
with the utmost astonishment; for he knew the
signatures and the hand-writing of them, and
was well assured that there could be no decep-
tion therefor every thing was stated with the
utmost precision and exactness: many of the
## p. 61 (#73) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 61
matters there stated he was personally acquainted
with, and thought that nobody knew of them
but Fitzgeorge and himself.
Returning the packet to Mr. Graves, he said,
" This is indeed most marvellous! but what I
most wonder at is, the readiness with which you
can acquire information of this nature."
"That," replied Graves, " you may wonder
at still; it is a secret known only to Lord Fitz-
george and myself. I shall not reveal it to you.
I do not affect to give you my confidence, as
Augustus Fitzgeorge does; but I can tell you,
that you are as much in my confidence as you
are in his."
Leppard, who was really an amiable man, was
grieved at the thought of this duplicity and
meanness on the part of Fitzgeorge, and re-
solved to reproach him with it.
Many, indeed, had been the mortifications to
which Fitzgeorge had submitted himself actually
by his own fault and folly, which with a little
common prudence he might have avoided. In-

deed, it almost looked as if he had been bent
upon verifying the saying of the philosopher,
that life must have its pains and sorrows. It is
indeed no easy matter to account for these
things; but we do often see, that those persons
whose situation and circumstances would exempt
them from the common trials of life, do, by their
own wilfulness and blindness, bring upon them-
selves severe and bitter trials. This has evidently
been the case with Fitzgeorge, so far as we have
already tracked his course. But of all his mor-
tifications which he had hitherto endured, none
perhaps equalled that which he felt when Lep-
pard reproached him with duplicity and decep-
tion in the matter of his marriage.
"Did you not pledge your word of honour,"
said Leppard, "when you told me that no mar-
riage had taken place? You had a right to be
silent on the subjectyou might have pro-
hibited my questions. You were not compelled
to affect to give me your confidence. You vo-
122
lunteered your own degradation

## p. 63 (#75) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 63
"Degradation" said Fitzgeorge. "You
forget yourself. Do you know whom you are
speaking to ?"
""Tis you that forget yourself," answered
Leppard : "if you had any proper consideration
for yourself, you would never have exposed
yourself to the present indignity of a reproach
from me. Fitzgeorge, I will not insult you with
words; I will leave you to your own reflections,
they will speak more strongly than any lan-
guage of mine can."
Fitzgeorge was about to reply; but shame,
pride, humiliation, greatness, and littleness, for-
bade him to speak. As they feel poverty the
most acutely who are in the richest class in
society, so do they who are among the greatest
feel most keenly the mortifications of littleness.
We have said before, in the course of this narra-
tive, that Fitzgeorge was astonished at himself,
and perplexed to interpret the singularity and
peculiarity of his situation. Here again a source
of wonder sprung up, and he marvelled much
## p. 64 (#76) ##############################################
64 FITZ GEORGE.
that he who had been born to wealth should
suffer poverty; that he who had been born to
honour, should experience the humiliation of
degradation; that he who had been by the acci-
dent of situation a great man, should become, by
his own actions, inscrutably and marvellously
linked one within another, a little mana man
despisedand that he should be forced to sub-
mit to the reproaches of one whom he regarded
as a humble friend, though of his humble friends
the most exalted. Fitzgeorge, however, was
most of all astonished at the unpleasant but un-
doubted truth, that notwithstanding all the care
which he had taken to give himself to pleasure,
wholly and unreservedly to indulgence and
luxury, he should find that after all his life was
more marked by its annoyances than by its en-
joyments. When he began life, he thought
nothing about duns; when he began life and
all around him were paying homage to him, he
never thought that any human tongue should
dare to wag itself disrespectfully against him;
## p. 65 (#77) ##############################################
FITZG EORG E. 65
when he began life and saw around him flatter-
ing and flattered beauty, he never thought of
the weariness of disgust, or the tediousness of
an unreturned and unreturnable fondness. Yet,
notwithstanding all the lessons which experience
was offering to teach him and was perpetually
pressing upon his attention, he refused to learn,
he neglected to observe, and instead of endea-
vouring to solve the moral phenomenon, he per-
severed in the same course. It has been said
that wonder makes a man look old; rather
might one be inclined to say that wonder makes
a man look young, for wonder is the proper
attitude of youth in its first deceptions: the
feeling of wonder ought gradually to abate, and
so it will in all regulated minds; but when any
one, after the manner of Fitzgeorge, gives him-
self solely to sensuality and luxury, he remains
a child during the whole course of his growing,
as he advances in years, more ignorant and more
despicable.

CHAPTER IV.
A NEW FAWOURIT e.
WHEN Fitzgeorge, after many tedious months
of persecution under the name of courtship, had
prevailed on Emily to give her hand to him at
a private altar, he thought, as far as he was
capable of thinking at all, that he was now com-
pletely happy in a companion uniting all that
was interesting and beautiful in the female cha-
racter; he thought not that there should be any
farther wandering of his affection, or any more
aberration of his fancy. But he was wrong.
He forgot the mighty power of contrast, and the
absorbing interest of novelty; he confounded
## p. 67 (#79) ##############################################
FitzGEORGE. 67
intensity of feeling with duration of affection.
It was a pleasant and sweet contrast to the in-
sipidity of Juliet's simplicity, and the too stimu-
lant piquancy of Isabella's boldness and imperti-
nence, to repose on the mild, gentle, graceful,
and well-mannered society of Emily. Her con-
versation not only delighted but instructed him;
he had an intellectual pleasure in such com-
panionship ; and because he was greatly pleased,
he fancied that he should be always pleased.
It was not, however, in his nature to adhere
long to any of the interests of life; neither love nor
friendship had permanent charms for him; and
the reason was, that he was always vainly
striving after impossibilities. He was endea-
vouring to unite what in the nature of things
cannot be united; that is, he was desirous of
having intensity and durability together. At
his first liberation from the restraints of his
minority, he felt a great delight in the liberty
which left him the choice of his actions, his
hours, his associates, his table, and all the in-
## p. 68 (#80) ##############################################
68 FITZG EORG e.
terests of civilized life. Foolishly he expected
that the same pleasure as that which he first
experienced from the contrast, would last
through life, increasing not diminishing; and
though he had been deceived and disappointed
in almost every step that he had taken, he con-
tinued to adhere to the same delusion. It is
true that he was not, nor could he ever become,
so utterly weary of Emily as he had been of
Juliet; for Emily had understanding which
Juliet had not, and Emily had some little power
over him which Juliet had not, and which she
never presumed to aspire after. Juliet would
have echoed his opinion had it changed every
hour, or twice every hour; she could never
think even for herself: but the mind of Emily
was of a far different calibre; she had power of
thought, capacity of expression, understanding
of the ordinary topics of human interest and dis-
cussion. Fitzgeorge also had not been so madly
and so blindly fond of Emily as he had of Ju-
liet. The love which he had for Emily was
## p. 69 (#81) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 69
compounded more of approbation, of esteem, of
admiration, and of intellectual pride, than of
passion or of young romance. The madness of
juvenile passion almost always declines down to
a flat indifference, or a satiated disgust; but a
strong approbation is rather more durable, and
is at all events not readily supplanted by the
opposite feeling. With Fitzgeorge, however,
there was not much permanence even of appro-
bation.
The situation in which Emily was placed by
means of her unacknowledged and unrecogniz-
able marriage with Fitzgeorge, was one of no
small difficulty and awkwardness. It was ne-
cessary that she should be considered as his
wife, it was necessary also that she should not
be considered as his wife. In short, it was ne-
cessary and desirable that every body should
know and that every body should keep the
secret. This situation placed the lady in some
difficulty as to the matter of society, especially
female society. Several, however, there were,
## p. 70 (#82) ##############################################
70 FITZGEORGE.
and those even among the most fastidious as to
life's forms, who gave her the benefit of their
patronage and countenance. Now, could Fitz-
george have contented himself to pass quietly
and temperately on through the journey of life
with the pleasing and intelligent companion to
whom he had thus allied himself, it is possible,
that though life would not have presented to
him precisely that kind of interest and amuse-
ment which in the days of his boyish inexperi-
ence he had anticipated, it would have yielded
a far higher and more satisfactory pleasure than
he otherwise enjoyed by his ready indulgence of
all his passing humours and caprices.
Moral writers have often said that ignorance
and vice are nearly allied. They are right; for
in many instances it is an ignorance of the dan-
ger and the nature of temptation which leads
men to throw themselves into moral danger.
Fitzgeorge was never gratuitously or mischiev-
ously wicked; he was merely devoted with all
his heart and soul to the pursuit of pleasure,
## p. 71 (#83) ##############################################
ritz GEORGE. 71
and was ignorant even of the true theory of
sensuality. In his calculations and anticipations
he was not much more sagacious than the Irish-
man, who was so delighted with the hot rolls
that he had in London, as to take a cargo of
them home to Cork that he might have hot rolls
for breakfast all his life long.
When, therefore, Fitzgeorge introduced to
Emily a female friend and companion, he little
thought that he introduced her as much for his
own sake as for the sake of Emily. It is by no
means favourable to good morals for a man to
study always and only his own humours; but
this had been the constant study of Fitzgeorge.
There was a lady with whose company Emily
seemed to be pleased, and with whose company
Fitzgeorge really was pleased. This lady,
whose name was Jernigan, was a married lady
who had once boasted great beauty, and now
boasted great witwhose address was singularly
pleasing, and whose manners were elegant
enough to attract the admiration of Fitzgeorge.
## p. 72 (#84) ##############################################
72 FITZGEORG e.
As soon as it was made known to this lady that
Fitzgeorge and Emily were desirous of her ac-
quaintance, an introduction took place, and
Fitzgeorge became more and more fascinated the
better he was acquainted with the charms of
Mrs. Jernigan's wit and conversation. There
was certainly a great difference between the
mind of Mrs. Jernigan and the mind of Emily;
the former had wit, vivacity, address, confi-
dence, and a prettily disguised boldness of man-
ner, was by no means gifted with the higher
qualities of the understanding, and was some-
what deficient in that exquisite delicacy and
propriety that so strongly and agreeably marked
the whole deportment of Emily. The difference
between them was, to every observer, decidedly
in favour of Emily; and even Fitzgeorge him-
self would have seen that Emily had the ad-
vantage, if he had seen and observed them both
together, and at the same time; but, unfortu-
nately for the reputation of his taste and judg-
ment, he had been acquainted with Emily pre-

FITZGEORG e. 73
vious to his introduction to Mrs. Jernigan; so
the new acquaintance had over the other the
advantage of novelty, and that was every thing
to Fitzgeorge. If he had been as long ac-
quainted with Mrs. Jernigan as he had with
Emily, and if Emily had been introduced to
him as a new acquaintance, then she would have
supplanted Mrs. Jernigan much sooner than
Mrs. Jernigan supplanted her.
The first symptom or manifestation of the
abatement of the affection of Fitzgeorge for
Emily, was very singularly displayed, and was
inferred from the fact of his giving her more of
his company than he had been accustomed to
give her. It was soon discerned that not Emily,
but her new companion, was the great attrac-
tion. The conversation was chiefly directed to
Mrs. Jernigan, and the suffrage of her approba-
tion was again sought by Fitzgeorge for those
sentiments and decisions on matters of taste
and literature, which had formerly been sub-
mitted to the approval of Emily. Almost all

common-place people, whose minds are fed
upon books and nourished by the accidental
occurrences of life, have a limited range of
ideas, and a set of common notions which pass
in their minds for philosophy, and these they
sport to every new acquaintance as a matter of
profundity and wisdom. Emily had already
heard, applauded, and forgotten Fitzgeorge's
summary of wisdom; it was now repeated, with
slight variations, to Mrs. Jernigan. Emily re-
collected, by the repetition, the manner in which
these things had been said to her, and she found
that they were said nearly in the same manner
to Mrs. Jernigan; and it was naturally guessed
that they were uttered from the same motive, a
desire to surprise, and a wish for applause.
Mrs. Jernigan was more lavish in her compli-
ments than Emily had been, and these made an
impression on Fitzgeorge. He had, indeed,
heard talk of sincerity, but he had met with
very little of it in the course of his life; and
what little he had met with was by no means
## p. 75 (#87) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 75
agreeable, and he did not wish to meet with
any more. He very much preferred flattery
and compliments; these did Mrs. Jernigan ad-
minister in great abundance, and much to Fitz-
george's satisfaction.
Fitzgeorge, it has been said, was musical. A
taste for music was one of his greatest accom
plishments, and if he had not been born to be
a lord, he must have been intended to be a mu-
sician. Those songs which he had once sung
to Emily, he now sung in Emily's hearing to
Mrs. Jernigan, and Emilysuch is the weakness
of the strongest minds, when love and jealousy
are in the questionfancied that he sung them
with an additional and increased interest.
To ascertain whether Fitzgeorge was really
so much attached to Mrs. Jernigan as he ap-
peared to be, Emily used various little strata-
gems, excusable only in one too much ena-
moured to be in possession of a right and sober
judgment. Evenings were appointed for the
three to meet together, and by some manage-

76 FITZ GEORGE.
ment Mrs. Jernigan was sent out of the way,
on which occasions, for there was more than one
such, Fitzgeorge grew soon weary, and abridged
the evening of some of its hours, on pretence of
pressing business. Sometimes it was contrived
that Mrs. Jernigan should make her appearance
when not expected, and then it was uniformly
observed that Fitzgeorge seemed very highly
delighted, and that a change came over his
spirit; then he brightened up, and gave mani-
fest symptoms of being agreeably surprised.
These tokens of attachment to a new favourite
were of course not pleasant to Emily; but they
were not sufficiently marked to produce expos-
tulation or reproach.
Not only was the transfer of affection visible
to Emilyit was also discerned by Mrs. Jerni-
gan herself, who, though not a woman of such
good understanding as Emily, yet had penetra-
tion enough to see that her society was pecu-
liarly acceptable to Fitzgeorge. Her vanity was
too much flattered to allow her to use any
## p. 77 (#89) ##############################################
FITZG EORGE. 77
means to avoid his attentions or to withdraw
from his notice. She gave him, rather, reason to
know that his partiality was flattering to her, and
she took no small pains to retain and establish
the favourable notice with which he regarded
her. She was peculiarly well adapted to ex-
ercise power over him, not so much by the
strength as by the artifice of her character. In
years, she was considerably past the inexperi-
ence and thoughtlessness of youth, and had long
been accustomed to the arts of life. She
managed Fitzgeorge by the most ingenious flat-
tery, the flattery not of words but actions. Her
admiration of him was not of the tongue, but of
the eye; her praises reached him not directly,
but indirectly; and she had artifice enough to
conceal artifice.
Emily dared not, for her own sake, at first
notice the encroachments which this artful wo-
man was making on the affections of Fitzgeorge;
for she had some hope that he would have of
himself sense and discernment enough to see
## p. 78 (#90) ##############################################
78 FITZG EORGE.
through the character of Mrs. Jernigan, and that
he would not suffer himself to be permanently
ensnared by her arts. In this hope, however,
she was disappointed; and it is rather wonderful
that she should not have already known Fitz-
george sufficiently well to be aware of the tran-
sient and selfish nature of his regards.
Day after day, the attachment of Fitzgeorge
to Mrs. Jernigan strengthened, and became
more obvious, till at lengh Emily considered
that it was absolutely imperative on her to
withdraw from the society of him over whose
affections she no longer held an undivided sway.
Yet, why should she reproach him 2 For her
he had deserted others, and now, for another,
he was preparing, perhaps, to desert her. And
perhaps he would not have deserted her. He
did, indeed, show a preference for Mrs. Jerni-
ganan increasing attachment to his new
favourite; but he did not treat Emily with dis-
respect, or rudenesshe listened to her conver-
sation, and was pleased with it, but was more

FITZGEORGE. 79
pleased with that of Mrs. Jernigan. He still
sang duets with Emily, but he seemed to sing
with greater spirit when he sang with Mrs. Jer-
nigan. In matters of taste he had not ceased
to consult Emily, nor did he oppose her deci-
sions frequently; but he consulted more fre-
quently with Mrs. Jernigan, and never appealed
from her judgment to his own. He still ho-
noured Emily with public notice and apparent
deference, but the public began to talk very
loudly about Mrs. Jernigan. And Mr. Jernigan!
where was he all this while 2 Certainly, we live
in a very strange world; yet, why should we
call it strange?it is the only one that we have
yet seen, and it is impossible for us, with any
degree of confidence, to say that they manage
these things better in the moon.
In the lower, or lowest classes, an individual.
situated as Emily, would have been almost, if
not entirely, provoked to double her fist at an
individual situated as was Mrs. Jernigan. There
would have been also a loud and vituperative

80 FITZGEORGE.
declaration of war against Fitzgeorge; there
would have been much anger, and clamour, and
evil-speaking; there would have been no small
share of bouncing, flouncing, sneering, and re-
proaching; there would have been much grand
talk, which would have amounted to nothing,
neither removing the anger which it expressed,
nor healing the grievance which it lamented.
The same feeling existed in the minds of the
parties, but it was differently expressed; it
might, perhaps, have been more deeply felt in
the very calmness of its utterance. Emily, ob-
serving that Fitzgeorge had transferred his
affections to Mrs. Jernigan, and that he was
honouring that lady with attentions and time
which had recently been otherwise disposed of,
ceased to intrude herself, as a third person,
where two seemed to be more pleasant com-
pany; and, in no great length of time, that
very Mrs. Jernigan, who was introduced as a
companion and a friend for Emily, became the
companion and friend of Fitzgeorge. Emily

withdrew herself from the party, and, fortu-
nately for herself, being independent of Fitz-
george, did not sink down into that cheerless-
ness of poverty, and cold neglect, which had
been the fate of Juliet and Isabella.
Now it might have been supposed that Fitz-
george had had sufficient proof of the versatility
and weakness of his own mind, and of his ab-
solute incompetence to rule himself, and manage
the course of his life so as to pass through the
world reputably in the eyes of others and satis-
factorily to himself. He reflected, indeed; but
it was merely to blame life's accidents, not to
reproach and amend his own follies. He laid
the blame of that which was the result of his
own folly and inobservance, on the unavoidable
circumstances and condition of his being; and
with that absurdity which always accompa-
nies the reasonings of a sensualist, while he
thought that the inconveniences which he had
experienced in days past were not owing to
himself, he trusted that, by his own sagacity
E 3

and attention, he should be able to avoid all
such evils and inconveniences for the time to
COIme.
About this time arose another and serious
trouble, manifesting on how slender a thread
hang all the delights and joys of the mere sen-
sualist. It was a calamity to which, in the
hours of dejection and low spirits, he had been
frequently looking forward, but which was too
painful to be contemplated with any steadiness
of attention or definiteness of purpose. Against
it he knew not how to arm himself, and when
it should approach he knew not how to remedy
it. Sad, indeed, are those calamities which the
mind has not patience to endure nor skill to
cure. In a word, Fitzgeorge was growing cor-
pulent. The word "fat" sounded so awfully in
his ears, that he could scarcely bear the contem-
plation of any thing that reminded him of it.
Yet he could not abstain from the pleasures of
the table, nor could he withhold his libations
to Bacchus. Poor man! he had all along been
## p. 83 (#95) ##############################################
FITZG EORGE. 83
aiming after that which he found to be unattain-
able, to gather all life's roses, and to be annoyed
by none of its thorns. He saw his friends and
neighbours, his companions and coevals, spread-
ing out into broader dimensions as time ad-
vanced, and in proportion to their respective
devotions to Ceres and Bacchus; but he forgot
that he was living under the same condition,
and exposed, of course, to the same misfor-
tune.
It is said that, when the fact was first an-
nounced to him by one of his tailors, in the
most guarded and delicate terms, the shock
came upon him like a thunderbolt. He was at
first silent, then incredulous, then in a proxysm
of rage, which frightened the poor tailor almost
out of his wits. The tailor had for some time
suspected the fact, and had endeavoured, by
gradual and very minute enlargement of each
successively formed habiliment, to meet and to
conceal the evil. Not a word had been said
about new measures, not a hint had been thrown

84 FITZGEORGE.
out about any variation in the size of that
graceful figure, which any tailor might have
been proud to adorn; but, in the lapse of time,
it became indispensably necessary that a change
of measures should be adopted. Change of
measures is, indeed, an expression of deep im-
port. It is a serious subject to be contem-
plated by despotic princes, and favourite mini-
sters, who are greater favourites with their
masters than with the people. But change of
measures is an expression, which, falling from
the lips of a tailor on the ears of a dandy, is
awful as thunder, bitter as gall:
"Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell."
"Change of measures!" exclaimed Fitzgeorge,
as soon as the first shock of the announcement
had a little abated, "impossible ! absolutely
impossible ! You never said so before."
"But sir," said the tailor, "I have observed
the necessity for some time, and in cutting out
I have made some little allowance for general
## p. 85 (#97) ##############################################
FITZG EORGE. 85
enlargement of the figure. Give me leave to
convince you."
"Convince me!" cried Fitzgeorge" not all
the powers of earth shall convince me! Sirrah,
you are tired of working for me, and wish to
provoke me to dismiss you. Send in your
bill."
The tailor bowed most reverently, and said
"I have, may it please your worship, a great
many times."
... Fitzgeorge did not hear this last sentence,
but proceeded, saying, or rather muttering to
himself"Enlargement of figure enlargement
of figure | What does the fellow mean?" As
he spoke, he raised himself arrogantly up, per-
pendicularizing the spine, and casting his eyes
downwards towards his toes, and sadly con-
scious that he could see more of his waistcoat
and less of his shoes than he had been accus-
tomed to see in the days of his youth. For
Juliet, Isabella, and Emily, deserted and spurned
one after another, he never raised so deep a

sigh as he did this moment at the thought of
his own enlarged corpulency. This seemed to
be the very climax of his sorrows; having suf-
fered so many afflictions and annoyances in the
course of his life, now to have them all crowned
with fat, was really too much: he could almost
have found in his heart to sit down and cry;
but, upon second thoughts, he considered that
it would be undignified to sit down and cry in
the presence of his tailor, so he let the man :
take his measure. He consoled himself, how-
ever, with the thought that he might be able to
discover some remedy for the dreadful evil; or,
at all events, if he could not reduce himself to
his pristine slenderness, he might be able to
prevent the evil from increasing.
He was observed by Mrs. Jernigan, on the

nounced the fatal intelligence, to be remarkably
dull and low-spirited. He scarcely ate any
dinner. Several of his favourite dishes, cooked
with the utmost accuracy, were sent away un-

touched. The superb Madeira, which formerly
had diffused such a radiant gleam of satisfaction
and delight over his interesting features, now was
neglected; while the thin Bursac, of which he
had been wont to speak so disrespectfully under
the epithet of French small beer, received all
his attention, and he almost wished it to be a
little nearer to vinegar and water than it really
was. Punch, which he used to make for him-
self, and sweeten with a liberality which would
do a West India planter's heart good to see, he
now composed with such a villainous admixture
of water and lemon-juice, that Mrs. Jernigan
was forced to put a little more brandy to it
before she could drink it.
To say the truth, Mrs. Jernigan was not
mightily pleased with these symptoms of de-
jection in Fitzgeorge, for she had a slight sus-
picion that much if not all of this depression of
spirits, accompanied as it was by frequent sigh-
ings and an obvious loss of appetite, might arise
from his regret for the loss of Emily, or from his

remorse on account of his former misdeeds. It
was a difficult and painful thing for her to
make any remark, and yet it seemed rather unkind
in her not to notice the manifest affliction of her
beloved one. She watched his features with
most interested and interesting attention, and
endeavoured to learn by his looks what was the
sorrow that dwelt so oppressively upon his mind.
She observed that he frequently cast his eyes
upon his waistcoat, and that every time he looked
at it he sighed; she suspected, therefore, that
Emily had chosen the pattern of it, or that per-
haps she had tamboured it with her own hands.
Now though Emily had more reason to feel
indignantly against Mrs. Jernigan, than Mrs.
Jernigan had to feel indignantly against Emily,
yet such is the perversity of human nature, or
such was the evil spirit of Mrs. Jernigan, that
she felt at that moment a most malignant hosti-
lity against Emily. Provoked, therefore, perad-
venture more by jealousy than by sympathy,
Mrs. Jernigan at length said, "I fear that you

are unwell, Fitzgeorge; you have neglected your
favourite dishes, you have despised your favourite
wines, and you have spoiled the punch."
Fitzgeorge sighed, and for a while made no
reply; he kept still looking at his waistcoat, till
Mrs. Jernigan wished it behind the fire, and fully
resolved that it should be there at some oppor-
tunity. At length, lifting up his eyes from his
waistcoat and directing them full at Mrs. Jerni-
gan, he said, "Can you not guess? do you not
see ?"
"Guess what? See what?" replied Mrs.
Jernigan.
At length he could contain his grief and fury
no longer, and throwing off all self-command,
he exclaimed, "Curse it, Mrs. Jernigan, I am
growing fat!

CHAPTER V.
MANY MOR.TIFICATIONS.
IT is not always and to every one a source of
uneasiness that they are growing fat. Many
of the human species would be mightily glad to
have wherewithal to make them fat; but they
go on from day to day with their potations and
slender diet, preserving an elegant slenderness
of form of which they are by no means proud,
and for which they are far from being grateful.
It is very markworthy that what to some persons
is the cause of grief would be to others a means
of joy. A pleasant story to that effect is told of
## p. 91 (#103) #############################################
FITZGEORGE. 91
an alderman of the city of Dublin, who, walking
home inconveniently oppressed by a too copious
civic dinner, was met and accosted by a
clamorous female beggar, who attempted to
move his compassion by stating that she had
not tasted food for two days, accompanying her
statement with a copious torrent of tears and a
suitable howl of lamentation. "Hold your noise,
you discontented baggage," said the alderman;
"why, I would give fifty pounds to have such
an appetite as you have." In like manner, per-
haps, had a poor half-starved shadow of a men-
dicant appealed to the charity of Fitzgeorge at
this time, and stated the fact that for want of
proper nourishment he was wasting away to a
shadow, Fitzgeorge would have envied theman's
slenderness of form far more than he would
have pitied his emptiness of stomach.
Nature kindly arranges for us that the ob-
jectionables of life should come upon us gradu-
ally: we do not lose our hair all at once; our
locks do not pass from auburn to gray in twenty-

four hours; our spine does not at once lose its
perpendicularity; we are not young men to-day
and old men to-morrow; we are not thin as laths
one hour and fat as porpuses the next. But all
these things come upon us by degrees. What-
ever evil there may be in the sensation and strong
perception of the change, we make for ourselves
by an obstinate and wilful blindness to the first
approach of it. So it was with Fitzgeorge. He
might have perceived long ago that he was
growing fat; but he was wilfully blind to an
obvious fact that was daily staring him in the
face; and when at last he could no longer resist
the overwhelming evidence of the fact, it rushed
upon him with a force that was too much for
him, and that overset his propriety.
Many persons situated as Fitzgeorge was,
under this afflictive visitation of corpulency,
would have given up in despair those am-
bitions which are only to be gratified by
youth and slenderness of form; but not so was
it with him. He could not correct his corpu-

lency, but he endeavoured to conceal ita very
difficult task indeed. To conceal defects is com-
paratively easy; but to conceal redundancies is
next to impossible. The devil may manage to
bury his cloven foot in a Wellington boot; but
there is no waistcoat that can disguise the cor-
pulency of a Falstaff. Fitzgeorge might have
known this factperhaps he did; but when
passion is concerned, and there is a strong feel-
ing of self-love in the mind, it is really asto-
nishing how wilfully blind men can be. To
conceal, disguise, or embellish his but too ma-
nifest corpulency, Fitzgeorge called a council of
tailors. Not Tiberius, when he assembled the.
Roman Senate to consult about the construction
of a fish-kettlenot the wise men of Gotham,

parishioners of Coggeshall, when they sur-
rounded the town with hurdles to keep out the

the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge, when he
and his tailors were met in conclave, laying

their wits together to contrive to make a middle-
aged man, in a state of incipient corpulency,
look like a slender youth just out of his teens.
Various were the proposals, and various were
the conjecturesvarious were the patterns dis-
played and the forms suggested; their only point
of unanimity was, the exquisite beauty of Fitz-
george's present formso peculiarly well calcu-
lated to set off to advantage any mode of dress
which his exhaustless invention and accurate
taste might suggest. But there was too much
waistcoat:-no remedy could be suggested for
that evil, till some genius brighter than the rest
perhaps the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge himself
remarked, that as the waistcoat could not con-
veniently be curtailed in one direction, it might
be abridged in anotherwhile it necessarily pre-
served its latitude, it might be abbreviated in its
longitude. That was at least some relief. Fur-
thermore, it was especially understood among
the friends and acquaintance of Fitzgeorge, that
he was not to be considered as being corpulent
## p. 95 (#107) #############################################
FITZGEORGE. 95
the word "fat" was never on any account to be
mentioned in his hearingnor was there to be any
allusion whatever to waistcoats; moreover, it was
understood that they who should dine at Fitz-
george'stable would confer a favour if they would
appear as nearly as possible of his size. All these
things, however, were merely palliatives. There
was now no longer a doubt in the mind of Fitz-
george himself that he was growing fat; and
to what abominable excess of bulk he might
reach, no conjecture could be formed. To deny
himself the pleasures of the table was a hard
sacrifice, and he thought every time he opened
his mouth for the purpose of eating, that he felt
the pinguescent process going on with a most
provoking pertinacity and rapidity. Thus ab-
solutely impossible is it to seek out sources of
satisfaction, without at the same time exposing
the mind to annoyance and uneasiness; for had
Fitzgeorge derived no peculiar pleasure from,
and taken no exceeding delight in, the graceful
slenderness of his form, he would have felt no

96 FITZ GEORGE.
great uneasiness in the accumulation of size;
but the joy of his slenderness was counterba-
lanced by the grief of his corpulency; and this
additional grief there was, that while he was
slender there were apprehensions of fatness,
and that when he became fat there were little or
no hopes of any after-slenderness. A melan-
choly condition is this of our being, which the
sensualist most deeply feels, that our joys are
imbittered by the fear of sorrow, and that our
sorrows are not alleviated by any hopes of joy.
He was now driven a little to philosophise
and he philosophised not to cure himself of sen-
suality and selfishness, but rather to perfect
himself in physical enjoyment. He read Cicero's
treatise on Old Agenot that he thought him-
self oldbut to arm himself against the terrors
of age, should he ever be exposed to such a
calamity. Leppard, whose good-nature had
forgiven the deception which Fitzgeorge had
practised upon him, now joined him in his phi-
losophical talk and reading. .
## p. 97 (#109) #############################################
FITZGEORGE. 97
"I have been reading again Cicero's Treatise
on Old Age," said Fitzgeorge.
"What can you have to do with a Treatise
on Old Age" said Leppard; "you are yet but
in the greenness of youth."
"It is well," said Fitzgeorge, "to provide for
the worst.But what is your serious opinion of
the soundness of Cicero's arguments? We had
some talk on the subject many years ago, when
we were younger than we are now."
"Very likely," replied Leppard, "we talked
nonsense on the subject. But I dare say that
I then told you that I was an admirer of Cicero.
I always have been, and always shall be. For
a philosopher, I never read a writer more tho-
roughly intelligible."
"He is intelligible as a writer," said Fitz-
george;"is he convincing as a reasoner?
What can be a man's motive for writing to con-
tradict universal experience and the general
sense of mankind 7"

"Does he attempt to do so?" replied Lep-
ard; " or attempting, does he succeed?"
"Does he not attempt it," rejoined Fitz-
george, "when he aims to prove that old age
and death, which all men are unanimous in re-
garding as evils, are no evils?"
"But does he prove it? For if he proves his
point, he proves that mankind have been and
are still in the wrong for apprehending that to
be an evil which is no evil."
"He appears to prove his point," said Fitz-
george; "but is it not the universal sentiment
of mankind that youth is preferable to age 2 Are
there not joys in youth which age has not? And
are there not cares in age which youth has not?"
"So it is usually said," replied Leppard;
"but is there really truth in the saying? Do
the young always find in youth an abundance
of those joys which are said to belong to youth 2
Are the joys of youth, even supposing them to
be possessed, never attended or followed by
counterbalancing evils and corresponding cares?"
## p. 99 (#111) #############################################
FITZGEORGE. 99
Fitzgeorge sighed, and looked at his waist-
coat, and said, "It is certainly very true that
there are cares even in youth which we do not
expect."
"And may there not also be joys in age
which we do not expect?"
"There may, but I can scarcely imagine what
they are."
"Perhaps not," replied Leppard; "we know
something of youth by experience, but we know
nothing of age. Have we not found that youth
has disappointed us?"
"So I am compelled to say that I have," re-
plied Fitzgeorge.
"And are we not quite as likely to find that
age will disappoint us?" said Leppard; " for
as youth brings cares which we did not antici-
pate, so may age bring pleasures for which we
are not looking, and may disappoint us of many
of those annoyances to which we expected it to
expose us."
"Why, Leppard, you are as bad as Cicero,"

100 FITZGEORGE.
replied Fitzgeorge, "you attempt to reason me
out of my senses."
" Nay, to reason you into your senses."
"But your reasoning goes to contradict ge-
neral experience."
"Is it general experience that youth is all
joy, and age all sorrow and care 3''
Not exactly so," replied Fitzgeorge; "but
there are many who enjoy youth heartily and
amply."
"And the very same persons, in all proba-
bility, will enjoy age as much," replied Leppard.
At this moment Borrowman was announced.
"You look serious," said Fitzgeorge to him as
he entered the room.
"I ought to look serious," replied Borrow-
man, "for it is my business to announce to you
the fact, that your father is taken seriously ill;
so ill, indeed, that he is totally incapable of
attending to business."
"Dangerously ill?" asked Fitzgeorge.
"His medical attendants have not yet pro-

nounced the complaint dangerous or otherwise.
All that I am commissioned to announce is, that
he is too unwell to attend to business, and that
it is highly probable that some considerable
time may elapse before he is able to attend to
business again." -
"And do you know whether there is much
business that requires his immediate attention?"
"I believe," replied Borrowman, "that there
is a very great deal. Some new leases are to be
granted, and some fines are to be fixed; and I
hear from one of Mr. Graves's clerks, that it is
the intention of Lady Fitzgeorge and him to
take upon themselves the sole management of
the estate."
"Without consulting me, or taking me at all
into account?" said Fitzgeorge, somewhat
angrily.
"That is the report among the tenants," re-
plied Borrowman.
"I also am one of the tenants," said Leppard,
" and I shall represent to Mr. Graves, that un-

less he suffers the heir to have a hand in the
management of the estate, I shall be not a little
inclined to demur about paying my rent. That
fellow Graves, by virtue of making himself a
slave to Lord and Lady Fitzgeorge, makes him-
self almost master of the estate."
"But it shall not be, if I can prevent it,"
said Fitzgeorge; "I begin to think that the
man intends, by some legal trickery or other,
to get possession of the estate for himself."
"Here you see," replied Leppard, " some of
the unanticipated evils to which youth is sub-
ject." -
"I see," said Fitzgeorge, "that I am per-
petually and incessantly surrounded by some
annoyances or other; I no sooner get rid of one
perplexity, than another rises up. It would be
enough to make any ordinary pursuer of happi-
ness despair of attaining his object, but I will
not give up the pursuit."
It is possible that Fitzgeorge had some slight
hopes and some undefinable anticipations of
## p. 103 (#115) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 103
soon succeeding to the title and estates, for in
all his thoughts of enjoyment he was looking
forward to the time when, having in his hand
the power and the resources of the Fitzgeorge
estates, he should be able to indulge his fancy
to the utmost extravagance of its desires.
According to his promise, Leppard went to
the office of Mr. Graves, and made inquiry into
the state of Lord Fitzgeorge's health, and asked
some questions as to the management of his
lordship's affairs during his illness. But to all
inquiries Mr. Graves returned mighty short an-
swers, and in such a snappish and consequential
manner, as much as to say, "I am master now."
Leppard, however, was not aman to be frightened
or put off his pursuit by such a fellow as Graves;
so he went on to say, "I tell you what, Mr.
Graves, I don't care a fig for your mysterious
airs and shrugs, and all that sort of thing, I am
a plain, straightforward kind of man, and all I
want is a plain answer to a plain question. I
want to know, in a word, whether you and Lady
## p. 104 (#116) ############################################
104 FITZGEORG, E.
Fitzgeorge intend to manage the estate, during
the illness of Lord Fitzgeorge, without once
consulting with the young gentleman his heir 7"
"Upon my word, Mr. Leppard, I don't see
what business you have to be asking me any
such questions; I know my business, and you
know yours. After all, let me tell you, that, in
my humble opinion, you are doing yourself no
good in keeping company with such a young
scapegrace. Though, by the way, he is not
over-young now, notwithstanding all the tricks
he plays to make himself look young."
"I admire your impudence, Master Graves,"
replied Leppard, "to talk in that way about
your young master, as if he cared what you
thought about his looks."
"Young master indeed!" answered Mr.
Graves; "no, no, he is no master of mine, and
never will be."
"Ay, ay, there you are right enough," said
Leppard, "he never will be your master; for
when he comes to the title and estate he will

FITZGEORGE. 105
send you about your business, and recommend
you to provide for yourself elsewhere than about
him. You have made pretty work with the
estate. Why it is not worth half so much as it
was when it first came into your management."
"Come, Mr. Leppard," replied Graves, "keep
a civil tongue in your head; and recollect that
one mend-fault is worth ten find-faults. You
are mighty conceited, forsooth, about manage-
ment; I should just like to see how much better
you could manage things, now you come to
that."
"Perhaps you may some of these days," re-
plied Leppard, "and sooner mayhap than you
wish or expect; and then you shall see what
you have not seen for many a day. You are no
more fit to manage an estate than you are to
drive the chariot of the sun. You will bring
every thing to wreck and ruin."
"Ay," replied Mr. Graves with one of his ill-
natured sneers, "I suppose you learn your no-

tions of management from that precious babe
Augustus Fitzgeorge. He is a capital manager
indeed! Do you know the amount of his debts?
A very pretty sum they amount to. So much
for management."
"Well, he does not owe you any thing," re-
plied Leppard.
"And I'll take pretty good care not to trust
him."
"Because you have got nothing to trust him
with. But come, I cannot be wasting all my
time here, I want to know once for all whether
the old lady and you intend to let the young
gentleman have anything to do with the manage-
ment of the estate during his father's illness?"
"Why now, Mr. Leppard, as to the matter of
that, I should just like to know how it can con-
cern you."
"It concerns me," replied Leppard, "merely
so far as a matter of justice and right."
"There is no justice or right about the mat-
ter; the estate belongs to his father, and while

it is his father's, Augustus has no more right
over it than you have."
"A very pretty doctrine, forsooth ! and sup-
pose the old gentleman should die, whose would
it be then 7
"Why then, of course, it would come into the
possession of the young gentleman; but the old
gentleman, as you are pleased to call his lord-
ship, is not dead yet; no, nor likely to die in a
hurry. And so long as he lives he has a right
to the estate and to the management of it by
himself or his accredited agents."
"And pray, sir," said Leppard, "who do you
call his accredited agents?"
"Myself, to be sure, for one," replied Mr.
Graves.
"So I conjectured," replied Leppard; "and
so you will have the consummate impudence, in
the face of all the world, to use your influence
to keep the heir of Lord Fitzgeorge out of all
management of the estates which naturally and
of right, in case of his father's decease, must

devolve on him. I never in the whole course of
my life witnessed such consummate impudence.
and effrontery."
"Ah! 'tis all very well for you to make a
matter of marvel and astonishment at it, but
you know better. You have done the best for
your client, but his case is a bad one; he has
not a leg to stand on. Besides, my good sir,
you need not make all this fuss about the mat-
ter, for I dare say that his lordship will soon be
well enough to attend to his own business, and
then he will not want any assistance. All that
Augustus Fitzgeorge is aiming at is to get the
money into his own hands and spend it on his
own extravagant humours. A pretty pass things
will come to when he gets the estate into his
own hands ! Well, I hope I shall never live to
see that day."
So when Leppard found that he could make
nothing of Mr. Graves he went back to Fitz-
george and told him all that had passed, and
Fitzgeorge was highly mortified at it. How-
## p. 109 (#121) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 109
ever, as a dutiful son, he wrote a very respectful
letter to his mother, to inform her that having
heard of his father's illness, he was very much
concerned at it, and that forgetting all slights
that he had received from home he should hasten
immediately to pay his respects, and to offer
every assistance and all sympathy in his power.
Now as Lady Fitzgeorge knew that copies of
this letter had been shown to many persons, it
was impossible for her not to send back a polite
answer, and to accept the offer of a visit. He
went accordingly, and was received by his mo-
ther with all appearance of cordiality, but he was
not permitted to see his father. His mother
pretended to refer him to the medical attendants
as to whether it would be proper or not that he
should see the patient. The doctors, who had
been tutored by his mother, were of opinion that
it would be highly improper in his lordship's
present state of nervous irritability that any one,
so near and dear to him as his eldest son, should
be permitted to see him. The doctors knew

very well that his son was not very dear to him,
but they merely said what Lady Fitzgeorge had
put into their mouths.
As for the management of the estate, it was
absurd to suppose that any assistance was re-
quired; for Lady Fitzgeorge and Mr. Graves
generally had everything their own way, except-
ing, perhaps, some trifling matters which his
lordship insisted on having exactly according to
his own humour. Augustus, however, remained
in the house, though he was not permitted to
see his father; and while he did remain there
abundant evidence was afforded of the light
esteem in which he was held. He was scarcely
ever consulted about anything, all matters were
arranged by Lady Fitzgeorge and Mr. Graves;
and this arrogant steward seemed almost to take
pains to treat Augustus with studied insolence.
It was of course exceedingly mortifying to him
that the very domestic servants should see with
what contempt and disrespect he was treated in
his father's own house. There, however, he

still remained, that he might see how matters
were going on.
Great pains were taken to make it appear
that Lord Fitzgeorge would soon be able to at-
tend to business, but that he was still not well
enough to see his son. Augustus, of course, saw
through all this, and though mortified, was not
altogether sorryfor it gave him, in the eyes of
the world, the appearance of having been ill-
used. It is a sad thing to be very ill-used, no
doubt; and some persons seem rather partial to
being ill-used, seeing that they take such great
pains to blazon their ill-usage to the world.
Pity is generally a worthless and humiliating
sort of thing; nevertheless, there are few per-
sons who are not in some degree enamoured of
it, and desirous of obtaining more than their
fair share of it. A very entertaining treatise
might be drawn up concerning the various con-
trivances of men for obtaining pity under false
pretences.

trivance on the part of Mr. Graves and Lady
Fitzgeorge to keep Augustus away from his fa-
ther's presence, and to prevent him from having
access to any of his father's books, so as to have
any knowledge of the management or misma-
nagement of affairs, Lord Fitzgeorge recovered
from his illness, and was pronounced by the
medical men capable of attending to busi-
ness. And now, of course, Fitzgeorge sup-
posed that there could be no longer any pre-
tence for keeping him away from his father;
but he was in error; for now the medical at-
tendants were of opinion that his lordship would
not be able to undergo the fatigue, and as he
had many matters of an indispensable nature to
attend to, it would be better to avoid, for the
present at least, all needless agitation and ex-
citation, confining himself solely to matters of
business, and transacting them in the quietest
possible way. So Fitzgeorge departed at last
without seeing his father, having been by his
mother and Mr. Graves treated with the greatest

coolness and disrespect. Some people went so
far as to say, that the illness of Lord Fitzgeorge
had been in a great measure occasioned by his
son's irregular conduct; nobody, however, dared
to say, that many of the irregularities of Au-
gustus Fitzgeorge were occasioned by the un-
natural conduct of Lord Fitzgeorge.

CHAPTER VI.
PROPOSALS FOR MARRIAGE.
It is possible that Lord Fitzgeorge would not
receive the congratulations of his son, on reco-
vering from his illness, lest, in the civilities and
cordialities which must necessarily pass on such
an occasion, there might be some relentings and
forgivings, which might lead to a thought or
hint about giving as well as forgiving; for his
lordship was so bent on having his son married,
that he would hear of no compromise, and
would admit of no approaches to reconciliation,
without first having this preliminary settled.
Having, indeed, seen so much of his son's un-

steadiness of affection and heartless caprice, it.
was no very benevolent wish of the old gentle-
man to desire to see him married; for if he
could not long be faithful to a person of his
own choice, it was not likely that he could be
so to one who was the choice of another. Lord
Fitzgeorge himself was, indeed, a remarkable
instance of conjugal fidelity to a partner not ex-
ceedingly attractive, and not chosen by himself;
but it was by many believed that obstinacy was
the basis of his fidelity. The young Fitzgeorge
was also obstinate, but his obstinacy was mani-
fested in following his caprices wherever they
might chance to lead him. But it is a difficult
matter to give a philosophical account of all the
vagaries of a crotchety mind.
Now Fitzgeorge's troubles in the shape of
duns, debts, difficulties, and embarrassments
came upon him thicker and stronger than ever.
He tried, but in vain, to ascertain the amount of
his engagements, and whether there was any pro-
bability of his being able, by any contrivance

whatever, to meet and liquidate them. All was
confusion and perplexity. Of his accounts, even
with the assistance of an exact and methodical
steward, he could make neither head nor tail;
and when told of the amount of his debts in
what are called round numbers, he uttered
many oathsso many as to frighten and shock
his worthy steward, who was a quiet and well-
meaning man.
But Fitzgeorge's anger at the amount of his
debts was chiefly occasioned by the apprehension
that he must now, perforce, be driven into the
net of matrimony, which his father had so long
been spreading for him. There was now no re-
treatno escape; in such case, nine persons
out of ten would have made a virtue of neces-
sity, and would have yielded with a good grace;
but Fitzgeorge was resolved to hold out the
siege to the utmost. Provoking, indeed, was it
to think, that notwithstanding all his cares,
anxieties, and agitations, which were enough to
waste some persons to a shadow, he still con-

tinued to increase in corpulency. The very fret-
ting, which would have been the diminution of
another's size, was the means of increasing his.
Here, then, was a twofold trouble, matrimony
and fat. Tailors, who were among the most in-
teresting objects of his contemplation, now be-
came almost painful to think of, from the thought
of new measures which were invariably connected
with their names. Not all the charms of Mrs.
Jernigan's conversationnot all the dexterity of
his ingenious tailorsnot all the profound skill
of his cooksnot all the flatteries of his friends,
could divert his mind from sad thoughts, or
disperse the gloom that hung on his brow.
One morning, after he had been in close but
useless consultation with his steward, Mr. Graves
came to him with a message from Lord Fitz-
george.
"The everlasting topic, I suppose," said Fitz-
george, as soon as Mr. Graves announced that
he was charged with a message from Lord Fitz-
george.
## p. 118 (#132) ############################################
118 FITZGEORGE.
"It is in your power, sir," replied Mr. Graves,
" to put a stop to messages of this kind."
"It is in my power to put an end to all an-
noyances by blowing my brains out."
"Which would be a very foolish action," said
Mr. Graves.
"I have the same opinion of matrimony," said
Augustus Fitzgeorge.
"But what opinion have you, sir," asked Mr.
Graves, in a very significant tone, " of duns,
debts, and difficulties everlasting? Will you
consent to your honoured father's proposal, or
will you go on for ever in this miserable make-
shift style?"
Fitzgeorge was fretted and annoyed. Duns
were bad enough, but Mr. Graves was worse;
debts hampered him, but matrimony would
hamper him still more. It was disagreeable to
be thus schooled by his father's servant: he
could not brook it, but he must not scornfully
repel it. He was silent for a while, as if weigh-
ing the proposal in his mind. His deliberation

took a turn towards compliance, and at length,
with tolerable composure, he said, "To whom
does my father design to marry me?""To
your accomplished cousin, the Lady Louisa,"
replied Mr. Graves, with just such an air as if
he was communicating the most delightful in-
formation imaginable.
"My accomplished cousin!" Fitzgeorge be-
gan to say, but proceeded no farther, checking
himself, and restraining the scornfulness with
which he was beginning to speakfor he would
not display his disrespect in the presence of Mr.
Graves. In another tone, then, after a short
interval, he added, "I will take the matter into
my most serious consideration, and will com-
municate with my father by letter on the subject."
Different persons have different ideas of seri-
ousness. By way of taking the matter seriously
into his consideration, Fitzgeorge said, laugh-
ingly, to Mrs. Jernigan, "So my worthy friend
Graves has been with me this morning, singing
his old song, croaking his old note of matri-

mony. And who is the happy bride to be,
but my most accomplished cousin, the Lady
Louisa ''
The grimace and the tone with which this
speech was uttered, so exceedingly diverted
Mrs. Jernigan, that she broke out into a violent
fit of laughter, and Fitzgeorge joined in the
noisy mockery. When the loud laughter was
abated, Mrs. Jernigan, with a pretty affectation,
said, "Many happy years to you both !"
"Happy years " cried Fitzgeorge; "it will
be next to a miracle if we live together two
months Years The very mention of years,
in connexion with the name of my cousin .
Louisa, is most horrible. Oh! why is a man not
allowed to marry his grandmother? Then there
would be some chance of liberation in a reason-
able time."
"And what is to be the bribe 7"
"My debts are to be paid."
"Is that all? Really, with such an incum-
brnce as your accomplished cousin, you have

a right to expect something more than a nega-
tive dowery. You may, in time, get used to your
debts, and not care for them, but you will
never be reconciled to pass all your days in the
company of your wife."
"As you love me, I charge you not to utter
the word 'wife' in my hearing."
"I think," replied Mrs. Jernigan, "that the
name of your wife will be more unpleasant to
my ear than to yours."
"On what ground, my good lady," asked
Fitzgeorge.
"I shall be jealous of her," replied Mrs. Jer-
nigan.
Thereupon Mrs. Jernigan and the Honour-
able Augustus Fitzgeorge set up a loud laugh.
"Jealous, indeed ; and so you are not afraid
that my cousin-wife should be jealous of you?"
said Fitzgeorge.
"Seriously, Augustus," said Mrs. Jernigan,
"you are most cruelly used, that you can only

get rid of your debts by marrying such a crea-

Fitzgeorge sighed, and said "We must make
the best of it. It will be something to get rid
of my debts."
"It will be something more to get rid of your
wife," replied Mrs. Jernigan.
"An incumbrance of which, perhaps, I may
more easily rid myself, than I can of my debts.
I may quarrel with my debts, but that will not
part us; but quarrelling with my wife may lead
to a separation."
"But suppose that she should be so meek
and gentle, so amiable, that she will not quarrel
with you. Two parties, you know, are necessary
to a quarrel."
"Let her be as amiable, meek, and gentle as
she may, I trust that I shall be able to provoke
her; and I shall not want partisans, who will
windicate and pity me. It is very diverting to
trick the world of its pity, and, at the same
time to laugh at its simplicity."
## p. 123 (#139) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 123
When Fitzgeorge was alone, the thought of
the world's simplicity, in giving its pity where
it was not needed, came back to his recollection,
and he said to himself, "How little, indeed,
do we know how to apportion or dispose our
pity! We look on human society, in its various
combinations and modifications, and think that
there is nothing to pity where there are smiles,
and nothing to envy where there are tears. Of
tears, I know but little. In the young hypo-
crisy of my earlier days, I shed some few, but
there was no sorrow in them. Of smiles I
know much; and I know how empty and un-
meaning they are. I am looked upon as a man
of pleasure, as the mark and model of elegance,
as an envied and enviable being; and I know
that when all around have been looking upon me
with envy, I have had more reason to envy
them. The eye knows not when to pity and
when to envy. I have hitherto been disap-
pointed, in a great measure, of much that I an-
ticipated; and I would not willingly let the

world know how deeply I have felt the disap-
pointment. Is the disappointment the result of
my own misconduct, or imprudence, or does it
spring from circumstances over which I have
no control '! There is a mystery in life which
I cannot solve. I would not be otherwise than
what I am; yet as I am, I feel not the happi-
mess which I had anticipated. This marriage
tooto a being for whom I care nothing, with
whom I have no sympathiesto whom I shall
never seek, or desire to form an attachment ' I
have an instinct of disgust against her. I shall
be driven to an almost painful hypocrisy to
conceal my repugnance at the very altar. There
must be the appearance of civility on my
part, and I must endeavour to manage so, that
the blame of all subsequent quarrel, or separa-
tion, shall fall upon her. Ah! I have now a
most difficult game to play. I could make the
world believe that my father persecuted me,
and used me harshly; but I must not complain
to the world that my wife uses me cruelly; it

will never do to set up the lamentation of a hen-
pecked husband. I must play some other game,
in which my ingenious friend, Mrs. Jernigan,
can assist me."
Fitzgeorge's soliloquy was interrupted by an
opportune visit from Borrowman.
"Ever welcome, but now most welcome.
"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now."
Borrowman smiled and replied"I am quite
at your service, to shed as many tears as you
can wish me to shed."
"But listen to my sad story."
"Oh, no, pray don't tell me a sad story. I
am ready enough to shed tears, but I hate sad
stories."
"But my story is no joke," said Fitzgeorge.
"I am sorry for it," replied Borrowman, "for
if it were a joke I could listen to it with all my
heart."
"Seriously, my dear Borrowman," said Fitz-
george, "I am under sentence of marriage."
## p. 126 (#142) ############################################
126 FITZ GEORGE.
"Without benefit of clergy?"
"Not exactly so, I rather wish it were."
"So you will at last submit. You have a
fine wholesome example before you, in the do-
mestic bliss of your most honoured parents."
"I am inclined to suppose," replied Fitzgeorge,
" that this will be more of a contrast than an
example. You cannot imagine, Borrowman,
how nauseously the phrase, domestic bliss,
sounds in my ear. It reminds me of stupidity,
vapours, ennui, blue devils, and yawning. But
how shall I be able to get rid of the incum-
brance without losing my character? There is
such a chivalrous spirit in the world, that if a
man quarrels with his wife, every body takes
part with the injured lady "
"Yes," replied Borrowman, "but that very
much depends on the previous popularity of the
gentleman. You will always have friends to
keep you in countenance, and defend you in any
crotchet. Besides, if I may make bold to ask
such a question, of what description is the bride
elect?"
## p. 127 (#143) ############################################
FITZGEORGE, 127
"Vulgar."
"Enough. The day is yours. Marry her as
soon as you please. Dismiss her, if you will,
in the first week of the honeymoon. There is
no sympathy with vulgarity. Is she pretty ?"
" No."
"Better still. Chivalry never troubles itself
about any of the fair sex who boast of no
beauty. Of course, your debts will be paid,
and your allowance from hence will be a little
enlarged; and as for your incumbrance, that
will not be an incumbrance long."
"You treat the matter lightly, Borrowman."
"So will you, when you are married. You
know, as well as I can tell you, that morality,
piety, decency, delicacy, all the virtues, in fact,
are as nothing in the scale against fashion. Be
the fashion, and you may be what else you
please. Let it once be pronounced vulgar to
take part with your wife against you, and then
you may do as you will. You may send her
home to her friends, you may lock her up in a
dungeonyou may accuse her of of "

128 FITZGEORGE.
"Well, sir," said Fitzgeorge to Borrowman,
rather impatiently  "I may accuse her of
What?"
"Of witchcraft, if you please," replied Bor-
rowman, "any thing will be believed against
her, if it be the fashion to take your part, and
so it will be so long as you dress so superbly,
, bow so gracefully, and give such elegant din-
ners."
"You quite revive my spirits; I think now,
that the calamity is really not quite so great as
it appeared at first."
"The calamity is none," replied Borrowman,
"only manage the matter with common dexte-
rity, and you will find no annoyance in your mar-
riage. In short, let all the world know that you
are married against your inclination, and they
will pity you a priori, and, of course, as they
pity you they will hate your wife. You are in
no danger indeed."
Fitzgeorge thought Borrowman to be a very
clever fellow.

CHAPTER VI.
A PUBLIC MARRIAGE.
ALL the newspapers advertised to the gaping
world the important and interesting fact that
the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge was about to lead
to the altar the lovely, the amiable, the accom-
plished, and all that sort of thing, Lady Louisa,
though they who wrote the paragraphs knew
nothing about the amiableness, the loveliness,
or the accomplishments of the lady in question,
and they who read the paragraphs cared as little
as they who wrote them knew. It is a mar-
vellously clever contrivance of newspaper people
to persuade their readers that the paragraphs
till a
H is

130 FITZGEORGE,
contained in these said newspapers are interest-
ing; hence, when one who manufactures a news-
paper has any fact to communicate to the pub-
lic, he must enlarge, exaggerate, and dilate upon
this fact till he swells it up into a matter of
mighty moment. A murder is nothing if it be not
horrible and most atrocious; and a fire cannot be
interesting to the world unless it be represented
under the poetic designation of the devouring
element: thieves and housebreakers are all per-
petrators and miscreants; and the whole of our
daily intellectual food is exaggeration and won-
derment. It is really wonderful that mankind
have not left off wondering; but perhaps they
have been so much accustomed to wonder, that
they cannot now leave it off.
Of course all the world was interested in the
marriage of the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge to
the all-accomplished Lady Louisa, or, at all
events, the newspapers said that they were, and
of course they believed what the newspapers
said. But in the best-informed circles, as they
## p. 131 (#147) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 131
are called, that is, amongst those who have no-
thing to do but to prate about that which is
no business of theirs, whispers were actively cir-
culated, that the bride elect was a woman of
very coarse manners, of rustic habits, of marvel-
lous ignorance, and altogether an unfit com-
panion for so graceful and so accomplished a
gentleman as Fitzgeorge. The bridegroom was
pitied by anticipation. It was as clear as day-
light that Lady Louisa would not divide with
Fitzgeorge the empire of fashion. They who
had not even seen, and who, till this moment,
had scarcely heard of the lady, now pronounced
peremptorily concerning her unfitness to shine
in the same orbit with the gay and graceful
Fitzgeorge.
Some marriages there are which, commencing
in an outrageous and passionate fondness, either
sink down into a flat indifference and wearying
companionship, or the excessive sweet turns acid,
and they who once thought it impossible to live
asunder, soon find it impossible to live together.
## p. 132 (#148) ############################################
132 FITZGEORGE.
Such is the frailty of humanity, that the fairest
promise is followed by a sad disappointment;
but when two persons are driven together, both
reluctantly, into the meshes of matrimony, when
they meet for the first time, and wish it was the
last, there is no promise of happiness which
events may disappoint, but there is a threatening
of misery, which threat is generally fulfilled.
Lady Louisa and Fitzgeorge, though related,
had never met till the marriage between them
had been agreed upon. They had lived in dif-
ferent spheres, had associated with different
society, had cultivated different habits, had
formed different tastes, and were altogether
strangers to each other's thoughts and senti-
ments. Augustus Fitzgeorge was heartless and
artful. Louisa was of strong feelings and of
ingenuous disposition, of a mind altogether un-
diplomatic, plain, and inartificial, having no
thought to disguise, and no thought of dis-
guising. Augustus was altogether of external
manner, his whole mind and soul were merged
## p. 133 (#149) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 133
in forms; gracefulness was the god of his
idolatry and the creature of his affection, he at
once loved and adored it. Louisa, with as much
of the grace of manner as was compatible with
a mind of some thought and a heart of some
feeling, was yet without any especial formality;
whatever of manner she possessed, was that
which had been acquired by situation and the
result of habit, not the produce of close study.
Louisa had also been altogether brought up in
the country, and was a total stranger to metro-
politan refinements. In the remoteness of her
residence she had heard of Fitzgeorge, of his
splendid style of living, of his celebrated gaieties,
and of the great eclat which he had in the
world; but though she had heard much of him
that might dazzle the imagination, she heard
nothing that could interest the affections. It
was, therefore, a painful sacrifice to parental
authority, on her part, which had induced her
to consent to give her hand to Fitzgeorge.
There are many infatuations in the world, and
## p. 134 (#150) ############################################
134 FITZGEORGE.
one of them is the artificial interest which com-
mon people take in the concerns of their su-
periors. If the gods were to come down in the
likeness of men, people could not make a greater
fuss with them than tenants do with their land-
lords' sons and daughters. When a landlord's
son comes of age, or marries, there is over all
the estate a loud, tumultuous joy, far exceeding
that which can be caused by a roasted bullock,
or by many kilderkins of ale. If people can get
food and drink for one day in great abundance,
they may be glad; but their gladness on these
occasions is not merely culinary gladness, but it
is an almost idolatrous joy, as though landlords,
especially titled ones, were such exceedingly va-
luable articles that the world could not possibly
do without them. All this arises from a very
ordinary kind of error, founded on a misappre-
hension of words. It is common to speak of
such an estate belonging to such a nobleman,
and the other belonging to another, just as
though the very existence of the land depended
## p. 135 (#151) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 135
on the owner, and as though there would be
no land to cultivate, and consequently no food
to eat, if it were not for these noblemen who
own such large tracts of land. Then the no-
blemen themselves, by a very pleasant and not
unnatural delusion, plume themselves as being
of such immense importance, and contributing
to the maintenance of so many human beings,
whereas the very reverse is the fact, and they
themselves are dependent on many human
beings for their support. They forget that if
their own sweet persons were all carried off to
the moon, their estates would not go with them,
but that the sun would shine, and the rains
descend, and corn would grow, just as well
without their assistance as with it.
There was, perhaps, no man whose notion of
his own importance was greater than that which
Lord Fitzgeorge entertained of himself. Partly
he had deluded himself, and partly he was de-
luded by those around him. They indeed im-
mediately around him did depend on him very
## p. 136 (#152) ############################################
136 FITZG eor Ge.
much, for they lived by flattering him, and they
grew fat and lazy by ministering to his caprices;
but if they had had wisdom and industry
enough to work for themselves, they could have
done very well without him. It was not their being
that depended on him, no nor their well-being,
but their lazy being. So because they loved
laziness they extolled him mightily, they lifted
up their voices loudly in his praise, till they
made the world, that is their own immediate
neighbourhood, believe that were it not for Lord
Fitzgeorge, they should all be as nothing and
less than nothing. When, therefore, his lord-
ship's tenants got information that the Honour-
able Augustus Fitzgeorge was about to be mar-
ried to his cousin Lady Louisa, there was a great
rejoicing and a mighty deal of talking about it,
as if it was a matter of real and deep concern
to them. . The farmers would drink strong ale
to the health of Augustus Fitzgeorge and the
Lady Louisa, and would fancy that they had a
greater attachment to the bride and bridegroom
## p. 137 (#153) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 137
elect than they had to their own strong ale.
The blacksmith would let his iron cool on the
anvil to talk about Lady Louisa and Augustus
Fitzgeorge. On the same topic would the
ploughman meditate while he was turning up
the furrows of the field. It was talk for the
parlour and talk for the kitchen.
There were some persons who wondered much
that so pious a man as Lord Fitzgeorge should
drive his son to be guilty of so great an impro-
priety as to swear fidelity and lasting affection
at the altar to one for whom he had no affec-
tion, and towards whom he was most unlikely
to preserve fidelity. It was thought that Lord
Fitzgeorge manifested no great sense of religion
when knowing that his son was already married
to one person, he should compel him to marry
another. But great lords have a peculiar me-
thod of managing their piety, which common
people cannot understand.
Fitzgeorge had given his consent to the mar-
riage and the preparations for it proceeded,
## p. 138 (#154) ############################################
138 FITZGEORGE.
negotiations were entered into with the friends
of Lady Louisa, and Lord Fitzgeorge received
the congratulations of his neighbours on the
happy prospect. But there was no one indivi-
dual in the whole connexion either on one side
or the other who thought that there was the
slightest prospect of happiness.
But previously to the marriage, as there were
many expenses pressing somewhat inconve-
niently upon him, Augustus requested and
hoped that some pecuniary assistance would be
granted him. He also wished to enjoy in festi-
vity and gaiety the few remaining days of his
liberty. It would also have been very agreeable
to him had means been afforded him to pay his
own debts, so that he needed not to expose the
particulars of them either to his pious father or
to any individual commissioned to settle and
arrange them. But Lord Fitzgeorge would
hear of no such proposal. -
"Let him marry, let him marry," said his
lordship in his usual hasty way, "and then he
## p. 139 (#155) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 139
shall have means of keeping house. He shall
not have a farthing till he is actually married.
I'll not trust him. If I give him any money
now he may change his mind when the day
comes."
"Perhaps," said Mr. Graves, in whose hear-
ing the above remark was made, "the Honour-
able Augustus Fitzgeorge may have some debts
to discharge which he would prefer discharging
by his own hand in preference to the interven-
tion of a third person."
"Ah, Mr. Graves," replied Lord Fitzgeorge,
"you understand, you understandvery good
indeed. I understand how some little saving
may be made in settling the young gentleman's
debts. You and I, Mr. Graves, can pay his
debts for him at one half the expense that he
can pay them for himself."
"Indeed, my lord 7" said Mr. Graves inter-
rogatively, and with a look of wonder at the
mighty wisdom of his master; "how so?" Mr.
Graves knew very well the meaning of Lord

140 FITZGEORGE.
Fitzgeorge, but he wished to put his lordship
into a good conceit of his own wisdom and saga-
city.
To his steward's marvelling interrogation
Lord Fitzgeorge replied, saying, "Do you think
he has any debts of honour?"
"Too many I am afraid," replied Mr. Graves.
"Do you think he has any debts of gallan-
try "
"Alas!" said Mr. Graves, shaking his head
as he spoke, "I am afraid too many also of
them."
"And do you think," said Lord Fitzgeorge,
"that if his debts are paid by advertisement,
by a committee, that all these debts of honour
and gallantry will be claimed ?"
"Bonds, peradventure," replied Mr. Graves,
"may have been given in some of these cases."
"But we must know whether any valuable
consideration has been given for these bonds,"
replied Lord Fitzgeorge.
"Most excellently well thought !" said Mr.
## p. 141 (#157) ############################################
FITZG EORGE. 141
Graves, "I see now that it would be the height
of imprudence and waste to give him money to
pay his own debts; he would pay those first
which ought to be paid last or not at all."
"You see, Mr. Graves," said his lordship,
"that there is some advantage in having one's
wits about one in money matters. Never part
with more money than is absolutely unavoidable.
Draw your teeth and give them away, cut off
your fingers and give them away, but never part
with money as long as you can keep it. Money
is power, and power is every thing."
Augustus Fitzgeorge was most deeply morti-
fied at being thus treated like a child, at not
being trusted with the management of his own
affairs; and there were moments in which in-
stead of considering himself as an object of
universal envy, he was of opinion that he was
rather an object of pity; and occasionally he felt
himself to be an object of contempta feeling
to his mind most exquisitely bitter but often
unavoidable.

142 FITZGEORGE.
When the day appointed for the marriage
was near at hand, and when there was now no
hope of escape, it was thought by Fitzgeorge
a suitable time to assemble together his gay and
witty companions, to laugh over the topic of
matrimony, and to celebrate the last days of
liberty. The sparkling wit of Drury Borrow-
man, the humour and life of Lionel Leppard,
the brutal coarseness of Fitzmaurice, the pro-
fane ribaldry of Mr. Bradley, were of course
most excellent preparatives for that reverence
which is due to the feebler sex, and for that
considerate care which every man of real polite-
ness thinks it his bounden duty to exercise
towards one who has placed herself in his
power and at his mercy. Even Sir Nicholas
Bobadil, whose exquisite susceptibility and su-
perfine taste might have led to the supposition,
that constitutional tenderness would have in-
spired him with some mercy towards the unpro-
tected sex, gave also his quota of sneer and jest
to strengthen the disgust which Fitzgeorge

already entertained too strongly against his in-
tended bride.
, How coarse, indeed, must be that mind, how
selfish and how callous that heart which will
betray its sensibility and recklessness through
the thick varnish of conventional politeness.
How seductive must be the attractions of high
rank which being totally artificial and conven-
tional, can induce men to offer to it the sacrifice
of their better feelings, and lead them even to
surrender their own independence. Some of
these gay ones who surrounded Fitzgeorge were
in that rank of life which enabled them to sit
in the chair of the magistrate; and if in the
discharge of their duties a culprit had been
brought before them, who should have avowed
the principles on which Fitzgeorge was acting,
and the principles which in him they counte-
nanced, applauded, and corroborated, serious
indeed would have been their reproofs, and,
perhaps, even the very worst of them would
have felt some sincerity in administering the

salutary chastisement of severe animadversion.
But rank makes all the difference. Men of wit
and genius sat at the table of Fitzgeorge know-
ing that in a few days he was about to pledge
at the altar his hand and heart to one for whom
he not only cared nothing, but for whom he
entertained an actual dislike and aversion. He
was going to make solemn asseveration of his
intention to love, honour, and cherish her whom
he did not love, would not honour, and from
whom he would be glad to be separated for
ever. All this he was going to do for the sake
of paying his debts, and he had no other con-
cern about his debts, than that they were an
annoyance to him, and that they in some mea-
sure interfered with those sensual pleasures
which were the sole object of his ambition.
Marrying for money is mean enough at best,
but with many it has its excuses, and few in-
deed are they who are not so far ashamed of the
nakedness of the motive as to use some little
artifice to disguise it. But Fitzgeorge so far
## p. 145 (#161) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 145
from disguising it, made an open avowal not
only of his motive, but of the profound contempt
he had for her, to whom he was sentenced to be
united. If therefore among the human race,
men could be found who would countenance
him in this part of his conduct, who would not
merely countenance, but applaud him; it is not
to be wondered, that there should be found after-
wards those, who could sell themselves to the
adulation of rank so far as to conspire in false
accusation against her thus sacrificed to the
pecuniary convenience of the heartless sen-
sualist. Of this, however, more hereafter.
Now while the preparations and negociations
were going forward, Fitzgeorge and his friends
were making merry, and they were exulting in
their own wit, and chirping carelessly over their
cups. On the other hand Lady Louisa was
preparing to surrender her liberty most reluc-
tantly; little, however, was the liberty which
she had to surrender, seeing that she was almost
under the dictation of those who were about

her. She was of too high a family to have any
thing of a choice in matters of the heart; a
negative voice indeed she had, and once had
exercised that voice in rejecting one of the
greatest noodles which can render title ridicu-
lous, and such is the reverence in which men
hold title, that it requires a great deal of folly
or a great deal of vice to render it contemptible
or ridiculous. But in the exercise of this nega-
tive she had suffered a martyrdom of annoyance
and persecution, by which she had been com-
pelled to hold herself in readiness to yield to
the next proposal that was made, and this pro-
posal was from the friends of the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge. Fitzgeorge was known
to her by fame, or more properly speaking, re-
port; for the celebrity which he enjoyed scarcely
deserved so honourable a name as fame. Re-
port had spoken of his profligacy and extrava-
gance, but was more loud in its praises of him
as a gentleman, as a man of most consummate
elegance and deportment, as a man of a most

amazing degree of taste in articles of dress, fur-
niture, and equipage. Report said nothing of
his wit or wisdom, of the powers of his mind or
the affection of his heart; report merely said
that he was a perfect gentleman, which of course
he very easily might be without either head or
heart.
As Lady Louisa had once lost her heart to
one of plebeian caste, whom it was therefore
impossible for her to marry, and as she knew
that she had no liberty of choice, and scarcely
liberty of refusal, she accepted the offer that
was made to her by the friends of him, whom
the world called a perfect gentleman; for she
thought that a gentleman must be decidedly
preferable to a booby. Living so entirely in
the country, and at so great a distance from the
metropolis her ignorance of that which is called
the world, was very great. In her idea of a
perfect gentleman she included not merely ex-
ternal and superficial manner, but courtesy of
heart and illumination of intellect. She had
H 2

148 FITZGEORGE.
given up that dream of domestic bliss which is
the common delusion of youth, and had resigned
herself to be content with a far more moderate
and humble portion of happiness; but at all
events she took it for granted that as Fitzgeorge
was a gentleman she should neither be insulted
nor persecuted.
Sufficient has been already said of the family
of Fitzgeorge to show that they were exceed-
ingly proud. Generally speaking it is the cus-
tom that, when a marriage takes place, the gen-
tleman goes to the lady's parish, but the pride
of Fitzgeorge was such that the lady in this in-
stance must be brought to him. However, in
, order to make some show of respect, several of
Fitzgeorge's friends were sent as an escort, and
among the rest was Mrs. Jernigan.
"Now Mrs. Jernigan," said Fitzgeorge, "be-
fore you bring me this odious bride home, you
must ascertain what kind of a creature she is,
and let me know."
"And I shall also," said Mrs. Jernigan,
i

FITZGEORGE. 149
laughing, "let her know what kind of a crea-
ture you are."
"By all means," replied Fitzgeorge, "say
any thing of me that you please; make her
hate me right heartily; and if we quarrel as
soon as the priest has shut his book so much
the better."
Mrs. Jernigan was, as has been already said
or insinuated, a woman of good address and
great dexterity of manner. There was about
her a certain style of freedom and ease which
looked like open heartedness, and irresistibly
invited confidence. None but the most expe-
rienced in character would have detected or
suspected insincerity beneath that bright veil of
gay address. Lady Louisa was charmed with
the happy ease and freedom of her manner, and
being by natural disposition exceedingly unre-
served, there seemed to be a perfect good un-
derstanding and mutual cordiality between
them. -
"I shall be most happy," said Lady Louisa,
## p. 150 (#166) ############################################
150 FITZGEORGE.
"in my new situation to possess so agreeable a
companion as Mrs. Jernigan."
"I am concerned to say," replied Mrs. Jer-
nigan, "that in your union with Fitzgeorge you
will be frequently under the necessity of seeking
other society than that of your husband. He
is very far from being a domestic man."
"Ah well," replied Louisa sighing, "it is no
matter."
Smiles to a stranger are a symptom of confi-
dence, sighs are a stronger symptom, but tears
are stronger than all; with the sigh which
Lady Louisa heaved, she also shed a few slight
tears which she scarcely noticed enough to
brush away. But Mrs. Jernigan saw them,
and was hastily eager at catching the intimation
which they gave, that she might be more fami-
liar in her talk and more confidential.
"Alas! I have spoken too freely of Fitz-
george, I pray your ladyship's pardon," said
Mrs. Jernigan with the most subtle affectation
of concern, "I spoke not of him as a heedless

man or as one likely to neglect his wife, my
thought was merely of the multiplicity of his
engagements. I have wounded your feelings
needlessly, unintentionally. He is indeed a
perfect gentleman, and I do not wonder that
you should be concerned at the slightest thought
of alienation in that heart which should be and
no doubt will be wholly yours."
Lady Louisa seriously and mournfully shook
her head and replied, "I have seen enough of
life to have outgrown the romance of the heart
I have knownbutyou will pardon me
my good ladyI have unintentionally alluded
to a topic which I thought had passed away
with its interest from my mind. It mustit
shall be forgotten."
It is not very common, or even probable that
one woman should speak to another on the sub-
ject of an affair of the heart, without making
the other her confidant. The very first allusion is
the necessary forerunner of all the particulars.
This did Mrs. Jernigan perfectly well know,
:
## p. 152 (#168) ############################################
152 FitzGEORGE.
and having suspected, was now happy in seeing
the probability of ascertaining the fact. With
a well feigned concern she kept alive by many
questions and remarks, the allusion to the
topic, till at length Lady Louisa was brought to
acknowledge, that though she had a hand, she
had not a heart to give to Fitzgeorge. "But be
it as it maythe hour of delusion has passed
away,+I may have domestic peace, though I
may not have domestic bliss, I may respect
whom I cannot loveI may be faithful though
not affectionate."
"Happy Fitzgeorge l'exclaimed Mrs. Jer-
nigan, "to meet with so rational a companion!"
Then there followed one of those looks which
only a crafty woman can give, which excited
curiosity and stimulated farther enquiry. With
great freedom did Mrs. Jernigan speak of the
character of Fitzgeorge, but not with great cor-
rectness, for Lady Louisa from the representa-
tions thus given to her, formed an idea of her
destined husband not at all approaching the truth.
## p. 153 (#169) ############################################
FitzGeorge. 153
To her own apprehension it had seemed that
Fitzgeorge was a gentleman of very fastidious
mind, and remarkable for his susceptibility of
disgust at ought that interfered with his refined
accuracy of taste; but by the representation of
Mrs. Jernigan it appeared that much of this
refinement was merely external, and that so far
from being offended at any lack of this refine-
ment in others, nothing was more agreeable and
delightful to him than to seeinartificial manners,
and that kind of deportment which was the
prompting of the natural character; that so far
from being pleased with any effort at an artificial
or studied gracefulness, Fitzgeorge was never
more offended than when any studious formality
was detected, as it easily was by his discerning
eye. Mrs. Jernigan by a well acted stratagem
thus found her way into the absolute confidence
of Lady Louisa, whose greatest misfortune was
an openness of heart, and a general confiding
ingenuousness of disposition. It was, indeed,
to her a misfortune that she possessed no portion
H 3
## p. 154 (#170) ############################################
154 FITZGEORGE.
whatever of duplicity. Most human characters
have some degree of duplicity, it is almost abso-
lutely necessary for them; Fitzgeorge for in-
stance could have had no friends at all had he
suffered them to see the nakedness of his soul,
the utter and reckless sensuality of his disposi-
tion, and the complete selfishness of his heart.
So it should seem that nature, who in her gifts
is abundantly liberal, is never gratuitously and
needlessly lavish, she gives not duplicity or ar-
tifice to those whose characters have in them
nothing that requires concealment.
Before Louisa and Fitzgeorge met for the
first time Mrs. Jernigan amused the voluptuary
with a most entertaining description of the lady,
caricaturing and of course exaggerating every
feature of the description, and confirming him
most decidedly and irrevocably in his precon-
ceived distaste. When, therefore, the bride
and bridegroom elect were for the first time in-
troduced to each other, there was a scene which
at once opened the eyes of the misguided and

FITZGEORGE. 155
confiding bride. It was next to impossible for
her to imagine that the haughty and supercili-
ous personage who was presented to her under
the designation of the Honourable Augustus
Fitzgeorge, could by any possibility be a perfect
gentleman. There seemed to be in his manners
a most insulting rudeness, and even in the very
language which professed to convey a compli-
ment there was a lurking sneer. For the per-
fection of galling insolence, perhaps, the style
of deportment called the manners of a gentle-
man is almost absolutely requisite. It is grace-
fulness that gives the point to insolence, while
rusticity knows not how to aim the shaft with
effect.
Lady Louisa was prepared to meet her
destined lord with the cordiality and open heart-
edness of a friend, if not with the passionate
ardour of a lover, but it is next to impossible
for any cordiality of address to be given, where
it is not with the slightest degree of cordiality
received; and never is confusion more complete
than when the approach of inartificial yet sen-

sitive friendliness is met by the frigid formality
of haughty indifference. Somet Fitzgeorge and
Louisa; on the one side was a cold distate and
on the other a passionate disgust.
The short time that intervened between the
first introduction and the celebration of mar-
riage, was diligently used by Mrs. Jernigan in
strengthening the dislike which the parties en-
tertained towards each other. She conveyed to
each the remarks that were made by the other,
which remarks had been for the most part sug-
gested by herself. Seldom has any negociator
so well fulfilled the diplomatic task as did Mrs.
Jernigan in this interference between the bride
and bridegroom ; there was not much antecedent
probability of any great cordiality subsisting
between the parties, but now they were in mind
and thought altogether dissociated.
The day for the marriage came. The tenants
and friends of Lord Fitzgeorge were bursting
with joy and congratulations. Some few of the
farmers' sons or lads who had a knack at
rhyming, made little songs and odes on the

occasion, more full of lies than poems usually
are, but they were very innocent lies, for the
authors did not know them to be such; and
these little songs were sung by the farmers' men
at the public-houses in Lord Fitzgeorge's and
the neighbouring parishes. Bells were set
ringing and the whole region round about was
in a state of holiday. The parson of the parish
had a clean surplice and a new wig on the
happy occasion, the clerk and sexton had new
hats and new blue coats with yellow buttons;
flags were mounted on the church tower, and
brandished from the windows of the public-
houses. Nobody could think or talk of any
thing but the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge
and the accomplished Lady Louisa.
Fitzgeorge himself, though reluctant as to
the marriage, was not indifferent to the pomp
and ceremony of a public exhibition, and he had
assembled about him his friends the tailors,
who having clubbed together their several wits
under the auspices of their munificent patron,

gave to him the appearance of one of the best
dressed men that ever the bright sun shone
upon; so that while Augustus was ashamed of
his bride, he had no reason to be ashamed of
his tailors; and though he was sorry that he
was going to be married, he was not sorry that
he had an opportunity of displaying the magni-
ficence of his well adorned person.
Lady Louisa was also decorated in as much
splendour as female taste could devise, but it
was whispered at the time, and, perhaps, not
without some foundation, that Mrs. Jernigan,
who contributed the voluntary aid of her skill
and science, had studiously contrived to render
the bride as unattractive as possible, nay even
the very ornaments which well arranged, might
have been the means of setting off the figure to
advantage, had been purposely ill-arranged, so
as to produce an effect rather displeasing than
otherwise.
A very splendid cavalcade proceeded to the
church; a vast multitude of curious and ad-

miring spectators gazed on the procession; but
though Lady Louisa was a stranger, yet won-
derful to say, the eyes of the multitude and
especially of the parson and clerk were more
pointedly directed to Fitzgeorge than to the
bride; so far Fitzgeorge was happy; this, how-
ever, was but an imperfect happiness, and as he
looked on the Lady Louisa and thought how
inelegant she was compared to himself, and
how rustic her deportment contrasted with his,
when his well practised eye observed in every
part of her dress something that contradicted
his motions of what dress ought to behe almost
scowled upon her with a stern contempt. The
people of Hindostan at the immolation of a
widow look upon the procession and the flames
with a mighty degree of glee and amusement,
thinking nothing of the torture of the victim,
even so the friends and spectators at the mar-
riage of the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge
were pleased with the pomp and ceremony, but
thoughtless of the pains of heart which the vic-

tims suffered. So absent was Fitzgeorge him
self, so heedless of the ceremony, and annoyed
by the occasion of it, or so absorbed in the con-
templation of his own finery, that when the
parson said, "wilt thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife, &c." he made no reply, and
even when the question was asked a second
time, he was silent till Lord Fitzgeorge, who
was standing at his side in great agitation, and
almost anger, exclaimed, "Yes, yes, yes. He
will, he willSay I will, I will." Starting
from his reverie, Fitzgeorge made at last the
proper response, and the ceremony proceeded
to its conclusion.
It is not certain whether Lord Fitzgeorge WaS
most rejoiced on his own account, or on account
of his son, but he expressed his congratulations
with a degree of glee and loudness that were
truly entertaining. Glad he certainly was that
he had gained his point, and some of his tenants
went so far as to say, that he was more re-
joiced that his son was punished, than that he
was married.

CHAPTER VIII.
A HONEY MOON.
"Hot love is soonest cold," is the burden of
an old song, and true enough as the sad
experience of many has proved it; but the
converse of the position is not true, for
when there is coldness at the very commence-
ment of matrimony, there is no chance of any
warmth of affection or attachment afterwards.
The first month of marriage is called the honey-
moon by way of courtesy, even as they who
wear black clothes at the decease of a relative
or friend are said to be in mourning, which is
ndeed a most inaccurate expression, seeing that
he who has a legacy and wears black, mourns

162 FITZGEORGE.
not so much as he, who expecting a legacy
and receiving none, wears not black.
The friends of Fitzgeorge, and the friends
also of Lord Fitzgeorge were abundantly liberal
of their congratulations on what they were pleased
to call the happy event, though all that had
the slightest share of penetration, could see with
half an eye, that there was no great degree of
happiness in the matter, nor much prospect of
it; but people must use words of course,
must they? why must they 2
Lady Louisa had not as yet discerned the
duplicity and craft of Mrs. Jernigan, and, con-
sequently had not withdrawn her confidence, or
abated aught of her familiarity. In their fre-
quent conversations, whenever the talk ran, as
it almost always did by Mrs. Jernigan's con-
trivance, on the manners and behaviour of Au-
gustus Fitzgeorge, there was generally an
abundant freedom of remark from Lady Louisa
on the peculiarities of her husband. A gentle-
man who gives himself up very greatly to the

decoration of his person, and makes the elegan-
cies of life his sole study, presents to the eye of
ordinary observation, many ludicrous points.
The whole mystery of the ridiculous lies in the
different ideas which are formed on the question
of importance. To Fitzgeorge it was a matter
of importance that he should be exceedingly
well dressed, therefore he thought it not ridicu-
lous that he should be closetted many hours
with his tailor in deep consultation and close
designing. But to Lady Louisa, who did not
think the exceeding accuracy of dress a matter
of any moment, it appeared extremely ridicu-
lous, that a person of such high birth should
devote himself so studiously to the business of
personal decoration.
"After all," said Lady Louisa to Mrs. Jerni-
gan, "he may be rivalled by a linendraper's
apprentice."
Now the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge
was a person in whose mind such an expression
as this would sink very deeply, producing a de-

164 FitzGeoRGE.
gree of annoyance and irritation not easily to be
removed. It was one of those unanswerable
remarks, that stamp at once the littleness of a
man's ambition; and such was the feeling of
Fitzgeorge, that an observation like this, though
not made in his hearing, or for his ear, would
inflict a deeper wound than language of the
grossest, or the keenest insult.
Fitzgeorge, however, made an effort, and with
one so self-willed as he was, it was a serious
effort indeed, to keep up the appearance of ci-
vility to his new-made bride.
There was hostility against Louisa rising up
in another quarter. The old Lady Fitzgeorge
had a pique against her, because she was not
the person whom her ladyship had designed for
her son's wife. Allusion has been made in the
course of this romance to the domestic bliss
enjoyed by Lord and Lady Fitzgeorge; in fact,
they were neither of them persons of great sus-
ceptibility of feeling, or of mighty reach of
mind; they had a quiet kind of enjoyment in
## p. 165 (#181) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 165
thinking themselves much more wise and pru-
dent than the rest of the world. Her ladyship
had her own crotchets and caprices, which she
could more easily indulge by stratagem than by
conquest; for his lordship was never to be sub-
dued, he was invincible in his whims. Of the
two ladies who were thought of as suitable for
Augustus, one was his cousin by the father's
side, and the other was his cousin by the mo-
ther's side. Now as Lord Fitzgeorge was an
exceedingly literal man in all his apprehensions,
he considered that as according to the marriage
service it is the duty of the wife to obey, it must
be also, by parity of reason, the duty, or at least
the privilege of the husband to command ;
therefore he used his authority in all matters,
and of course not least in the matter of his son's
marriage. He cared no more for his own niece
than for his wife's niece, and less for his son
than for either. Therefore, merely because Lady
Louisa was his own niece, he insisted upon it
that she should be his son's wife. She became

166 FITZGEORGE.
so accordingly, much to the annoyance of Lady
Fitzgeorge, who indeed was so much annoyed
by the arrangement, that she could hardly be-
have to the bride with common civility.
Knowing her son's character, and affecting to
reprove the irregularities of his life, it was not
very consistent that she should countenance his
acquaintance with Mrs. Jernigan; but the truth
is, that Lady Fitzgeorge found this person ex-
ceedingly convenient in carrying tales and tittle-
tattle from one house to the other, and in mak-
ing mischief between her son and his wife. Yet
Lady Fitzgeorge was a very religious woman,
and a lady of great decorum. But what is reli-
gion, and what is decorum, when placed in com-
petition with the gratification of a malignant
and resentful feeling? Every body who knows
anything about family quarrels, which of course
very few people do, must know that they arise
from most trifling matters, and that they spring
from the little dirty passions of those who en-
gage in them, rather than from any real injury
## p. 167 (#183) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 167
inflicted or meditated. Man is a quarrelsome
animal; some individuals of the species are more
so than others, and any one who has a little
ingenuity, and is acquainted with two parties of
little mind and great obstinacy, may very easily
set them quarrelling till they hate one another
with a perfect hatred. Of this disposition was
Lady Fitzgeorge, of whom it may be quaintly
said, that she loved nothing so much as hating.
Now Lady Fitzgeorge was not the most beau-
tiful woman in the world, as she herself might
very well know, for her house had plenty of
looking-glasses in it. But it was very foolish
for Mrs. Jernigan to be perpetually provoking
Lady Louisa to make remarks on this deficiency
of personal beauty, and still more foolish to
repeat the remarks, and most foolish of all was
Lady Fitzgeorge to be offended at such remarks,
which she must have known to have been prompt-
ed by Mrs. Jernigan. But thus it is when one
person hates another, either for no reason at all,
or for a cause that cannot with any propriety or
## p. 168 (#184) ############################################
168 FITZGEORGE.
decency be avowed, then the ingenuity is ex-
erted to make or find some pretext for the ha-
tred which already exists. It was so with Lady
Fitzgeorge; she hated Lady Louisa because she
had been preferred to her niece.
When Mrs. Jernigan was attending on Louisa
with the apparent formality of a humble friend,
but with the real familiarity of an old acquaint-
ance, it was almost unavoidable that the con-
versation should turn upon the new situation in
which Lady Louisa was placed, and the new
friends by whom she was surrounded. It was
also very natural that, coming among strangers,
and finding herself coldly received by her hus-
band and her husband's mother, and of course
not respectfully treated by their friends and
partisans, she should give her confidence and
speak most freely to that individual who, of all
around her, was the only one from whom she
received courtesy and attention. To Mrs. Jer-
nigan, therefore, did Lady Louisa freely open
her heart, and to her did she complain, in no
## p. 169 (#185) ############################################
FITZ GEORGE. 169
measured terms, of the neglect and almost in-
sult to which she was exposed. She saw much
of the external form of courtesy, but there were
no symptoms of really kind feeling; and hav-
ing never been in the habit of disguising her
feelings, she expressed her disgust and dis-
appointment more strongly than cautiously;
and in the transmission of the complaints to the
ears of Lady Fitzgeorge, there was no softening
down, or abatement of any asperity of expres-
sion; and thus while Louisa thought that she
was making at least one sure friend, she was
making many inveterate enemies.
Miserable as was the honeymoon to Lady
Louisa, it passed not much more pleasantly to
Fitzgeorge himself. He had consented to marry
on the faith of a promise from his father that
his debts should be paid; and as his creditors
understood that such an engagement had been
made, they were of course quite on the alert to
take advantage of it. Fitzgeorge was impa-

tient to pay, because his creditors were impatient
to be paid.
"This is really a very odd sort of affair,"
said he to Mr. Graves, "that I have consented
to marry on the faith that my debts should be
paid; and now I am just as much annoyed with
duns as ever. Have the goodness to explain."
Mr. Graves with a very low bow, and in a
very insolent tone, replied, "Positively it is
impossible for me to account for the movements
of your worship's creditors. If they are cla-
morous and troublesome, it is desirable of course
to pacify them."
"To pacify them? But where are the means?
Look ye, Mr. Graves, you are my father's
steward."
"I have that honour," replied Mr. Graves,
bowing again.
"And you know," continued Fitzgeorge,
"that my father will never take any important
step in pecuniary matters without your appro-
bation." -
## p. 171 (#187) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 171
"And I believe that you know," answered
Mr. Graves, "that I have no more power over
his lordship's treasury than what he is pleased
to give me."
"I know not and care not what may be your
command over my father's treasury; but this I
know, that through your negotiation on behalf
of Lord Fitzgeorge, I have been induced to
marry by the promise of having my debts
paid."
y
"Very true, sir, very true," replied Graves;
"there no doubt was some such talk; but then
of course all must depend on the means which
may be at his lordship's disposal. You remember
that an addition has been made to your allow-
ance."
"An addition to my allowance! Certainly.
But I must have my debts paid, my old debts.
This addition to my allowance will barely meet
my increased expenditure which is necessarily
brought on in consequence of my marriage."

Graves, "I believe it was the design of your
honoured father that this increase of your al-
lowance should be made available for the pur-
pose of gradually liquidating your debts."
At this announcement the blood of the Hon.
Augustus Fitzgeorge rose furiously into his face,
and he was graciously pleased to be in a most
tremendous passion. "What!" exclaimed he,
"am I to be all my life long paying off old
debts by instalments Am I married only for
the benefit of my creditors ? Mr. Graves, I will
not bear it, I cannot bear it."
"You must bear it, sir," replied Mr. Graves,
"there is no help for it. But if you fear that
you may find the liquidation of your debts trou-
blesome or annoying, I have the honour to in-
form you that the trouble will not devolve on
you personally or on your steward; your allow-
ance will pass through my hands; part of it will
be paid over to you for your expenses, and part
will be devoted to the discharge of your debts,
which of course will be strictly examined and

inquired into, that you may not be defrauded or
imposed upon."
There were many debts which the Hon.
Augustus Fitzgeorge did not desire to have
submitted to the rude and impertinent scrutiny
of the profane eyes of Mr. Graves, or any of
his clerks, and therefore the intimation that his
debts were to be paid by deputy as well as by
instalments, troubled him still more. "Mr.
Graves," said he, "this is a very troublesome
business."
"Very troublesome, indeed," replied Mr.
Graves, with the utmost coolness; "but for the
future the trouble will be avoided. Your ho-
noured father has made such arrangements that
when your present debts are discharged, which

they will be in about ten or fifteen years,
"Ten or fifteen years!" cried Fitzgeorge,
"are you mad, or do you wish to drive me
mad? Am I to be annoyed for ten or fifteen
years before I can get rid of my creditors?"
"It is an annoyance that you have brought

upon yourself," replied Mr. Graves, "but I was
going to observe, sir, if you would give me
leave to speak, that you will not be again
troubled in this way, for your honoured father
has sent word to all your tradesmen that they
shall send in their bills quarterly, and that they
shall on no account whatever give you any
longer credit, so that you never can be over
bead and ears in debt again, seeing that nobody
will be inclined to trust you."
"Excellent! Admirable !" exclaimed Fitz-
george, in bitter irony; "all this from my
father's servant."
"Your father's servant is 25
"Is my master, I perceive," interrupted Fitz-
george; "but I hope I may at least be master
in my own house, and if you will favour me with
a speedy departure, Mr. Graves, you will confer
an obligation much greater than any which I
have hitherto received at your hands."

not any other classical or historic personage
whom the reader may be pleased to recollect in
a terrible quandary, ever suffered more than
did the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge in his present
helpless, and apparently hopeless condition'
But he was never utterly hopeless, so long as
he could look forward to the time when he
should inherit the title and estates of Lord
Fitzgeorge, for then he anticipated that he
should possess wealth unbounded, and honour
unalloyed. That, however, might be a long
way off, for he knew that they who kept heirs
from their inheritance were frequently very slow
in relinquishing their hold of life, and Lord
Fitzgeorge was not what is called an old man,
he rather was at this time what is called not
an old man. Moreover he was temperate in
his habits, and in the enjoyment of general
good health. Such, indeed was the life that
Augustus led, that there was reason to suppose
that he would be an old man before his father.
At all events, however, a remote hope in the

present circumstances could be but small con-
solation to him;-and when Mr. Graves had
kindly condescended to remove his unpleasant
self from the sight and presence of Fitzgeorge,
then did the voluptuary sigh in very bitterness
of spirit, and though he cursed not the day on
which he was born, yet he cursed almost
everything else, and of course his creditors
among the rest, and they, peradventure, in their
turns, cursed him.
In an agony of soliloquy he said, "Here is a
specimn of the wealth on which I prided my-
self, and built my hopes at the outset of my
life I have not wherewithal to meet the de-
mands of my creditors, and must tell them to
wait ten or fifteen years! Here is magni-

of my own hands ! Here is a pretty consola-
tion lto be told that I am no longer to be

What a prospect ' What a situation Is life
a mere mockery' Are hopes nothing but de-
lusions? Is all this my own fault 2 or if not

None are so blind as those who will not see.
Fitzgeorge was one of those. He wilfully closed
his eyes to all that would have instructed him,
and he was perpetually running against posts,
because, being more delighted with the visions
of imagination than with the realities of actual
existence, he always kept his eyes shut against
realities in order to enjoy visions. Enough had
passed before him to let him see that wealth,
high rank and station, are the means of happi-
ness only to those that have the wisdom to use

them as such. He might have learned by this
time, had he been disposed to learn at all, that
there is a wide difference between that which is
used as an instrument and that which is an ab-
solute cause. Yet here was he advancing
rapidly on in the journey of life, having learned
comparatively nothing of what life means, and
still incompetent as a child to form a rational
idea of what might be expected in his coming
years. He would not learn from the past be-
cause he did not like to think of it, and he used
the anticipation of the future as a blank tablet
whereon to draw the pictures of his vain imagi-
nation.
All the congratulations which had been so
abundantly administered on the occasion of his
marriage had scarcely been uttered, when they
were seen to be misplaced; and the people who
had said so much about what they were pleased
to call the happy event, soon began to see that
there was no happiness, nor any prospect of
happiness in it;-and as the concerns of great

people are generally made the concern of all
the world, so it soon happened that all the
world was talking about the unhappy marriage
of Augustus Fitzgeorge and Lady Louisa. This
talk came at length to the ears of Lord Fitz-
george himself, and occasioned a most diverting
development of his lordship's character.
The old gentleman was not at all grieved
at his son's annoyance, but he was some.
what disturbed for his own reputation. All
the world knew how anxious he had been
for the marriage, and what pains he had taken
to promote it. Now he did not wish to appear
to the public eye as plotting against his son's
happiness, but he knew that if the marriage
should turn out unfortunate, some part of the
blame would, in the public mind, rest on him.
To avoid this he condescended to pay a visit to
his son, a very unusual condescension indeed.
Augustus was alone.
"What, what, what?" exclaimed Lord Fitz-
george, with most marvellous rapidity of utter-

ance, "all alone, all alone Where's your
wife?ehwhere's Louisa 7"
"I cannot tell," replied, Augustus with the
greatest coolness.
"Can't tell? can't tell?" cried his lordship.
"What is the meaning of this look?Tired of
your wife in the honeymoon! Look at your
mother and me ! see how loving we are, and we
have been married upwards of thirty years.
All the world admires us as patterns of con-
jugal bliss. Did not the boys who wrote songs
about your marriage wish that it might turn
out as happy as ours? Look ye, Master Au-
gustus, I insist upon it that you shall love your
wife. I insist upon it, I say, and you know
that I am not to be disobeyed with impunity.
Zooks, sir, what's the use of my being a lord,
if I am not to be obeyed ?"
"It is as impossible for me, sir," replied
Augustus, "to obey your command, as it is
easy for you to utter it. I have no power over
my heart."
## p. 181 (#197) ############################################
. FITZGEORGE. 181
"Heart! heart!" echoed his lordship,
"What has heart to do with the matter 2 I
have no heart, but I behave well to my wife.
You have power over your actions; and if you
do not love your wife you need not be such a
fool as to let all the world know it. You affect
to be fond of popularity, and yet you are silly
enough to advertise that you hate your wife.
The world will always take the part of the
woman in a quarrel between a man and his
wife; and, let me tell you, if you will persist
in your hostility, I shall take your wife's part,
and then I shall gain the popularity you will
lose."
"You are welcome, sir," replied Augustus,
"to as much popularity as you honestly gain."
"Honestly honestly l'" said his lordship
"Nonsenseyou learnt that word from your
democratic companion, Leppard. Butlet me tell
you, that if you are foolish enough to let the
world see your hatred of your wife, you will

182 .FITZGEORGE,
make a set of enemies that you will never get
rid of as long as you live."
But, sir, I cannot command my feelings and
affections."
"A fiddlestick," replied his lordship with
most undignified flippancy, "you do not know
the world. Feelings and affections have no-
thing to do with domestic peace. Now I abso-
lutely heard it whispered that you had been so
foolish as to intimate your intention of living
apart from your wife. You would be mad to
take such a step. This house is large enough
to hold you both. You need never meet at all,
while the world would know nothing about your
disagreement. Appearance is everything. So
long as you pay due regard to appearance, you
may do, say, or think what you will."
"Sir" replied Augustus, most pompously,
and with all the arrogance of virtuous superio-
rity, "I cannot play the hypocrite."
"Hypocrite hypocrite l'' replied his lord-
ship, "you talk like a boy. How can you
## p. 183 (#199) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 183
behave like a gentleman without playing, what
you call, the part of a hypocrite. 'Tis mere
trifling to talk so. You have been hypocrite
enough already, and what bewitches you now
all on a sudden to fly off?"
"Sir," said Augustus, "will you permit me
to speak?"
"Certainly."
2
"Then, sir," continued Augustus, "you will
allow me to remind you that I received from
you through Mr. Graves, a message intimating
that if I would consent to marry a lady whom
you in your paternal wisdom should think fit to
select for me, immediate steps should be taken
to rid me of the incumbrance of my debts.
Now, sir, when I considered to what great in-
convenience some of my creditors were put in
consequence of my inability to meet their de-
mands, I immediately sacrificed all personal
feeling, and complied with your proposal."
Lord Fitzgeorge laughed aloud and replied,
"Very good, indeed, very good; yes, yes, yes-
## p. 184 (#200) ############################################
184 FITZGEORGE.
you cannot play the hypocrite forsooth, and
what is the speech that you have been now
making, but a piece of rank hypocrisy from
beginning to end? You make a sacrifice! I
know you too well for that. The fact is, that
you wanted more money, and could only get it
by means of marrying, so you married accord-
ingly. You never intended to love your wife.
As for your creditors, you care not what becomes
of them so long as they do not annoy you; it
is only while they are dunning you for payment,
that you have any sympathy with their priva-
tions."
"You speak severely, sir," replied Augustus.
"Ay, and truly too," added his lordship,
"now mark me, Augustus, notwithstanding
your apparent popularity, the world knows your
character well, and will soon know it a great
deal better. You have not the common craft
to put a decent disguise on yourself. You
married for money, and you have got some
money."
## p. 185 (#201) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 185
"But not enough to meet all the demands of
my creditors."
"So much the better; you will learn eco-
nomy. You know that there is no farther chance
for you; you cannot marry for money a second
time. And how simple were you to tell your
companions that you cared more for the money
than you did for your wife. You need not
have told them so, they knew it very well, they
only laughed at your simplicity for talking
about it. Let me hear no more about your cre-
ditors! if you are really concerned about them
you will contrive ways and means to get rid of
them; you will not go on at the extravagant
rate which you have been so long living at.
Bless my soulhere is a room, furnished at five
times the expense of any one in my house, and
I think I have as good a right to a splendid
apartment as you have. If I may be so bold,
pray what was the cost of furnishing this one

"Really, sir," replied Augustus rather

mettled at the sneering manner in which the
question was put, "I cannot exactly say. I
am not in the habit of carrying these matters
so particularly in my memory."
"I dare say not," said Lord Fitzgeorge, "I
suppose you are too great a man to inquire the
cost of anything. You give the order, and you
trust to the chapter of accidents for the pay-
ment. Why do you not follow my example
and live carefully and frugally I never suffer
my tradesmen to send in any goods till I know
what is to be the price of them, and I take
care always to have them at the lowest price.
You will never know how to drive a bargain as
long as you live."
"It is not my ambition, sir," replied Augustus.
"But if it is your ambition to be out of debt,
it should be your ambition to live within your
income. Now let me tell you once for all, you
have nothing more to expect from me, so you
must endeavour to live on your allowance. I
have directed a certain part of your income to

be set apart for the purpose of paying your cre-
ditors, on the rest you must live as well as you
can. And if you will be so absurd as to separate
from your wife, I will take care to let the world
know that it is all your own fault; and you
will find yourself in no very enviable situation
so far as regards public opinion, when you have
to endure the odium that must cleave to you as
the tyrannical husband of an injured and per-
secuted woman. You understand your situa-
tion." -
"I am sorry to say that I do, sir."
"Then try to avoid its inconveniences as well
as you can. Keep up a decent appearance.
Live in the same house with your wife; but
she may live at one end and you the other.
And if you will take my advice, you will some-
times appear together in public, at theatre for
instance, or at church."
"I cannot possibly sit in the same box with
her at the theatre."
"But you may sit in the same pew with her

at church, for if you keep your eye on the
prayer-book you will not see your wife; and
then you will get a reputation of being very
devout, which is a reputation always worth
having.You will know the world a little bet-
ter when you have lived longer it."
Fitzgeorge thought he had lived long enough
in the world, for he had lived long enough to
be overwhelmed with annoying embarrassments;
he had lived long enough to be married to a
woman whom he disliked with all his heart,
with all his soul, and with all his strength; he
had lived long enough to lose the reputation
with which he commenced life, and to disap-
point the sanguine expectation of his friends;
he had lived long enough to disappoint
himself, and to find trouble, perplexity, and
mortification, where he had expected nothing
but ease, freedom, honour, and delight; and
above all he had lived long enough to be grow-
ing fatthat was a trouble that touched him
most closely, for that there was no remedy, and

under that there was no consolation; in time he
might get rid of his debts; in time he might
get rid of his wife; in time he might recover
his reputation; but never, never, never could
he hope to get rid of his corpulency, and enjoy
again the elastic slenderness of his youth.
There was, however, one, and only one con-
solation that he could enjoy, and that was the
thought that the world did not know how ex-
ceedingly he was annoyed with his troubles
and perplexities. It may seem to be a very
faint or equivocal satisfactien, that a man can
derive from an idea, that his sorrows and morti-
fications are unknown to the world; but there
is much more in it than many are aware of.
One great part of the pleasure of wealth is, that
the world sees it; and one great part of the
pain of poverty, is that the world sees it. Now
Augustus Fitzgeorge had virtually advertised to
the world, that it was his intention and plan of
life, to enjoy himself freely, fully, boldly, trium-
phantly; if, therefore, he had manifestly and

clearly failed in that matter, he would have
been in the world's eye, as a vanquished, de-
feated, disappointed man; but if he could carry
everything off with a good grace, and with a
calm countenanceif, in public, he could be the
gayest among the gay, and the proudest of the
proud, he was so far happy, as that he was
conscious that he was an object of envy and
admiration. Some people are very fond of pity
when they ask for it, but no one likes to be
pitied in those matters in which it has been his
ambition to be envied.
This visit which Fitzgeorge received from
his honoured father, was not much more plea-
sant than that which he had received from Mr.
Graves; by both of them, he learnt that he had
little or nothing to hope. Strange, however, as
it may seem, all these lessons had no effect
upon him whatever, in abating his passion for
prodigality, or in directing his ambition into
more moral or intellectual channels. He still
sought after a life of luxury and ease, though

he had been hitherto so long and entirely dis-
appointed in the pursuit, and he still, notwith-
standing his increasing corpulency, had hopes
that, by means of his inseparable friends and
right trusty counsellors, the tailors, he might
yet be a model of visible and external grace.

CHAPTER IV.
Sep ARATION.
FitzGEORGE endeavoured, according to the
best of his ability, to take his father's advice,
or more properly speaking, to obey his father's
commands, but found greater difficulty in the
endeavour than he had anticipated. It is true
enough, as Lord Fitzgeorge had said, that the
house was large enough to hold them both,
but Fitzgeorge wished to have it all to him-
self; he was reduced, as it were, to half a
house, and was thus reminded, as he wittily
observed to his friend Borrowman, of the ro-
mantic tales which told of castles that could
## p. 193 (#211) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 193
only be partially inhabited, because one wing
was haunted. It did not altogether comport
with Fitzgeorge's notion of ease, happiness and
dignity, to have under the same roof with him-
self, a person whom he wished to avoid, and
of whom he could not patiently bear to think
to be only half master of his own mansion,
and to have an invisible line of demarcation,
beyond which he must not pass. There seemed,
indeed, a fatality hanging over his path, inter-
cepting all his movements, and thwarting all
his designs, so that every prospect was blighted
and every hope withered. He forgot, or never
thought, that much of this was his own fault
that it arose unavoidably, and necessarily, from
the extravagance of his wishes, and the folly of
his hopes. The lessons of instruction and dis-
cipline were given to him in vain, for he made
it the whole business of his life, to nourish up
for himself the means of disappointment and
mortification. -
Finding that it was not very easy to conceal

from the world, the disgust which he felt to-
wards his wife, by means of living in separate
apartments in the same house, his next thought
was, how he might get rid of the incumbrance
altogether, and that in such a manner as that
the blame of the separation should not fall
upon him. In the days of his earliest youth,
Fitzgeorge had been greatly indifferent to moral
reputation, but as life advanced, he learned
another lesson, and began to think that it was
desirable to stand well in the opinion of his
neighbours. He had once laughed at the wise
and good, but he found that they were a very
numerous body when they counted themselves,
and that they had a considerable influence on
society. He cared, indeed, no more about wis-
dom and goodness, in the advancing years of
his life, than he had in his earlier days, but
he knew more of the value of opinion, and was
desirous of enlisting it on his side.
Among other evils and inconveniences of hav-
ing the house divided between himself and his

wife, was this, viz. that as Mrs. Jernigan was
professedly the companion of Lady Louisa, and
therefore belonged to that part of the house
which Fitzgeorge facetiously called the haunted
wing of the castle, he could not, without glar-
ing impropriety, enjoy so much of her pleasant
company as heretofore; for if Mrs. Jernigan
visited not the mansion, for the purpose of com-
panionship with Lady Louisa, for what purpose
did she come 2
"So, Mrs. Jernigan," said Fitzgeorge, " you
have ventured to pass over from the haunted
side of the castle."
"Haunted, indeed," replied Mrs. Jernigan,
"I think it is haunted with an evil spirit. Oh,
it is such a relief to escape the company of
your most accomplished lady!"
"Silence, Mrs. Jernigan," answered Fitz-
george, "I must not hear you speak disrespect-
fully of my better half."
"But I must speak so, if it be only to relieve
myself. And you can never hear me speak

more disrespectfully of her, than I heard her
ladyship speak of you. The vulgar creature!"
"Her vulgarity is the unpardonable offence,"
replied Fitzgeorge, "I believe that it was for
that most admirable quality that my father chose
her, and imposed her on me for a wife. He
must have known that I could only regard her
with disgust. If I could but manage to remove
her from this establishment altogether, I should
not heed the expense or trouble; but to be com;
pelled to keep up the farce of civility towards
an individual who is absolutely odious to me, is
almost more than I can bear."
"I should think that you would not have
much difficulty in that arrangement. Her at-
tachment to you is not much stronger than your
love for her."
"Oh, Mrs. Jernigan, let me beseech you never
to mention love and her in the same breath."
"And yet," replied Mrs. Jernigan, "she talks
of love, and that most fluently, most elo-
quently."
## p. 197 (#215) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. I97
"She talk of love " exclaimed Fitzgeorge.
"Of love for whom ?"
"Oh, not for you, believe me;
replied Mrs.
Jernigan, laughing as she spoke; "but shall I
tell you for whom, or rather for what? for I do
not know the man's name; that secret is to die
with her."
"The sooner the better," said Fitzgeorge.
"What think you of a captain of a marching
regiment, that happened to be quartered in her
father's neighbourhood 2"
"Most excellent," replied Fitzgeorge, laugh-
ing as heartily as he ever allowed himself to
laugh. "I wish she had made me her confi-
dant; but I dare to say that the story will lose
nothing by passing through your hands."
"I am afraid it will lose every thing but its
truth," said Mrs. Jernigan, "it is impossible
for any imitation to do justice to the exquisite
gravity and solemnity with which she talks of
the bold captain." -

"The truth will come mended from your
tongue," replied Fitzgeorge.
"You have only to imagine thenbut, posi-
tively, it is really too bad that I should quiz
your wife in your own hearing."
"You quiz so delightfully, that I could en-
dure and enjoy to hear you quiz myself."
"Now imagine her ladyship putting on a
grave face, thusheaving a deep sighlaying
her hand on her heart, thus" Mrs. Jernigan,
as she spoke, imitated the actions which she
described; "then, imagine her saying, using all
the while her broad provincial dialect, 'Ah! my
dearest and best friend, my dear Mrs. Jernigan,
you know not what it is to cherish a hope-
less love.'"
"Did she dare say this to you?" asked Fitz-
george. -
"Ay," replied Mrs. Jernigan, "this, and
much more than this. But you shall hear.
* Ah, my beloved Mrs. Jernigan, I little thought

that when I left my father's home to become
the wife of so distinguished a gentleman as

to such insult and neglect. It is a just punish-
ment for the sin of which I have been guilty,
of giving my hand to one, while my heart
was another's.'"
"I think," replied Fitzgeorge, "that I am
pretty severely punished for that sin. But pro-
ceed." - *
"You are, indeed," answered Mrs. Jernigan,
" and, from all that I can learn, it appears that
her ladyship is disposed to let you have the
full weight of your punishment. "You never
saw the captain, my dear Mrs. Jernigan, she
continued, "he is as different a man from Fitz-
george as light from darkness! There was a
man to win a heart and keep one ! He was not
indebted to the tailor, or the perfumer, for his
charms.
Fitzgeorge frowned, for he had too great a
reverence for tailors and perfumers, to hear

them treated with disrespect. Mrs. Jernigan
continued: "I know that I can confide in my
dear Mrs. Jernigan, and you may believe that I
feel a great relief in thus pouring my sorrows
into a sympathizing bosom.'"
"Of course, you sympathized with her," said
Fitzgeorge. "What sort of person is this re-
nowned captain 2 Did she show you his minia-
ture ?"
"She did not confide in me so far as that,"
replied Mrs. Jernigan, "nor do I know whether
or not she possesses his miniature. But his
image is so fixed in her heart, that she needs
no other remembrancer."
"I wish," replied Fitzgeorge, "that he had
married her, or that he would run-away with
her. He should be perfectly welcome to her."
"Oh dear no," exclaimed Mrs. Jernigan,
"he is too virtuous a man to run away with
a married woman. He is such a paragon of
excellence; he is in possession of all manner
of virtues, possible and impossible."

... "He is a perfect gentleman, of course," said
Fitzgeorge. -
"He is a perfect gentleman in her ladyship's
eyes, but not in mine, for, by Lady Louisa's
account, he is in every respect, the reverse of
the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge." -
"So this woman has really had the effron-
tery to tell you that when she was married to
me, she was attached to another. You have
hinted as much before, but I little imagined
that you would have her own authority for it,
so expressly and unequivocally. Don't you
think, Mrs. Jernigan, that I bear the intelli-
gence with great fortitude?"
"Most marvellously so," replied Mrs. Jer-
nigan.
Fitzgeorge had been so much accustomed to
universal admiration, and had been so greatly
disposed to admire himself, that, notwithstand-
ing his dislike of his new bride, he was partly
jealous and angry, that she should admire ano-
ther more than him. So he not only disliked

her gratuitously, and on her own account, but
was also resentfully disposed, in consequence
of her non-admiration of him. He thought,
however, that it was well that she had acknow-
ledged to Mrs. Jernigan an attachment before
marriage, for this acknowledgment, joined to
her general freedom of manner, her candid and
unsuspicious temper, might be made use of as
the means of procuring not merely a separa-
tion of temporary arrangement, but a separa-
tion for ever; a complete and total unmarry-
ing.
Had there been no other troubles and per-
plexities falling to the lot of Fitzgeorge than
the present, had he not been surrounded by duns,
and encompassed by fat, had he not been morti-
fied by the insolence of Mr. Graves, or been
burdened by the recollection of certain passages
in his life, not of the most honourable aspect;
yet the mere fact, that almost in the very first
month of his marriage, he found himself wish-
ing and desiring to be rid of the incumbrance
2
## p. 203 (#221) ############################################
JFITZGEORGE. 203
which he had imposed upon himself for life,
would have been sufficient to show him, that
notwithstanding all his advantages of birth,
rank, wealth, and high consideration, he was
quite as much the creature of circumstance as
the lowest of his father's tenants. But as none
are so blind as those who will not see, so none
are so stupid as those who will not learn. It
was by no means suitable to his notions of life,
and his aspirations after unmixed sensual hap-
piness, to admit for a moment that the object
of his pursuit was unattainable, or that he
should do well by changing his course, and
blending with the interests of his soul a little
intellectual and moral ambition. He could not,
and would not bring himself to think lightly of
a well cut coat, or to bear with ordinary pa-
tience the growing enormity of increasing bulk.
Now the three incumbrances with which he
was burdened, were almost too much for his
patience to bear; but hope is elastic as air, and
that rose beneath them. Duns, fat, and matri-

mony, his three tormentors, plagued his spirit,
but did not kill his hopes. He trusted still to
rise superior to these tormentors, yet to enjoy
liberty, extravagance, and a graceful form.
But how to get rid of his wife was the first
consideration. She was now residing under
the same roof as himself, and as yet, that trou-
blesome thing called the world, was not quite
aware of the extent of his alienation, and the
domestic bitterness which annoyed him. Lord
Fitzgeorge, who was never so happy as when
he was acting in masquerade, and cheating the
world of its moral applause, had contrived to
let it be understood, by means of his trusty var-
let Graves, that there had been a little misun-
derstanding between Augustus and his bride,
but that in consequence of the paternal admo-
nitions of his lordship, and the excellent exam-
ple which Fitzgeorge had before in the conduct
of his father and mother, this slight difference
had been completely and effectually removed.
If, therefore, there could be any contrivance by
## p. 205 (#223) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 205
which the blame of separation could be thrown
on Lady Louisa, then Fitzgeorge might have
the happiness of enjoying again his own man-
sion by his own self, or with his own select com-
panions. Mrs. Jernigan, in this matter, might
make herself useful, and even Lady Fitzgeorge,
notwithstanding all her opposition to her son,
had a far greater dislike to her daughter-in-
law, and was, therefore, not unlikely to contri-
bute her assistance to the separation. Lady
Fitzgeorge first hated Louisa because she was
the niece of Lord Fitzgeorge, and next because
she was of an ingenuous and cheerful disposi-
tion, and next because of her attachment to the
captain above alluded to. Lady Fitzgeorge her-
self, having never been in love, could not tole-
rate the existence of love in another, and even
carried her abomination of the passion so far as
to be greatly scandalized at her daughter-in-
law. Lady Fitzgeorge was as proud of her
prudery, as Lord Fitzgeorge was of his piety;
and if her ladyship had any spite against any

of her neighbours, and wished to take away
their good name, she had nothing to do but to
decline receiving their visits, and to give out
that her reasons for so doing were of a delicate
mature, and forthwith all the neighbours set the
rejected one down as being very little better
than she should be.
Fitzgeorge was now eager to enlist his mother
in his quarrel, and to make her an instrument of
his resentment; and for that purpose Mrs. Jer-
mingham was exceedingly serviceable. From
the very moment that Lady Louisa came into
the family, Mrs. Jernigan acted the part of tale-
bearer, carrying all manner of intelligence to
Lady Fitzgeorge, who was in great hopes that
her son's marriage would turn out miserably, so
that she might have the satisfaction of seeing
that Lord Fitzgeorge had not made a good
choice. Mrs. Jernigan had frequently repeated
to Lady Fitzgeorge the remarks of Lady Louisa,
which remarks were not very flattering to the
object of them; and though Lady Fitzgeorge

-FITZGEORGE. 207
had occasionally a slight suspicion that Mrs. Jer-
ningan exaggerated the remarks, and gave them
greater pungency than they were originally de-
signed to possess, yet she directed the full
weight of her resentment against Lady Louisa,
as though the extremity of the language were
really her own.
An opportunity, however, was afforded to
Mrs. Jernigan, or was made by her, to convince
Lady Fitzgeorge that the sentiments and expres-
sions of Louisa had not been misrepresented or
exaggerated. It was of course the practice of
Lady Louisa to write to her friends in the coun-
try occasionally, and it was natural to suppose
that in these letters she would pretty freely
speak her mind concerning the family into which
she had married. As the marriage had been in
a great measure compulsory on the part of her
relatives, she would not of course complain in
very direct terms, knowing that she should have
but little pity or sympathy; but as she was of
a lively turn, she would amuse her distant friends

208 FITZGEORGE.
with her remarks on persons and events that
came under her notice in her new connexion.
"It would be pleasant to see what kind of
letters she writes to her friends. If she speaks
so freely to you, Mrs. Jernigan, she will give her
pen in all probability a greater latitude than her
tongue,"
said Lady Fitzgeorge.
"Lady Louisa," replied Mrs. Jernigan, "does
not make me so much her confidant as to let me
see her letters, but she has so great a partiality
for me, that I think I might be able, if it be
your ladyship's wish, to give you some informa-
tion on the topic." -
"You are a good creature, Jernigan," replied
Lady Fitzgeorge, "if you could manage the
matter cleverly, you would confer an infinite
obligation on me. Of course you can, for you
are one of the most ingenious women I ever
knew."
Mrs. Jernigan was pleased at being compli-
mented for her ingenuity by Lady Fitzgeorge,
and forthwith promised to use her utmost skill.
## p. 209 (#227) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 209
"I think I shall be able to produce to your lady-
ship a copy of one of her letters."
"An original would be more valuable," re-
plied Lady Fitzgeorge.
Mrs. Jernigan looked thoughtful for a mo-
ment, and then exclaimed, "Good, I understand.
You shall have an original; but you must take
especial care that I am neither detected nor sus-
pected; for if I am I shall lose all further power
of communicating any information to your lady-
ship."
As the Fitzgeorge family had a great many
livings in their gift, there was always an abun-
dant supply of parsons dangling about them
waiting for preferment, and ready to perform
any convenient services to recommend themselves
to the dispensers of patronage. A parson who
has nothing to do but to wait for preferment, is
perhaps the idlest of all men; and as idleness
is the parent frequently of mischief, it is very
possible to find clerical hands ready for the per-
formance of many little services which few other

210 FITZGEORGE.
gentlemen would care to undertake. There
happened to be at this time a preferment-hunter
who, for some reason best known to himself,
thought it policy to pay most of his officious
attentions to Lady Fitzgeorge. This gentleman
had sagacity enough to see that Mrs. Jernigan,
though ostensibly the companion and profes-
sedly the friend of Lady Louisa, was in reality
a cunning and crafty tool of Lady Fitzgeorge;
and as preferment-hunters are exceedingly saga-
cious, seeing that hunger is a great sharpener of
the wits, he soon saw that he should be most
likely to obtain his end by means of Mrs. Jer-
nigan. To her, therefore, he paid most assidu-
OuS court.
"It is a long time, Mr. Brown," said Mrs.
Jernigan to the expectant of preferment, "since
you visited your friends in Lancashire."
By this observation, it was inferred by Mr.
Brown that it would be acceptable to Mrs. Jer-
nigan that he should make an excursion into
that county; he therefore replied, "It is my

FITZGEORGE. 211
intention in a few days to go and see my friends
there. Can I execute any commissions for Mrs.
Jerningham 7"
"None, I thank you, sir," replied Mrs. Jer-
nigan, "I mentioned the subject merely perhaps
for want of something else to say."
Two days after this Mr. Brown again pre-
sented himself to Mrs. Jernigan, who suddenly
recollecting herself, exclaimed, "Did I not un-
derstand you, Mr. Brown, a few days ago, to
say that you were meditating a journey into
Lancashire 7 -
"I did say so," replied the reverend gentle-
In all.
"Then you may execute a commission there
for the Lady Louisa, if it will not give you too
much trouble."
"It would give me great pleasure to obey her
ladyship's commands."
"It is merely to convey a packet of letters to
her friends in that county."
"When the letters are ready, I shall be most

happy to take care of them. I receive them, I
presume, through your hands?"
"Oh no," said Mrs. Jernigan, smiling, "not
through my hands, on any account; for should
any accident happennot that such a thing is
at all likely, yet you know there have been such
things, and we cannot be too cautious; Lady
Louisa is exceedingly suspicious, and if by any
accident any letter of hers should fall into im-
proper hands"
"Into improper hands?" said Mr. Brown,
"how can they fall into any but proper hands
if they go by my care into Lancashire, and are
delivered by me in person to her ladyship's
friends there ?"
"Certainly not, certainly not, Mr. Brown,"
replied Mrs. Jernigan, "I was merely mention-
ing a hypothetical case. Suppose for instance
you should lose your luggage on your journey,
and suppose that the letters should fall into the
hands of any person who thought that Lady
Fitzgeorge would be highly gratified with a

FITZGEORGE. 213
sight of them, in short, suppose that any of these
letters should by any means fall into the hands
of Lady Fitzgeorge, who would give almost
any thing to see them, it would be a very
awkward affair if they should be supposed to
come into her possession by my means. I do
not mean to say that Lady Fitzgeorge would be
so indiscreet as to let the secret out herself, but
the letters not being received by the persons to
whom they were directed, there would be some
enquiry set on foot with a view to trace them."
"Very true," replied Mr. Brown, "I will take
especial care that no imputation of neglect shall
fall on you, madam, I myself will receive the
letters from the hands of Lady Louisa, if her
ladyship will be pleased so far to honour me ;
and I will take all the care of them that you
can possibly desire."
Letters were accordingly written by Lady
Louisa, addressed to her friends in Lancashire,
and consigned to the care of the Rev. Mr.
Brown. The reverend gentleman's next concern

214 FITZGEORGE.
was, how to contrive that the letters might reach
their destination. "Shall I be robbed on the
road?" he said to himself; "it is sometimes
very convenient to be robbed; but, unfortunately
in proportion to the convenience of being robbed
is the suspicion of the non-reality of the fact.
Highwaymen are not so abundant as they were,
and they seldom steal trunks. I may put the
letters in my pocket book; but highwaymen
can scarcely know any thing about the curiosity
which Lady Fitzgeorge may have to see the
correspondence of Lady Louisa; and should it
ever be ascertained that the letters have reached
those hands which they ought not to reach,
enquiries may be made which will be mightily
inconvenient to my sacred character and inter-
fere with my preferment. Lady Fitzgeorge
may reward me for betraying another to her;
but if I do the business clumsily, and betray
her ladyship, she must for her own sake sacri-
fice me, and if I cannot get preferment by some
such tricks as these, I shall never get it at all.
## p. 215 (#233) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 215
I will take the advice of the ingenious Mrs.
Jernigan."
Following this determination, the Rev. Mr.
Brown presented himself again to Mrs. Jernigan.
"This is an unfortunate affair," said he, "I
have undertaken to deliver these letters in Lan-
cashire, and now my journey is of necessity
suspended for I know not how long a time.
Shall I return the letters through you to Lady
Louisa, or shall I keep possession of them till
some opportunity may present itself of convey-
ing them to the place of their destination ?"
Mrs. Jerngian laughingly replied, "what you
must do with them I can scarcely advise, but I
know what you must not do with them. You
must not let them find their way into the hands
of Lady Fitzgeorge, who would be so glad to
see them, that if she knew they were in your
keeping, she would give you the best living in
her husband's gift for the possession of them."
"But that of course is quite out of the ques-
tion," said Mr. Brown.
## p. 216 (#234) ############################################
216 FITZGEORGE,
"Of course," replied Mrs. Jernigan.
"I must not be guilty of a breach of trust for
the sake of a living."
"Certainly not," replied Mrs. Jernigan.
"It is to be sure a man's duty to provide for
his family."
"Exactly so," answered Mrs. Jernigan.
"Does Lady Fitzgeorge know that I have
these letters in my possession ?"
"I really cannot tell," answered Mrs. Jerni-
gan, "but I will enquire, and let you know to
morrow."
" Do," replied Mr. Brown, "not that it sig-
nifies any thing."
"Oh no, nothing at all," said Mrs. Jernigan.
On the morrow Mr. Brown and Mrs. Jerni-
gan met again.
"It is the oddest thing in the world," said
Mrs. Jernigan, "but Lady Fitzgeorge, who
seems to know every thing almost by intuition,
has ascertained the fact of your having letters
to carry into Lancashire to Lady Louisa's friends.
## p. 217 (#235) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 217
There is also another very curious coincidence;
the living of little Tippleton happens just now
to be vacant, and how very fortunate it is that
you were not departed on your journey."
"Is it fortunate for me?"
"It may be, if you urge your claims in per-
son, just at this moment. There are many ex-
pectants, and, therefore, the sooner you make
your application the better will be your chance;
I can tell you for your satisfaction, that Lady
Fitzgeorge thinks very highly of your piety and
good principles."
Piety and good principles have different mean-
ings according of course to the notions of the
persons who use the words; in the vocabulary
of Lady Fitzgeorge they stood for one and the
same thing, viz. a servile compliance with her
humours in one who made a profession of reli-
gion.
Mr. Brown forthwith waited on her ladyship.
"You would inculcate good principles, Were
you to be intrusted with the care of the souls of

the good people of little Tippleton," said Lady
Fitzgeorge to the reverend gentleman.
Mr. Brown laid his hand on his heart and
bowed, saying, "I hope and trust, my lady, that
I should ; for I have been initiated and in-
structed in sound principles from my very ear-
liest youth."
"Mr. Brown," said her ladyship with a mar-
vellous quickness of transition, which none but
a person in a very high station could manage,
"you have relations in Lancashire, I think?"
"I have, my lady."
"You will not visit them, I presume, till you
have taken possession of your living. In the
mean time what will you do with the letters
that have been entrusted to your care by my
daughter-in-law'"
"If your ladyship would have the goodness
to take charge of them during my sojourn at
Little Tippleton, they would be in most excel-
lent custody."
## p. 219 (#237) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 219
Lady Fitzgeorge had the goodness to take
care of them; and she had also the goodness to
gratify her own curiosity as to the manner in
which her daughter-in-law was pleased to ex-
press herself to her natural relatives concerning
her legal relatives. There is a proverb about
listeners, which is too well known to need repe-
tition here, the full force of which was verified
by Lady Fitzgeorge in that species of listening
to which she now had recourse. To speak
paradoxically, it may be said that she was by
no means gratified by the gratification of her
curiosity She had some slight suspicion that
Mrs. Jernigan was in the habit of exaggerating
and caricaturing the remarks made by Lady
Louisa, but by these letters it was very manifest
that there had been no ground for such suspi-
cion. Here it appeared under the lady's own
hand, that she entertained a most hearty con-
tempt for that only individual for whom Lady
Fitzgeorge felt the slightest concern or esteem,
viz. Lady Fitzgeorge herself.

down or smoothed over with the varnish of
flattery, nor in the delineation was there an
exaggeration that might have been some satis-
action, enabling her to say that the description
was alc, but it was most intolerably correct
and insultingly true.
Now did her Ladyship almost wish that she

had not indulged her curiosity. It had recoiled
upon herself in deep mortification, and she was
angry even beyond the power of self-command.
Offensive as was the language of her daughter's
letter, yet she read it again and again; and
thought at last that the living of little Tippleton
was a dear price at which to purchase such a
bitter draught. Her anger was now no longer
against Louisa as the niece of Lord Fitzgeorge
preferred to her own, but it was deeply and per-
sonally against the individual, and she medi-
tated all manner of revenge. Poor Mr. Brown,
who had been rewarded for his treachery with
the living of little Tippleton, was left to extri-
cate himself from the reproach as well as he
could; but he made a very clumsy hand of it,
and instead of getting himself out of the scrape
he blundered so much that he brought Mrs.
Jernigan into the scrape.
Lady Fitzgeorge had not sufficient temper or
discretion to conceal from her daughter-in-law
the fact of her knowledge of the contents of

her letter. She behaved still more harshly and
rudely to the unprotected Louisa, and became
almost reconciled to her son in order that she
might the more effectually persecute her daugh-
ter-in-law.
When a quiet and orderly person who has
been brought up in the habits of external
decorum is by any accident led to walk
through the streets which are occupica by
the humblest, the poorest, and the dirtiest of
the sons and daughters of men, his ears are
often assailed and his feelings are sadly shocked
by the language of loud vituperation and by the
sight of fierce and violent personal encounters.
He sees, perhaps, two of that sex called gentle,
miscalled, it seems, in that instance, flying at
each other in a marvellous fury, tearing each
others caps and long matted hair, scratching
and rendering more hideous each others already
sufficiently hideous faces, and demeaning them-
selves like furies. At the melancholy sight he
lifts up his orderly hands and turns up his quiet

eyes wondering that there can exist such de-
mons in human form, and praising himself and
kindred that they are not constructed of such
flesh and blood: yet, peradventure, he forgets
that corresponding diversities of interest and
divarications of taste, produce as much ill-
blood among those who, by habit and educa-
tion are interdicted from this rapid and com-
pendious mode of getting rid of their evil
feelings. In them the feeling rankles, festers,
worries and torments for weeks, months, years:
but they who by action get rid of the evil feel-
ing are presently friends again, drink gin toge-
ther, mend their caps, and suffer their hair to
grow again, which it does without the aid of
Maccassar oil. There is certainly a great dif-
ference between those quarrels which come to
blows and bruises, and those which are only
manifested by shrugs and grimaces, by hard
words and stupid letters;but the only differ-
ence is in their duration. There is a similarity
of evil feeling, there is a similarity of annoy-

ance, and there is a similarity of disgrace in the
eye of reason, though not in the eye of fashion.
Nay, further, we will venture to say that had
Lady Fitzgeorge and Lady Louisa had a regular
set-to, and had they fought their quarrel to its
very dregs, it would have been better for them
both in the long run.
It was now evident to Louisa that there was
not only no chance for happiness, but no hope
of being ever treated with common civility by
the Fitzgeorge family; therefore she made all
haste to solicit from her heartless and polite
husband some arrangement by which she might
be able to avoid altogether, any intercourse with
those from whom she could expect nothing but
insult. It was not long before this application
for separation from her husband, that Louisa
had given birth to a daughter. Generally in
families where there are titles and estates to
transmit to an heir, the birth of a son is more
desired than that of a daughter; but in the
present instance, as Fitzgeorge entertained some

FITZ GEORGE, 225
vague hopes of an ultimate divorce, he was not
sorry that a daughter was born. This gave
him some ground of expectation that another
wife might be the mother of his heir. Gladly,
therefore, did he receive the proposal of more
complete separation than one house, however
large, could afford him. He was not ordinarily
very polite to his wife, how much he might be
so to the rest of the world, but on the present
occasion he wrote her a remarkably civil note,
and gave her the choice of any residence, and
proposed a very handsome settlement.
The arrangements were soon completed and
they parted.

FitzGeoRGE was now himself again. The
gloom was dispersed from his brow, and the
spectre which had haunted one half of his house
was laid, and though not sent to the red sea,
where, with his right good will, it might have
been, yet sufficiently was it out of his way to
leave him master of his own house. Without
being aware of it, he had learned one lesson
from his troubles and annoyances; he had
learned that there may be some enjoyment,
even where a man cannot have everything his
own way, and that there is a great pleasure in

getting rid of a grievance. There was, in his
present circumstances and condition, quite -
enough to disturb and annoy him, and to form
a fruitful topic of moody meditation; dums
were yet surrounding him, corpulency was yet
increasing; Mr. Graves still carried himself
haughtily, and time was advancing with rapid
pace, destroying the symptoms of youth, and
bringing the mournful manifestations of increas-
ing years. But, for the present, Fitzgeorge was
comparatively happy, his wife was out of his
way; his house was his own, he could enjoy
the pleasure of surveying its manifold decora-
tions, and contemplating still farther improve-
ments.
Now came his friends about him. Happy
the man who has a well furnished mansion, and
a well appointed table ! He is never at a loss
for friends. If his cellars are filled with wine,
which needs only to be drunk and praised, his
friends are ready at his bidding to perform this
pleasing duty. Is he fond of the sight of happy

faces? he may make them happy with the sight
of "every delicacy that the season affords."
Has he splendid plate, which is only valuable
as it is admired by his guests? it may be made
very valuable by most abundant admiration.
Forgetting for a while the many unpleasant
circumstances which still were about him,
Fitzgeorge assembled his friends, and they
were merry with a most obstreperous joy.
The bacchanalian orgies of an utter sensua-
list, who was parted from his wife in deep
disgust, and who gathers about him his obse-
quious friends and witty flatterers, in order to
enjoy a triumph, may perhaps be imagined,
and may also be described, but imagination
cannot easily reach the full height of Fitz-
george's festive glory, and description, in order
to be decent, must fall short of the truth. It
may be imagined that Sir Nicholas Bobadil,
who was an incarnation of the genius of perfu-
mery, and who seemed to live merely to make
humanity humble, by shewing to that superb

excess of foolery foppery may be carried, was
eloquent according to the utmost of his power
and the peculiarity of his genius, on this happy
occasion.
"I saw the case was hopeless from the first,"
said he, "it was absolutely impossible that a
woman who could demean herself so far as to
laugh aloud, and to drink a whole glass of Ma-
deira at one sitting, could ever breathe under
the same roof with Augustus Fitzgeorge. You
must really have suffered a martyrdom in her
society."
"But I have survived it," said Fitzgeorge.
"Yet," replied Bobadil, "it has had a mani-
fest effect upon your spirits. You have lost
flesh."
"Lost flesh!" exclaimed Fitzgeorge. "Make
me to think so fifty years to come."
"You are indebted for the separation, if re-
port speak truly," said the Rev. Mr. Bradley,
"to your worthy lady-mother."
"And 'tis the only act of civility I have re-

ceived from her since I was born," answered
Fitzgeorge.
"I was thinking then," said Bradley, "that
you were parted very properly, for it was no
man that put you asunder. There is not a word
said against woman putting married people
asunder."
"If men, or women, had no other sins to an-
swer for than putting married people asunder,"
replied Fitzgeorge, "they would be very inno-
cent creatures."
"Bradley," exclaimed Borrowman, "you, as
a parson, have been at many wedding parties,
but I dare to say that you have never been at
any wedding party so agreeable as this un-
wedding party."
"Sir," said Mr. Bradley, with an air of af-
fected gravity, "my profession leads me into
grave scenes for the most part; I seldom have
the pleasure of seeing the mischief that I do in
church, undone out of church."
"But the mischief that has been done in

church, has not, in the present instance, been
totally undone," said Fitzgeorge.
"It may be," said Colonel Fitzmaurice, "if
your stars should be propitious."
Fitzgeorge thought seriously and meditated
deeply on this expression. It embodied his
own wishes, and reflected his own thoughts.
"Yes," said he to himself when he was left
alone, "Fitzmaurice is right, the mischief may
be undone if my stars be propitious; and the
best method to ensure their being propitious, is
to make them so. There is but one effectual
mode of getting rid of the incumbrance alto-

power. Friends, as they are called, are strange
beings, apparently useful but really useless.
Some of mine are as servile as spaniels, while
they feel themselves dependent on me; but the
moment that I should become dependent on
them, they would change their nature and sub-
stitute insolence for fawning. Is there any real
friendship in the world? Is human nature ca-
pable of that generosity which moral writers
call friendship. My friend Leppard is an ad-
mirer of Cicero; he admires amongst the other
writings of the sophistical Roman, the Treatise
on Friendshipbut is Leppard himself, with
all his apparent honesty and candour, really my
friend in the truest and highest sense of the
word? I recollect what Sallust says of friend-
ship or puts into the mouth of some orator

ristia est:'Have I such a friend as this? Did
not Leppard reproach me and almost insult me,

that made me feel humbled and mortified Am
I a friend to any one? Am I prepared to
sacrifice any thing to another's advantage or
convenience?And yet I talk of friendship
I press my friends' hands most cordially, I
affect to open my heart to them;-I entertain
them splendidly, but it is true that my en-
joyment in the entertainments to which I invite
them is, in fact, in their admiration of the
splendour which surrounds me. It is for
my pleasure, not for theirs, that I call them
to my table; it is that they may see and
admire the superb appointments of my esta-
blishment. I give them choice wines that they
may drink and applaud, it is not to please their
palates with the flavour of the wine, but to
please my own ear by the language of their
commendation. I am a friend only to myself, and
I suppose that is the case with all the rest of
the world. Why do these people come round
me? Is it for my sake, or is it for their own.

It is not for what I am, but for what I have. I
honour them by my notice; they are proud of
my acquaintance and of the consequence which
it gives them in the eye of the world. Should I
sink down into a state of humiliation and con-
tempt, where and what would they be then?
They would act perhaps as under similar cir-
cumstances I should act myself. They would
leave me. If I were to exchange this mansion
for an ill-furnished cottage, and should have
no more splendid entertainments whereunto I
might invite them, would they not leave me?
And if another were to come into my room, to
possess my estates and mansion, and titles and
expectations, they that are now my friends
would be his, if he would let them. I have
learnt something of life, I have read not in vain
some few chapters in the great volume of hu-
man nature, and I learn the hollowness of
names and words that fill the mouths of men
with great sounds, and make them imagine
that their minds are occupied with ideas. Still,

after all that we can say, the word friend has
its uses. We must have around us those people
whom we call friends, in order that by their
means we may befriend and benefit ourselves.
Those who call themselves my friends, are those
who use me for their own advantage; and I also
calling them my friends, use them for my own
advantage. But there is not one whom I can
trust with a secret that they may be able to use
against me. I must, however, use my ingenuity
to get rid of my incumbrance. 'Tis well she has
left my roof; there is a double advantage in it.
I am no more pestered with the unpleasant
thought that she dwells in the same house with
me, and I may be able to raise an accusation
against her which I could not with any plausi-
bility while she was dwelling in the house with
me. There is no male friend whom I can trust.

ners and liveliness of disposition. Away from
this house she must and will have society, and
none of those who associate with me will asso-
ciate with her. She must seek new acquaint-
ance; but while I am the fashion and opposed
to her, all people of fashion will avoid her so-
ciety as a pestilence, and will not dare counten-
ance her. Then she must have recourse to in-
ferior people, to people of no name or fashion;
these vulgar people will be proud of the honour
of an intimacy with the wife of Fitzgeorge, even
though a spurned and despised wife. Pleased
with the honour of her society, they will make
themselves agreeable to her; they will boast of
their intimacy; they will exaggerate the fami-
liarity with which they may be treated into
freedom, and freedom may be exaggerated into
any thing. Yes, yes; I have about me friends
who are looking forward to the time when I
shall possess the title and estates of Lord Fitz-
george;they think that I shall then be useful
to them, and therefore they will now be useful

to me. After all the parade and talk of friend-
ship, is not an interested friend more serviceable
than a disinterested one? A disinterested friend
acts merely on caprice, an interested one we are
sure of; he acts for his own sake, and will for
his own sake go through thick and thin to serve
whom he calls his friend. Need I tell such
friends what I wish 2 No; they can guess, if
they have any sagacity, and selfish people are
generally very sagacious. They will know that
stories to the disrepute of my wife will be agree-
able to me, because such stories will vindicate
me in the separation, and help to beguile the
world of an opinion that I did not part with her
from the levity of caprice. And when it is seen
that these stories are greedily received, they
will of course be multipled and increased till,
for the sake of decency, it will be said there
must be some investigation. Let that investi-
gation terminate as it may, it will and must
leave a suspicion, a stain, a moral weakness in
the reputation, which may afterwards be pro-

fitably applied to the purpose of procuring me
a complete emancipation from these trammels
of matrimony."
Such were the thoughts which occupied and
pleased the mind of the Honourable Augustus
Fitzgeorgethoughts not very honourable to
himself, not flattering to human nature, or com-
plimentary to those whom he was pleased to
call his friends. These thoughts were the na-
tural consequence of his selfish and sensual
character, and sprung from the habit in which
he had always indulged himself, of gratifying,
at whatever expense to others, any caprice which
took possession of his mind. The element which
enters most largely into the composition of the
brute animal, rendering it most terrible and fe-
rocious, is sensuality; and man then comes
nearest to the brute when regardless of every
thing but his own selfish sensuality, he lives
and acts in society. But in a state of civilized
society there are certain restrictions which rather
act as veils to conceal than as chains to bind.

The violence is not visible, but the recklessness
is the same. Around the wild beast's den there
lie, bleaching in the sun, the dry bones of his
many victimsterrible, odious sight! But no
eye sees the broken hearts which the sensual
and the selfish man leaves in the track of his
walk through life. A story is told of the ghosts
of the drug-slaughtered patients of a physician
haunting and hovering about his door;-if there
could be any visible representation of the wretch-
edness occasioned by sensuality and selfishness,
the doors of many a proud mansion would pre-
sent as hideous a sight as the mouth of the wild
beast's den, or the haunted doors of a physician
in full practice.
Sensuality also brings man to a similarity
with a wild beast, inasmuch as when the sensual
man is thwarted and opposed, he regards those
who stand in his way, be it intentionally
or unintentionally, in the light of personal
enemies, to be removed at all events and at
any cost; being thwarted, the sensual man be-

comes furious, and if the state of society will
not allow him to exhibit his fury strongly and
definitely, he cherishes it darkly in his soul,
and it produces its fruits surely, though not
noisily.
Fitzgeorge now found that he had yet attained
but part of his object in ridding himself of the
presence of his wife. It was, indeed a fashion
with a certain class, but not with all who were
of the fashionable world, to take part with the
husband against the discarded wife. There
still existed a numerous party, at the head
of whom was Lord Fitzgeorge himself, who
took up the cause of the Lady Lousia.-
Many were the messages which were sent
from his lordship, and many were the ne
gociations entered into to produce a reconci-
liation, but all to no purpose. All the logic
and persuasion in the world could not bring
Augustus to love one whom he did not love,
for logic has nothing to do with love, and per-
suasion can never reach the affections. But
## p. 241 (#259) ############################################

all these things were an increasing trouble to
him, haunting him amidst all his pleasures,
and bringing to his mind the reluctantly re-
ceived conviction, that no care or carelessness
can make any thing of life than a mingled cup,
a succession of alternations of joy and sor-
sow, of light and shade. Against this convic-
tion he still struggled, and he made the ruins
of his former schemes the foundation of new
hopes.
Miserable is the man who has nothing to do
but to enjoy himself; for in having this to do, he
has every thing to do, and does nothing. Eter-
mal holiday is no holiday, and perpetual feasting
is as great a nuisance as perpetual fasting.
There is scarcely one man in a thousand who
knows the theory of appetite; and Fitzgeorge
was certainly not that one. We smile
at the wish of the ploughboy, who eating
his hasty meal of bacon, and swinging on a
gate, wished that he was a king that he
might have nothing to do but to eat fat

bacon and swing upon a gate all day long.
Poor simple cub he forgot that the sweetness
of the bacon and the swinging gate was the
honey which he had been gradually collecting
through many an hour of sweating toil. Equally
simple was the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge
when he cherished the vain idea of life perpe-
tually, and unceasingly, and uninterruptedly
enjoyed. Had he given himself closely and
diligently to business of any kind, and to a
voluntary mental exercise, he might have found
some appetite and relish for the many means
of enjoyment with which he was surrounded;
but he wished to have the pleasure of rest
without the labour of exercise. He wished to
have appetite without abstinence, ends without
means, the apprehension of beauty without the
contrast of deformity, the enjoyment of har-
mony without the annoyance of discord. He
wished for a life of holiday and festivity, and
to enjoy every hour as intensely as the gene-
rality of mankind enjoy a few peculiarly bright

hours, which are bright only by contrast. Na-

CHAPTER XI.
The DISCARDED WIFE.
As Fitzgeorge foresaw, so it came to pass'
The Lady Louisa, though dismissed from her
husband's roof, and thus publicly advertised as
the object of his insuperable disgust and aver-
sion, did not sit down in quiet and dejected
seclusion, sorrowing in deep despair, but endea-
voured to make life pass as cheerfully as might
be under all circumstances Many there were
who regarded the lady as injured and cruelly
treated; but as Fitzgeorge had a very consider-
able influence in the fashionable world, by vir-
tue of his high rank, and his taste in the shape

and colour of coats, the more noisy and prating
part of the world of fashion sided with him.
Moreover, as the very essence of fashion is
affectation of one kind or another, and as Lady
Louisa had not in the composition of her mind
and character, the slightest admixture of affect-
ation, she was, of course, essentially and un-
questionably unfashionable, and a being who is
unfashionable meets with no more sympathy in
the fashionable world than a negro among the
white people of New York. While, therefore,
the common people, and those who were im-
posed upon by the piety of Lord Fitzgeorge,
regarded the Lady Louisa as a persecuted and
insulted woman, the great majority of fashion-
able people thought that she was so unfashion-
able as to deserve every insult which could be
offered to her. -
There was also another species of hostility
against her, not loud but deep. Those of the
gentler sex who had preferred the fascinations
of Fitzgeorge's smiles to their own good names

and reputation, and who had been jealous of
her first introduction into the family of Fitz-
george, were now but too happy to exercise
their little wits in finding out means of annoying
and degrading the rejected wife of Fitzgeorge.
Peculiarly well calculated were they for the
dirty work which they undertook; they well
understood how to manage insinuations, and to
spread suspicions:they were not at any loss
in the devising any corroborative circumstances;
they were apt in invention, and were not scru-
pulous in affirming any thing which had no
other foundation than their fancy or wishes.
They themselves, of course, had no access to
the society of Lady Louisa, but they had the
means and the meanness to influence those that
had. They were in the frequent habit, also,
of asking questions concerning her, and that
of such a nature as to indicate what kind of
answer they wished to receive. Thus, by de-
grees, undefined reports got into circulation,
indefinite accusations were raised against her,
## p. 247 (#265) ############################################
.FITZGEORGE. 247
and thus the public mind was prepared to re-
ceive some serious charge, and to believe what-
ever might be injuriously asserted concerning
her.
The perfection of malignant charge and ca-
lumnious report is in the indefiniteness of the
earliest statements. The beginning of the mis-
chief must have no shape or feature; for if a
distinct charge be made, it may be refuted
besides, there are certain charges which cannot
be brought, unless against characters previously
injured and tarnished. Partly, perhaps, it was
the result of intention, and partly was it the
accident of situation that the first whispers of
calumny against the fair name and good repute
of the Lady Louisa were of an indefinite nature.
The friends of Fitzgeorge were not slow in learn-
ing his wishes, nor were they reluctant to gratify
them according to the best of their power.
Nothing could be easier than to repeat the story
that Lady Louisa had had an attachment pre-
vious to her marriage; it was also easy enough
## p. 248 (#266) ############################################
248 FITZGEORGE.
to say, nor was it altogether untrue, that the
proposal for actual separation was first explicitly
made by her. On this ground it was no hard
task for inventive genius to base a suspicion
that the separation was desired by the lady
with a view to a wider liberty of conduct. Be-
fore, therefore, her new establishment was well
arranged and settled, the idle gossipers and
brainless prigs of the fashionable world, who
dressed their heads both inside and out before
the mirror of the Honourable Augustus Fitz-
george, sneered forth the foulness of their dirty
suspicions, and prepared, by their lying insinua-
tions, the canvass whereon was afterwards to be
drawn a picture of moral depravity.
Banished from her husband's house and
society, it was left to Louisa to choose between
actual solitude or the accidental association
with her new and unknown neighbours. She
chose the latter. Residing in one of the villa-
gemmed regions, which surround the metropolis,
and where titles were comparatively scarce, she
## p. 249 (#267) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 249
was regarded with some attention and respect
by her neighbours. The natural freedom of
manner which had been a distinguishing fea-
ture in her character from the very earliest of
her conscious being, rather invited than repelled
familiarity, and soon she was intimate with
many, who were far her inferiors in rank, man-
ners, and attainments. In this, however, there
was comparatively little evil; but it became
afterwards matter of more than inconvenience
that she gave them her confidence before she
was aware of their character. Many remarks
have been made on the shyness and reserve of
the English character, of the slowness with
which acquaintances are made, and the sus-
picion with which strangers are regarded. There
is a degree of usefulness in this reserve, which
is, no doubt, a natural instinct by which the
species is led to guard against the ill conse-
quences of indiscreet familiarity. We were
about to observe, that it might have been well
for Louisa had she been more deeply aware of

the value of this reserve; but we suspend the
observation upon reconsidering the matter, be-
cause it was resolved to calumniate and destroy
her, and no caution or circumspection in the
world could save her from the effect of a multi-
tudinous conspiracy.
As the interest of this romance turns mainly
on this present point of the situation of the dis-
carded wife and the gradual development of the
conspiracy against her, it may be necessary here
to define more particularly and minutely what
express ideas are attached to the term "con-
spiracy." It is not to be supposed that the
word is here used as expressive of that kind of
conspiracy in which men engage for the per-
petration of some foul treason, when the con-
spirators meet together in serious conclave and
lay their deep designs, or arrange the part
which each is destined to perform in the dread-
ful tragedy there was, perhaps, in this con-
spiracy against the discarded wife no direct
deliberation among the conspirators, no meeting

FITZGEORGE. 251
or organisation,--but it was a conspiracy of im-
plication. It was understood by very slight
intimations, that certain accusations against her
would be very acceptable in a certain quarter.
it was first, of course, supposed, that one who
was spurned by Fitzgeorge could not, with any
propriety or consistency, be admired by the
friends of Fitzgeorge. Then, as the great and
the opulent regard as friends those only who
minister to their caprices and humours, the
diners at Fitzgeorge's table made a point of
ascertaining what degree of calumny he would
enjoy against his discarded wife. They soon
perceived that there was no accusation too gross
to be acceptable, and that he who should be
most severe on the character of the lady was
most agreeable. It was of course supposed,
that when Fitzgeorge had, in spite of all expos-
tulation, negociation and reproof persisted in
separating from his wife, he could not be very
desirous that she should continue to be his
wife, if it were possible that she should cease to
## p. 252 (#270) ############################################
252 FitzGEORGE.
be so. They also knew that there was but
one way by which a legal separation could be
effected, and seeing that it was so earnestly
desired, they acted accordingly.
Now even on the supposition that Lady Louisa
had been aware of this virtual conspiracy against
her, and had she really apprehended the full
extent of the base servility of these cubs of
fashion, who, for fashion's sake, would invent
almost any lie, and would well nigh believe the
falsehoods which themselves invented, she could
not, by any means whatever, have defended her-
self against them. She might have shut herself
up in the solitude of her own mansion, refusing
all society, dismissing every male attendant,
never suffering herself to be seen by the world,
and relying only on the help of female domes-
tics, even then calumny would have been
ready with its plausible tale, and the hungry
dependence of lazy sycophaney would have
exerted its ingenuity to devise some base report,
with which the goose-like gabble of the fashion-

able world would have filled the public ear and
have gulled the public credulity. Easily could
the scandal dealers, male and female, have sent
forth a sly rumour that this privacy was only
affected in order to be secure from interruption,
and easily would the prurient imagination of
the dirty traducers have found some gallant
Lothario as the companion of the lady's soli-
tude. The very petticoats of her female domes-
tics would have been construed into the dis-
guises of favoured lovers; and some butcher's-
boy, carrying mutton for the consumption of the
family, would have been accused of adorning
the brows of Fitzgeorge with other ornaments
than laurel.
It was, in fact, as impossible for the discarded
wife of Fitzgeorge to escape suspicion and ac-
cusation, as it was for a wife of Henry VIII.,
when brought before the judge, to escape the
executioner. There was no mode of life by
which Lady Louisa could have possibly de-
fended herself against the dark conspiracy which
## p. 254 (#272) ############################################
254 FitzGeorce.
gathered round her. In society or in solitude,
free or reserved, confident or suspicious, it was
all the same;therefore it can hardly be said
that she was unfortunate in bestowing her con-
fidence too unreservedly on some low people who
happened to be her neighbours. Among these
there was one particular couple of retired shop-
keepers, who, by virtue of their retirement, had
taken it into their heads to be mighty genteel.
They were profoundly ignorant, profoundly
stupid, grossly arrogant, and excessively con-
ceited; they rejoiced in the name of Simkin.
They paid their respects to Lady Louisa, when
she first came to reside in their neighbourhood;
and she, regardless of any evil, and overlooking
their vulgarity and stupidity, returned their call.
This was an honour which, with all their con-
ceit, they hardly expected, and by which their
weak heads were almost turned. They ventured
to invite the lady to their table, and she accepted
their invitation. Mr. Simkin was a man who
reverenced rank, he scarcely knew why; but at
## p. 255 (#273) ############################################
PITZGEORGE. 255
the same time, as he was pretty well to do in
the world, as the saying is, he thought himself
as good as any body; and so, perhaps, he was
in one point of view; for it requires a balance
as fine as gold scales to ascertain the difference,
if there be any at all, between a fashionable and
an unfashionable booby. Lady Louisa, having
no affectation in her constitution, and having
been thoroughly disgusted with the heartless
and transparent affectations of supreme polite-
ness, felt some little relief in the humorous and
clumsy gentility of the Simkin family. Mr.
Simkin was one of those shrewd persons, who,
having just wit enough to feather their own
nests, fancy themselves competent to any of the
exertions of wit or developments of intellect;
and Mrs. Simkin was one of those discerning
women who have just wit enough to admire
their husband's wisdom and to reverence his com-
mercial success. They had left the shop, they
had sunk the shop, they despised the shop.
Mr. Simkin, according to his own notion of the
## p. 256 (#274) ############################################
256 FitzGeorge.
matter, was, as all the world knew, a much
greater man than he appeared to be. It is true
that he was plain Mr. Simkin, but then he had
refused the honour of knighthood, or he might
have been Sir Samuel Simkin, knight. He de-
spised, however, an honour that he could not
transmit to his posterity. It is true that he had
no posterity, but it was impossible to say what
might happen. Mr. Simkin, therefore, was a
great man; for though below knighthood in
rank, he was above it in spirit. Mrs. Simkin
also was great in proportion to her husband's
greatness, and bore with exemplary resignation
the loss of the title of lady.
When this retired couple made their first ap-
proaches of civility and compliment to the Lady
Louisa, it was, as we have already intimated,
with much doubt and distrust. Moreover it
was with a mighty degree of formality. Seeing,
however, that her ladyship, being wearied with
the formalities of high life in which she had
experienced so much disgust and disappoint-
## p. 257 (#275) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 257
ment, now felt relieved by the relaxation of
plainer manners and more inartificial intercourse,
the Simkins felt marvellously elated by her con-
descension; and while they looked on them-
selves much more highly, they regarded her
ladyship with less respect, in consequence of
that very condescension which was all their
pride and glory. Thus it is when great folks
condescend to little ones; the little ones are not
content that the great should come down to
their own level, but seek to drive them below it,
and treat them insolently because they are al-
lowed to treat them familiarly; for they do not
understand the respectfulness of courtesy, there-
fore they think that civility is homage which
they spurn to pay.
It is impossible to say what kind of beha-
viour on the part of Lady Louisa would have
stopped the calumnious tongues of the friends
of Fitzgeorge, because they themselves did not
know. It was their cue to detect error, to dis-
cover impropriety of demeanour, to find some-

thing whereon to ground suspicion. They were
of course ready to turn every thing into the
means of accusation and reproach. But they
were crafty enough to commence with reproach
before they proceeded to accusation. Fitzgeorge,
who had now lived some years in the world,
and who was approaching that wide level called
the middle of life, was of course much nearer to
the inheriting of the titles and estates of Lord
Fitzgeorge than he was when the friends of his
youth first came about him; therefore his friends
were more numerous and more friendly, more
diligent in discovering his humours and com-
plying with them. They did not want to be
told in so many words, that he wished to get
rid of the incumbrance of a wife whom he had
only married for the sake of money. Knowing
also that by this marriage he had not obtained
quite so much money as he had anticipated and
as he desired, and that in all probability if he
could obtain a divorce he might get an addition
to his fortune by another marriage, the natural,

and with such persons the almost unavoidable
course of his friends, was to do, say and invent
all in their power to procure and promote a di-
vorce. It was therefore their policy to begin
with reproach, and with the indefiniteness of
general censure, before they attempted any
thing in the express and tangible form of accu-
sation. The Simkins were just the people to
assist them;-vain, stupid, ignorant, heartless,
arrogant and aspiring, they were ready to say
all, and more than all, that they knew concern-
ing the sayings and doings of Louisa. They
of course were watched, pumped, and waylaid.
In order, however, first to prepare the public
mind, rumours were circulated and reproaches
were uttered. It was objected against the un-
fortunate and friendless woman, that she was of
exceedingly coarse and vulgar mind, that she
was much more at home in the society of such
low-minded, vulgar people as the Simkin
family than she had been at the house and with
the family of Fitzgeorge;to be sure she was;

she never could have been at home with polished,
but with obviously hostile relatives. The sneer,
the forced civility, the ill-concealed disgust
which were the daily annoyance of her life in
the mansion of Fitzgeorge, could not contribute
to attach her to a home like that. Mr. and
Mrs. Simkin could not bear the reproach of
vulgarity, they thought foul scorn of those fas-
tidious creatures who could call them vulgar,
and they soon found that Lady Louisa herself
was as vulgar as they were. And if by any
accident, for accidents will happen, though not
often so well to be accounted for as theseif
there happened by any accident to be an emis-
sary of a friend of Fitzgeorge in company with
Mr. or Mrs. Simkin, then the said Mr. or
Mrs. Simkin, as the case might be, was easily
abstracted for a time from the rest of the party,
and there easily commenced, and pleasantly
proceeded, some such interesting dialogue as
the following:
"So, Mrs. Simkin, you have the honour of
## p. 261 (#279) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 261
entertaining at your table the celebrated Lady
Louisaa lady of great elegance of manner and
refinement of mind."
Now as Mrs. Simkin is not a little conceited
of the elegance of her own manner, and the re-
finement of her own mind, she puts on her fine
lady airs, and replies, "Why, madam, if you
come to that, as the saying is, to talk about
elegance and refinement, I can't say much for
her ladyshipshe is a good sort of woman, no
doubt."
"O yes, very good of course, or so superior a
man as Fitzgeorge would never have banished
her from his house."
Mrs. Simkin could not resist such logic as
this, and having just penetration enough to
fathom its irony, she replies, "Ah, very true, as
you say, a good sort of woman; every body is
good, you know, till they are found out."
"Lady Louisa, I suppose, is very good com-
pany at table; has a very good appetite, I have
understood."
## p. 262 (#280) ############################################
262 FITZGEORGE.
Mrs. Simkin immediately understands that it
is altogether abominable and utterly unfashion-
able to have a good appetite, and she thereupon.
screws up her mouth into the smallest possible
compass, as though she could only be fed
through a quill, and says" Appetite Oh,
prodigious ! I declare to you, madam, 'tis as
true as you sit there, that Lady Louisa will eat
as much at a meal as would serve me and Mr.
Simkin for a week, and yet I reckon Mr. S. a
good trencher-man, that is for a gentleman"
for Mrs. Simkin was not quite certain whether
gentlemen might not be permitted by the laws
of fashion to eat.
"And pray, Mrs. Simkin, is it true, as I have
heard it whispered in the first circles, that Lady
Louisa actually drinks?"
"Drinks 1" exclaims Mrs. Simkins.
"Yes, madam, drinks: for I have often heard
it said, that at table with the Hon. Augustus
Fitzgeorge, she has been known to drink a
whole glass of Madeira at once."
## p. 263 (#281) ############################################
FitzGEd RGE. 263
"The word Madeira drove the word glass out
of Mrs. Simkin's head and substituted bottle,
and she replied, "A whole bottle of Madeira!
Well, very likely. I am sure I have often been
astonished at the quantity she drinks."
The latter part of this sentence is heard at
the tables where some of the party are playing
at cards, and they write down on the tablet of
their memory, "She drinks."
"Her conversation, I apprehend," says the
inquirer, "is not very refined."
"Not at all," replics Mrs. Simpkin, who
thought of course that her own conversation
was excessively refined.
"You cannot repeat any of it, I presume."
This was rather too bad for Mrs. Simkin,
who is not yet quite so far gone as to repeat the
conversation, and who by the way had not me-
mory for the purpose, even supposing an incli-
nation; she therefore replies with a little bit, a
very little bit of virtuous indignation" Repeat
her conversation | Not for the world." This

also was heard by those who were playing at
cards, and immediately it is registered in their
memories, that the conversation of Lady Louisa
at the table of Mrs. Simkin, is such as no mo
dest woman can possibly repeat. Thereupon
the rumour flies far and wide, and every body is
talking very loudly of the sad irregularities of
the life of her ladyship. Intemperance in eat-
ing and drinking are setdown as undoubted facts
seriously charged, and beyond all question esta-
blished against her ladyship, and then, further-
more, her conversation is represented as being
so gross, that Mrs. Simkin cannot possibly re-
peat it.
Such is the progress of rumour, and so ra-
pidly does it circulate, that some of this talk,
in an exaggerated form, reaches the ears of the
domestic servants in the establishment of Lady
Louisa, and some one of them thinks it a duty
to inform her ladyship of it, in terms as soft and
delicate as may be.
"Is persecution reaching me even in my retire-
## p. 265 (#283) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 265
ment and comparative solitude" exclaims
Louisa, "I must be more on my guard with
these simple people. My words must be mea-
sured, and my looks must be regulated. It
would be absurd to quarrel with them, for that
would be to make them of too much importance."
So the Lady Louisa continued to accept the
civilities of Mr. and Mrs. Simkin, but would no
longer wear the look of unrestrained ease and
cheerfulness, and would no longer indulge in the
slightest degree of vivacity of conversation.
There was then a degree of coldness in her
manner, and of formality in her deportment.
She refused not their invitations, nor did she
exhibit any decided or marked symptoms of
having been offended; but the great difference
in her demeanour was, that where there had
been freedom there was now restraint, where
there had been an unchecked laugh there was
now a gentle smile.
Mr. and Mrs. Simkin did not like the change,

they could not divine its cause, and they as-
cribed it to the lady's pride.
"She needs not carry her head so high, me-
thinks," said Mrs. Simkin to her ready listening
spouse, "for though she is called lady, there
are many persons in the fashionable world called
plain Mrs., who are of much greater consequence
and fashion than she is."
"Yes, my dear," replied Mr. Simkin, "and
you might have been called my lady, but now-
a-days there are so many upstart, ignorant,
vulgar creatures bedecked with titles, that it
has become really an honour to be plain Mr.
and Mrs."
"Between ourselves Mr. Simkin, or enter noo,
as the French say, I am of opinion that there
are many persons bearing the title of lady, who
are not much better than those who have no
titles; no, nor half so good neither. Bless me,
Mr. S., do you think that such a nice man as
the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge would
banish a wife from his house, if there was not

FITZGEORGE. 267
some good reason for it;-and besides, all the
fashionable world, whose opinions are worth
any thing, say that a certain person who shall
be nameless, is not much better than she should
be. I heard as much myself from a very ele-
gant lady of high rank in the fashionable world."
"Very likely, Mrs. Simkin, my dear, you are
a woman of great penetration; and now you
mention it, I begin to recollect a great many
sayings of this Lady Louisa, which did not
strike me much at the time, but which certainly
indicate something wrong. We will be on the
look out."
"So we will, my dear," replied Mrs. Simkin,
"but will Augustus Fitzgeorge be altogether
pleased if we take away his wife's character?"
"Pleased my sweet love," responded Mr.
Simkin, "nothing would please him better.
Is it not as clear as light that he hates his wife?
And would he not be glad to get rid of her at
any rate?"
"But would he like to be disgraced ?
N 2
## p. 268 (#286) ############################################
268 FitzGEORGE.
" Disgraced ?" answered the loving Mr.
Simkin, "he would think nothing of the dis-
grace. People in high life care nothing about
disgrace, so long as they may have their hu-
mours indulged and their caprices gratified.
He might, perhaps, not be partial to that mode
of getting rid of his wife, but he would undergo
that, or almost any thing, rather than not get
liberated."
22
"Yes, my dear love," replied Mrs. Simkin,
" and he would be so pleased with us, if we
should be the means of giving him his liberty,
that he would never be able to make enough of
us."
"Exactly so, my dear, but we must not
expect that he will be inclined to take any
public notice of us; he must appear, you know,
to be very much concerned at such a catas-
trophe, but he would be glad enough of it in
his heart and reward us handsomely."
"Then, I think," replied Mrs. Simkin, "that
we may regard the matter as already done."
## p. 269 (#287) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 269
"But we must take care that our story is
plausible."
"Of course we must; but we must, in the
first place, throw out suspicions and imitations,
and so set the people talking about her. Every
body knows that we are more intimate with
her than any one else, and, of course, all the
neighhours will be applying to us, if they hear
any rumours, and then you know, all that we
have to do, is to affect that we know more than
we choose to say; and that will provoke the
world to make further inquiry, and to compel
us to say what we know."
"True, Mrs. Simkin, very true indeed," re-
plied the affectionate husband, " you are a mar-
vellously clever woman. It would never do
for Augustus Fitzgeorge himself, to be seen in
the business; he ought to appear as if driven
by force into the inquiry." -
"So he ought," replied Mrs. Simkin, "we
shall soon force him to set about the investiga-
## p. 270 (#288) ############################################
270 FITZGEORGE,
tion, and if we can make our story good, we
shall make our fortune."
"Indeed, Mrs. Simkin, my love, I do not
see any probability of failure. You know she
has no friends, except, perhaps, old Lord Fitz-
george, and he can do nothing to contradict
rumours, which will, perhaps, never reach him
till they have become too strongfor contradiction.
You know the old saying, that where there is
much smoke there must be some fire, and we
will take care to make plenty of smoke, and
we may leave it to Augustus Fitzgeorge to
find out the fire. We have nothing to do but
to manage our circumstantial evidence in such
a way that it may not be easily unravelled or
disputed. And we know that whenever any one
is very anxious that anything should be true,
they are very easily persuaded into a belief
of it."
"You are right," Mrs. Simkin replied, "and
what a pity it is that Fitzgeorge himself can-
## p. 271 (#289) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 271
not sit as judge in his own case; a very little
evidence would do to convince him."
" It would so, indeed," said Mr. Simkin,
"but if he cannot be judge in his own case
he may buy a jury, which will answer the same
purpose."
So this precious couple set about their mis-
chievous and malignant work, with all imagina-
le diligence and dexterity; they watched all
the actions, and recorded all the words of Lady
Louisa, and set them all down with such ex-
aggerations and distortions as inventive malice
could suggest. In an incredibly short space of
time rumours were every where circulated highly
injurious to the reputation of Lady Louisa;
and as there was no suspicion as to the source
of them, many persons believed them. Fitz-
george and his friends, of course, were ready
enough to believe them, because they hoped
that they might be true. So did old Lady
Fitzgeorge, who now began to hope that if her
son could get rid of his wife, there might be an
## p. 272 (#290) ############################################
272 FITZGeoRGE.
opportunity for his marrying the lady which his
mother had designed for him. Her ladyship
now urged upon Lord Fitzgeorge the import-
ance and propriety of making some inquiry
into the truth of these rumours that were fly-
ing about in every direction.
"I do not believe a word of it," replied Lord
Fitzgeorge; "'tis all idle talk. I will not suffer
my niece to be calumniated."
"If it were my niece," retorted her ladyship,
"you would have no objection to any calumny
against her."
"No more objection, perhaps," replied his
lordship, "than you have to calumnies against
my niece."
"But if you think the rumour to be nothing
more than calumny and falsehood, why do you
not make inquiry into the matter, and have it
settled at once? Such reports are injurious to
the honour of our family."
"And a formal inquiry would be almost as
injurious as the reports. While we take no
## p. 273 (#291) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 273
notice of them, we do not seem to believe them;
but if we set about any investigation, we should
immediately proclaim that we have a suspicion
that there may be some truth in them."
"And I declare that I have such suspicion."
"You have?" said Lord Fitzgeorge, with an
emphasis of wonder.
"I have," replied her ladyship, with as strong
an emphasis.
"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
Candour was not among the virtues cultivated
by Lady Fitzgeorge; on the contrary, she seemed
to think that she could not give a greater proof
of her own immaculateness than by regarding
almost every one else suspiciously. It was, in-
deed, too great a temptation for her ladyship to
resist, to regard Lady Louisa with a feeling of
reproach, not only believing all the ill that she
heard of the discarded wife, but as much more
as she could readily imagine.
Lady Fitzgeorge now began to take her son's
part, and to encourage him, where, indeed, he
N 3

274 FitzGeorg E.
needed very little encouragement, to believe all
evil things of his wife. So the husband and
wife were divided, one taking part with the son
and one with the son's wife. The friends, also,
of Fitzgeorge, came about him, now urging him
to take advantage of these evil reports, and to
use his diligence in investigating the affair,
saying, that it was now in his power, perhaps,
to obtain that liberation which he had been so
ardently and yet so hopelessly desiring.
"Turne quod optanti Divm promittere nemo
Auderet, volvenda dies en, attulit ultro,"
said Drury Borrowman.
"An exceedingly appropriate quotation, my
good friend," replied Fitzgeorge, "but I have
my doubts. At present, all is rumourmere
rumour; and I am afraid that some of my too
zealous friends have given too ready credence to
some vague reports; and if the inquiry should
end in nothing but the vindication of her cha-
racter from all suspicion, the matter will be
worse than nothingthere will be no chance

FITZGEORGE. 275
for me hereafter. I should like to know some-
thing more of this Mr. Simkin; he may be some
over-officious ape, fancying that he is doing me
a service, when he is merely bringing me into a
ridiculous disappointment."
"My dear fellow," replied Borrowman, "I
beg pardon for being so rude as to tell you that
you do not know what you are talking about.
An inquiry cannot end in vindication, though it
may not end in conviction. The present sus-
picion will give ground for another; and all the
world will think that the acquittal, should it
take place, is more from want of evidence, not
from absence of guilt. In these cases accusa-
tion is half proof."
"I believe you are right," replied Fitz-
george.
When a person of rank, opulence, and influ-
ence, is inclined to deceive himself, he is not at
a loss for friends and coadjutors to assist him
in the deception. When Fitzgeorge first dis-
missed his wife from his roof, he had no hope
that in so short a time any prospect should open

276 FitzGEORGE.
upon him of getting rid of the encumbrance
altogether; and as he had not made any direct,
or even indirect efforts towards procuring an
accusation like the present, and as he was not
fully aware of the powerful sympathy, which
existed in his favour amongst those who could
anticipate his wishes, he began almost to
think that it really was true, that the rumours
were founded in absolute fact. It was natural
that he should have some little doubts, yet it
was as natural that he should endeavour to get
rid of them.
He had not dismissed his wife on account of,
or on suspicion of, any irregularity of conduct,
but merely from a feeling of personal disgust
and dislike. For as the power of love or per-
sonal liking is very great, leading men into
many extravagances not warrantable by reason
or calculation; so also the power of hatred, or
personal dislike, is very great, leading, or rather
driving, man into all manner of excesses; and
as in the case of personal liking, the imagina-
tion must picture to itself the person beloved as
## p. 277 (#295) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 277
loving in return, and so the liking increases and
strengthens, till experience contradicts or weari-
ness destroys it; so in the case of personal ha-
tred or dislike, the imagination also pictures to
itself the person hated hating in return, till the
hatred, increased by a thought of reciprocity,
grows to a mad and malignant hostility. This
had been the situation of Fitzgeorge. Previ-
ously to his marriage he had not cared for his
cousin, nor thought of her; but when she was
proposed to him for marriage, he, disliking the
marriage, fancied that he disliked her; and
when they were actually married, and he found
the marriage not so profitable to him in a pecu-
niary point of view as he had expected, he grew
more hostile to his wife than ever, and was
ready to believe any thing disreputable or dis-
honourable concerning her. As hatred is a
feeling directly opposed to love, generally
speaking, so it is in most of its details; and as
love sets our imagination on the invention of
virtues, so hatred sets our imagination on the
invention of vices.
## p. 278 (#296) ############################################
278 FITZGEORGE.
Fitzgeorge now meditated with himself how
best he might take advantage of the very agree-
able reports in circulation. It was necessary, in
the first place, that an especial messenger should
be sent to Mr. and Mrs. Simkin, to ascertain
from them how much they could conveniently
swear to; for Augustus was of opinion, that not-
withstanding what Borrowman had said, it
would be very undesirable to get up a formal
inquiry which should end in nothing. It is
true, he thought, that her character might be
thus injured in the public estimation, and so
it was, even by the mere rumours; but if the
present inquiry should fail to establish aught
against her, she would be put more upon her
guard, and it must be only at some great dis-
tance of time, or under some very different cir-
cumstances, that another accusation could be
got up against her.
Therefore he thought it best to send an es-
pecial friend to examine the Simkins privately,
and particularly as to how much they knew, and
to how much they could prove; for in these
## p. 279 (#297) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 279
cases proof is every thing. By the way, one
cannot help observing here, how very loose is
the language of our legal reports in this coun-
try; when any witness is examined on oath
against an accused person, it is said that the
witness proves whatever he may be pleased to
affirm on oath; yet the same law which recog-
nises an oath as proving, admits the possibility
that an oath may be falsely taken and violated;
so that, in fact, an oath no more proves than
any other mode of assertion. If, indeed, there
were a physical impossibility for any one to
speak falsely under an oath, there might be some
force and meaning in the word prove. But let
that pass.-A messenger was sent to the Sim-
kins, and his message was opened with much
formality. Mr. Simkin twiddled his thumbs,
and Mrs. Simkin turned up her eyes in especial
wonderment at the great wickedness of the age
in general, and of Lady Louisa in particular.
Both husband and wife, in one breath, ran on
in a strain of such general and universal vitu-
## p. 280 (#298) ############################################
280 FITZGEORGE.
peration, that the messenger was shocked, and
though of the male sex, and a constant compa-
nion of Fitzgeorge himself, actually blushed.
"But, my very good friends," said he, as
soon as opportunity was offered for him to in-
troduce a word, "Can you swear to all these
things in a court of justice?"
There was at this question a momentary pause.
"Swear?" said Mr. Simkin, looking first at the
messenger, and then at Mrs. Simkin.
"Swear?" said also Mrs. Simkin, looking
first at the messenger, and then at Mr. Simkin.
"Yes," said the messenger very coolly and
inquiringly, "can you swear to all these things
in a court of justice, or even to any consider-
able part of them? For if you can, the affair
will be settled presently, and to good pur-
pose."
So the loving couple again muttered the word
"swear," and their eyes met, and their toes
met, and their elbows met, and they stammered
out "Yesyes-y-y-yes; certainlyoh, yes
## p. 281 (#299) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 281
undoubtedlyyes, we can swear, swear in a
court of justice too."
Having said thus they grew much bolder,
especially as the messenger gave them a very
encouraging look as much as to say, that they
need not be very particular in their swearing as
to the very precise accuracy of the matter.
Now they had a thorough understanding, that
they might abundantly revenge themselves on
Lady Louisa for what they were pleased to
call, her abominable pride, and that they should
do themselves good service with Augustus Fitz-
george; and, perhaps, be amply remunerated
by him when he should come to his title and
estates. But they were rather inclined now to
overdo the matter, and had not this messenger
been an especial friend of Fitzgeorge and ready
to believe more than he heard, and to wish the
worst to be true, he would have been soon
satisfied that the good people were more in-
debted to imagination than to memory. Instead,
however, of checking or restraining the ardour
## p. 282 (#300) ############################################
282 FitzGEORGE.
of their vituperation, he urged them onwards
and provoked them to a most outrageous cri-
mination, judging that the more they said when
not on oath, the more they would swear to
when put on their oath. He regarded the pre-
sent interrogation as a rehearsal preparatory to
the trial.
Back went the messenger to Fitzgeorge tri-
umphantly reporting progress; but the report
was almost too good to be true. It was quite
beyond the utmost expectation of the disgusted
husband, to find such abundant and satisfactory
crimination against his discarded wife. He
now began to see some prospect of success, and
he was for a moment happy. Alas! when he
began the career of life full of hope, of promise,
and of pride, he thought not that a time was
approaching, when in the midst of life's course
he should be glad to snatch at a moment's
happiness, arising from the probability and
prospect of getting rid of a wife whom he ab-
horred. Yet such was his present condition, .
## p. 283 (#301) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 283
and such his only source of happiness. All the
brightness and glory of his splendid establish-
ment, all the honours of his well-cut coats
were no happiness to him, while so many an-
noyances surrounded him in the shape of duns,
fat, and matrimony. He might possess enough
to make a hundred persons happy; but, while
he had enough to make one person miserable,
he could not enjoy himself. That was a truth
which he had never considered, in all the san-
guineness and brightness of his hopes; and
even when he felt the sad oppression of dis-
appointment, he was not ready to learn a lesson
of wisdom from it.
"And they will swear to all this?" said he.
"To every word of it," replied his trusty
messenger.
"Then I must immediately announce the
fact to my father, for I must not proceed with
out his countenance and advice."
Fitzgeorge immediately demanded an audi-
ence of his father, and it was not refused. As

for Mr. Graves, he would take no part in the
business. "No, no," said he, "I have had
work enough on my hands with interfering be
tween father and son; I will not embroil myself
in any quarrel between man and wife."
When Augustus was in his father's presence,
the old gentleman hastily said, "Well, sir,
what now P Have you yet made up your mind
to be reconciled to your wife, and to live re-
putably as your mother and I do."
Augustus laid his hand upon his heart, and
bowing most reverently, for he was very proud
of his skill in bowing, said, "Alas! sir, it
grieves me to say, that so far from seeing any
prospect of a reconciliation with that unfortu-
nate lady, I am daily hearing such sad reports,
that I fear there must be a more complete
separation than already exists."
Having thus spoken, Augustus shook his
head and looked very grave, all as naturally as
if he was really very sorry indeed. An actually
loving husband hearing that his wife had played
## p. 285 (#303) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 285
him false, could not have looked more solemnly
grave than did Augustus Fitzgeorge, when an-
nouncing to his father the intelligence which
he had been so happy and so eager to gain.
But Lord Fitzgeorge was not so easy to be
deceived; he replied hastily and rather passion-
ately, "Eh! What?What?Want a di-
vorce 7Nonoshan't be divorcedshan't
be divorced. Married for better and worse;
stick to your bargain, as I do to mine."
"But, sir," replied Augustus, with a reve-
rential affectation of patient sorrow, " consider,
I beseech you, how utterly impossible it is for
me to sit down calmly under all this imputation.
What will the world think?"
"What will the world think?" repeated his
lordship. "Why, the world will think that you
acted very foolishly in sending your wife away
from your own house. . You should have lived
together and have kept up appearances, and
then the world would have known nothing of
the matter."
## p. 286 (#304) ############################################
286 FITZGEORGE.
"But it was her own wish to live apart."
"You drove her to that wish. Why did you
neglect her Why did you insult her?"
"Pardon me, sir," replied Augustus; "it is
not in my nature to insult a female, but it is
not in the power of any one to command his
affections."

"Command affections !" answered his lord-
ship. "Nonsense, look at your mother and me;
see how respectably we live together; we have
no nonsensical notions about commanding af-
fections. If your wife had been living, where
she ought to have been, under your roof, none
of these rumours could by any possibility have
got into circulation."

"Surely, sir," said Augustus, "you would
not have me live a dishonoured husband."
"You have dishonoured yourself."
Fitzgeorge knew that, therefore he did not
contradict it; but because he knew it, he did
not like to think of it; therefore he proceeded
to say, "Excuse me, sir, but what will the

world think, if I am insensible to these rumours,
and use no means of refuting them? Will it not
be supposed, that now I am separated from my
wife, I am indifferent to the propriety or impro-
priety of her conduct? Nay, farther, am I not
guilty of an injustice towards her, if I do not
take all the pains that I possibly can to con-
tradict these rumours ? And how are they to
be contradicted, but by an investigation ? From
whom must the inquiry originate? Not from
herself;for supposing her to be innocent, it
is possible that the rumour has never reached
her ear. An investigation, therefore, of the
charge is rendered imperative, as an act of
mercy to her and justice to me."
Now the mention of the world and of its
opinion, was always enough to move Lord Fitz-
george to or from any thing, and as he really
did not suppose that the calumnious stories
told about his niece were true, he was rather
induced to consent to an investigation, espe-
cially when Augustus added, "For unless, sir,
## p. 288 (#306) ############################################
288 FitzGeoRGE.
you give your consent to an inquiry into the
truth or falsehood of these rumours, I shall
be under the painful necessity of instituting a
legal process to rid me of one, who, if these
rumours are true, is a disgrace to my name."
Augustus Fitzgeorge knew of course that if
there should be a regular and formal inquiry,
and if that inquiry should terminate, as he
trusted it would, in establishing a serious charge
against his wife, he should then be able to ob-
tain a legal separation, and it would appear as
if the process were forced upon him by the ob-
vious notoriety of the fact. And then the world
would exonerate him from any reproach of
having causelessly parted from his wife.
Forthwith notice was conveyed to Mr. and
Mrs. Simkin that certain gentlemen, friends of
the Fitzgeorge family, would presently wait
upon them, in order to investigate the rumours
which were in circulation touching the conduct
of Lady Louisa. This intelligence put the cen-
sorious couple into what they emphatically

called a quandary. They knew not in what
manner, or concerning what particulars, they
were to be examined, or whether they were to
be put on oath. -
"This is an unpleasant affair, Mrs. Simkin,"
said the husband; "for I must confess to you,
that I do not exactly recollect all that we said
the other day to the gentleman who called
here."
"Oh, leave that to me, my dear Simkin," re-
plied the wife, "I am not in the habit of for-
getting such matters. Why, bless me, my dear,
I must refresh your memory. Don't you re-
member that Captain Jackson and Mr. Thomson
have been in the habit of visiting her ladyship !
At least they used to be till they were found
out, and then you know they left off coming
a sure proof, Mr. Simkin, according to all the
laws of judicious evidence, that they came for
no good."
"Yes, yes, right my dear," answered Mr.
Simkin; "I wonder what they could come for."

"Wonder what they could come for ' Why
don't you know?"
"One may guess, indeed," replied Mr. Sim-
kin; "but you know that other gentlemen have
visited her ladyship besides Captain Jackson
and Mr. Thomson. Shall we accuse them all?"
"No, my dear," answered Mrs. Simkin, most
judiciously, "two will be quite enough, and
look a little more like probability. We may
throw out general insinuations against others,
but it will be better not to attempt to prove too
much."
"Certainly;-but shall we be able to prove
enough?"
"No doubtbut you are looking very thought-
ful; what are you thinking about?"
"Why, my dear," replied Mr. Simkin, "I
was only thinking that if we should prove all
these charges against this lady, and make her
out to be as we have represented, what will the
world think of us for having been so familiar
with her, inviting her to our house, and visiting

at hers?And, especially, what will be thought
of you, my sweet love?"
"Oh, my dear," replied Mrs. Simkin, "we
can soon get over that. Augustus Fitzgeorge
himself will be so delighted to get rid of this
wife of his, that he will think he can never
make us amends for our services, and he will
patronize and countenance us;and then I
should like to see any body that I care about
who would dare to treat us with disrespect.
Besides, my sweet love, what can be easier than
to say that for a long time we could not believe
our senses, or think it possible that so exalted
a lady could be guilty of real impropriety of
conduct; and that we were at last only con-
vinced when we could resist the evidence no
longer. So, by that means, we shall make out
ourselves to be amiable as well as pure."
"Well, my dear," answered Mr. Simkin, "I
have no objection to be made out as amiable as
you please; only I should be sorry that your
character should suffer. Then again, if we

should after all fail in the proof, we shall look
very foolish. A great many people, you know,
profess to doubt the truth of the rumours that we
have put into circulation; for they very naturally
say, that nothing could be more agreeable to
Augustus Fitzgeorge, just at this moment, than
that the charge should be established against
her."
"Ay, my dear love," responded Mrs. Simkin,
"they are only the low, vulgar sort of people.
Gentlefolks and persons of real fashion all be-
lieve that she is no better than she should be."
"Perhaps they judge from themselves," re-
plied Mr. Simkin, with a smile.
"My dear, how can you talk such non-
sense ?"
CHAPTER I.
INVESTIGATION.
When the friends of the Fitzgeorge family
came to the house of Mr. Simkin, to make
inquiry into the sad rumours that were in cir-
culation concerning the conduct of Lady Louisa,
an inconvenient arrangement was made for the
examination of the worthy couple which they
had not anticipated. They were requested to
favour the gentlemen with their company one
at a time.
Now when the first messenger was sent to
VOL. III. B

2 FITZGEORGE.
pump the Simkins, and to ascertain how much
they were likely to assert and to swear to,
they were sitting together, side by side, very
conveniently for the purpose of conveying sig-
nals; but to be examined separately was awk-
ward, especially to Mrs. Simkin, who was
afraid that she should blush, being in the
presence of so many gentlemen, and not having
her husband at hand to keep her in counte-
nance. Mr. Simkin also felt awkward, as his
memory was not very good, and as his infor-
mation came mostly from his wife. He there-
fore endeavoured to throw on his wife the burden
of the first examination, and in this he suc-
ceeded.
"Now," said the spokesman of the party to
Mrs. Simkin, " this is a matter of the utmost
consequence to the well-being and comfort of
a most respectable family; we hope and trust
therefore, that you will have the kindness to
furnish us with such information that we may
know what steps we ought to recommend for
## p. 3 (#11) ###############################################
FITZGEORGE. 3
the honour of the family, which we have very
much at heart."
"For the matter of that," replied Mrs. Sim-
kin, "I am sure I should have been the last
person in the world to speak of any thing that
I have seen and heard; but really there are
some things that one cannot shut one's eyes to,
if ever so willing."
"Exactly so. Now, Mrs. Simkin, we are
not going to put you on your oath;" she was
glad to hear that; "but it will be necessary to
make written minutes of the matters which you
may have to inform us of." She was sorry to
hear that.
The materials for writing were arranged, and
the interrogation proceeded. "Will you have
the goodness, now, to inform these gentlemen,
what was the first symptom or indication of
improper demeanour in the benaviour of Lady
Louisa V
"Why, sir," replied Mrs. Simkin, "I think
b2
## p. 4 (#12) ###############################################
FITZGEORGE.
that I may safely say, that the first symp-
tom of improper demeanour which I observed
in Lady Louisa, was one day when I dined
there with Mr. Simkin, when there were se-
veral gentlemen present, and I was the only
lady."
"Was the behaviour of her ladyship, on that
occasion, such as you feel yourself quite at
liberty to mention?" asked the examiner, with
due deference to Mrs. Simkin's delicacy.
"Most undoubtedly," replied Mrs. Simkin
with great firmness of manner, "I was never
eye-witness to any thing that I should be
ashamed to mention. Her behaviour on this
occasion was altogether unbecoming a lady."
"You will have the kindness, madam, to be
explicit."
"I will, sir. As soon as we came home, and,
indeed, as we got into the carriage, Mr. S.
observed to me, that Lady Louisa was mighty
fond of the gentlemen's company."
## p. 5 (#13) ###############################################
FITZGEORGE. O
"That was Mr. Simkin's opinion; but what
did you yourself observe?"
"I observed the same thing; and that, in-
stead of talking with me, who was the only
lady present, she gave all her attention to the
gentlemen."
"Did you observe any particular attention
paid by her ladyship to Mr. Simkin?"
Mrs. Simkin, with an eye of lightning and a
tongue of thunder, replied, "No, indeed, sir!"
"I beg pardon: but to whom was the prin-
cipal attention of her ladyship directed'?"
"Why, then, sir, if I must say, it was to
Captain Jackson and .Mr. Thomson."
"To Captain Jackson and Mr. Thomson.
Have you any distinct recollection whether the
attention of her ladyship was directed more to
one than to the other of these gentlemen?"
This was a question for an answer to which
Mrs. Simkin was not expressly and particularly
prepared; but she had presence of mind enough
to know that it would be exceedingly inde-

0 FITZGEORGE.
corous, as well as impolitic, to seem to be in-
venting an answer; on the spin of the moment,
therefore, she replied, " Her ladyship's attention
was evidently most directed to Captain Jack-
son."
"Most directed to Captain Jackson. Did
the Captain pay her ladyship more frequent
visits than Mr. Thomson?"
"Oh, yes! many moremany more; Cap-
tain Jackson was almost always at the house!"
"Did he ever remain in the house all
night?"
"Very frequently indeed."
"And did he come and go with any particu-
lar attempt at concealment?"
"Gh, yes; nobody never knew when he
came and when he went. I have often watched
him."
"You were, of course, suspicious of an im-
proper intimacy between Captain Jackson and
her ladyship. Will you have the kindness to
state to these gentlemen the circumstances
Y

which excited the suspicions, independently of
the fact of her ladyship paying such exclusive
attention to these two gentlemen at her table?"
"Their frequent visits!" replied Mrs. Sim-
kin.
"Certainly; but it appears from your state-
ment that you were rather on the look-out for
these visits, than led to observe them by any
accident; for you say that you have often
watched Captain Jackson coming and going, as
though he wished not to be seen. Now, a lady
in your rank, and of your understanding, would,
of course, not be watching the doors of a neigh-
bour out of a mere feeling of curiosity."
"To be sure I should not," replied Mrs.
Simkin, rather offended that any necessity
should be supposed to exist for making such
a remark.
"Then you will have the goodness to inform
us, what were the causes or circumstances which
led you to watch the movements of Captain
Jackson?"
'
## p. 8 (#16) ###############################################

"Because Lady Louisa," replied Mrs. Sim-
kin, "was always talking about him in such
very high terms; and once, in particular, she
said, that she never had any thing to thank
her husband for, but for introducing to her ac-
quaintance such a delightful man as Captain
Jackson."
"Her ladyship said this in your hearing?"
. "She did so."
"Were other persons present at the time?"
"My husband was present."
"From the manner, then, in which her lady-
ship spoke of Captain Jackson, you imagined
that she had an improper partiality for him?"
"I did so."
"And therefore you watched, in order to see
how often he visited her ladyship?"
"Exactly so."
"Her ladyship also spoke of Mr. Thomson?"
"Yes, very highly indeed; but not quite so
highly of him as of Mr. Jackson."
## p. 9 (#17) ###############################################
FITZGEORGE. 
"Not so highly as to lead you to suspect any
improper partiality for him 1"
"Oh, yes!" replied Mrs. Simkin, who just
recollected herself, that the arrangement with
her husband was to accuse Jackson and Thom-
son both, though Jackson and Thomson only j
"she had an undoubted partiality for Mr.
Thomson, as well as for Captain Jackson: only
I think that Captain Jackson was the greatest
favourite of the two."
The examiner smiled, but Mrs. Simkin, for-
tunately, did not see him. "Now, Mrs. Sim-
kin," continued he with a reinforcement of gra-
vity and solemnity, "this is an inquiry of a
peculiarly delicate nature, and we should be ex-
ceedingly sorry to say any thing, or to urge you
to say any thing, which should do violence to
your feelings; but, for the honour of the family,
as this investigation has been once commenced,
it is necessary that it should be pursued to the
utmost, in order that the question may for ever
be set at rest. Will you, therefore, be so kind

10 FITZGEORGE.
as to state, in a few words, what reason you
have for supposing that any improper intercourse
has taken place between the parties?"
Mrs. Simkin blushed, and said, in spite of
her blushes, "I recollect very distinctly hear-
ing her ladyship say, that it was very melan-
choly to sleep alone."
Having made this sacrifice, as she thought it,
of delicacy to the cause of justice, Mrs. Simkin
held down her head in sweet confusion, and saw
not the imperfectly subdued smile with which
the examiner put his next question.
"And because her ladyship observed to you
that it was very melancholy to sleep alone, you
infer that she was in the habit of having a bed-
fellow?"
"I do so, indeed, sir," replied Mrs. Simkin,
not aware of the non sequitur, and quite as un-
aware of the smile of incredulity that gleamed
upon the countenance of the person who put
the question.
"You must be aware, Mrs. Simkin," said
## p. 11 (#19) ##############################################
P1TZGEOEGE. 11
the examiner," that an inference is not a proof;
it is therefore desirable that some more express
testimony be given to the fact, if it be a fact."
"If it be a fact!" interrupted Mrs. Simkin,
quite angry at the affront implied in such con-
ditional language; " why there can be no doubt
of it;the child is as like as possible."
"Child !" exclaimed the whole party at once,
with as much wonderment as the wise men of
Gotham expressed when they lighted on a
mare's nest.
"Yes, gentlemen," replied Mrs. Simkin,
roused to an unblushing energy and self-pos-
session, " I say child, Lady Louisa has had a
child since she came to reside in this neigh-
bourhood; and the child is as like Captain
Jackson as possibly can be."
One of the party, in a tone of voice which
was by no means agreeable to Mrs. Simkin,
because it sounded like banter, said, "Is the
child at all like Mr. Thomson, too 1"
"No, sir," replied Mrs. Simkin, with parti-

12 FITZGEORGE.
cular force of intonation, and rapidity of utter-
ance; "no more like Mr. Thomson than you
are."
"Well, madam," said the first speaker, " let
us be quite serious if you please. Perhaps you
can favour us with some particulars of the
lady's confinement; of the time; and where the
child now is. It is living, I presume, from your
manner of speaking of it."
"Living, ayand a fine child it is! But as
to the circumstances and time of the lady's
confinement, of course you cannot expect me to
tell you very particularly; because a lady con-
fined under such circumstances would not let
the matter be known very publicly. But as far
as I can form a judgment, I take it to be about
four months ago."
"About four months ago, very good;and
from what do you draw that inference?"
"From the age of the child."
"And from what do you infer the age of the
child?"

"Bless me, sir," exclaimed Mrs. Simkin,
rather nettled at the closeness of the interro-
gations, "you are cross-questioning a body
like a brow-beating counsellor at the Old
Bailey!"
"This minuteness of interrogation," said the
gentleman in a most conciliatory tone, "is ab-
solutely necessary for the purpose of an accurate
statement; not that we would insinuate any
doubt of your veracity."
"Well, sir," retorted Mrs. Simkin, rather
encouraged to greater boldness, than melted
down to meekness by the conciliatory tone of
the examiner, " if you don't doubt my voracity,
why don't you take my word at once?"
"We will take your word, madam, as far as
you will be pleased to give it to us. You can
inform us then, where the child is?"
"The child," replied Mrs. Simkin,  is at
this present time with a young couple who live
in a cottage on the other side of the common,
and it passes for theirs, but it is no more theirs

FITZGEORGE.
than it is mine.Lady Louisa is always going
to see it."
Mrs. Simian began now to show symptoms
of weariness; for, as she afterwards said, she
thought that the people seemed determined to
bother her, and she did not like to be bothered.
Seeing that Mrs. Simkin looked tired and felt
somewhat irritated, the gentlemen suggested
that it might be as well now to discontinue the
examination of the lady, and to request the
favour of Mr. Simkin's presence. The lady
was ready enough to adopt the suggestion, and
she went with no small haste to the apartment
in which he was waiting to be called.
It was not altogether correct that after one
witness had been examined she should be
closeted with another about to be examined.
Mrs. Simkin was aware of the irregularity, but
was afraid that her husband, who was not the
brightest genius in the world, might make some
blunder unless his memory was refreshed by a
hint or two, especially concerning the matter of
## p. 15 (#23) ##############################################
FITZGEOEGE. 15
filiation, which Mrs. Simkin, herself, had never
stated before so very explicitly, as she had this
moment to the gentlemen in the other room.
She knowing that it was not very regular that
she should be talking to him previously to his
examination, and subsequently to her own,
feared that their colloquy might presently be
interrupted, and accordingly endeavoured to
make the most of her time.
There is a well-known proverb which says,
"the more haste the worse speed," and so it
fared on the present occasion with Mrs. Simkin,
who wished to inform her husband that she had
given her testimony that Jackson, was the more
favoured lover, and the unquestionable father
of the child. But, unfortunately the names of
Jackson and Thomson had been so jumbled
together in her bothered pericranium, that in-
stead of saying " Jackson's the man," she said
"Thomson's the man;" and, forthwith, sent
her husband into the room where the committee
of investigation were sitting. Mr. Simkin, him-

16 F1TZGEOEGE.
self, as he went from one room to the other,
muttered, "Thomson's the man, Thomson's
the man." And the impression was made on
his pericranium accordingly.
Mr. Simkin bowed very politely to the gentle-
men of the committee, and the gentlemen of
committee bowed very politely to Mr. Simkin.
"This is a very unpleasant affair, Mr.
Simkin."
"Very unpleasant, indeed!" replied Mr.
Simkin. "I little thought, when I retired from
business and took this nice place, that I should
ever be the means of introducing Mrs. S. into
the society of people no better than they should
be. But if that Lady Louisa is not a bad one,
I am monstrously out in my reckoning."
Mr. Simkin, by his readiness of utterance
and frankness of expression seemed to bid fair
to be very communicative;it was, however,
necessary that there should be some regularity
in the statements, in order that the depositions
## p. 17 (#25) ##############################################
F1TZGEORGE. 17
should be lucidly arranged. The gentleman,
therefore, who held the pen, said in a business-
like manner, " Now, Mr. Simkin, we shall feel
much obliged if you will have the kindness to
answer a few questions, j ust by way of corrobo-
rating the intelligence which we have had from
Mrs. Simkin."
Mr. Simkin bowed and replied, "Any in-
formation that I can give you, gentlemen, is
perfectly at your service; but it was my mistress
that was most active in watching the lady, and
I used often to have a joke with her about fe-
male curiosity, and used to say"
"Exactly so," interrupted the examiner.
"Then you can tell us, perhaps, in a general
way, whether you have yourself observed any
thing in the deportment of Lady Louisa, greatly
inconsistent with propriety.'"
"Haven't I indeed!" replied Mr. Simkin,
"Why, I never observed any thing in her con-
duct consistent with propriety."
## p. 18 (#26) ##############################################
18 FITZGEORGE.
"Be so good as to name some instances of
improper conduct, which have come immedi-
ately under your own eye."
"Under my own eye V replied Mr. Simkin,
chuckling. "Why, she took special care, I
guess, not to let me see any of her goings on
with her fellows.''
"What are we to understand by her lady-
ship's fellows, Mr. Simkin?"
"Her fellows, bless you! I mean them chaps,
that used to be always visiting her incog, till
we found them out. There was one Mr.
Thomson, especially."
"Was there any one else V
"There was also one Captain Jackson, but
Thomson was the favourite. He was the man."
The examiner knitted his brows and looked
on his papers, then drawing his hand across
his face said, "Thomson, you say? Now Mr.
Simkin, excuse me, but in a matter of this
nature it is a concern of the greatest moment,

FITZGEORGE. 19
that we should be perfectly correct and accurate
in all our statements, Don't hurry yourself,
but endeavour, as well as you can, to recollect
all the particulars. We are not examining you
with a view of obtaining contradictory evidence
to serve a purpose, but we wish to have the
truth."
"Truth!" said Mr. Simkin, with the natural
anger of a suspected liar; " I tell you the truth.
I say Thomson was the man, and my mistress
will tell you the same."
"You are quite sure now, Mr. Simkin?"
"Sure as you are sitting there."
Mr. Simkin suspected, that notwithstand-
ing their protestation?, they were endeavouring
to betray him into a contradiction, especially
since his wife had whispered to him with so
much haste and emphasis, "Thomson's the
man." Therefore he stuck most positively to
the assertion, that Thomson was the chief fa-
vourite. This was unfortunate for the object of
## p. 20 (#28) ##############################################
20 FITZGEORGE.
the inquiry. All the investigation, therefore,
ended in smoke; and when the gentlemen came
to look over their papers and to sum up the
evidence, it amounted to just nothing at all.
"But," said one of the party, " though there
is nothing to prove her guilt, there is nothing to
prove her innocence."Admirable logician!

CHAPTER II.
PUZZLED WHAT TO DO.
When the investigation had been concluded
or rather brought to a stand-still, by the con-
flicting testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Simkin, the
next step was to consider what was to be done.
It is very awkward that there is no such
thing as keeping a secret. Fitzgeorge would
have given any thing, if he had had any
thing to give, that this investigation should
not be made public, but it was absolutely im-
possible to prevent it, for it had been talked
about so much, that all the world knew that it
was going on, and all the world was on the
tiptoe of expectation for the important result.
All the world is a queer creature; it seems to
## p. 22 (#30) ##############################################
22 FITZGEORGE.
have nothing to do, but to interest itself about
that which does not concern it. Two hundred
years ago, the people who lived in this island
burnt witches;what will the people of this
island laugh at two hundred years hence?
One section of the committee carried the re-
port of the investigation to the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge, and the other carried it
to Lord Fitzgeorge. When Augustus Fitzgeorge
had read it over he was most graciously pleased
to be exceedingly indignant, and had not some
of the party been his particular friends, he would
have thrown the papers at their heads.
"This is an absolute nuisance," said he,
"the world is looking for a corroboration of
certain reports that are in circulation, and this
all but contradicts them."
"Not quite contradicts, however," replied
one of the party. "Mr. Simkin contends for
Thomson, and Mrs. Simkin will have it that
Jackson was the favourite. Is it not possible that
they were both favourites? Is it not possible
"
## p. 23 (#31) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 23
that Mrs. Simkin herself had a penchant for
Thomson and wished to exonerate him; and
that Mr. Simkin had a feeling of jealousy
against Thomson, and wished to inculpate
him?"
"No bad thought of yours," replied Fitz-
george; "but it is a pity, that being man and
wife, and in one story, they could not have
managed to make their testimony hang better
together so as to bear the public eye."
"I think so too," said the other; "but in
our examination it was necessary, for decency's
sake, to have the witnesses in one at a time."
"A foolish plan at best," said Borrowman,
who happened to be present, "for by that
arrangement you get two lies instead of one."
"But, perhaps, we have two truths in the
present case," said Fitzgeorge.
"As lovers of truth let us hope that we have,"
replied Borrowman; "but it would be more
convenient if they would have the goodness' to
look a little more like one another." ,

FlTZGEOUGE.
"The question is now," said Fitzgeorge,
"what we must say to the world. Shall we
confess that we have been defeated 1"
"No, no," replied Borrowman; "that will
be a work of supererogation, the world will
find out that soon enough. How does a general
act when he has lost a battle? Does he send
word home that the enemy has given him a
drubbing"
"Certainly not. He mystifies the matter, so
that nobody can understand what he means but
those who know all about it beforehand."
"Then do the same. If the Simkins have
conspired to give a false testimony, will they
proclaim themselves to the world? By this
time they are aware of the blunder which they
have committed. They will be cautious how
they talk apart on the subject again. The world
can know nothing but from this report, and
surely we may suppress the report."
"But we must give the world some account
of the inquiry, or at least of the result of it,
## p. 25 (#33) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 25
though not of the particulars. We have been
blustering about prosecution and divorce," said
Fitzgeorge; "how can we now account satis-
factorily for the withholding prosecution, and
not suing for divorce?"
"Plenty of contrivances may be had recourse
to yet," said one of the party; "we may give
out that you were so mercifully considerate of
your father's niece, that you would not drive
matters to an extremity. You may report that
some of the principal evidence has been bought
off;you may say that you yielded to the so-
licitations of your father, who of course would
be sorry to have you succeed in getting rid of
that encumbrance with which he has taken so
much pains to burden you."
"Exactly so," replied Fitzgeorge; "but we
must see that the world does not take it into its
head, that any unfair means have been used for
procuring evidence. And we must always take
care that my father does not publish to the
world that he sees no cause of blame."

"Ay, ay,".said one of the party, "none but
yourself can manage that."
u I!" exclaimed Fitzgeorge, "I should ima-
gine that I am the last person in the world to
persuade my father to assist me. He would be
glad to rivet the chains yet stronger."
"Is not your father fond of letter-writing ?,'
"Rather so."
"Is he not also fond of giving advice sea-
soned with a little of the pomp of authority?"
"Not a little so," replied Fitzgeorge.
"Can you not then manage to suggest a
letter of advice? You understand."
While the above scene was going on in the man-
sion of Augustus Fitzgeorge, other individuals
of the committee of inquiry, who were pleased
to call themselves friends of Lord Fitzgeorge,
had taken to his lordship a copy of the report
of the investigation, and had reverentially placed
it before his lordship, who was most graciously
pleased to peruse it with great attention; and
when he had graciously finished the perusal,

he lifted up his eyes quickly, and said to the
gentlemen who brought it, "Well, what does
all this amount to? This proves nothing. I
thought sothought so. I wonder what Au-
gustus could mean by desiring any investigation.

Where does he come from? What does he
live upon? Is he an old man, or a young
man?"
"Simkin, my lord, is rather past the middle
of life, and has retired from business."
"Yes, yes, I know," interrupted Lord Fitz-
george; " a retired shopkeepervulgar people."
"We must acknowledge to your lordship that
we observed strong symptoms of vulgarity both
in Mr. and Mrs. Simkin, and thought such
people by no means proper companions for so
high-born a lady as your lordship's niece."
"To be sure not," replied Lord Fitzgeorge;
"I will write her a letter and tell her so. Her
associating with these vulgar people is the only
impropriety of which she has been guilty."

"So we inferred, my lord; and it appears
that owing to some mortification that they have
experienced from her ladyship, they have con-
spired to raise these calumnies against her."
"Well, well," said his lordship, " I will write
her a letter, and tell her that I do not approve
of her associating with these people."
"And perhaps if your lordship would have the
kindness to suggest, in the most gentle terms
of course, that it would be desirable that Lady
Louisa should repress the exuberant vivacity of
her spirits; it would be serviceable, as the means
of preventing any future misunderstanding."
"Leave that to me, leave that to me," said
his lordship, hastily. "I know what I am
about."
The gentlemen who brought the report of the
investigation, had scarcely left his lordship's
presence, when the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge
was announced, earnestly entreating the honour
of an audience.
"So here comes my unmanageable scape-

grace. What will he say for himself now? He
will never have the impudence to say that such
evidence as this is sufficient to criminate the
poor woman. Let him comeI will see him."
If Fitzgeorge had been rehearsing paces and
faces for a week, he could not have approached
his father with a more elegant gait, or a better-
managed expression of cheerful respect. He
bowed, he smiled, he held forth his hand with
a well-wrought cordiality and confidence, and
before his father could speak, he said, "Sir'
give me joy of this happy result of our most
delicate investigation."
"Joy, joy! What do you mean,eh? 
What do you mean? Did you not wish to find
her guilty, and have a divorce? Would not
you have sold her to Mr. Thomson, or Captain
Jackson for five thousand pounds? And would
not you have jumped at the bargain?"
"Sir," said Augustus, laying his hand very
ceremoniously on his heart, " you little know my
heart if you imagine that I could derive any

satisfaction fiom disgrace falling on any of out
amily."
"Then if you are glad that your wife is in-
nocent, why do you not take her home, and
live reputably with her as you ought to do?"
"Sir/' replied Augustus, " you are not aware,
I presume, how widely different is respect from
love;I wish the Lady Louisa all happiness
and all good repute, but it is not in my power
to love her. On that point we understand each
other perfectly welL It might have been for
our happiness that we had not come together;
but as it is we must make the best of it. It
concerned me deeply to hear those unpleasant
reports, and I was anxious that an investigation
should take place; and no one can be more
sincerely rejoiced than I am at the happy ter-
mination of it."
"But, by leaving your house, you see she has
got into bad company."
"That, sir, is an evil against which, by your
kind admonition she may hereafter be more
upon her guard."

"- My admonition," said his lordship, "has
been very often thrown away."
"It is to he hoped that, in this case, it may
not be so," replied Augustus.
"We shall see."
So a letter was written accordingly to Lady
Louisa, and in that letter no allusion was made
to any more serious charge, but a gentle admo-
nition was given, that she would be more choice
for the future in the selection of her associates,
and a little more guarded in the language which
she might use in the hearing of strangers. The
letter was kindly but clumsily expressed, and
Louisa, in the exuberance of her vivacity, rather
laughed at it. She returned an answer, however*
thanking Lord Fitzgeorge for his kind conside-
ration, and assuring him that he needed not to
be under any apprehension on her account; that
she had not any cause to regard any part of her
conduct with regret, except, perhaps, it might be
her intimacy with such people as the Simkins,
who, after all, might be under some external infln-

ence, which might have prompted their conduct
in the present instance.
Now, after all this was done, and after the
formal investigation, and the formal letter of
Lord Fitzgeorge, and the formal answer of Lady
Louisa, how much was Augustus Fitzgeorge
nearer to the attainment of his object than be-
fore? Eveiy thing that had taken place had
come to the knowledge of the world, and vari-
ous opinions were accordingly expressed, and in
many instances the opinions entertained and
expressed were by no means flattering to Fitz-
george, or agreeable to his notions of his own
dignity and honour. He could very easily say,
that he had not used any direct or indirect
means to procure the accusation, and the world
readily enough give him credit for the asser-
tion; but the world would not believe that
he was not mightily glad to hear the accusa-
tions, and that he was not very ready to take
advantage of them; nor would the world believe
that there were not many who were ready to

invent or exaggerate, and distort any thing that
might be the means of procuring that divorce,
which every body must know to be the real and
hearty wish of Fitzgeorge.
Partly, Fitzgeorge himself was aware of this,
and he was also aware, that an individual, situ-
ated as was Lady Louisa, must have every pos-
sible motive to 'guard against any thing that
might be construed to her disadvantage or dis-
repute; therefore, all his hope must rest in an
ingenious and well-conducted plot, which could
not be arranged and matured in a short space
of time. He knew that it was necessary to create
unfavourable impressions, and to strengthen
them in every possible way. For this purpose
he contrived that the public should understand,
that there was sufficient moral, though not suf-
ficient legal evidence. But all this required
trouble, and vigilance, and activity, which things
were altogether contrary to his notions of com-
fort.
"And now," said Fitzgeorge, muttering to

himself, "all this apparatus and fuss amounts
to next to nothing at all. The attempt to untie
lhe knot has drawn it tighter. I must, for the
future, be a little more on my guard, and on
the next occasion of an accusation I must see
that the plot is more skilfully laid. In fact, I
must engage in it myself. We must have the
witnesses better prepared; they must rehearse
their parts heforehand. If I make another at-
tempt and fail in that, I am a lost man.A lost
man!" He repeated the words aloud, and with
painful emphasis, "What a thought to enter
my mind! What an expression to pass my
lips! When I commenced the career of life,
and laid the foundation of my hopes in an
ample fortune, a graceful person, a high repu-
tation, and exalted station, I thought not of the
humiliating importunities of creditors whom I
could not silence or satisfy; I thought not of
the mortifying increase of my bulk, of the dis-
respectful manner in which my name should be
treated by a plebeian rabble. When I saw my

form reflected hi many a mirror, I little
thought that a time was coming when I should
be united in the indissoluble bonds of marriage
with one whom 1 can only regard as aninsuffer-
able bore. But life is not over yet, and while
there is life there is hope. I have been hitherto
disappointed in spite of my utmost care, it does
not follow that I am destined still to meet with
nought but disappointment in the course of
what remains of life. I have some prospect
before me. A time must come, in the course
of nature, in which I shall bear a higher name
and enjoy an ampler fortune than I now possess;
I may have then the happiness and content
which I now seek in vain. Then also I may
have more power and means to get rid of this
insufferable burden of a wife. Of all the in-
stitutions that annoy the human race,. is there
one more utterly disagreeable than the indisso-
lubility of marriage? It is an instrument of
torture, and a refinement. in the art of ingeni-
ously tormenting. Once I looked on. civilized

life as the only tolerable condition of existence,
but now I am inclined to think that they are
the most fortunate who are the least shackled
by the fetters of formality and the chains of
opinion."
Fitzgeorge was now in that state of mind
which is characteristic of what is with great
propriety called a disappointed man. It was
with great reluctance that he could bring him-
self to acknowledge that he was disappointed.
Year after year, and month after month, the
demolition of one fancy had been the foundation
of another. Yielding to every impulse, and
following every caprice, still he was not what
he wished to be. He never could make present
realities answer to past hopes. He found in no-
thing the sweetness that he had anticipated
A change was now to himself imperceptibly
creeping over him, and he was beginning to
experience and to exhibit that ill-humour which
is the constant concomitant of disappointed
sensuality and mortified pride. In the earlier

37
days of his life he had not been constitutionally
morose, and he had no other ill-humour than
what is inseparable from an overweening pride,
But as his disappointments increased and mul-
tiplied his temper was soured, and from being
out of humour with himself he became out of
humour with the rest of the world. Towards
his friends he carried himself with a humiliating
distance, making them more sensibly feel that
they were rather tolerated companions than
esteemed friends. There is, of course, a plea-
sure in ill-humour, or no one would ever indulge
in it; this was now Fitzgeorge's greatest
pleasure, and as it could not always be conve-
niently vented against those with whom he
associated, it accumulated its force against the
absent and hated wife, reserving its full deve-
lopment for a time when he might have more
power and opportunity to render it effective.

CHAPTER HI.
KOTHEK AND DATTGHTEH.
Finding that, for the present at least, it was
impossible to get rid of his wife, Fitzgeorge
thought that it was his best policy to enjoy him-
self as well as he possibly eould under existing
circumstances. It is the province of inexpe-
rienced youth to look forward to unmingkd en-
joyment, and unabated, unalloyed pleasure; but
riper years bring another lesson, and convince
us that, with all our dexterity and care, we
cannot have every thing our own way; and then
we learn that if we cannot have all that we
wish, it is our wisdom to enjoy what we can.

Soon after the public wife was dismissed, the
private wife resumed her place, dismissing all
jealousy of Mrs. Jemigan. "Ah?" said Fitz-
george to himself, "this is indeed a wife with
whom I may live in peace and with some de-
gree of comfort, especially now that in conse-
quence of my public marriage, this my private
marriage seems less binding. I suppose the
commonplace part of the world, whose vulgar
notions are not worth regard, will imagine that
I have dismissed my public for the sake of my
private wife. Be it so; let the vulgar think
what they may and what they will, I defy them
with all my heart and despise them with all
my soul. In the most ancient nations there is
an imperishable distinction of caste; so that
beings said by Europeans to be of the same
common nature, are kept from all intercourse or
sympathy, and are as much apart as animals of
a different species. There is also a difference
in this country* for what is fashion but another
modification of caste? So long as people of
## p. 40 (#48) ##############################################
40 FITZGEORGE.
fashion keep me in countenance, I need not re-
gard what the rest of the world may say or
think of me."
Now as Fitzgeorge could not have the enjoy-
ment of all the pleasures which he anticipated,
he was driven into the alternative of taking ad-
vantage of such as were offered him. By this
time he had become a little more familiar with
the annoyance of duns, and he was also in the
nature of events much nearer to the possession
of the title and estates. So there was still some-
thing of hope and something of enjoyment. His
moral sentiment, however, had experienced no
improvement by the discipline which he had
undergone; his resentful feelings were rather
stronger, and his selfishness more calculating.
It has been stated in the course of this narra-
tive, that Lady Louisa, the publicly acknow-
ledged wife of Fitzgeorge, had given birth to a
daughter, concerning whom he had thought
comparatively little, inasmuch as he had some
hope that by a new wife he might have a son
## p. 41 (#49) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 41
who should inherit his title and estates: but
when the Simkin conspiracy was so completely
exploded, that there seemed to be no immediate
prospect of obtaining matrimonial liberation;
and when every day rendered it more and more
probable that this daughter would be his sole
heiress, he thought more of her, and was more
anxiously concerned about her. Knowing that
he was at enmity with his own father, he thought
it not improbable that his daughter might be
reared in enmity to her father, especially under
the pupilage of a mother who had been dis-
carded and persecuted and conspired against.
Moreover, as it was an object to continue all
manner of annoyances against the forsaken wife,
it was a very convenient mode of tormenting
her to exercise parental despotism over her
daughter.
We talk very pathetically of the great abomi-
nation of slavery; but we think comparatively
little, or indeed nothing, of the state of slavery
in which the laws of England place women and
## p. 42 (#50) ##############################################
42 FITZGEQRGE.
children. That women should have any voice
in the legislature seems to be universally consi-
dered exactly as absurd, as if it should be pro-
posed to call brute animals into council to
deliberate on the well-being of the state. Power
is in the hands of men; and the men not only
use the power individually, but collectively, by
making laws. All the laws that are made con-
cerning women evidently show that they have
been made by men. Women and children are
by the laws regarded quite as much the pro-
perty of men, as the negro slaves in the West
India islands are taken and believed to be the
property of the whites who have bought or who
do inherit them. The courtesy of individuals
is sometimes better than the law; but if by any
chance one of the ungentler sex should take It
into his head to torment a woman to the ut-
most extent of the law's allowance, he may
make her miserable enough.
The readiest way by which Fitzgeorge could
distress and punish Louisa was by means of
## p. 43 (#51) ##############################################
FITZGEOEGE. 43
withdrawing, as lie had power to do, her daughter
from. her society; and when there is taken into
consideration the profligate life which he him-
self had led and still was leading, it was indeed
a mast insulting mockery to pretend a moral
motive in removing her from her mother's pro-
tection. By this step, also, he was preparing
for himself additional mortifications in the hos-
tility which. he was necessarily nurturing in his
daughter against himself. Gentle as the gentle
sex may be, mild, calm, and quiescent in the
ordinary current of life, yet it has a marvellous
degree of firmness against opposition, and is
capable of no small portion of passive resist-
ance. Whom had the young Louisa to love
but her mother? Surely woman's whole life
and being are love; and when; that love is cir-
cmnscribed, it glows with greater ardour. When
Fitageorge neglected his wife, it did not follow
that the mother should neglect her child, or that
the child should neglect her mother y but it was
exceedingly natural that being deprived of the

44 FITZGEORGE.
love and attention of a husband, Lady Louisa
should regard her only child, her only tie to
life's interests, with a feeling of increased and
still increasing attachment;for they who are
loved and admired by all, think little of the
love and admiration of any one; but they who
are loved by one only, and are neglected, de-
spised, or persecuted by all the rest of the little
or great world in which they live, think much
of the only one that loves them deeply and sin-
cerely.
The young Louisa was a child of great feel-
ing and of strength of mind, capable of strong
emotion and deep affection. Many were the
instructors who were placed about her to furnish
her mind with knowledge, and readily did she
receive the instructions which were communi-
cated to her. If Fitzgeorge himself, who had
been against his inclination forced into a mar-
riage which his repugnance converted into a
greater annoyance than it needed to have been,
had been possessed of sufficient good sense to

FITZGEORGE. 45
take delight in the expanding powers and sweet
affections of his child, he might have had a
pleasure in her society that would have been
some compensation for the wearisomeness of his
wife's company, and which, perhaps, would ul-
timately have rendered her tolerable. But plea-
sures of this kind were not his forte or his
ambition;there was dandyism, frivolity, dis-
play, even in his moral and intellectual plea-
sures. He had tasteand sentiment, such as
it wasbut he loved the magnificent and the
superb. He certainly admired pictures, but he
also admired frames; he loved music, but he
also loved a superbly-decorated music-room,
richly-gilded harps, rosewood cases for piano-
fortes, and morocco bindings for his music-
books; he loved books, but he loved bindings
as well; he enjoyed magnificent scenery, but
he thought that it never looked so well as when
seen through plate glass. He would have loved
his child, but she partook rather too much, for
his taste, of her mother's utter unaffectedness.
## p. 46 (#54) ##############################################

Fifzgeorge, as the reader of this romance may
hare already seen, was in his tastes thoroughly
artificial; whatever was delightful to him in his
home was that which was brought there by the
artists who furnished his house. If he sat with
his Emily, enjoying the pleasure of her con-
versation, he also enjoyed an admiration of the
sumptuous chairs on which they sat;if he
enjoyed his fireside, it was partly owing to the
taste of the ironmonger who had devised and
constructed so superb a stove. All his interests
and affections dwelt on life's surface, and he
resembled the rustic who thought that he should
like to live on peacocks because they had such
fine feathers.
When he first dismissed his wife from his
roof, his child was in her infancy; all her habits
were to be formed, and her affections were wait-
ing for their impulse. Whom, then, but her
mother, could she love? And because she
loved that mother, she and her mother suffered
much. There were many hours when she was

her mother's only companion and only confi-
dant. There were seasons when she heard her
mother's half-stifled sighs, and saw those tears
which looked more sad beeause her mother strove
to hide them. There is a touching beauty in a
tear which is brushed away with a studied un-
concern; but when a child's look is fixed upon
them as they tall from a mother's eye, they rise
too rapidly, and they fall too thickly, to be
easily dispersed.
"Mamma, you are not happy."
"It is not the lot of mortals, my sweet child,
to pass through life without tears. When you
have lived in the world as long as I have, you
will have cause for sorrow; you will remember
the days of your childhood, and sigh over the
memory of them; you will remember the friends
of your youth, and mourn at the thought that
they are no more."
"But you are not in mourning, my dear Mam-
ma."
"I am not, my child, but sorrow often out-

lives the sign of it. There are moments when I
feel unhappy on account of the absence of
friends whom I have lost for many years."
"But how is it, my dear Mamma, that some-
times I see you look cheerful and happy, and
then all on a sudden you cease to look so, and
your eyes are filled with tears,' when I cannot
see that any thing has occurred to give you
pain? The day before yesterday, when Mrs.
Simkin called to see you, and I was brought
into the room, you were very cheerful, and you
laughed very heartily at something that Mrs.
Simkin said; she is indeed a very laughable
woman. I am sure that I could not have laughed
so had I felt unhappy. And even after Mrs.
Simkin was gone, and you desired my governess
to leave me, you were still cheerful, and you
told me some pretty stories, and you talked to
me about my dancing, and when I was showing
you some of my steps, you got up and danced
with me. Can people dance when they are
unhappy? Then, when nothing had happened

to make you unhappy, suddenly you sat down
and drew me towards you, and pressed me in your
arms, and sighed as if your heart would burst."
"My sweet child, I cannot explain all this to
you. You are too young to understand it."
"But shall I be so sorrowful when I am
grown up 1"
"I hope not, my child."
"Well, my dear mamma, I wish I knew what
it is that makes you so unhappy; for when you
are in your sorrowful moods, I feel I can hardly
tell you how, without talking nonsense."
"My dear child, I think you are talking non-
sense now, by saying that you cannot tell me
how you feel without talking nonsense?"
"I will tell you, then, what I mean, perhaps
you can understand me. I feel unhappy that I
cannot be unhappy with you, and that I cannot
weep and sigh as you do. But when you are
happy I can be very happy with you; I can
laugh and dance and enjoy myself very heartily.
Why can you not always be happy?"

"My thoughts will not let me be so, my dear
child."
"Then I hope that when I grow up I shall
be as thoughtless as I am now."
"Rather hope, my sweet one, that your
thoughts will have pleasanter recollections to
dwell upon."
"But when any thing makes me sorry, I am
sorry for a little while, and then when I have
cried I soon forget it, and am sorry for it no
more. Mamma, when you are made sorry, why
can you not cry about it at once and then for-
get it for ever as I do?"
"That is a question not easy to be answered
to your comprehension, dear child. While your
childhood lasts, endeavour to enjoy it, make the
most of its little pleasures, and the least of its
little pains."
"I wish, mamma, to make your pains less."
"You do, my pretty one, your society is my
greatest comfortmy only comfort."

ately, and the trembling child stood by her in a
distressing, because imperfect sympathy.
"Dear, dear mamma, if my society is a com-
fort to you, why does the mention of it make
you weep so bitterly? Speak to me, pray speak
to me."
"I will, I will." Then more tears came, but
the passion was calmer, and the mother replied,
'/ I weep, my dear child, at the mention of your
society, because I know that I cannot have it
always, it must soon be taken from me."
"No, no, I will not leave you, I will not be
taken from youat least not till I am married;
and indeed I think I will never consent to be
married, for marriage does not seem to make
people happy."
"You must leave me, my beloved child;
your father insists upon it."
"I will not leave you; for then I shall have
nobody to love, and nobody to love me."
"Yes, my dear child, you must love your
father, and your father will love you."

"Oh, no, I cannot love my father, for he
does not love you; and he cannot love me,
because he does not love you, whom I love so
dearly. Indeed, how can he love me? He has
seen me very seldom, and has never seemed to
take an interest in me. He has not been to me
as you have, nor have I been to him as I have
been to you. He has never smiled with my
joys, and I have never wept with his sorrows.
Perhaps he has no sorrows."
"Oh, yes, he must have sorrows, though
they do not melt away in tears. They pass
away, perhaps, in awful frowns and furious
indignation."
"I would rather weep than be angry, yet
when I see you weep I feel angry, for I am
disturbed at the thought that any one should
be so wicked as to cause you sorrow."
Scenes like the above often passed between
mother and daughter, and they were not best
calculated to impress the daughter with any
great degree of respectful reverence for her

father. And when she heard that it was the
express command of her father that she should
be altogether separated from her mother, and
that she should be placed under a totally dif-
ferent system^ then did she regard him with a
sad and serious feeling of repugnance. She
then regarded her father as being influenced by
a cruel and bitter feeling, as delighting more in
the exercise of a father's authority, than in the
development of a father's love and kindness.
So far, indeed, as paternal affection is con-
cerned, Fitzgeorge had not before him any
good or valuable example. He had not expe-
rienced affection or friendship from his own
father, and was not prepared to exercise it to-
wards his own child. And, notwithstanding
this, Fitzgeorge yet entertained the idea, that
life was capable of affording him a high degree
of happiness and enjoyment. No stronger proof
can be given of the weakness of his mind and
the illogicalness of his reasoning than this ima-

gination, that the happiness of life consisted in,
and might be produced by, matters altogether
external and superficial. Myriads, as well as
he, have made the mistake, and of course have
found it to be a mistake;and yet very few of
them even when they have discovered their
error and have felt it by bitter experience,
have had wisdom or magnanimity enough to
acknowledge it even to themselves; but they
have gone on in the same track, and have used
all manner of means, and have sacrificed all
manner of principle, to obtain that enjoyment
which they have fancied to belong to matters
of an external nature. With different minds,
the disappointment produces different effects.
Some retain amidst the ruins of their hopes and
the wreck of their expectations a lively, light-
hearted gaiety, laughing at the world and all
hat it contains; and even though themselves
may be impoverished by extravagance, and have
become contemptible in the sight of all honest

and sober men by reason of the recklessness of
their sensuality, they go laughing on as they
sink lower and lower in the dust of abasement,
till at last they vanish from the world nobody
knows or cares when, where, or how. But
others when the world has disappointed them,
or rather when they have disappointed them-
selves by means of the world, are not only
miserable because they are not happy, but are
angry and morose, superbly savage and in-
dignant, finding in a mighty haughtiness of
manner, a little consolation for the absence of
that gaiety of heart, after which they have been
vainly and even painfully striving.
Of this latter number was Fitzgeorge; he
had formed to himself a scheme of enjoyment
in which he had been greatly disappointed, but
he would not let the world know how deeply
he felt the disappointment. He looked upon
the world proudly and morosely, he saw my-
riads around him happier than himself, and he

thought that they ought not to be so, and
he hated them for being so. But if any
one in the whole compass of his acquaint-
ance more deeply moved his indignation than
another, it was his wife. Though she dwelt
not under the same roof with himself, though
he never saw her, and though every luxury
was around and about him, yet the thought
of this living clog dwelt upon his mind and
he wished more than he would say. It is
not, therefore, to be wondered at, that he
should listen eagerly to any reproachful ru-
mours against her, and of course, after heeding
those rumours and believing them as far as his
wish, and much farther than the evidence, it
was natural enough that he should continue the
prosecution which he had begun, and that if the
law did not give him the liberty that he desired,
he should use for the purpose of annoyance, all
the power which the law did give him. The power
which the law gave him, was power over his

own child, which power he exercised tyranni-
cally and insultingly;tyrannically, because
he tore a weeping child from the bosom of a
weeping mother;insultingly, because he af-
firmed that the mother was not a fit companion
or instructress of her child.She must have
been bad indeed, if she was not much better
than the father.However, Fitzgeorge removed
the child from the mother and placed her under
other instructors. So far he had persecuted
and insulted his wife as much as lay in his
power, and was prepared to take every oppor-
tunity that might offer for continuing the system
of persecution.
Fitzgeorge was now surrounded in his own
undivided mansion by friends and flatterers,
who paid him homage almost amounting to
idolatry. His wife was away from him, his
daughter had been separated from her mother,
his house was splendidly furnished, his table
was superb with plate and culinary skill, his
tailors had done the utmost that art could do

no. He was miserable because he was fat, he

miserable because he could not be all his life
a slender youth as full of graces and affectations
as a dancing-master's perfumed apprentice.

CHAPTER IV.
FRIENDS AND ENEMIES.
To a selfish man, an old friend is as great a
nuisance as a new enemy; because the oldness
of his friendship gives him a kind of liberty
which is not agreeable to the pride of selfish-
ness; and because the amusement of his com-
pany is abated for want of novelty. Fitzgeorge
was not at all inclined to undergo any voluntary
annoyances for the sake of old acquaintance.
He recollected the time when his old acquaint-
ance were new, and that time seen through the
vista of past years looked bright and gay. He
forgot that even then he was but laying the
^

foundation of his temple of hope and happiness,
he forgot that even then he was merely full of
promise, and that pleased as he might be with
all around him, his principal bliss was then in
the future tense. But now, that which had
been the future was become the past. And
how did it look?Flat, stale, and unprofitable!
That seemed to be best which was most remote.
Reverting to the past, his very boyhood, from
which he had been so eager to emerge, seemed
to have been a far pleasanter state than his
present glorious middle of manhood. Surely
nature by giving to man the power of anticipa-
tion and reflection, intends to make some amends
for the harshness of reality by the bright and
soft contrast of imagination! But is it not very
strangecan any thing be strange that is uni-
versal?What then shall we say?Is it not
well worthy of remark that during the whole
course of life, man is grumbling at the present
as a condition of misery and annoyance, looking
forward to the future for something really worth

FITZGEORGE. 61
having and enjoying; and yet as he advances
in life, finds that every thing is worse and
worse; and that the past, especially if it be
past a very long while ago, was the only truly
happy period of existence? The golden age is
the age of recollected youth; it is not the age
of actually existing youth, and we never know
that it is, but in a lapse of years we find out
that it has been.
How mysterious a thing is being! Fitzgeorge
felt it to be so, but he did not think or did not
apply his thoughts to the practical management
of his mind, so that what ought to have been to
him a means of wisdom and a source of sweet
philosophy became a wearisome annoyance. He
sacrificed his mind, if he ever had any, to cooks,
tailors, perfumers, and jewellers. He was so
much taken up with the surface of life that he
never thought of entering into its substance.
He even mistook, and that almost wilfully, the
intention of nature, or more properly speaking
of that great Being who rules nature, in exer-

eking the mind with the discipline of pain; for
nature, a name, be it observed, which we here
use to avoid an irreverent repetition of a greater
name, exercises the mind with pain in order
that by feeling it may be led to thought, and by
thought be led to rational happiness. For a
rational being can be only happy through
rational means. But Fitzgeorge would not
think; he could hope and wish and thus push
his happiness before him, which he could never
overtake any more than a man can stand on the
shadow of his own head in a long summer
evening.
Now Fitzgeorge began to be tired of some of
his friends; not, perhaps, before they had begun
to be tired of him. They had found that he
would do them no good; which discovery came
to them in the shape of the proposition that they
could do him no good. It is, perhaps, pretty
much the same thing; for he that is evil to him-
self to whom will he be good? He was tired of
himself and so he thought that he was tired of
>
## p. 63 (#71) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 63
his friends. When indeed a man is tired of
himself he is tired of every thing; for every man
is his own world, and the heart makes its own
clouds and its own sunshine. He was also tired
of his enemies; and now about this time he felt
himself happy to get rid of one of them, and
that was a principal one, no less a personage
than Mr. Graves. This Mr. Graves, who though
not an old man had been a long while in the
service of the family of Fitzgeorge, had had in
that service a great deal of hard work, and a
great many anxious hours. He had been, by his
ambition of making himself a great man in the
service of the family, compelled to a constant
vigilance and unremitting diligence. He had
endeavoured to manage Lord and Lady Fitz-
george, and to humour them both in their whims
and caprices; this he found no easy task, for
they often had different and opposite crotchets.
As for the tenants he cared nothing about them
so long as he could keep his own place and
manage his master and mistress, and he found
## p. 64 (#72) ##############################################
64 FITZGEORGE.
that the most effectual way to manage them
was to humour them and to be subservient to
them. Now Lord Fitzgeorge was a very litigi-
ous man, and exceeding fond of going to law
with his neighbours, if it were merely about a
load of straw. Mr. Graves, indeed, had sense
enough to know that law always costs more than
it is worth; but instead of dissuading his master
from involving himself in law-suits, he rather
encouraged him in it; for by that he kept him-
self in his place and increased himself in con-
sequence. He must, indeed, have known that
the estate could not bear the ruinous and heavy
expense; but that signified'nothing to him, so
long as he could retain his place and influence.
Though as for the matter of influence, every
body knew that he was more influenced than
influencing. Lord Fitzgeorge, indeed, for the
gratification of his own taste, would have been
at law all his life long, and Mr. Graves was not
by any means unwilling to humour him. The
estate, however, was very much injured by it,
^
## p. 65 (#73) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 65
and the tenants and friends of Lord Fitzgeorge
would have dissuaded him from continuing this
ruinous process, but Mr. Graves kept all advice
away from his master's ear, but that which he
was pleased to give him himself; and that ad-
vice of course was merely the echo of his lord-
ship's own fancies. Mr. Graves also was parti-
cularly careful to keep from the ear of Lord
Fitzgeorge all complaints of the tenants, and if
any by accident did approach his lordship, the
crafty steward had no hesitation in telling his
master that the tenants in general were exceed-
ingly well satisfied, and that it was only a few
idle and discontented fellows, that ought to be
turned out of their farms, who made any com-
plaint at all; and his lordship was very willing
to believe him.
Things, however, at last went on so badly,
the lawyers were such a set of rogues, that Lord
Fitzgeorge was sadly cheated and was nigh
being absolutely ruined. Mr. Graves had so
far committed himself that he could neither
## p. 66 (#74) ##############################################
66 FITZGEORGE.
proceed with honour, nor recede with safety, so
he took to drinking. He always had a propen-
sity to that vice from the very first, but in con-
sequence of the scrape into which he had brought
his master's affairs, he stuck to the bottle closer
than ever. He was never able to do any thing
in the way of business till he was half seas over;
and sometimes in his drunken fits he would
issue most extravagant orders, and involve poor
Lord Fitzgeorge in most enormous expenses, the
consequence of which was that the estate be-
came mortgaged to a ruinous excess. Of course
Augustus could not be very well pleased with
that, for he was afraid, that when he might come
into possession, he should not have enough to
indulge himself in those pleasures and pomps
of architectural magnificence which he antici-
pated. However, hard work and hard drink-
ing were too much for Mr. Graves, they at
last carried him off. The tenants were not
sorry for that, nor was Augustus Fitz-
george. But Lord Fitzgeorge himself was very
## p. 67 (#75) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 67
much troubled to find a successor for Mr.
Graves; and well indeed he might be, for the
estate had got into such a condition that it re-
quired no common ingenuity to keep things at
all together. The place of course was adver-
tised in all the newspapers, and many applica-
tions were made for it. But it was soon seen
that many of the applicants knew nothing of
the business and duties of the situation, that
they merely wanted to get a snug birth for them-
selves, and to have the means of providing for a
family; for Lord Fitzgeorge's steward had a
great many good places at his disposal in his
lordship's kitchen, stable, farm-yard, and dairy.
But his lordship wanted for steward a man who
had ability to do something more than merely
to give away good places to his cousins and
his bastards. Among other applicants for the
place was Lionel Leppard. Now Lord Fitz-
george did not like this man at all, because he
had taken part with the tenants against the late
steward, and he was also a man of somewhat
## p. 68 (#76) ##############################################
68 FITZGEORGE.
obstinate temperament, and withal a little con-
scientious, so that he was not likely to be half
so useful to his master as Mr. Graves had been.
Futhermore, Lionel Leppard had once very
much offended Lord Fitzgeorge, by using some
language in the steward's hall very derogatory
to landlords. He had said, or something to that
purpose, that estates might be cultivated with
landlords, but could not be cultivated without
tenants and labourers. Now Lord Fitzgeorge
himself had a very high idea of the dignity and
importance of landlords, thinking them to be of
infinitely more value than tenants or labourers.
He thought, it was indeed the fault of his edu-
cation, poor man, he thought that estates were
made for landlords, and that the only use of
tenants was to pay rents, and that the only use
of labourers was to cultivate the earth, and that
all this was for the sake of the high and mighty
landlord who was the peculiar if not sole care of
the] overruling Providence that governs all
things. Lionel Leppard, however, had thought
## p. 69 (#77) ##############################################
FITZGEOEGE. 69
otherwise; he had imagined that there was as
much importance and value in tenants as in
landlords, in labourers as in tenants; and, per-
haps, he might have thought, but he had too
much wit to say it in the presence or hearing of
any of the Fitzgeorge family, that there was no
one who could be better spared than the land-
lord, who did nothing but ride about in a fine
coach and look big.
Be it, however, as it may, Lord Fitzgeorge
could not help himself, but was forced to
take into his service this Lionel Leppard, who
after all his big talk to Mr. Graves, and his
mighty profession of managing matters better
than any one that had gone before him, made
no great hand at his office; the tenants knew
no difference, and the estate did not prosper
much better than before.
Now Fitzgeorge thought as an old acquaint-
ance of his had got the management of his
father's affaire he should be able, perhaps, to
get a little more money out of the old gentleman;
r
## p. 70 (#78) ##############################################
70 FITZGEORGE.
but it was all the same as attempting to get
blood out of a post. There was none to be got.
Fitzgeorge therefore very properly said to him-
self, "What is the use of friends that are of no
use?" Then he began to speculate much about
friendsphi, but that puzzled him as all other
attempts at moral or intellectual analysis did.
He knew exceedingly well the anatomy of a coat>
but he was not a good hand at anatomizing the
human heart.
In a short time Lionel Leppard, like his pre-
decessor Mr. Graves, was worried to death by
the fatigues and botheration of his office; and
Fitzgeorge pretended to be mighty sorry for the
loss of his dear friend. There was not, however,
mnch real sorrow in the matter. The sorrows
of Fitzgeorge were only for the personal incon-
venience which he was exposed to, and it was
no great personal inconvenience to be deprived
of one who rather reminded him of humiliating
passages in his past life, and who was not likely
to be of any great service to him in assisting
N
## p. 71 (#79) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 71
him in the matter of money. Lionel Leppard
was a very good companion for Fitzgeorere when
they were both in their best humours, for there
was much life in their conversation, there was
wit in one and the relish of wit in the other.
But for a regular thick and thin friend Leppard
was not well adapted; he had notions of inde-
pendence, and of a less bending integrity than
suited the taste or convenience of Fitzgeorge.
So when he was gone, though he might be
missed for a moment he was not deeply and
permanently lamented. Thus friend and enemy
were removed. Graves was gone, and Leppard
soon did follow him.
Lord Bacon says that a man dies as often as
he loses a friend, and it may also be said that a
man dies as often as he loses an enemy. For
what is life but a compages of interests and
sensations? and the interests are greater than
the sensations, inasmuch as sensation is exter-
nal, and interests are in our very hearts and in
the nucleus of our being. For a while man
lives making new friends and new enemies, and

72 FITZGEORGE.
so long his life is increasing in the intensity
of its interests and the multitudinous delight-
fulness of its being; for as friends are not un-
mixedly agreeable, enemies are not unmixedly
disagreeable. But a time comes slowly perhaps,
unobservedly but surely, when the mental elas-
ticity abates, when a man becomes too prudent
to make new enemies, too passionless to make
new friends. Then we begin to dieour leaves
are then falling on the ground, we partake less
and less of the name and nature of legion, our
expansiveness suffers a reaction, and we are
contracting again to the almost solitary unit
from which we set out.
Fitzgeorge observed not this contraction, for
his friends fell away from him with no greater
rending than the dry branch breaks from the
withered tree. He thought not that here were
monitions for himself in the mutations of life.
He had an art of living so thoroughly in the
contemplation of his own selfish sensations and
proud imaginations, that friends were not to him

FITZGEORGE. 73
as they are to the great multitude of the human
race, he was surrounded by them, but did not
sympathize with them beyond the apprehension
of their convenience to himself. He was very
happy in imagining and constructing a splendid
mansion, and he was happy in thought of the
eyes that should gaze upon it with admiration;
but he cared not whose eyes they were, so long
as they were admiring eyes. He was happy in
the admiration of himself as constructed by the
art of the tailor, and in the thought of the admi-
ration which would greet him as he passed along
the streets, or rode in the park. He was happy
in the possession of many brilliant toys to
which he cleaved with a child-like affection.
Friends might sink into the silent tomb, cold-
ness might creep upon the heart, and death
might relax the cordially grasping hand; but
if the spring of a musical snuff-box should
break, an artist in mechanics might restore it,
and the music would be as sweet as ever.
Bright eyes might grow dim and vanish into

darkness, but the brilliant diamond would spar-
kle for ever brighter and sweeter than human
eyes. He that dined at the table of Fitzgeorge
to-day, might to-morrow be served up himself
as a sweet morsel for the worms, but cooks
would not be wanting in Fitzgeorge's kitchen,
nor gilded plate upon his sideboard, nor admir-
ing guests at his table.
Still there remained of his friends the most
supple and subservient of all; still, with a spaniel-
like fidelity and patient servility, Drury Bor-
rowman was at his service, finding, however,
no other reward of his services than the pleasure
of servitude. No one ever served another with
more constant fidelity than did Borrowman serve
Fitzgeorge. There was more than zeal, there
was devotedness in the service.
At length, however, the messenger that comes
for all came for Borrowman, and where did it
find him? not in the mansion of Fitzgeorge, not
at the table of him whom he had served through
life with an undeviating and disinterested inte-

grity; but far away from the scenes of his friend-
ship and fidelity. Fitzgeorge was gay and glo-
rious, bright and brilliant, courting and catching
admiration, surrounded by every luxury, satu-
rated with life's indulgences, devising new forms
of splendour, and new modes of enjoyment
.
But Drury Borrowman had ceased to please.
He was in the numerous list of Fitzgeorge's for-
gotten ones. And what more could he expect?
what else could he expect? neglect was the
natural termination of such services rendered to
such a friend. For many months Fitzgeorge
had seen nothing of Borrowman, and of course
had thought as little as he had seen; for he had
given Borrowman to understand that his com-
pany was no longer desired, and his services for
the future might be dispensed with. There
came at length to the ears of Fitzgeorge a re-
port that Borrowman was hastening to the re-
pose which mortal cares cannot disturb, and
that in his passage thither he stood in need of
that assistance which is almost as painful to re-

ceive as to need. A late, reluctant, chilling
charity was the first and last service which the
Honourable Augustus rendered to his steadiest,
surest, and most unflinching friend.
Fitzgeorge was one of those persons who are
never likely to be more alone than they wish to
be. He had the means of attracting society and
even of selecting it. Not very remarkable either
for wisdom or for goodness, yet his rank and
fashion could always command, if he desired it,
the society of those who are pleased to call
themselves the wise and good. He was so much
of the gentleman, that he might with impunity
indulge in those trangressions which would be
the death without redemption of any other man's
reputation. This may be thought a privilege;
but it is a privilege of very equivocal and doubt-
ul good, or rather it may be said, of certain
evil. For man is a dependent being and must
needs be dependent, as he is placed in society
to form a co-operating part of one great mass;
he is not merely gifted with impulses that move
## p. 77 (#85) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 77
him, but with certain susceptibilities by which
these impulses may be directed, and may be
preserved from doing great injury to society
and to himself. The principal of these suscep-
tibilities is a sense of shame. Suppose all
restraint from this cause to be removed, then
the check which prevents man from injuring
society being taken away, he is left at liberty
not only to be injurious to society, but to be
injurious to himself; and so constructed is man
for social life, that he cannot be injurious to
society in any great degree without hurting
himself, nor can he deeply injure himself with-
out transgressing the laws which bind him to
his duty to society. To be freed, then, from
the restraints which ordinarily influence human
beings, may be considered a privilege so far
as liberty is concerned, but is not a blessing
so far as happiness is concerned. This Fitz-
george did feel; but he knew not on what prin-
ciple it was that he found it impossible for him
to enjoy happiness, notwithstanding all the
## p. 78 (#86) ##############################################

pains he took, and all the instruments which
were afforded him.
"Tis strange," said he, in his meditations,
"that a person situated as I am, and endowed
with so many privileges and honours above the
rest of mankind, should not be able to pass
through life without these incessant annoyances.
Are all mankind miserable, and are many of
them more miserable than I am? I suppose it
must be so; for I am often reading in the papers
accounts of wretched men destroying them-
selves. A coroner's jury politely calls them
mad; but it is misery that has driven them mad.
Now, with all the annoyances that I have suf-
fered, and am yet enduring, I have never been
driven to think of that mode of ending my
troubles. Perhaps, then, my peculiar privilege
is, not so much to be happier than the rest of
the world as to be less miserable than most
people. I have often seen people in stations
inferior to mine, whom I have almost envied.
Perhaps the same persons have envied me. I

am now in what is called the middle of life, and
I can recollect no part of my life more delight-
ful than my first moments of liberty and hope
when I came of age, and was the object of uni-
versal admiration. And yet, if I recollect aright,
great part of the pleasure of that time was the
pleasure of hope, the hope of what I should be
in after days. Many of those days are gone
and what am I nowand what have I been?
If I have not enjoyed what I once hoped to en-
joy, I certainly have enjoyed the pleasures of
hope in their full extent. And is there no room
for hope even now? Yes, there is abundant
room. I am even yet in the very prime and vi-
gour of my life. I have many years to look for-
ward to. I have higher honours to reach, and
greater wealth to enjoy. I am now under re-
straints, from which in a few years I shall be
delivered. I shall yet have it in my power to
indulge my passion for architecture, and to dis-
play my taste in furniture. I may yet be the
mark of admiration, and the model of excel-

lence in manners and in dress. I am now in the
prime of lifein the strength and vigour of my
faculties. I have learned something by expe-
rience, and am wiser than when I first com-
menced my career of brilliancy. And in spite
of all drawbacks, I have been a person of dis-
tinction and consequence, and am so still, and
shall be so still more. What cause have I then
to despair? The world has not been aware of
my annoyances and troubles. People have
looked upon me, and have seen me for the most
part only in my glory and pomp, which they
have no doubt envied. They have not looked
into my thoughts, nor shall they ever. Surely
there is something delightful and pleasurable in
the power of keeping people at a distance, and
in having the distant respect of the admiring
multitude. If I cannot be happy, who can?
I am strangely perplexed to account for the
fact, that with me the experiment of life has
hitherto failed. Perhaps what remains may be
more fortunate. If I thought that Cicero's
## p. 81 (#89) ##############################################
FITZGEORGE. 81
Treatise on Old Age could convince me by its
reasoning, I would read it again, and look for-
ward to the latter days of my life, in hope of
receiving in them a compensation for the dis-
appointments of my younger days. But no
no !'tis absolutely impossible, in the nature of
things, that old age should have comforts or
joys which youth and manhood have not. Of
that which is pleasant the dregs are frequently
unpleasant; surely, therefore, of that which is
unpleasant we cannot expect to find the dregs
pleasant."

CHAPTER V.
A CHANGE WITH SOME HOPE.
It must be acknowledged that there is some-
thing superficially marvellous in the fact that a
man, not lacking an average share of under-
standing, should give the whole strength and
application of his mind to one object and fail
in that; yet the wonder ceases when we take
into consideration that the object thus sought
after is in its nature unattainable. Fitzgeorge
was seeking after a degree of content with
mere physical enjoyment, which no intelligent
being can possibly enjoy. He reasoned almost
childishly on this one topic, and was disap-

pointed because lie did not find himself so
happy in his splendid and luxurious mode of
life as he appealed to be, to those who were in
situations far remote from such splendour and
luxury. He forgot that life's pleasures grew
out of its pains, and that its pains grew out of
its pleasures;therefore he sought out with
great diligence all modes of indulgence, but
there arose from them all an after reckoning
of wearisome disgust, to say nothing of duns.
There is a little pleasure in the ingenious con-
struction and combination of a new kind of
punch, there is a pleasure in drinking it, and
there is a pleasure in hearing other drinkers
praise it. There is a pleasure, too, in the bright
and brilliant conversation which sparkles and
dazzles, and pleases the vanity of the excited
talkers, and which newspapers are pleased to
call " the feast of reason and the flow of soul."
The pleasure increases as the drink mounts
higher with its fumes into the region of the
brain, and there would be a mortification in

quitting voluntarily a delightful excitement; so
indulgence goes on till it becomes a nuisance,
and all is blather, and bother, and babble and
brawl: so much for the feast of reason and the
flow of soul. Then the next morning come
nasty headachs, tottering knees, weak hands,
dull eyes, and a general unstringing of the
system. This is bad enoughbut the cup of
misery rises. still higher by the assistance of
the wine-merchant's bill.Moreover, it is a
very pretty thing indeed, to have a great many
precious stones, curiously set and formed into
divers ingenious devices; but these precious
stones never look so well and so prettily, as
they do the first time that they are worn and
admired. It is delightful to have a variety of
gold snuff-boxes set with diamonds and pearls,
and fitted up with music, or with little birds
that pop out of the lid and clap their little
wings, and move their little beaks, and sing all
as natural as life; but their first song is the plea-
santest, and their music grows very annoying

when the jeweller's bill has been sent in time
after time, accompanied with disagreeable im-
portunities. It is pleasant also to survey a noble
army of boots and breeches, and to have in
one's own peculiar wardrobe, and for one's own
peculiar use, clothing enough to supply a re-
giment of soldiers; but it is very unpleasant
to pay for them, and still more to be unable
to pay for them. Pleasures like these were en-
joyed, and troubles like these were endured,
by the Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge, in the course
of his eventful life. These pleasures and these
troubles were also rather increasing than di-
minishing; so the life of Fitzgeorge was full of
agitations.
But about this time an event took place,
which made a change in the occupations, and
gave a brightness to the prospects of our hero.
We have said that Mr. Graves, who had been
Lord Fitzgeorge's steward for so many years,
was no more, and that his successor, Lionel
Leppard, soon followed him. At the time of

which we are now writing, there was in that
situation one Mr. Spenser, a good sort of man
enough, but a bit of a spooney, having just wit
enough to collect the rents and to keep the
books; but he was not at all equal to any thing
in the way of improving the estate. Lord Fitz-
george had been almost all his life involved in
law-suits, and when Mr. Graves was living, he
took mighty delight in them, and conducted
them, as he thought, with a great deal of skill,
but in several cases he was outwitted, and Lord
Fitzgeorge's estate suffered accordingly, being
of necessity most deeply mortgaged. Now,
when Mr. Spenser took the management of his
lordship's estate, the law-suit was still going on,
and Lord Fitzgeorge seemed very likely to get
the better, not so much by the justice of the
case, or by the dexterity of his steward, as by
the clumsy conduct of the opposing party, who
foolishly laid himself open to be completely de-
feated in a variety of points. At this juncture
it so happened, that his lordship fell so ill as
k

to be incapable of attending to any business; it
became, therefore, absolutely necessary that
some one should be appointed to act for him.
Fitzgeorge was now considerably more ad-
vanced in years than he had been on the for-
mer occasion, when Lady Fitzgeorge and Mr.
Graves were preparing, in consequence of his
lordship's illness, to take the sole management
of the affairs into their own hands. Moreover,
Lord Fitzgeorge himself was also considerably
older, and of course the chances of his decease
were greater. Lady Fitzgeorge and Mr. Spen-
ser, therefore, thought that they ought not to
offend or irritate Augustus, by leaving him out
of their party in the consultation as to what was
to be done in the present emergency. Yet at
the same time they did not like to trust every
thing in his handsso they entered into a kind
of compromise or capitulation; indeed, they
thought that if they did not do so, the tenants
would be apt to suspect something wrong. They
agreed, therefore, to let Augustus take a share,

and a pretty considerable one too, in the ma-
nagement of affairs.
Now this Mr. Spenser was one of the party
who had been engaged in the investigation of
Lady Louisa's conduct, and- he had very de-
cidedly expressed his opinion, that there was
no ground whatever of any serious complaint
against the lady. He had said that the whole
affair was a mere matter of idle talk and ill-
natured censoriousness on the part of Mr. and
Mrs. Simkin. He was therefore very much
afraid, that when Augustus should succeed to
the title and estates, there would be a change
not much to Mr. Spenser's advantage; so, by
way of giving. a hint that he would not interfere
with Augustus in his, endeavours to get rid of
his wife, he signified his readiness to surrender
all the memorandums which he had taken of
the investigation, with a hint, however, at the
same time, that he would publish them to the
world, in order to show the meanness of the
conspiracy, and the groundlessness of the ac-

cusation, if Augustus would not pledge himself
to keep him in the stewardship, whatever might
happen. This of course Fitzgeorge was ready
enough to agree to, for he would not on any
account have any suspicion thrown on the cre-
dibility of Mr. and Mrs. Simkin. He therefore
accepted Mr. Spenser's offer, with the under-
standing, that in case of any future inquiry he
should give all the weight of his ingenuity and
sophistry against the accusedand as Mr.
Spenser had been brought up to the law, he
could easily do that.
It is a notion that some people have taken
into their heads for want of consideration, that
noblemen who have large estates and a numerous
tenantiy, have nothing to do but to enjoy the
pomps and vanities and luxuries of life. This
is, indeed, a very great error, for they have a
great deal more to do, especially if they happen
to be engaged in litigation. Augustus Fitz-
george, himself, we rather incline to believe,
entertained some such erroneous notion as this,
m

and supposed that all that he should have to
do as Lord Fitzgeorge, would be to dwell in
more splendid mansions, and to entertain large
parties. Even, however, as the mere locum
tenens of Lord Fitzgeorge, he found a great deal
more occupation than he had calculated upon,
and much more than suited his habits of indo-
lence, and love of rest. He had imagined that
the principal difference to him would be the
command of more money, and the enjoyment
of more honour. These advantages he certainly
had, but with them came much more labour, and
toil than pleased him. This was, indeed, very
provoking, because it seemed to be an addi-
tional illustration of the mingled aspect of human
life, and a further proof that every advantage
is attended and accompanied by some disad-
vantage.
There was, however, some hope in the change
which had thus taken place in his condition;
for a promise seemed now held out to him that
he would not long be kept from the full enjoy-

ment of his title and estates, and there was also
a prospect that he should be able to get alto-
gether rid of his wife. For this purpose he
adopted most ingenious policy. He began now
to see, or to pretend to see, that the friends
with whom he had hitherto associated, and the
companions whom he had heretofore kept, were
not suitable associates for him now, in his more
advanced years, and in his more important
situation; so he attached himself to his father's
friends, and they were glad of his countenance
and patronage, for they saw that in the course
of nature he could not be long out of posses-
sion of the estates and title. They received
him, therefore, with the utmost cordiality, and
they were prepared to go any lengths to serve
him, provided they did not put themselves to
any inconvenience; that is, to no other incon-
venience than the loss of their characters,
which, to them, indeed, did not signify much,
for they were as well lost as kept, perhaps
better. He now thought that he should be sure

92 FITZGEORGE.
to get rid of his wife, which step was that on
which he had set his heart, and which he had
considered as a sine qua non towards the pride
and happiness which he should enjoy when he
should become Lord Fitzgeorge. To his do-
mestic or private wife, Emily, he was still at-
tached, as much perhaps as he could be at-
tached to any one personally, or affectionately,
but she could not be his publicly acknowledged
wife; and he was desirous of having a public
wife for the exhibition of drapery, jewellery,
decorations, and all the paraphernalia which
make the "human form divine" a clumsy imi-
tation of a peacock.
Finding now that his new friends, Mr. Spen-
ser and his coadjutors, were prepared to regard
Lady Louisa as not altogether innocent of the
crimes imputed to her, and knowing that his
old friends had already declared their opinion
of her guilt, he concluded that now there would
be nobody to say a word in her behalf, and that
of course all the world would believe any evil

FITZGEORGE. 93
stories that might be invented. But, alas! such
is the frailty of human hopes that he was griev-
ously disappointed here: for as his new friends
had changed their minds, his old friends had
changed theirs also. And while the steward
Spenser, and all those that were with him,
began to think that Lady Louisa was rightly
accused, those on the other side, who had been
the friends of Augustus, began to think that she
had been falsely accused. So Fitzgeorge gained
nothing by the change.
The next step towards preparing the minds of
the public and of his neighbours for another accu-
sation, was to circulate with great diligence the
rumour that they who had formerly thought the
Lady Louisa innocent had now changed their
minds, and had come to the conclusion that she
was guilty; but, unfortunately the other party let
it be known that they also had changed their
and minds, that from believing her to be guilty they
now believed her to be innocent. The change,
therefore, which Fitzgeorge had thought a mighty
## p. 94 (#102) #############################################
94 FITBGEORGE.
thing in his favour, amounted to nothing, or>
indeed, to worse than nothing; for the public,
seeing the facility with which both parties
changed their minds, according as they stood
in favour or not, naturally concluded that the
only real evidence of guilt was in the wish of
Augustus. While, then, Augustus fancied that
a change had taken place in his favour, so far
as the influencing of the public opinion was
concerned, the fact happened to be quite the
reverse; for the public, who, in the first in-
stance, saw a division of opinion, knew not
which was right and which was wrong; but
when both parties changed opinion so readily,
then the public saw and knew clearly enough
that the whole affair was a mere contrivance,
and a very clumsy one too; that there was no
truth or honesty in the parties, but that they
were ready to say or unsay any thing that their
feeders might tell them.
Now Mr. and Mrs. Simkin were in hopes
that as Augustus Fitzgeorge had got the ma-

FITZGEORGE. 95
nagement of the estates into his hands in a
great measure, and as the old gentleman was
in bad health, and soon likely to make a va-
cancy, there would be a very good opportunity
for renewing their accusation, especially since
they had heard that Mr. Spenser and his party
had intimated a change in their opinion. By
this time the worthy couple had reconsidered
their evidence, and had concocted their story
with greater consistency; therefore they gave
Mr- Spenser a hint, that if he wished to have
the matter set at rest, they were perfectly com-
petent now to give such a coherent testimony,
and on oath too, as must procure a verdict from
any jury. Mr. Spenser, therefore, hastened to
lay before Augustus Fitzgeorge the intimation
which he had received from the Simkin family.
"I am afraid," said Fitzgeorge, " that it will
answer no purpose. What is your own opinion,
Spenser?"
Mr. Spenser was a very formal man, and in a

very prosy manner he replied, "If, sir, you
would have me speak the truth"
"Yes, yes," said Fitzgeorge, hastily inter-
rupting him, " I would have you speak the truth
on the present occasion, and on all occasions,
except when I desire you to tell lies."
"The truth, then, is," replied Mr. Spenser,
"that the character of the Simkins is such, that
I do not think that any one would believe them
even upon their oath; therefore swearing or not
swearing all amounts to nothing. Your best
policy now with respect to your wife, is to en-
I deavour to get up a new accusation altogether.
These Simkins were not well trained before-
hand; and though they are ready to swear any
thing, the worst of it is, they are too ready. If
you yourself were to draw up the accusation,
with all the particulars, they would swear to
any thing that you might be pleased to dic-
tate."
"Then you are of opinion," said Fitzgeorge,

FITZGEORGE. 97
"that it would not be politic to revive thi ac-
cusation V
"I am most decidedly so. You will do
better if you can contrive to have her surrounded
by a new set of acquaintances; and if you can
send some confidential person privately to watch
all her movements, and to report every thing
that can be construed into an evidence of guilt,
always keeping in view the great truth, that no-
thing can be done without money."
"Believe me, Spenser," replied Fitzgeorge,
"I am so anxious to get rid of her, that I
would willingly pay for a divorce half as much
as I gained by marrying her."
"But you see," replied Mr. Spenser, "thai
your situation is one of considerable difficulty
and delicacy; you must not be too hastyyou
must endeavour, the next time that you lay
your plot, to have every thing consistent and
coherent, otherwise your late friends, who knew
the whole trick, will be able, by their know-
ledge, to thwart and defeat you."

Fitzgeorge took the steward by the hand
very condescendingly, and said, "Spenser, you
are a good fellow, and I am really inclined to
think that my father's friends are my best
friends, and that if I had consulted them in the
first instance, they would have been of more
service to me than my own friends have been."
"That they certainly would," replied Mr.
Spenser, "for this plain reason, that your fa-
ther's are men of business, and your own friends,
or rather your old friends, were men of pleasure.
To get through life, you may rest assured that
nothing is like sticking close to business."
"Ah!" replied Fitzgeorge, with a sigh, " I
never was a man of business, and I fear I never
shall be. It is now too late in the day for me
to think of acquiring new habits. I am already
fifty years old and very fatvery fat indeed!"
"Not at all too much so," replied the polite
steward, "for your time of life."
"Why, my good fellow, there is the very
mischief; my corpulency reminds me of my time
^

of life. No, rip, I shall never be a man of bu-
siness. J find it troublesome enough already
to have only the partial management of affairs j
I am sure I know not what I shall do when the
whole business devolves on me."
( a Oh! you need give yourself no concern
about that," answered Mr. Spenser; "your
friends will take care to save you as much
trouble as they possibly can."
; u I tell you what, Mr. Spenser," .replied
Fitzgeorge, "I have no concern or care about
the management of the estate, except as to the
ways and means for the supply of my expenses;
I shall leave every thing else to you, and to
your friends; you will take care of me for your
Own sakes. So long as I don't want money, I
shall find no fault with you; and if you give
me no trouble, I shall give you none."
This was exactly the sort of arrangement
to suit Mr. Spenser, for he was at one time
very much afraid of losing his place, and h$
knew that if he should lose it, it would go very

hard with him to get a living, for he was not
one of the brightest men in the world. So he
found that it would be very good policy in him
to be subservient to the humours of Fitzgeorge,
and to indulge him in as much indolence as
might please him. As Mr. Spenser belonged to
that gulled and gulling fraternity called the wise
and good, he endeavoured to bring Fitzgeorge
to enrol himself in the same fraternity. In-
deed, the very inheriting of the title and estates
of Lord Fitzgeorge would give him a claim to
rank with them, even at their head.
"You see,'' said Mr. Spenser, " what a great
advantage it has always given to your father to
be ranked among the wise and good, and to
patronise them so much. If you can but get
all the wise and good, as well as the fashionable
world, to be of your side, you may then do any
thing you please."
Fitzgeorge promised to take the matter into
his most serious consideration. He knew, in-
deed, that he needed to be no wiser and better

than he ever had been: he knew that wisdom
meant fashionable politics, and goodness meant
fashionable religion. In fact, he did not care
how wise and good he became, so that he might
get rid of his wife.

CHAPTER VI.
THE TROUBLE OF A DAUGHTER.
If there were nothing else to convince the
Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge that he was
no longer a very young gentleman, he might
have inferred the fact from the circumstance,
that his daughter was now grown"up; and if he
had been in the habit of anticipating inconve-
niences with as much inventive power as he had
anticipated pleasures and luxuries, he would
have looked forward with some apprehension to
a difficulty in the management of the young
lady. He might very naturally have supposed
that, however disagreeable to himself the wife

FJTZGEOBGE. J03
might have been, yet it was possible that the
mother was not disagreeable to the child. For
the professed purpose of educating his daughter,
he had caused her to be removed from her mo-
ther's roof, and he had thrown every obstacle
in the way of their intercourse; but he could
not remove from her mind all thought and re-
-collection of her mother, or destroy the impres-
sions of early affection. Now, as his daughter
was coming of age, and was of course looking
forward to greater liberty, it was clear that one
use which she would make of that liberty would
-be to indulge herself in more unrestrained inter-
course with her mother. From this would
spring many annoyances and inconveniences to
-Fitzgeorge, therefore he was obliged to have
recourse to all his wit and sagacity to prevent
this. He knew what a plague he had been to
his father when he was young, and he knew
also what a plague his father had been to him;
-if seemed indeed to have been a fatality attend-
ing the iamily of Fitzgeorge that they were

destined to be torments to one another. But
however much Augustus had endured from his
father, he still had a little more power of inde-
pendence when he came of age than a daughter
could possibly have. Daughters, by the domi-
neering contrivance of the male sex, are always
in subjection, unless they choose that form of
life which is unanimously ridiculed and in-
sulted.
Fitzgeorge, seeing that his daughter had a
spirit of independence, and knowing that when
she should come of age he would not have so
much power over her as he had during her
minority, craftily endeavoured to have her mar-
ried to some one over whom he could have so
much influence as to urge him to restrain autho-
ritatively all intercourse between the mother and
daughter. For this end, after casting about for
a long time to find a suitable person, he at last
lighted upon one Sir Peter Lemon, a poor,
simple, meagre shred of a baronet, of high fa-
mily indeed, but of family so old as to be worn
## p. 105 (#113) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 105
out and reduced to shadows and debts. Now
Sir Peter would have been very glad indeed of
the fortune which he would have with the young
Louisa, and therefore he entered into the scheme
with great ardour and glee. He readily ac-
cepted the invitation of Augustus Fitzgeorge to
come and pay his addresses to the young lady.
The young Louisa was handsome, cheerful,
and good humoured, altogether unaffected and
of most agreeable address. Sir Peter Lemon,
though descended from a long line of illustrious
ancestry, was not the most polished man that
ever lived, but he was obstinate and self-willed,
and seemed to promise that he would be an
excellently domineering husband. In the pre-
sence of so fine a gentleman as the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge, Sir Peter Lemon looked
altogether a very insignificant personage. In-
deed he felt himself to be a mere nothing com-
pared with the great man in whose company
he was. He had been always accustomed to
look upon greatness with respect, and as a young

.man he also thought highly of the aged, and
reverenced every indication of advanced years;;
among other indications he reverenced fat, and
thought Fitzgeorge great by virtue of his big-
ness. Then again the sight of the splendour
with which Fitzgeorge was surrounded, imposed
very much upon his weak mind. Never had
he in the whole course of his life seen such
superbly furnished rooms, such magnificent car-
riages, such gorgeous liveries, such massive
"plate, such general and universal pomp in all
the arrangements and decorations of a human
being. Perhaps there is a natural instinct in
those who love power and are unable to attain
it by the strength of their own minds, to seek
for it by means of appealing to the weakness of
others' minds. The oriental despots are remark-
able for their magnificence and the multitudious
. and costly decorations of their thrones, palaces
and persons. No doubt it answers; it must
greatly impose upon the minds of the beholders,
and make the common people fancy that beings

-so extraordinarily decorated, must have in them
-something superior to the common run of men.
Hence in European countries, all public func-
tionaries have some peculiar and superb decor-
ations by which they are distinguished from
other and common people. The Lord Mayor of
London, for instance, has a remarkably fine
coach- judges wear most awful wigs and tre-
mendously fine scarlet gowns; all intended no
doubt for the suppression of vice and immo-
rality, and particularly well adapted to prevent
poaching and sheep-stealing, blasphemy and
sedition. Even the very parish beadle has a
cocked hat with a garnish of copper lace, by
means of which finery he keeps little boys
quiet at church. Could a Lord Mayor ad-
minister justice without a mace, or could a
parish beadle keep order in church without a
copper-laced hat 1
The reverence of finery is an essential part of
the constitution of human nature; it certainly
developed itself in Sir Peter Lemon, and that so

strongly, that Augustus Fitzgeorge himself dis-
cerned how deeply the young baronet was im-
pressed. Taking advantage, therefore, of the
awe with which the youth regarded him, he
carried on by the haughtiness of his manner
the imposition which was first effected by the
splendour of his style of living. When there-
fore it appeared sufficiently evident that Sir
Peter was duly aware of the high honour of
being son-in-law to the Hon. Augustus Fitz-
george, the crafty parent gave him to under-
stand that such an honour ought to be con-
sidered worth any price of obedience to, or
compliance with, the humours and will of his
own honourable self.
"You do our family great honour," said Fitz-
george, "by condescending to form an alliance
with it by marriage."
"The honour is done to me," replied Sir
Peter, "by so great a man as the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge condescending to receive
me as a son-in-law."
## p. 109 (#117) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 109
"I beg Sir Peter that you would not men-
tion it. You are a man of discernment, Sir
Peter."
Sir Peter bowed.
"And," continued Fitzgeorge, in a style of
great pomposity, which was somewhat affected,
for the purpose of imposing on the little baronet,
"you must be aware that, when you marry
into a family situated as ours is, there are cer-
tain difficultiesandandyou must know
you understand the peculiar situation in which
Lady Louisa is placed with respect to the rest
of the family. Of course it is not for me to
presume to dictate to you Sir Peter, I cannot
say that I prohibit all interchange of civilities
between you and the Lady Louisa. You must
use your own discretion."
Sir Peter was discreet enough to see that he
was expected to join the party of husband
against wife, as one condition of connecting
himself with the family of Fitzgeorge in mar-
riage, therefore he used his own discretion when
## p. 110 (#118) ############################################
110 FITZGEOBGE.
he replied, "Believe me, sir, that from all that
I hear and know of Lady Louisa, I feel no in-
clination whatever to cultivate her ladyship's
acquaintance."
"You will perhaps think it necessarybut
that is altogether as you pleaseto call and
announce your intention of marrying her daugh-
ter."
"If that ceremony could be dispensed with,
I should not be sorry," replied the little man.
"How far that may be agreeable to your
intended bride, I cannot say. I fear that in
consequence of early associations, and the arti-
fices of Lady Louisa, she has an injudicious and
blind partiality to a parent who is an honour
neither to her nor to me. When she leaves my
roof she will be under the guardianship of a
judicious and enlightened husband, who of
course will take all good care that she forms
not any improper acquaintance, and that she
associates not with those whose conversation
cannot enlighten her, and ought not to interest
her."
## p. 111 (#119) ############################################
. riTZGEOEGE. 'ID
"I should be very sorry," replied Sir Peter
Lemon, "to promote enmity hi any family, and
I think that the safest way to avoid this is,
where there is a difference to choose decidedly
which part of the family we shall adhere to, and
which we shall renounce. On the present oc-
casion there can be no difficulty."
"But," replied Fitzgeorge, "will there be
on the part of your wife, that is to be, the same
good sense, or a submission to the authority of
her husband 1"
"I should imagine,'" replied Sir Peter, " that
there will be no great danger that the young
lady will oppose the will of her husband and
her father too."
The baronet understood that he was expected
by Fitzgeorge, not only to avoid all acquaintance
with the mother of his wife, but to keep the
daughter apart from the mother by the exercise
of a husband's authority, and he was ready
enough to give intimation that he would do so.
But both Fitzgeorge and Sir Peter Lemon, were
## p. 112 (#120) ############################################
112 FITZGEORGE.
quite unaware of the existence of any possible
obstacle in the will and determination of the
young lady, whose hand and heart were thus
summarily disposed of according to the usual
fashion of that family. It had been thought
quite sufficient on the part of Fitzgeorge to
announce to his daughter, that a suitor for her
hand was about to appear in the person of Sir
Peter Lemon.
The young Louisa heard the announcement
with becoming attention and most respectful
demeanour, making no reply of rejection or of
approbation. Fitzgeorge had by this time, it
seems, forgotten his own rebellious opposition
to his father in the matter of matrimony, and
expected to receive from his daughter an un-
qualified and unhesitating submission to his
will. In due form the baronet was introduced,
and with all possible respect he was treated by
the young lady. He talked very little about
love, thinking, perhaps, the least said the
soonest mended; but he talked copiously and
X

FITZGEORGE. 113
eloquently of his fine estates and his magnificent
mansion, praising also the great glories of the
mansion of Augustus Fitzgeorge, eulogizing also
his marvellous wisdom and surprising grace of
manner. Much also did he lament the indis-
position of the venerable Lord Fitzgeorge, and
much did he admire the supereminent conjugal
affection of Lady Fitzgeorge, in that she neg-
lected not her lord in his illness; but not a
word came from the lips of the suitor touching
Lady Louisa.
Now the young Louisa was by no means defi-
cient in sagacity; she immediately perceived that
Sir Peter Lemon was altogether of her father's
faction, and that he had been tutored to think
disrespectfully of her mother. Her indignation
rose at this thought, and she said, " I have also
a mother living."
The little baronet was completely posed at
the emphasis and energy with which the young
lady spoke; he perfectly well knew her mean-
ing, and he could see by the resolute manner
## p. 114 (#122) ############################################
114 F1TZGEOEGE.
of her utterance, that she had spirit enough
to resent any indignity of neglect or insolence
which he might be disposed to offer to Lady
Xouisa. And, notwithstanding that, when not
in the young lady's presence, he could talk very
fluently of the authority which, as a husband,
he would exercise in restraining her from hold-
ing intercourse with her mother, he felt himself
abashed in her presence, and most sheepishly
whispered or muttered some commonplace, that
sounded as if they had a meaning, but which,
in reality, amounted to nothing. People may
speak as disrespectfully as they will of the wisr
dom of our ancestors, but we are certainly under
great obligations to our ancestors, for leaving us
as an inheritance a great mass of words, which
may be used on any particular occasion, when
we have nothing to say for ourselves. Such
words as these are particularly valuable in fa-
shionable life, and are almost invaluable in di-
plomacy and debate. They cannot possibly be
remembered against us, and even if they should

be written down and read in our heating, they
are so ghostlike and substanceless, that they
icannot excite the slightest blush or remorse.
Wfth such words did Sir Peter Lemon reply to
tthe young Louisa, when she thus reproved him
.for his studied neglect of her mother- But the
young lady saw through their hollowness, and
having too great a sense of what became herself
binder the circumstances, she did not angrily or
even contemptuously reply, but was silent in
the firm resolution, that Sir Peter Lemon should

true wisdom in the conduct of life, never to be
angry with those for whom you have no con-

Louisa, as one that was not. She regarded him

love or hatred, her resolution was taken and ft
was immoveable. .''

disapprobation, of the shadow of excuse with
which he had attempted to varnish over his
neglect of Lady Louisa, that the young lady
was satisfied with the apology, or at least
silenced by the thought of the obedience due to
her father. He proceeded, therefore, in his
conversation such as it was, for it certainly is
not worth repeating, till at length it took that
turn which compelled a reply. Some allusion
was made by the baronet to the object of his
visit; and the allusion was made in so confident
a tone as though the only consent required was
that of Fitzgeorge.
"Pardon me, Sir Peter," replied Louisa,
"in that anticipation you are calculating too
hastily."
"Surely I misunderstand you," replied the
baronet.
"I cannot answer for your understanding,"
said the young lady, "but in order to prevent,
as far as in me lies, all further misunderstanding,

is my own, my heart is my own, and that they
never can be yours."
"But," said the disappointed suitor, "your
honoured father has given me his sanction, his
approbationhis word."
"My honoured father," replied the young
lady, "may give you, if he will, his sanc-
tion, his approbation, his word, they are his to
givebut my heart he cannot give, and my
hand he shall not give."
"And in what words am I to carry this mes-
sage to the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge?"
"In mine, if you please; or in yours, if you
like them better."
"But I have written home to my friends to
announce the pleasing intelligence, that I was
about to introduce to them as my bride, the
accomplished daughter of the Honourable Au-
gustus Fitzgeorge."

titude as you can bear yours'.":
So saying, the young lady laughing,. left
him; and he, in much bitterness of mortifica-
tion, made a brief soliloquy, saying, " What a,
fool I shall look when I go home again."
What is life? The philosopher and the mo-
ralist may well ask the "question, but who can
answer them? The whole human race is look-
ing forward to composure and satisfaction, but
such a state of mind or such condition of being,
no mortal ever attains. Nothing seems to be
right but that which has been a great while
ago, and that which is to be a great many years
hence. We have seen now in this brief narra-
tive, a delineation of a great portion of the life
of the Honourable Augustus Fitzgeorge, in
which it seems., that he has been all along
looking forward to some delightful and desir-
able state of being, which as yet he has hot
reached; but instead of satisfaction, he has had

what does she enjoy. She is living under the

who would sacrifice her happiness to gratify his
own resentment against a wife, whose only of-

marry him. What is life? Is it all perplexity

Sir Peter Lemon carried back to Fitzgeorge
the intelligence that the young lady would not
listen to the lover's suit. Fitzgeorge was angry,
he felt the indignity which had been offered ta
his parental authority, and forgetful of the in

dignities which he had in his time offered to the
authority of his parents, he loudly reproved his
daughter, who listened in a subdued silence,
and then firmly, but meekly, replied, "I have
also a mother, whom by the laws of God I am
bound to honour, and by the affections of my
nature I am compelled to love. She, sir, has
watched over my infancy, and she has twined
herself around my heart; and I cannot, and
will not forget her, or ever give my hand to
one who does not honour her."
Fitzgeorge scowled angrily, and his feeble
frame, which already felt the effect of prema-
ture old age, trembled with an excess of agita-
tion; "Your mother is "here he paused,
apparently in mercy that would not speak, but
really in a malignity that would insinuate more
than it dared to say.
The young lady felt the blood mount indig-
nantly into her honest face, and prompted by an
inartificial pathos and uncontrollable feeling,
she replied, " My mother isis, sir, what you

have made hera wretched woman! a neglected,
forsaken, heart-broken woman. Parental autho-
rity drove her into your arms, and she was made
wretched. You would exercise over me the
same authority, and would consign me to one
from whose home perhaps I might soon be ba-
nished, and by whose friends I might be soon
calumniated."
"Is this language fit and becoming to be
addressed to a father," said Fitzgeorge, in a
tone of authority. But the daughter was not
terrified into cowardice, and she replied, " It
is language, sir, that speaks what I feel and
what I know. You may not forgive me for
uttering it, but I could not forgive myself for
withholding it."
"You may have an affection for your mother,"
replied Fitzgeorge, "but have you no reverence
for the authority of a father? Do you know
how much you are in my power?"
"There is no power," answered the daughter,
"that can subdue the affection which I enter-

tain for my mother, and there is no power that
can compel me to give my hand where I cannot
give my heart. I know that I am my mother's
only defence. If I forsake her I know that the
tongues of malignity will move against her, and
the sword of persecution will be lifted up. I
will not leave her, I will not consent to any
arrangement that shall withdraw me from her."
"But know you not," replied Fitzgeorge,
"that I have the power to prohibit you from all
intercourse with your mother V
"Exercise that power as far as you may, or
as far you dare, 'tis nothing so long as my own
will remains unaltered. The law may give you
a power, but there is a power above the law,
there is a power above the caprice of the
proudest noble in the land, and that power is
public opinion, against which you caimot and
dare not'proceed. You may immure me in a
dungeon, but the public voice will ask for me,
and you must release me. You may for awhile
keep me under restraint and seclusion, but you

can do comparatively little without my own
acquiescence in these arrangements. 1 might
at this moment walk out of the house and seek
my mother's roof, and throw myself exclusively
under her protection, and you would not dare to
bring me back by violence."
Fitzgeorge smiled, though bitterly, and re-
plied, "You are talking with all the impetuo-
sity of inexperienced youth. You know not
the world, and you know not yourself. A time
may come when you will think more soberly, and
judge more discreetly. For the present I will
not urge the suit of Sir Peter Lemon, whose
character you do not seem to understand or to
appreciate, but I hope and trust that you will
soon think better of it, and then you will ask
his and my pardon for the follies of this day."
"Never, sir," replied the young lady, "never.
I may speak with impetuosity, but I do not
speak unadvisedly." .
"Ah!" exclaimed Fitzgeorge, "have you
then been in previous consultation with your

mother? Have you been persuaded by her
and corrupted by her arts? Has she been
your adviser to refuse the honourable offer now
made you, in order that your hand and fortune
may be reserved for some lover who will be
more subservient to her schemes and strata-
gems? I think I see the secret now of your
refusal of Sir Peter Lemon. He would not be
sufficiently subservient to the artifices and de-
vices of Lady Louisa."
"With whom, sir," replied the daughter,
"could I better consult than with my mother?
Who so likely to give me disinterested and
sound advice. She knows by bitter experience
the folly and misery of giving a hand where
there is not a heart to give. But it is not from
her advice alone that I act. I like not Sir Peter
Lemon, and will not accept of him."
Fitzgeorge retired from the conference with
his daughter, defeated and mortified. If any
one wishes to be defeated and mortified, he has
nothing to do but to take up the wrong side,

and to take it up in an improper spirit, and he
will be sure of defeat and mortification.
"In what a wretched and ridiculous posi-
tion," said Fitzgeorge to himself, "am I now
placed. No sooner am I released from the an-
noyance of paternal authority, than I am per-
plexed and troubled by filial disobedience-
Instead of finding every thing subservient to
my wishes, and every body compliant with my
humours, I meet with disappointment every
step that I take, and with opposition in every
individual that crosses my path. I am now
fairly defeated by my own daughter. And what
can I do? Can I exercise my paternal autho-
rity? I can, but dare I? There is that tre-
mendous power, public opinion, against me.
Yet what should I care for the public? What
is the public to me? Alas! it is too much.
I want from the public applause and admira
tion. When I shall become Lord Fitzgeorge,

all that the world has yet seen, I shall want the

Its rarity gives it a value, but it is public

a little more minutely, that I might read more

there any pleasures yet in store for me?"
His eye rested on a flattering portrait which
had been drawn of him by an ingenious artist
who knew better than any other delineator of
the human form divine, how to blend the spirit
of flattery with the letter of truth, how to make
a handsome picture most strikingly like an un-
handsome original, who could, what tailors can-
not do, make an old man look young.
"My friends tell me that that portrait is like
me. It may be. I wish that I could feel that
I was like that portrait. There is in that no
trembling hand, no dimness of the eye, no puffed
out cheek, no look of any feebleness of body or
decay of constitution. And how much better
the wig in the picture looks than the wig which
I myself now wear. The rascal of a hair-dres-
ser promised me miracles, but he has performed
none. How is it that old age creeps upon me

else ?Then there is that perpetual nuisance,
my wife. I see no chance of ever getting rid
of her. People know that my daughter takes
part with my wife, and they almost mention the
name of wife in my hearing. I never go into
public, but I fancy that people are talking about
my wife. She must be guilty, I am sure that
she is guilty. Myriads of witnesses may be
procured to prove it, but while my daughter is
in the way I cannot proceed, and I see no pro-
spect of getting rid of her. The time is now
advancing; disguise it as I will I feel that I
am growing old. I am old before my time.
My father is yet living and I am an old man.
People begin to talk of my age and of my cor-
pulence. Oh 'tis disgusting and wretched!
but fat as I am, my gracefulness of demeanour
is not yet gone. I am still a model of elegance
to men younger than myself. I have still some
sense of enjoyment left, and if I could but get
rid of my wifeI might even now be happy."

CHAPTER VII.
SPITE AND SPLENDOUR.
Old Lord Fitzgeorge continued too ill to
have any thing to do with the personal manage-
ment of his estates, and the lawsuit of which
mention has been already made, continued to
be carried on under the auspices of Augustus.
Not, indeed, that he took any active part in it
himself, or gave himself any trouble or concern
about it, but he gave his lawyers orders to do
the best they could, and he left the manage-
ment of all things to the steward. He had
now got a new steward, a very conceited, dan-
dified young chap, from Ireland, named Castles.
This Castles loved mightily to be busy, espe-
cially under such a master as Augustus Fitz-
g3

130 FITZGEOEGE.
george, who not liking any trouble, left every
thing to the care of his steward, who was
absolutely vain enough to think that he was
master of the estate, because the real master
left every thing to his management.
At length, however, after an immense ex-
pense, the lawsuit was brought to a close, and
the family of Fitzgeorge got the day; but it
was found, when the lawyers brought in their
bills, that there was so much to pay, that the
victory was hardly worth having. Still it would
never do to complain, and Fitzgeorge was too
lazy to examine the bills, and his steward was
too much interested not to pay them in full,
because, the more he touched the more stuck
to his fingers. The man, against whom the
lawsuit principally was directed, was an ex-
ceedingly clever fellow, of so much natural
shrewdness and penetration, that every body
thought that he would certainly get the day.
Even Fitzgeorge himself had but little hopes
of victory, but as the thing was begun, he
## p. 131 (#139) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 131
thought it best to go on with it, for his steward
told him that there was nothing to be got by
giving it up.
The news, therefore, of Fitzgeorge's success,
was received with a most obstreperous joy, not
only by Fitzgeorge himself, but by almost all
the tenants, who had not, indeed, much cause
for joy, for they were none the better for it, and
had a great deal of the expense to pay out of
their own pockets. But the worst of the matter
was, that the poor fellow who lost his cause
was totally ruined, and had not a shilling in the
world left to pay the lawyers, or even to keep
himself from the parish. He was not, however,
allowed to go to the parish, for Fitzgeorge, at
the advice of his Irish steward, Castles, arrested
him and sent him to jail, where he lay all the
rest of his life in solitude and want.
There were some other noblemen and gentle-
men who had been engaged in the lawsuit with
Lord Fitzgeorge, and these, when the suit was
over, came to pay a visit to Augustus. Now

132 FITZGEORGE.
Augustus was, on this occasion, at once gratified
and mortified. He was gratified, that he had
an opportunity of showing off in grand style
before the strangers, but he was greatly morti-
fied on account of his wife, of whom he could
give no account that would not tell against him-
self. Next to the indulgence of his animal
appetites, Fitzgeorge enjoyed nothing more than
pomp and splendour; and he hoped to surprise
his new friends and visitors with a display of
elegance and luxury such as they had never
before seen, and such as might be a topic for
them to discourse and think about as long as
they should live. He therefore assembled about
him artists and artisans of every description,
and because there did not appear to be in his
mansion, any one room sufficiently splendid for
the purpose of a hall of feasting, he caused
one to be immediately added, and that of the
most magnificent dimensions and most sumptu-
us decorations. All his copious and almost
boundless stores of gold and silver plate were
## p. 133 (#141) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 133
brought forth to light, and he was for a while,
in the contemplation of these treasures, quite as
happy as a child with a new toy:and what
mortal would wish to be happier? He consulted
with those of his friends who were best skilled
in the arts of cookery and of arranging the de-
corations of the tables, and he was fully resolved
to outdo all the fine doings recorded in Mother
Bunch's Fairy Tales.
Poor Lord Fitzgeorge himself was totally un-
able to see or to be seen by any of these great
visitors, but Lady Fitzgeorge had no objection
to leave her husband for a little while, to exhibit
herself and her finery to them. But all this
while the wife of Augustus Fitzgeorge was ne-
glected and forgotten; and when she sent word
that as some of the visitors were old acquaint-
ance of hers, and that she should be glad to
be permitted to see them, a rude and insulting
message was sent to say, that she might stay at
home and mind her own business. So there was
feasting going forward in the halls of Fitzgeorge,
## p. 134 (#142) ############################################
134 IITZGEORGE.
and there was congratulation on all hands, but
Lady Louisa was not allowed to partake of any
of the festivities.
Fitzgeorge himself, however, was not quite
so happy in the exhibition of his magnificence
as he expected to be. There were many draw-
backs abating the fulness of his satisfaction.
He could see around him gorgeous decorations,
persons of exalted rank, men of thought, and
men of fancy; he had the satisfaction of receiv-
ing from them all the homage of admiration.
When he spoke, they were silent and respect-
fully attentive;he failed in no effect that he
made to shine in conversation, for men who
give good dinners are exceedingly witty, and
the nearest way to the heart is down the throat.
. But while he sat in hospitable state and gazed
around him with no small share of delight,, he
had among his thoughts of pride some feelings
of humiliation, and among his pleasant emo-
tions some pangs of bitterness and mortification*
He was proud of himseMj but he was mortified
## p. 135 (#143) ############################################
PITZGEORGE. 135
that he had not a wife of whom he could also
be proud, and who would be as much an ex-
hibiter and model of the perfection of female
splendour of dress and decoration, as he himself
was of the perfection of male attire and man-
ners. There was some pleasure in the thought
of his own superb and splendid appearance, but
there would have been more in the additional
splendour of a well-dressed wife. All, there-
fore, that Fitzgeorge could say for himself was,
that he was as gay as he could be, and that the
appearance of his establishment was as brilliant
as could be expected, considering that there
was no wife to grace it with her graceful pre-
sence.
Having so much company in his house, he
was in a state of constant publicity, to which,
of late, he had been partially a stranger. And
though he was very much admired for the
general elegance of his manners, he sometimes
fancied that he detected a lurking sentiment of
disappointment in many to whom he was ex-
## p. 136 (#144) ############################################
136 FITZGEORGE.
posed, and he thought that he heard some whis-
pers concerning his wife. It is a very annoying
circumstance in a civilized society, that a man is
always under the inspection of the public eye,
and amenable to the public tribunal. Accord-
ing to the letter of the law, he may, indeed, do
what he will with his own; but there is, in
public opinion, a much greater power than that of
the written law, which power will punish with its
severe and deep-felt rebukes, the transgressions
which no written law can reach. The influence
of opinion on the human mind and feelings, is
one of the most marvellous and mysterious
operations of mind. There is a power in opi-
nion which, though silent, is irresistible; and
there scarcely ever existed a human being who
could brave, or even attempt to brave it. Fitz-
george, in many actions of his life, seemed to
be exceedingly heedless of it; but, in truth, he
stood more in awe of it than he himself was
aware. He was consulting public opinion even
when he was closeted with his tailors, and was
N

meditating the cut and colour of a coat. He
had lived much in the public eye, and had
rejoiced greatly in public admiration. He had
cared comparatively little for the opinion of the
wise and good, but lie had been happy in the
countenance of the gay and the dissipated, who
could laugh arrogantly and sneer superciliously.
The power of a laugh is great, and will often
hold up a man's conscious firmness for a while,
even against public opinion. Fitzgeorge knew,
that in many instances, the opinion of the public
had been against him, but he could laugh at
the antiquated notions of the many-headed
monster; and with his gay companions could
pleasantly chirp over his cups. Therefore, he
was so far happy and brave.
The gaiety of his spirit was now much
abated, and he felt that in spite of himself he
was growing old, and that nothing could con-
ceal it, and that there was very little to palliate
it. Coming forth also on the present occasion
a little more into public, and showing himself

138 IITZGEORGE.
a little more to his tenants, he found that he
was not in such high repute with them as he
had been in times past. They looked upon
him without awe, and many of them with dis-
respect and even reproach. They regarded him
as one who had lived only to and for himself,
and as one who cared nothing for the rest of the
world, except as he might find it an instrument
wherewith to gratify his vanity. Some of his
guests observed that he was not popular among
the tenants, and they observed in particular that
frequent mention was made of his wife. This
rery much astonished them, for they were in
the habit of experiencing from their tenants the
most marked and profound respect.
One of the party was Lord Alexander, a
nobleman who had great estates in the north,
and who was altogether one of the craftiest and
subtlest of the human race. There was nothing
of trickery that he was not equal to j he could
play the hypocrite to such perfection- that they
who were even prepared for his hypocrisy would

FITZGEOBGE. 139
be almost deceived by it Never was there
seen a smoother face, and never was there heard
a smoother tongue. He pretended to be mightily
religions, and he carried an appearance of great
meekness; his face was as soft as a cat's paw,
and his spirit as malignant as her talons.
"I have heard/' said Lord Alexander to
Fitzgeorge, "some remarks made about your
wife. What is the meaning of all this? If my
tenants behaved to me as your father's tenants
behave to you, I would crush them."
"The fact is," replied Fitzgeorge, "that I
do not like my wife. I was compelled to marry
to get rid of my debts, and I very soon was dis-
gusted with the person whom my father had
selected for my wife, and I separated myself
from her as soon as I could."
"But why did you let the world know of
your disgust? Why do you let the world talk
about your wife? You might behave with
apparent civility to her in public"
"I cannot," replied Fitzgeorge; "I absolutely

140 FITZGEORGE.
N.
hate her; she is quite odious and disgusting to
me.
"All that may be," replied Lord Alexander,
u and you may indulge in your hatred as much
as you please; you may persecute, annoy, and
insult her, but you should not let the world see
or know any thing of it. By proclaiming your
hatred, you put her more effectually out of your
power. You would of course be very glad to
get a divorce. You have tried once, I believe 1"
"I have," said Fitzgeorge, "and a most
miserable failure it was. I will, however, take
the earliest opportunity of making another
attempt."
"But why don't you behave civilly to her?
Why don't you keep up appearances in public?
You might then put her off her guard, and
draw her into some dilemma, and perhaps be
able to convince a jury. So long as you keep
up a spirit and show of hostility, you defeat
your own purpose of vengeance. You make
the public sympathize with your wife, and ren-

der them ready to believe that any accusation
that may be brought against her is brought at
your desire or by your connivance. You show
too much temper in your hatred, you are too
loud in your devices. You should learn to hate
smilingly.
"I am not usually deficient in courtesy,"
replied Fitzgeorge.
"That is not what I mean. By smiling
hatred, I mean that you not merely attend to
the common courtesies of life, but demean your-
self so that it may seem that the society of the
person whom you most dislike is the most agree-
able imaginable; you will thus have better
opportunity of crushing those whom you hate."
"But it is painful to me," replied Fitzgeorge,
"to exercise any of that duplicity; what I hate
I hate, whom I detest I detest, and wish them
out of my sight. I never willingly expose my-
self to any annoyances or inconveniences."
"By thus indulging your feelings, however,"
replied Lord Alexander, "you injure your in-

terest, and yon lose many an advantage which
you would otherwise gain. If you do not sacri-
fice the present to the future, you will sacrifice
the future to the present. If you do not make
your caprices bend to your interest, you will
find that your interest is the prey of your ca*
price. These sound like mere truisms and
identical propositions, but there is a great deal
of importance in them, and more great than you
imagine at first sight."
"I believe you are perfectly right," replied
Fitzgeorge; "it has been my system through
life to gain all that I could, and to sacrifice
nothing present to any thing future. I have
always thought it the best policy to take care
of the present, for we are sure of that; whereas,
if I sacrificed present pleasure in hopes of a
future advantage, I might be sure of losing the
present pleasure, but not sure of gaining the
future advantage."
"A very common system I believe," replied
Lord Alexander, "but not the better for being
## p. 143 (#151) ############################################
FITZGEOEGE. 143
common. You never can have a command over
others, if you have not command over your-
self."
Fitzgeorge was perfectly aware of the truth
of all that Lord Alexander said, but a convic-
tion of the truth of any system is by no means
the invariable prelude to following that system
in conduct. Our hero had been too long habi-
tuated to a certain system, or more properly
speaking, want of system, to be able to make at
this period of life any change from conviction.
The sight of his wife was odious to him, her
very name was discord to his ear. He regarded
all allusion to her with a childlike impatience
and disgust. But if any thing was suggested,
indicating the possibility of getting rid of the
matrimonial bond, to that he would listen with
as much eagerness as a child would listen to a
fairy tale.

EMIGRATION.
Lady Louisa now saw that a system of in-
sult, persecution and calumny was pursued
against her with the most persevering and mer-
ciless severity. Every idle tale that a wicked
imagination could invent was sure to be heard
with greedy ears, and her enemies, instead of
following the rule of believing only half what
the world says, reversed that rule and believed
twice as much. As now Fitzgeorge was mani-
festly not far from the enjoyment of the title
and estates, the number of his friends consider-
ably increased, and by the same rule the num-

ber of his wife's enemies increased; in fact, the
people who called themselves his friends were,
in good truth, only so by virtue of their being
enemies to and calumniators of his wife. A
man of any ordinary humanity, and decent good
feeling, would have been ashamed of receiving
such homage as this; but Fitzgeorge was
ashamed of nothing, so long as it gratified his
caprice and indulged his humour.
Without knowing why, and purely from the
fact of the great number, who called themselves
friends to Fitzgeorge, giving credence and cir-
culation to calumnious stories concerning Lady
Louisa, a very great number of persons who
knew nothing, and could know nothing, of the
circumstances, took it into their heads that all
these stories, told and believed by so many
respectable persons must be true. But they
were not aware of the great abjectness and
sycophancy of what are called respectable per-
sons when they come within the influence of
nobility. The insulted wife, therefore, could

scarcely make her appearance at all in public,
without exciting that attention and notice which
was any thing but respectful. Moreover, her
daughter was now taken away from her, so that
they seldom met, and the opportunities of their
meeting were fewer and more restrained than
ever. This, together with a variety of other
annoying circumstances, induced Lady Louisa
to resolve on leaving England, and taking up
her abode in a foreign country, where she might
be away from the persecutions of her husband,
and the insults of his friends.
Fitzgeorge was mightily glad to hear of this
resolution, and wished with all his heart and
soul to encourage it. But there were some
persons who, professing themselves friends to
Lady Louisa, were no further friends to her than
as they were enemies to him in politics. They
Were glad to annoy him by means of his wife,
and they cared nothing at all for her or for her
fate. Politics are sad hardeners of the heart;
and as he who is hunting with hounds after

hare or fox, cares not over whose fields he may
ride, or through whose fences he may break; so
he, who is in pursuit of any political object, cares
not whose heart he may break, whose spirits he
may depress, whose reputation he may injure or
destroy. These persons, then, who were friends
to Lady Louisa, by virtue only of their political
enmity to Fitzgeorge, made many objections to
her ladyship's going abroad, and they repre-
sented to her that such a step would give her
enemies opportunity of reproaching her more
loudly, and of accusing her of going into a
foreign country in order that she might lead a
life of licentious freedom. *
The real fact was, that they were sorry to part
with her, because they thereby lost a great
means of annoying and perplexing Augustus
Fitzgeorge. He indeed was not a little pleased
to hear of their objections, for they furthered
the object which he had in view; so he took
care to have the report abundantly circulated,
that the only object which Lady Louisa had in
h2

148 PITZGEORGE.
going abroad was, that she might have an oppor-
tunity of living a profligate life unobserved and
unreproved. They also said, and a very foolish
and insulting saying it was, that she cared no-
thing for her daughter, but heedlessly left her
unprotected and undefended. Alas! poor
woman! She had no power to protect or to
defend her daughter; rather was her presence
made by her enemies the means of annoying
and distressing her daughter. Scarcely a day
passed in which she had not occasion to weep
at the thought of some cruel and insolent inter-
ruption of their intercourse.
When one of his sycophants brought him the
welcome intelligence that Lady Louisa had re-
solved to leave England, and to take up her
abode in a foreign country, he quite exulted at
the information, and said, " I wish she would
take up her abode in some other planet.
Farthest from me is best. Now our next care
must be to prevent her return."
"There will be a difficulty perhaps in that,"

FITZGEORGE. 149
said the informant; "for in case of your coming
to the title and estates, she may be disposed to
come back and to claim her share of the honours
and profits."
"Her share, or at least some share of the
profits she shall be welcome to, but I will never
allow her any share of the honours. Never,
with my good will, shall she be called by the
title of Lady Fitzgeorge."
"At all events," replied the sycophant, "one
object is gained by this plan of hers; for it has
already set some of her friends on talking of the
imprudence and impolicy of the step. If they
will talk of the imprudence of it, what character
may not we give of it?"
"It is all very well," replied Fitzgeorge,
u this is exactly as I would have it. I care not
how many such friends she may find. Half a
dozen indiscreet friends will do her more mis-
chief than a hundred crafty enemies. I be-
lieve that they who are not injured by them-
selves or their friends suffer very little from their

\
enemies. Now tell me faithfully, what is the
general opinion among indifferent persons. Is
there any serious belief of her guilt 1"
"I can speak only from what I have seen
and heard," said Fitzgeorge's friend, "and I
must say, that I am really astonished at the
numbers who are sincerely persuaded that she
is guilty."
"Now I hope you are not deceiving me,"
said Fitzgeorge; "for really I can hardly think
it possible that many, or, at least, any serious
number, should be taken in. I am afraid that
any one who thinks for a moment, must see
how great an interest I have in getting rid of
her, and must see also, that multitudes are
ready to assist in bringing an accusation against
her."
"My good sir," replied the friend, "there
are very few people in the world who do think
for a minute. Thinking, you know, is not an
action, it is a habit. The majority of mankind
cannot think, if they would, they do not know
v
## p. 151 (#159) ############################################
IITZGEORGE. 151
how to set about it. The great multitude has
its opinions ready made. You, who have had
to do with politics, must of course know this.
You know the hollowness of political theories,
and the insincerity of political partisans. You
know that the great mass of human beings are
like inert matter, moved by a small quantity
of mind. An extensive and universal habit of
thinking, would be the destruction of many of
our time-honoured institutions, which have stood
the test of ages; for many things may stand the
test of ages, which will not stand the test of
thought."
"You are right, I believe," said Fitzgeorge,
"and I apprehend that nature never designed,
that the majority of the human race should
think. What an unmanageable thing would be
a nation of thinkers! It would be next to im-
possible to govern it.""
"But though," said the sycophant, "there
be few that think, there are many that feel, and
that can be influenced to take up, and o con-
tend violently for an opinion. Fashion has an

influence where reason could have none; and
fashion would, in many cases, overthrow the
decisions of reason. Fortunately for you, it
happens that fashion is in your favour, and that
very naturally, for as the earliest accusation of
Lady Louisa was made among people of fashion,
a belief of that accusation has naturally, slowly
but surely descended, so that every silly scrub
that thinks himself just one step above the
vulgar, considers it a mark of fashion and
gentility to speak accusingly of her ladyship.
Keep up your spirits, then, you may even yet
gain your object. So long as the influence of
fashion is greater than the power of thought, so
long you may have hopes.11
"Very true," replied Fitzgeorge; "you are
to consider though, that in order to gain a di-
vorce, I must procure evidence of transgression.
Now, how can I procure evidence from so
great a distance as France, Italy, Germany, or
wherever her ladyship may choose to have a
fancy to ramble?"
"Easily."
\
## p. 153 (#161) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 153
"Easily? Be kind enough to explain, for to
me it does not appear so easy a matter. When
she was living here we knew who were her
neighbours, and we knew where to apply for
the purpose of information; but abroad, she
will be moving from place to place, and there
is no one in those countries who will have any
interest in making up a story for me."
"Send people over to watch, to buy evidence,
it may be had very cheap on some parts of the
continent. On my word, I think you have now
the best chance that you have ever yet had of
making out a case against her."
"I wish I could think so," replied Fitz-
george; "but I must confess, that I am by no
means clear, that the task is so easy as you
seem to imagine. If I send people over on
purpose to watch, it may be, and no doubt will
be supposed, that I send them out to fabricate
stories, or to purchase evidence. Besides, will
it not appear gratuitous and gross, if when she
should be on the continent, and away from the

individual with whom she was supposed to be
too familiar here, we should bring an accusa-
tion against her for other amours? Shall we
not be carrying the accusation too far, so as ta
defeat our own object?"
"Here, again, you are talking, as though the
multitude thought. They do not think. More-
over, they love wonders; and if you should
accuse her ladyship of the most extravagant or
outrageous offences, you would be sure to find
some that would believe the accusation. As
for any charge against you of sending people
out on purpose to fabricate stories, that is an
objection easily surmounted. There are many
travellers from England on the continent of
Europe: these travellers are either people of
fashion, or people that think themselves such,
which is better still; they will naturally fall
into the same line as that in which her lady-
ship may be travelling, and they will frequently
be in the same town where she is residing-
They will, of course, talk about her to the na-

tives, and will most probably speak but lightly
of her. Foreigners are exceedingly polite and
complaisant, and they will never think of con-
tradicting milord Anglais. The traveller will
ask what society her ladyship frequents, and as
there is society in Italy, not of the very highest
repute, into which it is possible that a stranger
may by some accident fall, you will then have
a very pretty nucleus of accusation to begin
with ;the traveller has nothing to do when
he returns or writes to England, but to say
that he happened to be in the same town where
Lady Louisa was, or had been residing; and
that when mention was made of her name, it
appeared that the society to which she was
principally attached, and in which she seemed
most interested, was of a particular nature, that
shall be nameless."
"Ay," said Fitzgeorge, " very good indeed.
Methinks I marvellously admire her plan of
emigration. Tis by far the best step she could
possibly take.But, on second thoughts, bow

^
shall we ensure her falling into society of the
description that you name? There is, certainly,
much of it in Italy, and she may have some
difficulty to avoid it; but may she not be on
her guard?"
"This," replied the sycophant, "is already
provided for: she goes out under the brand of
unfashionable. All self-called fashionables, will
avoid her company; all fashionable English
travellers will avoid recognising her and make
it a matter of religion, as they value their places
in society here, to avoid her company abroad.
The inhabitants will do the same. She will,
therefore, be driven into society of a certain de-
scription; for society, you know, she must and
will have."
"So far, so good," replied Fitzgeorge; "but
here is not yet enough to make materials for a
divorce."
"Perhaps not; but it is an admirable begin-
ning, and a very promising foundation. You
will soon have, in England, a general talk, that

157
Lady Louisa's conduct on the continent is such,
that she is not admitted into any good society.
Then follows, very naturally and easily, some
particular accusation. You see now the great
value of general surmise. Even the Simkin
plot, clumsily as it was concocted, has been not
without its uses. So far from having brought
any reproach on you, as you once feared that
it might do, it has been the means of fixing the
first stigma on her, which never will be removed.
Your present task is all the easier, in conse-
quence of the accusation of the Simkins. They
could not substantiate the charge, but they have
done you good service; for the opinion now is,
that there was some truth in the charge, but
merely a defect in the evidence; the world, or
at least the fashionable world, which is all the
world that you know any thing of, takes it for
granted, that there was plenty of moral, but no
legal evidence."
"This is all very fortunate and agreeable;
but I must acknowledge," said Fitzgeorge,
## p. 158 (#166) ############################################
158 FITZGEOKGB.
"that it appears to me marvellously strange,
that considering how very convenient and agree-
able to me such an accusation was, no one
should suppose that I was, in some degree,
party to the accusation."
"I tell you agaiD, my dear sir, the world
does not think. As for the fashionable world,
it not only cannot think, but it dares not think.
And should there be a few individuals here and
there who see the whole true state of the case,
they can do you no harm, they cannot convince
the many; for thinking is as necessary for the
reception as it is for the discovery of truth."
"You reason well, my friend," replied Fitz-
george; "yet there is another matter to be
considered: that is, the person on whom sus-
picion and charge must falL"
"In that," replied the friend, " there will be
no difficulty."
"We must not make an accusation of general
profligacy, but must fix on some individual, and
do our utmost to gain the means of proving
A

PITZGEORGE. 159
some one individual charge. Now suppose, for
it is a supposable case, that she should form no
acquaintance with any gentleman whatever."
"Well, suppose that, still there is no diffi-
culty, for she must have men-servants."
"But will it ever answer, to accuse her of
an amour with a menial servant?"
"Not, perhaps, altogether with a menial ser-
vant; but, travelling about on the continent, and
having no male relative, she must of coarse
be under the necessity of treating some upper
male-servant with more familiarity, than when
residing in a settled habitation, and receiving
company of various descriptions. I see, indeed,
no difficulty; your path is as plain as day.
You are now, without doubt, in the way of the
accomplishment of your wishes. Throw no ob-
stacle in the way of her departure; let her go
as soon as she will, let her go where she will,
and when travellers who happen to hear any
thing of her in their journey, return to England,
they will be ready enough to give you all the

information in their power, or at least they
will let the world know. Then, when every
body begins to talk about the manners and the
notoriously ill-conduct of Lady Louisa, you
will, of course, be perfectly justified in sending
some persons asasspiesif you like to
call them sowho will procure evidence, and
gain all the information that may be needful to
procure a divorce."
"Your scheme is very good and very plausi-
ble; but if I send any one out for the purpose
of investigation, I ought to send out respect-
able men."
"It would certainly be better to send out
respectable men if you can find them; but if
not, why you may easily procure a briefless
barrister or two, or some half-pay captain, who
are gentlemen by virtue of their profession, if
by nothing else."
"Yet, to consider the matter in all its bear-
ings, would it be altogether correct to send out
spies to watch her conduct, if we have already

FITZGEORGE. 161
information, that it is such as would vindicate
suing for a divorce? Would it not be thought
sufficient to procure the attendance of the wit-
nesses, without sending out any spies to make
discoveries? The sending out spies, looks as
if we were desirous of making what we are
unable to find."
"Oh no, not at all. The world will un-
derstand that you have heard some rumours,
and that you are exceedingly sorry, and that
you can scarcely credit the reports; but as they
are so very numerous, and so remarkably una-
nimous, you are under a necessity of investi-
gating the matter, by means of some respectable
and intelligent gentlemen, who will make in-
quiries on the spot."
"Well, that seems plausible enough," re-
plied Fitzgeorge, "and I only hope that the
scheme may answer, but I cannot help having
my fears."
When he was alone, he said to himself, "It
is pleasant enough to have a hope of getting

rid of an encumbrance, but it is a miserable
consideration to think that I have lived all these
years in the world, and that now my greatest
happiness would be to get rid of my wife. I
have heard some persons affecting philosophical
discrimination say, that there are no positive
pleasures, but that our only happiness is getting
rid of onr annoyances. Truly this is a most hum-
bling picture of human life, and yet, perhaps, it
may be true. I have, in my own thoughts of the
past, a recollection, that I never enjoyed any
period or incident of life, so much as the first
days of my deliverance from the thraldom of
minority, and my first assumption of the
liberty of adult age; and I can scarcely now
imagine any thing that would please me more,
than to be exonerated from this burden of ma-
trimony.How can men be so absurd, as to
make laws which bind themselves for life!"

CHAPTER IX.
a daughter's marriage.
Very few persons in the rank of life in which
the daughter of Fitzgeorge was placed, have
the boldness or the fortune to have a husband
of their own choice and approbation. We have
seen that the young Louisa had acted with a
mighty spirit of independence in refusing the
hand of Sir Peter Lemon. This is generally
considered the utmost that such children of
fashion and rank can do in the way of liberty,
to refuse a dictated match; but the daughter
of Fitzgeorge went further; she not only refused
## p. 164 (#172) ############################################
164 FITZGEORGE.
to accept Sir Peter Lemon, but she positively
declared herself to have formed an attachment
to another, and she was as firm in persisting to
accept of him she loved, as to refuse him she
loved not. There had come in the train of those
noblemen and gentlemen who visited her father
on the completion of the great lawsuit, a young
gentleman of prepossessing manners, and of
most agreeable address, who had been em-
ployed in some slight way in the course of this
long and tedious litigation. He, however, now
that the contest was over, had no particular
employment, and his visit was not matter of
business, but he came with Lord Alexander and
the others as a kind of companion of their
journey, rather than as partaker of their visit.
So being a man of leisure, he had opportunity
of talking to, and ingratiating himself with the
young lady, while the rest of the party were
discussing matters of business with her father;
for though the lawsuit was over, there was a
great deal of business to be settled among the
"N
## p. 165 (#173) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 165
parties who had gained the cause. With all
this arrangement and settlement, however, the
young gentleman here alluded to had nothing
to do; nor indeed had the young lady.
As therefore these two were at leisure, and
had only to talk to and amuse one another,
there sprung up something of an attachment
between them. The young gentleman, though
of good family, was not in possession, or in ex-
pectation, of any great fortune; he therefore
might have been very probably attracted by the
reputation of the young Louisa's great expect-
ations. But whatever might have been the
attraction either to him or to her, it is a certain
fact that an attachment sprung up between
them, and he had made her an offer of his hand,
and she had expressed her willingness to ac-
cept the offer, even before her father knew any
thing of the matter.
One day, therefore, when Fitzgeorge was ex-
postulating with his daughter on her obstinacy
in refusing the hand of Sir Peter Lemon, she
replied, "I refused him, sir, for the best of all
## p. 166 (#174) ############################################
166 FITZGEORGE.
possible reasons, that I did not like him; and
not only do I dislike him, but I have an at-
tachment to another, I have received an offer
from another, I have promised my hand to
another."
Fitzgeorge started with astonishment, and
was taken altogether by surprise at this bold
and abrupt declaration. "You have promised
your hand to another!" said he, as soon as he
could recover calmness enough to speak. "Do
you really mean what you say, or are you en-
deavouring to make trial of my patience and
forbearance?
"I really mean what I say," replied the young
Louisa; " I have accepted his offer, and with
or without your sanction my hand shall be
his."
"Well," replied Fitzgeorge, "I believe that
this is the first time that any individual in our
family ever took such a liberty."
"It is then," said the young lady, "high
time that they should begin to take such liberty.
I was bom in a land of liberty, and I have
## p. 167 (#175) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 167
heard from all the family, and from all the
friends of the family, that there is not in the
wide world such another land for real liberty as
England; now I cannot think that. there can
be much liberty enjoyed by one who is not per-
mitted to accept or refuse an offer of marriage."
"But the authority of a parent," said Fitz-
george, who could, when the occasion required
it, talk as gravely and authoritatively as his
father had been habituated to talk; "the
authority of a parent is not inconsistent with
liberty."
"A want of freedom," said the young lady,
"is to my notion exceedingly inconsistent with
liberty. Indeed there is scarcely a single point
in which liberty is more valuable, or restraint
more galling than in the choice of a partner for
life."
"But surely, child," replied Fitzgeorge, still
gravely, and in a most didactic tone, "you will
not presume to say that, in your notions of
liberty, you would cast off all parental restraint
## p. 168 (#176) ############################################
168 FIT2GEORGE.
and government! Whence can you have learned
such ideas, that a parent has no authority over
a child, because we live in a land of liberty 1"
"Sir," said the daughter meekly, "I never
intended to question the authority of a parent
over a child; but the choice of a partner for
life is no part of the authority over the child,
for we are not children as long as we live.
During the period that the law calls infancy, or
childhood, you have authority; but if you dic-
tate to me who shall be my husband, I am
made subject to your parental authority for life.
I am content, sir, if it be your will, not to marry
till I am of age, but I must be positive in using
then the freedom to which I am born." .
Here was another topic of reflection and me-
ditation to Fitzgeorge, a topic not by any means
agreeable, for it was only another corroboration
of the intractableness of life's events. "Still,"
said he to himself, "I am going on in the same
track as ever, looking to have every thing ac-
cording to my own fancy, and finding myself
^

P1TZGEORGE. 169
disappointed in almost every instance. In my
childhood I was subjected to capricious re-
straints; when I came of age I was presently
involved in difficulties, from which even yet I
am scarcely extricated. I have been driven
into marriage with one for whom I never had
and never could have the slightest affection or
regard; and now, after having been annoyed
and tormented by my father and my wife, I am
opposed and thwarted by my own child. I
know the obstinacy of her disposition, that I
must ultimately yield; and the more I oppose
her, the more ridiculous I shall look when at
last I am subdued. Then, again, I greatly fear
that this marriage of hers, if it should take
place, and I do not see how I can prevent it,
will interfere with my schemes for getting rid
of my wife; this child is still attached to her
mother, and of course her husband will be of
the same faction. Soon, perhaps, I shall be a
grandfather, and my wife will be a grand-
mother; and what a ridiculous figure shall I

make in the eyes of the worlda grandfather

tious conduct!"
Fitzgeorge was too indolent to be much of a
plotter. If his father had been concerned in
the present matter, he would have woven every
web of sophistry or plot to bring things about
after his own mind; but Augustus could merely
express his angry authority and impatience, and
at last be thwarted by his child. He could not
even plot against his wife with any degree of
tact and skill, and he left to others to manoeuvre
for him, and they were totally unable to ac-
complish that which they undertook. It was
rather late in life to be learning lessons; but
Fitzgeorge, advanced as he was in life, was too
young yet to learn one lesson that had been
inculcated on him year after year and day after
day, through the whole course of his being;
that lesson was, that no man comes into the
world with happiness ready made for him, but
that he must make it for himself of such mate-

FITZGEORGE. 171
rials as nature furnishes him withal. Many
persons imagine that with such advantages of
rank, fortune, person and accomplishments as
Augustus Fitzgeorge possessed, they must be
happy: perhaps they might be, but with such
conduct as his they certainly could not be, nor
can any human being in any condition enjoy his
life by the mere reception of impulses and im-
pressions; whatever happiness he enjoys as a
rational and intelligent being, must be through
the medium of reason and intelligence.
A gentleman who is between fifty and sixty
years of age, and somewhat corpulent, who has
lived a life of luxury and self-indulgence, not hav-
ing cultivated the powers of the mind, nor having
denied himself any gratification that his appe-
tites have desired, is not, one should imagine, in
a condition to form very sanguine hopes of a
bright and glorious sunset of life, or to antici-
pate much unmingled joy and prosperity.
Fitzgeorge, however, had lived so long by the
stimulus of hope, that he could not now live

172 FITZGEORGE.
without it; and as each one of his hopes failed
him one after the other, he readily, by means
of a yet active imagination, contrived to supply
himself with more. It was not at all consistent
with his schemes, that his daughter should marry
this gentleman on whom her affections were
fixed; for by so doing she would be not only less
under the influence of her father, but more able
to patronize and defend her mother. So that
by this step, Fitzgeorge saw one fresh obstacle
to obtaining a divorce. He consulted with his
friends concerning the proposed marriage of his
daughter; for so very feeble was he in resolve,
that he could do nothing without the aid of
counsellors. His friends were decidedly of
opinion that the step would tend to embarrass
him in his attempts to obtain a divorce from his
wife; and yet they thought that as the young
lady was of great obstinacy or firmness of mind,
there would be nothing gained by a loud and
violent opposition, save a publication of his de-
feat. For though defeat itself be mortifying,
## p. 173 (#181) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 173
yet to such a man as Augustus Fitzgeorge, the
publication of the defeat would be more morti-
fying still.
So after due deliberation, the consent of the
Hon. Augustus Fitzgeorge was given to his
daughter's marriage; and the tenants, who
seemed to think that they could never have
too many of these great folks to support, began
rejoicing at the marriage with just such intem-
perate noise as they rejoiced at the marriage of
Augustus himself in days past. They talked as
though they imagined that the existence of
great folks was the greatest blessing that earth
could witness or heaven could give. Fitzgeorge
himself remembered his own marriage, and all
the festivities and congratulations which had
attended that, and now he had to undergo con-
gratulations on his daughter's marriage; and he
accepted the congratulations with a marvellously
fine external grace, but with an inward bitter
repugnance. What a mass of formality is
human life, especially civilized life, and most

especially of all the highest walks of civilized
life. People talk about the necessitous classes,
but there is no class more necessitous than the
highest, no people on the face of the earth so
much under the dominion of the word must,
as the fashionable world. The must that nails
a merchant to his desk, that plants a shop-
keeper behind his counter, that ties the me-
chanic to his board or his loom, and drives the
negro to his whip-thanked toil, is not so strong
by one-half as the must that regulates every
movement in the life of a person of high fashion.
Under the domineering influence of this must,
Fitzgeorge seemed highly delighted with his
daughter's marriage, highly honoured with the
congratulations of his friends, some of whom
almost laughed at his misery while they were
congratulating him on this addition to his hap-
piness. But he must receive their congratula-
tions, he must return them smile for smile and
bow for bow; he must receive his son-in-law

settlement and establishment of his daughter.
Yet this man, who was thus under the dominion
of must, looked upon himself as something
vastly superior to the ordinary race of mortals,
more privileged and more free.Bah!

CHAPTER X.
ARCHITECTURE.
What might have been the sequel to the
congratulated marriage of the young Louisa,
and what the sorrows waiting for her in the
path of life, must rest unknown. From all
earthly joy and sorrow, from all temporal pro-
sperity and adversity, from all worldly friends
and enemies she was withdrawn by the hand of
death. Happier are they who die to be pitied,
than they who live to be pitied.
Now the studious and careful pursuer of hap-
piness, gaiety, honour and good repute, was in
a state of comparative solitude, and nearly in-

dependent. His father, who had ruled him
with a harsh and iron despotism, was now totally
incapable of attending to any business, and was
as helpless as a new-born child. His wife was
far away on the continent, and his only child
was in the grave. There might have been an
opportunity now, and perhaps to some minds
under these circumstances there would have
been an opportunity, for the sobriety of thought
and the steadiness of moral reflection leading
to and terminating in a renovation and refor-
mation of life. But the Honourable Augustus
Fitzgeorge preferred a new house to a new life,
and for the diversion of his grief, and the pro-
motion of his rational happiness, he gave himself
to serious meditation on topics of architecture.
This had been from his earliest days a favourite
study with him, and it has been quaintly said of
him, with reference to his architectural career,
that he began life with building castles in the
air, and that he finished it by building mansions
in the mud.

The purse of Lord Fitzgeorge being now
more at the command of Augustus; almost, in-
deed, as much as if it had been his own, he re-
solved to enjoy himself to his heart's content,
if possible, in constructing some superb man-
sion with which he might be proud to identify
his own magnificent self. Architects came
around him, trying if they could do for his
mind that which the tailors had done for his
body; that is, to fit it to a nicety. Fitzgeorge
was not the best calculator in the world in any
sense; he knew that his architectural desires
were boundless, and it appeared as though he
imagined that the wealth of Lord Fitzgeorge
was boundless too. What strange notions some
people do get into their heads with respect to
property, seeming to imagine that small in-
comes require a great deal of management, and
that large incomes require none: just as though
it were easier to navigate a man of war than to
row a skiff. The truth is, that he who has
A

little knows what he has, and that he who has
much, does not know what he wants.
Committees and councils of taste were as-
sembled, and many were the learned discus-
sions on Gothic, Grecian, Italian, Egyptian, and
Chinese architecture. There were already se-
veral mansions, the property of Lord Fitzgeorge,
and presently likely to become the property of
Augustus, besides those which were his own
exclusively and independently. So it was a
matter of doubt and debate whether a new one
should be built, or whether some extensive and
important alterations should be made in the old
ones, or in any one of them.
Perhaps Fitzgeorge was never more happy
than when thinking how happy he should be
when some ingenious and splendid architec-
tural design should be put into actual brick and
mortar, gilding and stucco. Blessed be the
memory of the man who invented pap fronts
for palaces, and made brick walls look like
stone for ten minutes or thereabouts, by means
## p. 180 (#188) ############################################
180 FITZGEORGE.
of plaster, paste, pap, or some such marvellous
succedaneum! Say what we will respecting the
trowel style, it has given many a throb of de-
light to the bosom of Augustus Fitzgeorge.
He has spent some of his happiest hours in
looking over the well-drawn designs of buildings,
some of which might one day or other be his.
Say that by the time that the mansion might
be completed, that Fitzgeorge might be nearly
ready for a mansion that knows no feast save
that of the worms. What then? Is that any
reason that it should not be built? Certainly
not. The eating of a hare is not such good
sport as the catching of it, and the possession
of a fox is not so pleasant as the riding after it.
Fitzgeorge thought that his happiness would be
in dwelling in a house constructed according to
his own taste; but the fact is, that his happiness
was in thinking what his happiness would be.
While Fitzgeorge and his friends, assisted by
divers dexterous artists, were meditating on the
various devices which had been submitted as
## p. 181 (#189) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 181
eligible, more eligible or most eligible, the
venerable Lady Fitzgeorge died and left a man-
sion at her son's disposal. The artists were all
delightednot at the death of Lady Fitzgeorge,
for they did not care enough about her to be
glad or sorry;but they were all delighted at
the fine capabilities which the mansion in ques-
tion possessed for improvement and enlarge-
ment, and for becoming, under proper manage-
ment, and at comparatively little expense, a
dwelling worthy of so great a man as Augustus
Fitzgeorge. By some covenant or other in their
leases, the tenants were under an obligation to
keep in proper repair certain mansions on the
estate, and this was one of them.
"Now," said one of the architectural artists,
"now is the time for you to jockey your tenants,
and to make them build you a handsome man-
sion."
"You know," said Fitzgeorge, "that their
leases bind them only to repair, not to rebuild."
"Very true," said the architect, "but what
## p. 182 (#190) ############################################
182 FITZGEORGE.
is the meaning of the word repair? They are
bound to make all suitable repairs, and the de-
cision of what are suitable repairs rests with
architects and persons skilful in building, who
may be employed by Lord Fitzgeorge or his
representatives. An enlargement of a house is
a kind of repair contemplated in the covenant
of the lease, and that in several instances has
been done, therefore the law will bear you out
in that by virtue of precedent. Now if you may
add one room, you may add two or two hun-
dred, and may make them as large as you
please. You have nothing to do but to take
care that you leave some part of the old house
standing, so that it is not a total rebuilding,
and then you are perfectly safe, and may go to
any extent you will."
"I like your notions," said Fitzgeorge, " and
I shall be glad to see them acted upon; only
you know, before we begin, it is generally the
custom to consult a committee of the tenants,
to know whether it may be quite convenient for
## p. 183 (#191) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 183
them just at the present time, to undergo so
large an expense as will be necessary to make
all these repairs we contemplate. Of course
you will lay the plan before them, and let them
see how much we intend to improve the estate
and the appearance of it, by architectural em-
bellishment."
"Oho," said the architect, " we must not let
them into all the secret at once; for if we do,
they will begin to grumble, and though grum-
bling may do them no good it may do you
harm, and ultimately injure the estate."
"I think," said Fitzgeorge, "the estate is
more trouble than it is worth. What a nuisance
it is that we cannot build, buy, and live as one
likes, without all this trouble!"
"Never mind that," said the architect, " only
let me have the profits of the job, I will take
care that you shall have as superb a mansion
as any nobleman needs wish to live in. All the
world admires your taste in architecture."
It is scarcely necessary, perhaps, for the pur-
r

184 FITZGEORGE.
pose of information to the reader to observe
here, that the artist in question was rather dis-
posed to pay compliments to his employer at
the expense of sincerity and truth. The artist
did not think highly of the taste of Fitzgeorge,
but rather among his own clerks and draughts-
men used to make himself merry, with what he
called the freaks of Fitzgeorge's fancy. Fitz-
george had, in fact, no more taste than this:
that he was passionately fond of any thing re-
markably fine and showy. The mansion in
which he had resided for some years, and to
which he made many additions, and to which
he was desirous of making many more, had
been altered and re-altered, over and over again.
It was to this mansion that he built the addi-
tional dining-room, on occasion of the visit of
Lord Alexander and his friends. By the way,
this Lord Alexander, it has been said, laughed
at Fitzgeorge, for his gaudy taste; and said, that
it was a great pity that he had not been brought
up for a showman; and added, rather sarcasti-
## p. 185 (#193) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 185
cally, that he would never make a complete
showman, for he was no conjuror; and the
proper showman ought to be something of a
conjuror. Besides this, he had several other
mansions, especially one near the sea-side,
which was built at a most enormous expense;
and which was so exceedingly ludicrous in its
form and decorations, that had not Fitzgeorge
been a person of high fashion and of consider-
able influence, he would have been laughed at
aloud for the outrageous absurdity of it. It
really seemed as if he had tried his utmost to
make something that should outdo in absurdity
every thing that had ever stood upon the ground
before. If we were to describe it either with
pen or pencil, the reader would not believe it.
There was also belonging to the Fitzgeorge
family a large lumbering old mansion, built
nobody knows when; and which, by various
and repeated additions had increased in size,
till it was far too large for any comfortable
occupation: now it was the fancy of Fitzgeorge
## p. 186 (#194) ############################################
186 FITZGEORGE.
to have this place put into repair as he called
it, and a pretty extensive repair he made of it.
His passion for finery, indeed, lasted all his
life long, in one form or another; but it was
remarkable, that his taste for building was
strongest in his latter days. Perhaps, however,
the passion was not stronger, but had merely a
greater opportunity of gratification; inasmuch
as it was not till towards his latter days, that
he possessed the means of giving full indul-
gence to it. In his earlier days he had no
small ambition that way, but it was checked
by the want of means. And as he had been
all his life long anticipating the possession of
the estate, now that he came to have the ma-
nagement of it, he seemed fully determined to
give way to his fancy for building.
At a meeting of some of the tenants, the
subject was ingeniously started by the steward,
in whom the management of all these matters
was vested, and he said, " Gentlemen, I sup-
pose you are all of you pretty well aware that
## p. 187 (#195) ############################################
F1TZGEOEGE. 187
by our leases, we are under an obligation to see
our landlord comfortably and decently lodged.
Now there are to be sure several mansions, as
they are called, on the estate; but there is not
one that is at all fit for the comfortable resi-
dence of our worthy landlord. Poor old Lord
Fitzgeorge you know is now superannuated, and
he takes no interest in such matters, and as the
young Augustus" (here some of the tenants
smiled) "has kindly condescended to undertake
the management of affairs for his father, it is
but fair that he should be treated with all due
respect, and certainly we ought not to hesitate
at letting him have the means of building him-
self some comfortable and handsome mansion,
such as may be comfortable to him, and reput-
able, I may say, to ourselves; for all good te-
nants ought to be proud to see their landlords
well lodged."
A great deal of applause followed this open-
ing address of the steward, and the whole party
seemed ready to give an unlimited order to
'

188 FITZGEORGE.
have such a mansion erected, as might be wor-
thy the dignity of him who was worthy the
dignity of being their landlord. This dignity,
it seems, is a marvellously expensive kind of
article; and one cannot help remarking by the
way, what equivocal ideas of dignity persons
seem to entertain; for, by means of a curious
kind of sympathy, we make another's finery or
tawdriness the means of our own dignity. The
French people in the last century, though op-
pressed and plundered by their kings and
nobles, were yet proud of the palaces and pomp
which their kings enjoyed; and they would
have felt their own pride touched by any dimi-
nution of the royal splendour. And, very likely,
to come down to more modern days and more
familiar things, many of the good citizens of
London would be very sorry to see the Lord
Mayor's coach shorn of its brightness. They
would more readily deprive themselves of some
physical enjoyments than lose the gratification
of their civic vanity, by the absence of that

F1TZGEORGE. 189
large, lumbering piece of finery. It is, in fact,
by considering kings, landlords, and lord
mayors, our own, in some mystical roundabout
manner, that leads us to undergo almost any
expense, for the purpose of decorating these
animals.
Fitzgeorge's steward was a crafty fellow, and
he understood this passion or propensity in the
human species, and made the most of it, by
getting a good job for the architect, who was
a friend of his, and by procuring for his master
a handsome house to live in.
Some of the tenants, however, had begun to
find out, that though dignity was a pretty thing
enough to talk about, and all very well when
people had got enough to eat, drink, and clothe
themselves withal, yet it was sometimes bought
for more than it was worth; they therefore were
not quite so soon carried away by the steward's
palaver, and one of them, who acted as spokes-
man for the rest, said, "That is all very pretty
talk of yours, Mr. Steward; but I must con-
,

fess, that if I must be proud at all, I would ra-
ther be proud of myself than of my landlord.
I don't see that a landlord's fine house can feed
or clothe my family. Indeed, I think our land-
lord has houses enough already, far more than
he can possibly live in. He is a fine fat fellow,
no doubtI mean the young one, as you call
him, our deputy landlord as is; yet I think
the houses that he has already are big enough
to hold him. Now, at his time of life, for he is
not a very young man, notwithstanding all your
blarney, I think he might be better employed
than in building new houses. But I suppose
you and he have been laying your heads to-
gether, just for the sake of giving a job to Tom
Clarke, the builder and carpenter."
A very few of the tenants laughed heartily at
these blunt remarks, but the steward was very
angry, and so were most of those who called
themselves the steward's friends, and they cried
out shame. The steward, however, could com-
mand his temper when any thing was to be got

FITZGEORGE. 191
by it, and knowing that he was going to bam-
boozle the tenants for the sake of pleasing his
master, Augustus Fitzgeorge, and for the pur-
pose of giving a job to Tom Clarke, the car-
penter, he smilingly replied, "The tenants, of
course, have a right to express their opinions on
the subject, and to determine to what extent
any repairs in any of the mansions shall be
carried; yet, sir, I can't help saying, that it is
not very handsome of you to be making rude
remarks on our young landlord's corpulency. I
am of opinion that you do not know much about
the matter; for I can assure you,on the word of
a gentleman, that the Honourable Augustus Fitz-
george is not near so fat as he was, and that
he never was so fat as some malicious people
have represented him. Have you never seen the
picture of him drawn by Larry Thomas, the
sign-painter? If you have, I am sure you must
acknowledge that he is a very good-looking,
well-proportioned man; and that picture is said,
by good judges, to be a most excellent like-
ness."

192 FITZGEOKGE.
"Is it more like than the orginal 1" asked
one of the tenants.
"Yes," replied the steward; and the whole
party, except some of the steward's particular
friends, burst out into a hearty laugh. The
steward, who was rather a dull man, did not
know what they were laughing at, and he
gravely went on with his speech, saying, "But
however, be that as it may, that's neither here
nor there, and nothing to the purpose; but we
are bound by our leases to provide for the pro-
per and suitable repair of the mansions on the
estate; and I am sure I am the last man in the
world to think of running the tenants to any
unnecessary expense. As for Tom Clarke, I
believe he is as honest and clever a fellow as
ever put brick and timber together, and I don't
want Tom to have the job, except that if he will
do it more reasonably than any one else, I think
ought to have it. But I have got the whole
calculation made out most completely and ac-
curately, even to a shilling. The house that
## p. 193 (#201) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 193
old Lady Fitzgeorge used to live in, is now ab-
solutely out of repair, and we have been think-
ing, that by laying out a few pounds upon that,
we may have a mansion for our landlord to live
in, that neither he nor we need to be ashamed
of."
Having said this, the steward produced Tom
Clarke's estimate for repairing the old house,
and made it appear so plausible, that the te-
nants were easily prevailed upon to consent to
the plan, and they gave the steward commis-
sion to see that it was done properly. And one
or two of those who at first grumbled at it, when
they saw how very little it was likely to cost,
and how very easily Augustus would be satis-
fied, were ready enough to let the steward have
his own way, and they told him that they did
not wish to behave unhandsomely to their land-
lord, but that they were desirous that every
thing should be done "properly, only at the
same time they could not help saying, that as
times were very bad just now, and that as

scarcely any money was stirring just at this
particular time, they hoped that due considera-
tion would be taken, and that no more would be
spent than was absolutely necessary.
"Oh, most certainly!" replied the steward;
"nobody can be more considerate of his tenants
than Augustus Fitzgeorge is. He will never, I
am sure, ask for any thing that is unreasonable,
and he will be always ready to deny himself any
indulgence for the sake of the tenants. In that
respect he is as good as his father."
Having got the consent of the tenants that
the old house should be put into repair, the
steward hastily, and full of glee, went to Fitz-
george and said, "Now, sir, we have gained
the point for you, and not with any particular
limitation of expense. Only, you know, you
must be as reasonable as you can, or you will
get me into disgrace."
"Trust me for that," replied Fitzgeorge;
"and now send Clarke to me with his plans,
and I will give him his orders."
## p. 195 (#203) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 195
"What a goose," said Fitzgeorge to himself,
"is that steward of ours! What do I care
about his getting into disgrace, so as I get into
a handsome house. This is just the thing that
I wanted, to have the arrangement of a mansion
after my own taste and judgment; and now I
will let the world see what taste I really have.
There is not one man in a thousand that has any
real taste in architecture. I will immortalize
my name by architectural magnificence. I have
done something for tailors, now I will do some-
thing for architects."
The bricklayers and carpenters, and all other
artists who were concerned in building, were
presently set to work, and Tom Clarke was as
busy as a bee, and as happy as a fiddler. Some
of the tenants, however, just now and then
cast their eyes upon the work, and they could
not help thinking that there were symptoms of
much more extensive repairs than they had cal-
culated upon. They thought, that if these were
only repairs that were going on, they were very
k2

196 FITZGEORGE.
sweeping repairs indeed, for there seemed to be
nothing at all left of the old housescarcely a
stick or a stone. So they mentioned it to the
steward next time they met, and said, "I am
afraid that Tom Clarke will have a swinging
long bill against us for repairs."
"Oh dear no," said the steward very good-
humouredly, "you need not be afraid, I assure
you. Tom Clarke is as honest a fellow as ever
lived; and as for my young master there is not
a more amiable and reasonable creature living
on the face of the earth. I have a very high
opinion of old Lord Fitzgeorge, but I do think
that his son in some points outdoes his father,
and I have no doubt that he will prove to be
the best of landlords."
That sort of talk, for he said a great deal
more than any body could have patience to read,
pleased and quieted some of the tenants; but
there was one sharp and shrewd fellow there,
who knew as well as any man living the dif-
ference between sixpence and a shilling, and he
## p. 197 (#205) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 197
said, "I tell you what, Mr. Steward, you may
talk as much blarney to the tenants as you
please about Tom Clarke's honesty, and your
young master's reasonablenessby the way, I
wonder how you can call him young; yet I can
tell you that I have been examining the works
going on at the house where the old lady lived,
and that the job cannot be completed for less
than ten times the sum that was stated in the
estimate. It is a downright shame and a piece
of cheatery that ought to be exposed and re-
probated."
The steward knew all that as well as any
body could tell him, and therefore he would
not put himself in a passion, but endeavoured
to throw dust in the eyes of the tenants, and
instead of saying any thing about the estimates
or the expense, he launched out into a long
lachrymose lamentation on the great sin of call-
ing Fitzgeorge old when he was to all intents
and purposes a young man.
The next time that the steward had an in-

198 FITZGEOHGE.
terview with Fitzgeorge, he said to him, "I
beg pardon, sir, for taking such a liberty, but
really the truth is I shall not know what to say
to the tenants, if you go on at this extravagant
rate. They throw all the blame on me, and I
have to tell all manner of lies, and invent all
manner of shuffling excuses, to keep the blame
off from you. Positively you must manage
things a little more decently."
"Ah, you are a clever fellow," replied Fitz-
george, " I shall leave all these matters to you.
You know how to manage these turbulent
tenants."
"But the management of so large an estate,"
said the steward," is actually a difficult matter."
"I know it, my dear fellow," answered Fitz-
george; "it is so difficult a matter that I should
not think of ever attempting it. I leave it all
to you; and you have only to see that you are
well paid for your trouble, and that there is
wherewithal to supply my daily outgoings.
You may do just as you will with the estate;
## p. 199 (#207) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 199
you may let the farms to any body you may like,
you may get what rents you can for them; you
may pull down what houses or barns you will,
or you may build when, what, and where you
please; you may cut down whatever timber you
want, and sell it; you may raise any money by
mortgagein a word, you may do whatever you
think fit with the estate, supplying yourself and
your friends, only let me have as much money
as I want, and as little trouble as possible."
"Why, sir," replied the steward, "nothing
can be more reasonable than that, I must allow;
yet with every feeling of respect I must be per-
mitted to say, that if you will indulge your taste
for expense so very much, you might spend
upon yourself the whole proceeds of the estate,
leaving your tenants nothing to live upon."
"My good man," replied Fitzgeorge, "you
talk very reasonably, and the tenants are no
doubt much obliged to you; but what are the
tenants to me, except as the means of supply-
ing me with money? And if I should happen to
## p. 200 (#208) ############################################
200 FITZGEORGE.
squeeze them dry, they must exert their wits to
produce more money. If you rob the bees of
their honey, you know that they will make
more: nothing so good to make the tenants
industrious as keeping them poor. I, you
know, as a landlord, or rather son of a landlord,
and deputy landlord, cannot possibly work.
Some of our predecessors remembered the good
old times when it was the common sentiment
that the only use of tenants was to work for
their landlords."
"Avery good and pious sentiment no doubt,"
replied the steward, "and I can assure you
that I do all that is in my power to bring the
tenants back to that pleasant notion, but I posi-
tively cannot. Instead of being convinced by
my arguments, they laugh at me."
"Well, my dear fellow," replied Fitzgeorge,
"only get me money, and they may laugh at
you, or you may laugh at them, just as it pleases
you. I must have money, and I must have
a mansion; and if you cannot manage the
## p. 201 (#209) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 201
matter for me, I must get another steward that
can, that's all." So saying, the Honourable
Augustus Fitzgeorge gave his steward a slap
on the back, and dismissed him.
Away went the man, muttering as he went,
"What a strange fellow is this Augustus Fitz-
george! What can I do with him, and what
can I do without him? I must not put myself
out of place; yet positively I know not how to
keep in, if it depends upon supplying his ex-
travagances. And then what a bother it is to
be under the necessity of making it out to the
tenants that Augustus is one of the most rea-
sonable and amiable creatures living, while
every body knows to the contrary. Some of
these days, I suppose, I shall have to prove to
the tenants that he is a slender young gentle-
man of twenty-two years of age!"
The building of the mansion went on, and
Fitzgeorge was most happy in watching its
progress. He could not help thinking how blest
he should be when dilating his mighty self in
k 3

the saloons of the gorgeous building. He never
inquired or cared about the expense, but re-
gardless whence the money was to come from
that should pay for it all, he kept continually
issuing fresh orders, and making all manner of
ridiculous blunders, directing work to be done
that afterwards had to be undone at a very con-
siderable expense; and not only was all the
odium of the extravagance, but all the disgrace
of the architectural blundering, was laid at the
door of the poor steward or the architect. And
after all this parade and expense, Fitzgeorge
never occupied the house at all.

The career of Fitzgeorge had now proceeded
a long, long way most unsatisfactorily. Hope
after hope had expired, wish after wish had been
ungratified. Almost all his days had been im-
bittered by some humiliation or perplexed by
some cares. He who had commenced life in the
full and confident expectation of having, through
its whole course, nothing but unmingled plea-
sure and deep content, now found himself fretful,
fat, peevish, and morose; looking on the world
as on a painted courtesan who had lured him to
destruction. But he had no other hope than in

the few years which remained to him, as a tenant
of the living world; and was it likely, that these
few remaining years should ever be able to make
him amends for all the cares and mortifications
of the past? Not at all. Had he, indeed, given
himself a moments thought, he might have seen
that no great promise lay before him; he had
exhausted almost all the sources of enjoyment
of a physical nature, and for moral or intellec-
tual enjoyments he had neither taste nor capa-
city. He could form no new combinations of
soup. or punch, and he had comparatively little
pleasure in the old and well-known flavours.
He could drink, but was afraid of the conse-
quences of drink, lest it should shorten his
days; so that he enjoyed the pleasures of in-
toxication partially and imperfectly. His senses
in general were failing him, and his actual in-
terest in life had been abated, though he clung
with all his power to its pomps and vanities and
sensualities.
At length the old Lord Fitzgeorge departed

this life at an advanced age, leaving a title and
an encumbered estate to Augustus. Better late
than never, thought the younger, though now
no longer younger Fitzgeorge. Straight there
rose before the eye of Augustus, visions of pomp
and glory, of new mansions and new furniture.
This accession to his dignity brought a little
more interest and impulse to his mind, and he
had the sensation of a child who, when just
dropping to sleep at the close of a day, is
awakened to partake of a splendid supper. His
prospects now for a moment seemed bright, and
he felt as though he was going to have every
thing his own way. But it was merely a gleam
a transient gleamit was the emerging of
the sun's brightness just before it sets in dark-
ness; for presently came to him the intelligence
that the Lady Louisa had claimed the title of
Lady Fitzgeorge, and had sent intimation that
it was her immediate intention to come over to
England, and to demand the honours and im-
munities belonging to her rank.
## p. 206 (#214) ############################################

The person who brought this sad intelligence
to Fitzgeorge was an apothecary, and had been
accustomed to sights of sorrow and sounds of
grief; but he said afterwards, that he had never
witnessed so sad a sight as that of Fitzgeorge
when he communicated this intelligence to him.
He first looked red with anger, and then looked
pale with fear; then nearly fainted away. For-
tunately a bottle of brandy, by the merest acci-
dent in the world, happened to be standing at
his side; and the judicious apothecary consi-
derately and kindly urged him to drink two or
three glasses, by which he was happily pre-
vented from absolutely swooning. When he
had swallowed the brandy, and smacked his
lips and wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand, for he was too much of a gentleman to
wipe it with the palm of his hand, he lifted up
his eyes to the ceiling, which was very elegantly
painted, and said, "Dn it." He did not
mean to damn the ceiling or the brandy, but
the return of his wife.

The apothecary was so shocked at Fitzgeorge's
profaneness, that he also took a glass of brandy
Out of mere fright, scarcely knowing what he
did. When master and man were both primed,
they sat down seriously to deliberate what was
best to be done.
"Take another glass, doctor," said Fitz-
george.
The doctor did so; and the Honourable Au-
gustus, whom by the way we should now call
Lord Fitzgeorge, did the same.
"How shall we proceed?" said Fitzgeorge.
"Positively I can't say," said the apothecary.
"Have you got any witnesses? Can you make
out any case against her?"
"Fifty," replied Fitzgeorge.
"One will do as well as fifty," replied the
apothecary, " provided that one is a good one."
'* For that matter;" said Fitzgeorge, "I sup-
pose one is as good as another. My worthy
agents on the continent send me word that I
could have as many witnesses as I pleased to
## p. 208 (#216) ############################################
208 FITZGEORGE.
pay for, who would be kind enough to swear for
me to any thing I chose to dictate."
"That is all very pleasant and promising,"
replied the apothecary; "but I do not half like
that superabundant readiness in swearing. That
was the case with the Simkins some years ago.
They did more harm than good by attempting
too much. You must endeavour to have your
witnesses properly tutored, so that they may be
able to bear cross-examination; many an honest
witness breaks down under that, and scarcely
any hired witnesses can stand it unless they
have been exceedingly well prepared."
"But my correspondents tell me, that I may
depend on the firmness and coherence of the
witnesses, who are as properly and completely
prepared as men can be; they have all re-
hearsed their parts, and have learned them so
thoroughly by heart, that there is little fear of
their forgetting them; and they are given to
understand, that they are to be paid in propor-
tion to the success of their testimony."
## p. 209 (#217) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 209
"I hope," said the apothecary, "that they
will not attempt to swear too much. Perjury,
you know, my Lord, is a very wicked thing,
and the less we have of it the better. I would
not use it too freely, were I in your case."
"My dear doctor," replied Fitzgeorge, "I
will use no more of it than is absolutely neces-
sary. It is not only wicked, but in the present
case, it will be exceedingly expensive."
"Shall you proceed immediately?" asked the
doctor.
"I have not yet had time to give that matter
a thought," replied Fitzgeorge. After a little
pause he added, "Suppose she should recrimi-
nate?"
"Can she afford to purchase witnesses?"
"She may have too many without purchas-
ing."
"If it should come to that, you will find it a
difficult matter to get a divorce; nay, an abso-
lute impossibility."
"I would never put myself to the trouble and

expense of a prosecution, if I had no hopes of
getting a divorce. Here is a difficulty. Every
body must know, that I should be glad to have
a divorce, and yet I must not seem too eager
after it. What must I do ?To have her living
in this country, and bearing the title of Lady
Fitzgeorge, is more than I can possibly endure,
even though I should never see her."
"Perhaps," said the apothecary, "you can
bribe her to stay abroad."
"Or terrify her," said Fitzgeorge.
"Or both," said the apothecary. "Send a
messenger over to the continent, to tell her,
that if she will stay where she is, you will in-
crease her allowance according to your own
increased means; but that if she returns to
this country you will immediately commence a
suit against her, which will be certain to ter-
minate in divorce, contempt, and poverty."
"And yet," said Fitzgeorge, "for we must
keep our eye very much upon public opinion in
this matter; if I bribe her to stay abroad, will

FITZGEORGE. 211
it not look as if I had some doubts of the suc-
cess of my system of prosecution. Every body
knows that I should be glad to get rid of her;
and, therefore, if I make any offer by way of
compromise, will it not look as if I feared that the
other scheme should fail? It is all very well to
promise, it is all very well to threaten, but threats
and promises too are superfluous; they show
weakness. Nobody much heeds the threats of
those who make promises. The law, you know,
only threatens, and that answers the purpose
for the most part. Now, if my wife knows that
I have power to put my threats in execution,
she will consider it quite enough, if I suffer her
to remain unmolested where she is. But, if I
offer her a bribe to stay away, she will imme-
diately infer, that I have no great confidence in
the power of my threat. And if she regards
not the threat, she will not regard the bribe.
Mr. Apothecary, I feel myself puzzled."
"But if you neither bribe nor threaten, what
will you do? She must comenothing can
prevent her."
## p. 212 (#220) ############################################
212 FITZGEORGE.
"She must not come," replied Fitzgeorge;
"I will move heaven and earth to prevent
her."
"But if heaven and earth will not prevent
her, what then?"
"Why, then I must go further,
"Flectere si nequeo superos Aoheronta morebo."
"I know not how to advise you," said the
apothecary.
"And if you did know," said Fitzgeorge, "I
should not want your advice, for I should know
how to advise myself. It is a case in which no
one can advise to any good purpose. I have
overshot my mark."
Fitzgeorge filled a glass with brandy and
said, "Mr. Apothecaryyour good health."
The apothecary did the same to the good
health of Fitzgeorge, and departed; leaving his
lordship alone to doze off the effect of his brandy,
and to meditate on the threatened return of his
wife.
## p. 213 (#221) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. '213
Fitzgeorge muttered to himself and said,
"Bahthis apothecary is a fool! He can
give no advice. He has hardly wit enough to
find his way back to his own shop. What
must I do?What must I do ?Here am I
mustering my thoughts, and having no thoughts
to muster. How pleasantly life would pass
away, if I could always continue in this half-
muzzy and muddled condition. Just now at
this moment, I seem to care for nothingno,

I see double. I am glad my wife is not here
for if she was, I should see two. I must not
promise and threaten too, said the apothecary
I believe the fellow was right; for if I promise
as well as threaten, she will not mind my
threats. Suppose, then, I merely threaten.
Suppose I send to inform her that, if she per-
sists in returning to England, I will accuse her
of adultery, and that I have purchased two or
three score of witnesses, ready to swear to any
thing. But then suppose I fail in the proof-
Suppose I promise to double her allowance if
she stays away. Then all the world will say,
that I have endeavoured to get up a case against
her and have not been able, and that now I am
bribing her to stay away because I have nothing
against her. BotherI have been playing the
fool for the last forty years, and now I must
use my utmost skill to botch up the blunders
that I have made. She must not comeI will
threaten and promise, and promise and threaten.
I know not which way to turn. I should like

F1TZGEORGE. 215
to examine the witnesses myself, but not now,
for the brandy has got into my head. What a
small quantity of drink affects my head now!
I remember the time that I could drink, I forget
how much. I wish I had that time to come
over againand yet I was not happy even
thenthough rather happier than I am now."
Fitzgeorge then sank into an easy chair and
slept, but he was disturbed by many dreams
frightful dreams. Annoyances seemed to ac-
cumulate one upon another, till all life and
being grew wearisome and burdensome to him.
He would fain forget, but he could not; he
would fain look to the future with hope, but he
could not; he would fain bear the present with
patience, but he could not. He woke from his
dreamy sleep, and endeavoured to shake off
his sleepy dreams, but reality was worse than
imagination.
"Life," said he to himself, "is a game
which I have hitherto played badly, and now
the game is nearly up, and I cannot recover it.
## p. 216 (#224) ############################################
216 FITZGEORGE.
I began with a handful of trumps, and have
thrown them all away; I was so confident of my
luck, that I thought there was no need of skill.
I have been miserably wrong. Can I ever rectify
the past 1 Not till I can recal it. And what
is the future to be? The dregs of the past.
Oh, what a cruel mockery is the homage which
surrounds me! How insulting the adulation
of my flatterers! How misplaced the envy of
of my inferiors! All envy is misplaced I think;
for if any where there were appearances of an
enviable condition, surely mine was one to in-
vite envy; yet I know by bitter experience that
no one has any just cause, or ever had, to envy
me. Nor will I envy them. I will not add the
bitterness of imagination to the mortifications of
reality."
When the apothecary had got over the effects
of the brandy, he returned to Fitzgeorge, ac-
companied by his lordship's steward, one Jen-
kin, or Jankyn, formerly a haberdasher at Liver-
pool.

. "I have brought this gentleman with me,"
said the apothecary, "to take your lordship's
orders as to what you would wish to have done
in the present unhappy conjuncture of affairs,
for we are both of us unanimously of opinion
that if you do not wish her ladyship, that is to
say, your wife to come back to England, the best
thing you can do is to try all you can to pre-
vent her return."
"You are a pair of conj urors," said his lord-
ship, " and pray how am I to prevent it?"
"Why, my lord," replied Jenkin, rather
flattered by the compliment which his lordship
had paid him in calling him a conjuror, " I
humbly beg leave to be of opinion that, under
the present circumstances, the most eligible
mode of proceeding will be to send a messenger
to meet the lady, and to threaten, and to pro-
mise, and to beg, and to pray, and to implore
that she may not be so ill advised as to return
to England; for that, if she does, there will be

a prosecution commenced immediately against
her."
"But suppose," said Fitzgeorge, "that she
should not be afraid of a prosecution. That is
what I am afraid of; and in that case she will
come and defy us."
"In this predicament," replied the doctor,
"you must adopt the plan that I recommended
before, and promise as well as threaten."
"The plan that you recommended !" said Fitz-
george; "I thought that I proposed it, and
you objected to it."
"Quite the reverse," replied the apothecary.
"Ah, very likely," said Fitzgeorge, " I have
been asleep since."
"It will be necessary," said Jenkin, " to de-
termine quickly, for I understand that she has
sent to England for her lawyer, one Birch, who
is a sharpish kind of a fellow, and will not stick
at trifles; he will be glad to bring her home to
England, for if there is to be any prosecution
he will have a job."
## p. 219 (#227) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 219
Fitzgeorge did not like this Birch, and the
mention of his name put him quite in a passion
impatiently then he exclaimed, "Plague take
you both, go and send messengers or letters
immediately, promise, threaten, lie, swear, do
any tiling you will, only keep the woman out of
England."
So saying, he pushed Jenkin and the apothe-
cary out of the room, and they went and did as
they were commanded.
In the mean time Birch the lawyer hastened
over to meet the Lady Louisa, according to her
instructions; and as he went along he said to
himself, " Fitzgeorge now deserves all he suf-
fers, for his own incomparable folly. He
threatens his wife with a prosecution by means
of suborned witnesses, and lets all the world
know of his threat, and then he sends messen-
gers to her to say that he will withhold the pro-
secution, if she will remain on the continent,
and not claim the title of Lady Fitzgeorge.
Should she accede to these terms, she will ac-

knowledge the justice of the accusation. Know-
ing the persecution to which she would be
exposed in England, it was folly in her to attempt
to return, but it would now be madness to give
up the intention. By his own most exquisitely
absurd conduct, Fitzgeorge has brought upon
himself a trouble which will last him for the
rest of his life. His wife was coming to Eng-
land, he dreaded her coming, and he now puts
forth a manifesto that renders it impossible for
her not to come."
When Mr. Birch was introduced into the
presence of Lady Louisa, he found her not only
calm, but even cheerful, and thoroughly self-
possessed.
"I have not sent for you, Mr. Birch," said her
ladyship, " for the purpose of asking advice, for
I have but one line of conduct to pursue. My
husband, after having persecuted me in Eng-
land till he has driven me to the continent, has
now followed me with his persecution and
threats on the continent, till he compels me to

return. I came here to avoid insult, I must go
back again to refute calumny. Is not my situ-
ation one of complete and unparalleled hard-
ship? Your profession, Mr. Birch, has led you
to an acquaintance with many cases of oppres-
sion and cruelty, but with none, I apprehend,
equal to this of mine. I would willingly have
lived in seclusion and retirement, but I could
not. I found that my steps were watched, that
daily and hourly I was waylaid; that an em-
bassy had been absolutely sent from England
purposely to get up a charge against me. Now,
sir, this charge was every where understood to
be got up against me for the purpose of pre-
venting my return to England, in case of that
event which has made a change in my hus-
band's rank and titles. When that event oc-
curred, I should have only corroborated the
suspicions that were thrown out against me,
had I hesitated to return immediately, or to
announce my intention of returning. It is an
affair in which I can have no choice."
## p. 222 (#230) ############################################
222 FITZGEORGE.
Mr. Birch acknowledged the justice of her
ladyship's remarks, and the hardships that sur-
rounded her. To the messengers who were sent
from Fitzgeorge, and to the message which they
brought, an immediate answer was returned,
saying that she who feared not justice would
not stoop to ask for mercy. To her legal ad-
viser she said, " I am now placed in a situation
in which I scarcely know how to act for the
best, and in which I am no more capable of re-
ceiving, than any one is competent to give me
advice. Say that I look meekly and tearful,
bowed down in spirit, and broken in heart; will
not my enemies, that is my husband's syco-
phants, for none have cause of hostility against
me, save such as find it convenient to play the
sycophant to him, will not these people affirm
that my bended spirit is a token of conscious
guilt. And again, if I bear myself with a gay
and cheerful spirit, and am unabashed before
my persecutors and accusers, then they will
reprove me for my boldness and charge me with

being insensible to shame. But with whom
should shame rest? With conspirators or their
victim. I have nothing to be ashamed of, but
my husband."
Speedily the accused and calumniated wife
returned to England, greatly to the annoyance
of her husband, who was afraid to prosecute,
and yet afraid to abstain from prosecution. He
sent for his faithful slab, Jenkin, and said to
him, "Now this troublesome woman is come,
and we must do our best to get rid of her.
That impudent fellow, Birch, will defend her
through thick and thin, but I hope and trust
that we shall be too many for him. I have all
the papers and letters in my possession, and
you shall have them to look over with some of
your friends, and you must give me your
opinion as to the mode of proceeding. The
beauty of the matter is, that we have every thing
in our own hands; for my wife does not know who
are the witnesses against her, nor what are the
## p. 224 (#232) ############################################
224 FITZGEORGE.
charges. We have even bought over some of
her own servants."
"Why, if that be the case," said Jenkin,
with great simplicity of manner, "you will have
direct evidence: for if all be true that has been
aid, it is impossible but that her own servants
must know the facts, and, of course, that will
be better than circumstantial evidence."
u If all be true ?you blockhead!" said
Fitzgeorge, angrily, "what do you mean by
presuming to doubt? Sirrah, will you dare to
believe that my wife is innocent, if I choose to
say that she is guilty?"
"Certainly not," replied Mr. Jenkin, almost
frightened out of his wits by the terrible man-
ner in which Fitzgeorge spoke to him; " Cer-
tainly not, my lord, I should be very sorry to
doubt or deny any thing that your lordship
might be pleased to affirm."
"You had better not, indeed," said Fitz-
george, " for it would be as much as your place
is worth."
\
## p. 225 (#233) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 225
Mr. Jenkin immediately departed, making
ten thousand bows, and begging ten thousand
pardons; and he carried the papers to his
friend, the apothecary, and said, "Upon my
word, Mr. Squirt, I have got into a pretty
scrape with this precious master of mine. Here
are the letters and papers all about my lady's
conduct or misconduct, when she was abroad,
and master says that he insists upon it that I
shall find evidence of her guilt in them, and
that if I don't it is quite as much as my place
is worth. I wish you would give me your
help."
"With all my heart," said the apothecary.
So they two sat down, and went to reading
the letters and conning over the documents, on
which they were employed quite till midnight;
for it was an object with them both, if possible,
to find unquestionable evidences of guilt. When
they had fairly finished their task, Jenkin looked
very knowingly at the apothecary, and said,
"Well, Squirt, what do you think of all this?"
l3
## p. 226 (#234) ############################################
226 FITZGEORGE.
"Think!" echoed the apothecary, "why I
think that Lord Fitzgeorge ought to be ashamed
to put such a parcel of trash into the hands of
a respectable man. It is enough to make one
blush to read it!"
"And what does it prove, after all?" said
Mr. Jenkin.
"At present," said the apothecary, "it
proves nothing; but I am afraid it will prove
soon a means of great trouble to you, or your
master, or both, For you see, notwithstanding
the evidence of one or two of her own domestic
servants, there is nothing of positive proof, all is
merely circumstantial. Then when you have to
come to examine the witnesses in open court,
and to cross-examine them, and when that
sharp-eyed, and sharp-witted fellow, lawyer
Birch interrogates them and comments upon
the evidence there will be nothing left of the
matter for crimination. I think he had better
give it up for a bad job; and if I were in your
place, Mr. Jenkin, I would tell him so, too."
## p. 227 (#235) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 227
"Ay, and if you were in my. place, Mr.
Squirt,'' responded Jenkin, and were to tell my
Lord Fitzgeorge any thing of the kind, you
would not be in my place long;he must have
his own way, and, what is more, he will too.
He is just like his father for that; nothing can
put him out of his way, when he has once taken
a thing into his head."
"Well, then, give up your place at once."
"Give up my place, indeed! Yes, yes, that
is very easily said; but saying and doing are
two different things. Such places are not to be
easily met with now-a-days."
The next morning Mr. Jenkin and the apo-
thecary waited upon Lord Fitzgeorge, and
stated that they had looked over the papers,
and thought that there was not enough to cri-
minate her ladyship, so as to answer any good
purpose; that is, not so as to obtain a divorce.
His lordship then flew into a violent passion,
and said that they were a couple of fools, and
could not tell black from white, nor right from
wrong.
## p. 228 (#236) ############################################
228 FITZGEORGE.
"Well, but, my lord," said Jenkin, very re-
spectfully, " will you have the kindness to hear
me?"
"I have heard you," replied Fitzgeorge,
more than I like already. I will hear no more
unless it is that I have some chance of getting
lid of my wife."
"My lord," replied Jenkin, "all that I say is
for your good. I am sure your lordship would
be exceedingly sorry indeed, to bring the
matter before a court, and not be able to esta-
blish the charge, nor to get a verdict."
Thereupon Fitzgeorge, who had ^before been
violently angry, and almost furious, changed his
tone, and laughed outright, saying, "Not able
to get a verdict! Why, Mr. Jenkin, you are
absolutely a greater noodle than I took you to
be. In the court where this must be tried, you
know, I can get any verdict I please! most of
the jury are my dependants, and if I chose to
prosecute you there for witchcraft, they would
bring you in guilty, though they all know that
you are no conjuror."
## p. 229 (#237) ############################################
FITZGEORGE. 229
Mr. Jenkin and the apothecary laughed;
for when great men are witty, little men should
always laugh.
"That certainly is a great point gained, as
you say, my lord, that making sure of the jury.
Only you know Mr. Jenkin and myself looked
over the evidence, principally with a view to
the impression it might produce on a common
honest jury."
"Come," said Fitzgeorge, rather jocularly
again, "let me hear no reflections on the ho-
nesty of my friends. If I cannot say much for
their honesty, they are very valuable for their
fidelitythey are as faithful as so many spa-
niels. They would give any verdict I chose to
ask them, and would contradict it the next mi-
nute, if I requested it; but as it is necessary for
them to have some little reputation with the
public, I should not like to run them too hard."
"All that is very true, my lord, as your
lordship says," replied Mr. Jenkin; "and be-
fore a jury that so well understands your lord-

ship's wishes, and that is so considerate of your
lordship's feelings, it is possible that such evi-
dence may do. It is just enough to make it
possible that her ladyship is guilty, and it may
vindicate the verdict to the world."
"That," replied Fitzgeorge, "is all I want."
On this the trial was institutedthrough the
filth and perjury of which, we hope our readers
have no wish or inclination to be dragged. One
anecdote, however, and one only, as character-
istic of the nature of the evidence, is worthy of
record. On the bench with the judge sat se-
veral magistrates, who occasionally asked the
witnesses questionssome with a view of help-
ing, others with a view of opposing, Fitzgeorge.
There was present also among the spectators of
the trial on the bench, a smart young gentle-
man, who was related to one of the magistrates.
When one of the witnesses had been cross-
examined by Mr. Birch, and had in his cross-
examination shuffled and prevaricated most
abominably, this young gentleman slipped be-

hind the judge, and pulling him by the gown
said in a whisper, "I should like to ask that
witness one question." The judge smiled, and
said, "What question, my boy? Shall I ask
it?"" Do, sir, if you please," said the lad;
"ask him how he feels after telling so many
lies."" Go along, you young rogue," said
the judge.
This judge summed up most unfavourably
against the accused, and obtained from the
pliable jury a verdict for Fitzgeorge. But such
was the indignation expressed in the court among
the spectators of the trial, that the judge did
not dare to record the verdict, and Louisa
triumphed.

CHAPTER THE LAST.
CONCLUSION OF THE SCENE.
Was it a drawn battle between Fitzgeorge
and his wife? Or which had conquered? If
the victory was on the side of Fitzgeorge, it had
cost an immense treasure in money, and a most
marvellously great mass of perjury, or of that
kind of swearing which looks vastly like it. We
have had too great a regard for the delicacy of
our readers to lead them through the abomina-
tion, but by the conclusion to which it has
come, they may form some idea of the nature
and credibility of the evidence, seeing that those
of the jury who gave a verdict of guilty were

such as Fitzgeorge himself could calculate upon,
and who were ready to give a verdict of guilty
against Mr. Jenkin himself for the crime of
witchcraft, if Fitzgeorge had been disposed to
accuse him of it, even though they all knew
that he was no conjuror.
If, on the other hand, the victory was on the
side of the persecuted wife, it was a victory of
moral sentiment against wealth, power and in-
fluence. The accused, as we have already
stated, knew not the charges that were brought
against her, nor the witnesses that were to be
brought forward to substantiate the charges.
Therefore it was not in her power to give to her
counsel such instructions as might enable them
to meet and rebut the evidence. The reason,
indeed, why the names of the intended witnesses
were not given, was exquisitely sound and good,
because they were of such character that their
whole testimony would not be worth a straw, if
they could have been properly exhibited to the
jury-

On which ever side the victory was, it is cer-
tain that Fitzgeorge had no real pleasure or
satisfaction in the close of the conflict. And
his wife, even though he felt it to be out of his
power to prosecute her any more, it was not out
of his power, nor out of his inclination, to per-
secute her still, and that most unrelentingly.
Seeing that no sentence of divorce could be de
cently passed with a verdict acquired by such
means, and effected by such tools, it remained
to be determined whether she should receive or
not the respect and privileges due to her rank
as Lady Fitzgeorge. In claiming these, or
abstaining from the claim, was a great and in-
surmountable difficulty. If she should claim
them, she knew so well the temper of her hus-
band as to be well aware that the claim could
not be allowed, so far as he had it in his power
to withhold it. And should she relinquish her
claims, she knew that the censorious ones who
were, by the various motives of sycophancy to
her husband, or general malignity of spirit, her

u
enemies and calumniators, would attribute her
abstinence to a consciousness of guilt. What-
ever sacrifices, therefore, it might cost, her lady-
ship now resolved to put in her claim for all the
honours and immunities of her rank; and as
she was not proceeded against as guilty, she
demanded to be treated as innocent.
As she foresaw, so it came to pass. Fresh
indignities were heaped upon her, and the veriest
of the rabble were countenanced in heaping up
calumny against her. If ever a time should
arrive in the lapse of ages, and in the revolu-
tions of human affairs, in which men shall think
calmly and dispassionately, and think for them-
selves, and not be any longer led to think in
groups, or take the echo of another's word to be
the result of their own thoughts, they will marvel
much at the facility with which people of the
present day are led by fashion, and are taught
to think by proxy. Fitzgeorge had from his
very early youth aspired, and that most success-
fully, to be a leader of fashion. While his father

was living there were, in some measure, two fa-
shionable partiesthe one with the father and the
other with the son. The fashionable party which
belonged and adhered to the father, consisted
principally of those who facetiously called them-
selves the wise and good; this party, by the
way, seems going out of fashion now, for it
seems that their wisdom is not good for much.
But the fashionable party that adhered to the
son, consisted of that perfumed and tailor-built
tribe called Dandies; animals that require as
much time to dress themselves as a tailor does
to make them a suit of clothes; creatures whose
minds are incapable of any thing above milli-
nery, who have no eyes or thoughts for any
thing but life's outsidepuppies whose inso-
lence and insignificance is so nearly matched,
that nobody can say which is the greatest.
But when the old Lord Fitzgeorge was no longer
in active and public life, and especially after the
death of his lordship, the two parties united in
sycophantic adherence to his successor; the3e,

therefore, by virtue of their wisdom and good-
ness, and dandyism, formed a numerous and
malignant band against the discarded and ca-
lumniated wife of Fitzgeorge. Such of them as
had wit enough for the purpose, were pleased
to exercise their wit and buffoonery against the
injured lady; and these parasites, who remorse-
lessly and falsely vituperated her whom Fitz-
george had from caprice rejectedfor he had
rejected before he had accused her, or procured
her accusation;these soulless wits were ready
to lift their pens and voices in praise of any, of
whatever character, or want of character, Fitz-
george would honour with his notice. They
could calumniate a discarded wife, and they could
do honour to a favoured -. All this was
from the mere power of fashionfrom the dread
which vulgar dolts had to be thought vulgar.
They who affected to be horror-struck at the least
word of disrespect breathed against persons in
high life, and bearing titles which mean nothing,
could calumniate a relative of Fitzgeorge, be-

cause they thought such calumny would be
agreeable to him.
Against mockery, insult, cruelty, treachery,
brutality, Lady Louisa had to struggle; but
not long could the struggle last. Life never
had much to promise her, and she looked to its
close with hope and composure;  under the
pressure of her sorrows and persecutions, she
sunk into the grave.
Fitzgeorge was now at liberty. Was he
happy? Far from it. The pleasures which he
had promised himself from the commencement
of life and from the first formation of his hopes,
were pleasures which required for their enjoy-
ment youth, health, vigour, and alacrity. These
now no longer remained to him. Painful as
might be the thought, it was not in the power
-of all his flatterers to conceal from him the sad
truth that he was no longer young. He had
been so anxious for the enjoyments of life, and
so fearful of age interfering with them, that he
had watched the departure of every year with

studious care, grieving as the day came round
that another year was gone. Cicero's Treatise
on Old Age, was not able any more to console
him under the pressure of age, than it had been
to hold him up against the apprehension of it.
Some men are miserable, thinking to themselves
that they want nothing but moneybut they
are more miserable who want every thing but
money. In this condition was Fitzgeorge. The
duns of his early days were not about him,
the narrowness of means which had troubled
him all through life did not trouble him now.
He had opportunity and power to please, and
to indulge himself in architectural freaks and
extravagances; he could command the most
sumptuous furniture and the rarest decorations,
and he could have some pleasure in gazing on
them. He could command the talents of artists
of every description, and they could obey the
suggestions of his fancy. But they could not
do every thing. The skilful limner could draw
a flattering likeness of his tottering frame,

feeble beneath other pressure than that of
years; but no skill of any artist could improve
the original. Drugs, discipline, and diet might
be prescribed and administered, and they might
do something for the imagination, but they could .
not recal departed time or decayed strength.
Youth comes not at the call of pills, and the
strength that has been wasted in riot and dis-
sipation, is not to be restored by potions and
drugs. The leaves that fall from the tree must
perish in the dust on which they fall, no hand
can replace them to flourish on the tree again
in greenness and vigour. Money, therefore,
could not purchase for Fitzgeorge the health
and youth which had departed from him.
Nor could money buy him friends. Adula-
tors and sycophants, it could and did purchase;
he was never at a loss for flatterers, but he had
sense enough to know that they were flatterers.
He felt that the sincerity of pure respect, the
heartiness of generous friendship, the cordiality
of sympathetic affection were not his and never

FJTZGEOKGE. 241
could be his. He felt no lack of homage or
attentionattention most respectful, indeed, in
its outward form, but it was all form and all
external. If the footstep of the attendants fell
lightly on the carpeted floors, if the officious-
ness of the valet anticipated every wish and
wantif all the looks that surrounded him were
modelled into the gracefulness of awful reve-
rence, he knew that all this was purchased,
that there was no other consideration in the
light step and the officious attentions and the
reverential looks, than the consideration of a
good place and of easy services well paid.
Fitzgeorge had never been indifferent to the
pleasures of the table, and now he had the
means of that luxury in as much abundance as
ever and more than ever, but the wines had
lost their flavour and the condiments their
relishthere was still a tastebut no gusto, no
hearty relishthe general edge of appetite was

had little left of them but the name. The same
error was cleaving to him in his latter days as
had been his bane in the season of youth; that
is, he expected to enjoy the pleasures of rest
without undergoing the toils of business. He
left the management of all things to his steward,
and as an excuse, he pleaded the fatigue of
attending to business. The fact is, that he was
fatigued with rest, wearied with indolenceif
he had undergone more fatigue, he would have
suffered less fatigue. To rest from labour is
possible, but to rest from rest is impossible.
He whose business is work, may have rest and
leisure, and relaxation; but when relaxation
becomes a toil, there can be no relaxation from
that toil.
Fitzgeorge was now in that state of mind or
body, or both, which by means of the happy
uncertainty of our language, may be expressed
in the parodox of saying that he had lost his
appetite for pleasure, but not his desire. His
relish was gone. The vigour of his faculties
I

FITZGEORGE. 243
was abated or attenuated to a mere nothing, or
his fastidiousness was so great that nothing
could please him. And now he saw, that in-
stead of not having had pleasure enough in life,
he had had too much; he had pampered the
body, and had neglected the mind; he had been
endeavouring to enjoy the life of the body, and
had neglected the life of the mind, the soul, the
intellect.
"I am come now," said he to himself, in the
last soliloquy that we shall record, "to that
period of life which, in spite of all my reluct-
ance, I must call old age. I am now at a point
from which I may look back, and what do I see
in the retrospect? I see gorgeous festivalsI
remember, but faintly, their noise and clamour,
and pride and emptiness. I see much that was
anticipated with delight, but which was very
little enjoyed. I have been all my life long
looking forward to to-morrow, and now I have
nothing to do but to look back to yesterday.
Surely I have been disappointed in life, and.

perhaps every body is. It is some little conso-
lation to think it possible that others may have
made as great mistakes as I have made myself.
I have certainly made one discovery, and that
a valuable one, but not to myself. I have dis-
covered that wealth and rank, and high esteem,
are not able to make us happy in spite of our-
selves. For wealth may become by a careless
extravagance the means of a poverty more gall-
ing than that which is felt by the ragged wan-
derer to whom a dry crust is a luxury, and a
heap of straw is a bed of down;and rank may
be degraded by folly, and high esteem may be
lost in the reckless attention to mere sensual
pursuits. I have had friendssome, that in
my younger days would, I now believe, have
really served and assisted me. How much more
I value them now than I did then. I am now
rid of my wife! Oh, with what eagerness of
wish and desire almost amounting to a prayer,
have I looked forward to that bliss of total,
effectual, separation. That is now accom

plished. And am I now happier? Am I so
much happier as I anticipated that I should
be? Nono. What can be the meaning of
that word happiness which men so commonly
and so fluently use? Is it not the fulfilment of
their wishes and hopes? And have not all
mine been fulfilled? When I was in my mino-
rity I wished to come of ageI have had that
wish. When I was embarrassed and surrounded
with duns, I wished to get rid of my embarrass-
ments and to be relieved from the annoyance of
dunsI have had that wish. When I was
married, I wished to get rid of my wifeI have
had that wish. When I was an heir, I wished
to come into full possessionI have had that
wish. What have I more to wish than to have
life over againand what would that be but to
have all my wishes over again V
So Fitzgeorge at length, though no Solomon,
came to the same conclusion that Solomon did
" Vanity of vanitiesall is vanity."
THE END.
