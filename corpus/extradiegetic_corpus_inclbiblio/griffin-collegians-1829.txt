CHAPTER I.
How GARRyowen Rose, AND How IT FELL.
; HE little ruined outlet, which gives its name to
*; one of the most popular national songs of Erin, is
situate on the acclivity of a hill near the city of
Limerick, commanding a not unpleasant view of that fine
old town, with the noble stream that washes its battered
towers, and a richly cultivated surrounding country. Tradi-
tion has preserved the occasion of its celebrity, and the
origin of its name, which appears to be compounded of
two Irish words signifying "Owen's garden." A person
so-called was the owner, about half-a-century since, of a
cottage and plot of ground on this spot, which, from its
contiguity to the town, became a favourite holiday resort
with the young citizens of both sexesa lounge presenting
accommodations somewhat similar to those which are
offered to the London mechanic by the Battersea tea-
gardens. Owen's garden was the general rendezvous for
those who sought for simple amusement or for dissipa-
tion. The old people drank together under the shades
of trees, the young played at ball, goal, or other athletic
exercises on the green; while a few, lingering by the
hedge-rows with their fair acquaintances, cheated the time
with sounds less boisterous, indeed, but yet possessing
their fascination also.
The festivities of our fathers, however, were frequently
distinguished by so fierce a character of mirth, that, for
any difference in the result of their convivial meetings,

they might as well have been pitched encounters. Owen's
garden was soon as famous for scenes of strife, as it was
for mirth and humour; and broken heads became a
staple article of manufacture in the neighbourhood.
This new feature in the diversions of the place was
encouraged by a number of young persons of rank some-
what superior to that of the usual frequenters of the
garden. They were the sons of the more respectable
citizens, the merchants and wholesale traders of the city,
just turned loose from school, with a greater supply of
animal spirit than they had wisdom to govern. These
young gentlemen, being fond of wit, amused themselves
by forming parties at night, to wring the heads off all the
geese, and the knockers off all the hall-doors in the
neighbourhood. They sometimes suffered their genius to
soar as high as the breaking a lamp, and even the demoli-
tion of a watchman; but perhaps this species of joking
was found a little too serious to be repeated over frequently,
for few achievements of so daring a violence are found
amongst their records. They were obliged to content
themselves with the less ambitious distinction of destroy-
ing the knockers and store-locks, annoying the peaceable
inmates of the neighbouring houses with long-continued
assaults on the front doors, terrifying the quiet passengers
with every species of insult and provocation, and indulg-
ing their fratricidal propensities against all the geese in
Garryowen.
The fame of the "Garryowen boys" soon spread far
and wide. Their deeds were celebrated by some in-
glorious minstrel of the day, in that air which has since
resounded over every quarter of the world, and even dis-
puted the palm of national popularity with "Patrick's
day." A string of jolly verses were appended to the tune,
which soon enjoyed a notoriety similar to that of the
famous "Lilliburlero, bullum-a-la," which sung King
James out of his three kingdoms. The name of Garry-
owen was as well known as that of the Irish Numantium,
Limerick itself, and Owen's little garden became almost
a synonym for Ireland.
But that principle of existence which assigns to the life

of man its periods of youth, maturity, and decay, has its
analogy in the fate of villages, as in that of empires.
Assyria fell, and so did Garryowen I Rome had its de-
cline, and Garryowen was not immortall Both are now
an idle sound, with nothing but the recollections of old
tradition to invest them with an interest. The still
notorious suburb is little better than a heap of rubbish,
where a number of smoked and mouldering walls, stand-
ing out from the masses of stone and mortar, indicate
the position of a once populous row of dwelling-houses
A few roofs yet remain unshaken, under which some
impoverished families endeavour to work out a wretched
subsistence, by maintaining a species of huxter trade, by
cobbling old shoes, and manufacturing ropes. A small
rookery wearies the ears of the inhabitants at one end of
the outlet, and a rope-walk, which extends along the
adjacent slope of Gallows Green (so called for certain
reasons), brings to the mind of the conscious spectator,
associations that are not calculated to enliven the pro-
spect. Neither is he thrown into a more jocular frame of
mind, as he picks his steps over the insulated paving-
stones that appear amid the green slough with which the
street is deluged, and encounters, at the other end, an
alley of coffin-makers' shops, with a fever hospital on one
side, and a churchyard on the other. A person who was
bent on a journey to the other world could not desire a
more expeditious outfit than Garryowen could now afford
him, nor a more commodious choice of conveyance from
the machine on the slope above glanced at, to the pest-
house at the farther end.
But it is ill talking lightly on a serious subject. The
days of Garryowen are gone, like those of ancient Erin;
and the feats of her once formidable heroes are nothing
more than a winter's evening tale. Owen is in his grave,
and his garden looks dreary as a ruined churchyard. The
greater number of his merry customers have followed him
to a narrow play-ground, which, though not less crowded,
affords less room for fun, and less opportunity for con-
tention. The worm is there the revellerthe owl whoops

best whiskey in Munster would not now "drive the cold
out of their hearts"and the withered old sexton is
able to knock the bravest of them over the pate with im-
punity. A few, perhaps, may still remain to look back
with a fond shame to the scene of their early follies,
and to smile at the page in which those follies are
recorded.
Still, however, there is something to keep the memory
alive of those unruly days, and to preserve the name of
Garryowen from utter extinction. The annual fair which
is held on the spot presents a spectacle of gaiety and
uproar which might rival its most boisterous days; and
strangers still inquire for the place with a curiosity which
its appearance seldom fails to disappoint. Our national
lyrist has immortalized the air by adapting to it one of
the liveliest of his melodiesthe adventures of which it
was once the scene constitute a fund of standing joke and
anecdote, which are not neglected by the neighbouring
story-tellersand a rough voice may still occasionally be
heard by the traveller who passes near its ruined dwell-
ings at evening, to chant a stanza of the chorus which
was once in the mouth of every individual in the
kingdom:-
""Tis there we'll drink the nut-brown ale,
An' pay the reck'nin' on the nail;
No man or debt shall go to jail
From Garryowen na gloria."

CHAPTER II.
How EILY O'CONNOR PUzzled ALL THE INHABITANTS OF
GARRYOWEN.
BUT while Owen lived, and while his garden flourished,
he and his neighbours were as merry together, as if death
could never reach the one, nor desolation waste the other.
Among those frequenters of his little retreat, whom he
distinguished with an especial favour and attention, the

foremost was the handsome daughter of an old man who
conducted the business of a rope-walk in his neighbour-
hood, and who was accustomed on a fine Saturday evening
to sit under the shade of a yellow osier that stood by his
door, and discourse of the politics of the dayof Lord
Halifax's administrationof the promising young patriot,
Mr. Henry Grattanand of the famous Catholic con-
cession of 1773. Owen, like all Irishmen, even of the
humblest rank, was an acute critic of female proportions,
and although time had blown away the thatching from
his head, and by far the greater portion of blood that
remained in his frame had colonized about his nose, yet
the manner in which he held forth on the praises of his
old friend's daughter was such as put to shame her
younger and less eloquent admirers. It is true, indeed,
that the origin of the suburban beauty was one which, in
a troubled country like Ireland, had little of agreeable
association to recommend it; but few even of those to
whom twisted hemp was an object of secret terror, could
look on the exquisitely beautiful face of Eily O'Connor,
and remember that she was a rope-maker's daughter;
few could detect beneath the timid, hesitating, downcast
gentleness of manner, which shed an interest over all her
motions, the traces of a harsh and vulgar education. It
was true that she sometimes purloined a final letter from
the King's adjectives, and prolonged the utterance of a
vowel beyond the term of prosodaical orthodoxy, but the
tongue that did so seemed to move on silver wires, and
the lip on which the sound delayed,
"long murmuring, loth to part,"
imparted to its own accents an association of sweetnss
and grace, that made the defect an additional allurement.
Her education in the outskirts of the city had not im-
paired the natural tenderness of her character; for her
father, who, all rude as he was, knew how to value his
daughter's softness of mind, endeavoured to foster it by
every indulgence in his power. Her uncle, too, who was
now a country parish priest, was well qualified to draw
forth any natural talent with which she had been originally
## p. 10 (#14) ##############################################

endowed. He had completed his theological education
in the famous university of Salamanca, where he was
distinguished as a youth of much quietness of temper and
literary application, rather than as one of those furious
gesticulators, those "figures Hibernoises," amongst whom
Gil Blas, in his fit of logical lunacy, could meet his only
equals. At his little lodging, while he was yet a curate
at St. John's, Eily O'Connor was accustomed to spend a
considerable portion of her time, and in return for her
kindness in presiding at his simple tea-table, Father
Edward undertook to bestow a degree of attention on her
education, which rendered her in a little time as superior
in knowledge as she was in beauty to her female associates.
She was remarked likewise at this time, as a little devotee,
very regular in her attendance at chapel, constant in all
the observances of her religion, and grave in her attire
and discourse. On the coldest and dreariest morning in
winter, she might be seen gliding along by the unopened
shop windows to the nearest chapel, where she was accus-
tomed to hear an early Mass, and return in time to set
everything in order for her father's breakfast. During the
day, she superintended his household affairs, while he
was employed upon the adjacent rope-walk; and, in the
evening, she usually slipped on her bonnet, and went
across the street to Father Edward's, where she chatted
away until tea was over; if he happened to be engaged in
reading his daily office, she amused herself with a volume
of moral entertainment, such as Rasselas, Prince of
Abyssinia, or Mr. Addison's Spectator, until he was at
leisure to hear her lessons. An attachment of the purest
and tenderest nature was the consequence of those mutual
attentions between the uncle and niece, and it might be
said that if the former loved her not as well, he knew and
valued her character still better than her father. Father
Edward, however, was appointed to a parish, and Eily
lost her instructor. It was for her a severe loss, and
most severe in reality when its effects upon her own
spirits began to wear away. For some months after his
departure, she continued to lead the same retired and
unobtrusive life, and no eye, Save that of a consummate

THE COLLEEN BAWN. I f
observer, could detect the slightest alteration in her senti-
ments, the least increase of toleration for the world and
worldly amusements. That change, however, had been
silently effected in her heart. She was now a woman
a lovely, intelligent, full-grown woman; and circumstances
obliged her to take a part in the little social circle which
moved around her. Her spirits were naturally light, and,
though long repressed, became readily assimilated to the
buoyant tone of the society in which she happened to be
placed. Her father,who, with a father's venial vanity, was
fond of showing his beautiful child among his neighbours,
took her with him to Owen's garden at a time when it
was unusually gay and crowded, and from that evening
might be dated the commencement of a decided and
visible change in the lovely Eily's character.
As gradual as the approach of a spring morning, was
the change from grave to gay in the costume of this
flower of the suburbs. It dawned at first in a handsome
bow-knot upon her head-dress, and ended in the full
noontide splendour of flowered muslins, silks, and sashes.
It was like the opening of the rose-bud, which gathers
around it the winged wooers of the summer meadow.
"Lads, as brisk as bees," came thronging in her train,
with proffers of "honourable love, and rites of marriage;"
and even among the youths of a higher rank, whom the
wild levity of Irish blood and high spirits sent to mingle
in the festivities of Owen's garden, a jealousy prevailed
respecting the favour of the rope-maker's handsome
daughter. It was no wonder that attentions paid by
individuals so much superior to her ordinary admirers,
should render Eily indifferent to the sighs of those
plebeian suitors. Dunat O'Leary, the hair-cutter, or
Foxy Dunat, as he was named in allusion to his red hair,
was cut to the heart by her utter coldness. Myles
Murphy, likewise, a good-natured farmer from Killarney
who travelled through the country selling Kerry ponies,
and claiming a relationship with every one he met,
claimed kindred in vain with Eily, for his claim was not
allowed. Lowry Looby, too, the servant of Mr. Daly,
a wealthy middleman who lived in the neighbourhood,

12 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
was suspected by many to entertain delusive hopes of
Eily O'Connor's favour; but this report was improbable
enough, for Lowry could not but know that he was a
very ugly man; and if he were as beautiful as Narcissus,
Mihil O'Connor would still have shut the door in his face
for being as poor as Timon. So that, though there was
no lack of admirers, the lovely Eily, like many celebrated
beauties in a higher rank, ran, after all, a fair chance of
becoming, what Lady Mary Montague has elegantly
termed, "a lay nun." Even as a book-worm, who will
pore over a single volume from morning till night, if
turned loose into a library, wanders from shelf to shelf,
bewildered amid a host of temptations, and unable to
make any selection until he is surprised by twilight, and
chagrined to find, that with so much happiness within his
grasp, he has spent, nevertheless, an unprofitable day.
But accident saved Eily from a destiny so deeply
dreaded and so often lamented as that above alluded to
a condition which people generally agree to look upon as
one of utter desolation, and which, notwithstanding, is
frequently a state of greater happiness than its opposite.
On the eve of the seventeenth of March, a day dis-
tinguished in the rope-maker's household, not only as the
festival of the national Saint, but as the birth-day of the
young mistress of the establishmenton this evening
Eily and her father were enjoying their customary relaxa-
tion at Owen's garden. The jolly proprietor was seated
as usual with his rope-twisting friend under the yellow
osier, while Myles Murphy, who had brought a number
of his wild ponies to be disposed of at the neighbouring
fairs, had taken his place at the end of the table, and was
endeavouring to insinuate a distant relationship between
the Owens of Kilteery, connexions of the person whom
he addressed, and the Murphys of Knockfodhra, con-
nexions of his own. A party of young men were playing
fives at a ball-alley on the other side of the green; and
another, more numerous, and graced with many female
figures, were capering away to the tune of the Fox
Hunter's Jig on the short grass. Some poor old women,
with baskets on their arms, were endeavouring to sell off

THE COLLEEN BAWN. I3
some Patrick's crosses for children, at the low rate of one
half-penny a piece, gilding, paint, and all. Others,
fatigued with exertion, were walking under the still leaf-
less trees, some with their hats, some with their coats off,
jesting, laughing, and chatting familiarly with their female
acquaintances.
Mihil O'Connor, happening to see Lowry Looby
among the promenaders, glancing now and then at the
dance and whistling Patrick's Day, requested him to call
his daughter out of the group, and tell her that he was
waiting for her to go home. Lowry went, and returned
to say, that Eily was dancing with a strange young gentle-
man in a boating dress, and that he would not let her go.
until she had finished the slip jig.
It continued a sufficient time to tire the old man's.
patience. When Eily did at last make her appearance,
he observed there was a flush of mingled weariness and
pleasure on her cheek, which showed that the delay was
not quite in opposition to her own inclinations. This
circumstance might have tempted him to receive her
with a little displeasure, but that honest Owen at that
moment laid hold on both father and daughter, insisting
that they should come in and take supper with his wife
and himself.
This narrative of Eily's girlhood being merely introduc-
tory, we shall forbear to furnish any detail of the minor
incidents of the evening, or the quality of Mrs. Owen's
entertainment. They were very merry and happy; so
much so, that the Patrick's eve approached its termina-
tion before they rose to bid their host and hostess a good
night. Owen advised them to walk on rapidly, in order
to avoid the "Pathrick's boys," who would promenade the
streets after twelve, to welcome in the mighty festival
with music and uproar of all kinds. Some of the lads,
he said, "might be playing their tricks upon Miss Eily."
...The night was rather dark, and the dim glimmer of the
oil-lamps, which were suspended at long intervals over
the street doors, tended only in a very feeble degree to
qualify the gloom. Mihil 'Connor and his daughter
had already performed more than half their journey, and
## p. 14 (#18) ##############################################
14 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
were turning from a narrow lane at the head of Mungret
Street, when a loud and tumultuous sound broke with
sudden violence upon their hearing. It proceeded from
a multitude of people who were moving in confused and
noisy procession along the street. An ancient and still
honoured custom summons the youthful inhabitants of
the city on the night of this anniversary to celebrate the
approaching holiday of the patron saint and apostle of
the island, by promenading all the streets in succession,
playing national airs, and filling up the pauses in the
music with shouts of exultation. Such was the procession
which the two companions now beheld approaching.
The appearance which it presented was not altogether
destitute of interest and amusement. In the midst were
a band of musicians who played alternately, "Patrick's
Day," and "Garryowen," while a rabble of men and boys
pressed round them, thronging the whole breadth and a
considerable portion of the length of the street. The
men had got sprigs of shamrock in their hats, and several
carried in their hands lighted candles, protected from the
wasting night-blast by a simple lamp of whited brown
paper. The fickle and unequal light which those small
torches threw over the faces of the individuals who held
them, afforded a lively contrast to the prevailing darkness.
The crowd hurried forward, singing, playing, shouting,
laughing, and indulging, to its full extent, all the excite-
ment which was occasioned by the tumult and the motion.
Bedroom windows are thrown up as they passed, and the
half-dressed inmates thrust their heads into the night air
to gaze upon the mob of enthusiasts. All the respectable
persons who appeared in the streets as they advanced,
turned short into the neighbouring by-ways to avoid the
importunities which they would be likely to incur by a
contact with the multitude.
But it was too late for our party to adopt this precau-
tion. Before it had entered their minds, the procession
(if we may dignify it by a name so sounding) was nearer
to them than they were to any turn in the street, and the
appearance of flight, with a rabble of men, as with dogs,
is a provocation of pursuit. Of this they were aware;
## p. 15 (#19) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 15
and accordingly, instead of attempting a vain retreat,
they turned into a recess formed by one of the shop-
doors, and quietly awaited the passing away of this noisy
torrent. For some moments they were unnoticed; the
fellows who moved foremost being too busy in talking,
laughing, and shouting, to pay any attention to objects
not directly in their way. But they were no sooner
espied than the wags assailed them with that species of
wit which distinguishes the inhabitants of the back lanes
of a city, and forms the terror of all country visitors.
These expressions were lavished upon the rope-maker
and his daughter, until the former, who was as irritable
an old fellow as Irishmen generally are, was almost put
out of patience.
At length, a young man, observing the lamp shine for
a moment on Eily's handsome face, made a chirp with
his lips as he passed by, as if he had a mind to kiss her.
Not Papirius himself, when vindicating his senatorial
dignity against the insulting Gaul, could be more prompt
in action than Mihil O'Connor. The young gentleman
received, in return for his affectionate greeting, a blow
over the temples which was worth five hundred kisses.
An uproar immediately commenced, which was likely to
end in some serious injury to the old man and his
daughter. A number of ferocious faces gathered round
them, uttering sounds of harsh rancour and defiance,
which Mihil met with equal loudness and energy.
Indeed, all that seemed to delay his fate, and hinder him
from sharing in the prostration of his victim, was the
conduct of Eily, who, flinging herself in bare-armed
beauty before her father, defended him for a time against
the upraised weapons of his assailants. No one would
incur the danger of harming, by an accidental blow, a
creature so young, so beautiful, and so affectionate.
They were at length rescued from this precarious con-
dition by the interposition of two young men, in the dress
of boatmen, who appeared to possess some influence with
the crowd, and who used it for the advantage of the suf-
ferers. Not satisfied with having brought them safely
out of all immediate danger, the taller of the two con-

ducted them to their door, saying little on the way, and
taking his leave as soon as they were once in perfect
safety. All that Mihil could learn from his appearance
was, that he was a gentleman, and very youngperhaps
not more than nineteen years of age. The old man
talked much and loudly in praise of his gallantry, but
Eily was altogether silent on the subject.
A few days after, Mihil O'Connor was at work upon
the rope-walk, going slowly backward in the sunshine,
with a little bundle of hemp between his knees, and sing-
ing "Maureen Thierna." A hunchbacked little fellow, in
a boatman's dress, came up, and saluting him in a sharp
city brogue, reminded the old rope-maker that he had
done him a service a few evenings before. Mihil pro-
fessed his acknowledgments, and with true Irish warmth
of heart, assured the little boatman that all he had in the
world was at his service. The hunchback, however, only
wanted a few ropes and blocks for his boat, and even for
those he was resolute in paying honourably. Neither did
he seem anxious to satisfy the curiosity of old Mihil with
respect to the name and quality of his companion; for he
was inexorable in maintaining that he was a turf-boat
man from Scagh, who had come up to town with him to
dispose of a cargo of fuel at Charlotte's Quay. Mihil
O'Connor referred him to his daughter for the ropes,
about which, he said, she could bargain as well as him-
self, and he was unable to leave his work until the rope
he had in hand should be finished. The little deformed,
no way displeased at this intelligence, went to find Eily
at the shop, where he spent a longer time than Mihil
thought necessary for his purpose.
From this time forward, the character of Eily O'Connor
seemed to have undergone a second change. Her
former gravity returned, but it did not reappear under
the same circumstances as before. In her days of reli-
gious retirement, it appeared only in her dress and in her
choice of amusements. Now, both her recreations and
her attire were much gayer than ever, so much so as
almost to approach a degree of dissipation, but her cheer.
* Little Mary Tierney.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 17
fulmess of mind was gone, and the sadness which had
settled on her heart, like a black reef under sunny waters,
was plainly visible through all her gaiety. Her father
was too much occupied in his eternal rope-twisting to take
particular notice of this change, and, besides, it is noto-
rious that one's constant companions are the last to
observe any alteration in one's manner or appearance.
One morning, when Mihil O'Connor left his room, he
was surprised to find that the breakfast table was not laid
as usual, and that his daughter was not in the house.
She made her appearance, however, while he was himself
making the necessary arrangements. They exchanged a
greeting somewhat colder on the one side, and more
embarrassed on the other, than was usual at the morning
meetings of the father and daughter. But when she told
him that she had been only to the chapel, the old man
was perfectly satisfied, for he knew that Eily would a-
readily think of telling a falsehood to the priest as she
would to her father. And when Mihil O'Connor heard
that people were at chapel, he generally concluded (pool
old man ) that it was only to pray they went there.
In the meantime Myles Murphy renewed his proposals
to Eily, and succeeded in gaining over the father to his
interests. The latter was annoyed at his daughter's
obstinate rejection of a fine fellow like Myles, with a very
comfortable property, and pressed her either to give con-
sent to the match, or a good reason for her refusal. But
this request, though reasonable, was not complied with;
and the rope-maker, though not so hot as Capulet, was
as much displeased at the contumacy of his daughter.
Eily, on her part, was so much afflicted at the anger of
her only parent, that it is probable her grief would have
made away with her if she had not prevented that catas-
trophe by making away with herself.
On the fair day of Garryowen, after sustaining a long
and distressing altercation with her father and her moun-
tain suitor, Eily O'Connor threw her blue cloak over her
shoulders, and walked into the air. She did not return
to dinner, and her father felt angry at what he thought a
token of resentful feeling. Night came, and she did not

make her appearance. The poor old man, in an agony of
terror, reproached himself for his vehemence, and spent
the whole night in recalling, with a feeling of remorse,
every intemperate word which he had used in the violence
of dispute. In the morning, more like a ghost than a
living being, he went from the house of one acquaintance
to another, to inquire after his child. No one, however,
had seen her, except Foxy Dunat, the hair-cutter, and he
had only caught a glimpse of her as she passed his door
on the previous evening. It was evident that she was not
to return. Her father was distracted. Her young ad-
mirers feared that she had got privately married, and run
away with some shabby fellow. Her female friends
insinuated that the case might be still worse, and some
pious old people shook their heads when the report reached
them, and said they knew what was likely to come of it,
when Eily O'Connor left off attending her daily Mass in
the morning, and went to the dance at Garryowen.

CHAPTER III.
HOW MR. DALY THE MIDDLEMAN SAT DOWN TO BREAK FAST.
THE DALYs (a very respectable family in middle life)
occupied, at the time of which we write, a handsome
cottage on the Shannon side, a few miles from the sub-
urban district above mentioned.
They had assembled, on the morning of Eily's dis-
appearance, a healthy and blooming household of all
sizes, in the principal sitting-room, for a purpose no less
important than that of despatching breakfast. It was a
favourable moment for any one who might be desirous of
sketching a family picture. The windows of the room,
which were thrown up for the purpose of admitting the
fresh morning air, opened upon a trim and sloping meadow,
that looked sunny and cheerful with the bright green after-
grass of the season. The broad and sheety river washed
## p. 19 (#23) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 19
the very margin of the little field, and bore upon its quiet
bosom (which was only ruffled by the circling eddies that
encountered the advancing tide) a variety of craft, such as
might be supposed to indicate the approach to a large
commercial city. Majestic vessels, floating idly on the
basined flood, with sails half furled, in keeping with the
languid beauty of the scenelighters, burthened to the
water's edge with bricks or sandlarge rafts of timber,
borne onward towards the neighbouring quays under the
guidance of a shipman's boat-hookpleasure-boats, with
gaudy pennons hanging at peak and topmastturf-boats,
With their unpicturesque and ungraceful lading, moving
sluggishly forward, while their black sails seemed gasping
for a breath to fill them; such were the incidents that
gave agentle animation to the prospect immediately before
the eyes of the cottage dwellers. On the farther side of
the river arose the Cratloe hills, shadowed in various
Places by a broken cloud, and rendered beautiful by the
chequered appearance of the ripening tillage, and the
Variety of hues that were observable along their wooded
sides. At intervals, the front of a handsome mansion,
brightened up in a passing gleam of sunshine, while the
Wreaths of blue smoke, ascending at various distances from
amongst the trees, tended to relieve the idea of extreme
Solitude which it would otherwise have presented.
The interior of the cottage was not less interesting to
contemplate than the landscape which lay before it. The
Principal breakfast-table (for there were two spread in the
room) Was placed before the window, the neat and snow-
White damask cloth covered with fare that spoke satisfac.
torily for the circumstances of the proprietor, and for the
housewifery of his helpmate. The former, a fair, pleasant-
faced old gentleman, in a huge buckled cravat and square
ted shoes, somewhat distrustful of the meagre beverage
which fumed out of Mrs. Daly's lofty and shining coffee-
pot, had taken his position before a cold ham and fowl
which decorated the lower end of the table. His lady, a
Courteous old personage, with a face no less fair and happy

nature and intelligence, did the honours of the board at the

farther end. On the opposite side, leaning over the back
of his chair with clasped hands, in an attitude which had a
mixture of abstraction and anxiety, sat Mr. Kyrle Daly,
the first pledge of connubial affection that was born to this
comely pair. He was a young man already initiated in
the rudiments of the legal profession; of a handsome figure,
and in mannerbut something now pressed upon his
spirits, which rendered this an unfavourable occasion for
describing him.
A second table was laid in a more retired portion of the
room, for the accommodation of the younger part of the
family. Several well burnished goblets, or porringers, of
thick milk flanked the sides of this board, while a large
dish of smooth-coated potatoes reeked up in the centre.
A number of blooming boys and girls, between the ages of
four and twelve, were seated at this simple repast, eating
and drinking away with all the happy eagerness of youth-
ful appetite. Not, however, that this employment occupied
their exclusive attention, for the prattle which circulated
round the table frequently became so boisterous as to
drown the conversation of the older people, and to call
forth the angry rebuke of the master of the family.
The furniture of the apartment was in accordance with
the appearance and manners of its inhabitants. The floor
was handsomely carpeted, a lofty green fender fortified the
fireplace, and supplied Mr. Daly in his facetious moments
with occasions for the frequent repetition of a favourite
conundrum"Why is that fender like Westminster
Abbey?"a problem with which he never failed to try
the wit of any stranger who happened to spend a night
beneath his roof. The wainscoted walls were ornamented
with several of the popular prints of the day, such as
Hogarth's Roast Beef, Prince Eugene, Schomberg at the
Boyne, Mr. Betterton playing Cato in all the glory of
"Full wig, flower'd gown, and lacker'd chair;"
of the royal Mandane, in the person of Mrs. Mountain,
strutting among the arbours of her Persian palace in a
lofty tte and hooped petticoat. There were also some
family drawings done by Mrs. Daly in her school-days,

3f which we feel no inclination to say more than that
they were prettily framed. In justice to the fair artist, it
should also be mentioned that, contrary to the estab-
lished practice, her sketches were never retouched by
the hand of her master, a fact which Mr. Daly was fond
of insinuating, and which no one who saw the pictures
was tempted to call in question. A small book-case,
with the edges of the shelves handsomely gilded, was
suspended in one corner of the room, and, on examina-
tion, might be found to contain a considerable number of
works on Irish history, for which study Mr. Daly had a
national predilection, a circumstance much deplored by
all the impatient listeners in his neighbourhood, and
(some people hinted) in his own household; some re-
ligious books, and a few volumes on cookery and farming.
The space over the lofty chimney-piece was assigned
to some ornaments of a more startling description. A
gun rack, on which were suspended a long-shore gun, a
brass-barrelled blunderbuss, a cutlass, and case of horse
pistols, manifested Mr. Daly's determination to maintain,
if necessary, by force of arms, his claim to the fair posses-
Sions which his honest industry had acquired.
"Kyrle," said Mr. Daly, putting his fork into a breast
of cold goose, and looking at his son, "you had better
lt me put a little goose (with an emphasis) on your plate.
You know you are going a-wooing to-day."
The young gentleman appeared not to hear him. Mrs.
Daly, who understood more intimately the nature of her
$on's reflections, deprecated, by a significant look at her
husband, the continuance of any raillery upon so delicate
a subject.
... Kyrle, some coffee?" said the lady of the house, but
Without being more successful in awakening the attention
of the young gentleman.

a lover's absence Was not proof, "Do you hear what
your mother says?"
"I ask Pardon, sirI was absentIwhat were you
saying, mother?"
## p. 22 (#26) ##############################################
22 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"She was saying," continued Mr. Daly, with a smile,
* that you were manufacturing a fine speech for Anna
Chute, and that you were just meditating whether you
should deliver it on your knees, or out of brief, as if you
were addressing the Bench in the Four Courts."
"For shame, my dear ! Never mind him, Kyrle, I
said no such thing; I wonder how you can say that, my
dear, and the children listening."
"Pooh! the little angels are too busy and too inno-
cent to pay us any attention," said Mr. Daly, lowering
his voice, however. "But, speaking seriously, my boy,
you take this affair too deeply to heart; and whether it
be in our pursuit of wealth, or fame, or even in love
itself, an extreme solicitude to be successful is the surest
means of defeating its own object. Besides, it argues an
unquiet and unresigned condition. I have had a little
experience, you know, in affairs of this kind," he added,
smiling and glancing at his fair helpmate, who blushed
with the simplicity of a young girl.
"Ah, sir," said Kyrle, as he drew nearer to the break-
fast-table, with a magnanimous affectation of cheerfulness,
"I fear I have not so good a ground for hope as you
may have had. It is very easy, sir, for one to be resigned
to disappointment, when he is certain of success."
"Why, I was not bidden to despair, indeed," said
Mr. Daly, extending his hand to his wife, while they
exchanged a quiet smile, which had in it an expression of
tenderness and of melancholy remembrance.
"I have, I believe, been more fortunate than more
deserving persons. I have never been vexed with useless
fears in my wooing days, nor with vain regrets when
those days were ended. I do not know, my dear lad,
what hopes you have formed, or what prospects you may
have shaped out of the future, but I will not wish you a
better fortune, than that you may as nearly approach to
their accomplishment as I have done, and that Time may
deal as fairly with you as he has done with your father."
After saying this, Mr. Daly leaned forward on the table,
with his temple supported by one finger, and glanced
alternately from his children to his wife, while he

sang in a low tone the following verse of a popular
Song:
"How should I love the pretty creatures,
While round my knees they fondly clung!
To see them look their mother's features,
To hear them lisp their mother's tongue.
And when with envy Time transported,
Shall think to robus of our joys,
You'll in your girls again be courted,
And I"
with a glance at Kyrle
"And I go wooing with the boys."
"And this," thought young Kyrle, in the affectionate
pause that ensued, "this is the question which I go to
decide upon this morningwhether my old age shall
resemble the picture which I see before me, or whether I
shall be doomed to creep into the winter of my life, a
lonely, selfish, cheerless, money-hunting old bachelor. Is
not this enough to make a little solicitude excusable, or
pardonable at least?"
"It is a long time now," resumed Mr. Daly, "since I
have had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Chute. She was
a very beautiful, but a very wild girl when I knew her.
Nothing has ever been more inexplicable to me than the
choice she made of a second husband. You never saw
Anne's stepfather, Tom Chute, or you would be equally
astonished. You saw him, my lovedid you not?"
Mrs. Daly laughed, and answered in the affirmative.
"It showed, indeed, a singular taste," said Mr. Daly.
"They tell a curious story, too, about the manner of their
courtship."
"What was that, sir?" asked Kyrle, who felt a strong
sympathetic interest in all stories connected with wooers
and wooing.
"I have it, I confess, upon questionable authority;
but you shall hear it, such as it is. Now, look at that
young thief!" he added, laughing, and directing Kyrle's
attention to one of the children, a chubby young fellow,
who, having deserted the potato-eating corps at the side-

table, was taking advantage of the deep interest excited
by the conversation, to make a sudden descent upon the
contents of the japanned bread-basket. Perceiving that
he was detected, the little fellow relaxed his fingers, and
drew back a little, glancing, from beneath his eye-lashes,
a half-dismayed and bashful look at the laughing counte-
nance of his parent.
"Charles is not well to-day," said the mother, in a
compassionate tone, cutting him a large wedge of her
best home-made bread, which the lad began to demolish
with a degree of rapidity that scarcely corroborated the
assertion.
"But the story, sir?" said Kyrle.
"But the story. Well, little Tom Chute (he might
have been better called little Tom-tit, only that he was
not half so sprightly) was a very extraordinary man, for
although he was small and fat, he was not merry nor
talkative. You would have pitied him to see him walk-
ing about a ball-room, with ruffles that looked like small
buckles, and a queue half as long as himself, reminding
one of the handle of a pump when the sucker is up
with the most forlorn aspect in the world, as if he were
looking for a runaway wife. It was a curious anomaly in
his character, that although he(Silence, there. My
dear, will you speak to those children?)that although
he always looked miserable in the midst of society, he
really was so when out of it, as if the continued embarrass-
ment and mortification which he experienced were a
stimulus which he could not do without. Round, fat,
shy, awkward, and oily, as he was, however, he tumbled
his little rotund figure into the heart of Mrs. Trenchard,
who was at that time, though a widow, one of the leading
belles in Munster. A fair friend was the first to disclose
this rapturous secret to poor Tom, for he might have
known Mrs. Trenchard for a century without being able
to make it out himself. He did not know whether
he should be most frightened or pleased at the intel-
ligence; but certain it is that in the warmth of his first
feelings he made a tender of his hand to the lady, and
was instantly accepted. A dashing, handsome fellow,

The COLLEEN BAWN. 25
who had been rejected by her some time before, and who
knew Chute's irresolute temper, resolved to indemnify
himself for the mortification he had received, by throwing
some embarrassment in the way of the nuptials, and
effected it simply enough. It seems the lady's accom-
plishments were of a very general description, for besides
playing the harpsichord to admiration, she could manage
a horse with any hero of the County Club, and was
known to join their hunting parties, and even to ride a
steeplechase with eclat. Indeed it was generally admitted
that she possessed more spirit than might have answered
her purposes, or her husband's either. What fancy she
could have taken to Tom Chute, I cannot for my life con-
ceive. Well, this fellow met Tom going to her house one
evening, as spruce as a water-wagtail, with his queue pok-
ing up behind, like the flag-staff in the stern of a privateer.
They got into conversation about the widow. "Beautiful
creature, isn't she?' simpered Tom, blushing up to the
eyes, for it was another funny foible of Tom's to redden up
like a rose whenever there was any discourse of ladies,
even when nobody dreamed of anything like railllery.
'Beautiful creature, isn't she?" says Tom. "Beautiful, in-
deed," replied the other. And Tom stood on his toes,
threw out his right elbow, and took snuff. "And accom-
plished I think?" "And very sensible,' says the other.
'And lively,' says Tom. "And high spirited,' says the other,
'so, they say, her late husband found, poor man, to his
cost.' Tom dropped his jaw a little, and looked inquisi-
tive. But the other, who saw that his business was
done, declined all explanation, and hurried off with a
concluding remark, that "the lady was unquestionably a
capital whip.' Well, Tom got a sudden attack ofI
don't know what complaintwent home that night, and
sent an apology to the widow. He was not seen near
her house for a fortnight after, and a report reached her
ears that he had some notion of quitting the country.
But if he had, she put a stop to it. One morning when
Tom was looking over his books, he was startled by the
apparition of a tall woman in a riding dress, with a
horse-whip in one hand and a case of duelling pistols

in the other. She nodded to Tom. "I understand,'
said she"
At this moment a potato-peel, flung from the side-table,
whisked past Mr. Daly's nose, and with happier aim,
Eghted on that of Prince Eugene in the print before
mentioned. The venerable but too little venerated story-
teller, who had been for the last few minutes endeavour-
ing to raise his voice so as to make it audible above the
increasing uproar of the young people, now turned round
at this unparalleled and violent aggression, and con-
fronted the daring group in awful silence. Satisfied,
however, with the sudden hush of terror which this action
occasioned, and willing to reserve the burst of wrath for
a future transgression, he turned again in silence, and
directing the servant girl who was in the room, to take
the potato-peel off Prince Eugene's nose, he resumed the
thread of his narrative.
"'I understand," said Mrs. Trenchardfor it was no
other than the widow'that you intend leaving Ireland P'
Tom stammered and hesitated. "If my brother were
living," continued the lady, "he would horsewhip you; but
although he is not, Hetty Trenchard is able to fight her
own way. Come, sir, my carriage is at the door below;
either step into it with me this minute, or take one of
these pistols, and stand at the other end of the room.'
Well, Tom looked as like a fool as any man in Ireland.
He wouldn't fight, and he wouldn't be horsewhipped;
so the business ended in his going into the carriage, and
marrying the lady. Some persons, indeed, insinuated
that Tom was observed in the course of the day to chafe
his shoulders two or three times with an expression of
pain, as if his change of condition had been the result of
a still harsher mode of reasoning than I have mentioned;
but this part of the story is without foundation."
"What a bold creature 1" said the gentle Mrs. Daly.
"And is it possible, sir," asked Kyrle, "that this
Amazon is the kind old lady whom Anne Chute attends
with so much affection and tenderness in her infirmity?"
"Ah, ha! Kyrle, I see the nature of the bolt that has
wounded you, and I like you the better for it, my boy.
## p. 27 (#31) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 27
A good face is a pippin that grows on every hedge; but
a good heart, that is to say, a well regulated one, is the
apple of the Hesperides, worth even the risk of ease and
life itself."
Kyrle assented to this sagacious aphorism with a deep
sigh.
"Are the Cregans and they on terms now?" asked
Mrs. Daly.
"As much on terms as two families of such opposite
habits can be. The Chutes invite the Cregans to a
family dinner once or twice in the year, and the Cregans
ask the Chutes to their Killarney cottage, both of which
invitations are taken as French compliments, and are never
accepted. Cregan himself hates going to Castle Chute,
because he has nobody there to make jovial the night
with him, and young Hardress (your friend, Kyrle), is too
wild a lad to confine himself to mere drawing-room
society. Apropos talk of'tis a vulgar proverb, and
let it pass; but there goes his trim pleasure boat, the
Nora Creina, flying down the river, and there sits the
youth himself, tiller in hand as usual. Patcy, bring me
the telescope; I think I see a female dress on board."
The telescope was brought and adjusted to the proper
focus, while a dozen eager faces were collected about the
Small window, one over another, in the manner of those
groups in painting, called "Studies of Heads."
"That is he, indeed," continued Mr. Daly, resting the
glass on the window frame, and directing it towards the
object of their attention"there is no mistaking that
dark and handsome face, buried up as it is in the huge
oiled penthouse hat, and there is his hunch-backed boat-
man, Danny Mann, or Danny the Lord, as the people
Call him, since his misfortune, tending the foresheet in

whiskey, and reading-made-easys for her village counter,

Hardress."
"Like enough, like enough; it is just his way. Hillo!

A hoarse cry of "Bear awayhold up your hand 1"
was heard from the water, and reiterated with the addi-
tion of a few expletives, which those who know the energy
of a boatman's dialect will understand without our tran-
scribing them here. The pleasure boat, however, heedless
of those rough remonstrances, and apparently indisposed
to yield any portion of her way, still held her bowsprit
close to the wind, and sailed on, paying no more regard
to the peril of the plebeian craft, than a French aristocrat
of the vielle cour might be supposed to exhibit for that of
a sans culottes, about to be trodden down by his leaders
in the Rue St. Honore. The fishermen, with many
curses, backed water, and put about as rapidly as possible,
but without being able to avoid the shock of the Nora
Creina, who just touched their stern with sufficient force
to make the cot dart forward nearly an oar's length
through the water, and to lay the rowers sprawling on
their backs in the bottom. Fortunately the wind, which
had sprung up with the returning tide, was not suffi-
ciently strong to render the concussion more dangerous.
"Like his proud mother in every feature," said Mr.
Daly. "Is it not singular that while we were speaking
of the characters of the family, he could not pass our
window without furnishing us with a slight specimen of
his own P. See how stately the fellow turns round and
contemplates the confusion he has occasioned. There is
his mother's grandeur, blended with the hair-brained
wildness and idle spirit of his father."
"Hardress Cregan's is the handsomest boat in the
river," said Patcy, a stout, sunburnt boy"She'd beat
all the Galway hookers from this to Beale. What a nice
green hull !and white sails, and beautiful green colours

to be steering her."

Mr. Daly winked at his wife, and whispered her that
he had known rear-admirals come of smaller beginnings.
Mrs. Daly, with a little shudder, replied that she should
not wish to see him a rear-admiral, the navy was so
dangerous a service. Her husband, in order to soothe
her, observed that the danger was not very near at hand.
In the meantime, Hardress Cregan became a subject
of vehement debate at the side-table, to which the
juvenile squadron had returned. One fair-haired little
girl declared that she was his "pet." A second claimed
that distinction for herself.
"He gave me an O'Dell-cake when he was last here,"
said one.
"And me a stick of peppermint."
"He gave me a-" in a whisper"a kiss."
"And me two."
"He didn't."
"He did."

'But I was speaking," Mr. Daly resumed, "of the

*man smile. When their little Killarney property was

been prepared for his reception. It was a handsome
Gothic monument, occupying a retired corner of the
churchyard, and shadowed over by a fine old sycamore.
But Barny, who had no taste for the picturesque, was
deeply mortified at finding his piece of sepulchral finery
thrown so much into the shade. "What did I or my
people do," he said to the architect, 'that we should be
sent skulking into that corner? I paid my money, and
I'll have my own value for it.' The monument was
accordingly got rid of, and a sporting, flashy one erected
opposite the gateway, with the Cregan crest and shield
(in what herald's office it was picked up I cannot take
upon me to say) emblazoned upon the frontispiece.
Here, it is to be hoped, the aspiring Barnaby and his
posterity may one day rest in peace."
"That would be a vain hope, I fear," said Kyrle, "at
least so far as Mr. Cregan is concerned, if it were true,
as our peasantry believe, that the churchyard is fre-
quently made a scene of midnight mirth and revel, by
those whose earthly carousals are long concluded. But
what relationship is there between that family and Mrs.
Chute?"
"She is step-sister to Mrs. Cregan."
"Indeed so near?"
"Most veritable; therefore, look to it. They tell a
story " But the talkative old gentleman was inter-
rupted in his anecdotical career by the entrance of a new
actor on the scene.

attentive listeners as he numbered around him at this
moment |
The person who opened the door acted as a kind of
herdsman or out-door servant to the family, and was a
man of rather singular appearance. The nether parts of
his frame were of a size considerably out of proportion
with the trunk and head which they supported. His feet
Were broad and flat like those of a duck; his legs long
and clumsy, with knees and ankles like the knobs on one
of those grotesque walking sticks which were in fashion
among the fine gentlemen of our own day, some time
Since; his joints hung loosely like those of a pasteboard
Merry Andrew; his body was very small; his chest
narrow; and his head so diminutive as to be even too
little for his herring shoulders. It seemed as if nature,
like an extravagant projector, had laid the foundation of
* giant, but, running short of material as the structure
proceeded, had been compelled to terminate her undertak-
ing within the dimensions of a dwarf. So far was this
economy pursued, that the head, small as it was, was
Wry, scantily furnished with hair; and the nose, with
Which the face was garnished, might be compared for its
flatness to that of a young kid. "It looked," as the

*ns were likewise of a smallness which was much to be
admired, when contrasted with the hugeness of the lower
*mbers, and brought to mind the fore-paws of a
*garoo, or the fins of a seal, the latter similitude pre-

from his shoulders, and gave to view in front a waistcoat
of calfskin, with the hairy side outwards; a shirt, of a
texture almost as coarse as sail-cloth, made from the
refuse of flax, and a pair of corduroy nether garments,
with two bright new patches upon the knees. Grey
worsted stockings, with dog-skin brogues well paved in
the sole, and greased until they shone again, completed
the personal adornments of this unaspiring personage.
On the whole, his appearance might have brought to the
recollection of a modern beholder one of those architec-
tural edifices, so fashionable in our time, in which the
artist, with an admirable ambition, seeks to unite all that
is excellent in the Tuscan, Doric, Corinthian, and Ionic
order, in one coup d'ail.
The expression of the figure, though it varied with
circumstances, was for the most part thoughtful and
deliberative; the effect, in a great measure, of habitual
penury and dependence. At the time of Lord Halifax's
administration, Lowry Looby, then a very young man,
held a spot of ground in the neighbourhood of Limerick,
and was well to do in the world, but the scarcity which
prevailed in England at the time, and which occasioned
a sudden rise in the price of beer, butter, and other pro-
duce of grazing land in Ireland, threw all the agricul-
turists out of their little holdings, and occasioned a
general destitution, similar to that produced by the anti-
cottier system in the present day. Lowry was among
the sufferers. He was saved, however, from the neces-
sity of adopting one of the three ultimata of Irish misery
begging, enlisting, or emigratingby the kindness of
Mr. Daly, who took him into his service as a kind of
runner between his farms; an office for which Lowry,
by his long and muscular legs, and the lightness of the
body that encumbered them, was qualified in an eminent
degree. His excellent honesty, one of the characteristics
of his country, which he was known to possess, rendered
him a still more valuable acquisition to the family than
had been at first anticipated. He had, moreover, the
national talent for adroit flattery, a quality which made
him more acceptable to his patron than the latter would.

willingly admit, and every emulsion of this kind was
applied under the disguise of a simpleness, which gave it
a wonderful efficacy.
"Ha! Lowry" said Mr. Daly, "Well, have you made
your fortune since you have agreed with the postmaster?"
. Lowry put his hands behind his back, looked succes-
sively at the four corners of the room, then round the
Cornice, then cast his eyes down at his feet, turned up
the soles a little, and finally straightening his person,
*nd gazing on his master, replied, "To lose it I did,
sir, for a place."
"To lose what?"
"The place of postman, sir, through the country west-
wards. Sure there I was a gentleman for life if it wasn't
my luck."

sthreets P So I turned back."
"Turned back 1 for what?"
"Sure the world knows, masther, that it isn't lucky to
meet a red-haired woman and you going of a journey."
"And you never went for the mail-bags P"
"Faiks, I'm sure I didn't that day."
"Well, and the next morning P"
"The next morning, that's this morning, when I went,
I found they had engaged another boy in my place."
"And you lost the situation ?"
"For this turn, sir, anyway. 'Tis luck that does it all.
Sure I thought I was cock sure of it, an' I having the
post-masther's word. But, indeed, if I meet that free-
stone crathur again, I'll knock her red head against the
wall."
"Well, Lowry, this ought to show you the folly of
your superstition. If you had not minded that woman
when you met her, you might have had your situation
now."
"'Twas she was in fault still, begging your pardon,
sir," said Lowry, "for sure if I didn't meet her at all, this
wouldn't have happened me."
"Oh," said Mr. Daly, laughing, "I see you are well
provided against all argument. I have no more to say,
Lowry."
The man now walked slowly towards Kyrle, and bend-
ing down with a look of solemn importance, as if he had
some weighty intelligence to communicate, he said, "The
horse, sir, is ready this way, at the doore abroad."
"Very well, Lowry. I shall set out this instant."
Lowry raised himself erect again, turned slowly round,
and walked to the door, with his eyes on the ground
and his hand raised to his temple, as if endeavouring

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 35
to recollect something farther which he had intended to
Say.
"Lowry 1" said Mr. Daly, as the handle of the door
was turned a second time. Lowry looked round.
"Lowry, tell medid you see Eily O'Connor, the
r. daughter, at the fair of Garryowen yester-
ay 22
"Ah, you're welcome to your game, masther."
"'Pon my word, then, Eily is a very pretty girl, Lowry,
and I'm told the old father can give her something be-
sides her pretty face."
Lowry opened his huge mouth (we forgot to mention
that it was a huge one), and gave vent to a few explosions
of laughter which much more nearly resembled the braying
of an ass. "You are welcome to your game, masther,"
he repeated, "long life to your honour."
"But is it true, Lowry, as I have heard it insinuated,
'hat old Mihil O'Connor used, and still does, twist ropes
for the use of the county gaol 2"
Lowry closed his lips hard, while the blood rushed into
is face at this unworthy allegation. Treating it, how-

and tossed his head.

"Never mind your master, Lowry," said Mrs. Daly,
"he is only amusing himself with you."
"Oh, ha! I'm sure I know it, ma'am ; long life to
bim, and 'tis he that's welcome to his joke."
"But, Lowry"
"Ah, Heaven bless you now, masther, an let me
alone. I'll say nothing to you."
"Nay, nay, I only wanted to ask you what sort of a
fair it was at Garryowen yesterday."
"Middling, sir, like the small piatees, they tell me,"
said Lowry, suddenly changing his manner to an appear-
ance of serious occupation; "but 'tis hard to make out
what sort a fair is when one has nothing to sell himself.
I met a huxter, an' she told me it was a bad fair, because
she could not sell her piggins; an' I met a pig-jobber,
an' he told me 'twas a dear fair, pork ran so high ; an' I
met another little meagre creatur, a neighbour that has a
cabin on the road above, an he said 'twas the best fair
that ever came out o' the sky, because he got a power for
his pig. But Mr. Hardress Cregan was there, an' if he
didn't make it a dear fair to some of 'em, you may call
me an honest man."
"A very notable undertaking that would be, Lowry.
But how was it?"
"Some o' them boysthem Garryowen lads, sir, to
get about Danny Mann, the Lord, Mr. Hardress's boat-
man, as he was comin' down from Mihil's with a new
rope for some part o' the boat, and to begin reflecting on
him in regard o' the hump on his back, poor creatur !
Well, if they did, Master Hardress heerd 'em ; and he
having a stout blackthorn in his hand, this way, and he
made up to the foremost of 'em. "What's that you're
saying, you scoundrel ?" says he. 'What would you give
to know?" says the other, mighty impudent. Master
Hardress made no more, only up with the stick, and
without saying this or that, or by your leave, or how do
you do, he stretched him. Well, such a scuffle as began
among 'em was never seen. They all fell upon Master
Hardress, but faix they had only the half of it, for he
made his way through the thick of 'em without as much

as a mark. Aw, indeed; it isn't a goose or a duck they
had to do with when they came across Mr. Cregan for
all."
"And where were you all this while, Lowry P"
"Above in Mihil's door, standin' and lookin' about the
fair for myself."
"And Eily?"
"Ah, hear to this again, now! I'll run away out o'
the place entirely from you, masther, that's what 'll do;"
and suiting the action to the phrase, exit Lowry Looby.
"Well, Kyrle," said Mr. Daly, as the latter rose and
laid aside his chair, "I suppose we are not to expect you
back to-night?"
"Likely not, sir. If I have any good news to tell, I
shall send an answer by Lowry, who goes with me; and
if " Something seemed to stick in his throat, and he
tied to laugh it out"if I should be unsuccessful, I will
ride on to the dairy-farm at Gurtenaspig, where Hardress
Cregan promised to meet me."
Mr. Daly wished him better fortune than he seemed to
hpe for, and repeated an old proverb about a faint heart

so would many younger ladies have said, had they known
Kyrle Daly as well as she did.
While Mrs. Daly, who was the empress of all house-
keepers, superintended the removal of the breakfast-
table, not disdaining with her own fair hands to restore
the plate and china to their former neatness, the old
gentleman called all his children around him, to undergo
a customary examination. They came flocking to his
knees, the boys with their satchels thrown over their
shoulders, and the girls with their gloves and bonnets on,
ready for school. Occasionally, as they stood before the
patriarchal sire, their eyes wandered from his face towards
a lofty pile of sliced bread and butter, and a bowl of
white sugar which stood near his elbow.
"North-east !" Mr. Daly began, addressing the eldest.
It should be premised that this singular name was
given to the child in compliance with a popular supersti-
tion; for, sensible as the Dalys were accounted in their
daily affairs, they were not wholly exempt from the pre-
vailing weakness of their countrymen. Three of Mrs.
Daly's children died at nurse, and it was suggested to the
unhappy parents, that if the next little stranger were bap-
tized by the name of North-east, the curse would be
removed from their household. Mrs. Daly acceded to
the proposition, adding to it, at the same time, the slight
precaution of changing her nurses. With what success
this ingenious remedy was attended, the flourishing state
of Mr. Daly's nursery thenceforward sufficiently testified.
"North-east," said the old gentleman, "when was Ire-
land first peopled?"
"By Bartholanus, sir, in anno mundi 1956, the great
great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Noah."
"Six greats. Right, my boy. Although the Cluan-
Mac-Nois makes it 1969. But a difference of a few
years, at a distance of nearly four thousand, is not a
matter to be quarrelled with. Stay, I have not done with
yet. Mr. Tickleback tells me you are a great Latinist.
What part of Ovid are you reading now?"
"The Metamorphoses, sir, book the thirteenth."
"Ah, poor Ajax I he's an example and a warning for
## p. 39 (#43) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 39
all Irishmen. Well, North-east, Ulysses ought to supply
you with Latin enough to answer me one question.
Give me the construction of this: Mater mea sus est
mala."
The boy hesitated a moment, laughed, reddened a
little, and looked at his mother. "That's a queer thing,
sir," he said at last.
"Come, construe, construe."
"My mother is a bad sow," said North-east, laughing;
"that's the only English I can find for it."
"Ah, North-east ! Do you call me names, my lad?"
said Mrs. Daly, while she laid aside the china in a cup-
board.
""Tis dadda you should blame, ma'am ; 'twas he said
it. I only told him the English of it."
This affair produced much more laughter and merri-
ment than it was worth. At length Mr. Daly conde-
scended to explain.
"You gave me one construction of it," said he, "but
not the right one. However, these things cannot be
learned all in a day, and your translation was correct,
North-east, in point of grammar, at all events. But," he
continued with a look of learned wisdom, "the true mean-
ing of the sentence is this: Mater, mother, mea, hasten,
sus, the sow, est, eats up, (edere, my boy, not esse), mala,
the apples."
"Oh, it's a cran, I see," said the boy with some indig-
nation of tone. "One isn't obliged to know crans. I'd
soon puzzle you if I was to put you all the crans I
know."
"Not so easily as you suppose, perhaps," said his
father, in dignified alarm, lest his reputation should suffer
in the eyes of his wife, who really thought him a profound
linguist. "But you are a good boy. Go to school,
North-east. Here, open your satchel."
The satchel was opened, a huge slice of bread from the
top of the pile above mentioned was dropt into it, and
North-east set off south-south-west out of the house.
"Charles, who is the finest fellow in Ireland?"
"Henry Grattan, sir."
## p. 40 (#44) ##############################################
40 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Why so, sir."
"Because he says we must have a free trade, sir."
"You shall have a lump of sugar with your bread for
that. Open your satchel. There; run away now to
school. Patcy l"
&g Sir !"
"Patcy, tell me, who was the first Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland in the present reign?"
Patcy, an idle young rogue, stood glancing alternately
at the pile of bread and at his father's face, and shifting
from one foot to another like a foundering nag. At last
he said stoutly
"Julius Caesar, sir."
"That's a good boy. Ah, you young villain, if I had
asked you who won the last boat-race, or how many
hookers went by this morning, you'd give me a better
answer than that. Was it Julius Caesar sailed round the
revenue cutter, near Tarbert, the other day?"
"No, sir, it was Larry Kett."
"I'll engage you know that. Well, tell me this, and
I'll...forgive you! Who was the bravest seaman you ever
heard of? always excepting Hardress Cregan."
"Brown, sir, the man that brought the Bilboa ship
into Youghal, after making prisoners of nine Frenchmen:
the fellows, dadda," the boy continued, warming with
his subject, "were sent to take the vessel into France,
and Brown had only three men and a boy with him, and
they retook the ship, and brought her into Youghal.
But sure one Irishman was more than a match for two
Frenchmen."
"Well, I perceive you have some knowledge in physics
and comparative physiology. There's some hope of you.
Go to school." And the pile of bread appeared a few
inches lower.
The remainder was distributed amongst the girls, to
whom the happy father put questions in history, geo-
graphy, catechism, etc., proportioned to the capacity of
each. At length he descended to the youngest, a little
cherub, with roses of three years' growth in her cheeks.
"Well, Sally, my pet, what stands for sugar?"
## p. 41 (#45) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 4I
"I, dadda."
"Ah, Sally's a wag I see. You do stand for it,
indeed, and you shall get it. We must not expect to
force nature," he added, looking at his wife, and tossing
his head. "Every beginning is weak, and Sam Johnson
himself was as indifferent a philologist once in his day.
And now, to school at once, darlings, and bring home
good judgments. Nelly will go for you at three o'clock."
The little flock of innocents, who were matched in size
like the reeds of a pandean pipe, each under each, having
left the scene, Mr. Daly proceeded to despatch his own
affairs, and possessed himself of his hat and cane.
"I'll step over to the meadow, my dear, and see how
the hay gets on. And give me that pamphlet of Hutchin-
son'sCommercial RestraintsI promised to lend it to
Father Malachy. And let the stranger's room be got
ready, my love, and the sheets aired, for I expect Mr.
Windfall, the tax-gatherer, to sleep here to-night. And
Sally, if Reddy should come about his pigs that I put in
pound last night, let him have them free of cost, but not
without giving the fellow a fright about them; and above
all, insist upon having rings in their noses before night.
My little lawn is like a fallow-field with them. I'll be
back at five."
Saying this, and often turning his head as some new
Commission arose to his memory, the Munster "Middle-
man" Sallied out of his house, and walked along the
gravelled avenue, humming, as he went, a verse of the
Popular old song:-
"And when I at last must throw off this frail covering,
Which I have worn for three score years and ten,
On the brink of the grave I'll not seek to keep hovering,
Nor my thread wish to spin o'er again.
My ace in the glass I'll serenely survey,
And with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow,
For this old worn-out stuff that is threadbare to-day,
May become everlasting to-morrow 1
To-morrow! To-morrow!
May become everlasting to-morrow!"
Such, in happier days than ours, was the life of a Mun-

ster farmer. Indeed, the word is ill-adapted to convey
to an English reader an idea of the class of persons whom
it is intended to designate, for they were, and are, in
mind and education, far superior to the persons who
occupy that rank in most other countries. Opprobrious
as the term "middleman" has been rendered in our own
time, it is certain that the original formation of the sept
was both natural and beneficial.
When the country was deserted by its gentry, a general
promotion of one grade took place among those who
remained at home. The farmers became gentlemen, and
the labourers became farmers, the former assuming, to-
gether with the station and influence, the quick and
honourable spirit, the love of pleasure, and the feudal
authority, which distinguished their aristocratic arche-
types, while the humbler classes looked up to them for
advice and assistance, with the same feeling of respect
and of dependence which they had once entertained for
the actual proprietors of the soil. The covetousness of
landlords themselves, in selling leases to the highest
bidder, without any inquiry into his character or fortune,
first tended to throw imputations on this respectable and
useful body of men, which, in progress of time, swelled
into a popular ontcry, and ended in an Act of the legisla-
ture for their gradual extirpation. There are few now in
that class as prosperous, many as intelligent and high-
principled, as Mr. Daly.

CHAPTER V.
How KYRLE DALY RoDE out To woo, AND How LowRY
LOOBY TOLD HIM SOME STORIES ON THE WAY.
KYRLE DALY had even better grounds than he was willing
to insist upon for doubting his success with Anne Chute.
He had been introduced to her for the first time, in the
course of the preceding spring, at an assize ball, and
thought her, with justice, the finest girl in the room: he
## p. 43 (#47) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 43
danced two sets of country dances (ah ces beaux jours!)
with her, and was ravished with her manners; he saw her
home at night, and left his heart behind him when he
bade her farewell.
The conquest of his affections might not have been so
permanent as to disturb his quiet, had it not been quickly
followed by that of his reason likewise. His subsequent
acquaintance with the young lady produced a confirma-
tion of his first impressions, from which he neither sought
nor hoped to be delivered. The approbation of his
parents fixed the closing rivet in the chain which bound
him. Mrs. Daly loved Anne Chute for her filial tender-
ness and devotion, and Mr. Daly, with whom portionless
virtue would have met but a tardy and calm acceptance,
was struck motionless when he heard that she was to have
the mansion and demesne of Castle Chute, which he
knew had been held by her father's family at a pepper-
corn rent, insomuch that Kyrle might have said with
Lubin in the French comedy, "Il ne tiendra qu' elle
que nous ne soyons maris ensemble."
Nothing, however, in the demeanour of the young lady
led him to believe that their acquaintance would be likely
to terminate in such a catastrophe. It was true she liked
him, for Kyrle was a popular character amongst all his
fair acquaintances. He had, in addition to his handsome
appearance, that frank and cheerful manner, not un-
mingled with a certain degree of tenderness and delicacy,
which is said to be the most successful in opening the
female heart. Good nature spoke in his eyes, in his
voice, and in "the laughter of his teeth," and he carried
around him a certain air of ease and freedom, governed
by that happy and instinctive discretion which those who
affect the quality in vain attempt to exercise, and always
overstep. But he could not avoid seeing that it was as a
mere acquaintance he was esteemed by Miss Chutean
intimate, familiar, and, he sometimes flattered himself,
a valued one, but still a mere acquaintance. She had
even received some of his attentions with a coldness
intentionally marked; but as an elegant coldness formed
a part of her general manner, the lover, with a lover's
## p. 44 (#48) ##############################################
44 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
willing blindness, would not receive those intimations as
he at first thought they were intended.
When the affections are once deeply impressed with
the image of beauty, everything in nature that is beautiful
to the eyes, musical to the ears, or pleasing to any of the
senses, awakens a sympathetic interest within the heart,
and strengthens the impression under which it languishes.
The loveliness of the day, and of the scenes through
which he passed, occasioned a deep access of passion in
the breast of our fearful wooer. The sky was mottled
over with those small bright clouds which sailors, who
look on them as ominous of bad weather, term mackrel;
large masses of vapour lay piled above the horizon, and
the deep blue openings over-head, which were visible at
intervals, appeared streaked with a thin and drifted mist
which remained motionless, while the clouds underneath
were driven fast across by a wind that was yet unfelt on
earth.
The wooded point of land which formed the site of
Castle Chute, projected considerably into the broad river,
at a distance of many miles from the road on which he
now travelled, and formed a point of view, on which the
eye, after traversing the extent of water which lay between,
reposed with much delight. Several small green islands,
and rocks, black with sea-weed, and noisy with the un-
ceasing cry of sea-fowl, diversified the surface of the
stream, while the shores were clothed in that graceful
variety of shade, and light, and hue, which is peculiar to
the season.
As Kyrle, with the fidelity of a lover's eye, gazed on
the point of land above mentioned, and on the tall castle
which over-topped the elms, and was reflected in the
smooth and shining waters underneath, he saw a white
sailed pleasure-boat glide under its walls, and stand out
again into the bed of the river. A sudden flash shot
from her bow, and after the lapse of a few seconds, the
report of a gun struck upon his ear. At the same
moment the green flag which hung at the peak of the
boat, was lowered in token of courtesy, and soon after
hoisted again to its former position. Kyrle, who recog-
## p. 45 (#49) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 45
nised the Nora Creina, felt a sudden hurry in his spirits
at the sight of this telegraphic communion with the family
of his beloved. The picture instantly rushed into his
mind of the effects produced by this incident in the
interior of Castle Chute:-
Anne Chute looking up, and starting from her work-
table, her mother leaning on her gold-headed cane, and
rising with difficulty from her easy-chair, to move towards
the window; the cross old steward, Dan Dawley, casting
a grim side glance from his desk, through the hall window;
the housemaid, Syl Carney, pausing, brush in hand, and
standing like an evoked spirit, in a cloud of dust, to gape
in admiration of the little pageant; the lifting of the sash,
and the waving of a white handkerchief, in answer to the
greeting from the water. But could it be visible at that
distance? He put spurs to his horse, and rode forward
at a brisker rate.
The figure of Lowry Looby, moving forward at a sling
trot on the road before him, was the first object that
directed his attention from the last-mentioned incident,
and turned his thoughts into a merrier channel. The
Mercury of the cabins, with a hazel stick for his herpe,
and a pair of well-paved brogues for his talaria, jogged
forward at a rate which obliged his master to trot at the
summit of his speed in order to overtake him. He
... carried the skirts of his great frieze riding-coat under his
arm, and movedor, more properly sprangforward,
throwing out his loose-jointed legs forcibly, and with such
a careless freedom, that it seemed as if when once
he lifted his foot from the ground, he could not tell
where it would descend again.
Lowry's hat hung so far back on his head that the disk
of the crown was fully visible to his followers, while his
head was so much in the rear of his shoulders, and
moved from side to side with such a jaunty air, that it
seemed at times as if the owner had a mind to leave it
behind him altogether. In his right hand, fairly balanced
in the centre, he held the hazel stick before alluded to,
while he half hummed, half sung aloud, a verse of a
popular ballad:
## p. 46 (#50) ##############################################
46 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Bryan O'Lynn had no small-clothes to wear,
He cut up a sheep-skin to make him a pair,
With the skinny side out and the woolly side in-
"'Tis pleasant and cool," says Bryan O'Lynn."
"Lowry 1" shouted Kyrle Daly.
"Going, sir!"
"Going? I think you are going, and at a pretty brisk
rate, too. You travel merrily, Lowry."
"Middlen, sir, middlenas the world goes. I sing for
company, ever and always, when I go a long road by
myself; an' I find it a dale pleasanter and lighter on me.
Equal to the lark, that the louder he sings the higher he
mounts, it's the way with me, an' I travellin'the lighter
my heart, the faster the road slips from under me.
I am a bold bachelor, airy and free,
Both cities and counties are equal to me;
Among the fair females of every degree,
I care not how long I do tarry."
"Lowry, what do you think of the day?"
"What do I think of it, sir? I'm thinkin' 'twill rain,
an' I'm sorry for it, an' the master's hay out yet. There's
signs o' wind an' rain. The forty days ar'n't out yet, and
there was a sight o' rain the last Saint Sweeten." And
he again resumed his melody, suffering it to sink and
swell in a manner alternately distinct and inarticulate,
with a slight mixture of that species of enunciation, which
Italians term the voice of the head:
"I never will marry while youth's at my side,
For my heart it is light and the world is wide;
I'll ne'er be a slave to a haughty old bride,
To curb me and keep me uneasy."
"And why should last St. Swithin have anything to do
with this day?"
"Oyeh, then, sure enough. sir. But they tell an ould
fable about Saint Sweeten when he was first buried z:

he died; an' when they had the grave dug, and were for

an' nights."
"And they couldn't bury him?"
"An' they couldn't bury him till the forty days were
over" -
"He had a long wake, Lowry."
"Believe it, sir. But ever since that, they remark,
whatever way Saint Sweeten's day is, it is the same for
forty days after. You don't b'lieve that, sir, now P"
"Indeed, I am rather doubtful."
"See that, why | Why, then, I seen a schoolmaster

be with ould times | There is nothin' at all there as it
used to be, Master Kyrle. There isn't the same weather
there, nor the same peace, nor comfort, nor as much
money, nor as strong whiskey, nor as good piatees, nor
the gentlemen isn't so pleasant in themselves, nor the
poor people so quiet, nor the boys so divartin', nor the
girls so coaxin', nor nothin' at all is there as it used to be
formerly. Hardly, I think, the sun shines as bright in
the day; an' nothin' shows itself now by night, neither
spirits nor good people. In them days, a man couldn't
go a lonesome road at night without meetin' things that
would make the hair of his head stiffen equal to bristles.
Now you might ride from this to Dingle without seeing
ls uglier than yourself on the way. But what help
or it?
"Once in fair England my Blackbird did flourish,
He was the chief flower that in it did spring;
Prime ladies of honour his person did nourish,
Because that he was the true son of a king.

"I recollect to have heard of a fat man, that 
"Fat l" exclaimed Lowry, in a voice of surprise, "you
may say fat. There isn't that door on hinges that he'd
pass in, walkin' with a fair front, widout he turned side-
ways, or skamed in one way or other. You an' I, an'
another along wid us, might be made out of the one half
of him aisy. His body-coat, when he died med a whole
shoot for Dan Dawley, the steward, besides a jacket for
his little boy; an' Dan was no fishing-rod that time, I
tell you. But any way, fat or lain, he was buried, an' all
the world will tell you that he was seen rising a fortnight
after by Dan Dawley, in the shape of a drove o' young
pigs."
"A whole drove?"
"A whole drove. An''tisn't lain, lanky carcaishes o'
store pigs either, only fat, fit for bacon. He was passin'
the forge, near the Ould gate, an' the moon shinin' as
bright as silver, when he seen him comin' again him on
the road. Sure he isn't the same man ever since."
"Dan Dawley is not easily caught by appearances.
What a sharp eye he must have had, Lowry, to recognise
his master under such a disguise !"
"Oyeh, he knew well what was there. 'Tisn't the
first time with Dan Dawley seein' things o' the kind.
Didn't you ever hear what happened Dan in regard of his
first wife, sir?"
& 4 NO."
"Well, aisy, an' I'll tell you. Dan was married to a
girl o' the Hayeses, a very inthricate little creatur, that
led him a mighty uneasy life from the day they married
out. Well, it was Dan's luck, she got a stitch, an' died
one mornin', an' if she did, Dan made a pilliloo an' a
Iavo over her, as if he lost all belongin' to him. They

buried her, for all, an' Dan was sittin' in his own doore,
an' he twistin' a gad, to hang a little taste o' bacon he
had, he singin' the Rovin' Journeyman for himself, when,
tundher alive who should walk in the doore to him only
his dead wife, an' she livin' as well as ever ! Take it
from me, he didn't stay long where he was. 'Eh, is that
you, Cauth?' says he. 'The very one,' says she, "how
does the world use you, Dan P" "Wisha, middlin'," says
Dan again, "I didn't think we'd see you any more, Cauth,"
says he. "Nor you wouldn't either,' says she, "only for
yourself.' 'Do you tell me so?" says Dan Dawley, "how
was that?' 'There are two dogs," says she, "that are
sleeping on the road I was goin' in the other world, and
the noise you made cryin' over me wakened 'em, an' they
riz again me, an' wouldn't let me pass.' "See that, why I'
says Dan, grinning, "warn't they the conthrairy pair?"
Well, after another twelvemonth Cauth died the second
time; but, I'll be your bail, it was long from Dan
Dawley to cry over her this turn as he did at first.
"Twas all his trouble to see would he keep the woman at
the wake from keening over the dead corpse, or doing
anything in life that would waken the dogs. Signs on,
she passed 'em, for he got neither tale nor tidin's of her
from that day to this. "Poor Cauth,' says Dan, 'why
should I cry, to have them dogs tearin' her maybe?"
"Dan Dawley was a lucky man," said Kyrle. "Neither
Orpheus nor Theseus had so much to say for themselves
as he had."
"I never hear talks o' them gentlemen, sir; wor they
o' these parts?"
"Not exactly. One of them was from the county of
Attica, and the other from the county of Thrace."
"I never hear of 'em : I partly guessed they wor
strangers," Lowry continued with much simplicity, "but
any way, Dan Dawley was a match for the best of 'em,
an' a luckier man that I told you yet, moreover, that's in
the first beginnin' of his days."
At this moment a number of smart young fellows,
dressed out in new felt hats, clean shoes and stockings,
with ribbons flying at the knees, passed them on the road.

They touched their hats respectfully to Mr. Daly, while
they recognised his attendant by a nod, a smile, and a
familiar "Is that the way, Lowry P*
"The very way, then, lads," said Lowry, casting a long-
ing look after them. "Goin' to Garryowen they are
now, divartin' for the night," he added in a half envious
tone, after which he threw the skirt of his coat from the
left to the right arm, looked down at his feet, struck the
ground with the end of his stick, and trotted on, sing:
ing:
"I'm noted for dancin' a jig in good order,
A min'et I'd march, an' I'd foot a good reel,
In a country-dance I'd still be the leading partner,
I ne'er faltered yet from a crack on the heel.
My heart is wid ye, boys, this night. But I was tellin'
you, Masther Kyrle, about Dan Dawley's luck! Listen
hether."
He dried his face, which was glistening with moisture
and flushed with exercise, in his frieze coat, and com-
menced his story:
"'Tis not in Castle Chute the family lived always, sir,
only in ould Mr. Chute's time; he built it, and left the
Fort above, an' I'll tell you for what raison. The ould
man of all, that had the Fort before him, used to be
showing himself there at night, himself an' his wife, an'
his two daughters, an' a son, an' there were the strangest
noises ever you hear, going on above stairs. The master
had six or seven sarvints, one after another, stopping up
to watch him, but there isn't one of 'em but was killed by
the spirit. Well, he was forced to quit at last on the
'count of it, an' it is then he built Castle Chutethe
new part of it, where Miss Anne an' the ould lady lives
now. Well an' good, if he did, he was standin' one
mornin' oppozit his own gate on the road-side, out, an'
the sun shining, an' the birds singing for themselves in
the bushes, when who should he see only Dan Dawley,
an' he a little gaffer the same time, serenadin' down the
road for the bare life. "Where to now, lad?' says Mr.
Chute (he was a mighty pleasant man). "Looking for a

past this gate for him," says Mr. Chute, "if you'll do what
I bid you," says he. "What's that, sir?" says the boy.
So he up an' told him the whole story about the Fort,
an' how something used to be showin' itself there, con-
stant, in the dead hour o' the night; 'an' have you the
courage,' says he, "to sit up a night, an' watch it?'
'What would I get by it?' says Dan, looking him up in
the face. "I'll give you twenty guineas in the mornin',
an' a table, an' a chair, an' a pint o' whiskey, an' a fire,
an' a candle, an' your dinner before you go,' says Mr.
Chute. "Never say it again,' says the gorsoon, "'tis high
wages for one night's work, an' I never yet done,' says
he, "anything that would make me in dread o' the living
or the dead, or afraid to trust myself into the hands o'
the Almighty." "Very well, away with you,' says the
gentleman, "an' I'll have your life if you tell me a word
of a lie in the mornin'," says he. "I will not, sir,' says the
boy, "for what?' Well, he went there, an' he drew the
table a-near the fire for himself, an' got his candle, an'
began readin' his book. 'Tis the lonesomest place you
ever seen. Well, that was well an' good, till he heerd the

"True for you," says Mr. Chute, puttin' a hand in his
pocket, and reaching him twenty guineas. 'Will you

Dan. Well, he went walkin' about the fields for himself,

"You may pass over the adventures of the second

ing 'em stop so long in the one place, an' the Ould man
lookin' so wicked (he was after killin' six or seven, in the
same Fort), and he went down on his two knees, an' he
put his hands together, an' says he 
A familiar incident of Irish pastoral life occasioned an
interruption in this part of the legend. Two blooming
country girls, their hair confined with a simple black rib-
bon, their cotton gowns pinned up in front, so as to dis-
close the greater portion of the blue stuff petticoat under-
neath, and their countenances bright with health and
laughter, ran out from a cottage door, and intercepted the
progress of the travellers. The prettier of the two skipped
across the road, holding between her fingers a worsted
thread, while the other retained between her hands the
targe ball from which it had been unwound. Kyrle
paused, too well acquainted with the country customs to
break through the slender impediment.
"Pay your ooting, now, Master Kyrle Daly, before you
go farther," said one.
"Don't overlook the wheel, sir," added the girl who
remained next the door.
Kyrle searched his pocket for a shilling, while Lowry,
with a half smiling, half censuring race, murmured:
"Why, then, Heaven send ye sense, as it is it ye want
this mornin'."
"And you manners, Mr. Looby. Single your freedom,
## p. 53 (#57) ##############################################

and double your distance, I beg o' you. Sure your purse,
if you have one, is safe in your pocket. Long life an' a
good wife to you, Master Kyrle, an' I wisht I had a better
hould than this o' you. I wisht you were in looze, an' that
I had the finding o' you this morning'."
So saying, while she smiled merrily on Kyrle, and dart-
ing a scornful glance at Lowry Looby, she returned to her
woollen wheel, singing as she twirled it round:
"I want no lectures from a learned master;
He may bestow 'em on his silly train
I'd sooner walk through my blooming garden,
An' hear the whistle of my jolly swain."
To which Lowry, who received the lines, as they were
probably intended, in a satirical sense, replied, as he
trotted forwards, in the same strain:
"Those dressy an' smooth-faced young maidens,
Who now looks at present so gay,
Has borrowed some words o' good English,
An' knows not one-half what they say.
No female is fit to be married,
Nor fancied by no man at all,
But those who can sport a drab mantle,
An' likewise a cassimere shawl.
Hoop-whishk I Why, then, she's a clean made little girl
for all, isn't she, Master Kyrle? But I was tellin' you
where's this I was 2 Iss, just. Dan Dawley going on his
knees an' talking to the sperrit. Well, he raised his two
hands this way, an', 'The Almighty be betune you an'
me this night," says he. "Ah, that's my good boy,' says
the ould man, 'I was waiting these three nights to have
you speak first, an' if you hadn't that time, I'd have yout
life equal to all the others,' says he. "But come with me
now, an' I'll make a gentleman o' you, for you're the
best boy that ever I see,' says he. Well, the boy got a
trembling, an' he couldn't folly him. "Don't be one bit
afeerd o' me,' says the ould gentleman, "for I won't do
you a ha'p'orth of hurt.' Well, he carried Dan after him
through the house, an' he showed him three crocks o'
goold buried behind a doore, an' 'D'ye hear to me now 7

54 The COLLEEN BAWN.
says he, "tell my son to give one o' these crocks to my
daughter, an' another to you, an' to keep the third him-
self; an' then I won't show myself this way any more,'
says he, "for it is the goold that does be always troubling
us in the ground. An' tell him, if he lives,' says he, "to
give you my daughter in marriage, an' this Fort along
with her.' 'Alilul me tell him 1' cries Dan Dawley.
"I'm sure I wouldn't take him such a message for the
world.' 'Do, ayeh,' says the ould man, "an' show him
this ring for a token, an' tell him I'll be showing myself
be day an' be night to him, until he'll give her to you.'
So he vanished in the greatest tundher ever you hear.
That was well an' goodwell, the next mornin' Mr
Chute come, an' if he did, 'Good-morrow, good boy,'
says he. "Good-morrow, sir,' says Dan. "Have you any
news for me after the night?" says he. "I have very good
news,' says Dan, 'I have three crocks o' goold for you, I
got from the Ould gentleman,' says he, an' he up an'
tould him all about it, an' showed him the goold. 'It's
a lie you're telling me,' says Mr. Chute, 'an' I'll have
your life,' says he, "you went rootin'an' found these your-
self.' So Dan put a hand in his pocket, an' pulled out
the ring and gave it into his hand. It was the ring, sir,
his father wore the day he was buried. "I give it into
you," says Mr. Chute, "you did see them surely. What
else did he say to you?' Well, Dan begin lookin' down
an' up, an' this way, an' that way, an' didn't know what to
say. Tell me at once,' says Mr. Chute, 'an' fear nothing.'
Very well. He did. "Sir,' says he, "the ould gentleman
told me, an' sure 'tis a thing I don't expectbut he said
I should get Miss Anne, your sister, in marriage.' Well,
Mr. Chute stood lookin' at Dan, as if he had three heads
on him. 'Give you my sister, you keowt of a geoeogh'
says he, "you flog Europe for bouldnessget out of my
sight,' says he, "this minute, or I'll give you a kick that
will raise you from poverty to the highest pitch of af.
fluence.' 'An' won't I get the crock o' goold, sir?" says
Dan. "Away out o' that with you," says the gentleman,
''tis to rob me you want I believe, you notorious delin-
quent.' Well, Dan was forced to cut, but in a while after

the ould man sent for him, an' made him a compliment
o' something handsome, an' put him over his business as
he is to-day with the present people, and an honest
creatur as could be. There's more people says that it
was all a fable, an' that Dan Dawley dremt of it, but this
was his own story. 'An'sure / might as well be draming
too," he added, casting a side glance at Kyrle, "for it's
little attention you are paying to me or my story."
In this assertion Lowry was perfectly correct, for his
young master's thoughts, at that moment, were occupied
by a far more interesting subject.
?
CHAPTER VI.
HOW KYRLE DALY WAS MORE PUZZLED BY A PIECE OF
PAPER THAN THE ABOLISHERS OF THE SMALL-NOTE
CURRENCY THEMSELVES.
IN taking out of his pocket the piece of silver which he
wanted to bestow on the cottage Omphale, he drew forth
with it a little paper, containing a copy of verses which he
had taken from one of Anne Chute's music-books.
They were written in a boyish hand, and signed with the
letters H. C.; and Kyrle was taxing his memory to recapitu-
late all the bachelors in the county who bore those initials.
There was, in the first place, Hyland Creagh, commonly
called Fireball Creagh, a great sweater and pinkera
notorious duellist, who had been concerned, either on
behalf of himself or his friends, in more than one hundred
"affairs of honour," a member of the Hell-fire Club, a
society constituted on principles similar to that of the
Mohocks, which flourished in London about half a cen-
tury before Kyrle's time, and whose rules and orders the
reader may peruse at full length in the manifesto of their
Emperor Taw Waw Eben Zan Kaladar, as set forth in
Mr. Addison's amusing journal.
Of the provincial branch of the society above men-
tioned (it is a name that we are loth to repeat oftener than
## p. 56 (#60) ##############################################
56 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
is necessary), Mr. Hyland Fireball Creagh had been a
member in his early days, and was still fond of recounting
their customs and adventures with greater minuteness
than always accorded with the inclinations of his hearers.
There were some qualities in the composition of this
gentleman, which made it probable enough that he might
write verses in a lady's music-book. He was as gallant as
any unmarried Irishman of his day, and he had a fighting
name, a reputation which was at that time in much higher
repute than it is in our own. He had conversation (an
essential talent in a man of gallantry)he dressed well,
though with a certain antiquated airand he had a little
poodle dog, which shut the door when you said "Baither-
shin," and chucked a crust of bread from his nose into his
mouth at the word "Fire l' And Mr. Creagh, whenever
his canine follower was called upon to perform those feats,
was careful to make the ladies observe, that Pincher never
ventured to snap at the word "Make ready ?" or "Pre-
sent l'' while if you whispered "Fire 1* in never so gentle
a tonepop ! the bread vanished in an instant.
But then, there were some objections which were likely
to neutralize these accomplishments of Fireball and his
dog, and to render it unlikely, after all, that he (that is the
former) had been the perpetrator of the verses. He had
run through his property, and reduced himself to the
mean estate of a needy guest at other men's tables, and a
drinker of other men's wine, or rather whiskey, for that
was the fundamental ingredient of his customary beverage.
This circumstance laid him under the necessity of over-
looking a greater number of unhandsome speeches than
was consistent with his early fame. And there was one
other objection, which rendered it still more improbable
that Anne Chute would think any of his effusions worth
preserving: he was just turned of sixty-five.
It could not, therefore, be Mr. Hyland Fireball Creagh,
H. C.?Who was it? Hepton Connolly?
Now, reader, judge for yourself what a wise conjecture
was this of Mr. Kyrle Daly's. Mr. Hepton Connolly was
a still more objectionable swain than the Irish diner-out
above described; indeed, he had no single qualification
## p. 57 (#61) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 57
to recommend him as a social companion, except that of
being able to contain a prodigious quantity of whisky-
punch at a sittinga virtue in which a six-gallon jar might
have excelled him. Nor do I find that there was any
part of Anne Chute's demeanour which could lead Kyrle
Daly to suppose that this circumstance would take a
powerful hold of her affections, although it secured him
an envied place in those of her uncle, Mr. Barnaby
Cregan, of Roaring Hall. For the rest, Mr. Hepton
Connolly was one individual of a species which is now
happily extinct among Irish gentlemen. He just retained
enough of a once flourishing patrimony to enable him to
keep a hunter, a racer, and an insolent groom.
He was the terror of all the pettifogging lawyers, the
three-and-ninepenny attorneys, bailiffs, and process-servers
in the county. Against these last, in particular, he had
carried his indignation to such a length as to maim one of
them for life by a shot from his hall window. And he
told fifty anecdotes, which made it appear astonishing
that he had escaped the gallows so long. But he relied
strongly (and in those days not without reason) on the
fact, that there could not be a jury empanelled against
him on which he might not number a majority of his
own relations. It was not, indeed, that he calculated
much on their personal regard or affection for himself, but
the stain upon their own name was such, he knew, as they
would not willingly incur. His reliance upon this nicety
of honour in his friends was so complete, that he never
suffered any uneasiness upon those occasions when it
became necessary for him to plead to an indictment, how-
ever irresistible the evidence by which it was supported;
and the only symptoms of anxiety which he ever mani-
fested, consisted in a frequent reference to his watch, and
a whisper to the under-turnkey, to know whether he had
left directions at the jail to keep his dinner hot.
One amusing effect produced by Mr. Connolly's re-
peated collisions with judicial authorities was, that he
acquired a gradual fondness for the law itself, and became
knowing upon the rights of persons and the rights of
things, in proportion to the practical liberties which he
## p. 58 (#62) ##############################################
58 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
was in the habit of taking with the one and the other
While he made little account of breaking a man's head at
a second word, he would prosecute, to the rigour of the
law, a poor half-naked mountaineer, for stealing a basket
of turf from his ricks, or cutting a faggot in one of his
hedges. To do him justice, however, it should be men-
tioned that he never was known to pursue matters to
extremity in the instance of punishment, and was always
satisfied with displaying his own legal skill before the
petty sessions. Nay, he had even been frequently known
to add considerably to his own loss in those cases, by
making a gift to the culprit of many times the amount of
the pilfered property. -
If Anne Chute could receive this single trait of good
feeling as a counterpoise for much bad principleif she
could love to see her house filled with jockeys, horse-
riders, grooms, and drunken gentlemenif she could
cherish a fondness for dogs and unlicensed whiskyif, in
a word, she could be the happy wife of a mere sportsman
then it was possible that Mr. Hepton Connolly might
be the transcriber (author was out of the question) of the
little effusion that had excited Kyrle Daly's curiosity.
Who was it? The question still remained without
solution. Ha! Her cousin and his college friend, Mr.
Hardress Cregan? The conjecture at first made the
blood fly into his face, while his nerves were thrilled by a
horrid sensation of mingled fear, grief, and anger. But a
moment's reflection was sufficient to restore quiet to his
mind, and to smile down the spirit of jealousy at its first
motion within his breast. Hardress Cregan was perfectly
indifferent to the lady; he seldom spoke of her, and
scarcely ever visited at Castle Chute. It could not be
Hardress. He was a great deal too shy and timid to
carry on a lengthened interchange of raillery with any
young lady, and if it were more than raillery, he knew the
intensity of his friend's character too well to suppose that
he would refrain from pursuing his fortunes. It could
not be Hardress. He was perfectly aware of Kyrle Daly's
secrethe had repeatedly expressed the warmest wishes
for his success; and Hardress Cregan was no hypocrite.
## p. 59 (#63) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 59
They had been friends, attached friends, at college; and
although their intercourse had been much interrupted
since their return home, by difference of pursuits and of
tastes or habits, still their early friendship remained
unchanged, and they never met but with the warmth and
the affection of brothers. It was true he had heard
Hardress speak of her with much esteem, on his first
introduction to college, and when he was yet a very young
lad; but a little raillery was abundantly sufficient to strike
him dumb for ever on the subject; and he had not taken
many lounges among the beauties of Capel Street and
the Phoenix Park, when he appeared to have lost all
recollections of his boyish attachment.
Kyrle Daly had penetration enough to be aware that
he could not, with certainty, calculate on a character at
once so profound and so unsettled as that of his young
friend, who had always, even in his mere boyhood, been
unapproachable by his most intimate acquaintances, and
whom he suspected to be capable of one day wielding a
mightier influence in society than he seemed himself to
hope or aspire to. But Hardress was no hypocrite.
That was a sufficient security that, if there were a rival in
the case, he was not the man; and if Kyrle needed a
more positive argument, it might be found in the fact of
a new attachment, which had of late been intimated to
him by his young friend himself.
The love which Kyrle entertained for this lady was so
singular, so rational, and regulated by so fine a principle
of judgment, that the warmest, the wisest, and the best of
men might condescend to take an interest in its success.
Naturally gifted with the gentlest qualities of heart, and
educated by a mother, who taught him the use of that
mind by which they were to be directed, it would not be
easy to discover a more estimable character among the
circles in which he moved. He was the more fortunate,
too, that his goodness was the result of natural feeling
rather than that of principle alone; for it is a strange and
a pitiable peculiarity in our nature, that if a man, by mere
strength of reason and perseverance, have made himself
master of all the social virtues, he shall not be as much

6o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
loved in the world as another who has inherited them
from nature, although, in the latter instance, they may be
obscured by many hideous vices.
It may appear presumptuous to hazard an opinion upon
a subject of so much gravity; but, perhaps, the reader
will not charge us with having caught the paradoxical air
of the day, if we venture to intimate, that the true source
of the preference may be referred to the common prin-
ciple of self-preservation. A character that is naturally,
and by necessity, generous, may be calculated upon with
more certainty than that which is formed by education
only, as long as men's opinions shall be found more vari-
able than their feelings. Otherwise, why should we be-
stow more affection on that character which is really the
less admirable of the two? But the reader may receive
or reject this conjecture as he pleases. We proceed with
our history.
For this, or for some better reason, it was, that Kyrle
Daly, though highly popular among his inferiors and
dependants, had only a second place in their affection,
compared with his friend Hardress. A generosity utterly
reckless and unreasoning is a quality that in all seasons
has wrought most powerfully upon the inclinations of the
Irish peasantry, who are themselves more distinguished
for quick and kindly feeling, than for a just perception of
moral excellence. Because, therefore, the flow of gene-
rosity in Hardress Cregan was never checked nor
governed by motives of prudence nor of justice, while
good sense and reason regulated that of Kyrle Daly, the
estimation in which they were held was proportionably
unequal. The latter was spoken of amongst the people
as "a good master," but Hardress was their darling. His
unbounded profusion made them entertain for him that
natural tenderness which we are apt to feel towards any
object that seems to require protection. "His heart,"
they observed, "was in the right place." "It would be
well for him, if he had some of Master Kyrle's sense, poor
fellow." "Master Kyrle would buy and sell him at any
fair in Munster."
It was only, therefore, among those who were thoroughly

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 61
intimate with his character, that Kyrle Daly was fully un-
derstood and appreciated; and it is not saying a little in
his praise, to remark that his warmest admirers, as well as
his best lovers, were to be found within the circle of his
own family.
It is impossible that such a mind as we have described
could give a tranquil entertainment to any serious passion.
Few could suppose from the general gaiety and cheerful-
ness of his demeanour, and the governed and rational
turn of his discourse, that he held a heart so acutely
susceptible of passion and so obnoxious to disappoint-
ment. It is true, that in the present instance he was
in some degree guarded by his own doubts and fears
against the latter contingency; but he had also cherished
hope sufficient to insure him, in case of rejection, a
grievous load of misery. He had weighed well the lady's
worth before he fixed his affections upon her; and when
he did so, every faculty of his mind and feeling of his
heart subscribed to the conviction, that with her, and her
alone, he could be earthly happy.
The sun had passed the meridian before Kyrle Daly
again beheld the small and wooded peninsula which
formed the site of Castle Chute. The languor of heart
that always accompanies the passion in its hours of com-
parative inaction, that luxurious feeling of mingled pen-
veness and joy, which fills up the breast, and constitutes
in itself an Elysium even to the doubting lover, were
aided in their influence by the sunny calmness of the day .
and the beauty of the landscape, which every step un-
folded to his view. The fever of suspense became more
tormenting in proportion as he drew nearer to the solu-
tion of his doubts, and the last few miles of his journey
seemed incomparably the most tedious. His horse, how-
ever, who was not in love, and had not broken fast
since morning, began, at sight of a familiar baiting-place,
to show symptoms of inanition, to remedy which his
considerate master drew up, and alighted at the inn-door.

CHAPTER VII.
HOW KYRLE DALY DISCOVERS THAT ALL THE SORROW UNDER
THE SUN DOES NOT REST UPON HIS SHOULDERS ALONE.
He left Lowry Looby standing by the trough to see jus-
tice done to the dumb creature, while he strolled onwards
in the sunshine, unwilling to disturb the current of his
own thoughts by any conversation with the people of the
1Ilrl.
The owner of this place of "entertainment" also filled
the dignified post of pound-keeper to the neighbouring
village, and his roofless bastille was situated at no great
distance farther on the roadside. As Kyrle walked by
the iron gate he was surprised to see it crowded by a
number of Kerry ponies, such as may be discerned along
the mountain-sides from the Upper Lake of Killarney.
They were of various colours, bright bay, dun, and cream :
but the shagginess of their coats, and the diminutiveness
of their size, rendered them but a little more respectable
in appearance than the same number of donkeys.
Several of these half-starved creatures had their heads
thrust out over the low pound wall, as if to solicit the
interference of passengers, while others, resigned to
their fate, stood in drooping postures in the centre of the
enclosure, quite chop-fallen. Kyrle Daly's curiosity was
sufficiently excited to induce him to turn once more upon
his path, and make some inquiry at the inn concerning the
owner of the herd.
He found the landlord at the door, a small, withered
old man, with an air of mingled moroseness and good
nature in his countenancethe former the effect of his
office, the latter of his natural disposition. He was
standing on a three-foot stool, and occupied in taking
down a sign-board, for the purpose of transmitting it to a
scene of rural festivity which was going forward in the
neighbourhood.
## p. 63 (#67) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 63
He suspended his labours, and was about to enter into
an ample exposition of the history of the ponies, when his
wife, a blooming, middle-aged woman, in a tete, and glossy
green petticoat, came to the door, and looked out to know
what made the hammering cease. The glance of her eye
was enough for the inn-keeper, who recommenced his
work with fresh diligence, while his watchful helpmate
undertook to satisfy the curiosity of our traveller.
The ponies, she told him, were the property of a
mountaineer from Killarney, who was making a "tower"
of the country, to try and sell them at the fairs and
patterns. He had come to their neighbourhood last
night, and turned his ponies out on the common; but
finding that it furnished only short commons for them,
the poor things had made their way into the improve-
ments of Castle Chute, and were apprehended by Mr.
Dan Dawley in the act of trespass. That inexorable
functionary had issued an order for their immediate com-
mittal to pound; and Myles Murphy, the owner, was
now gone off to make interest with Miss Anne, "the
young Mistress," for their release.
"He'll be a lucky boy," she continued, "if he over-
takes her at home this way, for herself and a deal o'
quality are to be at the sands below, to see the races and
doings there."
"Races P" repeated Kyrle, "I never heard of races in
this quarter."
"Oyeh, what races !" exclaimed her husband. "A
parcel of ould staggeens, sir, that's running for a saddle;
that's all the races they'll have."
"So itself, what hurt," returned the wife. "The whole
European world will be there to look at 'em ; and I'll
be bound they'll drink as hearty as if Jerry Sneak an'
Sappho were on the coorse. An''tis there you ought to
be an hour ago in your tent, instead of crusheening here
about Myles Murphy an' his ponies."
"Myles Murphy!Myles-na-Coppaleen!Myles of
the Ponies, is it?" said Lowry Looby, who just then led
Kyrle Daly's horse to the door. "Is he in these parts
Anow."
## p. 64 (#68) ##############################################
64 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Do you know Myles, eroof" was the truly Irish reply.
"Know Myles-na-Coppaleen P Wisha, an''tis I that
do, an' that well ! O murther! an' are them poor Myles's
onies I see in the pound over ? Poor boy 1 I declare
'm sorry for his trouble."
"If you be as you say," the old inn-keeper muttered
with a distrustful smile, "put a hand in your pocket, an'
give me four-and-eightpence, an' you may take the four-
teen of 'em after him."
"Why then, see; I'm blest, if I had it, but I wouldn't
break your word this day, or more than that, if it was in
my power, for poor Myles. There isn't a better son nor
brother this moment goin' the road than what he is."
"It's true for you, by all accounts," said the pound-
keeper, as he counted over Kyrle Daly's change; "but
people must do their duty for all."
"Surely, surely," said Lowry, turning off.
Mrs. Normal, the hostess, here made her reappearance
at the door with a foaming pot of Fermoy ale in her
hand, to which she directed Lowry's attention.
"Ah, then, what's that you're doin'?" he said with a
look of rough remonstrance, while he fixed, nevertheless,
a steady and wistful eye upon the draught.
"Drink it off, I tell you."
"Sorrow a drop."
"You must, again."
"I won't, I tell you."
"Do you refuse my hansel," an' I goin' to the races?
Be said by me, I tell you. The day is droughty."
Lowry offered no further objection, but made his own of
the ale, observing, as he returned the vessel, with closed
and watery eyes, that it was "murtherin' strong." The
colloquy above detailed was carried on with so much
roughness of accent and violence of gesture, that a person
at a little distance might have supposed the parties were
on the eve of coming to blows in an actual quarrel. But
it was all politeness.
Kyrle Daly obtained from his attendant, as they pro-
ceeded on their way, an account of the individual in whom
*It is considered not lucky to refuse a hansel.

he had expressed so deep an interest. Myles Murphy,
or, as he was more generally called, Myles of the Ponies,
was the occupier of a tract of land on one of the Killarney
mountains, comprising about seven hundred acres. For
this extensive holding he paid a rent of fifteen pounds
Sterling in the year; and if there were a market for grey
limestone in the neighbourhood, Myles would be one of
the wealthiest men in Kerry. But as the agricultural
taste of the vicinity ran chiefly in favour of mud, his pro-
perty in mineral was left as an heirloom upon his hands.
Of the whole seven hundred acres, there was no more
under tillage than sufficed to furnish potatoes for the con-
Sumption of his own family. The vast remainder was
stocked with numerous herds of wild ponies, who found
Scanty pasturage between the fissures of the crags, and
yet were multiplied to such a degree, that Myles could
not estimate the amount of his own stud.
"His own goodness it was," continued Lowry, "that
got that for him. He was left, poor fellow, after his
father dying of the sickness," with a houseful o' childer
fourteen sons an' two daughters, besides himself to pro-
Wide for, an' his ould mother. He supported them all be

self and Luke Kennedy, the Killarney boatman, used to
be two hours "oppozit" one another, without a single blow
being received on either side. On one occasion, indeed,
he was fortunate enough to "get a vacancy at Kennedy,"
of which he made so forcible a use, that the stick which
was in the hand of the latter, flew over Ross Castle
into the Lower Lake, merely from a successful tip on the
elbow. -
"But," Lowry added, "there's a change come in poor
Myles of late. It was his luck to meet Eily O'Connor,
the rope-maker's daughter, of a day, an' he selling his
ponies, an''tis a new story with him since. He's mad, sir,
mad in love. He isn't good for anything. He says she
gave him powders one day in an apple at Owen's garden,
where they had a beneft, but I wouldn't give into such a
story as that at all, for Eily is as delicate and tender in
herself as a lady."
They were interrupted at this juncture by a startling
incident. A mounted countryman galloped up to them,
dressed in a complete Suit of frieze, made from the un-
dyed wool of black sheep such as formed the texture of
the phalang in the days of Gerald Barry. His face was
pale and moist, and grimed with dust. A smooth, yellow
wig was pushed away upon his temples, disclosing a mass
of grey hair that was damp and matted with the effects of
violent exercise. He looked alternately at both the
travellers with an expression of mingled wildness and
grief in his countenance; and again clapping spurs to
his horse, rode off, and disappeared at a short turn in the
road.
"I'm blest but that flogs Europe " exclaimed Lowry
Looby, in a tone of utter surprise and concern"There's
something great happened, surely."
"Who is he, Lowry 2 I think I ought to know his
face P"
"Mihil O'Connor, sir, father to the girl we were just
talking of. He looks to be in trouble. Easy Here's
little Foxy Dunat, the hair-cutter, trottin' after him, an'
he'll tell us."
The person whom he named, a small, red-haired man,

rode up at the same moment, appearing to keep his seat
on horseback with much difficulty. The animal he rode,
though lean, was of great size, and presented a circum-
ference much too extensive to be embraced by the short
legs of the hair-cutter. His feet, for greater security, were
stuck between the stirrup-leathers, while the empty irons
remained dangling underneath. For the purpose of mak-
ing assurance doubly sure, he had grasped fast with one
hand the lofty pommel of the saddle, while the other was
entwined in the long and undressed mane.
"Pru-h ! Pru-hl Stop her, Lowry, eroo! Stop her,
an' heavens bless you. I'm fairly flayed alive from her,
that's what I am, joultin', joultin', for the bare life.
Your sarvent, Mr. DalyI'm not worth lookin' at. See
my wig"he pulled one out of his pocket, and held it
up to view. "I was obleeged to take it off an' put it in
my pocket, 'twas so tossed from the shakin' I got. I
never was a-horseback before, but once at Molly Mac's
funeral, an' I'll never be a-horseback again, till I'm
going to my own. O murther | murther I have a pain
in the small o' my back that would kill the Danes. Well,
Mr. Daly, I hope the master liked his new wig P I kep'
it a long time from him, surely. I never'll be the better
o' this day's ridin'. Did you see Mihil-na-thiadrucha"
go by this way? I'm kilt an' spoiled, that's what I am."
"I did see him," said Lowry; "what's the matter with
him P"
"Eily, his daughter, is gone from him, or spirited
away."
"Erra, you don't tell me so?"
"She is, I tell you, an' he's like a wild man about it.
Here he's back himself."
O'Connor again appeared at the turn of the road, and
galloped roughly back upon the group. He looked fero-
*Michael of the ropes. This practice of naming individuals from
their professions (in which the great proportion of surnames are said
to have originated), is quite general among the Irish peasantry. So
far is the humour sometimes carried, that a poor widow in our own
village has been nicknamed, Vauria n'thau Llanuv, i.e., Mary of
the Two Children.

ciously at Lowry, and pointing his stick into his face,
while his face trembled with rage, he roared out: "Tell
me, did you see her, this minute, or I'll thrust my stick
down your throat? Tell me, do you know anything of
her, I advise you?"
"I don't," said Lowry, with equal fierceness. Then, as
if ashamed of resenting a speech uttered by the poor old
man, under so terrible an occasion of excitement, he
changed his tone, and repeated more gently, "I don't,
Mihil, an' I don't know what cause I ever gave you to
speak to me in that strain."
The old rope-maker dropped the bridle, his clasped
hands fell on the pommel of the Saddle, and he drooped
his head, while he seemed to gasp for utterance: "Lowry,"
he said, "heavens guide you, an' tell me do you know,
or could you put me in a way of hearing anything of her."
"Of who, ayeh P"
"Eily, my daughter! Oh, Lowry, a'ra gal, my daugh-
ter! My poor girl'
"What of her, Mihil?"
"What of her?Gone ! lost Gone from her ould
father, an' no account of her."
"Erra, no."
"Yes, I tell you !" He threw a ghastly look around
"She is stolen or she strayed. If she is stolen, may the
Almighty forgive them that took her from me, an' if she
strayed of her own liking, may my curse"
"Howl howl  I tell you, man," cried Lowry, in a
loud voice, "don't curse your daughter, without knowin'
what you do. Don't I know her, do you think? An'
don't I know that she wouldn't be the girl you say, for
her apronful of goold?"
"You're a good boy, Lowry; you're a good boy,"
said the old man, wringing his hands, "but she's gone.
I had none but her, an' they took her from me. Her
mother is dead these three years, an' all her brothers an'
sisters died young, an' I reared her like a lady, an' this
is the way she left me now. But what hurt? Let her
go."
*Hold.
## p. 69 (#73) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN, 69
"The M'Mahons were at the fair of Garryowen yester-
day," said Lowry, musing. "I wonder could it be them
at all. I tell you there are bad boys among them. There
was one of 'em hanged for spiriting away a girl o' the
Hayeses before."
"If I thought it was one o' them," O'Connor exclaimed,
stretching his arm to its full length, and shaking his
clenched hand with great passion, "an' if I knew the one
that robbed me, I'd find him out, if he was as cunning
as a rabbit, an' I'd tear him between my two hands if he
was as strong as a horse. They think to play their game
on me because my hair is grey. But I can match the
villains yet. If steel, or fire, or pikes, or powder, can
match 'em, I'll do it. Let go my horse's bridle, an' don't
be holding me here when I should be flying like the wind
behind 'em."
Here he caught the eye of Kyrle Daly, as the latter
asked him whether he "had not laid informations before
a magistrate?"
Instead of answering, the old man, who now recognised
Daly for the first time, took off his hat with a smile in
which grief and anger were mingled with native courtesy,
and said, "Mr. Daly, a stoir," I ask your pardon for not
knowing you; I meant no offence to you, or to your
father's son. I couldn't do it. How are you, sir? How
is the masther an' the misthress? The Lord direct 'em,
an'spare 'em their children." Here the old man's eyes
grew watery, and the words were broken in his throat.
"Lay informations?" he continued, taking up Kyrle
Daly's question. "No-no, sir. My backt isn't so
;. in the country that I need to do so mean a thing as
that."
"And what other course would you take to obtain
Justice?"
"I'll tell you the justice I'd want," said O'Connor,
gripping his stick hard, and knitting his brows together,
while the very beard bristled upon his chin for anger.
"To plant him overright me in the heart of Garryowen
fair, or where else he'd like, an' give him a stick, an'

let me pick justice out of his four bones 1" | Here he
indulged himself with one rapid flourish of the blackthorn
stick above his head, which considerably endangered
that of the young gentleman to whom he addressed
bimself."
At the same moment a neighbour of O'Connor's galloped
up to them and exclaimed, "Well, Mihil, agra, any tidings
of her yet?"
"Sorrow tale or tidings."
"An' is it here you're stoppin', talkin', an' them villains
spiriting your daughter away through the country? Wisha,
but you're a droll man, this day."
Not Hamlet, in that exquisitely natural burst of passion
over the tomb of "the fair Ophelia"where he becomes
incensed against the affectionate Laertes for "the bravery
of his grief," and treats it as an infringement of his own
prerogative of sorrownot Hamlet the Dane, in that
moment of "towering passion," could throw more loftiness
of rebuke into his glance, than did Mihil O'Connor, as he
gazed upon the daring clansman who had thus presumed
to call his fatherly affection to account. More temperate,
however, than the Danish Prince, he did not let his anger
loose, but compressed his teeth, and puffed it forth between
them. Touching his hat to Kyrle, and bidding Lowry
"stand his friend," he put spurs to his horse, and rode
forwards, followed by his friend; while Lowry laid his
hand on the hair-cutter's arm, and asked him for an
account of the particulars.
"Sonuher" to me if I know the half of it," said the foe
of unshaven chins, speaking in a shrill, professional accent,
"but I was standing in my little place, above, shaving a
boy o' the Downeses against the benefit at Batt Coonerty's,
an' being delayed a good while (for the Downeses have all
very strong hairI'd as lieve be shaving a horse as one
of 'em), I was sthrappin' my razhor (for the twentieth
turn), and lookin' out into the fair, when who should I
see going by only Eily O'Connor, an' she dressed in a
blue mantle, with the hood over her head, an' her hair
curling down about her neck like strings of goold. (Oh,

the beauty o' that girl () Well, 'It's a late walk you're
taking, Eily,' says I. She made me no answer, only
passed on, an' I thought no more about it till this morn-
ing, when her father walked in to me. I thought, at
first, 'tis to be shaved he was coming, for, dear knows, he
wanted it, when all at once he opened upon me in regard
of his daughter. Poor girl, I'm sure sorrow call had I
to her goin' or stayin' more than I had to curl the
Princess Royal's fronta job that'll never trouble me,
I'm thinking."
"Wisha, but it's a droll business l' ejaculated Lowry,
letting go the stirrup leather, which he had held fast dur-
ing the foregoing narrative. "Ride on after him, Dunat,
or you won't catch him before night. Oh, vo! vo! Eily,
a stoir. Oh, wirra, Eily; this is the black day to your
ould father 1"
"An' the black an' blue day to me, I'm sure," squeaked
out the hair-cutter, trotting forwards, and groaning aloud
at every motion, as he was now thrown on the pommel,
now on the hind-bow of the saddle; those grievances
telling the more severely as he was a lean little man, and
but scantily furnished by nature with that material which
is best able to resist concussion. -
The misfortune of the poor rope-maker indisposed
Lowry (who had once been a respectful and distant
admirer of the lovely Eily) from proceeding with the
conversation; and his young master had ample leisure
for the indulgence of his own luxurious reveries, until
they reached the entrance to the fair demesne of Castle
Chute.

loved. The necessities of our narrative forbid us to
dwell at a more ample length on the mere description of
a landscape.
To his surprise, and, in some degree, to his disappoint-
ment, he found the castle more crowded with company
than he had expected. He was admitted by a richly-
ornamented Gothic archway, while Lowry remained walk-
ing his horse under the shade of the trees. A handsome,
though rather ill-used curricle, which appeared to have
been lately driven, was drawn up on the gravel plat; and
a servant, in tarnished livery, was employed in cooling
two horses on the slope which shelved downward to the
riverside. The foam that flecked their shining necks,
and covered the curbs and branches, showed that they
had been ridden a considerable distance, and by no spar-
ing masters.
"Oh, murther, Master Kyrle, is this you?" exclaimed
Falvey, the servant boy, as he looked into the narrow
hall and recognised the young "collegian." "Ma grine
chree hul it's an opening to the heart to see you !"
"Thank you, Pat. Are the ladies at home?"
"They are, sir. Oh, murther, murther 1 are you come
at last, sir?" he repeated, with an air of smiling wonder;
then suddenly changing his manner, and nodding with
great freedom and cunning, "Oh, the ladies?they are
at home, sir, both of 'em."
"And well ?"
"And well. I give praiseboth of 'em well; where is
the horse, sir?"
"Lowry is walking him near the shrubbery."
"An' is Lowry come, too? Oh, murther, murther l"
He ran to the door and looked out, nodded, and raised
his hand in courtesy, and then hastened back to Kyrle
"Gi' me the hat, sir, an' I'll hang it uppoof, it's full o'
dustcome in here, Masther Kyrle, an' I'll give you a
touch before you go upstairs; there's a power o' quollity

his head with a knowing smile"there's reasons for
doin's; the ladies must be plaised, surely. An' how is

"They are all well, Pat, thank you."
"The Lord keep 'em so! There's a sight above stairs
in the new house. Mr. Cregan, of Roaring Hall (ah,
that's a rale sporting gentleman), an' Mr. Creagh, an'
Pincher, an' Doctor Lake, an' the officer, westwards;"
then, with another familiar wink, "there's the drollest
cratur in life in the servants' hall abroad, the Officer's
sarvent-boy, a Londoner, afeerd o' the world that he'll
have his throat cut be the Whiteboys before he quits the
country. Poor cratur, he makes me laugh the way he
talks of Ireland, as if he was a marked man among us,
the little sprissawneen, that nobody ever would trouble
their heads aboutcoming !"a bell rang"That's for
the luncheon; I must smarten myself, or Miss Anne will
kill me. They're all going off, after they take something,
to the races near the point below, where they're to have
the greatest divarsion ever you hear; an' so the master
is well, eastwards? why then I'm glad to hear it; that's
a good gettleman as ever sat down to his own table"
the bell rang again"Oh, murther; there's the bell
again; I'll be kilt entirely I There now, Master Kyrle,
you're purty well, I think; they're all upstairs in the
drawin'-room in the new house. I need not tell you the
way. Syl Carney will open the doore for you, an' I'll
wait aisy a minute, for it wouldn't look seemly for me to
be takin' in the thray and things close behind you."
While this communicative retainer slipped away, nap-
kin in hand, to the pantry, Kyrle Daly ascended a cork-
screw flight of narrow stone steps, at the head of which
he was met by the blooming handmaiden above named.
Here he had as many "Masther Kyrle's" and pretty smiles,
and officious, though kindly meant, attentions to undergo,
as in the narrow hall. These he repaid in the usual
manner, by complimenting Syl on her good looks
wondering she had not got married, and reminding her
that Shrovetide would be shortly coming round again;
in return for which the pretty Syl repeatedly told him
he was "a funny gentleman" and "a great play-
oy."
They passed through an old hanqueting room which

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 75
had once formed the scene of a council of the Munster
chieftains in the days of Elizabeth, and descending a
flight of a few wooden steps, stood in the centre of a
lobby of much more modern architecture. Here Kyrle
Daly felt his heart beat a little wildly, as he heard voices
and laughter in the adjoining room. Modestly conscious,
however, of his graceful person, and aware of the import-
ance of displaying it to some advantage in the eyes of his
mistress, he adjusted his ruffles, and, with something like
the feeling of a young debutant, conscious of merit, yet
afraid of censure, made his entrance on the little domestic
Scene.
The company all rose and received him with that pom-
pous display of affability and attention which our fathers
mistook for politeness, but which their wiser descendants
have discovered to be the exact contrary, and discarded
from the drawing-room as unbefitting the ease and sin-
cerity of social life. Mrs. Chute was unable to rise, but
her greeting was at once cordial and dignified. Anne
gave him her hand with the air of an affectionate relative;
Mr. Hyland Creagh placed his heels together, adjusted
his ample shirt frills, and bowed until the queue of his
powdered wig culminated to the zenith; while Pincher
wagged his tail, looked up at his master as if to inquire
the nature of his movements, and finally coiled himself
up on the carpet and slept; Mr. Barnaby Cregan gripped
his hand until the bones cracked, expressing, in very con-
cise language, a wish that his soul might be doomed to
everlasting misery in the next world if he were not re-
joiced to see him; Doctor Leake tendered him a finger,
which Kyrle grasped hard, and (in revenge, perhaps, for
the punishment inflicted on him by Cregan) shook with
so lively an expression of regard, that the worthy physician
was tempted to repent his condescension. To the young
officer, an Englishman, Kyrle was introduced by the
formal course of "Captain Gibson, Mr. DalyMr. Daly,
Captain Gibson," on which they bowed as coldly and
stiffly as the figures in a clockmaker's window in Holborn,
and all resumed their places.
After the usual inquiries into the condition of both

families had been made and answered, Kyrle Daly indulged
himself in a brief perusal of the personal appearance of the
individuals in whose society he was placed. The informa.
tion which he derived from the few glances that happened
to fall wide of Miss Chute, shall here be laid before the
reader.
Mrs. Chute, the venerable lady of the mansion, was
seated in a richly carved arm-chair, near an ebony work
table, on which were placed a pair of silver spectacles and
the last racing calendar. A gold-headed cane rested
against her chair, and a small spaniel, in the attitude
which heralds term couchant, lay at her side, burlesquing
the lion of Britannia in the popular emblem. In her
more youthful days, indeed, Mrs. Chute might have
assumed her part in the latter without exciting any ludi-
crous association; and even in this decay and moulder-
ing of her womanly attractions, there was a grace, a
dignity, a softened fire, and even a beauty, to be traced,
which awakened the spectator's respect, and sometimes
warmed it into admiration. Old age, while it took nothing
away from her dignity, had imparted to her manner that
air of feminine dependence in which she was said to have
been somewhat too deficient in her youth, and replaced
in tenderness and interest the beauty which it had
removed.
Her daughter, who bore a very perceptible resemblance
to the old lady in the cast of her features, as well as in
their expression, looked at this moment exceedingly
beautiful. A dark-blue riding-dress displayed her figure
to such advantage, that if a young sculptor could have
taken it as a model for a study of Minerva, and could
likewise afford a lobster and a bottle of sherry to a critic
in the "Fine Arts," there is little doubt that he would
make his fortune. Her hair, which was shining black, cut
short, and curled so gracefully that it might vie with the
finest head in Mr. Hope's book of costumes, crept out from
beneath her small round hat, and shaded a countenance
that glowed at this moment with a sweet and fascinating
cheerfulness.
The common herd of mankind frequently exhibit

personal anomalies of so curious a description as to
remind one of Quevedo's fanciful vision of the general
resurrection, where one man, in his hurry, claps his
neighbour's head upon his own shoulders, and the upper
portion of a turtle-fed alderman is borne along by the
trembling shanks of a starveling magazine poet. But
nothing of that incongruity was observable in the
charming person of the heiress of Castle Chute. Her
countenance was exquisitely adapted both in form and
character to the rest of her frame; and she might be
justly admired as a piece of workmanship not entrusted
by Nature (as in a pin manufactory) to the hands of nine
journeymen, but wrought out and polished by that great
adept herself as a sample of womankind for the inspec-
tion of customers.
It was, indeed, remarked by those who enjoyed only a
visiting acquaintance with Anne Chute, that her general
manner was cold and distant, and that there was, in the
wintry lustre of her large black eyes and the noble car-
riage of her fine person, a loftiness which repelled in the
spectator's breast that enthusiasm which her beauty was
calculated to awaken, and induced him to stop short at
the feeling of simple admiration. Hardress Cregan, who,
with all his shyness, had the reputation of being a fine
critic on these subjects, had been heard to say of her on
his return from college, that she "was perfect. Her form
and face were absolutely faultless, and a connoisseur
might, with a better taste, pretend to discover a fault in
the proportions of the Temple of Theseus. But there,"
he added, "I must terminate the eulogy; for I could no
SQoner think of loving such a piece of frost-work, than of
flinging my arms in ecstasy around one of the Doric pillars
of the old edifice itself."
But Hardress Cregan had been only once, and for a
y minutes, in the lady's company, when he pronounced
this judgment. Neither was he an impartial observer,
for the embarrassment which he experienced in conse.
quence of her unconscious dignity, made him throw more
asperity into his criticism than the occasion actually re-
quired. Those who enjoyed a longer and a nearer inti-

macy with Miss Chute, found an additional fascination in
that very coldness which kept ordinary acquaintances at
a distance, and which for them was so cheerfully and so
winningly removed. In proportion to the awe which it
inspired on a first introduction, was the delight occasioned
by its subsequent dissipation; and it gave to her whole
character that effect of surprise which is dangerous or
available to the influence of the fair possessor, according
as the changes which it reveals are attractive or otherwise.
The feelings which accompanied a growing intimacy with
this lovely girl resembled those of one who endeavours,
by a feeble light, to discover the graces of a landscape
which he knows to be beautiful, but which he is unable
to appreciate until the morning light streams in upon the
picture, and brings it forth in all its exquisite reality before
his eyes.
The remainder of the company are not so interesting
as to claim an equal portion of the reader's notice. Mr.
Barnaby Cregan, a stout, top-booted old gentleman, with
a nose that told tales of many a rousing night, was seated
close to Mrs. Chute, and deeply engaged in a discussion
upon cocks and cockrels, sparring, setting, impounding,
the long law, the short law, and every other law that had
any connexion with his reigning passion. The rosy and
red-coated Captain Gibson, who was a person of talent
and industry in his profession, was listening with much
interest to Dr. Lucas Leake, who possessed some little
antiquarian skill in Irish remains, and who was at this
moment unfolding the difference which existed between
the tactics of King Lugh-Lamb-Fada and those issued
from his late most gracious Majesty's War-office; between
one of King Malachy's hobbilers and a life-guardsman;
between an English halberd and a stone-headed gai-bulg;
and between his own commission of lieutenant and the
Fear Comhlan Caoguid of the Fion Erin.
Mr. Hyland Creagh, who, as before mentioned, not-
withstanding the perfect maturity of his years, still con-
tinued to affect the man of gallantry, was standing near
Miss Chute, and looking with a half-puzzled, half-smiling
air over a drawing which she had placed in his hands.
## p. 79 (#83) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 79
Now and then, as he held the picture to the light, he
looked askance, and with a forbidding expression at
Kyrle, who was carelessly sauntering towards the fait
object of his attentions, and yet endeavouring to give his
approximation rather the appearance of accident than of
design. Mr. Creagh's experience in society had long
since made him aware that youth was a quality which
contributed materially to success with the ladies, and
the consequence of this discovery was a hearty detesta-
tion(a term more qualified would not express the feel-
ing)of every gentleman who was younger than himself.
"Puppies " he would exclaim, "they assume the air and
port of men when they should be confined to bibs and
frills, and bestride a blood-horse when their highest corvet
should be made in the hall, on their grandfather's walk-
ing-cane." But he had the mortification to find that his
sentiments on this head were adopted by no unmarried
ladies, except those whose wisdom and experience were
equal to his own; and about their opinions, unhappilly,
Mr. Creagh was as indifferent as the young coxcombs
whom he censured.
"I profess my ignorance," he said, after contemplating
the picture for several minutes. The drawing is admir-
able; the colouring has a depth and softness of tone that
I have seen rarely produced by water-colours; and the
whole design bears the stamp of reality upon it; but I
profess my ignorance of the place which you say it is
intended to represent."
"Indeed!" said Anne, affecting a disappointed tone,
and pleased to put the old gentleman's gallantry to the
torture; "then I must have made a sad failure, for the
scene ought to be quite familiar to you."
"I am the worst person in the world at tracing a
resemblance," said Mr. Creagh, looking puzzled. "Per-
haps it is meant for Ballylin Point?"
"Oh, Mr. Creagh, can you find any resemblance?
What a wretched bungler you must think me ! ...You did
well to say meant forthat expression indicates so
exactly the degree of relation between my sketches and
the originals."
## p. 80 (#84) ##############################################
8o THE COLLEEN BAWn.
"'Pon my honour, Miss Chute'pon my honour, as a
gentleman."
"Mr. Daly." Kyrle flew to her side. "Perhaps you
could restore 1, 2 to my self-esteem. Do you know that
Mr. Creagh has mistaken this for a sketch of Ballylin
Point? Try if you can restore my credit, for it is sinking
very fast, even in my own estimation."
"Ballylin Point l'exclaimed Kyrle, taking the drawing
into his hands"I do not see the least resemblance."
Mr. Creagh's eyes flashed fire at this unceremonious
declaration; but he checked his resentment, and con-
gratulated Miss Chute on this proof, that the fault lay in
his want of observation, not in her want of skill."
"And do you recognise the scene?" continued Miss
Chute, who was well aware of the old servente's foible,
and loved to toy with it for her amusement. "Let me
hear if I have been, indeed, so very unsuccessful."
Her lover delayed answering, not because he shared
the difficulty of Mr. Creagh, but that he was wrapt in
admiration of the drawing. It was an interesting land-
scape, and finished with more taste and fineness of touch
than are usually to be traced in the efforts of accomplished
young ladies. The foreground of the picture exhibited a
grassy slope, which formed a kind of peninsula in a
magnificent sheet of water, running a little to the left,
and terminating at what artists term the middle distance
in a gracefully-wooded point. The remains of an old
tastle appeared among the trees, the gloom and majesty
of which were exhibited, in a striking degree, by a bril-
liant effect of sunshine on the water and on the green
slope above mentioned. Two small islands, affording an
anchorage to some open boats, broke the expanse of
water on the right; while the small bay, formed by the
point before described on the left, was graced by the
figures of fishermen in the act of casting their nets. The
waters were bounded in the distance by a range of blue
hills, some of which projected into rocky or wooded
headlands; while the whole was softened by that deep
and rich blue tint which is peculiar to the moist atmos-
phere of the climate; and by imparting at once distinct-

ness and softness to the landscape, is far better adapted
to the scenes of rural solitude than even the lonely splen-
dour of a Tuscan sun.
"Ballylin?" echoed Mr. Cregan, who had walked over
to look at the drawing. ""Tis as like Ballylin as Roaring
Hall is to Dublin Castle. 'Tis Castle Chute, and right
well touched off too, by jingo." To this observation he
added, in language which the altered customs of society
prevent our copying verbatim, that he wished the spiritual
foe of the human race might lay hold of him if it were
not an admirable resemblance.
Mr. Creagh had his own reasons for not taking offence
at any opinion that was urged by his good friend and
frequent host, Mr. Cregan ; but he did not forget the
difference of opinion that was hazarded by his young
acquaintance. To the fair artist's raillery he replied
with a bow, and an old-fashioned politeness, that, "fre-
quently as he had the honour of visiting Castle Chute,
he was yet unfamiliar with the scenery, for his thoughts
on approaching it were exclusively occupied by one
object."
"And even though they were at liberty," added Kyrle,
"it is more than probable Mr. Creagh has never seen
Castle Chute at this point of view, so that it could hardly
be expected to remain on his recollection." Then moving
closer to Anne, and speaking in a lower tone of voice, he
said: "This is the very scene of which I told you Hardress
Sregan was so enthusiastic an admirer. You have drawn
1t since?"
Miss Chute answered in the affirmative, and, turning
quickly away, replaced the sketch in her portfolio. Then,
turning to Creagh, she told him that he would be very
shortly qualified to give an opinion as to the fidelity of
er design, for they would pass the spot in question, on
eir way to the little race-course. There was some
further conversation, not worth detailing, on the subject
Df Hardress Cregan's salute; and some conjectures were
hazarded concerning the female in the blue cloak, none
of which, however, threw any certain light upon that
mystery.

CHAPTER IX.
HOW MYLES MURPHY IS HEARD ON BEHALF OF HIS PONIES.
PAT FALVEY, supposing that he had remained a sufficient
time without to prevent the suspicion of any private
understanding between him and Mr. Daly, now made his
appearance with luncheon. A collared head, cream-
cheese, honey, a decanter of gooseberry wine, and some
garden fruit, were speedily arranged on the table, and the
visitors, no way loth, were pressed to make a liberal use
of the little banquet; for the time had not yet gone by
when people imagined that they could not display their
regard for a friend more effectually than by cramming him
up to the throat with food and strong drink. Kyrle Daly
was in the act of taking wine with Mrs. Chute, when he
observed Falvey stoop to his young mistress's ear, and
whisper something with a face of much seriousness.
"A boy wanting to speak to me?" said Miss Chute.
"Has he got letters? let him send up his message."
"He says he must see yourself, Miss. "Tis in regard
of some ponies of his that were impounded by Mr. Dawley
for trespassing above here, last night. He hasn't the
mains of releasing 'em, poor craythur, an' he's far from
home. I'm sure he's an honest boy. He says he'd
have a good friend in Mr. Cregan, if he knew he was
below."
"Me?" said Mr. Cregan, "why, what's the fellow's
name P"
"Myles Murphy, sir, from Killarney, westwards."
"O Myles-na-Coppaleen P Poor fellow, is he in tribu-
lation? We must have his ponies out by all means."
"It requires more courage than I can al-Yays command,"
said Miss Chute, "to revoke any command of Dawley's.
He is an old man, and, whether that he was crossed in
love, or from a natural peevishness of disposition, he is

such a morose creature, that I am quite afraid of him.
But I will hear this Myles at all events."
She was moving to the door when her uncle's voice
made her turn.
"Stay, Anne," said Mr. Cregan; "let him come up.
'Twill be as good as a play to hear him and the steward
ro and con. Kyrle Daly, here, who is intended for the
bar, will be our assessor, to decide on the points of law.
I can tell you, Kyrle, that Myles will give you a lessson
in the art of pleading, that may be of use to you on circuit
at one time or another."
Anne laughed, and looked to Mrs. Chute, who, with a
Smile of tolerating condescension, said, while she cleared
with a silken kerchief the glasses of her spectacles: "If
your uncle desires it, my love, I can see no objection.
Those mountaineers are amusing creatures."
Anne returned to her seat, and the conversation pro-
ceeded, while Falvey, with an air of great and perplexed
importance, went to summon Myles up stairs.
"Mountaineers I" exclaimed Captain Gibson. "You
call every upland a mountain here in Ireland, and every
one that lives out of sight of the sea, a mountaineer."
"But this fellow is a genuine mountaineer," cried Mr.
Cregan, "with a cabin two thousand feet above the level
of the sea. If you are in the country next week, and will
come down and see us at the lakes, along with our friends
here, I promise to show you as sturdy a race of moun-
taineers as any in Europe. Doctor Leake can give you a
history of 'em up to Noah's flood, some time when you're
alone togetherwhen the country was first peopled by
one Parable, or Sparable."
"Paralon," said Doctor Leake; "Paralon, or Migdonia,
as the Psalter sings:
'On the fourteenth day, being Tuesday,
They brought their bold ships to anchor,
In the blue fair port with beauteous shore,
Of well-defended Inver Sceine."
In the rest of Munster, where 2x

you come to Killarney," resumed Mr. Cregan, interrupting
the latter, to whose discourse a country residence, a
national turn of character, and a limited course of reading
had given a tinge of pedantry; and who was, moreover, a
* firm believer in all the ancient Shanachus, from the yellow
book of Moling to the black book of Molega. "And if
you like to listen to him, he'll explain to you every action
that ever befel, on land or water, from Ross Castle up to
Carrigaline."
Kyrle, who felt both surprise and concern at learning
that Miss Chute was leaving home so soon, and without
having thought it worth her while to make him aware of
her intention, was about to address her on the subject,
when the clatter of a pair of heavy and well-paved brogues
on the small flight of stairs in the lobby produced a sud-
den hush of expectation amongst the company. They
heard Pat Falvey urging some instructions, in a low and
smothered tone, to which a strong and not unmusical voice
replied, in that complaining accent which distinguishes the
dialect of the more western descendants of Heber: "Ah,
lay me alone, you foolish boy; do you think did I never
speak to quo/ity in my life before ?"
The door opened, and the uncommissioned master of
horse made his appearance. His appearance was at once
strikingly majestic and prepossessing, and the natural ease
and dignity with which he entered the room might almost
have become a peer of the realm coming to solicit the
interest of the family for an electioneering candidate. A
broad and sunny forehead, light and wavy hair, a blue
cheerful eye, a nose that in Persia might have won him a
throne, healthful cheeks, a mouth that was full of character,
and a well-knit and almost gigantic person, constituted his
external claims to attention, of which his lofty and confi-
dent, although most unassuming, carriage showed him to
be in some degree conscious. He wore a complete suit of
brown frieze, with a gay-coloured cotton handkerchief
around his neck, blue worsted stockings, and brogues
carefully greased, while he held in his right hand an
immaculate felt hat, the purchase of the preceding day's
fair. In the left he held a straight-handled whip and a
## p. 85 (#89) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 85
wooden rattle, which he used for the purpose of collecting
his ponies when they happened to straggle. An involun-
tary murmur of admiration ran amongst the guests at his
entrance. Doctor Leake was heard to pronounce him a
true Gadelian, and Captain Gibson thought he would cut
a splendid figure in a helmet and cuirass, under one of
the arches in the Horse-guards. ."
Before he had spoken, and while the door yet remained
open, Hyland Creagh roused Pincher with a chirping
noise, and gave him the well-known counter-sign of
"Baithershin "
Pincher waddled towards the door, raised himself on
his hind legs, closed it fast, and then trotted back to his
master's feet, followed by the staring and bewildered gaze
of the mountaineer.
"Well," he exclaimed, "that flogs cock-fighting 1 I
never thought I'd live to have a dog taich me manners,
any way. "Baithershin,' says he, an he shets the doore
like a Christian."
The mountaineer now commenced a series of most
profound obeisances to every individual of the company,
beginning with the ladies, and ending with the officer; after
which he remained glancing from one to another with a
smile of mingled sadness and courtesy, as if waiting, like
an evoked spirit, the spell-word of the enchantress who had
called him up. ""Tisn't manners to speak first before
quollity," was the answer he would have been prepared to
render, in case any one had inquired the motive of his
conduct.
"Well, Myles, what wind has brought you to this part
of the country?" said Mr. Barney Cregan.
"The ould wind always then, Mr. Cregan," said Myles,
with another deep obeisance, "seeing would I get a
feow o' the ponies off. Long life to you, sir; I was proud
to hear you wor above stairs, for it isn't the first time you
stood my friend in trouble. My father (the heavens be
his bed this day!) was a fosterer o' your uncle Mick's, an'
a first an' second cousin, be the mother's side, to Ould Mrs.
O'Leary, your honour's aunt, westward. So 'tis kind for
your honour to have a leanin' towards uz."
## p. 86 (#90) ##############################################
86 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"A clear case, Myles; but what have you to say to
Mrs. Chute about the trespass P"
"What have I to say to her? why, then, a deal. It's
a long while since I see her now, an' she wears finely, the
Lord bless her! Ah, Miss Anne!Oyeh, murther, mur-
ther | Sure I'd know that face all over the worldyour
own livin' image, ma'am (turning to Mrs. Chute), an' a
little dawney touch o' the masther (heaven rest his soul!)
about the chin, you'd think. My grandmother an' himself
wor third cousins. Oh, vol vo!"*
"He has made out three relations in the company
already," said Anne to Kyrle ; "could any courtier make
interest more skilfully?"
"Well, Myles, about the ponies?"
"Poor craturs, true for you, sir. There's Mr. Creagh
there, long life to him, knows how well I airn 'em for
ponies. You seen what trouble I had with 'em, Mr.
Creagh, the day you fought the jewel with young M"Far-
land from the north. They went skelping like mad over
the hills down to Glena, when they heerd the shot. Ah,
indeed, Mr. Creagh, you cowed the north countryman that
morning fairly. "My honour is satisfied,' says he, "if Mr.
Creagh will apologise." "I didn't come to the ground to
Apologise,' says Mr. Creagh ; "it's what I never done to
any man,' says he, "and it'll be long from me to do it to
you.' 'Well, my honour is satisfied any way,' says the
other, when he heerd the pistols cocking for a second
shot. I thought I'd split laughing."
"Pooh, pooh 1 nonsense, man," said Creagh, endea-
vouring to hide a smile of gratified vanity. "Your
unfortunate ponies will starve while you stay inventing
wild stories."
"He has gained another friend since," whispered Miss
Chute.
"Invent!" echoed the mountaineer. "There's Docthor

turning to the latter; "Old Keys, the piper, gives it up

to you, of all the docthors going, for curing his eyesight.
An' he has a great leaning to you, moreover, you're such
a fine Irishian."
"Another," said Miss Chute, apart.
"Yourself an'ould Mr. Daly," he continued. "I hope
the master is well in his health, sir?" (turning to Kyrle
with another profound conge), may the Lord fasten the
life in you an' him. That's a gentleman that wouldn't
see a poor boy in want of his supper or a bed to sleep
in' an' he far from his own people, nor persecute him in
regard of a little trespass that was done unknown."
"This fellow is irresistible," said Kyrle. "A perfect
Ulysses."
"And have you nothing to say to the Captain, Myles?
is he no relation of yours?"
"The Captain, Mr. Cregan P. Except in so far as we
are all servants of the Almighty and children of Adam, I
know of none. But I have a feeling for the red-coat, for
all. I have three brothers in the army, serving in
America; one of 'em was made a corporal, or an admiral,
or some ral or another, for behavin' well at Quaybec, the
time of Woulf's death. The English showed themselves
a great people that day, Surely."
Having thus secured to himself what lawyers calls "the
ear of the court," the mountaineer proceeded to plead the
cause of his ponies with much force and pathos, dwelling
on their distance from home, their wild habits of life, which
left them ignorant of the common rules of boundaries,
enclosures, and field-gates, setting forth with equal
emphasis the length of road they had travelled, their
hungry condition, and the barrenness of the common or,
which they had been turned out; and finally, urged in
mitigation of penalty, the circumstances of this being a
first offence, and the improbability of its being ever
renewed in future.
The surly old steward, Dan Dawley, was accordingly
summoned for the purpose of ordering the discharge of the
prisoners, a commission which he received with a face as
black as winter. Miss Anne might "folly her liking," he

said, "but it was the last time he'd ever trouble himself
about damage or trespass any more. What affair was it
of his if all the horses in the barony were turned loose
into the kitchen garden itself?"
"Iorses, do you call 'em P' exclaimed Myles, bending
on the old man a frown of dark remonstrance, "a parcel
of little ponies not the height o' that chair."
"What signify is it?" snarled the steward, "they'd
eat as much, an' more than a racer."
"Is it they, the craturs? They'd hardly injure a plate
of stirabout if it was put before 'em."
"Ayehl hugh!"
"An''tisn't what I'd expect from you, Mr. Dawley, to
be going again' a relation of your own in this manner."
"A relation o' mine !" growled Dawley, scarcely deign-
ing to cast a glance back over his shoulder as he hobbled
out of the room.
"Yes, then, o' yours."
Dawley paused at the door and looked back.
"Will you deny it o' me if you can," continued Myles,
fixing his eye on him, "that Biddy Nale, your own gossip,
an' Larry Foley worsecond cousins? Deny that o' me, if
you can."
"For what would I deny it?"
"Well, why? An' Larry Foley was uncle to my father's
first wife(the angels spread her bed this night!) An' I
tell you another thing, the Dawleys would cut a poor figure
in many a fair westwards, if they hadn't the Murphys to
back 'em, so they would; but what hurt? Sure you can
folly your own pleasure."
The old steward muttered something which nobody
could hear, and left the room. Myles of the Ponies,
after many profound bows to all his relations, and a pro-
fusion of thanks to the ladies, followed him, and was
observed in a few minutes after on the avenue talking
with much earnestness and apparent agitation to Lowry
Looby. Kyrle Daly, who remembered the story of the
mountaineer's misfortune at Owen's Garden, concluded
that Lowry was making him aware of the abduction of
the beautiful Eily, and felt a pang of sympathetic afflic-

tion for the poor fellow, in which probably no one else in
the room would have participated, at least not altogether
so deeply.
-
CHAPTER X.
HOW KYRLE DALY SPED IN HIS WOOING.
THE sun was in the west when the party arrived at the
bridle-road that turned off to the race-ground. To Kyrle
Daly's great delight, Mr. Cregan had taken his horse,
resigning to him the agreeable office of driving Anne
Chute in the curricle, while he rode forward with the
gentlemen. Seldom, indeed, I believe, did the wheels of
that vehicle enter so many ruts, or come in contact with
so many obstacles, as in this short drive, a circumstance
rather to be attributed to the perplexity of the driver's
mind, than to any deficiency of skill, or practice in his
hand.
None of the company knew, or indeed cared to be
informed, what the nature was of the conversation which
had passed between Miss Chute and her young escort on
the road. They observed, however, when the curricle
drew up, that Kyrle looked pale and flurried, and that his
manner was absent; while that of his fair companion was
marked by an unusual degree of seriousness, not unmingled
with confusion.
"What!" exclaimed Cregan, "you look as ruffled as if
you had been sparring. Get your huts in order, then, for
you must be set again before you come to the ground.
You have a quarter of a mile through the fields to travel
yet."
"Why, uncle, does not the road sweep by it?"
"No nearer than I tell you, and the curricle can go no
further. Come, Creagh, give my niece her little hunter,
and walk with me across the fields. Mr. Daly, I resign
your seat to you once more. A pretty stepping thing this

is of yours. I'd like to see her tried with ten or twelve
stone weight at a steeplechase."
"Do not," said Kyrle, in a low and earnest tone,
addressing Anne Chute, "do not, I entreat of you, deprive
me of this last opportunity. I would give the whole world
for a minute's conversation."
"I believe I shall walk, uncle," said the young lady,
with some hesitation, "and Mr. Daly is kind enough to
say he will accompany me on foot."
"With all my heart," cried the cock-fighter. "I re-
member the time, Daly, when I would not have given up
a walk through the fields with a fine girl, on a sunshiny
evening, for all the races in Munster. If Hepton Connolly
be on the ground, as his insolent groom tells me he is, I
will make him keep the staggeens at the starting-post until
you come up."
So saying, he rode on with the c-devant sweater, to
overtake the doctor and captain, who, he observed, had
grown as thick as two pickpockets since morning.
"I am afraid," said Kyrle, with a mixture of dignity
and disappointment in his manner, "I am afraid, Miss
Chute, that you will think this importunate, after what
you have already told me. But that rejection was so sud-
denI will not say so unexpectedthat I cannot avoid
entering more at length into the subject. Besides, it may,
it must be a long time before we shall meet again."
"I am sorry you should think that necessary, Mr.
Daly," said Anne; "I always liked you as a friend, and
there is not a person I know, whose society, in that light,
I could prize more highly ; but if you think it necessary
to your own peace of mind to remain away from us, it
would be very unreasonable in me to murmur. Yet, I
think and hope," she added, affecting a smiling air as she
looked round upon him, "that it will not be long before
we shall see you again with altered sentiments, and a mind
as much at ease as ever."
"You do me wrong, Anne !" said Kyrle, with sudden
passion. "I am not so ignorant of my own character as
to suppose that possible. No, Miss Chute. This is not
with me a boyish fancy, a predilection suddenly formed,

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 91
and capable of being just as suddenly laid aside. If you
had said this last summer, a few weeks after I first saw
you, the remark perhaps might have been made with
justice. I knew little of you then besides your beauty,
your talents, and your accomplishments; and I will say,
in justice to myself, that those qualities in any woman
never could so deeply fix or interest me as to produce
any lasting disquiet in my mind. But our acquaintance
has been since too much prolonged; I have seen you too
often ; I have known you too well; I have loved you
too deeply and too sincerely, to feel this disappointment
as anything less than a dreadful stroke. Let me entreat
you," he continued, with increasing warmth, and disre-
garding the efforts which Miss Chute made to interrupt
him, "let me implore you to recall that hasty negative.
You said you were unpreparedthat you did not expect
such a proposal from me. I do not press you to answer
at this moment; the torture of suspense itself is prefer-
able to absolute despair. Say you will think of it; say
anything rather than at once decide on mydestruction,
I cannot but call it."
"I must not, I will not act with so much injustice,'
said Anne, who was considerably distressed by the depth
of feeling that was evident in her lover's voice and
manner. "I should be treating you most unfairly, Mr.
Daly, if I did so. It is true that I did not expect such
a declaration as you have madenot in the least; but
my decision is taken notwithstanding. It is impossible I
can ever give you any other answer than you have already
received. Do not, I will entreat of you in my turn, give
way to any groundless expectationsany idea of a change
in my sentiments on this subject. It is as impossible we
should ever be united as if we lived in two separate
planets."
The unhappy suitor looked the very image of pale and
ghastly despair itself. His eye wandered, his cheek grew
wan, and every muscle in his face quivered with passion.
His words, for several moments, were so broken as to
approach a degree of incoherency, and his knees trembled
with a sickly faintness. He continued, nevertheless, to

urge his addresses. Might he not be favoured with Miss
Chute's reasons P Was there anything in his own con-
duct? Anything that might be altered 2 The dejection
that was in his accents as well as his appearance, touched
and almost terrified his obdurate mistress, and she took
some pains to alleviate his extreme despondency, without,
however, affording the slightest ground for a hope which
she felt could never be accomplished. The consolations
which she employed, were drawn rather from the proba-
bility of a change in his sentiments than her own.
"You are not in a condition," she said, "to judge of
the state of your own mind. Believe me, this depression
will not continue as you seem to fear. The Almighty is
too just to interweave any passion with our nature which
is not in the power of our reason to subdue."
"Ay, Anne," said Kyrle; "but there are some persons
for whose happiness the struggle is quite sufficient. I am
not so ignorant as you suppose of the effect of a dis-
appointment like this. I know that it will not be at all
times as violent and oppressive as I feel it at this
moment; but I know, too, that it will be as lasting as
life itself. I have often experienced a feeling of regret
that amounted to actual pain, in looking back to years
that have been distinguished by little beyond the cus-
tomary enjoyments of boyhood. Imagine, then, if you
can, whether I have reason to apprehend the arrival of
those hours when I shall sit alone in the evening, and
think of the time that was spent in your society?"
Miss Chute heard this speech with a feeling of deep
and even sympathetic emotion. As Kyrle ventured to
glance at her countenance, and observed the peculiar ex-
pression of her sorrow, the idea of a rival, which, till that
moment, had not once occurred to him, now flashed upon
his mind, and changed the current of his feelings to a
new direction. The sensation of jealousy was almost a
useful stimulant in the excessive dejection under which
he laboured.
"Will you forgive me," he said, "and take the present
state of my feelings as an apology, if there should be
anything offensive in the question I am about to ask
## p. 93 (#97) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 93
you? There can be only one reason for my rejection
which would save my pride, the mortification of believing
myself altogether unworthy. I should feel some consola-
tion in knowing that my own misery was instrumental to
your happiness; indeed, I should not think of breathing
another word upon the subject, if I thought that your
affections had been already engaged."
The agitation seemed now to have passed over to the
lady's side. Her brow became dark red, and then
returned to more than its accustomed whiteness. "I
have no other engagement," she said, after a pause, "if I
had, I should think it hardly fair to press such an inquiry;
but, I assure you, I have none. And since you have
spoken of my own views of life, I will be more explicit,
and confess to you, that I do not at present think it is
likely I shall ever contract any. I love my mother; and
her society is all that I desire or hope to enjoy at present.
Let me now entreat you as a friend, for my sake, as well
as your own, never again to renew any conversation on
this subject."
This was said in a tone of such decision, that Kyrle saw
it would be impossible, without hazarding the loss of the
young lady's friendship, to add another word of remon-
strance or of argument. Both, therefore, continued their
walk in silence, nor did they exchange even an indifferent
observation until they reached the summit of the little
slope from which the course was visible.
Their thoughts, however, were not subjected to the
same restriction, and the train of reflection, in either case,
was not calculated to awaken envy. !
"She received my question with embarrassment,"
thought Kyrle, "and she evaded a reply. I have a rival,
it is evident, and a favoured, at least, if not a declared
one. Well, if she is to be happy, I am content; but
unquestionably the most miserable contented man upon
the earth."
The lady's meditation also turned upon the same crisis
in the conversation. "All that I desire?" she mentally
repeated, quoting her own words to her rejected suitor.
"And have I so far conquered my own feelings as to be
## p. 94 (#98) ##############################################

capable, with perfect sincerity, of making an assertion
such as that? or, if it be sincere, am I sure that I run no
risk of disqualifying myself for retaining the same liberty
of mind by accepting my uncle's invitation ? But it is
not possible, surely, that my peace should be endangered
in the society of one who treats me with something more,
and colder, than indifference itself; and if it were, my
part is already taken, and it is now too late to retract.
Poor Kyrle! he wastes his eloquence in exciting my com-
miseration for a state of mind with which I have been
long and painfully conversant. If he knew how powerful
a sympathy my own experience had awakened for him, he
need not use an effort to increase it.
A loud shout of welcome, sent forth in honour of the
heiress of Castle Chute, and the lady-patroness of the
day's amusements, broke in upon these sombre medita-
tions, and called the attention of that lady and of her
downcast escort to a novel scene and new performers.
Clamoren immensum tollit, quo pontus et omnes
Intremuere undae, penitusque exterrita tellus
Momonia.
The sounds of greeting then sank into a babbling mur-
mur, and at last into a hush of expectation, similar to that
with which Pasta is welcomed at the Italian Opera, when
she comes forward to stop the mouths of the unintelligible
chorus, and to thrill the bright assembly with the frantic
sorrows of Medea.
The spot selected for the occasion was the shore of a
small bay, which was composed of a fine hard sand, that
afforded a very fair and level course for the horses. At
the farther end was a lofty pole, on the top of which was
suspended by the stirrup a new saddle, the destined
guerdon of the conqueror. A red handkerchief, stripped
from the neck of Dan Hourigan, the house carpenter, was
hoisted overhead, and a crowd of country people dressed,
notwithstanding the fineness of the day, in their heavy
frieze great-coats, stood round the winning-post, each
faction being resolved to see justice done to its own
representative in the match.
## p. 95 (#99) ##############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 95
A number of tents, composed of old sheets, bags, and
blankets, with a pole at the entrance, and a sheaf of reed,
a broken bottle, or a sod of turf, erected for a sign, were
discernible among the multitude that thronged the side of
the little rising ground before mentioned. High above
the rest, Mick Normal's sign-board waved in the rising
wind. Busy was the look of that lean old man, as he
bustled to and fro among his pigs, kegs, mugs, pots, and
porringers. A motley mass of felt hats, white muslin
caps and ribbons, Scarlet cloaks, and blue riding-jocks,
filled up the spaces between the tents, and moved in a
continual series of involutions, whirls, and eddies, like
those which are observable on the surface of a fountain
newly filled.
The horses were to start from the end of the bay,
opposite to the winning-post, go round Mick Normal's
tent, and the cowel on the hill-side, and returning to the
place from whence they came, run straight along the
sand for the saddle. This was to be the victor's prize.
Hic, qui forte velint rapido contendere cursu,
Invitat pretiis animos, et premia ponit.
The solatia victo were to be had at the rate of four-pence
a tumbler, at Mick Normal's tent.
A rejected lover can hardly be supposed to have any
predilection for the grotesque. Kyrle Daly, however,
observing that Miss Chute made an effort to appear dis-
embarrassed, and feeling, in the sincerity of his affection, a
sentiment of grief for the uneasiness he had occasioned
her, compelled himself to assume the appearance of his
usual good humour, and entered with some animation into
the spirit of the scene. Captain Gibson, who now ap-
proached them on foot, could not, with the recollections
of Ascot and Doncaster fresh in his mind, refrain from a
roar of laughter at almost every object he beheld; at the
condition of the horses; the serious and important look of
the riders; the Teniers appearance of the whole course;
the band, consisting of a blind fiddler, with a piece of
listing about his waist and another about his old hat; the
self-importance of the stewards, Tim Welsh, the baker,

and Batt Kennedy, the poet or janius of the village, as
they went in a jog trot round the course, collecting shil-
ling subscriptions to the saddle from all who appeared on
horse-back. -
"Well, Anne," said Mr. Cregan, riding up to the group,
"we have lost three of our company. Hepton Connolly
is gone off to fight a duel with some fellow from the
mountains that called him a scoundrel, and taken Creagh
with him for a second. That's the lad that'll see them
properly set. Doctor Leake has followed for the purpose
of stopping up any holes they may happen to make in
one another, so we have all the fun to ourselves. If
the doctor had stayed, we should have had so many ac-
counts of the sports of Tailten and all that. He is a very
learned little man, the doctor; I don't suppose there's so
long a head in the county; but he talks too much. Cap-
tain, I see you laugh a great deal, but you mustn't laugh
at our girls, though; there are some pretty bits o' muslin
here, I can tell you."
"I like them uncommonly," said the Captain; "their
dress, in particular, I think very becoming. The muslin
cap, with a ribbon tied under the chin and a pretty knot
above, is a very simple and rural head-dress; and the
scarlet cloak and hood, which seems to be a favourite
article of costume, gives a gay and flashy air to their
rustic assemblies. Look at that girl now, with the black
eyes, on the bankwhat a pretty modest dress that is
A handkerchief pinned across the bosom, a neat figured
gown, and check apron; but what demon whispered her
to case her little feet in black worsted stockings and
brogues?"
"They are better than the clouted shoes of the Con-
tinent," said Anne, "and durability must sometimes be
preferred to appearance."
"Why, that's Syl Carney, Anne," exclaimed Cregan.
"It is, sir. She has seen her beau somewhere on the
course, I will venture to say."
A roar of laughter from Captain Gibson here attracted
their attention.
"Look at that comical fellow on horseback," he cried;

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 97
"did you ever see such a pair of long legs with so small
a head P A fire-tongs would sit a horse as well. And
observe the jaunty way he carries the little head, and his
nods and winks at the girls. That's an excruciating
fellow! And the armsthe short armsl how the fellow
gathers up the bridle, and makes the lean animal hold up
his head, and jog airily forward. Is that fellow really
going to run for the stake?"
Kyrle Daly turned his eyes in the same direction, and
suffered them to dilate with an expression of astonish-
ment, when he beheld his own saucy Squire seated upon
the haircutter's mare, and endeavouring to screen himself
from his master's observation by keeping close to the side
of Batt Kennedy, the fanius ; while the latter recited
aloud a violent satire which he had made upon a rival
versifier in the neighbourhood. In fact, Lowry Looby,
understanding that Syl Carney was to be at the course,
and wishing to cut a figure in her eyes, had coaxed Foxy
Dunat "out of the loand of his mare for one hate,"
while that indifferent equestrian refreshed his galled per-
son with a "soft sate" on the green sod in Mick Normal's
tent.
Mr. Cregan here left the party with the view of assum-
ing his place as judge of the course at the winning-post;
while the staggeens with their riders moved forward,
surrounded by a dense and noisy crowd, to the starting-
post, near the elevation that was occupied by our three
friends.
"We are at a loss here," said Miss Chute, "for

liveliness, the accent of the boys who sell those bills at

am acquainted not only with the character of the heroes
who hold the reins, but with all the secret machinery of
intrigue which is expected to interfere with the fair
dealing of the day; I will, therefore, if you please, let
you into the most amusing parts of their history as they
pass."

Captain Gibson, with a fresh burst of laughter, pro-
tested that he would give the world for a peep into the
social policy of an Irish village."
"Well, then," said Anne, assuming a mock Ossianic
manner, "the first whom you see advancing on that poor
half-starved black mare, with the great lump on her knee,
and the hay-rope for a saddle-girth, is Jerry Cooley, our
village nailor, famed alike for his dexterity in shaping the
heads of his brads, and demolishing those of his ac-
quaintances. Renowned in war is Jerry, I can tell you
Gurtenaspig and Derrygortnacloghy re-echo with his
fame. Next to him, on that spavined grey horse, rides
John O'Reilly, our blacksmith, not less estimated in arms,
or rather in cudgels. Not silent, Captain Gibson, are
the walks of Garryowen on the deeds of John O'Reilly,
and the bogs of Ballinvoric quake when his name is
mentioned. A strength of arm, the result of their habi-
tual occupations, has rendered both these heroes formi.
dable among the belligerent factions of the village, but the
nailor is allowed a precedence. He is the great Achilles;
O'Reilly, the Telemon Ajax of the neighbourhood. And,
to follow up my Homeric parallels, close behind him, on
that long-backed, ungroomed creature, with the unname-
able colour, rides the crafty Ulysses of the assemblage,
Dan Hogan, the process-server. You may read some-
thing of his vocation in the sidelong glance of his eye,
and in the paltry, deprecating air of his whole demeanour.
He starts, as if afraid of a blow, whenever any one ad-
dresses him. As he is going to be married to Dooley's
sister, it is apprehended by the O'Reillys that he will
attempt to cross the blacksmith's mare; but the smoky
Achilles, who gets drunk with him every Saturday night,
has a full reliance on his friendship. Whether, however,
Cupid or Bacchus will have the more powerful influence
upon the process-server, is a question that I believe yet
remains a mystery even to himself; and I suspect he will
adopt the neutral part of doing all he can to win the
saddle for himself. The two who ride abreast behind
Hogan are mountaineers, of whose motives or intentions
I am not aware. The sixth and last is Lowry Looby, a

retainer of my friend, Mr. Daly's, and the man whose
appearance made you laugh so heartily a little while
since. He is the only romantic individual of the match.
He rides for love, and it is to the chatty disposition of
the lady of his affections, our own housemaid, that I am
indebted for all this information."
One would have thought the English officer was about
to die with laughter several times during the course of
this speech. He leaned, in the excess of his mirth, upon
the shoulder of Kyrle Daly, who, in spite of his depres-
sion, was compelled to join him, and placing his hand
against his forehead
laughed, sans intermission,
An hour by the dial.
The mere force of sympathy compelled the lady and
gentleman to lay aside for the moment their more serious
reflections, and adapt their spirits to the scene before
them. It seemed curious to Kyrle Daly, that, slightly as
he esteemed this new military acquaintance, he felt
jealous for the moment of the influence thus exercised by
the latter on the temper of Anne Chute, and wished at
the time that it were in his power to laugh as heartily as
Captain Gibson. But a huge diaphragm, though a useful
possession in general society, is not one that is most
likely to win the affections of a fine girl. In affairs of
the heart your mere laugher is a fool to your thinker
and sentimentalist.
Before the Captain could sufficiently recover himself
to make his acknowledgments for the entertainment
which Miss Chute had afforded him, a cry of "Clear the
coorse! clear the coorse !" resounded along the sand, and
the two stewards, the baker and the poet, came galloping
round at a furious rate, laying about them stoutly with
their cord-whips, while the horses scattered the sand and
pebbles in all directions with their hoofs, and the strag-
glers were seen running off to the main body of the
spectators, to avoid a fate similar to that sustained by
the victims of Juggernaut, in that pious procession to
which his Majesty's non-emancipating government so

largely and so liberally contribute. "Clear the coorse !"
shouted the baker, with as authoritative an accent as if
he were King Pharaoh's own royal dough-kneader.
"Clear the coorse !" sung the melodious Batt Kennedy
the favourite of the muses, as he spurred his broken-
winded Pegasus after the man of loaves; and of course,
the course was cleared and kept clear, less perhaps by the
violence of Tim Welsh than the amenity of Batt Ken-
nedy, who, though not a baker, was the more pithy and
flowery orator of the two.

good order, and with more zeal and eagerness in their
faces than was to be found in the limbs of the animals
which they bestrode. For a few moments the strife
seemed doubtful, and Victory hovered with an indecisive
wing, now over one helmet, and now over another. The
crowd of spectators, huddling together on a heap, with
faces that glowed and eyes that sparkled with intense
interest, encouraged the riders with shouts and exclama-
tions of hoarse and vehement applause. "Success |
success, Jerry l' "It's done; a half-pint wit you, Dan
Hogan wins !" "I depend my life upon John O'Reilly."
"Give her a loose, Lowry P and other expressions of a
similar nature.
But ere they again came round the winning-post, the
position of the horses was altered. O'Reilly rode in front
lashing his horse in the flank with as much force as if he
were pounding on his own anvil. Dooley, the nailor,
came close behind, drubbing his black mare's lean ribs
with the calves of his legs, as if designing to beat the
poor beast out of the last remnant of her wind. The
others followed, lashing their horses and one another.
## p. 101 (#105) ############################################

each abusing his neighbour in the grossest terms, all,
except Lowry Looby, who prudently kept out of harm's
way, keeping a loose rein in his hand, and giving th.
hair-cutter's mare the advantage of what jockeys term a
soa relief, indeed, of which the poor creature stood in
the utmost need. He was thus prepared to profit by
the accident which followed.
The blacksmith's grey horse started at a heap of sea-
weed, and suffered the nailor's mare to come down like a
thunderbolt upon his haunches. Both steeds fell, and
the process-server, who rode on their heels, falling foul of
them as they lay kicking on the sand, was compelled to
share in their prostration. This accident produced
among the fallen heroes a series of kicks and bruises, in
which the horses were not idle. O'Reilly, clenching his
hand, hit the nailor a straightforward blow between the
eyes, which so effectually interfered with the exercise of
those organs, that he returned the favour with a powerful
thrust in the abdomen of his own prostrate steed. For
this good office he was rewarded by the indignant quadru-
ped with a kick over the right ear, which made it unneces-
sary to inflict a second, and the quarrel remained between
the process-server and the blacksmith, who pummelled
one another as if they were pounding flax, and with as
much satisfaction as if they had never got drunk together
in their lives. They were at length separated and borne
from the ground, all covered with blood and sand, while
their horses, with much difficulty, were set upright on
their legs, and led off to the neighbouring slope.
In the meantime, our party observed Lowry Looby
returning from the winning-post, under the protection of
Mr. Cregan, with the saddle torn to fritters between his
hands, and his person exhibiting tokens of severe ill-usage.
He had contrived to outstrip the mountaineers, and had
obtained the prize; but the adverse factions, irritated at
beholding their laurels flourishing on a stranger's brow,
had collected around and dragged him from his horse,
alleging that it was an unfair heat, and that there should
be a second trial. Mr. Cregan, however, with some exer-
tion, succeeded in rescuing Lowry from their hands; but

not until every man in the crowd had put a mark upon
him by which he might be easily distinguished at any
future meeting.
Tired of that deafening uproar that surrounded him,
and longing for retirement, that he might brood at
leisure over his disappointment, Kyrle Daly now left the
course, notwithstanding the invitation of Anne Chute
that he would return and dine at the Castle. His
intention was, to spend the night at the cottage on one of
his father's dairy-farms, which lay at the distance of a
few miles lower on the river-side, and where one neat
room was always kept in order for his use, whenever he
joined Hardress Cregan in a shooting excursion towards
the mouth of the stream. Hardress had promised to
visit him at this cottage a few weeks before, and as he
knew that his young friend must have come to an anchor
in waiting for the tide, he judged it not unlikely that he
might see him this very night. He had now an addi-
tional reason for desiring to hold conversation with
Hardress, in order that he might receive the consolations
of his friendship under his own disappointment, and, if
possible, obtain some knowledge of the true condition of
his mistress's affections.
Lowry Looby, once more reduced to his legs, followed
him at a distance somewhat more considerable than that
recommended by Dean Swift as proper to be observed
by gentlemen's gentlemen. He lingered only to restore
the mare to Foxy Dunat, presenting him at the same
time with the mutilated saddle, and absolutely de.
clining the hair-cutter's proposal of "traiting him to the
best that the Cat an' Bagpipes could afford." After
which conversation the two friends threw their arms
about each other's neck, kissed, as in France, and sepa-
rated.
The night had fallen before Kyrle alighted at the cot-
tage door. Mrs. Frawley, the dairy-woman, had been
provident enough to light a fire in the little yellow room,
and to place beside it the arm-chair and small painted
table, with the volume of Blackstone which her young
master was accustomed to look into in the evening. The

night, she observed, "was smart enough to make an air
o' the fire no unpleasant thing; and even if it were not
cold, a fire was company when one would be alone that
way." With equal foresight, she had prepared the
materials for a tolerable dinner, such as a hungry man
might not contemn without trial.
Whether it were the mere effect of custom, or an indi-
cation of actual and unromantic appetite, the eye of our
desponding lover was not displeased, on entering the little
parlour, to see the table decorated with a snow-white
damask cloth, a cooler of the sweetest butter, a small
cold ham, and an empty space which he knew to be
destined for a roast duck or chickens. There is no time
at which the heart is more disposed to estimate in a pro-
per light the comforts of home and a quiet fireside, than
when it has experienced some severe rejection in society;
and it was with the feeling of one who, after much and
harassing annoyance, encounters a sudden refuge, that our
drooping traveller flung himself into the chair, and
exclaimed in the words of Oriana:-
"Though but a shadow, but a sliding,
Let me know some little joy.
We that suffer long annoy,
Are contented with a thought,
Through an idle fancy wrought.
Oh, let my joys have some abiding !"
While Mrs. Frawley superintended the dressing of the
fowl in the kitchen, much wondering at the forlorn and
absent air with which her officious attentions were
received by the young collegian, that meditative gentle-
man was endeavouring to concentrate his attention on
the pages of the learned work that lay before him. His
eyes wandered over the concise and lucid detail of the
reciprocal rights of baron and eme; but what purpose
could this answer, except to remind him that he could
never claim the lovely Anne Chute as his feme, nor would
the lovely Anne Chute consent to acknowledge him as
her baron. He closed the volume, and laying it on the

to 4 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
The silence of the place was favourable to that sort of
drowsy musing in which the mind delights to repose its
energies after any strong and passionate excitement.
There was no effort made to invite or pursue a particular
train of reflection; but those thoughts which lay nearest
to the heartthose memories, hopes, fears, and wishes,
with which they were most intimately associated, passed
in long and still procession before his mind. It was a
dreary and funeral train to witness, but yet the lover
found a luxurious indulgence in its contemplation. He
remained gazing on the fire, with his hand supporting his
temple, until every crackling turf and fagot became
blended in his thoughts with the figures which his
memory called up from the past, or his fancy created for
the future.
While he leaned thus silent in his chair, he overheard
in the adjoining kitchen a conversation, which for the
moment diverted his attention from the condition of his
own fortunes.
"Where to are you running in such a hurry, Mary 2"
said Mrs. Frawley, "one would think it was for the seed
o' the fire you come. Sit down again."
"Oh, wisha," said a strange voice, "I'm tired from sit
ting. Is it to look after the butter Mr. Kyrle is come
down to ye?"
"Oyeh, no. He doesn't meddle in them things at all.
If he did we'd have a bad story to tell him. You'll burn
that duck, Nelly, if you don't mind it."
"Why, soa bad story, Mrs. Frawley?"
"I'll tell you, Mary. I don't know what the reason of
it is, but our butter is going from us this two months now.
I'd almost take the vestment" of it, that Mr. Enright's
dairyman, Bill Noonan made a pishog,f and took away
our butter."

prevailed to a similar degree in the country parts of England. In

self told me they had double their complement last week,
at a time when, if we were to break our hearts churning
from this till doomsday, we could get nothing but the
buttermilk in the latter end."
"Did you watch your cows last May-eve, to see that
nobody milked 'em from ye?"
"I did to be sure. I sat up until twelve o'clock, to
have the first milk myself; for Shaun Lauther, the fairy
doctor, told me that if another milked 'em that night,
she'd have their butter the whole year round. And what
good was it for me? I wouldn't wonder if old Moll
Noonan had a hand in it."
"Nor I neither. They say she's a witch. Did I ever
tell you what Davy Neal's wife did to her of a time?"
"Not as I know."
"The same way as with yourself, the butterno, tisn't
the butter but the milk itself, was going from Katty Neal,
although her little cow was a kind of Kerry, and had the
best of grazing. Well, she went, as you done, to Shaun
Lauther, the knowledgeable man, and put a half-a-crown
into his hand, and asked his advice. 'Well, tell me,'
says Shaun, "were you at Moll Noonan's yesterday?' 'I
was,' says Kate. . "And did you see a hair spancel hang-

says Kate. 'Well," says Shaun, "'tis out of that spancel
that Moll do be milking your cows every night, by her

dry udder the same time." "And what am I to do?"
says Kate. "I'll tell you," says he. "Go home and

you're milking, that a grey cat will sit by you on the

ness will be done.' Well, she did his bidding. She saw
the grey cat, and burnt her with the shoe, till she flew
screeching over the hedge."
"Oh, murther, hadn't she the courage?"
"She had. Well, the next day she went to Moll
Noonan's, and found her keeping her bed, with a great
scald she said she got from a pot of boiling water she had
down for scalding the keelers. Ayeh, thought Kate, I
know what ails you well, my old lady. But she said
nothing, and I'll engage she had the fine can o' milk from
her cows next morning."
"Well, she was a great girl."
"Ah, what should ail her?" said Nelly, the servant
wench, who was employed in turning the duck. "I
remember Jug Flannigan, the cooper's wife, above, was
in the same way losin' all her butter, an' she got it again
by puttin' a taste o' the last year's butter into the churn,
before churnin' along with the crame, and into every
keeler in the house. Here, Mrs. Frawley, will you have
an eye to the spit a minute while I go look at them hens
in the coob abroad P Master Kyrle might like a fresh egg
for his tay, an' I hear them clockin'."
"Do, then, Nell, a'ra gal, and, as you're going, turn in
the turkeys, for the wind is rising, and I'm in dread it will
be a bad night."
A loud knocking at the door was the next sound that
invaded the ear of Kyrle Daly. The bolt flew back, and
a stranger rushed in, while, at the same moment, a gust of
wind and rain dashed the door with violence against the
wall, and caused a cloud of smoke and ashes to penetrate
even to the room in which he sat.
"Shut out the doore 1 shut out the doore l'" Screamed
Mrs. Frawley, "the duck will be all destroyed from the
ashes. Ah, Lowry, what kep' you till now."
"Oh, let me alone, woman," exclaimed Lowry, in a
loud and agitated voice. "Where's Masther Kyrle?"
"Sitting in the parlour within. What's the matter,
eroo P"
Without making any reply, Lowry Looby presented him-
self at the parlour door, and waving his hand with much

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 107
force, exclaimed: "Come out! come out! Masther Kyrle.
There's the Nora Creina abroad just goin' down, and
every soul aboard of her. She never will reach the shore.
Oh, vo! vol 'tis frightful to see the swell that's round
her. The Lord in His mercy stretch out His hand upon
the wathers this fearful night !"
Kyrle started up in alarm, snatched his hat, and rushed
out of the room, not paying any attention to the recom-
mendation of Mrs. Frawley, that he would throw the frieze
riding-coat over his shoulders before he went out in the
rain. Lowry Looby, with many ejaculations of terror and
of compassion, followed his master to the shore, within a
gun-shot of which the cottage was situated. They arrested
their steps on a rocky point, which, jutting far into the
river, commanded a wide prospect on either side. It was
covered with wet sea-weed and shell-fish, and afforded a
slippery footing to the young collegian and his squire. A
small fishing boat lay at anchor on the leeward side of the
point, and her crew, consisting of a Swarthy old man
and a youth, were standing on the shore, and watching
the pleasure-boat with much interest.

CHAPTER XII.
HOW FORTUNE BRINGS Two OLD FRIENDS TOGETHER.
THE situation of the little vessel was in reality terrific.
A fierce westerly wind, encountering the receding tide,
occasioned a prodigious swell in the centre of the
channel; and even near the shore the waves lashed them-
selves with so much fury against the rocky headland
before mentioned, that Kyrle and his servant were covered
with spray and foam. There was yet sufficient twilight in
the sky to enable them to discern objects on the river,
and the full autumnal moon, which ever and anon shot,
like a flying ghost, from one dark mass of vapour to
another, revealed them at intervals with a distinctness
scarcely inferior to that of day. The object of the
## p. 108 (#112) ############################################
Io9 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
pleasure-boat seemed to be that of reaching the anchorage
above alluded to, and, with this view, the helmsman held
her head as close to the wind as a reefed mainsail and
heavy swell would allow him. The white canvas, as the
boat came foaming and roaring towards the spectators,
appeared half-drenched in brine, from the breaking of the
sea against the windward bow.
The appearance of the vessel was such as to draw
frequent ejaculations of compassion from Lowry and the
boatmen, and to make Kyrle Daly's heart sink low with
fear and anxiety. At one time she was seen on the ridge
of a broken wave, showing her keel to the moonlight, and
bending her white and glistening sails over the dark gulf
upon her lee.
At another the liquid mountain rolled away, and left
her buried in the trough, while her vane alone was visible
to the landsmen, and the Surges, leaping and whitening in
the moonshine, seemed hurrying to overwhelm and engulf
their victim. Again, however, suddenly emerging into
the light, she seemed to ride the waters in derision, and
left the angry monsters roaring in her wake.
"She never'll do it, I'm in dread," said Lowry,
bending an inquisitive glance on the boatman. The
latter was viewing intently, and with a grim smile, the
gallant battle made by the little vessel against the
elements.
"'Tis a good boy that has the rudder in his hand,"
he said; "and as for their lives, 'tis the same Lord that
is on the water as on the land. When their hour is come,
on sea or shore, 'tis all the same to 'em. I wouldn't
wondher if he done it yet. Ah, that swell put him off of
it. He must make another tack. 'Tis a good boy that
houlds the rudder."
"What l" exclaimed Kyrle, "do you think it will be
necessary for them to put out into the tide again?"
"Indeed, I don't say she'll ever do without it," said
the old boatman, still keeping his eyes fixed on the
Nora Creina. "There she comes round. She spins
about like a top, God bless her " Then putting his
huge chapped hands at either side of his mouth, so as to

form a kind of speaking-trumpet, he cried out, in a voice
as loud and hoarse as that of the surges that rolled
between them, "Ahoy! ahoy! Have an oar out in the
bow, or she'll miss-stay in the swell."
"Thank you, thank you, it is done already," shouted
the helmsman in answer, "Kyrle, my boy, how are
you? Kyrle, have a good fire for us when we go in.
This is cold work."
"Cold work I" repeated Lowry Looby. "Dear knows,
it's true for you. Ah, then, isn't it little he makes of
it, after all, God bless him I an' it blowin' a perfect
harico."
Notwithstanding the vigour and confidence which
spoke in the accents of the hardy helmsman, Kyrle Daly,
when he saw the vessel once more shoot out into the
deep, felt as if he had been listening to the last farewell
of his friend. He could not return his gallant greeting,
and remained with his head leaning forward, and his arm
outstretched and trembling, while his eyes followed the
track of the pleasure-boat. Close behind him stood
Lowry, his shoulders raised against the wind, and his
hand placed over that ear on which it blew, clacking his
tongue against his palate for pity, and indulging in many
sentiments of commiseration for "Master Hardress" and
"the family," not forgetting "Danny the Lord," and his
sister, "Fighting Poll of the Reeks."
We shall follow the vessel in her brief but daring
course. The young helmsman has been already slightly
introduced to the reader in the second 'chapter of this
nistory; but the change which circumstances had since
effected in his appearance, rendered it well worthy of our
pains to describe his person and bearing with more
accuracy and distinctness.
His figure was tall, and distinguished by that muscular-
ity and firmness of set which characterises the inhabitants
of the south-west of Europe. His attitude, as he kept
one hand on the rudder and his eye fixed upon the fore-
sail, was such as displayed his form to extreme advantage.
It was erect, composed, and manly. Every movement
seemed to be dictated by a judgment perfectly at ease,
## p. 110 (#114) ############################################
I IO THE COLLEEN BAWN.
and a will that, far from being depressed, had caught a
degree of fire and excitement from the imminent dangers
with which it had to struggle. The warmth and heroic
flush upon his cheek could not be discovered in the pale
and unequal light that shone upon him ; but the settled
and steady lustre of his large dark eye, over which not
even the slightest contraction of the arched brow could be
discerned, the perfect calmness of his manner, and the
half-smiling expression of his mouth (that feature which,
of all others, is most traitorous to the dissembling
coward), bespoke a mind and heart that were pleased to
encounter danger, and well calculated to surmount it. It
was such a figure as would have at once awakened asso-
ciations in the beholder's mind of camps and action, of
states confounded in their councils, and nations overrun
by sudden conquest.
His features were brightened by a lofty and confident
enthusiasm, such as the imagination might ascribe to the
Royal Adventurer of Sweden, as he drew his sword on
his beleaguerers at Belgrade. His forehead was ample
and intellectual in its character; his hair "coal-back"
and curling; his complexion of that rich, deep, gipsy-
yellow, which, showing as it did the healthy bloom
beneath, was far nobler in its character than the feminine
white and red. The lower portion of his physiognomy
was finely and delicately turned; and a set of teeth as
white as those of a young beagle gave infinite vivacity to
the expression of his lips. The countenance was such a
one as men seldom look upon, but when once beheld, can
never be forgotten.
On a seat at the weather-side sat a young girl, her
slight person wrapped in a blue cloak, while her eyes were
raised to the cheerful face of the helmsman, as if from
him she derived all her hope and her security. The wind
had blown back the hood from her shoulders, and the
head and countenance which thus "unmasked their
beauty to the moon" were turned with a sylph-like grace
and lightness. The mass of curly hair which was blown
over her left temple seemed of a pale gold, that har-
monised well with the excelling fairness and purity of her
## p. 111 (#115) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. III
complexion; and the expression of her countenance was
tender, affectionate, and confiding.
In the bow sat a being who did not share the beauty
of his companions. He bore a prodigious hunch upon
his shoulders, which, however, did not prevent his using
his limbs with agility, and even strength, as he tended
the foresail, and bustled from side to side with an air of
the utmost coolness and indifference. His features were
not disagreeable, and were distinguished by that look of
pert shrewdness which marks the low inhabitant of a city,
and vents itself in vulgar cant and in ridicule of the
honest and wondering ignorance of rustic simplicity.
Such were the individuals whom the spirit of the tem-
pest appeared at this moment to hold environed by his
hundred perils; and such was the manner in which they
prepared to encounter their destiny.
"Mind your hand, Mr. Hardress," said the boatman,
in a careless tone ; "we are in the tide."
It required the hand of an experienced helmsman to
bring the little vessel through the danger which he thus
announced. An immense overtopping billow, capped in
foam, came thundering downward like an avalanche upon
her side. In spite of the precautions of Hardress, and
the practised skill with which he timed the motion of the
wave, as one would take a ball upon the bound or a
hunter on the rise, the bowsprit dipped and cracked like
a withered sapling; a whole tun of water was flung over
the stern, drenching the crew as completely as if they
had been drawn through the river. The boat seemed to
stagger and lose her way like a stricken hart, and lay for
a moment weltering in the gloomy chasm in which the
wasted wave had left her. A low and smothered scream
was breaking from the female, when her eye again met
that of Hardress Cregan, and her lip, though pale and
quivering, was silent.
"That was right well done, sir," said Danny Mann, as
the boat once more cleft the breakers on the landward
course. "A minute sooner or a minute later up with the
hand, would put it all into her."
"A second would have done it," said Hardress, "bul

all is well now. A charming night this would be," he
continued, smiling on the girl, "for beaver and feathers."
This jest produced a short hysteric laugh in answer,
which was rather startling than agreeable to the person
who addressed her. In a few minutes after, and without
any considerable disaster, the vessel dropped her peak,
and ran alongside the rocks on which Kyrle Daly was
expecting them. -
"Remain in the boat," said Hardress, addressing the
girl, while he fastened the hood over her head. "I see
that talkative fellow, Looby, above on the rocks. I will
procure you an occupied room, if possible, in the cottage,
as a neighbour and relative of Danny Mann. Endeavour
to conceal your countenance, and speak as little as pos-
sible. We are ruined if I should be seen paying you any
attention."
"And am I not to see you to-night again?" said the
girl, in a broken and affectionate accent.
"My own love, I would not go to rest without taking
leave of you for all the world. Be satisfied," he added,
pressing her hand tenderly, and patting her upturned
cheek. "You are a noble girl. Go, praypray, and
return thanks for your husband's life, as he shall do for
yours. I thought we should have supped in Heaven.
Dan I'' he continued aloud, calling to the boatman, "take
care of your sister."
"His sisther l'" echoed Lowry Looby on the rocks.
"Oh, murther! is Fighting Poll of the Reeks aboord too?
Why then he needn't bid Danny to take care of her, for
she is well able to do that job for herself."
Hardress leaped out upon the shore, and was received
by Kyrle Daly with a warmth and delight proportioned to
the anxiety which he had previously experienced.
"My dear fellow, I thought I should never have seen
you on your feet again. A thousand and a hundred
thousand welcomes | Lowry, run to the house, and get
dinner hastened. Stay! Hardress, have you any things
on board P"
"Only a small trunk and my gun. You would for ever
oblige me, Kyrle, by procuring a comfortable lodging, if

you have no room to spare, for this poor fellow of mine
and his sister. He is sickly, and you know he is my
foster-brother."
"He shall be taken care of: I have a room. Come
along ; you are dripping wet. Lowry, take up Mr.
Cregan's trunk and gun to the cottage. Come along,
Hardress, you will catch your death of cold ! Pooh are
you afraid Fighting Poll will break her tender limbs, that
you look back, and watch her so closely P"
"No, no, my dear Daly; but I am afraid that fellow
Booby-Looby-(what's his stupid name?)will break
my trunk; he is watching the woman and peering about
her, instead of minding what he is doing. But come
along ! Well, Kyrle, how are you? I saw you all in the
window to-day when I was sailing by."
"Yes: you edified my mother with that little feat you
performed at the expense of the fishermen."
"Ah, no! was she looking at that, though P I shall not
be able to show my face to her this month to come.
Hollo l you sir, Booby, Looby, come along ! Do you
remain long in the west, Kyrle P"
"As long as you will take a bed in the cottage with
me. But we will talk of this when you have changed
your dress and dined. You came on the very point of
time. Rem acu tetigisti, as our old college tutor, Doyle,
would say. Mrs. Frawley was just preparing to dish me
a roast duck. I bless the wind, all boisterous as it was,
that blew you on these shores, for I thought I should
have spent a lonesome evening, with the recollections of
merry old times, like so many evil familiars, to dine, and
sup, and sleep with me. But now that we are met again,
farewell the past ! The present and the future shall fur-
nish our entertainmentafter we have done with the roast
duck."
"The fume of which salutes my senses at this moment
with no disagreeable odour," said Hardress, following his
friend into the little hall of the cottage. "Mrs. Frawley,
as fat, and fair, and rosy as ever ! Well, Mrs. Frawley,
how do you and the cows get on P. Has any villainous
imp been making pishogs over your keelers P Does the

cream mount? Does the butter break? Have you got
the devil well out of your churn ?
"Oh, fie, Masther Cregan, to go spake of such a thing
at all. Oh, vo, a vich-O, you're drownded wet, an' that's
what you are. Nelly, eroo, bring hether the candle. Oh,
sir, you never will get over it."
"Never mind, Mrs. Frawley, I'll be stout enough to
dance at your wedding yet."
"My wedding, ma vourneen," returned the buxom
dairy-woman, in a gentle Scream of surprise, not unquali-
fied, however, by a gracious smile. "Oyeh, if you never
fut a moneen till then I Make haste hether with the
candle. Nelly, eroo, what are you doing?"
Nelly, not altogether point device in her attire, at length
appeared with a light to conduct the gentlemen to their
chamber; while Mrs. Frawley returned to the kitchen.
This accident of the stranger's arrival was of fatal conse-
quence to three individuals in the cottage; namely, two
fat chickens and a turkey-pout, upon whom sentence of
death was immediately pronounced and executed, without
more form of law than might go to the hanging of a
croppy. Mrs. Frawley, meantime, fulfilled the office of
sheriff on the occasion, ejaculating, out of a smiling
reverie, while she gazed listlessly on the blood of the
innocent victims, "Why then, I declare, that Mr.
Hardress is a mighty pleasant gentleman."
In the meantime, Lowry Looby was executing the
commission he had received with regard to Mr. Cregan's
trunk. Lowry, who was just as fond of obtaining as of
communicating strange intelligence, had his own good
reason for standing in awe of the far-famed Fighting Poll
of the Reeks, who was renowned in all the western fairs,
as a fearless, whisky-drinking virago, over six feet in her
stocking vamps, and standing no more in awe of the
gallows, than she might of her mother's arms. It may
at once be seen that a character of this description was
the very last that could have been personated with any
success by the lovely young creature who accompanied
Hardress; and, indeed, her only chance of escaping
detection consisted in the unobtrusiveness of the at-
## p. 115 (#119) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. II 5
tempt she made, and the care she used in concealing
her features. The first circumstance that excited the
astonishment of Lowry, as he stood bowing with his
hat off, upon the rocks, while Danny the Lord assisted
her to land, was the comparative diminutiveness of her
stature, and the apparent slightness of her form.
"Your sarvent, Mrs. Naughten," he said in a most in-
sinuating accent. "I hope I see you well in your health,
ma'am. You wouldn't remember a boy of the Loobys at
all, you met of a time at Nelly Hewsan's wake, westwards
(Heaven rest her soul this night!) That was the place
where the great giving out was, surely."
To his gentle remembrance of old merry times, the
female in the blue cloak only answered by a slight, short
courtesy, while she drew the hood closer about her face,
and began, though with a feeble and tottering step, to
ascend the rocks.
"Bread, an'beef, an'tay, an'whisky, an'tur-
keys, an'cakes, an' everything that the heart could
like," "the officious Lowry continued, following the
pseudo-Amazon among the stones and sea-weed, and
marvelling not a little at her unaccustomed taciturnity.
"The Hewsans could well afford it; they were strong,
snug farmers: relations o' your own, I'm thinking,
ma'am. Oh, vo! sure I forgot the thrunk, and there's
Mr. Hardress calling to me. Larry Kett," he con-
tinued, addressing the old boatman before mentioned,
"will show Mrs. Naughten the way to the house, while
I'm getting the thrunk out o' the boat; an' if you want
a fire o' turf, or a gval o' piatees, Mrs. Frawley will let
you have 'em an' welcome."
The old boatman willingly came into terms so easy
and advantageous; and the fair counterfeit hurried on,
well pleased at the exchange of companions. Lowry,
in the meantime, returned to the boat, and stole into
conversation with Danny the Lord, whom, in fear of
his sneering satirical temper, he always treated with
nearly as much respect as if his title were not so
purely a thing of courtesy. Danny Mann, on the other
hand, received his attentions with but little complais-

ance; for he looked on Lowry as a foolish, troublesome
fellow, whose property in words (like the estate of many
a young absentee) far overbalanced his discretion and
ability in their employment. He had often told Looby
in confidence, "that it would be well for him he had a
bigger head and a smaller mouth"alluding to that
peculiar conformation of Lowry's upper man, with which
the reader has been already made acquainted. The
country people (who are never at a loss for a smile),
when they saw this long-legged fellow following the sharp-
faced little hunchback from place to place, used to lean on
their spades, and call the attention of their companions to
"the wran an' the cuckoo goin' the road."
The "cuckoo" now found the "wran" employed in
coiling up a wet cable on the forecastle, while he sang
in a voice that more nearly resembled the grunting of a
pig at the approach of rain, than the melody of the sweet
songstress of the hedges above-named :
"An' of all de meat dat ever was hung,
A cheek o' pork is my fancy,
'Tis sweet an' toothsome, when 'tis young;
Fait, dat's no lie, says Nancy.
*Twill boil in less dan half-an-hour,
Den with your nail you may try it,
'Twill taste like any cauliflower
'Tis better do dat dan to fry it.
"Sing re-rig-i-dig-i-dum-derom-dum."
"How does the world use Misther Mann this even-
ing?" was the form of Lowry's first greeting, as he bent
over the gunwale of the stern, and laid his huge paws on
the small trunk.
"As you see me, Lowry," was the reply.
"A smart evening ye had of it."
"Purty fair, for de matter o' dat."
"Dear knows, it's a wondher ye worn't drownded,
'Twas blowin' a harico. An' you singin' now, as if you
wor comin' from a jig-house, or a wake, or a weddin'.
Ah, then tell me, now, Misther Mann, wasn't it your
thought, when you were abroad that time, how long it
was since you were with the priest before ?"

"I dought o' dat first, Lowry, an' I tried to say a
prayer; but it was so long from me since I did de like
before, dat I might as well try to talk Latin or any oder
book-larning. But sure if I dought o' myself rightly,
dere wasn't de laste fear of us, for I had a book o' St.

have dat, I knew dat if de boat was to go down under
me itself, she'd come up again."
"Erra, no l'
"Iss, dear knows."
"I wisht I had one of 'em," said Lowry. "I do be
often goin' in boats across to Cratloe an' them places."
"You'd have no business of it, Lowry. Dem dat's
born for one death, has no reason to be afeerd of
anoder."
"Gondouthal You're welcome to your joke this
evening. Well, if I was to put my eyes upon sticks,
Misther Mann, I never would know your sister again."
"She grew a dale, I b'lieve."
"Grew P-If she did, it's like the cow's tail, down-

wouldn't get a crooked word outside her lips, from year's
end to year's end."
"Why, then, it was long from her to be so mealy-
mouthed when I knew her. An' does she lift a hand
at the fair at all now? Oyeh, what a terrible 'oman she
was, comin' again' a man with her stockin' off, an' a stone
in the foot of it !"
"She was. Well, she wouldn't raise her hand to a
chicken now."
"That flogs cock-fighting."
"Only, I'll tell you in one case. She's apt to be
contrary to any one dat would be comin' discoorsin' her
of a Tursday at all, or peepin' or spyin' about her, she's
so vexed in herself not to be able to make 'em an answer.
It used to be a word an' a blow wid her; but now, as she
can't have de word, 'tis de blow comes mostly first, an'
she didn't make e'er a vow again' dat."
"Shasthone !" exclaimed Lowry, who laid up this hint
for his own edification. "Great changes, surely. Well,
Misther Mann, an' will you tell me now, if you plase, is
your masther goin' westwards in the boat to-morrow?"
"I don't know, an'not makin' you a short answer,

your talkin' dere. Dat I may be happy but I would, an'
dat's as good as if I was after takin' all de books in
Ireland of it."
This hint put an end to the conversation for the pre-
sent, and Danny the Lord (who exercised over Lowry
Looby an influence somewhat similar to that which tied
Master Matthew to the heels of Bobadil) adjourned with
that loquacious person to the comforts of Mrs. Frawley's
fireside.

CHAPTER XIII.
HOW THE TWO FRIENDS HOLD A LONGER CONVERSATION
TOGETHER THAN THE READER MAY PROBABLY APPROVE.
THE female in the blue cloak withstood all the recom-
mendations and entreaties of the good-natured dairy-
woman, that she would "step in, and take an air of
the kitchen fire." She pleaded extreme fatigue, and
requested that she might be permitted to occupy at
once the chamber in which she was to pass the night.
Finding her resolute, Mrs. Frawley insisted on having
a cheerful fire lighted up in the little room outside her
own dormitory, which was appropriated to the fair
stranger's use. It was impossible to maintain her
close disguise in the presence of this officious and
hospitable woman, whose regard for her guest was in
no degree diminished by a view of her person and
dress. Her hair was ringing wet, but her cloak had
in a great measure preserved the remainder of her
attire, which was just a shade too elegant for a mere
paysanne, and too modest for a person claiming the
rank of a gentlewoman. The material, also, which was
a pretty flowered cotton"a dawny pattern," as Mrs.
Frawley declaredproclaimed a pocket altogether at
ease, and led the dairy-woman to the conclusion that
"the Naughtens were decent, credible people, that knew
how to industher, and turn and stretch a penny as far
as more would a shilling."
Having supplied the counterfeit Poll with everything
necessary for her immediate uses, Mrs. Frawley left her
to make what changes she pleased in her dress, and
went to look after the young gentlemen's dinner, as well
as to prepare some refreshment for the weary Mrs.
Naughten herself.
Scarcely had Mrs. Frawley departed when a soft tap-
ping at the room-door announced the approach of another

visitor. The lovely inconnue, who was employed at the
moment in arranging and drying her hair, felt her heart
beat somewhat quickly and strongly at the sound. She
threw back from her temples the wavy masses of gold
that hung around them, and ran to the door with lips
apart, and a flushed and eager cheek. "It is he " she
exclaimed to her own breast as she undid the bolt.
It was not he. The weather-worn, freckled face of the
little hunchback was the first object that met her eyes.
Between his hands he held a small trunk, the lid of
which was studded with brass nails, forming the letters
E. O'C.
"By a dale to do, Miss, I laid hoult o' dis," said
Danny; "Lowry said, de letters didn't stand for Mr.
Hardress at all, only one of 'em."
"Thank you, Danny. Where is your master?"
"Aten his dinner in de parlour wid Mr. Daly before a
tunderin' big fire.
"Was Lowry speaking to you?"
"Did anybody ever see him oderwise? I'll be bail
he was so."
"But does he know

little lord, "an' I tink if he knew, he'd tell."
"Well, Danny, will you find an opportunity of speak.
ing to your master without being observed, and tell him
that I wish to see him very much indeed? I am very
uneasy; and he has not told me how long we are to stay
here, or where we are to go next, or anything. I feel
quite lonesome, Danny, for it is the first evening I have
ever spent alone in my life, I think." Here the poor
young creature's lip quivered a little, and the water
started into her eye.
"Never fear, ma gra hu ! ma grein chree hu !" said
Danny in a soothing tone; "I'll speak a word in his ear,
an' he'll come to you. Dat I may never die in a frost if
I wouldn't go from dis to Dublin to sarve you, next to
Mr. Hardress himself."
He was as good as his word, and took an opportunity,
while Hardress was giving him some directions about the

boat, to mention the request of their gentle companion in
the storm. The young gentleman inquired the situation
of her room, and bade his servant say that he would not
fail to visit her, if only for a few minutes, before he re-
tired to rest. It was necessary that the utmost caution
should be observed, to avoid awakening suspicion.
Kyrle Daly, in the meantime, was employed in manu-
facturing a capacious bowl of whisky-punch by the
parlour fire-side. Instead of the humble but capacious
tumbler, or still more modern small stone-china jug,
over which you, good Irish reader, are probably ac-
customed to solace your honest heart on a winter's
evening, two glasses, more than a foot in height, were
displayed upon the board, and seemed intended to
meet the lips without the necessity of any assistance
from the hand.
By one of those inconsistencies in our nature on which
it is idle to speculate, Kyrle Daly found a difficulty in
getting into conversation with his friend upon the very
subject on which, a few minutes before, he had longed
for his advice and assistance. Hardress appeared to be
in high, noisy, and even exulting spirits, the sound of
which rang jarringly and harsh upon the ear of the dis-
appointed lover. The uproar of his happy heart offended
the languor of his young companion's mind, as the bustle
of the city noon sounds strange and unfamiliar on a sick
man's hearing.
Neither, perhaps, is there any subject to which young
men of equal pretensions have a greater distaste than
that of love confidences one with another. If the tale be
of a past and unhappy attachment, it is wearisome and
annoying; and if it relate to a present and successful
passion, a sentiment of jealousy is apt to invade the
heart of the listener, while he is made to contemplate a
picture of happiness which, perhaps, the sternness of his
own destiny has allowed him to contemplate as a picture
only. A better test could scarcely be adopted to dis-
tinguish a sincere and disinterested friendship from one
of mere convenience, than a trial of patience on such a
topic. It is true, indeed, that the incidents lately re-

I22 The COLLEen BAWN.
corded afford reason to believe that Hardress Cregan was
not one of those forlorn beings who are made
"to love, and not be loved again;"
but it is certain, nevertheless, that when Kyrle Daly first
mentioned his having been at Castle Chute, and driving
Anne to the race-course, his manner was rather reserved
and discouraging than otherwise.
"The longer I live," Kyrle said at length, with some
hesitation in his manner"the longer I live in this luck-
less condition, and the oftener I think of that excellent
girl, the more deep and settled is the hold which she has
taken of my imagination. I wonder, Hardress, how you
can be so indifferent to her acquaintance. Placing my
own unfortunate affection altogether out of view, I can
scarcely imagine an enjoyment more desirable than that
of cultivating the society of so amiable a creature."
Here he drew a long sigh, and replenished the void
thus occasioned, by having recourse to the bowl and the
ladle.
"I am not of the same opinion, Kyrle," said Hardress;
"Anne Chute is, unquestionably, a very fine girl, but she
is too highly educated for me."
"Too highly educated!"
"Echo me not. The words are mine. Yes, Kyrle, I
hold that this system of polishing girls, ad ungtem, is
likely to be the destruction of all that is sincere, and
natural, and unaffected in the sex. It is giving the mind
an unwholesome preponderance over the heart, Occasion-
ing what an astronomer would call an occultation of feel-
ing, by the intervention of reason."
"I cannot imagine a case," said Kyrle, "in which the
exercise of reason can ever become excessive; and there
are sneerers under the sun, Hardress, who will tell you
that this danger is least of all to be apprehended among
the lovely beings of whom you are speaking."
"I think otherwise. As I prefer the works of nature
to the works of man, the fresh river breeze to the dusty
and smoky zephyr of Capel Street, the bloom on a
cottage cheek to the crimson japan that blazes at the

Earl of Buckinghamshire's drawing-rooms; as I love a
plain beefsteak before a grilled attorney," this excellent
whisky-punch before my mother's confounded currant
wine, and anything else that is pure and natural before
anything else that is adulterated and artificial; so do I
love the wild hedge-flower, simplicity, before the cold
and sapless exotic, fashion; so do I love the voice of
affection and of nature, before that of finesse and affec-
tation."
"Your terms are a little too hard, I think," said Kyrle;
"elegance of manner is not finesse, nor at all the opposite
of simplicity; it is merely simplicity made perfect. I
grant you that few, very few, are successful in acquiring
it; and I dislike its ape, affectation, as heartily as you
do. But we find something that is conventional in all
classes, and I like affectation better than vulgarity after
all."
"Vulgarity of manner," said Hardress, "is more tole-
rable than vulgarity of mind."
"One is only offensive as the indication of the other,
and I think it not more tolerable, because I prefer ugli-
ness masked to ugliness exposed."
"Why, now, Daly, I will meet you on tangible ground.
There is our friend Anne Chute, acknowledged to be the
loveliest girl in her circle, and one whom I remember a
charming, good-natured little hoyden in her childhood.
And see what high education has done for her. She is
cold and distant, even to absolute frigidity, merely be-
cause she has been taught that insensibility is allied to
elegance. What was habit has become nature with her;
the frost which she suffered to lie so long upon the sur-
face has at length penetrated to her affections, and killed
every germ of mirth, and love, and kindness, that might
have made her a treasure to her friends and an ornament
to society."
* It is notorious that the drumstick of a goose or turkey, grilled
and highly spiced, was called a devil. Some elegant persons, how-
ever, who deemed that term too strong for "ears polite," were at the
H. of looking for a synonym of a milder sound, and discovered a
ppy substitute in the word attorney, which conveys all the original
force, without the coarse cacophony of the other phrase.
## p. 124 (#128) ############################################
I 24 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Believe me, Hardress, believe me, my dear Hardress,
you do her wrong," exclaimed Kyrle with exceeding
warmth. "It is not that I love Anne Chute, I speak;
but because I know and esteem her. If you knew her
but for three days, instead of one hour, you never would
again pronounce so harsh a sentence. All that is virtuous,
all that is tender and affectionate, all that is amiable and
high-principled, may be met with in that admirable woman.
Take the pains to know her, visit her, speak of her to her
friendsher dependentsto her aged motherto any
one that has observed her conduct, and you will be un-
deceived. Why will you not strive to know her better?"
"Why, you must consider that it is not many months
since I returned from Dublin; and, to say a truth, the
single visit I paid at Castle Chute was not calculated to
tempt me to a second. Considering that I was an old
play-fellow and a kind of cousin, I thought Anne Chute
need not have received me as if I were a tax-gatherer, or
a travelling dancing-master."
"Why, what would you have her do? Throw her
arms about your neck, and kiss you, I suppose?"
"Not exactly. You know the class of people of whom
little Flaccus said, Quum vitia vitant in contraria currunt,
and, after all, I think Anne Chute is not one of those,
Her education is little worth if it could not enable her to
See a medium between two courses so much at variance."
"But will you allow a friend to remind you, Hardress,
that you are a little over-apt to take exception in matters
of this kind. And, notwithstanding all you have been
saying against the polite world, I will venture to pro-
phesy this, that when circumstances shall more fre-
quently thrust you forward on the stage, and custom
shall make you blind to the slight and formal insinceri-
ties that grieve you at present, your ideas on fashion,
and elegance, and education will undergo a change. I
know you, Hardress: you are not yet of age. The
shadow of a repulse is now to you a sentence of banish-
ment from any circle in which you suppose it is offered:
but when you shall be courted, when mothers shall dress
their daughters at you, and daughters shall shower down

smiles upon your path; when fathers shall praise your
drinking, and sons shall eulogize your horses, then,
Hardress, look to it. You will then be as loud and
talkative before the whole world, as now in presence
of your humble friend. You will smile, and smile a
hundred times over at your young philosophy."
"Oh, "never shall sun that morrow see,'" cried
Hardress, throwing himself back in his chair, and
raising his hands in seeming deprecation. "I per-
ceive what you are hitting at, Kyrle," he continued,
reddening a little; you allude to mymytimidity
bashfulnesswhat you willmy social cowardice.
But I disclaim the petty, paltry failing. The feeling
that unnerves me in society is as widely different
from that base consciousness of inferiority, or servile
veneration of wealth, rank or power, as the anger of
Achilles from the spite of Thersites. You may laugh
and call me self-conceited, but, upon my simple honour,
I speak in pure sincerity. My feeling is this, my dear
Kyrle, New as I was to the world after leaving college
(where you know I studied pretty hard), the customs of
society appeared to wear a strangeness in my sight, that
made me a perfect and competent judge of their value.
Their hollowness disgusted, and their insipidity provoked
me. I could not join with any ease in the solemn folly
of bows, and becks, and wreathed smiles, that can be put
on or off at pleasure. The motive of the simplest forms
of society stared me in the face when I saw them acted
before me, and if I attempted to play a part among the
hypocrites myself, I supposed that every eye around me
was equally clear-sighted, saw through the hollow as-
sumption, and despised it as sincerely in me as I had
done in others. The consciousness of guilt was evident
in my manner, and I received the mortification which
ensued as the just punishment of my meanness and
hypocrisy."
"You do express yourself in sufficiently forcible terms
when you go about it," said Daly, smiling. "What great
hypocrisy or meanness there can be in remarking that it
is a fine day, or asking after the family of an acquaintance,

I 26 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
even though he should know that the first was merely in-
tended to draw on a conversation, and the second to show
him a mark of regard."
"Which I did not feel."
"Granted. Let him perceive that never so clearly,
there is still an attention implied in your putting the
questions at all with which he cannot be disobliged. It
is flattering to acknowledge the necessity of such a defer-
ence. And, my dear Hardress, if you were never to
admit of ceremony as the deputy of natural and real feel-
ing, what would become of the whole social system P
How soon the mighty vessel would become a wreck!
how silent would be the rich man's banquet ! how soli-
tary the great man's chambers how few would bow
before the throne ! how lonely and how desolate would
be the temples of religion 1"
"You are the more bitter satirist of the two," said
Hardress.
"No, no," exclaimed Kyrle, "I merely remind you
of an acknowledged fact, that when you enrol your name
on the social list, you pledge yourself to endure as well
as to enjoy. As long as ever you live, Hardress, take
my word for it, you will never make nor look upon a
perfect world. It is such philosophy as yours that goes
to the making of misanthropes. The next time you go
into society, resolve to accept any mortifications you
shall endure as a punishment for your sins, and so think
no more of them. This indifference will become habi-
tual, and while it does so, those necessary hypocrisies of
which you speak will grow familiar and inoffensive."
"I see no occasion," said Hardress, "to make the
trial. Plain human nature is enough for me. If I were
to choose a companion for life, I should rather hope to
cull the sweet fruit of conjugal happiness in the wild
orchard of nature, than from the bark-beds and hot walls
of society."
"I advise you, however," said Kyrle, "not to make the
choice until you have greater opportunities of observing
both sides of the question. Trust not to the permanence
of your present feelings, nor to the practical correctness

trie COLLEEN BAWN. 127
5f your curious theories. It would be too late, after you
had linked yourself totosimplicity, I shall call it, to
discover that elegance was a good thing after all."
Hardress did not appear to relish this speech, and the
conversation, in consequence, was discontinued for some
minutes. Young Cregan was indeed as incapable of
calculating on his future character as Kyrle Daly asserted.
He was in that period of life (the most critical perhaps
of all) when the energies of the mind, as well as of the
frame begin to develop themselves, and exhibit in
irregular outbreaks, the approaching vigour and fire of
manhood. A host of new ideas at this time crowd in
upon the reason, distinguished rather by their originality
and genius, than by that correctness and good order
which is derivable from instruction or experience alone;
and it depends upon the circumstances in which the
young thinker is placed, whether his future character
shall be that of a madman or a sage. It was, perhaps, a
knowledge of this inventive pride in youth, that made
the Stagirite assert that men should not look into philo-
sophical works before the age of five-and-twenty.
Hardress, however, although very sensitive, was not
one of those who can brood a long time over an evil
feeling. "Well, Daly," he exclaimed, starting from a
reverie, "we will each of us pursue our inclinations on
this subject. Leave me to the indulgence of my theories,
and I will wish you joy of your Anne Chute."
"My Anne Chute 1" echoed Daly, sipping his wine
with a sad face. "I have no lien upon that lady, as the
counsellors say. She may sue as a feme sole for me in
any court in Christendom."
Hardress turned on him a look of extreme surprise, in
answer to which Kyrle Daly furnished him with an
account of his unsuccessful suit to Anne, as also with his
suspicions as to another attachment. The deep feeling
of disappointment under which he laboured became
apparent, as he proceeded in his discourse, in the warmth
and eagerness of his manner, the frequent compression
of his lips, and clenching of his trembling hands, the
dampness of his forehead, and the sparkling of his
## p. 128 (#132) ############################################
128 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
moistened eye-balls. The sight of his friend in suffering
turned the stream of Hardress Cregan's sympathies into
another channel, and he employed all his eloquence and
ingenuity in combating the dangerous dejection which
was hourly gaining upon his spirit. He declared his dis-
belief in the idea of another attachment, and recommended
perseverance by every argument in his power.
"But the state of her mind," he continued, "shall not
remain long a secret to you. They have been both
(Anne and her mother) invited to spend a part of the
winter with us at Dinis cottage. My mother is a great
secret-hunter, and I need only tell her where the game
lies, to make certain that it will be hunted down. Trust
everything to mefor your sake I will take some pains
to become better known to this extraordinary girl; and
you may depend upon it, if she will suffer me to mount
above zero, you shall not suffer in my good report."
When the conversation had reached this juncture, the
silence which prevailed in the cottage showed that
the night was already far advanced. The punch had
descended so low as to leave the bowl of the ladle more
than half visible; the candles seemed to meditate suicide,
while the neglected Snuff, gathering to a pall above the
flame, threw a gloomy and flickering shadow on the
ceiling; the turfen fire was little more than a heap of
pale ashes, before which the drowsy household cat, in
her sphynx-like attitude, sat winking and purring her
monotonous song of pleasure; the abated storm (like a
true Irish storm) seemed to mourn with repentant
howlings over the desolating effects of its recent fury; the
dog lay dreaming on the hearth; the adjoining farm-yard
was silent, all but the fowl-house, where some garrulous
dame partlet, with female pertinacity, still maintained a
kind of drowsy clucking on her roost; the natural hour
of repose seemed to have produced its effect upon the
battling elements themselves; the tempest had folded his
black wings upon the ocean, and the waters broke upon
the shore with a murmur of expiring passion. Within
doors, or without, there was no sight nor sound that did
not convey a hint of bed-time to the watchers.
## p. 129 (#133) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 129
To make this hint the stronger, Mrs. Frawley showed
the disc of her full-blown countenance at the door, as
round as the autumnal moon, and like that satellite,
illuminated by a borrowed light, namely, the last inch of
a dipped candle which burned in her hand. "Masther
Kyrle, darlin'," she exclaimed, in a tone of tender re-
monstrance, "won't you go to bed to-night, child? 'Tis
near mornin', dear knows."
"Is Lowry Looby in bed?"
"No, sir, he's waitin' to know have you any commands
to Cork; he's goin' to guide the car in the mornin' with
the firkins."
Lowry here introduced his person before that of the
dairy-woman, causing, however, rather a transit than an
eclipse of the moon of womanhood.
"Or Misther Cregan?" he exclaimed; "may be he'd
have some commands westwards P. Because if he had,
I could lave 'em at the forge at the cross, above, with
directions to have 'em sent down to the house."
"I have no commands," said Hardress, "except to say
that I will be at home on nxt Friday."
"And I have none whatever," said Kyrle Daly, rising
and taking one of the candles. "Hardress, mind you
don't give me the counterfeit, the slip, in the morning."
This caution produced a hospitable battle, which ended
in Hardress Cregan's maintaining his purpose of de-
parting with the dawn of day. The friends then shook
hands, and separated for the night.

CHAPTER XIV.
HOW LOWRY BECOMES PHILOSOPHICAL.
As Lowry Looby returned to the kitchen, he was met by
Nelly, the housemaid, who reminded him that he would
be obliged to start before the potatoes could be boiled
in the morning, and recommended as a preparatory
measure, that he should take his breakfast overnight.
I
## p. 130 (#134) ############################################
13o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Secure of his indulging her in so reasonable a request,
she had already, under Mrs. Frawley's favour, laid on a
little table before the kitchen fire the remains of the
ducks (so often commemorated in this narrative), a plate
of "re-heaters" (such was Nelly's term for potatoes,
suffered to cool, and warmed again in the red turf-ashes),
as also a piece of pork, four inches in depth, and con-
taining no lean that was visible on a cursory inspection.
This last was a dish for which Nelly knew Lowry Looby
to entertain a fondness worthy of his ancient Irish
descent. Indeed, on all occasions, Nelly was observed
to take an interest in consulting the inclinations of this
long-legged persona kindness upon her part which the
ungrateful Lowry seemed little inclined to appreciate.
The present proposal, however, harmonized so sweetly
with his own feelings at the moment, that he signified a
speedy compliance, and followed the nymph into her
culinary retreat. The kitchen presented a scene no less
drowsy than the parlour. Mrs. Frawley was saying her
prayers by the fireside, with a string of beads that hung
down to the ground, now and then venting a deep sigh,
then "running her godly race" through a fit of yawning,
and anon casting a glance over her shoulder at the
proceedings of the two domestics, while every new dis-
traction was followed by a succession of more audible
groans and more vehement assaults with the closed hand
upon her bosom. Danny Mann was sleeping heavily on
the other side of the fire, with his red woollen comforter
drying on his knee. In order to avoid disturbing either
the slumbers of the one or the devotions of the other,
Nelly and her swain were obliged to carry on their
conversation in a low whispering voice, which gave
additional effect to the sleepy tone of the entire scene.
The shadows of the whole party, like the fame of genius
magnified by distance, were thrown in gigantic similitude
upon the surrounding walls. There Mrs. Frawley dilated
to the dimensions of an ogre's wife, and here Danny
Mann's hunch became to the original as Ossa to Knock
Patrick. Looby's expanded mouth showed like the
opening to Avernus, and the tight little Nelly herself, as

THE COLLEEN BAWN. I31
she sat opposite, assumed the stature of Mr. Salt's black
breccia, Memnon, which any reader who is curious about
Nelly's personal outline, may behold in the ninth room
of the British Museum.
While Lowry consoled himself with the greasy pork,
swallowing it with as lively a relish as if it were the green
fat of a Gallipagos turtle, he gave Nelly a history of the
day's adventures, not forgetting his own triumph at the
staggeen race and the disappearance of Eily O'Connor,
Nelly was the better pleased with his account of these
transactions, as he thought fit to abstain in the first
instance from all mention of Syl Carney; and, in speaking
of the rope-maker's daughter, to omit those customary
eulogies which he dealt forth whenever her name was
brought in question. Emboldened by this circumstance,
Nelly did not hesitate to throw out some plain in-
sinuations as to the probable cause of the mystery, which
did not much redound to the honour of the charming
fugitive, and she became still more impassioned in her
invective after Mrs. Frawley had relieved them from the
restraint of her presence, and retired to her sleeping-room.
"Often an' often I told you, Lowry, that it wasn't for
you to be lookin' afther a girl o' that kind, that thought
herself as good as a lady. Great business, indeed, a poor
man o' your kind would have of one like her, that would
be too grand to put a leg in a skeogh" to wash the
potatoes, or lay a hand on the pot-hooks, to sthrain 'em,
if they wor broke to tatthers."
"That I may never die in sin, if ever I had a thought
of her, Nelly, only just divartin' at Batt Coonerty's."
"What a show the house would be with ye," continued
Nelly, still following up the matrimonial picture, "an'
you a hard-workin' boy, obleest to be up early an' late at
other people's biddin'. I'll be bound that isn't the girl
that would be up with the lark, an' have a fire made, an'
a griddle o' bread down in the mornin' before you, an'

there's a chimaera" before the boys' eyes, that they don't
know what's good for 'em."
"Look I'' exclaimed Lowry, while he broke a potato
between his fingers, swallowed one-half at a mouthful,
and tossed the crisped peel upon the table; "that I may
be happy, if she was offered to me this minute, if I'd
take her. Sure I know I'd have no more business of
Such a girl upon my floore than I would of Miss Chute
herself. But there's no reason, for all, why I wouldn't
be sorry for ould Mihil's throuble. He's gone west-
wards, Foxy Dunat the hair-cutter tells me, to Castle
Island, to his brother, Father Ned, I suppose, to get him
to publish her from the altar, or somethin'. They think
'tis westwards she went."
Happening at this moment to cast his eyes upon
Danny Mann, Lowry perceived, with a sensation of
disagreeable surprise, that he was awake, and peering
curiously upon him from below the half-raised lids. The
red fire-light, which gleamed on the eye-balls, gave them
a peculiar and equivocal lustre, which added force to
their native sharpness of expression. Danny felt the ill
effect he had produced; and carried it off with a fit of
yawning and stretching, asking Lowry at the same time,
with a drowsy air, if he meant to go to bed at all.
"To be sure I do," said Lowry, "when it's pleasin' to
the company to part. There's a time for all things, as
they say in the Readin'-made-asy."
"Surely, surely," returned Danny, with a yawn. "Dear
knows, den, de Readin'-made-asy time is come now, for
'tis almost mornin'."
"I always, mostly, smoke a drass before I go to bed of
a night," said Lowry, turning towards the fire, and clearing
the bowl of his pipe, by knocking it gently against the
bar of the grate; "I like to be smokin' an' talkin' when
the company is agreeable, an' I see no rason for bein' in
a hurry to-night above all others. Come, Nelly," he
added, while he chopped up a little tobacco, and pressed
it into the bowl with the tip of his finger, "Come here,
an' sit near me, I want to be talkin' to you."
* An optical illusion.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. I33
Saying this, he took a half-burnt sod from the fire,
crushed the bowl into the burning portion, and after
offering it in vain to Danny, placed it in the corner of his
mouth. He then remained for some moments with his
eyes half closed, drawing in the fire with his breath, and
coaxing it with his finger, until the vapour flowed freely
through the narrow tube, and was emitted at intervals, at
the opposite corner of his mouth, in a dense and spiry
Stream.
"An' what do you want to be saying?" said Nell,
taking her seat between Lowry and the lord; "I'll
engage you have nothin' to say to me, afther all."
"Come a little nearer," said Lowry, without changing
his position.
"Well, there, why," returned Nelly, moving her chair
a little closer; "will that do?"
"No, it won't. 'Tis a whisper I have for you. Misther
Mann would hear it if I told it to you where you are."
"Oh, a whisper! Well, now I'm close enough, any
way," she said, placing her chair in contact with that of
Lowry.
The latter took the pipe from his mouth, and ad-
vanced his face so close to that of the expectant
housemaid, that she feared he was about to Snatch a
kiss. Perhaps it was in mere curiosity to satisfy herself
whether in fact he could possess so much audacity, that
Nelly did not avoid that danger by moving her head
aside; but greatly to her surprise, and, doubtless, likewise
to her satisfaction, the honest man proved that he had
no such insolent intention. When he had attained a
convenient proximity, he merely parted his lips a little,
and puffed a whole volume of smoke into her eyes.
Nelly uttered a gentle scream, and covered her face with
her hands, while Danny and Lowry exchanged a broad
grin of satisfaction.
"Well, Lowry," exclaimed the girl with much good
humour, "you're the greatest rogue goin', and that's
your name this night."
Lowry continued to muse for a few moments, while he
continued the enjoyment of his pipe. In a little time he

once more took it from his lips, puffed forth the last
whiff, and said: "Misther Mann, they may say this and
that o' the world, an' of poverty, an' riches, an' humility,
an' gentility, an' everythin' else they like, but here's my
word, ever: If I was a king upon a throne this minute,
an' I wanted to have a smoke for myself by the fireside,
why, if I was to do my best, what could I smoke but one
pen'orth o' tobacco in the night, afther all: an' can't I
have that as it is, just as asy P. If I was to have a bed
with down feathers upon it, what could I do more but sleep
there P An' sure I can do that in the settle-bed above P
If I was able to buy the whole market out an' out, what
could I ate of it more than I did to-night o' that pork
upon the table? Do you see now, Mr. Mann P do you
see, Nelly P. Unless he could smoke two pipes of a night,
instead of one, or sleep more, or ate more without hurt,
I don't say what's the advantage a king has over a poor
man like myself."
"Ah, sure, you know that's foolish talk, Lowry. Sure
the king could buy and sell you at the fair if he liked."
"He couldn't without the jury," returned Lowry"the
judge an' jury ever. He couldn't lay a wet finger on me
without the jury, be course o' law. The round o' the
world is as free to me as it is to him, if the world be
round in airnest, as they say it is."
"Round, ayeh P" said Nell.
"Iss, to be sure."
Danny Mann looked at him for a moment. "Is it the
world we're walkin' on ?" he asked in some surprise.
"To be sure, what else?"
"Ah, don't be talkin'," retorted Danny, turning his head
away in perfect scorn of the hypothesis.
"Faix, I tell you no lie," said Lowry, "'tis printed in
all the books in Europe. They say that if it wasn't
round we'd soon be done for. We couldn't keep a hoult
upon it at all, only to go flyin' through the elements; the
Lord save us."
"Oh, vo, vo!" said Nelly; "well, that bates Ireland."
"Sure there's more says that it isn't the sun above do
be movin' at all, only we goin' round it."

"That the sun doesn't stir l'"
"Not a peg."
"Well, now you may hould your tongue, after dat,"
said Danny, "after wantin' to take the eyesight from us.
Sure the whole world sees the sun goin', any way."
"I wouldn't b'lieve that," said Nelly, "if they were to
put their eyes upon sticks."
"I wouldn't be so," returned Lowry; "what business
would a poor boy o' my kind have goin' again men that
are able to write books, let alone readin' 'em, but 'tis the
foolishness of the women," he continued, fixing upon
Nelly as the least pugnacious opponent, "women are
always for foolishness. They'd b'lieve or not b'lieve
just as they like themselves. Equal to Dan Dawley's
second wife: did you ever hear o' that business, Misther
Mann P"
"Not as I know."
"Well, stir up the fire, Nelly, an' put down a couple
o' sods, an' I'll tell it while I am finishin' my pipe, an'
then we'll all be off to bed. Dan Dawley was married a
second time to a very nice girl, one Jug Minahan (he's
the steward at Castle Chute, behind). Well, he was out
of a day at work, an' his wife was setten' alone by the
fire, a few weeks afther they bein' married. Now there
was one o' the stones in the chimney (as it might be that
stone there), an' it stood out loose from the morthar a
dale beyond the rest. Well, she sat lookin' at it for a
while, an' the thought come in her head, 'If I had a
child now," says she, "an' he was standin' a-near that
stone, maybe 'twould fall out, an' brain him on me.' An'
with the thought o' that, she began roarin' an' bawlin'
equal to anythin' ever you hear."
"Oh, then, she was a foolish girl," said Nelly.
"Dear knows, that was her name," said Danny.
"Well, her old mother heered her bawlin', an' she
came in the greatest hurry. 'Ah! what ails you, Jug P'
says she. So Jug up an tould her her thought about the
stone, an' began bawlin' worse than ever. An' if she did,
the mother joined her, an' such a pillilu as they raised
between 'em was never known. That was well an' good.
## p. 136 (#140) ############################################
136 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Well, Dan was abroad in the potato-garden, an' he heard
the work goin' on in his house, cryin' equal to a funeral.
'What's this about?" says Dan, "there's somebody
murthered, surely.' So he made for the doore, an' in he
walked, an' there he found the pair o' ladies. 'Ah! what
ails you, mother?" said he. "Jug will tell you, agra,' says
the mother. So he looked at Jug. 'Thinkin' I was,"
says she, still crying, 'that if the child was born, an' if that
stone there fell upon him, it would brain him on me."
Well, Dan stood for a while lookin' at her. 'If the sky
fell," says he, "we'd catch larks. An' is that all that
happened to you?' 'Isn't it enough P' says she again.
Well, he stopped a long while thinkin' in his mind, and
then he reached out his hand to her. "Well," says he,
'that's the foolishest thing I ever knew in my life, an' I'll
tell you what it is; I never'll take a day with you from
this hour, until I'll find a woman,' says he, "that's
foolisher than yourself." No sooner said than done: out
he walked, lavin' 'em after him to do as they plased.
Well, there was a long day before him, an' he walked a
dale before night-fall, an' he didn't know where he'd turn
to his bed and dinner. "But sure I'm aisy about it,"
says he, "sure while there's fools of women in the place,
I'll engage I needn't starve.' Well, he called a gossoon
that was going the road. "Whose farmhouse,' says he,
"is that I see over there?' 'It's belongin' to a widow
woman, sir,' said the boy. "What sort of a man was her
husband?" says Dan. "A small, dark man, an' wearin'
top-boots,' says the boy. Well became Dan, he made
for the house, an' axed for the lone woman. She was
standin' on the lawn lookin' at her cows milkin', when
Dan made towards her. "Well, where do you come
from ?" says the widow-woman. "From Heaven, ma'am,"
says Dan, makin' a bow. "From Heaven?" says she,
lookin' at him with her eyes open. 'Yes, ma'am,' says he,
for a little start. 'An' I seen your husband there too,
ma'am. "My husband, inagh P" says she, lookin' at him
very knowin'. Can you tell me what sort of a man he
was P' 'A small dark man,' says Dan, "an' wearin' top-

boots." "I give into you,' says she, "that's the man.
Come this way an' tell me what did he say to you, or did
ne give any message to me?' Well, Dan put no bounds
to his tongue, just to thry her. "He bid me tell you,
says he, "that he's very badly off for want o' victuals, an
he'd like to have the young grey horse to be ridin' for
himself, an' he'll do as much if you could send 'em to
him." "Why then I'll do that,' says the widow, "for he
was a good husband to me when he lived. "What time
will you be goin' back?' 'To-morrow or afther,' says
Dan, "afther I see my people.' 'Well, stay here to-night,'
says she, "an' I'll give you somethin' to take to him in
the mornin'.' Well became her, she brought him in, and
treated him like a prince that night, with music an'
dancing; an' in the mornin' she had the grey horse at the
doore with a bag o' flour, an' a crock o' butter, an' a
round o' corned beef. Well, Dan mounted the horse, an'
away with him home to his wife. 'Well, Jug,' says he,
"I'll take with you all my days, for, bad as you are,
there's more that's twice worse, an' I believe if I went
farther, 'tis worse an' worse I'd be gettin' to the world's
end.' So he up an' told 'em the whole business, and they
had a merry Supper that night, an' for weeks afther, on
what Dan brought home with him."
"He was a rogue for all," said Nelly, "to keep the
poor woman's horse upon her."
"She deserved it," said Danny, "an' worse. I never
hear o' such a fool. Well, Lowry, will you go to bed now
at last?"
The question was answered in the affirmative; and
Danny Mann was at the same time pressed to take a
share of the sweets of the table, which he resolutely
refused. Soon after, the careful Nelly, having made
Lowry turn his head another way, ascended by a ladder,
to a pallet on a loft over the parlour; while Lowry and
the little lord rolled into the settle-bed together, the one
to dream of breakers, raw onions, whisky, and "Misther
Hardress;" the other, of Foxy Dunat's mare, and the
black eyes of Syl Carney.

138 THE COLLEEN BAWN,
CHAPTER XV.
HOW HARDRESS SPENT HIS TIME WHILE KYRLE DALY WAS
ASLEEP.
ALL were now asleep except the two strangers, and the
silence which reigned throughout the little cottage showed
Hardress that no ear was capable of detecting his move
ments. He opened his room door softly, slipped his
shoes from his feet, and leaving the light burning on his
table, trusted to the famous sixth sense of the German
physiologists for a chance of finding his way among the
chairs and tables in the dark. He reached the door
without a stumble, and perceived by the light which
streamed through the keyhole and under the door of his
friend's apartment, that she still expected him.
Their meeting, though silent, was impassioned and
affectionate. Hardress inquired, with the tender and
sedulous attention of a newly-married man, whether she
felt any injurious effects from the stormwhether she
had changed her dress, and taken some refreshment
whether, in fine, her situation was in any way inconvenient
to her. *
"In no way at all, Mr. Hardress, as to any of these
things you mention," she replied in a low voice, for she
was fearful of waking Mrs. Frawley in the next room.
"But as to the mind! May Heaven never give you the
affliction of spending two such hours as I have done
since I entered this room l"
"My life! why will you speak so? What other course
remained for our adoption?" You know your father's
temper; he would as soon have died as sanctioned a
private marriage, such as ours must be for some time
longer. It would be absolute ruin to me if my mother
knew of my having contracted such an engagement
without consulting her wishes; and my father, as I have

THE COLLEEN BAWN. I39
before told you, will act exactly as she desires. And why
now, my love, will you indulge those uneasy humours?
Are you not my bride, my wife, the chosen of my heart,
and the future partner of my fortunes P Do you really
think that I would forget my little angel's feelings so far
as to omit anything in my power that might set her mind
at rest? If you do, I must tell you that I love you more
than you imagine."
"Oh, Mr. Hardress oh, don't say that at all, sir," said
the young woman, with frankness and ready warmth of
manner. "Only I was just thinking, an' I sitting by the
fire, what a heartbreak it would be to my father, if any-
body put it into his head that the case was worse than it
is" (here she hung down her head), "and no more would
be wanting but just a little word on a scrap o' paper to
let him know that he needn't be uneasy, and that he'd
know all in time."
This suggestion seemed to jar against the young gentle-
man's inclinations. "If you wish," said he, with a little
earnestness of voice, "I will return with you to Garryowen
to-morrow, and have our marriage made public from the
altar of John's Gate chapel. I have no object in seeking
to avoid my own ruin, greater than of preventing you
from sharing it. But if you will insist upon running
the hazardhazard?I mean, if you are determined
on certainly destroying our prospects of happiness, your
will shall be dearer to me than fortune or friends either.
If you have a father to feel for, you will not forget, my
love, that I have a mother whom I love as tenderly, and
whose feelings deserve some consideration at my hands."
The gentle girl seemed affected, but not hurt, at this
speech. "Don't be angry with me," she said, laying her
hand affectionately on his shoulder, "Don't be angry with
me, Mr. Hardress. I know I have a very bad head, and
can't see into everything at once; but one word from you
(and it needn't be an angry one either) is enough to open
my eyes. Insist, do you say, Mr. Hardress P Indeed
sir, I was never made to insist upon anything. But when
a thought, foolish as it is, once comes into my head, I
long to speak of it, to know what you will say, to know if

it is wrong or right. You wouldn't wish that I should
keep it from you, sir?"
"Never, oh, never ! Do not think of that."
"I never will practise it long, any way; for such
thoughts as those, if I were to hide them, would kill me
before a month. But keep always near me, my dear, dear
Mr. Hardress, for though you showed me that there is
nothing very criminal in what I have done, yet when you
leave me alone, the reasons go out of my head, and I
only think of what the neighbours are saying about me
this day, and of what my father must feel listening to
them. Don't think, now, sir, that I am going to question
what you tell me (for I trust in you, next to Heaven), but
if I am not so much to blame, why is it that my mind is
not at ease ? The storm, sir-oh, that storm When
the waves rose, and the boat rocked, and the wind howled
about me, how my feelings changed on a sudden I I
strove to look quiet before you, but my heart was leaping
for fear within me. When we sank down in the darkness,
and rose in the light, when the waves were dashin'in over
the side, and the sails were dippin' in the water, I thought
of my father's fireside, and I was sure it was the anger of
the Almighty hunting the disobedient child over the
dark waters. I thought I never would walk the land
againand how will it be, says I, if the boat breaks
under us, and my father is told that his daughter was
washed ashore a corpse, with a blot upon her name, and
no one living that can clear it? But, I give thanks to
Heaven l" the poor girl continued, clasping her hands,
and looking upward with tears in her eyes, "that judgment
has been spared ; not for my own merit, I am sure, but
its own mercy."
"And is not that a quieting remembrance, Eily P" said
her husband.
"Oh, that is not all," said Eily, "that is not the worst.
Every movement that I make seems to bring down the
anger of Heaven, since I first thought of deceiving my
father. Do you remember the morning of our marriage?"
she added, with a slight shudder, "I never can put that
frightful morning out of my mind. 'Tis always before my

eyes. The little room inside the sacristy, and the candles
burning on the small table, and the grey dawn just break
ing through the window. We did not marry, as other
people do, in their families, or in the open daylight,
We married in secret, like criminals in prison, without
preparation, without confession, or communion, or re-
pentance. We chose a priest that was disgraced by his
bishop, to give us the great sacrament for money. May
Heaven forgive him. How soon and how suddenly he
was called to judgment for that act l"
Hardress, who had himself been struck by the circum-
stance last alluded to, remained silent for a moment,
while his eyes were fixed upon the earth.
"Why did you go back to the chapel that time, Eily P"
he said at length, "after I parted from you at the door?"
"Everything looked bad and disheartening," said the
young woman; "I was just going to lift the latch of my
father's door, when I found that I had forgot the priest's
certificate. I went back to the chapel as fast as I could
walk. I passed through the sacristy and into the little
room. The certificate was there upon the table, the
candles were burning, and the clergyman was sitting
upright in his chaira dead man! Oh, I can no more tell
you how I felt that moment than if I was dumb. I thought
the world was coming to an end, and that I had no more
hold of life than of the wind that was going by me. I
ran out into the chapel, and strove to pray, but my blood
was boiling out at my fingers' ends. While I was on my
knees, I heard the people running to and fro in the
sacristy, and I hurried out of the chapel for fear I'd be
questioned."
"And did you go home at once?"
"No ; I took a walk first, to quiet my mind a little,
and when I did go home, I found my father was up, and
getting the breakfast ready before me. Ah, he deserved
a better daughter than Eily P"
"Come, come," said her husband, kindly, "you will be
a good daughter to him yet."
"I hope so, sir," said Eily in a mournful voice.
"There's one thing, at all events, he loves me very

well, and whenever I return, I'm sure of being easily
forgiven."
"And can you find no encouragement in that?" Har-
dress said, while he took her hand in his, and pressed
it in a soothing manner.
"You say that you have confidence in me, and the
few happy weeks that we have counted since our marriage
have furnished me with no occasion for complaint on
that subject. Continue yet a little longer to trust in your
own Hardress, and the time will shortly come when you
shall find that it was not bestowed in vain. Come now,
let me dry those sweet eyes, while I tell you shortly
what my plans shall be. You have heard me speak
of Danny Mann's sister, Naughten, who lives on the
side of the Purple Mountain, in the Gap of Dunlough
(you don't know those places now, but you'll be en-
chanted with them by-and-by). She is a good-natured
creature, though somewhat violent, and is, moreover,
entirely at my command. I have had two neat rooms
fitted up for you in her cottage, where you can have some
books to read, a little garden to amuse you, and a Kerry
pony to ride over the mountains, and see all that is to be
seen about the lakes. In the meantime I will steal a
visit now and then to my mother, who spends the
autumn in the neighbourhood. She loves me, I know,
as well as I love her, and that is very well. I will
gradually let her into my secret, and obtain her forgive-
nessI am certain she will not withhold itand my
father's will follow as a matter of course, for he has the
greatest respect for her opinions." [If Hardress had not
been Barney Cregan's son, he would have given this
respect another name.] "I shall then present you to
my mothershe will commend your modesty and gentle-
ness to my father, who will rap out an exclamation on
your beauty; we shall send for your father and priest
O'Connor to the hauling-home, and then where is the
tongue that shall venture to wag against the ame of Eily
Cregan P. If such a one there be, it shall never sting again,
for I will cut the venom out of it with my small-sword."
"Hush hush I sir. Do not speak so loud," cried the
## p. 143 (#147) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. I43
young woman, in some alarm; "there's one asleep in
the next room."
"Who is it? Mrs. Frawley?"
"The fat, good old woman that got dinner ready for
me."
"Never fear her. She is a hard-working, diligent
woman, that always minds the business she has in hand.
It was not to lie awake and make use of her ears that she
got between the blankets. Hark! there is a clearer proof
still that she is asleep. She must be dreaming of a hunt,
she imitates the horn of chase so finely. Well, Eily, be
ready to start for Ballybunion at sunrise in the morning.
You must contrive to slip down to the shore without
being seen by Lowry, or anybody else, if possible."
The creaking of the bed which sustained the ponderous
Mrs. Frawley, here startled the young and passionate,
though most ill-sorted pair. After a hurried good-night,
Hardress returned to his room, just in time to escape the
observation of the good dairy-woman, who had been
awaked out of a dream of pecks and keelers and fresh-
prints by the sound of voices in the stranger's room. On
opening the door, however, she was a little astonished to
observe her lovely guest in the attitude of devotion. De-
prived, by this circumstance, of the opportunity of putting
any awkward questions, Mrs. Frawley, after yawning once
or twice, and shaking her shoulders as often, tumbled into
bed again, and speedily resumed the same tune upon the
horn which had excited the admiration of Hardress.
Reader, I desire you not to think that this speedy fit
of devotion was a manoeuvre of the gentle Eily. The
sin, assuredly, was not done with reflection. But if the
case appears suspicious, go down upon your knees, and
pray that as (alas, the while !) it has not been the first, it
may be the last, instance in which religion shall be made
subservient to human and terrestrial purposes I
There was a slight feeling of chagrin mingled with the
happier emotions of the young husband as he prepared
for slumber. ...Gifted, as he was, with a quick perception
and keen feeling of the beautiful and worthy, the passion
he had conceived for the gentle Eily had been as sudden
## p. 144 (#148) ############################################
I44 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
as it was violent. The humility of her origin, at a period
when pride of birth was more considered in matrimonial
alliances than it is at present, might, it is true, have de-
terred him from contravening the wishes of his friends, if
the impression made on his imagination had been less
powerful; but his extreme youth, and the excelling beauty
of his bride, were two circumstances that operated
powerfully in tempting him to overlook all other counsels
than those which love suggested. He thought, never-
theless, that he acted towards Eily O'Connor with a
generosity which approached a species of magnanimity
in preferring her before the whole world and its opinions;
and perhaps, too, he entertained a little philosophical
vanity in the conceit that he had thus evinced an
independent reliance on his own mental resources, and
shown a spirit superior to the ordinary prejudices of
society. He felt, therefore, a little chagrined at Eily's
apparent slowness in appreciating so noble an effort, for
indeed she did him the justice to believe that it was a
higher motive than the love of self-adulation which in-
duced him to bestow upon her his hand and his affections.
But the reader is yet only partially acquainted with the
character of Hardress, and those early circumstances
which fashioned it to its present state of irregular and
imperfect virtue; we will, therefore, while that fiery heart
lies quenched in slumber, employ those hours of inaction
in a brief and comprehensive view of the natural qualities
and acquirements of our hero.
While Hardress Cregan was yet a child, he displayed
more symptoms of precocious ability than might have
shed a lustre on the boyhood of many a celebrated
genius. He obtained, even in his school days, the
soubriquet of "Counsellor," from his fondness for dis-
cussion, and the childish eloquence which he displayed
in maintaining a favourite position. His father liked him
for a certain desperation of courage, which he was apt to
discover on occasions of very inadequate provocation.
His mother, too, doated on him for a mother's own best
reasonthat he was her child. Indulgent she was, even
to a ruinous extent; and proud she was, when her
## p. 145 (#149) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. I45
sagacious acquaintances, after hearing her relate some
wonderful piece of wit in little Hardress, would compress
their lips, shake their heads with much emphasis, and
prophesy that "that boy would shine one day or another "
His generosity, too (a quality in which Mrs. Cregan was
herself pre-eminent), excited his mother's admiration, and
proved indeed that Hardress was not an ordinary child.

inclinations even to an effeminate degree. His very
generosity was a species of self-seeking, of that vulgar
quality which looks to nothing more than the gratification
of a suddenly awaked impulse of compassion, or, perhaps,
has a still meaner object for its stimulusthe gratitude
of the assisted, and the fame of an open hand. If this
failing were in Hardress, as in Charles Surface, the result
of habitual thoughtlessness and dissipation, it might
challenge agentler condemnation, and awaken pity rather
than dislike; but young Cregan was by no means in-
capable of appreciating the high merit of a due self-
government, even in the exercise of estimable dispositions.
He admired in Kyrle Daly that noble and yet unaffected
firmness of principle, which led him, on many occasions,
to impose a harsh restraint upon his own feelings, when
their indulgence was not in accordance with his notions
of justice. But Hardress Cregan, with an imagination

ance, and with a mind which displayed at intervals bursts
of energy which far surpassed the reach of his steady
friend, was yet the less estimable character of the two.
They were, nevertheless, well calculated for a lasting
friendship, for Kyrle Daly liked and valued the surpassing
talent of Hardress, and Hardress was pleased with the
even temper and easy resolution of his school-fellow.
Seldom, indeed, it was, that esteem formed any portion
in the leading motive of Hardress Cregan's attachments.
He liked for liking's sake, and as long only as his humour
lasted. It required but a spark to set him all on fire

but the flame was often as prone to smoulder, and
become extinct, as it was hasty to kindle. The reader is
already aware that he had formed, during his boyhood, a
passion for Anne Chute, who was then a mere girl, and
on a visit at Dinis Cottage. His mother, who, from his
very infancy, had arranged this match within her own
mind, was delighted to observe the early attachment of
the children, and encouraged it by every means in her
power. They studied, played, and walked together; and
all his recollections of the magnificent scenery of those
romantic mountain lakes were blended with the form, the
voice, the look, and manner of his childish love. The
long separation, however, which ensued when he was sent
to school, and from thence to college, produced a total
alteration in his sentiments; and the mortification which
his pride experienced on finding himself, as he imagined,
utterly forgotten by her, completely banished even the
wish to renew their old familiar life. Still, however, the
feeling with which he regarded her was one rather of
resentment than indifference, and it was not without a
secret creeping of the heart, that he witnessed what he
thought the successful progress of Kyrle Daly's attach-
ment.
It was under these circumstances that he formed his
present hasty union with Eily O'Connor. His love for
her was deep, sincere, and tender. Her entire and un-
bounded confidence, her extreme beauty, her simplicity
and timid deference to his wishes, made a soothing
compensation to his heart for the coldness of the haughty,
though superior beauty, whose inconstancy had raised
his indignation.
"Yes," said Hardress to himself, as he gathered the
blankets about his shoulders, and disposed himself for
sleep, "her form and disposition are perfect. Would
that education had been to her as kind as nature. Yet
she does not want grace nor talentbut that brogue !
Well, well, the materials of refinement are within and
around her, and it must be my task and my delight to
make the brilliant shine out that is yet dark in the ore.
I fear Kyrle Daly is, after all, correct in saying that I am

CHAPTER XVI.
HOW THE FRIENDS PARTED.
"Is Fighting Poll up yet, I wonder?" said Lowry Looby,
as he stood cracking his whip in the farm-yard, while
the morning was just beginning to break, and the
dairy people were tying down the firkins on his car.
"I'd like to see her before I'd go, to know would she
have any commands westwards. There's no hoult upon
her to hinder her speaking of a Friday whatever."
"Is who up?" exclaimed a shrill voice which pro-
ceeded from the grated window of the dairy. It was
that of the industrious Mrs. Frawley, who, as early, if not
as brisk and sprightly as the lark, was already employed
in setting her milk in the keelers.
"Fighting Poll of the Reeks," replied Lowry, turning
toward the wire grating, through which he beheld the
extensive figure of the dairy-woman, as neat as a bride,
employed in the health-giving, life-prolonging avocations.
"Who is she, why?" said Mrs. Frawley.
"Don't you know the girl that comes in the boat with
Mr. Cregan, an' slep' in the room outside you?"
"Oyeh . I didn't know who you meant. The boat-
man's handsome little sister P"
"Handsome, ayeh P"
"Yes, then, handsome. She has the dawniest little
nose I think I ever laid my two eyes upon."
"Why then, 'tis a new story wid it, for a nose. For-

merly, when I knew it, it was more like a button
musharoom than anything else, and the colour of a boiled
carrot. Good raison it had for that, as the publicans
could tell you." -
"Hold your tongue, man. Is it to drink you say she
used P"
"A thrifle, I'm tould."
"Eh, then, I never see one that has less sign of it than
what she has."
"She's altered lately, Danny Mann tells me. Nelly
aroo," he added, changing his tone"Somohur" to you,
now, an' get me a dram, for it's threatenin' to be a moist,
foggy mornin', an' I have a long road before me."
Nelly was occupied in liberating a whole regiment of
ducks, hens, pouts, chicks, cocks, geese, and turkeys,
who all came quacking, clucking, whistling, chirping,
crowing, cackling, and gobbling, through the open fowl-
house door into the yard, where they remained shaking
their wings on tiptoe, stretching their long necks over the
little pool, the surface of which was green, and covered
with feathersappearing to congratulate each other on
their sudden liberation, and seeming evidently disposed
to keep all the conversation to themselves.
"What is it you say, Lowry P Choke ye for ducks,
will ye let nobody spake but ye'rselves? What is it,
Lowry P"
Lowry repeated his request, making it more intelligible
amid the clamour of the farm-yard, by using a significant
gesture. He imitated the action of one who fills a glass
and drinks it. He then laid his hand upon his heart, and
shook his head, as if to imitate the comfort that would be
produced about that region by performing in reality what
be only mocked at present.
Nelly understood him as well as if he had spoken
volumes. Commissioned by Mrs. Frawley, she supplied
him with a bottle of spirits and a glass, with the use of
which, let us do Lowry the justice to say, there was not
a man in the barony better acquainted.
While he dashed from his eyes the tears which were
* A good husband.

produced by the sharpness of the stimulus, he heard foot-
steps behind him, and, looking round, beheld Danny the
Lord and the soi-disant Mrs. Naughten, still muffled in
her blue cloak and hood, and occupying a retired position
near the kitchen door.
"I'll tell you what it is, Nelly," said Lowry, with a
knowing wink to the soubrette. "Poll Naughten lives
very convanient on the Cork road, or not far from it, an
I do be often goin' that way of a lonesome night. I'll
make a friend o' Poll before she leaves this, so as that
she'll be glad to see me another time. I'll go over
and offer her a dhram. That I may be blest but I
will."
So saying, and hiding the bottle and glass under the
skirt of his coat, he moved toward the formidable heroine
of the mountains with many respectful bows, and a smile
of the most winning cordiality.
"A fine moist mornin', Mrs. Naughten. I hope you
feel no fatague afther the night, ma'am. Your sarvant,
Misther Mann. I hope you didn't feel us in the yard,
ma'am ; I sthrove to keep 'em quiet o' purpose. 'Tisn't
goen'ye are so airly, Misther Mann P"
Danny, who felt all the importance of directing Lowry
Looby's attention from his fair charge, could find no
means so effectual as that of acknowledging the existence
of a mystery, and admitting him into a pretended confi-
dence. Advancing, therefore, a few steps to meet him,
he put on a most serious countenance, and laid his finger
warily along his nose.
"What's the matther?" whispered Lowry, bending
down in the eagerness of curiosity.
Danny the Lord repeated the action, with the addition
of a cautionary frown.
"Can't she talk of a Friday, either?" said Lowry, much
amazed. "I understand, Misther Mann. Trust me for
the bare life. A nod is as good as a wink to a blind
horse."
"Or an ass, eider," muttered the hunchback, as he
turned away.
"But, Mr. Mann," cried Lowry, laying his immense

claw upon his lordship's shoulder, "listen, hether. The
mornen' will be smart enough, and maybe I'd betther
offer her a dhram, and she goen' upon the wather?"
He strode past the Lord, and was close to the muffled
fair one, when Danny pulled him back by the skirt.
"Didn't I tell you before," said he, "dat Poll never
drank?"
"Iss, of a Thursday, you said."
"Or a Friday, or any day. Oh den, oh den, Lowry 1"
"Well, I meant no harm. Maybe you'd have no vow
yourself on the head of it any way, sir?" And he dis.
played the bottle.
"Dere are tree kinds of oats, Lowry," responded
Danny Mann, as he twined his bony fingers fondly
around the neck of the bottle; "dere are tree kinds of
Oats dat are forbidden to be tuk as unlawful. Dey are
false oats, rash oats, and unjust oats. Now do you see
me, Lowry," he continued, as he filled his glass, "if I
made a vow o' dat kind, it would be an unjust oat, for it
would be traitin' myself very bad, a poor boy dat's night
an' day at sech cold work as mine, an' it would be a rash
oat, Lowry, for" [here he tossed off the spirits] "I'm
blest but it wouldn't be long before I'd make it a false
oat."
Lowry was greatly shocked at this unprincipled speech.
"That's a nate youth," he said privately to Nelly.
"That's a nice pet, not judging him. If that lad doesn't
see the inside of the Stone Jug" for some bad business
one time or another, I give you lave to say black is the
white of my eye. If the gallows isn't wrote upon his face,
there's no mait in mutton. Well, good mornen' to you,
Nelly, I see my load is ready. I have everything, now,
I suppose, Mrs. Frawley. Whup, get up here, you old
garron ] Good mornen' to you, Mrs. Naughten, an' a
fair wind after you. Good mornen', Misther Mann."
He cracked his whip, tucked the skirt of his riding-coat
under his arm, as usual, threw his little head back, and
followed the car out of the yard, singing in a pleasant,
contented key
*The gaol.

"Don't you remember the time I gave you my heart,
You solemnly swore from me you never would part?
But your mind's like the ocean,
Each notion
Has now taken flight,
And left me bemoaning the loss of the red-haired man's wife."
Kyrle Daly and his young friend were meanwhile ex-
changing a farewell upon the little gravel plot before the
front door.
"Come, come, go in out of the air," said Hardress,
"you shall not come down to the shore in that sight
dress. Remember what I have told you, and sustair
your spirits. Before another month shall pass, I pledge
myself to become master, for your sake, of Anne Chute's
secret."
"And to honour it?" said Kyrle, smiling as he gave
him his hand.
"According to its value," replied Hardress, tossing his
head. "Good-bye; I see Danny Mann and his sister
coming round, and we must not lose the morning's
tide."
They shook hands and parted.
It was one of those still and heavy mornings which are
peculiar to the close of summer in this climate. The
surface of the waters was perfectly still, and a light wreath
of mist steamed upward from the centre of the channel, so
as to veil from their sight the opposite shores of Clare.
This mist, ere long, became a dense and blinding fog,
that lasted until noon, and, together with the breathless
calm that lay upon the land and water, prevented thei
reaching Ballybunion until sunset. In one of those
caverns which are hollowed out of the cliffs on this shore,
the traveller may discern the remains of an artificia.
chamber. It was used at the period of which we write as
a kind of wareroom for contraband goods; a species of
traffic which was freely engaged in by nearly all the
middling gentry and small farmers along the coast. A
subterraneous passage, faced with dry stone-work, opened
into the interior of the country; and the chamber itself,
(rom constant use, had become perfectly dry and habit.

able. In this place Hardress proposed to Eily that they
should remain and take some refreshment, while Danny
the Lord was dispatched to secure a better lodging for
the night at some retired farmhouse in the neighbour-
hood.
A small canvas-built canoe, summoned from the interior
of the cave by a whistle from the lord, was employed to
convey them from the pleasure-boat into the gloomy
porch of this natural subterrain. Before the fragile skiff
had glided into the darkness, Eily turned her head to
catch a parting look at the descending sun. The scene
which met her gaze would have appeared striking, even
to an accustomed eye; and to one like hers, acquainted
only with the smoky splendour of a city sunset, it was
grand and imposing in the extreme. Before her lay the
gigantic portals of the Shannon, through which the mighty
river glided forth with a majestic calmness, to mingle
with the wide and waveless ocean that spread beyond
and around them. On her right arose the clifted shores
of Clare, over which the broad ball of day, although some
minutes hidden from her sight, seemed yet, by refrac-
tion, to hold his golden circlet suspended amid a broken
and brilliant mass of vapours. Eily kept her eyes fixed
in admiration on the dilated orb, until a turn in the cave
concealed the opening from her view, and she could only
see the stream of light behind, as it struck on the jagged
and broken walls of the orifice, and danced upon the
surface of the agitated waters.
The place to her seemed terrible. The hollow sound
of the boatman's voice, the loud plash of the oars, and
the rippling of the water against the vessel's prow, rever-
berating through the vaulted chambers, the impenetrable
darkness, into which they seemed to plunge headlong,
and reckless of danger or impediment, all united, consti-
tuted a scene so new to the simple Eily, that she grasped
close the arm of her husband, and held her breath for
some moments, as if in expectation of some sudden and
terrific encounter. In a little time the boatman rested on
his oars, and a voice from the interior of the cave was
heard exclaiming in Irish: "Is it himself?"
## p. 153 (#157) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 153
"It is," said the boatman in the same language.
"Light up the fire at once, and put down a few of the
fresh herrings. The lady is hungry."
"You will join for the first time, Eily," said Hardress,
"in a fisherman's supper. Well, Larry, had you much
luck last night?"
"Poor enough, masther," said the same oracular voice,
which Eily now recognised as that of the man to whose
escort she had been entrusted by Lowry Looby on the
previous evening. "We left Misther Daly's point as soon
as ever the wind fell, and come down as far as Kilcordane,
thinkin' we might come across the skull; but though we
were out all night, we took only five hundhert, more or
less. A' why don't you light up the fire, Phaudrigh P
And 'twasn't that the herrings didn't come into the river
either, for when the moon shone out we saw the skull to
the westward, making a curl on the waters as close an'
thick as if you threw a shovel-full of gravel in a pond."
The fire now blazed suddenly upward, revealing the
interior of the apartment before alluded to, and the figure
of the rough old boatman and his boy. The latter was
stooping forward on his hands, and kindling the fire with
his breath, while Larry Kett himself was rinsing a small
metal pot at the water side. The effect of the smoky and
subterraneous light upon uncouth and grisly figures, and
on the rude excavation itself, impressed the timid Eily
with a new and agitating sensation too nearly allied to
fear to leave her mind at ease.
In a few minutes she was seated on a small keg near
the fire, while Hardress hurried the men who were
preparing dinner. Larry Kett was not so proficient in
the science of gastronomy as the celebrated Louis of
Crockfords, and yet it is to be questioned whether the
culinary preparations of the latter were ever despatched
with more eagerness and satisfaction. Eily, indeed, only
ate a heroine's proportion; but she wondered at the
voracity of the boatmen, one of whom, placing a raw
onion on an unpeeled potato, swallowed both at a
mouthful, almost without employing a single masticatory
action.

Danny Mann, in the meantime, was occupied in pro-
curing a more eligible lodging for the night. He returned
when they had concluded their unceremonious meal, to
say that he had been successful in procuring two rooms
in the house of "a little 'oman dat kep' a private bottle
between that an' Beale."
"A private bottle 1" exclaimed Hardress; "what do
you mean by a private bottle P''
"I mean," replied the little lord, "dat she sell as good
a drop as if she paid licence for it; a ting she never was
fool enough to do."
"Where does she live?"
"Close to de road above. She told me" [here he
drew Hardress aside] "when I axed her, dat Miles of de
Ponies, an' de master, an' a deal o' gentlemen, went de
road westwards yesterday, an' dat Phil Naughten (Poll's
Phil) was in Beale waiten' for you dese two days with the
horse an' jauntin'-car."
"I am glad to hear it. Step over there to-night, and
tell him to be at the door before day-break to-morrow
morning. Tell him I will double his fare if he uses
diligence."
"Why, din, indeed," said Danny, "I'll tell him notin'
o' de sort. 'Twould be de same case wid him still, for
he's a boy dat if you gave him England, Ireland, and
Scotland for an estate, he'd ax de Isle o' Man for a
kitchen garden."
"Well, well, do as you please about it, Danny, but
have him on the spot. That fellow," he continued, speak-
ing to Eily as he conducted her out of the cavern, "that
fellow is so impudent sometimes, that nothing but the
recollection of his fidelity and the honesty of his motive,
keeps my hand at rest. He is my foster-brother, and, you
may perceive, with the exception of one deformity, a well-
looking man."
"I never observed anything but the hunch," said Eily.
"For which," added Hardress, with a slight change in
his countenance, "he has to thank his master."
"You, Mr. Hardress "
"Even so, Eily. When we were both children, that

young fellow was my constant companion. Familiarity
produced a feeling of equality, on which he presumed so
far as to offer a rudeness to a little relative of mine, a
Miss Chute, who was on a visit at my mother's. She
complained to me, and my vengeance was summary. I
met him at the head of the kitchen stairs, and without
even the ceremony of a single question or preparatory
speech, I seized him by the collar, and hurled him with
desperate force to the bottom of the flight. He was un-
able to rise as soon as I expected, and, on examination,
it was discovered that an injury had been done to the
spine, which, notwithstanding all the exertions that were
employed to repair it, had its result in his present
deformity."
"It was shocking," said Eily, with much simplicity of
feeling. "No wonder you should be kind to him."
"If I were a mere block," said Hardress, "I could not
but be affected by the good nature and kindly feeling
which the poor fellow showed on the occasion, and, in-
deed, down to the present moment. It seemed to be the
sole aim and study of his life to satisfy me that he
entertained not even a sentiment of regret for what had
happened, and his attachment ever since has been the
Attachment of a zealot. I know he cannot but feel that
his prospects in life have been made dark and lonely by
that accident; and yet he is congratulating himself when-
ever an opportunity occurs, on his good fortune in being
provided with a constant service, as if (poor fellow !) that
were any compensation to him. I have been alarmed to
observe that he sometimes attaches even a profane im-
portance to his master's wishes, and seems to care but
little what laws he may transgress when his object is the
gratification of my inclinations. I say, I am alarmed on
this subject, because I have taken frequent occasion to
remark that this injury to his spine has in some degree
affected his head, and left him less able to discern the
impropriety of such a line of conduct than people of
sounder minds."

CHAPTER XVII.
HOW HARDRESS LEARNED A LITTLE SECRET FROM A
DYING HUNTSMAN.
NotwitHSTANDING the message which Hardress Cregan
sent by Lowry Looby, it was more than a week before he
visited his parents at their Killarney residence. Several
days were occupied in seeing Eily pleasantly situated in
her wild cottage in the Gap, and a still greater number ir
enjoying with her the pleasures of an autumnal sojourn
amid these scenes of mystery, enchantment, and romance.
To a mind that is perfectly at freedom, Killarney forms in
itself a congeries of Elysian raptures; but to a fond bride
and bridegroom the Heaven, to which its mountains
rear their naked heads in awful reverence, alone can
furnish a superior happiness.
After taking an affectionate leave of his beautiful wife,
and assuring her that his absence should not be extended
beyond the following day, Hardress Cregan mounted one
of Phil Naughten's rough-coated ponies, and set off for
Dinis Cottage. It is not situated (as its name might seem
to import) on the sweet little island which is so called,
but far apart, near the ruined church of Aghadoe, com-
manding a distant view of the lower lake and the lofty
and wooded Toomies.
The sun had gone down before he left the wild and
rocky glen in which was situated the cottage of his bride.
It was, as we have already apprised the reader, the first
time Hardress had visited the lake since his return from
college, and the scenery, now, to his matured and well-
regulated taste, had not only the effect of novelty, but it
was likewise invested with the hallowing and romantic
charm of youthful association. The stillness so charac-
teristic of majesty, which reigned throughout the gigantic
labyrinth of mountain, cliff, and valley, through which he
## p. 157 (#161) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 157
rode; the parting gleam of sunshine that brightened the
ever-moving mists on the summit of the lofty peaks by
which he was surrounded; the solitary appearance of the
many nameless lakes that slept in black repose in the
centre of the mighty chasm; the echo of his horse's hoofs
against the stony road; the voice of a goat-herd's boy as
he drove homeward, from the summit of a heath-clad
mountain, his troublesome and adventurous charge; the
lonely twitter of the kirkeen dhra, or little water hen, as
it flew from rock to rock on the margin of the broken
streamthese, and other long forgotten sights and sounds
awakened at the same instant the consciousness of present
and the memory of past enjoyments, and gradually lifted
his thoughts to that condition of calm enthusiasm and
fulness of soul which constitutes one of the highest
pleasures of a meditative mind. He did not fail to recall
at this moment the memory of his childish attachment,
and could not avoid a feeling of regret at the unpleasing
change that education had produced in the character of
his first, though not his dearest love.
This feeling became still more deep and oppressive as
he approached the cottage of his father. Every object
that he beheldthe lawn, the grove, the stream, the hedge,
the stileall brought to mind some sweet remembrance
of his boyhood. The childish form of Anne Chute still
seemed to meet him with her bright and careless smile
at every turn in the path, or to fly before him over the
shorn meadow, as of old; while the wild and merry peal
of infant laughter seemed still to ring upon his hearing.
"Dear little being !" he exclaimed, as he rode into the
cottage avenue, "the burning springs of Gluver, I thought,
might sooner have been frozen than the current of that
once warm and kindly heart; but like those burning
springs, it is only in the season of coldness and neglect
that fountain can resume its native warmth. It is the
fervour of universal homage and adulation that strikes it
cold and pulseless in its channels."
The window of the dining-parlour alone was lighted
up, and Hardress was informed, in answe, to his inquiries,
that the ladies, Mrs. Cregan and Miss Chute, were gone

153 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
to a grand ball in the neighbourhood. Mr. Cregan, with
two other gentlemen, were drinking in the dining-room,
and, as he might gather from the tumultuous nature of
their conversation, and the occasional shouts of ecstatic
enjoyment, and bursts of laughter which rang through the
house, already pretty far advanced in the bacchanalian
ceremonies of the night. The voices he recognised
besides his father's, were those of Hepton Connolly aud
{r. Creagh, the duellist.
Feeling no inclination to join the revellers, Hardress
ordered candles in the drawing-room, and prepared to
spend a quiet evening by himself. He had scarcely, how-
ever, taken his seat on the straight-backed sofa, when his
retirement was invaded by old Nancy the kitchen-maid,
who came to tell him that poor Dalton, the huntsman,
was "a'most off," in the little green room, and that when
he heard Mr. Hardress had arrived, he begged of all
things to see him before he'd go. "He never was him-
self rightly, a'ra gal," said old Nancy, wiping a tear from
the corner of her eye, "since the masther sold the hounds,
and took to the cock-fighting."
Hardress started up and followed her. "Poor fellow !"
he exclaimed as he went along, "Poor Dalton | And is
that breath, that wound so many merry blasts upon the
mountain, so soon to be extinguished 2 I remember the
time when I thought a monarch on his throne a less
enviable being than our stout huntsman, seated on his
keen-eyed steed, in his scarlet frock and cap, with his
nounds, like painted couriers, thronging and baying round
nis horse's hoofs, and his horn hanging silent at his waist.
Poor fellow I Every beagle in the pack was his familiar
acquaintance, and was as jealous of his chirp or his
whistle, as my cousin Anne's admirers might be of a smile
or a secret whisper. How often has he carried me before
him on his saddle-bow, and taught me the true fox-hunting
cryl How often at evening has he held me between his
knees, and excited my young ambition with tales of hunts
hard run, and neck-or-nothing leaps; of double ditches,
cleared by an almost miraculous dexterity; of drawing,
yearning, challenging, hunting mute, hunting change, and

hunting counter. And now the poor fellow must wind
his last recheat, and carry his own old bones to earth at
length never again to awaken the echoes of the mountain
lakesnever again beneath the shadow of those im-
memorial woods that clothe their lofty shores
'AEre ciere viros, Martemque accendere cantul'
The fox may come from kennel, and the red-deer slumber
on his lair, for their mighty enemy is now himself at
bay."
While these reflections passed through the mind of
Hardress, old Nancy conducted him as far as the door
of the huntsman's room, where he paused for a moment
on hearing the voice of one singing inside. It was that of
the worn-out huntsman himself, who was humming over
a few verses of a favourite ballad. The lines which
caught the ear of Hardress were the following:
"Ah, huntsman dear, I'll be your friend,
If you let me go till morning;
Don't call your hounds for one half-hour,
Nor neither sound your horn;
For indeed I'm tired from yesterday's hunt,
I can neither run nor walk well,
Till I go to Rock-hill amongst my friends,
Where I was bred and born.
Tally ho the fox!
Taily ho the fox!
Tally ho the fox, a collauneen,
Tally ho the fox!
Over hills and rocks,
And chase him on till morning."
"He cannot be so very ill," said Hardress, looking at
the old woman, "when his spirits will permit him to sing
so merrily."
"Oyeh, Heaven help you, agra !" replied Nancy: "I
believe if he was at death's doore this moment, he'd have
that song on his tongue still."
. "Hush hush "said Hardress, raising his hand, "he
is beginning again."
. The ballad was taken up, after a heavy fit of coughing,
in the same strain.

"I locked him up an' I fed him well,
An' I gave him victuals of all kinds;
But I declare to you, sir, when he got loose,
He ate a fat goose in the morning.

For you'll surely die this morning.

Hardress here opened the door and cut short the refrain,
The huntsman turned his face to the door as he heard
the handle turn. It was that of a middle-aged man in
the very last stage of pulmonary consumption. A red
night-cap was pushed back from his wasted and sunken
temples, and a flush like the bloom of a withered pippin
played in the hollow of his fleshless cheek.
"Cead millia fealthal My heart warms to see you, my
own Masther Hardress," exclaimed the huntsman, reach-
ing him a skeleton hand from beneath the brown quilt,
"I can die in peace now, as I see you again in health.
These ten days back they're telling me you're coming
an' coming, until I began to think at last that you
wouldn't come until I was gone."
"I am sorry to see you in this condition, Dalton. How
did you get the attack?"
"Out of a could I think I got it first, sir. When the
masther sold the hounds(Ah, Masther Hardress to
think of his parting them dogs, an' giving up that fine,
manly exercise for a paltry parcel o' cocks an' hens !) but
when he sold them, an' took to the cock-fighting, my
heart felt as low an' as lonesome as if I lost all belonging
to me ! To please the masther I turned my hand to the
cocks, an' used to go every morning to the hounds' kennel,
where the birds were kept, to give 'em food an' water
but I could never warm to the birds. Ah, what is a cock-
fight, Masther Hardress, in comparison of a well-rode
hunt among the mountains, with your horse flying under
you like a fairy, an' the cry o' the hounds like an organ
out before you, an' the ground fleeting like a dream on
all sides o' you, an' ah! what's the use o' talking !" Here

he lay back on his pillow with a look of sudden pain and
sorrow that cut Hardress to the heart.
After a few moments, he again turned a ghastly eye on
Hardress, and said in a faint voice: "I used to go down
by the lake in the evening to hear the stags belling in the
wood; an' in the morning I'd be up with the first light
to blow a call on the top o' the hill, as I used to do to
comfort the dogs; an' then I'd miss their cry, an' I'd stop
listenin' to the aychoes o' the horn among the mountains
till my heart would sink as low as my ould boots. An'
bad boots they wor, too; signs on, I got wet in 'em ; an'
themselves an' the could morning air, an' the want o' the
horse exercise, I believe, an' everything, brought on this
fit. Is the misthress at home, sir?" he added, after
struggling through a severe fit of oppression.
"No, she is at a ball with Miss Chute."
"Good luck to them both, wherever they are. That's
the way o' the world. Some in health, an'some in sick-
mess; some dancing, an' more dying."
Here he raised himself on his elbow, and after casting
a haggard glance around, as if to be assured that what he
had to say could not be overheard, he leaned forward
towards Hardress, and whispered: "I know one in this
house, Masther Hardress, that loves you well."
The young gentleman looked a little surprised.
"Indeed I do," continued the dying huntsman, "one,
too, that deserves a better fortune than to love any one
without a return. One that was kind to me in my sick-
ness, and that I'd like to see happy before I'd leave the
world, if it was Heaven's will."
During this conversation, both speakers had been
frequently rendered inaudible by occasional bursts of
laughter and shouts of bacchanalian mirth from the
dining-room. At this moment, and before the young
gentleman could select any mode of inquiry into the
particulars of the singular communication above men-
tioned, the door was opened, and the face of old Nancy
appeared, bearing on its smoke-dried features a mingled
expression of perplexity and sorrow.
"Dalton, ara gall" she exclaimed, don't blame me for
$.

164 THE COLLEEN BAWN
what I'm going to say to you, for it is my tongue, an' not
my wish nor my heart that speaks it. The masther and
the gentlemen sent me in to you, an' bid me tell you, for
the sake of old times, to give them one fox-huntin'screech
before you go."
The old huntsman fixed his brilliant but sickly eyes
on the messenger, while a flush that might have been
the indication of anger or of grief, flickered like a decay-
ing light upon his brow. At length he said: "An' did
the masther send that message by you, Nancy?"
"He did, Dalton, indeed. Ayeh, the gentlemen must
be excused."
"True for you, Nancy," said the huntsman, after a long
pause ; then raising his head with a smile of seeming
pleasure, he continued: "Why then, I'm glad to see the
masther hasn't forgot the dogs entirely. Go to him,
Nancy, an' tell him that I'm glad to hear that he has so
much o' the sport left in him still. And that it is kind
father for him to have a feeling for his huntsman, an' I
thank him. Tell him, Nancy, to send me in one good
glass o' parliament punch, an' I'll give him such a cry as
he never heard in a cock-pit, any way."
The punch was brought, and, in spite of the remon-
strances of Hardress, drained to the bottom. The old
huntsman then sat erect in the bed, and letting his head
back, indulged in one prolonged "hoicks 1" that made
the phials jingle on the table, and frightened the sparrows
from their roosts beneath the thatch. It was echoed by
the jolly company in the dining-parlour, chorussed by a
howling from all the dogs in the yard, and answered by a
general clamour from the fowl-house. "Another An-
other Hoicks 1" resounded through the house. But the
poor consumptive was not in a condition to gratify the
revellers. When Hardress looked down upon him next,
the pillow appeared dark with blood, and the cheek of
the sufferer had lost even the unhealthy bloom, that had
so long masked the miner Death in his work of snug
destruction. A singular brilliancy fixed itself upon his
eye-balls, his lips were dragged backward, blue and cold,
and with an expression of dull and general painhis

teeth but wherefore linger on such a picture?it is
better let the curtain fall.
Hardress Cregan felt less indignation at this circum-
stance than he might have done if it had occurred at the
present day; but yet he was indignant. He entered the
dining-parlour to remonstrate, with a frame that trembled
with passion.
"And pray, Hardress," said Hepton Connolly, as he
emptied the ladle into his glass, and turned on him an
eye whose steadiness, to say the least, was equivocal ;
"pray, now, Hardress, is poor Dalton really dead?"
"He is, sir. I have already said it."
"No offence, my boy. I only asked, because if he be,
it is a sure sign [here he sipped his punch, and winked at
Cregan with the confident air of one who is about to say
a right good thing], it is a sign that he never will die
again."
There was a loud laugh at Hardress, which confused
him as much as if he had been discomfited by a far
superior wit. So true it is, that the influence, and not
the capacity of an opponent renders him chiefly formid-
able, and that, at least, a fair half of the sum of human
motive may be placed to the account of vanity.
Hardress could think of nothing that was very witty to
say in reply, and as the occasion hardly warranted a slap
on the face, his proud spirit was compelled to remain
passive. Unwilling, however, to leave the company while
the laugh continued against him, he called for a glass
and sat down amongst them.

* 64 THE COLLEEN BAWN,
CHAPTER XVIII.
How THE GENTLEMEN SPENT THE Evening, which
PROVED RATHER WARMER THAN HARDRESS EXPECTED.
"PEACE * said Hepton Connolly, with a face of drunken
seriousness, "peace to the manes of poor Dalton."
"Amen, with all my heart 1" exclaimed Mr. Cregan,
"although the cocks are well rid of him. But a better
horseman never backed a hunter."
"I drink him," said Hyland Creagh, "although I
seldom care to toast a man who dies in his bed."
"That's all trash and braggery, Creagh," cried Con-
nolly; "we'll have you yet upon the flat of your back,
and roaring for a priest into the bargain."
"Upon my honour as a gentleman, I am serious," said
Creagh. "They may talk of the field of battle and
bloody breaches, forlorn hopes and hollow squares, and
such stuff, but what is the glory of a soldier after all ! To
drag through the fatigues of a whole campaign, with its
concomitants of night-watches, marches in marshes, and
bivouacs in rainy weather, and with no brighter prospect
at the year's end than that of making one among half
a million of fighting fellows who are shot on a heap
like larks; and even then you meet, not hand to hand,
but cloud to cloud, moving about in a flock, and waiting
your turn to take your allowance of cold lead, and fill a
pit with your neighbours. Glory ! What glory is there in
figuring in small types among a list of killed and wounded?
the utmost distinction that a poor sub can ever hope for.
Why, a coward is no more ball-proof than a gallant fellow,
and both may often shine together upon the same list.
Nomy ambition should have a higher aim. While I
live, let my life be that of a fearless fellow; and when I
die, let my epitaph be found in a handsome paragraph,

o'clockmeeting took placeHyland Creagh, Esquire,
attended by Blank, Esquireand Captain Blank, at-
tended by Blank, Esquireregret to stateMr. Creagh
third firemortally woundedborne from the ground.
The affair, we understand, originated in a dispute re-
specting a lovely and accomplished young lady, celebrated
as a reigning toast in that quarter.'"
"And grand-niece, we understand," added Hardress,
laughing, "to the unhappy gentleman whose fate we have
just recorded."
There was a laugh at Creagh.
"Nay, my young friend," he said, adjusting his ruffles
with the air of a Chesterfield, "the journal that shall
mention that circumstance must be dated many years
hence."
"Adad, not so far off neither, Creagh," exclaimed Mr.
Cregan, "and if you were to go out to-morrow morning,
I should not like to see you go posting to the Devil upon
such a mission as that."
"Talking of the Devil," said Hepton Connolly, "did
you hear, Creagh, that the priest is to have us all upon
the altar next Sunday, on account of that little squib we
had in the mountains the day of the races?"
"It may be," said Creagh, with a supercilious smile;
"mais ce n'est pas mon affaire. I have not the honour to
belong to his communion."
"Oh," cried Mr. Cregan, "true enough. You belong
to the genteel religion."
"There you have the whip-hand of me," said Connolly,
"for I am a Papist. Well, Creagh, not meaning to im-
pugn your gallantry now, I say this: a Papist, to fight a
duel, requires and possesses the courage of a Protestant
ten times over."
"Pray, will you oblige me with a reason for that
pleasant speech?"
""Tis as clear as this glass. A Protestant is allowed a
wide discretionary range on most ethical, as well as theo-
logical, points of opinion. A poor Papist has none. The
Council of Trent, in its twenty-fifth session (I have it from

the Bishop), excommunicates all duellists, and calls the
practice an invention of the Devil. And what can I say
against it? I know something of the common law and
the rights of things, persons, and so forth, but the
canonical code to me is a fountain sealed. 'Tis some-
thing deeper than a cause before the petty sessions. 'Tis
easier to come at Blackstone, or even Coke upon Little-
ton himself, than at Manochius or St. Augustine."
"Well, but how you run on 1 You were talking about
the courage of a Protestant and Catholic."
"I say a Papist must be the braver man, for, in addition
to his chance of being shot through the brains on a frosty
morning in this world (a cool prospect), it is no joke to
be damned everlastingly in the next."
"That never struck me before," exclaimed Cregan.
"And if it had," said Creagh, "I confess I do not see
what great disadvantage the reflection could have pro-
duced to our friend, Connolly, for he knew that, whether
he was to be shot yesterday in a duel, or physicked out
of the world twenty years hence, that little matter of the
other life will be arranged in precisely the same manner."
"As much as to say," replied Connolly, "that now or
then the Devil is sure of his bargain."
"My idea precisely, but infinitely better expressed."
"Very good, Creagh. I suppose it was out of a filial
affection for the sooty old gentleman you took so much
pains to send me to him the other morning."
"You placed your honour in my hands, and I would
have seen you raked fore and aft fifty times, rather than
let the pledge be tarnished. If you did go to the Devil,
it was my business to see that you met him with clean
hands."
"I feel indebted to you, Creagh."
"I have seen a dozen shots exchanged on a lighter
quarrel. I was present myself at the duel between
Hickman and Leake, on a somewhat similar dispute.
They fired fourteen shots each, and when their ammuni-
tion was exhausted, actually remained on the ground
until the seconds could fetch a new supply from the
nearest market town."
## p. 167 (#171) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN 167
"And what use did they make of it when it came?"
"Give me time, and you shall hear. 'Twas Hickman's
fire, and he put his lead an inch above Leake's right hip
(as pretty a shot as ever I saw in my life). Leake was
not killed though, and he stood to his ground like a
man. I never will forget the ghastly look he gave me
(I was his second), when he asked whether the laws of
the duello would allow a wounded man a chair. I was
confident they did so long as he kept his feet upon the
sod, and I said so. Well, the chair was brought. He
took his seat somewhat in this manner, grasping the
orifice of the wound closely with his disengaged hand.
[Here the speaker moved his chair some feet from the
table, in order to enact the scene with greater freedom.]
There was a fatal steadiness in every motion. I saw
Hickman's eye wink, and not without a cause. It winked
again, and never opened after. The roof of his skull
was literally blown away. -
"And the other fellow P"
"The other gentleman fell from his chair a corpse at
the same moment, after uttering a sentiment of savage
satisfaction, too horrible, too blasphemous to think of,
much less to repeat."
"They were a murderous pair of ruffians," said Har-
dress, "and ought to have been impaled upon a cross-
road."
"One of them," observed Hyland Creagh, sipping his
punch, "one of them was a cousin of mine."
"Oh I and, therefore, utterly blameless, of course,"
said Hardress, with an ironical laugh.
"I don't know," said Creagh, "I confess I think it a
hard word to apply to a gentleman, who is unfortunate
enough to die in defence of his honour."
"Honour !" exclaimed Hardress, with indignant zeal
(for though he was no great devotee, he had yet some
gleams of a half-religious virtue shining through his
character). "Call you that honour? I say a duellist is
a murderer, and worthy of the gallows, and I will prove
it. The question lies in the justice or injustice of the
mode of reparation. That cannot be a just one which
## p. 168 (#172) ############################################
168 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
subjects the aggressor and aggrieved to precisely the
same punishment. If the duellist be the injured party,
he is a suicide; and if the inflicter of the wrong, he is a
murderer."
"Aye, Hardress," said his father, "but there are
CaSeS 22
"Oh, I know what you mean, sir. Fine, delicate, thin-
spun modes of insult, that draw on heavier assaults, and
leave both parties labouring under the sense of injury.
But they are murderers still. If I filled a seat in the
legislature, do you think I would give my voice in favout
of a law that made it a capital offence to call a man a
scoundrel in punishment? And shall I dare to inflict
with my own hand in the streets that which I would
shudder to see committed by the hangman."
"But if public war be justifiable," said Connolly, "why
should not private?" -
"Aye," exclaimed Hardress, "I see you have got that
aphorism of Johnson's, the fat moralist, to support you,
but I say shame upon the recreant, for as mean and
guilty a compliance with the prejudices of the world as
ever parasite betrayed. I stigmatise it as a wilful sin, for
how can I esteem the author of Rasselas a fool?"
"Very hardly," said Creagh, "and pray what is your
counter-argument?"
"This : public war is never (when justifiable) a quarrel
for sounds and conventional notions of honour; public
war is at best a social evil, and cannot be embraced with-
out the full concurrence of society, expressed by its
constituted authorities, and obtained only in obedience
to the necessity of the case. But to private war society
has given no formal sanction, nor does it derive any
advantage from the practice."
"Upon my word," said Creagh, "you have some very
curious ideas."
"Well, Hardress," exclaimed Connolly, "if you have a
mind to carry those notions into practice, I should re-

commend you to try it in some other country besides
Ireland; you will never go through with it in this."
"In every company, and on every soil," said Hardress,
"I will avow my sentiments. I never will fight a duel;
and I will proclaim my purpose in the ears of all the
duellists on earth."
"But society, young gentleman
"I bid society defianceat least that reckless, godless,
heartless crew, to whom you wrongfully apply the term.
The greater portion of those who bow down before this
bloody error, is composed of slaves and cowards, who
are afraid to make their own conviction the guide of
their conduct
'Letting I dare not wait upon I would,
Like the poor cat i' the adage."
"I am sure," said Creagh, "I had rather shoot a man
for doubting my word, than for taking my purse."
"Because you are as proud as Lucifer," exclaimed
Hardress. "Who but the great father of all injustice
would say that he deserved to be shot for calling you a
(it is an unpleasant word, to be sure)a liar P"
"But he does more; he actually does strike at my life
and property, for I lose both friends and fair repute if I
suffer such an insult to pass unnoticed."
In answer to this plea, Hardress made a speech, of
which (as the newspapers say) we regret that our space
does not allow us to offer more than a mere outline. He
contended that no consequences could justify a man in
sacrificing his own persuasion of what was right to the
error of his friends. The more general this error was,
the more criminal it became to increase the number of
its victims. The question was not whether society would
disown or receive the passive gentleman, but whether
'society was in the wrong or in the right; and if the
former, then he was bound to adopt the cause of justice
at every hazard. He drew the usual distinction between
whoral and animal courage, and painted with force and
feeling the heroism of a brave man encountering alone
the torrent of general opinion, and taking more wounds
upon his spirit than ever Horatius Cocles risked upon his

person. He quoted the celebrated passage of the fifth-
ful seraph in Milton, alluded to the Athenian manders,
and told the well-known story of Lucian Anacharsis, all
which tended considerably more to exhaust the patience
than to convince the understanding of his hearers.
"Finally," said he, "I denounce the system of private
war because it is the offspring of a barbarous pride. It
was a barbarous pride that first suggested the expedient,
and it is an intolerable pride that still sustains it. Talk
of public war ! The world could not exist if nation were
to take up the sword against nation upon a point of
honour, such as will call out for blood between man and
man. The very word means pride. It is a measureless,
bloody pride, that demands a reparation so excessive for
every slight offence. Take any single quarrel of them all,
and dissect its motive, and you will find every portion of
it stained with pride, the child of selfishnesspride, the
sin of the first Devilpride, the poor, pitiful creature of
folly and ignorancepride, the 2x
"Oh, trash and stuff, man," exclaimed Connolly, losing
patience; if you are going to preach a sermon, choose
another time for it. Come, Creagh, send the bowl this
way, and let us drink. Here, young gentleman, stop
spouting, and give us a toast. You'll make a fool of
yourself, Hardress, if you talk in that manner among
gentlemen."
Without making any answer to this speech (which,
however, he felt a little difficulty in digesting), Hardress
proposed the health and future fame of young Kyrle,
Daly.
"With all my heart," exclaimed both his father and
Connolly.
"I'll not drink it," said Creagh, putting from him his
glass.
Hardress was just as proud (to borrow his own simile).
as Lucifer himself, and probably it was on this account
he held the quality so cheap. It must be admitted, like-
wise, that his ambitious love of singularity formed but
too considerable a part of his motive in the line of
argument which he had followed up; and he was by no.

means prepared to perform the heroic part which he had
described with so much enthusiasm. Least of all could
he be expected to do so at the present moment; for
while he was speaking, he had also been drinking, and the
warmth of dispute, increased by the excitement of strong
drink, left his reason still less at freedom than it might
have been under the dominion of an ordinary passion.
He insisted upon Creagh's drinking his toast.
"I shall not drink it," said Creagh, "I consider him.
as an impertinent puppy."
"He is my friend," said Hardress.
"Oh, then, of course," said Fireball, with an ironical
smile, evidently intended as a retort, "he is utterly
blameless."
To use a vulgar but forcible expression, the blood of
Hardress was now completely up. He set his teeth for
a moment, and then discharged the contents of his own
glass at the face of the offender. The fire-eater, who,
from long experience, was able to anticipate this pro-
ceeding, evaded by a rapid motion the degrading missile,
and then quietly resuming his seat, "Be prepared, sir,"
he said, "to answer this in the morning,"
"I am ready, now," exclaimed Hardress. "Connolly,
lend me your sword, and be my friend. Father, do you.
second that gentleman, and you will oblige me."
Mr. Barnaby Cregan rose to interfere; but in doing so,
he betrayed a secret which had till that moment lain with
himself; he was the first who fell.
"No, no swords," said Connolly, "there are a pretty
pair of pistols over the chimney-piece. Let them decide
the quarrel."
It was so agreed. Hardress and Creagh took their
places in the two corners of the room, upon the under-
standing that both were to approach step by step, and
fire when they pleased. Hepton Connolly took his place
out of harm's way in a distant corner, while Cregan crept
along the floor, muttering in an indistinct tone: "Drunk?
aye, but not dead drunk. I call no man dead drunk
while he lies on the high road, with sense enough to roll
out of the way when a carriage is driving towards him."
## p. 172 (#176) ############################################
172 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Hardress fired after having made two paces. Creagh,
who was unhurt, reserved his shot until he put the pistol
up to the head of his opponent. Hardress never flinched,
although he really believed that Creagh was about t
shoot him.
"Come," said he loudly, "fire your shot, and have
done with it. I would have met you at the end of a
handkerchief upon my friend's quarrel."
Hyland Creagh, after enjoying for a moment the
advantage he possessed, uncocked his pistol, and laid it
on the table.
"Hardress," said he, "you are a brave fellow. I
believe I was wrong. I ask your pardon, and am ready
to drink your toast."
"Oh, well," said Hardress, with a laugh, "if that be
the case, I cannot, of course, think of pursuing the
affair any further." And he reached his hand to his
opponent with the air of one who was exercising rather
than receiving a kindness.
The company once more resumed their places at the
table somewhat sobered by this incident, which, though
not unusual at the period, was yet calculated to excite a
little serious feeling. It was not long, however, before
they made amends for what was lost in the way of
intoxication. The immense blue jug, which stood in-
side the fender, was replenished to the brim, and the
bowl flew round more rapidly than ever. Creagh told
stories of the Hell-Fire Club in the sweating and pinking
days. Connolly overflowed with anecdotes of attorneys
outdone, of plates well won, of bailiffs mained and
beaten; and Cregan, whose tongue was the last member
of his frame that became accessory to the sin of intoxi-
cation, filled up his share in the conversation with
accounts of cocks and of ghosts, in the appearance of
which last he was a firm though not a fearful believer.
Hardress remained with the company until the sound of
a vehicle drawn up at the hall-door announced the return
of his mother and cousin. He then left the room and
hurried to his own apartment, in order to avoid meeting
them under circumstances which he well supposed were

kitchen at the moment of the dispute above detailed.
Old Nancy was preparing the mould candles for poor
Dalton's wake when she heard the shot fired in the
dining-parlour.
"Run in to the gentlemen, Mike, eroo," she exclaimed,
without even laying aside the candle, which she was
paring with a knife, in order to make it fit the socket
more exactly. "I lay my life the gentlemen are fighting
a fewel."
"It can't be a jewel," said Mike, the servant boy, who
was courting slumber in a low chair before the blazing
fire, "it can't be a jewel, when there was only one shot."
"But it isn't far from 'em, I'll be bail, till they'll fire
another, if they do not be hindered; for 'tis shot for shot
with 'em. Run in, eroo."
The servant boy stretched his limbs out lazily, and
rubbed his eyes. "Well," said he, "fair play all the
world over. If one fired, you wouldn't have the other
put up with it, without havin' his fair revinge?"
"But maybe one of 'em is kilt already l' observed
Nancy.
"E'then, d'ye hear this? Sure you know well that if
there was anybody shot, the master would ring the bell."
This observation was conclusive. Old Nancy pro-
ceeded with her gloomy toil in silence, and the persuasive
Mike, letting his head hang back from his shoulders, and
crossing his hands upon his lap, slept soundly on, un-
disturbed by any idle conjectures on the cause of the
noise which they had heard.

CHAPTER XIX.
HOW HARDRESS MET AN OLD FRIEND AND MADE A
NEW ONE.
FANCY restored the dreaming Hardress to the society of
his beloved Eily. He sat by her side once more, quieting,
with the caresses of a boyish fondness, her still recurring
anxieties, and comforting her apprehensions by endeavour-
ing to make her share his own steady anticipation of his
mother's favour and forgiveness. This hope, on his own
part, it must be acknowledged, was much stronger in his
sleeping than his waking moments; for it was extra-
ordinary how different his feeling on that subject became
after he had reached his home, and when the moment of
disclosure drew near. His extreme youth, all ruined as
he was by over-indulgence, made him regard his mother
with a degree of reverence that approached to fear; and
as he seldom loved to submit when once aroused to
contest, so he was usually careful to avoid, as much as
possible, any occasion for the exercise of his hereditary
perseverance. The influence of his parent, however,
consisted not so much in her parental authority, as in the
mastery which she held over his filial affections, which
} artook of the intensity that distinguished his entire
character. Mrs. Cregan governed both her husband and
her son; but the means which she employed in moulding
each to her own wishes, were widely different. In her
arguments with the former it was her usual practice to
begin with an entreaty and end with a command. On
the contrary, when she sought to work upon the inclina-
tions of Hardress, she opened with a command, and
closed with an entreaty. It was, indeed, as Hardress had
frequently experienced, a difficult task to withstand her
instances, when she had recourse to the latter expedient.
IMrs. Cregan possessed all the national warmth of tempera-

ment and liveliness of feeling. Like all naturally generous
people, whose virtue is rather the offspring of a kindly
heart than a well-regulated understanding, Mrs. Cregan
was not more boundless in her bounty than in her
exaction of gratitude. She not only looked for gratitude
from those whom she had obliged, but was so exorbitant
as to imagine that all those, likewise, whom she really
wished to serve, should return her an equal degree of
kindness, and actually evince as lively a sense of obliga-
tion as if her wishes in their favour had been deeds.
Alas! in this selfish world we are told that real benefits
are frequently forgotten by the receiver, and sometimes
repaid by cold unkindness or monstrous hostility. It is
no wonder, then, that Mrs. Cregan should have some-
times found people slow to appreciate the value of her
vain desires.
While Hardress was still murmuring some sentiment
of passionate admiration in the ear of his visionary bride,
he was awakened by the pressure of a light finger on his
shoulder. He looked up, and beheld a lady in a broad-
leafed beaver hat and ball-dress standing by his bed-side,
and smiling down upon him with an air of affection and
reproof. Her countenance, though it had already ac-
quired, in a slight degree, that hardness of outline which
marks the approach of the first matronal years, was
striking, and even beautiful in its character. The fore-
head was high and commanding, the eye of a dark hazel,
well opened, and tender and rapid in its expression. The
entire face had that length of feature which painters
employ in their representation of the tragic muse, and
the character of the individual had given to this natural
conformation a depth of feeling which was calculated to
make a strong, and even a gloomy impression on the
imagination of the beholder. Her person likewise partook
of this imposing character, and was displayed to some
advantage by her dress, the richness of which was
perfectly adapted to her lofty and regal air. It consisted
of a beautiful poplin, a stomacher set off with small
brilliants, and a rich figured silk petticoat which was fully
displayed in front. The skirt of the gown parted and fell

back from either side, while a small hoop, occupying the
position of the modern Vestris, imparted to this interesting
portion of the figure a degree of fashionable slimness and
elegance. An amber necklace, some enormous brooches,
and rings containing locks of hair, the bequests of three
preceding generations, completed the decorations of her
person.
"You are a pretty truant," she said, "to absent your-
self for a whole fortnight together, and at a time, too,
when I had brought a charming friend to make your
acquaintance. You are a pretty truant. And immediately
on your return, instead of showing any affectionate
anxiety to compensate for your inattention, you run off
to your sleeping-chamber, and oblige your foolish mother
to come and seek you."
"My trim, mother, would have hardly become your
drawing-room."
"Or looked to advantage in the eyes of my lovely
visitor?"
"Upon my word, mother, I had not a thought of her.
I should feel as little inclined to appear wanting in
respect to you, as to any visitor to whom you could
introduce me."
"Respect" echoed Mrs. Cregan, while she laid the
light away upon the dressing-table (in such a position
that it could shine full and bright upon the features of
her son), and took a chair near his bedside. "Respect
is fond of going well-dressed, I grant you; but there is
another feeling, Hardress, that is far more sensitive and
exquisite on points of this nature, a feeling much more
lively and anxious than any that a poor fond mother can
expect. Do not interrupt me; I am not so unreasonable
as to desire that the course of human nature should be
inverted for my sake. But I have a question to ask you.
Have you any engagement during the next month that
will prevent your spending it with us? If you have, and
if it be not a very weighty one, break it off as politely as
you can. You owe some little attention to your cousin,
and I think you ought to pay it."
Hardress looked displeased at this, and muttered some-
## p. 177 (#181) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 177
thing about his inability to see in what way this obligation
had been laid upon him.
"If you feel no disposition to show a kindness to your
old play-fellow," said his mother, endeavouring to suppress
her vexation, "you are of course at liberty to act as you
please. You, Hardress, in your own person, owe nothing
to the Chutes, unless you except their general claim as
near relatives of mine."
"They could not, my dear mother, possess a stronger.
But this is a sudden change. While I was in Dublin, I
thought that both you and my father had broken off the
intercourse that subsisted between the families, and lived
altogether within yourselves."
"It was a foolish coldness that had arisen between
your aunt and myself, on account of some free, some very
free expressions she had used with regard to your father.
But when she fell ill, and my poor darling Anne was left
to struggle, unassisted beneath the weight of occupation
that was thrown thus suddenly upon her hands, my self-
respect gave way to my love for them both. I drove to
Castle Chute, and divided with Anne the cares of nurse-
tending and house-keeping, until my dear Hetty's health
was in some degree restored. About a fortnight since, by
the force of incessant letter-writing, and the employment
of her mother's influence, I obtained Anne's very reluctant
consent to spend a month at Killarney. Now, my dear
Hardress, you must do me a kindness. I have no female
friend of your cousin's age, whose society might afford
her a constant source of enjoyment, and, in spite of all
my efforts to procure her amusement, I cannot but
observe that she has been more frequently dull than
merry since her arrival. Now, you can prevent this if
you please. You must remain at home while she is with
us, entertain her while I am occupied, walk with her,
dance with her, be her beau. If she were a stranger,
hospitality alone would call for those attentions, and I
think, under the circumstances, your own good feeling
will teach you that she ought not to be neglected."
"My dear mother, do not say another word upon the
subject. It will be necessary for me to go from home

sometimes; but I can engage to spend a great portion of
the month as you desire. Send for a dancing-master
to-morrow morning. I am but an awkward fellow at
best, but I will do all that is in my power."
"You will breakfast with us, then, to-morrow morning,
and come on a laking-party? It was for the purpose of
making you promise I disturbed your rest at this hour;
for I knew there was no calculating in what part of
Munster one might find you after sunrise."
"How far do you go?"
"Only to Innisfallen."
"Ah! dear, dear Innisfallen I I will be with you,
certainly, mother. Ah, dear Innisfallen Mother, do
you think that Anne remembers the time when Lady
K invited us to take a cold dinner in St. Finian's
oratory? It is one of the sweetest days that ever
brightened my recollection. I think I can still see that
excellent lady laying her hand upon Anne Chute's
shoulder, and telling her that she should be the little
princess of this little fairy isle. Dear Innisfallen If I
were but to tell you, mother, how many a mournful hour
that single happy one has cost me !"
"Tell me of no such thing, my boy. Look forward,
and not back. Reserve the enjoyment of your recollec-
tions until you are no longer capable of present and
actual happiness. And do not think, Hardress, that
you make so extraordinary a sacrifice in undertaking
this pretty office. There is many a fine gentleman iri
Killarney who would gladly forego a whole season's spor:
for the privilege of acting such a part for a single day. I
cannot describe to you the sensation that your cousin
has produced since her arrival. Her beauty, her talents,
her elegance, and her accomplishments, are the subject
of conversation in every circle. You will acquire a greater
brilliance as the satellite of such a planet, than if you
were to move for ages in your own solitary orbit. But if
I were to say all that I desire, you would not sleep to-
night; so I shall reserve it to a moment of greater
leisure. Good-night, Hardress, and sleep soundly, for
the coxswain is to be at the door before nine."
## p. 179 (#183) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 179
Mrs. Cregan was well acquainted with the character of
her son. The distinction of attending on so celebrated a
beauty as his cousin, was one to which his vanity could
never be indifferent, and nothing could be more agreeable
to his pride than to find it thus forced upon him, without
any effort of his own to seek it. To be thus, out of pure
kindness, and much against his own declared wishes,
placed in a situation which was so generally envied to
obtain, likewise (and these were the only motives that
Hardress would acknowledge to his own mind), to obtain
an opportunity of softening his mother's prejudices against
the time of avowal, and of forwarding the interests of his
friend, Kyrle Daly, in another quarter; all these ad-
vantages were sufficient to compensate to his pride for
the chance of some mortifying awkwardness, which might
occur through his long neglect of, and contempt for, the
habitual forms of society.
And of all the places in the world, thought Hardress,
Killarney is the scene for such a debut as this. There is
such an everlasting fund of conversation. The very store
of commonplace remarks is inexhaustible. If it rains,
one can talk of the Killarney showers, and tell the story
of Mr. Fox; and if the sun shine, it must shine upon
more wonders than a hundred tongues, as nimble as
those of Fame herself could tell. The teasing of the
guides, the lies of the boatmen, the legends of the lakes,
the English arrivals, the echoes, the optical illusions, the
mists, the mountains. If I were as dull as Otter," I
could be as talkative as the barber in the Arabian nights
on such a subject, and yet without the necessity of
burthening my tongue with more than a sentence at
a time.
Notwithstanding these encouraging reflections, Har-
dress, next morning, experienced many a struggle with
his false shame before he left his chamber to encounter
his mother's charming visitor. What was peculiar in
the social timidity of this young gentleman lay in the
circumstance that it could scarcely ever be perceived in
Society. His excessive pride prevented his often incurring
*A character in Ben Jonson's Epicoene.
## p. 180 (#184) ############################################
18o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
the danger of a mortifying repression, and it could hardly
be inferred from his reserved, and at the same time
dignified demeanour, whether his silence were the effect
of ill-temper, stupidity, or bashfulness. Few, indeed, ever
thought of attributing it to that lofty philosophical
principle to which he himself pretended; and there was
but one in addition to Kyrle Daly, of all his acquaint-
ances, on whom it did not produce an unfavourable
impression.
After having been summoned half a dozen times to
the breakfast parlour, and delaying each time to indulge
in a fresh peep at the mirror to adjust his hair, which
had now too much and now too little powder; to alter
the disposition of his shirt-frill, and consummate the
tying of his cravat, Hardress descended to the parlour,
where, to his surprise, he found his cousin seated alone.
She was simply dressed; and her hair, according to the
fashion of unmarried ladies at the period, fell down in
black and shining ringlets on her neck. A plain neck-
lace of the famous black oak of the lakes, and a Maltese
cross, formed from the hoof of the red deer, constituted
the principal decorations of her person. There was a
consciousness, and even a distress, in the manner of
their meeting. A womanly reserve and delicacy made
Anne unwilling to affect an intimacy that might not be
met as she could desire; and his never-failing pride
prevented Hardress from seeming to desire a favour
that he had reason to suppose might not be granted
to him.
Accordingly, the great store of conversation which he
had been preparing the night before, now, to his astonish-
ment, utterly deserted him, and he discovered that
subject is an acquisition of little use, while it is unassisted
by mutual confidence and good-will among the inter-
locutors. Nothing was effective, nothing told; and when
Mrs. Cregan entered the parlour, she lifted her hands in
wonder, to see her fair visitor seated by the fire, and
reading some silly novel of the day (which happened to
lie near her), while Hardress affected to amuse himself
with Creagh's dog, Pincher, at the window, and said
~

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 181
repeatedly within his own heart, "Ah, Eily you are
worth this fine lady a hundred times over !"
"Annel Hardress My lady, and my gentleman
Upon my word, Hardress, you ought to be proud of your
gallantry. On the very first morning of your return, I
find you seated at the distance of half a room from your
old play-fellow, and allowing her to look for entertainment
in a stupid book 1 But, perhaps, you do not know each
other. Oh! then it is my duty to apologise for being
out of the way. Miss Chute, this is Mr. Hardress Cregan;
Mr. Hardress Cregan, this is Miss Chute." And she
went through a mock introduction in the formal manner
of the day.
The lady and gentleman each muttered something in
reply.
"We have spoken, ma'am," said Hardress. "We have
spoken, ma'am!" echoed Mrs. Cregan. "Sir, your most
obedient servant 1 You have made a wonderful effort, and
shown a great deal of condescension 1 You have spoken 1
You have done everything that a gentleman of so much
dignity and consequence was called upon to do, and you
will not move a single footstep farther. But, perhaps,"
she added, glancing at Anne, "perhaps I am dealing
unjustly here. Perhaps the will to hear, and not the will
to say, was wanted. If the fault lay with the listener,
Hardress, speak. It is the only defence that I will think
of admitting."
"Except that the listener might not be worth the
trial," said Anne, in the same tone of liveliness, not un-
mingled with pique, "I don't know how he can enter
such a plea as that."
"Oh Hardress I Oh, fie, Hardress | There's a charge
from a lady."
"I can assure you," said Hardress, a little confused,
yet not displeased with the manner in which his cousin
took up the subject, "I am not conscious of having
deserved any such accusation. If you call upon me for
a defence, I can only find it in a simple recrimination.
Anne has been so distant to me ever since my return
from Dublin, that I was afraid I had offended her."
## p. 182 (#186) ############################################
y 82 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Very fair, sir; a very reasonable plea, indeed. Well,
Miss Chute," continued Mrs. Cregan, turning round with
an air of mock gravity to her young visitor, "why have
you been so distant to my son since his return, as to
make him suppose he had offended you?" And she
stood with her hands expanded before her, in the attitude
of one who looks for an explanation.
"Offended me !" said Anne. "I must have been
exceedingly unreasonable, indeed, if I had quarrelled
with anything that was said or done by Hardress, for I
am sure he never once allowed me the opportunity."
"Oh Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Cregan, clasping her
hands, and bursting into a fit of laughter; "you grow
more severe. If I were a young gentleman, I should sink
down with shame after such an imputation as that."
Hardress found himself suddenly entrapped in a scene
of coquetry. "Might not one do better, mother," he
said, running lightly across the room, and taking a seat
close by the side of his cousin"Might not one do better
by endeavouring to amend?"
"But it is too late, sir," said Anne, affecting to move
away; "my aunt Cregan is right, and I am offended with
you. Don't sit so near if you please. The truth is, I
have made up my mind not to like you at all, and I never
will change it, you may be certain."
"That is too hard, Anne. We are old friends, you
should remember. What can I have done to make you
so inveterate P"
"That's right, Hardress," said Mrs. Cregan, who had
now taken her place at the breakfast-table ; "do not be
discouraged by her. Give her no peace until she is your
friend. But in the meantime come to breakfast. The
coxswain has been waiting this half hour."
The same scene of coquetry was continued during the
morning. Hardress, who was no less delighted than
surprised at this change of manner in his lovely cousin,
assumed the manner of a duteous knight, endeavouring
by the most assiduous attentions, to conciliate the favour
of his offended "ladye;" and Anne maintained with a
playful dignity the inexorable coldness and reserve which
## p. 183 (#187) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 183
was the prerogative of the sex in those days of chivalry
and sound sense. "We hate those," says Bruyere,
"who tremble with pride; but a smile is sufficient to
reconcile us."
In proportion to the chagrin which the fancied cold.
ness of his fair cousin had occasioned to the quick-
hearted Hardress, was the pleasure which he received
from this unexpected and intimate turn of manner. And
now it was, moreover, that he became capable of doing
justice to the real character of the young lady. No
longer embarrassed by the feeling of strangeness and
apprehension which had kept her spirits back on their
first meeting, Anne now assumed to him that ease and
liveliness of manner with which she was accustomed to
fascinate her more familiar acquaintances. He was
astonished, even to a degree of consternation, at the
extent both of her talents and her knowledge. On
general subjects, he found with extreme and almost
humiliating surprise, that her information very nearly
approached his own; and in a graceful and unostenta-
tious application of that knowledge to familiar subjects,
she possessed the customary female superiority.
We will not intrude so far upon the peculiar province
of the guide-books, as to furnish any detail of the
enchanting scenery through which our party travelled in
the course of the forenoon. Every new sight that he
beheld, every new hour that he spent in the society of
his cousin, assisted in disabusing his mind of the pre-
judice which he had conceived against her, and supplying
its place by a feeling of strong kindness. It happened
likewise, that in the course of the day, many circum-
stances occurred to render him well satisfied with the
company of his new associates. The disposition to
please and be pleased was general amongst them; and
Hardress was flattered by the degree of attention which
he received, not only from his own party, but from his
mother's fashionable acquaintances to whom he was
introduced in passing. -
Life, spirit, courtliness of manner, and kindness of
feeling, governed the tone of conversation throughout the

184 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
day; and Hardress bore his part in quality of host with
a degree of success and effect, that was a matter of
astonishment to himself. One or two of the younger
ladies only were heard to say, that Mr. Cregan was a
little inattentive, and that he seemed to imagine there
was not another lady of the party besides Miss Chute;
but it is suspected that even those pretty murmurers
were by no means the least sensible of the merit of the
person whom they censured. When the evening drew
near, and the party left the island for home, Hardress
was once more surprised to find, that although he had
been speaking for nearly half the day, he had not once
found it necessary to make allusion to the Killarney
showers, the optical deceptions, or the story of Charles
James Fox.
When he parted from the merry circle, in order to
fulfil his promise to Eily, a feeling of blank regret fell
suddenly upon his heart, like that which is experienced
by a boy when the curtain falls at the close of the first
theatrical spectacle which he has ever witnessed. His
mother, who knew him too well to press any inquiry into
the nature of his present engagement, had found no
great difficulty in making him promise to return on the
next day, in order to be present at a ball, which she was
about to give at the cottage. The regret which Anne
manifested at his departure (to her an unexpected move-
ment), and the cordial pleasure with which she heard of
his intention to return on the next morning, inspired him
with a feeling of happiness which he had not hitherto
experienced since his childhood.
The next time he thought of Anne and Eily at the
same moment, the conjunction was not so unfavourable
to the former as it had been in the morning. "There
is no estimating the advantage," he said within his own
mind, "which the society of so accomplished a girl as
that must produce on the minds and habits of my dear
little Eily. I wish they were already friends. My poor
little love 1 how much she has to learn before she cars
assume with comfort to herself the place for which I have
designed her. But women are imitative creatures.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 185
They can more readily adapt themselves to the tone of
any new society than we, who boast a firmer and less
ductile nature; and Eily will find an additional facility
in the good nature and active kindness of Anne Chute.
I wish from my heart they were already friends."
As he finished this reflection, he turned his pony off
the Gap-road, upon the crags which led to the cottage of
Phil Naughton.
CHAPTER XX.
HOW HARDRESS HAD A STRANGE DREAM OF EILY.
THE burst of rapture and affection with which he was
wreceived by Eily, banished for the moment every other
feeling from the mind of the young husband. Her eyes
sparkled and her countenance brightened at his entrance,
with the innocent delight of a child. Her colour changed,
and her whole frame was agitated by a passion of joy,
which Hardress could scarcely have anticipated if his
absence had been prolonged to a much more consider-
able time. He could not avoid feeling, that Eily was as
far beyond his cousin in gentleness of feeling, in ready
confidence, and winning simplicity of manner, as she was
excelled by the latter in dignity of mind and of de-
meanour, in elegant knowledge, and in correctness of
Xtaste.
They stood at the open door, Rily being yet encircled
by the arm of her husband, and gazing on his face, while
the expression of rapture that had illumined the counte-
nance of both faded gradually away into a look of calm
and settled joy. On a sudden, their ears were startled
by a hoarse, husky, and yet piercing voice, which seemed
to proceed from a crag that sheltered the cottage on the
left side. Looking upward, Hardress beheld a woman
standing on the turf, whose gesture and appearance

186 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
showed her to be one of a race of viragos who are now
less numerous in the country parts of Ireland than they
were some twenty years since.
Her face and hair announced a Spanish origin; her
dress consisted of a brown stuff garment, fastened up the
back with a row of brass buttons, and a muslin cap and
ribbon, considerably injured by the effect of long posses-
sion. An old drab ock, soiled and stained by many a
roll in the puddle of the mountain fairs, was superadded,
and in her right hand she grasped a short heavy oak
stick, which, if one might judge by the constant use she
made of it in enforcing her gestures, was as necessary
to her discourse as the famous thread of Lord Chester-
field's orator. Her eyes were bloodshot from watching
and intemperance; and the same causes, joined to a
habitual violence of temper, had given to her thin, red,
and streaky countenance, a sudden and formidable turn
of expression.
"Ha! hal my children my two fine, clever children,
are ye there? Oh, the luck o' me, that it wasn't a lad
like you I married; a clever boy, with the red blood
running under his yellow skin, like that sun over behind
the clouds, instead of the mane, withered disciple that
calls my house his home this day. Look at the beauty
of him I Look at the beauty of him 1 I might have
been a lady if I liked. Oh, the luck o' me! the luck o"
me! Five tall young men, every one of 'em a patthern
for a faction, and all, all dead in their graves, down,
down; an' no one left but that picthur o' misery, that
calls himself my husband. If it wasn't for the whisky,"
she added, while she came down the crags, and stood
before the pair, "my heart would break with the thoughts.
of it. Five tall young men, brothers every one, an' they
to die, an' he to live I Wouldn't it kill the Danes to
think of it! Five tall young men! Gi' me the price o"
the whisky."
"Indeed I will not, Poll. You have had enough
already."
"No, nor half l' shouted the amazon. "A dhram is
enough, but two dhrams isn't half enough, an' I had only

two. Coax him, ma chree, ma lanuv, to gi' me the
price o' the whisky."
Eily, who stood in great terror of this virago, turned a
supplicating glance on Hardress.
"Your young mistress," said the latter, "would not
become a participator in the sin of your drunkenness."
"My misthress The rope-maker's daughter My
mistress 1 Eily-na-thiadarucha! Welcome from Gallow's
Green, my misthress | The poor silly crathur ! Is it
because I call you, with the blood of all your fathers in
your veins, a gentleman, my masther, that I'd call her a
lady, and my misthress P Gi' me the price o' the
whisky."
"I shall not, Poll. Go back."
"Gi'me the price o' the whisky, or I'll tear the crooked
eyes out o' your yellow face! Gi' me it, I tell you, or I'll
give my misthress more kicks than ha'pence, the next
time I catch her alone in the house, and you away
coortin' and divartin' at Killarney."
"Cool yourself, Poll, or I'll make you cool."
"You a gentleman There isn't a noggin o' genteel
blood in the veins o' your whole seed, breed, an' genera-
tion. You have a heart! you stingy, bone-polishing,
tawny-faced, beggarly, mane-spirited mohawk, that hadn't
the spirit to choose between poverty an' dignity 1 You a
gentleman The highest and the finest in the land was
open to you, an' you hadn't the courage to stand up to
your fortune. You a heart 1 Except a lady was to come
an' coort you of herself, sorrow chance she'd ever have o'
you or you of her. An' signs on, see what a misthress
you brought over us! I wondher you had the courage to

down. I often seen a worm turn to a butterfly, but I
never heard of a butterfly turning to a worm in my life
before. You a heart 1 I'll lay a noggin, if the docthors
open you when ye die, they won't find such a thing as a
heart in your whole yellow carcase, only a cowld gizzard

Hardress turned pale with anger at this coarse but
bitter satire. "Do stop her mouth, my dear Hardress,"
## p. 188 (#192) ############################################
188 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
murmured Eily, whose total want of pride rendered her
almost incapable of resentment. "Do silence her. That
woman makes me afraid for my very life."
"Never entertain the least apprehension on that sub-
ject, Eily. There is one key to the good will of Fighting
Poll, by which you may be always certain of keeping your
place in her affections. It is whisky. Keep her in
whisky, and you keep her faithful. Nor need you ever
fear to be out-purchased; for Poll has just good principle
enough to prefer a little whisky with honesty, to a great
deal obtained as the wages of treason. Well, Poll," he
continued, turning to that amazon, "you are too many
for me. Here is half a-crown to drink my health, and be
a good girl."
"Half-a-crown l' shouted the woman, catching the
glittering coin as Hardress sent it twirling through the air.
"I knew you were your father's son for all ! I knew 'tis
o' purpose you were. I knew you had the nature in you,
after all ! Ha! here comes Phil and Danny at last.
Come, sthrip, now, Phill Sthrip off the coat at once, an'
let us see if M'Donough laid the horsewhip over your
shoulders to-day."
The man only returned her a surly glance in answer to
this speech.
"What M'Donough is this, Phil?" said Hardress;
"what horse-whipping do you speak of, Poll P"
"I'll tell you, sir?" returned Phil. "He is our land-
lord, and the owner of all the land about you, as far as
you can see, an'farther. He lives about a mile away from
us, an' is noted for being a good landlord to all, far an'
near. Only there's one fashion he has, and that's a
throublesome one to some of his people. As he gives
all manner of lases at a raisonable rent himself, he wishes
that his land should be sub-let raisonable also, which
makes him very conthrairy whenever there does be any
complaints of hard usage from the under-tenants. I'll
tell you his plan when he finds anything o' the sort afther

comes in, as it might be to my cabin there (if he had
anything again me), an' without ever saying one word, he
walks into the middle o' the floore, an'lays the whip-

heroine into the cottage, muttering, in a low voice, a
popular distich 
"Joy be with you, if you never come back,
Dead or alive, or o' horseback."
In the course of this evening, Eily remarked that her
husband, though affectionate as she could desire, was
more silent and abstracted than she had ever seen him,
and that he more frequently spoke in correction of some
little breach of etiquette, or inelegance of manner, than in
those terms of eloquent praise and fondness which he was
accustomed to lavish upon her. One advantage, however,
of Eily's want of penetration was, that the demon of
suspicion never disturbed the quiet of her soul; and it
required the utmost and the most convincing evidence of
falsehood, to shake the generous and illimitable confidence
which she reposed in any person who was once estab-
lished in her affections.
While she felt, therefore, some little pain on her
husband's account, she never experienced the slightest
trouble on her own. She endeavoured with cheerfulness
to adapt herself to his wishes, and though in this she
could not become immediately successful, he would have
owned a rigid temper, indeed, if it had not been softened
by the submissive sweetness of her demeanour.
And Hardress was softened, though not satisfied by her
gentle efforts. He observed on this evening a much more
considerable number of those unpleasing blemishes than
he had on any other, and the memory of them pursued
him even into his midnight slumbers, where fancy, as
usual, augmented their effects upon his mind. He
dreamed that the hour had come in which he was to
introduce his bride to his rich and fashionable acquaint-
ances, and that a large company had assembled at his
mother's cottage to honour the occasion.
Nothing, however, could exceed the bashfulness, the
awkwardness, and the homeliness of speech and accent
with which the rope-maker's daughter received their com-
pliments; and to complete the climax of his chagrin, on
happening to look round upon her during dinner, he saw

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 191
her in the act of peeling a potato with her fingers I This
phantom haunted him for half the night. He dreamed,
moreover, that when he reasoned with her on this subject,
she answered him with a degree of pert vulgarity and
impatience which was in "discordant harmony" with her
shyness before strangers, and which made him angry at
heart and miserable in mind.
The dreams of passion are always vivid, distinct, and
deeply impressive. The feeling of anger and annoyance
remained on the mind of Hardress even after he awoke;
and, although he never failed to correct and dispel the
sensation, whenever it arose, yet throughout the whole
of the following morning, a strong and disagreeable
association was awakened whenever he looked upon
Eily.
Before he again left her, Hardress explained the nature
of his present position with respect to his mother, and
informed his wife of the necessity which existed for
spending a considerable portion of the month which was
to come, at his father's cottage. Eily heard this an-
nouncement with pain and grief, but without remon-
strance. She cried like a child at parting with him; and
after he had ridden away, remained leaning against the
jamb of the door with her moistened handkerchief placed
against her cheek in an attitude of musing sorrow. He
had promised to return on the second day after, but how
was she to live over the long, long interval P A lone-
someness of heart that was in mournful accordance with
the mighty solitudes in which she dwelt, fell down and
abode upon her spirit.
On that night, Hardress was one of the gayest revellers
at his mother's ball. Anne Chute, who was, beyond all
competition, the star of the evening, favoured him with
a marked and cordial distinction. The flattering defer-
ence with which he was received by all with whom he
entered into conversation during the night, surprised him
into ease and fluency; and the success of his own
eloquence made him in love with his auditory. When
it is considered that this was the very first ball he had
ever witnessed since his boyhood, and that his life, in the
## p. 192 (#196) ############################################
192 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
interim, had been the life of a recluse, its effect upon his
mind will cease to be a matter of surprise. The richness
of the dressesthe liveliness of the musicthe beauty
of the fair dancersthe gaiety of their young partners
the air of elegant mirth that filled the whole apartment
produced a new and delicious sensation of happiness in
the susceptible temper of Hardress.
Our feelings are so much under the government of our
habits, that a modern English family, in the same rank,
might have denied the praise of comfort to that which, in
the unaccustomed eyes of Hardress, wore the warmer hue
of luxury; for he lived at a time when Irish gentlemen
fostered a more substantial pride than at present, when
appearances were comparatively but little consulted, and
the master of a mansion cared not how rude was the
interior, or how ruinous the exterior of his dwelling, pro-
vided he could always maintain a loaded larder and a
noisy board.
The scene around him was not less enervating to the
mind of our hero because the chairs which the company
used were of plain oak, and the light from the large glass
lustre fell upon the coarse unpapered walls, whose only
ornament consisted of the cross-barred lines drawn with
the trowel in the rough grey mortar. Many of those who
are accustomed to scenes of elegant dissipation might
not readily give credence to the effect which was wrought
upon his feelings by circumstances of comparatively little
import.
The perfumed air of the room, the loftiness of the
ceiling, the festooning of the drapery above the windows,
the occasional pauses and changes in the music, all con-
tributed to raise his mind into a condition of peculiar and
exquisite enthusiasm, which made it susceptible of deep,
dangerous, and indelible impressions. The wisdom of
religion, in prescribing a strict and constant government
of the senses, could not be more apparent than on an
occasion like this, when their influence upon the reason
became almost as potent and absorbing as that of an
internal passion.
In the midst of this gaiety of heart and topping ful-

ness of mind, a circumstance occurred to throw it into a
more disturbed and serious, but scarcely less delightful
condition. The intervals in the dancing were filled up
by songs from the company, and Anne Chute, in her
turn, was called on for her contribution of melody.
Hardress was leaning over her chair, and looking at the
music-book, which she was turning over leaf after leaf,
as if in search of some suitable piece for the occasion.
"Ah, this will do, I think," said Anne, pausing at a
manuscript song, which was adapted to an old air, and
running a rapid prelude along the keys of the instrument.
The letters H. C. were written at the top of the page, and
Hardress felt a glow like fire upon his brow the instant he
beheld them. He drew back a little out of the light,
and listened with an almost painful emotion to the song
which the fair performer executed with an ease and feel-
ing that gave to the words an effect beyond that to which
they might themselves have pretended. They were the
following:
I.
A place in thy memory, dearest,
Is all that I claim;
To pause and look back when thou hearest
The sound of my name.
Another may woo thee, nearer,
Another may win and wear;
I care not though he be dearer,
If I am remembered there.
II.
Remember menot as a lover
Whose hope was cross'd,
Whose bosom can never recover
The light it has lost
As the young bride remembers the mother
She loves, though she never may see-
As a sister remembers a brother,
Oh, dearest remember me.
III.
Could I be thy true lover, dearest,
Couldst thou smile on me,
I would be the fondest and nearest
That ever lowed thee I

I94 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
But a cloud on my pathway is glooming,
That never must burst upon thine,
And Heaven, that made thee all blooming,
Ne'er made thee to wither on mine.
IV.
Remember me, then!O! remember,
My calm, light love;
Though bleak as the blasts of November
My life may prove.
That life will, though lonely, be sweet,
If its brightest enjoyment should be
A smile and kind word when we meet,
And a place in thy memory.

CHAPTER XXI.
HOW HARDRESS MET A STRANGE TRIAL.
"MOTHER, can you tell me why Anne Chute appears so
abstracted and so reserved in her manner these few days
past? Is she ill? Is she out of spirits? Is she annoyed
at anything?"
Hardress Cregan, who spoke this speech, was resting
with his arm on the sash of one of the cottage windows.
Mrs. Cregan was standing at a table in the centre of the
room, arranging several small packages of plate, glass, and
china, which had been borrowed from various neighbours
on occasion of the ball. At a little distance stood old
Nancy in her blue cloak and hood, awaiting the com-
mands of her mistress, who, as she proceeded with her
occupation, glanced, at intervals, a sharp and inquiring
eye at her son.
"Here, Nancy, take this china to Mrs. Geogheghan,
with my compliments, and tell her that I'm very much
obliged to her; and, for your life, you horrible old crea
ture, take care and not break them."
"Oyeh, murther! is it I? Fake 'em sure that I won't,
so."
## p. 195 (#199) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 195
"And tell Mike, as you are going down stairs, to come
hither. I want to send him with those spoons to Miss
Macarthy."
"Mike isn't come back yet, ma'am, since he wint over
with the three-branch candlestick to Mrs. Crasbie."
"He is a very long time away, then."
"Can you tell me, mother," said Hardress, after in vain
expecting an answer to his former queries"can you tell
me, mother, if Anne Chute has had any unpleasing news
from home, lately?"
"Well, Nancy," continued Mrs. Cregan, appearing not
to have heard her son, "run away with your parcel, and
deliver your message as you have been told, and hurry
back again, for I have three more places to send you to
before dinner."
"Allilul my ould bones will be fairly wore from undher
me with the dint of thrallivantin," muttered Nancy, as she
left the room.
"I beg your pardon, Hardress, my dearwere you not
speaking? My attention is so occupied by these affairs,
that I have not a head for anything besides. This is one
of the annoyances produced by your father's improvi-
dence. He will not purchase those things, and I am
obliged to borrow them, and to invite their owners into
the bargain. I should not mind the borrowing but for
that, as they are, generally speaking, very inferior in
quality to the article they lend me. In my thoughts the
latter always occupy so much more important a place
than their possessors, that in sending a note of invitation
to Mrs. Crosbie (or Crasbie, as Nancy calls her), the
other day, I was on the point of writing 'Mrs. Cregan
presents her compliments to the three-branched candle-
stick." But were you not speaking to me?"
"I merely asked you, mother, if you knew the cause
of the change which has lately appeared in Anne Chute's
manner, and which I have observed more especially
since the night of the ball."
"I do," said Mrs. Cregan.
Hardress turned his face round, and looked as if he
expected to hear more.
## p. 196 (#200) ############################################
196 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"But before I inform you," continued Mrs. Cregan,
"you must answer me one question. What do you think
of Anne Chute?"
"Think of her, mother?"
"Think of her, mother You echo me, like Iago in
the play. I hope it is not that you have got any such
monster in your thoughts as may not meet the light."
Hardress shook his head with a smile of deep mean-
ing. "Indeed, mother," he said, "it is far otherwise. I
am ashamed to trust my lips with my opinion of Anne
Chute. She is, in truth, a fascinating girl. If I were to
tell you, in the simplest language, all that I think and all
that I feel in her favour, you would say that you had
found out a mad son in Hardress. She is, indeed, an
incomparable young woman."
"A girl," said his mother, who heard this speech with
evident satisfaction"a girl who is far too amiable to
become the victim of disappointed feelings."
"Of disappointed feelings 1"
"Another echo | Why you seem to have caught the
mocking spirit from the lakes. I tell you she is within
the danger of such an event."
"How is that, mother?"
"Close the door, and I will tell you. I see you have
remarked the increasing alteration in her manner. If I
should entrust you with a lady's secret, do you think you
know how to venerate it?"
"Why so, mother?"
"Ah, that's a safe answer. Well, I think I may trust
you without requiring a pledge. Anne Chute has met
with the usual fate of young ladies at her age; she is deep
in love."
Hardress felt the hot blood gather upon his breath
when he heard these words. "You are jesting, mother,"
be said at length, and with a forced smile.
"It is a sad jest for poor Anne, however," said Mrs.
Cregan, with much seriousness. "She is completely
caught, indeed. I never saw a girl so much in love in
my life."
"He is a happy fellow," said Hardress, after a paust,
## p. 197 (#201) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 197
and in a deep voice; "he is either a very stupid or a very
happy fellow whom Anne Chute distinguishes with her
regard. And happy he must be, for a stupid lover could
never press so wearily upon the remembrance of such a
girl. He is a very happy fellow."
"And yet, to look at him, you would suppose he was
neither the one nor the other," said his mother.
"What is his name?"
"Can you not guess?"
The name of Kyrle Daly rose to the lips of Hardress,
but from some undefinable cause he was unable to pro-
nounce it. "Guess?" he repeated; "not I. Captain
Gibson?"
"Pooh! what an opinion you have formed of Anne, if
you suppose her to be one of those susceptible Misses to
whom the proximity of a red coat, in country quarters, is
an affair of fatal consequence."
"Kyrle Daly, then?"
"Poor Kyrleno. But that I think she has already
chosen better, I could wish it were he, poor fellow! But
you do not seem inclined to pay your cousin a compli-
ment this morning. Do you not think you guess a little
below her worth P"
"Not in Kyrle Daly. He is a lover for a queen; he is
my true friend."
"That," said his mother with emphasis, "might be
tome recommendation."
Hardress gazed at her, as if altogether at a loss.
"Well, have you already come to a stand?" said Mrs.
Cregan. "Then I believe I shall not insist on you
exposing your own dulness any longer. Come hither,
Hardress, and sit near me."
The young gentleman took a chair at his mother's
side, and awaited her further speech with increasing
1nterest.
"Hardress," she said, "I have a claim, independent of
my natural right, to your obedience, and I must insist, in
this one instance at least, on its not being contested.
Listen to me. I have now an object in view, to the
accomplishment of which I look forward with a pas-

sionate interest, for it has no other aim than the com-
pletion of your happinessa concern, my beloved boy,
which has always sat closest to my heart, even from your
childhood. I have no child but you. My other little
babes are with their Maker. I have none left but you,
and I think I feel my heart yearn towards you with all
the love which, if those angels had not flown from me,
would have been divided amongst them."
She paused, affected, and Hardress lowered his face
in deep and grateful emotion.
"It is, I think, but reasonable, therefore," Mrs. Cregan
continued, "to desire your concurrence in a project which
has your own happiness only for its object. Are you
really so dull of perception as not to be aware of the
impression you have made on the affections of Anne
Chute?"
"That Z-Z have made?" exclaimed Hardress, with a
confusion and even a wildness in his manner, which
looked like a compound of joy and terror. "That I
did you say, mother?"
"That you have made," repeated his mother. "It is
true, indeed, Hardress. She loves you. This fascinating
girl loves you long and deeply. This incomparable
young woman, with whose praises you dare not trust your
tongue, is pining for your love in the silence of her
chamber. This beautiful and gifted creature, who is the
wonder of all who see and the love of all who know her,
is ready to pour forth her spirit at your feet in a murmur
of expiring fondness. Use your fortunes. The world
smiles brightly on you. I say again, Anne Chute is long,
deeply, and devotedly your own."
Hardress drank in every accent of this poisonous speeeh
with that fatal relish which is felt by the infatuated
Eastern for his draught of stilling tincture. While he lay
back in his chair, however, to enjoy the full and swelling
rapture of his triumph, a horrid remembrance suddenly
darted through his brain, and made him start from his
chair as if he had received a blow.
"Mother," said he, "you are deceived in this. It is
not, it cannot be, the fact. I see the object of which you
## p. 199 (#203) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 199
speak, and I am sure your own anxiety for its accomplish-
ment has led you to miscalculate. My own surmises are
not in unison with yours."
"My dear child," replied his mother, "I have a far
better authority than surmise for what I say. Do you
think, my love, that I would run the hazard of disturbing
your peace, without an absolute assurance of the truth
of my statement P I have an authority that ought to
satisfy the most distrustful lover; and I will be guilty of
a breach of confidence, in order to set your mind at rest,
for I am certain of your honour. It is the confession,
the reluctant, and hardly-won confession, of my darling
Anne herself."
Again a revulsion of frightful rapture rushed through
the frame of the listener, and made him resume his chair
in silence.
"When we came here first," continued Mrs. Cregan,
"I could perceive that there was a secret, although I was
far from suspecting its nature. The first glimpse of light
that broke upon the mystery was produced by accident.
You remember poor Dalton, our old huntsman? I hap-
pened to speak to Anne of his attachment to you, and
could at once observe that her interest for the man was
ardently awakened."
"I remember, I remember like a dream," said Hardress,
raising his finger in the manner of one endeavouring to
strengthen an indistinct recollection. "Poor Dalton told
me Anne had been kind to him. Anne. No, no," he
added, with much confusion, "he named no one. He
said a person in this house had been kind to him. I was
prevented from inquiring farther."
"That person," said Mrs. Cregan, "was Anne Chute.
From the moment of that conversation my eyes were
opened, and I felt like one who has suddenly discovered
the principle of an intricate and complicated system. I
saw it in her silence while your arrival was delayedI
saw it on the morning of your meetingI saw it through-
out that dayI saw it in her dissembled grief, in her dis
sembled joy. Poor dear girl | I saw it in the almost
childlike happiness that sparkled in her eyes when you

came near us, and in the sudden gloom that followed your
departure. For shame, my child! Why are you so dull
of perception? Have you eyes? Have you ears? Have
you a brain to comprehend, or a heart to estimate your
good fortune? It should have been your past, not mine,
to draw that dear acknowledgment from the lips of Anne
last night."
To this observation, Hardress replied only by a low
moan, which had in it an expression of deep pain.
"How, mother," he at length asked in a hoarse tone, "by
what management did you draw this secret from her?"
"By a simple process. By making it worth her while
to give me her confidence. By telling her what I have
long since perceived, though it may possibly have escaped
your own observation, that her passion was not unre-
quitedthat you were as deeply in love with her, as she
with you."
"Me! me in love 1 You could not, you would not,
surely, mother, speak with so much rashness," exclaimed
Hardress, in evident alarm.
"Why? do you not love her, then?"
"Love her, mother P"
"I see you have not yet done with the echoes."
"I love her as a cousin should love a cousinnothing
more."
"Ay; but she is no cousin of yours. Come 1 it must
be either more or less. What shall I say?"
"Neither. It is in that light I have always looked
upon Anne. I could not love her less. I would not,
dare not, love her more."
"Dare not! You have got a strange vocabulary for a
lover. What do you mean by "dare not'? What mighty
daring is requisite to enable a young man to fall in love
with a young lady, of whose affection he is already certain?
The daring that is necessary for wedlock is an old
bachelor's sneer, which should never be heard on lips
that are ruddy with the blood of less than forty summers.
Why dare you not love Anne Chute?"
"Because, by doing so, I should break my faith to
another."
## p. 201 (#205) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 20x
Mrs. Cregan fixed her eyes on him, as if somewhat
stunned. "What do you say, Hardress?" she murmured,
just above her breath.
"I say, mother, that my heart and faith are both
already pledged to another, and that I must not break my
engagement."
"Do you speak seriously?"
"I could not jest on this subject, if I were so inclined."
"And dare you tell me this?" Mrs. Cregan exclaimed,
starting up from her seat, with a sudden fierceness of
manner. "You have no daring ! You dare not love
the love that I have chosen for you, and you dare tell
me to my face of such a boldness as this But dare me
not too far, I warn you, Hardress. You will not find it
Safe."
"I dare tell the truth when I am called on," replied
Hardress, who never respected his mother so little as in
her moments of passion and authority, "in all places, and
at all hazards, even including that of incurring my
mother's displeasure."
"Listen to me, Hardress," said his mother, returning
to her seat, and endeavouring to suppress her anger
"it is better we should fully understand each other."
"It is, mother; and I cannot choose a better time to be
explicit than the present. I was wrong, very wrong, in
not taking an earlier opportunity of explaining to you the
circumstances in which I stand. But it is better even
now than later. Mother," he continued, moving near to
her, and taking her hand between his, with a deprecating
tenderness of manner, "forgive your own Hardress I
have already fixed my affections, and pledged myself to
another."
Mrs. Cregan pressed her handkerchief against her face,
and leaned forward on the table, which position she main-
tained during the dialogue which followed.
"And who is that other?" she asked with a calmness
that astonished her son. "Is she superior to Anne
Chute in rank or fortune?"
"Far otherwise, mother."
"In talent, then, or manner?"
## p. 202 (#206) ############################################
2O2 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Still far beneath my cousin."
"In what, then, consists the motive of preference, for
I am at a loss?"
"In everything that relates to acquirement," said
Hardress, "she is not even to be compared to Anne.
Chute. It is in virtue alone, and in gentleness of
disposition, that she can pretend to an equality. I once
believed her lovelier, but I was prejudiced."
Mrs. Cregan now raised her head, and showed, by the
change in her appearance, what passionate struggles she
had been endeavouring to overcome. The veins had
started out upon her forehead, a dull fire shone in her
eyes, and one dark tress of hair, uncurled by dampness
and agitation, was swept across her temples. "Poor,
low-born, silly, and vulgar !" she repeated, with an air of
perplexity and suppressed anger. Then, assuming an
attitude of easy dignity, and forcing a smile, she said:
"Oh, my dear Hardress, you must be jesting, for I am
sure you could not make such a choice as you describe."
"If it is a misfortune," replied Hardress, "I must only
summon up all my philosophy, mother, for there is no.
escaping it."
Mrs. Cregan again pressed her hand upon her brow
for some moments, and then said: "Well, Hardress, let
us conduct this discussion calmly. I have got a violent
shooting in my head, and cannot say so much as I desire.
But listen to me as I have done to you. My honour is
pledged to your cousin for the truth of what I have told
her. I have made her certain that her wishes shall be
accomplished, and I will not have my child's heart
broken. If you are serious, Hardress, you have acted a
most dishonourable part. Your conduct to Anne Chute
would have deceivedit has deceivedthe most un-
biassed amongst your acquaintances. You have paid her
attentions which no honourable man could offer, while
he entertained only a feeling of indifference towards.
their object.
"Mother l mother how can you make such a charge.
as that? Was it not entirely, and reluctantly, in compli-
ance with your own injunctions that I did so?"
## p. 203 (#207) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 203.
"Ay," replied Mrs. Cregan, a little struck, "but I was
not then aware of your position. Why did you not then
inform me of all this? Let the consequences, sir, of
your duplicity fall on your own head, not on my poor
girl's nor mine. I could not have believed you capable
of such a meanness. Had you then discovered all, it
would have been in time for the safety of your cousin's
happiness and for my own honourfor that, too, is staked
in the issue. What, sir! Is your vanity so egregious
that, for its gratification merely, you would interfere with
a young girl's prospects in life, by filling up the place at
her side to which others, equal in merit and more sincere
in their intentions, might have aspired? Is not that con-
sideration alone (putting aside the keener disappointment
to which you have subjected her) enough to make your
conduct appear hideous?"
The truth and justice of this speech left Hardress
without a word.
"You are already contracted at every fireside in Kerry
and Limerick also," continued his mother; "and I am.
determined that there shall be no whispering about my
own sweet Anne. You must perform the promise that
your conduct has given."
"And my engagement?"
"Break it off!" exclaimed Mrs. Cregan, with a burst of
anger, scarcely modified by her feeling of decorum. "If
you have been base enough to make a double pledge, and
if there must be a victim, I am resolved it shall not be
Anne Chute. I must not have to reproach myself with
having bound her for the sacrifice. Now take your
choice, I tell you, I had rather dienay, I had rather see
you in your coffin, than matched below your rank. You
are yet unable to cater for your own happiness, and you
would assuredly lay up a fund of misery for all your
coming years. Now take your choice. If you wed as I
desire, you shall have all the happiness that rank, and
wealth, and honour, and domestic affection can Secure
you. If against my wishif you resist me, enjoy your
vulgar taste, and add to it all the wretchedness that
extreme poverty can furnish; for, whether I live or die

(as, indeed, I shall be careless on that subject hencefor-
ward), you never shall possess a guinea of your inherit-
ance. So take your choice."
"It is already made," said Hardress, rising with a
mournful dignity, and moving towards the door. "My
fortunes are already decided, whatever way my inclina-
tions move. Farewell, then, mother. I am grateful to
you for all your former kindness, but it is impossible that
I can please you in this. As to the poverty with which
you intend to punish me, I can face that consequence
without much anxiety, after I have ventured to incur the
hazard of your anger."
He was already at the door, when his mother recalled
him with a softened voice. "Hardress" she said, with
tears in her eyes, "I mistake my heart entirely. It can-
not afford to lose a son so easily. Come hither, and sit
by me, my own beloved boy. You know not, Hardress,
how I have loved and love you. Why will you anger
me, my child? I never angered you, even when you were
an infant at my bosom. I never denied you anything, in
all my life. I never gave you a hard word or look, since
you were a child in my arms. What have I done to you
Hardress? Even supposing that I have acted with any
rashness in this, why will you insist on my suffering
for it?"
"My dear mother" -
"If you knew how I have loved you, Hardress; but
you can never know it, for it was shown most frequently
and fondly when you were incapable of acknowledging
or appreciating it. If you knew how disinterestedly I
have watched and laboured for your happiness, even
from your boyhood, you would not so calmly resign your
mind to the idea of such a separation. Come, Hardress,
we must yet be friends. I do not press you for an im-
mediate answer; but tell me you will think of it, and
think more kindly. Bid me but smile on Anne when I
meet her next. Nay, don't look troubled; I shall not
speak to her until I have your answer; I will only smile
upon her. That's my darling Hardress."
"But, mother"
## p. 205 (#209) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 205.
"Not one word more. At least, Hardress, my wishes
are worth a little consideration. Look there !" she sud-
denly exclaimed, laying her hand on the arm of her son,
and pointing through the open window; "is that not
worth a little consideration?"
Hardress looked in that direction, and heheld a sight
which might have proved dangerous to the resolution of
a more self-regulated spirit. It was the figure of his
cousin standing under the shade of a lofty arbutus (a tree
which acknowledges Killarney alone, of all our northern
possessions, for its natal region). A few streaks of the
golden Sunshine streamed in upon her figure through
the boughs, and quivered over the involutions of her
drapery.
She was without a bonnet, and her short black ringlets,
blown loose about her rather pale and careful counten-
ance, gave it somewhat of the character of an Ariadne or
Penthesilea. She walked towards the house, and every
motion of her frame seemed instinct with a natural
intelligence. Hardress could not (without a nobler effort.
than he would use) remove his eyes from this beautiful
vision, until a turn in the gravel-walk concealed it from
his view, and it disappeared among the foliage, as a
lustrous star is lost in a mass of autumnal clouds.
"Mother," said Hardress, "I will think on what you
have said. May Heaven defend and guide me! I am a.
miserable wretch, but I will think of it. Oh, mother, my
dear mother, if I had confided in you, or you in me !
Why have we been thus secret to each other? But.
pardon me ! It is I alone that am deserving of that.
reproach, for you were contriving for my happiness only.
Happiness | What a vain word that is 1 I never shall,
be happy more. Never, indeed I I have destroyed my
fortunes."
"Hush, boy, I hear Anne's foot upon the lobby. I.
told her you would walk with her to-day."
"Me walk with her l'" said Hardress, with a shudder,
"No, no, I cannot, mother; it would be wrongI dare
not, indeed."
"Dare not, again," said Mrs. Cregan, Smiling. "Come,.

come, forget this conversation for the present, and con-
sider it again at your leisure." -
"I will think of it," repeated the young man, with
some wildness of manner. "May Heaven defend and
guide me ! I am a wretch already."
"Hush! hush!" said his mother, who did not attach
too much importance to these exclamations of mental
distress; "you must not let your mistress hear you
praying in that way, or she will suppose she has frightened
you."
"My mistress, mother 1"
"Pooh, pooh your cousin, then. Don't look so
terrified. Well, Hardress, I am obliged to you."
"Ay, mother, but don't be misled by xx
"Oh, be in no pain for that. I understand you per-
fectly. Remain here, and I will send your cousin to you
in a few minutes."
It would have at once put an end to all discussion on
this subject, if Hardress had informed his mother that he
was in fact already married. He was aware of this, and
yet he could not tell her that it was so. It was not that
he feared her anger, for that he had already dared. He
knew that he was called on in honour, in justice, and in
conscience, to make his parent aware of the full extent of
his position, and yet he shunned the avowal as he would
have done a sentence of despair.

CHAPTER XXII.
HOW THE TEMPTATION OF HARDRESS PROCEEDED.
DURING the few weeks that followed the conversation
just detailed, Eily perceived a rapid and fearful change
in the temper and appearance of her husband. His
visits were fewer and shorter than before, and when he
did come, his manner was restrained and cautious in an
-extraordinary degree. His eye looked troubled, his voice
## p. 207 (#211) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 2O7
was deep and broken, his cheek grew pale and fleshless,
and a gloomy air, which might be supposed the mingled
result of discontent and dissipation, appeared in all his
person.
He no longer conversed with that noisy frankness and
gaiety in which he was accustomed to indulge in all
societies where he felt perfectly at ease. To Eily he
spoke sometimes with coldness and impatience, and very
often with a wild affection that had in it as much of
grief as of tenderness. To the other inmates of the
cottage he was altogether reserved and haughty, and
even his own boatman seldom cared to tempt him into a
conversation. Sometimes Eily was inclined to think that
he had escaped from some unpleasing scenes at home,
his demeanour during the evening was so abstracted and
so full of care. On other occasions, when he came to
her cottage late at night, she was shocked to discover
about him the appearance of a riotous indulgence.
Born and educated as she was in the Ireland of the
eighteenth century, this circumstance would not have
much disturbed the mind of our heroine, but that it
became gradually more frequent of occurrence, and
seemed rather to indicate a voluntary habit, than that
necessity to which even sober people were often subjected,
when they mingled in the Society of Irish country gentle-
men of that period. Eily thus experienced, for the first
time, and with an aching spirit, one of the keenest
anxieties of married life.
"Hardress," she said to him one morning when he
was preparing to depart, after an interval of gloomy
silence, long unbroken, "I won't let you go among those
fine ladies any more, if you be thinking of them always
when you come to me again."
Her husband started like one conscience-struck, and
looked sharply round upon her.
"What do you mean?" he said with a slight contrac-
tion of the brows.
. "Just what I say, then," said Eily, smiling and nodd-
ing her head with a pretty affectation of authority.
"Those fine ladies mustn't take you from Eily. And
## p. 208 (#212) ############################################
208 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
I'll tell you another thing, Hardress. Whisper." She
laid her hand on his shoulder, raised herself on tip-toe,
and murmured in his ear: "I'll not let you among the
fine gentleman either, if that's the teaching they give
you."
"What teaching?"
"Oh, you know yourself." Eily continued, nodding
and smiling; "it is a teaching that you would never learn
from Eily, if you spent the evenings with her as you used
to do in the beginning. Do you know is there e'er a
priest living in this neighbourhood?"
"Why do you ask?"
"Because I have something to tell him that lies upon
my conscience."
"And would you not confess your failings to an affec-
tionate friend, Eily, as well as to a holier director P"
"I would," said Eily, bending on him a look of piercing
sweetness, "if I thought he would forgive me atterwards
as readily."
"Provided always that you are a true penitent," re-
turned Hardress, reaching her his hand.
"There is little fear of that," said Eily. "It would be
well for me, Hardress, if I could as easily be penitent for
heavier sins."
After a moment's deep thought, Eily resumed her
playful manner, and placing both her hands in the still
expanded one of her husband, she continued: "Well,
then, sir, I'll tell you what's troubling me: I'm afraid
I'm going wrong entirely this time back. I got married,
sir, a couple o' months ago, to one Mr. Hardress Cregan,
a very nice gentleman, that I'm very fond of."
"Too fond, perhaps."
"I'm afraid so, rightly speaking, although I hope he
doesn't think so. But he told me when he brought me
down to Killarney, that he was going to speak to his
friends (the brow of the listener darkened), and to ask
their forgiveness for himself and Eily. And there's
nearly two months now, since I came, and what I have
to charge myself with, sir, is, that I am too fond of my
husband, and that I don't like to vex him by speaking
## p. 209 (#213) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 209
about it, as may be it would be my duty to do. And,
besides, I don't keep my husband to proper order at all.
I let him stop out sometimes for many days together, and
then I'm very angry with him, but when he comes, I'm
so foolish and so glad to see him, that I can't look cross,
or speak a hard word, if I was to get all Ireland for it.
And more than that, again; I'm not at all sure how he
spends his time while he is out, and I don't ever question
him properly about it. I know there are a great many
handsome young ladies where he goes to, and a deal of
gentlemen that are very pleasant company after dinner;
for indeed, my husband is often more merry than wise,
when he comes home to me late at night, and still Eily
says nothing. And, besides all this, I think my husband
has something weighing upon his mind, and I don't make
him tell it to me, as a good wife ought to do; and I like
to have a friend's advice, as you're good enough to offer
it, sir, to know what I'd do. What do you think about
him, sir? Do you think any of the ladies have taken his
fancy? Or do you think he's growing tired of Eily P
Or that he doesn't think so much of her now that he
knows her better? What would you advise me to
do P"
"I am rather at a loss," said Hardress, with some
bitterness in his accent; "it is so difficult to advise a
zealous person."
"Jealous !" exclaimed Eily, with a slight blush.
"Ah, now I'm sorry I came to you at all, for I see you
know nothing about me, since you think that's the way.
I see now that you don't know how to advise me at all,
and I'll leave you there. What would I be jealous of P"
"Why, of those handsome young ladies that your
husband visits."
"Ah, if I was jealous that way," said Eily, with a keen
and serious smile, "that isn't the way I'd show it."
"How, then, Eily P"
"Why, first of all, I wouldn't as much as think of such
a thing without the greatest reason in the world, without
eing downright sure of it, and if I got that reason,
nobody would ever know of it, for I wouldn't say a word,
O

2 IO THE COLLEEN BAWN.
only walk into that room there, and stretch upon the bed,
and die."
"Why that's what many a brutal husband, in such a
case, would exactly desire."
"So itself," said Eily, with a flushed and kindling
cheek; "so itself. I wouldn't be long in his way, I'll
engage."
"Well, then," Hardress said, rising and addressing her
with a severe solemnity of manner, "my advice to you is
this. As long as you live, never presume to inquire into
your husband's secrets, nor affect an influence which he
never will admit. And if you wish to avoid that great
reason for jealousy, of which you stand in fear, avoid
suffering the slightest suspicions to appear; for men are
stubborn beings, and when such suspicions are wantonly
set afloat, they find the temptation to furnish them with
a cause almost irresistible."
"Well, Hardress," said Eily, "you are angry with me,
after all. Didn't you say you would forgive me? Oh,
then, I'll engage I'd be very sorry to say anything, if I
thought you'd be this way."
"I am not angry," said Hardress, in a tone of vexation.
"I do forgive you," he added, in an accent of sharp
reproof; "I spoke entirely for your own sake."
"And wouldn't Hardress allow his own Eily her little
joke?"
"Joke!" exclaimed Hardress, bursting into a sudden
fit of passion, which made his eyes water and his limbs
shake as if they would have sunk beneath him. "Am

thousand horrid thoughts and temptations burning within

Devil is laughing at me, and Eily joins him."

"Oh, HardressHardress "
"Yes!you have the best right to laugh, for you are
the gainer. Curse on you ! Curse on your beauty

is because I find not among them your meanness and
vulgarity. If I get drunk and make myself the beast you
say, it is in the hope to forget the iron chain that binds
me to you."
"Oh, Hardress," shrieked the affrighted girl, "you are
not in earnest now P''
"I am; I do not joke l' her husband exclaimed with a
hoarse vehemence. "Let go my knees you are sure
enough of me. I am bound to you too firmly."
"Oh, my dear Hardress! Oh, my own husband, listen
to me! hear your own Eily for one moment! Oh, my

back, and looking upward with expanded mouth and
eyes, while she maintained her kneeling posture and
clasped her husband's feet. "Merciful Heaven, direct

On a sudden, while Hardress was still struggling to
free himself from her arms, without doing her violence,
Eily felt a swimming in her head and a cloud upon her
sight. The next instant she was motionless.
..The first face she beheld, on recovering from her insen.
sibility, was that of Poll Naughten, who was seated in a
low chair, and supporting Eily's head against her knees,
## p. 212 (#216) ############################################
212 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
while she was striking her in the open palm with a prodi-
gious violence.
"Ah, there she dhraws the breath," said Fighting
Poll. "Oh, wirra, missiz, what brought you out on yout
face and hands on the middle of the floore, that way ?"
Eily muttered some unmeaning answer, and remained
for some minutes struggling with the consciousness of
some undefined horror. Looking around at length, and
missing the figure of Hardress, she lay back once more,
and burst into a fit of hysterical weeping. Phil Naughten,
who was smoking a short pipe by the fire-side, said some-
thing in Irish to his wife, to which the latter replied in
the same language, and then turning to Eily, said: "Will
you take a dhrop of anything, a-chree ?"
Eily raised her hand in dissent.
"Will you come in, and take a stretch on the bed,
then P"
To this Eily answered in the affirmative, and walked,
with the assistance of her hostess, into her sleeping
chamber. Here she lay during the remainder of the day,
the curtain suffered to fall so as to keep the broad sun-
shine from her aching eyes and head. Her reflections,
however, on the frightful and sudden alteration which
had taken place in her condition were cut short, ere long,
by a sleep of that sound and dreamless nature which
usually supervenes after an excess of passionate excite-
ment or anxiety.
In the meantime Hardress hurried along the Gap
Road with the speed of one who desires to counteract,
by extreme bodily exertion, the turbulence of an uneasy
spirit. As he passed the lonely little bridge, which
crosses the stream above the Black Lake, his attention
was suddenly arrested by the sound of a familiar voice
which appeared to reach him from the clouds. Looking
over his shoulder to the summit of the Purple Mountain,
he beheld Danny Mann nearly a thousand feet above
him, moving towards the immense pile of loose stones
(from the hue of which the mountain has derived its
name), and driving before him a small herd of goats, the
property of his brother-in-law. Turning off the road,
a-

Hardress commenced the ascent of this toilsome emi-
nencepartly because the difficulty afforded a relief
to his spirits, and partly because he wished to converse
with his dependent.
Although the day was fine, and sometimes cheered
with sunshine near the base of the mountain, its summit
was wrapped in mist, and wet with incessant showers.
The scenery around was solitary, gigantic, and sternly
barren. The figure of some wonder-hunting tourist, with
a guide-boy bearing his portfolio and umbrella, appeared
at long intervals, among the lesser undulations of the
mountain-side, and the long road which traversed the
fy valley dwindled to the width of a meadow foot-
path.
On the opposite side of the enormous ravine, the grey
and misty Reeks still raised their crumbling summits far
above him. Masses of white mist gathered in sullen
congress between their peaks, and, sometimes floating
upward in large volumes, were borne majestically onward,
catching a thousand tints of gold and purple from the
declining sun. Sometimes a trailing shower of mingled .
mist and rain would sweep across the intervening chasm,
like the sheeted spectre of a giant, and present to the eye
of the spectator that appearance which supplied the
imagination of Ossian with its romantic images. The
mighty gorge itself, at one end, appeared to be lost and
divided amid a host of mountains tossed together in pro-
voking gloom and misery. Lower down, it opened upon
a wide and cultivated champaign, which at this altitude
presented the resemblance of a rich mosaic of a thousand
colours, and afforded a bright contrast to the barren
shrubless gloom of the solitary vale itself.
As Hardress approached the summit, this scene of
grandeur and of beauty was shut out from his view by
the intervening mist, which left nothing visible but the
peak on which he stood, and which looked like a barren
islet in a sea of vapour. Above him was a blue sky.
broken up with masses of cloud, against which the rays
of the sun were refracted, with various effect, according
to their degrees of density and altitude. Occasionally,
## p. 214 (#218) ############################################
2I4 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
as Hardress pressed onward through the heath, a heavy
grouse would spring up at his feet, challenge, and wheel
to the other side of the mountain. Sometimes, also, as
he looked downward, a passing gust of wind would draw
aside the misty veil that lay between him and the world,
and cause the picture once more to open on his sight.
His attendant now met and greeted him as usual.
"It's well for you, Masther Hardress, dat hasn't a flock
o' goats to be huntin' after dis mornin', my heart is
broke from 'em, dat's what it is. We turn 'em out in de
mornin', and dough dey have plenty to ait down dere,
dey never stop till dey go to de top o' the mountain,
nothin' less would do for 'em ; like many o' the Chris-
tians demselves, dey'll be mountin'always, even when 'tis
no good for 'em."
"I have no remedy," said Hardress, musing, "and yet
the thought of enduring such a fate is intolerable."
"What a fine day this would be for the water, master?"
continued his servant. "You don't ever care to take a
sail now, sir?"
"Oh, Kyrle, Kyrle Daly, what a prophetic truth was in
your words 1 Giddy, headlong wretch that I have been
I wish that my feet had grown to my mother's hearth
when I first thought of evading her control, and marry-
ing without her sanction." He paused in a mood of
bitter retrospection. "I'll not endure it," he again
exclaimed, starting from his reverie; "it shall not be
without recall. I will not, because I cannot. Monster
monster that I am | Wed one, and woo another | Both
now are cheated | Which shall be the victim P"
The Devil was at his ear, and whispered, "Be not
uneasy; hundreds have done the same before you."
"Firm as dat mountain stands, an' as it stood dis
hundred, aye, dis tousand year, maybe," continued Danny
Mann, "still an' all, to look up dat way at dem great
loose stones, dat look as if dey were shovelled up above
us by some joyants or great people of ould, a body would
tink it hardly safe to stand here onder'em, in dread dey'd
come tumblin' down, maybe, an' make smidereens of him,
bless the mark I Wouldn't he now, Master Hardress?"
## p. 215 (#219) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN, 215
The person so addressed turned his eyes mechanically
in the same direction. A kind of desperate satisfaction
was visible on his features, as the idea of insecurity which
his servant suggested became impressed upon his mind.
The latter perceived and understood its expression on
the instant.
"Dere's something troublin' you, Master Hardress;
dat I see plain enough. An''tisn't now, nor to-day, nor
'isterday, I seen it aider. Is dere anyting Danny Mann
can do to sarve you? If dere be, say de word dis
moment, an' I'll be bail he'll do it before long."
"Danny," said Hardress, after a pause, "I am troubled.
I was a fool, Danny, when I refused to listen to your
advice upon one occasion."
"An' dat was de time when I tould you not to go again
de missiz, an' to have no call to Eily O'Connor."
"It was."
"I tought it would be dis way. I tought, all along,
dat Eily was no wife for you, Master Hardress. It was
not in nature she could be ; a poor man's daughter,
widout money, or manners, or book-larnen', or one ha'-
port'. I told you dat, Master Hardress, but you wouldn't
hear me by any means, an' dis is de way of it now."
"Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis done," said Hardress, with
sullen impatience; "I was to blame, and I am suffering
for it."
"Does she know herself de trouble she is to you?"
"I could not keep it from her. I did not know
myself how utterly my dislike had prevailed within me,
until the occasion arose for giving it utterance, and then
it came forth at once like a torrent. I told her what I
felt; that I hated, that I was sick of her. I could not
stop my tongue. My heart struck me for the base un-
kindness, the ungrateful ruffianism of my speech, and yet
I could not stop my tongue. I have made her miserable,
and I am myself accursed. What is there to be done?
Have you only skill to prevent mischief? Have you none
to remedy?"
Danny took thought for a moment. "Sorrow throuble
would I ever give myself about her," he said at last,
## p. 216 (#220) ############################################
216 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"only send her home packin' to her fader, and give her
no tanks."
"And with what face should I appear before my
honourable friends, when that old rope-maker should
come to demand redress for his insulted child, and to
claim her husband's promise? Should I send Eily
home to earn for myself the reputation of a faithless
villain P"
"I never tought o' dat," said Danny, nodding his
head. "Dat's a horse of anoder colour. Why, then,
I'll tell you what I'd do. Pay her passage out to
Quabec, and put her aboord of a three-master, without
ever sayin' a word to anybody. I'll tell you what it is,
Master Hardress. Do by her as you do by dat glove
you have on your hand. Make it come off as it come
on, and if it fits too tight take de knife to it."
"What do you mean?"
"Only gi' me the word, as I said before, an' I'll
engage Eily O'Connor will never trouble you any more.
Don't ax me any questions at all, only, if you're agree-
able, take off dat glove an' give it to me for a token.
Dat'll be enough; lave de rest to Danny."
A doubtful, horrible sensation of fear and anxiety
gathered upon the heart of the listener, and held him for
a minute fixed in breathless agitation. He gazed upon
the face of his servant with an expression of gaping
terror, as if he stood in the presence of the arch-tempter
himself. At length, walking up to him, he laid his oper
hand upon his neck, and then drawing his fingers close,
until the fellow's face was purple with blood, he shook
him as if he would have shaken his joints out of their
sockets.
"Villain l' he exclaimed, with a hoarseness and vehe-
mence of tone which gave an appalling depth to his
expressions. "Dangerous villain and tempter | If you
ever dare again to utter a word or meditate a thought of
violence towards that unhappy creature, I will tear you
limb from limb between my hands."
"Oh, murder, Master Hardress! Dat the hands may

"Do you mark me well, now? I am quite in earnest.
Respect her as you would the highest lady in the land.
Do as she commands you without murmuring. If I hear
her say (and I will question her upon it) that you have
leered one glance of those blood-longing eyes upon her,
it shall be their last look in this world."
if "Oh, vo! Dat I may never die in sin, Master Hardress,
"Begone! I am glad you have opened my eyes. I
tread more safely now. My heart is lighter. Yet that I
should have endured to be so tempted! Fellow, I doubt
you for worse than you appear. We are here alone; the
world, the busy world, is hid beneath us, and we stand
here alone in the eye of the open Heaven, and without
roof or wall to screen us, even in fancy, from the down-
right reproach of the beholding angels. None but the
haughty and insulting Lucifer himself could think of
daring Providence upon the threshold of his own region.
But be you fiend or mortal, I defy and dare you; I repel
your bloody temptation. I tell you, fiend or mortal, that
my soul abhors your speech and gesture both. I may be
wretched and impious; I may send up to Heaven a cry of
discontent and murmuring; the cry of blood shall never
leave this earth for me. Blood! Whose blood? Hers?
Great Heaven! Great Heaven defend me!" He covered
his face with his hands, and bent down for a moment in
dreadful agitation; then suddenly starting up, and waving
his hand rapidly, he continued, "Away, away at once, and
quit my sight. I have chosen my doom. My heart may
burn for years within my breast, if I can find no other
way to soothe it. I know how to endure. I am wholly
ignorant of guilt like this. Once more," he added,
clenching his fist, and shaking it towards his startled
dependent, "once more I warn you, mark my words and
obey them." -
So saying, he hurried down the hill, and was hid in
the ascending mist, while his affrighted servant remained
gaping after him, and muttering mechanically such asseye-
rations as, "Dat I may never sin, Master Hardress! dat

harm l'"
More than half of the frantic speech of Hardress, it
may be readily imagined, was wholly unintelligible to
Danny, who followed him down the mountain, half crazy
with terror, and not a little choked into the bargain.

CHAPTER XXIII.
How AN UNExPECTED visitoR ARRIVED IN EILY's
COTTAGE.
TowARDs night-fall Eily awoke with that confused and
strange feeling which a person experiences who has slept
at an unaccustomed hour. The sun had already set;
but the red and faintly lustrous shadow of the window,
which was thrown on the opposite wall, showed that his
refracted light was yet strong and bright on the horizon.
While she lay back endeavouring to recall the circum-
stances which brought her into her present situation, a
voice assailed her ear which made her start in sudden
alarm from her reclining posture. It was that of a person
singing, in a low voice, outside her window, the following
words:
"As I roved out on a fine summer morning,
A speculating most curiously,
To my surprise I soon espied
A charming fair one approaching me.
I stood awhile"
Here the melodist knocked gently at the door of the
cottage.
"I stood awhile in deep meditation,
Contemplating what I should do;
Till, at length, recruiting all my sensation,
I thus accosted the fair Colleen rue.""
At the close of the verse, which was prolonged by the
* Red-haired girl.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 219,
customary nasal twang, the singer knocked a little more
loudly with the knuckle of his forefinger:-
"Oh, was I Hecthor, that noble victhor,
Who died a victim to the Grecian skill;
Or was I a Paris, whoase deeds were vaarious,
As an arbithraator on Ida's hill,
I'd roam through Asia, likewise Arabia,
Or Pennsylvania 22
Here he knocked again.
"Or Pennsylvania, looking for you,
Through the burning ragions, like famed Orphesus,
For one embrace of you, Colleen rue."
"I am ruined I am undone !" thought Eily, as she
listened in deep distress and fear; "my father has found
me out, and they are all come to look for me. Oh,
Hardress || Hardress |"
"They're all dead or dhraming here, I believe," said
the singer; "I'm in fine luck if I have to go down the
ould gap again afther nightfall." Stimulated by this
reflection, he turned his back to the door, and began
kicking against it with his heel, while he continued his
song:
"And are you Aurora, or the goddess Flora,
Or Eutherpasia, or fair Vanus bright,
Or Helen fair, beyond compare,
Whoam Paris stole from the Grecian's sight?
Thou fairest creature, how you've inslaved me !
I'm intoxicated by Cupid's clue,
Whoase golden notes and infatuations
Have deranged my ideas for you, Colleen rue."
PIere the same air was taken up by a shrill and broken
female voice, at a little distance from the house, and in
the words which follow:
"Sir, I pray, be aisy, and do not tease me
With your false praises most jestingly;
Your golden notes and insiniwayshuns
Are vaunting speeches decaiving me.
I am not Aurora, nor the goddess Flora,
But a rural female to all men's view,
Who's here condoling my situation,
And my appellation is the Colleen rue."
## p. 220 (#224) ############################################
22O THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"You're not Aurora !" muttered the first voice.
"Wisha, dear knows, it isn't aisy to conthradict you.
They'd be the dhroll Auroras an' Floras, if that's the
figure they cut. Ah, Mrs. Naughten l' he added, raising
and changing his voice as the shadow of the female figure
crossed the window of Eily's apartment, "How are you
this evening, ma'am P I hope you got well over your
voyage that morning?"
"What voyage P. Who is it I have there at all?" said
Poll, in a tone of surprise. "Oh, Lowry Loobyl Oh,
ma-gra-hul how is every inch of you, Lowry? It raises
the very cockles o' my heart to see you."
"Purty well, indeed, as for the health, Mrs. Naughten,
we're obleest to you."
"Oh, vo, vo! An' what brought you into this part of
the world, Lowry P It's a long time since you an' I met?"
""Tis as good as two months, almost, I b'lieve."
"Two months, eroo? 'Tis six years if it's a day."
"Oh, iss, for good; but I mane the time we met in the
cottage behind at the dairy-farm, the night o' the great
storm, when ye were near being all lost in the boat, if it
wasn't the will O' Heaven."
"The dairy farm! lost in the boat! I don't know what
is it you're talkin' about at all, man. But come in, come
in, Lowry, and take a sate. Stop, here's Phil. Phil, eroo,
this is Lowry Looby, that you heerd me talk of being a
friend o' the Hewsans formerly."
Thus introduced, Phil and Lowry both took off their
hats, and bowed repeatedly with a most courteous profun-
dity of obeisance. The door was then opened, and a
polite contest arose as to the right of precedence between
the gentlemen, which was finally decided in favour of
Lowry, as the visitor.
"Well, Lowry, what news eastwards?" was the next
question.
"Oh, then, nothing sthrange, Mrs. Naughten. I was
twice by this way since I seen you that night. Coming
from Cork I was to-day, when I thought I'd step over
and see how you wor after the voyage. I left the horse
an' car over in Mr. Cregan's yard."

"I believe you're lost with the hunger. Phil, stir
yourself, an' put down something for supper."
"Don't hurry yourself on my account," said Lowry,
affecting an indifference which he did not feel; "I took
something at Mr. Cregan's. I saw Masther Hardress
there in the parlour windee, playin' chests (I think it is
they called it) with Miss Anne Chute. Oh, murder,
that's a darling, a beautiful lady | Her laugh is like.
music. Oh, dear! oh, dear! To see the smile of her,
though, an' she looking at him It flogged the world !
Mike, the boy they have there, an' old Nancy, told me.
she's greatly taken with the young masther."
"Why, then, she may as well throw her cap at him."
"Why so, eroo?"
"Ohfor raisons."
"There's one thing Mike told me, an' I'm sure I
wondher I never heerd a word of it before ; that there
was some talks of herself and my young masther, Mr.
Kyrle Daly. I know he used to be going there of an
odd time, but I never heard anything that way. There's
a dale that's looking ather her, Mike tells me. Who-
ever gets her, they say, he'll have as much jewels to
fight, as will keep him going for the first quarther, any
way."
*Tha go bragh," said Phil, tossing his head; "that's.
what bothers the gentlemen. Jewels, jewels, always."
"Jewels always, then, just as you say, Misther
Naughten," said Lowry. "It's what ruins 'em, body and
soul. At every hand's turn, nothing but a jewel ! Let
there be a conthrairy look, and pistols is the word at
once."
"An' if a poor boy is reflected upon, an' goes to a fair
to thry it out with an innocent little kippen, 'oh, the
savages t the gentlemen cry at once; 'oh, the blood-
thirsty villyans !' And they'll go themselves and shoot
one another like dogs, for less raison."
"It's thrue for you," returned Lowry. "Sure 'twould
be a blessing for a man to be aiting a dhry piatie from
morning till night, an' to have quietness. I'll tell you
what it is, Misther Naughten, I spake for myself; of all.

things going, I wouldn't like to be a born gentleman.
They're never out o' trouble, this way or that way. If
they're not fighting, they have more things upon their
mind than would bother a dozen poor men; an' if they go
divarting, ten to one they have a jewel before the day is
over. Sure, if it was a thing two gentlemen axed a lady
to dance, an' she gave into one of 'em, the other should
challenge him for to go fighting! Sure that flogs Europe!
And they have so much books to read to be able to
convarse genteel before the ladies. I'm told a gentleman
isn't fit to show his face in company till he reads as much
books as would stretch from this to the doore over. And
then to be watching yourself, an' spake Englified, an' not
to ate half your 'nough at dinner, an' to have 'em all
looking at you if you took too big a bit or done anything
again' manners, and never to have your own fling, an' let
you do what you liked yourself! I wouldn't lade such a
life if I got Europe. A snug stool by the firesidea
boiled piatee in one hand, a piggin o' milk in the other,
and one (that I won't name now) smiling overright me,
that's all the gentility I'd ever ax for in this world, any
way. I'd almost as lieve be born a female as a gentle-
man, maning no offence to the ladies, Mrs. Naughten."
"Every one to his taste, Lowry. Many men have
many minds. Phil, will you go out now and help Danny
to put up them goats, not to have them strayin' over on
Myles Murphy's ground as they wor o' Cheusday week?
I see Danny coming down the mountain."
The obedient husband did as he was commanded, and
Lowry took advantage of his absence to enter into a
more confidential communication with his formidable
hostess.
"Well, Mrs. Naughten, if I was to hear a person swear
this upon a book, I'd say 'twas a lie he was telling me, if
I didn't see it with my own eyes."
"What is it you say?"
"Oh, then, nothing but what I'm well pleased to see.
Well, I thought that one that once gave themselves a bad
habit, could never be broke of it again, no more than a
horse could be broke of starting."
## p. 223 (#227) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 223
At this the virago fixed upon him a kindling and suspi-
cious eye.
"And tell me now, Mrs. Naughten," continued Lowry,
not perceiving the indication of incipient wrath, "how did
it come on you first when you dhropt the cursing that way
entirely? I think I'd feel a great loss for the first week
or fortnight."
"Folly on! Misther Looby, folly on! You're welcome
to your sport this evening."
"Sport? Faiks it's no sport to me, only an admiration.
All the people that I ever heerd of making a vow o' the
kind wor sure to break it again, if they didn't get inside of
it one way or another by shkaming. Sure there was, to
my knowledge, John O'Reilly, the blacksmith, near Castle
Chute, made as many vows as I have fingers an' toes
again' the dhrink, and there isn't one of 'em but what he
got the advantage of. First, he med a vow he wouldn't
dhrink a dhrop for six months to come, any way, either
in a house or out of a house. An' sure 'tis where I found
him the fortnight afther, was at Mike Normile's, an' he
dhrinking as if it was for bets, an' sitting in a chair upon
the threshold o' the doore with a leg at this side and a
leg at that. 'Is that the way you're keeping your vow,
Misther O'Reilly P' says I, when I see him. 'Tis,' says
he, "what else? Sure I can dhrink here,' says he, "an'
no thanks, while I'm neither in the house nor out of it.'
An' sure 'twas thrue for him. Well, there's no use in
talking, but some people would live where a fox would
starve. Sure, of another time, he med a vow he wouldn't
drink upon Ireland ground, an' where do you think did I
get him ather, only sitting cross-legs upon a branch o'
the big beech tree near Normile's, an' he still at the
ould work, dhrinking away ! "Wisha, long life to you,"
says I,' if that's the way; a purty fruit the tree bears in
you," says I, 'this morning." People o' that kind, Mrs.
Naughten, has no business making vows at all, again' the
dhrink or the cursing either.
"I'm hearing to you, Lowry," said Fighting Poll, with
an ominous sharpness in her accent.
"An' do you hold to the same plan still, ma'am P"
## p. 224 (#228) ############################################
224 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"What plan do you mane?"
"The same plan as when I met you that night at the
Dairy Cottage. Not to be talking, nor drinking, nor
cursing, nor swearing, nor fighting, nor Oh! murther,
Mrs. Naughten, sure you're not going to sthrike me inside
your own doore?"
"To be sure I would, when I see you daar make a
hand o' me !"
"Me make a hand o' you, woman what hand am I
makin'?"
"Every hand "exclaimed the Penthesilea, raising her
voice. So saying, and with the accustomed yell of onset,
she flourished her short stick, and discharged a blow at
Lowry's little head, which, if it had not been warded off
by a dexterous interposition of the chair on which he had
been sitting, would have left him something to think of
for a week to come.
The scuffle waxed hot, and would doubtless have
terminated in some serious bodily injury to the party
that assailed, but that the sudden re-entrance of Phil, with
his brother-in-law, Danny Mann, brought it to a premature
termination."
"Poll ! Poll, ayeh Misther Looby What's the
matter? Worn't ye as thick as cousins this moment."
"Ah, Lowry, is dat you? What's all dis about?"
"Don't hould me, Phil, an' I'll bate him while bating
is good for him; an' that's from this till morning."
"Here's usage, Mr. Naughten I Mr. Mann, here's
thratement Gi' me my ould hat an' let me be off; I
was a fool to come at all ! And after my civility east-
wards, when you come dhripping wet into the cottage 1
Well, it's all one."
"Whist, eroo !" said Danny Mann, in a conciliating
tone, "come dis way, Lowry, I want to talk to you."
And he led him out of the cottage.
Eily, who was perfectly aware of the cause of this mis-
conception, had listened to the whole scene, at one time
with intense and painful anxiety, and at another with an
inclination to laugh, in spite of all the difficulties and
fiangers by which she was surrounded. Before long,
## p. 225 (#229) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 225
however, an idea entered her mind, which wholly de-
tached her attention from the mele in the kitchen. She
resolved to write to her father by Lowry, to make him
aware, at least, of her safety, and of her hope to meet him
again in honour, if not in happiness. This would at least
remove one great load from her mind, and prepare him
for her return.
While she arranged her writing materials at the small
table, the thoughts of home came crowding on her so
thick and fast, that she found a difficulty in proceeding
with her task. It was an humble home, to be sure, but
yet it was her home. He was an humble father, but he
was her father. She painted a little picture, uncon-
sciously to her own mind, of that forsaken dwelling. She
saw her father sitting by the turf fire, leaning forward with
his elbow resting on his knee, a finger beneath his temple,
and his grey, watery eye fixed on her accustomed chair,
which stood empty, on the opposite side. His hair had
received another shower of silver since they parted. She
scarcely dared to breathe aloud, lest she should disturb
the imagined loneliness of his condition. On a sudden
she figured to herself the latched door put gently back,
and the form of Lowry Looby entering with her letter in
his hand. She marked the air of cold and sad indifference
with which the old man recognised him and received
the letter. He looked at the directionstartedtore off
the seal, and looked within, while his whole frame trem-
bled until the grey hairs were shaken loose upon his
temples; she saw the passion struggling in his throat,
and her own eyes were blinded by tears. The picture
here became too vivid for her feelings, and pushing the
little desk aside, she sank down into her chair in a violent
fit of sobbing.
While she remained in this condition, Poll Naughten
entered the room, arranging her disordered head-dress,
and bearing still upon her countenance the traces of the
vanished storm. Its expression, however, was completely
altered when she observed the situation of Eily.
"What ails you, a'ra gal?" she asked in a softened
voice; "Arm't you betther afther the sleep at all?"
P

226 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Poll, do you know that man who is in the kitchen?"
"Is it Lowry Looby? Ah ha the scoundhrill 'tis
I that do, an' I'll make him he'll know me, too, before I
part him."
"Hush, Poll, come hither. I want you to do me a
service. I know this man too."
"Why then, he's little credit to you or any one else."
"I want to caution you against saying a word on my
name while he is in the house. It would be ruinous both
to your master and myself."
"Faiks, I'll engage he won't be a bit wiser of it for Poll
Naughten."
"And I wish, besides, that you would give him, if he
intends going to Limerick, a letter which I will have for
you in a few minutes. You need not tell him from
whom it comes; do not even let him know that it is
from a person in the house. And now, Poll, will you
light me one of those candles, and close the window-
shutters?"
This was done, and Eily commenced her letter. Before
she proceeded far, however, it occurred to her, that the
superscription might awaken the suspicions of Lowry,
and besides, she felt a very accountable difficulty about
the manner of addressing her offended parent. Finally
she decided on forwarding a brief and decorous note to
"Mr. Dunat O'Leary, Hair-cutter, Garryowen;" in which
she requested him to communicate to his old neighbour
the circumstances of which she desired the latter should
be made aware.
Whilst she folded the letter, she heard the cottage door
once more open, and two persons enter the kitchen. A
stillness ensued, which was broken by the voice of Danny
Mann.
"I was spaking to dis boy here, Poll," he said, "an' I
see 'tis all rising out of a mistake betune de two o' ye.
He didn't mane anything by it, he tells me. Eh, Lowry P"
"It would be long from me, Mrs. Naughten, to say
anything offensive to you, or any o' your people. Misther
Mann, here, explained to me the nature o' the matther,
I own I din't mane a ha'p'orth."
## p. 227 (#231) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 227
"Well, that's enough, that's enough. Give him the
hand, now, Poll," said her husband, "and let us ate our
little supper in pace."
Eily heard no more, and the clatter of knives and
forks, soon after, informed her that the most perfect har-
mony had been re-established amongst the parties.
Nothing further occurred to disturb the good under-
standing which was thus fortunately restored, or to en-
danger the secret of our heroine, although Lowry was
not without making many inquiries as to the name and
quality of the lodger in the inner room. It was a long
time, too, before he ceased to speculate on the nature of
the letter to Foxy Dunat. On this his hostess would
give him no information, although he threw out several
hints of his anxiety to obtain it, and made many con-
jectures of his own, which he invariably ended by tossing
the head, and declaring that "it flogged the world."

CHAPTER XXIV.
How EILY UNDERTAKES A JOURNEY IN THE ABSENCE
OF HER HUSBAND.
EILy heard Lowry Looby take his departure on the next
morning with as lively a sensation of regret as if he had
been a dear friend. After the unkindness of her husband,
she trembled while she wept, to think that it might be a
long time before she could meet one more interested in
her fortunes.
Happier anticipations than this might not have been
so perfectly fulfilled. The first weeks of winter swept
gapidly away, and Eily neither saw nor heard from
JHardress. Her situation became every moment more
alarming. Her host and hostess, according as she
appeared to grow out of favour with their patron, became
at first negligent and surly, and at last insulting. She
had hitherto maintained her place on the sunny side of
## p. 228 (#232) ############################################
228 THE COL.I.EEN BAWN.
Poll's esteem, by supplying that virago with small sume
of money from time to time, although her conscience
told her that thcse donations were not appropriated by
the receiver to any virtuous end. But now her stock
was running low. Hardressand this was from mere
lack of memoryhad left her almost wholly unprovided
with funds.
She resolved to write to him, not with the view of
obtaining mere pecuniary assistance, but in order to com-
municate the request which is subjoined in her own
simple language:
"My DEAR HARDRESS,
"Do not leave me here to spend the whole winter alone. If
Eily has done anything to offend you, come and tell her so; but
remember that she is now away from every friend in the whole
world. Even if you are still in the same mind as when you left me.
come, at all events, for once, and let me go back to my father. If
you wish it, nobody besides us three shall ever know what you were
to your own "EILY."
To this letter, which she entrusted to Danny the
Lord, she received no answer; neither Hardress nor his
servant being seen at the cottage for more than a week
after.
Matters, in the meantime, grew more unpleasing be-
tween Eily and her hosts. Poll treated her with the most
contemptuous rudeness, and Phil began to throw out
hints which it was difficult to misconceive, respecting their
poverty, and the unreasonableness of people thrusting
idlers upon them, when it was as much as they could do
to maintain themselves in honesty. But Poll, who pos-
sessed the national recklessness of expense, whenever
her husband spoke in this niggardly humour, turned on
him, not in defence of Eily, but in abuse of his "main-
ness," although she could herself use the very same cause
of invective when an occasion offered. Thus Eily, instead
cf commanding like a queen, as she had been promised,
was compelled to fill the pitiable situation of an insecure
2nd friendless dependent.
The wintry year rolled on in barrenness and gloom,
casting an air of iron majesty and grandeur over the
## p. 229 (#233) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 229
savage scenery in which she dwelt, and bringing close to
her threshold the first Christmas which she had ever spent
away from home. The Christmas Eve found her still
looking anxiously forward to the return of her husband, or
of his messenger. The morning had brought with it a
black frost, and Eily sat down alone to a comfortless
breakfast. No longer attended with that ready deference
which marked the conduct of the Naughtens while she
remained in favour, Eily was now obliged to procure and
arrange all the materials for her repast with her own
hands.
There was no butter nor cream ; but as this was one
of the great vigils or fast-days of her Church, which Eily
observed with a conscientious exactness, she did not
miss these prohibited luxuries. There was no fast upon
sugar, however, and Eily perceived, with some chagrin,
that the sugar-bowl also was empty. She walked softly
to the chamber-door, where she paused for a moment,
with her handkerchief placed before her cheeks, in that
beautiful attitude which Homer ascribes to Penelope at
the entrance of the "stout-built hall." At length she
raised the latch, and opened the door to a few inches
only.
"Poll," she said, in a timid and gentle voice, "do you
know where's the sugar P"
"It's in the cubert, I suppose," was the harsh and
unceremonious answer.
The fact was, Poll had begun to keep the Christmas the
evening before, and treated herself to a few tumblers of
hot punch, in the manufacture of which she had herself
consumed the whole of Eily's sweets. And there might
have been some cause of consolation, if Poll's temper had
been rendered the sweeter by all the sugar she took, but
this was not the case."
"There is none there, Poll," said Eily.
"Well, what hurt? Can't you put a double allowance
o' crame in the tay, and dhrink it raw for once."
"Ah, but this is a fast day," said Eily.
"Oyeh, choke it for work | Well, then, do as you
plase; I can't help you. I haven't a spoonful o' groceries

23o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
in the house, girl, except I went for 'ema thing I'd be
very unfond to do on a mornin' like this."
"Well, I can do without it, Poll," said Eily, returning
to the table, and sitting down to her, unmetaphorically,
bitter draught with the meekest resignation.
"Gi' me the money by-an'-by, when I'm goin' into
town for the Christmas candle, an' I'll buy it for you,
itself an' the tay."
"But I have no money, Poll."
"No money, inagh? An' isn't it upon yourself we're
depending this way to get in the things again' to-morrow,
a Christmas Day ?"
"Well, I have not a farthing."
"Didn't you tell me yourself, the other day, you had a
half-crown keepin' for me again' Hansel Monday?"
"I gave it to Danny. I thought I'd have more for
you before then."
Here Poll dashed in the door with her hand, and con-
fronted her affrighted lodger with the look and gesture of
a raging Bacchanal.
"An' is that my thanks P" she screamed aloud.
"Why, then, cock you up with bread and tay this
mornin'. Go look afther Danny, now, if you want your
bruk'ast." And so saying, she seized two corners of the
table-cloth, and upset the whole concern into the fire-
place.
Terror and astonishment deprived Eily for some
moments of the power of speech or motion; but when
she saw Poll taking breath for a moment, and looking
around to know what further devastation she might com-
mit, the forlorn helplessness of her condition rushed at
once upon her mind, and she fell back into her seat in a
violent fit of hysterics.
This is a condition in which one woman can rarely
behold another without emotion. Poll ran to her relief,
uttering every sound of affectionate condolence and
Encouragement which arose to her lips.
"Whist, now, a'ra gall Whist, now, missiz, a-chree ?
Oh, ma chree, ma'asthora, ma llanuv, you worl Howl,
now, a'ra gall Oh! vol vo!howl, asthorel What

ails you? Sure you know 'tis only funnin' I was. Well,
see this 1 Tell me anything now in the wide world I'll
do for you a'ra gal."
"Poll," said Eily, when she had recovered a certain
degree of composure, "there is one thing that you can do
for me, if you like, and it will relieve me from the greatest
distress."
"An' what is that, a-chree?"
"To lend me one of the ponies, and get me a boy
that can show me the way to Castle Island."
"Is it goin' you're thinkin' of."
"I will be here again," said Eily, "on to-morrow
evening." Eily spoke this without any vehemence of
assertion, and in the quiet manner of one who had never
been accustomed to have her words doubted. So irresis-
tible, too, is the force of simple truth, that Poll did not
even entertain a suspicion of any intent to deceive.
"An' what business would carry you to Castle Island,
a'ra gal?"
"I have a friend there, an uncle," Eily replied, with
tears starting into her eyes at the remembrance of her
old preceptor. "I am sure, Poll, that he would assist
me."
"I'm in dhread'tis goin' from uz you are now, o' count
o' what I said to you. Don't mind that at all. Stop here
as long as ever you like, an' no thanks. I'll step across
the road this minute, an' borry the sugar for you, if it's
it you want."
"No, no; I only want you to do as I have told you.
I'll engage to screen you from all blame."
"Blamel Ah, whose blame is it you think I'd be
afeerd of? I'll let you see that I'll do what I like myself,
an'get you the pony saddled an' all this minute. But you
didn't ate anything hardly. Here's more bread in the
cubbert, an'strengthen yourself again' the road while I'm
away."
She left the room, and Eily, who had little hope of
succeeding so easily in her request, proceeded to make

and animation as if she had discovered a sudden mode of

release from all her anxieties. For a considerable time
the prospect of meeting with her uncle filled her bosom
with a sensation of unmingled pleasure. If she looked
back (while she tied her bonnet strings below her chin,
and hurried on the plainest dress in her trunk), if she
.ooked back to those days in which her venerable relative
presided over her evening studies, and directed their
application, it was only to turn her eyes again upon the
future, and hope for their speedy renovation.
Having concluded her arrangements, and cautioned
Poll not to say a word of her destination in case Hardress
should come to the cottage, Eily now set out upon her
lonely journey. The person whom Poll Naughten had
procured her for a guide was a stout-made girl, who car-
ried an empty spirit-keg slung at her back in the tail of
her gown, which she had turned up over her shoulders.
She informed Eily that she was accustomed to go every
Saturday to a town at the distance of fourteen miles, and
to return in the evening with the keg full of spirits.
"But this week," she continued, "I'm obleest to go
twice, on account o' the Christmas Day falling in the
middle of it."
"And what does your employer want with so much
whisky?" said Eily, a little interested in the fortune of so
hard-working a creature.
"Want wi' the whisky, inagh P" exclaimed the moun-
tain girl, turning her black eyes on her companion in
surprise. "Sure isn't it she that keeps the public-house
above the Gap, an' what business would she have wid a
place o' the kind without a dhrop o' whisky."
"And what are you paid, now, for so long a journey as
that P" -
"Different ways, I'm paid, different times. If it is a
cowld evening when I come home, I take a glass o' the
spirits itself, in preference to any thing, an' if not, the
misthress pays me a penny every time."
"One penny only 1"
"One penny. Indeed it's too little, but when I spake
of it, the misthress tells me she can get it done for less.
So I have nothin' to say, but do as I'm bid."
## p. 233 (#237) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 233
Eily paused for some moments, while she compared
the situation of this uncomplaining individual with her
own. The balance of external comforts, at least, did not
appear to be on the side of the poor little mountaineer.
"And have you no other way of living now than this?"
she asked, with increasing interest.
"Illilo! Is it upon a penny a week you think I'd
live?" returned the girl, who was beginning to form no
very exalted idea of her companion's intellect.
"Do you live with your mistress?"
"No, I live with my ould father. We have a spot o
ground beyant for the piatees. Sometimes I dig it; but
mostly the young boys o' the place comes and digs it for
us on a Sunday or a holiday morning, an' I stick in the
seed.
"And is it for the sake of the father or the daughter
they take that trouble P"
"For the sake, I b'lieve, of the Almighty that made
'em both. Signs on, they have our prayers, night an'
morning."
"Is your father quite helpless?"
"Oyeh long from it. He's a turner; he makes little
boxes, and necklaces, and things that way, of the arbutus
and the black oak of the Lakes, that he sells to the
English and other quollity people that comes to see them.
But he finds it hard to get the timber, for none of it is
allowed to be cut, and 'tis only windfalls that he can take
when the stormy saison begins. Besides, there's more
in the town o' Killarney that outsells him. He makes
but a poor hand of it, ather all."
"I wonder you have not got a sweetheart. You are
very pretty and very good."
The girl here gave her a sidelong glance, and laughed
so as to exhibit a set of teeth of the purest enamel. The
1ook seemed to say: "Is that all you know about the
matter?" but her words were different in their significa-
tion.
"Oyeh, I don't like 'em for men," she said with a half
smiling, half coquettish air; "they're deceivers an' rovers,
I believe, the best o' 'em."
## p. 234 (#238) ############################################

"Well, I wouldn't think that now of that handsome
young man in the check shirt, that nodded to you as we
passed him awhile ago: he has an honest face."
The girl again laughed and blushed. "Why, then, I'll
tell you," she said at length, seduced into a confidence.
"If I'd b'lieve any of 'em, I think it is that boy; he is a
boatman on the Lakes, and airns a sight o' money, but it
goes as fast as it comes."
"How is that?"
"Oh then, he can't help it, poor fellow. Them boat-
men arn't allowed to dhrink anything while they're upon
the Lakes, except at the stations; but then, to make up
for that, they all meet at night at a hall in town, where
they stay dancing and dhrinking all night, till they spend
whatever the quollity gives 'em in the day. Luke Ken-
nedy (that's this boy) would like to save if he could, but
the rest wouldn't pull an oar with him, if he didn't do as
they do. So that's the way of it. And sometimes, after
being up all night a'most, you'll see 'em out again at the
first light in the mornin'. 'Tis a pity the quollity would:
give 'em money at all, only have it laid out for 'em in some
way that it would do 'em good. Luke Kennedy is a great
fencer, I'm tould. Himself an' Myles Murphy, behind,
are the best about the Lakes at the stick. Sure Luke
taught fencin' himself once. Did you ever hear o' the
great guard he taught the boys about the place?"
Fame had not informed Eily of this circumstance.
"Well, I'll tell you it. He gev it out one Sunday
upon some writing that was placed again the chapel door,
to have all the boys that wor for larnen to fence to come
to him at such a place, an' he'd taich 'em a guard that
would hindher 'em of ever being sthruck. Well, 'tis an
admiration what a gathering he had before him. So when
they wor all listenin', 'Boys,' says he, gettin' up on a table,
an' lookin' round him'boys, the guard I have to give
ye, that'll save ye from all sorts o' sthrokes, is thisto
keep a civil tongue in yer head at all times. Do that,'
says he, "an I'll be bail ye never'll get asthroke." Well,
you never seen people wondher so much, nor look so.

""Twas a good advice."
"And that's a thing Luke knew how to give better
than he'd take. I hardly spake to him at all now myself."
"Why so??"
"Oh! he knows himself. He wanted me a while ago.
to marry him, and to part my ould father."
"And you refused?" said Eily, blushing a conscious.
crimson.
"I hardly spoke to him after. He'd be the handsome
Luke Kennedy, indeed, if he'd make me part the poor
ould man that way, an' my mother dead, an' he having.
no one else but myself to do a ha'p'orth for him. What
could I expect if I done that? If Luke likes me, let him
come and show it by my father; if not, there's more
girls in the place, an' he's welcome to pick his choice for
Mary."
Every word of this speech fell like a burning coal upon
the heart of Eily. She paused a moment in deep emotion,
and then addressed her companion:-
"You are right, Maryyou are very right. Let no-
thinglet no man's love tempt you to forget your duty
to your father. Oh you don't know, much as you love
him, what thoughts you would have, if you were to leave
him, as you say. Let nothing tempt you to it. You.
would neither have luck, nor peace, nor comfort; and if
your husband should be unkind to you, you could not
turn to him again for consolation. But I need not be
talking to you; you are a good girl, and more fit to give
me advice, than to listen to any I can offer you."
From this moment Eily did not open her lips to her
companion until they arrived in Castle Island. The
Christmas candles were already lighted in every cottage,
and Eily determined to defer seeing her uncle until ther
following morning.

CHAPTER XXV.
HOW EILY FARED IN HER EXPEDITION.
AFTER a sharp and frosty morning, the cold sun of the
Christmas noon found Father Edward O'Connor seated
in his little parlour before a cheerful turf fire. A small
table was laid before it, and decorated with a plain break-
fast, which the fatigues of the forenoon rendered not a
little acceptable. The sun shone directly in the window,
dissolving slowly away the fantastic foliage of frost-work
upon the window-panes, and flinging its shadow on the
boarded floor. The reverend host himself sat in a medi-
tative posture, near the fire, awaiting the arrival of some
fresh eggs, over the cookery of which Jim, the clerk, pre-
sided in the kitchen. His head was drooped a little; his
eyes fixed upon the burning fuel, his nether lip a little
protruded, his feet stretched out and crossed, and the
small bulky volume in which he had been reading his
daily office, half closed in his right hand, with a finger left
between the leaves to mark the place. No longer a pale
and secluded student, Father Edward now presented the
appearance of a healthy man, with a face hardened by
frequent exposure to the winds of midnight and of morn,
and with a frame made firm and vigorous by unceasing
exercise. His eye, moreover, had acquired a certain
character of severity, which was more than qualified by a
inature of the tenderest benevolence.
On the table, close to the small tray which held his
simple equipage, was placed a linen bag, containing in
silver the amount of his Christmas offerings. They had
been paid him on the morning in crowns, half-crowns, and
shillings at the parish chapel. And Father Edward on
this occasion had returned thanks to his parishioners for
their liberalitythe half-yearly compensation for all his
toils and exertions, his sleepless nights and restless days,
amounting to no less a sum than thirteen pounds fourteen
shillings.
## p. 237 (#241) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 237'
"'Tis an admiration, sir," said Jim, the clerk, as he
entered, clad in a suit of Father Edward's rusty black,
laid the eggs upon the tray, and moved back to a decorous
distance from the table"'tis an admiration what a.
sighth o' people is abroad in the kitchen, money-hunting."
"Didn't I tell 'em the last time that I never would pay
a bill upon a Christmas Day again?"
"That's the very thing I said to 'em, sir. But 'tis the
answer they made me, that they came a long distance,
and 'twould cost 'em a day more, if they were obliged to
be coming again to-morrow."
Father Edward, with a countenance of perplexity and
chagrin, removed the top of the egg, while he cast a
glance alternately at the bag and at his clerk. "It is a
hard case, Jim," he said at last, "that they will not allow
a man even the satisfaction of retaining so much money
in his possession for a single day, and amuse himself by
fancying it his own. I suspect I am doomed to be no
more than a mere agent to this thirteen pounds fourteen,
after all; to receive and pay it away in a breath."
"Just what I was thinking myself, sir," said Jim, toss-
ing his head.
"Well, I suppose I must not cost the poor fellows a
day's work, however. Jim, if they have come such a dis-
tance. That would be a little pharisaical, I fear."
Jim did not understand this word, but he bowed, as if
he would say: "Whatever your reverence says must be:
correct."
"Who are they, Jim P" resumed the clergyman.
"There's Luke Scanlon, the shoemaker, for your
boots, sir; and Reardon, the blacksmith, for shoeing the
pony; and Miles-na-Coppaleen, as they call him, for the
price o' the little crathur; and the printer for your
reverence's subscription to the erry Zuminary; an"
Rawley, the carpenter, for the repairs o' the althar,
an 22
"Hut tut! he must settle that with the parishioners.
But the otherslet me see. Shoeing myself, fifteen shil-
lings; shoeing my pony, thirteen, four sets. Well! the
price of the 'little crathur, as you say, seven pounds ten.

(and she's well worth it); and, lastly, the newspaper man,
two pounds."
"But not lastly, intirely," said Jim, "for there's the
tailor"
"Sixteen and three pence. Jim, Jim, that will be a
great reduction on the thirteen pound fourteen."
"Just what I was thinking of myself, sir," said the
clerk.
"But I suppose they must have their money. Well,
bring me in their bills, and let them all write a settled at
the bottom."
Exit Jim.
"Here they are all, sir," he said, returning with a
parcel of soiled and crumpled papers in his hand; "and
Myles Murphy says that the agreement about the pony
was seven pound ten an' a glass o' whisky, an' that he
never knew a morning he'd sooner give your reverence a
resate for it than a frosty one like this."
"Let him have it, Jim. That was an item in the bar-
gain which had slipt my memory. An' as you are giving
it to him, take the bottle and treat them all round. They
'have a cold road before them."
"It's what I thought myself, sir," said Jim.
Father Edward emptied the bag of silver, and counted
it into several sums, the amount of all the bills. When
he had done so, he took in one hand the few shillings
that remained, threw them into the empty bag, jingled
them a little, smiled, and tossed his head. Jim, the clerk,
smiled, and tossed his head in sympathy.
"It's aiser emptied than filled, plase your reverence,"
said Jim, with a short sigh.
"If it were not for the honour and dignity of it,"
thought Father Edward after his clerk had once more left
the room, "my humble curacy at St. John's were prefer-
able to this extensive charge in so dreary a peopled
wilderness. Quiet lodgings, a civil landlady, regular hours
of discipline, and the society of my oldest friends; what
was there in these that could be less desirable than a cold
small house on a mountain-side, total seclusion from the
company of my equals, and a fearful increase of re-

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 239
sponsibility? Did the cause of preference lie in the
distinction between the letters V. P. and P. P. P and
the pleasure of paying away thirteen pounds fourteen
shillings at Christmas? Oh, world! world! world! You
are a great stage-coach, with fools for outside passengers;
a huge round lump of earth, on the surface of which men
seek for peace, but find it only when they sink beneath.
Would I not give the whole thirteen pounds fourteen at
this moment, to sit once more in my accustomed chair in
that small room, with the noise of the streets just dying
away as the evening fell, and my poor little Eily reading
to me from the window, as of old, as innocent, as happy,
and as dutiful as then? Indeed, I would, and more if I
had it. Poor Mihill Ah, Eily, Eily You deceived
me! Well, well! Old Mihil says I am too ready to
preach patience to him. I must try and practise it my-
self."
At this moment the parlour door opened again, and
Jim once more thrust in his head.
"A girl, sir, that's abroad, an' would want to see you,
if you plase."
"Who is she? What does she want? Confession, I
suspect."
"Just what I was thinking of myself, sir."
"Oh! why didn't she go to the chapel yesterday, where
I was sitting until ten at night?"
"It's the very thing I said to her myself, sir, and she
had no answer to make, only wanting to see you."
"Who is she? Don't you know her even by sight?"
"No, sir, in regard she keeps her head down, and her
handkerchief to her mouth. I stooped to have a peep
undernaith, but if I stooped low, she stooped lower, an'
left me just as wise as I was in the beginning."
"Send her in," said Father Edward; "I don't like that
secrecy."
Jim went out, and presently returned, ushering in with
many curious and distrustful glances, the young female of
whom he had spoken. Father Edward desired her to
take a chair, and then told the clerk to go out to the
stable, and give the pony his afternoon feed. When the

latter had left the room, he indulged in a preliminary
examination of the person of his visitor. She was young
and well formed, and clothed in a blue cloak and bonnet,
which were so disposed, as she sat, as to conceal altogether
both her person and her features.
"Well, my good girl," said the clergyman, in an en-
couraging tone, "what's your business with me?"
The young female remained for some moments silent,
and her dress moved as if it were agitated by some strong
emotion of the frame. At length, rising from her seat,
and tottering towards the astonished priest, she knelt
down suddenly at his feet, and exclaimed, while she un-
covered her face, with a burst of tears and sobbing; "Oh,
uncle Edward, don't you know me?" t
Her uncle started from his chair. Astonishment for
some moments held him silent and almost breathless.
He at last stooped down, and gazed intently on her face,
raised her, placed her on a chair, where she remained
quite passive, resumed his own seat, and covered his
face in silence with his hand. Eily, more affected by
this action than she might have been by the bitterest
reproaches, continued to weep aloud with increasing
violence.
"Don't crydo not afflict yourself," said Father Ed-
ward, in a quiet, yet cold tone; "there can be no use in
that. The Lord forgive you, child ! Don't cry! Ah,
Eily O'Connor! I never thought it would be our fate to
meet in this manner."
"I hope you will forgive me, uncle," sobbed the poor
girl; "I did it for the best, indeed."
"Did it for the best l'" said the clergyman, looking on
her for the first time with some sternness. "Now, Eily,
you will vex me, if you say that again. I was in hopes
that, lost as you are, you came to me, nevertheless, in
penitence and humility, at least, which was the only
consolation your friends could ever look for. But the
first word I hear from you is an excuse; a justification of
your crime. Did it for the best I Don't you remember,
Eily, having ever read in that book that I was accus-
tomed to explain to you in old timesdon't you remem-

ber that the excuses of Saul made his repentance
unaccepted? and will you imitate his example? You
lid it for the best, after all ! I won't speak of my own
sufferings since the unhappy affair; but there is your old
fatherI am sorry to hurt your feelings, but it is my
duty to make you know the extent of your guiltyour
old father has not enjoyed one moment's rest ever since
you left him. He was here with me a week since, for
the second time after your departure, and I never was
more shocked in all my life. You cry, but you would
cry more bitterly if you saw him. When I knew you
together, he was a good father to you, and a happy father,
too. He is now a frightful skeleton I Was that done for
the best, Eily P".
"Oh, no, no, sir; I did not mean to say that I acted
right, or even from a right intentionI only meant to
say, that it was not quite so bad as it might appear."
"To judge by your own appearance, Eily," her uncle
continued in a compassionate tone, "one would say that
its effects have not been productive of much happiness on
either side. Turn to the light: you are very thin and
pale. Poor child! poor child! oh, why did you do this P
What could have tempted you to throw away your health,
your duty, to destroy your father's peace of mind, and
your own honest reputation, all in a day ?"
"Uncle," said Eily, "there is one point on which I
fear you have made a wrong conclusion. I have been, I
know, sir, very ungrateful to you, and to my father, and
very guilty in the sight of Heaven, but I am not quite so
abandoned a creature as you seem to believe me. Dis-
obedience, sir," she added, with a blush of the deepest
crimson, "is the very worst offence of which I can accuse
myself."
"What l" exclaimed Father Edward, while his eyes lit
up with sudden pleasure; "are you, then, married?"
"I was married, sir, a month before I left my father."
The good clergyman seemed to be more deeply moved
by this intelligence than by anything which had yet
occurred in the scene. He winked repeatedly with his
eye-lids, in order to clear away the moisture which began
Q

242 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
to overspread the balls, but it would not do. The foun-
tain had been unlocked, it gushed forth in a flood too
copious to be restrained, and he gave up the contest.
He reached his hand to Eily, grasped hers, and shook it
fervently and long, while he said, in a voice that was
made hoarse and broken by emotion:
"Well, well, Eily, that's a great deal. 'Tis not every-
thing, but it is a great deal. The general supposition
was, that the cause of secrecy should be no other than a
shameful one. I am very glad of this, Eily. This will
be some comfort to your father." He again pressed her
hand, and shook it kindly, while Eily wept upon his own
like an infant.
"And where do you stay now, Eily?wherewho is
your husband?"
Eily appeared distressed at this question, and after
some embarrassment said: "My dear uncle, I am not at
liberty to answer you those questions at present. My
husband does not know of my having even taken this
step, and I dare not think of telling what he commanded
that I should keep secret."
"Secrecy still, Eily?" said the clergyman, rising from
his seat, and walking up and down the room with his
hands behind his back, and a severe expression returning
to his eye. "I say again, I do not like this affair. Why
should your husband affect this deep concealment? Is
he poor P Your father will rejoice to find it no worse.
Is he afraid of the resentment of your friends? Let him
bring back our own Eily, and he will be received with
arms as open as charity. What, besides conscious guilt,
can make him thus desirous of concealment?"
"I cannot tell you his reasons, uncle," said Eily,
timidly; "but, indeed, he is nothing of what you say."
"Well, and how do you live, then, Eily P. With his
friends, or how? If you will not tell where, you may at
*east tell how."
"It is not will not with me, indeed, uncle Edward, but
dare not. My first act of disobedience cost me dearly
enough, and I dare not attempt a second."
"Well, well," replied her uncle, a little annoyed, "you
## p. 243 (#247) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 243
have more logic than I thought you had. I must not
press you further on that head. But how do you live?
Where do you hear Mass on Sundays? Or do you hear
it regularly at all?"
"Eily's drooping head and long silence gave answer in
the negative.
"Do you go to Mass every Sunday at least? You
used to hear it every day, and a blessing fell on you and
on your house while you did so. Do you now attend it
on Sunday itself?"
Eily continued silent.
"Did you hear Mass a single Sunday at all since you
left home P" he asked in increasing amazement.
Eily answered in a whisper between her teeth"Not
one."
The good religious lifted up his hands to Heaven, and
then suffered them to fall motionless by his side. "Oh,
you poor child !" he exclaimed, "may the Lord forgive
you your sins! It is no wonder that you should be
ashamed, and afraid, and silent."
A pause of some moments now ensued, which was
eventually broken by the clergyman.
"And what was your object in coming, then, if you had
it not in your power to tell me anything that could enable
me to be of some assistance to you?"
"I came, sir," said Eily, "in the hope that you would,
in a kinder manner than anybody else, let my father
know all that I have told you, and inform him, moreover,
that I hope it will not be long before I am allowed to
ask his pardon, with my own lips, for all the sorrow that
I have caused him. I was afraid if I had asked my
husband's permission to make this journey, it might have
been refused. I will now return, and persuade him, if I
can, to come here with me again this week."
Father Edward again paused for a considerable time,
and eventually addressed his niece with a deep seriousness
of voice and manner. "Eily," he said, "a strong light
has broken upon me respecting your situation. I fear
this man, in whom you trust so much and so generously,
and to whose will you show so perfect an obedience, is
## p. 244 (#248) ############################################
244 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
not a person fit to be trusted nor obeyed. You are
married, I think, to one who is not proud of his wife.
Stay with me, Eily, I adviseI warn you. It appears
by your own words that this man is already a tyrant; he
loves you not, and from being despotic he may grow
dangerous. Remain with me, and write him a letter. I
do not judge the man. I speak only from general
probabilities, and these would suggest the great wisdom
of your acting as I say."
"I dare not, I could not, would not do so," said Eily.
"You never were more mistaken in any body's character
than in his of whom you are speaking. If I did not fear,
I love him far too well to treat him with so little con-
fidence. When next we meet, uncle, you shall know the
utmost of my apprehensions. At present, I can say no
more. And the time is passing, too," she continued,
looking at the sunshine which traversed the little room
with a ray more faint and more oblique. "I am pledged
to return this evening. Well, my dear uncle, good-bye!
I hope to bring you back a better niece than you are
parting now. Trust all to me for three or four days more,
and Eily never will have a secret again from her uncle nor
her father."
"Good-bye, childgood-bye, Eily " said the clergy-
man, much affected. "Staystay !" he exclaimed, as a
sudden thought entered his head. "Come here, Eily, an
instant." He took up the linen bag before mentioned,
and shook out into his hand the remaining silver of his
dues. "Eily," said he, with a smile, "it is a long time
since uncle Edward gave you a Christmas-box. Here is
one for you. Open your hand, now, if you do not wish
to offend me. Good-bye! Good-bye, my poor darling
child !" He kissed her cheeks, and then, as if reproaching
himself for an excess of leniency, he added in a more
stern accent, "I hope, Eily, that this may be the last time
I shall have to part from my niece, without being able to
tell her name."
Eily had no other answer than her tears, which, in most
instances, were the most persuasive arguments she could
employ.

"She is an affectionate creature, after all," said Father
Edward, when his niece had left the house"a simple,
affectionate, little creature; but I was in the right to be
severe with her," he added, giving himself credit for more
than he deserved; "her conduct called for some severity,
and I was in the right to exercise it as I did l'"
So saying, he returned to his chair by the fire-side, and
resumed the reading of his interrupted Office.

CHAPTER XXVI.
HOW HARDRESS CONSOLED HIMSELF DURING HIS
SEPARATION FROM EILY.
DANNY THE LORD did not, as Eily was tempted to fear,
neglect the delivery of her letter to Hardress. Night had
surprised him on his way to Mr. Cregan's cottage. A
bright crescent shed its light over the lofty Toomies, and
flung his own stunted shadow on the lime-stone road as
he trudged along, breathing now and then on his cold
fingers, and singing:
"Oh, did you not hear of Kate Kearney
Who lives on de banks of Killarney?
From de glance of her eye
Shun danger and fly,
For fatal's de glance of Kate Kearney."
He had turned in upon the road which led to Aghadoe,
and beheld at a short distance the ruined church and the
broken grave-stones which were scattered around its base.
Danny, with the caution which he had learned from his
infancy, suppressed his unhallowed song as he approached
this mournful retreat, and stepped along with a soften
pace, in order to avoid attracting the attention of any
spiritual loiterers in his neighbourhood. . The grave of
poor Dalton, the huntsman, was amongst the many which
he beheld, and Danny knew that it was generally reported
amongst the peasantry, that his ghost had been frequently

seen in the act of exercising, after death, that vocation to
which, during life, he had been so ardently attached.
Danny, who had no ambition to become a subject for the
view-halloo to his sporting acquaintance, kept on the
shady side of the road, in the hope that by this means he
might be enabled to "stale by unknownst."
Suddenly the night wind, which hurried after, bore to
his ear the sound of several voices, which imitated the
yelling of hounds in chase and the fox-hunter's cry. Danny
started aghast with terror, a heavy and turbid sensation
pressed upon his nerves, and all his limbs grew damp.
He crossed himself, and drew close to the dry stone wall
which bounded the roadside.
"Hoicks! Come!come!come away! Come away!
Hoicks 1" was shouted at the top of a voice that, one
might easily judge, had sounded the death-knell of many
a wily reynard. The cry was caught up, and echoed at
various distances by three less practised voices. The
ringing of horses' hoofs against the hard and frosty road
was the next sound that encountered the ear of the little
lord. It approached rapidly nearer, and grew too sharp
and hard to suppose that it could be occasioned by any
concussion of immaterial substances. It proved, indeed,
to be a danger of a more positive and actual kind. Our
traveller perceived, in a few minutes, that the noise pro-
ceeded from three drunken gentlemen who were returning
from a neighbouring debauch, and urging their horses
forward at the summit of their speed with shouts and
gestures, which gave them the appearance of demoniacs.
The foremost, perceiving Danny Mann, pulled up his
horse with a violent check, and the others, as they ap-
proached, imitated his example. The animals (which
were worthy of kinder masters) appeared to participate in
the intoxication of their riders. Their eyes flared, their
mouths were hid in foam, and they snorted in impatient
scorn of the delay to which they were subjected.
"Tally l' cried the first who galloped up. "'Ware
bailiff Who are you?"
"A poor man, sir, dat's going de road to"
"Hoicks | A bailiff! Come, come away I Don't I

know you, you limb of mischief? Give me out your
processes, or I'll beat you into jelly. Kneel down there
on the road until I ride over you!"
"Dat de hands may stick to me, sir, if I have a process
in de world."
"Kneel down, I say !" repeated the drunken horseman,
shaking his whip loose, and applying it several times with
all his might to the shoulders of the recusant. "Lie down
on the road until I ride over you, and trample your infernal
brains out."
"Pink him! Sweat him! Pink the rascal 1" cried another
horseman, riding rapidly up, and flourishing a naked
sword. "Put up your whip, Connolly; out with your
sword, man, and let us pink the scoundrel."
"Do as Creagh bids you, Connolly," exclaimed a third,
who was as drunk again as the other two. "Out with
your blade, and pipink the rasrascal."
There was nothing for it but a run, and Danny took to
his heels like a fawn. This measure, however, gave a new
zest to the sport. The gentlemen galloped after him with
loud shouts of "Hoicks 1" and "Tally " and overtook
him at a part of the road which was enclosed by hedges
too close and high to admit of any escape into the fields.
Knowing well the inhuman desperation with which the
gentlemen of the day were accustomed to follow up freaks
of this kind, Danny felt his heart sink as low as if he had
been pursued by a rooted enemy. While he glanced in
terror from one side to another, and saw himself cut off
from all chance of safety, he received a blow on the head
from the loaded handle of a whip, which stunned, stag-
gered, and finally laid him prostrate on the earth,
"I have him," shouted his pursuer. "Here he is, as
cool as charity. I'll trample the rascal's brains out."
So saying he reined up his horse, and endeavoured, by
every species of threat and entreaty, to make the chafed.
and fiery steed set down his iron hoof on the body of the
prostrate lord; but the animal, true to that noble instinct
which distinguishes the more generous individuals of his
species, refused to fall in with the bloody humour of his
rider. He set his feet apart, demi-vaulted to either side,

and would not, by any persuasion or sleight of horseman-
ship, be prevailed upon to injure the fallen man.
Danny, recovering from the stunning effects of the
blow, and perceiving the gentlemen hemming him round
with their swords, now sought, in an appeal to their mercy,
that security which he could not obtain by flight. He
knelt before them, lifted up his hands, and implored com-
passion in accents which would have been irresistible by
any but drunken gentlemen on a pinking frolic. But his
cries were drowned in the savage shouts of his beleaguerers.
Their swords gathered round him in a fearful circle, and
Creagh commenced operations by a thrust in the arm,
which left a gash of nearly half an inch in depth. His
companions, who did not possess the same dexterity in
the exercise of the weapon, and were nevertheless equally
free of its use, thrust so frequently, and with so much
awkwardness, that the unfortunate deformed ran a con-
siderable risk of losing his life. He had already received
several gashes in the face and limbs, and was growing
faint with pain and anxiety, when the voice of a fourth
horseman was heard at a little distance, and young
Hardress Cregan, as little self-possessed as the rest, gal-
loped into the group. He drew his small sword, flourished
it in the moon-light with a fierce halloo ! that was echoed
far away among the lakes and mountains, and prepared to
join in the fun. But one glance was sufficient to enable
him to recognise his servant.
"Connolly, hold Hold off, Creagh. Hold, or I'll
stab you !" he cried aloud, while he struck up their swords
with passion. "How dared you set upon my servant?
You are both drunk 1 go home, or I'll hash you !"
"Drunk I'" said his father, "puppuppy wha-what
do you call d-ddrunk? Ddd' you say I'm
drunk? Eh P' And he endeavoured, but without much
success, to assume a steady and dignified posture in his
saddle.
"No, sir," said Hardress, who merited his own censure
as richly as any one present; "but a-ththese two
gentlemen are."
"D'ye hear that, Creagh P" said Connolly. "Come
## p. 249 (#253) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 249
along, and show him if we're drunk. Look here, Mister
Slender-limbs I Do you see that road?"
"II do," said Hardress, who might have conscien-
tiously sworn to the seeing more than one.
"And do youlook heredo you see this horse?"
"I do," said Hardress, with some gravity of delibera,
ion.
"And do you see me?" shouted the querist.
"He raised his desperate foot -
On stirrup side, and gazed about."
"Vevery well ! You see that road, and you see my
horse, and you see me ! Vevery well. Now, could a
drunken man do this? Yo-hoicks | Come 1 come !
come away I hoicks " And so saying, he drove the
rowels into his horse's flanks, stooped forward on his seat,
and galloped away with a speed that made the night air
whistle by his ears. He was followed at an emulative
rate by Hyland Creagh and the elder Cregan.
Hardress now assisted the afflicted Danny to mount
behind him, and, putting spurs to his horse, rode after his
companions at a pace but little inferior, in point of speed,
to that which they had used.
Arrived at the cottage, he bade Danny follow him
into the drawing-room, where there was a cheerful fire.
The other gentlemen, in the meantime, had possessed
themselves of the dining-parlour, and were singing, in
astounding chorus, the melody which begins with this
verse :-
"Come! each jolly fellow
That loves to be mellow,
Attend unto me, and sit aisy;
One jorum in quiet,
My boys we will try it;
Dull thinking will make a man crazy."
The ladies, who had spent the evening out, were not
yet returned; and Hardress, much against the will of the
affrighted boatman, insisted upon Danny's taking his seat
before the fire in Mrs. Cregan's arm-chair.
"Sit down there !" he exclaimed, seizing him with
violence by the collar, and forcing him into the seat.
## p. 250 (#254) ############################################
25o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Know, fellow, that if I bid you sit on a throne, you are
fit to fill it ! You are a king, Danny!" he added, stand-
ing unsteadily before his servant, with one hand thrust
between his ample shirt frills, and the other extended in
an oratorical attitude, "you are a king in heart, though
not in birth. But, tush as Sterne says, "are we not all
relations?" Look at this hand 1 I admire you, Danny
Mann I I respect, I venerate you: I think you a respect-
able person in your class; respectable in your class; and
what more could be expected from a king? I admire, I
love you, Danny 1 You are a king in heart, though not,"
he repeated, lowering the tone of his eulogy, while he
fixed his half-closed eyes upon the deplorable figure of
the little lord, "though not in appearance."
Anybody who could contemplate Danny's person at
this moment might have boldly joined in the assertion
that he was not a "king in appearance." The poor
hunchback sat forward in the chair, in a crouching atti-
tude, half terrified, and abashed by the finery with which
he was surrounded. His joints were stiffened from the
cold, his dress sparkling with a hoar-frost, and his face
of a wretched white wherever it was not discoloured by
the clotted blood. At every noise he half started from
his seat, with the exclamation: "Tunder alive, it's de
missiz l'"
"Nancy!" Hardress said, addressing the old woman
who came to answer the bell; "Nancy, draw that table
near to the fire, there, and slip into the dining-parlour, do
you hear? and bring here the whisky, a jug of hot water,
a bowl, two glasses, and a lemon. Don't say a word to
the gentlemen: I'll take a quiet glass here in comfort
with Danny l'"
"With Danny!" exclaimed the old woman, throwing
up her hands.
"Oh, dat I mightn't sin, master, if I dare do it,"
said Danny, springing out of the chair. "I'll be kilt by
the missiz."
"Stay where you are 1" said Hardress; "and you,
woman! do as you're bid."
He was obeyed. The lord, in vain ennobled, returned

the materials in demand.

well-known hand produced a strong effect upon her
unprincipled husband. His eyelids quivered, his hand
trembled, and a black expression swept across his face.
He thrust the letter, opened but still unread, into his
waistcoat pocket, refilled his glass, and called on Danny .
for a song.
"A song, Mr. Hardress Oh! dat I may be happy
if I'd raise my voice in dis room for all Europe 1"
"Sit in that chair, and sing !" exclaimed Hardress,
-clenching his hand, and extending it towards the recusant,
"or I'll pin you to that door l''
Thus enforced, the rueful Danny returned to the chair
which he had once more deserted, and after clearing his
throat by a fresh appeal to the glass, he sang a little
melody which may yet be heard at evening in the
western villages. Hardress was enchanted with the air,
the words, and the style of the singer. He made Danny
repeat it until he became hoarse, and assisted to bear
the burthen himself with more of noise than good taste
or correctness. The little lord, as he dived deeper
into the bowl, began to lose his self-restraint, and to
forget the novelty of his situation. He rivalled his
master in noise and volubility, and no longer showed
the least reluctance or timidity, when commanded to
chaunt out the favourite lay for the seventh time at
least:-

"Well why do you stop? What do you stare at?"
Hardress asked, perceiving the vocalist suddenly lower

his voice, and slink away from the table, while his eyes.
were fixed on the farther end of the room. The
Collegian looked in the same direction, and beheld the
figure of a young female, in a ball dress of unusual splen-
dour, standing as if fixed in astonishment. , Her black
hair, which was decorated with one small sprig of pearls,
hung loose around her head, a necklace of the same
costly material rested on her bosom, and was, in part,.
concealed by the bright-coloured silk handkerchief which
was drawn around her shoulders.
On one arm she held the fur-trimmed cloak and heavy
shawl which she had just removed from her person, and
which were indicative of a recent exposure to the frosty
air. Indeed, nothing but the uproarious mirth of the
ill-assorted revellers could have prevented their hearing
the wheels of the carriage as they grated along the
gravel-plat before the hall door. This venerable vehicle
was sent to set the ladies down by the positive desire of
the hostess, and Mrs. Cregan accepted it in preference to:
her own open curricle, although she knew that a more
crazy mode of conveyance could not be found, even
among the ships marked with the very last letter on Lloyd's
list.
Recognising his cousin, Hardress endeavoured to
assume towards Danny Mann an air of dignified con-
descension and maudlin majesty, which formed a ludi-
crous contrast to the convivial freedom of his manner a
few months before.
"Very well, my man," he said, liquefying the con-
sonants in every word. "Go out now, go to the kitchen,
and I'll hear the remainder of your story in the morn-
ing."
nny fell cunningly into the deception of his master,
to whom he now evinced a profundity of respect, as if to
banish the idea of equality, which the foregoing scene:
might have suggested.
*Iss, plase your honour!" he said, bowing repeatedly
down to his knees, and brushing his hat back until it
swept the floor. "Long life an' glory to your honour,
Master Hardress, an''tis I dat would be lost if it wasn't.

for your goodness. Oh, murder, murder 1" he added to
himself, as he scoured out of the room, describing a
wide circuit to avoid Miss Chute, "I'll be fairly flayed
alive on de 'count of it."
"Well, Anne?" said Hardress, rising and moving
towards her with some unsteadiness of gait. "II am
glad to see you, Anne; we're just come home; very
pleasant night; pleasant fellows, very, very pleasant
fellows; some capcapital songs; I was wishing for
you, Anne. Had you a pleasant night where you were P
Who who did you dance with ? Come, Anne, we'll
dance a minuetminminuet de la cour."
"Excuse me," said Anne, coldly, as she turned towards
the door, "not at this hour, certainly."
"A fig for the hour, Anne. Hours were made for
slaves. Anne, oh, Anne | you look beautifulbeautiful
to-night ! Oh, Anne ! Time flies, youth fades, and age,
with slow and withering pace, comes on, before we hear
his footfall !" Here he sang, in a loud but broken
voice:
"Then, follow, follow,
Follow, follow,
Follow, follow pleasure!
There's no drinking in the grave."
Oh, Anne! that's as true as if the Stagyrite had penned it.
Worms, Anne, worms and silence I Come, one minuet !
Lay by your cloak
"And follow, follow,
Follow, follow,
Follow, follow pleasure 1
There's no dancing in the grave."
"Let me pass, if you please," said Miss Chute, still
zold and lofty, while she endeavoured to get to the door.
"Not awhile, Anne," replied Hardress, catching her
-hand.
"Stand back, sir," exclaimed the offended girl, drawing
up her person into the attitude of a Minerva, while her
forehead glowed, and her eye flashed with indignation.
"If you forget yourself, do not suppose that I am inclined
Ato commit the same oversight." Saying this, she walked
## p. 255 (#259) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 255
out of the room with the air of an offended princess,
leaving Hardress a little struck and sobered by the sudden
change in her manner.
Lifting up his eyes after a pause of some moments, he
beheld his mother standing near, and looking on him with
an eye in which the loftiness of maternal rebuke was
mingled with an expression of sneering and satirical
reproach.
"You are a wise young gentleman," she said; "you
have done well. Fool that you are you have destroyed
yourself." Without bestowing another word upon him.
Mrs. Cregan took one of the candles in her hand, and left
the room.
Hardress had sufficient recollection to follow her
example. He took the other light, and endeavoured, but
with many errors, to navigate his way towards the door.
"Destroyed myself?" he said, as he proceeded. "Why,
where's the mighty harm of taking a cheerful glass on a
winter's night with a friend? A friend, Hardress? Yes,
a friend, but what friend? Danny Mann, alias Danny
the Lord, my boatman. It won't do | [shaking his head].
It sounds badly. I'm afraid I did something to offend
Anne Chute. "I am sorry for it, because I respect her;
I respect you, Anne, in my very, very heart. But I am
ill-used, and I ought to have satisfaction; Creagh has
pinked my boatman. I'll send him a message, that's
clear; I'll not be hiring boatmen for him to be pinking
for his amusement. Let him pink their master if he can.
That's the chat [snapping his fingers]. Danny Mann
costs me twelve pounds a year, besides his feeding and
clothing, and I'll not have him pinked by old Hyland
Creagh afterwards. Pink me, if he can; let him leave
my boatman alone ! That's the chat I This floor goes
starboard and larboard, up and down, like the poop of a
ship; up andHallo! Who are you? Oh! it's only
the door. I have broken my nose against it. And if I
break my own nose without any reason, at this time o' the
day, what usage can I expect from Creagh or any body
else?"
Having arrived at this wise conclusion, he sallied out
## p. 256 (#260) ############################################
256 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
of the room, rubbing with one hand the bridge of the
afflicted feature, and elevating in the other the light,
which he still held with a most retentive grasp. As the
long and narrow hall, which lay between him and his
bed-chamber, formed a direct railroad way, which it was
impossible even for a drunken man to miss, he reached
the little dormitory without further accident. The other
gentlemen had been already borne away unresisting from
the parlour, and transmitted from the arms of Mike to
those of Morpheus.

CHAPTER XXVII.
HOW HARDRESS ANSWERED THE LETTER OF EILY.
"You have destroyed yourself?" Mrs. Cregan repeated
on the following morning, as she sat in the breakfast-
parlour in angry communication with our Collegian. "If
you have any desire to redeem even a portion of her
forfeited esteem, now is your time. She is sitting alone
in the drawingroom, and I have prevailed on her to see
you for a few moments. She returns in two or three days
to Castle Chute, where she is to spend Christmas; and
unless you are able to make your peace before her depar-
ture, I know not how long the war may last."
"Yes," said Hardress, with a look of deep anguish
"I shall go and meet her on the spot where I dared to
insult her Insult Anne Chute Why, if my brain had
turned, if lunacy instead of drunkenness had set a blind
upon my reason at the time, I thought my heart at least
would have directed me. Mother, don't ask me to see her
there; I could tear my very flesh for anger; I never will
forgive myself, and how then can I seek forgiveness from
her P"
"Go, go! That speech might have done much for
you, if it had been properly addressed. Go to her."
"I will !" said Hardress, setting his teeth, and rising
with a look of forced resolution. "I know that it is
## p. 257 (#261) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 257
merely a courting of ruin, a hastening and confirming of
my own black destiny, and yet I will go seek her. I can-
iot describe to you the sensation that attracts my feet at
:his moment in the direction of the drawing-room. There
is a demon leading and a demon driving me on, and I
know them well and plainly, and yet I will not choose but
o. The way is torture, and the end is hell, and I know
it, and I go ! And there is one sweet spirit, one tremb-
ling, pitying angel, that waves me back with its pale, fair
ds, and strives to frown in its kindness, and points
that way to the hills I Mother 1 mother I the day may
come when you will wish a burning brand had seared
those lips athwart before they said"Go to her l'"
"What do you mean?" said Mrs. Cregan, with some
indignant surprise.
"Well, well, am I not going? Do I not say, I go P"
continued Hardress. "Is it not enough if I comply?
May I not talk? May I not rant a little? My heart will
burst if I do these things in silence."
"Come, Hardress, you are far too sensitive a lover"
"A what?" cried Hardress, springing to his feet, and
with a fierceness of tone and look that made his mother
Start.
"Pooh ! A cousin, then; a good, kind cousin; but
too sensitive."
"Yes, yes!" muttered Hardress; "I am not yet damned.
The sentence is above my head, but it is not spoken;
the scarlet sin is willed, but not recorded. Mother, have
patience with me! I will not, I cannot, I dare not, see
Anne Chute this morning." And he again sunk into his
chair.
Mrs. Cregan, who attributed all those manifestations of
reluctance and remorse which her son had evinced during
their frequent interviews, to the recollection of some
broken promise or boyish faith forsaken, was now sur-
prised at their intensity.
"My dear Hardress " she said, laying her hand affec-
tionately on his shoulder"my darling child l you afflict
yourself too earnestly. Say what you will, there are few
natures nursed in an Irish cabin, that are capable of
R

suffering so keenly the endurance of any disappointment
as you do the inflicting it !"
"Do you think so, mother?"
"Be assured of it. And again why do you vex your
mind about this interview P Is it not a simple matter for
a gentleman to apologise politely to a lady for an uninten-
tional affront ? If you have hurt your cousin's feelings,
what crime can accompany or follow a plain and gentle-
manly apology?"
"That's true, that's very true," said Hardress. "There
is a call upon me, and I will obey it. But politely?
Politely . If I could stop at that. It is impossible; I
shall first become a fool, and, by-and-bye, a demon. But
you are right, and I obey you, mother."
So saying, he walked with a kind of desperate calmness
out of the room, and Mrs. Cregan heard him continue
the same heavy, self-abandoned step along the hall which
led to the drawing-room door.
Nothing could have been more propitiatory than the
air of mournful tranquillity with which the young collegian
entered the room in which his cousin was expecting him.
It might resemble that of a believing Mussulman, who
prepared to encounter a predestined sorrow. He observed,
and his pulse quickened at the sight, that his cousin's
eyes were marked with a slight circle of red, as if she had
been weeping. She rose as he entered, and lowered her
head and her person in rather distant courtesy, a coldness
which she repented the moment her eye rested on his pale
and anxious countenance.
"You see how totally all shame has left me," said
Hardress, forcing a smile; "I do not even hide myself.
Will any apology, Anne, be admissible after last night?"
Miss Chute hesitated, and appeared slightly confused.
She did not, she said, for her own sake, look for any; but
it would, indeed, give her pleasure to hear anything that
might explain the extraordinary scene on which she had
intruded.
"You are astonished," said Hardress, "to find that I
could make myself so much a beast? But intoxication is
not always a voluntary sin with people who sit down after
## p. 259 (#263) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 259
dinner with such men as Creagh, and Connolly, and"
he did not add, "my father."
"But when you were aware
"And when I was, and as I was, Anne, I rose and left
the tableI and young Geoghegan; but they all got up
to a man, and shut the door, and swore we should not
stir. They went so far as to draw their swords. Upon
my honour, I do not think we could have left the room
last night sober without bloodshed. And was it so un-
pardonable, then? Cato, himself, you know, was once
found drunk."
"Yes, once."
"I don't think that's deserved," said Hardress, colour-
ing slightly; "I may have often trespassed a little in that
way, but I never, till last night, became as drunk as Cato.
Nor even last night; for I was able to ride home at a
canter, to rescue my poor hunchback out of a dilemma,
and to bring him hither on my saddle; whereas, Cato was
unable to keep his own legs, you know."
"I heard that circumstance this morning, and I admit
that it altered the posture of the transaction very consi-
derably. But did those gentlemen who drew their swords
upon you make you promise to continue drinking after
your return, and to bring Danny into the drawing-room
to join you?"
"And to insult my cousin?" added Hardress. "No;
there my guilt begins, and unless your mercy steps into
my relief, I must bear the burden unassisted."
"To tell you the truth, Hardress," said Anne, assuming
an air of greater frankness, "it is not the offence or insult,
as you term it, of last night alone that perplexes and
afflicts me. Your whole manner, for a long time past, is
one continued enigmaone distressing series of miscon-
ceptions on my part, and of inconsistenciesI will say
nothing harderupon yours. Your whole conduct has
changed since I have met you here, and changed by no
means favourably. I cannot understand you. I appear
to give you pain most frequently when it is farthest from
my own intention, and I cannot tell you how distressed I
feel upon the subject."
## p. 260 (#264) ############################################
26o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Hardress fixed his eyes upon her while she spoke, and
remained for some moments wrapped in silent and in-
toxicating admiration. When she had concluded, and
while a gentle anxiety still shadowed her features with an
additional depth of interest, he approached her and said:
"And is it possible, Anne, that the conduct of so worth-
less a fellow as I am should in any way affect you so
deeply as you describe P Believe me, Anne, I do not
mouth or rave, while I declare to you, that I had rather
lie down and die here at your feet, than give you a mo-
ment's painful thought, or seem to disregard your feelings."
"Oh, sir," said Anne, looking more offended than
usual, "I cannot sit to hear this language again repeated.
You must remember how painfully those conversations
have always terminated."
The intoxication of passion is not less absorbing and
absolute than that which arises out of coarser sensual in-
dulgence. Hardress was no more capable of thought or
of reflection now, than he was during the excesses of the
foregoing night. He yielded himself slowly, but surely,
to the growing delirium, and became forgetful of every-
thing but the unspeakable happiness that seemed to
thrust itself upon him.
"Anne," he said, with great anxiety of voice and
manner, "let that too be made a subject for your forgive-
ness. Shall I tell you a secret? Shall I give you the
key to all those perplexing inconsistenciesthe solution
to that enigma of which you have complained? I can no
more contain it than I could arrest a torrent. I love you!
Does that explain it? If you are satisfied, do not conceal
your thoughts. Say it kindlysay it generously? I do
not ask you to say anything that can even make you
blush. If you are not displeased, say only that you forgive
me, and that word will be the token of my happiness."
He paused, and Anne Chute, turning away her head,
and reaching her hand, said in a low, but distinct tone:
"Hardress, I am satisfiedI do forgive you."
Hardress sunk at her feet, and bathed with his tears
the hand which had been surrendered to him. "One
moment! one moment's patience, my kindest, my sweetest

Anne " he said, as a sudden thought started into his
mind: "I wish to send one line to my mother; is it your
your pleasure? She is in the next room, and I wish to
Ha I'"
A sudden alteration took place in his appearance.
While he spoke of writing, he had taken from his waist-
coat pocket a pencil and an open letter, from which he
tore away a portion of the back. The handwriting arrested
his attention, and he looked within. The first words that
met his eyes were the following:
"If Eily has done anything to offend you, come and
tell her so; but remember she is now away from every
friend in the whole world. Even if you are still in the
same mind as when you left me, come, at all events, for
once, and let me go back to my father."
Whilst his eyes wandered over this letter, his figure
underwent an alteration that filled the heart of Anne with
terror. The apparition of the murdered Banquo at the
festival could not have shot a fiercer remorse into the soul
of his slayer, than did those simple lines into the heart of
Hardress. He held the paper before him at arm's length,
his cheek grew white, his forehead grew damp, and the
sinews of his limbs grew faint and quivering with fear.
His uneasiness was increased by his total ignorance of the
manner in which the letter came into his possession.
"Hardress I what is the matter? What is it you
tremble at?" said Anne, in great uneasiness.
"I do not know, Anne. I think there's witchcraft
here. I am doomed, I think, to live a charmed life. I
never yet imagined that I was on the threshold of happi-
ness, but some wild hurry, some darkening change, swept
across the prospect, and made it all a dream. It has
been always soin my least as in my highest hopes. I
think it is my doom. Even now, I thought I had already
entered upon its free enjoyment, and behold, yourself,
how swiftly has it vanished l'"
"Vanished 1"
"Ay, vanished, and for ever ! Were we not now
almost one soul and being? Did we not mingle sighs 7
Did we not mingle tears? Was not your hand in mine,

262 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
and did I not think I felt our spirits growing together in
an inseparable league P And now (be witness for me
against my destiny), how suddenly we have been wrenched
asunder 1 how soon a gulf has opened at our feet, to sepa-
rate our hearts and fortunes from henceforth and for
ever!"
"For ever !" echoed Anne, lost in perplexity and
astonishment.
"Forgive me !" Hardress continued in a dreary tone.
"I did but nock you, Anne; I cannotI must not love
you ! I am called away; I was mad, and dreamed a
lunatic's dream; but a horrid voice has awoke me up, and
warned me to be gone. I can never be the happy one I
hopedAnne Chute's accepted lover."
"Yet once again, sir!" exclaimed Miss Chute, with a
burst of natural indignation, "once more must I endure
those insults I Do you think I am made of marble? Do
you think," she continued," panting heavily, "that you can
sport with my feelings at your pleasure ?"
"I can only say, forgive me !"
"I do not think you value my forgiveness I have
been always too ready to accord it, and that, I think,
has subjected me to additional insult. Oh! Mrs.
Cregan l" she added, as she saw that lady enter the
room, and close the door carefully behind her"why
did you bring me to this house?" With these words she
ran, as if for refuge, to the arms of her aunt, and fell in a
fit of hysterical weeping upon her neck.
"What is the matter?" said Mrs. Cregan sternly, and
standing at her full height. "What have you done?"
"I have, in one breath, made her a proposal, which I
have broken in the next," said Hardress calmly.
"You do well to boast of it. Comfort yourself, my
love, you shall have justice. Now, hear me, sir. Aban-
don my house this instant l"
* Mother"
"Be silent, sir, and dare not address me by that name.
My love, be comforted I disown, I renounce you for a
son of mine. If you had one drop of gentle blood in your
veins, it would have rebelled against such perfidy, such
## p. 263 (#267) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 263
inhuman villany as this Away, sir! your presence is
distressing to us both ! My love! my love! my unoffend-
ing love! be comforted l'" she added, gathering her niece
tenderly in her arms, and pressing her head against her
bosom.
"Mother," said Hardress, drawing in his breath between
his teeth, "if you are wise you will not urge me farther.
Your power is great upon me: if you are merciful, exer-
cise it not at this moment."
"Do not, aunt l" said Anne, in a whisper; "let him
do nothing against his own desire."
"He shall do it, girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Cregan. "Must
the selfish boy suppose that there are no feelings to be
consulted besides his own in the world? I will not speak
for myself," she added, "but look there!" holding towards
him the form of her niece as if in reproach. "Is there a
man on earth besides yourself that" here the words
stuck in her throat, and her eyes filled up. "Excuse me,
my darling !" she said to Anne; "I must sit down.
This monster will kill me !" She burst into tears as she
spoke those words.
It now became Anne's turn to assume the office of
comforter. She stood by her aunt's chair, with her arm
round her neck, and loading her with caresses. If ever
a man felt like a fiend, Hardress Cregan did so at that
moment.
"I am a villain either way," he muttered below his
breath. "There is no escaping it. Well whispered,
fiend l I have but a choice between the two modes of
evil, and there is no resisting this! I cannot hold out
against this "
"Come, Anne," said Mrs. Cregan, rising, "let us look
for privacy elsewhere, since this gentleman loves so well
to feast his eyes upon the misery he can occasion that he
will not afford it to us here."
"Stay, mother," said Hardress, suddenly rising and
walking towards them, "I have decided between them."
"Between what?"
"II mean that I am ready to obey you. I am ready,
if Anne will forgive me, to fulfil my pledge. I ask her
## p. 264 (#268) ############################################
264 THE COLLEEN BAWN,
pardon and yours for the distress I have occasioned.
From this moment I will offend no more. Your power,
mother, has prevailed. Whether for good or evil, let time
tell I'"
"But will you hold to this?"
"To death, and after. Surely that may answer."
"No more discoveries."
"None, mother, none."
"This, once for all, and at every hazard?"
"Yes; and at every expense to soul or to body, here or
hereafter."
"Fie! fiel Why need you use those desperate terms?
Where are you running to now P"
"Merely to speak to my servant. I will return to
dinner."
"Why, how you tremble? You are pale and ill "
"No, no; 'tis nothing. The air will take it away
Good bye; one moment; I will return to dinner."
He hurried out of the room, leaving the ladies to specu-
late together on the probable cause of his vacillation.
What appeared most perplexing to Anne Chute was the
circumstance that she knew he loved her as deeply and as
intensely as he said, and yet her admitting his addresses
always seemed to occasion a feeling of terror in his mind.
More than once, as his character unfolded on her view, she
had been tempted to regrether hasty predilection, and had
recurred, with a feeling of saddened recollection, to the
quiet tenderness and cheerful affection of the rejected
Kyrle Daly.
In the meantime, Hardress Cregan hurried through
the house in search of his boatman. Danny's wounds
had become inflamed in the course of the night, and he
was now lying in a feverish state in the little green-room
in which Hardress had his last interview with the poor
huntsman. Hither he hastened, with a greater turbu-
.ence of mind than he had ever yet experienced. "They
are driving me upon it !" he muttered between his teeth.
"They are gathering upon me, and urging me onward in
my own despite 1. Why, then, have at ye, devils. I am
among ye. Which way must it be done? Heaven

g I may not one day weep for this! but I am scourged
O it
He entered the room. The check blind was drawn
across the little window, and he could scarcely for a
moment distinguish the face of his servant, as the latter
raised himself in the bed at his approach. Old Nancy
was standing, with a bowl of whey in her hand, near the
bedside. Hardress, as if unwilling to afford a moment's
time for reflection, walked quickly to her, seized her by
the shoulders, and thrust her out of the room. He then
threw in the bolt of the door, and took a chair by the
sick man's side. A silence of some moments ensued.
"Long life to you, Master Hardress; 'tis kind o' you
to come and see me dis mornin'," said the wounded lord.
His master made no reply, but remained for a minute
with his elbows on his knees, and his face buried in his
hands.
"Danny," he said, at length, "do you remember a con-
versation which I had with you some weeks since on the
Purple Mountain?"
"Oh! den, master," said Danny, putting his hands
together with a beseeching look"don't talk o' dat any
more. I ax Heaven's pardon, an' I ax your pardon for
what I said; and I hope and pray your honour 'ill tink of
it no more. Many is de time I was sorry for it since, and
moreover now, being on my sick bed, and tinkin' of every
ting."
"Pooh! you do not understand me. Do you remem-
ber your saying something about hiring a passage for Eily
in an American vessel, and"
"I do, an' I ax pardon. Let me out o' de bed, an' I'll
go down on my two knees"
"Pish! bah! be silent! When you spoke of that, 1
was not wise enough to judge correctly. Do you mark?
If that conversation were to pass again, I would not
speak, nor think, nor feel as I did then."
Danny gaped and stared on him as if at a loss,
"Look here lyou asked me for a token of my appro-
bation. Do you remember it? You bade me draw my
glove from off my hand, and give it for a warrant.
## p. 266 (#270) ############################################
266 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Danny," he continued, plucking off the glove slowly, fin-
ger after finger, "my mind has altered. I married too
young. I didn't know my own mind. Your words were
wiser than I thought. I am hampered in my will. I am
burning with this thraldom. Here is my glove." Danny
received it, while they exchanged a look of cold and fatal
intelligence.
"You shall have money," Hardress continued, throw-
ing a purse upon the bed. "My wish is this. She must
not live in Ireland. Take her to her father? No; the
old man would babble, and all would come to light.
Three thousand miles of a roaring ocean may be a better
security for silence. She could not keep her secret at
her father's. She would murmur it in her dreams. I
have heard her do it. She must not stay in Ireland.
And you, do you go with herwatch hermark all her
words, her wishes. I will find you money enough ; and
never let me see her more. Harm not, I sayoh, harm
not a hair of the poor wretch's head never let me see
her more. Do you hear? Do you agree ?"
"Oh, den, I'd do more dan dat for your honour;
but 2x
"Enough. When?when, then?when?"
"Ah, den, Master Hardress, dear knows; I'm so
poorly after de proddin' I got from dem jentlemen, dat
I don't know will I be able to lay dis for a few days, I'm
tinkin'."
"Well, when you go, here is your warrant."
He tore the back from Eily's letter, and wrote in
anSWer:
"I am still in the same mind as when I left you. I
accept your proposal. Put yourself under the bearer's
care, and he will restore you to your father."
He placed this black lie in the hand of his retainer,
and left the room.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
HOW THE LITTLE LORD PUT HIS MASTER's WISHES
INTO ACTION.
WE lost sight of Eily after her parting with her uncle.
She wasted no time on her journey homewards, but yet
it was nearly dusk before the pony had turned in upon
the little craggy road which led upward through the Gap.
The evening was calm and frosty, and every footfall of
the animal was echoed from the opposite cliffs like the
stroke of a hammer. A broken covering of crystal was
thrown across the stream that bubbled downwards through
the wild valley; and the rocks and leafless trees, in those
corners of the glen which had escaped the direct influence
of the sunshine, were covered with drooping spars of ice.
Chilled by the nipping air, and fearful of attracting the
attention of any occasional straggler in the wild, Eily had
drawn her blue cloak around her face, and was proceeding
quietly in the direction of the cottage, when the sound of
voices on the other side of a hedge, by which she passed,
struck on her ear. -
"Seven pound tin, an' a pint o' whisky the same
money as I had for the dead match of her from Father
O'Connor, the priest, eastwards in Castle Island. Say the
word nowseven pound tin, or lave it there."
"Seven pound."
"No; seven pound tin."
"I will not, I tell you."
"Well, then, being relations, as we are, I never will
break your word, although she's worth that, if it was
between brothers."
In her first start of surprise, at hearing this well-
remembered voice, Eily had dropped the mantle from her
face. Before she could resume it, the last speaker had
sprang up on the hedge, and plainly encountered her.
## p. 268 (#272) ############################################
268 the COLLEEN BAWN.
At this momentfar away from home, forsaken, as it
appeared, by her chosen, her own accepted love, living all
alone in heart, and without even the feverish happiness of
hope itselfat this mournful moment it would be difficult
to convey any idea of the effect which was produced upon
Eily by the sudden apparition of the first, though not the
favoured, love of her girlish days. Both came simulta-
neously to a pause, and both remained gazing each on the
other's face with a feeling too sudden and too full for
immediate expression. The handsome, though no longer
healthy, countenance of the mountaineer was expanded
to a stare of pleasurable astonishment, while that of Eily
was covered with an appearance of shame, sorrow, and
perplexity. The pony, likewise, drooping his head as she
suffered the rein to slacken in her hand, seemed to parti-
cipate in her confusion.
At length, Myles of the Ponies, keeping his eyes still
fixed on Eily, advanced towards her, step after step, with
the breathless suspense of King Leontes before the feigned
statue. "Eily l' he said at length, laying one hand upon
the shaggy neck of the little animal, and placing the other
against his throat, to keep down the passion which he felt
gathering within, "Oh, Eily O'Connor! is it you I See at
last P"
Eily, with her eyes lowered, replied in a whisper, which
was all but utterly inaudible, "'Tis, Myles."
A long pause ensued. The poor mountaineer bent
down his head in a degree of emotion which it would be
difficult to describe, otherwise than by adverting to the
causes in which it originated. He was Eily's first
declared admirer, and he was the cause of her present
exile from her father's fire-side. He had the roughness,
but at the same time the honesty, of a mountain
cottager; and he possessed a nature which was capable
of being deeply, if not acutely, impressed by the circum-
stances just mentioned. It was long, therefore, before
he could renew the conversation. At last he looked up
and said:
"Why, then, when you were below at the lake, where
I seen you, although I couldn't see a bit o' you but the

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 269
cloak, I wondhered greatly what is it made me feel so
quare in myself. Sure it's little notion I had who was
in it for a cloak. Little I thought[here he passed his
hand across his eyes]. Ah, what's the use o' talking?"
Eily was still unable to articulate a syllable.
"I saw the old man last week," continued Myles,
"still at the old work on the rope-walk."
"Did youspeak to him?" whispered Eily.
. "No. He gave me great anger (and justly), the next
time he saw me afther you going, in regard it was on my
account, he said (and justly too), that you were driven to
do as you had done. Oh! then, Miss Eily, why did you
do that? Why didn't you come to me unknownst to the
old man, and says you, 'Myles, I make it my request o'
you, you won't ax me any more, for I can't have you at
all'? And sure, if my heart was to split open that
minute, it's the last word you'd ever hear from Myles."
"There is only one person to blame in all this busi-
ness," murmured the unhappy girl, "and that is Eily
O'Connor."
"I don't say that," returned the mountaineer. "It's
no admiration to me you should be heart-broken with all
the persecution we gave you day after day. All I'm
thinking is, I'm sorry you didn't mention it to myself
unknownst. Sure it would be betther for me than to be
as I was afther when I heerd you were gone. Lowry
Looby told me first of it, when I was eastwards. Oh,
vo I such a life as I led afther | Lonesome as the moun-
tains looked before, when I used to come home thinkin'
of you, they looked ten times lonesomer afther I heerd
that story. The ponies, poor crathurs, see 'em all, how
iney're lookin' down at us this moment, they didn't hear
me spring the rattle on the mountain for a month afther.
I suppose they thought it is in Garryowen I was."
Here he looked upward, and pointed to his herd, a
great number of which were collected in groups on the
broken cliffs above the road, some standing so far forward
on the projections of rock, as to appear magnified against
the dusky sky. Myles sprung the large wooden rattle
which he held in his hand, and in an instant all dispersed

27o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
and disappeared like the clan of a Highland chief at the
sound of their leader's whistle. -
"Well, Myles," said Eily at length, collecting a little
strength, "I hope we'll see some happy days in Garry-
owen yet."
"Heaven send it. I'll pack off the boy to-night to
town, or I'll go myself if you like, or I'll get you a horse
and truckle, and guide it myself for you, or I'll do any-
thing in the whole world that you'll have me. Look at
this. I'd rather be doing your bidding this moment than
my own mother's, and Heaven forgive me if that's a sin.
Ah! Eily, they may say this and that o' you, in the place
where you were born, but I'll ever hold to it, I held to it
all through, an' I'll hold to it to my death, that when you
darken your father's door again, you will send no shame
before you !"
"You are right in that, Myles."
"Didn't I know I was? And wasn't it that that broke
my heart? Look! If one met me after you flitted away,
an' saw me walking the road with my hands in my pocket,
and my head down, an' I thinking; an' if he sthruck me
on the shoulder, an' 'Myles,' says he, "don't grieve for
her, she's this an' that l' and if he proved it to me, why,
I'd look up that minute an' I'd smile in his face. I'd be
as easy from that hour as if I never crossed your threshold
at Garryowen But knowing in my heart, and as my
heart told me, that it never could be that way, that Eily
was still the old girl always, an' hearing what they said o'
you, an' knowing that it was I that brought it all upon
you Oh, Eily Eily Oh ! Eily O'Connor, there
is not that man upon Ireland ground that can tell what I
felt. That was what kilt me ! That was what drove the
pain into my heart, and kept me in the doctor's hands
till now."
"Were you ill, then, Myles?" Eily asked in a tone of
greater tenderness and interest than she had ever shown
to this faithful lover. He seemed to feel it too; for he
turned away his head and did not answer for some
moments."
"Nothing to speak of," he said at length; "nothing,
## p. 271 (#275) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 271
Eily, that couldn't be cured by a kind word or a look o'
that kind. But where are you going now? The night
is falling, and this is a lonesome road. The Sowlthe was
seen upon the Black Lake last week, and few are fond of
crossing the little bridge at dark since then."
"I am not afraid," said Eily.
"Are you going far a-past the Gap P Let me guide
the pony for you."
"No, Myles; where I am going, I must go alone."
"Alone? Sure 'tisn't to part me you will, now?"
"I must, indeed, Myles."
"And what will I say to the old man, when I go and
tell him that I saw Eily, an'spoke to her, an' that I know
no more P"
"Tell him, if you like, that Eily is sorry for the trouble
she gave him, and that before many days she hopes to ask
his pardon on her knees. Good night, and Heaven be
with you. Myles, you are a good man."
"An amn't I to know where you stop itself?"
"Not now. You said, Myles, that you would like to
do my bidding. My bidding is now that you would
neither ask, nor look after, where I'm going, nor where
I stop. If you do either one or the other, you will do me
a great injury."
"Say no more, a-chree " said Myles; "the word is
enough. Well, Eily, good night! your own good night
back again to you, and may the angels guide you on your
road. Cover up your hands in your cloak, an' hide your
face from the frost. I do your bidding, but I don't like
the look o' you that way, going up this lonesome glen
alone, an' a winter night coming on, an' not knowing
where you're steering, or who you're trusting to. Eily,
be said by me, and let me go with you."
Eily again refused, and gave her hand to Myles, who
grasped it between his, and seemed as loth to part with it
as if it were a treasure of gold. At length, however,
Eily disengaged herself, and put her pony to a trot. The
mountaineer remained gazing after her until her figure
was lost among the shadows of the rocks. He then
turned on his path, and pursued the road which led down
## p. 272 (#276) ############################################
272 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
the valley, with his eyes fixed heavily upon the ground,
and his head sunk forward in an excess of deep and
singular emotion. Eily, meanwhile, pursued her journey
to the cottage, where, as the reader is aware, no news of
her forgetful husband had as yet been heard. Some
Jays of painful suspense and solitude elapsed, and then
came Danny Mann with his young master's note.
It was the eve of Little Christmas, and Eily was seated
by the fire, still listening, with the anxiety of deferred
hope, to every sound that approached the cottage door.
She held in her hand a small prayer-book, in which she
was reading, from time to time, the office of the day. The
sins and negligences of the courted maiden and the happy
bride came now in dread array before the memory of the
forsaken wife, and she leaned forward with her cheek
supported by one finger, to contemplate the long arrear
in silent penitence. They were, for the most part, such
transgressions as might, in a more worldly soul, be con-
sidered indicative of innocence rather than hopeless guilt;
but Eily's was a young and tender conscience, that bore
the burthen with reluctance and with difficulty.
Poll Naughten was arranging at a small table the three-
branched candle with which the vigil of this festival is
celebrated in Catholic houses. While she was so oc-
cupied, a shadow fell upon the threshold, and Eily
started from her chair. It was that of Danny Mann.
She looked for a second figure, but it did not appear, and
she returned to her chair with a look of agony and dis-
appointment.
"Where's your masther? Isn't he coming?" asked
Poll, while she applied a lighted rush to one of the
branches of the candle.
"He isn't," returned Danny; "he has something else
to do."
He approached Eily, who observed, as he handed her
the note, that he looked more pale than usual, and that
his eyes quivered with an uncertain and gloomy fire.
She cast her eyes on the note, in the hope of finding
there a refuge from the fears which crowded in upon her;
but it came only to confirm them in all their gloomy
## p. 273 (#277) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 273
force. She read it word after word, and then, letting her
hand fall lifeless by her side, she leaned back against the
wall in an attitude of utter desolation. Danny avoided
contemplating her in this condition, and stooped forward,
with his hands expanded over the fire. The whole took
place in silence so complete, that Poll was not yet aware
of the transaction, and had not even looked on Eily.
Again she raised the paper to her eyes, and again she
read in the same well-known hand, to which her pulses
had so often thrilled and quickened, the same unkind,
cold, heartless, loveless words.
She thought of the first time on which she had met
with Hardress; she remembered the warmth, the tender-
ness, the respectful zeal of his young and early attach-
ment; she recalled his favourite phrases of affection;
and again she looked upon this unfeeling scrawl, and the
contrast almost broke her heart. She thought that if he
were determined to renounce her, he might at least have
come and spoken a word at parting, even if he had used
the same violence as in their last interview. His utmost
harshness would be kinder than indifference like this.
It was an irremediable affliction, one of those frightful
visitations, from the effects of which a feeble and
unelastic character like this unhappy girl can never be
recovered.
But though the character of Eily was, as we have
termed it, unelastic; though, when once bowed down by
a calamitous pressure, her spirits would not recoil, but
took the drooping form, and retained it even after that
pressure was removed; still she possessed a heroism
peculiar to herselfthe noblest of which humanity is
capablethe heroism of endurance. The time had now
arrived for the exercise of that faculty of silent sufferance
of which she had made her gentle boast to Hardress. She
saw now that complaint would be in vain, that Hardress
loved her not, that she was dead in his affections, and
that, although she might disturb the quiet of her husband,
she never could restore her own. She determined, there-
fore, to obey him at once, and without a murmur. She
thought that Hardress's unkindness had its origin in a
S

islike to her, and did not at all imagine the possibility
of his proceeding to such a degree of perfidy as he, in
point of fact, contemplated. Had she done so, she
would not have agreed to maintain the secrecy which she
had promised.
While this train of meditation was still passing in her
mind, Danny Mann advanced towards the place where
she was standing, and said, without raising his eyes from
her feet:
"If you're agreeable to do what's in dat paper, Miss
Eily, I have a boy below at de Gap wid a horse and car,
an' you can set off to-night if you like."
Eily, as if yielding to a mechanical impulse, glided into
the little room, which, during the honeymoon, had been
furnished up and decorated for her own use. She
restrained her eyes from wandering as much as possible,
and commenced, with hurried and trembling hands, her
arrangements for departure. They were few and speedily
effected. Her apparel was folded into her trunk, and for
once she tied on her bonnet and cloak without referring
to the glass. It was all over now ! It was a happy
dream, but it was ended. Not a tear fell, not a sigh
escaped her lips, during the course of those farewell
occupations. The struggle was deep and terrible, but it
was firmly mastered. A few minutes only elapsed before
she again appeared at the door of the little chamber,
accoutred for the journey.
"Danny," she said, in a faint, small voice, "I am
ready."
"Ready?" exclaimed Poll. "Is it going you are,
a-chree ?"
Nothing could be more dangerous to Eily's firmness at
this moment than any sound of commiseration or kind-
ness. She felt the difficulty at once, and hurried to
escape the chance of this additional trial.
"Poll," she replied, still in the same faint tone, "good-
bye to you. I am sorry I have only thanks to give at
parting, but I will not forget you when it is in my power.
I left my things within; I will send for them some other
time."

"And where is it you're going? Danny, what's all this
about?"
"What business is it of yours," replied her brother, in
a peevish tone, "or of mine eider? Is it de master's
bidding, an' you can ax him why he duise it when he
comes, if you want to know."
"But the night will rain; it will be a bad night," said
Poll. "I seen the clouds gatherin' for tundher, an' I
comin' down the mountain."
Eily smiled faintly and shook her head, as if to inti-
mate that the changes of the seasons would henceforth
be to her of trivial interest.
"If it be the master's bidding, it must be right, no
doubt," said Poll, still looking in wonder and perplexity
on Eily's dreary and dejected face; "but it is a quare
storythat's what it is. Won't you ate anything?"
"Oh, not a morsel !" said Eily, with a look of sudden
and intense disgust; "but perhaps Danny may."
"No, but I'll drink a drop if you have it," returned
the lord, in a tone which showed that he doubted much
the likelihood of any refreshment of that kind remaining
long inactive in the possession of his sister. To his
delight and disappointment, however, Poll handed him a
bottle from the neighbouring dresser, which contained a
considerable quantity of spirits. He drank off the whole
at a draught, and we cannot more clearly show the strong
interest which Poll Naughten felt in the situation of Eily,
than by mentioning that she left this circumstance
unnoticed.
Without venturing to reiterate her farewell, Eily de-
scended, with a hasty but feeble step, the broken path
which led to the Gap-road, and was quickly followed by
the little lord. Committing herself to his guidance, she
soon lost sight of the mountain cottage, which she had
sought in hope and joy, and which she now abandoned in
despair.

CKIA-TER XXIX.
How HARDRESS LOST AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.
EILY had not been many minutes absent from the
cottage, when the thunder-storm predicted by Fighting
Poll commenced, amid all the circumstances of adventi-
tious grandeur by which those elemental convulsions are
accompanied among the Kerry mountains. The rain
came down in torrents, and the thunder clattered among
the crags and precipices with a thousand short reverbera-
tions. Phil Naughten, who had entered soon after the
storm began, was seated with his wife at their small
supper-table, the latter complaining heavily of the assault
made by Danny on her spirit-flask, which she now, for the
first time, discovered to be empty.
Suddenly the latch of the door was raised, and
Hardress Cregan entered, with confusion and terror in
his appearance. The dark frieze great-coat, in which his
figure was enveloped, seemed to be drenched in rain, and
his face was flushed and glistening with the beating of the
weather. He closed the door with difficulty against the
strong wind, and still keeping his left hand on the latch,
he said:
"I am afraid I have come too late. Is Danny here?"
"No, sir," said Phil; "he's gone these two hours."
"And Eily P"
"An' Eily along with him. He gave her papers that
made her go."
Hardress heard this with an appearance of satisfaction.
He leaned his back against the door, crossed his feet, and
fixed his eyes upon the ground, in a silent soliloquy,
which was to this effect:-
"It is done, then. I would have saved her, but it is
too late. Now, my good angel, be at peace with me. I
would have saved her. I obeyed your call. Amid the
## p. 277 (#281) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 277
storm, the darkness, and the rain, I flew to execute your
gentle will. But the devil had taken me at my word
already, and found me a rapid minister. Would I had
saved her Ha! What whisper's that? There can
come nothing worse of it than I have ordered. For-
saken l Banished . This is the very worst that can
befall her. And for the consequences, why, if she be so
weak and silly a thing as to pine and die of the slight,
let nature take the blame, not me. I never meant it.
But if that madman should exceed my orders. And if
he should," Hardress suddenly exclaimed aloud, while
he started from the door, and trembled with fury; "and if
he should," he repeated, extending his arms, and spreading
his fingers as if in act to gripe, "wherever I meet him
in the city, or in the desert; in the lowest depth of this
accursed valley, or on the summit of the mountain where
he tempted me, I will tear his flesh from off his bones,
and gibbet him for a miscreant and a ruffian."
He sunk, exhausted by this frantic burst of passion,
into a chairthe chair which Eily had occupied on that
evening. Phil Naughten and his wife left their seats in
astonishment, and gazed on him and on one another in
silence. In a few minutes Hardress rose more calmly
from the chair, and drew his arms out of the great-coat,
which he handed to Poll, signifying, by a motion of
his hand, that she should hang it near the fire. While
she obeyed his wishes, he resumed his seat in silence.
For a considerable time he remained leaning over the
back of the chair, and gazing fixedly upon the burning
embers. The fatigue of his long journey on foot, and
the exhaustion of his feelings, at length brought on a
heavy slumber, and his head sunk upon his breast in
deep, though not untroubled rest. Poll and her husband
resumed their meal, and afterwards proceeded to their
customary evening occupations. Phil began to repair the
pony's saddle, while Poll twisted the flaxen cords, accord-
ing as her husband required them.
"I'll tell you what, Phil," said his wife in a low whisper,
"there's something going on to-night that is not right; .
I am sorry I let Eily go."

"Whisht, you foolish woman," returned her husband.
"what would be going on 2 Mind your work, an' don't

"I do; an' I think that moan isn't for nothing.
Who is it he was talking of tearing a while ago?"
"I don't know; there's no use in thinking about it.
This is a cold night with poor M'Donough in his grave

"And so it is. Were there many at the funeral?"
"A power. The whole country was afther the hears2.
You never heerd such a cry in your life as was set up
in the churchyard by poor Garret O'Neil, his own natural,
ather the grave was covered in. The whole place was
in tears."
"Sure Garret wasn't with him this many a year?"
"He was not, until the very day before he died, when
he seen him in his own room. You remember a long
wattle that Garret used always be carrying in his hand P"
"I do, well."
"That was given to him be the masther, M'Donough
himself. Garret axed him once of a Hansel-Monday for
his hansel," and 'tis what he gave him was that wattle, as
it was standing behind the parlour doore. Here, Garret,"
says he, "take this wattle, and when you meet with a
greater fool than yourself, you may give it to him.' Garret
took it without a word, and the masther never seen him
afther till the other day, when he walked into his bed-
room, where he was lying in his last sickness, with the
wattle still in his hand. The masther knew him again the
minute he looked at him. "And didn't you part the
wattle yet, Garret?' says he. 'No, sir,' says Garret, 'I
can find nowhere a greater fool than I am myself.' 'You
show good sense in that, any way,' says the masther.
"Ah, Garret," says he, "I b'lieve I'm going.' 'Going
where, sir?" says Garret. 'Oh, a long journey," says he,
'an' one that I'm but little provided for." "An' did you

Heaven forgive me,' says M'Donough. 'An' you made no
preparation for it?' says Garret. "No preparation in life,'
says the masther to him again. Well, Garret moved over
near the bedside, and took the masther's hand, an' put the
wattle into it, just that way. "Well," says he, "take your
wattle again. You desired me keep it until I'd meet a
greater fool than myself, an' now I found him; for if you
knew you'd be taking that journey, an' made no pre-
paration for it, you are a greater fool than ever Garret was."
"That was frightful P said Poll "Husht | Did you
hear that? Well, if ever the dead woke, they ought to
wake to-night ! Did you ever hear such tundher?"
"'Tis great, surely. How sound Misther Hardress
sleeps, an' not to be woke by that. Put the candle at this
side, Poll, an' don't disturb him."
They now proceeded with their employment in silence,
which was seldom broken. Any conversation that passed,
was carried on in low and interrupted whispers, and all
possible pains were used to avoid disturbing the repose
of their weary guest and patron.
But the gnawing passion haunted him even in the
depth of sleep. A murmur occasionally broke from his lips,
and a hurried whisper, sometimes indicative of anger and
command, and sometimes of sudden fear, would escape
him. He often changed his position, and it was observed
by those who watched beside him, that his breathing was
oppressed and thick, and his brow was damp with dross
of moisture.
"The Lord defend and forgive us all !" said Phil, in a
whisper to his wife. "I'm afeerdI'll judge nobody,
but I'm afeerd there's some bad work, as you say, going
on this night."
"The Lord protect the poor girl that left us," whis-
pered Poll.
"Amen" replied her husband aloud.
"Ament" echoed the sleeper; and following the asso-
ciation awakened by the response, he ran over, in a rapid
voice, a number of prayers, such as are used in the
service of his church.

"He's saying his litanies," said Poll. "Phil, come
into the next room, or wake him up, either one or the
other; I don't like to be listenin' to him. Tisn't right
of us to be taking advantage of anybody in their dhrames.

with impatience.

"Here it is! Shake him, Phil! Mather Hardress!
wake, a'ra gall"
"Wake, Masther Hardress: wake, sir, if you plase !"
The instant he was touched, Hardress started from his
chair, as if the spring that bound him to it had been
suddenly struck, and remained standing before the fire in
an attitude of extreme terror. He did not speakat
least, the sounds to which he gave utterance could not
be traced into any intelligible form ; but his look and
gesture were those of a man oppressed with a horrid
apprehension. According, however, as his nerves re-
covered their waking vigour, and the real objects sur-
rounding him became known to his senses, a gradual
relief appeared to steal upon his spirits, his eyelids
dropped, his muscles were relaxed, and a smile of in-
tense joy was visible upon his features. He let his
arms fall slowly by his side, and sunk down once more,
with a murmur of painful satisfaction, into the chair
which he had left.
But the vision, with which he had been terrified, was
too deeply impressed on his imagination, to be at once
emoved. His dream had merely represented in act a
horrid deed, the apprehension of which had shaken his

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 281
soul with agony when awake, and had brought him amid
those obstacles of storm and darkness to the cottage of
his neglected wife. His fears were still unquieted: the
frightful image that bestrode his slumbers yet haunted
him awake, and opposed itself with a ghastly vigour to
his eyes, in whatever direction they were turned. Unable
to endure the constant recurrence of this unvarying
suggestion, he at length hurried out of the cottage. He
paid no attention to the voice of Poll Naughten, who
followed him to the door, with his great-coat in her hand,
but ran down the crags, and in the direction of his home,
with the speed of one distracted.
The light which burned in the drawing-room window
showed that all the family had not yet retired. His
mother, as he learned from old Nancy, was still expecting
his return. She was almost alone in the house, for
Cregan had left the cottage about a fortnight before in
order to escort Miss Chute to her own home. She was
seated at a table, and reading some work appropriate to
the coming festival, when Hardress made his appearance
at the door, still drenched in rain, and pale with agita-
tion and fatigue. He remained on the threshold, lean-
ing with one arm against the jamb, and gazing on the
lady.
"What! Up yet, mother?" he said, at length.
"Where's Anne P"
"Ha! Hardress Oh! my dear child, I have been
anxiously expecting you. Anne P Do you forget that
you took leave of her a fortnight since P"
"I had forgotten it. I now remember. But not for
-ever P"
"Why should you say so? What do you mean?" said
Mrs. Cregan. "Is not your bridal fixed for the 2nd of
February P. But I have mournful news to tell you,
Hardress P"
"Let me hear none of it !" exclaimed the unhappy
youth, with great vehemence. "It will drive me mad at
last. Nothing but mournful news | I'm sick of it.

find my reason going fast to wreck. Oh! mother, I shall
die an idiot yet ."
"My child !"
"Your child !" Hardress reiterated with petulant em-
phasis. "And if I am your child, could you not care
more kindly for my happiness? It was you that urged
me on to this. Mind, I comply; but it was you that
urged me. You brought me into the danger; and when I

mournful news at once."
"It is soon told," said Mrs. Cregan, who had now
become too well accustomed to those bursts of transient
passion in her son to afford them any angry consideration,
"Poor Mrs. Daly is dead."
"Dead I'"
"But this evening I heard it. The circumstance is
one of peculiar melancholy. She died quite unexpectedly
wn her accouchement."
"And if the virtuous are thus visited," said Hardress,
after a pause, lifting up his hands and eyes, "what

should not I expect? I wish I were fit to pray, that I
might pray for that kind woman."
"There is one act of mercy in your power," said his
mother; "you will be expected at the wake and funeral."
"And there I shall meet with Kyrle 1"
"What then P"
"Oh, nothing, nothing !" He paused for several
minutes, during which he leaned on the table in a medi-
tative posture. His countenance at length assumed an
appearance of more peaceful grief, and it became evident,
from the expression of his eye, that a more quiet train of
feeling was passing through his mind. "Poor Mrs.
Daly 1" he said at last. "If one would be wise at all
times, how little he would sacrifice to the gratification of
simple passion in such a world as this 1 Imprimis," he
continued, counting on his finger ends. "Imprimis, a
cradle; item, clothing; item, a house; item, fire; item,
food; item, a coffin. The best require no more than
these ; and for the worst, you need only additem, a
gallows, and you have said enough."
Mrs. Cregan heard this speech without the keen
anxiety which she would have felt if Hardress had been
less passionate in his manner and less extravagant in his
mode of speech. But knowing this, she heeded little
in him what would have filled her with terror in another.
"Well, will you go to the wake, Hardress P" she said.
"You must set out to-morrow morning early."
"I will," said Hardress. "It's a long distance, but I
can be there, at all events, by nightfall. When does the
funeral take place?"
"I suppose after to-morrow. I will have the curricle
at the door by day-break, for you must set me down at
Castle Chute. Go now, and change your dress at once,
or you will suffer for it. Nancy shall take you a warm
foot bath and a hot drink, when you are in your room."
Hardress retired without further question. The idea
of meeting with Kyrle Daly, after the unmanly neglect
..and even betrayal of his interests, was now the one which
occupied his sole attention. Half love is vanity; at
*east, a fair moiety of Hardress Cregan's later passion

might be placed to the account of that effeminate failing.
It could not, therefore, continue to maintain its hold upon
his heart against a passion so new and terrible as that
of remorse. His love for Anne Chute was now entirely
dormant in his mind, and his reason was at full liberty to
estimate the greatness of his guilt, without even the sug-
gestion of a palliative. When we add to this his cruel,
uncertainty with respect to the fate of Eily O'Connor, it
is probable that few who hear the story will envy the
repose of Hardress Cregan.
For one instant only, during his conversation with.
Danny Mann, the idea of Eily's death had flashed upon
his mind, and for that instant it had been accompanied.
with a sensation of wilful pleasure. The remembrance of
this guilty thought now haunted him with a deep feeling
of remorse, as if that momentary assent had been a posi-
tive act. Whenever his eye-lids dropped, a horrid chain
of faces passed before his imagination, each presenting.
some characteristic of death or painsome appearing
to threaten, and others to deride him. In this manner
the long and lonely night crept by, and the dreary
winter dawn found him still unrefreshed and feverish.

trees so much diminished by the distance, and by the
illusion produced by the novelty of the point of vision, as
to resemble a garden of mangel-Wurzel. -
Hardress had just taken his seat in the vehicle besidf
his mother, when a servant in livery rode up to the door,
and, touching his hat, put a letter into his hand. It
contained an invitation from Hepton Connolly to a
hunting dinner, which he was about to give in the course
of the month. Hardress remained for a moment in
meditation.
"Well, how long am I to stop here waiting for my
answer?" asked the messengerthe insolent groom
alluded to in an early portion of the narrative. Hardress
stared on him in silence for some moments.
"You had better go in and breakfast, I think," he
said; "you don't intend to return without alighting?"
"Is it for Hepton Connolly? Why then you may take
your vido I don't, nor for any other masther under the
sun. I was going to breakfast over at the inn, but as you
make the offer, I'll not pass your doore."
"You do me a great deal of honour. When does the
hunt take place?"
"In three weeks' time, I believe, or something there.
abouts?"
"Not Sooner?"
"No. I wanted him to have it at once, for he couldn't
have finer weather, an' the mare is in fine condition for it.
But when Connolly takes a thing into his head, you might
as well be talking to an ass."
"Well," said Hardress, "tell your master that you
found me just driving from home, and that I will come."
Saying this he drove away, while his mother remained
still wrapt in silent astonishment at the fellow's impu-
dence.
"Such," said Hardress, "is the privilege of a clever
groom. That rogue was once a simple, humble cottager,
but fortune favoured him. He assisted Connolly to win
a sweepstakes, which gained him a reputation on the
turf; and fame has since destroyed him. You would not
know whether to choose between indignation or laughter,

if you were present at the conversations that sometimes
take place between him and his master."
"If, instead of winning me the king's plate, he could
win me the king's crown, I could not endure him," said
the proud mother.
"Nor I," returned her prouder son; "nor I, indeed."
About noon they stopped to bait and hear Mass at the
town of Listowel. Mrs. Cregan and her son were shown
into a little parlour at the inn, the window of which looked
out upon the square. The bell of the chapel on the other
side was ringing for last Mass, and numbers of people,
in their holiday attire, were seen in the wide area, some
hurrying towards the chapel-gate, some loitering in groups
about the square, and some sitting on the low window-
sill stones."
The travellers joined the first-mentioned portion of the
crowd, and performed their devotions; at least, they gave
the sanction of their presence to the ceremonial of the day.
When they had returned to the inn, and taken their places
in the little parlour, Mrs. Cregan, after fixing her eyes for
* moment on her son, exclaimed:
"Why, Hardress, you are a perfect fright | Did you
dress to-day?"
"Not particularly."
"Do you intend to call in at Castle Chute?"
"Just to visit in passing."
"Then I would advise you, by all means, to do some-
thing to your toilet before you leave this."
Hardress took up a mirror which lay on the wooden
chimney-piece, and satisfied himself, by a single glance,
of the wisdom of his mother's suggestion. His eyes were
bloodshot, his beard grown and grisly, and his hair hang-
ing about his temples in most ungraceful profusion. He
rang the little bell which lay on the table, and summoned
the landlady to his presence. It would be difficult, she
told him, to procure a hair-cutter to-day, being a holiday,
but there was one from Garryowen below, that would do
the business as well as any one in the world, if he had
only got his scissors with him.
Hardress started at the name of Garryowen; but as h

288 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
did not remember the hair-cutter, and felt an anxiety to
hear news from that quarter, he desired the stranger to:
be shown into another room, where he proposed effect-
ing the necessary changes in his attire.
He had scarcely taken his seat before the toilet, when a
soft tap at the door, and the sound of a small, squeaking
voice, announced the arrival of the hair-cutter. On
looking round him, Hardress beheld a small, thin-faced,
red-haired little man, with a tailor's shears dangling from
his finger, bowing and smiling with a timid and con-
ciliating air. In an evil hour for his patience, Hardress
consented that he should commence operations.
"The piatez were very airly this year, sir," he modestly
began, after he had wrapped a check apron about the
neck of Hardress, and made the other necessary arrange-
ImentS.
"Very early, indeed. You needn't cut so fast."
"Very airly, sirthe white-eyes especially. Them
white-eyes are fine piatez. For the first four months I
wouldn't ax a better piatie than a white-eye, with a bit o'
bacon, if one had it; but after that the meal goes out of
'em, and they gets wet and bad. The cups arn't so good
in the beginnin' o' the saison, but they hould better.
Turn your head more to the light, sir, if you plase. The
cups, indeed, are a fine, substantial, lasting piatie.
There's great nutriment in 'em for poor people, that
would have nothin' else with them but themselves or a
grain o' salt. There's no piatie that eats better, when
you have nothin' but a bit o' the little one (as they say)
to eat with a bit o' the big. No piatie that eats so sweet
with point."
"With point?" Hardress repeated, a little amused by
this fluent discussion of the poor hair-cutter upon the
varieties of a dish which, from his childhood, had formed
almost his only article of nutriment, and on which he
expatiated with as much cognoscence and satisfaction as a
fashionable gourmand might do on the culinary produc-
tions of Eustache Ude. "What is point?"
"Don't you know what that is, sir? I'll tell you in a
minute. A joke that them that has nothin' to do, an'

plenty to eat, make upon the poor people that has nothin'
to eat, and plenty to do. That is, when there's dry
piatez on the table, and enough of hungry people about
it, and the family would have, may be, only one bit o'
bacon hanging up above their heads, they'd peel a piatie
first, and then they'd point it up at the bacon, and
they'd fancy that it would have the taste o' the mait when
they'd be aitin' it after. That's what they call point, sir.
A cheap sort o' diet it is (Lord, help us !), that's plenty
enough among the poor people in this country. A great
plan for making a small bit o' pork go a long way in a
large family."
"Indeed it is but a slender sort of food. Those
scissors you have are dreadful ones."
"Terrible, sir. I sent my own over to the forge before
I left home, to have any eye put in it; only for that I'd
be smarter a deal. Slender food it is, indeed. There's a
deal o' poor people here in Ireland, sir, that are run so
hard at times, that the wind of a bit o' mait is as good to
'em as the mait itself to them that would be used to it.
The piatez are everythingthe itshen" little or nothin'.
But there's a sort of piatez (I don't know did your honour
ever taste 'em) that's gettin' greatly in vogue now among
'em, an' is killin' half the countrythe white piateza
piatie that has great produce, an' requires but little
manure, an' will grow in very poor land, but has no more
strength nor nourishment in it than if you had boiled a
handful o' saw-dust and made gruel of it, or put a bit of
deal boord between your teeth and thought to make a
breakfast of it. The black bulls themselves are better.
Indeed the black bulls are a deal a better piatie than
they're thought. When you'd peel 'em, they'd look as
black as indigo, an' you'd have no mind to 'em at all;
but I declare they're very sweet in the mouth, an' very
strengthenin'. The English reds are a nate piatie
too; and the apple piatie (I don't know what made 'em
be given up), an' the kidney (though delicate of rearing);
but give me the cups for all, that will hould the meal in
'em to the last, and won't require any inthricket tillage.

Let a man have a middling-sized pit o' cups again' the
winter, a small caish" to pay his rent, an' a handful o'
turf behind the doore, an' he can defy the world."
"You know as much, I think," said Hardress, "of
farming as of hair-cutting."
"Oyeh, if I had nothing to depend upon but what
heads comes across me this way, sir, I'd be in a poor way
enough. But I have a little spot o' ground besides."
"And a good taste for the produce."
""Twas kind father for me to have that same. Did
you ever hear tell, sir, of what they call limestone
broth P"
"Never."
"'Twas my father first made it. I'll tell you the story,
sir, if you'll turn your head this way a minute."
Hardress had no choice but to listen.
"My father went once upon a time about the country,
in the idle season, seeing would he make a penny at all by
cutting hair, or setting razhurs and penknives, or any other
job that would fall in his way. Well an' goodhe was
one day walking alone in the mountains of Kerry, without
a hai'p'ny in his pocket (for though he travelled afoot, it
cost him more than he earned), an' knowing there was but
little love for a county Limerick man in the place where
he was, on being half perished with the hunger, an' even-
ing drawing nigh, he didn't know well what to do with
himself till morning. Very goodhe went along the wild
road, an' if he did, he soon see a farm-house at a little
distance, o' one sidea snug-looking place, with the
smoke curling up out of the chimney, an' all tokens of
good living inside. Well, some people would live where
a fox would starve. What do you think did my father
do? He wouldn't beg (a thing one of our people
never done yet, thank Heaven!) an' he hadn't the money
to buy a thing; so what does he do? He takes up a
couple o' the big limestones that were lying on the
road in his two hands, an' away with him to the house.
'Lord save all here !" says he, walkin' in the door. "And
you kindly,' says they. "I'm come to you,' says he, this

way, looking at the two limestones, "to know would you
let me make a little limestone broth over your fire, until
I'll make my dinner?' 'Limestone broth l' says they to
him again; 'what's that, eroo?' 'Broth made o' lime-
stone,' says he, "what else?" "We never heard of such a
thing,' says they. "Why, then, you may hear it now,'
says he, "an' see it also, if you'll gi' me a pot an' a couple
o' quarts o' soft water.' 'You can have it an' welcome,'
says they. So they put down the pot an' the water, an'
my father went over an'tuk a chair hard-by the pleasant
fire for himself, an' put down his two limestones to boil,
and kept stirrin' them round like stirabout. Very good
well, by-an'-by, when the wather began to boil''Tis
thickening finely,' says my father; 'now if it had a grain
o' salt at all, 'twould be a great improvement to it."
'Raich down the salt-box, Nell,' says the man o' the house
to his wife. So she did. 'Oh! that's the very thing just,'
says my father, shaking some of it into the pot. So he
stirred it again awhile, looking as sober as a minister.
By-an'-by, he takes the spoon he had stirring it, an' tastes
it. "It is very good now," says he, "although it wants
something yet." "What is it?' says they. "Oyeh, wisha,
nothing,' says he; 'maybe 'tis only fancy o' me." If it's
anything we can give you,' says they, 'you're welcome to
it." "Tis very good as it is,' says he; 'but when I'm at
home, I find it gives it a fine flavour just to boil a little
knuckle o'bacon, or mutton trotters, or anything that way,
along with it. 'Raich hether that bone o' sheep's head
we had at dinner yesterday, Nell," says the man o' the
house. 'Oyeh, don't mind it," says father; 'let be as it
is.' 'Sure if it improves it, you may as well," says they.
'Baithershin /** says my father, putting it down. So
after boiling it a good piece longer, ''Tis as fine lime-
stone broth,' says he, 'as ever was tasted; an' if a man
had a few piatez," says he, looking at a pot o' 'em that
was smokin' in the chimney corner, 'he couldn't desire
a better dinner." They gave him the piatez, and he
made good dinner of themselves an' the broth, not
forgetting the bone, which he polished equal to chaney

Wefore he let it go. The people themselves tasted it,
an' thought it as good as any mutton broth in the
world."
"Your father, I believe, knew how to amuse his friends
after a short journey as well as any other traveller."
The fellow leered at Hardress, thrust out his lips, and
winked with both eyes, in a manner which cannot be
expressed. "He was, indeed, a mighty droll, funny man.
Not interruptin' you, sir, I'll tell you a thing that happened
him in the hair-cuttin' line, that flogs all Munster, I think,
for 'cuteness."
"I am afraid I cannot wait to hear it. I have a great
way to go to-day, and a great deal to do before I set
off."
"That's just biddin' me go on with my story, sir; for
the more I talk, the faster I work, for ever. Just turn
your head this way, sir, if you plase. My fathera
little more to the light, sirmy father was sittin' one fine
mornin' in his little shop, curlin' a front curl belongin' to a
lady (we won't mention who) in the neighbourhood, with
the sun shinin' in the door, and he singin' a little song for
himself, an' meself, a craithur, sittin' by the fire, lookin'
about me, an' sayin' nothin'. Very well; all of a sudden
a gentleman, tall and well mounted, rode up to the doore,
an' "Hello!' says he, callin' out, 'can I get myself
shaved here?" says he. "Why not, plase your honour?"
says my father, startin' up, and layin' by the front out of
his hand. So he 'lit off his horse, an' come in. He was
a mighty bould, fierce-looking gentleman, with a tun-
dherin' long sword be his side, down, an' a pair o' whiskers
as big an' as red as a fox's brush, an' eyes as round as them
two bull's eyes in the window-panes, an' they havin' a
strange twisht in 'em, so that when he'd be lookin' you
straight in the face, you'd think it's out at the door he'd
be lookin'. Besides that, when he'd spake, he used to
give himself a loud roisterin' way, as if you were a mile
off, an' not willin' to come near or to be said by him.
"Do you mind, now," says he, an' he takin' a chair oppozit

a bee's knee," says he, "I had a mortal enmity to seein' a
drop o' my own blood, an' I'll tell you what it is,' says
he. "What is it, sir?" says my father. "I'll make a clear
bargain with you now," says the gentleman. So he took
out a half-crown, an' laid it upon the table, an' after that
he drew his swoord, and laid it hard-by the half-crown.
"Do you see them two now?' says he. "I do, surely,"
says my father. 'The half-crown will be yours,' says the
gentleman, if you'll shave me without drawin' my blood;
but if I see as much as would make a breakfast for(he
named an animal that I won't mention after him now)
if I see as much after you,' says he, "I'll run this swoord
through your body, as sure as there's mait in mutton.
So look before you lep; if you won't take the bargain,
say it, and let me ride away,' says he. This was in times
when a gentleman that way would think as little a'most
of doin' a thing o' the kind to a poor Catholic as he
would now of saying it; so well became my father to
look to himself. "You'll never have it to say o' me,'
says my father, "that I wouldn't trust my hand so far at
any rate in the business I was bred to.' So to it they
fell, an' as Providence ordered it, my father shaved him
without one gash, an' put the half-crown in his pocket.
"Well, now 'tis done,' says the gentleman, "but you're a
foolish man." "How so, sir?" says my father. "Because,
so sure as I saw the blood," says the other, 'I'd make my
word good." "But you never would see the blood, sir,'
says my father quite easy, "because I'd see it before you,
an' I'd cut your throat with the razhur.' Well, 'twas as
good as a play to see the look the gentleman gave him
when he said that. He didn't answer him a word, but
mounted his horse, and rode away."
"He found his match in the hair-cutter," said Hardress,
rejoiced as the story ended.
"I'll be bound, sir, he was in no hurry to make bar-
gains o' that kind any more. 'Twas a mighty good
answer, sir, wasn't it?""A desperate one at all events."
"Ah, desperate, you may say that; but my father was
sure of his hand. I'll tell you another droll thing that
happened my father once, when jy

But the patience of his listener was here completely
stranded. The hair-cutter had got such a miserable pair
of shears, that he was obliged to use as much exertion in
clipping the hair, as a tinker or a plumber might do in
cutting sheet lead. Besides, being accustomed to that
professional flippancy of movement which, with pro-
per instruments, might have expedited the operation, he
made no allowance for the badness of his scissors, but
clipped and plucked away as fast as usual; thus contriv.
ing to tear up half as much by the roots as he removed
in the usual course of business. This, and other cir-
cumstances, induced Hardress to place a decided nega-
tive in the way of his anecdotes, until he had finished.
This being accomplished, Hardress raised his hand to
his head, and experienced a sensation on the palm, some-
what similar to that which would be produced by placing
it on an inverted hair-brush. On looking in the glass, he
discovered that his hair had been cut into a fashion which
enjoys a lasting popularity at fairs and cottage merry-
makings; but, however consistent with the interests of
persons who only employed a barber once in a quarter,
and then supposed that the closer he cut, the better value
he gave for the money, it was by no means in accordance
with the established notions of good taste. There were
indeed no gaps, as he boasted, for he had cut it almost
as bare as a wig-block, leaving only a narrow fringe in
front, from ear to ear, like the ends of a piece of silk.
There was no help, however, for such mischief once
effected, so that Hardress paid him without remark, and
paid him liberally.
The little hair-cutter took it for granted, by the hand-
some manner in which his customer had compensated for
his services, that he was highly gratified with the manner
in which they had been performed.
"If your honour," he said, bowing very low, "would
be passing through Garryowen, an' would be inclined to
lave any o' your hair behind you, maybe you'd think of
Dunat O'Leary's shop, on the right-hand side o' the
sthreet, three doores down from Mihil O'Connor's, the
rope-maker's."

"I will, I will," said Hardress, turning suddenly away.
Mr. O'Leary walked slowly to the door, and again
returned.
"There's a great set o'lads about the place, sir," he
said, in his usual shrill voice, while a slight degree of
embarrassment appeared in his manner, "an' they're for
ever christenin' people out o' their names, till a man is
better known by a nickname than by his own. 'Tis ten
to one, plase your honour, that you'll be the surer of
finding me by asking for Foxy Dunat, than for my own
lawful name; they're such a set o'lads."
"Very well; good morning, Foxy Dunat."
"Yes, sir, Foxy, in regard of the red hair that's on me.
Ah, there's no standing them lads."
"Very well; good morning, Foxy Dunat. I'll re-
member."
"Good morning to your honour. Stay !" he once
more returned from the door. "See what I was doing;
carrying your honour's hair away with me."
"Well, and what business do you suppose I have of it
now P I am not a wig-maker."
"I don't know, sir, but people mostly likes to put it up
in some safe place again the day of judgment, as they
say."
"The day of judgment"
"Yes, plase your honour. We must have everything
about us then, that ever belonged to us, an' a man would
look droll that time without his hair."
Hardress was not in a humour for jesting, but he could
not avoid smiling in secret at this conceit.
"Very well," said he, tapping the hair-cutter upon the
shoulder, and looking gravely in his face. "As I am
going a long journey at present, I will feel obliged by
your keeping it for me until then, and I will call on you
if I want it."
"As your honour feels agreeable," said Dunat, again
bowing low, and moving towards the door. Nevertheless,
he did not leave the room until he had made the young
gentleman acquainted with all the circumstances that
occasioned his absence from home at this moment. In

doing so, he unwarily touched Hardress to the quick.
He had come, he said, in consequence of a letter he had
received from a neighbour's daughter that had run away
from her father, and was hid somewhere among the
Kerry mountains.
"A letter you received l'exclaimed Hardress, in strong
surprise.
"Yes, sir; telling me she was alive, and bidding me
let the old man know of it; the old rope-maker I men-
tioned a while ago, Since I came, I heard it reported at
Castle Island, this morning, that she was drownded
somewhere in the Flesk."
"Drowned 1 Eily drowned 1" Hardress suddenly ex-
claimed, starting from a reverie, as the single word struck
upon his hearing.
"Eily was her name, sure enough," replied O'Leary,
staring on him, "howsomdever you come to know it."
"IIyou mentioned that name, I think; did you
not P"
"Maybe it slipped from me, sir. Well, as I was say.
ing, they thought she was drownded there, an' they wor
for havin' a sheaf o' reeds, with her name tied upon it,
put out upon the sthrame; for they say, when a person
dies by water, the sheaf o' reeds will float against the
sthrame, or with the sthrame, until it stops over the
place where the body lies, if it had to go up O'Sullivan's
cascade itself. But Father Edward O'Connor desired
'em to go home about their business, that the sheaf
would go with the current, an' no way else, if they were
at it from this till doomsday. To be sure he knew
best."
At this moment, the landlady knocked at the door, to
inform our Collegian that Mrs. Cregan was expecting him
without. Having concluded his toilet, he hurried out of
the room, not displeased at his release from the obser-
vation of this stranger, at a moment when he felt his
agitation increasing to an extent that was almost un-
governable,

CHAPTER XXXI.
HOW KYRLE DALY HEARS OF THE HANDSOME CONDUCT
OF HIS FRIEND HARDRESS.
PREVIOUs to Anne Chute's departure from the cottage of
her aunt, all the arrangements necessary for her marriage
with Hardress had been verbally agreed upon. A feeling
of decorum only prevented the legal preliminaries from
being put in form before her return to her mother's castle.
The singularly unequal and unaccountable behaviour of
her intended husband, during the whole course of wooing,
had left her mind in a condition of distressing annoyance
and perplexity. Though she still loved Hardress well,
it was with an anxious and uneasy affection, such as she
should entertain for a mysterious being whose talents
had fascinated her will, but of whose real nature she
yet remained in troubled ignorance. Fame, who never
moves her wings so swiftly as when she has got a tale to
tell of death or marriage, soon spread the information
far and wide. The manner in which it reached the ears
of Kyrle Daly was sudden as it was unwelcome.
He had gone down to the dairy-farm, for the purpose
of shore-shooting, and was returning in order to spend
the Little Christmas at home. It was about noon when
he rode by the gate at Castle Chute. The door of the
dwelling-house stood open, and several figures appeared
on the broad stone steps. They were too distant to be
recognised, but Kyrle glanced with a beating pulse
towards that part of the building which contained the
sleeping-chamber of his mistress. The window-shutters
were unclosed, and it was evident that Anne Chute had
once more become a resident in the castle.
In order to be assured of the reality of this belief, ,
young Daly spurred on his horse as far as the caravan-
sary of Mr. Normile, already celebrated in an early part

2f our history. That individual, whom he found in the
act of liberating an unruly pig, after payment of pound
fees, informed him of the arrival at Castle Chute, a fort.
night previous, of its young heiress and her uncle.
He rode on, unwilling to trust himself with any length:
ened conversation on this subject while under the shrewd
eye of an Irish peasant. All his former passion returned
in an instant, and with an intensity which surprised him-
self. It had been the labour of his life since his last
interview with the young lady above named, to remove her
quietly from his recollection, and he flattered himself that
he had, in a great degree, succeeded. He was no
believer in the romantic and mischievous supposition, that
true love never changes nor decays, even when hope has
left it.
He knew that there were many effeminate and sensi-
tive characters, who, having once permitted their imagi-
nations to become deeply impressed, are afterwards weak
enough to foster that impression, even while it is making
inroads upon their health and peace; but such beings
were the objects of his pity, not of his esteem. He was
neither a fanatic nor a voluptuary in the passion. If,
therefore, he had discovered that any one of those
rational considerations, on which his love was founded,
had been erroneously taken upif he had discovered that
the lady was, in reality, unworthy of the place to which
he had raised her, we do not say he would at once have
ceased to love, but he would certainly have experienced
much less difficulty in subduing the frequent agitations
of the passion. But he had not the assistance of such a
conviction; and it was only after a long and vigilant
exercise of his habitual firmness, that he had reduced his
mind to a state of dormant tranquillity.
Opportunity, therefore, was only needed to rouse it up
once more in all its former strength. That opportunity
had now arrived, and Kyrle Daly found that the trial was
a more searching one than he had been led to think.
He yielded for a moment to the reflections which pressed
upon him, and slackened the pace of his steed. He
looked upon the castle and its quiet bay, the point, the

wood, the waves, and the distant hills of Clare. He
passed the little sandy slope on which he had witnessed
the festivities of the saddle-race, and which now looked
wintry, lone, and bleak in the December blast.
The face of the river was dark and troubledthe long
waves of the half-flood tide rolled in, and broke upon the
sands, leaving a track of foam upon the water's verge,
while a long black line of seaweed marked the height to
which it had arisen on the shore. He glanced at the
pathway from the road, on which his hopes had ex
perienced their last decisive and severe repression. His
feelings, at this moment, approached the limits of pain
too nearly, and he spurred on his horse, to hurry away
from them and from the scene on which they had been
first called into action.
He had not ridden far when he heard loud bursts of
laughter, and the tramp of many horses on the road
behind him. The voices were raised high in the com-
petition to obtain a hearing, and he thought the accents
were not those of strangers. The proud politeness of an
Irish gentleman, which was rather conventional than
natural with Kyrle Daly, prevented his looking round to
satisfy his curiosity, until the party had ridden up, and he
heard his own name coupled with a familiar greeting by
many voices. Turning on his saddle, he beheld Mr.
Connolly, Mr. Hyland Creagh, Doctor Leake, and Cap-
tain Gibson riding abreast, and laughing immoderately.
"Connolly, how are you? How are you, Doctor? Mr.
CreaghCaptain," touching his hat slightly to the latter,
"what's all the fun about?"
"I'll tell Daly," said Connolly; "he's a lawyer."
"Pish I?' replied Dr. Leake, "'tis too foolish a thing;
you will make him laugh at you."
"Foolish It is the best story I ever heard in my life.
Eh, Captain?"
Captain Gibson replied by an excessive roar of laughter,
and Hyland Creagh protested it was worthy of the days
of the Hell-fire Club. Connolly looked down in scornful
triumph upon the Doct" who tossed his head, and
sneered in silence.

"I'll tell you how it was," said Connolly. "I believe
'tis no secret to you, Daly, or any other acquaintance of
mine, that I owe more money to different friends than I
am always willing to pay
Owen More ran away,
Owing more than he could pay;"
so, if I should come to borrow money of you, you had
better keep it in your pocket, I advise you. But it so
happened that we spent the other evening at a friend's in
the neighbourhood, who could not afford me a bed, so I
went to hammock at Normile's inn. In the morning, I
stepped out to the stable to see how my horse had been
made up in the night, when I felt a tap on the shoulder
just like thatdo you feel it at all electrical?[he touched
Kyrle's shoulder]I do, always. I turned, and saw a
fellow in a brown coat, with a piece of paper in his hand.
I was compelled to accept his invitation, so I requested
that he would step into the inn while I was taking a little
breakfast. While I was doing so, and while he was
sitting at the other side of the fire, in walked Pat Falvey,
Mrs. Chute's footman, with his mistress's compliments, to
thank me for a present of baking apples I had sent her.
I winked at Pat, and looked at the bailiff. 'Pat,' says I,
"tell your mistress not to mention it; and Pat,' says I,
dropping to a whisper, "I am a prisoner.' 'Very well, sir,'
says Pat aloud, and bowing as if I had given him some
message. He left the room, and in ten minutes I had the
whole parish about the windows. They came in, they
called for the bailiff, they seized him, and beat him until
they didn't leave him worth looking at. Dooly, the nailer,
caught his arm, and O'Reilly, the blacksmith, took him by
the leg, and another by the hair, and another by the
throat; and such a show as they made of him before five
minutes, I never contemplated. But here was the beauty
of it. I knew the law, so I opposed the whole proceeding.
"No rescue,' says I; "I am his prisoner, gentlemen, and I
will not be rescued; so don't beat the man!don't toss
him in a blanket!don't drag him in the puddle!don't
plunge him into the horse-pond, I entreat you!' By some

fatality my intentions were wholly misconceived, and they
performed exactly the things that I warned them to avoid.
They did beat himthey did toss him in a blanketthey
did drag him through the puddleand they did plunge
him into the horse-pond I Only imagine what were my
chagrin and disappointment. Doctor Leake maintains
that it is a misprision of batterya law term I never heard
in my life. As if, by desiring them not to drag him
through the horse-pond, I imagined their doing it. Then
it was an overt act of dragging him through the horse-
pond. Compassing the dragging him through would
have been an actual act of battery, but the imagining of
it is only an overt act. As among the English regicides,
by cutting off the head of Charles, they were said to
imagine his death, which was an overt act of treason,
whereas compassing his death was the actual treason
itself. But in this case I deny both the compassing and
the imagination. What do you think of it, Mr. Daly?"
"I think," said Kyrle with a smile, "that you ought to
come and take my opinion on it some day or other."
"Ah, ha!" replied Connolly, shaking his head. "I
understand you, young lawyer! Well, when I have a fee
to spare, you shall have it. But here is the turn up to
my house. Est ubi locushow I forget my Latin l
Daly, will you come up and dine with me?"
"I cannot, thank you."
"Well, I'm sorry for it. Creagh, you're not going?"
"I must."
"Stop and dine."
"No. I'll see you to-morrow. I have business in
tewn."
The party separated, Kyrle Daly and Creagh continu-
ing to ride in the same direction, while the rest wheeled
off by a narrow by-road.
"You will be at the wedding, I suppose, Mr. Daly?"
said the latter gentleman, after a silence of some
minutes.
"What wedding P" asked Kyrle, in some surprise.
"Why, have you not heard of it? Miss Chute's
wedding."

"Miss Chute?" Kyrle repeated faintly.
"Yes. Everything, I understand, has been arranged
for the ceremony, and Cregan tells me it is to take place
next month. She would be a magnificent wife for any
man l'"
It was some moments before Kyrle could recover
breath to ask another question.
"Andaof course you heard who is to be the bride-
groom?" he said with much hesitation.
"Oh yes. I thought he was a friend of yours. Mr.
Hardress Cregan."
"Cregan l'exclaimed Kyrle aloud, and starting as if he
had received a galvanic shock; "it is impossible !"
"Sir!" said Creagh, sternly.
"I think," said Kyrle, governing himself by a violent
exertion, "you must have been misinformed. Hardress
Cregan is, as you say, my friend, and he cannot be the
man."
"I seldom, sir," said Creagh, with a haughty curl on
his lip, "converse with any person who is capable of
making false assertions; and, in the present instance, I
should think the gentleman's father no indifferent
authority." -
Again Kyrle Daly paused for some minutes in an
emotion of deep apprehension. "Has Mr. Cregan, then,
told you," he said, "that his son was to be the bride-
groom?"
"I have said he has."
Daly closed his lips hard, and straightened his person,
as if to relieve an internal pain. This circumstance
accounted for the enigmatical silence of his friend. But
what a horrible solution |
"It is very strange," he said, "notwithstanding. There
are many impediments to such a marriage. He is her
cousin."
"Pooh, pooh, that's a name of courtesy. It is only a
connexion by affinity. Cousin Hang them all, cousins
on a string, say Il They are the most dangerous rivals
a man can have. Any other man you can call out and
shoot through the head, if he attempts to interfere with

your prospects, but cousins must have a privilege. The
lady may walk with her cousin (hang him!) and she may
dance with her cousin, and write to her cousin, and it is
only when she has run away with her cousin, that you
find that you have been cozened with a vengeance."
While Creagh made this speech, Kyrle Daly was
running over in his mind the entire circumstances of
young Cregan's conduct; and the conclusion to which his
reflections brought him was, that a more black and
shameful treason had never been practised between man
and man. For the first time in his life, Kyrle Daly
wholly lost his self-government. Principle, religion,
duty, justice, all vanished for the instant from his mind,
and nothing but the deadly injury remained to stare him
in the face.
"I will horsewhip him " he said within his mind;
"I will horsewhip him at the wedding feast. The cool,
dark hypocrite lI suppose, sir," he said aloud, turning
to Creagh with a smile of calm and dignified courtesy,
"I suppose I may name you as my authority for this?"
"Certainly, certainly," returned the old duellist with a
short bow, while his eyes lit up with pleasure at the idea
of an affair of honour. "Stay a moment, Mr. Daly," he
added, as the young gentleman was about to quicken his
pace. "I perceive, sir, that you are going to adopt, in
this business, the course that is usual among men of
honour. Now, I have had a little experience in these
affairs, and I am willing to be your friend 22
"Pardon me, Mr. Creagh, I 22
"Nay, pardon me, Mr. Daly, if you please. I do not
mean your friend in the usual acceptation of the term; I
do not mean your second; you may have a desire to choose
for yourself in that respect; I merely wished to say, that I
could afford you some useful hints as to your conduct or
the ground. In the first instance, look to your powder,

that line, and fire at the button. He will never hear the
shot."
"Tell me, Mr. Creagh," said Kyrle, in a grave tone,
after he heard these murderous directions to the end,
"are not you a friend of Mr. Cregan P"
"Yes. Very old friends."
"Do you not dine at his table, and sleep under his
roof from day to day?"
"Pray, what is the object of these curious questions?"

CHAPTER XXXII.
HOW KYRLE DALY's waRLIKE ARDOUR WAS CHECKED
BY AN UNTOWARD INCIDENT.
A Joyous piece of news awaited Kyrle Daly at the door
of his own home. Lowry Looby met him on the avenue,
his little arms outstretched, and his huge mouth expanded
with an expression of delighted astonishment.
"Oh, Master Kyrle !" he said, "you're just come in
time. I was goin' off for you. Hurry in-hurry in, sir!
There's a new little sister within waiting for you this way!"
"And your mistress, Lowry?" said Kyrle, springing
from his horse, and tossing the reins to the servant.
"Finely, finely, sir, thank Heaven."
"Thank Heaven, indeed!" echoed Daly, hurrying on,
with a flushed and gladdened face, towards the hall-door.
Everything of self, his disappointment, the treachery of his
friend, the loss of his mistress, and his dilemma with the
duellist, were all forgotten in his joy at the safety of his
mother.
The door stood open, and the hall was crowded with
servants, children, and tenants. In the midst of a hundred
exclamations of wonder, delight, and affection, which broke
from the lips of the group, the faint cry of a baby was
heard, no louder than the wail of a young kitten. He saw
his father holding the little stranger in his arms, and
looking in its face with a smile, which he was in vain
endeavouring to suppress. The old kitchen-maid stood
on his right, with her apron to her eyes, crying for joy.
One or two younger females, the wives of tenants, were
on the other side, gazing on the red and peevish little face
of the innocent, with a smile of maternal sympathy and
compassion.
II.

306 the COLLEEN BAWN.
A fair-haired girl clung to her father's skirt, and
petitioned loudly to be allowed to nurse it for a moment.
Another looked rebukingly upon her, and told her to be
silent. North-east and Charles had clambered upon a
chair, to overlook the throng which they could not pene-
trate. Patcy stood near the parlour-door, jumping with
all his might, and clapping his hands like one possessed.
There appeared only one discontented figure on the scene.
It was that of little Sally, hitherto the pet and plaything
of the family, who stood in a distant corner, with her face
turned to the wall, her lip pouting, and her blue eye filling
up with jealous tears.
The moment Kyrle made his appearance at the door,
the uproar was redoubled. "Kyrlel Kyrle! Here's Kyrle
Kyrle, look at your sister! look at your sister l'exclaimed
a dozen voices, while the group at the same moment
opened, and admitted him into the centre.
"Poor little darling !" said Kyrle, patting it on the
cheek. "Is it not better to take it in out of the cold,
Sir P"
"I think so, Kyrle, Nurse I Where's the nurse?"
The door of Mrs. Daly's sleeping-chamber opened, and
a woman appeared on the threshold, looking rather
anxious. She ran hastily through the hall, got a bowl of
water in the kitchen, and hurried back again into the
bed-room.
"Why doesn't she come?" said Mr. Daly. "The little
thing cries so, I am afraid it is pinched by the air."
"I suppose she is busy with my aunt O'Connell and her
patient yet," said Kyrle.
A hurried tramping of feet was now heard in the
bed-room, and the sound of rapid voices in anxiety and
confusion. A dead silence sunk upon the hall. Mr.
Daly and his son exchanged a glance of thrilling import.
A low moan was the next sound that proceeded from the
room. The husband placed the child in the arms of the
old woman, and hurried to the chamber-door. He was
met at the threshold by his sister, Mrs. O'Connell (a
grave-looking lady in black), who placed her hands against
his breast, and said, with great agitation of manner:-
## p. 307 (#311) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 3o?
"Charles, you must not come in yet."
"Why so, Mary? How is she?"
"Winny," said Mrs. O'Connell, addressing the old
woman who held the infant, "take the child into the
kitchen until the nurse can come to you."
"How is Sally?" repeated the anxious husband.
"You had better go into the parlour, Charles. Re-
collect yourself now, my dear Charles, remember your
children 22
The old man began to tremble. "Mary," he said,
"why will you not answer me? How is she?"
"She is not better, Charles."
* Not better."
"No, far otherwise."
"Far otherwise! Come! woman, let me pass into the
room."
"You must not, indeed you must not, Charles I"
exclaimed his sister, flinging her arms round his neck,
and bursting into tears. "Kyrle, Kyrle! speak to him 1"
Young Daly caught his father's arm. "Well, well,"
said the latter, looking around him with a calm, yet
ghastly smile, "if you are all against me, I must of course
submit."
"Come with me to the parlour," said Mrs. O'Connell,
"and I will explain to you."
She took him by the arm, and led him, with a vacant
countenance and passive demeanour, through the silent
and astonished group. They entered the parlour, and the
door was closed by Mrs. O'Connell. Kyrle Daly remained
fixed like a statue, in the same attitude in which his aunt
had left him, and a moment of intense and deep anxiety
ensued. The rare and horrid sound, the scream of an
old man in suffering, was the first that broke on that por-
tentous stillness. It acted like a spell upon the group in
the hall. They were dispersed in an instant. The
women ran shrieking in various directions. The men
looked dismayed, and uttered hurried sentences of won-
der and affright. The children, terrified by the confu-
sion, added their shrill and helpless wailings to the rest.
The death-cry re-echoed in the bed-room, in the parlour,
## p. 308 (#312) ############################################
308 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
and in the kitchen. From every portion of the dwelling,
the funeral shriek ascended to the Heavens; and Death
and Sorrow, like armed conquerors, seemed to have
possessed themselves by sudden storm of this little hold,
where peace and happiness had reigned so long and
calmly.
Kyrle's first impulse on hearing his father's voice, made
him rush to the bed-room of his mother. There was no
longer any opposition at the door, and he entered with a
throbbing heart. The nurse was crying aloud, and wring-
ing her hands at the fire-place. Mrs. Leahy, the midwife,
was standing near the bed-side, with a troubled and
uneasy countenance, evidently as much concerned for the
probable injury to her own reputation as for the affliction
of the family. Kyrle passed them both, and drew back
the curtain of the bed. His mother was lying back quite
dead, and with an expression of languid pain upon her
features.
"I never saw a case o' the kind in my life," muttered
Mrs. Leahy. "I have attended hundreds in my time, an'
I never saw the like. She was sitting up in her bed, sir,
as well as I'd wish to see her, an' I just stepped to the
fire to warm a little gruel, when I heard Mrs. O'Connell
calling me; I ran to the bed, an' sure there I found her
dying ! She just gave one moan, and 'twas all over. I
never heard of such a case. All the skill in the world
wouldn't be any good in such a business."
Kyrle Daly felt no inclination to dispute the point with
her. A heavy, dizzy sensation was in his brain, which
made his actions and his manners resemble those of a
person who walks in his sleep. He knelt down to pray,
but a feeling like lethargy disqualified him for any exer-
cise of devotion. He rose again, and walked listlessly
into the hall.
Almost at the same moment, Mr. Daly appeared at the
parlour door, followed by his aged sister, who was still in
tears. The old man glanced at his children, and waved
his hands before him. "Take them from my sight," he
said, in a low voice; "let the orphans be removed; go
now, my children, we never shall be happy here again."
## p. 309 (#313) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 309
"Charles, my dear Charles l" said his sister, in a tone
of gentle remonstrance, while she laid her hand upon his
shoulder.
"Well, Mary, I will do whatever you like. Heaven
knows I am not fit to direct myself, now. Ha! Kyrle,
are you returned? I remember I wrote you word to come
home to conclude the Christmas with us. I did not think
you would have so mournful a home to come to. When
did you come?"
"You forget, Charles, that you saw Kyrle awhile ago,"
said Mrs. O'Connell.
"Did I? I had forgotten it," returned Mr. Daly, toss-
ing his head. He extended his hand to Kyrle, and burst
into tears. Kyrle could not do so. He passed his father
and aunt, and entered the parlour, which was now deserted.
He sat down at a small table before the window, and
leaning on his elbow, looked out upon the face of the
river. The wintry tide was flowing against a sharp and
darkening gale, and a number of boats, with close-reefed :
sails and black hulls, heeling to the blast, were beating
through the yellow waves; the sky was low and dingy;
the hills of Cratloe rose on the other side in all their
bleak and barren wildness of attire. A harsh wind stirred
the dry and leafless woodbines that covered the front of
the cottage, and every object in the landscape seemed to
wear a characte of dreariness and discomfort.
Here he remained for several hours in the same dry and
stolid mood of reflection. Not a single tear, not a single
sound of sorrow, was added by him to the general clamour
of the household. He never before had been tried by an
occasion of this nature, and his present apathy filled him
with alarm and astonishment. He listened to the wail-
ings of the women and children, and he looked on the
moistened faces of those who hurried past his chair from
time to time, until he began to accuse himself of want of
feeling and affection.
While he sat thus silent, the door was opened, and
Lowry Looby thrust in his head to inform him that the
family were assembled to say a litany in the other room.
Kyrle rose, and proceeded thither without reply or ques-

tion, while Lowry, oppressed with grief, made his retreat
into the kitchen. Here he was met by the nurse, who
asked him for some halfpence, that she might lay them,
according to custom, on the lips and eyes of the corpse.
"I didn't like," she said, "to be tazing any o' the
family about it, an' they in throuble."
"Surely, surely," said Lowry, while he searched his
pockets for the coin. "Ah, nurse ! so that's the way ye
let her go between yel Oh, asthora, Mrs. Daly an''tis
I that lost the good misthress in you this day I Soft and
pleasant be your bed in Heaven this night ! An'so it
will. You never refused to feed the hungry here, an'
God won't refuse to feed you where you are gone. You
never turned the poor out o' your house in this world,
an' God won't turn you out of His house in the other.
Soft and pleasant be your bed in Heaven this night, Mrs.
Daly! Winny, eroo, wasn't it you that was telling me that
the misthress's three first childher died at nurse?"
Old Winny was sitting by the fireside, dandling the
now forgotten little infant in her arms, and lulling it with
an ancient ditty, of which the following beautiful frag-
ment formed the burthen :
"Gilli beg le m'onum thul
Gilli beg le m'chree I
Coth yani me von gilli beg,
'N heur ve thu more a creena.""
"They did," she said, in answer to Lowry's question,
"all before Master North-aist went off so fast as they
wor wained."
"See that l" said Lowry. "She criedI wasn't in
the family thenbut still I know she cried a pottle for
every one o' them. An'see how it is nowshe has them
three little angels waitin' to recaive her at the gate of
Heaven this day. Here is the money, nurse, an' I wish

make of it."
*"My soul's little darling you are 1
My heart's little darling !
What will I do without my little darling,
When you're grown up and old **
## p. 311 (#315) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 31 I
The nurse left the kitchen, and Lowry took his seat
upon the settle-bed, where he remained for some time,
looking downwards and striking the end of his walking-
stick against the floor, gently and at regular intervals.
The crying of the child disturbed his meditations, and he
frequently lifted his head, and stared with a look of stern
remonstrance at the unconscious innocent.
"The Lord forgive you, you little disciple !" said
Lowry, "'tis little you know what harm you done this
day ! Do all you cangrow up as fine as a queen, an'
talk like an angel'twill set you to fill up the place o' the
woman you took away from us this day. Howl your
tongue, again I tell you, 'tis we that have raison to cry, an'
not you."
The news of this unexpected visitation became diffused
throughout the country with a speed resembling that of
sound itself. Friend after friend dropped in as evening
fell, and the little parlour was crowded before midnight.
It was a dreadful night without, the same (it will be
remembered) on which Eily O'Connor left the cottage in
the Gap. The thunder clattered close overhead, the rain
fell down in torrents, and the reflection of the frequent
lightning flashes danced upon the glasses and bowl,
around which the company were seated in the parlour.
It was yet too soon for the report to have reached the
ears of the real friends of the family, whose condolence
might have been more efficacious than that of the hum-
bler crowd of distant relatives and dependents who were
now assembled in the house of mourning. Kyrle con-
sidered this, and yet he could not avoid a certain dreary
and desolate feeling, as he looked round upon the throng
of persons by whom their hearth was girded. But though
he could not receive from them the delicate condolence
which his equals might have afforded, their sympathy was
not less cordial and sincere.
The night passed away in silence and watching. A
few conversed in low whispers, and some pressed each
other, by signs, to drink; but this courtesy was for the
most part declined by a gathering of the brows and a
shake of the head. The grey and wintry morning found
## p. 312 (#316) ############################################
312 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
the dwelling thronged with pale, unwashed, and length-
ened faces. Some strayed out on the little lawn, to
breathe the river air. Others thronged the room of
death, where an early Mass was celebrated for the soul of
the departed. At intervals a solitary cry of pain and
grief was heard to break from some individual of the
crowd, but it was at once repressed by the guests, with
low sounds of anger and surprise. The family were silent
in their woe, and it was thought daring in a stranger to
usurp their prerogative of sorrow.
The arrivals were more frequent in the course of the
second evening, and a number of gigs, curricles, and out-
side jaunting-cars were laid by in the yard. No circum-
stance could more fully demonstrate the estimation in
which this family was held, than the demeanour of the
guests as they entered the house. Instead of the accus-
tomed ceremonials which friends use at meeting, they
recognised each other in silence and with reserve, as in a
house of worship. Sometimes a lifting of the eyelid and
a slight elevation of the hand, expressed their dismay and
their astonishment; and if they did exchange a whisper,
it was only to give expression to the same feeling. "It
was a dreadful loss I Poor man I What will become
of the children?"
About nightfall on the second evening, Kyrle was
standing at the window of the room in which the corpse
was laid out. The old nurse was lighting the candles that
were to burn on either side of the death-bed. The white
curtains were festooned with artificial roses, and a few
were scattered upon the counterpane. Kyrle was leaning
with his arm against the window-sash, and looking out
upon the river, when Mrs. O'Connell laid her hand upon
his shoulder.
"Kyrle," said she, "I wish you would speak to your
father, and make him go to bed to-night. It would be a
great deal too much for him to go without rest the two
aights successively."
"I have already spoken to him, aunt, and he has
promised me that he will retire early to his room. We
ought to be all obliged to you, aunt, for your attention;
## p. 313 (#317) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 3I3
it is in conjunctures like this that we discover our real
friends. I am only afraid that you will suffer from your
exertions. Could you not find somebody to attend to
the company to-night, while you are taking a little rest?"
"Oh I I am an old nurse-tender," said Mrs. O'Con-
nell. "I am accustomed to sit up. Do not think of me,
Kyrle."
She left the room, and Kyrle resumed his meditative
posture. Up to this moment he had not shed a single
tear, and the nurse was watching him, from time to time,
with an anxious and uneasy eye. As he remained look-
ing out, an old man, dressed in dark frieze, and with a
stooping gait, appeared upon the little avenue. The eye
of Kyrle rested on his figure, as he walked slowly forward,
assisting his aged limbs with a seasoned blackthorn stick.
He figured, involuntarily, to his own mind, the picture of
this poor old fellow in his cottage, taking his hat and
stick, and telling his family that he would "step over to
Mrs. Daly's wake." To Mrs. Daly's wake! His mother,
with whom he had dined on the Christmas Day just past,
in perfect health and security! The incident was slight,
but it struck the spring of nature in his heart. He turned
from the window, threw himself into a chair, extended
his arms, let his head hang back, and burst at once into
a loud and hysterical passion of grief.
Instantly the room was thronged with anxious figures.
All gathered around his chair with expressions of com-
passion and condolence.
"Come outcome out into the air, Masther Kyrle,"
said the nurse, while she added her tears to his. "Don't,
a'ra gal. Don't now, asthora ma chree. Oh! then, 'tis
little wondher you should feel your loss."
"Kyrle," said Mrs. O'Connell, in a voice nearly as
convulsive as his whom she sought to comfort, "remem-
ber your father, Kyrle ; don't disturb him."
"Let me aloneoh, let me alone, aunt Mary," re-
turned the young man, waving his hands, and turning
away his head, in deep suffering. "I tell you I shall die
if you prevent me." And he abandoned himself once
more to a convulsive fit of weeping.
## p. 314 (#318) ############################################
3I4 The COLLEEN BAWN.
"Let him alone, as he says," whimpered old Winny.
"I'm sure I thought it wasn't natural he should keep it
on his heart so long. It will do him good. Oh, vo, vo!
it is a frightful thing to hear a man crying."
Suddenly Mr. Daly appeared amid the group. He
walked up to Kyrle's chair, and took him by the arm.
The latter checked his feelings on the instant, and arose
with a calm and ready obedience. As they passed the
foot of the bed, the father and son paused, as if by a
consent of intelligence. They exchanged one silent glance,
and then flinging themselves each on the other's neck,
they wept long, loudly, and convulsively together. There
was no one now to interfere. No one dared at this
moment to assume the office of comforter, and every
individual acted the part of a principal in the affliction.
The general wail of sorrow which issued from the room
was once more echoed in the other parts of the dwelling,
and the winds bore it to the ear of Hardress Cregan, as
he approached the avenue.
-
CHAPTER XXXIII.
How HARDRESS MET A FRIEND OF EILY's AT THE
WAKE.
HE entered the house with the species of vulgar
resolution which a person feels who is conscious of
deserving a repulse, and determined to outface it; but
his bravery was wholly needless. Poor Kyrle was busy
now with other thoughts than those of Cregan's
treachery.
He was shown into the parlour, in which the gentlemen
were seated round the fire, and listening to the mournful
clamour which yet had hardly subsided in the distant
room. The table was covered with decanters of wine,
bowls of whisky-punch, and long glasses. A large turf
fire blazed in the grate, and Lowry Looby was just
`s

THE COLLEEN BAwN. 3I.5.
occupied in placing on the table a pair of plated candle-
sticks almost as long as himself. Mr. Barnaby Cregan,
Mr. Connolly, Doctor Leake, and several other gentlemen,
were seated at one side of the fire. On the other stood
a vacant chair, from which Mr. Daly had been sum-
moned a few minutes before by the voice of his son in
suffering.
A little farther back, on a row of chairs which was
placed along the wall, the children were seatedsome of
them with countenances touchingly dejected, and a few
of the very youngest appearing still more touchingly
unconscious of their misfortune. The remainder of the
circle (which, though widened to the utmost limit, com-
pletely filled the room) consisted of the more fortuneless
connections of the family, their tradesmen, and some of
the more comfortable class of tenants. One or two
persons took upon themselves the office of attending to
the company, supplying them with liquor, and manufac-
turing punch, according as the fountain was exhausted.
When Hardress appeared at the door, his eye met that
of Connolly, who beckoned to him in silence, and made
room for him upon his own chair. He took his place,
and looked round for some members of the family. It
was, perhaps, rather to his relief than disappointment,
that he could not discern Kyrle Daly or his father among
the company.
Shortly afterwards two or three clergymen made their
appearance, and were with difficulty accommodated with
places. While Hardress was occupied in perusing the
countenances of these last, he felt his arm grasped, and
turning round, received a nod of recognition, and a
handshake (such as was then in fashion) from Dr.
Leake.
"A dreadful occasion this, doctor," whispered Har-
dress.
The doctor shut his eyes, knit his brows, thrust out his
lips, and shook his head with an air of deep reproof.
Laying his hand familiarly on Hardress's knee, and
looking fixedly in his face, said:
"My dear Cregan, 'tis a warning'tis a warning to the

whole country. This is what comes of employing un-
scientific persons."
Some whispering conversation now proceeded amongst
the guests, which, however, was suddenly interrupted by
the appearance of Kyrle Daly at the parlour-door. He
walked across the room with that port of mournful ease
and dignity which men are apt to exhibit under any deep
emotion, and took possession of the vacant chair before
alluded to. Not forgetful in his affliction of the courtesy
of a host, he looked around to see what new faces had
entered during his absence. He recognised the clergy-
men, and addressed them with a calm, yet cordial
politeness.
"I hope," he said, smiling courteously, yet sadly, as he
looked upon the circle; "I hope the gentlemen will
excuse my father for his absence. He was anxious to
return, but I prevented him. I thought a second night's
watching would have been too severe a trial of his strength."
A general murmur of assent followed this appeal, and
the speaker, resting his forehead on his hand, was silent
for an instant.
"I wish you would follow his example, Kyrle," said Mr.
Cregan. "I am sure we can all take care of ourselves,
and you must want rest."
"It is madness," said Connolly, "for the living to
injure their health, when it can be of no possible use."
"Pray, do not speak of it," said Kyrle; "if I felt in
the least degree fatigued, I should not hesitate. Lowry,"
he added, calling to his servant, who started and turned
round on his heel, with a serious eagerness that would at
any other time have been comic in its effect"Lowry,
will you tell Mrs. O'Connell to send in some teaf Some
of the gentlemen may wish to take it."
Lowry disappeared, and Kyrle relapsed into his attitude
of motionless dejection. A long silence ensued, the guests
conversing only by secret whispers, signs, and gestures,
and significant contortions of the face. It was once more
broken by Kyrle, who, looking at Mr. Cregan, said, in a
restrained and steady voice: "Has Hardress returned
from Killarney yet, Mr. Cregan?"

Hardress felt his blood rush through his veins, like that
of a convict, when he hears from the bench those fearful
words: "Bring him up for judgment " He made a slight
motion in his chair, while his father answered the ques
tion of Kyrle.
"Hardress is here," said Mr. Cregan; "he came while
you were out?"
"Here ! is he? I ought to be ashamed of myself."
said Kyrle, rising slowly from his chair, and meeting his
old friend half-way with an extended hand. They looked
to the eye of the guests, pale, cold, and passionless, like
two animated corpses. "But Hardress," continued Kyrle,
with a ghastly lip, "will excuse me, I hope. Did you
leave Mrs. Cregan well?"
"Quite well," muttered Hardress, with a confused
bow.
"I am glad of it," returned Kyrle, in the same tone of
calm, dignified, and yet mournful politeness. "You are
fortunate, Hardress, in that. If I had met you yesterday,
I would have answered a similar question with the same
confidence. And see how short 22
A sudden passion choked his utterance, he turned.
aside, and both the young men resumed their seats in
silence.
There was something to Hardress infinitely humiliating
in this brief interview. The manner of Kyrle Daly, as it
regarded him, was merely indifferent. It was not cordial,
for then it must necessarily have been hypocritical, but
neither could he discern the slightest indication of a
resentful feeling. He saw that Kyrle Daly was perfectly
aware of his treason; he saw that his esteem and friend-
ship were utterly extinct; and he saw, likewise, that he
had formed the resolution of never exchanging with him
a word of explanation or reproach, and of treating him
in future as an indifferent acquaintance, who could not be
esteemed, and ought to be avoided. This calm avoid-
ance was the stroke that cut him to the quick.
Lowry now entered with tea, and a slight movement
took place amongst the guests. Many left their places,
and order being restored, Hardress found himself placed

3.18 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
between two strangers, of a rank more humble than his
own. He continued to sip his tea for some time in
silence, when a slight touch on his arm made him turn
round. He beheld on his right an old man dressed in
dark frieze, with both hands crossed on the head of his
walking-stick, his chin resting upon them, and his eye
fixed upon Hardress, with an air of settled melancholy.
It was the same old man, whose appearance in the
avenue had produced so deep an effect on Kyrle Daly
Mihil O'Connor, the rope-maker.
"I beg your pardon, sir," he said gently; "but I think
I have seen your face somewhere before now. Did you
ever spend an evening at Garryowen P"
If, as he turned on his chair, the eye of Hardress had
encountered that of the corpse, which now lay shrouded
and coffined in the other room, he could not have experi-
enced a more sudden revulsion of affright. He did not
answer the question of the old man (his father-in-lawl the
plundered parent!), but remained staring and gaping on
him in silence. Old Mihil imagined that he was at a loss,
and labouring to bestir his memory. "Don't you remem-
ber, sir," he added, "on a Patrick's Eve, saving an old
man and a girl from a parcel o' the boys in Mungret
Street?"
"I do," answered Hardress in a low and hoarse voice.
"I thought I remembered the face and the make,"
returned Mihil. "Well, sir, I'm that same old man, and
many's the time, since that night, that I wished (if it
was Heaven's will) that both she and I had died that
night upon the spot together. I wished that when you
seen us that time you passed us by and never rig a hand
to save usalways if it was Heaven's will, for I'm sub-
missive; the will of Heaven be done, for I'm a great
sinner, and I deserved great punishment, and great
punishment I got; great punishment that's laid on my
old heart this night !"
"I pity you!" muttered Hardress, involuntarily. "I
pity you, although you may not think it."
"For what?" exclaimed the old man, still in a whisper,
elevating his person, and planting his stick upright upon
## p. 319 (#323) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 3I9
the floor. "For what would you pity me? You know
nothing about me, man, that you'd pity me for. If I
was to tell you my story, you'd pity me, I know ; for
there isn't that man living, with a heart in his breast,
that wouldn't feel it. But I won't tell it to you, sir. I'm
tired of telling it, that's what I am. I'm tired of talking
of it, an' thinking of it, an' dreaming of it, an' I wisht I
was in my grave, to be done with it for ever for a story
always, always," he added, lifting his eyes in devout
fear"always, if it was Heaven's will. Heaven forgi'
me! I say what I oughtn't to say, sometimes, thinkin'
Of it."
"I understand," muttered Hardress incoherently. The
old man did not hear him.
"An' still, for all," Mihil added, after a pause, "as I
spoke of it at all, I'll tell you something of it. That girl
you saw that night with meshe was a beautiful little
girl, sir, wasn't she?"
"Do you think so?" Hardress murmured, still without
knowing what he said.
"Do I think so?" echoed the father with a grim smile.
"It's little matter what her father thought. The world
knew her for a beauty, but what was the good of it?
She left me there; afther that night, an' went off with a
stranger."
Hardress again said something, but it resembled only
the delirious murmurs of a person on the rack.
"Oh, vo, Eily that night, that woeful night !" con-
tinued the old man. "I'm ashamed o' myself, to be
always this way, like an ould woman, moaning and
ochoning among the neighbours; like an ould goose,
that would be cackling afther the flock, or a fool of a
little bird, whistling upon a bough of a summer evening,
afther the nest is robbed."
"How close this room is l'' said Hardress; "the heat
is suffocating."
"I thought at first," continued Mihil, "that it is dead
she was, but a letther come to a neighbour o' mine to let
me know that she was alive and hearty. I know how it
was. Some villyan that enticed her off. I sent the

neighbour westwards to look afther her, an' I thought he'd
be back to-day, but he isn't. I tould him to call at my
brother's, the priest's, in Castle Island. Sure, he writes
me word, he seen her himself of a Christmas Day last,
an' that she tould him she was married, and coming
home shortly. Ayeh, I'm afraid the villyan decaived
her, an' that she is not rightly married; for I made it my
business to inquire of every priest in town and counthry,
an' none of 'em could tell me a word about it. She
decaived me, an' I'm afeerd he's decaivin' her. There
let him! there let him! But there's a throne in Heaven,
and there's One upon it; an' that man, an' my daughter,
an' I will stand together before that throne one day !"
"Let me go!" cried Hardress aloud, and breaking from
the circle with violence. "Let me go! let me go!can
any one bear this?"
Such an incident, amid the general silence, and on this
solemn occasion, could not fail to produce a degree of
consternation amongst the company. Kyrle looked up
with an expression of strong feeling. "What's the matter?"
"What has happened?" was asked by several voices.
"It is highly indecorous." "It is very unfeeling," was
added by many more.
Hardress stayed not to hear their observations, but
struggled through the astonished crowd, and reached the
door. Kyrle, after looking in vain for an explanation,
once more leaned down with his forehead on his hand,
and remained silent.
"He's a good young gentleman," said Mihil O'Con-
nor, looking after Hardress and addressing those who
sat around him. "I was telling him the story of my
daughter. He's a good young gentlemanhe has great
nature."
The unfortunate Hardress in the meantime strayed
onward through the hall of the cottage, with the feeling
of a man who has just escaped from the hands of justice.
He entered another room appropriate to the female
guests, where Mrs. O'Connell presided at the tea-table.
The gradation of ranks in this apartment was similar to
that in the other, but the company were not quite so
## p. 321 (#325) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 32 I
scrupulous in the maintenance of silence. A general and
very audible whispering conversation was carried on, in
which a few young gentlemen, who were sprinkled among
the ladies, took no inactive part. A hush, of some
moments' duration, took place on the entrance of Har-
dress, and a hundred curious eyes were turned on his
figure. His extreme paleness, the wildness of his eyes,
and the ghastly attempt at courtesy which he made as
he entered, occasioned a degree of general surprise. He
passed on, and took his seat by the side of Mrs. O'Con-
nell, who, like Mihil, placed his agitation to the account
of sympathy, and entered him at once upon her list of
favourites.
A number of young ladies were seated on the right of
this good lady, and at a distance from the long table,
round which were placed a number of females of an
humbler rank, dressed out in all their finery, and doing
honour to Mrs. O'Connell's tea and coffee. One or two
young gentlemen were waiting on the small circle of
ladies, who sat apart near the fire, with tea, cakes, toast, etc.
The younger of the two, a handsome lad, of a cultivated
figure, seemed wholly occupied in showing off his grace
and gallantry. The other, a grave wag, strove to amuse
the ladies by paying a mock ceremonious attention to the
tradesmen's wives and daughters at the other side of the
fire, and to amuse himself by provoking the ladies to
laugh.
Revolutions in private, as in public life, are occasions
which call into action the noblest and meanest principles
of our naturethe extremes of generosity and of selfish-
ness. As Lowry Looby took away the tea-service, he
encountered, in the hall and kitchen, a few sullen and
discontented faces. Some complained that they had not
experienced the slightest attention since their arrival, and
others declared they had not got "as much as one cup
o' tay."
"Why then, mend ye " said Lowry, "why didn't ye
call for it? Do you think people that's in trouble that
way, has nothin' else to do but to be thinkin' o' ye an'
o' yer aitin' an' drinkin'? What talk it is . There's
x

322 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
people in this world, I b'lieve, that thinks more o' their
own little finger than o' the lives an' fortunes o' all the
rest."
So saying, he took a chair before the large kitchen
fire, which, like those in the two other apartments, was
surrounded by a class of watchers. On a wooden form at
one side, were seated the female servants of the house, and
opposite to them the hearse-driver, the mutes, the drivers
of two or three hack-carriages, and one or two of the
gentlemen's servants. The table was covered with bread,
jugs of punch, and Cork porter. A few, exhausted by the
preceding night's watching and overpowered by the heat
of the fire, were lying asleep in various postures, on the
settle-bed at the farther end.
"'Twill be a good funeral," said the hearse-driver,
laying aside the mug of porter, from which he had just
taken a refreshing draught.
"If it isn't, it ought," said Lowry; "they're people,
sir, that are well known in the counthry."
"Surely, surely," said one of the hack-coachmen, taking
a pipe from the corner of his mouth, "an' well liked, too,
by all accounts."
A moan from the females gave a mournful assent to
this proposition.
"Ah, she was a queen of a little woman," said Lowry.
"She was too good for this world. Oh, vo! where's the
use o' talking at all ! Sure 'twas only a few days since I
was saltin' the bacon at the table over, an' she standin' a
near me, knitting. "I'm afraid, Lowry,' says she, "we
won't find that bacon enough; I'm sorry I didn't get
another o' them pigs killed." Little she thought that time
that they'd outlast herself. She never lived to see 'em in
pickle !"
A pause of deep affliction followed this speech, which
was once more broken by the hearse-driver.
"The grandest funeral," said he, "that ever I see in
my life, was that of the Marquis of Watherford, father to
the present man. It was a sighth for a king. There was
six men marching out before the hearse, with goold sticks
in their hands, an' as much black silk about 'em as a lady.
## p. 323 (#327) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 323
The coffin was covered all over with black velvet an'
goold, an' there was his name above upon the top of it,
on a great goold plate intirely, that was shining like the
sun. I never seen such a sighth before nor since.
There was forty-six carriages after the hearse, an' every
one of 'em belonging to a lord, or an estated man at
the laste. It flogged all the shows I ever see since I was
able to walk the ground."
The eyes of the whole party were fixed in admiration
upon the speaker, while he made the above oration with
much importance of look and gesture. Lowry, who felt
that poor Mrs. Daly's funeral must necessarily shrink
into insignificance in comparison with this magnificent
description, endeavoured to diminish its effect upon the
imaginations of the company by a few philosophical
remarks.
"'Twas a great funeral, surely, he began.
"Great l" exclaimed the hearse-driver; "it was worth
walking to Watherford to see it."
"Them that has money," added Lowry, "can easily
find means to sport it. An'still, for all, now, sir, if a man
was to look into the rights o' the thing, what was the good
o' all that? What was the good of it for him that was in
the hearse, or for them that worafther it? The Lord
save us, it isn't what goold and silver they had upon
their hearses, they'll be axed where they are going; only
what use they made of the goold an' silver that was given
them in this world. Tisn't how many carriages was
afther 'em, but how many good actions went before 'em ;
nor how they were buried, they'll be axed, but how they
lived. Them are the questions, the Lord save us, that'll
be put to us all, one day; an' them are the questions
that Mrs. Daly could answer this night as well as the
Marquis of Watherford, or any other lord or marquis in
the land."
The appeal was perfectly successful: the procession
of the marquis, the gold sticks, the silks, the velvet,
and the forty-six carriages were forgotten; the hearse-
driver resumed his mug of porter, and the remainder of
the company returned to their silence and dejection.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
HOW THE WAKE CONCLUDED.
It was intended that the funeral should proceed at day-
break. Towards the close of a hurried breakfast, which
the guests took by candle-light, the tinkling of a small
silver bell summoned them to an early Mass, which was
being celebrated in the room of the dead. As Hardress
obeyed its call, he found the apartment already crowded,
and a number of the domestics and other dependents
of the family kneeling at the door and in the hall. The
low murmur of the clergyman's voice was only interrupted
occasionally by a faint moan, or a short, thick Sob, heard
amid the crowd. The density of the press around the
door prevented Hardress from ascertaining the indivi-
duals from whom those sounds of affliction proceeded.
When the ceremony had concluded, and when the
room became less thronged, he entered and took his place
near the window. There was some whispering between
Mrs. O'Connell, his father, Hepton Connolly, and one or
two other friends of the family. They were endeavouring
to contrive some means for withdrawing Kyrle and his
father from the apartment, while the most mournful crisis
of this domestic calamity was carried onthe removal of
the coffin from the dwelling of its perished inmate. Mr.
Daly seemed to have some suspicion of an attempt of this
kind, for he had taken his seat close by the bed's head,
and sat erect in his chair, with a look of fixed and even
gloomy resolution.
Kyrle was standing at the head of the coffin, his arms
crossed upon the bed, his face buried between them, and
his whole frame as motionless as that of one in a deep
slumber. The priest was unvesting himself at the table
near the window, which had been elevated a little, so
as to serve for an altar. The clerk was n his side,
## p. 325 (#329) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 325
placing the chalice, altar-cloths, and vestments in a
large ticken-bag, according as they were folded. A few
old women still remained kneeling at the foot of the bed,
rocking their persons from side to side, and often striking
their bosoms with the cross of the long rosary. The
candles were now almost burning down and smouldering
in their sockets, and the winter dawn, which broke
through the open window, was gradually overmastering
their yellow and imperfect light.
"Kyrle," said Hepton Connolly in a whisper, touching
the arm of the afflicted son, "come with me into the
parlour for an instant; I want to speak to you."
Kyrle raised his head, and stared on the speaker, like
one who suddenly wakes from a long sleep. Connolly
took him by the sleeve, with an urgent look, and led him
passively out of the apartment.
Mr. Daly saw the manoeuvre, but he did not appear to
notice it. He kept the same rigid, set position, and
looked straightforwards with the same determined and
unwinking glance as if he feared the slightest movement
might unhinge his resolution.
"Daly," said Mr. Cregan, advancing to his side, "Mr.
Neville, the clergyman, wishes to speak with you in the
middle room."
"I will not leave this 1" said the widower, in a low,
short, and muttering voice, while his eyes filled up with a
gloomy fire, and his manner resembled that of a tigress
who suspects some invasion of her young, but endeavours
to conceal that suspicion until the first stroke is made
"I will not stir from this, sir, if you please."
Mr. Cregan turned away at once, and cast a despond-
ing look at Mrs. O'Connell. That lady lowered her
eyelids significantly, and glanced at the door. Mr.
Cregan at once retired, beckoning to his son that he
might follow him.
Mrs. O'Connell now took upon herself the task which
had proved so complete a failure in the hands of Mr.
Cregan. She leaned over her brother's chair, laid her
hand on his, and said in an earnest voice:-"Charles,
will you come with me to the parlour for one moment?"
## p. 326 (#330) ############################################
326 THE COLLEEN BAWn.
"I will not," replied Mr. Daly, in the same hoarse
tone"I will not go, ma'am, if you please."
Mrs. O'Connell pressed his hand, and stooped over
his shoulder. "Charles," she continued, with increasing
earnestness, "will you refuse me this request?"
"If you please," said the bereaved husband, "I will
not goindeed, ma'am, I won't stir "
"Now is the time, Charles, to show that you can be
resigned. I feel for youindeed, I dobut you must
deny yourself. Remember your duty to Heaven, and
to your children, and to yourself. Come with me, my
dear Charles."
The old man trembled violently, turned round on his
chair, and fixed his eyes upon his sister.
"Mary," said he, with a broken voice, "this is the last
half-hour that I shall ever spend with Sally in this
world, and do not take me from her."
"I would not," said the good lady, unable to restrain
her tears; "I would not, my dear Charles. But you
know her well. You know how she would act if she
were in your place. Act that way, Charles, and that is
the greatest kindness you can show to Sally now."
"Take me where you please," cried the old man,
stretching out his arms, and bursting into a fit of convulsive
weeping. "Oh, Sally " he exclaimed, turning round,
and stretching his arms towards the coffin, as he reached
the door"Oh, Sally I is this the way that we are parted,
after all? This day, I thought your friends would have
been visiting you and your babe in health and happiness.
They are come to visit you, my darling, but it is in your
coffin, not in your bed, they find you ! They are come,
not to your babe's christening, but to your own funeral.
For the last time now, good-bye, my darling Sally. It
is not now to say good-bye for an hour, or good-bye for
a day, or for a weekbut for ever and for ever. God be
with you, Sally I For ever, and for ever ! They are
little words, Mary!" he added, turning to his weeping
sister, "but there's a deal of grief in them. Well, now,
Sally, my days are done for this world. It is time for me
now to think of a better life. I am satisfied. Far be it
## p. 327 (#331) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 327
from me to murmur. My life was too happy, Mary, and
I was becoming too fond of it. This will teach me to
despise a great many things that I valued highly until
yesterday, and to warn my children to despise them like-
wise. I believe, Mary, if everything in this world went
on as we could wish, it might tempt us to forget that
there was another before us. This is my comfort, and it
must be my comfort now for evermore. Take me where
you please now, Mary, and let them take her, too,
wherever they desire. Oh! Sally, my poor love, it is not
to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the day after, that I shall feel
your loss; but when weeks and months are gone by, and
when I am sitting all alone by the fire-side, or when I am
talking of you to my orphan children. It is then, Sally, that
I shall feel what happened yesterday ! That is the time
when I shall think of you, and of all our happy days,
until my heart is breaking in my bosom l'"
These last sentences the old man spoke standing erect,
with his hands clenched and trembling above his head,
his eyes filled up and fixed on the coffin, and every
feature swollen and quivering with strong emotion. As
he concluded, he sank exhausted by the passionate lament
upon the shoulder of his sister.
Almost at the same instant, little Sally came peeping in
at the door, with a face of innocent wonder and timidity.
Mrs. O'Connell, with the quick feeling of a woman, took
advantage of the incident to create a diversion in the
mind of her brother.
"My dear Charles," she said, "do try and conquer this
dejection. You will not be so lonely as you think. Look
there, Charles; you have got a Sally still to care for
ou."
y The aged father glanced a quick eye around him, and
met the sweet and simple gaze of the little innocent, up-
turned to seek his own. He shook his sister's hand
forcibly, and said with vehemence:
"Mary, Mary 1 I thank you! From my heart I am
obliged to you for this 1" - -
He caught the little child to his breast, devoured it
with kisses and murmurs of passionate fondness, and

328 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
hurried with it, as with a treasure, to a distant part of the
dwelling.
Mr. Cregan, in the meanwhile, had been engaged, at
the request of Mrs. O'Connell, in giving out the gloves,
scarfs, and cypresses, in the room which, on the preceding
night, had been allotted to the female guests. In this
matter, too, the selfishness of some unworthy individuals
was made to appear, in their struggles for precedence, and
in their dissatisfaction at being neglected in the allotment
of the funeral favours. In justice, however, it should be
stated, that the number of those unfeeling individuals was
inconsiderable.
The last and keenest trial was now begun. The coffin
was borne on the shoulders of men to the hearse, which
was drawn up at the hall-door. The hearse-driver had
taken his seat, the mourners were already in the carriages,
and a great crowd of horsemen and people on foot were
assembled around the front of the house, along the avenue,
and on the road. The female servants of the family were
dressed in scarfs and huge head-dresses of white linen.
The house-maid and Winny sat on the coffin, and three
or four followed on an outside jaunting-car. In this order
the procession began to move; and the remains of this
kind mistress, and affectionate wife and parent, were
borne away for ever from the mansion which she had
blessed so many years by her gentle government.
The scene of desolation which prevailed from the time
at which the coffin was first taken from the room, until
the whole procession had passed out of sight, it would be
a vain effort to describe. The shrieks of the women and
children pierced the ears and the hearts of the multitude.
Every room presented a picture of affliction. Female
igures flying to and fro, with expanded arms, and cries
of heart-broken sorrow; children weeping and sobbing
aloud in each other's arms; men clenching their hands
close, and stifling the strong sympathy that was making
battle for loud utterance in their breasts; and the low
groans of exhausted agony which proceeded from the
mourning coaches that held the father, Kyrle Daly, and
the two nearest sons. In the midst of these affecting
## p. 329 (#333) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 329
sounds, the hearse began to move, and was followed to a
long distance on its way by the wild lament that broke
from the open doors and windows of the now forsaken
dwelling.
"Oh, misthress l'exclaimed Lowry Looby, as he stood
at the avenue gate, clapping his hands and weeping,
while he gazed, not without a sentiment of melancholy
pride, on the long array which lined the uneven road, and
saw the black hearse-plumes becoming indistinct in the
distance, while the rear of the funeral train was yet passing
him by"Oh, misthress I misthress I 'tis now I see that
you are gone in airnest. I never would believe that you
wor lost, until I saw your coffin goin' out o' the doores!"
From the date of this calamity a change was observed
to have taken place in the characters and manners of this
amiable family. . The war of instant affliction passed
away, but it left deep and perceptible traces in the house-
hold. The Dalys became more grave and more religious;
their tone of conversation of a deeper turn, and the
manner, even of the younger children, more staid and
thoughtful. Their natural mirth (the child of good-
nature and conscious innocence of heart) was not extin-
guished: the flame lit up again as time rolled on, but it
burned with a calmer, fainter, and perhaps a purer
radiance. Their merriment was frequent and cordial, but
it never again was boisterous. With the unhappy father,
however, the case was different. He never rallied; the
harmony of his existence was destroyed, and he seemed
to have lost all interest in those occupations of rural
industry which had filled up a great proportion of his time
from boyhood. Still, from a feeling of duty, he was exact
and diligent in the performance of those obligations, but
he executed them as a task, not as a pleasure. He might
still be found at morning superintending his workmen at
their agricultural employments, but he did not join so
heartily as of old in the merry jests and tales which
made their labour light. It seemed as if he had, on that
morning, touched the perihelium of his existence, and
from that hour the warmth and sunshine of his course was
destined to decline from day to day.

CHAPTER XXXV.
HOW HARDRESS AT LENGTH RECEIVED SOME NEWS OF
EILY.
THE marriage of Hardress Cregan and Anne Chute was
postponed for some time in consequence of the affliction
of their old friends. Nothing, in the meantime, was
heard of Eily or her escort; and the remorse and the
suspense endured by Hardress began to affect his mind
and health in a degree that excited great alarm in both
families. His manner to Anne still continued the same
as before they were contracted; now tender, passionate,
and full of an intense affection, and now sullen, short,
intemperate, and gloomy. Her feeling, too, towards him,
continued still unchanged. His frequent unkindness
pained her to the soul, but she attributed all to a natural
or acquired weakness of temper, and trusted to time and
to her own assiduous gentleness to cure it. He had yet
done nothing to show himself unworthy of her esteem,
and while this continued to be the case, her love could
not be shaken by mere infirmities of manner, the result,
probably, of his uncertain health, for which he had her
pity, rather than resentment.
But on Mrs. Cregan it produced a more serious im
pression. In her frequent conversations with her son, he
had, in the agony of his heart, betrayed the workings of
a deeper passion and a darker recollection than she had
ever imagined possible. It became evident to her, from
many hints let fall in his paroxysms of anxiety, that Har-
dress had done something to put himself within the
power of outraged justice, as well as that of an avenging
conscience. From the moment on which she arrived at
this discovery, she avoided as much as possible all farther
conversation on those topics with her son, and it was
observed that she, too, had become subject to fits of
abstraction and of seriousness in her general manner.

While the fortunes of the family remained thus sta-
tionary, the day arrived on which Hepton Connolly was
to give his hunting-dinner. Hardress looked forward to
this occasion with some satisfaction, in the hope that it
would afford a certain degree of relief to his mind, under
its present state of depression; and when the morning
came, he was one of the earliest men upon the ground.
The fox was said to have kennelled in the side of a hill
near the river-side, which on one side was grey with lime-
stone crag, and on the other covered with a quantity of
close furze. Towards the water, a miry and winding path
among the underwood led downward to an extensive
marsh or corcass, which lay close to the shore. It was
overgrown with a dwarfish rush, and intersected with
numberless little creeks and channels, which were never
filled, except when the spring-tide was at the full. On a
green and undulating champaign above the hill, were a
considerable number of gentlemen mounted, conversing
in groups, or cantering their horses around the plain,
while the huntsman, whippers-in, and dogs, were busy
among the furze, endeavouring to make the fox break
cover. A crowd of peasants, boys, and other idlers,
were scattered over the green, awaiting the commence-
ment of the sport, and amusing themselves by criticising,
with much sharpness of sarcasm, the appearance of the
horses, and the action and manners of their riders.
The search after the fox continued for a long time
without avail. The gentlemen became impatient, began
to look at their watches, and to cast from time to time
an apprehensive glance at the heavens. This last move-
ment was not without a cause; the morning, which had
promised fairly, began to change and darken. It was one
of those sluggish days which frequently usher in the
spring season in Ireland. On the water, on land, in air,
on earth, everything was motionless and calm. The boats
slept on the bosom of the river. A low and dingy mist
concealed the distant shores and hills of Clare. Above,
the eye could discern neither cloud nor sky. A heavy
haze covered the face of the heavens, from one horizon
to the other. The sun was wholly veiled in mist, his

place in the heavens being indicated only by the radiance
of the misty shroud in that direction. A thin, drizzling
shower, no heavier than a summer dew, descended on
the party, and left a hoary and glistening moisture on
their dresses, on the manes and forelocks of the horses,
and on the face of the surrounding landscape.
"No fox to-day, I fear," said Mr. Cregan, riding up to
one of the groups before mentioned, which comprised
his son Hardress and Mr. Connolly. "At what time,"
he added, addressing the latter, "did you order dinner?
I think there is little fear of our being late for it."
"You all deserve this," said a healthy-looking old
gentleman, who was one of the group; "feather-bed
sportsmen every one of you. I rode out to-day from
Limerick myself, was at home before seven, went out to
see the wheat shaken in, and on arriving on the ground
at ten, found no one there but this young gentleman,
whose thoughts seem to be hunting on other ground at
this moment. When I was a young man, daybreak never
found me napping that way."
"Good people are scarce," said Connolly; "it is right
we should take care of ourselves. Hardress, will you
canter this way?"
"He is cantering elsewhere," said the same old gentle-
man, looking on the absent boy. "Mind that sigh. Ah!
she had the heart of a stone."
"I suspect he is thinking of his dinner, rather," said
his father.
"If Miss Chute had asked him to make a circuit with
her," said Connolly, "she would not have found it so
hard to get an answer."
"Courage, sir," exclaimed the old gentleman, "she is
neither wed nor dead."
"Dead, did you say?" cried Hardress, starting from
his reverie. "Who says it? Ahl I see."
A burst of laughter from the gentlemen brought the
young man to his recollection, and his head sunk in
silence and confusion.
"Come, Hardress," continued Connolly, "although
you are not in love with me, yet we may try a canter to-

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 333
gether. Hark! What is that? What are the dogs doing
now P"
"They have left the cover on the hill," cried a gentle-
man, who was galloping past, "and are trying the
corcass."
"Poor Dalton 1" said Mr. Cregan, "that was the man
that would have had old Reynard out of cover before now."
"Poor Dalton l'exclaimed Hardress, catching up the
word with passionate emphasis, "poorpoor Dalton I
Oh, days of my youth !" he added, turning aside on his
saddle, that he might not be observed, and looking out
upon the quiet river, "Oh, dayspast, happy days I my
merry boyhood, and my merry youth I my boat I the
broad river, the rough west wind, the broken waves, and
the heart at rest Oh, miserable wretch! what have you
now to hope for? My heart will burst before I leave this
field I?"
"The dogs are chopping," said Connolly; "they have
found him. Come 1 come away "
"'Tis a false scent," said the old gentleman. "Ware
hare l'"
"Ware hare 1" was echoed by many voices. A singu-
lar hurry was observed amongst the crowd upon the brow
of the hill, which overlooked the corcass, and presently
all descended to the marsh.
"There is something extraordinary going forward," said
Cregan; "what makes all the crowd collect upon the
marsh P"
A pause ensued, during which Hardress experienced a
degree of nervous anxiety for which he could not account.
The hounds continued to chop in concert, as if they had
found a strong scent, and yet no fox appeared.
At length a horseman was observed riding up the miry
pass before mentioned, and galloping towards them.
When he approached, they could observe that his manner
was flurried and agitated, and his countenance wore an
expression of terror and compassion. He tightened the
rein suddenly, as he came upon the group.
"Mr. Warner," he said, addressing the old gentleman
already alluded to, "I believe you are a magistrate P"
## p. 334 (#338) ############################################
334 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Mr. Warner bowed.
"Then come this way, sir, if you please. A terrible
occasion makes your presence necessary on the other side
of the hill."
"No harm, sir, to any of our friends, I hope?" said
Mr. Warner, putting spurs to his horse, and galloping
away. The answer of the stranger was lost in the tramp
of the hoofs, as they rode away.
Immediately after, two other horsemen came galloping
by. One of them held in his hand a straw bonnet, beaten
out of shape, and draggled in the mud of the corcass.
Hardress just caught the word "horrible," as they rode
swiftly by.
"What's horrible?" shouted Hardress, rising on his
stirrup.
The two gentlemen were already out of hearing. He
sunk down again on his seat, and glanced aside at his
father and Connolly. "What does he call horrible P" he
repeated.
"I did not hear him," said Connolly. "Come down
upon the corcass, and we shall learn."
They galloped in that direction. The morning was
changing fast, and the rain was now descending in much
greater abundance. Still there was not a breath of wind
to alter its direction, or to give the slightest animation to
the general lethargic look of nature. As they arrived on
the brow of the hill, they perceived the crowd of horse-
men and peasants collected into a dense mass around one
of the little channels before described. Several of those in
the centre were stooping low, as if to assist a fallen person.
The next rank, with their heads turned aside over their
shoulders, were employed in answering the questions of
those behind them. The individuals who stood outside
were raised on tiptoe, and endeavoured, by stretching their
heads over the shoulders of their neighbours, to peep into
the centre. The whipper-in, meanwhile, was flogging the
hounds away from the crowd, while the dogs reluctantly
obeyed. Mingled with the press were the horsemen,
bending over their saddle-bows, and gazing downward on
the centre.
## p. 335 (#339) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 335
"Bad manners to ye!" Hardress heard the whipper-in
exclaim, as he passed, "what a fox ye found us this
morning. How bad ye are, now, for a taste o' Christian's
flesh l'"
As he approached nearer to the crowd, he was enabled
to gather farther indications of the nature of the transac-
tion, from the countenance and gestures of the people.
Some had their hands elevated in strong fear, many brows
were knitted in eager curiosity, some raised in wonder,
and some expanded in affright. Urged by an unaccount-
able impulse, and supported by an energy, he knew not
whence derived, Hardress alighted from his horse, threw
the reins to a countryman, and penetrated the group with
considerable violence. He dragged some by the collars
from their places, pushed others aside with his shoulder,
struck those who proved refractory with his whip-handle,
and in a few moments attained the centre of the ring.
Here he paused, and gazed in motionless horror
upon the picture which the crowd had previously con-
cealed.
A small space was kept clear in the centre. Opposite
to Hardress stood Mr. Warner, the magistrate and coroner
of the county, with a small note-book in his hand, in
which he made some entries with a pencil. On his right
stood the person who had summoned him to the spot.
At the feet of Hardress was a small pool, in which the
waters now appeared disturbed and thick with mud, while
the rain, descending straight, gave to its surface the sem-
blance of ebullition.
On the bank at the other side, which was covered with
sea-pink and a species of short moss peculiar to the soil,
an object lay on which the eyes of all were bent with a
fearful and gloomy expression. It was for the most part
concealed beneath a large bluemantle, which was drenched
in wet and mire, and lay so heavy on the thing beneath
as to reveal the lineaments of a human form. A pair of
small feet, in Spanish-leather shoes, appearing from below
the end of the garment, showed that the body was that
of a female; and a mass of long, fair hair, which escaped
from beneath the capacious hood, demonstrated that this

death, whether the effect of accident or malice, had found
the victim untimely in her youth.
The cloak, the feet, the hair, all were familiar objects to
the eye of Hardress. On very slight occasions, he had
often found it absolutely impossible to maintain his self-
possession in the presence of others. Now, when the full
solution of all his anxieties was exposed before him;
now, when it became evident that the guilt of blood was
upon his head; now, when he looked upon the shattered
corpse of Eily, of his chosen and once beloved wife,
murdered in her youth, almost in her girlhood, by his
connivance, it astonished him to find that all emotion
came upon the instant to a dead pause within his breast.
Others might have told him that his face was rigid, sallow,
and bloodless as that of the corpse on which he gazed.
But he himself felt nothing of this. Not a sentence that
was spoken was lost upon his ear. He did not even
tremble, and a slight anxiety for his personal safety was
the only sentiment of which he was perceptibly conscious.
It seemed as if the great passion, like an engine embar-
rassed in its action, had been suddenly struck motion-
less, even while the impelling principle remained in active
force.
"Has the horse and car arrived?" asked Mr. Warner,
while he closed his note-book. "Can any one see it
coming? We shall all be drenched to the skin before we
get away."
"Can we not go to the nearest inn, and proceed with
the inquest," said a gentleman in the crowd, "while some
one stays behind to see the body brought after?"
"No, sir," said Mr. Warner, with some emphasis,
"the inquest must be held super visum corporis, or it is
worth nothing."
"Warner," whispered Connolly to Cregan, with a smile,
"is afraid of losing his four-guinea fee. He will not let
the body out of his sight."
"You know the proverb," returned Cregan, "a bird in
the hand,' etc. What a fine fat fox he has caught this
morning !"
At this moment the hounds once more opened in a
## p. 337 (#341) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 337
chopping concert; and Hardress, starting from his posture
of rigid calmness, extended his arms, and burst at once
into a passion of wild fear.
"The hounds ! the hounds !" he exclaimed. "Mr.
Warner, do you hear them? Keep off the dogs | They
will tear her if ye let them pass 1 Good sir, will you
suffer the dogs to tear her? I had rather be torn myself,
than look upon such a sight. Ye may stare as ye will, but
I tell you all a truth, gentlemen. A truth, I say, upon
my life, a truth !"
"There is no fear," said Warner, fixing a keen eye
upon him. -
"Ay, but there is, sir, by your leave," cried Hardress.
"Do you hear them now? Do you hear that yell for
blood? I tell you I hate that horrid cry. It is enough
to make the heart of a Christian burst. Who put the
hounds upon that horrid scentthat false scent? I am
going mad, I think. I say, sir, do you hear that yelling
now P Will you tell me now there is no fear? Stand
close ! Stand close, and hide meher, I mean. Stand
close !"
"I think there is none whatever," said the coroner,
probing him.
"And I tell you," cried Hardress, grasping his whip,
and abandoning himself to an almost delirious excess of
rage, "I tell you there is. If this ground should open
before me, and I should hear the hounds of Satan yelling
upward from the deep, it could not freeze me with a
greater fear ! But, sir, you can pursue what course you
please," continued Hardress, bowing and forcing a smile;
"you are here in office, sir. You are at liberty to
contradict as you please, sir; but I have my remedy.
You know me, sir, and I know you. I am a gentleman.
Expect to hear farther from me on this subject."
So saying, and forcing his way through the crowd
with as much violence as he used in entering, he vaulted
with the agility of a Mercury into his saddle, and galloped
as if he were on a steeple-chase, in the direction of Castle
Chute.
"If you are a gentleman," said Mr. Warner, "you are
y

as ill-tempered a gentleman as ever I met, or something
a great deal worse."
"Take care what you say, sir," said Mr. Cregan,
riding rapidly up, after a vain effort to arrest his son's
flight, and after picking up from a straggler, not three
yards from the scene of action, the exaggerated report
that Hardress and the coroner had given each other the
lie. "Take care what you say, sir," he said. "Remem-
ber, if you please, that the gentleman, ill-tempered or
otherwise, is my son."
"Mr. Cregan," exclaimed the magistrate, at length
growing somewhat warm, "if he were the son of the Lord
Lieutenant, I will not be interrupted in my duty. There
are many gentlemen here present; they have witnessed
the whole occurrence, and if they will tell you that I have
done or said anything unbecoming a gentleman, I am
ready to give you, or your son either, the satisfaction of
a gentleman."
With this pacificatory and Christian-like speech, the
exemplary Irish peace-preserver turned upon his heel,
and went to meet the carman, who was now within a few
paces of the crowd.
While the pitying and astonished multitude were
conveying the shattered remains of Eily O'Connor to the
nearest inn, her miserable husband was flying with the
speed of fear in the direction of Castle Chute. He
alighted at the Norman archway, by which Kyrle Daly
had entered on the day of his rejection, and throwing the
reins to Falvey, rushed without speaking up the stone
staircase. That talkative domestic still retained a lin-
gering preference for the discarded lover, and saw him
with grief supplanted by this wild and passionate young
gentleman.
He remained for a moment, holding the rein in his
hand, and looking back with a gaze of calm astonishment
at the flying figure of the rider. He then compressed
his lipsmoved to a little distance from the horseand
began to contemplate the wet and reeking flanks and
trembling limbs of the beautiful animal. The creature
presented a spectacle calculated to excite the compassion

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 339
of a practised attendant upon horses. His eyes were wide
and full of firehis nostrils expanded, and red as blood.
His shining coat was wet from ear to flank, and corded
by numberless veins that were now swollen to the utmost
by the accelerated circulation. As he panted and snorted
in his excitement, he scattered the flecks of foam over the
dress of the attendant.
"Oh! murther, murther l'exclaimed the latter, after
uttering that peculiar sound of pity which is used by the
vulgar in Ireland, and in some Continental nations.
"Well, there's a man that knows how to use a horse !
Look at that crathur ! Well, he ought to be ashamed of
himself, so he oughtany gentleman to use a poor dumb
crathur that way. As if the hunt wasn't hard enough
upon her, without bringin' her up in a gallop to the very
doore l' -
"An' as if my throuble wasn't enough besides,"
grumbled the groom, as he took the rein out of Falvey's
hand. "He ought to stick to his boating, that's what he
ought, an' to lave horses for those that knows how to use
'em."
"Who rode that horse?" asked old Dan Dawley, the
steward, as he came along sulky and bent by age to the
hall-door.
"The young masther we're gettin'," returned Falvey.
"Umphl" muttered Dawley, as he passed into the
house, "that's the image of the thratement he'll give all
that he gets into his power."
"It's thrue for you," said Falvey.
Dawley paused, and looked back over his shoulder.
"It's thrue for me !" he repeated gruffly. "It's you that
say that, an' you were the first to praise him when he
came into the family."
"It stood to raison I should," said Falvey. "I liked
him better than Masther Kyrle himself, for bein' an off-
hand gentleman, an' aisily spoken to. But sure a Turk
itself couldn't stand the way he's goin' on of late days "
Dawley turned away with a harsh grunt; the groom
1ed out the heated steed upon the lawn, and Falvey
returned to make the cutlery refulgent in the kitchen.

CHAPTER XXXVI.
HOW HARDRESS MADE A CONFIDANT.
HARDRESS CREGAN, in the meantime, had proceeded to
the antique chamber, mentioned in a former chapter,
which led to the drawing-room in the more modern part
of the mansion. He flung himself into a chair which
stood near the centre of the apartment, and remained
motionless for some moments, with hands clasped, and
eyes fixed upon the floor. There were voices and
laughter in the drawing-room, and he could hear the
accents of Anne Chute resisting the entreaties of Mrs.
Cregan and her mother, while they endeavoured to
prevail on her to sing some favourite melody.
"Anne," said Mrs. Chute, "don't let your aunt suppose
that you can be disobliging. What objection is there to
your singing that song?"
"One, I am sure, which aunt Cregan won't blame me
for, mamma. Hardress cannot endure to hear it."
"But Hardress is not here now, my dear."
"Ah! ah! aunt. Is that your principle? Would you
teach me to take advantage of his absence, then, to foster
a little will of my own?"
"Go-goyou giddy girl," said Mrs. Chute. "Have
you the impudence to make your aunt blush P"
"My dear Anne," said Mrs. Cregan, "if you never
make a more disobedient use of your husband's absence
than that of singing a little song which you love, and
which you can't sing in his presence, you will be the best
wife in Ireland."
"Very well, aunt, very well. You ought to know the
standard of a good wife. You have had some experience,
or my uncle (I should say) has had some experience of
what a good wife ought to be. Whether his knowledge
in that way has been negatively or positively acquired, is
more than I'll venture to say."

Hardress heard her run a tender prelude along the
keys of her instrument, before she sung the following
words:
"My Mary of the curling hair,
The laughing teeth and bashful air,
Our bridal morn is dawning fair,
With blushes in the skies.
Shule 1 Shule / Shule, agra,
Shule asucur, agus shule, aroont.
Come ! come ! Come, my darling!
Come softly, and come, my love 1
My love my pearl I
My own dear girl
My mountain maid, arise :
Wake, linnet of the osier grove 1
Wake, trembling, stainless, virgin dove 1
Wake, nestling of a parent's love,
Let Moran see thine eyes.
Shule / Shule / etc.
I am no stranger, proud and gay,
To win thee from thy home away,
And find thee, for a distant day,
A theme for wasting sighs.
Shule 1 Shule / etc.
But we were known from infancy;
Thy father's hearth was home to me;
No selfish love was mine for thee,
Unholy and unwise.
Shule / Shule / etc.
And yet (to see what love can do!)
Though calm my hope has burned, and true,
My cheek is pale and worn for you,
And sunken are mine eyes.
Shule / Shule / etc.
But soon my love shall be my bride,
And happy by our own fireside,
My veins shall feel the rosy tide,
That lingering Hope denies.

With blushes in the skies.
Shule / Shule / Shule, agra !
Shule asucur, agus shule, aroon /
My love 1 my pearl I
My own dear girl |

After the song was ended, Hardress heard the draw-
ing-room door open and shut, and the stately and
measured pace of his mother along the little lobby, and
on the short flight of stairs which led to the apartment
in which he sat. She appeared at the narrow stone
doorway, and used a gesture of surprise when she beheld
him.
"What! Hardress!" she exclaimed, "already returned
Have you had good sport to-day ?"
"Sport l" echoed Hardress, with a burst of low, in-
voluntary laughter, and without unclasping his wreathed
hands, or raising his eyes from the earth; "yes, mother,
very good sport. Sport, I think, that may bring my neck
in danger one day."
"Have you been hurt, then, child?" said Mrs. Cregan,
compassionately bending over her son.
Hardress raised himself in his seat, and fixed his eye
upon hers, for a few moments, in gloomy silence.
"I have," he said. "The hurt that I feared so long, I
have got at length. I am glad you have come. I wished
to speak with you."
"Stay a moment, Hardress. Let me close those doors.
Servants are so inquisitive, and apt to pry."
"Ay, now," said Hardress, "now, and from this time
forth, we must avoid those watchful eyes and ears. What
shall I do, mother? Advise me, comfort me! Oh! I am
utterly abandoned now ; I have no friend, no comforter
but you ! That terrible hope, that looked more like a
fear, that kept my senses on the rack from morn to morn,
is fled, at last, for ever. I am all forsaken now."
"My dear Hardress," said his mother, much distressed,
"when will you cease to afflict yourself and me with those
## p. 343 (#347) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 343
fancies? Forsaken, do you say? Do your friends
deserve this from you? You ask me to advise you, and
my advice is this: Lay aside those thoughts, and value,
as you ought to do, the happiness of your condition.
Who, with a love like Anne, with a friend like your
amiable college companion, Daly, and with a mother at
least devoted in intention, would deliver himself up, as
you do, to fantastic dreams of desolation and despair?
If, as you seem to hint, you have a cause for suffering in
your memory, remember, Hardress, that you are not left
on earth for nothing. All men have something to be
pardoned, and all time here is capable of being improved
in the pursuit of mercy."
"Go on," said Hardress, setting his teeth, and fixing a
wild stare upon his parent, "you but remind me of my
curses. With a love like Annel One whisper in your
ear. I love her not. While I was mad I did; and in
my senses, now, I am dearly suffering for that frantic
treason. She was the cause of all my sin and sorrow, my
first and heaviest curse. With such a friend Why,
how you laugh at me ! You know how black and weak
a part I have played to him, and yet you will remind me
that he was my friend. That's kindly done, mother.
Listen I" he continued, laying a firm grasp upon his
mother's arm"Before my eyes, wherever I turn me,
and whether it be dark or light, I see One, painting the
hideous portrait of a fiend. Day after day he comes, and
adds a deeper and a blacker tint to the resemblance.
Mean fear, and selfish pride, the coarser half of love,
worthless inconstancy, black falsehood, and red-handed
murder, those are the colours that he blends and stamps
upon my soul. I am stained in every part. The proud
coward that loved and was silent, when already committed
by his conduct, and master of the conquest that he feared
to claim. The hypocrite that volunteered a friendship,
to which he proved false almost without a trial. The
night-brawler, the drunkard, the faithless lover, and the
perjured husband Wherewho has ever run a course

my agonies without remembering that? No; but a cry
was at its gates before me, and I never felt that my prayer
was heard. What that cry was, I have this morning
learned. Mother," he added, turning quickly around with
great rapidity of voice and action, "I am a murderer l'"
Mrs. Cregan never heard the words. The look and
gesture, coupled with the foregoing speech, had pre-
informed her, and she fell back, in a death-like faint, into
the chair.
When she recovered, she found Hardress kneeling by
her side, pale, anxious, and terrified, no longer supported
by that horrid energy which he had shown before the
revealment of his secret, but motionless and helpless
desolate as an exploded mine. For the first time, the
mother looked upon her child with a shudder in which
remorse was mingled deeply with abhorrence. She waved
her hand two or three times, as if to signify that he
should retire from her sight. It was so that Hardress
understood and obeyed the gesture. He took his place
behind the chair of his parent, awaiting with gaping lip
and absent eye the renewal of her speech. The unhappy
mother, meanwhile, leaned forward in her seat, covering
her face with her hands, and maintained for several
minutes that silent communion with herself which was
usual with her when she had received any sudden shock.
A long pause succeeded.
"Are you still in the room?" she said, at length, as a
slight movement of the guilty youth struck upon her
hearing.
Hardress started, as a schoolboy might at the voice of
his preceptor, and was about to come forward, but the
extended arm of his parent arrested his steps.
"Remain where you are," she said; "it will be a long
time now before I shall desire to look upon my son."
Hardress fell back, stepping noiselessly on tiptoe, and
letting his head hang dejectedly upon his breast.
"If those things are not dreams," Mrs. Cregan again
said, in that calm, restrained tone which she always used
when her mind was undergoing the severest struggles;
"if you have not been feeding a delirious fancy, and can
## p. 345 (#349) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 345
restrain yourself to plain terms for one quarter of an
hour, let me hear you repeat this unhappy accident.
Nay, come not forward, stay where you are, and say your
story there. Unfortunate boy I We are a miserable
pair "
She again leaned forward with her face buried in her
expanded hands, while Hardress, with a low, chidden, and
timid voice and attitude, gave her in a few words the
mournful history which she desired. So utterly aban-
doned was he by that hectoring energy which he displayed
during his former conversations with his parent, that more
than half the tale was drawn from him by questions, as
from a culprit fearful of adding to the measure of his
punishment.
When he had concluded, Mrs. Cregan raised her head
with a look of great and evident relief.
"Why, Hardress," she said, "I have been misled in
this. I overleaped the mark in my surmise. You are
not then the actual actor in this horrid work l'"
"I was not the executioner," said Hardress. "I had a
deputy," he added, with a ghastly smile.
"Nor did you, by word or act, give warrant for the
atrocity of which you speak |"
"Oh mother, if you esteem it worth your while to
waste any kindness on me, forbear to torture my con-
science with that wretched subterfuge. I am the murderer
of Eily! It matters not that my finger has not gripped
her throat, nor my hand been reddened with her blood.
My heart, my will, has murdered her. My Soul was even
beforehand with the butcher who has sealed our common
ruin by his bloody disobedience. I am the murderer of
Eily. No, not in act, as you have said, nor even in word!
I breathed my bloody thoughts into no living ear. The
dark and hell-born flame was smouldered where it rose,
within my own lonely breast. Not through a single chink
or cleft in all my conduct could that unnatural rage be
evident. When he tempted me aloud, aloud I answered,
scorned, and defied him; and, when at our last fatal
interview I gave him that charge which he has stretched
to bloodshed, my speech was urgent for her safety."

"Ay, mother, it is truth ! I answer you as l shalf
answer at that dreadful bar, before that Throne the old
man told me of, when he and she shall stand to blast me
there !"
He stood erect, and held up his hand, as if already
pleading to the charge. Mrs. Cregan at the same moment
rose, and was about to address him with equal energy and
decision of manner.
"But still," he added, preventing her, "still I am
Eily's murderer. If I had an enemy who wished to find
me a theme for lasting misery, he could not choose a way
more certain than that of starting a doubt upon that
subtle and worthless distinction. I am Eily's murderer!
That thought will ring upon my brain, awake or asleep,
or evermore. Are these things dreams ? Oh, I would
give all the world of realities to find that I had dreamed
a horrid dream, and awake, and die"
"You overrate the measure of your guilt?" said Mrs.
Cregan, and was about to proceed when Hardress inter-
rupted her.
"Fool that I was 1" he exclaimed, with a burst of
grief and self-reproach, "fool, mad fool, and idiot that I

ing for that which was beyond my reach, and never able

future and the past alone looked beautiful. Now I must
see them all with altered eyes. The present is my refuge,
for the past is red with blood, and the future burning hot
with shame and fire."
"Sit down, and hear me, Hardress, for one moment,"
"Oh, Eily I'" the wretched youth continued, stretching
out his arms to their full extent, and seeming to apostro-
phise some listening spirit: "Oh, Eily! my lost, deceived,
and murdered love . Oh, let it not be thus without re-
call ! Tell me not that the things done in those hideous
months are wholly without remedy! Come back! Come
back! my own abused and gentle love! If tears, and
groans, and years of self-inflicted penitence can wash

away that one accursed thought, you shall be satisfied.
Look there !" he suddenly exclaimed, grasping his mother's
arm with one hand, and pointing with the other to a
distant corner of the room. "That vision comes to
answer me !" He followed a certain line with his finger
through the air, as if tracing the course of some hallucina-
tion. "As vivid, and as ghastly real, as when I saw it
lying, an hour hence, on the wet, cold bank; the yellow
hair uncurled; the feet exposedthe feet that I first
taught to stray from duty the dank, blue mantle, cover-
ing and clinging round the horrid form of death that lay
beneath. Four times I have seen it since I left the spot,
and every time it grows more deadly vivid. From this
time forth my fancies shall be changed; for gloomy
visions, gloomier realities; for ghastly fears, a ghastlier
certainty."
Here he sunk down into the chair which his mother
had drawn near her own, and remained for some moments
buried in deep silence. Mrs. Cregan took this opportu-
nity of gently bringing him into a more temperate vein of
feeling; but her feelings carried her beyond the limit
which she contemplated.
"Mistake me not," she said, "unhappy boy I would
not have you slight your guilt. It is black and deadly,
and such as Heaven will certainly avenge. But neither
must you fly to the other and worse extreme, where you
can only cure presumption by despair. You are not so
guilty as you deem. That you willed her death was a
dark and deadly sin; but nothing so hideous as the atro-
cious act itself. One thing, indeed, is certain, that, how-
ever this affair may terminate, we are an accursed and
miserable pair for this world. I in you and you in me !
Most weak and wicked boy! It was the study of my
life to win your love and confidence, and my reward has
been distrust, concealment, and xx
"Do you reproach me, then?" cried Hardress, spring-
ing madly to his feet, clenching his hand, and darting an
audacious scowl upon his parent. "Beware, I warn you!
I am a fiend, I grant you ; but it was by your temptation.
that I changed my nature. You, my mother l you have

been my fellest foe I drank in pride with your milk,
and passion under your indulgence. You sport with one
possessed and desperate. This whole love scheme, that
has begun in trick and cunning, and ended in blood, was
all your work | And do you now"
"Hold !" cried his mother, observing the fury of his
eye, and his hand raised and trembling, though not with
the impious purpose she affected to think. "Monster,
would you dare to strike your parent?"
As if he had received a sudden blow, Hardress sunk
down at her feet, which he pressed between his hands,
while he lowered his forehead to the very dust. "Mo-
ther l' he said, in a changing and humble voice, "my
first, my constant, and forbearing friend, you are right. I
am not quite a demon yet. My brain may fashion wild
and impious words, but it is your son's heart that still
beats within my bosom. I did not dream of such a horrid
purpose."
After a silence of some minutes, the wretched young
man arose, with tears in his eyes, and took his seat in the
chair. Here he remained fixed in the same absent pos-
ture, and listening, but with a barren attention, to the
many soothing speeches which were addressed to him by
his mother. At length, rising hastily from his seat, with
a look of greater calmness than he had hitherto shown,
he said:
"Mother, there is one way left for reparation. I will
give myself up."
"Hold, madman 1"
"Nay, hold, mother. I will do it. I will not bear
this fire upon my brain. I will not still add crime to
crime for ever. If I have outraged justice, it is enough.
I will not cheat her. Why do you hang upon me? I am
weak and exhausted; a child could stay me nowa flaxen
thread could fetter me. Release me, mother | There is
peace, and hope, and comfort in this thought. Else-
where I can find nought but fire and scourges. Oh! let
me make this offering of a wretched life to buy some
chance of quiet. I never shall close an eye in sleep again

until I stand upon the scaffold. Well, well, you will
prevailyou will prevail," he added, as his mother forced
him back into the chair which he had left; "but I may
find a time. My life, I know, is forfeited."
"It is not forfeited."
"Not forfeited Hear you, just Heaven, and judge ;
The ragged wretch that pilfers for his food must die
the starving father, who counterfeits a wealthy name to:
save his children from a horrid death, must diethe
goaded slave, who, driven from a holding of his fathers,
avenges his wrong upon the usurper's property, must

hypocrite, the false friend, the fickle husband, the coward,
traitor, and murderer (I am disgusted while I speak)my
life has not been forfeited 1 I alone stand harmless be-
neath these bloody laws I said I should not smile again,
but this will force a laugh in spite of me."
Mrs. Cregan prudently refrained from urging the sub-
ject farther for the present, and contented herself with
appealing to his affectionate consideration of her own
feelings, rather than reminding him of his interest in the
transaction. This seemed more effectually to work upon
his mind. He listened calmly and with less reluctance,
and was about to express his acquiescence, when a loud
and sudden knocking at the outer door of the chamber
made him start from his chair, turn pale, and shake in
every limb, like one convulsed. Mrs. Cregan, who had
herself been startled, was advancing towards the door,
when the knocking was heard again, though not so loud,
against that which led to the drawing-room. Imagining
that her ear, in the first instance, had deceived her, she
turned on her steps, and was proceeding toward the latter
entrance, when the sound was heard at both doors toge-
ther, and with increased loudness. Slight as this accident
appeared, it produced so violent an effect upon the nerves
of Hardress, that it was with difficulty he was able to
reach the chair which he had left, without falling to the
ground. The doors were openedthe one to Anne.
Chute, and the other to Mr. Cregan.
"Dinner is on the table, aunt," said the former.
## p. 350 (#354) ############################################
35o THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"And I am come on the very point of time, to claim a
neighbour's share of it," said Mr. Cregan.
"We are more fortunate than we expected," said Anne.
"We thought you would have dined with Mr. Connolly."
"Thank you for that hint, my good niece."
"Oh sir, don't be alarmed; you will not find us un-
provided, notwithstanding. Mr. Hardress Cregan," she
continued, moving towards his chair with a lofty and yet
playful carriage, "will you allow me to lead you to the
dining-room?"
"He is ill, Annea little ill," said Mrs. Cregan, in a
low voice.
"Dear Hardress you have been thrown "exclaimed
Anne, suddenly stooping over him with a look of tender
interest and alarm.
"No, Anne," said Hardress, shaking her hand in grate-
ful kindness; "I am not so indifferent a horseman. I
shall be better presently."
"Go ingo in, ladies," said Mr. Cregan. "I have a
word on business to say to Hardress. We will follow you
in three minutes."
The ladies left the room, and Mr. Cregan, drawing his
son into the light, looked on his face for some moments
with silent scrutiny.
"I don't know what to make of it," he said at length,
tossing his head. "You're not flagging, Hardressare
you?"
"Flagging, sir?"
"Yes. You do not feel a little queer about the heart
now in consequence of this affair?"
Hardress started, and shrunk back.
"Whew 1" the old sportsman gave utterance to a pro-
longed sound that bore some resemblance to a whistle.
""Tis all up ! That start spoke volumes. You've dished
yourself for ever. Let nobody see you. Gogo along
into some corner, and hide yourself: go to the ladies;
that's the place for you. What a fool I was to leave a
pleasant dinner party, and come here to look after a

But how dared youthis is my chief pointthishow
dared you stand up, and give any gentleman the lie, when
you have not the heart to hold to your words? What do
you stare at?Answer me."
"Give any gentleman the lie l'" echoed Hardress.
"Yes, to be sure. Didn't you give Warner the lie a
while ago upon the corcass?"
"Not I, I am sure."
"No | What was your quarrel, then?"
"We had no quarrel. You are under some mistake."
"That's very strange. That's another affair. It passes
all that I have ever heard. The report all over the ground
was that you had exchanged the lie, and some even went
so far as to say that you had horsewhipped him. It leaves
me at my wit's end."
At this moment Falvey put in his head at the door,
and said:
"Dinner, if ye plase, gentlemen; the ladies is waitin'
for ye."
This summons ended the conversation for the present,
and Hardress followed his father into the dining-room.

CHAPTER XXXVII.
HARDRESS FINDS THAT CONSCIENCE IS THE SWORN
FOE OF WALOUR.
HE who, when smitten by a heavy fever, endeavours,
with bursting head and aching bones, to maintain a
cheerful seeming among a circle of friends, may imagine
something of Hardress Cregan's situation on this evening.
His mother contrived to sit near him during the whole
time, influencing his conduct by word and gesture, as one
would regulate the movements of an automaton.
The company consisted only of that lady, her son, her
husband, and the two ladies of the mansion. The fire
burned cheerfully in the grate, the candles were lighted,
## p. 352 (#356) ############################################
352 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
Anne's harpsichord was thrown open, and, had the
apartment at that moment been unroofed by Le Diable
Boiteux, in the sight of his companion, Don Cleofas
would have pronounced it a scene of domestic happiness
and comfort.
It appeared, from the conversation which took place in
the course of the evening, that the coroner had not even
found any one to recognise the body, and the jury, after
giving the case a long consideration, had come to the only
conclusion for which there appeared to be satisfactory
evidence. They had returned a verdict of "Found
drowned."
"He would be a sharp lawyer," continued Mr. Cregan,
"that could take them up on that verdict. I thought
there were some symptoms of murder in the case, and
wished them to adjourn the inquest, but I was overruled.
After all, I'll venture to say it was some love business.
She had a wedding ring on."
"Be calm," whispered Mrs. Cregan, laying her hand
on her son's arm. "Some young husband, perhaps, who
found he had made a bad bargain. Take care of yourself,
Anne; Hardress may learn the knack of it."
Hardress acknowledged the goodness of this jest by a
hideous laugh.
"It was a shocking business!" said Mrs. Chute. "I
wonder, Hardress, how you can laugh at it. Depend
upon it, it will not terminate in that way. Murder is like
fireit will out at some cleft or another."
"That is most likely to be the case in the present
instance," said Mr. Cregan, "for the clothes, in all
likelihood, will be identified, and Warner has sent an
advertisement to all the newspapers and to the parish
chapels, giving an account of the whole transaction. It
is, indeed, quite certain that the case will be cleared up,
and the foul play, if there be any, discovered. Whether
the perpetrators will be detected or not, is a different
question."
Mrs. Cregan, who was in an agony during this con-
versation, felt a sudden relief when it was ended by
Anne Chute's calling on her uncle for a song.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 353
Mr. Cregan, who was always very funny among young
people, replied that he would with all his heart. And
accordingly, with a prefatory hem, he threw back his
head, raised his eyes to the cornice, dropt his right leg
over the left knee, and treated the company to the
following effusion, humouring the tune with his head, by
slightly jerking it from side to side:
Gilli ma chree,
Sit down by me;
We now are joined, and ne'er shall sever;
This hearth's our own,
Our hearts are one,
And peace is ours for ever !
When I was poor,
Your father's door
Was closed against your constant lover.
With care and pain
I tried in vain
My fortunes to recover.
I said, "To other lands I'll roam,
Where fate may smile on me, love!"
I said, "Farewell, my own old home !"
And I said, "Farewell to thee, love l'"
Sing Gilli ma chree, etc.
I might have said,
"My mountain maid,
Come live with me, your own true lover?
I know a spot,
A silent cot,
Your friends can ne'er discover,
Where gently flows the waveless tide,
By one small garden only;
Where the heron waves his wings so wide.
And the linnet sings so lonely."
Sing Gilli ma Chree, etc.
I might have said,
"My mountain maid,
A father's right was never given
True hearts to curse
With tyrant force,
That have been blessed in Heaven."
But, then, I said, "In after years,
. When thoughts of home shall find her,
- My love may mourn, with secret tears,
Her friends thus left behind her."
Sing Gilli ma chree, etc.
## p. 354 (#358) ############################################
354 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"Oh, no," I said,
"My own dear maid,
For me, though all forlorn, for ever,
That heart of thine
Shall ne'er repine --
O'er slighted dutynever
From home and thee though wandering far,
A dreary ate be mine, love;
I'd rather live in endless war,
Than buy my peace with thine, love."
Sing Gulli ma chree, etc.
Far, far away,
By night and day,
I toiled to win a golden treasure;
And golden gains
Repaid my pains
In fair and shining measure.
I sought again my native land;
Thy father welcomed me, love;
I poured my gold into his hand,
And my guerdon found in thee, love!
Sing Gilli ma chree,
Sit down by me;
We now are joined, and ne'er shall sever;
This hearth's our own,
Our hearts are one,
And peace is ours for ever.
It was not until he courted rest and forgetfulness in
the solitude of his chamber, that the hell of guilt and
memory began to burn within the breast of Hardress.
Fears, which until this moment he had despised as weak
and childish, now oppressed his imagination with all the
force of a real and imminent danger. The darkness of
his chamber was crossed by horrid shapes, and the pillow
seemed to burn beneath his cheek, as if he lay on fire.
If he dozed, he seemed to be rocked on his bed as if
borne upward on the back of a flying steed, and the cry
of hounds came yelling on his ear with a discord even
more terrible than that which rung upon the ear of the
hunted Actaeon, in the exquisite fiction of the ancients.
That power of imagination, in which he had been often
accustomed to take pride, as in a high intellectual endow-
ument, became now his most fearful curse; and, as it had
## p. 355 (#359) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 355
been a chief instrument in his seduction, was also made
a principal engine of retribution.
Several circumstances, trifling in themselves, but power-
ful in their operation upon the mind of the guilty youth,
occurred in the course of the ensuing week, to give new
fuel to the passion which preyed upon his nerves. A few
of these we will relate, if only for the purpose of showing
how slight a breath may shake the peace of him who has
suffered it to be sapped in the foundation.
When the first agony of his remorse went by, the love
of lifetriumphant even over that appalling passion
made him join his mother in her fears of a discovery, and
her precautions for its prevention. He sought, therefore,
many opportunities of misleading the observation of his
acquaintances, and affected to mingle in their amusements
with a greater carelessness than he had ever assumed
during the period of his uncertainty respecting Eily's fate.
A small party had been formed one morning for the
purpose of Snipe-shooting, and Hardress was one of the
number. In a rushy swamp (adjoining the little bay
which had been selected as the scene of the saddle-race
so many months before), the game were said to exist in
great quantities, and thither, accordingly, the sportsmen
first repaired. A beautiful, but only half-educated pointer,
which Hardress procured in Kerry, in his eagerness for
sport, had repeatedly broken out of bound, in disregard
of all the menaces and entreaties of his owner, and by
these means, on many occasions narrowly escaped de-
struction. At length, while he was indulging in one of
those wild gambols, a bird rose, with a sudden shriek,
from the very feet of Hardress, and flew forward, darting
and wheeling in a thousand eccentric circles. Hardress
levelled and fired. The Snipe escaped; but a mournful
howl of pain from the animal before alluded to, seemed
to announce that the missile had not sped upon a fruitless
errand. In a few seconds the poor pointer was seen
crawling out of the rushes, and turning at every step to
whine and lick its side, which was covered with blood.
The slayer ran, with an aching heart, towards the un-
fortunate creature, and stooped to assist and to caressit.
## p. 356 (#360) ############################################
356 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
But the wound was passed all remedy. The poor quad-
ruped whimpered and fawned upon his feet, as if to dis-
arm the suspicion of resentment, and died in the action.
"Oh, murther, murther l'" said Pat Falvey, who accom-
panied the party, "the poor thing was all holed with the
shot! Oh, look at the limbs stiffening, and the light
that's gatherin' in the eyes | There's death, now, Masther
Hardress, the Lord save us!there's death !"
"Where?" said Hardress, looking round with some
wildness of eye, and a voice which was indicative at the
same time of anger and of bodily weakness.
"There, before your eye, sir," said Falvey. "There's
what we'll all have to go through one time or another, the
Christian as well as the baste 'Twould be well for some
of us if we had as little to answer for as that poor pointher,
ather our doin's in this world."
The other gentlemen had now collected around, with
many expressions of condolence on the fate of the poor
servant of the chase. Hardress appeared to be affected
in a peculiar manner by the transaction which he had wit-
nessed. His glances were vague and unsettled, his cheek
was deadly pale, and his limbs trembled exceedingly. This
was the first shot he had fired in the course of the day;
and the nature of the sport in which he was engaged had
not once occurred to him until he saw the blood flowing
at his feet. To a mind like his, always sensitive and
reflective, and rendered doubly so by the terrific associa-
tions of the last few months, the picture of death in this
poor quadruped was scarcely less appalling than it might
have been in the person of a fellow-mortal. He felt his
head grow dizzy as he turned away from the spot; and,
after a few feeble paces, he fell senseless among the rushes.
The gentlemen hastened to his relief, with looks of
astonishment rather than of pity. Some there were imper-
fectly acquainted with his character, or perplexed by the
extraordinary change which it had lately undergone, who
winked and sneered apart when he was lifted from the
earth; and though no one ventured openly to impute any
effeminacy of character to the young gentleman, yet, when-
ever they spoke of the occurrence in the course of the day,
## p. 357 (#361) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 357
it was not without exchanging a conscious smile. On
another occasion a boating party was formed, when Har-
dress, as usual, took the rudder in hand. His father, on
entering the little vessel, was somewhat surprised at seeing
a new boatman seated on the forecastle.
"Hello!" he said, "what's your name, my honest
fellow P"
"Larry Kett, sir, plase your honour," returned the
man, a sturdy old person, with a face as black as a storm.
"Why, Hardress I had you a quarrel with your little
hunchback P"
Hardress stooped suddenly down, as if for the purpose
of arranging a block, and after a little silence replied:
"No quarrel, sir; but he chose to seek another service,
and I do not think I have made a bad exchange."
The conversation changed, and the party (among whom
was Anne Chute) proceeded on their excursion. The wind
freshened considerably in the course of the forenoon; and
before they had reached that part of the river which flowed
by the dairy cottage of Mr. Daly, it blew a desperate gale.
The boatman, more anxious for the comfort of the ladies
than really apprehensive for the boat, suggested the expe-
diency of putting about on the homeward course before
the tide should turn.
"If you hold on," said the man, with a significant look,
"until the wind an' tide come conthrary, there 'ill be a
swell in the channel, that it is as much as you can do to
come through it with the two reefs."
Hardress assented, but it was already too late. They
were now a considerable distance below the cottage, with
a strong westerly wind, and a tide within twenty minutes
of the flood.
"What are you doing, Masther Hardress?" said the
boatman. "Won't you haul home the mainsheet and
jib?"
Hardress, whose eyes had been fixed on the rocky point
before the cottage, started suddenly, and proceeded to
execute the nautical manoeuvre in question. The little
vessel, as docile to her helm as a well-mounted hunter to
his rider, threw her bow away from the wind, and rushed
## p. 358 (#362) ############################################
358 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
roaring through the surges with a fuller and a fiercer
energy. After suffering her to run for a few minutes before
the wind, Hardress commenced, with due caution, the
dangerous process of jibbing or shifting the mainsail from
one side of the vessel to the other.
"Down with yer heads, ladies, if ye plaise; take care
of the boom."
All the heads were lowered, and the boom swung rapidly
across, and the vessel heeled with the sudden impulse,
until her leeward gunwale sipped the brine.
"Give her a free sheet now, Masther Hardress," said
Kett, "and we'll be up in two hours."
All boatmen know that it requires a much steadier hand
and more watchful eye to govern a vessel when the wind
is fair than when it is adverse. A still greater nicety of
attention was requisite in the present instance, as the
wind was high, and the now returning tide occasioned, as
the boatman predicted, a heavy sea in the channel. It
was, therefore, with considerable chagrin that Larry Kett
perceived his master's mind wandering, and his attention
frequently altogether withdrawn from the occupation which
he had in hand. That nervous disease to which he had
become a slave for many weeks, approached a species of
paroxysm when Hardress found himself once more upon
the very scene where he had first encountered danger with
the unfortunate Eily, and before that dwelling, beneath
whose roof he had plighted, to his forgotten friend, the
faith which he had since betrayed. It was impossible his
reason could preserve its calmness amid those terrible re-
membrances. As the shades of evening fell, assisted by
the gloomy clouds that scowled upon the brow of Heaven,
he became subject to the imaginative weakness of a child.
The faces of his companions darkened and grew strange
in his eye. The roar of the waters was redoubled, and
the howling of the wind along the barren shores brought
to his mind the horrid cry of the hounds, by which his
guilt and his misery had been so fearfully revealed. The
shapes of those whom he had wronged seemed to menace
him from the gloomy chasms that gaped around between
the enormous billows, and the blast came after with a
## p. 359 (#363) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN, 359
voice of reproach, as if to hurry him onward to a place of
dreadful retribution. Sometimes the corpse of Eily,
wrapped in the blue mantle which she generally wore,
seemed to be rolled downward from the ridge of a foaming
breaker; sometimes the arms seemed stretched to him for
aid; and sometimes the pale and shrouded figure of Mrs.
Daly seemed, from the gloom, to bend a look on him of
quiet sadness and upbraiding. While wholly absorbed in
the contemplation of these phantoms, a rough grasp was
suddenly laid upon his arm, and a rough voice shouted in
his ear:
"Are you deaf or dreaming? Mind your hand, or
you'll put us downl"
Hardress looked around like one who suddenly awakes
from slumber, and saw his father looking on him with an
inflamed and angry countenance. In his reverie a change
had taken place, of which he was totally unconscious. A
heavy shower drove full upon the party, the sky had grown
still darker, and the wind had risen still higher. The
time had long gone by when the spirits of Hardress
caught fire from the sight of danger, and when his energies
were concentrated by difficulty, as the firmness of an arch
is augmented by the weight which it is made to sustain.
The suddenness of his father's action startled him to the
very heart: the strange, and, as it appeared to him, sudden
change in the weather, confirmed the disorder of his
senses; and springing forward, as a culprit might do from
the sudden arrest of an officer of justice, he abandoned
the rudder, and fled with murmurs of affright into the
centre of the boat, where he sank exhausted upon the
ballast.
The scene of confusion which ensued it is not needful
that we should describe. Larry Kett, utterly unable to
comprehend what he beheld, took charge of the helm,
while the remainder of the party busied themselves in
restoring Hardress to some degree of composure. There
was no remark made at the time, but, when the party were
separating, some touched their foreheads and compressed
their lips in a serious manner; while others, in secret

of Hardress Cregan with that epithet which is so deeply
dreaded by young men, that they will burst the ties of
moral justice, of religion, of humanity, and even incur the
guilt of murder, to avoid its imputationthe epithet of
coward.
Never was there a being more constitutionally formed
for deeds of courage and of enterprise than Hardress, and
yet (such is the power of conscience) never was a stigma
affixed with greater justice. He hurried early to his room,
where he passed a night of feverish restlessness, secured,
indeed, from the observation of others, but still subjected
to the unwinking gaze of memory, whose glance, like the
diamond eyes of the famous idol, seemed to follow him
whithersoever he turned with the same deadly and avenging
expression.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
HOW THIE SITUATION OF HARDRESS BECAME MORE
CRITICAL.
ANOTHER occurrence, mingled with somewhat more of
the ridiculous, but not less powerful in its effect upon the
mind of Hardress, took place in a few days afterwards.
In the lack of some equally exciting exercise, and in
order to form a pretext for his frequent absence from the
Castle, Hardress was once more tempted to take up his
gun, and look for shore-fowl in the neighbourhood.
One morning when he was occupied in drawing a charge
in the hall, Falvey came running in to let him know that
a flock of May-birds had pitched in one of the gullies in
the creek, which was now almost deserted by the fallen
tide.
"Are there many?" said Hardress, a little interested.
"Oceans, oceans of 'em, sir," was the reply of the
figurative valet.
"Very well; do you take this bag, and follow me to
## p. 361 (#365) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 361
the shore. I think we shall get at them conveniently
from behind the lime-kiln."
This was a commission which Falvey executed with
the worst grace in the world. This talkative person was,
in fact, a perfect, and even absurd coward, nor did he
consider the absence of any hostile intention as a security,
when the power of injury was in his neighbourhood.
His dread of fire-arms, like that of Friday, approached to
a degree of Superstition, and it would appear from his
conduct that he had anything but a steady faith in the
common opinion that a gun must throw its contents in
the direction of the bore. Accordingly, it was always
with considerable reluctance and apprehension that he
accompanied his young master on his shooting excur-
sions. He followed him now with a dejected face, and
a sharp and prudent eye, directed ever and anon at the
loaded weapon which Hardress balanced in his hand.
They approached the game under cover of a low, ruined
building, which had been once used as a lime-kiln, and
now served as a blind to those who made it an amuse-
ment to scatter destruction among the feathered visitants of
the little creek. Arrived at this spot, Hardress perceived
that he could take the quarry at a better advantage from
a sand-bank at some distance on the right. He moved,
accordingly, in that direction, and Falvey, after conjectur-
ing how he might best get out of harm's way, crept into
the ruined kiln, and took his seat on the loose stones at
the bottom. The walls, though broken down on every
side, were yet of a sufficient height to conceal his person,
when in a sitting posture, from all observation of man or
fowl. Rubbing his hands in glee, and Smiling to find
himself thus snugly ensconced from danger, 
with an anxiety, not quelled, indeed, but yet somewhat
diminished, the explosion of the distant engine of death.
But his evil genius, envious of his satisfaction, found
means of putting his tranquillity to nought. Hardress
altered his judgment of the two stations, and accordingly
crept back to the limekiln with as little noise as he had
used in leaving it. He marvelled what had become of
Falvey; but, reserving the search for him until he had

362 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
done his part upon the curlews, he went on his knee, and
rested the barrel of his piece on the grass-covered wall of
the ruin, in such a manner that the muzzle was two
inches above the head of the unseen, and smiling, and
unconscious Falvey. Having levelled on the centre of
the flock, he fired, and an uproar ensued which it is.
almost hopeless to describe.
Half-a-dozen of the birds fell without hearing the shot;
several fluttered a few paces, and then sunk gasping on.
the slob. The great mass of the flock rose screaming
into the calm air, and were chorussed by the whistling of
myriads of sea-larks, red shanks, and other diminutive
waterfowl. But the most alarming strain in the concert
was played by poor Falvey, who gave himself up for
dead on hearing the shot fired close to his ear in so
unexpected a manner. He sprang at one bound clear
out of the lime-kiln, and fell flat on his face and hands.
upon the short grass, roaring and kicking his heels in the
air like one in the agonies of the colica pictorum. Terri-
fied to the soul by this startling incident, Hardress threw
down his gun, and fled as from the face of a fiend.
In the meantime the cries of the prostrate Falvey
attracted to his relief a stranger, who had hitherto lain
concealed under a projection of the bank. He jumped
upon the wall of the kiln, and remained gazing for some
moments on the fallen man, with an expression which
partook more of curiosity than of compassion. Seeing
the gun, he imagined that Falvey had fired the shot
himself, and experienced some injury from the recoil. It
was with a kind of sneer, therefore, that he took up the
weapon, and proceeded to question the sufferer.
"What's the matter wid you, man alive? What
makes you be roarin' dat way?"
"I'm hot "* returned Falvey, with a groan. "I'm
hot. The masther holed me with the shot. Will I get
the priest? Will I get the priest itself?"
"Where did he hole you?"
"There, in the lime-kiln, this minute. Will I get the
priest?"
* An Irish preterite for the word hit.
## p. 363 (#367) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 303.
"I mane, where are you hot ? In what part o' your
body?"
"Oyeh, it is all one," said Falvey, a little perplexed
by the question. "I felt it in the very middle o' my
heart. Sure I know I'm a gone man 1"
"How do you know it, ayeh P Straighten yourself,
an' sit up a bit. I don't see any signs of a hole."
Falvey sat up, and began to feel his person in various
places, moaning the whole time in the most piteous tone,
and looking occasionally on his hands, as if expecting to
find them covered with blood. After a minute examina-
tion, however, no such symptom could be discovered.
"Ah, dere's nottin' de matter wid you, man," said the
stranger. "Stand up, man; you're as well as ever you
WOr."
"Faiks, may be so," returned Falvey, rising and look-
ing about him with some briskness of eye. "But sure I
know," he added, suddenly drooping, "'tis the way always
with people when they are holed by a gun; they never
feel it until the moment they dhrop."
"Well, an' isn't it time for you to tink of it when you
begin to feel it?" returned the stranger.
"Faiks, may be so," returned Falvey, with increasing
confidence. "That I may be blest," he added, swinging.
his arms, and moving a few paces with greater freedom,
"that I may be blest if I feel any pain Faiks, I thought
I was hot. But there's one thing, any way; as long as
ever I live, I never again will go shooting with any man,
gentle or simple, during duration."
"Stay a minute," said the stranger "won't you go
out for the curlews?"
"Go out for 'em yourself, an' have 'em if you like,"
returned Falvey; "it's bother enough I got with them.
for birds."
He took up the gun and pouch, and walked slowly
away, while the stranger, after slipping off his shoes and
stockings, and turning up the knees of his under-garment,
walked out for the game. He had picked up one or two
of the birds, and was proceeding farther along the brink
of the gully when a sudden shout was heard upon the

364 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
rocky shore on the other side of the creek. The stranger
started and looked, like a frighted deer, in that direction,
where Falvey beheld a party of soldiers running down the
rocks, as if with the purpose of intercepting his passage
round a distant point by which the high road turned.
The stranger, possibly aware of their intention, left his
shoes, the game, and all behind him, and fled rapidly
across the slob, in the direction of the point. It was
clear the soldiers could not overtake him. They halted,
therefore, on the shore, and, levelling their pieces with
deliberation, fired several shots at the fugitive as after a
runaway prisoner.
With lips agape with horror, Falvey beheld the shining
face of the mud torn up by the bullets within a few feet
of the latter. He still, however, continued his course
unhurt, and was not many yards distant from the opposite
shore, when (either caught by a trip, or brought down by
some bullet better aimed) he staggered and fell in the
marl. He rose again, and again sank down upon his
elbow, panting for breath, and overpowered by fatigue
and fear. Falvey delayed to see no more, being uncer-
tain at whom their muskets would be next directed.
Lowering his person as far as might be consistent with a
suitable speed, he ran along the hedge-ways in the direc-
tion of the Castle.
In the meantime Hardress, full of horror at the sup-
posed catastrophe, had hurried to his sleeping-room,
where he flung himself upon the bed, and sought, but
found not, relief in exclamations of terror and of agony.
"What '' he muttered through his clenched teeth, "shall
my hands be always bloody? Can I not move but death
must dog my steps? Must I only breathe to suffer and
destroy P"
A low and broken moan, uttered near his bedside,
made him start with a superstitious apprehension. He
looked round, and beheld his mother kneeling at a chair,
her face pale, excepting the eyes, which were inflamed
with tears. Her hands were wreathed together, as if with
a straining exertion, and sobs came thick and fast upon
her breath, in spite of all her efforts to restrain them. In

a few minutes while he remained gazing on her in some
perplexity, she arose, and, standing by his bedside, laid
her hand quietly upon his head.
"I have been trying to pray," she said, "but I fear in
vain. It was a selfish prayerit was offered up for you.
If you fear death and shame, you will soon have cause to-
tremble. For a mother who loves her son, guilty as he
is, and for a son who would not see his parents brought
to infamy, there have been fearful tidings here since
morning."
Hardress could only look the intense anxiety which he
felt, to learn what those tidings were.
"In a few words," said Mrs. Cregan, "the dress of
that unhappy girl has been recognised, and by a train
of circumstances (command yourself awhile !)circum-
stances which this sick head of mine will hardly allow me
to detail, suspicion has fallen upon your former boatman.
and his family. Do you know where he is P"
"I have not seen him since the the I know not.
My orders were that he should leave the country, and I
gave him money for the purpose."
"Thank Heaven for that l" Mrs. Cregan exclaimed,
with her usual steady energy, while she clasped her
hands together, and looked upward with a wrapt fervour
of expression. The action, however, was quickly altered
to a chilly shudder. She looked suddenly to the earth,
veiling her eyes with her hand, as if a rapid light had
dazzled her. "Thank Heaven l'" she repeated, in a tone
of terrified surprise. "Oh! mighty Being, Origin of jus-
tice, and Judge of the guilty, forgive me for that impious.
gratitude : Oh! Dora Cregan, if any one had told you
in your youth that you should one day thank Heaven to
find a murderer safe from justicel I do not mean you,
amy child," she said, turning to Hardress; "you are no
murderer."
Hardress made no reply, and Mrs. Cregan remained
silent for a few minutes, as if deliberating on the course"
which it would be necessary for her to adopt. The de-
ception practised on Anne Chute was not among the least.
of those circumstances which made her situation one of

366 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
:: Onising perplexity. But her fate had been already
decided, and it would be only to make the ruin of her son
assured, if she attempted now to separate the destiny of
Anne from theirs.
"We must hasten this marriage," Mrs. Cregan con-
tinued, after a silence of some minutes, "and, in the
meantime, endeavour to get those people, the Naughtens,
out of the way. They will be sought for without delay.
Mr. Warner has been inquiring for you, that he might
obtain information of your boatman. I told him that you
had parted with the man long since, and you did not
know whither he had gone. Do you think you could
sustain an interview with him?"
Hardress, who was now sitting upon the bedside, pale,
and with features distorted by terror, replied to this ques-
tion by a chilly shudder and a vacant stare.
"We must keep him out, then," said his mother;
"or, if he must see you, it shall be in your chamber.
There is still one way by which you might be savedthe
way which you proposed yourself, though I was not then
sufficiently at ease to perceive its advantages. Go boldly
forward and denounce this wretch; lay all the information
in your power before the magistrates, and aid the officers
of justice in bringing him to punishment."
Hardress turned his dull and bloodshot eyes upon his
mother, as if to examine whether she was serious in this
proposition. If a corpse, rigid in death, could be stimu-
lated to a galvanic laugh, one might expect to find it such
a hideous convulsion as Hardress used on discovering
that she did not mock.
"No, mother," he said, curbing the sardonic impulse,
"I am not innocent enough for that."
"Why will you so perversely wrong yourself?" said
Mrs. Cregan. "Neither in your innocence, nor in your
culpability, do you seem to form a true estimate of your
conduct. You are not so guilty as"
"Very true, mother," said Hardress, impatient of the
subject, and cutting it short with a burst of fierceness,
scarcely less shocking than his laughter. "If the plea of
conscious guilt will not suffice, you may take my refusal
## p. 367 (#371) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 367
upon your own ground. I am too innocent for that. I
am not fiend enough for such a treachery. Pray let me
hear no more of it, or I shall sicken. There's some one
has knocked three times at the room door. I am quite
weary of playing the traitor, and if I had nothing but
pure heart-sickness to restrain me, I should yet long for
a reform. My brain will bear no more ; a single crime
would crush it now. Again There's some one at the
door."
"Well, Hardress, I will speak with you of this at
night."
"With all my heart. You say things sometimes that
go near to drive me mad, but yet you always talk to me
as a friend, for my own sake, and kindly. Mother 1" he
added, suddenly laying his hand on her arm, as she
passed him, and as the light fell brighter on her thin and
gloomy features: "Mother, how changed you are since
this unhappy act 1 You are worn out with fears and
sorrows. It has been my fate or fault (I will not contend
for the distinction) to scatter poison in the way of all
who knew me. A lost love for one; for another, false-
hood, desertion, death; for a third, duplicity and in-
gratitude; and even for you, my mother, ill health, a
sinking heart, and a pining frame. I can promise nothing
now. My mind is so distracted with a thousand images
and recollections (each one of which, a year since, I would
have thought sufficient to unsettle my reason), that I
know not how to offer you a word of comfort. But if
these gloomy days should be destined to pass away, and
(whether by penitence or some sudden mercy) my heart
should once again be visited with a quieter grief, I will
then remember your affection."
There was a time when this speech would have been
moonlight music to the ear of Mrs. Cregan. Now, her
esteem for Hardress being fled, and a good deal of self-
reproach brought in to sour the feeling with which she
regarded his conduct, it was only in his moments of
danger, of anger, or distress, that her natural affections
were forcibly aroused in his behalf. Still, however, it
did not fail to strike upon her heart. She sunk weeping

upon his neck, and loaded him with blessings and
Caresses.
"I do not look for thanks, Hardress," she said, at
length, disengaging herself, as if in reproof of her weak-
ness, "because I do the part of a mother. All that you
have said, my child, in my regard, is very vain and idle.
A quiet, at least a happy, fireside is a blessing that I
never more can enjoy, nor do I even hope for it. It is
not because I think your guilt not worthy of the extreme
punishment of the laws, that therefore I should deem it
possible we can either of us forget our share in the horrid
deed that has been done. Let us not disguise the truth
from our own hearts. We are a wretched and a guilty
pair, with enough of sin upon our hands to make our
future life a load of fear and penitence."
"I did but speak it," said the son, with some peevish-
ness of tone, "in consideration of your suffering."
"I wish, Hardress, that you had considered me a little
more early."
"You did not encourage me to a confidence," said
Hardress. "You repressed it."
"You should not," retorted the mother, "have needed
encouragement under circumstances so decisive. Married!
if you had breathed a word of it to me, I would have
sooner died than urge you as I did."
"I told you I was pledged."
"You did : ay, there, indeed, my son, your reproach
strikes home. I thought that you would only break a
verbal truth, and most unjustly did I wish that you
should break it. How fearfully his Heaven repaid me
for that selfish and unfeeling act l B tyou were all too
close and secret for me. Go-go, unhappy boy; you
taunt me with the seduction which was only the work of
your own shameful passion."
This painful dialogue, which, perhaps, would have risen
to a still more bitter tone of recrimination, was broken off
by a renewal of the summons at the door. It appeared
as if the applicant for admission had gone away in despair,
and again returned after a fruitless search elsewhere. On
opening the door, Mrs. Cregan encountered the surly
## p. 369 (#373) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 369
visage of Dan Dawley, who informed her that her presence
was required in the ball-room: such was the name given
to that apartment in which Hardress had made to her a
confession of his guilt. When she had left the chamber,
Hardress, who grew momentarily more weak and ill, pre-
pared himself for bed, and bade the old steward send him
one of the servants. This commission the surly functionary
discharged on returning to the servants' hall, by intimating
nis master's desire to Pat Falvey, who had entered some
time before.
Mrs. Cregan, in the meantime, proceeded to the cham-
ber above mentioned, which she could only reach by
passing through the narrow hall and winding staircase
near the entrance. The former presented a scene calcu-
lated to alarm and perplex her. A number of soldiers,
with their soaped and powdered queues, and musket-
barrels shining like silver, were stuck up close to the wall
on either side, like the wax figures in the shop of a London
tailor. On the gravel before the door she could see a
number of country people, who had collected about the
door, wondering what could have brought "the army" to
Castle Chute. From the door of the kitchen and ser-
vants' hall a number of heads were thrust out, with faces in-
dicative of a similar degree of astonishment and curiosity.
Passing through this formidable array, Mrs. Cregan
ascended the stairs, and was admitted at the door of the
ball-room by a figure as solemn and formidable as those
below. The interior of the room presented a scene of
still more startling interest. A table was spread in the
centre, around which were standing Mr. Warner, the
magistrate, Mr. Barnaby Cregan, Captain Gibson, and a
clerk. At the farther end of the table, his arm suspended
in a cotton handkerchief, stood a low, squalid, and ill-
shaped figure, his dress covered with mud, and his face,
which was soiled with blood and marl, rather expressive
of surprise and empty wonder than of apprehension or of
suffering.
Mrs. Cregan, who recognised the figure, paused for a
moment in a revulsion of the most intense anxiety, and
then walked calmly forward with that air of easy dignity,
2 A

which she could assume even when her whole nature was
at war within her. This power of veiling her inward
struggles, even to the extremity of endurance, made her
resemble a fair tower sapped in the foundation, which
shows no symptom of a weakness up to the very instant
of destruction, and is a ruin even before the sentiment of
admiration has faded on the beholder's mind.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
HOW THE DANGER TO THE SECRET OF HARDRESS WAS
AVERTED BY THE INGENUITY OF IRISH WITNESSES.
MR. WARNER informed her that it was no longer neces-
sary that her son's assistance should be afforded them, as
they had had the good fortune to apprehend the object of
their suspicions. They should, however, he said, be
compelled to await the arrival of their witnesses, for
nothing had been gained by putting the fellow on his
examination. His answers were all given in the true
style of an Irish witness, seeming to evince the utmost
frankness, yet invariably leaving the querist in still greater
perplexity than before he put the question. Every hour,
he said, they expected the arrival of this man's brother
and sister from Killarney, and they should then have an
opportunity of confronting them with him and with the
previous witnesses.
"I have already sent off a messenger," continued Mr.
Warner, "to my own little place, to see if they have yet
arrived, in order that they may be brought hither and ex-
amined on the spot. The inconvenience to Mrs. Chute,
I hope she will excuse, and my principal reason for wish-
ing to see you, Mrs. Cregan, was that you might bear our
explanation to that lady. On occasions of this kind all
good subjects are liable to be trespassed on, perhaps
more than courtesy might warrant."
"I will answer for my sister," said Mrs. Cregan, coldly;
"she will not, of course, withhold any accommodation in
## p. 371 (#375) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 371
her power. But this manhas he been questioned,
sir?"
** He has."
"Might I be allowed to see the examination?"
"By all means, Mrs. CreganMr. Houlahan, will you
hand that book to the lady?"
Mr. Houlahan, after sticking his pen behind his ear,
rose and delivered the volume accordingly, with a smirk
and bow, which he meant for a wonder of politeness. The
lady, whose thoughts were busy with other matters than
with Mr. Houlahan's gallantry, received it, nevertheless,
with a calm dignity, and opening her reading-glass, stooped
to the page which that gentleman had pointed out. She
glanced with assumed indifference over the details of the
examination of Daniel Mann, while she devoured its mean-
ing with an agonizing closeness of scrutiny. The passage
which concerned her most was the following:
"Questioned, If he were known to the deceased Eily
O'Connor; answereth, He hath met such a one in Garry-
owen, but knoweth nothing farther. Questioned, If he
heard of her death; answereth, Nay. Questioned, if he
knoweth a certain Lowry Looby, living; answereth, Yes.
Questioned, Whether Eily O'Connor did not lodge for a
time in the house of Philip Naughten, Killarney; answer-
eth, How should he be aware of his brother-in-law's
lodgers? Saith, He knoweth not. Questioned, If he
were not present in said Naughten's house, when said
Eily, deceased, said Looby being then in Naughten's
kitchen, did give a letter to Poll Naughten, sister to
prisoner, addressed to Dunat O'Leary, hair-cutter, Garry-
owen, and containing matter in the handwriting of said
Eily; answereth, How should he (prisoner) see through
a stone wall? Saith, He was in the kitchen. Saith,
Looby was a fool, and that his eyes were not fellows.
Saith, He knoweth not who was in the said inner room.
Questioned, Why he was discharged out of the employ-
ment of his master, Mr. Hardress Cregan; answereth,
He knoweth not. Questioned, Where he hath been resid-
ing since he left his master's service; answereth, It is a
token that examinant doth not know, or he would not

37.2 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
ask. And the like impertinent and futile answers, with
sundry speeches little to the purpose, hath the prisoner
responded to all subsequent inquiries."
With a feeling of relief, Mrs. Cregan returned the book
to the clerk, and glancing towards the prisoner, observed
that his eye was fixed on hers with a look of shrewd and
anxious inquiry. To this glance she returned one equally
comprehensive in its meaning. It told him she was fully
in the counsels of her son, and prepared him to be guided
by her eye.
At the same moment the sentinel was heard presenting
arms at the door, and a corporal entered to say that Mr.
Warner's messenger had returned, and that the witnesses
might be expected in a few minutes.
"All's right, then," said Mr. Warner, who entered on
a scrutiny of this kind with the same professional gout
which might make Xenophon find excitement amid the
difficulties and intricacies of his famous retreat. "Remove
She prisoner. We shall examine them apart, and see if
their stories will bear the jangling. If they are all as
much given to the negative as this fellow, I am afraid we
shall find it hard to make them jar."
This was a moment of intense anxiety to Mrs. Cregan.
She saw no probability of being able to communicate
with the prisoners (for such were all the witnesses at
present); and she comprehended all the importance of
preventing, at least, the chance of Hardress's name being
mingled up with the account of the unknown visitor at
the cottage of the Naughtens.
A little experience, however, in the proceedings of Irish
law courts would have given her more courage and com.
fort on this subject. The peasantry of Ireland have, for
centuries, been at war with the laws by which they are
governed, and watch their operation in every instance
with a jealous eye. Even guilt itself, however naturally
atrocious, obtains a commiseration in their regard, from
the mere spirit of opposition to a system of government
which they consider as unfriendly. There is scarcely a
cottage in the south of Ireland where the very circum-
stance of legal denunciation would not afford, even to a
## p. 373 (#377) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 373
murderer, a certain passport to concealment and protec-
tion. To the same cause may be traced, in all likelihood,
the shrewdness of disguise, the closeness, the affected
dulness, the assumed simplicity, and all the inimitable
subtleties of evasion and of wile which an Irish peasant
can display when he is made to undergo a scene of judi-
cial scrutiny, in which he will frequently display a degree
of gladiatorial dexterity which would throw the spirit of
Machiavelli into ecstasies.
While Mrs. Cregan remained endeavouring to control
the workings of her apprehension, a bustle was heard out-
side the door, in which the sound of a female voice, raised
high in anger and remonstrance, overtopped the rest in
loudness, like a soprano voice in a chorus.
"Let me in l' she exclaimed, in a fierce tone; "do
you want to thrust your scarlet jacket between the tree
and the rind? Let me in, you tall ramrod, or I'll pull the
soap and powder out of your wig. If I had you on the
mountains, I'd cut the pig's tail from your pole, and make
a show o' you. Do, do draw your bay'net on me, you
cowardly object. It's like the white blood o' the whole of
ye! I know fifty lads of your size, that would think as
little of tripping you up on a fair-green, and making a
high-road of your powdered carcass, as I do of snapping
my fingers in your face! That for your rusty bay'net, you
woman's match l'" Here she burst into the room and
confronted the magistrate, while the sentinel muttered,
"Well! you're a rum one, you are, as ever I see."
"Danny a'ra, gall Oh, vo, ohone, achree, asthora! is
that the way with you? What did you do to 'em 2
what's the matther?"
"Dat de hands may stick to me, Poll, if I know,"
returned the prisoner, while she moaned and wept over
him with a sudden passion of grief. "Dey say 'tis to kill
some one I done. Dey say one Eily O'Connor was a
lodger of ours westwards, an' dat I tuk her out of a night
an' murdered her. Isn't dat purty talk? Sure you know
yourself we had no lodgers."
"Remove that prisoner," said Mr. Warner; "he must
not be present at her examination."
## p. 374 (#378) ############################################
374 the COLLErn BAWN
"I'll engage I have no longin' for it," returned Danny.
"She knows right well that it is all talks, an''tis well I
have found a friend at last dat'll see me out o' trouble."
Danny was removed, and the examination of Poll
Naughten was commenced by the magistrate. She had
got but one hint from her brother to guide her in her
answers, and on all other topics she came to the resolu-
tion of admitting as little as possible.
"Your name is Poll Naughten? Stay, she is not
sworn. Hand her the book."
She took the volume with an air of surly assurance,
and repeated the form of the oath.
"She did not kiss it," whispered Mr. Houlahan, with a
sagacious anxiety; "she only kissed her thumb. I had
my eye upon her."
"Had you? Well, gi' me the book till I plaze that
gentleman. Is that the way you'd like to lip the leather?"
she said, after a smack that went off like a detonating-cap.
"Is that done to your liking, sir?"
Mr. Houlahan treated this query with silence, and the
examination proceeded.
"Poll Naughten is your nameis it not?"
"Polly Mann they christened me for want of a betther,
an' for want of a worse I took up with Naughten."
"You live in the Gap of Dunloe?"
"Iss, when at home."
"Did you know the deceased Eily O'Connor?"
"Eily who?"
"O'Connor."
"I never knew a girl o' that name."
"Take care of your answers. We have strong evi.
dence."
"If you have it as sthrong as a cable, you may make
the most of it. You have my answer."
"Do you know a person of the name of Looby ?"
"I do, to be sure, for my sins I believe."
"Do you remember his being in your house in last
autumn P"
"I do, well; an' I'd give him his tay the same night if
it wasn't for raisons."

"Did you give him a letter on that evening?"
"He made more free than welcome, a dale. I can tell
him that."
"Answer my question. Did you give him a letter?"
"Oyeh, many's the thing I gev him, an' I'm sorry I
didn't give him a thing more along with 'em, an' that's a
good flakin'."
"Well, I don't deny you credit for your good wishes
in that respect, but still I wait to have my question
answered. Did you give Looby a letter on that even-
ing P"
"Listen to me now, plase your honour. That the head
may go to the grave with me zy
"Those asseverations, my good woman, are quite
superfluous. You should remember you are on your
oath."
"Well, I am; sure I know I am upon my oath, an' as
I am upon it, an' by the vartue o' that oath, I swear I
never Swopped a word with Lowry Looby from that day
to this."
"Whew " said the magistrate, "there's an answer.
Hear me, my good woman. If you won't speak out, we
shall find a way to make you speak."
"No use in wasting blows upon a willing horse. I can
do no more than speak to the best of my ability."
"Very well. I ask you again, therefore, whether Looby
received a letter from you on that evening P"
"Does Lowry say I gev him a letther?"
"You will not answer, then?"
"To be sure I will. What am I here for?"
"To drive me mad, I believe."
"Faiks, I can't help you," said Poll, "when you won't
listen to me."
"Well, well, speak on."
"I will, then, without a word of a lie. I'll tell you
that whole business, and let Lowry himself conthradict
me if he daar to do it. 'Tis as good as six years ago,
now, since I met that boy at one o' the Hewsan's wakes."
"Well, what has that to do with an answer to a plain
question?"

"Easy a minute, can't you, an' I'll tell you. He
behaved very polished that night, an' I seen no more of
him until the day you spake of, when he came into the
cottage from Killarney."
"Woman," said the magistrate, "remember that you
have sworn to tell the whole truth; not only the truth,
but the whole truth."
"Ah, then, gentleman an' lady, d'ye hear this? Did
anybody ever hear the peer o' that? Sure, it's just the
whole truth I'm tellin' him, an' he won't listen to the half
of it."
"Go on," said Mr. Warner, in a tone of resignation.
"Sure that's what I want to do, if I'd be let. I say
this, an' I'll stand to it; Lowry gave me impidence that
I wouldn't stand from his masther, an' I did (let him
make the most of it), I admit it, I did give him a sthroke
or two. I did. I admit it."
"And afther the sthrokes, as you call them, you gave
him a letter?"
"What letther?"
"I see? you are very copious of your admissions. Are
you Philip Naughten's wife?"
44 I am."
"Ay, now we're upon smooth ground. You can give
an answer when it suits you. I'm afraid you are too
many for me. What shall we do with this communicative
person?" he said, turning to the other gentlemen.
"Remand her," said Captain Gibson, whose face was
purple from suppressed laughter, "and let us have the
husband."
"With all my heart," returned Mr. Warner. "Take
that woman into another room, and bring up Philip
Naughten. Take care, moreover, that they do not speak
upon the way."
Poll was removed, a measure which she resented by
shrill and passionate remonstrances, affecting to believe
herself very ill treated. Her husband was next admitted,
and from his humble, timid, and deprecating manner,
at once afforded the magistrate some cause of gratula-
tion; and Mrs. Cregan of deep and increasing anxiety.
## p. 377 (#381) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 377
He approached the table with a fawning smile upon his
coarse features, and a helpless, conciliating glance at
svery individual around him.
"Now, we shall have something," said Mr. Warner;
"this fellow has a more tractable eye. Your name is
Philip Naughten, is it not?"
The man returned an answer in Irish, which the magis-
trate cut short in the middle.
"Answer me in English, friend. We speak no Irish
here. Is your name Philip Naughten?"
"The wisha, vourneen 32
"Come, comeEnglish. Swear him to know whether
he does not understand English. Can you speak English,
fellow P" '',
"Not a word, plase your honour."
A roar of laughter succeeded this escapade, to which
the prisoner listened with a wondering and stupid look.
Addressing himself in Irish to Mr. Cregan, he appeared
to make an explanatory speech, which was accompanied
by a slight expression of indignation.
"What does the fellow say?" asked Mr. Warner.
"Why," said Cregan, with a smile, "he says he will
admit that he couldn't be hung in English before his face,"
but he does not know enough of the language to enable
him to tell his story in English."
"Well, then, I suppose we must have it in Irish. Mr.
Houlahan, will you act as interpreter?"
The clerk, who thought it genteel not to know Irish,
bowed, and declared himself unqualified.
"Wisha, then," said a gruff voice at a little distance,
in a dark corner of the room, "it isn't but what you had
opportunities enough of learning it. If you went to foreign
parts, what would they say to you, do you think, when
you'd tell 'em you didn't know the language of the coun-
thry where you were born? You ought to be ashamed o'
yourself, so you ought."
* A common phrase, meaning that the individual understood
enough of the language to refute any calumny spoken in his pre-
sence, which, if uncontradicted, might leave him in danger of the
halter. The acute reader may detect in this pithy idiom a meaning
characteristic of the country in which it is used.
## p. 378 (#382) ############################################
378 The COLLEEN BAWN.
This speech, which proceeded from the unceremonious
Dan Dawley, produced some smiling at the expense of
the euphuistic secretary, after which the steward himself
was sworn to discharge the duties of the office in question.
The preliminary queries having been put and answered,
the interpreter proceeded to ask, at the magistrate's sug-
gestion, whether the witness was acquainted with the de-
ceased Eily O'Connor.
But if it had been the policy of Mrs. Naughten to admit
as little as possible, it seemed to be the policy of her hus-
band to admit nothing at all. The subterfuge of the
former in denying a knowledge of Eily, under her maiden
name (which, she imagined, saved her from the guilt of
perjury), was an idea too brilliant for her husband. He
gaped upon the interpreter in silence for some moments,
and then looked on the magistrate as if to gather the
meaning of the question.
"Repeat it for him," said the latter.
Dawley did so.
"'Tis the answer he makes me, plase your honour,"
ne said, "that he's a poor man that lives by industhering."
"That's no answer. Repeat the question once more,
and tell him I shall commit him for trial if he will not
answer it."
Again the question was put, and listened to with the
same plodding, meditative look, and answered with a
Countenance of honest grief, and an apparent anxiety to
3e understood, which would have baffled the penetration
of any but a practised observer. So earnest was his
manner, that Mr. Warner really believed he was returning
a satisfactory answer. But he was disappointed.
"He says," continued the interpreter, "that when he
was a young man he rented a small farm from Mr.
O'Connor, of Crag-beg, near Tralee. He has as much
thricks in him, plase your honour, as a rabbit. I'd as
lieve be brakin' stones to a paviour as putting questions
to a rogue of his kind."
Threats, promises of favour, lulling queries, and moral
expedients of every kind, were used to draw him out into
the communicative frankness which was desired. But he
## p. 379 (#383) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 379
remained as adamant. He could or would admit nothing
more than that he was a poor man, who lived by his in-
dustry, and that he had rented a small farm from Mr.
O'Connor, of Crag-beg.
The prisoners, therefore, after a short consultation,
were all remanded, in order that time might be afforded
for confronting them with the friends of the unhappy
Eily. Mrs. Cregan, with the feeling of one who has
stood all day before a burning furnace, hurried to the
room of Hardress to indulge the tumult which was gather-
ing in her bosom ; and the gentlemen, by a special in-
vitation (which could no more be declined without
offence in the Ireland of those days than in a Persian
cottage), adjourned to the consolations of Mrs. Chute's
dining-parlour. Separate places of confinement were
allotted to the prisoners; a sentinel was placed over each,
and the remainder of the party, notwithstanding the re-
monstrances of Captain Gibson, were all entertained like
princes in the servants' hall.

CHAPTER XL.
HOW HARDRESS TOOK A DECISIVE STEP FOR HIS OWN
SECURITY.
THE hospitalities of Castle Chute were on this evening
called into active exercise. If the gravest occasion of
human life, the vigil of the dead, was not in those days
always capable of restraining the impetuous spirit of en-
joyment so much indulged in Irish society, how could it
be expected that a mere anxiety for the interests of jus-
tice could interrupt the flow of their social gaiety? Be
fore midnight the house rang with laughter, melody, and
uproar, and in an hour after every queue in the servants'
hall was brought into a horizontal position. Even the
three that stalked on guard were said to oscillate on their
posts with an ominous motion, as the bells in churches
forebode their fall when shaken by an earthquake. Har-

dress continued too unwell to make his appearance, and
this circumstance deprived the company of the society of
Anne Chute, and indeed of all the ladies, who took a
quiet and rather mournful cup of tea by the drawing-room
fire. The wretched subject of their solicitude lay burning
on his bed, and listening to the boisterous sounds of
mirth that proceeded from the distant parlour, with the
ears of a dreaming maniac.
The place in which his boatman was confined had
been a stable, but was now become too ruinous for use.
It was small and roughly paved. The rack and manger
were yet attached to the wall, and a few slates, displaced
upon the roof, admitted certain glimpses of moonshine,
which fell cold and lonely on the rough, unplastered wall
and eaves, making the house illustrious, like that of
Sixtus V. Below, on a heap of loose straw, sat the squalid
prisoner, warming his fingers over a small fire, heaped
against the wall; and listening in silence to the unsteady
tread of the sentinel, as he strode back and forward be-
fore the stable door, and hummed, with an air of sup-
pressed and timid joviality, the words
"We won't go home till morning,
We won't go home till morning,
We won't go home till morning,
Until the dawn appears 1"
A small square window, closed with a wooden bar and
shutters, was to be found above the rack, and opened on
a hay-yard, which, being raised considerably above the
level of the stable-floor, lay only a few feet beneath this
aperture. Danny Mann was in the act of devouring a
potato, reeking hot, which he had cooked in the embers,
when a noise at the window made him start, and set his
ears like a watch-dog. It was repeated. He stood on
his feet, and crept softly into a darker corner of the stable,
partly in superstitious apprehension, and partly in obe-
dience to an impulse of natural caution. In a few minutes
one of the shutters was gently put back, and a flood of
mild light was poured into the prison. The shadow of
a hand and head were thrown with great distinctness of
outline on the opposite wall; the other shutter was put
## p. 381 (#385) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 381
back with the same caution, and in a few moments nearly
the whole aperture was again obscured, as if by the body
of some person entering. Such, in fact, was the case;
and the evident substantiality of the figure did not remove
the superstitious terrors of the prisoner, when he beheld
a form wrapt in white descending by the bars of the rack,
after having made the window close again, and the apart-
ment, in appearance, as gloomy as ever.
The intruder stood at length upon the floor, and the
face, which was revealed in the brown fire-light, was that
of Hardress Cregan. The ghastliness of his mouth and
.eeth, the wildness of his eyes, and the strangeness of his
attire (for he had only wrapped the counterpane around
his person), might, in the eyes of a stranger, have con-
firmed the idea of a supernatural appearance. But these
circumstances only tended to arouse the sympathy and
old attachment of his servant. Danny Mann advanced
towards him slowly, his hands wreathed together, and
extended as far as the sling which held the wounded arm
would allow; his jaw dropthalf in pity and half in fear,
and his eyes filled with tears.
"Masther Hardress," he said at length, "is it you I
see dat way?" Hardress remained for some time motion-
less as a statue, as if endeavouring to summon up all his
corporeal energies to support him in the investigation
which he was about to make.
"Won't you speak to me, masther?" continued the
boatman; "won't you speak a word itself? 'Twas all
my endeavour since I came hether to thry an' get 'em to
let me speak to you. Say a word, masther, if it is only
to tell me 'tis yourself dat's dere !"
"Where is Eily P" murmured Hardress, still without
moving, and in a tone that seemed to come from the re-
cesses of his breast, like a sound from a sepulchre. The
boatman shrank aside, as if from the eye of Justice itself.
So sudden had the question struck upon his conscience,
that the inquirer was obliged to repeat it before he could
collect his breath for an answer.
"Masther Hardress, I tought, after I parted you dat
22
time
## p. 382 (#386) ############################################
382 The COLLEEN BAWN.
"Where is Eily?" muttered Hardress, interrupting him.
"Only listen to me, sir, one moment -"
"Where is Eily?"
"Oh, vol vo!"
Hardress drew the counterpane around his head, and
remained for several minutes silent in the same attitude.
IDuring that time the drapery was scarcely seen to move,
and yet Hell raged beneath it. A few moans of deep but
smothered agony were all that might be heard from time
to time. So exquisite was the sense of suffering, which
these sounds conveyed, that Danny sank trembling on
his knees, and responded to them with floods of tears and
sobbing.
"Masther Hardress," he said, "if dere's anything dat
I can do to make your mind aisy, say de word. I know
dis is my own business, and no one else's. An' if dey find
me out itself, dey'll never be one straw de wiser of who
advised me to it. If you tink I'd tell, you don't know
me. Dey may hang me as high as dey like; dey may
flake de life out o' me, if dey plase; but dey never'll get
a word outside my lips of what it was dat made me do it.
Didn't dey try me to-day, an' didn't I give 'em a sign o'
what I'd do P"
"Peace, hypocrite " said Hardress, disgusted at a show
of feeling to which he gave no credit. "Be still, and
hear me. For many years, it has been my study to heap
kindnesses upon you. For which of those was it that you
came to the determination of involving me in ruin, danger,
and remorse, for all my future lifea little all it may be,
certainly P"
It would seem from the manner in which Danny gaped
and gazed on his master while he said these words, that a
reproach was one of the last things he had expected to
receive from Hardress. Astonishment, blended with some-
thing like indignation, took place of the compassion which
before was visible upon his countenance.
"I don't know how it is, Masther Hardress," he said.
"Dere are some people dat it is hard to plase. Do you
remember saying anything to me at all of a time in de
room at de masther's, at Killarney, Masther Hardress?
## p. 383 (#387) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 383
Do you remember givin' me a glove at all? I had my
token surely for what I done."
So saying, he drew the glove from his waistcoat, and
handed it to his master; but the latter rejected it with a
revulsion of strong dislike.
"I tought I had ears to hear at dat time, and brains to
understand," said Danny, as he replaced the fatal token
in his bosom, "an' I'm sure it was no benefit to me dat
dere should be a hue-and-cry over de mountains after a
lost lady, an' a chance of a hempen cravat, for my trouble.
But I had my warrantdat was your very word, Masther
Hardresswarrant, wasn't it? "Well, when you go,'
says you, "here is your warrant,' an' you ga' me de glove.
Worn't dem your words?"
"But not for death," said Hardress. "I did not say
for death."
"I own you didn't," returned Danny, who was aroused
by what he considered a shuffling attempt to escape out
of the transaction. "I own you didn't; I felt for you, an'
I wouldn't wait for you to say it. But did you mane it?"
"No 1" Hardress exclaimed, with a burst of sudden
energy. "As I shall answer it in that bright Heaven, I
did not. If you crowd in among my accusers at the
judgment-seat, and charge me with that crime, to you,
and to all, I shall utter the same disclaimer that I do at
present. I did not mean to practise on her life. As I
shall meet with her before that judge, I did not. I even
bade you to avoid it. Did I not warn you not to touch
her?"
"You did," said Danny Mann, with a scorn which
made him eloquent beyond himself, "an' your eye looked
murder while you said it. After dis, I never more will
look in any man's face to know what he manes. After
dis, I won't believe my senses. If you'll persuade me to
it, I'll own dat dere is noting as I see it. You may tell
me I don't stand here, nor you dere, nor dat de moon is
shining trough that roof above us, nor de fire burning at
my back, an' I'll not gainsay you after dis. But listen to
me, Masther Hardress. As sure as dat moon is shining,
an' dat fire burning, an' as sure as I'm here an' you dere,

384 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
so sure de sign of death was on your face dat time, what-
ever way your words went."
"From what could you gather it?" said Hardress, with
a deprecating accent.
"From what? From everything. Listen hether. Didn't
you remind me den of my own offer on de Purple
Mountain a while before, an' tell me dat, if I was to make
dat offer again, you'd tink different? An' didn't you give
me de token dat you refused me den P. Ah, dis is what
makes me sick, after I putting my neck into de halter for
a man. Well, it's all one. An' now to call me out o' my
name, an' to tell me I done it for harm | Dear knows, it
wasn't for any good I hoped for it, here or hereafter, or
for any pleasure I took in it, dat it was done. And talkin'
of hereafter, Masther Hardress, listen to me. Eily O'Con-
nor is in Heaven, an' she has told her story. Dere are
two books kept dere, dey tell us, of all our doings, good
an' bad. Her story is wrote in one o' dem books, an' my
name (I'm sore afeerd) is wrote after it; an' take my
word for dis, in whichever o' dem books my name is
wrote, your own is not far from it."
As he spoke these words, with an energy beyond what
he had ever shown, the fire fell in, and caused a sudden
light to fill the place. It shone, ruddy brown, upon the
excited face and uplifted arm of the deformed, and gave
him the appearance of a fiend denouncing on the head of
the affrighted Hardress the sentence of eternal woe. It
glared likewise upon the white drapery of the latter, and
gave to his distorted and terrified features a look of
ghastliness and fear that might have suited such an occa-
sion well. The dreadful picture continued but for a
second, yet it remained engraved upon the mind of Har-
dress, and, like the yelling of the hounds, haunted him,
awake and dreaming, to his death. The fire again sunk
low, the light grew dim. It came like a dismal vision,
and like a vision faded.
They were aroused from the pause to which this slight
incident gave occasion by hearing the sentinel arrest his
steps as he passed the door, and remain silent in his song,
as if in the act of listening.
## p. 385 (#389) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 385
*All right within there?" said the sentinel, with his
head to the door. -
"All's right your way, but not my way," returned Danny,
sulkily.
In a few minutes they heard him shoulder his musket
once again, and resume his walk, humming with an air of
indifference the same old burthen:
"We won't go home till morning,
Until the dawn appears."
Hardress remained gazing on his servant for some
moments, and then said in a whisper:
"He has not heard us, as I feared. It is little worth,
at this time, to consider on whom the guilt of this unhappy
act must fall. We must at least avoid the shame, if pos-
sible. Could I depend upon you once again, if I assisted
in your liberation, on the understanding that you would
at once leave the country?"
The eyes of the prisoner sparkled with a sudden light.
"Do you tink me a fool?" he said. "Do you tink a
fox would refuse to run to earth wid de dogs at his
brush P" -
"Here, then," said Hardress, placing a purse in his
hand, "I have no choice but to trust you. This window.
is unguarded. There is a pathway through the hay-yard,
and thence across the field, in the direction of the road.
Depart at once, and without farther question." -
"But what'll I do about dat fellow?" said Danny.
"Dat sentry comes constant dat way; you hear him now
asking me if all's right."
"I will remain here and answer for you," said Hardress,
"until you have had time to escape. In the meantime,
use your utmost speed, and take the road to Cork, where
you will be sure to find vessels ready to sail. If ever we
should meet again on Irish soil, it must be for the death
of either, most probably of both."
"An' is dis de way we part after all !" said Danny.
"Well, den, be it so. Perhaps, after you tink longer of
it, master, you may tink better of me." So saying, he
sprang on the manger, and ascended (notwithstanding his
2 B

hurt) with the agility of a monkey to the window. A
touch undid the Iastening, and in a few moments Hardress
became the sole occupant of the temporary dungeon.
He remained for a considerable time leaning with his
shoulder against the wall, and gazing with a vacant eye
upon the decaying fire. In this situation, the sentinel
challenged several times in succession, and seemed well
content with the answers which he received. But the
train of thought which passed through the mind of
Hardress became at length so absorbing that the chal-
lenge of the soldier fell unheard upon his ear. After
repeating it without avail three or four times, the man
became alarmed, and applying the butt of his musket to
the door, he forced it in without much effort. His
astonishment may be conceived, when, instead of his
little prisoner, he beheld a tall figure wrapt in white, and
a ghastly face, on which the embers shed a dreary light.
The fellow was a brave soldier, but (like all people
of that class in his time) extremely superstitious. His
brain, moreover, was heated with whisky punch, and his
imagination excited by numberless tales of horror which
had been freely circulated in the servants' hall. Enough
only remained of his presence of mind to enable him to
give the alarm, by firing his musket, after which he fell
senseless on the pavement. Hardress, no less alarmed,
started into sudden energy, and climbing to the window
with an agility even surpassing that of the fugitive,
hurried off in the direction of his sleeping-chamber.
There were few in the house who were capable of
adopting any vigorous measures on hearing the alarm.
Hastening to the spot, they found the sentinel lying
senseless across the stock of his musket, the stable-door
open, and the prisoner fled. The man himself was
enabled, after some time, to furnish a confused and broken
narrative of what he had seen; and his story was in
some degree confirmed by one of his comrades, who stated
that at the time when the shot was fired, he beheld a tall
white figure glidizi rapidly amongst the haystacks, in the
little enclosure, where it vanished in the shape of a red
heifer.
## p. 387 (#391) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 387
The sentinel was placed under arrest in an apartment
of the castle, until the pleasure of his officer could be
known respecting him. Captain Gibson, however, in
common with the other gentlemen, and the greater
number of his soldiers, was at this moment wholly
incapable either of conceiving or expressing any opinion
whatsoever.
This story, as usual, was circulated throughont the
country in the course of the following day, with many
imaginative embellishments. Amongst other inventions,
it was said that the ghost of Eily O'Connor had appeared
to the sentinel to declare the prisoner's innocence and
demand his liberation. Many persons adduced the well-
known character of Eily as a ground for lending credence
to this fiction. "It was like her," they said; "she was
always a tender-hearted creature."
The evidence remaining against the other prisoners
was now so immaterial, that their dismissal became a
necessary consequence. Several efforts were made to
draw them into some confession of their participation in
the offence alleged, but if they were cautious in their
admissions while the murderer was in custody, they
would make no admission whatever after hearing of his
escape. Equally unavailing were all the exertions made
for the recapture of the suspected fugitive, and in a few
weeks the affair had begun to grow unfamiliar to the
tongues and recollections of the people.
Notwithstanding the assurances of Danny, and the
danger which he must incur by remaining in the country,
a doubt would frequently cross the mind of Hardress,
whether he really had availed himself of his recovered
freedom, to leave it altogether. He had money; he had
many acquaintances; he was an Irishmanan indifferent
one, it is true, but yet possessing the love of expense, of
dissipation, and the recklessness of danger, which mingle
so largely in the temperament of his countrymen. It was
: Most an even question whether he would not risk the
chances of detection for the sake of playing the host
among a circle of jolly companions in the purlieus of his
native city. These considerations, often discussed between

Hardress and his now miserable mother, made them
agree to hasten the day of marriage, with the understand-
ing that (by an anticipation of the modern fashion) the
"happy pair" were to leave home immediately after the
ceremony. The south of France was the scene fixed upon
for the commencement of their married lifethe month
of honey.

CHAPTER XLI.
HOW THE ILL-TEMPER OF HARDRESS AGAIN BROUGHT
BACK HIS PERILS.
A circumstancE which occurred during the intervening
period, once more put Hardress to a severe probation.
It was not less severe, moreover, that it came like the
accesses of a nervous disorder, suddenly, and from a cause
extremely disproportioned to its violence.
He had been conversing with his intended bride on
that day which was fixed upon as the penultimate of
their courtship, with a more than usual appearance of
enjoyment. Anne, who looked out for those breaks of
sunshine in his temper as anxiously as an agriculturist
might for fair weather in a broken autumn, encouraged
the symptom of returning peace, and succeeded so
happily as to draw him out into quick and lively repartees,
and frequent bursts of laughter. Unfortunately, however,
in her ecstasy at this display of spirits, she suffered
her joy to hurry her unwisely into the forbidden circle
which enclosed his secret, and their music turned to
discord. She thought this holiday hour afforded a fair
opportunity to penetrate into the Blue Chamber of his
heart, from which he had so often warned her, and which
a better impulse than curiosity urged her to explore.
She did not know that the interior was defiled with
blood.
"Well, Hardress," she said, with a smile that had as
imuch of feeling as of mirth, "is not this a happier score

for counting time than sitting down to shut our eyes and
ears to the pleasant world about us, and opening them on
a lonesome past or a foreboding future?"
If the clouds of the past and the future both had met
and mingled in the mid-heaven of consciousness, they
could not have cast a darker or more sudden shade than
that which now overspread the brow of Hardress. The
laughter darkened on his cheek, his eye grew stern and
dull, and his whole being, from the inmost feeling of his
nature to the exterior on which those feelings were
indicated, seemed to have undergone an instantaneous
change.
Anne perceived her error, but did not cease to follow
up her claim upon his confidence.
"Do not let me feel," she said, "that I have brought
back your gloom. Dear Hardress, hear me still without
uneasiness. My sole intention is that of procuring your
health and peace of mind; and surely it should not be
considered an intrusion that I desire your confidence.
Do you fear to find in me anything more foreign than a
near and interested friend? Believe me, you shall not,
Hardress. I am driven upon this inquiry in spite of me.
There is something hidden from me which it would be
kinder to reveal. I see it prey upon your own health and
spirits, day after day. I see it even fixing its cruel hold
at length upon my aunt. You meet, with a consciousness
in your eyes, and you both glance from time to time at
me, as if I were a stranger orI should not say it,
perhapsa spy. If I come upon you when you speak
together, there is a hush at my appearance, and some-
times an embarrassed look, and I have often seen trouble
in your eyes, and tears in hers. Tell me, my deat
Hardress, what is the cause of this? You either appre-
hend, or you have endured, some terrible misfortune. It
is not now the time to treat me as a stranger."
She ceased to speak, and seemed to expect an answer,
but Hardress said not a word. He remained with his
hands crossed on the back of the chair, his cheek resting
upon these, and his eyes fixed in gloomy silence on the
floor.

"Or, if you do not think me worthy of a confidence,"
Anne resumed, with some warmth, "at least Nay, but
I am ill-tempered now," she added, suddenly checking
herself. "I should not say that; I would say, Hardress,
if you really find yourself prevented from admitting me
into your confidence, at least assure yourself of this. If
it is anything in your present situationininI fear to
say too muchin your engagement with myself, that
interferes with your peace of mind, II-had rather
suffer anythingthanthanbe the cause of suffering
to you."
She turned away as she said these words, to hide from
him the burst of tears with which they were accom-
panied. She pressed her handkerchief against her lips,
and used a violent, though silent, effort to avoid the con-
vulsive utterance of the grief that struggled at her heart.
It often happens that the most sensitive persons are
those who are most blind to, and make least allowance
for, the susceptibility of others. The long habit of
brooding over his own wants and sufferings made Har-
dress incapable, for the moment, of appreciating the
generous affection which this speech evinced. He
answered gloomily that, "there were many things in the
minds of all men which they would hide, if possible, even
from themselves, and which therefore they could not
reasonably be expected to communicate over-readily to
another, however undeniable the claim to confidence
might be."
With this cold answer the conversation ceased. A
little, yet but a little, warmed, to find her generous
proposal (a proposal which cost her so much agony) thus
unhandsomely received, Anne dried her tears, and re-
mained for some minutes in that sorrowing and somewhat
indignant composure, to which in virtuous breasts the
sense of unmerited injury gives birth. Subduing, however,
as she had long since learned to do, her personal feelings
to a sense of duty, she forced herself to assume an air of
cheerfulness, and once more resumed the tone of conver-
sation which had preceded this unfortunate failure.
Again her wonted spirits arose at her desire, and again

sne was successful in withdrawing Hardress from his
mood of dismal meditation.
One remarkable feature in the mental disease of
Hardress (for such it might now be justly termed) was, as
we have before remarked, the extreme uncertainty and
arbitrariness of its accesses. His existence seemed to be
without a basis, his mind without a centre or a rest. He
had no consciousness of duty to support him, no help from
Heaven, and no trust in man. Even the very passion
that ate up his soul was incapable of affording to his mind
that firmness of purpose and false strength which passion
often gives; for his was merely retrospective, and had no
object in the future. He became a passive slave to his
imagination. Frequently, while enjoying a degree of
comparative tranquillity, the thought would suggest itself
to his fancy, that, "perhaps this very day, secure as he
believed himself, might see him manacled and in a
dungeon."
Instead of quietly turning his attention away to an in-
different subject, or baffling the suggestions (as a guiltless
person might) by resigning himself to a directing Provi-
dence, he combated it with argument; it increased and
fastened on his imagination, until at length his nerves
began to thrill, his limbs grew faint, his brow moist, and
his whole being disturbed as at the presence of an actual
danger. At other times, when sitting alone, it would
occur to him that his servant might, notwithstanding
his caution, have abused his confidence and remained
in the country. The idea of the danger, the ruin, which
would most probably attend such disobedience, fre-
quently produced so violent an effect upon his mind,
that he would spring from his seat in a transport of
frenzy, sink on one knee, and press both hands with his
utmost force against the ground as if in the act of
strangling the delinquent. Then, hearing the footstep
of Anne, or his mother, approaching the door, he would
arise suddenly, covered with shame, and reach his chair
exactly in time to avoid detection.
Soon after the conversation we have above detailed,
Mr. Cregan entered, and some auestions arose on the

escape of Mr. Warner's prisoner, and the possibility of
his recapture. This led naturally to a disquisition on
the nature of the crime alleged against him, and of
capital punishments in general.
"People have hinted," said Mr. Cregan, "that this
might have been a case of suicide; and, for my part, I
don't see the impossibility."
"I should think it very unlikely," said Anne. "Sui-
cide is a very un-Irish crime. The people are too reli-
gious for it, and some people say too miserable."
"Too miserable !" exclaimed Mr. Cregan. "Now, I
should think that the only cause in the world for suicide
the only possible palliative."
"I am not metaphysical enough to account for it," re-
turned Anne, with a smile, "and I only repeat a senti-
ment which I heard once from Hardress. But their
misery, at all events, is a cause for their piety, and in
that way may be a cause of their resignation also."
"Of all crimes," said Mr. Cregan, "that is the most
absurd and unaccountable, and I wonder how jurymen
can reconcile it to themselves to bring in their shameful
verdicts of insanity so constantly as they do. When you
hear of a fellow's cutting his throat, look at the inquest,
and if you can't laugh at the evidence, you have nothing
in you. "The deceased was observed to be rather silent
and melancholy the day before; he wore his hat on one
side, a fashion which his nearest acquaintances had never
observed him to use till then ; he called his wife out of
her name, and went into the rain without an umbrella."
I should like to see how far such evidence would go to
prove a case of lunacy in Chancery."
"Then you would, I suppose, uncle, have the law put
in force in all its rigourconfiscation of property, and
impaling the body on a cross-road?"
"Impaling the bodies l'exclaimed Cregan, in a trans-
port of zeal; "I would almost have 'em impaled alive 1
Why do you laugh? A bull, is it? Adad, and so it is.
Then it is time for me to cut and run." So saying, he
made his exit with the utmost speed, while his niece
leaned aside and laughed.

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 393
Hardress heard all this with what might be supposed
the sensation of one who finds himself struck by death
while witnessing a farce. But he succeeded in conceal-
ing his emotions from the observation of his young
friend.
The time was now arrived for their customary morning
walk, and Anne arranged her bonnet and cloak before the
large pier-glass, while she continued from time to time to
address herself to Hardress. He had already taken his
hat and gloves, and, not liking the subjects on which she
was speaking, paced up and down the room in gloomy
and fretful impatience.
"What a dreadful death hanging must bel" said Anne
as she curled up a wandering tress upon her fingers. "I
wonder how any temptation can induce people to run
the risk of it."
"Come," said Hardress, "the morning will change if
you delay."
"An instant only. If you would but deliver yourself
up for a moment to such a day-dream, you may imagine
something of the horror of it. Suppose yourself now,
Hardress, marching along between two priests, with a
hangman after you, and the rope about your neck, and a
great crowd of people shouldering each other to obtain
One glance at youand xx
"There's a rain-cloud in the west," said Hardress;
"we shall lose the best part of the day."
"I am just ready," returned Anne; but let me finish
my picture. Imagine yourself now at the place of execu-
tion; that you feel your elbows tied behind, and that
shocking cap put down upon your eyes."
"Yes, yes, it is very pretty," said Hardress, peevishly;
"but I wish you would think of what you are about."
"You ascend, and there is a dreadful buzz amongst
the people; your heart beats, your brain grows dizzy,
you feel the hangman's iron fingers on your neck; the
drop seems unfirm beneath your feet."
"You will drive me mad I'' roared Hardress, stamping
on the floor in a paroxysm of fury. "This is intoler-
able ! I bid you make yourself ready to walk, and,

instead of doing so, you talk of death and hangmen,
halters and ignominy, as if there was not real woe
enough on earth, without filling the air around us with
imaginary horrors. Forgive me, Anne," he added,
observing the air of astonishment and sudden reserve
with which she regarded him, as alarming as it was
ominous"forgive me for this ill-tempered language.
You know my very being hangs upon you; but I am
sick and sad, and full of splenetic thoughts."
"Hardress," said Anne, after a long pause, "I have
borne a great deal from you, but 
"Nay, Anne," said Hardress, taking her hand with
much anxiety and submissiveness of look, "do not say
more at present. If I could tell you what is passing in
my mind, you would pity, and not blame me. You are
almost the only thing in this world, in my present state
of ill-health, in which my heart is interested, and if you
look cold upon me, my life will indeed grow wintry.
This will not, I hope, continue under a sunnier sky and
more serene air. You must not be angry with me for
having a set of irritable nerves."
After an interval of silent reflection, Anne took his
arm without reply, and they proceeded on their walk.
She did not, however, cease to meditate seriously and
deeply on the scene which had just taken place.
The morning was fair, and freshened by a gentle wind.
The boat sped rapidly along the shores; the sea-gull sailed
with wings outspread and motionless upon the breeze;
the sea-lark twittered at the water's edge; the murmur of
the waves as they broke upon the strand sounded sweet
and distant; the green leaves quivered and sparkled
against the sunshine; the peasants laughed and jested
at their labour in the fields, and all was cheering, tender,
and pastoral around them.
On a sudden, as they approached an angle in the road,
the attention of our loiterers was caught by sounds of
boisterous mirth and rustic harmony. In a few seconds,
on reaching the turn, they beheld the persons from whom
the noise (for we dare not call it music) proceeded. A
number of young peasants, dressed out in mumming

masquerade, with their coats off, their waistcoats turned
the wrong side outward, their hats, shoulders, and knees.
decorated with gay ribbons (borrowed for the occasion
from their fair friends), their faces streaked with paint of
various colours, and their waists encircled with shawls
and sashes, procured, most probably, from the same
tender quarter. Many of them held in their hands long
poles, with handkerchiefs fluttering at the top, and form-
ing a double file on either side of half-a-dozen persons,
who composed the band, and whose attire was no less
gaudy than that of their companions. One held a
piccolo, another a fiddle, another a bagpipe. A fourth
made a dildorn" serve for a tambourine, and a fifth was
beating with a pair of spindles on the bottom of an
inverted tin can, while he imitated, with much drollery,
the important strut and Swagger of the military kettle-
drum. Behind, and on each side, were a number of
boys and girls, who, by their shrill clamour, made the
discord that prevailed among the musicians somewhat
less intolerable. Every face was bright with health and
gaiety, and not a few were handsome.
They came to a halt, and formed a semicircle across
the road, as Anne and Hardress came in sight. The
musicians struck up a jig, and one of the young men,
dragging out of the crowd, with both hands, a bashful
and unwilling country girl, began to time the music with
a rapid movement of heel and toe, which had a rough
grace of its own, and harmonised well with the rough-
hewn exterior of the peasant.
It is the custom at dances of this kind for the gentle-
man to find a partner for his fair antagonist, after he has
finished his own jig, and that partner, if he be a person
of superior rank, is expected to show his sense of the
honour done him by dropping something handsome, as
he is going, into the piper's hat. Neither is it in the
power of a stranger to decline the happiness that is
offered to him, for the people have a superstition that
such a churlishness (to say nothing of its utter want of

politeness) is ominous of evil to the lady, betokening the
loss of her lover at some future day. Hardress was
compelled, though much against his will, to comply with
the established usage, the bashful fair one insisting with
a great deal of good humour on her claim, and appealing
to Miss Chute for her influence with a supplicating tone
and eye.
While he was dancing, Anne passed the May-day
mummers (for so were the merry-makers termed), and
strolled on alone. On a sudden the music ceased, and
she heard a clamour commence, which had the sound
of strife. Turning hastily round, she beheld a strange
hurry amongst the crowd, and Hardress in the midst,
griping one of the mummers by the throat, and then
flinging him back with extreme violence against the dry-
stone wall on the road-side. The man rose again, and
looking after Hardress, tossed his hand above his head,
and shook it in a menacing way.
Hardress hurried away from the group, many of whom
remained gazing after him in astonishment, while others
gathered around the injured man, and seemed to inquire
the cause of this singular and unprovoked assault. The
same inquiry was made by Anne, who was astonished at
the appearance of terror, rage, and agitation that were
mingled in the demeanour of Hardress. He made some
confused and unsatisfactory answer, talked of the fellow's
insolence and his own warm temper, and hurried toward
the Castle by a shorter way than that which they had
taken in leaving it.
The wedding-feast was appointed for the evening of
the following day, and it was determined that the cere-
mony should take place early on the morning after the
entertainment. The articles had been already signed by
Anne, with a pale cheek, and a trembling, though not
reluctant hand. These circumstances made it impossible
for her to think of altering her intentions, nor did she,
with consciousness, even admit the idea to fasten on her
mind. Still, however, her anxiety became every hour
more trying and oppressive, and when she retired to rest
upon this evening, she could not avoid murmuring, in the

words of the plebeian elector of Coriolanus: "If 'twere to

CHAPTER XLII.
HOW MR. WARNER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND.
A MAN THAT COULD AND WOULD SPEAK ENGLISH.
ABOUT sunset, on the evening of the following day,
while Castle Chute and its vicinity were merry as wedd-
ing times could make them, Mr. Warner, the magistrate,
was quietly enjoying a bowl of punch with a friend at his
own table. That table was spread at the distance of
about eight miles from the Castle, and that friend was
Captain Gibson. Another individual, Mr. Houlahan,
the clerk, was seated at a distant corner of the table,
imbibing his fluid in silence; but as he was seldom
spoken to, and never ventured to mingle in the conversa-
tion himself, he could scarcely be considered as one of
the company.
"Come, Captain," said Mr. Warner, filling his glass,
and passing the bowl to the gallant officer, "I will give
you the bride."
"I shall drink it with all my heart," returned the
captain. "The bride," he added, raising the glass to his
lips, and honouring the toast with a draught of propor-
tionable profundity.
"And, talking of the bride," continued Mr. Warner,
"though I rejoice at it on my own account, as it gives
me the pleasure of your society, yet it puzzles me to
know, Captain, why you are not at the wedding to-night."
"For the best of all reasons," returned Mr. Gibson,
"because I wasn't asked."
"You may be certain, then, that there was some mis-
take in that, for the Chutes have always kept an open
house."
"I am sure of it. Well, what do you say if I give.
you the bridegroom, in return for your bride?"
## p. 398 (#402) ############################################
398 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
"I don't know. I had rather drink the lady."
"Oh! so should I, for that matter; but we have drunk
her."
"There's something mystical in that haughty young
man that I cannot like. His conduct, on many occasions,
lately, has given me anything but a favourable indication
of his character. I have sometimes been tempted to
thinkbut no, no," he added, suddenly interrupting
himself, "I should not indulge in those surmises, which,
after all, may be the suggestion of prejudice and rash
judgment. Come, sir, I will drink the bridegroom; and
allow me to add a sentiment: The bridegroom; and may
he show himself worthy of his fortune."
As he said these words, the parlour-door was opened,
and a servant appeared, to say that a stranger wished to
speak with Mr. Warner on judicial business.
"Pooh," said the magistrate; "some broken head or
sixpenny summons. Let him come to me to-morrow.
morning."
"He says his business is very pressing, sir; an' 'twill
be more your own loss than his if you let him go."
"What! is that the ground he goes on? Then I
suppose we must hear him. Captain, I know all these
examinations are amusing to you. Shall I have him in
here P"
"You could not do me a greater pleasure," said the
officer; "these people are the only actors on earth."
The stranger was accordingly showed up. His story
seemed to be almost told by his appearance, for one of
his eyes was blackened and puffed out, so as nearly to
disguise the entire countenance. There was in his tread
and action an appearance of gloomy determination,
which had something in it impressive, and even chilling.
The magistrate perceived at a glance that the affair was
of a more serious nature than he had at first suspected.
"Well, my good man," he said, in a gentle tone,
"what is your business with me?"
"I'm not a good man," said the stranger, "as my
business wid you will show. Arn't you de crowner dat

"I am."
'Did you find the murtherers yet?"
"They are not in custody, but we have strong informa-
tion."
"Well, if you have, maybe you don't want any more?"
said the man contemptuously, and seeming about to
depart.
"No, no, the more we obtain, the stronger our case
will be, of course."
"Den listen to me," said the stranger, "and I'll make
it strong enough for you."
"This instant," returned Mr. Warner. "Mr. Houlahan,
will you prepare your writing materials, and take down
this examination in the regular form P"
"Do," said the stranger. "Give me de book, an'
swear me: put every sentence in your book, for every
word I have to say is goold to you an' to de counsellors.
An' write down first dat Eily was surely murdered, an'
dat I, Danny Mann, was de one dat done de deed."
"Mann (* exclaimed the magistrate; "what our fugi.
tive prisoner?"
"I was your prisoner, till I was set at liberty by one
dat had a raison for doing it. I'm now come to deliver
myself up, an' to tell de whole truth, for I'm tired o' my
life."
The magistrate paused for a moment, in strong amaze-
ment.
"I think it my duty," said he, "to warn you on one
point. If you have been a principal in the murder, your
confession will not entitle you to mercy as an approver,
while it will be used as evidence against yourself, volun-
tarily tendered as it is."
"I don't want mercy," returned the stranger; "if I
did, it isn't in coorts I'd look for it. If I valued my life,
it was in my own hands already, an''tisn't here you'd find
me now. It was not the fear of death, nor the hope of
pardon, that brought me hether, but because I was desaved
and disappointed in one dat I tought more of dan of my
own life, a hundred times. Do you see dat mark f" he

In place of being, as I ought to be, fighting at the fair,
drinking at the wake, and dancing at the jig-house, dere's
de figure I cut all my days! If anybody vexed me, an I'd
even sthrike him, he wouldn't return the blow, for who 'd
take notice o' the little lord? If I sat down by a girl,
you'd think by her looks dat she wasn't shure of her life
until she got away. An' who have I to tank for dat? Mr.
Hardress Cregan. 'Twas he dat done it to me, an' I a
little boy. But if he did, he showed such feeling after
he cried so bitter, an' he cared so much for me, that my
heart warmed to him for my very loss itself. I never gev
him as much as a cross word or look for what he done,
nor never spoke of it until dis minute. I loved him from
dat very time twice more dan ever; but what's de use o'
talking? He's not de same man now. He met me
yesterday upon de road, an' what did he do? He sthruck
me first, but dat I'd bear aisy; he called me out o' my
name, an' dat I didn't mind; but I'll tell you what druv
me wild, he caught me by de troat, an' he flung me back
again de wall, just de same way as when he ga'e me my
hurt, an' made me a cripple for life. From dat moment a
change come in me towards him. He didn't feel for me,
an' I won't feel for him; he had his revenge, an' I'll have
mine. Write down," he added, wiping the damp from his
brow, and trembling with passion, "write down, Danny
Mann for de murderer of Eily, an' write down Hardress
Cregan for his adviser."
Both the gentlemen started, and gazed on one
another.
"Ye start l" cried the deformed, with a sneer, "an'ye
look at one another as if ye tought it a wondher a gettle-
man should do de likebut dere's de difference. A
gettleman will have a bloody longing, an' he'll hide it

for goold, but he'll keep his own clane gloves and
slender fingers out of it. A poor man does his own work
wid his own hands, and is satisfied to damn his own soul
only. All the difference I see is this, that a gettleman
besides his being a murdereris a desaver an' a
coward."
"If you really mean," said the magistrate, "to im-
peach Mr. Hardress Cregan with this crime, you do not
strengthen your testimony by evincing so much vindic-
tive feeling. His character stands high, and we know
that the highest have often had their steps beset by
serpents, who have no other motive for the sting they
give than private malice, or revenge, such as you avow."
The wily taunt succeeded. The stranger turned on
the magistrate a scowl of indescribable contempt.
"If I could not afford to avow it," he said, "I had wit
enough to hide it. I knew your laws of old. It isn't for
noting that we see de fathers of families, de pride an'
de strength of our villages, de young an' de old, de guilty
an' de innocent, snatched away from dere own cabins, an'
shared off for transportation an' de gallows. It isn't for
noting our brothers, our cousins, an' our friends are
hanged before our doores from year to year. Dey taich

to my own confessions, I knew enough to say little of
what brought me here. A counsellor would tell you,

He suddenly paused, placed both hands upon his eyes,
and shuddered with so much violence, that the floor
trembled beneath him. The listeners maintained their
attitude of deep and motionless attention.
"Yes," he at length continued, letting his hands
descend, and showing a horrid smile upon his lip, "de

paper, to de last gasp, as if she tought it was to rob her
of dat I wanted. Little she mattered her life in the

"It is clear !" said Mr. Warner, starting from his seat.
"Captain, I need make no excuse to you for stirring.
Mr. Houlahan, remain, and see this man confined.
What, Horan bring the horse to the door this instant.
Captain, you will, perhaps, accompany me, as the service
may possibly be dangerous or difficult on such an occa-

(though that will cost some time), and then proceed to
arrest this gentle bridegroom. Horan, quick with the

"With great delicacy, certainly," returned the magis-
trate, "but likewise with a firmness becoming our trust.
Mr. Houlahan, look closely to the prisoner. He left
our vigilance at fault on another occasion. Come, Cap-
tain, here are the horses."
They rode rapidly away; and Mr. Houlahan, slipping
out of the room, locked the door on the outside, and
went to prepare some suitable dungeon upon the pre-
mises for the prisoner.
The unfortunate man remained for several minutes
standing on the floor, his hands clasped and elevated

before him, his ear inclined as if in the act of listening,
and his eye set in stolid, dreamy wonder. The window
opened on a craggy field, and was fortified by several
bars of iron. He did not, however, even cast a glance
at this formidable impediment. Every faculty of his
spirit seemed for the moment to be either absorbed by
one engrossing image, or to be suspended altogether by
a kind of mental syncope.
While he remained thus motionless, and while the
house was quiet and still around him, he suddenly heard
a rough but not unmelodious voice singing the following
verses outside the window :
"But for that false and wicked knave,
Who swore my life away,
I leave him to the Judge of Heaven,
And to the judgment day.
"For gold he made away my life
(What more could Herod do?);
Nor to his country, nor his God,
Nor to his friend proved true."
The verses seemed to be sung by one in the act of
passing the window, and, with the last line, the singer
had proceeded beyond hearing. The verses, though
containing a common ballad sentiment, characteristic of
the peculiar notions of honour and faith held among the
secret societies of the peasantry, seemed as if directed
immediately against the informer himself. At least his
conscience so received it.
He might become one day the subject of such a ballad.
He, too, had his sense of shame and of honour (as all
men have) regulated by the feelings of the class in which
he moved. It would tell nothing against him there that
he had died by the hangman's hands. Every petty
village had its Tell and its Riego, and they had made
that death no more disgraceful in the peasant's eye.
Their names were cherished amongst the noblest re-
collections of his heart, they were sung to his ancient
melodies, and made familiar sounds in the ears of his
children. But to be branded as an informerthat
character, which, combining, as it does, the vices of bad

faith, venality, and meanness, is despised and detested
by the Irish peasantry beyond all social sinsthat was a
prospect which he could not bear so well. And then he
turned to Hardress, and thought of his feelings, of his
old kindness and affection. He made excuses for his
sudden passion, and he thought how those kindnesses
would be dwelt upon in the ballad which was to immor-
talize the guilt and penitence of Hardress and his own
treachery.
He started from his reverie, and gazed around him
like a forest lion in a trap. He rushed to the door, and
gnashed his teeth to find it locked. He drew back to
the other side of the room, and dashed himself against it
with all his force. But it was a magistrate's door, and
it resisted his efforts. He turned to the window, dashed
out the frame, and shivered the glass with his foot, and,
seizing the iron railing with both hands, swung himself
from it, and exerted his utmost strength in endeavouring
to wrench it from its fastening in the solid masonry; but
he might as well have set his shoulder to displace the
centre of gravity itself. Baffled, exhausted, and weeping
with vexation and remorse, he hung back out of the
railing, his face covered with a thick damp, and his
limbs torn and bleeding from the fragments of the
broken glass.
We shall leave him to suffer under all the agonies of
suspense, augmented by the double remorse under which
he now began to labour, and turn our eyes in the direc-
tion of the Castle.

CHAPTER XLIII.
HOW THE BRIDE WAS STARTLED BY AN UNEXPECTED
GUEST.
INVITATIONs, numberless as the sybil's leaves, had been
dispersed throughout the country, on the occasion of the
wedding at Castle Chute. Among the rest the Dalys

THE COLLEEN RAWN. 405
were not forgotten, although certain circumstances in
the history of both families, with which the reader is
already acquainted, made it appear probable that they
would be merely received as things of form. It was,
therefore, with feelings of strong surprise and of secret
confusion (though arising from very different causes), the
bridal pair understood that Kyrle Daly intended to be
amongst the guests.
The popularity of the bride amongst the tenantry on
the estate was manifested by the usual demonstrations of
festive enjoyment. Bonfires were lighted on the road
before the avenue gate, and before every public-house in
the neighbourhood. The little village was illuminated,
and bands of rural music, followed by crowds of merry
idlers, strolled up and down, playing various lively airs,
and often halting to partake of the refreshments which
were free to all who chose to draw upon the hospitality
of the family.
Before sunset the house was crowded with blue coats
and snow-white silks. Several of the guests strayed in
groups upon the demesne, and young gentlemen, fashion-
ably dressed, might be seen hovering around the ladies,
and endeavouring to make havoc of all, by enchanting
those who were near them by their conversation, and
those at a distance by the elegance and grace of their
gesticulations.
Mrs. Cregan was in the drawing-room among the
elder guests, pale, worn, and hollow-eyed, but still pre-
serving the same lofty, courteous, and cordial demeanour
to her friends by which her manner had been always
marked.
The bridegroom, habited in a splendid suit, that seemed
to sit upon his frame as the shirt of Dejanira upon the
shoulders of Hercules, glided like a spectre through the
laughing crowd, the most envied and the most miserable
of all the throng.
A few of the most intimate female connections of the
bride were admitted into the garden where Anne herself,
leaning on the arm of a bridesmaid, was watching the
last sun that was to shine upon her freedom. Her dress
## p. 406 (#410) ############################################
406 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
was a simple robe of white, and her hair, for the last
time dressed in the maiden fashion of the day, hung
loose upon her neck. As she glided to and fro among
the walks, her fair companion endeavoured by every
species of raillery to draw her out of the low-spirited and
anxious mood which had been hourly increasing upon
her since the morning. But, as in a disease of the frame,
an injurious determination to the part afflicted is said to
be occasioned by merely directing the attention towards
it, so in our moments of nervous depression, the jest that
makes us feel it is observed, and serves only to augment
its heaviness.
At a turn in the walk, hedged round by a pear-tree
neatly trained, the lovely friends were suddenly met, and
one of them startled by the appearance of a young man
attired in a wedding costume, and handsome, but with a
pale serenity upon his features that might have qualified
him to sit as a study for Camillus. The lady, who started
at his appearance, was the bride; for in this interesting
person she recognised her old admirer, Mr. Kyrle Daly.
It was the first time they had seen each other since
the day on which their conversation had been attended
with so much pain to both. It would have little served
to confirm the newly-acquired tranquillity of Kyrle Daly
if he had known how often, and with feelings how un-
consciously altered, his conduct had been compared by
Anne with that of Hardress during the last few months.
True, this was a subject of meditation on which she
never willfully suffered her mind to repose for an instant.
It was a forbidden land, on which her wandering thoughts
alone would steal at intervals; but these unlicensed
musings had tended to qualify her old opinions in a
degree more striking than she herself believed. Of all
this Kyrle Daly, of course, knew nor imagined nothing,
and, therefore, was he here. He came secure in the
consciousness of a right intention, and believing that his
own appearance of quiet and cheerfulness of mind would
afford a real satisfaction to his fair, and only poetically
cruel, friend.
He advanced towards the ladies with an easy cor-
## p. 407 (#411) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 407
diality, and that total absence of consciousness in his
own demeanour which was most certain to restore quiet-
ness to Anne, for self-possession is often as contagious
as embarrassment. He addressed her in the tone of an
interested friend, inquired for her health, spoke of her
mother, even of Hardress, whom he said he had not yet
been fortunate enough to meet, then of the weather, of
the scene around them, of the company, of every subject
that was at the same time amusing and indifferent. The
same attentions, and with a tone so studiously similar
that the ear of Petrarch only might have found a differ-
ence, he addressed to Miss Prendergast, the bridesmaid,
who also was an old acquaintance. Finally, he gently
contrived to separate the ladies, and, giving an arm to
each, they continued to tread the garden walks, while he
divided between them the same cheerful conversation on
indifferent subjects. His spirits flowing freely, and sup-
ported by those of the lively bridesmaid, became too
much for Anne's depression, and she became cheerful
almost without perceiving it.
After some time, Miss Prendergast, beckoned by a fair
friend in a neighbouring walk, deserted her companions
for some moments. Both stopped to await her return,
and Kyrle, perceiving the embarrassment of the bride
beginning to return, took this opportunity of entering on
something like an explanatory conversation.
"You see, Miss Chute," he said, with a smile, "you
were a better prophetess than I believed you. If you
were one that could be vain of your influence, I should
not do so wisely, perhaps, in making such an admission,
but you are not. I have not, as you perceive, found it
so difficult a task to master my old remembrances."
The eyes of Anne fell unconsciously upon the worn
cheeks and figure of the speaker. He saw the secret
suspicion which the glance implied, and he reddened
slightly, but he saw likewise that it was involuntary, and
he did not seem to have observed it.
"There are some feelings," he continued, "though
looked upon as harmless, and even amiable in themselves,
which ought to be avoided and repelled with as much

408 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
vigilance as vice itself. I once thought it a harmless
thing to turn my eyes on past times, and deliver myself
up, on a calm evening, to the memory of my younger
hours, of sunny days departed, of faces fled or changed,
of hearts made cold by death, or by the world, that once
beat fervently beside my own; to lean against some aged
tree in the twilight, and close my eyes and ears to the
lonely murmur of the woods around me, and fancy I
heard the whoop of my boyish friends, or the laugh of
my first love along the meadows. But I have learned to
think more vigorously. I was young then, and fond; but
age has taught me wisdom, at least in this respect. I
shun these feelings now, as I would crime. They are
the fancies that make our natures effeminate and weak
that unfit us for our duty to Heaven, and to our fellow-
creatures, and render us in soul what the sensualist is in
frame. I have meditated long enough to know that even
my feelings towards yourself at one time (exalted as they
were by the excellence of the object), were still unworthy,
and deserved to be disappointed. I think, and I fear
not to let you know, that if I were again to become a
suitor, my sentiments should be governed by a higher
feeling of duty, and I could bear the trial of a sudden
repression with greater firmness and a more submissive
spirit."
"You will give me credit, then," said Anne, with
much relief and real pleasure, "for some knowledge of
your character?"
"No, no l it was not in me then," said Kyrle, with a
smile, "or the occasion would have brought it into action.
Hardress could tell you what a mournful evening ;
but wherefore should he trouble you?" he added, sud-
denly interrupting himself. "And apropos of Hardress,
his health appears to suffer, does it not?"
"Daily and hourly."
"And without a cause P"
"The physicians," said Anne, "can find none."
"Ay," returned Kyrle, "it is a distemper that is not
to be found in their nosology. It is the burning of an
honourable mind beneath an undeserved and self-inflicted

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 409
imputation. He knew of mymyregard for his fair
cousin. I forced a confidence upon him, and he feels
this transaction a great deal more acutely than he ought."
Anne started at this disclosure, as if it shed a sudden
light upon her mind. Her eyes sparkled, her face
glowed, and her whole frame seemed agitated by a
solution of her doubts, which appeared so natural, and
which elevated the character of Hardress to that noble
standard at which she always loved to contemplate and
admire it.
"It must be sol" she said, with great animation
"and I have done him wrong. It is like his fine and
delicate nature. He is still, then, what I have always
thought him, fine-minded, sensitive, and generous as
" she suddenly turned, and extending her hand to
Kyrle, said, in an altered tone, "as yourself, my excellent
friend l'"
Kyrle took the hand which was tendered to him, with
as little appearance of emotion as he could command, and
resigned it again almost upon the instant.
At this moment Hardress appeared upon the walk.
His step was troubled and rapid, his eye suspicious and
wandering, his hair neglected, and his whole appearance
that of a person at fearful odds with his own thoughts.
He stopped short as he approached them, and glanced
from one to another with a look of wildness and irreso-
lution.
"I have been looking for you, Anne," he said in a
weak voice; "Mrs. Chute has been wishing to speak with
you about your preparations."
"Do you leave Ireland so soon?" asked Kyrle, with
some interest.
"To-morrow morning we leave home," replied Anne,
trembling and slightly confused.
"Then," said Kyrle, resuming the hand which he had
so hastily resigned, "permit me to offer my good wishes.
Be assured, Anne," he added, accompanying her to a
little distance along the walk, and using a tone which
Hardress could not overhear, "be assured that I am
perectly, perfectly contented with your happiness. Let

me entreat you to forget altogether, as I myself will learn
to do henceforward, that I have ever proposed to myself
any higher or happier destiny. That scheme has fallen
asunder, and left no deeper an impression on my reason
than a love dream might upon my heart. I desire only
to be remembered as one who imagined himself the
warmest of your admirers, but who found out, on a little
examination, that he was only your friend."
Anne remained silent for a moment, deeply penetrated
by the anxiety for her peace of mind, which Kyrle evinced
in all his conduct and his conversation.
"Mr. Daly," she replied at length, and with some
agitation, "it is impossible for me now to say all that I
feel with respect to your consideration of me on every
occasion. I am proud of the friendship that you offer
me, and, if we meet again, I hope you will find me worthy
of it."
She hurried away, and Kyrle, returning on his steps,
resumed his place before the bridegroom. The picture
which was formed by the two figures might have chal-
lenged the united efforts of a Raphael and an Angelo, to
do it justice. Kyrle Daly, standing erect, with arms
folded, his face pale and bright with the serenity of
triumphant virtue; his mouth touched by a smile of
forgiveness and of sympathy; and his eye, clear, open,
and seraphic in its character, presented a subject that
might have pleased the eye of the pupil of Perugino.
Hardress, on the other side, with one hand thrust into.
his bosom, his shoulders gathered and raised, his brow
knitted, rather in shame and pain than in sternness or
anger, his eyes not daring to look higher than the breast
of Kyrle, and his face of the colour of burnt Sienna,
would have furnished a hint for the sterner genius of
Buonarrotti.
"Hardress," said Kyrle, with an air of sudden frank-
ness, "confess the truth that you did not expect me here
to-day."
Hardress looked up surprised, but made no answer.
"I am come," continued Kyrle, "to do justice to you
and to myself. That I have something to complain of
## p. 411 (#415) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 4II:
you will not denythat I have not so much as I
imagined, I am compelled to admit. My resentment,
Hardress, has been excessive and unjustifiable, and with
that admission, I toss it to the winds for ever."
The surprise of Hardress seemed now so great as to
master even his remorse and his anxiety. He looked.
with increasing wonder into the eyes of Daly.
"Knowing as I did," continued the latter, "what
passion was, I should have made more charitable allow-
ances for its influence on another; but all charity forsook
me at that moment, and I thought it reasonable that my
friend should be a cold philosopher where I was a wild
enthusiast. I have not even to reproach you with a want
of confidence, for it now appears, from my unreasonable
expectations, that I could not have deserved it. We are
both, perhaps, to blame. Let that be a point agreed
upon, and let our explanations resolve themselves into
these two wordsforgive, forget."
Saying this, he gave his hand to Hardress, who received
it with a stare of absent wonder and confusion. Some
indistinct and unintelligible murmurs arose to his lips,
and died in the act of utterance.
"I know not," continued Kyrle, "and I shudder to
think how far I might have suffered this odious sentiment
to grow upon me, if it were not for an occasion of melan-
choly importance to us all, which arrested the feeling in
its very bud. I have even sometimes thought, that my
unaccomplished sin might possibly have been the cause
of that " Here he shuddered, and stopped speaking
for some moments.
Before he could resume, the sound of the dinner-bell
broke short the conference. Kyrle, glad of the relief,
hastened to the house, while Hardress remained as if
rooted to the spot, and gazing after him in silence.
When he had disappeared, the bridegroom raised his
eyes to the heavens, where already a few stars twinkled
in the dying twilight, and said within his own mind:
"In that world which lies beyond those points of light,
is it possible that this man and I should ever fill a place
in the same region ?"

CHAPTER XLIV.
HOW MORE GUESTS APPEARED AT THE WEDDING THAN
HAD BEEN INVITED.
LIGHT and laughtermirth and musicplenteous fare
and pleasant hearts to share it, were mingled in the
dining-room on this occasion. Mrs. Chute presided; the
"old familiar faces" of Mr. Cregan, Mr. Creagh, Mr.
Connolly, Dr. Leake, and many others, were scattered
among the guests, and every eye seemed lighted up, to
contribute its portion of gaiety to the domestic jubilee.
A cloud of vapour, thin and transparent as a peri's sighs,
arose from the dishes which adorned the table, and was
dissipated in the air above. The heavy moreen window-
curtains were let down, the servants flew from place to
place like magic, the candles shed a warm and comfort-
able lustre upon the board, and the clatter of plates, the
jingling of glasses and decanters, the discowmfiture of pro-
vision, and the subdued vigour with which all this was
accomplished, considering the respectability of the guests,
was really astonishing. Without any appearance of the
havoc and carnage which is displayed on such occasions
in humbler life, it is a question whether there were not
actually more execution done in a quiet, determined way.
It furnished a new instance of the superior advantages of
discipline.
Towards the close of the feast, the manliness of Kyrle
Daly was put to a cruel test, by one of those unfeeling
jests which are the sport of fools in every country. The
reader may smile at the circumstance as trifling, but it was
not so in its effects upon the heart of the forlorn lover.
A young lady, who was considered a wit among her
country friends, and feared accordingly, put a willow-leaf
upon a slice of cream-cheese, and handed it to Kyrle Daly
with an unconscious face. Some months before, a jest of
## p. 413 (#417) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 413
this kind would have put his temper to its severest trial,
and even now he felt as if he had been stung by a ser-
pent. He did not, however, betray the least emotion,
but took revenge by going near the lady as soon as
circumstances permitted, and making mock-love to her
during the night.
The spirit of the scene produced its effect upon the
mind of Hardress himself, who, yielding to its influence,
adopted a degree of gaiety that surprised and delighted
all who were interested in his fortunes. It is true, that
from time to time, a fear struck at his heart, like the
shock of an alarm, and the glassy eyes of a corpse seemed
at intervals to stare at him from among the crowd. But
he turned his eyes and his thoughts away to happier
objects, and, as if in defiance of the ghastly interruption,
became more gay than before.
Mrs. Cregan did not smile to see her son so far forget
his misery. A feeling of nervous apprehension had lain
upon her spirits throughout the day, and became more
oppressive and insupportable according as the time
approached of Hardress's departure. The more certain
his escape became, the more did her anxiety increase,
lest it should, by some unlucky circumstance, be yet
prevented.
While Hardress, in the full fling and zest of his false
spirits, was in the act of taking wine with a fair friend,
he felt a rustling, as of some person passing by his chair,
and a low voice whispered close to his ear, "Arise, and
fly for your life."
The wine-glass fell, untasted, from his hand, and he
remained a pale and motionless image of terror. There
was some laughing among the company, who perceived
the accident; and many ingenious omens were deduced,
not very favourable to the prospects of the lady. But
the agitation of the bridegroom was attributed to mere
embarrassment.
The cloth soon after was removed; some songs were
sung, and the ladies rose to depart. Hardress, with the
mysterious warning still ringing in his ear, was about to
follow in their train, when a rough grasp was laid upon
## p. 414 (#418) ############################################
4I4 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
his arm, the door was shut with violence, and he beheld
Hepton Connolly standing with his finger raised in an
attitude of menace and reproach. Hardress felt his
heart sink at the thought that this interruption might
cost him his life.
"Let me go, my dear Connolly," he said, in an anxious
voice. "It is of the last importance to me."
"The last importance 1" repeated Connolly, with a
suspicious smile. "I'd consider it a disgrace to me, my
dear Hardress, if you were to go to bed sober after being
in my company to-night, the last that you are to spend in
the country. Come, come, Hardress, don't look fierce;
you will have Miss Chute long enough; but here are a
pleasant set of fellows whom, perhaps, you may never
see round the same table on earth again."
"But, Connolly!"
"But, Hardress "
"What's the matter there?" cried a rough voice from
the head of the table. "Anybody sneaking? Bring
him up here by the collar. If any man leaves this room
sober to-night, I shall make it personal with him."
The speaker (who was no other than the culprit's
father) added an oath, and the room rang with acclama-
tions. Hardress, faint with fear and anxiety, was com-
pelled to return to the table, and the bowl was shortly
circulated with that enthusiasm which was considered
appropriate to the occasion. The wine which he drank,
and the conversation in which he was compelled to
mingle, gradually stole him back into his revel mood,
and in a little time he became more loud and seemingly
mirthful than ever. The voice which he heard might be
ideal as the visions he had seen. He thought no more
of it.
He became engaged in a violent dispute with Creagh
as to whether the cascades of Killarney were the better
or worse for being without basins. Hardress contended
that the want was a defect, inasmuch as it left the be-
holder without that delightful sensation which he might
gather from the cataract of those two most perfect images
of tumult and repose, a roaring cataract, with clouds of
## p. 415 (#419) ############################################
TIE COLLEEN BAWN. 4I5
ioam and mist, and a smooth expanse of water, with its
glancing and streaky light, and its lulling motion, like
the heaving of a sleeping infant's bosom. Creagh, on
the other hand, held (and he defended the idea stoutly,
as he happened to hit on it by accident) that the very
mystery attending the disappearance of the stream, when
the spectator saw it hurry downward by his feet, still
foaming and roaring on, until it was hidden from his
view by the closing thicket below, gave a greater idea to
the mind than could be produced by the contrast which
Hardress admired.
The latter had his hand raised, with a cascade of elo-
quence just bursting from his lips, when a warm breath
came to his ear, and the same low voice murmured in
tone still lower than before: "Arise, I tell you ! the army
is abroad, and your life is in danger."
It could not now be an illusion, for the tresses of the
speaker had touched his cheek, and the dress had brushed
his feet. He dashed his chair aside, and, standing sud-
denly erect, looked round him for the warner. A female
dress just glanced on his eye as he stared on the open
door which led to the hall. He followed it with so
much rapidity no one could find time to interfere; but
the hall was empty of living figures. He only saw the
cloaks and hats of the visitors hanging against the wall,
while the dusky flame of a globe-lamp threw a gloomy
and dispiriting light upon the walls and ceiling. On one
side the floor was shaken by the dancers, and the ear
stunned with the music of the bagpipe, violin, and dulci-
mer; on the other, he heard the bacchanalian uproar of
the party he had left. At a distance, in the kitchen, he
could distinguish the sound of one solitary bagpipe
playing some air of a more rapid and vulgar character;
while the voice of a villager, penetrating in triumph
through a two-foot wall of stone and mortar, was heard
singing some wild and broken melody, which was meant
for mirth, but in which a stranger ear might have
detected a greater depth of pathos and of feeling than
the composer probably intended. Snatching his hat and
coat, and trembling in every joint, Hardress was about
## p. 416 (#420) ############################################
416 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
to hurry down a narrow staircase leading to the yard-
door, when his mother with a bridesmaid met him on
the way.
"Come this way, Hardress," she said, "I have a part.
ner engaged for you."
"Mother," said Hardress, with the horrid sense of
oppression which one feels in a dream of danger and
vain resistance, "take your hand from my arm and let
me pass."
Mrs. Cregan imagined that as, in compliance with an
established superstition, patronised by some of the old
people, the bridegroom was not to sleep in the house on
the night before the bridal, Hardress was thus early pre-
paring to comply with the old custom.
"You must not go so soon," returned Mrs. Cregan.
"Come, Miss Prendergast, make that arm prisoner,
and lead him to the ball-room."
Hardress, with a beating pulse, resigned himself to his
fate, and accompanied the ladies to the dancing-room.
Here he remained for some time endeavouring, but with
a faint spirit, to meet and answer the gaiety of his com-
panions. After dancing a minuet with a good deal of
silent approbation, he led his fair partner to her seat,
and, taking a chair at her side, began to entertain her as
best he could, while other dancers occupied the floor.
His chair was placed a few yards distant from an open
door, at which a crowd of servants and tenants appeared
thrusting in their heads, and staring on the dancers for
the purpose of admiration or of satire, as the occasion
might arise.
One of these, a handsome country lad, had encroached
so far as to get within a foot or two of Hardress's chair,
and to be recognised by him with some appearance of
kindness.
"Master Hardress," he said, stooping to his ear, "did
Syl Carney tell you anything?"
"No 1" said Hardress, turning suddenly round, and
neglecting to finish some observation which he was in
the act of making to his fair companion.
"Why then, never welcome her l'" said the lad. "I
## p. 417 (#421) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 4I 7
told her to slip in a word to you, some way, to let you
know that Danny Mann has given information, and the
army are out this night."
Hardress trembled, as if the hangman's grasp had been
laid upon him.
"What a shocking dance that horn-pipe is 1" exclaimed
the lady. "I am always reminded when I see it of the
dampers of a piano."
"Precisely, indeed," said Hardress, with a smile like
death, "very ridiculous indeed. Tell me how you know of
this?" he said, apart to the boy. "Speak low and quickly."
"From a little hunchback in bridewell at magistrate
Warner's," returned the lad. "He bid me but the
lady is talking to you."
"I beg your pardon," said Hardress, turning quickly
round.
"It was not I," said the fair dancer; "it was Mrs.
Cregan called."
He looked at his mother, and saw her holding to-
wards him a small basket of confectionery and Oranges,
while she glanced towards the ladies. Hardress rose to
perform this piece of gallantry with a sensation of gloomy
resignation, and with a feeling of bitterness towards his
unhappy parent, as if she ought to have known that she
was knotting the cord upon his life.
When it was done, he hurried back to his seat, but the
servants were all gone, and the door was closed. He
stole from the apartment to the hall, once more resumed
his hat, and, ascending the small flight of steps leading
to the chamber so often mentioned, he was once more
upon the point of freedom.
But the grasp of an avenging Providence was laid

countered the bride alone.
"Hardress," said she, "are you leaving us for the
night?"
"I am," he murmured in a faint voice, and passed on.
"Stay, Hardress I" said Anne, laying her hand upon
his arm. "I have something to say, which you should
know immediately." 2 D

This last interruption completed the confusion of the
bridegroom. A sudden faintness fell on his whole
frame, his brain grew dizzy, his senses swam, and he
reeled, like one intoxicated, into a vacant chair.
"Well, Anne," said he, "anythingeverythingmy
life itself, if you think it worth your while to require
it."
"I owe it to my own peace, and even to yours,
Hardress," said Anne, "to tell you that I have dis-
covered all."
"Discovered all !" echoed Hardress, springing to his
feet.
"Yesall. A generous friendgenerous to you and
me alikehas given the whole history of your cause of
suffering, and has left me nothing to regret, but that
Hardress should not have thought it worth his while to
make Anne a partner in his confidence. But that I
have forgotten likewise, and have only now to say that I
regret my own conduct as much as I once was grieved
for yours. I must have added to the pain which
Hark!"
"What do you hear?" cried Hardress, crouching fear-
fully.
"There is a tumult in the drawing-room. Good
Heaven, defend our hearts | What is that noise P"
The door of the room was thrown open, and a female
figure appeared, with hair disordered, and hands out-
spread with an action of warning and avoidance.
"Hardress, my child !"
"Well, mother 1"
"Hardress, my child 1"
"Mother, I am here ! Look on me! Speak to me !
Do not gasp and stare on your son in that horrid way!
Oh, mother, speak, or you will break my heart!"

chamber, which lay immediately adjoining. Before Anne
had made one movement from the attitude of sudden
fear and wonder to which this strange occurrence had
given rise, Mrs. Cregan again appeared in the chamber,
showing in her look and action the same hurried and
disordered energy of mind.
"Go to your room l'" she said, addressing the bride.
"Go quickly to your room; stop not to question me

"Anne Chute Where's Anne?" exclaimed an
anxious voice at the doorway. "Where is the bride?"
"Here, here !" said Mrs. Cregan.
Kyrle Daly rushed into the room, his face paler than
ever, and his eye filled with anxious inquiry.
"Come this way, Anne !" he said, taking her hand,
while his own were trembling with anxiety. "Unhappy
bride! Oh, horrid, fearful night ! Comecome !"
"I will not stir l' exclaimed the bride, with vehe-
mence. "What mean those words and actions? There
is some danger threatens Hardress Tell me if there
is"
"Take her away, good Kyrle."
"He shall not take me hence. Why should he?
Why does he call me an unhappy bride? Why does he
say this night is horrid and fearful? I will not stir 22
"They are coming, force her hence, good Kyrle,"
muttered the expectant mother.
Struggling in his arms, and opposing prayers, threats,
and entreaties to the violence which he employed, Kyrle
Daly bore the affrighted bride away from the apartment.
He remained by her side during the whole evening, often
soothing her anxiety by his ready eloquence, and watching
every movement of her mind and feelings with the tender
yigilance of a near and devoted relative. .
Mrs. Cregan, meanwhile, remained alone in the room,
## p. 420 (#424) ############################################

her ear bent to catch the first sounds of approaching
danger, and her frame made rigid with the intensity of
feeling. Her hands were employed, while in this atti-
tude, in arranging her hair, and removing as far as pos-
sible every appearance of disorder from her dress. At
length, the clatter of muskets and the tramp of many
feet was heard in the little hall. A momentary convul-
sion shook her frame. It passed away, and she rose to
her usual height and her customary stateliness of eye and
gesture.
At the same moment the door opened, and Mr.
Warner, accompanied by Captain Gibson and the mili-
tary party, appeared upon the little staircase. The first
mentioned seemed surprised, and somewhat embarrassed
at the sight of Mrs. Cregan. He murmured something
of his regret at being compelled to do what must be so
painful to her, and was proceeding to recommend that
she should retire, when she cut short the speech.
"Talk not to me, sir," she said, "of your regret or
your reluctance. You have already done your worst to
fix a stigma on our name and a torture in our memories.
For months, for weeks, and days, my son spoke with you,
laughed with you, and walked freely and openly among
you, and then you laid no hand upon his shoulder. You
waited for his wedding-day to raise your lying cry of
murder; you waited to see how many hearts you might
crush together at a blow. You have done the worst of
evil in your power; you have dismayed our guests, scat-
tered terror amid our festival, and made the remembrance
of this night, which should have been a happy one, a
thought of gloom and shame."
"My duty," returned the magistrate, "obliged me to
sacrifice"
"Complete your duty, then," said the mother haugh-
aly, "and do not speak of your personal regrets. If
justice and my son are foes, what place do you fill
between them? You mistake your calling, Mr. Magis-
trate; you have no personal feelings in this transaction.
You are a servant of the law, and, as a servant, act."
Mr. Warner bowed, and directed the soldiers to follow

him into the other room. At this order Mrs. Cregan
turned her face over her shoulder with a ghastly smile.
"That," she said in a tone of calm reproach, "that is
my sleeping-chamber."
"My duty, madam."
"Be it so," said Mrs. Cregan, in a low voice, and
turning away her face with the same painful smile, while
her heart crept and trembled.
The party entered the room.
"I hope," said Captain Gibson, who really began to
think that Mrs. Cregan had a great deal of reason, "I
hope Mrs. Cregan will not blame me for my part in this
transaction."
"I do not blame you," said the mother, with a scorn-
ful smile; "it is your trade."
At this portentous moment, Mr. Cregan, Mr. Con-
nolly, and two or three other gentlemen, came reeling
into the apartment, excessively intoxicated, and retaining
consciousness enough to feel a sense of injury not wholly
understood, and a vague purpose of resistance.
"Dora," said Mr. Cregan, staggering towards her, and
endeavouring to look sober, "what are you doing here?
What's the matter?"
Mrs. Cregan, her whole soul absorbed by the proceed-
ings in the inner room, did not even appear to be con-
scious of his presence.
"Veryvery extraordinary conduct," he said, turning
an unsteady eye upon the captain. "Soldiers, officers,
eh, Connolly?"
"Veryvery extraordinary conduct," echoed Con-
nolly.
"Do they take the house for a barrack?" continued
Cregan. "Captain, withdraw your soldiers."
Captain Gibson, already annoyed by the taunt of Mrs.
Cregan, returned this demand by a stern look.
"Stand by me, Connolly. Your swords, gentlemen
cried Cregan, as he drew his own.
The others imitated his example. Captain Gibson,
without condescending to unsheathe his own weapon,
turned to his men, and, beckoning with his finger, said:-
17,

"Disarm those drunken gentlemen."
His orders were obeyed upon the instant; a few slight
scratches being all that was sustained by the soldiers in
the drunken scuffle that ensued. The gentlemen were
placed, with their hands tied, on chairs at the other side
of the room, and the bundle of rapiers were laid upon the
window-seat.
"Very well, sirvery well," said Mr. Cregan; "I
shall remember this, and so shall my friends. I am a
gentleman, sir, and shall look for the satisfaction of a
gentleman."
"Expect the same from me," said Connolly, swinging
his person round upon the chair.
"And me," said a third.
"And me," echoed a fourth.
"I little expected to meet with such a return as this
for our hospitality," continued Mr. Cregan.
"For shamel for shame, Cregan," said the unhappy
mother; "do not degrade yourself and your friends by
such remonstrances. The hand of an enemy is raised
against us, and let not the unworthy being think that he
can sink us as low in mind as in our fortunes."
Captain Gibson, who took no notice of the gentlemen,
again seemed hurt to the quick, perhaps not wisely, by
this allusion from the lady.
"Mrs. Cregan," he said, "it is one of the most painful
duties of a gentleman in my situation, that he must
sometimes be subjected to such insinuations as those ;
and it is only the peculiar circumstances in which you
are placed that would prevent my forming a very harsh
judgment of any lady who could use them."
"Sir," said Mrs. Cregan, lowering her head with a
smile of the most bitter irony, "your consideration and
your forbearance are extraordinary. All the events of
this night bear witness to it. It must have surely been
with much violence to that fine gentlemanly spirit that
you chose a moment like this for your investigation.
But I see you are impatient, sir, and I will desist, for you
are a soldier, and I am but a female, and it is easy to see
who would have the best of the argument."

"Our friends dispersed, our mirth so quickly changed
to terror, this scene of confusion at our domestic festivity,

of insinuations, appears in all the actions of this night.

A bustle was heard in the inner room, and the wretched
lady, throwing her arms high above her head, uttered a
shriek so loud, so shrill and piercing, that the stoutest
soldier started like a maiden, and the flush of anger on
the officer's cheek was changed to a death-like paleness.
Half-sobered by the fearful sound, the intoxicated father
rose from his chair, and turned a dull eye upon the
room-door, while every figure on the scene expressed, in
various degrees, the same feeling of commiseration and
anxiety.
"The prisoner is here !" cried Warner, hurrying into
the room.
"Is he?" shrieked the distracted and almost delirious
mother. "Dark blood-hound, have you found him? May
the tongue that tells me so be withered from the roots, and
the eye that first detected him be darkened in its socket!"
"Peace, shocking woman," said the magistrate; "your
curses only add to the offence that Heaven has already
suffered."
"What l" cried the unhappy parent, "shall it be for
nothing, then, that you have stung the mother's heart,
and set the mother's brain on fire? I tell you, no My
tongue may hold its peace, but there is not a vein in all
my frame but curses you ! My child ! My child !" she
screamed aloud, on seeing Hardress at the door. She
rushed, as if with the intent of flinging herself upon his
neck, but, checking the impulse as she came near, she
clasped her hands, and, sinking at his feet, exclaimed,
"My child, forgive me!"
"Forgive you, mother " replied her son, in a wretched
voice; "I have destroyed you all !"

"The crime was mine," exclaimed the miserable
parent; "I was the author of your first temptation,
the stumbling-block between you and repentance. You
will think bitterly of me, Hardress, when you are alone."
"Never !" said Hardress, raising her in his arms.
"Still honoured, always well-meaning and affectionate, I
will never think of you but as a mother. My eyes are
open now. For the first time in many weary months, the
first thought of peace is in my heart; and but for you,
and those whom I have made wretched with you, I
would call that thought a thought of joy. Grieve no
more, mother, for my sake. Grieve not, because it is
in vain. The bolt has sped, the victim has been struck,
and earth has not a remedy. Grieve not, because I
would not have it otherwise. A victim was due to
Justice, and she shall no longer be defrauded. I had
rather reckon with her here than in a future world."
"I cannot part with you," murmured his mother,
while her head rested on his shoulder; "do not put
away my hands awhile. It is tearing my very heart
up !"
"Dear mother, let me go," said Hardress, gently dis-
engaging himself; "we shall meet again, I hope. In
the meantime, hear my farewell request, as you have
heard all that I have ever made: waste not your days in
idle retrospection, but pray for me with fervour: be kind
to those whom I have loved, and remember that my
death, at least, was happier than my life."

Cregan, while her memory glanced wildly through the

to his breast, and bursting into tears of shame and peni-

and should not be regarded. Hear me now, in the full

"I doI am listening. Speak, my child; I will re-

voice: "In a secret drawer of my cabinet you will find a

While he spoke, he felt the arms that encircled his neck
grow rigid, and the face that looked up to his was over-
spread with a damp and leaden paleness.

tinued, "and remember Oh, she is growing cold and
weak; remove herremove her quickly, gentlemen "
She was borne out, in a half-ainting condition, and
Hardress, surrendering himself to the hands of the sol-
diers, prepared to depart. Turning round once more
before he left the room, he said aloud:

in the centre. In a few minutes the lighted chambers.

cians, the delirious mother, the drunken father and
his band of brawlers, the bewildered bride, and all the
scattered pomp of the espousal, were lost to the eye of

Some apprehension was entertained lest any injudi-
cious person amongst the peasantry should occasion the
useless loss of lives by attempting a rescue before the
party left the neighbourhood; but no symptoms of such
an intention were manifested by the people. The whole

CHAPTER XLV.
HOW THE STORY ENDED.
It only remains for us to inform the reader, in general
terms, of the subsequent fortunes of the various actors
in this domestic drama. Such is the fate of the his-
torian, regarded only as the chronicler of events or
feelings in which he has no share; his claim to atten-
tion rests only upon these. While they continue to
awaken interest, he may toy and dally as he pleases; he
may deck his style with flowers, indulge his fancy in
description, and even please his vanity with metaphysical
speculation; but when the real matter of the tale is out,
farewell his hobbies Stern and brief must thenceforth,
be the order of his speech, and listlessness or apathy
become the guerdon of his wanderings. He is mortified.
to find that what he mistook for interest was only
patience, and that the attention which he imagined to
be bestowed upon himself was only lavished on the
automata which his fingers exercised.
Stern and brief, then, be the order of our speech
henceforward. Unhappily a portion of our incidents
will fit that manner well. -
The remorse of Hardress led him even to exaggerate
his own share in the transaction on which the foregoing
measures were founded. Nevertheless, when all the cir-
cumstances of the case had been fully considered, the
mercy of the executive power was extended to his life,
and a perpetual exile from his native land was the only
forfeit which he paid to the outraged law. But before
this alteration in his destiny had been announced to
him, Hardress had learned to receive it with great in-
difference. With the austerity of an ancient penitent,
he persisted in refusing to hold personal communication
with any of his friends, his mother only excepted, and

even she was cheated (by a necessary device, for her
health could not have sustained it) of the last parting
interview.
The mitigation of punishment, which was intended to
save his life, had only the effect of sparing him the
ignominy of such a fate. An occurrence which took
place on the day of his departure completed the ruin
which ill-health had long been making in his constitution.
The convict-ship which was to bear him from his home
had cleared out of port, and lay at anchor in that part
of the river which, from its basin-like appearance, has
received the appropriate denomination of the Pool. In
the grey of a summer morning the prisoners, Hardress
amongst the number, left the gaol in King's Island,
where they had been confined, for the purpose of occupy-
ing their places on board. Arrived at the river-side, the
party halted with their guard, while a small boat was let
down from the vessel's stern, and manned for the shore.
It touched the strand, and received its lading of exiles.
It could not hold the entire party, and Hardress, who
felt a sudden and, to him, unaccountable reluctance to
leave his native soil, while it was possible for him yet to
feel its turf beneath his feet, petitioned to be left until
the return of the pinnace.
He looked to the misty hills of Cratloe, to the yet
silent and inactive city, and over the face of the gently
agitated waters. The fresh, cool light of the morning
only partially revealed the scene; but the veil that rested
on the face of nature became more attenuated every
instant, and the arial perspective acquired, by rapid yet
imperceptible degrees, a greater scope and clearness.
'Groups of bathers appeared at various distances on both
sides of the river, some plunging in headlong from the
lofty quays, some playing various antics in the water,
and some floating quietly on the surface of the tide in
the centre of the stream, while others, half-dressed and
shivering at the brink of the sloping strands, put in a
hand or foot to ascertain the temperature of the refresh-
ing element before venturing to fling off their remaining
habiliments and share in the salutary recreation.
## p. 429 (#433) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 429*
In other respects the scene was nearly the same in
appearance as it has been described in the third chapter
of this volume. Nature, always the same calm and pro-
vident benefactress, had preserved her mighty heart un-
changed throughout the interval, and the same joyous
serenity was still visible upon her countenance. The
passions of men may convulse the frame of society; the
duration of human prosperity may be uncertain as that
of human woe; and centuries of ignorance, of poverty,
and of civil strife may suddenly succeed to years of
science, and thrift, and peace; but still the mighty mother
holds her course unchanged. Spring succeeds winter,
and summer spring, and all the harmonies of her system
move on through countless ages with the same unvary-
ing serenity of purpose. The scene of his happy child-
hood evinced no sympathy with the condition of the
altered Hardress.
He turned with an aching heart from the contem-
plation of the landscape, and his eyes encountered a
spectacle more accordant to his present feelings. The
row of houses which lined the quay on which the party
halted, consisted for the most part of coffin-makers'
shops, a gloomy trade, although, to judge by the reckless
faces of the workmen, it would appear that "custom had
made it with them a property of easiness."
Only one of those dismal houses of traffic was open
at this early hour, and the light which burned in the
interior showed that the proprietor was called to the
exercise of his craft at this unseasonable time by some
sudden and pressing call. The profession of the man
was not indicated, as in more wealthy and populous.
cities, by a sculptured lid, or gilded and gaudy hatch-
ments suspended at a window-pane. A pile of the un-
finished shells, formed for all ages from childhood to
maturity, were thrust out at the open window, to attract
the eye of the relatives of the newly dead. The arti-
ficer himself appeared in the interior of his workshop, in
his working-dress, and, plane in hand, was employed
in giving the last touch to an oaken coffin, placed
lengthways on his bench. Its size denoted that the

intended occupant had died in the full maturity of
manhood.
While Hardress watched him plying his melancholy
trade in silence, a horseman rode up to the door, and
dismounted with some awkwardness and difficulty. He
was a small, red-haired man, and Hardress thought that
the face and manner were not altogether new to his
observation. Another horseman followed, and alighted
with more ease and alertness. He was tall and well-
formed, and Hardress shrank aside from his gaze, for
in this person he recognised one of the persons who
appeared against him at his trial. Leaning against one
of the short posts used for the purpose of holding in
the cables of the shipping, and once more turning his
face towards the river, Hardress listened to the conver-
sation which ensued.
"Servant kindly, Mr. Moran," said the smaller man.
"Well, is the coffin ready?"
"What time will it be wanted?" was the reply.
"The car will be here in half-an-hour. Father Edward
bid me to step on before, in dread you wouldn't have it
done. If it wasn't out of regard for him and his, indeed,
I'd rather be spared the jaunt, for I was always a poor
horseman, and I think it jolting enough I'll get between
this and the churchyard."
"And where'll he be buried?"
"At Mungret Church, westwards. His people are all
buried at St. John's ; but he took it as a delight to be
buried at Mungret, because it was there his daughter was
buried before him."
A deep groan escaped the second horseman, as he said
these words.
"No wonder for you to be heart-broken l'exclaimed
the first. "Old and good friends were parted when they
were taken from you. The poor old man! 'twas enough
to convert a Turk to hear him on his deathbed giving his
forgiveness to all the world, and praying for his enemies.
A year since, as you know well, Myles Murphy, Mihil
O'Connor and his daughter were a happy pair; but he
never raised his head from the day she left his floor.
## p. 431 (#435) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 431
Well, well, 'tis thrue for Father Edward what he says,
that this world would be good for nothing, if there was
not another."
At this moment, a soldier touched the arm of
Hardress, and pointed to the pinnace, whose keel just
grated on the gravelled strand. With a rigid and terrified
countenance, Hardress arose, and was about to hurry
down the steps leading from the quay, when his strength
suddenly failed him, and he would have fallen headlong
to the bottom, but for the timely aid of his escort.
When he recovered from the confusion which this
attack occasioned in his brain, he found himself seated
on the deck of the vessel, her canvas wings outspread,
and the shores of his native soil fleeting rapidly away on
either side. He looked, as the ship went on, to the
cottage of the Dalys. Two or three of the children,
in deep mourning, were playing on the lawn; Lowry
Looby was turning the cows into the new-mown meadow,
and Mr. Daly himself, also in deep black, was standing,
cane in hand, upon the steps of the hall-door. The
vessel still swept on, but Hardress dared not turn his
eyes in the direction of Castle Chute. The dawn of
the following morning beheld him tossed upon the waves
of the Atlantic, and looking back to the clifted heads of
the Shannon, that stood like a gigantic portal opening
far behind. The land of his nativity faded rapidly on
his sight; but before the vessel came within sight of
that of his exile, Hardress had rendered up the life that
the law forbore to take l
His mother lived long after, in the practice of the
austere and humiliating works of piety, which her
Church prescribes for the observance of the penitent.
Her manner, in the course of time, became quiet, serene,
and uncomplaining; and though not so generally ad-
mired, she became more and more loved among her
friends and her dependants than in her days of pride and
haughtier influence.
One circumstance may be mentioned, as affording a
striking proof of the deep root which her predominant
failing had taken in her character. After reading the
## p. 432 (#436) ############################################
432 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
paper which Hardress had left in his cabinet, and finding
that it was written under what she conceived a too
humiliating sense of his unworthiness, she refrained from
bestowing it as he desired. It was not until the salutary
change above mentioned had been wrought in her
character, and after the purpose which the document
was intended to accomplish had been brought to pass by
other means, that she complied with her son's parting
wishes.
It was a circumstance which placed the character of
Anne Chute in a noble point of view, that, from the
moment of the fearful discovery recorded in the last
chapter, she never once upbraided her unhappy relative
with the concealment which had so nearly linked her fate
with that of one whose conduct she had so much cause
to view with horror. Much as she had loved Hardress,
and shocked as she was by the terrible occurrences of
that night, she could not look back without the feeling
of one who has escaped a great and hidden danger.
It would have been denying her a virtue which she
ought not to have wanted, if we said that the generosity
und disinterestedness of Kyrle Daly failed eventually to
produce that effect upon her feelings which it had long
since done upon her reason. It was long, indeed, before
this favourable indication could be suffered to appear;
but it did appear, at length, after the remembrance of
this unhappy story had grown faint in the course of time,
and the tumult which it had left in many bosoms had
been stilled by years, by penitence, or death. They were
then united, and they were as happy as earth could
render hearts that looked to higher destinies and a more
lasting rest. They lived long after in the practice of the

the guilty and the neglectful owe their deepest terrors,
and good men their dearest consolations.
The wretched partner in the crime of Hardress died
amid all the agonies of a remorse, which made even those
whose eyes had often looked upon such scenes shrink
back with fear and wonder. He owed his fate to an
erring sense of fidelity, and to the limited and mis-

chievous course of education too common in his class;
while Hardress might be looked on as the victim of his
cherished vanity and pride of self-direction.
These events furnished Lowry Looby with matter for a
great fund of philosophical eloquence, which he was fond
of indulging at even, when his pipe lit freely and the fire
shone bright upon the hearth. This faithful servant lived
long enough to enjoy the honours of a freehold in his
native county of Clare, and to share it with the careful
housewife who was accustomed to provide for his wants
with so much affectionate care at the dairy-cottage. His
name, I understand, was found upon the poll-books at
the late memorable election in that county; but on
which side of the question he bestowed his voice, is
more than my utmost industry has enabled me to ascer-
tain.
Reader, if you have shuddered at the excesses into
which he plunged, examine your own heart, and see if it
hide nothing of the intellectual pride and volatile suscep-
tibility of new impressions, which were the ruin of Har-

pages may have afforded, you should learn anything from
such research for the avoidance of evil, or the pursuit of
good, it will not be in vain that we have penned the

The real occurrence which suggested the plot of "THE
CoLLEEN BAwN," though furnishing little more than
the ground-work of that Tale, was in itself little inferior
in interest. The following narrative of it is taken from
the NEw MonTHLY MAGAZINE:
THE river Shannon, in 1ts passage westward towards the Atlantic,
expands, about forty miles below the city of Limerick, into a capa-
cious sheet of water resembling an estuary, and making a distance
of ten or twelve miles from bank to bank. At the northern, or
county of Clare side, is the town of Kilrush. Upon the opposite
shore, adjoining the borders of the counties of Limerick and Kerry,
is the town of Tarbert; and a few miles higher up the stream, the now
inconsiderable village of Glynthe same from which a branch of the
Fitzgeralds originally took their ancient, and still honoured, title of
"Knights of Glyn." None of these places make any kind of show
upon the banks, which, besides, are pretty thickly planted almost
down to the water's edge. The river itself in this part presents few
signs of human intercourse. In the finest summer weather the eye
may often look round and search in vain for a single bark or boat to
break the solitude of the scene. The general desolation is in fact
at times so complete, that were an adept in crime to be in quest of
a place where a deed a violence might be perpetrated under the eye
of God alone he could not select a fitter scene than the channel
of the river Shannon, midway between the points I have just
described.
One morning, a little after sunrise, about the latter end of July, in
the year , two poor fishermen, named Patrick Connell and 
Driscol, who lived at Moneypoint, a small hamlet near Kilrush,
went down to the river-side, according to their custom, to attend to
their occupation. As they walked along the strand in the direction
of their boat, they came upon a human body, which had been washed
ashore by the last tide. It was the remains of a young female, and
had no clothing or covering of any kind, excepting a small bodice.
Who or what she had been they could not conjecture, but how she
came by her death was manifest. They found a rope tied at one end
as tightly as possible round the neck, and at the other presenting a
large loop, to which they supposed that a stone, or some other weight,

had been attached, until the working of the stream caused it to
separate. From the general state of the body, and more particularly
from the teeth having almost all dropped out, they concluded that it
must have been under the water for several weeks. After a short
consultation, the two fishermen resolved upon proceeding without
delay to Kilrush, to apprise the civil authorities of the circumstance;
but in the meantime, they could not bear to think of leaving the
remains exposed, as they had found them, on the shore, and liable
to be borne away again by the tide before they could return. They
accordingly removed the body to a little distance beyond high-water
mark, and gave it a temporary interment.
The magistrates of the neighbourhood having ascertained, from
the report of the fishermen, that a dreadful crime had been com-
mitted, set immediate inquiries on foot for the discovery of the
offender. The exertions of the magistrates in the present instance
were so successful, that a considerable mass of circumstantial
evidence was in readiness for the coroner's jury that was summoned
to inquire into the identity of the deceased and the cause of her
death. The details were voluminous, and I shall, therefore, select
only the most striking and material.
The most important and ample information was communicated
by a young woman named Ellen Walsh. A few weeks before the
finding of the remains, this person being at Kilrush, went down to
the river-side in search of a passage across to Glyn, where she
resided in service with a lady. It was then approaching sunset.
Upon arriving at the shore, she found a small pleasure-boat on the
point of putting off for Tarbert. Six persons were in the boata
Mr. S , a young woman, who was addressed as Mrs. S-,
Stephen Sullivan, Mr. S 's servant, and three boatmen of the
town of Kilrush. There was also on board a trunk belonging to
Mrs. S . The only one of the party of whom Ellen Walsh had
any previous knowledge was Sullivan, whose native place was Glyn;
and upon addressing herself to him for a passage across, she was
permitted to enter the boat. They immediately got under weigh,
expecting to reach Tarbert before dark; but before they had pro-
ceeded any distance on their way across, they discovered that this
was impracticable. In addition to an adverse tide, it came on to
blow so hard against them, that the boat made little or no way, so
that they were kept out upon the water the whole of the night.
Towards morning, a heavy shower of rain fell, but the wind having
moderated, the rowers succeeded in reaching a small place below
Tarbert, called Carrickafoyle. Here the party landed as the day
began to dawn, and taking the trunk along with them, proceeded
to a small public-house in the village, to dry themselves, and obtain
refreshment. After breakfast, the boatmen, who had been hired
for the single occasion of rowing the boat across the river, were
dismissed, and returned towards their homes. The boat, which (it
afterwards appeared) had been purchased a few days before by
Mr. S., remained. Shortly after the departure of the boatmen,
Mr. S- and Sullivan went out (they said to search for change of
## p. 437 (#441) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 437
and
a note), and were absent about an hour, leaving Mrs. S
Ellen Walsh together in the public-house.
And here it was that some particulars observed by the latter,
when subsequently recalled to her recollection and disclosed, became
of vital moment as matters of circumstantial evidence. It has been
already stated, that the body found by the fishermen was without
any covering, save a small bodice, so that no direct evidence of
identity could be established by ascertaining what particular dress
Mrs. S- wore; but, indirectly, a knowledge of this fact (as will
appear in the sequel) became of the first importance. Upon this
subject Ellen Walsh was able to give some minute and accurate
information. She had forgotten the colour of the gown Mrs. S-
wore when they landed at Carrickafoyle; but she well remembered
that she had on a grey cloth mantle, lined with light blue silk, and
with welts of a particular fashion in the skirts. She also wore a
pink-coloured silk handkerchief round her neck, and had on her finger
two gold ringsone plain, the other carved. These Ellen Walsh
had observed and noted before Mr. S and his servant left
the public-house; but, during their absence, Mrs. S- opened the
trunk, and, with the natural vanity of a young female, exhibited for
her admiration several new articles  dress which it contained.
Among other things, there were two trimmed spencersone of
green, the other of yellow silk; two thin muslin frocksone plain,
the other worked; and a green velvet reticule, trimmed with gold
lace.
Upon the return of Mr. S. and Sullivan to the public-house,
the weather having now cleared, they proposed to Mrs. S- to go
on board the boat. Ellen Walsh, understanding that Tarbert was
their destination, desired to accompany them; but Sullivan, taking
her aside, recommended her to remain where she was until the
following morning, adding (and this last observation was in the
hearing of his master), that in the meantime "they would get rid of
that girl" (Mrs. S-), and then return and convey her to Glyn.
This Ellen Walsh declined, and followed the party to the beach,
entreating to be at least put across to the other side of a certain
creek there, which would save her a round of several miles on her
way homewards. At first they would not consent, and put off with-
out her; but seeing her begin to cry, Mr. S and Sullivan, after
a short consultation, put back the boat, and, taking her in, conveyed
her across the creek, and landed her about three miles below the
town of Glyn. They then sailed away in the direction of the
opposite shore, and she proceeded homewards. Early next morn-
ing, Ellen Walsh, having occasion to go out upon some errand, was
surprised to see Sullivan standing at the door of his mother's house
in Glyn. She entered the house, and the first thing she perceived:
was Mrs. S-'s trunk upon the floor. She asked if Mrs. S-
was in Glyn. Sullivan replied "that she was not; that they had
chipped her off with the captain of an American vessel." Two or
three days after, Ellen Walsh saw upon one of Sullivan's sisters a
grey mantle, which she instantly recognised as the one Mrs. S-,

438 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
had worn at Carrickafoyle. There was a woman at Glyn named
Grace Scanlon, with whom Mr. S., when he went there, was in
the habit of lodging. In this person's house Ellen Walsh, some
time after, saw the silk handkerchief, one of the spencers, and the
two muslin frocks, which Mrs. S- had shown her at Carrick-
afoyle. (These, it appeared from other evidence, had been sold to
Grace, Scanlon by Sullivan, who accounted to her for their coming
into his possession, by stating that Mrs. S had run away from
Kilrush with an officer, and Tet her trunk of clothes behind her.)
Finally, about a fortnight after the disappearance of Mrs. S-,
Ellen Walsh, going one evening into Grace Scanlon's house, found
Mr. S- and Sullivan sitting there. The former had on one of
his fingers a gold carved ring, precisely resembling that worn by
Mrs. S . They both were under #. influence of liquor, and
talked much and loud. Among other things, Sullivan asked his
master for some money, and, on being refused, observed emphati-
cally: "Mr. John, you know I have as good a right to that money
as you have."
Such were in substance the most material facts (excepting one
particular hereafter mentioned) that had fallen under Ellen Walsh's
observation; and upon the magistrates being apprised that she had
such evidence to give, she was summoned as a witness upon the
inquest. She accordingly attended, and accompanied the coroner's
jury to the place where the remains had been deposited by the
fishermen. The circumstances she detailed were pregnant with
suspicion against Mr. S.and his servant. A young and defence-
less female had disappeared. Upon the last occasion of her having
been seen, she was in their company, in an open boat, on the river
Shannon. A declaration had been made by the servant, "that she
was to be got rid of." On the very next day her trunk of clothes
is seen in their possession. And soon after a part of the dress she
wore in the boat on the servant's sister, and one of her rings on the
master's finger; add to this the mysterious allusion to the money:
"Mr. John, you know I have as good a right to that money as you
have." A few weeks after, a body is washed ashore, near to the
place where this young woman had last been seenthe body of a
young female, who had manifestly been stript and murdered, and
flung into the river, and exhibiting symptons of decay (according
to the report of the fishermen) that exactly tallied with the time of
her suspected death. But, on the other hand, there were some
circumstances in the case, as detailed by Ellen Walsh, which justi-
fied the magistrates in considering that a jury should pause before
they pronounced her evidence to be conclusive. . Of Sullivan they
had no knowledge; but his master they knew to be a young gentle-
man of some territorial property, of respectable parentage, and nearly
allied by blood with more than one of the noble families of Ireland.
This naturally compelled them to entertain some doubts. Then,
upon the supposition that he and his servant had concerted the
murder of the young woman Ellen Walsh had seen with them, what
could be more clumsy and incautious than their previous and sub-
## p. 439 (#443) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 439
sequent conduct? The inference from her story of the transaction
was, that the time and manner of executing their deadly purpose
was finally determined upon during their absence from the public-
house at Carrickafoyle. Yet the very first thing they do upon their
return is to inform her, without any kind of necessity for the com-
munication, "that they want to get rid of that girl;"a declaration
consistent enough with their subsequent account of her disappear-
ance, but almost incredible, if considered as a gratuitous disclosure
by persons meditating the perpetration of an atrocious crime. They
next permit the same person (as if determined that she should be a
further witness against them) to see them bearing away their victim
to the very scene of execution; and finally they appear the next day
in the town of Glyn, and publicly exhibit themselves and the
evidences of their crime to the very person from whose scrutiny
and observation, upon the supposition of their guilt, they must have
known they had so much to apprehend.
These conflicting views did not escape the attention of the
magistrates who had undertaken the investigation of this affair.
They saw that the case would continue involved in mystery, unless
it could be unequivocaliy made to appear that the young woman
seen by Ellen Walsh and the murdered person were the same. For
this purpose, before they allowed the body to be disinterred for the
inspection of the jury, they used the precaution of reinterrogating
Ellen Walsh as to even the minutest particular she could recall
respecting the personal appearance of Mrs. S- The witness
stated that she was extremely young, not more, she imagined, than
fifteen or sixteen, and that her figure was short and slight. So far
her description corresponded with that of the fishermen, who were
also in attendance; but this would have been too feeble and general
evidence of identity for a court of criminal inquiry to act upon with
safety. The witness further stated, that Mrs. S was remarkably
handsome, and gave the coroner's jury a minute description of her
face; but no comparison of feature could now be availing. In the
remains over which the investigation was holding, every natural
lineament of the countenance must long since have been utterly
effaced by death, and by the equally disfiguring operation of the
element to which she had been exposed. At length, however, the
witness distinctly recalled to her recollection one peculiarity about
Mrs. S-'s face, which, if she and the deceased were the same,
might still be visible. The teeth were not perfectly regular. Two
of the upper row (one at each side) projected considerably. This
important clue having been obtained, the remains were disinterred,
and found in the condition which the fishermen had described. The
mouth was of course the first and chief object of minute inspection.
The teeth of the upper jaw had all dropped out; but, upon a care-
ful examination of the sockets, two of the side ones were found to
be of such a particular formation as satisfied the jury that the teeth
belonging to them must, of necessity, have projected as the witness
had represented. Upon this fact, coupled with the other par-
ticulars of her testimony, they returned a verdict, finding that the

deceased had been wilfully murdered by John S and Stephen
Sullivan.
Warrants were immediately issued for the apprehension of the
parties accused, neither of whom (and this was not an immaterial
circumstance) had been seen in public since the finding of the
remains on the shore. The servant succeeded in concealing himself.
The master was traced to a particular farm-house in the county of
Limerick, and followed thither by the officers of justice, accompanied
by a party of dragoons. They searched the place ineffectually, and
were retiring, as from a fruitless pursuit, when one of the dragoons,
as he was riding away, stuck his sabre, more in sport than otherwise,
into a heap of straw that lay near the house. The sword met with
no resistance, and the dragoon had already passed on, when a figure
from beneath the straw, and called out for mercy. It was
T. -
From some passages in the statement of Ellen Walsh, it was
sufficiently obvious, that the deceased could not have been the wife
of Mr. S , and who she had been remained to be discovered.
Before the lapse of many days this point was ascertained. There
was an humble man, named John Conroy, who had followed the
trade of a shoe-maker in one of the small towns in the county of
Limerick. This person had humanely protected an orphan niece
(named Ellen Hanlon), and brought her up from her infancy in his
own house as one of his own children, till she attained her sixteenth
year. He was in the habit of visiting Cork annually to purchase
articles in the way of his trade, and a few weeks previous to the
circumstances above detailed, was about to proceed there, when the
young creature he had loved and protected as his own child, dis-
appeared from his home. He made inquiry for her in every direction,
but never heard of her after, until on reading the description of the
person of the young woman found on the shore of the Shannon,
near Moneypoint, he knew her to be his lost niece.
The trial came on at the ensuing assizes for the county of Limerick.
A clear case of circumstantial evidence, consisting mainly of the
foregoing facts, was made out against the prisoner, who had nothing
save the ingenuity of his counsel to offer in his defence. When the
issue was handed up to the jury, it was supposed that they would
return a verdict of conviction without leaving the box; but, contrary
to expectation, they retired, and continued long engaged in con-
sultation.
At length, late in the evening, a verdict of guilty was found.
Sentence of death was pronounced, and the prisoner ordered for
execution on the next day but one succeeding his conviction. Some
very unusual incidents followed. Before the judge left the bench, he
received an application sanctioned by some names of consideration
in the county, and praying that he would transmit to the Viceroy a
memorial in the prisoner's favour. The judge, feeling the case to be
pne where the law should sternly take its course, refused to interfere:
He was then solicited to permit the sentence to be at least respited
to such a time as would enable those interested in the prisoner's
## p. 441 (#445) ############################################
THE COLLEEN BAWN. 441
behalf to ascertain the result of such an application from themselves.
To this request the same answer was, for the same reason, returned.
There being, however, still time, if expedition were used, to make ,
the experiment, a memorial, the precise terms of which did not
publicly transpire, was that evening despatched by a special messenger
to the seat of government.
The hour beyond which the law had said that this guilty young
man should not be permitted to exist, was now at hand, and the
special messenger had not returned. Yet, so confident were the
prisoner's friends that tidings of mercy were on their way, that the
sheriff humanely consented to connive at every possible procras-
tination of the dreadful ceremony. He had already lived for more
than two hours beyond his appointed time, when an answer from
the Castle of Dublin arrived. Its purport was, to bid him prepare
for instant death. I have heard from a gentleman who visited his
cell a few minutes after this final intimation, that his composure
was astonishing. His sole anxiety seemed to be, to show that he
could die with firmness. An empty phial was lying in the cell.
"You have been taking laudanum, I perceive, sir," said the gentle-
man. "I have," he replied, "but not with the object that you
suspect. The dose was not strong enough for thatI merely took
as much as would steady my nerves." He asserted his innocence of
all participation in the murder of Ellen Hanlon, and declared that if
ever Sullivan should be brought to trial, the injustice of the present
sentence would appear.
The friends of the prisoner were, for many and obvious reasons,
desirous that he should be conveyed in a close carriage to the place
of execution. Expecting a reprieve, they had neglected to provide
one, and they now found it impossible to hire such a conveyance.
Large sums were offered at the different places where chaises and
horses were to be let; but the popular prejudice prevailed. At last
an old carriage was found exposed for sale, and purchased. Horses
were still to be provided, when two turf-carts, belonging to tenants
of the prisoner, appeared moving in the town. The horses were
taken from the carts, and harnessed to the carriage. To this the
owners made no resistance; but no threats nor entreaties could induce
either of them to undertake the office of driver. After a further
delay, occasioned by this difficulty, a needy wretch among the by-
standers was tempted, by the offer of a guinea, to take the reins,
and brave the ridicule of the mob. The prisoner, accompanied by
the gaoler and clergyman, was put into the carriage, and the pro-
cession began to advance. At the distance of a few hundred yards
from the gaol, a bridge was to be passed. The horses, which had
shown no signs of restiveness before, no sooner reached the foot of
the bridge than they came to a full stop. Beating, coaxing, cursing,
all were unavailing; not an inch beyond that spot could they be
made to advance. The contest between them and the driver ter-
minated in one of the horses deliberately lying down, amidst the
cheers of the mob. To their excited apprehensions, this act of the
animal had a superstitious import. It evinced a preternatural ab-

442 THE COLLEEN BAWN.
horrence of the crime of murder, a miraculous instinct in detecting
guilt, which a jury of Irish gentlemen had taken hours to pronounce
upon. Every effort to get the carriage forward having failed, the
prisoner was removed from it, and conducted on foot to the place of
execution. It was a solemn and melancholy sight as he slowly moved
along the main street of a crowded city, environed by military, un-
pitied by the populace, and gazed at with shuddering curiosity from
every window. For a while the operation of the laudanum he had
drunk was manifest. There was a drowsy stupor in his eye as he
cast it insensibly around him. Instead of moving continuously
forward, every step he made in advance seemed a distinct and
laborious effort. Without the assistance of the gaoler and clergy-
man, who supported him between them, he must, to all appearance,
have dropped on the pavement. These effects, however, gradually
subsided, and before he arrived at the place of execution, his frame
had resumed its wonted firmness.
At the place of execution, the prisoner was solemnly adjured by
the clergyman in attendance to admit the justice of his sentence; he
as solemnly re-asserted his innocence. The cap was drawn over his
eyes, and he was about to be thrown off. An accidental interruption
occurred. The clergyman raised the cap, and once more appealed
to him as a person upon whom the world had already closed. The
answer was: "I am suffering for a crime in which I never parti-
cipated. If Sullivan is ever found, my innocence will appear."
Sullivan was found before the next assizes, when he was tried and
convicted upon the same evidence adduced against his master.
Sullivan was a Catholic, and after his conviction made a voluntary
and full confession. It put the master's guilt beyond all question.
The wretched girl, according to his statement, had insisted upon
retaining in her own hands a portion of some money which it
appeared she had taken from her uncle when she deserted him.
To obtain this, and also to disembarrass himself of an incumbrance,
her seducer planned her death. Sullivan undertook to be the ex-
ecutioner. After setting Ellen Walsh on shore, they returned to an
unfrequented point near Carrickafoyle, where the instruments of
murdera musket and a ropelay concealed. With these and the
unsuspecting victim, Sullivan put out in the boat. The master
remained upon the strand. After the interval of an hour the boat
returned, bearing back Ellen Hanlon unharmed. "I thought I had
made up my mind," said the ruffian, in his penitential declaration;
"I was just liting the musket to dash her brains out; but when I
Hooked in her innocent face, I had not the heart to do it." This
excuse made no impression upon the merciless master. Sullivan
was plied with liquor, and again despatched upon the murderous
mission; the musket was once more raised, andthe rest has been
told. -
THE END.
