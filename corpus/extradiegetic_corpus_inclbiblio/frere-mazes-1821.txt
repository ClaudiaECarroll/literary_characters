CHAPTER L 
AN INVITATION. 
THE season for fashionable amusements 
in the Metropolis had expired. In every 
direction were hurrying from the plodding 
haunts of trade, honorables, right honora- 
bles, baronets and commoners, either to 
continue the same round of dissipation at 
watering places, or to recruit their health 
and finances by a few months' residence at 
their respective seats, that they might open 
the next winter campaign with greater 
probability of success.

The Earl of Piercefield had been emi- 
nently successful in most of his gambling" 
ventures. He had well matched his race 
horses at New Market, well matched his 
own skill at Brookes, and pitched upon the 
right man in both his boxing matches; so 
that from these sources of emolument he 
had gained a sum little short of 40,000, 
nearly amounting to the whole rental of his 
numerous estates. 
On the borders of North Wales, in the 
county of Salop, his lordship possessed a 
splendid mansion, surrounded by an exten- 
sive demesne. Thither he invited a nume- 
rous and select party to spend a few weeks, 
and to enjoy the diversion of grouse shoot- 
ing on the lofty and dreary hills of the 
principality. Whether the invitation arose 
from the noble earl's good-natured disposi- 
tion, or whether his pride was merely

desirous of commemorating his success, in 
the presence of those at whose cost it had 
been obtained, the 'historian is unable to 
decide. However, as the invitation pro- 
mised pleasure and was considered an 
honor, it was warmly accepted and faith- 
fully attended to. 
In consequence, on the first of August 
1810, Piercefield Castle, however spacious, 
could hardly contain the concourse of 
youthful noblemen and commoners with 
their menials that obtained admittance. 
The genius of the place might at first 
assume that the feudal times, at their 
proudest aera, were returned. But the lists 
of folly are now-a-days open to pursuits 
so widely different, that the mistake could 
be but momentary. The baronial hail, 
still adorned with the mail c'ad portraits of 
the noble lord's progenitors, now, in the

dead of night, only resounded with the 
rattle of the dice box, and in each recess a 
partie quaree was silently plotting, not the 
downfall of the reigning" monarch, but more 
loyally intent upon winning the odd trick; 
contending, not for the honors of the state, 
but for the four honors. A sight suffi- 
ciently provoking to make each full-length 
portraiture start from his frame, indignant 
at the degradation ; but, in these degenerate 
days, symptoms of shame from a painted 
canvas cannot be more reasonably expected, 
than commiseration for his creditors in the 
breast of a losing gambler. 
The countess dowager, mother of the 
present earl, (who was still a bachelor) and 
her two unmarried daughters, with their 
train of maidens, had sufficient employ- 
ment in attending to the accommodation of 
the guests ; and they succeeded : for the

festivities of Piercefleld Castle were con- 
ducted in a manner becoming* the hospital- 
ity of the noble owner, and his urbanity was 
highly gratifying to the feelings of his noble 
friends,  so, at least, the newspapers of the 
day phrased it for the information of the 
titled idlers not present. But, in plain 
truth, from morn till sun set, as there was 
very little to be done, save the business of 
the toilet and table with a few matches at 
billiards, time hung "confoundedly" heavy 
on their hands. Small talk with the ladies 
was found too fatiguing to be long endured. 
However sweetly Lady Clementina sang, 
however delightfully Lady Olivia played, 
as music hath no charms to sooth the 
gamester's breast, from the music room, as 
soon as  nay, oft sooner than politeness 
would allow, they instinctively strolled to 
the dog-kennel and thence to the stables.

But alas, the shooting season was not yet 
begun, and riding and driving about the 
grounds, after a few days, was pronounced 
quite " a bore." Even wine had lost its 
stimulus: their spirits flagged as with 
more noise than g]ee they joined in the 
chorus of any bacchanalian song, and each 
in his heart, cursing the dulness of the place, 
condemned it as unfit for a gentleman to 
reside in. If any of the party happened to 
wonder what o'clock it was, every one glad 
to have something to do, would, as if by 
word of command, grasp the chain, and, in 
an instant, twenty watches were released 
from their fobs. However this act once 
or twice proved the father of some sport, to 
all but the losers at least ; as betts were laid 
on disagreeing time-pieces, reference being 
made to, and decided by, the sun-dial in 
front of the house. Yet, notwithstanding

this resource and other relieving incidents, 
the last ray of the setting sun was watched 
with as much anxiety and hailed with as 
much fervor, as was the first dawn of its 
orient beams by the aucient Peruvians, 
worshippers of that planet during the 
reign of their Incas. However, the gentle- 
men found their spirits invariably revive 
with the exclusion of lingering day-light, 
and the admission of candles on the green 
cloth. Tbey, then, immediately entered 
upon the business of the night.

A PROPOSAL. 
" Confound you, Domviiie, said hi* 
neighbour to him, as the party was still at 
their wine, endeavouring- to shake off his 
own dulness, by arousing a peaceful friend 
from his. \\ You have neither sung* nor 
drank come, let me fill for you. You are 
just a glass too low." 
" If I am dull," replied Domviiie, check- 
ing the hand that was pouring him out a 
bumper. M If we all are dull, the fault 
must be chiefly ascribed to our hospitable 
entertainer."

This unexpected declaration drew the 
stare of the company, first on the speaker, 
next on the noble earl at the head of the 
table, to see in what manner the latter 
would resent this seemingly implied censure. 
But before his lordship had fixed upon his 
mode and manner of reprisal, Domville 
went on. 
M My friend here ascribes my revery to 
dullness ; yet I can, with truth, assure trim 
that the train of thoughts I was pursuing*, 
afforded me the greatest satisfaction I have 
had this day. And gentlemen, added he, 
turning to all present, as they concern you 
as well as myself, allow me to unfold them 
to you." 
Their curiosity being somewhat excited, 
they listened with the more attention, as 
nothing in their conception worthier to 
engage it was then going on.

" I did accuse my lord Piercefield of 
being the cause of that ennui, that depres- 
sion of spirits, that seems to benumb every 
faculty of our bodies and minds, and with

polished steel, unrubbed by friction, be-

limbs will be palsied with torpor, and our 
minds with apathy, if we suffer both to 
remain thus inert." 
Here a short silence ensued, which was 
broken, by one of them exclaiming, " what 
the devil will you have us do ?" 
The inquirer, by his stupid stare, bore 
sufficient conviction that his conceptions, 
poor man ! could not help him to a solution, 
were he nailed to his seat till doomsday.

" Nothing easier, resumed Domville, for 
the preventive is within ourselves, and, 
thank God, we have yet the power of using 
it." 
" How, Charles ? would you have us run 
foot races in this hot, broiling, sun ? I, for 
one, am not quite so mad." Unheeding 
this interruption, Charles proceeded.  
" I have devised a plan for our health 
and diversion. It has novelty besides to 
recommend its adoption ; it will make some 
noise in the world, and, if we go through it 
with spirit, we shall obtain considerable 
applause for our resolution and perse- 
verance." 
Diverson, novelty, and applause were 
promises too tempting not to obtain a patient 
hearing, and thus further Domville :  
" 1 propose that the remainder of this 
evening be devoted as a trial, to see what

Here Piercefield interfered.  " Well, 
let Domville have his own way. There is 
no dealing with these queer geniuses other- 
wise. But if he distrusts our game and 
bottom, I can tell him he is mistaken most 
egregiously. For did'n't you, Clavering,

so that when we broke up, on the shutters 
being thrown open, so dazzled were we 
with the glare of day-light, that we could 
hardly see our way down stairs. If you 
want resolution and perseverance, here are 
both for you with a vengeance !" 
" And I my lord, " cried another,'* why 
did I lose that wheel-race against time, and 
some thousands to boot? Why? Not be- 
cause I had not spunk to go through it : 
but because the near horse fell and broke 
his wind, damn his body ; and what is 
more provoking, I was within a hundred 
yards of the running post and full two 
minutes within my time." His concluding 
with a passionate blow on the table, was the 
signal for a third to take up the cudgel." 
" And in that drinking match that is 
still talked of, did 1 not win and pocket the

know what the plague ails me; but I have 
never been my own man since.  Come,

" And did'n't I," vociferated a fourth. 
But here it were impossible to narrate 
every particular feat; for too impatient 
any longer to listen, they, all seized with a 
fit of boasting-, became both the heroes 
and historians of their own tales.

This ebullition having at length sub-

required at their hands. 
It was simply this.

That they would forthwith arm them- 
selves with pikes, not military but agri- 
cultural, and rakes, straightway repair to

distant, and there assist his men in getting- 
in his crop of barley !!!!!!!!

barley crop ?" 
" The principal motive assigned by my 
lord Piercefield, in the invitation he has 
honoured us with, is the opportunity af- 
forded for the diversion of grouse shooting

among' the hills. You all know that this 
diversion, to be enjoyed, requires consider- 
able bodily exertions. What preparations 
have yet been made, in order to cope 
with the hardships we are to encounter.- 
Hardships that cannot be sustained by 
substitutes, but must devolve on ourselves. 
Can the extensive, elevated, pathless, 
boggy regions we must explore in search of 
game be mastered by men, who habitu- 
ally divide the twenty-four hours thus. 
In bed ten, lounging three, at table five, at 
cards six. Most assuredly not. Then, 
gentlemen, either give up the undertaking 
at once, or advance to the contest duly 
prepared for the victory." 
This conclusion a la militaire seemed 
to electrify the more vivacious of the party. 
" Faith, there is some reason in this, 
and a great deal too. Suppose we try.

But hang 1 it, can't we put it off to ano-

" My friends, the time for procrastina- 
tion is gone by. In five days hence the 
season commences. We must be ready to 
take the field. Not a moment should be 
lost.  Come, let us, by one heroical effort, 
break asunder the slavish bands of sloth, 
and thus become our own masters. My 
Lord Piercefield, we want but a leader : 
set us the example, and we follow." 
"Mr. Domville, replied his lordship 
with a smile, I should be proud to lead 
where you direct ; but, as I am not in- 
vested with any command, I can only put 
it to the vote."  
To the vote  to the vote  was echoed 
around.

sistants to Farmer Stubble, let them stand

The whole party rose. 
" Those gentlemen who still prefer 
keeping table, let them resume their seats." 
None offered. 
" Then we are all agreed." 
Agreed, agreed, was the general cry, 
and out of the house they sallied, voci- 
ferating for pikes and forks. Furnished 
with these, they, with the eagerness of 
school-boys just released from discipline, 
hastened to the scene of action.

CHAPTER III. 
AN EXPEDITION. 
W ELL might farmer Stubble be asto- 
nished at the sudden invasion of his field 
by the noisy, disorderly, panting, well- 
dressed crew, now making towards him, 
brandishing their agricultural implements 
with violent gesticulations. All labour im- 
mediately ceased and every eye was fixed 
on the adventurers. The farmer at first 
inferred, from their appearance, that they 
were a hostile force, intent upon giving him 
battle for the possession of his barley ; but,

though he dismissed that apprehension on 
perceiving 1 his landlord at the head of the 
party, so struck was he with wonder and 
anxiety at this singular visitation, that he 
was utterly disabled from doing the honors 
of the field: and, with pitchfork erect, he 
stood stock still on the waggon he was 
then loading*. 
'* Master Slubhle, cried his lordship 
jocosely, I have brought with me a few 
friends, who are desirous of affording you 
some assistance in your labours. I hope 
you will not spare them. I am accused of 
having kept them too well ; on you they 
call to repair the mischief I have com- 
mitted." 
" My lord you and the gentlemen dome 
too much honor ; but I cannot think" 
" Very true, as yon were going to say ; 
but with your permission, since here we
## p. 23 (#37) ##############################################

are, 'here we work.  Come, gentlemen, 
be doing-  Qui inaime, inimile." 
So saying-, the noble earl very gallantly 
struck his pike into a small heap of bar- 
ley, in order to lift the said heap into the 
waggon, and they all followed the example 
of their leader. But alas, the aggregate 
amount of their labour but slowly filled the 
bed of the vehicle. Some, having piked 
more than they could well raise, spent 
themselves in bootless exertions ; others, 
collecting but scanty forks Full, pitched it 
away with such violence that, flying over 
the intended receptacle, it fell scatteringly 
on the other side, over the heads of their 
companions, who were not slow in returning 
the compliment, whilst others,, having suc- 
ceeded in lifting up a heavy load, over- 
balanced themselves, and with their pikes, 
burden and all, tumbled backwards. The

real workmen, in respect to their honors, at 
first stood aloof, hats off, content to become 
spectators of the scene. The oft repeated 
miscarriages of their new allies, at first ex- 
cited their surprise, then produced a smile, 
then knowing winks were exchanged, then 
they grinned, and finally the feats of the 
noble squad brought their risible faculties 
into play. Stubble by this time discovered 
that, though he had received an increase in 
numbers, he had gained no accession of 
strength. He also found to his cost that 
his elevated station, being the post of honor, 
proved, as it should be, the post of danger. 
For the pikes of the more successful, who 
had contrived to throw their mite into the 
waggon, more than once drew blood from 
the honest farmer's legs, who now exhibited 
much alertness in nimbly skipping away 
from the well-meant offering.
## p. 25 (#39) ##############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 2& 
At length, seeing much bustle and little 
work, in his own defence he called on his 
men to direct and assist their lordships. 
With their help, the waggon was soon 
sufficiently filled, and, being replaced by 
an empty one, it drew off the field at- 
tended by the master, who was desirous of 
superintending its unloading upon the rick. 
On his return, he " full surely" relied, 
" good easy man," on an equal quantity 
being ready to take the same direction ; 
but, to his vexation, espied the vehicle in 
statu quo and his whole strength, effective 
as well as nominal, quietly laying under 
arms, awaiting his approach. The fact 
was, that a contention of much importance 
had arisen in bis absence among the gen- 
tlemen, which contention, as it was usual 
with them, merged into a wager. 
To beguile the time till sufficient means

could be obtained for its decision, they, in 
imitation, we will suppose, of Homeric and 
Virc/ilian games, during a suspension of 
hostilities, amused themselves, some in 
tumbling the raking lasses upon the bar- 
ley-cocks, others in exhibiting their agi- 
lity in leaping over them; these were 
hard at hop, skip and jump, and others 
contended who could fling their rakes 
and pitchforks to the greatest distance ; 
whilst a few were spouting to the star- 
ing rustics whatever classic lore they 
still retained from their university edu- 
cation. 
But sure my lord Piercefield was more 
decorously employed.  Not he; he was 
as mad as the rest. And Mr. Dom- 
ville ? Not a whit wiser.  But here I 
beg leave to recal that expression. 
Then they were all wise, or, at least,

wisely employed. For I define wisdom 
enjoyment of any kind, taken without 
injury to one's self and without detri- 
ment to others. 
From those sports, however, they de- 
sisted as the farmer and his team re- 
turned into the field. Stubble was 
about to rebuke his men for the loss 
of that time, of which he 9 at least, well 
knew the value. But the earl gener- 
ously interposed, took the whole blame 
on himself, and concluded by request- 
ing the loan of both waggons and team, 
merely to decide a trifling wager of half 
a thousand pounds sterling. 
Such deference the laborious classes 
of society pay to those whom they 
falsely call their betters, that honest

position somewhat gruff, answered with 
complacent alacrity. 
" Yes, sure, My lord, and welcome." 
Equally accommodating 1 , I believe, he 
would have proved, had he not been at 
that time in treaty for a renewal of the 
lease. 
Immediately an equal number of 
horses were harnessed to each vehicle, 
manned by an equal number of rakers, 
fillers and loaders (I mean those of gen- 
tle blood). A gold stop watch was 
placed in the hands of master Stub- 
ble, with an injunction to hoist signal 
at the expiration of thirty minutes; and 
to work both sides fell, with as much 
fury, as if their very existence depended 
upon the issue of the contest. Though 
several ancles were sprained, though

their toes were oft alarmingly threatened 
by the carriage wheels, though there 
happened a few tumbles from the wag- 
gons, and though the tumblers bled in 
the same manner as farmer Stubble 
had done, no serious accident oc- 
curred. 
The time being expired, Stubble was 
desired to ascend each wasfgfon and to 
declare, after a close inspection, which 
contained a greater portion of the crop, 
and which was loaded in the more hus- 
band-like manner. 
The farmer gravely complied, whilst 
they stood around the teams in breath- 
less expectation : minutely examined each, 
too cautious to decide hastil , aware 
that the fate of five hundred pounds 
hung on his lips; perambulated wiihin 
the extent of each waggon, felt with his

feet, looked about hi in, stroked his chin, 
smoothed his hair, hemmed and hawed, 
and pondered, at length pronounced him- 
self unable to determine which deserved 
the preference, at the same time declared 
the work preliy well done on both sides, 
all things considering. 
The decision was received with loud 
cheers from each party. The shouts, 
however, imparted rather defiance to 
their opponents than satisfaction at the 
verdict. 
This vociferation having subsided, Stub- 
ble thought it high time to attend to 
his own concerns. He cooly ordered the 
waggons to be drawn along side of 
each other, threw into one the contents 
of both ; and with the addition of a few 
more cocks made up a load, gave it in 
charge to some of his men, and, in order

to prevent farther mischief, politely and 
politically invited the gentlemen to walk 
in and refresh themselves after the fa- 
tigues of the day. Thirsty, panting, 
and wearied, in they went nothing 
loth. 
The good woman and her two buxom 
daughters aware of their approach, for 
they were heard almost as far off as seen, 
were ready to receive them. She did 
the honours of her house with that sort 
of friendly, untaught, courtesy, which, 
to those only accustomed to the glossy 
urbanity of the higher circles, was the 
more gratifying. For the same reason, 
they relished the plain food set before 
them, and glibly down their parched 
throats went each goblet of the farmer's 
home-brewed beverage. I must also re- 
cord for the credit of the gentlemen,

that the blushing damsels were suffered 
to wait on them without molestation, in 
the performance of their hospitable of- 
fice. It is true that a few liberties 
would have been taken, but, as the girls 
were really modest, these were soon re- 
pressed. 
Sol was now fast sinking in the West. 
They arose to depart. Stubble, though 
he made several attempts to detain them, 
was not sorry to see them outside his 
precincts; for, in the busy time of har- 
vest as in the heat of a general engage- 
ment, the place of honour for both farmer 
and commander is in the midst of their 
men. 
Their lordships' spirits were up; in- 
deed most of them somewhat tipsy. Un- 
used to liberal potations of strong malt 
decoction, their heads owned the potency
## p. 33 (#47) ##############################################

of the quantum they had swallowed. In 
consequence they felt themselves in a 
right cue for adventures; though alas 
but few occurred, and those of a very 
trifling cast. 
On their return, a bevy of maidens, 
vulgo wenches, were stepping towards 
them, each carrying a couple of wooden 
bottles. These bottles were on their way 
to the replenishing tap, acting from morn 
till night as conveyancers of the hogs- 
head's contents to the living receptacles,  
Who toil'd and drank, and drank and toil'd, and when 
Their toiling ended, would be drinking still. 
A few gallant or gallant volunteers now 
detached themselves from the van, in 
order to intercept their progress and 
thus cut off the intended supply. But 
so alarmed were the fair opponents at the 
boldness of this attack, that, without wait-

ing* for close quarters, they took flight 
with the velocity of birds, discharging 
however at their pursuers the round mis- 
siles they carried; one of which hit the 
foremost just on his pericranium, and, 
from the concussion, both substances emit- 
ted a hollow sound. The assailant, though 
not a little staggered, still kept in pur- 
suit. But this modern Daphne proved 
herself an over-match for her contem- 
poraneous Apollo, who, finding that the 
longer he ran the further he was from the 
object, at length desisted and regained 
the main body, who diverted with the 
attack and pursuit, now laughed heartily 
at his mischance. 
One of his companions thus gravely 
moralized on this adventure. " To suc- 
ceed with the fair sex, high or low, 
there is but one method, which is pithily

viter in modo, for titer in re. Now, as 
far as the modus, you reversed the maxim 
and, by so doing", lost the chance of prov- 
ing what could be done ad rem. I wish 
to God, Gentlemen, another opportunity 
would occur, merely to afford you a prac- 
tical illustration of my theory. " 
His prayer was heard. At that very 
moment the blithe carol of a milk-maid 
saluted their ears. She was nimbly trip- 
ping* along towards a stile that led into 
the lane in which they were, steadily car- 
rying on her head a pail, nearly brimful 
of the lacteous juice. 
" Thou art in luck's way," said one. 
" Here is as fair a chance as heart can 
wish. Now Harry  now Harry," cried 
the rest in tones of encouragement. 
"Hush! hush!"  replied Sir Harry

Offham ; " be still, stand at bay and mind 
me." 
By this time, the heedless nymph got 
from the stile into the lane, and, to her 
disquietude, found her path impeded by a 
score of dashing bucks, wild as their pro- 
totypes in the season of love. From out 
of the herd our practical Theorist exhi- 
bited himself, and softly advancing with 
amorous visage, low bowing, gentle de- 
meanour, well counterfeited wooings, and 
" sighing like a furnace," down on his 
knees he dropped before the fair one, 
tenderly exclaiming with clasped hands : 
" My love  my life  my angel  my 
goddess  my Dulcinea I Pity  oh have 
pity on the throbs of thy hapless, help- 
less, heartless, swain ; who  who  who 
loves thee, doats on thee, burns for thee,

and, if thy cruelty so ordain it, dies for 
thee." 
Having sufficiently plied her with the 
Suaviter, he now thought it expedient to 
try the efficacy of his Fortiter. 
" But by Venus (passionately vociferat- 
ing and flinging his arms round her 
waist) I can hold no longer. Thy sweet, 
lovely, beauteous self is the only cooler 
that can quench the blaze of this com- 
bustible frame/' 
During the first part of this address, 
the astonished maid with a sort of hys- 
terical giggle kept fidgeting, now on one 
foot, then on the other; but becoming 
terrified by the sudden vehemence of his 
manner, she attempted to spring from him: 
when, alas, in the struggle caused by her 
detention, the dairy utensil above, reeling to 
and fro, at length lost its equipoise, and

receiving" an additional tilt from the very 
hand that even in her trepidation was 
dispatched to its assistance, it up-set and 
in its descent fairly capped the love-burnt 
swain, proving with the help of its con- 
tents an instantaneous extinguisher of his 
flame. 
The nymph, thus released, lost no time 
in seeking" her safety in flight, screaming 
as she sped in woeful accents for the loss 
of her milk, and in terror for the conse- 
quence to herself from m e Stubble. 
She was out of sight in an instant.  Not 
so her pail-crowned gallant. 
From his genuflections up he started 
in darkness, and, with arms outstretched, 
he spun several times round, till in a fit 
of rage he struck the pail from off his 
bead, jumping about with antic gesticu-

liquid, the excess whereof, streaming 
down every way from top to toe, tracked

was his first exclamation amidst the 
shouts of all present; but soon ashamed 
of his disaster, aware of the ridiculous 
figure he cut, enraged at the merriment 
he excited, and feeling no predeliction for 
the comforts of his shower -bath, he ab- 
ruptly left his scoffers, with intent of pur- 
suing* his way alone ; but being over- 
taken, he was with much entreaty per- 
suaded to return in their company, on 
the suggestion that his woeful pickle 
would be better concealed in the midst

of the rest, whose apparel, more or less 
discomposed, tended to keep his own in 
countenance. 
As they approached the house, my 
Lord Piercefield intent on another species 
of frolic, had the malice to introduce the 
whole party plump into the tea-room, 
wherein my lady dowager and her two 
daughters with some female visitors of 
distinction were sitting, wondering at 
the abrupt departure and long absence of 
the gentlemen. 
Their wonder arose to astonishment 
when in they all stumbled in wild dis- 
array. Hats awry and crushed, hair dis- 
ordered, cravats loose, frills out of plait, 
breasts bare, coats torn, hose falling, 
shoes soiled, legs bleeding, hearts panting, 
and flushed faces, appeared still more 
strikingly incongruous in the presence of

the rich, elegant, well-regulated, dresses 
of the stately, dignified, fair beholders. 
A sensation of awkwardness kept the 
gentlemen stationary in the centre of the 
apartment, looking disconcerted at each 
other; bnt this sensation was rapidly sub- 
siding, when some, on casting their eyes 
on the rueful aspect of Sir Henry, their 
pointing at the object created a tittering, 
this tittering soon rose to an ill con- 
strained laughter, which exploded in 
bursts of merriment : the infection became 
irresistible; and a general chorus of laugh- 
ter, in which the baronet himself joined, 
set them all at their ease. These con- 
tinued peals were the longer kept up, as 
they attempted to narrate to the ladies 
the cause and effects of their long ab- 
sence ; exhibiting in triumph for the

greater credibility of the tale, the wooden 
bottles and milk pail they had carried 
home, in exchange, I suppose, for the 
pikes and rakes left behind. 
At length they withdrew to qualify 
themselves by a change of dress for seats 
at the tea-table. As they successively re- 
entered the apartment, the assumed gravity 
of every in-comer was soon compelled 
to give way to the laughter which his 
presence excited. Indeed, though some 
complained of fatigue, some of concus- 
sions, some of contusions, some of lacera- 
tions, and some still felt the prickly beards 
of barley grating their skin, they kept it 
up till late in the night before cards 
were mentioned. Even then the proposal 
met with so faint a reception, that only 
one table could be formed. The play

proved so languid, the fits of yawning so 
frequent, that the party soon broke up ; 
and, following' the example of the re- 
mainder, they retired to their places of 
repose, now not nominally but really so ; 
no longer restless on their downy pillows 
in feverish repinings at their losses,or at the 
small quantum of their gains ; they, like 
the toiling labourers whose vocation they 
had assumed, in sound sleep closed at 
once their eye-lids, in which state the 
morning- far advanced found them ; so 
did their servants, who came to inform 
them that Mr. Domville was waiting 
for their appearance in the drawing 
room.

The omitted passage is this :

in this our arduous trial ? Are we fit to be

(( As to behaviour, I shall reply in 
the words of farmer Stubble, pretty well,

' This won't do; come, no equivoca-

gravity of tone and manner, " to those

pointed hour, and gave directions to 
their servants to be called up accord- 
ingly.

ville, was or is the son of the late viscount 
of that name by a second marriage. His 
lordship's first lady brought him that 
which all the world covets : a consider- 
able influx of wealth with noble and 
powerful connexions. Mr. Domville's 
mother by no means ranked so high, she 
Mas only an actress; nor did she long 
move in the splendid circle traced by this 
dignifing alliance. She died a few years 
after the birth of her son. Her early 
dissolution failed, however, to assuage 
the displeasure of her husband's titled 
relations occasioned by so ignoble a con- 
nexion. Whatever they had to bestow 
was conferred on the eldest son to the 
utter exclusion of Charles. The former 
in consequence became at the demise of 
his father, who died intestate, the 
"wealthiest and most powerful adherent

to the then ministry. Indeed, so grateful 
were they for his endeavours to strengthen 
the hands of his majesty's government^ 
that they exalted his peerage to an earl- 
dom. This young nobleman was haughty 
and obstinate, and when afterwards con- 
tending with his equals for pre-eminence, 
his own selfishness made him cunning, 
acute and active. 
In the son of the actress, a fanciful 
assertor of the influence of breed might 
trace the cross of plebeian admixture with 
patrician blood. In his character were 
blended qualities nearly opposite. Proud, 
yet condescending, resentful, yet forgiv- 
ing, fastidious, but not contemptuous, rest- 
less, yet fond of ease, careless, yet not in- 
considerate, dissipated, yet thoughtful.

dress and amusements, then a sloven and

a recluse. In town be sighed after the 
sweets of retirement, in the country longed

ardent imagination allowed but a scanty 
scope for tbe operations of judgment.

placency, " I always make it a rule to

No wonder then that the horse at times 
ran away with the rider, instead of the rider 
directing his horse. He did not fully enjoy 
the pleasures that fell in his way, because 
he knew that better were to be had ;

tion, because he felt conscious that he had 
neglected the means of improving- it. 
He might boast of a mind excursive, even 
vigorous, yet too often unsteady and un- 
persevering. He was one of those whom

delight but not overpower. Of a palace, 
he would remark that it could have been 
more stately, of a mountain, that a higher 
might be found. Against real misfortunes 
he bore up manfully ; but would childishly 
fret at petty vexations. He had a real 
taste for the three sister arts but excelled 
in neither. Yet, though not quite a Lord 
By on in poetry, the short-winded effu- 
sions of his muse obtained currency among 
the fashionable amateurs. Nay, in his 
attempt at an epic poem, he had got as 
far as the invocation, had finished one 
scene of a tragedy, courted the comic 
muse even to the conclusion of one act, and 
actually completed one farce in two. In 
this as in other pursuits, his attempts 
were too desultory or too multifarious to 
be successful. Thus he failed to gratify 
his desire of distinction, an ambition most 
young men of genius ieei, because his

indolence or impatience precluded the 
requisite perseverance. In more figura- 
tive language, that fortress of which, in 
all probability, he would have become 
master in the course of a regular siege, 
he was compelled to retire from, having 
exhausted his strength in fruitless attempts 
at storming it. He had nevertheless ac- 
quired a sort of ascendency over his youth- 
ful equals, from the consciousness of su- 
periority that gave him a tone of deci- 
sion :  it fixed the wavering and awed 
the timid. He was, upon the whole, one 
of those numerous characters, whom the 
smiles of fortune deteriorate and the frowns 
of adversity improve. 
In the qualities of the heart, it cer- 
tainly could not be said of him as Sallust 
observes of Cato : 
" Esse quam videri."

But he might, with truth, apply to 
himself the well known line of Terence: 
a Homo sum : liumani nihil a me alienum puto." 
That his pride did not divest him of 
humanity the following anecdote will shew. 
Having successfully contended with a 
Duke in embrio for the honour or com- 
fort of a back-seat, he afterwards had the 
carriage stopped, in order to cover the 
postillion's jacket with his own great coat 
from the pelting of a cold, merciless, 
-winter storm* He got laughed at for 
his pains by the unfeeling, warmly clad, 
companions of his journey, and more 
than repaid by a thankful stooping of 
the head, even to the horse's mane, 
from the lad, as he, alighting, left the 
vehicle.

many and excellent were the plans h 
Jaid~dowji for the regulation of his con- 
duct : though but little wisdom was yet 
apparent in his intercourse with the 
world. This the following incident will 
illustrate.  
A duel between two great political 
leadeis, was at that time the prevailing 
topic of conversation. Domville was loud 
in his censures of both. 
" It is a shameful weakness," cried he' 
" in men who are acknowledged and 
act as Leaders, to be led by an absurd 
custom, begotten in the dark ages. Cou- 
rage indeed ! It is downright pusillanimity. 
Believe me, Sir, it requires much greater 
courage to decline a challenge than to ac- 
cept it. And were the case mine, I trust 
I should shew a fortitude, unaffected by 
the clamour of the unreflecting, servile

herd, blind imitators of the follies of our 
gothic ancestors.' 1 
These observations drew upon him ia 
satirical remark ; Domville's reply was 
to the full as keen ; his opponent tartly 
replied, he angrily retorted : the alterca- 
tion grew warmer and warmer, and soon 
became a downright quarrel. A chal- 
lenge given and accepted was the con- 
sequence; the parties met : and Mr. Dom- 
viJle had a full month's leisure, under swrv 
ifical hands, to reconsider his system of 
ethics, to which sundry weighty improve- 
ments were doubtless added during the 
tedium of his long confinement. Amongst 
others, it is presumed, two maxims were 
not forgotten, namelv

before he had attained the age prescribed 
by law. Two or three fluent speeches, 
more remarkable for a vivacity bordering 
upon brilliancy, than for any acute rea-

mission in all political matters, required 
by the one, could not subsist with the in- 
dependance asserted by the other. An 
open rupture ensued. Through the inter- 
vention of friends, an interview was brought 
about, from which they parted sworn foes. 
Of the censures this incident called forth, 
Domville, whether more blameable or 
only less considered, bore, by far, the 
the greater share. The young man in- 
dignant turned from those worshippers of 
power, and, now fired with the example 
of Greek and Roman worthies, he longed 
to emulate their deeds:  thus he set 
about it. 
Giving to his private wrongs the im- 
portance of a national grievance, he threw 
himself into the arms of the opposition 
and commenced patriot, to serve his coun- 
try and to spite his brother. " The Gcn-

tlemen opposite" hailed him with as much 
semblance of exultation, as if the defec- 
tion of one individual had broken the 
ministerial phalanx. Chief of all, my 
lord Piercefield, having- the good of his 
country much at heart, received him with 
the most flattering marks of distinction. 
But, alas, we are compelled to admit 
that this display of patriotism was solely 
prompted by an eagerness to mortify 
Domville's brother, to whom the earl bore 
an irreconcileable grudge, because the for- 
mer had defeated him in a late electioneer- 
ing contest. 
Our Hero was in consequence invited to 
the festivities of the castle. Thither he 
repaired, but soon weary of a repetition of 
the same scenes, he already wished him- 
self away. 
One morning, he left his chamber full

four hours before any of his companions 
were stirring, in order to rid himself of 
an acute head-ache brought on by the 
over night's intemperance. Strolling from 
the park into the fields, he came to farmer 
Stubble's barley piece. The laborious 
strength, useful activity, and unaffected 
gaiety of the men at work, forcibly struck 
him as contrasted with the dull, unpro- 
fitable, rounds of pastime in which he 
had so often borne a share. He returned 
to the castle, his mind fraught with fresh 
schemes of improvements^ romantic no- 
tions of setting a glorious example, of 
discarding prejudices, of honoring merit 
for merit's sake : thence, ascending to the 
origin of society, he broached strange 
doctrines of right and wrong. Lord pro-

have been, a crowed trial, materials for

Upon second thoughts, however, I find

each will be conceded : Namely

emphasis, jumping upon a chair, the better 
to be heard and seen, important indeed is 
the subject that

their hands and stamping the boards to 
express their applause. 
Immediately, they lifted up and placed 
upon a table a huge, crimson, velvet, 
chair, in which they fain would have 
seated the intended orator. Whilst he was 
declining the proffered honor, the earl 
re-entered, dragging after him his grand- 
father's robe of state ; an immense flowing 
perriwig of the 17th century was carried 
by a second, whilst a third held a well- 
plumed cocked hat of the same period. 
Our Hero beheld the regalia advancing 
with a satirical smile that threatened retali- 
ation; he very good humouredly ascended 
the table, was soon arrayed in his robe and 
seated on his throne. Sir Henry Oifham,

" What have you done for yourselves ?

" What have you done for posterity ?

This last sally excited a general laugh, 
even the Orator's rifrid features relaxed into 
a smile, but reassuming all his sternness, he 
proceeded. 
" Posterity, I fear, will find these brats 
just such as is now their progenitor,  not 
a benefit but an incumbrance." 
This retort turned the tables on the 
interrupter.

of the smartness of the rap, proceeded. 
" Alas ! what are we all, but incum- 
brances, and the worst of incumbrances, 
occupying the most important stations in 
life to the exclusion of those much better 
qualified. Nay, we are fraudulent debtors, 
who, with full means in our power, with- 
hold the payment of a debt, the most 
sacred that can be contracted. Yet we 
dare boast of our honor-- honor indeed ! 
It is a gross delusion. Were we not as 
blind to our dearest interests, as we are 
supine in the execution of our duties, we 
should know  we should feel  that, in the 
punctual discharge of that very debt, real 
honor, true glory consists.

assimilating us more and more to the

downright selfishness ; not the loftier sort 
that prompts ambition and leads through 
dangers to aggrandizement. A man in- 
fected with that vice may be criminal, yet 
is not mean. But our selfishness is a gro-

at a stand, but soon recovering his presence 
of mind.

such deeds of heroism, as when achieved,

The plaudits excited by this effusion of 
words and gallantry of action were raptu- 
rous and continued. The lady, round 
whom the gentlemen crowded, felicitations 
in their looks and voices, behaved prettily. 
She blushed, and smiled, and fanned, and 
ogled, and bridled, and, with a graceful 
concession, held out her lily hand on 
which a thousand kisses were imprinted. 
In an instant, sir Knight was seated

beside his Fair one receiving", with all the 
modesty he could display very many 
compliments on his oratorical talents. 
But, alas! the value of such compliment* 
the Ileceiver himself could but hold very 
cheap, when he beheld the attention of 
the Bestowers attracted by a species of 
entertainment infinitely inferior, in his 
estimation, to the one he had afforded. 
Sir Henry Off ham, who had absented 
himself, re-entered. He was seen strid- 
ing with great bustle towards the table 
which he ascended ; not satisfied with that 
commanding 1 eminence, he exalted him- 
self upon the chair of state on which he 
now stood erect, his body clad with the 
regal gown, on his head he affixed a huge 
conical tin-pudding frame, fresh scowered ; 
around the summit of which was strapped 
the collar with many bells, that was wont

to compass the sleek neck of the coun- 
tess dowager's lap-dog. In his dexter he 
held a coiled up paper, indeed the iden- 
tical one containing the wonder working* 
project, which he had snatched oat of the 
orator's pocket, as the latter, hastily pas- 
sing him, was making towards his lady, 
and his left hand was affectedly stuck in 
his bosom. The baronet's long sallow face, 
large black eyes and coarse features, stared 
so ruefully and so comically under his 
fool's cap, that it was impossible to with- 
hold the tribute of laughter he expected 
from the exhibition. He now indulged 
the spectators' and his own propensity 
with a variety of antics, nods, contor- 
tions, grimaces and quaint sounds : Punch 
himself could not have better performed. 
These being only intended as a prelude 
to the farce, he now unrolled the precious

document, and, in a voice similar in tones 
to those of the droll gentleman last named, 
proceeded to impart as much of its con- 
tents as he could himself peruse : but 
short was his progress therein. The honor- 
able writer unhappily was one of those 
geniusses, who flatter themselves that the 
valuable matter they commit to paper, 
needs not the ornament of fair inditing. 
His characters became in consequence 
downright hieroglyphics to the eye of an 
unskilful decypherer. 
The baronet, to use an expression of 
one present, " boggled most confoundedly," 
and the laugh, which at first had been 
for the exhibitor, was now turned against 
him, intermixed with hissings and hootings 
and cries of

Sir Henry awhile withstood the storm ; 
but at length his patience giving way, 
he threw his fool's cap into the midst of his 
tormentors, exclaiming.  " Here, I be- 
queath this amongst ye. Get each one 
made after the same ashion  then ye'll be 
all fitted." 
This [ebullition of folly over, they 
crowded round Domville, requesting him 
to impart to them the contents of his 
paper : but our Dreamer was by this time 
awake, or nearly so; and sobered by the 
buffoonery just witnessed, faint were the 
hopes he entertained of his intended coad- 
jutors. He now viewed his plan with 
nearly as much indifference as if it had 
been the conception of another : never- 
the'ess he complied and this was the sub- 
stance.

got over till the shooting season should 
begin, it proposed the adoption of bodily 
sports to the exclusion of sedentary games. 
This first clause was only intended as a 
probationary ordeal, the strict compliance 
with which alone could qualify any can- 
didate for admission into the newly insti- 
tuted order, to be called The Toilers, or 
Knights of the Tent \ because, during the 
fortnight that the exercise of grouse 
shooting was to last, the only canopy 
allowed betwixt them and the sky would be 
a tent. It was presumed that under such 
a covering, pitched in the very centre of 
the area, intended for their daily, labori- 
ous, sports, and in which spot little more 
than the bare necessaries of life could well 
be gathered, a habit of early rising and 
hardihood would be contracted, and the 
knights gradually weaned from those in-

dulgencies that tend to debilitate the frame. 
It was moreover declared that the scope 
and tendency of the association was not 
only to qualify its members for sportsmen ; 
but to enable sportsmen to become real 
soldiers, inured before hand to the priva- 
tions and hardships incident to a military 
life.  Then followed a variety of well- 
digested regulations for the well-being of 
the society, with penalties attached to the 
infraction of each. 
The whole concluded with an address 
to the countess dowager and her two 
daughters, requesting the former to honor 
the infant institution so far, as to become 
its Lady Patroness : the two ladies were 
besought to give it also their sanction, by 
permitting each knight to wear their favo- 
rite colours entwined, and by selecting a 
suitable dress^ as a uniform for the corps,

during 1 the whole time of its being upon

Such were the feeble means by which 
our Projector had hoped to achieve an 
alteration in the rooted dispositions of a 
score of thoughtless young men, with a 
view that their example might influence 
numbers of their rank and, in time, effect 
a reform, where a reform is certainly most 
wanted. 
Beings all corporeal, such as your plod- 
ding men of business, hold, I know, in 
utter contempt the gay creations of the 
lively and fanciful. The poet's pathos 
and harmonious numbers never reach their 
heart nor even affect their ears. These 
sticklers for mere matters of fact in their 
gloomy wisdom have no conception of in- 
tellectual enjoyments, and, like the oyster,

they contract the universe within the limits 
of their own shells. 
But the Writer of these pages is him- 
self too great a dreamer, not to make com- 
mon cause with his Hero in this instance. 
Truth compels him to acknowledge that 
the main business of his whole life has 
hitherto been a scries of visionary pro- 
jects without having yet made one step

so constantly infatuated is he with his de- 
lusions, that it is only at the birth of a

miscarriage of the former one.  Well, be 
it so  since the joys he derives from 
expectation greatly exceed the bitterness 
of disappointment, he hopes to dream 
on to the end of the chapter. 
Mr. Domville's plan, however, met with

PREPARATIONS. 
PlERCEFILD Castle was now the scene 
of additional bustle ; the ladies had full 
range for the display of their taste. In- 
deed a no less weighty employment fell 
to their share than that of selecting such 
a dress for the intended knights, as should 
indicate both the sportsman and the mili- 
taire, the gentleman with the man of 
fashion : close yet degage, spruce and 
elegant; neither plain nor showy, but 
tasteful, genteel, and befitting their rank.
## p. 83 (#97) ##############################################

The consultation was deep and prot- 
racted. 
A man and horse had been dispatched 
after the tailor of the family, reckoning 
that by the time of his arrival the selec- 
tion would be made. The tailor found 
them still debating on the subject, and, 
indeed, it afforded sufficient scope to exer- 
cise the ingenuity of a whole divan of 
female heads. 
Let us enumerate some of the moment- 
ous topics under discussion. 
First, the upper covering  after what 
fashion or cut should it be made up : whe- 
ther coat  frock  or jacket; with or 
without trimmings,  with or without fac- 
ings,  straight or lapelled,  high or low 
collared,  and chiefly of what colour  
whether of one or more. 
Next the under garment y'clept waist-

coat,  whether of satin, kerseymere or 
marcella.  straight, striped or zigzaged.  
Whether double or single breasted,  high 
or low pocketed,  color, of course, to 
match. Then came the nether covering,  
whether inexpressibles or pantaloons should 
be adopted,  of what materials these and 
how worked,  whether plain or embroi- 
dered^ to hang loose or set close. Merciful 
Heaven ! after they had discussed these 
knotty points, (settled they could not) 
"besides the addenda of hose, leggings or 
gaiters,  nay, down to the very shoes, 
there remained an article of no less im- 
portance than the shape, form or figure of 
the hat,  whether round or cocked,  with 
or without cockade,  whether high or low 
crowned,-*-narrow or broad brimmed,  
well plumed or featherless,  with gold or 
silver lace, or tassels, or without either

A quarto volume could not contain the 
multitudinous remarks that were urged on 
this single topic. 
Several ladies dropping in, they were 
appealed to and their appeal led to fresh 
discussions ; or rather they, like Milton's 
Chaos, by their decision the more em- 
broiled the subject.  At length the knight, 
I mean him of the thimble, who stood 
aloof at a respectful distance, ventured on 
a nearer approximation in the most ob- 
sequious manner. In order to secure 
favour for his boldness, and engage the 
attention of the fair debators he spread 
out, at full length, his card of patterns. 
This display of gay colours of every hue 
caught every eye, and, for a time, put 
an end to the consultation. The witchery 
it operated was such, that honest Snip, 
who had hitherto been viewed as a remote

planet of an inferior system, became at 
once the centre of attraction. 
This man was a clever contriver; in 
other words knew how to promote 
his interest by all the art and cunning of 
the fraternity. Being appealed to for his 
opinion respecting cloth, colour and cut, 
he gave it so cautiously, assented or dis- 
sented in so qualified a manner, listened 
to objections with so attentive a deference, 
re-appealed in his turn so insinuatingly, 
with a voice softened down almost to a 
whisper, and with such a pliability of atti- 
tudes, that, by degrees, he inclined a 
majority of the suffrages in favour of his 
purpose, and finally contrived to obtain an 
order for the precise cloth he had most to 
dispose of, and for those other articles he 
could more easily procure. He departed, 
boldly promising to have the clothes made

up and delivered within a time, less by 
one half, than he knew it was practi- 
cable for him to accomplish the task. 
The tailor dismissed, the hatter, who 
had been long in attendance, was now ad- 
mitted in. This man proved a fool, and 
thus he betrayed his folly : Lady Cle- 
mentina, who had seen a Spanish dress 
at some masquerade, had become in par- 
ticular enamoured with the hat and its 
appendages : it looked so smart, so gen- 
teel, so natty, so spruce, bespeaking both 
the gallant man and the cavalier. She 
now undertook to make the fellow sensi- 
ble of its form, by telling him that the 
hat was neither round nor cocked -, but 
only one side of the brim turned up, and 
so secured by means of a gold button and 
loop, with a white ostrich feather wav- 
ing above. Master Woolly listened with

all the wisdom a stupid face could assume, 
but when she added that all the hats, 
twenty-one in number, must be produced 
in five days ; the hatter, as timorous in 
making* promises as the tailor was daring 
in breaking them, lifted up his hands in 
piteous intreaty, protesting that it would 
nearly take that space of time to pro- 
vide himself with a block for the pur- 
pose. 
That unlucky word was his condemna- 
tion. " In that case, my good fellow, 
keep the block as a substitute for your 
head, and you will then have what you 
are.  You may leave the room.'' 
The loss of so profitable a job made 
him smartly feel the whole extent of his 
disgrace ; his clenched fist was dispatched 
upwards to punish the offending cause.  
It now appeared that the substitution had

been made, for his knuckles were worsted 
in the encounter. 
Now poured in pieces of cloth intended 
for the construction of three tents or mar- 
quees : whereupon the ladies fell to mea- 
suring, the maids to cutting out, and all 
the sempstresses of the neighbourhood 
were put in requisition. 
While the ladies are thus laudably em- 
ployed, turn we to the gentlemen. 
The whole length of their morning, dat- 
ing from ten till two (a couple of hours 
in each period earlier than usual) was 
tolerably well got through with the help 
of billiards, some gymnastic games and 
shooting at a mark. The latter recrea- 
tions were several times renewed and pro- 
secuted with a keenness that might have 
afforded some hope, had not that keen- 
ness been mostly excited by the rage for

betting*. As for Mr. Domville, who bad 
suggested the sports, he thought proper 
to remove bis person from the scene. 
The truth was that he happened, at that 
juncture, to be seized with the furor poe- 
tica : the irresistible impulse brought 
him within the more retired spot' of the 
park. His resolution was no less than to 
commemorate in along poem of imperish- 
able verse, the new project and its future 
consequences, to be, of course, inscribed 
to Lady Olivia Piercefield. Upon second 
thoughts, however, this epopeia he would 
endeavour to confine within the limits of 
two cantos; which afterwards was only to 
find matter for an epistle; and finally he 
reduced it to a sonnet, which sonnet he 
contrived to accomplish. Not a litt'e 
elevated with the production, he hurried 
to his chamber, in order to write it out

fair and to see how it looked. But 
the next morning", on a re-perusal, he found 
reason to abate much of the encomium 
he had bestowed on the lines, and the day 
after they were thrown by as a poor thing. 
For this reason it shall not be inserted 
here, as I ought not to suppose the Pub- 
lic less fastidious than its author. 
The evening of this day also proved a 
period of bustle and activity. All the 
apparatus for a tea party and collation 
was boated over in vessels, manned by the 
gentlemen themselves, from the castle to a 
beautiful temple, erected on an island in 
the centre of a lake. Thither the ladies 
and their friends were conveyed by the 
same means and the same rowers. The 
interval between the meals was enlivened 
by boat races. Much gallantry was eli- 
cited from the honourable contenders.

spirited on by the fair beholders who were 
both the awarders and bestowers of the 
prizes. They strove for victory with as 
much apparent exertion as if some hun- 
dreds of pounds depended upon the issue, 
and we are not quite sure that some such 
motive was not the principal incentive. 
Nor did their gallantry cease at the close 
of the nautical games. A dance seeming 
to meet the wishes of the ladies, a chosen 
number were dispatched to convey over 
lady Clementina's harp. On their return, 
each gentleman, his fair partner in hand, 
stood up. The hearts of both sexes beat 
high in expectation of a pleasure that was 
so soon to be realized. The harp struck 
up a lively tune, and their feet, in sprightly 
mazes, moved in unison with the animat- 
ing sounds. 
It was one of those treats that are

relished with the greater zest for being en- 
joyed on the moment of its proposal. For 
often the mind, wearied in the contem- 
plation of a promised indulgence, be- 
comes languid when the hour for its gra- 
tification is arrived. 
The last rays of the setting sun beheld 
the dance going on with unabated spirit, 
and the moon shone high in the heavens 
before it was relinquished. 
On their stepping into the boats to effect 
their return, the night was so beautifully 
serene, the vast expanse of waters, fringed 
all round with a rich variety of foliage, 
appeared so lovely, so novel to their sight, 
in its present moony aspect, that, in order 
to prolong the contemplation of the scenery, 
they were several times rowed round the 
lake. 
The animation excited by the dance

gently subsided, all harsher feelings were 
hushed, and the mind reposing, as it were, 
on the tranquil bosom of nature, felt sensa- 
tions so refreshing, so benign, so religious, 
so philanthropic, that one of the party, and 
he not the least callous, and an epicure to 
boot, was heard to exclaim:  
" Oh, what a luxury I have hitherto 
missed" 
The pleasure they had derived from this 
extempore ball was too keenly felt not to 
wish for a repetition. My lord Piercefield 
who, in consonance with the amplitude of 
his means, did every thing upon a grand 
scale, issued cards of invitation to all 
the nobility and gentry, residing within an 
extensive circuit of his mansion. In ad- 
dition to this, Domville's suggestion, first 
hinted to lady Olivia and warmly taken up 
by her ladyship, prevailed. The invitation

in consequence also reached the principal 
tenants of his lordship, and, through them, 
the more respectahle part of their neigh- 
bours, amongst the former, farmer Stubble, 
his dame and blooming family were of 
course included. 
O the influence of French names, when 
timely sounding on congenial ears ! Lady 
Olivia was listening to her admirer's 
remark with a sort of playful indifference, 
more intent upon displaying the turns of 
her pretty neck, than upon reaping any 
benefit from his remark; when, in conclu- 
sion, he happened to say that the entertain- 
ment won'.d then become what the French 
term La fete da chateau.  Instantaneous 
was the effect of these magical words. 
" It shall be done, cried she, rising. 
I'll go to my brother this very instant, and

give orders for the necessary arrange- 
ments." 
Thus were the parties concerned in- 
debted to her successful application for 
additional pleasure, and that more widely 
diffused. Although short was the notice 
given, (the day appointed for the shooting 
expedition being too near at hand to allow 
a greater latitude) numerous and diversi- 
fied was the party assembled on the time 
fixed for their appearance. But the enter- 
tainment derived by the various ranks was 
by no means proportionate to their re- 
spective consequence; in this, as in all 
other treats, the greater share of enjoyment 
fell to the less fastidious. It is true that the 
ostentatious had full scope to display his 
grandeur, the wealthy his acquisitions, the 
ladies their finery, the sarcastic to vent his

malignity, and the quizzer to introduce his 
substitute for wit. But enjoyment, much 
less embittered and more lasting", the good 
naturedpart of the fashionable groups de- 
rived from their condescension and urban- 
ity; for the pleasure given is generally 
returned with usury to the bestowers. 
The awe and restraint to which the 
tenantry were at first subjected, gradally 
wore off.  They laughed,  they quaffed,  
they feasted,  they caroused; but most of 
them preferred the steward's hospitality to 
the grand banquetting room. Their ruddy 
complexioned daughters too ! how the eye 
wandered over the costly furniture of the 
apartments; with what delight they be- 
held and admired the elegant, the splen- 
did dresses of the ladies their own, alas, 
how inferior! How cordially they gave 
themselves up to the exhilarating spirit of

the dance ! How trilling- was the touch, 
perhaps the squeeze of some first-rate 
beau. I beg his pardon  Exquisite*.  
True it was that, when comparing their 
lowliness with such altitudes, they jfelt 
the sting of envy, and that rivalship and 
disappointment now and then marred their 
pleasures ; but still they pursued the re- 
creation with keener relish and more last- 
ingly, and morning broke in upon them be 
fore the thoughts of giving over ever 
occurred to their minds. At length they 
departed, and then such an alteration took 
p^ace in the respective situations of these 
returning parties, that the ladies were ge- 
nerally obliged to lead home the gentle- 
men who had escorted them thither.

whether that fashionable expression, already growing

conception of Mr. Domville, the first step 
was to be made that would ultimately lead to 
the consummation so devoutly to be wish- 
ed, namely, the improvement, both moral 
and physical, of the higher classes ; the 
effects of which would, of course, be be- 
neficially felt by the lowest cottager in the 
realm,

other requisite. A few hours after, the 
courteous knights with mighty bustle, in 
high glee and in spruce attire, being all 
mustered, took their ceremonious leave of 
the ladies of Piercefield castle and sallied 
out upon their adventurous expedition. 
According to the regulations laid down, 
it was enjoined that every member of the 
society should become, as much as pos- 
sible, his own helper ; in consequence one 
servant only was allowed for five knights. 
Thus attended, forth they proceeded in 
regular order two by two, each Cavalier 
carrying his own fowling-piece and am- 
munition, the servants bringing up the 
rear. 
As the tailor had failed in providing 
them with the uniform dress according to 
his promise (possibly he may have been, 
fust then, compulsively employed in the

furnishing' of a large funeral,) they were 
fain to equip themselves in the sporting 
jackets they had previously provided for 
the occasion. These jackets of various 
colours, all gay and even splendid, at- 
tracted the sight and excited the curiosity 
of every one they met. The labour of the 
hind and the tittle-tattle of the gossip were 
suspended: beldames bending under their 
burdens of stolen sticks, now unheeding 
the danger of detection, tarried on the 
road agape, till their sight failed them ; 
and the procession, as it passed, collected 
the whole population of every hamlet. 
At first, the novelty of their situation, 
the buoyancy of youth, and the bracing 
effects of the morning air, kept them in 
good humour; and jokes passing to and 
fro excited their merriment : but the ride 
was long, and its tedium unrelieved by any

droll incident, they in consequence soon 
began to feel weary and discontented. 
Thus on they journeyed, staring and 
stared at  now finding the sun confound- 
edly hot, or the breeze cursed cold, or the 
roads devilishly broken, or their gnus 
plaguily heavy, or their saddles damnably 
hard ; and as they ascended the more ele- 
vated regions, the keenness of the air 
excited a corresponding keenness of appe- 
tite ; which, alas, they had not for the pre- 
sent any means of gratifying, and they 
stared at each other in utter astonishment, 
at having for once missed a meal. 
In that emergency they halted for the 
purpose of holding a consultation. Mr. 
Domville being naturally applied to as the 
original contriver of the expedition, la- 
mented that he had omitted to provide the

party with sumpter mules, as practised in 
days of yore. 
" Damn the mules," cried Sir Henry 
Offham, " a jack ass with a brace of weii 
stored panniers would have answered the 
purpose well enough ; but not one of us 
has had the good sense to be his own jack 
ass except myself: in proof of which here 
is my provender." 
So saying, he pulled out a liberal allow- 
ance of cold tongue and a proportionate 
quantum of bread.  "Now, Gentlemen, 
in me behold the Performer, as Spectators, 
nothing will I charge ye for the exhibi- 
tion." But finding by their urgency to 
become sharers, they were likely to annoy 
him in his masticating performance, lie 
looked about him, espied a convenient spot, 
leaped from his steed, ran up a stiff accli-

vity, and reaching a projecting rock that 
overhung the road, down he squatted him- 
self, while the gaping hungry cavalcade 
formed a semi-circle beneath. Sir Henry 
without loss of time fell unmercifully upon 
his stores, every fragment of which he de- 
voured, unheeding the taunts, muttering*,

From a limpid spring he quaffed where-

other knights were debarred from, as they 
had not stowed within themselves any pro- 
vocatives that called for such a supply. 
However, a hamlet they soon after reached, 
afforded them that sort of homely fare they

hardly knew of but by accidental hear- 
say. Though the baronet's provender 
was a luxury compared with their present 
food, such a havock did they commit on 
the cottager's stores, that these found 
themselves in the same state of dearth, as 
a small island in the West Indian Archipe- 
lago is reduced to, after a visit from a 
fleet of twenty British men of war. 
Towards evening", harassed and way- 
worn, they reached the place of their des- 
tination : and soon after they were cheered 
by the sight of the waggons, that had 
taken a more circuitous road in order to 
gain the same spot. The knights would 
gladly have fallen at once on their evening* 
repast  but labour and time were requi- 
site before the tents could be unpacked, 
and before their alimentary stores could be 
disencumbered from other luggage, every

one was called upon to help. At length, 
by dint of great, and to them unusual 
exertions, prolonged as these were by 
their own inexpertness, the tents were 
pitched, accommodations within and the 
requisites for a good substantial repast 
placed before them. This being enjoyed 
in full, CARDS ! No, sleep was the 
next call, and so sound was their repose, 
that the privations and fatigues of the day 
were for many successive hours quite buried 
in oblivion. 
It were not difficult however to predict 
that, of an assemblage composed of the 
afore described materials, the component 
parts would be speediiy disunited.  The 
novelty of their situation, with the pleasure 
of the sport, held them together for two or 
three days; the shame of betraying a lack 
of bottom spirited them on to the con-

elusion of the fourth ; but on the fifth, 
tones of dissatisfaction, followed by com- 
plaints and murmurs, broke forth against 
the unlucky promoter of the expedition, 
who, fortunately for himself, happened to 
be absent at that juncture. They cursed 
and damned him in round set terms, for 
a visionary projector, and called them- 
selves so many fools, for suffering their 
wisdom to be led astray by his folly. 
Without beat of drum, sound of trumpet, 
or any other military notification, they 
would have forthwith ridden back to the 
castle, had not one of the party, more 
provident than the rest, attracted their 
attention by producing and unpacking 
two and fifty layers of neat paste-board, 
all of equal dimensions and of an oblong 
form ; white, smooth and plain on the 
outside, but the insides of some were

from them ; and their sojourn on the 
mountain was in consequence prolonged. 
But the next day (Sunday) without strik- 
ing" their tents, or even evincing- any reli- 
gious care for their household goods, and 
though in a most disorderly array, shew- 
ing their total relaxation from all disci- 
pline, rapidly and safely did the knights 
contrive to effect their retreat to the castle, 
their former and more convenient head- 
quartels. 
By Adventurers so very spirited it is pre- 
sumed that more would have been achieved, 
had their heroical ardour been kept from 
cooling by the blazing sight of their regi- 
mental dress ; but unfortunately for the 
elucidation of that point, the uniforms 
came on the very day they had departed, 
with complimentary notes from the ladies,

sports and arduous career, intimating an 
intention of soon paying them a visit, and 
hoping at the same time they had escaped 
catching cold. 
The clothes were escorted by master 
Snip in propria persona. He arrived in 
the heat of the day, panting, bustling, and 
sweltering, his head filled with lying ex- 
cuses for the delay, his tongue ready to 
deliver them and his impudent face unable to 
betray any sense of shame in the delivery. 
Acute was his regret at their unlooked for 
departure, and his subsequent vexation 
much more so. For, after a number of 
calls on his quondam customers, to induce 
them to try the clothes in hopes of pay- 
ment, they did not even allow him a 
chance of displaying their attractions, but

over to the merciless baronet, who dis- 
patched him to a variety of places for 
payment, where no payment was to be 
had ; and the well sealed epistolary dis-

subject the bearer to a caning or horse-

ing out that they were only hoaxing him, 
was obliged to put up with the loss of 
time, the whole of his profit, and with a 
considerable part of the prime cost. An 
awful and, we hope, a deterring warning 
to such gentry, against their too common 
practice of extending their promises be- 
yond the possibility of their performance. It

bodily castigation could inflict, for having 
thus wantonly sported, in a matter of such 
infinite importance, with the sacred majesty 
of truth. 
Thus terminated this silly expedition, 
the only permanent result of which was, in 
due time, commemorated in the rate-books 
of the surrounding* parishes, entry being 
therein made of an increase of popula- 
tion to be hereafter maintained at the ex-

of sundry damsels, which frailty, to judge 
by the coinciding time of their accouch-

lordship's incontinency.

the very characteristic manner in which

disposed of : it amounted to a pretty large 
sum. Domville proposed to bestow the 
money on some charitable institution ; 
Piercefield wanted to make it the prize 
of some race or shooting match ; a steady 
worshipper of the blind goddess was for 
committing' the a ward to Dame Fortune 
through the medium of a lottery ; but the 
generality of suffrages was decidely in 
favour of a boxing match. In consequence, 
a couple of countrymen, endued with more 
strength than brains, agreed to maul each 
other for the sum and the spectator's 
diversion. What diversion was obtained,

the consequences to the combatants can 
be soon told.  The vanquished did not

disposition he had often felt, started early 
from his tent, for the purpose of exploring' 
the more remote and solitary parts of these 
wild regions. He rode to a farm house, 
erected a considerable way within the 
mountains, and thence proceeded on foot 
over hill and dale ; but chiefly directing 
his steps where vvildness and abruptness of 
ascent seemed to forbid the approach of 
man. 
The morning was warm, the air still. 
About noon, lassitude and excessive heat 
induced him to look out for some shady, 
resting place :  that shelter he would have 
reached in a much more precipitous 
manner than he intended, had he not 
luckily cast his eye that way, before he 
made another step, for he then stood on 
the verge of a huge, jutting, stone, that 
overhung a sort of abyss, very irregular in

its circumference of above three hundred 
yards, and not lessthan thirty feet 
deep. He had a bird's eye survey over the 
extent, and descried in its centre a small 
pool; the depth of which gave its waters so 
dark a hue, that Domville hailed it by the 
name of lake Avernus. Not a weed fringed 
its margin; indeed no signs of vegetation 
were perceptible within the area, except a 
few thorny'shrubs that grew 7 here and there 
within the clefts of the surrounding- rocks. 
Our Adventurer still remained on the 
brink, struck with the silentious gloom of 
their nether scenery ; but the clouds, that 
had been for some time gathering, began to 
dissolve, at first in a few very large drops ; 
these as they smote the waters of the lake, 
gave a disturbed, speckled, aspect to its 
hitherto smooth, death like placidity  and

it curled r-p vi angry waves, like a grin oil 
the midnight ruffian's countenance 
Such was the repulsive aspect of this 
gloomy recess, that Domville, a solitary 
being on the whole extent of the mountain- 
ous wasteland exposed to the sudden burst 
of the storm, collected over his head, hesi- 
tated to accept the shelter afforded under 
its projecting rocks. His resolve was 
determined by a gust of wind which blew 
off his hat ; it fell into the lake below. The 
privation of that covering was now too 
keenly felt, not to endeavour its recovery 
at some risk : he stepped into a ravine or 
deep channel, by which his descent was 
considerably lessened and, by means of 
hands, knees and feet, judiciously and 
carefully p'aced, he found himself at the 
bottom, and soon recovered his strayed 
property.

Domville hastened to discover what 
shelter the jutting 1 rocks and bushes could 
afford him. On the west side of the coomb, 
he met with a snug recess just under the 
wind* Now came the tremendous visita- 
tion forth in its full fury. The dark clouds 
poured their contents on the earth, the 
wind raged, the lightning flashed and the 
thunder roared. 
Amidst the turmoil of the conflicting 
elements, Man, who proudly calls himself 
the Lord of the creation, is humbled by the

situation he hails his fellow sufferer, whom, 
at all other times, he would have spurned. 
Domviile had not even that consolation. 
As he cast an anxious look around, he felt 
he was alone, and on himself alone must

re! j for the care of his being*. Bui from 
that depression the mind by degress 
recovers its loftiness. In watching the 
progress and declension of the storm, he 
also marked its desolation with a firmer 
eve. Even a proud satisfaction is derived 
by daring to contemplate, with a heart, 
though dismayed, yet unsubdued, the 
sublime grandeur of the conflict. It was 
one of those thunder storms, whose rage is 
in an inverse proportion to its short 
duration, and the small extent prescribed 
to its ravages. Nature had collected its 
destroying energies to hurl them with 
greater effect on one devoted spot. The 
earth smoked as the rain struck upon it, 
the wind with sudden gusts forced in the 
cavities of the rocks, or raging unimpeded 
in its career, hissed, roared, or howled, or 
mournfully sighed, as apparently spent, it

'gave a momentary pause :  the shrubs 
exposed to the blast, were dashed against 
the rocks and, recovering", indignant shook 
off the feculent drops from their shattered 
foliage. With soul appalling vividness 
the flashing lightning glared in the dark 
sky, and the rattling peals of thunder, 
reverbrating in quick succession from hill 
to hill, might well be supposed the ex- 
ecuting ministers of an offended Deity. 
Now the rain waters from the heights 
around poured into the glen ; the turbid 
streams swelled and discoloured the con- 
tents of the lake which overflowed its 
banks, and, though a vent there was for 
their emission, the torrents that continued 
to flow nearly deluged the whole level of 
the en closure. 
When the rain had abated, Domville left 
his station, endeavouring to find a way riut

of the glen. The only outlet discoverable 
was a rough, winding", passage that parted 
the rocks., but so narrow, that in its tor- 
tuosities he found his progress often im- 
peded. 
Within an angle of this passage a low, 
rudely-shaped, door struck his sight. As- 
tonished at the unexpected discovery, some 
time elapsed ere he called out: but hear- 
ing no answering voice he tried the door. 
It was much decayed, and as he pressed 
his strength against it, a staple fixed in- 
side gave way, and a room of a low dimi- 
nutive size, coarsely hewn out of the rock, 
appeared before him : a broken table and 
chair with a truckle bed, its only furni- 
ture. After another fruitless attempt at 
giving notice of his approach, he resolved 
further to trj the adventure, he ven- 
tured to turn the knob of a wider door

which easily opened. To his utter asto- 
nishment and, as if by enchantment, he 
beheld, and stepped into an airy, modern 
apartment, not inelegantly furnished. 
A door window facing the south opened 
into a lawn, and through its panes he be- 
held a most singular sight. 
At the extremity of the lawn, on the 
very verge of a precipice, stood a man 
motionless, dressed in a blue uniform faced 
with red, a regimental cocked hat covered 
his head, and in his dexter glittered a 
sword. The storm had partially renewed 
its fury ; just after a loud clap of thunder, 
the report of a pistol was heard ; the sol- 
dier received the bullet in his breast  
he was seen to stagger but fell not; and 
now a youth, a meer stripling, brandishing 
a dagger, another pistol in his belt, rushed 
G 2

upon him, and struck him several times 
with his weapon, and then hurled him down 
the precipice! ! f 
Hardly was the murderous deed com- 
mitted, when an elderly man, sheltered by 
a huge umbrella, having* a youthful dam- 
sel under his arm, hastened to the spot; 
the umbrella was committed to the lady's 
care, and he, holding forth his open arms, 
the boy rushed into them. 
After an effusion of the fondest parental 
caresses, the party was seen directing their 
steps to the dwelling, now solely occupied 
by Mr. Domville who, to tell the truth, was 
rather in an awkward predicament. Stand- 
ing within an angle of the room, he 
anxiously eyed them, awaiting detection, 
desirous, yet ashamed, of retreating the 
way he came. 
Never was a stronger contrast exhibited

than the appearance and demeanour of 
the young female with the atrocious deed 
of which she had been a witness ; nor 
could he ought discover in the youthful 
perpetrator but what was rather pre- 
possessing than otherwise : but the senior's 
person  chiefly his fierce., vindictive fea- 
tures accorded but too well with the 
horrible scene. He was straight, tall, and 
well proportioned, yet much of the alarm 
excited by such a figure was lessened by 
evident marks of age on his frame. 
The party was, by this time, close to the 
glass door, and made their entrance one 
by one  first the elder who, on perceiving 
the intruder, retreated a step and with 
arms extended, stared motionless in silent 
astonishment; the youth and maiden now 
appeared within. The youth, the swell of 
whose features excited by his late exploit

had not yet subsided, as if ready for a 
second encounter, hastily grasped the 
pommel of his sword in a very determined 
and hero-like manner. His sister, for so 
we will suppose her, as quickly placed her 
hand upon his arm ; thus checking" his 
motion, and the look of female benignity 
extremely engaging, she gave him, assured 
the stranger of personal safety. 
The father, in the mean time, gave signs 
of animation by a countenance expressive 
of alarm, anger and irresolution. His glar- 
ing eye ball rolled from Domville to the 
window, then to the door, then round the 
apartment, then again was fixed on the 
stranger, who attempted rather hesitatingly 
an apology for his appearance, which the 
other stopped short by crying out in an 
agitated, broken, manner: 
C'est ttrange ceci, Ires Hrange!  Corn-

ment Diable a-t-il pu?  Cet tiourdi tie 
Blondin  oit est il ?  nest-il pas encore 
revenu ?" 
Our Englishman, perceiving they were 
foreigners, assured the gentleman in 
French that chance alone had brought 
him to the spot, that the fierceness of the 
storm had compelled him to shelter with- 
in his dwelling, and now, that the rain had 
ceased, he would take his leave. 
" Ecoutez, Monsieur" said the foreigner., 
stepping up to him with an anxious tre- 
pidation in his voice and manner. " Y 
a-t-il long-tems que vous etes ici " 
" Hardly a minute," was the reply with 
some violation of truth. 
This assurance gave some satisfaction, 
and in order to increase it, Domville 
added that he had been almost the whole 
time stationed in the back room, through

which he gained admittance and which he 
had but just left. 
" Si cela est, vous riavez done rien vu?" 
Here he stopped and looked as if he 
wished to recal the question, as it might 
lead him to betray his secret. The Eng- 
lishman, perceiving his embarrasment, 
thought it more prudent to remove the 
cause by calmly saying : " that the room 
was too dark for him to distinguish any 
object.' ' 
Though all suspicion was not yet 
dispelled, and though a longer stay 
still subjected him to personal dan- 
ger (for the young man's unloaded pistol 
remained yet in his belt) he could not pre- 
vail upon himself to make his parting bow ; 
but detained by curiosity, or perhaps by 
another motive, tarried a little longer and, 
professing himself a stranger in these parts, 
enquired the shortest way for David

Morgan's farm.  The old gentleman could 
give him no information on that head. 
Blondin  his man Blondin could tell. 
But Blondin was absent. 
Here the young lady interfered, and with 
a voice the influence of which no heart 
could resist, and an earnestness of manner 
to set him right on his track, lest any 
harm should betide him, partly in broken 
English and partly in good French, de- 
livered her directions. 
Her speech had ended, yet some mo- 
ments elapsed ere Domville, recovering 
himself, returned her thanks in his most 
graceful manner, which thanks were as 
gracefully received; then bowing to the 
senior and not forgetting the weaponed 
youth, for whom, notwithstanding his sis- 
ter's superior attractions, and 'spite of the 
deed he had just witnessed, ne could nor

help feeling a lively interest, he in good 
earnest took his leave. 
The track indicated to him went across 
the lawn : he longed to step aside towards 
the precipice, that he might have another 
view of the murdered individual; but for- 
bore, aware that his every motion was 
narrowly watched. So he pursued his jour- 
ney, his mind intent upon the recollection 
of the late event, endeavouring to ac- 
count for the singular transaction, and 
to frame for himself a proper line of con- 
duct. 
A considerable time elapsed before he 
reached the hospitable farmer's dwelling, 
upon whose stores he made ample amends 
for so long and so arduous a fasting. The 
call of hunger silenced, he cautiously in- 
terrogated his host respecting the strange 
inhabitant of the glen, but scanty was

the information obtained ; all he could 
collect was, that an outlandish family had 
arrived in these parts, about the beginning 
of spring", and had taken up their resi-

by the name of the Hermit's Cave ; but 
greatly enlarged since the time it was ac- 
cupied by the Anchorite: that the servant 
often called at the farm for provisions, 
which he paid for as he obtained them ; 
but as he did not pry into his concerns, 
honest David thought it unmannerly to be 
inquisitive about theirs. 
Domville had some thoughts of impart- 
ing all he knew of the transaction to a ma- 
gistrate ; but desisted on a surmise w* ich, 
as he reconsidered the subject, bordered 
upon a certainty: namely, that this supposed 
murdered man was only the effigy of one. 
He at all events determined on visiting the

Coomb next day, ere he took further steps 
in this mysterious affair; with this intent 
he took up his night's lodging at the farm, 
instead of returning to his tented com- 
panions. The same conjectures still pur- 
sued him in bed, and weary as he was 
from the effects of his pedestrian excur- 
sion, they kept him long awake. 
Thus he reasoned with himself: 
If shooting at a mark was the sole mo- 
tive, surely the midst of a storm was a 
strange time chosen for the sport; what 
sport besides could result from murdering 
the object? That this was a lifeless ob- 
ject must be obvious. No human being, 
having the free use of his limbs, would 
stand motionless, like a target, to be shot 
at and then stabbed. On the other hand, 
the old gentleman's agitation and his

anxiety for concealment betrayed other sen- 
sations than those that would be excited, by 
being* detected in an innocent recreation. 
But again, per contra, it was morally impos- 
sible that the beautiful young" foreigner 
could hold kindred with murderers; and 
yet she bore a striking family likeness with 
the youth, which likeness cou'd even be 
traced in the elder. The recollection of 
this lovely Angel (for so he rapturously 
called her) brought before him as in a 
vision, her figure, her dress, her voice, 
her gait  all was rehearsed. On that sub- 
ject he dwelt till exhausted nature closed 
his eye-lids late in the night; in conse- 
quence the morning was far advanced 
towards noon, ere he departed for the 
glen. 
Had he set out as early as he intended,

he would have caught the family in the 
bustle or act of departure ; but when he 
reached the spot, the dwelling only re- 
mained, carefully locked up and fastened 
inside ; and the staple which he had forced 
out replaced with additional securities. 
He then repaired to the precipice down 
which he had seen the soldier hurled. 
Nought could he trace except the rem- 
nants of a late fire ; the ashes were still 
warm, and the blaze was further attested 
by some loose straw and fragments of half 
burnt sticks. 
Thus baffled in all his attempts to come 
at the truth of this singular transaction, 
and perceiving no sign of habitation near, 
he was induced to retrace his steps to 
the farm and thence to the camp, which 
he reached a few hours after his com-

Piercefield castle, whither he followed 
them, not a little indignant at their so soon 
relinquishing an expedition, from which 
such mighty results were expected.

A PORTRAIT. 
DOMVILLE had the good sense to 
forbear imparting to any of his present 
companions the event recorded in the 
last chapter ; there was too little conge- 
niality of mind between him and such 
mere sensualists, the love of pleasure the 
only cement ; that being removed, the re- 
mainder was easily severed. Indeed the 
whole party, a few days after, dispersed 
themselves in various directions, in quest 
of that pleasure they easily found but

scantily enjoyed. Thus Piercefield castle 
from a thronged mansion became again a 
solitude. 
But ere we dismiss for some time, per- 
haps for ever, the late inhabitants of the 
Coomb, the Reader, wejpresume, will 
not be sorry to peruse Domville's descrip- 
tion of the lovely stranger, recorded in a 
letter thus indited to an intimate ac- 
quaintance. 
" Dear L angle y, 
* After having heard my account of the 
mysterious sight I beheld in North Wales* 
you particularly wish for a circumstantial 
description of la belle Fran$aise, and say 
you will not rest till you have obtained 
it from me. I feel no difficulty in oblig- 
ing you. Take then, as it comes, what

both my memory and my heart sug- 
gest. 
" As she approached the house., the 
cast of her countenance struck me forci- 
bly : the impression more owing to mind 
than beauty. I thought her interesting, 
but not beautiful then : the effect of her 
charms was lessened by an ample shawl and 
other sheltering apparel. But her features 
seemed to express distinctively, though still 
with the mildness of resignation/a disapproval 
of the savage scene she had been compelled 
(I suppose) to witness. I fancied I could 
further discern what I have not yet met 
with  an elevation of mind under the most 
attractive, female, gentleness. 
" But when she appeared before me not 
four yards apart; her face as handsome as 
we can conceive nature to form it,  when 
with the umbrella she laid aside the cover-

ing that concealed her neck and the most 
beautiful fall of shoulders ever beheld, 
many beauties of both, though still curtained 
by a triple row of frill were visible, when her 
elegant form and upright figure, with such 
symmetry as we would ascribe to Venus, 
were displayed before my ravished senses, 
I felt all their loveliness  all their witch- 
ery.  1 owned the presence of real beauty, 
and could have worshipped it.  Wish you 
for a more particular account ? I will en- 
deavour to gratify your wish. 
Her age does not, I believe, exceed six- 
teen; yet some indications would induce one 
to think her older.  Her dress, the color of 
which I forget or never knew, though not 
quite fashionable, was highly becoming, 
because it fitted her shape ; it seemed some 
how to denote purity of mind as well as 
cleanliness of person:  her profuse light

brown hair was gracefully ttirbaned round 
her head, the Lumber of natural ringlets 
showing its soft suppleness :  her com- 
plexion fair, although a faint tinge from a 
more southern climate might be traced 
upon it : her forehead rather large than 
otherwise, and exactly of that shape which 
your cranialogists describe as indicative of 
sense -, that and the expressive brilliancy 
of her dark brown eyes, together with the 
bold arch of her brows, would proclaim 
majesty and even imperiousness, were they 
not tempered by her sweet pretty mouth, 
her moist coral lips, (somewhat parted) 
her dimpled cheeks  all denoting gentle- 
ness, benevolence and benignity.  The 
nose, that feature which often mars the 
effect of an otherwise handsome counte- 
nance, blended the two desperate charac- 
ters of her own, and made one harmonious

whole. From an indentation scarcely 
perceptible it smoothly rose to a due 
proportion, reminding' me of that of 
Canova's Venus. The only reason that 
prevents me from believing he took her's 
as his model, arises from the suggestion 
that, had he known this young lady, one 
feature would not have satisfied him.  
She must have sat for the whole figure. 
" There were traces of a melancholy 
smile still on her lips and, youthful as she 
is, it is plain that she must have known 
misfortune, and that she has profited 
bv it. 
" I can describe her neck but by a con- 
tradiction in terms. It was so delicately 
well contoured, that it seemed artificially 
made, yet perfectly natural and unaffected 
in all its motions. I have often admired

cealed and, though her youth forbade a 
full development *- 
Here the honorable writer's too warm 
colouring requires us to omit some of that 
part of his narrative. 
" Her arms swelling and tapering to her 
finger's ends, according to the strictest 
rules of symmetry, bespoke the same pro- 
portion for her other limbs, which were 
besides made sufficiently apparent by the 
shape of her pretty foot and ankle. On 
reading this description, I know you will 
exclaim with your wonted incredulity.  
u This paragon is then a perfect beauty." 
Upon my soul I think she is.

" But the more powerful charm of this 
lovely creature, that which produced the 
most striking effect, was the tone of her 
voice. How its sound bespoke a soul 
worthy to animate that lovely frame!  
How it harmonized with the hearer's every 
better sensation,  how it told of a mind 
fraught with the best attributes of her sex. 
It was ethereal,  yet it was feminine. My 
ear yet retains the notes, and my heart will 
never forget them. The effect was indeed 
irresistible.  Thus delicious, thus sanctify- 
ing, is the influence of real heauty, when 
it respects itself.  It purifies the very 
desires it excites. 
" Let a materialist but behold her person 
and hear her voice, he must allow that 
thought is not matter, recant his former 
doctrine and become a convert to spirit- 
ualism.

" From the warmth of my expressions you 
will doubtless conclude that lam over 
head and ears in love and, of course, reft of 
my right senses : and your conclusion will 
be erroneous. Love at first sight I always 
did deride as a false notion. The heart 
may be moved, nay, strongly excited, 
during a short interview; but a further 
intercourse with the object is indispensible 
for the existence of real love. As well 
assert that seed by merely touching the soil 
will grow up a plant. Indeed I have now 
proved to conviction, that if any mortal 
could have performed that prodigy, it must 
have been the lovely stranger: and, as her 
charms have failed on a heart so suscept- 
ible as mine of female beauty, I conclude 
the thing impossible.- I finally conclude, 
remaining your's, &c. "' bn *

DEBITS AND CREDITS. 
SORRY are we that Mr. Domville is 
compelled to descend from such visionary 
altitudes to particulars much more per- 
sonal, and those of daily occurrence. It 
behoves him to ascertain the amount of 
his present stock of cash, whence can 
further supplies be derived, and how in 
other people's books (for he, good easy 
man, kept no such register) he stands in

the double character of debtor and cre- 
ditor. These particulars, but slightly 
mentioned in novels, are among- the most 
momentous transactions in real life, and 
so will our Hero find them. In one in- 
stance his conduct had been most uu- 
fashionable ; he had hitherto contrived to 
discharge his debts, therefore few were 
the outstanding ones. As for his credits, 
with the exception of some gambling 
claims of a very precarious payment, he 
could not muster up any. The money in 
hand was not inconsiderable, but the 
sources whence he drew his supplies threat- 
ened suddenly to become dried up. To 
account for this lamentable state of pecu- 
niary affairs in the son of a wealthy 
British nobleman, of habits not very ex- 
pensive, is the chief purpose of the pre- 
sent chapter, 
H 2

It must be recollected that his mother 
brought no accession of wealth to the 
family, that his father's relations entirely 
disregarded him, and that the viscount 
dying intestate, the whole landed pro- 
perty devolved on his brother, with whom 
he was now on terms of sworn foeship. 
A dissolution of parliament was shortly to 
take place ; for the seat he held, being his 
brother's property, he had not any chance 
of re-election. His friend Piercefield, it 
is true, had promised him adequate in- 
demnification by means of one of his 
own boroughs; but an unfortunate cir- 
cumstance is impending, sufficient to cool 
the ardour of a friendship much warmer 
than any in the power of that nobleman to 
feel. 
Some years back, Mr. Domville had for a 
distant relation, by the mother's side, a

West Indian planter who had realized a 
considerable property. The old gentle- 
man's pride was so much gratified in be- 
ing allied to one, to whose name the word 
Honourable was prefixed ; and in the few 
visits paid to him, so completely won by 
the blandishments of his manners, that 
onr Hero, oh his demise, found himself the 
sole executor and legatee of property 
amounting to upwards of 40,000, to the 
utter and unjust exclusion of the planter's 
nephew, against whom no serious charge 
could be substantiated. It was latterly 
with the means of this property, curtailed 
however of two thousand pounds, which 
sum Mr. Domville had presented to the 
disinherited nephew, that our Hero kept 
up the figure which gave him a passport 
into the higher circles. But on his ar- 
rival in town from Piercefield castle, he 
H 3

received a letter of very unpleasant con- 
tents penned by his solicitor ; the purport 
was, that a law-suit had been instituted 
against him as heir of the planter, in order 
to recover the sum of 30,000 with in- 
terest. 
About ten years back the old gentle- 
man had consented to become sole trustee 
to a minor, whose property was to that 
amount. This property had been, with 
the best intentions, placed in a concern 
deemed perfectly secure. However, by a 
series of misfortunes in the extensive trad- 
ing speculations of the firm, the Gazette 
had to record its failure. Domvilie, as 
sole inheritor of the trustee, was called 
upon to refund the property thus lost, or 
abide the event of a law-suit. Any fears 
he entertained as to the result were 
dispelled by the assurance of his legal

counsellor, who asserted that the adverse 
party had not a leg to stand upon. 
It were to be wished in affairs of this im- 
portance that the learned gentlemen of the 
long robe would entirely discard metapho- 
rical language and express themselves 
with legal precision. It happened, how- 
ever, that the plaintiff contrived to stand 
firm upon both his legs, and the defendant 
was reft of his own ; a verdict to the full 
amount being given in favour of the 
former. Mr. Domville became in conse- 
quence a ruined man, as the world empha- 
tically calls it ; and the more so, as re- 
ly ing on the assurance of his legal ad- 
viser, he had not provided by any re- 
trenchment for the worst that might hap- 
pen.

ple of pages dispatched the causes and

result of this trial, three years elapsed 
before its final conclusion ; yet, even while 
it was pending, the young man could not 
but remark in his friend Piercefield, unusual 
reserve and distance; indeed, amongst by 
far the majority of his companions it was 
deemed advisable to cut Mr. Domville's 
acquaintance. He had, in his turn, de- 
termined to forbear his visits to the fair 
lady Olivia, most heroically bent upon 
resigning her hand, rather than she should 
unite her destiny with one, now in point of 
fortune so greatly below her expectations. 
The lady seemed to view the subject in the 
same light, and to convince him how con-' 
sonant their sentiments were on that 
subject, she, after a short siege, surrendered 
herself in matrimonial bands to a colonel of 
of the Guards.

must now discard the luxuries, the plea-

all the trappings of fashionable life ; they 
are deemed absolutely indispensiblc re- 
quisites : how then can he exist without 
them ? Yet he will soon find with what

the prosperous for their own annoyance.

Three ways lay before him.  First, to 
live as long as he could upon his remnant 
of credit ; self expatriation or a prison 
the closing" scene.  Secondly, to throw 
himself upon the commiseration of friends 
and relatives, and thus live in idleness 
upon the cold pittance of charity ;  or, 
lastly, to provide for his maintenance by 
his own efforts, securing thereby the salu- 
brious independance both of body and 
and mind. Had he made any other selec- 
tion than the latter, his present historian 
would have chosen a worthier subject for 
his pen. 
But indecision and dilatoriness, backed 
by a consciousness of present cash, kept 
him long inert, idiy expecting that chance 
would throw in his way tho.se means, almost 
ever more solidly procured by individual 
exertions. True it is, that many offers

of friendship were at first tendered, and 
some actually performed, yet the contents 
of his purse became more and more re- 
duced ; and, though he had gradually 
weaned himself from his expensive habits, 
some time must elapse before true eco- 
nomy can be well practised. Yet how 
shall I relate his gradual descent from 
luxury to penury ! bis places of resort de- 
clining from mansions to hotels  to taverns 
thence to coffee-houses ; at length, Lord 
help us! to a chop-house -and lower still, 
perhaps, down into a cellar ! 
It was high time that something should 
be done. 
" Poh," said he to himself, one morn- 
ing, in a tone of bravado, " nothing easier. 
I am well known to possess some literary 
talent; surely my poetical genius has not 
departed with my equipage. At all events

I have already by me an abundance of 
small pieces; a selection will be soon 
made; any publisher will give me a round 
sum for the copy-right,  I'll set about it 
directly." 
So saying, he bestirred himself, collected 
together as much as with the modern art 
of expanding a little over a wide com- 
pass, would make up a neat volume duo- 
decimo, sent the manuscript to a dashing 
publisher and, with his compliments, ap- 
prising him that he would call to-morrow 
for his opinion of the work. 
On his waiting on this Accoucheur des 
Muses, he was received in the most 
respectful, obsequious, manner. The man 
was in raptures at the beauties, the many 
striking beauties of the performance.

rapidly.  It cannot fail of running through 
several editions.** 
The pleasure our Poet felt at these 
praises so liberally bestowed was con- 
siderably damped, when by entering into 
details, it appeared evident that the en- 
comiast had not even perused the manu- 
script* In other respects his conduct as a 
dealer and chapman was very singular.  
To expose faults and conceal beauties be- 
ing, it is well known, the general practice 
of purchasers. 
" Well, Mr. Margin, as I gave yon the 
first offer in the disposal of these pieces, 
what is the sum you can afford for them ?*' 
This home-put question somewhat stag- 
gered the bookseller, he stammeringly re- 
plied : 
" Why, as to that, Sir  to be sure, Sir, 
some price must be set on the poems

but then it would be found, I fear, inade- 
quate to their value I thought, Sir,  
I thought  But I suppose it was a mis- 
take of mine." 
" What do you mean r '

for the gratification of your many noble 
friends ; in that case I should be happy in

" By no means, nothing further from 
my thoughts, I assure you. My noble 
friends, as you call them, must purchase 
copies if they wish any." 
" True, Sir, true; it is very fitting they 
should. Well then, Sir, suppose, Sir, 
suppose we contrive it differently.  Hem  
What say you to my undertaking the

bursed from the sale, suppose we equally 
divide the profits." 
" That may be fair enough for aught 
I know to the contrary ; but the misfor- 
tune is that I am in want of an imme- 
diate supply of cash. What sum can you 
afford to pay down ?" 
" Why, Sir," pursing up his mouth 
and looking* very grave, u money is rather 
a scarce article at the present time, and 
trade is dull." 
" If so," said Domville, hastily taking 
up the manuscript, I see we cannot agree. 
I wish you a good morning, Sir." 
Though practice had not made him ex- 
pert in striking bargains, this straight for- 
ward way of dealing was well calculated 
to elicit the highest offer from the intended 
purchaser. 
" Stay, Sir, I beseech you  Since you

set your face against any other way, I 
must submit. Well then, Sir, if so, Sir, 
suppose I venture to offer you the sum of 
twenty pounds for these few poems." 
" Twenty pounds/' cried the seller in- 
dignantly, u they are surely worth much 
more than double that paltry sum." 
" indeed, Sir, I cannot afford you 
more."

" Then, Sir, we cannot agree. Yet I 
am willing to bid as high as thirty." 
" No, Sir, thirty j pounds and fifteen

more to boot will not purchase them. 
Adieu, Sir." 
The bookseller ceremoniously con- 
ducted the book writer to the outer door, 
but, as he forbore offering a higher price, 
the other departed with wide hasty strides, 
and a certain bustling manner, denoting 
discontent and wounded pride. Many 
more and deeper wounds were to be in- 
flicted on that pride of his ere the day 
closed. Most publishers, to whom our 
author was a stranger, declined the pur- 
chase at any price. The highest sum 
offered amounted to only five pounds; 
even then, fears were expressed of its turn- 
ing out a losing concern. 
Strange, thought he, in the midst of 
his vexation, strange that the first ap- 
plied to^ and he a close griping rascal, is

beyond all proportion the most liberal in 
his offers. 
The second interview he had with this 
man accounted upon rational grounds for 
the yet unaccountable generosity of his 
conduct. Domville slowly retraced his 
steps to the shop, crest fallen, and not 
without some apprehension of a lower 
price being now tendered : his fears were 
well grounded. He had, he said, just con- 
cluded a bargain with an eminent writer 
to a considerable amount, and repeating 
his usual cant about money being scarce, 
trade slack, and so forth, he could not, 
so circumstanced, afford so much as thirty 
pounds, but twenty were at his service, if 
that would suit. 
"Well, Sir, I dislike higgling; let me 
have that sum, and the papers are yonrs. ,, 
" Oh, yes, Sir, certainly, this minute.

But before we finally conclude, we'll 
agree, if you please, on the title-page." 
" The title-page is already made 
out. Look here  THE POETICAL 
WREATH, being Selections from the 
Port-Folio of Four * * * *.  You will 
not wish to alter that, surely." 
" With your permission, I conceive a 
material improvement could be made." 
As how?" 
" Instead of the four stars you must 
permit me to insert your name and title at 
full length." 
" As to that, Sir, I will by no means 
agree. My wish for the present is not to 
be known as the author." 
" Then, Sir, you must excuse me. If 
you are positive on that head; I am com- 
pelled to decline the purchase." 
" Suppose you insert my initials, CD,

or even H. C. N. D. will not that answer 
your purpose ?" 
" Oh, Sir, that device will be deemed 
a mere trick, long exploded. I consider 
your name distinctly mentioned, as indis- 
pensible for the sale of the work." 
" Why, the intrinsic merit of the per- 
formance, I should think, would prove the 
best recommendation. " 
"Oh, by no means; the name is every 
thing in these matters." 
" Well, then, be it so.  Now for the 
cash, if you please." 
" We will also add Son to the late Vis- 
count of that name" 
" Why, in the name of justice, should the 
ashes of my father, who, God knows, never 
wrote a line in his life, be made answer- 
able for the poetical sins of his descendant."

Still, sir, you must allow me in these 
matters of trade to be the best judge." 
" Well, then, I see I must comply.  
Now nothing remains but

and Brother to tlie present Earl. " 
"No, by heaven !  Never will I submit, 
on any account, to such a degradation.  It 
will look as if I thought the sanction of his 
name a needful passport to the public favor. 
No, not one word more on the subject, or 
we part for ever." 
Here our Poet, whose acute feelings 
had been much irritated bv many a rough 
tongue in the course of his search, deeming 
this a proper vent for their utterance, 
pranced, stamped, stormed and raged about 
the room, as if he felt a score of needles 
piercing his skin. The publisher, however, 
contrived to pacify him, by agreeing to

wave the insertion of the offensive clause, 
and by paying down the twenty pounds. 
The transfer being made in due form, 
Domville returned home, still evincing his 
discontent in muttering fits: yet, after all, 
not a little pleased with having, by means 
of the purchase money, so materially re- 
cruited his finances.

A REMITTANCE. 
O^ the appearance of this elegant trifle, 
elegant as paper, type, hotpress and 
vignettes could make it, it soon became 
manifest that the publisher was right in 
his prognostics. It really had a rapid sale; 
three editions having gone off in less than 
three months. The chief, and perhaps 
only cause, may fairly be attributable to Mr. 
Margin's amendment in the title page. 
Even the censuring strictures of the 
Reviews, however judicious, by diffusing 
its fame, gave their helps to the product.

Although the author's profit remained at 
twenty pounds, the next supply of verses he 
brought to market reaped the benefit due to 
their elders : the bookseller, conceiving 
himself fully warranted by prudence to 
advance a no less sum than one hundred 
pounds for the copy-right. The tables 
were now turned in favour of our Poet : in 
as much as many of those, who with a super- 
cilious air averted their faces from the 
tendered copy of his first production, now 
courted the honour, as they termed it, of 
becoming his publishers ; but Domville 
remained steady to his old friend. It were 
also to be wished that he had remained 
steady to his much better friend, namely, 
the practice of ceconomy he had so wisely 
adopted in his more penurious state. But 
misfortune had not dwelt with him long 
enough, completely to chasten and establish

his principles. The public applause and 
the profit it produced him were gleams of 
sun-shine, that had only the effect of relax- 
ing his stoicism and expanding his heart 
for the indulgence of expensive amuse- 
ments : the natural result was that he 
devoted less time to his studies. First he 
slackened, then entirely remitted the 
exertions, necessary for the production of 
other and better works. So that, when the 
scantiness of his finances compelled him 
again to make some fresh attempt, he was at 
a stand  found himself out of tune,  was 
not in the humour,  could not, for the soul 
of him, proceed  and, satisfying himself 
that inspiration is at no man's call, left his 
study in the pursuit of some undetermined 
object. 
Luckily for his precarious situation, a 
supply arrived from a certain quarter he

certainly did expect to hear from; but the 
amount remitted was considerably less than 
the sum he expected to receive.  To tell 
the truth, this expectation was probably the 
principal cause, perhaps unknown to him- 
self, of his present supineness. 
We'll first see how this turns out, ere 
we submit ourselves to the drudgery of 
application, is the mode of proceeding 
adopted by the greater number of ex- 
pectants. 
In relating the opulent period of Mr. 
Domville's life, we slightly mentioned a 
generous act of his, which really deserved 
the approbation of the humane and con- 
siderate. We allude to the two thousand 
pounds he presented to the nephew of the 
testator, as some indemnification for the 
disposal to his detriment of a property, 
the greater part of which, as heir at law,

he naturally considered himself entitled to. 
This man had a large family and was then 
in no very prosperous circumstances. 
The sum remitted proved so powerful an 
assistant that, by judiciously laying it out, 
he was rapidly becoming a wealthy mer- 
chant. 
Our Hero one morning, among other 
projects that passed through his mind, 
determined on applying to him for a re- 
turn of at least part of his liberal remit- 
tance, alledging with equal truth and 
justice that, as the law's decision had com- 
pelled him to refund every shilling of (he 
bequeathed property, the two thousand 
pounds received from him were out of hw 
own separate purse; he therefore fully 
relied that now, when their circumstances 
were reversed, he should meet from Mr.

Sandhurst with the same liberality Mr. 
Sandhurst had experienced from him. 
In a double letter, post paid, the answer 
ran thus : 
" Honoured SIR, 
" Duly received yours of the 20th ult. Cannot say 
as to the matter contained therein,  Enclose a fifty 
pound Bank of England Note.  Hope it will prove ser- 
viceable.  Wish to hear it came safe to hand. 
" Remain, honoured Sir, 
" Yours, &c 
" PETER SANDHURST." 
So nearly destitute was Domville of cash 
that, had he been called upon at that time 
for the payment of some trifling debts, 
he would have remained quite pennyless; 
yet so high did he suffer his expectations to 
soar, that he had made sure the letter 
contained an order for the payment of 
500 at least. No wonder then that he

MAZES OF LIFE. 173 
stared with a contemptuous astonishment 
threatening rejectionat, a paper, represent- 
ing* a sum of ten times less value. 
In his first paroxism of indignation, 
down into the fire he filing both letter 
and its contents: luckily, although a chilly 
morning, no fire glowed within ; his 
knowledge of that circumstance was per- 
haps the cause of their being consigned 
to that quarter. The delusion we prac- 
tise on others we often extend to ourselves. 
He then threw himself on a seat oppo- 
site, both his feet stuck on the bars, his 
elbows resting upon his thighs, his open 
palms supporting his head, and with a 
vacant stare kept his eye fixed on the 
objects of his wrath : when, struck with 
a sudden thought, he arose, snatched up the 
papers, and pacing the room with rapid

strides, cried out with rageful exulta- 
tion : 
" Yes, I will make the rascal feel for bis 
niggardly ingratitude. I will straight re- 
turn his shabby fifty pounds ; it shall be done 
in a blank sheet too. It were a dishonour 
for me to hold henceforth the slightest 
communion with so despicable a wretch. ,, 
And, chuckling at his own silly con- 
ceit, he selected a folio sheet of the am- 
plest dimensions, carefully depositing with- 
in its folds both the offensive note and 
letter ; and on the cover, affixed the im- 
pression of a large seal in three thick 
layers of molten wax. 
The direction being written out, he rung 
the bell for the errand-boy to deposit the 
packet in the post-office. Fortunately 
the lad not being then within call, our 
fiery gentleman had time to cool. The

tamer, Poverty, soon brought him down 
from his lofty flight, he was easily per- 
suaded to concede that a recovery of part 
of his property was better than none, and 
that a receipt of fifty pounds by a person 
in his pennyless state, was a windfall of 
no daily occurence. The consequence is 
easily guessed. The seals were broken 
open before they were quite cold  the 
wrapper unfolded  the bank note care- 
fully taken thereout  and the affront quietly 
pocketed.

list of our Poet's friends. 
Lady Eizabeth Wells was not yet, 
strictly speaking", a demirep, but the re- 
petition of the same acts, a little more 
glaring", would not fail to earn for her 
that honourable appellation. Domville 
had known her in the purer period of her

repute : she even then hinted to him her 
no very great dislike to a matrimonial 
connexion in terms as plain as decency, 
in its laxest mood, would allow ; yet he 
had been some how dull of comprehen- 
sion. The fair one since thought it was 
high time her fame should acquire the 
protection of a creditable husband against 
the daily inroads of the malignant, and 
she naturally concluded that, though she 
was sunk lower in the public estimation, 
her former favourite had sunk still lower 
in pecuniary qualifications; so that the 
chances of matrimony were more than 
ever in her favour. Her former ardour 
rekindled at the blaze of his fame ; his 
address she contrived to learn by an in- 
quiry at his Publisher's. An invitation to 
dinner on Tuesday next, at half past five,

was the consequence of the information 
gained. 
In gallant terms and not without a 
shrewd guess at her motive, he accepted 
the invitation, and was punctual to a mi- 
nute : she no less punctual in receiving 
him, dressed out in ail the charms raan- 
tua-makers, milliners, jewellers, her maid's 
and her own well practised skill, could 
bestow on her person. The interview 
passed away to the tolerable gratification 
of both ; something was done and no- 
thing concluded : more interviews suc- 
ceeded. The gentleman was profuse in 
gallant flowery speeches ; the lady w 7 ou!d 
have preferred something more substantial. 
In proportion as his shyness made him 
recede for fear of committing himself too 
far, the bolder her advances to bring the 
negociation to a conclusion, fully convinced

that, if a wedding was to take place, to 
the altar she must lead instead of being 
led. 
To bring about the desired event, her 
matchless female art did not desert her. 
The violation of the strict rules of pro- 
priety was ascribed to her excessive fond- 
ness of him, to a wish nearest her heart 
of seeing the object of her affections happy 
and in affluent circumstances. She loved 
him for his own sake ; and and and.  
In short, she carried the romantic warmth 
of her expressions to such an extreme, as 
if she had been conning over for the oc- 
casion " La Carte du Tendre" 
The gentleman was certainly not taken 
by surprise; yet, although prepared for 
the attack, we can not say that his 
defence was conducted with much skilful

effrontery. Instead of carrying 1 it on and 
himself off with evasive, rapturous speeches, 
he hemmed and stammered, and knew not 
what to say  looked very foolish, rallied a 
little, then slackened again, returned cold 
thanks, requested time to consider, promised 
an answer tomorrow  and arose to depart. 
The lady, with her face dressed in 
smiles of ineffable tenderness, felt the cho- 
ler rising" in her throat.  " Well, till then, 
my love,'' she said in sweetest tones of en- 
dearment. " Adieu, Madam,' at first re- 
plied the solemn blunderer ; but correcting 
himself, cried out in a gayer tone, " Fare- 
well, my dear, dear lady Elizabeth,"  
and smiling waving his hand, departed. 
The next morning, ere he began dress- 
ing himself, he had determined upon break- 
ing up the intimacy, lest it should at 
length lead to the conclusion desired by

the lady and dreaded by the gentleman. 
He considered that his youth, his talents, 
his connexions, afforded him many chances 
of bettering his fortune ; besides his affec- 
tions were but very slightly involved in 
the intercourse and his principles fully 
against it; and when the figure of his 
adorable Julie 9 as he fondly called the fair 
stranger of the Glen, recurred to his mind, 
her ladyship appeared so completely des- 
titute of every female attraction, that he 
felt no difficulty in penning the following 
letter; yet he with-held it in hopes that his 
silence would sufficiently intimate his in- 
tention, but the lady's repeated messages 
leaving him no option, it was at length 
sent.

sentiments the most proper return for the

at my disposal.  The tender of my hand 
alone were an offer unworthy your accept- 
ance. 
" I have the honour to remain, &c." 
This laconic epistle brought down upon 
him her maid of honour. She hurried 
in, woe and consternation in her face, and 
the usual exclamations on such occasions 
burst forth. 
" Good God, Sir ! what have you done ? 
Sir, you have killed my lady. She has 
been in fits and swoonings ever since.  
She knows not of my coming here. In- 
deed, poor thing, she is gone past her 
senses. I beseech you, Sir, return 
with me  The doctor is now with her: 
but you alone can restore her." 
Domville was not such a coxcomb as 
to believe that any woman, still less lady

he was persuaded to accede to the request, 
deeming* probably that, as the story re- 
quired confirmation, it was most fitting 
he of all others should ascertain the fact. 
On their wa} r , he now and then cross-exa-

far failed, as his suspicions were neither

known, female, voice in the most im passion-

" And will you leave me so soon. Then

A smacking buss was now given, fervent 
as that which St. Francis beheld bestowed 
and returned in some recess, when the 
good Saint, in the innocence of his heart, 
lifted up his hands to heaven, thanking 
God that so much Christian charity was 
still left in the world. 
A gentleman now came out, the door 
closed again ; and they stood before each 
other face to face. 
11 Well, Doctor," cried the one sneeringly, 
" how fares the lady." 
" The lady, Sir, is well enough, that I 
can tell you, although no doctor." 
The sound of the voice helped Domville

to a recognition of the features which his 
sight failed to trace, as the thick crimson 
curtains darkened the light from the 
window. Here exclamations like those in 
the skreen scene in the School for Scandal 
burst forth. 
" Sir Henry Offham, by all that is 
wonderful!"

is welcome!" 
"Hush, Offham, Hush, you speak too 
loud, recollect that lady Elizabeth is 
dangerously ill  is dying." 
" Who told you such a story ? She was 
never better in her life; that I can tell yon ; 
and will undertake to prove immediately. " 
And with the air of a master he tried to 
re-open the door, but it was made secure ;  
he then rapped gently at first, but after- 
wards louder and louder, crving out:

" Let ns in, my dear lady Wells :  it is 
only Mr. Domville, a particular old friend 
of mine." 
But aware of the explanation that must 
ensue, her ladyship very wisely, having 
made sure her outer bulwark, retired, 
cursing her unlucky stars, into her boudoir, 
which we may well term a lady's citadel. 
The noisy baronet fancying himself 
slighted, would have created a further 
disturbance, but Domville besought his 
attention and related the occasion of his 
visit ; the other in return was to the full 
as communicative, when after all, it only 
appeared that the lady wanted two strings 
to her bow. Sir Harry who had the 
happy disposition of viewing every thing 
on the laughable side, unheeding his share 
in the transaction, gave way to loud 
bursts of merriment.

In the midst of his glee, a servant stepped 
up, announcing' the doctor's arrival. 
" Bid him come up, said the baronet, we 
shall have some more sport." 
Here a pause of expectation ensued, 
whilst the limb of the faculty, with be- 
coming gravity, ascended towards them, 
step by step, in measured succession. He 
was received most ceremoniously on the 
landing place, and was equally ceremoni- 
ous in his greetings. 
" Ah Doctor, said the baronet, length- 
ening out his face to the utmost stretch of 
a woeful aspect,  the lady,  she is,  it 
shocks me to mention it,  but she is at 
death's door." 
" At death's door !  Good God, sir,

lost. !

But his progress was arrested by the bolt 
within. 
t( My good sir, we cannot enter :  she 
is not yet in a state to receive company. 
It is a most lamentable case, but in the 
mean time I'll submit to your considera- 
tion every symptom of her disorder." 
Although this exordium was not exactly 
consonant with medical phraseology, the 
doctor assumed his usual attitude of intense 
listening, pursed up his mouth, contracted 
his eyebrows, leaned his head on one side, 
whilst the knob of his cane pressed hard 
upon his right cheek. Sir Harry cleared 
his throat, made the usual preparations for 
a learned delivery ; but as grimaces, not 
words were the baronet's forte, he could 
proceed but a little way before his 
ignorance of the subject betrayed him 
into such glaring incongruities, that

solemn gravity of his staring. Sir Harry 
rallied his impudence under the shelter of 
boisterous merriment, which was evinced 
by long and repeated peals of laughter : 
these and the doctor's wrathful seriousness 
also excited Mr. Domville's risible 
faculties; whilst the medical gentleman, 
with increased astonishment, stared at one 
and then at the other in vain for an ex 
planation. 
" Strange,  very strange, a person of 
my professional consequence to be thus 
treated, It shall not rest here, I promise 
you." 
Our hero now thought proper to check 
his mirth, and partly pacified him by the 
assurance that no disrespect had been in-

tended; it was all owing* to a mistake, 
but, since he was called in, he begged 
leave to tender him his fee : In that view 
was proceeding to open his pocket-book, 
but the merciless baronet interfered, and 
with violent gesticulations and loud pro- 
fessions of liberality, insisted upon his 
having that pleasure himself. Domville 
caught the wink the other gave and had 
the malice to act upon it: for, no soonerwas 
the baronet ready with his tender, than he 
threw himself between the parties, pro* 
tested that on him alone that honour 
devolved, which honor he would not concede 
to any prince on earth. We need not add 
that similar protestations were vociferated 
by sir Henry, when it became his turn to 
advance to the charge. 
This ridiculous debate lasted long

enough to convince the doctor they were 
bantering* him, he broke loose from them 
in such a passion, that when they overtook 
him at the street door and offered to pay 
him in good earnest, he ascribed their offers 
to a continuation of the same sport and 
departed indignant, rageful, threatening 
and unfee'd. 
Lady Elizabeth, who had been an ear 
witness to the greater part of this noisy 
altercation, had now the good sense to con- 
sider her case hopeless with either of her 
former admirers, she in consequence made 
to herself| what amends she could, by 
bestowing on some [needy adventurer her 
hand and fortune. 
Giving my hero full credit for the 
delicacy of his sentiments, I have my doubts 
whether he would have extricated himself

with so much promptitude of decision from 
that dangerous pass, had he not felt his 
resolution, backed as it were, by Mr. Sand- 
hurst's fifty pounds bank note. 
The moral I would deduce from this 
latter observation is, that a good action is 
often beneficial to the Doer, not only in its 
immediate, but in its remote consequences 
also. 
The process of my narrative suggests 
another ethical apophthegm : namely  
as from one vice others spring up, so one 
act of duty is the parent of more. The 
remark is thus illustrated :  
Domville thought it now incumbent on 
him to supply, without loss of time, by his 
own industry the lack of those pecuniary 
helps he could have derived from so impure a 
source. Aware that he had nothing more

MAZES OF LIFE. 193 
to expect from Mr. Sandhurst, and that on 
his pen alone he must henceforth rely for 
food, shelter and raiment, he set about 
another literary production in good earnest, 
and became once more equally economical 
of his time and money.

JjUT the Tempter, who is indefatigable 
for the increase of his proselytes, laid 
another trap for our incautious hero. 
Three month's steady application had 
brought him pretty forward in his literary 
labours, and regular habits were in some 
degree contracted ; when compliments 
were presented to him in a note from 
counsellor Cranbourne, requesting at one 
o'clock, next day, the favor of some con- 
versation with him in his chambers.

Thither the young man went at the 
appointed time, wondering" what could be 
the motive for this singular summons. 
He was shewn into the counsellor's study 
who, after a sort of a circuitous, parading, 
preface, agreeably surprised him with the 
information that he (the counsellor) had it 
in commission from a very highly respect- 
able quarter  (here the learned gentleman 
so reverently bowed his head, that the row 
of curls on the back of his well-powdered 
perriwig could be plainly seen Iri front) 
that he had it in commission, from a very 
highly respectable quarter to pay Mr. 
Domville, for an indefinite space of 
tiina, in quarterly payments, the first 
quarter to be paid in advance, which would 
be now disbursed, the sum of  four hun- 
dred pounds sterling per annum. 
The counsellor was as good as his word :

Amongst law books, law cases and loose 
papers, one hundred pounds worth of bank 
notes were spread upon the table for Ins 
acceptance. Our Hero's fingers titilated 
with impatience to secure the needful, re- 
collecting, we suppose, the old proverb, 
" between the cup and the lip, &c."  
Yet he checked any outward symptom 
and with apparent self command, assum- 
ing an air of proud reserve, inquired, be- 
fore he ventured to accept that sum, to 
whom he was indebted for so liberal a 
favour, and what was in consequence re- 
quired of him. 
Counsellor Cranbourne assured him that 
the only act required was his acceptance 
of the annuity ; but as to his Principal in 
the transaction (here he assumed an air 
of state mystery) he begged not to be

further pressed on that head, as he was 
bound in honour to secrecy. 
No sacrifice of principle or of honour 
being demanded, Domville felt little re- 
luctance in accepting- the obligation ; he 
without further delay took up the notes, 
deposited them in their intended receptacle, 
and making a bow of acknowledgement 
was for taking his leave, without even 
thinking of giving a receipt for the same. 
My learned friend, however, with a smile 
besought a longer stay for that purpose. 
In his hand he put a pen, and placed be- 
fore him a ready drawn up receipt, his 
signature only lacking ; it was thus worded. 
Received of Counsellor Nathaniel Cranbourne the 
sum of one hundred pounds, being the first instalment 
out of four hundred pounds, which latter sum the coun 
sellor engages to disburse yearly in equal quarterly 
payments, to the Honourable Charles Nayland Domville

The gentleman was now suffered to de- 
part. With nimble steps and a joyful 
heart he hied him home  to resume his 
lucubrations, it may be supposed.  Oh no, 
his nerves were too much hurried for that 
purpose  but to count his treasure over 
and over again, secure the major part, 
with the remainder of Mr. Sandhurst's 
fifty, and then to dress, to dinner, to wine, 
to the opera, and what not. During the 
pauses of these enjoyments he tried, and 
with success, to trace up the gift to the 
real giver. His first and last conjecture 
rested on his brother. 
Here we will endeavour to account 
rationally, that is to say politically, for 
the noble Earl shewing thus suddenly 
proofs of kindness, after years of total 
neglect, if not of active hostility.

hiin once more to the notice of the higher 
classes. His proud aHd well kept determi-

private wrongs, now that he had obtained 
celebrity in another way, was deemed noble

to inquire after him. It was besides hardly 
possible for the most indifferent not to cry 
shame on a nobleman of such powerful and 
extensive influence, for suffering his own 
brother to sink into a mere pamphlet wri- 
ter, to become a bookseller's hack, as the 
phrase is, in order to gain a scanty and 
precarious livelihood, whilst he wallowed 
in riches ; and this unnatural desertion ow-

all events, in some way or another, his 
Majesty's Government will be strengthened

These insinuations had the effect of 
sinking" the young* man in the public esti- 
mation. Some deemed it a meanness to 
accept any pecuniary favor after such stu- 
died insults and neglect : they, forsooth, 
would rather starve a thousand times over 
than submit themselves to such a desrada- 
tion. Others judging (we suppose from 
themselves) that the acceptance would 
close follow the offer, accused him rather 
too hastily of political apostacy ; whilst the 
majority seeing their client provided for 
in some sort, and not stopping to enquire 
further, held their peace and were satisfied. 
In order to silence such inuendoes, Mr. 
Domviile transmitted the following letter

to the Editor of the Morning Chronicle for 
insertion. 
Sir, 
" I have a right to complain of the injustice many 
persons have done and are doing me, by their ready 
credulity in adopting, without inquiry, the unfounded 
aspersions of my enemies. To all such I beg leave to 
say that, they are mistaken who think me capable of 
political apostacy. lam one of those who will not ac- 
cept of any situation, however advantageous, that 
would be the means of checking the freedom of thought 
and action. This averment I make public as the test 
of my political creed. Let my past, and henceforth, let 
my future conduct be tried by that rule. " 
Surely, the honorable writer of this letter 
must have forgotten upon what slight cause 
he forsook his former political friends and 
sided with their opponents. After all it 
was hardly worth while to notice such an 
every day's occurrence. The slight buzz 
this affair created was soon silenced, it

shared the fate of many more of equal im- 
portance that daily rise and sink, pro- 
duced by the numerous clashing interests 
of this busy, feverish, race.

A JOURNEY. 
ABOUT this time, his friend and former 
correspondent, Mr. Langley, surprised him 
with an agreeable and unexpected visit. 
This gentleman had been for some time 
absent, as envoy to one of the German 
courts. During their conversation, he 
invited our hero to accompany him to 
Florence, whi her he was about to be dis- 
patched in a diplomatic capacity. The 
ofler would have been accepted, had he

MAZES OF LIFE. 205 
not had at that time much at heart a travel- 
ling project, which he soon after put in ex- 
ecution. He, therefore, could only thank 
his friend for his kind offer, promising, 
however, to accept it, should another op- 
portunity occur. 
Domville thought, and in our opinion 
very justly, that before we venture abroad 
to view foreign countries, a personal sur- 
vey of our own should be first undertaken. 
With that intent he took a seat in a stage- 
coach travelling to the North. A motive 
dear to a sentimental tourist induced him 
to prefer that direction. He wished after 
the lapse of so many years to revisit the 
place, not exactly of his birth, but where 
he had been nursed and breeched into boy- 
hood. He still retained some very endear- 
ing recollections of his mother, and of the 
friendly woman who had nursed him in

sickness and cheered him in health. 
There was besides in his heart an attachment 
to the particular scenes of bis youthful 
sports, and to well remembered objects, 
in the proximity of which, the dawn of 
reason, by some more lucid conception, 
had given him the first intimation of his 
being a rational creature. 
This place, the original seat of the 
family, contained its burial vault. Thither 
the day after his arrival he repaired  ap- 
proached with filial piety and awe the 
tomb of his parents ; but he chiefly and 
instinctively turned to the spot where his 
mother was laid : the sight affected him 
even to tears. She had been an indulgent 
yet considerate parent; she loved him as 
her son, and he felt within him that re- 
verential gratitude, a sure indication that, 
had she been living, her chief source of

MAZES OF LIFE. 207 
felicity would have been derived from the 
impulses of his filial heart. Of his father's 
memory he retained fewer sentiments of 
tender regard: as the partialities of na- 
ture has been faint in the parent, the at- 
tachment returned could not be very 
fervid. 
To the habitation of his old nurse he 
next repaired, directed by the well re- 
membered foot-way. She was yet alive, 
but memory had lost its seat ; age had 
brought on a second childhood; yet, even 
in that helpless state, by the placid resig- 
nation of her countenance, by the expres- 
sions that fell from her lips, and by many 
other tokens, could be traced the former 
worth of that friendly creature ; that worth 
was also well remembered by those on 
whom it had been chiefly bestowed. All 
about her was neat and clean: The high

backed chair in the chimney corner, her 
prescriptive right, the waywardness of age 
allowed, and all its calls attended to. She 
had reared np her family to moral and 
industrious habits, and the debt was amply 
repaid by the daily soothings of those filial 
attentions which they, in their turn, might 
reasonably expect from their children.  
Thus beneficial to all is the interchange of 
nature's kindly offices : unlike the traders 
of a bartering world, there are no losers in 
the transaction. 
He had also the pleasure of meeting with 
some of his playmates, now grown up to 
man's estate. He did not give them a few 
hasty greetings and depart, he tarried with 
them, listened with interest to their 
domestic concerns, and felt a pleasure in 
their pride at his enquiries. The sundry 
helps his discernment justified, afforded him

delight at the moment he bestowed them, 
and the remembrance proved a solace to his 
heart, in the hours of depression and ad- 
versity. It is gratifying to experience 
how bland and genial it is to one's feelings 
even the delineation of this very slight and 
imperfect sketch. The boisterous and angry 
scene that is to follow, although the execu- 
tion of it, so as to produce effect, requires 
humour and elaborate skill, afforded the 
author much less satisfaction in the com- 
position.

A NOCTURNAL EXHIBITION. 
AFTER the expiration of a few days' 
he found himself towards evening", the 
sixth well squeezed individual, stowed with- 
in a heavy stage coach journeying north- 
wards. If peace and concord dwelt with 
the families he had lately visited, within 
this vehicle, anger, spite and brawling, in 
most discordant notes had raged, and were 
now on the point of bursting forth afresh. 
Never perhaps did the freaks of chance

collect together a more heterogeneous 
crew. 
From out of one of the back corners 
projected the dark, lengthy, rawboned 
figure of a French Esprit fort who, how- 
ever incredulous in other respects, had 
without much investigation taken for 
granted that, within the celluece of his 
skull, resided a very considerable portion 
of the reasoning faculty allowed to the 
human intellect, The other angle was 
tenanted by a squat, chubby, methodist 
Parson, who found his present call a snug 
wav of working out comforts for his body 
in this world and salvation for his soul 
in the next. The space occupied by those 
gentlemen allowed rather too narrow a 
space for the embonpoint of a Lady, more 
bulky than beseems the fair, who indeed 
protested and declared that, within the

whole range of her experience, she had 
never been so squeezed before. The esti- 
mate she had formed of her acquirements 
fell very little short of the standard of per- 
fection at which the Frenchman rated his 
own : her pretensions rested chiefly upon 
the strength of her having read every novel 
of late appearance, by means of which, 
she fancied herself conversant in matters 
of high life and of fashionable impor- 
tance. 
The opposite side of the carriage held a

vocations will prove.

was returning 1 to resume his periodical 
rounds, his feet in the possession of a new 
step, then in the rage of fashion; and last 
and least, our unassuming Hero who, never- 
theless, as a poet , cannot be supposed to 
lack any of the essentials of that quality, 
which so powerfully bolstered up the self 
importance of the other five. 
The whole crew may well be termed 
a set of Idlers, who consume the good things 
of this world and produce nothing in re- 
turn. We venture upon this remark, be- 
cause it is not likely that any political eco- 
nomist would waste his precious time in 
the perusal of these trifling pages ; else we 
might be told or reminded, that a society 
is always well constituted, when the num- 
ber of consumers is adequate for a con- 
sumption of produce, that affords a remu- 
nerating price to the growers : ergo, no

invidious epithet can attach to any of the 
members that perform their part in the 
machinery of the social frame. 
If we were modestly to intimate that the 
remark is made in a moral point of view 
only, we should be thus silenced. " Mora-

The three first inside passengers had been 
the lady, the painter and the dancing" mas- 
ter. The knight of the brush tried to en- 
gage the lady's attention by such gallant 
speeches as his memory supplied him with, 
but his rival's fluency of delivery and per- 
haps, personal appearance, had obviously 
obtained for him the greater portion of the 
fair one's smiles. When the coach stopped 
to give the horses water, the two gentle- 
men tempted by the fineness of the sky, 
stormed at the same time the coachman's

seat in order to ride outside. There was 
choice of room upon the imperiel, but both 
ambitioned the honour of sitting with the 
driver. After some altercation, to him re- 
ference was made : the adjudication was 
again in favour of the son of Terpsichore : 
the decision was probably influenced by 
sundry indications which gentlemen of the 
long whip seldom fail to notice ; namely, 
the one appeared much more free with 
his cash than the other. For these two 
very slight causes, our sketching tourist 
had suffered himself to be miserable for so 
many hours. 
A heavy storm coming on, compelled 
them both to take she-ter inside, but in the 
interval their vacant seats had been occu- 
pied by the Parisian and the Parson. The 
appearance of these checked the propensity 
of the irritated gentleman to endeavour a

retaliation on his opponent for both his 
repulses; and the mighty feud which soon 
after broke out between the new comers, 
hushed every suggestion of his spleen. 
As the tootling of a flute is silenced amidst 
the loud blasts of a couple of trumpets.

This reply was sufficiently incensing, it 
received a further aggravation from the 
lady's applauding burst of laughter, who 
protested that, within the precincts of her 
intercourse with the world, she had seldom 
hea'rd any thing so smart, so witty  
and so truly original. 
The parson collected all his powers for a 
thundering reply, but the pouring out of 
of the phial of his wrath was/for the 
present, checked by the stopping of the 
coach for the admission of our Hero.

occasional growls of discontent, looks of 
hostility and other tokens of defiance 
threatened a renewal of the storm. All 
these were evident symptoms that they had 
not well digested the matter and manner of 
the late altercation. 
An innocent question of the lady to the 
Parisian, like Doctor Franklin's conductor, 
directed on which topic the conflicting 
elements should now rage.

vented his disapprobation and exhausted 
his spleen by merely crying* out  Damn 
Tom Paine and the French Philosophers. 
But our P^eligionist adopted expres- 
sions in his opinion more warrantable, be- 
cause more consonant with scriptural phra- 
seology, although, perhaps, not so conform- 
able to the mild spirit of Christian charity, 
by which he consigned them all to the same 
implied quarter, not forgetting far famed 
Voltaire in the sweeping condemnation. 
This wounded the Frenchman in the 
tenderest part ; because to his friend Vol- 
taire he allowed a superiority of intellect 
above every other human being, himself 
not excluded. He gabbled out a reply, 
which rage, bad English, and an admix- 
ture of French, made nearly unintellgible. 
Sufficient however was made out to 
provoke a retort from his wrathful

opponent, and on they proceeded in a 
louder key and with increased vehemence 
of manner and invective, when a respite 
was given to their lungs by the final stop- 
ing of the carriage for the day. 
As soon as the coach door was open, 
Domville glad of a release, jumped out; 
the painter and dancing-master followed 
him and made for the house, so did the 
parson.

into the apartment allotted to them. The 
Company sat for some time looking at each 
other in a sort of stupid, sulky, silence. 
" Well, Madam, how did you like the

said Domville, wishing" to elicit something 
worthy of note from his companions.

consciousness of having elicited, in rapid 
succession, a deep philosophical thought 
and delivered a compliment quite original,  
the conversation proceeded. 
" For my own part, resumed Domville, 
a country is always interesting to me, on 
the face of which the promise of abundant

crops denotes industry and a right mode of

" True, Sir, and I may be permitted 
to add, that it never occurred otherwise to 
me, within the whole compass of my know- 
ledge." 
" But yet you catch nothing grand, 
nothing striking  all too monotonous  too 
sleek, for either pencil or brush. North 
Wales for the picturesque.' ' 
" Poh," cried the dancing-master, pleas- 
ed with his own conception of a truism. 
" I prefer good living in a valley to starv- 
ing on a mountain." 
" You talk of mountains and Nort

But the entrance of supper restored the 
equilibrium of peace, likely to be again 
disturbed by a further prosecution of the 
dialogue. 
The lady of course was placed at the upper 
end of the table, the dancing-master 
figured at the bottom, the others occupied 
the sides; the two former disputants, pos- 
sitively and figuratively stationed them- 
selves opposite each other : but however 
inveterate their hostility, the calls of hun- 
ger most effectually produced a cessasioa 
for the time being. The contention seemed 
now which should devour the greater por-

tion of food ; even in this respsct their 
national characteristics were apparent. 
Had the wager been confined to a short 
space of time, the dispatehful voracity of 
the Frenchman would have won ; but let 
them grind and masticate till one is com* 
pelled to give over, we rather think that 
the quantity destroyed by him of England 
would have established his pretensions to 
his being the better man. Even Mon- 
sieur le Philosophe was amazed at the 
potentiality of his antagonist in convey- 
ing into his mouth, and dispatching pieces 
of meat of enormous dimensions. 
" Ah, comme il avale, /" cried he, giving 
almost at the same time a practical illus- 
tration of the feat, by one of equal mag- 
nitude. 
The supper ended, a short pause suc-

ceeded ; during which every one was left 
to his own thoughts and digestion. 
Whenever Domville had put up at an 
inn for the night, by a strange perversion 
of taste, not however more peculiar to 
himself than to his historian, he repined 
at the order and regularity that in these 
modern times, so much to one's comfort, 
pervade every department ; in as much as 
ihey prevent the possible occurrence of 
Adventures, such as we read in our earlier 
novel writers. He much wished to witness 
similar ones, were it at some inconveni- 
ence and even risk to himself. Casting a 
glance at the company, he fancied they 
were fit materials (other causes concur- 
ring) for the production of some droll 
incident. 
In that frame of mind, a waiter informed
## p. 227 (#241) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 227 
hm that his master, as a particular favour, 
requested to speak with him. This leads 
me to state the predicament in which mine 
host of the Red Bull is placed at the pre- 
sent juncture. 
The inn in his occupation stood at the 
edge, of an extensive heath close by the 
road side, being what is termed a half- 
way-honse. Owing 1 to an increase of cus- 
tom, it had been deemed a good specu- 
lation to pull down the old, inconvenient, 
building, and to erect a new one on the 
same scite. The arrival of the present 
passengers happened when the greater part 
of the new erection was completed, and 
only three rooms, great and small, of the 
old remained fit for use. Now, all the 
modern sleeping apartments had been put 
into requisition by a sudden and unex- 
pected influx of Carriage Company, whose

bearing promised to afford much larger 
profits, than what was likely to be gathered 
from the purses of the stage coach passen- 
gers. He therefore wanted to gain 
the ear and, through that medium, the 
favour of one of those whom he intended 
to consign to the back settlements, in order 
that it might be intimated to the remain- 
der in terms, likely to win their compli- 
ance. Our Victualer proved himself a 
skilful Phisiognomist, by pitching upon 
our Hero for his negociator in this delicate 
emergency. 
Requesting a sight of the apartments, 
he followed the landlord through the pas- 
sage that led to the old building : it was 
almost a hopeless case. Only one apart- 
ment and two beds for four sleepers, a 
small closet for the lady, and one of equal 
dimensions tendered for his own separate

use, the acceptance of this bribe he, how- 
ever, had his reasons for declining; yet he 
readily agreed to befriend the publican, 
as there appeared a chance of bringing 
about, in some shape, the event he so ardently 
wished. 
Furnished with this information, he re- 
turned to his company, but delayed a dis- 
closure till symptoms of drowsiness inti- 
mated a speedy call for the chamber- 
maid ; our Contriver then availed himself 
of the temporary absence of the oppugners 
to impart, in conciliatory terms, what kind 
of accommodation awaited them for the 
night, exonerating, as weil as he could, 
the landlord from all blame. The lady 
was induced with sou.e difficulty to 
occupy the closet, although she averred 
that, within the whole scope of her life's 
transactions, she was never before reduced

to such a situation ; and the two gentle- 
men after sundry grimaces submitted to 
share the same bed; their own dislike, 
however, considerably reduced in expec- 
tation of witnessing" a greater dislike evinced 
by others. But the main difficulty still 
remained; how was it possible to induce 
the two hostile champions, spite of their 
acrimonious hatred, to lay themselves down, 
side by side, perhaps cheek by jowl, within 
the narrow precincts of one couch, just as 
if they were of the same kidney. 
As he rightly conjectured that no per- 
suasion of language could remove that ob- 
stacle, they were kept ignorant of their 
destination, till all the men were mustered 
in the sleeping room. The two more 
peaceable travellers betook themselves : to 
their own nook and doffed their clothes : 
Bomviile, with the help of some blankets,

his own great coat and his port-mantua for 
a pillow, formed a tolerable place of re- 
pose upon an old sofa, whilst the remaining" 
two stood inactive in astonishment, stared 
about them, then at their companions, then 
at the bed, then at each other, haughtily 
demanding an explanation which was now 
given to them. 
Their reluciance to the proposed 
arrangement was expressed with great 
vehemence of manner and symptoms of 
mutual disgust; they threatened, stamp- 
ed, nay, they both swore that they would 
much rather lie in a ditch than occupy the 
same bed : but there was no other for 
them, no human habitation near, the 
night far gone and most inclement, for it 
rained in torrents. Now our hero adduced 
the best palliative he had in store, alledge- 
ing that the inconvenience could be but of

very short duration, as to-morrow, by four 
in the morning", they must be again on their 
journey. 
What could be done.  No option left.  
The necessity of the case at length bent 
their stubborn wills to acquiesence, but 
with a very ill grace. Grumbling and 
growling, they doffed their clothes, when, 
in the act of depositing their carcases 
within the sheets, a fresh altercation arose ; 
they both strenuously contended for the 
right side of the bed. This point was 
warmly and angrily debated, and nearly 
produced a breach of the peace ; however 
the Parson gained it, upon a reference to 
the company ; he having alleged as being 
the best reason either party adduced for 
the preference, that he was a married man. 
Behold then the lights put out and all 
still around, when the silence was disturbed

by the reverend gentleman's large inflated 
nose, singing a snoring tune in the deepest 
bass, the usual proclamation he generally 
gave out of having enjoyed a hearty 
evening meal. The philosopher, who 
began to feel the pressure of Morpheus 
upon his eyelids, by no means relished, the 
melody of this music, it partook besides too 
much of the nasal twang of psalm singing 
to suit his taste. He was also dissatisfied 
with his share and side of the bed allotted 
him. 
To remedy these inconveniences by one 
contrivance, he ventured to press his knees 
against the distended abdomen of his sleeping 
partner, intending, by continued and increas- 
ing pressure, to shove him by degrees to the 
extremity of the bed ; that point gained, 
a fall on the boards were an easy matter to 
accomplish, by which means he would at

once get rid of the musician and his 
thorough bass. 
This wise manoeuvre was however 
frustrated  Our parson awoke when very 
near the fatal brink. As if by inspiration 
he dived into the enemy's mode of warfare ; 
immediately, like a hedgehog, he collected 
himself into a rotund mass, and, by grasping 
with both hands the sheet and mattrass, 
prevented a further loss of territory. The 
Frenchman perceived the enemy upon the 
alert, yet resolved to persevere, and with 
an appearance of gaiety cried out:  
" Allons, Monsieur le Saint, il faut, 
demenager.  Vite, denichez d'ici.  Oh, 
Parbleu, je vons ferai deguerpir" And 
renewed the attack with greater fierceness. 
The national characteristics of the two 
combatants may again be traced by their 
adoption of a different system of tactics.

The French Hero, still upon the offensive, 
hoped to win the night by sudden jolts or 
jerks against the embodied strength of his 
antagonist. But the English commander, 
having stood his ground against the first 
dreadful shock, quickly occupied the space 
left vacant by the other, who gave way some 
little, in order to renew the attack with 
greater vigour. The same manoeuvres 
were repeated with the same results, till 
the assailant baffled, exhausted, and breath- 
less had been driven, inch by inch, to the 
outer limits of his dominions. It was now 
that our Gideon found his voice  
" Avaunt! Satan, I defy thee and thy 
works." 
This solemn objurgating command, 
backed by a timely and forcible push, 
fairly ejected the Frenchman from the bed,

and down on the boards this bag of bones 
rattled in its fall. 
At that moment, the moon herself 
desirous of witnessing a scene that promised 
such excellent sport, peeped through the 
clouds and curtainless windows, indulging- 
at intervals the spectators with the benefit 
of her nocturnal light. 
The discomfitted son of Belial, not at all 
relishing the effect of this retributive justice 
that subjected him to the very disaster he 
had striven hard to inflict upon another, 
arose furious and seizing his cane, retali- 
ated, without mercy, on the parts exposed 
to its descending fury, in the foulest 
language reproaching the saint with being 
no gentleman, else, instead of the bastinado, 
he would punish him with sword and pistol. 
*' Since thou provokest me, with the

arm of flesh will I fight thee, and the 
Lord have mercy on thy sinful soul.'* 
So saying", he flung" off the clothes, leaped 
out of bed and like a bulldog, flew at the 
throat of his foe, becoming in his turn the 
assailant in good earnest. They met, they 
closed and struck and struggled, and on 
the floor they fell, and rolled, and stamped, 
and kicked, and rose again, and fought 
and wrestled afresh.  The jabbering gib- 
berish of the one, the sonorous intonations 
of the other, were the accompanying 
music to this dreadful affray. 
The Gallic champion, finding himself 
worsted in the engagement, had tried the 
virtue of another set of weapons : his 
nails had traced many a bleeding track on 
the face and even on the more fleshy region 
of the parson's rear. Now, as his last

resource, in order to tear the laurel from 
the Briton's brow, he sought to tear:  
Not a moment had he to lose. Our 
countryman had at length contrived to 
confine him within (he gripe of his sinewy 
arms, (it had the effect of a straight waist- 
coat) and was indulging him with such a 
fraternal hug, as a bear would bestow on a 
monkey,  when, unluckily, by a dexterous 
snap, he felt within the Frenchman's tusky 
grinders his wide proboscis squeezed to the 
flatness of a pancake, and in our opinion 
with strict poetical justice, that organ being 
deservedly punished, as the trumpet that 
gave the signal for battle. In vain did the 
methodist with arms extended and fists 
cenched in dolorous agony, release the 
philosopher from his confinement, evidently 
soliciting by that act a cessation of hostili- 
ties, the Frenchman was by no means

induced to follow his example, be kept a 
tight hold, thus making- his teeth perform 
that tweaking operation, usually assigned 
to the fingers, and seeming to take a pecu- 
liar delight in the roaring notes of distress 
and in the writhing contortions of his 
sensitive foe. 
At this period of the battle, Domville 
almost suffocated with laughter, dreading 
some serious injury, arose and called for 
lights. They were soon at hand, for the 
uproar was summoning to the spot landlord, 
landlady, servants and helpers. They 
beheld, on one side, the philosopher, his 
shirt of late none of the soundest, han<rin" 
down in tatters, front and rear, through 
the gaps of which was exposed his tawny 
hide, hairy as a baboon's; the similitude 
was stiil more striking from the grins, 
grimaces and antic gestures, which rage

and pa'ii extorted from his limbs and 
features. On the other, our preacher just 
released from the homicidal fangs of a 
graceless infidel, limping about the room, 
roaring out by fits for every pain, one hand 
pressed on the bleeding wounds, the other 
contracted into an enormous fist, threat- 
ening further application on the already 
well-belaboured carcase of his opponent, 
moreover venting his wrath in loud denun- 
ciations, partly religious, partly profane. 
It appeared however evident that the result 
of the fight proved so very unsatisfactory to 
both sides, that neither was inclined to 
sing the Te Deum of victory. 
More adventures occurred, but they are 
such as the chaste muse is unwilling to 
record. The dancing master was some 
how missing.  The curiosity ascribed to 
the fair sex failed to bring out the literary

lady from her closet, were it merely to 
inquire after the occasion of this dreadful 
affray : she probably acquired more than 
an equivalent by her seclusion ; yet she 
subsequently complained that, within the 
whole pale of her conception, she could not 
have been more unpleasantly disturbed. 
The Painter had a full view of the combat 
ants as they were above described ; pant 
ing, discomposed, bruised, excoriated and 
bleeding from the fight. It is to be hoped 
that his pencil will gratify the Town with 
at least a sketch of the scene, in which he 
will have full scope to indulge his love 
for the picturesque. 
The Frenchman had sneaked to his re- 
cess, the landlord could now find another 
bed for the Parson, whither he was led, 
and the landlady prepared a hot plaister 
for the dental wounds inflicted on his nose.

Silence again reigned in the dwelling, and 
those went to sleep that could. 
The next morning when they w 7 ere again 
collected within the vehicle, a sort of 
awkwardness fettered the tongue of each 
inmate. The champions, their heads ban- 
daged and well plaistered, were heartily 
ashamed of the late specimen of their 
prowess, and brooded in silence over the 
past transaction. The others checked 
the rising laugh, humanely aware that 
their mirth would too roughly lacerate the 
feelings of the sufferers ; only when the 
fit was too violent for suppression, they 
would thrust their heads out of the car- 
riage, pretending to look at some object, 
and thus indulge the propensity without a 
witness; in that manner they reached the 
next town : here they all parted, taking 
different directions.

people, and therefore not worth record- 
ing; improved his health, enlarged his 
heart, gained some practical knowledge of 
men and manners, and acquired an acces- 
sion of ideas that would bestow additional 
value on any new work, he should hereafter 
be disposed to treat the Public with. 
The transactions of one night, however, 
we cannot forbear recording : our Hero 
will witness sundry adventures without 
being at any trouble in producing them. 
In one of his rides towards London, the 
only inside companion of his journey was 
a bustling, well fed, middle aged, gentle- 
man, fond of his ease and hearing him- 
self talk, which he did in rather an autho- 
ritative manner : that habit he had so 
much contracted at home, that he could 
not well divest himself of it when abroad. 
On every topic, religious, moral or poli- 
tical, however intricate, he had made up
## p. 245 (#259) ############################################
MAZES OP LIFE. 245 
his mind ; it was so and so ; and those were 
fools or knaves who thought otherwise. 
In his domestic arrangements he fancied 
himself an excellent manager, yet no 
master's commands were disregarded with 
more impunity. His error arose from his 
mistaking boisierousness for decision and 
threats for action, the exertion of the 
lungs being all the exertion he deemed 
requisite ; yet some decision was clearly 
evinced by his imprudence in forming 
new acquaintances, which, during the 
fervor of the novelty, he would call con- 
tracting a friendship. In a short conver- 
sation with a stranger and, fo very slight 
causes, should he then happen to be in the 
humour, he would pronounce him to be a 
d clever, honest, fellow; no every 
day acquaintance.  " Sir, I rate very 
highly both his character and intellect: 
M 3
## p. 246 (#260) ############################################

yet, such a man might pass before a fool 
and not be noticed." 
To prevent therefore himself from rank- 
ing in that class, he would often go much 
further than the cautious policy of the pre- 
sent generation, for reasons best known 
to themselves, deems it at all prudent. 
He proceeded on the warrantry of such 
an inference as this :  Since he felt himself 
so extremely happy in the society of his 
new acquaintance, it was, by all means, his 
interest to cultivate a further intercourse. 1 
i( The gentleman would surely indulge 
him with his company to-day to dinner; 
indeed he must not be denied : it would 
also prove a high treat to Mrs. Westloe 
and daughter.  Come, Sir, let us disre- 
gard ceremony ; fools may entrench them- 
selves behind etiquette, but the discerning 
need no such shelter."
## p. 247 (#261) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 247 
But he who trusted to such glowing- 
protestations would soon find, that the 
sudden fervor of this man's friendship was 
nothing but a straw fire, producing a great 
blaze of short duration, and leaving little 
or no warmth behind. 
Our Traveller happening to utter a re- 
mark that pleased Mr. Westloe, he arouzed 
himself from a dozing propensity that 
was stealing upon him : and they entered 
into conversation, in which the latter bore 
an animated share. 
In the very height of his satisfaction, 
the coach, the slowness of whose progress 
had been a short time before the theme of 
his vituperation, made a stand before a 
genteel looking' house, about a mile dis- 
tant from the town of .The name is 
here purposeiy omitted, in order to prevent 
malignant imputations : although, at times,

we indulge in general satire, we never in- 
tend that our shafts should be aimed against 
individuals. The coachman opening the 
door, asked him whether he would not be 
pleased to alight, as they had now arrived 
before his house. 
" What, already !  'Tis my home sure 
enough.  Now, Sir, (to Domvilie,) take 
your mutton and spend the day with us. 
To-morrow early, a coach starts for town ; 
your obliging us will only occasion the loss 
of half a day." 
The very reflection that would have in- 
duced another person to decline the honour 
was, with our Hero, an inducement to 
accept it. The distant reserve that in 
this country one stranger preserves to- 
wards another, -a'ihough perhaps fully jus- 
tified by prudence, was not suited to his 
generous, unsuspecting, disposition ; he
## p. 249 (#263) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 249 
construed such a reserve into a mean sus- 
picion harboured by those who, judging 
of others by themselves, were for keeping 
any casual acquaintance at arms' length. 
It was obvious however, that the present 
hospitable entertainer, who freely opened 
his door to an accidental fellow-traveller, 
was not of that class, he therefore deserved 
from him a similar return of confidence. 
Desirous of shewing the gentleman that 
his civility was not unworthily bestowed, 
and further encouraged by the respectable 
appearance of the house, he accepted the 
invitation. Both then made for the en- 
trance hall, and in compliance with Mr. 
Westloe's directions, Domville's luggage 
followed. 
When the Owner had introduced his 
guest into a parlour, after a short convex 
sation, he pulled out his watch.

'' Dinner by this time must be ready  
I ordered it to be upon the table at three 
precisely. ,, Here he rung- the bell, but 
as the summons produced no immediate 
attendance, the gentleman had full leisure 
to proceed. < Believe me, Sir, nothing 
like punctuality and regularity in a house. 
Though my friends style me an easy, 
good-natured, fellow, what the French 
call debonnair, at home, I am a Discipli-

By sundry indications our Hero was 
already led to entertain a suspicion that 
there must be some discrepance in the 
assumed and in the real fact, and that to 
use the expression of a corrector of Errata, 
for Disciplinarian read Latitudinarian : the 
sequel proved that his suspicions were 
grounded in truth. 
No servant answering the call, the bell

was applied to with such violence that, at 
last, it compelled the appearance of one, 
" Yon, fellow, why did'nt yon attend 
my first call ?  Yon deserve to be turned 
away for that neglect.  Where was yon ?" 
" Sir, I was up stairs. 5 ' 
" How dare you be any where but in

" I was in attendance upon young- Mis-

" Your attendance on me is what I prin- 
cipally require  Is dinner ready ?" 
" No, Sir, not quite." 
M How is that ? It is now ten minutes 
beyond the time I ordered it." 
" Young Mistress ordered it to be put 
off to four." 
" The Devil she did !  It seems young

will never do.  By the Lord, I will look 
to it and shortly too. Go, Sir, and tell 
Mrs. Westloe that I have a Gentleman to 
dinner here to-day, and that I expect  
but the fellow is sure to commit some blun- 
der. I'll go myself." 
After a slight apology to his guest, 
he departed on that hopeful errand. As- 
cending the stairs towards his wife's apart- 
ment, he determined to prevent the ex- 
pressions of her expected anger for his 
incautious invitation, by a loud inquiry 
respecting the dinner's delay, rightly pre- 
suming that the first blow is half the bat- 
tle : but the gentleman's politics were 
baffled by the lady's similarity of maneu- 
vering. Her officious maid had already 
<riven all the information in his power to 
bestow: thus he met her fully prepared to 
act on the offensive. His wrath was

however somewhat assuaged by his daugh- 
ter's more ardent reception, after ^the ab- 
sence of two days;  a few filial kisses, 
even a hearty shake of the hand, and u I 
am glad to see you back, Pa," was the 
welcome. 
Then, whilst the Master was clearing 
his voice and mustering up resolution for 
the intended attack, thus begun the Mis- 
tress. 
" Mr. Westloe, I'm quite surprised at 
you." 
" At me, Madam ! On what account, 
pray. I rather think I have a light to ex- 
press my astonishment  " 
" How could you, Sir, think of introduc- 
ing here a stranger, a mere coach-passen- 
ger, of whom nobody knows any thing."

seldom mistaken in that particular/* 
" No one more so." 
" I say, Madam, and repeat that my 
notions on that head are unerring." 
" Why, it was but the other day, that 
you took upon yourself to introduce, at your 
card-club, another of your picked up gen- 
tlemen who turned out, after all, to be a 
downright sharper." 
" I desire, Madam  " 
" Bless me, don't bawl out so loud : it 
flurries one so.  The fellow contrived to 
receive his winnings in good bank bills and 
to pay his losses in forged ones." 
" The whole club is a set of shallow 
pated ninnies to have made such a rout 
about it, they only got laughed at for their 
pains, and fhey richly deserved it.  Besides 
the fact was never proved against him." 
" Nay, your new friend proved it him-

self, by absconding with his booty, and 
now we are to entertain another gentleman 
of the same kidney, who, for aught I know, 
may be worse than the first.  Some high- 
wayman, possibly, who may let in his 
confederates to cut our throats, this blessed 
night.  Indeed you have no sort of con- 
sideration for one's nerves ." 
Mr. Westloe replied to his lady's appre- 
hensions by a loud burst of laughter. 
" Liddy, my dear, hand me your salts : 
this boisterousness is unbearable/' the 
further progress of the debate was prevented 
by the young lady's inquiry 
" And pray, Pa, what sort of a personal 
appearance has this incognito of yours ?" 
"Why, Girl, such a personal appearance 
as your spouting captain can't match, with 
all his theatricals."

" One of your old musty politicians, I 
suppose." 
" I don't know what you mean by old 
musty politicians ; this gentleman, how- 
ever, is young and handsome, can talk 
small talk with the ladies, I warrant him, 
and coax their silly hearts to mistake 
tinsel for gold too." 
" Here Mrs, Westloe, who was quite a 
Pessimist, suffered her suspicions to take a 
different direction. 
" So much the worse. The more 
blamable you for subjecting your family 
to the schemes of a fortune hunter." 
But the daughter expressed a different 
opinion ; the information received induced 
her to throw her all efficient weight into 
her father's scale, 
' I protest, Mamma, you are by much
## p. 257 (#271) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 257 
too timorous. I am for venturing' a little; 
} on square prudential folks are not to my 
taste. I like to be now and then a little 
dashing: and eccentric." 
Aye, but remember, Liddy, repentance 
ever follows rashness," 
l * Poh,  you remind me of Miss Philpot, 
who was so afraid that every body would 
run away with her that, at last, she was 
fain to run away with her footman." 
" This timely interference put her father 
in good humour, who pinching her cheek 
and tapping her on the neck, called her 
his dar ing  his own daughter." 
Previous to this, however, Miss Westloe 
in order to ascertain whether she ought to 
honour the stranger with her company, had 
commissioned her maid to obtain a sight of 
the gentleman and to report progress. Jn 
consequence, she was hastily summoned
## p. 258 (#272) ############################################
258 MAZES OF LIFK 
into the back room, where she had a full 
view of their guest, who was then pacing 
up and down the garden walk, her fair self 
concealed behind the window curtain, 
whence she could securely peep. 
Mrs. Westloe, whom a similar motive 
called to the same spot, rather reluctantly 
acknowledged that his person had not 
much the appearance of a cut-throat 
robber., bat added, in order to abate the 
value of the concession, that the more 
favorable the appearance the greater the 
danger; whilst the gentleman taking her 
first declaration as an acknowledgment of 
his discernment, boldly asserted, that he 
would stake all he was worth on the 
respectability of his guest. 
What impression was made on Miss 
Westloe, her next speech will evince. As

they were still scrutinizing Mr. Domville, 
the dinner bell rung. 
" Lord, cried she, dinner time already ! 
Dear Mamma, have the dinner put off a 
little longer,  1 can't think of coming down 
in such a figure" 
Her father, in gratitude for the benefit 
of her assistance, was now for indulging 
her in this wish, although the concession 
militated against the very motive that 
summoned him to the conference room. 
The young lady and her maid hastily 
withdrew ; Mr. Westloe went down to his 
guest, and after a further delay of half an 
hour, a third notification for dinner being 
given, the latter was ushered into the eating 
room, wherein the ladies in becoming cos- 
tume awaited his appearance. The usual 
exchange of bows, courtesies, smiles and 
apologies being made, they sat down to their

meal, the various dishes whereof were 
carved, recommended and discussed, and 
the time passed away agreeably enough. 
On the removal of the cloth, Mr. West- 
loe began to make free with the bottle, 
laid down the law on this and on that 
subject, although several times called to 
order by his lady, who desired him not to 
be so vehement, it shook her nerves so ; for 
the which rebuke he called her a silly, 
timorous creature:  his dear little puss. 
Lydia also chided her mamma, saying, 
she loved to see a gentleman warm,  that 
it became him. Mr. Domville moderately 
pledged his challenger, and contrived to 
entertain the ladies till they withdrew. 
His open hearted Entertainer, now, by 
the influence of wine made more communi- 
cative, entered into family details, which

to illustrate the purpose of the present 
chapter. 
" Sir, allowing* for every drawback,

consider myself, on the whole, a fortunate 
mortal.  To be sure my servants are the

gentleman is worse served thae I am : how-

these days. Now to come nearer home. 
There is this solemn rib of mine : she is 
perpetually annoying me with her prog- 
nostics, her suspicions, her silly tremors : 
it is hard that my strong nerves should be 
discomposed by the weakness of her 
nervous system. But the whole sex are 
become hippish, and even our gentlemen 
are womanized with similar fancies.  They 
also must have their blue devils, forsooth. 
A scrubbing brush into the hands of the 
one, and a spade into the hands of the other, 
would soon drive these devils into smoke. 
Indeed, my good sir, we are degenerating 
very fast : a melancholy consideration this! 
But what was I talking about?"

" Very true,  do you know that she is a 
sedulous reader of the newspapers ; but 
what vexes me most is that the leading 
topics, religion, politics, the national debt, 
debates in parliament, letters from Civis to

luxurious repast ; they have the same 
effect on her trembling nerves, as stories 
of spectres and apparitions had on our 
credulous forefathers. So baneful the 
perusal becomes that, towards evening,

No newspaper shall henceforth enter my 
doors, except for my own private perusal; 
I will most assuredly see to that:  one 
plague will be then removed.  Come, Sir, 
fill your glass.  But then another plague 
starts up.  My Liddy is really a good girl; 
she has a splice of the father in her, yet 
she gave me some uneasiness. Confound 
these theatricals ! They are only traps for 
girls of fortune. Here I am daily pes- 
tered with the visit of a spoutin Captain 
on half pay : I know he has an eye to my 
daughter; I taxed her with it, and 
I positively declared to her, that I set 
my face completely against any connec- 
tion of that nature  that 1 would not hear 
of it, on any account, and there is an end 
on't. However, I should have shewn 
him the outside 01 the door, long ago, but

the fellow, some how, contrives to be 
useful during' these long 1 winter nights : 
a few hits at backgammon are indispen- 
sible to go through them, without dozing" 
away the hours till bed-time; but for all 
that, I am resolved the Captain shall march 
off. " 
He had hardly done speaking, when the 
gay, identical, Man of War made his ap- 
pearance. 
' Ah Captain ! Are you come ? Sit down, 
man, to a glass of wine.  Mr. DomvilJe, 
Captain Baldrick  Captain Baldrick,

However the Wee use of the bottle was 
not allowed to become an orgie, as it was 
too often the case with the master of the 
house. Miss Westloe, on perceiving- from 
her watch-tower, I mean her chamber

window, the entrance of the Captain,

brought into the tea-room, whither the 
gentlemen were summoned, to which sum- 
mons the two younger readily complied; 
but the elder thus disturbed, demurred, 
growled out his dissent, would have tea- 
parties interdicted, and would remain to 
the last true to the bottle; however, find- 
ing himself in a minority, he took a part- 
ing glass and followed the same direc- 
tion, mumbling curses against petticoat 
government, to which he, for one, would 
never submit. 
During the meal, Domville saw enough 
to ascertain the good understanding that 
prevailed between the Captain and Miss 
Westloe ; yet it will soon appear that the 
young lady fancied herself in love only 
H because she was idle*."

The father, in order to make himself 
some amends for his dereliction of the bot- 
tle, challenged the Captain to a hit of 
backgammon ; but the other excused him- 
self, alledging that he had business of im- 
portance to transact that very night, the 
truth of which averment was subse- 
quently established, in a sense quite diffe- 
rent from the meaning he intended to con- 
vey. With this excuse he, without in- 
dulging the company with even one speech in 
the character of Romeo, departed or pre- 
tended to depart. 
Our Hero seeing the old gentleman out 
of humour at his disappointment, good- 
naturely offered to supply his place ; this 
ready offer revived the suspicions of Mrs, 
Westloe, which Domville's gentlemanly 
behaviour had lulled to rest. But the 
young lady who perhaps had her reasons

for wishing' her father stationary at the 
backgammon table, encouraged the amuse- 
ment. When she saw the parties deeply 
engaged in the play, she left the room ; 
her mother however remained to watch 
the stranger. It would have been more 
to the purpose had she watched her daugh- 
ter's steps. 
Hit succeeded hit, without much loss on 
either side, and the lady seeing that the 
dice were not more subservient to her 
guest than to her husband, entered with 
with due composure, upon the perusal 
of the newspaper, then just brought in. 
Its columns this time happened to be 
more than usually prolific in robberies and 
murders ; these tales by ministering to her 
weakness increased her terrors to such a 
degree, that every sudden exclamation 
from her husband's well known voice, a

louder knock with the dice-box on the 
board, made her start and utter ejacula- 
tions of the Lord have mercy on her ! 
Her face appeared to have lengthened out 
from the perusal. 
Fortune had prepared a snug birth for 
this lady, nature intended that she should 
lay down in it, but not make it her con- 
stant abode : she suffered however every 
faculty for exertion to lay dormant. Her 
favourite maid was her agent ; on her de- 
volved every thing that was to be done : 
the mistress in consequence became lan- 
guid and spiritless; her mind partook of 
the weakness of her frame and, having 
no real calamity to contend with, she be- 
came the prey to imaginary ones. It may 
be laid down as a general maxim that, as 
the luxuries of society increase, so do the

mental tortures of those who indulge in 
them to excess. 
It growing late, Mr. Domville arose to 
depart : his entertainer made several at- 
tempts to detain him to supper, even the 
the lady earnestly besought his stay ; for 
entertaining now no longer any dread of the 
stranger, she sought to convert him into 
a protector against those whom her 
fears had magnified into disturbers of her 
peace. 
On opening the house door, it rained 
in torrents, the distance to the Inn was 
considerable, the offer of a bed was ten- 
dered in so hearty, so hospitable a manner 
by both man and wife that, having de- 
livered the usual apologies for the trouble 
it would give and so forth, Mr. Domville 
accepted the offer.
## p. 271 (#285) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 271 
Miss Westloe, however, who returned 
for supper, her face dressed in smiles, 
suffered some of them to evaporate on be- 
ing* informed of this further extension of 
hospitality ; but too well bred to let any 
inward discontent transpire, she acted her 
part becomingly, and whatever cause she 
had for thought, suffered not the sad group- 
ings of care to settle on her brow, but 
laughed, sang, and even romped away the 
time, till the party broke up for the 
night, each retiring to his place of re- 
pose. 
Mr. Domville, who had a comfortable 
bed to repose in, soon sunk into a pro- 
found repose, but out of which, however, 
he was aroused in a very unpleasant man- 
ner. A number of voices, over which 
Mr. Westloe's loudly predominated, called 
N 4

upon him to unlock his chamber door 
instantly, else it would be burst open. 
It was in vain that he assured his dis- 
turbers that the door was not locked; the 
assurance had only the effect of inciting 
them to put their threats into immediate 
execution. 
Ere his nether covering was properly 
adjusted, the whole posse rushed in, call- 
ing upon him to restore the young lady, 
who was missing, or he would be taken 
before a magistrate, and the law should 
have its course. 
Whilst some were rummaging the closet, 
looking under the bed, or peeping up the 
chimney, our Hero cooly remarked that, 
if he had eloped with Miss Westloe, a 
lady whom he had never seen before, it 
was very unlikely that he should be quietly 
found in this apartment.

" But why did you tell us a falsehood ?" 
cried the injured father warmly. 
" Sir, I feel for your situation, else 
that imputation should not go off unre- 
sented. I told you no falsehood." 
" You assured us the door was not 
locked ; yet we found the bolt completely 
drawn." 
" All that I can aver is, that I did not 
draw it. But, Mr. Westloe, have you 
sent to Captain Baldrick's lodgings ?" 
" True  that should have been first 
done; but who can think of every thing? 
I am the only one here able to act. You, 
you and you haste, run, speed, fly; and if 
you find him, force him hither at all 
events. If he is guilty of so flagrant a 
breach of trust, I'll move heaven and 
earth but I will have him hanged for it. 
As for that ungrateful hussy, she shall

Starve upon bread and water, and break 
her heart and be d , for what I care. 
Sir, (to Domville) 1 thought you a man of 
honour, and relying upon my own dis- 
cernment I think so still ; but for all that, 
somebody has broken open my bureau and 
robbed me of cash to a considerable 
amount, and I am also told that a part of 
my plate is gone." 
" And Mistress has also lost her jewels/' 
cried a bye-stander. 
" There, there  there  nothing but 
plagues. An Argus could not prevent such 
accidents ; yet all the care and vexation 
devolve on me." 
Here a female came hurrying in with 
the afflicting intelligence that Mrs. West- 
loe was in fits. 
" The Devil is in the sex, I believe. 
A pretty time she has pitched upon to be

in fits, It is enough to drive mad the 
soundest intellect in Christendom/' 
He went a little way, then returned, 
and so on several times, in evident irre 
solution.

pulled about in every direction ; here am 
I robbed of plate, cash, jewels and daugh- 
ter, and perhaps of my wife  
" And of your garden fruit," cried a 
voice. 
" Well done ! worse and worse. I wish 
to God I were quite destitute, then surely 
I should enjoy some quiet. Mr. Domville, 
if you are an innocent man, as I believe 
you to be, I crave your assistance ; I am 
incumbered with a parcel of idiots about 
me, and not one efficient person. " 
Our Hero enquired whether all the ser-

vants could be mustered up. Not one 
was missing, he replied, except the jade 
that attended his daughter. 
" Who informed you that Miss Westloe 
had absconded ?" 
" I received the first intelligence from 
my gardener." 
The fact was, that whilst this son of 
Adam was stripping the garden of its 
valuables, to be disposed of on his own 
account ,he beheld a gentleman not unlike, 
he thought, Mr. Domville,whom be bad seen 
yesterday, meet his youg lady at the back 
door, and both step into a post chaise that 
drove them away. Having completed his 
job by the safe removal of the fruit, he 
gave the alarm, rightly conjecturing that 
the smaller loss would be absorbed in the 
magnitude of the greater one. 
Here a second summons called on Mr.

MAZES OP LIFE. 277 
Westloe to attend his fainting lady ; and 
he bustled away, although as useless about 
her person as he was to repair every other 
disaster of the present emergency. 
Our Hero availtd himself of the leisure 
now afforded him to complete his dress; 
on consulting his watch, he found that he 
had hardly sufficient time to reach the 
office, ere the morning coach was ready to 
start ; but the present distracted state of 
the family made it imperative on him to 
put off his journey, and the more so, as 
his absence, at that juncture, would not 
fail being ascribed to the consciousness of 
guilt. 
By this time, the messengers dispatched 
arrived breathless from the Captain's lodg- 
ings, with the information that he had not 
slept at home and was not to be found : 
upon this information every voice pro-

nounced him the culprit. Domville ad- 
vised Mr. Westloe, who now re-appeared, to 
dispatch persons on horseback in every 
direction after the fugitives. 
Whilst orders were given to that effect, 
news arrived that the lady was returned 
and the gentleman also, but the latter in a 
predicament not quite so gallant, as when 
he handed his fair partner into the post- 
chaise that was to carry her away from 
parental thraldom to connubial freedom. 
The parties had little difficulty to en- 
counter in the attempt: the lady having 
the command of every outlet. To pre- 
vent however the chance of obstruction, 
the maid turned the lock of Mr. Dom- 
ville's room and took away the key. In 
addition to the contents of her purse, Miss 
Westloe was bearer of her mamma's 
jewels as well as her own. They might

MAZES OF LIFE. 279 
be found serviceable, as she conjectured that 
the Captain was not overstocked with the 
needful. 
We must however exonerate the young 
lady from breaking open her father's 
bureau ; that act is to be ascribed to the 
footman. This fellow had long watched 
for an opportunity, and having overheard 
their plan and time of escape, he con- 
ceived that a fair chance was now offered 
him to become rich with impunity, as the 
theft would naturally be imputed to the 
absentees. 
Thus far every thing went on pros- 
perously with the Plotters, but lo !  Here 
upstarts a Marplot, in the shape of a 
dashing London Tailor, after this guise. 
A bill to the amount of 120 (we will 
omit shillings and pence) was due from 
Captain Bald rick for a plentiful supply

280 MAZES OF LIFE. 
of clothes- of the fashionable cut : he had 
been dunned for the payment of the same, 
but fancied that he had averted the im- 
pending calamity of a writ, by having 
given an assurance of a speedy discharge, 
upon the strength of his going to marry 
a rich heiress. But our experienced Tailor 
construed this information into a mere 
jetch, fit only to gull Tyros in the trade. 
A Sheriff's substitute, previously well ac- 
quainted with our captain's person and 
furnished with the legal instrument, was 
the agent dispatched in behalf of the 
Creditor. 
As ill luck would have it, the coach on 
which our eagle-eyed catchpole was hoisted, 
happened to stop before the inn, at the 
very time the lady and her paramour were 
alighting from their vehicle, to take some 
refreshment, whilst horses were changing.

Without loss of time, the civil officer 
presented to the military one his unwel- 
come credentials, the potentiality whereof 
proving an overmatch for the stock of cash 
in hand, the fugitives, fain to admit 
the company of their now legal Gustos, 
were brought back to the same town they 
had started from, four hours before. 
Mr. Domville now conceiving that 
his presence could be dispensed with, 
was for making his parting bow, when 
loud and hurried raps at the outer door, 
gave so electrifying a shock to tottering 
Mrs. Westloe, that she had only strength 
to ejaculate a faint shriek ; and the gen- 
tleman, with the alacrity usual on such 
occasions, had hardly time to place her 
on the sofa  when  with the bold, deci- 
sive step of both Queen and Heroine, en- 
tered somewhat flurried, the fair cause of

all this confusion. Resentment settled on 
her brow, indignation scowled from her 
eye, her bosom heaved and her face glowed 
with contending emotions, of which she 
appeared to wait for an abatement, ere 
she trusted herself with giving utterance 
to the passionate strains ready to burst from 
her lips. 
At this period, our Disciplinarian could 
only stare in utter astonishment, undecided 
in what tone and words his rebuke should 
be conveyed. The mother however, went 
so far as to utter,  " Oh, Liddy, Liddy ! 
How could you have been so naughty ?" 
" Now, Mother, you are beginning as 
usual.  I proiest, it is enough to provoke a 
saint.  Never was a young creature so ill 
treated as I have been." 
M And really, Girl, you deserved it all," 
was the father's intended reply, but, dashed

by her Amazonian air, the latter part of the 
phrase was supplied by a throat-clearing  
hem; whilst Miss Westloe, with mien 
erect, and with animated, haughty, demea- 
nour, expressive of anger and wounded 
pride, whether really felt or politically 
assumed, was pacing up and down the 
apartment, shaking and even smacking at 
times her slender whip.  Thus she other- 
wise evinced her resentment, authorita- 
tively assuming the tone and manner of an 
injured person. 
" Never was one so deceived,  never did 
any body witness so sudden a change.  A 
paltry fellow with all his pretensions!   
Mean and dastardly. At first no fault 
could be found with the man : his manner 
of carrying me off was well enough, and 
so forth. But, when some shabby, vulgar, 
ill looking wretch presented him with a 
dirty piece of paper, I never beheld

such a sneaking, sniveling', alteration. 
Instead of soundly horse-whipping the 
fellow for his impudence, and kicking him 
round and out of the room, he hemmed and 
hawed, and begged and prayed, aud 
wheedled and coaxed to no purpose. Well, 
hardly were we re-seated in the post-chaise, 
but in steps the odious creature, as if in his 
own right.  Only conceive, Mother, how 
distressing !  There was I, for miles, 
obliged to bear this man's presence : his 
coarse, rugged, black-bearded, visage 
facing me, his dirty clothes defiling mine, 
and I inhaling the fumes of gin, beer, and 
tobacco, that this delectable personage had 
collected from every pot-house.  I loudly 
called on the captain to order or throw him 
out of the carriage.  He could only shrug- 
up his shoulders, look pitiful, and hang 
down his head. How I do detest him ! 
$ay, he had the meanness to inquire whe-

ther our joint purses could not satisfy the 
demand.  Now, though I would have 
given the world to be rid of the intruder, I 
replied that I would not be one shilling 
towards thus compounding for his removal. 
He a captain ! there's not a drummer 
in auy British regiment, but would have 
acted more manfully. I am really under 
some obligation to the man for having thus 
detected the Impostor. Only think, Pa,  a 
sword and pistols at hand, and not used ! By 
nay troth, I now entertain so mean an opi- 
nion of this captainBaldrick,that of the two, 
I had rather run away with the catchpole." 
As our Virago delivered this voluble, 
impassionate, strain, she really looked very 
interesting. She was dressed in a light 
blue riding habit that much became her : 
her hat saucily thrown backwards, over 
which waved a well-supplied ostrich fea- 
ther curving elegantly downwards, her

raven locks in graceful confusion sporting 
about the skirts of her plump, rosy, round, 
visage ; some, as she indignantly tossed her 
head, bobbed the frowning brows of her 
full, black, sparkling eyes; the disorder in 
her dress well accorded with her glow- 
ing features and the vehemence of her ac- 
tion, which was further attested by the 
frequent smacking of her whip. 
Domville longed to be the happy mor- 
tal that was to pacify her. The mother, 
whose nerves had been excessively flur- 
ried, dreading some tragical termination, 
sat in stupid amazement and in tremors. 
But the silly father, enraptured at witness- 
ing such undeniable symptoms of her be- 
ing a chip of the old block, caught her 
in his arms, crying out, " A brave Wench ! 
by all that is gamesome ! ! !"* *******

We shall not proceed any further, ex- 
cept just to state, that it was however 
deemed advisable to consign the young 
lady to an aunt of her's residing in town, 
till other follies, from other quarters, had 
cast over the present a faint shade of obli- 
vion. The Captain regained his release, 
upon mortgaging twenty-five pounds per 
annum out of his half pay, until the whole 
claim, with cost, be liquidated. The maid, 
sheltering herself under the protection of 
her young mistress, in spite of the Elders, 
retained her situation ; the footman wisely 
absconded with his booty, on miss West- 
loe's re-appearance; but that some poe- 
tical justice be done, the gardener was 
turned adrift, mulct of his wages, a year 
of which Was nearly due.

vexations, it seldom fails to extort a severe 
retribution from those Performers, who

SOME time after his return to town, 
weary of incessantly beholding the same 
objects., he thought in good earnest of tak-

had heard so much and seen so little, and 
whither numbers from these Islands were

Louis and the conclusion of the treaty of 
Paris. 
The rival nation in arms, in arts and 
literature must ever be an object of curi- 
osity to any liberal minded Englishman : 
but, in order to view the French people 
unobstructed, to see and to judge for him- 
self, he adopted a method which we re- 
commend to all those whose motive for 
the journey is similar to his own. He de- 
clined making up one of a party, pro- 
ceeded leisurely, avoided the principal 
roads, and reached Paris by a circuitous 
rout, sometimes messing at tables d'hote, 
sometimes faring more sumptuously in 
hotels and, now and then, taking his meal 
and bed in a Cabaret du Village, freely 
mingling with whatever company he should 
chance to meet.

deter them from venturing on such an ex-

cursion, we can assure that, wherever 
they roam, they will hardly fail to meet 
with the produce of the dairy, good poul- 
try, eggs, excellent bread, wholesome pala- 
table wine and kind usage. Moreover, 
their abstinence from more costly viands 
will have the effect of preparing for them 
a keener relish, on their return to the 
luxuries of the table. A portion of the 
savings, thus obtained, may be bestowed 
upon some unfortunate, meritorious, dwel- 
lers in those districts in which they have 
tarried, as a grateful acknowledgment 
for the increase of health and gaety they 
will have acquired ; and where, with much 
greater probability, they will meet with such 
adventures as the one following. 
On the flowry banks of the Aisne,

tremity of a pretty hamlet, chiefly

composed of small proprietors, stands 
the neat dwelling of Joseph Tourville. 
He had been a soldier, but, prefering 
the satisfaction of cultivating his own 
acres to the glory of devastating those of 
others, he returned home, his principles 
undebauched by the licentiousness of a 
camp, and his heart still faithful to his 
first love. 
Fair and exhilirating was the morn that 
brought on the w edding of Joseph Tour- 
ville with Manon Sorglie. The invitation 
was general, the parish hailed it as a holy 
day, and every guest, in consequence, was 
endimanche de sou mieux. Our Hero, 
whose devious tract had brought him to 
the spot the day before, was also included 
in the invitation.

ceremonious civility thus shewn to a 
stranger; consider you are not now knock-

ing double and triple raps on the outer 
doors of any great house in the British 
Metropolis, where access to the master can 
be obtained but through the medium of 
porter and footmen, and where no access is 
allowed, unless names be known or business 
previously specified. We have brought 
you out of the beaten tract of travellers to 
a little society, whose manners are much 
nearer to those of a primeval state. The 
members of which, instead of denying ad- 
mission, solicit the honor of giving it, 
chiefly on such a festive occasion as a 
wedding day 
Domville saw the ceremony performed, 
and the sight affected him. The altar 
was decked out in all its finery. Festoons 
of flowers hung from the cross in the cen- 
tre and, in "graceful folds, twined ro.ind

also profusely scattered from the entrance 
to the steps of the altar. The Bride and 
Bridegroom, arrayed of course in their 
gayest suits, had each an enormous bou- 
quet stuck in front ; indeed a nosegay 
decorated the breast of every one present. 
One would have supposed that all the 
Parterres, for miles round, had been strip- 
ped of their pride for the occasion. The 
dress of the officiating Ecclesiastic alone, 
coi responded with the religious solemnity 
of the Sacrament;* but, above all, the im- 
pressive, yet benign, manner of the man, 
reduced to a proper feeling the too mun- 
dane hilarity of the congregation. 
As they entered and left the church, 
Tourville's attentions to his bride, per- 
haps, to a stranger, excessive, yet altogether 
not unbecoming, seemed the product of 
real attachment. She was pretty and en-

gaging; he rather tall, slender and well 
made, and had much of the French sol- 
dier in his gait and manners. His share 
of the national vanity was discernible, even 
in his courteous demeanor towards his 
wife. A Frenchman's gallantry is as much 
a gratification to his self-love, as it is a 
compliment paid to the object. 
A difference, rather sexual, marked the 
felicity expressed on the two countenan- 
ces.  The one was open, expansive and 
looked without thoughts of an abatement  
the other more concentred, more timorous,

groom they now repaired \ and, by one 
o'clock, all sat down, les MenUrkrs of 
course not omitted, to an abundant dinner, 
substantial as soup, bouillie, a few ragouts, 
poultry, fish, game and an enormous meat 
pye with abundance of vegetables could 
make it : the desert was plentifully supplied 
with all the fruits of the season. The 
pitchers were again and again filled with 
tolerably good wine, yet hardly any one 
trespassed much beyond the limits of so- 
briety. Tourville, by his cordial manner 
of doing the honours of hospitality, ap- 
peared desirious of making every one of 
his guests as happy as himself. Yet such 
a wish could hardly be realized ; for, in 
the present moment, he was, in his opinion, 
the richest man in France : rich in the 
possession of the best of wives, and rich 
in the possession of the best of Vignobles.

In the success of the last mentioned acqui- 
sition he had reason to rejoice, because, on 
the produce of that plantation, the future 
subsistence of both in a great measure de- 
pended. 
To-morrow was the day fixed for the 
beginning of the vintage : a more luxu- 
rious crop of grapes was seldom seen ; 
indeed our Traveller much relished the 
specimens, both black and white, that were 
served up. For the furtherance of the 
story we must inform the Reader, that our 
new Benedict was somewhat of an Inno* 
valor.  Not in Religion nor in Politics. 
God forbid that the effect intended from 
this little, rural, tale be marred by the in-

chase, during the sale of the national 
domains, had ever been a plough farm ; 
yet it was diversified with hillocks well 
adapted, he thought, for the propagation 
of the Vine. On those small hills he 
planted his stocks. They throve and flou- 
rished beyond expectation. This bold 
attempt (for the country for miles round 
was not a vine district) incurred the dis- 
approbation of the Elders, and chiefly the 
censure of Madame la Comtesse D'Estelle, 
a wealthy lady in the neighbourhood, to 
whose only child, now deceased, Manon 
had been foster-sister. Her consent to the 
wedding was withheld till he should con- 
vince her, that his rash departure from the 
practice of prescriptive custom had been 
sanctioned by success. No one, she 
averred, should have her Manon for wife?

unless he were in circumstances to support 
her well. 
That conviction had however taken 
place, about a fortnight before the present 
period. She went  she saw  she touched 
she tasted ; and giving credit to Tour- 
ville's prosperous circumstances, assented to 
the wedding which she had promised to 
honour with her presence ; but some busi- 
ness, unexpectedly prolonged, detained 
her, on that day, in a neighbouring 
town. 
These vineyards formed of course a pro- 
minent topic of conversation, and it was 
agreed upon, before the dancing began, 
that the guests should perambulate over 
the extent and, ere the produce be strip- 
ped from its stems, view it, once more, in 
its exuberant glory. 
Just as they were about to sally forth,

a few drops of rain fell and delayed their 
departure; the black impending clouds, 
they conjectured, would soon disperse, but 
they were seen to accumulate more and 
more, and became so opaque that the day 
was considerably darkened. And now a 
tremendous storm of hail-stones, of very 
large dimensions, dashed on the earth, thick, 
rapidly and with perpendicular force : in 
a few minutes, they covered the ground, 
some inches high. Had such a visita- 
tion occurred before harvest, every crop 
within the range of its devastation would 
have been spoiled, and such an occurrence 
is not very extraordinary in France: but 
the produce of the harvest was safely 
housed, and poor Tourville's vineyards 
alone exposed to its fury ! 
He beheld the storm and anticipated its 
fearful result : so did very one around him,

As he wistfully and sorrowfully watched its 
progress, just in its highest rage, his wife's 
hand still placed within his, he gave it a 
gentle pressure of affection, as much as 
to say.  Never mind, my love, should 
every thing else desert us, we still remain 
for each other. She felt the appeal and 
burst into tears, and sorrow and lamenta- 
tion from ever)' quarter succeeded the 
transports of joy and the shouts of mer- 
riment which, a few minutes before, per- 
vaded the dwelling. 
It was now made apparent to Domville 
how much the married couple had gained 
on the affections of all present'. The con- 
dolence in their affliction was expressed 
with heart-felt utterance. But chiefly the 
Godly and hitherto unobtrusive Priest was 
foremost in his endeavours to mitigate, by 
the holy functions of his ministry, the

calamity that had assailed them : he was 
affected to the heart and, with a tremulous 
voice, a tearful eye, spoke of religious 
resignation,  of another year's chance,  
of a better world,  and they listened. 
The storm having ceased, Tourville 
naturally wished to ascertain the whole 
extent of the disaster. Alas ! it realized 
all that was dreaded. The shoots that had 
been torn down, they and the grapes were 
beaten in the mire : of those that remained 
still fixed on the ichalas, hardly any thing 
but the stalks were left. In what different 
circumstances and, with what different 
feelings, was the intended visit paid to the 
vines ! 
On their return, Domville tarried a little 
behind, in order to consider what he could 
do for the distressed couple. Alas, no 
relief of a permanent-nature oou!d he afford ;

his own circumstances were too precarious, 
and his present amount of cash must 
materially limit the extent of his bounty. 
Here, again, he was liable to self 
reproach for his want of forecast in money 
matters, and at the present time the more 
keenly felt the infliction. He possessed 
little overplus of cash for any unforeseen 
emergencies; but, endeavouring to silence 
the troublesome inward monitor, with fresh 
promises of amendment, he counted out 
his present stock :  it amounted to only ten 
Napoleons and some loose silver. Seven 
of them he re-placed in the purse, and 
the remaining three consigned to the 
company of the inferior pieces. 
" This will be quite enough to carry me 
on to Paris : a fresh quarter will then 
become due, which will put me in posses- 
sion of a hundred pounds sterling."

16 MAZES OF LIFE. 
Having* thus adjusted these matters to 
his mind, he proceeded to the house; 
singling out the Cure, he requested to speak 
to him in private : for that purpose they 
retired into the garden; it bore lamentable 
marks of the devastation of the late storm. 
When he judged that they, were unseen, 
after a suitable preface, he placed in his 
hand the purse and its contents, requesting 
his mediation to obtain Tourville's accept- 
ance, desiring also that he should not be 
known as the giver. 
" It is very ^unwillingly and with diffi- 
culty," replied the good Priest, " that I can 
conceal the Author of benevolent actions. 
Besides," added he, slightly balancing the 
purse in his hand, " by its weight and the 
known liberality of your nation, the gift 
appears considerable. Your reward you 
cannot miss. However, Sir, I do not pro-

mise acceptance on their parts : they are 
proud folks here, and pride is a sin/' said 
he meekly.  " But, pray, tarry awhile, I 
will return presently." 
He did so, and was attended by man and 
wife. 
When they met, the Priest stepped aside, 
and Tourville advanced with the purse in 
his hand. Making* a grateful acknowledg- 
ment for the intended obligation, and for 
the delicate manner in which it was ten- 
dered, he begged to return it. 
" We have yet the means, I assure yon, 
of retrieving our loss." 
" Indeed, Sir," said Manon, ! we can 
yet do very well : and were we quite des- 
titute, we could not submit to deprive you 
of so much money in a strange land." 
In vain Domville assured them that he 
could well spare that sum ; he was com*

pelled to acquiesce. However, ere lie left 
the house, he took the Priest again aside ; 
informed him that, by by to-morrow morn- 
ing, he should be on his way to Paris, gave 
direction where a letter would reach him, 
with a request that he would not delay giv- 
ing him information, whenever his services 
should be wanted. Having obtained an 
assurance to that effect, they partecl with 
Blti trial professions and sentiments of "re- 
gard, and each betook himself to his hum- 
ble abode. 
In that conference, Tourville appeared 
to greater advantage : the late calamity 
had the effect of maturing the man, and 
foppery was discarded. 
Next morning, our Traveller left his 
room ready for departure : at the foot of 
the siairs, he met the good Cure, who was

waiting his coming down. After the usual 
greeting, 
ff I hope, Sir, I do not presume too 
much on your goodness, in requesting you 
to deliver this letter to Madame la Comtesse 
D'Esiel/e; as the town in which she now 
resides is in your way to Paris. 
" I will deliver it safely and with pleasure/* 
" I trust I shall not appear too officious" 
said he rather hesitatingly, " but the pur- 
port is respecting Tourville and his Bride. " 
' Quite the contrary, my good Father. 
It is the essential of your ministry to dis- 
seminate blessings on both sides, by point- 
ing out to the Prosperous where and when 
they can relieve the Un fortunate. " 
" Perhaps I ought to go myself, but I 
may be wanted here. D'ailleurs" added 
he with unaffected simplicity  D'ailleurs

" You may safely rely on me, and for 
what other good offices I can perform." 
" The Countess, Sir, is a good, well 
disposed lady ; she has an excellent heart, 
but is a litle too hasty and self-willed. The 
whole parish belonged to her family, but 
was forfeited to the state by their emigra- 
gration, and parcelled out and sold in lots. 
On her succeeding to the otherparts of 
the property, some busy folks would advise 
her to try the recovery of this, by an attempt 
at ejecting the present occupiers.  God 
forbid I should, she cried ! they are all good 
people, the land cannot be better cultiva- 
ted, nor in better hands.  It were a pity !

more serious attempts are making to dis- 
turb the present order of things; but she 
is more than ever against any alteration : 
saying, that since she has become further 
acquainted with the cultivators, she is 
more pleased than ever with them, and 
that it were flying in the face of God's 
justice to deprive poor folks of their little 
all, honestly purchased, and made double 
its former value by their industry, merely 
to obtain that which is of no use to her, and 
which, in a short time, perhaps to-morrow, 
she must, for ever quit and, with it, all her 
other earthly possessions.

certainly of the first description.  The 
reverse may be affirmed of him who, on the 
contrary, detracts from the merits of his

prone to expose their faults, and feeds his

THE WEDDING. 
BEHOLD now the honorable Charles, 
Nayland, Domville astride on a French 
Bidet, (whether with or without jack boots 
the history is silent) galloping on the high 
road to Rheims the bearer of an epistolary 
document from an old priest to an old 
woman, and yet so proud of the trust, that 
he would not have exchanged it for the 
grandest dispatch that was ever conveyed

from one crowned head to another, 
The Countess happening* to be visible, he 
was ushered into the presence of an elderly 
diminutive person, certainly exceeding" 
three score, with sharp black eyes, grey 
hair, much mobility of features, and so 
brisk, so jerkish, in all her motions that, 
instead of attending to V arrondissement des 
membres, so much insisted upon by dancing 
masters, her every action was short and 
angular, as if she moved by springs, her 
velocity of delivery kept pace with the 
rapid succession of her ideas : yet, for all 
that, the gentlewoman was discernible, 
and her long', slender, ebony staff, knobbed 
with ivory, well became that character. 
Her reception of the messenger was 
courteous, but the perusal of his dispatches 
discomposed her equanimity. The vexa- 
tion she felt was evinced by an alteration

in her features and the unconnected phrases 
that accompanied it, in the delivery of 
which, she kept time with her ebony staff 
in rapid knocks upon the boards.

best friend for a rash, thoughtless Adven- 
turer.  Oh, yes it were flying in the face 
of God's judgment for me to interfere.  
It is an awful warning  They are quite 
helpless. Alas, I see nothing can be now 
done for them." 
Having got hold of that notion, our 
Hero exhausted all the resources of his 
rhetoric to dispossess her of it in vain. 
" No, no, no (here more rapidly still 
knocked the ebony stick against the boards) 
No, no, no.  It is surely a lamentable case.

them; but if they won't take warning, I

of bearing the message to me. But it has 
always been the rule of my conduct to 
bow without murmuring to God's dispen-

sations \ by so doing, I have avoided many 
a tribulation.  You, Sir, are young yet: 
numerous probably are the blessings and 
evils in store for you : by availing yourself 
of the benefit of my long experience, you 
will lessen the effects of the one and in- 
crease the number of the others. Sir, 
allow me to repeat my thanks for your 
well meant interference in this unfortunate 
matter !  Alas ! Just on their wedding 
day ! and on that particular hour !  Dread- 
ful!  Yes  yes  God's finger is plainly 
visible in all this.  Sir, I have no more to 
say  I wish you a good morning and every 
success in life." 
So saying, she formally and demurely 
courtesied and left him. 
Domville returned to his inn in no very 
placid humour, and got upon his bidet in 
order to proceed on his journey ; but here

he found the animal, hitherto so tractable, 
now quite as obstinate as the Countess. No 
sooner did it feel spur or whip, than it 
sprung sideways and twirled back its head 
towards the gate that had admitted them : 
it would however so far obey the reins as 
to turn in an opposite direction, having no 
objection to re-enter its stable quarters, 
but feeling a fresh notification for pro- 
ceeding, a similar spring and twirl com- 
pelled the rider, from south-west suddenly 
to face agfain north-east. This sort of 
manege, many times repeated, collected a 
crowd. In the presence of such numbers, 
our Hero thought it still more incumbent 
on his manhood not to be overcome by the 
obstinacy of an animal ; but for all he 
could do, he found that obstinacy insu- 
perable. At length, the hostler came out 
and informed him that, the hackney, like

many others, was trained np not to exceed 
certain limits: and if he wished to pro- 
ceed, he must have a fresh horse and suffer 
this to return. 
" In that case we shan't part so soon," 
cried he, " I will return in his com- 
pany." 
So saying he bestowed on him a smart 
application of the whip  a needless opera- 
tion, for the bidet, having gained his point, 
would have galloped away on his road 
home, without any such incitement. 
When he had partaken of his afternoon's 
meal, he called at the Parsonage. The 
Cur was at Tourville's, thither he went, 
and soon discovered that the newly married 
couple had summoned up all their forti- 
tude, as the best defence against the as- 
saults of calamity. What little could be 
saved from the wreck was done or doing 
c a

and the business of the farm went on as 
usual : the master was busy with his 
men, and the wife's attention taken up 
with domestic cares. To the Priest he 
imparted the unsuccessful termination of 
his embassy, and tarried with him till the 
periodical return of the evening repast 
brought them all together. The exercise 
required by his labour had given fresh 
spirits to Tourville, and Manon acted a 
becoming part, in contributing by her 
good humour to the continuation of his 
gaiety. 
Dotnville was loath to depress their 
cheerfulness by the intelligence he had to 
impart, yet it were injudicious to conceal 
or palliate the truth, and to the Cure he 
resigned the task of disclosure. Though 
they had overcome the supineness of de- 
pression partly by bodily exertion, and

MAZES OF LIFE 31 
recovered their elasticity of mind partly 
by the suggestions of their own philoso- 
phy, yet Hope had been a most powerful 
ally : Tourville certainly did expect, and 
Manon had made sure of, liberal assistance 
from the Countess. 
But when they were informed, though 
in the mildest terms that could be used, 
that none was intended to be offered, they 
felt the refusal as a fresh calamity on them. 
Manon was not proof agajnst the unkind- 
uess of her late mistress ; a flood of tears 
betrayed the acuteness of her feelings: 
this the more called upon the husband to 
act both the man and the lover. He 
folded her in his arms  he pressed her to 
his bosom, wiped away her tears, called 
her by every endearing name, bade her 
disregard the unmerited neglect, assured 
her that, as long as they were young and

health} 7 , and able and willing to work, 
they could not become destitute; that 
there was a Providence for them, as well 
as for all others and, as they had many 
years in store, so they had many chances 
of retrieving their loss. Thus the various 
topics of consolation his affection prompt- 
ed for her relief, mainly contributed to his 
own. 
But what should be chiefly enforced in 
this place, is the beneficial tendency of 
bodily exertions under heavy calamities. 
Had Tourville and his wife remained in- 
active, looking at each other, echoing 
highs, moping about the house in stupid 
dolefulness, uselessly bewailing their hard 
fate, they would now have considered the 
failure of their expectation from Madame 
D'Estelle as the extinction of their last 
hope, but the labour of the day taught
## p. 33 (#41) ##############################################

them how rich they yet remained in their 
own resources, and that with strict oeconomy, 
they could be independent of any one. 
Such considerations must materially lessen 
the acuteness of any disappointment from 
other quarters. 
Domville, feeling more and more an in- 
terest in the fate of this worthy couple 
was about to re-urge the offer of his purse 
more earnestly than before, when the rum- 
bling of the old fashioned family coach of 
the Countess, driving up to the door, 
gave the first intimation of her near ap- 
proach. 
Manon, her eyes red and still tearful, 
flew to receive her, Tourville erected him- 
self, re-adjusted his dress, stood upon his 
centre, and prepared for the attack, well 
knowing in which quarter it would be 
made. The Priest withdrew to a corner,

Domville took a seat beside him, but, when 
the Countess was ushered by the Bride into 
the apartment, they all stood up. 
At the first sight of her Protegee, she 
had opened upon her one of her scolding 
batteries, but an imploring look molli- 
fied her resentment. 
i Mais quoi done tu as lesyeux rouges  
Tu viens de pleurer !  Ah ! ma pauvre En- 
fant! fax grand envie de pleurer aussi, 
moi" 
In that temper she advanced into the 
parlour, determined, however, to pour all 
the remaining amunition of her displeasure 
on the hapless bridegroom, who received 
her with becoming respect, yet in a stiff, 
embarrassed manner. She was led to the 
arm chair, her usual seat of state, but 
scorning to sit down. 
" Eh bien, Monsieur Tourville ! you see

you see how it is  I told you it would 
so turn out, but you would not believe me. 
To be sure, I am a person of no great con- 
sequence : the wisdom, the experience of 
age is entitled to no sort of consideration, 
all the knowledge of the world is, nowa-

expect it ; but am amazed at your blindness, 
in not foreseeing" that some such disaster 
would be the result of all your visionary 
projects. Believe me, nothing like the 
good old ways, sanctioned by the wisdom 
of ages. On that point I know you will 
agree with me, Mr. Le Curt: the Gentle- 
man here may demur; it is natural he 
should side with those of his own age.- 
But, Manon, why in the name of common 
prudence, were you in such haste to get 
married ? Why not wait till the grapes 
were gathered and the wine made. Well, 
well, I see I afflict you. I must not bear 
too hard on my poor Emily's friend, com- 
panion, nurse and all. Really, Tourville, 
I am heartily concerned at your calamity, 
but what can I do ?  As sure as you stand 
there, it is a severe judgment from above. 
I ought not, I dare not interfere. Tell

This case of conscience the reverend

They were not far off, quaffing a liberal 
allowance of wine in the kitchen and the 
fiddles hung* upon pegs. Her expression,

tom that, within Madame la Comtesse, all 
acrimony was removed ; accordingly the

The Orchestra struck up le minuet de la cour,

With a dispatch unmatchable any where

He was received by the Countess in her

of friendship that surprised him : it bor-

restricted to the happy few. Her Con-

small figure and features.  Sir, I request 
your attendance here, that you may afford

Our Hero, diving into her thoughts, re-

well known to all the country round, and  
but she, interrupting, proceeded 
' Sir, it is not an act of generosity I am 
performing: in that case, a witness should

Domville to shew her every attention ; the 
unfeigned regard he now entertained for 
the lady prompted him to suitable acts and 
expressions. She was greatly taken with 
his manners, and was much affected when 
they parted : she seldom, in her visits to 
her protegek, omitted to remind her of 
Monsieur V Anglais, observing.

There is no unalloyed felicity in this 
world : the munificence of the Countess had 
insured a competence to Tourville and the 
possession of his wife secured his well 
being ; yet the devastation committed on 
his vineyards often recurred to his 
memory.

pursued his journey to Paris and, whether

A Sombreuil died for the Royalists, a

ignorant and the learned, the criminal and 
the innocent. 
The effervesence of every passion, created 
by the unrestrained conflict of human 
interests, is now nearly subsided ; but the 
traveller stands within the principal focus 
of the Volcano, and the materials that 
caused the mighty explosions are by no 
means exhausted. As he treads the streets

entered, six years since \ because although 
peace was concluded, the Revolution could 
not be affirmed to have terminated. The 
Dynasty of the Bourbons, it is true, had 
again succeeded that of Napoleon ; but 
on the nature of their future policy, and on 
the conduct of the allies who had seated 
the present king on the throne, the sta- 
bility of their power in a great measure 
depended. The nation that boasted of 
its armies having entered in triumph the 
metropolitan cities of the principal Con- 
tinental Potentates, now beheld its own 
Capital in the occupation of the allied 
powers; and they, who had forcibly altered 
the constitution of other states, now had a 
monarch forced upon them by the bayonets 
of foreign soldiers.

Leipsig and of Waterloo: they thought 
it very hard that they should be insulted 
with the same contumelies they had in-

man: crying out for equal laws, equal 
rights when oppressed ; withholding them 
from others when in power. And whe-

secede from them while abroad, confor- 
mably to the plan he had hitherto pursued, 
he intended soon to quit it. 
One morning he received a parcel di- 
rected for him : it consisted of several letters 
addressed to numbers of the old Noblesse. 
They were from the Comtesse d'Estelle, 
who, presuming' he might make a long 
stay in Paris, had remitted them to him 
as means of introduction to the best so- 
cieties. He was much gratified with this 
remembrance of the old lady. He also 
found one from Tourville who, in case our 
Hero should wish to retire into prirate 
lodgings, had taken the liberty of recom- 
mending to his notice the house of a well 
tried acquaintance ; where, he was sure, 
Mr. Domville would meet, on moderate 
terms, with comfort and every reasonable 
convenience.

He accordingly went out to examine 
them. The situation, the apartments, the 
price and the appearance of the Owners, 
being- to his satisfaction, he agreed to their 
terms and became immediately their lodger. 
Nor had he, during his stay in the French 
capital, any cause to repent the choice he 
made. The easy gaiety and respect- , 
ful attentions of Xlenaud and his wife 
often induced him to spend an hour with 
them 5 he would thankfully accept their 
invitation to a meal, and found other 
means of returning their civility in a man-

stranger as having an eye to his purse, 
contract their hearts within their own con- 
cerns, frequent but a certain set, out of 
that circle never venturing, lest a depar-

A SURPRISE. 
ONE evening, as he was sitting 1 with his 
landlord and wife, the washer-woman 
brought in his linen with that of the 
family. This woman was much considered 
by her employers for the propriety of her 
conduct; her manner and language ap- 
pearing above her situation in life. She 
seemed deeply affected, tears were still

in her eyes, notwithstanding her kerchief 
had been several times applied to them. 
Madame Renaud desired her to sit down 
and enquired after the cause. 
She said that she had just left the hotel 
of the Comte de Clermont, being* known 
to the porter was desired to walk up and 
deliver the clothes to the maid. Seeing no 
one about, she gave a gentle rap at the 
door of the outer-room, could distinguish 
several steps within, but no one came to 
open. Presently heard the stern, angry, 
threatning tone of a man, and the voice of 
a young woman who sought to detain 
him. Her tears and entreaties seemed 
only to increase his rage, for his voice 
grew louder. She then fancied she heard 
a blow given and, the man retiring within 
an inner apartment, slammed the door 
after him ; his departure was succeeded

by piercing shrieks, as from one who was 
in fits. 
At that moment the door opened hastily, 
and the man servant came out in great 
consternation, yet rejoiced at meeting her 
so opportunely : bade her return with him 
and help him to try the recovery of his 
young lady who, he feared, was in a dying 
state.

an inner room, in an angry voice he 
ordered us both away. I had some little 
talk with the servant : he could or would 
not tell me the cause of the Count's dis- 
displeasure 5 but owned that she had been 
on her knees before him to no purpose, 
and had followed him to the outer room, 
when, once more kneeling*, she laid hold 
of his coat skirt as he was going out, 
which so enraged her father, that he turned 
round and struck her.  Blondin verily

" Blondin," cried Domville, with sur- 
prise ! 
" Yes, Sir," calmly resumed the laund- 
ress, " his man Blondin believes that the 
blow went to her heart. It was more than 
she could bear, and it caused the alarming 
swoonings that followed."

the family, yet commiseration for the 
sufferer was excited by this artless tale ; 
but the Narrator, who had felt the benevo- 
lent interference of the young lady in her 
domestic concerns, was lavish in her 
praise and, after relating a number of 
generous acts that had come to her know- 
ledge, departed, invoking the blessings 
of Heaven on her, who, she emphatically 
affirmed, deserved all that Heaven could 
bestow. 
The Reader may rest assured that the 
earliest part of the night was not for Dom-

person should be the lovely Stranger of

ascertained the truth. Blond in was the

to-morrow's dawn.  To-morrow's dawn 
came  if be traced it, it must have been 
in a dream. 
He bad that evening longed to question 
the Laundress but forbore, lest his emotion 
should betray him in the presence of others : 
the next morning, however, he sent for 
her. When they were alone, he asked her 
for a personal description of Mademoisselle 
de Clermont. The relation satisfied him 
that she and his Julie were the same. 
What he was told respecting the father, 
rather confirmed than weakened his 
belief in the identity, but he was rather 
staggered when, questioning her about 
the brother, she affirmed that she knew 
no one as such, and believed the lady 
to be the only child.  Had the family 
ever been in England ?  She could not 
tell, but heard they had passed many years

abroad. Was Blondin to be spoken with? 
She thought not easily, he generally 
kept close within doors, and was besides 
very old. 
Having gathered all the information he 
could, she was dismissed. It now oc- 
curred to him that this very Count de 
Clermont was one of the noblemen to whom 
he had a letter of introduction from Madame 
D'Estelle.  It so proved, his name and 
place of residence agreeing with the 
direction on the letter. This very day 
he determined to present his credentials. 
How his imagination ran wild upon the 
subject! Not only was he to be admitted 
into the Count's presence, but also by him 
to be presented to his daughter.  She 
would appear, of course, as beautiful as 
ever, and he  not altogether uninteresting
## p. 62 (#70) ##############################################

to her. But that smiling picture soon 
disappeared : the supposed sufferings of 
his adorable Julie now called forth all the 
sympathies of his heart,  he vowed revenge 
on her tyrannical parent,  he was autho- 
rised to inflict it. The singular manner in 
which her abode had been discovered to 
him, clearly proved that Providence had 
selected him for her deliverer.  Yes, he 
would, at all events, rescue the Lady from 
any further exercise of the Count's barba- 
rity ; and, moreover, would subject him to 
the severest retaliation for every cruelty he 
had already made her feel. 
He now began so far to act, as to array 
himself out in his best attire, and took the 
direction to the Count's hotel ; but the 
nearer he approached the house the slower 
his feet performed their office, the weaker 
^rew his resolution, and the stronger the

palpitation of his heart.  When, at length, 
his hand held up the knocker, his courage 
failed him, he dared not give the blow, but 
let it gently fall, and retreated to some 
retired spot in the vicinity, to recover 
breath and recollect his scattered thoughts. 
How soon was the doughty champion, 
who had sallied forth for the protection of 
injured beauty, reduced to the helpless 
state of a child. Had he been apprized of 
her real situation, he might have fearlessly 
known how to act ; but his ignorance of her 
concerns made him timorous; it could only 
excite his imagination to frame possible 
cases, and all became wild, obscure, per- 
plexed, intricate and opposite. 
Who knows but his uncalled for inter- 
ference may aggravate her woes instead of 
alleviating them. How could he dare to 
take any decisive step in an affair of which
## p. 64 (#72) ##############################################

he had so little knowledge.  A stranger,  
a foreigner, was probably of all others the 
least entitled to appear forward as the 
righter of her wrongs. If she had any to 
complain of, her own natural friends were 
certainly the best qualified to interfere. 
Bat then the scene on the Coomb  the 
disappearance of her brother  the laundress' 
story  the heavenly attractions of this lovely 
Creature.  Ay, the main cause this of all 
such romantic effervesence. Because she 
was handsome, it followed, of course, that 
she was deserving; and because she was 
both, it became him, of course, to volunteer 
himself as her Protector ! Divest of her 
beauty, and the gentleman would recover 
his placidity, let her virtue and the hard- 
ships of her case be ever so apparent. 
Again, he would give the world to behold 
her and hear her speak : and now that he

MAZES OF LIFE. 65 
had a probable chance of gratifying his 
wish, he feared to venture into her presence : 
he foreboded that the fate of both was 
to be determined in that interview. 
" Surely some indescribable, portentous 
mystery, hangs over us and would be then 
developed \ productive, perhaps, of unutter 
able joys, but as likely to plunge us into 
unparalleled horrors. 
Thus he suffered his fancy to master his 
reason ; when, however, the former faculty 
had exhausted itself in the production of 
a thousand improbable conjectures, the 
plain matter of fact stood before him. He 
had a letter to present to the Comte de 
Clermont, on a subject of very common 
occurrence: the house was in sight; it 
rested with him whether he should deliver 
it or not.  He now once more proceeded
## p. 66 (#74) ##############################################
66 MAZES OF LIFE. 
to the house and actually had the courage, 
this time, to let the knocker fall. 
The gentleman was at home : to the 
servant he imparted in an unsteady voice, 
that he had a letter from Madame D'Estelle 
-to Monsieur le Comte ; that it was his 
wish to deliver it personally. The man 
returned, saying that his master felt him- 
self indisposed, and requested the gentle- 
man would favor him with a call to-morrow, 
when, he hoped, he should be able to see 
him. 
This was a reprieve, a gladsome reprieve 
to Mr. Domville, who now returned home 
with bold nimble steps, yet in such a state 
of agitation, as if he had just escaped some 
imminent peril, or gone through some very 
laborious exertions. The next day, as the 
hour of visit drew nigh, his terrors returned, 
though in a considerably less degree. The

result of the interview proved how silly it 
was in him to entertain any. 
The Count received him with all the 
politeness of the old court, expressed his 
regard for Madame D'Estelle, inquired 
after her health, should feel a real pleasure 
in attending to her recommendation, but 
lamented that, as the state of his health 
compelled him to be almost a recluse, he 
had very few opportunities of being of much 
service : however, what could be done, he 
would not fail doing, requested to be 
favored with his address, and then, with a 
profession of acknowledgments and of 
bowings, they very ceremoniously parted. 
It was obvious that the count had not the 
least recollection of our Hero; but Domville 
knew him at first sight, though consider- 
ably enfeebled, much reduced, and his face 
furrowed up with deeper and additional

wrinkles.  But then the Lady.  Alas I none 
appeared, either in the shape of an angel or 
a goddess !  None was even mentioned, 
indeed nothing betrayed the existence of 
even an ordinary woman  a solemn silence 
pervaded the dwelling" : he and the count 
seemed the only beings within.  He often 
lent an attentive ear  perhaps a plaintive 
note  a sigh  a moan  a shriek  would 
betray her Tyrant : but for all his powers 
of scrutiny and observation, he was com- 
pelled to take his leave without having the 
slightest pretence to assert his championship 
When he got into the street, he entered 
a coffee-house that had a front view of the 
hotel, with an intent of watching the 
ingress and egress of every remarkable 
person, but the door remained as immove- 
able as if it had been barricaded for a siege. 
He then left his station and walked round

the hotel. A fiacre drove up to a postern 
gate, at the back premises : he anxiously 
watched, concealed as well as he could, the 
result. He beheld a person, apparently 
young, her face much and purposely con- 
cealed by her dress, come out hastily, step 
in and the coach drove off. 
" It is she, cried our Enthusiast -It must 
be she  no one else can be endowed with 
such an air  with such elegance  with 
such a figure ; and on that assurance, 
resting upon indications so very faint, 
deceptive and evanescent, he posted after 
the vehicle, followed it through the narrow, 
winding, streets of that part of the town. At 
length he saw it draw up in front of the 
Conciergerie. 
He approached as near as he could, in 
hopes of obtaining a mere glance of her 
countenance, but his wish was not gratified,

he only beheld her eater the prison : the 
massive gate closed upon her, and the 
carriage drove off. 
Perhaps the coachman could afford him 
some information  he set off full speed, 
overtook the vehicle, and agreed with the 
man to ride back to his apartments. Indeed 
he had now need of such an assistance : 
the big drops ran down his face ; his dress 
and person so much discomposed, that he 
appeared as if he had made his escape from 
that dreadful place of confinement which 
he saw the lady enter : yet he found himself 
already overpaid in the felicity of sitting 
upon the same seat, in touching the same 
objects she had just quitted. 
On his alighting, he bade the driver 
follow him into a private room, and putting 
into his hand an additional piece of 
silver, questioned him, but in cautious

terms, about his former passenger, but 
could gain no other information than that 
of being ordered to take her up from the 
Conciergerie, at nine o'clock in the evening, 
and convey her back to her house. 
At that hour Domville was on the pave, 
in front of the building, espied the same 
fiacre, waited about half an hour, when, the 
gates unbarring, the same Lady was led out 
with every mark of respectful attention, 
attendants, holding flambeaux, stood beside 
the carriage as she stepped into it : she held 
a kerchief to her face, appeared in great 
distress, and a sob reached the ear and 
struck upon the heart of our susceptible 
Hero, who followed her to the hotel. On 
her alighting, she appeared more collected, 
and entered the dwelling without any out- 
ward indication of grief. 
On that night, ere he closed his eye lids,

Domville arranged his plan of operations 
for the future. First he called on the 
laundress, besought her to get by some 
means Blondin into the house arid to let 
him immediately know., when she had 
succeeded. He soon received the welcome 
summons, and hastened to attend. He 
perceived a feeble old man, almost double 
with age, who gave such strong indications 
oftheawein which his master held him, 
that it were folly to expect the slightest 
assistance from what co-operation he was

Our Hero inquired after the young 
gentleman, whom he ventured to call 
Mademoiselle de Clermont's brother. 
"Ah, Sir, said the old fellow, much 
affected, he was slain in one of the late 
battles, fighting for the cause of our good 
king.  Yet I don't know  added he

which battle, and where they buried him." 
" I hope, however, your young Mistress 
is well and happy." 
" Alas, she is mainly altered :  I used to 
take such a pride in seeing her so handsome 
but she grieves too much ; she is inconsola- 
ble for the loss of her brother, for she ever 
was a most affectionate sister  no wonder, 
he loved her as he loved his life." 
" Does she ever go out ?" 
" Very seldom, Sir.  But really (recol- 
lecting himself) I dont know why I should 
be so communicative with a stranger.  Sir, 
you must excuse me  I must be gone

It was no less than to address the following' 
Epistle to Mademoiselle De Clermont. 
Madam,

in some manner, I may be of service to you.

of my abilities in your cause, and in behalf 
of any one you wish to befriend.

devotion, 
Madam, 
Your most respectful obedient servant, 
Charles N. Domville. 
P. S. I once had the pleasure of seeing 
you and your brother in North Wales,

welfare, after being allowed to peruse this 
letter, agreed to deliver it without the 
Count's knowledge. 
How oppressive, how cheering, how 
agonizing, how enlivening were his sensa- 
tions during the departure and return of 
his messenger ! 
" Shall I be favored  shall I be honored 
pshaw  shall I be enriched with an answer? 
Oh no. She never will  how can I ex- 
pect  yet she may  I am sure she needs 
the assistance of a friend  of a defender.  
Should TL be the fortnnate man, no limits 
would 1 set to my devotion.  This room is 
so close, so confined  I pant for a wider 
space." 
And down he hurried, in order to beguile 
the time by a short ramble ; but soon re- 
traced his steps, lest she should return in 
his absence.

" One precious moment might be lost, 
which the labour of ages could not retrieve." 
In that state of impatience, many a hasty 
stride he took up and down his apart- 
ment; when, from the window, he be- 
held the trusty messenger hastening to 
the house. A certain bustliness in her 
gait seemed to indicate that she was the 
bearer of some message, yet her empty 
hands belied the indication. He heard her 
knock  she was admitted, ascended the 
stairs, entered his room, out of her bosom 
drew a folded paper, and delivered it into 
his trembling hands, with directions for 
him to peruse it in her presence. He did 
so, although not with the same self-com- 
mand as be would go through a News- 
paper account of a court gala.  The paper 
only contained these few lines.

" It concerns the person whom Mr. D. has favored 
with a letter to know, whether during his stay in the 
dwelling alluded to, that Gentleman beheld aught that 
excited his surprise." 
Although the sixteenth part of a minute 
was time sufficient for the perusal, during 
a much longer period did he stand motion- 
less bending over, his eye steadily fix- 
ed, on the paper. At length Madam Jo- 
delle roused him from his reverie, by inti- 
mating that she was directed to bring an 
answer back. The gentleman contrived to 
muster sufficient steadiness of fingers to 
pen the subjoined note. 
" Mr. Domville declares that the singular sight, of 
which he had a full view, he being at the time (about 
live years ago) in the dwelling known by the name of 
the Hermit's cave, was such as will never be erased 
from his memory."

Away went the messenger with this fresh 
document, leaving our rapturous Hero to 
the enjoyment of his own, which was read 
to the full as many times over, as the fond- 
est author repeats his choicest passage : 
The paper was moreover several times fa- 
vored with the pressure of his lips, and at 
length treasured up in his pocket-book. 
Yet, elate as he was for being noticed by 
the fair Lady, he greatly feared that the 
correspondence would end here ; but the 
day did not close without another letter 
being brought to him.  These the con- 
tents. 
Sir,

of the very transaction which, this morn-

ful for me to question the veracity  the ho- 
nor  of a Gentlemen : for is not a strict ad- 
herence to truth the very essence of honor?  
However, Sir, as you were a witness of the 
scene, it is an inducement to avail myself of 
your offer. But, previously, have the good- 
ness to state truly the means by which you 
came to any knowledge of my present si- 
tuation,  your station in life,  and whe-

Thus ran our Hero's reply. 
Madam,

shall be my endeavour hereafter never 
again to subject myself to a similar impu- 
tation.  I now proceed to obey your

The note was thus worded.

would have probably met with a different

AS the Reader is not, like our Hero, ap- 
prised of the contents of the packet en- 
trusted to his care ; and, as the packet 
itself could not supply all the information 
we should desire him to possess, for the ap-

his actions at the present awful crisis ;  
after mature deliberation, we think it, on

the whole, preferable, in lieu of that docu- 
ment, to lay before him a more minute 
account of the Clermont family : in the 
execution of which, we will endeavour to 
do justice to all parties, being* entirely free 
from the restraint which filial piety im- 
poses on Mademoiselle de Clermont, when 
the process of her narrative brings her to 
state by what motives the conduct of her 
father was influenced. Moreover, the 
Lady herself, being a principal performer 
in the drama, her modesty ever prevented 
her from doing herself that justice to which 
she was on every account entitled, and 
which we should be very unwilling to with- 
hold from her. 
Louis, Charles, Francois, De Solignac, 
Comte de Clermont, sprung from one of 
the most ancient and wealthy families of 
France; at the age of twenty six, he sue-

eeeded to the patrimony of his ancestors. 
With notions highly aristocratical, he, as 
long* as his prosperity lasted, was gallant 
chivalrous and liberal : his lofty disposition 
did not divest him of urbanity to inferiors ; 
because, as he felt a stain like a wound,* 
his own acute feelings made him respect 
those of others; these qualities were fur- 
ther set off by the comeliness of his person. 
At the age of thirty five, he married a Lady 
much younger than himself, of noble de- 
scent, vast acquisitions and extreme beauty, 
who .only lived to see her daughter reach 
her fourteenth year. 
When the revolution broke out, he 
took a most active and decided part in 
favour of the reigning Monarch, Louis 
the Sixteenth.  Repaired to Cobtentz,

Courts, in order to hasten the supply of 
combatants in the Royal cause. The 
success of the Allies by no means corres- 
ponded with the zeal that animated him ; 
but the victories of the Republicans, in- 
stead of breaking" his proud spirit, had 
only the effect of souring his disposition: 
he graduallly became peevish, morose, 
fretful, taciturn and unsocial. The recol- 
lection of his former grandeur marred 
every enjoyment which a moderate man 
could have derived from his then situation, 
and the considerable portions he had been 
able to save from his forfeited estates were 
greatly undervalued ; because he did not 
consider them with reference to how much 
less, others of his rank were glad to retain, 
but because he persisted in comparing 
them with how much more, he was com- 
pelled to leave behind.

The execution of the King and his 
Consort involved him in many dangerous 
situations, owing to his attempts to retrieve 
or avenge the royal cause; but, when the 
treaty of Amiens had reduced the 
Allies to admit the title of Napoleon, as 
the chief Ruler of France, to the exclu- 
sion of the Bourbon Dynasty, the Comte 
de Clermont gave up the cause as hopeless, 
retired with his family to some obscure 
town in Austria, and afterwards came over 
to England. 
Hitherto his two children had the be- 
nefit of the maternal instructions of the 
Countess, but in 1808 she died. The fever 
of disappointed ambition that incessantly 
preyed upon her husband, could not pre- 
vent him from feeling the severity of his 
loss  to his son and daughter that loss was 
irreparable.

We must stop here to enumerate the en- 
viable blessings the Count had still retain- 
ed, after his expatriation and the seizure 
of the principal part of his property.  An 
excellent wife and mother, amiable, kind, 
and considerate ; two children, such as 
any parent would have been proud 
to acknowledge, and a competence still 
sufficient to maintain him and them in in- 
dependence.  Yet he deemed and felt him- 
self a most miserable mortal ; because he 
possessed no longer that rank and affluence 
combined, which is not the lot of one 
out of millions ever to obtain.  Thus this 
Self4ormentor was a loser every way, the 
life of his consort he did not consider as 
any alleviation of his misfortunes ; yet, he 
felt her death as an additional calamity. 
He now became a downright Misanthrope, 
and with his son and daughter, and his

man Blondin, took up his abode in the 
Hermit's cave, situated within that coomb 
of North Wales, whose silentious seclusion 
he selected as most congenial to his pre- 
sent, unsocial, disposition. 
The character of Mademoiselle De 
Clermont we will leave to the joint care of 
Mr. Domville and Madame Jodelle, with- 
out any fear of unjust detraction from its 
merits ; but the delineation of her brother's 
devolves on us, although we fear the exe- 
cution requires more abilities than we have 
reason to think ourselves possessed of. 
The young Henry Solignac de Clermont 
was a highly privileged favorite of nature, 
his personal comeliness with strength and 
activity combined, the least of his endow- 
ments :  his mind undaunted, fervid, en- 
thusiastic, was such as we would ascribe to 
area/ hero : his daring, his perseverance

the loftiness of bis conceptions, would have 
enabled him to maintain that character. 
Tbe love of self, that prime instigator of 
every man's actions, was invested with so 
much splendor, by being indentified with 
the interest of national welfare, and by the 
sacrifice, when requisite, of personal 
considerations, that it seemed to exist 
only for his country's glory, his sister's pro- 
tection, and the advantage of his friends. 
But the lofty promises such a character 
held out were blighted by the injudicious 
conduct of his bigotted father:  With a 
sort of gloomy satisfaction, he traced the 
developement of those shining qualities, 
foreseeing that they could, directed b^ him, 
mainly assist the cause of his royal Master, 
and, in proud anticipation, he beheld in 
his son the avenger of his own wrongs, 
and the restorer of his family's greatness.

Instead of showing the youth the world 
such as it is, he filled it only with two sets 
of beings, both of his own creation :  the 
adherents to the prescribed Monarch, who 
were invested with every lofty, generous 
attribute, and their opponents described 
but as a grovelling, treacherous, despicable, 
detestable race. 
The Revolution certainly presented where- 
with to call forth all the chivalrous feelings 
of a noble-minded youth, when contempla- 
ting the downfall of Royalty, the brutality 
to the fair sex, and the degradation of rank. 
The Count ably availed himself of such 
topics to inflame his imagination, but he 
went too far. The fiery mettle of his son 
needed not those spurrings, best applied to 
more sluggish dispositions : the conse- 
quence was, that his high-souled enthusiasm

assumed the features of a dark, ferocious, 
fanaticism. 
The Senior directed its energies chiefly 
against the reigning French emperor; 
whom, with all the exaggeration of bigotry 
and hatred, he described as an apostate 
from his religion, a hateful monster, a bloody 
tyrant, the oppressor of France, the scourge 
and opprobium of the human race.  He 
gave the youth to believe that he was^re- 
destined one day to act as the Restorer of 
his king, the Saviour of his country and 
the Avenger of his family. 
Amongst the methods devised, in order 
to indulge his own impotent hatred and to 
feed the ardour of his son, one deserves to 
be particularized.  He contrived and set 
up the effigy of Napoleon, placed it in 
perilous situations; then, amidst the most

raging tempestuous weather, he would 
send him forth with sword and pistol to the 
destruction of the Usurper. Thus the 
Rhociian knight,* by degrees, brought his 
mastiff to attack an enormous serpent, 
which then infested the island, by previous- 
ly training the animal to fly at and tear its 
resemblance to pieces. 
Such atrocious representations, (the last 
of which Domville witnessed) certainly led 
to the practice of assassination ; his sister, 
aware of the dangerous tendency, vainly 
strove to dissuade her father : with grief 
she also beheld the alteration in his appear- 
ance and disposition. He became inattentive 
to his dress, wasted apace, the fair face of 
nature lost its exhili rating influence over

him ; the gay brilliant emanations of his 
fancy, which gave so animating a tone 
to his conversation and often electrified his 
hearers, were all fled, succeeded by such 
gloomy conceptions as a mind, incessantly 
brooding over the same dismal objects, 
could beget. The sombrous coloring 
acquired an additional darkening from the 
perusal of the most exaggerated accounts of 
the revolutionary horrors his father was 
sedulous of placing before him, and by 
daily reviewing those pictures, representing 
executions of the martyrs to the Royal 
cause, that covered the walls of their 
dwelling. 
How often is the proud and reasonable 
expectation, arising from promising child- 
ren, baffled by the injudicious conduct of 
parents, whether their motives be swayed

by avarice, bigotry or any other vicious 
propensity !  Thus the thriving youthful 
tree, transplanted in ungenial soil, is for 
ever checked in its vigorous vegetation. 
The caterpillar feeds on its buds, the 
ground is strewed with its blighted blossoms, 
rough and knobby is its once sleek and 
shining bark, cankered each branch, and 
the promise of an abundant crop is reduced 
to a few unsightly, stunted, tasteless fruit, 
here and there apparent, on its almost 
leafless sprays. 
The latter part of 1812 was marked by 
the retreat of Napoleon from Moscow, the 
subsequent annihilation of his immense 
army, and the consequent defection of his 
then allies. The hopes of the French 
Royalists once more revived, and the result 
of the battle of Leipsic, which was fought 
the next year, by enabling the combined

armies to invade old France, actually re- 
erected the standard of the Bourbons, round 
"which the more loyal and active emigrants 
were crowding. 
The Count now thought it high time his 
son should venture his life on the same 
sacred cause.  On the eve of the young 
Loyalist's departure, who burnt to signalize 
himself, he appeared before him, holding 
his own sword in his hand. 
ff My son, accept your father's sword, as 
the best present he can make you : use it, 
in the defence and for the service of your 
king, encrust it with the blood of his 
enemies : it will need no other ornament." 
His sister shuddered as she beheld the 
ardent youth fiercely grasp the weapon.  
When taking an affectionate leave of him, 
in their father's absence, she slided a paper 
into his hand. He saw her tears, partly

who penned this letter, give it an attentive 
perusal." 
" I will, Louise, I will, and this very 
night.  God bless my sister for the many 
blessings she has conferred on me.' , 
The Count sat up late with his son, in 
order to furnish him with numerous 
credentials and to give him his parting 
directions, he was no sooner gone, than the 
youth drew near the light and read that 
which will be found in the next chapter.

My Dear Brother, 
The voice of your sister, from whom you 
have never before parted, you will for some 
time no longer hear : attend, therefore, 
with kindness to the suggestions I would 
have hesitated to deliver, well aware of my 
inexperience, were they not in conformity 
with the precepts of our beloved, departed, 
Mother. 
Let not the stern injunctions of one 
parent efface the benign impressions we 
both received from her who gave us being. 
I believe the cause in which you are going 
to fight is a just one, as such, may it

retaliate against us with the same unrelent-

The present generation has not participated 
in the misdeeds of its predecessor : besides, 
civil dissentions are like the quarrels of 
families : right and wrong do not side ex- 
clusively with either party  they have all 
something to be forgiven. Therefore, 
Henry, he true to your king, but be 
merciful to your unarmed foes.

The recovery of their estates and personal 
distinctions was almost exclusively the 
moiive that led them to battle; nor could 
he conceal from himself that, to obtain these 
privileges, they had joined the armies of 
foreigners, carrying* fire and sword for 
the devastation of their mother country ; 
and that, in short, belying his father's 
favourable representation of them, they 
were like the rest of men, no better 
than their neighbours. His fervour hourly 
abated : he had been taught to identify the 
interests of the king with those of his 
country : he now saw them in a quite 
separate light. Thus, by an inconsistency 
more apparent than real, he began in his 
heart to side with that cause, for the ex- 
tirpation of which, he had so ardently 
volunteered his services. 
On the other hand, if Napoleon ever

appeared a great man, it was during this 
campaign, the unsuccessful termination of 
which sent him, a dethroned Exile, to the 
Island of Elba. With his small army he 
every where faced the numerous forces of 
the enemy ; almost every day was engaged 
in some fight, and every day gained some 
advantage :  he forced them to retreat, 
boldly threw himself in their way and cut 
off every communication with their own 
supplies, leaving them the option either 
again to advance or fight their way back 
into their own countries. They offered to 
negotiate : he would not listen to any 
proposition, till they had evacuated France. 
The allied army once more pushed on to 
Paris ; whether this movement was an act 
of desperation or, more probably, in con- 
sequence of some secret intelligence, it, 
however, terminated the campaign and the

war. Buonaparte had provided for the 
emergency of their advance; but, when he 
overtook the allies in sight of Paris, sure of 
having so completely surrounded them 
that their unconditional surrender must be 
the consequence, the army he had left in 
front and for the defence of that capital 
had itself surrendered without a battle, and 
Paris was capitulating. Thus, to use the 
words of Sir Robert Wilson, he lost his 
crown by the very series of manoeuvres 
that should have preserved it to him. 
During this rapid succession of events, 
Henry became more and more disgusted 
with his situation : his opinions respecting 
men and measures were completely re- 
versed, every passing transaction justified 
in his opinion a dereliction from one party 
and the adoption of another ; he perceived 
his father had deceived him, and he abated

tiuich of the high estimation in which he 
formerly held his wisdom and experience. 
That exaggeration of which he had been 
the dupe, being now detected, had the 
usual effect : it propelled his mind into a 
contrary direction. With the determina- 
tion that generally marks the proceedings 
of strong characters, he seceded from the 
emigrants cause, left the army and, a re- 
publican rather than a Buonapartist, wan- 
dered over France, more a spectator than 
an actor in the sanguinary drama. The 
sword, which was to have afforded such 
mighty assistance to royalty, remained 
inert in its scabbard, except when oc- 
casionally drawn for the protection of in- 
dividuals, against the pillage of un- 
authorised free-booters.

attending" his son, and sharing in the hard- 
ships and dangers of the war. He was 
compelled to remain near London, under 
the care of his daughter, to whom he 
ought chiefly to ascribe his recovery. 
She attended to all his wants, solaced his 
solitary hours, soothed his impatience, 
cheered him when languid and by her 
sensible, timely, expostulations, kept with- 
in bounds the intemperance of his fretful 
disposition. 
Of Henry's disappearance from the 
standard of the royalists, Louisa had only 
received a short intimation, in which he 
stated that a complete change in his 
opinions required a corresponding altera- 
tion in his conduct ; but of one thing she 
might rest assured : whatever fortunes 
should betide him, his heart would ever 
be unalterably her's. She had also in her

the young man's commanding officer ; the 
contents of which she rightly guessed at, and 
wisely withheld from her father, till he 
was able to bear the shock the intelligence 
would give him. 
The rage that possessed the old gentle- 
man on the perusal was commensurate to 
his conception of the offense and, before 
he was well recovered from his illness, he 
hastened with his daughter to France, 
in quest of his strayed offspring.

BUT a considerable time elapsed before 
any intelligence could be obtained of the 
youth. As soon as the place of his abode 
was ascertained, the Count posted after 
him. The method he took to bring* him 
back to his duty was of a piece with the 
rest of his conduct, and proved how little 
acquainted he was with the real character 
of his son.

Henry de Solignac, one evening, in the 
only cabaret of a small country place, was 
listening with a sympathizing attention to 
the animated relation, which a mutilated 
campaign worn veteran was delivering 
over his pipe and jug : he had already gone 
through the battles of Gemappe and Lodi, 
and was just entering upon that of Ulm, 
when three strangers alighting from their 
smoking steeds, the principal, heading the 
two others, entered the room. Henry beheld 
the stern apparation of his father who,casting 
a contemptuous glance around, and spying 
the inheritor of his name and honors in such 
low company, angrily ordered his attend- 
ance into an apartment adjoining. 
The young man complied. He arose, 
self-collected, yet not in the most dutiful 
disposition, and awaited the bursting of the

impending storm, determined not to suffer 
himself to be beaten down by its rage. 
The altercation that followed is such as 
no writer, who entertains a becoming re- 
spect for the relative situations of father 
and son, would commit to paper but in 
general terms. 
When the Count found that Henry 
had sufficient hardihood to withstand the 
terrors of his wrath, he tried the power of 
reasoning. Here again he was baffled ; 
the arguments he adduced were repelled by 
arguments equally cogent. Then followed 
reproaches, recriminations, threats, denun- 
ciations. Then, previous to the adoption 
of coercive measures, the senior's ultima- 
tum was delivered in the shape of a stern 
command, to return instantly with him, 
which was rebutted by the youth's deter-

mination, expressed in a tone equally posi- 
tive, that be would remain where he was. 
Now besran actual hostilities. The Count 
hurried to the door, ordered in the two 
soldiers and bade them secure, in the 
king's name, that rebel, that deserter, 
and now their prisoner. 
The young man stood upon his defence ; 
a violent scuffle ensued,' in which the in- 
mates of the house, much more partial to 
Henry than to the white cockades in the 
soldiers's hats, took an active part against 
them. In consequence of this timely rein- 
forcement, the assailants were overpowered 
and very roughly handled. Solignac had 
much difficulty in rescuing his father from 
further outrage. 
The discomfitted, irascible Count was 
led to his horse and almost mechanically 
placed on his saddle, obviously struggling

with opposite feelings. At length rage 
prevailed  he faced his son  drew a pis- 
tol from the bolster, and pointed it against 
him. 
" Fire, cried the young man without 
flinching, you have already done your 
worst. 7 ' 
His arm dropped, the weapon fell from 
his hand : -Still he kept his eye on the 
object of his wrath ; a lived paleness over- 
spread his face, his lips quivered, as if 
speaking inwardly, and he tottered in his 
seat. Solignac sprung forward to sup- 
port him. 
" Touch me not.  Get thee gone. I 
own thee no longer," were the words, he 
uttered in a hurried, yet hollow, sepulchral 
voice, endeavouring to push him off.  The 
youth desisted and respectfully receded. 
By this time, the elder recovering from

his faintness, set spurs to his horse, and was 
soon out of sight, followed by his attend- 
ants. 
Thus disgracefully terminated the injudi- 
cious attempt to recal the youth to those 
principles of loyalty he had early imbibed, 
the acts of violence with which it was en- 
forced had the effect usual on lofty, gene- 
rous dispositions : compulsion in such cases 
ever defeats its own object. 
The Count, unsuccessful in the recovery 
of his son, might have still derived consi- 
derable alleviation in the tenderness and 
filial piety of his daughter. All this he 
disregarded, because the family name could 
only continue with the heir male. This 
fanciful consideration, to which so many of 
noble blood are besotted, out- weighed in 
his opinion all the substantial blessings 
that were daily, hourly, tendered to-hini by

by the soother of his woes, the tenderest 
nurse, the steadiest, the kindest friend that 
God ever confered on a parent in the gift of 
a child! But alas! that child was a female, 
et ccst le male qui ennoblit!  There was 
the rub ! 
The Count sought in ambition the means 
of atonement for the acuteness of domestic 
disappointments. He claimed of the king 
one of the highest offices of state, as a re- 
ward for his past services and for the 
many sacrifices he had made in the royal 
cause. To tell the truth, the situation of 
Louis was then any thing but enviable : in- 
cessamly beset by numerous claimants of 
vast pretentions, whose past services, as a 
man, he must acknowledge ; but which, as 
a king, he ought not to remunerate, he found 
his ci.it y in direct oposition to his gratitude. 
For he more and more discovered that, in

the temper of bis newly recovered subjects, 
those bigotted Gentlemen who o use Na- 
poleon's expression, pendant cette longue 
revolution riavaient rien appris ni Hen otiblie, 
were of all others the least adapted to form 
an administration, calculated to ensure any 
stability to the present order of things. 
Louise De Clermont, never remiss in her 
duties, employed every means likely to ef- 
fect a reconciliation. To her brother she 
recommended more deference to paternal 
authority  to her father she intimated ihat 
with such a character as Henry's, violence 
would never succeed. Her advice was re- 
jected with contempt and defiance from 
the one, with equai determination, but with 
every expression of brotherly regard, from 
the other, who with shew of reason told 
her that he had now arrived at an age, 
when the laws made him master of his own

conduct; that it was his firm resolution 
never to submit its regulation to the dic- 
tates of any one and that, in the rejection 
and adoption of a party, he had only acted 
in conformity to the very sensible advice 
she had given in her letter to him. 
Louise was not discouraged. In her 
reply she earnestly besought Henry for her 
sake also, to sue for a reconciliation, alleg- 
ing that, though the laws had released him 
from the authority of a father, they could 
not absolve him from the respect and defe- 
rence due to that character. 
In a letter, replete with the tenderest ex- 
pressions of regard and with grateful 
thanks for her seasonable advice, was once 
enclosed for his father. This letter was 
thus worded.  But first we premise that,

Here a pause ensued, which was broken 
by the Count. 
" Where is the hopeful youth ?  You

immediate answer  I desire you would

" Sir, you must excuse me." 
" Indeed I will not  I again ask you

" Dutiful language this !  and, where-

" Because I ought not to give it.'* 
" Did he forbid you  did you promise ?" 
" We did neither." 
" How dare you then ?"  
" My brother, Sir, is above concealment : 
it therefore behoves me the more not to ex- 
pose him to those dangers he braves."

So saving, he rushed into his closet and

The truth was that Louise could not have 
fallen upon a more untimely moment for 
the delivery of her brother's letter.

ungarded expressions that dropt from the 
king, as remote from his grasp as ever : in 
consequence, he never entered his dwelling 
in a more unconceding temper. 
The generality of men, when baffled in 
their ambitious projects, open their hearts 
to the kindly influence of domestic affec- 
tions. The Count's heart was not so 
affected :  Misfortune acted upon it, as 
frost does on those substances exposed to

CHAPTER IX. 
A PRISONER. 
ABOUT this time an event occurred so 
momentous in its nature and so rapid in 
its effects, as to strike with dismay the sur- 
rounding nations, and to revive all those 
political animosities that had so long agi- 
tated revolutionary France. 
Napoleon, escaping from the Isle of 
Elba, had set foot on the French coast,

whence, with the rapidity of a snow-ball 
gathering into an Avelanche, he was hast- 
ening to the Capital. In vain did the 
adherents to the Bourbons endeavour to 
arrest his progress, by organizing armies 
and by garrisoning fortified places ; every 
obstacle vanished at his approach: it was a 
triumph wherever he went : he, in a few 
days, recovered the whole extent of France, 
without striking a blow. The king's friends 
were hastening out of the country : Louise 
attended her father; in vain Solignac 
besought her to stay with him, in vain her 
own inclination sided with his desire, she 
knew her duty and would fulfil it. On her 
expatriated,wandering,father, sinking tinder 
the pressure of calamity and the weight of 
years, her attendance was indispensable.  
Her society could only be gratifying to her

brother, in the elation of success and in the 
vigour and buoyancy of youth. 
Painful, at the time, are the acts of self 
controul ; but the consciousness of rectitude 
imparts such sweets to the recollection that 
sorrow, when it comes, is less keenly felt, 
and enjoyment more highly relished. 
But the reign of Napoleon was as short 
lived as its rapid resumption had been 
brilliant. The loss of the battle of Water- 
loo, by causing his subsequent surrender to 
the English, seems to have finally dispos- 
sessed him of political power, and has con- 
fined within the narrow limits of St. Helena's 
rocks, that extraordinary, ambitious, in- 
dividual who, for fifteen years, filled the 
world with the fume of his exploits. 
Paris was again occupied by the allies; 
but some departments to the south still 
held out against the authority of the Bour-

bons. Several engagements took place, 
the last terminated completely in favour of 
the Royalists. 
Amongst the prisoners brought in, there 
was one, whose prowess had prolonged the 
fight and excited the admiration of his op- 
ponents. In proportion of his earnestness 
to court death, was their wish to spare 
his life ; he was at length overpowered, 
disarmed and secured, but not subdued. 
The desperate manner in which he fought 
gave reason to suppose that he had more 
at stake, in the event of the day, than 
what could be inferred from his homely 
dress, unmarked by any distinction of mili- 
tary rank. Bleeding and panting from the 
fight, he moreover attracted the regard of 
every beholder by the comeliness of youth, 
the firmness of his step, his fearless mien,

and a nobleness of courage divested of 
haughtiness, but not of defiance. Absorbed 
in his own reflections, he hardly noticed 
the objects about him.

manding officer, before whom he was

" I am."

cer, on revolving* the subject in his mind, 
thought it hardly possible but that this 
youth must be some person of distinction, 
and the homeliness of his garb a mere arti- 
fice of concealment. Under that impres- 
sion, he deemed it more advisable to refer 
the matters to his superiors, and to have 
him immediately conveyed to Paris under 
a strong escort. 
In consequence, Henry Solignac de 
Clermont was safely confined within the 
walls of the Conciergerie. 
The enthusiastic, misguided youth, had 
swelled Napoleon's triumphant Cortege, 
fought in his cause at Waterloo, was 
amongst the last that quitted the field, 
hastened to the army of reserve before 
Paris, in the vain hopes that resistance 
would be made against the rapid ap- 
proaches of the victorious army; then,

journeying southward, joined the few scat- 
tered troops that still remained embodied. 
After a series of personal exertions that 
would have subdued any constitution less 
vigorous than his own, and after having per- 
formed matchless feats of daring, he con- 
cluded his military career by becoming a 
prisoner in the hands of those, in whose ser- 
vice he had previously drawn his sword, 
being amongst the first that openly declar- 
ed and, the last that fought, for that very 
man, he had set out with a determination 
to extirpate. 
The impression made by Henry s con- 
duct and manner on the officer prompted 
the latter to transmit, with his prisoner, 
such a letter to the Minister of War, as to 
excite the attention of that statesman, 
who, therefore, determined that the youth 
should undergo a second examination in

his presence. The Count tie Clermont, 
happening to call on him, willingly 
agreed to attend, and they both, in a dark 
misty morning, repaired for that purpose 
to the Conciergerie. 
Little did the Count expect to detect his 
son in the person of the prisoner, about to 
be interrogated. But one hour before, his 
credulity had been duped by a messenger, 
who had assured him, in hopes perhaps of 
some immediate reward, that two days ago, 
he had traced the young Gentleman in some 
obscure dwelling in the vicinity of Sois- 
sons, a town situated North of Paris. 
When Henry was brought before him, a 
recognition did not immediately follow. 
The young man was much altered in per- 
son and in dress; his voice, much affected 
by the long continued hards'* ips he had 
undergone, sounded deeper, and more

hoarse : besides, the light the room afford- 
ed partook of the gloominess of the day, 
and the supposed culprit was placed at too 
great a distance from the tribunal of his 
interrogators, for his features to be dis- 
tinctly traced by the impaired optics of 
the old gentlemen, who beheld his entrance 
with a fierce grin of savage delight, such 
as marks a tyger's face, when, within the 
reach of its spring, treads the incautious 
prey. 
Thus began the Minister. 
" Young man, attend.  In reply to an 
interrogatory, in your first examination, 
you assumed the name of Fremoi  
Charles Fremoi, and refused to acknow- 
ledge any other. Is that your real name : 
the name your parents gave you ?" 
" It is not."

" That family name I call upon you to 
declare ?" 
** That name I am resolved to conceal." 
The firm determined tone of the reply 
was by the Count construed into obstinate 
insolence. He started up from his seat, hur- 
ried down the steps, approached the pri- 
soner.  
" You, audacious, rebellious, villain  
We insist upon knowing it, or that know- 
ledge shall be extorted from you." 
Henry cast a glance of defiance, then of 
astonishment on the deliverer of this intem- 
perate address  and father and son stood 
confest before each other. The flash of 
indignation now forsook the young man's 
face, his bosom swelled with other sensa- 
tions, tears were gushing in his eyes; but 
recovering from his emotion, he hastily 
drew his hand across them, and apparently

recovered his self-command. The elder, 
at first thunderstruck, now shuddered, and 
felt much more than his son the dread of 
being recognized for the parent of a rebel, 
a recreant from his Liege. He slowly re- 
treated to his seat, and did not for some 
time again interfere. 
' At least, resumed the Minister, we 
may expect to hear your reasons for with- 
holding the information." 
" That reason (for there is but one) I 
have no hesitation to avow." 
" Be so good as to state it." 
Here the Count was all attention and 
fear. 
" I conceal my family name, because it 
were unjust to involve relatives in the 
consequences of a conduct, over which they 
had no controtil." 
The Senior revived,

" Did yon, from the first, serve in the 
cause of the Usurper." 
No." 
" For whom did you previously bear 
arms ?" 
" For the present king." 
" Are you aware of the consequences to 
yourself from such an avowal." 
"I am." 
" In what corps did you then serve ?" 
Here the Count's terrors recurred. 
" For the reason, just now assigned, I 
decline answering that question." 
" It becomes now quite immaterial : you 
have already, by your own confession, sub- 
jected yourself to a court martial." 
ts Be it so. I am prepared for the result.  
Yet, I might become interrogator in my 
turn,and inquire by what right you treat me 
otherwise than as a common prisoner of war.

" Perhaps you don't know, interposed 
his father, who wished to make him under- 
stand the full danger of his situation, that 
Marshal Ney has been found guilty, and 
is condemned to be shot : the sentence is to 
be executed to morrow." 
" If so, I had much rather be the con- 
demned Marshal than any of his judges." 
" That fate he deserved for being a de- 
serter and a betrayer of his King." 
" Whatever were his political sins, he 
clearly was included in the terms, compris- 
ed in the capitulation of Paris." 
" But you, Sir, resumed the Statesman, 
cannot avail yourself even of that poor 
pretence  you were found in arms, long 
after that capitulation." 
" And if I were at large, I should still 
be in arms, so long as any could be found, 
to fight on for the liberties oi my country."

The Count lifted up his eyes in astonish- 
ment and clenched his fist in wrath.  A 
declaration so Jacobinical from the lineal 
descendant of the Clermonts !  Incredi- 
ble ! 
" One more question I put to you. I 
desire you, for your own sake, weigh 
well your answer.  You cannot but have 
accomplices;  declare who they are and 
where to be found : a remission of the 
sentence will probably be your reward for 
the truth of your declaration." 
The young man gave the Minister such 
a look.  It spoke much more forcibly than 
the most positive denial. Then proudly 
remained silent. 
" Pity, exclaimed his Interrogator, that 
such zeal and courage should have been 
prostituted in so vile a cause."

" If you think you possess either of those 
qualities, apply that remark to yourself. 1 ' 
" It were bootless to proceed in this 
examination any further, said the Minister, 
turning to his companion, he shall be im- 
mediately consigned over to the proper 
tribunal, and let him meet the fate his 
obstinacy deserves." 
The Greffier put before him the paper 
for his signature, he steadily read its con- 
tents over and, with a firm hand, sign- 
ed it with the name of Charles Fre- 
moi. 
As they were about to remove him to 
his cell, the instinct of nature was too pow- 
erful for his stern determination ; he lifted 
up his eyes towards the seat of his Interro- 
gators, and cast on his father a look, more of 
tenderness than of reproach,  it intimated 
the farewel of an eternal separation !  The

Count felt the appeal piercing his heart; 
yet could not return it: a consciousness of 
inferiority, if not of guilt, made him shrink, 
shuddering, from his glance. When he 
mustered up sufficient resolution to face the 
victim of his prejudices, he only had a few 
glimpses, as his son, his back now turned, 
and partially concealed by the attendants 
behind, was passing under the gloomy arch 
of the door which immediately after closing, 
shut him out, as if for ever, from his sight ! 
However, ere the Examiners departed, 
upon a suggestion of the Count, which he 
fearfully delivered, lest it should lead to a 
detection, the jailor was called in, and 
orders given him, that the Prisoner be 
closely confined ; no one allowed to 
speak to him ; at the same time, every 
indulgence be granted, compatible with 
the security of his person.

NEVER did a way-worn pedestrian long 
for his night's lodging wish more ardor, 
than the Count de Clermont felt a desire 
for seclusion, in order to cast off the 
courtier and to indulge the man. The 
last parting bow, squeeze and smile had 
hardly been interchanged with the state 
minister when, throwing himself iuto his-

carriage, he gave way to the intemperance 
of his feelings as they drove him home. 
He alighted without bestowing the least 
attention on his attendants about him  not 
even noticing his daughter's inquiring 
looks, as he passed by her  hurried to his 
study, shut himself in, and was visible to 
no one for the remainder of the day. 
Louise once gently tapped at the door  
he roughly bade her be gone. Blondin 
alone was allowed to attend him to his bed- 
room. 
Next morning, after a sleepless night, 
he arose in the same disposition, breakfast- 
ed by himself, and had not yet made up his 
mind how to act in this unfortunate emer- 
gen c\. 
Would it be believed ? The danger that 
threatened his son's life was not the chief 
cause of his present anxiety. His primary

consideration was how to keep the world 
ignorant of the dreadful, fact that the ho- 
nors of the Solignacs had been tarnished 
by his misconduct. 
" Good God ! that this my only male 
begotten child, the inheritor of my titles, 
the lineal descendant of a long list of noble, 
unsullied, ancestors should, in these revolu- 
tionary times, have publicly avowed him- 
self a recreant of his king and an abettor of 
jacobinism ! What a disgrace to the fam- 
ily ! What a slur on the name ! What 
a blight on the genealogical tree ! What 
a blot on the escutcheon !" 
As he was pacing up and down the 
apartment, a prey to all the torments to 
which pride and prejudice can subject their 
victims, his anxious daughter once more 
requested admittance. With some diffi-

self.  Her winning' ways, however, began 
to relax his reserve. She soon perceived 
that, for some new offence, his wrath 
agaii st her brother was raging more vehe- 
mently than ever. She ventured to inquire 
whether he was yet found. 
" Found !  Ay with a vengeance !"

" Both safe and secured.*' 
" Secured ! where ?"

facing her."

" What doom ?" 
" That, of being shot as a deserter, as a 
rebel, and what is worse, he deserves his 
death."

And, hastily passing by her, he left her 
in a state of stupefaction from which, how- 
ever, she aroused herself and, suppressing 
every outward symptom of grief, prepared 
to wait upon him in that abode of misery, 
in order to afford what consolation she 
could bestow. But the Count, soon return- 
ing, aware of her intention, snatched up 
both her arms, and placing her before him, 
he fixed his keen inquisitive eye on her 
face, his own spread over with a livid, 
additional, paleness, and reproachfully 
inquired, whether she intended to complete 
the dishonour brought on his house by the 
infamous conduct of her brother. 
" What dishonour, Sir, can possibly 
ensue by my performing a sister's duty, 
where that duty is so much needed.  Indeed, 
it were worse than dishonourable to act 
otherwise/'

" What, cried the Senior, stamping the 
ground in a rage, Solignac is about to be 
brought to a court martial as a rebel, under 
an assumed name, and you are going to 
proclaim to the whole world that this rebel 
is your brother and heir to the house of 
Clermont I" 
This speech discovered at once to Louise 
the motive that had engrossed her father's 
solicitude at this momentous crisis. Her 
tears, which as vet fortitude had enabled 
her to repress, now flow 7 ed unchecked, 
provoked by the lack of parental feeling in 
this unnatural parent. 
<e Is this, cried she reproachfully, a time 
for the paltry distinctions of rank, when a 
violent death awaits your own offspring?" 
" Heaven be praised, he is not known 
as such yet. I fervently hope he never 
will."

" Do you intend to disown him ?" 
" He has very properly disowned himself. 
Of all his acts, since he left me, this the only 
one in which I recognize my own 
blood." 
" I will never be a party to so unnatural 
a compromise. If he is to die, I will not 
quit him.  I will attend to the place of ex- 
ecution.  They s^sall s^oot him in my arms. 
One grave will serve for both.  Soldiers 
are men.  A sister thus suing for a bro- 
ther's life, will perhaps disarm.  (Then 
looking upwards in the act of fervent pray- 
er,) Yes, God in his mercy will soften 
their hearts." 
Louise was a dutiful child in the ordi- 
nary occurrences of life, but, when unusual 
cases called for decision on her part, 
she only consulted the dictates of her reason 
and the suggestions of her heart ; if these

pointed one way, in that way she would 
firmly and undeviatingly persevere : her 
father knew this by experience. In order 
to pacify her, he gave her to know, that 
no access could be granted to the prisoner. 
That he should obtain admittance to-mor- 
row, when the court martial would have 
closed its investigation, and that, the next 
day, he would obtain for her a permission 
to see him and to remain some hours with 
him. He besought hei\ in the mean time, 
to keep concealed the cause of her grief, 
and not reveal to the world the disgrace that 
had so cruelly visited them. 
To this rational injunction, Louise sub- 
mitted, and waited with all the resignation 
she could command to-morrow's awful 
decision, not, however, without indulging 
a latent hope that it would prove much 
more favourable than her father seemed to

anticipate. And here she must be acquit- 
ted of the charge of entertaining unreason- 
able expectations : for, with her intimate 
knowledge of her brother's character, how 
could she suppose that he had, so widely and 
so soon acted in contradiction of his lofty 
notions of rectitude, as to commit any deed 
that should deservedly induce his judges to 
pass sentence of death upon him.

sentence was such as the reader is already 
apprized of; the execution to take place on 
the sixth day after this. This sentence it 
was thought politic not to remit, for the

sake of discipline, on the ground that his 
execution, combined with that of Marshal 
Ney, would not fail being 1 considered as an 
awful warning to every rank of the French 
army. 
The Count soon received the fatal in- 
formation. Under the colour of some 
specious pretence and without exciting any 
suspicion, as to the degree of affinity in 
which he stood to the prisoner, he had 
obtained a general permission to visit him. 
Louise who watched his every motion whilst 
he tarried in the house, with a tremulous 
voice and tearful eye, tendered him a folded 
paper, which she besought him to deliver to 
her unfortunate brother. Since she was 
not allowed to attend him immediately, the 
perusal, she said, might afford him some 
consolation, during the time she was 
prevented from seeing him. This he

promised to do : then in a plain dress 
and otherwise disguised, he through the 
postern gate stepped into a hackney coach, 
and was driven to the prison. 
With every endeavour to conceal the 
father, which a long practice in the art of 
dissimulation hardly enabled him to do in 
the present instance, he inquired after the 
youth and was in consequence conducted to 
his cell. He found him sitting on a stone 
bench, bending over his knees in a medita- 
tion so intense, that the intrusion did not 
appear to disturb him. His face was 
turned from the light that fell a slant in the 
room, as if he were courting deeper glooms 
than those his prison afforded. The Count 
stood watching him even some time after 
the door had closed, and when he attempted 
to speak, some indescribable sensation 
denied him utterance.  His son, looking

" Who are you, Sir?  Are you also one 
condemned to death for doing- his duty,  
or perchance some wretch placed here to 
worm out what secrets I may have ?  I am 
told there exists such villains."

" I beseech you, Father, one word,

The elder returned, he listened with anx- 
ious suspense, in hopes that the youth was 
relenting. 
" Ere I quit this life, resumed Henry, 
with an emotion he did not attempt to con- 
ceal, there is one I ardently desire to hear 
from and, if possible, to fold in my arms. 
Where is Louise ?  How is my sister?" 
" Ta sceur, replied the Count with a 
fierceness proportionate to his disappoint- 
ment.  Ta sceur! Tu n'en as plus. Elle 
fait comme moi. Elle te renonce." 
So saying*, he hurried from his son and 
left him, at that time, the most wretched of 
human beings in this world of sorrows. 
Iteft of every other external solace, he 
had cherished the hope that his sister, who 
knew his motives would approve his con-

duct and sympathize in his feelings. Her 
former letter, every line of which his me- 
mory still retained, seemed to countenance 
that belief; and now he was told that, at 
this dreadful moment, within a few days 
of his death, that stay, the only one on 
which he fondly rested, was removed from 
him. She, it seems, also sided with his 
father, and reprobated that line of conduct 
that had subjected him to the fate of a con- 
victed criminal !  Yet hope in his bosom 
still lingered. 
" Surely before my last day closes,, 
she will visit me in prison, she will hear 
me, recall her censure and weep for having 
wronged me."

throbbed at any sound that bore the faint- 
est indication of approaching steps ! How 
depressive the many disappointments !

Hope fainter and fainter revived  and 
sickened more and more. But, when ano- 
ther day had gone by and no friendly 
voice broke in upon his ear, no female 
form gladdened his sight, no sisterly, con- 
soling, endearments cheered his drooping 
spirits, no human being to feel for his 
situation and, for a short time, to par- 
take of the gloom of his solitude. This 
total abandonment unmanned him ; the 
weakness of nature prevailed ; his forti- 
tude forsook him ; the cruelty of her 
neglect wrung his heart, and tears in 
abundance gushed from his eves. 
To this effusiou succeeded the most 
gloomy abstraction.  Abandoned by the 
world, the ties that held him to it were 
fast severing, and he finally sunk into a 
desponding apathy, hardly conscious of

" Whatever interest I can command I 
would have employed, even at the risk of 
committing myself : but the infernal prin- 
ciples he has imbibed he still retains. Nor 
could I obtain from him even a promise of 
dissembling them.  Surely never was a 
parent so cruelly circumstanced. But, by 
Heaven, if he is to live, he shall not dis- 
grace my house  the family I sprung 
from.'' 
Louise, with grief, perceived the failure 
of those hopes she had indulged  namely, 
that the dreadful situation of the son would 
have subdued the inflexibility of the father ; 
and that the voice of nature could have 
silenced that of prejudice. 
" And my letter, Sir ?*' 
What letter ?"

" Why, said he, searching for it, in my

occasion for it : you may as well preach to

" Good heavens, he will now suppose 
that I have also forsaken him,  I will

" You shall not stir hence.*'

She now knelt to him, in order to obtain 
his assent. 
" I beseech you, Sir, indulge me in this

things to attend to than all such female 
winnings." 
And he broke from her  she followed 
him to the outer room: and in her attempt 
to detain him, caused the scene described 
by Madame Jodelle.  In consequence, that 
night, next day and a part of the following 
morning, she was at intervals delirious \ and 
though much abatement ensued, she was 
not able to act for herself before that 
morning was far gone, when Mr. Domviile 
presented his letter of introduction to the 
Count. 
That gentleman no sooner went away, 
than she appeared before her father. She

was arrayed in deep mourning * her air, 
step and manner solemn, firm and decisive, 
yet her voice tremulous in its sound. 
" Sir, I think it right to inform you, that 
I am going to visit my condemned brother 
in his cell.  Your violence has for nearly 
two days prevented me from fulfilling* that 
most sacred, paramount, duty. Good God !

wretchedness has your unkindness inflicted 
on both him and me,'' 
Louise, I charge you beware." 
" Sir, I also inform you that henceforth, 
in whatever concerns my brother, I shall 
only be guided by my own suggestions.  A 
submission to paternal authority, at my age, 
supposes an implicit reliance in its wisdom."

" My intention however, in compliance 
with your wish, is to attend him in the

most private manner.  In order to give 
greater effect to my consolations, am I 
allowed, Sir, to add the assurance of your 
forgiveness." 
The Count, who knew his daughter too 
well, now that she was in her altitudes, as 
he called them, to entertain any expectation 
of prevailing upon her to desist, only in- 
quired how ;on^ she would be absent. 
" I shall stay with him the remainder of 
the day.  And surely, Sir, you will doubt- 
less avail yourself of what time is left, in 
order to endeavour a reprieve." 
" Louise, said the Count, haughtily, here 
is an order for admission,  but beware of 
discovering your affinity to that vagabond ; 
and (raising his voice)presume not to dictate 
to your lather." 
He then left her and she proceeded to 
the Conciergerie as before mentioned.

Although Mademoiselle de Clermont had 
seldom ventured abroad, unattended, before 
now, the timidity, the diffidence of the sex 
was discarded. All that was not real 
modesty, real virtue, vanished before the 
deep sense of the sacred obligation she 
was performing'.  She beheld the high 
walls of the prison, she passed through the 
massive ponderous gate, she heard its deep, 
sullen, sound cluse upon her, she saw the 
woe-begone objects of detention with no 
other feelings than what could be asso- 
ciated with her brother's situation. 
As she approached the cell that enclosed 
him, she nearly sunk under the pressure of 
the tumultuous sensations that assailed her. 
But when the door was unlocked, her ten- 
derness, encreasing tenfold by the sight of 
of its object, gave her new 7 strength,  She, 
unheeding every observer, flew to him, ex-

claiming 1 : my Brother! my Brother! and 
flung her arms around his neck, expecting 
the solace of a reciprocal effusion of tender- 
ness. Alas ! she only pressed to her bo- 
som a human being, sunk into a state of 
stupid insensibility. 
Her shrieks, her plaints, her imploring 
looks, her appeals to heaven, struck every 
heart but the one she wished to revive. Too 
intent upon her charge to notice any other 
object, she strove to subdue the acuteness of 
her grief, and suppressed every excess that 
would impede her endeavours to recover 
him from that alarming depression. 
It was then that she called into action 
those affectionate expressions, those tender 
caresses, those soft endearments, all the 
powerful resources of female eloquence 
in manner, voice, tears and supplications, 
in order to win her way to his heart. Such

bland ministrations and the warm chastity 
of kindred affection, to the full as powerful 
as the impassionate exclamations of a lover, 
were not ineffectual. Henry revived  and 
the noble spirit of a Hero rekindled at 
the altar of sisterly love. 
It was impossible that any unworthy 
suspicion could remain in the breasts of 
those who witnessed this scene. The 
governor with his attendants had softly 
withdrawn, fearful to interrupt, and he for- 
bidding others from interrupting, this amia- 
ble girl in the sacred functions of her duty. 
Henry now in his turn pressed her to 
his heart, threw his arms round her neck, 
sobbed in her bosom ; then wiping away 
his tears, resumed his noble port, under- 
stood and challenged the full rigour of his 
situation, determined to die worthy of her 
and of himself.

In those buoyant moments, she felt all 
the enlivening hope she would inspire her 
brother with ; every difficulty seemed to 
vanish. He forbore to depress her spirits 
by any intimation of his distrust. But 
when the hour of separation arrived, the

poignancy of grief, was too much for her-

her comforter, pointing out the expectations 
she herself had held out, with the possi- 
bility of their being realized.

of the night in writing out the packet Dom-

Doinville's presentation passed on : His 
Majesty did not honor him with any parti- 
cular notice, owing perhaps to the multipli- 
city of objects which in rapid succession pass- 
ed before him. The ceremony over, which 
to his impatience appeared endless, the 
King withdrew, was for sometime closeted 
with the British Ambassador, and our 
Hero, with a throbbing heart, awaited the 
result. 
In about twenty minutes, his Excellency 
re-appeared and singling him out, with a 
smiling countenance, told him that he 
would now do himself the pleasure of con- 
ducting him to his Majesty, who had pe- 
rused his letter, was at leisure, and very 
desirous to see him. 
" Mr. Domviile, said the Monarch,

concluded the usual obeisance, your letter

has revived scenes, many years past, with 
the remembrance of a service I ought never 
to have forgotten. I can tell your Excel- 
lency (turning to the Ambassador) that, 
when in England, I once got into an awk- 
ward sort of a difficulty, what I believe in 
English, you call a scrape : from which I 
was extricated by that Gentleman's gallan- 
try and presence of mind, highly honorable 
to both his head and heart." 
'* I beg to assure your Majesty, I should 
not have presumed to hint at such a subject, 
but for the furtherance of the very impor- 
tant commission with which I am en- 
trusted : so short is the time allowed me 
for its execution." 
" Well, Sir, indulge me with the parti- 
culars ofyour case, you never had a Hearer 
in a more favorable disposition." 
Here the Ambassador, whose penetra-

lion led him to suspect that his presence 
could be well spared, bowed and withdrew. 
When they were by themselves, after sui- 
table acknowledgments for his Majesty's 
condescension, our Hero entered upon the 
story of the young prisoner in the Concier- 
ge rie ; every particular contained in the 
packet, not omitting the scene he himself 
had witnessed, were disclosed and, while 
he admitted the misguided conduct of the 
son, he ascribed the principle share of the 
blame to his father, whose injudicious and 
fanatical precepts had produced effects the 
very reverse of those intended. He con- 
cluded by requesting a respite of the sen- 
tence, till the truth of those facts he had 
stated had been investigated by such as 
his Majesty should think fit to appoint, for 
that purpose. 
" I myself will be the investigator, cried

the Monarch good naturedly, vour narra- 
tion interests me in many ways. The 
Count de Clermont has ever been a faithful 
adherent to my cause ; but he is certainly 
bigoted to excess. His son,. I now 
recollect, being presented to me ; the 
highest expectations were entertained of 
him : I remember I was, at the time much 
struck with his air and manner, they both, 
to my conception, indicated a real, youthful, 
hero. His supposed death I did lament 
for his father's sake: to him it would have 
been a grievous loss.- But lie has a daugh- 
ter, besides a most lovely creature, I am 
told ; and as praise-worthy as she is hand- 
some." 
Here our Negociator, his face in a glow, 
stammered out some incoherent expres* 
sions.  His emotion betrayed him. 
" Ah, Domville, Monsieur Domville!

how it is  I fancy I can trace virtue, love-

line of those pages, the purport of which 
I have disclosed to your Majesty." 
Bravo, bravo! exclaimed Louis! he is 
engaged deeper and deeper still. Alas !

And he laughed heartily : Domviiie 
joined him with what face he could.  - 
Then proceeded sportively.

Indeed, Sire, unless you interpose your au-

He then wrote a few words upon a sheet 
of paper, which he delivered, folded up, 
into Domvilie's hands.

interior : It contains an order for the 
suspension of the execution. Perhaps, 
added he with a significant smile, you

executed, I expect to see you here again."

" Very good ; but, whilst you are em- 
ployed in one direction, the sooner to 
bring this good work to bear, I must be 
active in another quarter. During your 
absence I shall send for the Count; It 
were unjust to condemn him unheard : In 
that view your presence here will be neces- 
sary, in addition to the pleasure I feel in  
your society.  But, (seeing him trembling 
with impatience) time urges. Go, Sir, 
and quickly return. Happiness on such 
an occasion, cannot fail attending yoit. 
As soon as you arrive here, the bare 
delivery of your name will insure ad- 
mission. " 
The good Monarch attended our Hero 
to the head of the stairs, and with every 
token of regard suffered him to depart. 
Domville's heart beat hio-h': he hurried

from the palace, with rapid strides reached 
the office of the minister, to whom he de- 
livered his order, and from whom he readily 
obtained an assurance that it should be im- 
mediately signified to and acted upon by 
the proper officers.  He then departed and 
soon regained, not the Clermont hotel, but 
his own lodgings. Although tidings so 
very welcome may seem to authorize him 
to venture as the bearer into the presence 
of his Lady, with the delicacy of a true 
lover, he still restricted himself to the only 
channel of conveyance she had as yet 
allowed. 
Madame Jodelle was in attendance, 
trembling with anxiety and dread.  "Well, 
Sir," her agitation denied her further 
utterance. 
" Mrs. Jodelle, I am the happiest of

The laundress soon hurried away with 
the following note. 
Madam, 
I have only time to inform you 
that Mr. de Solignac's sentence is respited. 
I make no doubt that his life is not only 
spared, but that he will very soon obtain his

that I could well ask in the first instance. 
With my heartfelt gratulations for the 
fortunate termination of this affair, I have 
the honor to remain,

This done, when Madam Jodelle had 
departed, it cannot be supposed that the 
precincts of a room could contain, in such 
an emergency, any one who had the power 
of loco-motion. Our Hero after two or three 
strides hurried, elate, to the hotel of the 
British Ambassador, informed him of the 
success of his application,  poured out his 
thanks in so rapturous, so voluble, and to 
any one unacquainted with the story, in so 
incoherent, so extravagant a manner, as to 
create both astonishment and entertainment: 
then, hardly tarrying to hear any congratu- 
latory reply, hurried away, in order to take 
his station, beside the King of France, in the 
Palace of the Tuileries.

on her part, she had instigated her father 
to take some decisive steps for her brother's

rescue from the impending doom. He 
sallied out, promising* so to do. She then 
waited on several ladies, whose husbands, 
she presumed, had much influence in the

more active co-operation, she openly avow-

youth, very faint hopes of success could be 
gathered from their promises of assistance. 
She had hardly returned home, disconso- 
late and disheartened, when her good angel, 
in the shape of Madame Jodelle, brought to 
her every comfort,  every joy  by the 
production of Domville's short epistle, 
prefaced as it was by her rapturous expres- 
sions of gladness. 
Louise fell on her knees, returned fervent 
thanks to God and to him, bade her return 
immediately and assure her benefactor of

her lasting gratitude, then stepping into her 
carriage, which she had ordered to be kept 
in readiness till after her previous visits, 
she was carried with every possible speed 
to the Conciergerie. 
The Governor hastened to receive her. 
The king's order had already arrived, and, 
as he was congratulating her on that in- 
formation, he handed her into a private 
apartment, whither her brother had already 
been conducted, then respectfully bowing, 
left them together.

from the Conciergerie to the Palace. 
Never did his Majesty feel so restless as on 
the present occasion. 
The truth is, he had caught part of the 
enthusiasm that animated our Englishman. 
Weary of the formal heartless etiquette of 
a court, the affecting tale he had heard 
delivered by the impassionate Narrator was 
as congenial to his feelings, as a bland May 
morning is refreshing to the spirits of those, 
long pent up in the tense atmosphere of a 
crowded room. His share in the good 
action about to be performed delighted him, 
and his heart prompted him to the adoption 
of the best manner of performing it. 
Everlasting gratitude to the Author of 
our being ! who has infused into acts of be- 
neficence the sweetest, purest, most exqui- 
site, most lasting delight, and who has 
placed in their commission that which

approximates Man nearest to HIM!  Who- 
ever peruses these pages, let hi in foster 
and cherish to the end, and by practice 
entertain in all its caloric, the celestial 
attribute. It will relieve the prosperous 
from the apathy attendant on constant 
enjoyment,  cheer the wretched in the 
hour of affliction,  enliven the decline of 
age,  prolong the life of the soul to the 
end of its terrestrial existence, and fit it for 
a state of bliss hereafter. 
Domville, who at that time felt its full 
ethereal essence, returned to the Monarch 
ere the Count's arrival. The latter in 
compliance with his daughter's entreaties 
and, we hope, with the concurrence of his 
own heart, had been making some attempts 
to obtain the intercession of a nobleman, 
high in the king's confidence ; but in so 
guarded a manner, as if he were cantiously

proceeding to lay siege to a place, for- 
tified by the skill of a Vauban. He had 
left the great man, not altogether satisfied 
with the tone which the assurance of support 
was given in ; and was strolling up and 
down the great avenue, forlorn and unde- 
cided how to act, when he received his 
Master's mandate. 
He was announced just at the time when 
Henri de Solignac was in attendance. 
This latter the king directed to be conducted 
into an adjoining closet and gave orders for 
the Count's admission,  As this nobleman 
made his entrance, onr Hero, who viewed 
him with no very friendly feelings, stepped 
aside.  Thus abruptly began the Monarch. 
Monsieur le Comte,  I have just learned, 
in a very fortuitous manner, of your son's 
disappearance. This information I cannot 
say that I received with regret, because as
## p. 211 (#219) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 211 
I always understood that he had perished, 
fighting in our cause, the present calamity 
is not so irremediable as absolute death.  
Say, Sir, for you can but tell, is my inform- 
ation correct?" 
" Sir, said the Elder, starnmeringly, my 
son certainly disappeared to my most vex- 
atious grief. 1 ' 
" Doubtless you made every exertion to 
trace him." 
" I certainly did : but  but, after all to 
very little purpose." 
M In that case we have been more fortu- 
nate than you. This gentleman can tell 
where he was to be found this morning, 
and I can tell you where he is now.  
Speak, Sir,  in what part of the world is 
the present residence of Solignac de 
Clermont." 
" Here Domville advancing replied :

212 MAZES OP LIFE. 
" If my information be correct, and I 
have every reason to believe it is so, he has 
been and was this morning a prisoner in the 
Conciergerie." 
The Count sprang back, uttering an ex- 
clamation of surprise. 
" For what imputed crime is he detained 
a prisoner, resumed the King." 
As having been taken in the act of fight- 
ing against your Majesty's troops, for which 
he has been condemned by a court-martial 
to be shot, the execution to take place 
to-morrow. " 
" Were yeu apprized of these circum- 
stances before, Count ?" 
" Alas, Sire, they are but too true." 
" What steps have you taken to avert 
the execution of the sentence ?" 
The Father thus stammered out his reply, 
conscience struck :

" I cannot say, but  that  I  I,  then

de Blancas, who has promised me the bene- 
fit of his interference." 
" Did you ever see the youth, resumed 
the King to Domville." 
" Only once." 
" Where was that ?" 
u In a lonely place in North Wales, 
called the Hermit's cave." 
" Was his father then present ?" 
Yes, Sire." 
De Clermont, do you know that Eng- 
lish Gentleman ?" 
" I had the honor of his visit, I believe, 
the day before yesterday." 
44 Did you ever see him befcre?"

" If I did, I assure your Majesty that 
my memory fails me." 
" He relates a strange story of which he 
asserts being a witness, I mean the singular 
device you adopted, in order to bind your 
son to the same cause you have ever so zea- 
lously supported." 
" I am certainly much beholden to that 
gentleman's officiousness in interfering with 
my family's concerns: yet I do not know 
by what right or by what information, 
he" 
" Sir, interrupted the king sternly, when 
a parent neglects his most sacred duty \ it 
is fitting that some one else should perform 
it in his stead.  Do you admit the truth of 
the story ?" " I need not, I believe, 
repeat it." 
" Sire, whatever I then did, and have

done, has invariably been to promote the 
cause of my -Sovereign." 
"1 believe you, Count; but, in this 
instance, you never could have devised 
worse measures for the fulfilment of your 
intentions. Yet there may be some mistake 
in all this. Let us see if we cannot esta- 
blish the fact, beyond the possibility of 
deception." 
So saying", he stepped into the closet ; 
but in addition to the Prisoner, he found 
unexpectedly another person, the presence 
of whom, however, delated his appearance 
but a few moments. The Count, all the 
while, in trembling expectation, knew not 
what to surmise.  The King entered first. 
" Monsieur le Comte, cried he, his coun- 
tenance beaming with benevolence, we are 
doubly fortunate. Instead of one, here are 
both your children.  Venez, awn Jeune

Then appeared with Henry, handed in 
by her Sovereign, his lovely sister ! As she 
courtesied on her admission, her face and 
neck glowed with blushes.  The parent's 
astonishment was great, that of Domville 
extreme,  his delight no less so. 
The flower bud he had beheld in the 
Hermit's Cave was now blossoming in all 
its beauty : in the Palace of the King of 
France, in his private apartment, and in 
his Majesty's presence, he beheld, for the 
first time, its expansion. 
The Monarch looked around him with 
ineffable delight, conscious that of the 
blessings about to be conferred he was the 
dispenser.  Thus he broke the silence 
that prevailed.

" De Clermont, say. Is this youth your 
lost Son, or is it only Charles Fremoi ?" 
" Sire, it is my own son.'' 
" Then you own him as such." 
" If your Majesty's goodness can forgive 
the crime he has committed. " 
" I have committed no crime, interrupted 
Henry firmly/' 
His father stared, Louise shuddered at 
his boldness, Domville knew not whether 
to blame or to praise him. 
" Right my Friend, observed the King 
mildly, you may have erred ; but, as the 
intention was pure, your heart is not cri- 
minal. Indeed, Monsieur le Comte, your 
zeal for my service has hurried you into ex- 
tremities far more blamable. A diadem is 
a worthless object in my sight, were it to be 
gained by such means.  Now for the re- 
pairing of all this mischief. By the favor

of this Gentleman, I am acquainted with 
every particular. Furnished with that 
knowledge, I hereby annul all the proceed* 
ings of the Court Martial.  De Solignac, 
you are free. All France is open to you : 
you may stay in it or leave it, just as it 
suits your inclination. " 
Henry was greatly affected a generosity 
so congenial reached his heart's inmost re- 
cess.  Yet the sternness of republican prin- 
ciples did not immediately yield to reviving 
loyalty, the inward struggle was at its 
height when the Count nearly spoiled all, 
" Come, Sir, kneel to your Sovereign, 
in thanks for his generous mercy, and pro- 
mise for the future an implicit devotion 
to his cause." 
At these words the young man drew up, 
his pride returned, and with folded arms he 
remained sullenly silent. The countenance

MAZES OF LIFE. 210 
of Louise became suddenly clouded ; she 
cast a reproachful look on her father ; and 
Domville, more violently displeased, looked 
as if he would have knocked him down, 
whilst the Count, no less wrathful, gnashed 
his teeth and clenched his cane, longing to 
apply the latter on his Son's shoulders. 
" Eli, Monsieur le Comte, cried the Mo-

" Allez,mo7ijeune Ami, je vous remets entre

Here, for the first time, Henry felt a 
suppleness in his knees; bending one, he 
respectfully held the hand the king was 
Tendering him to rise, and stooping over it, 
with a voice that bespoke his emotion; 
L 2

" Ah, Sire ! votre bonte  voire magnani- 
mite m'acable  vous avez vaincu." 
The Monarch raised him, pressed his 
hand within his, and placing himself be- 
tween brother and sister, was gallantly 
leading them out, when stopping short as 
if something remained undone, he quitted 
them, and stepping up to Domville, to 
whom he gave a significant, benevolent, 
smile, thus introduced him to the young 
Lady. 
" Mademoiselle de Clermont me permet- 
tra de lui presenter un Etranger et, toutes 
Jbis, une ancienne connaissance. Mademoi- 
selle  en declarant en votre presence les 
obligations que vous lui devez, je prends 
la meilleure methode de m'acquitter de celles

and action, in which delight, gratitude, and 
admiration were blended, pas mime vous, 
Sire.  Dieu seul pent le recompense** des 
services quit nous a rendus." 
Here the Count thought proper to put 
in his share of thanks ; but the wording 
and delivery of which, although in his best 
courtly style, sounded very cold and tame 
just after his Daughter's effusion. The 
Clermont family then departed ; but the 
King detained Domville some time longer, 
during which, he rehearsed with animation 
some of the incidents that befel him during 
his residence in England, amongst these, 
the scrape, as he called it, was again 
brought on the carpet. In the height of 
this conversation, the Minister for foreign 
affairs was announced. 
" Quoi ! cried the Monarch with a fallen, 
tueful, aspect, sitot ! et toujours accompague

And, as the state Minister entered with 
his enormous port-folio, our Hero, profuse 
in expressions of thanks and admiration, 
took his leave with feelings then partaking 
of Beatitude! 
Thua terminated an interview to which 
the pen of the Author of Waverty alone 
could have done adequate justice.

VISITS. 
AS Ladies contrive to prolong the

beyond its consummation, by rehearsing in 
their friendly morning calls the incidents 
and peculiarities connected with the deco- 
rations, the company, the dresses, the 
dance, the supper, &c. so every performer 
in the above drama, the Count excepted,

may be said to reap an aftermath of satis- 
faction, from a retrospection of the inter- 
esting subject that gave so much play to 
the heart's best feelings : even Madame 
Jodelle, without any scruple, took for her 
share more glee than she was entitled to 
from the subordinate part allotted to her. 
For that day and the next, Louisa and 
her brother were almost inseparable com- 
panions : the transient shudderings excited 
by a recollection of their past dangers, 
only enhanced the enjoyment of their pre- 
sent felicity. Domville was all life and 
soul ; and his Majesty's cheerfulness was 
expanded over the faces of his courtiers, at 
the same time, they remarked that he was 
never known to have been so absent.  
Doubtless, during such abstraction, he was 
no less delightfully engaged. 
About noon of the third day, an equi-

page, containing the Count with his son 
and daughter, stopped before Renaud's 
house, the footman, alighting, enquired after 
Mr. Domville, who unfortunately happened 
to be absent. The fact was, that for 
reasons best known to a lover, he had been 
taking his morning meal in the very coffee- 
house that fronted the Count's hotel, and 
had in consequence the felicity of seeing 
Mademoisele Louise Adelle de Clermont 
step into this identical carriage, little aware 
of its destination. A card was then left 
and the carriage with its inmates drove 
home. So true it is, that m search of one 
gratification, we often miss a greater. 
The next morning, as he was with heart 
elate preparing to return the visit, Henry 
de Solignac being announced, he witnessed 
the entrance of a most prepossessing youth, 
such, however, as he could well conceive the 
L 5

brother of his Louise to be.  All vestiges 
of the late calamity appeared obliterated. 
Domville had seen the youthful cedar ex- 
posed to the storm and some of its branches 
shattered by its fury ; he now beheld the 
majestic stem erect, and its sprays sporting 
in the breeze that gently murmured 
among its foliage. 
* Sir, said Henry, with an ease and 
frankness of manner highly becoming, had 
-we succeeded in paying you the family 
visit we intended yesterday, it would not 
have satisfied me : and now that I am more 
fortunate in the present call, allow me, I 
beseech you, often to repeat it." 
" Sir, I feel too sensibly the honour you 
and the Count intended doing me, to omit 
returning you my respectful acknowledge- 
ments. I was just going to wait on you 
for that purpose.' '
## p. 227 (#235) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 227 
" Then, Sir, I will at your leisure 
attend you to our bouse. I am impatient 
to present my sister to you,  She is as desi- 
rous as I am of expressing her gratitude to 
her brother's deliverer ; and I am proud in 
acknowledging" you as such." 
This sort of introduction over, the Gentle- 
men conversed for a short time on indifferent 
topics : they then proceeded to the Count's 
hotel. During their walk, what reserve 
remained was fast wear ins: off. As if 
Solignac guessed the secret wish of Dom- 
ville, he said, on shewing him into a parlour; 
" My father is, I believe, occupied in 
"his study, in the mean time, I will just- 
step out and call Louise." 
Our Englishman, the few minutes he was 
left to himself, felt all the variable sensa- 
tions of hope and fear : his heart beat high, 
his face was in a glow, it then grew pale^

228 MAZES OF LIFE. 
and his pulse hardly told : the ardour of 
desire and the chill of despondency produced 
alternately the fever and the ague. This 
-violent conflict was suspended on the 
entrance of the young* Lady, ushered in by 
the brother : respect; admiration and love, 
next to adoration, now took possession of 
his soul. 
Louise stepped up to him, her lovely 
features expressive of the most grateful, 
benevolent, sensations for the signal service 
he had done her. 
" Mr. Domrvllle,  behold us both, from 
the most dreadful calamity, restored to 
each other, happy and increasing in happi- 
ness, all through your means.  We cannot, 
(and tears gushed in her eyes) You must 
be your own Remunerator." 
Our Hero, bowing, would have replied, 
and with strict truth, that he was already
## p. 229 (#237) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE 229 
greatly overpaid, but his emotion denied 
him utterance, and bending- over the 
lily hand held out to him, he ventured with 
his lips.  Let your Sensualists extol their 
grosser pleasures ; he felt a more exquisite 
delight in that slight favour, than they ever 
obtained during the completion of their 
desires. 
" Sister, interposed Henry, let us not 
distress Mr. Domville with the warmth of 
our acknowledgments. He who can per- 
form such acts, may well judge of our 
feelings towards him. ,, 
They then sat down, and a delightful 
conversation followed on subjects interest- 
ing to each. Henry astonished our more 
phlegmatic Englishman with the rapidity, 
the fervour, the boldness of his conceptions. 
The Count made his appearance much too 
soon. They rose, and he, in his turn, paid
## p. 230 (#238) ############################################
230 MAZES OF LIFE. 
his compliments to our Hero. They were 
internally better received than those he 
addressed to him in the king's apartment, 
because more heartily felt and delivered. 
On his arising* to take leave, he was 
requested to stay dinner and to spend the 
evening with them. So warmly was he 
pressed by the son to consent, and so readily 
he flattered himself he read a similar in- 
vitation on the daughter's countenance, that 
he, indulging his own inclination, most 
willingly complied. 
This day of tranquil felicity soon fled : 
Domville reluctantly took his leave. He 
departed with every disposition to friend- 
ship for Solignac and with love for Miss 
de Clermont, in all its mighty sway, ruling 
his heart. 
Next day, Henry paid him another visit. 
He was commissioned, he said, by his
## p. 231 (#239) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 231 
father to request the favour of his company 
to an entertainment, the Monday following'. 
u We all indulge a hope, he was pleased to 
add, that He, whom we should hail as the 
principal guest, will not deny us the 
pleasure of his presence. " 
Domville assured him truly that he 
would, for his own gratification, accept the 
invitation. In a day or two he called 
again at the hotel, and was immediately in- 
troduced to the ^oung lat!y and gentleman m y 
a most agreeable morning he spent in their 
compan y , the father happening to be absent. 
He felt the effects of Louise's charms as 
powerfully as ever, and Henry, giving way 
to his flow of spirits, to his brilliant con- 
ceptions, to his unstudied eloquence, des- 
canted at large on ethics, religion and 
politics : with the help of these mighty 
materials, he erected a most seductive

Utopia : yet it was amusing to hear him, 
reigning* in at length his enthusiasm, con- 
clude by declaring with a rueful aspect, 
that he apprehended several ages must 
elapse, before mankind could be prepared 
for the adoption of that beneficial code, he 
had been just before so warmly recom- 
mending to their practice. However, on 
comparing the matter and manner of 
his delivery, in this sitting with the previous 
one, it was perceptible that his fougue had 
been already somewhat tempered by the 
chastening wisdom of his sister : a circum- 
stance that tended to raise the lady still 
higher in her lover's estimation. 
Thus agreeably with Domviile went on 
each day ; he had besides the prospect of a 
most delightful one on Monday next.  
How his imagination revelled in anticipa- 
tion.  He beheld in fancy His Queen,
## p. 233 (#241) ############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 233 
and the queen of every beholder, receive 
the homage, the allegiance of her subjects ; 
whether she made them her own by her 
affability, subdued them by her beauty, 
controuled them by her superior sense, or 
awed them by her virtue.  Out of the 
crowd of admirers, he was already distin- 
guished by his services.  Oh ! were his 
love as fervently noticed, his felicity would 
be complete ! 
The day intended for her inauguration 
and his delight arrived. At an hour un- 
usually early, Henry de Solignac was 
announced; as he entered, his dress and 
manner foreboded every thing but festivity. 
He came, he said, in order to apologize, 
if an apology were necessary, for the un- 
fortunate cause that compelled him and his 
sister to deny themselves the pleasure of 
Mr. Domville's and their other friends

company on this day.  Last Saturday, his 
father had been taken suddenly ill : they 
had hoped that the complaint would have 
been easily removed, but it increased ever 
since ; from the most alarming symptoms, 
they had every reason to fear that the 
patient could not hold out twenty-four 
hours longer. 
Domville, sympatbyzing in his concern, 
requested to know the origin of this com- 
plaint. 
" The origin, replied Henry warmly, 
has dwelt in his heart ever since he was a 
man : it has at length overpowered a con- 
stitution otherwise robust. Ah, my Friend! 
it is not from you that we should conceal 
any thing. Ambition has been the con- 
stant pursuit and bane of his life. Up to 
his dying moments, he has been expecting 
to sit at the helm of the state; but the

ting, I must own, luckily for the nation 
and his own dynasty, perceives the perilous 
injustice of adopting those measures the 
violent Ultras would prescribe to him. 
Swayed by a more enlightened policy, he 
has called round his throne men who can 
deviate, on occasions, from the intolerant 
practices of the dark ages; in consequence, 
it has been signified to my poor father that 
the offer of his services could not be accept- 
ed. He returned home, you may well 
conceive how disappointed ; the rage that 
possessed him was too much for his weak 
frame.  I must draw a veil over the scenes 
that followed. He is now lying, exhausted 
from his violent convulsions and at his last 
gasp; yet, from every indication percept- 
ible on his ghastly, clammy, countenance. 
From Jiis clenched fists and the quivering

of his lips, it is plain that he is still tortured 
by that Fiend who has throughout life been 
his tormentor. Had he been born a day 
labourer, he would have found many com- 
pensations for the hardships of his lot ; but, 
bred up a wealthy nobleman and cursed 
with ambition, he has known but misery.  
Adieu, my Friend, I must to Louise, not a 
moment's rest has she had,  she must be 
relieved. *' 
So saying", he hurried away and our 
Hero was left to his own reflections. He 
now beheld completely overcast that day, 
which he had hailed as the brightest in his 
calendar. 
The uncertainty of human affairs is a 
common topic for declamation ; yet to the 
instability of our situation in this world 
are we indebted for the source of our well

being : It is the parent of hope and fear.  
These are 
Life's brisk incentives, 
Which else would be but one dull, dismal, round

Like dormant waters, by heaven's breezy stirrings, 
Unvisited and unrefreshed. Anon. 
And, constituted as we are, happiness 
would become misery, were it to last for 
ever* 
However, this train of reflections did not 
prevent him from sending twice that day 
to enquire after the patient's health. The 
answers were that he was still breathing:.  
Early the next morning, he heard that the 
Count de Clermont was no more. 
Domville certainly never felt much pre- 
deliction for the old Count, too dissimilar 
were their dispositions : the rigid bigotry

of the one could not harmonize with the 
toleration, perhaps too lax, of the other. 
Yet it was the father of Henry and Louisa 
de Clermont that then had died, as such, he 
received the news of his death, as if he 
himself had lost a parent. 
The slight sensation this event created in 
the political atmosphere of the Court of the 
Tuileries could hardly be called by that 
name : nor could the sentiments entertained 
of the departed nobleman be deemed honor- 
able to his memory. By those of his own 
party he was more feared than beloved, and 
by their opponents more hated than feared : 
and so little was a life, out of which fifty 
years were spent in actual services, missed 
by the world, that with the exception of his 
relatives and dependants, this staunch and 
indefatigable Royalist was forgotten by

both friends and foes, before his remains 
were consigned to the earth. 
The day after the funeral, our English- 
man went to pay a visit of condolence to 
the family. He had longed for an oppor- 
tunity, -he felt that an age had gone by 
since the presence of Miss de Clermont 
had blessed his sight. At the gate he met 
ber brother booted and spurred, in the act 
of getting upon his horse, who received 
him with every cordial demonstration.

They then shook hands : Henry began 
his journey and Mr. Domville, although 
conscious that his heart was not defended 
by any such a safe-guard as love for une 
belle Anglaise would have afforded him, 
continued rashly to venture in the presence 
of Miss de Clermont.

THE HEART ACHE. 
X HE motive for Henry's journey into 
the Country was to" ascertain the amount 
of the property left him by his father's de- 
mise. This information we will now con- 
cisely lay before the Header. 
The lust of power was not the only in- 
ducement that had prompted the late 
Count to claim a share in the then admin-

ist ration. Since the restoration of the pre- 
sent King", he had spared no expense in 
order to appear at court in a state of splen- 
dor suitable to his rank, yet of his alienated 
estates but an inconsiderable portion had 
been recovered. His chief endeavours, in 
conjunction with the other Ultras, was to ob- 
tain from the Throne the promulgation of 
anEdict,tend\ng to declare illegal the former 
sale of the national domains : the effect of 
which would have probably enabled him to 
recover the possession of his immense terra- 
tori al property. Wiser counsels were fol- 
lowed, so that the disappointed Count, on 
the rejection of his tendered services and 
the dismissal of many of his party, perceived 
at once the full extent of his calamity. 
Instead of stepping into power, as a prelude 
to the regaining of his affluence, he sud- 
denly became a powerless, ruined man.

This double mortification proved too much 
for his weak frame.  He sunk under it. 
When the present Count de Clermont, 
or Henry de Solignac, as we shall still con- 
tinue to call him, had collected every in- 
formation that could elucidate his affairs, 
he readily and cheerfully, but without the 
bustle of ostentation and with his sister's 
full concurrence, followed that course 
which honesty, in its widest latitude, pre-

on earth they could now call their own,

But it is high time we should return to 
Domville. Indeed, so far as we have gone, 
we fear that professed Critics will accuse us 
of having mistaken the Hero of the tale, 
and thai our Hero is no hero at all. To 
which latter charge we, at once, plead   
Guilty, 
The opportunity our Englishman had of 
viewing Miss de Clermont in some of the 
most trying and interesting situations in 
which a young female could be placed, had 
given stability to his affection, rooted as 
it was in that esteem, which is deiived 
from every moral consideration a sane 
judgment could form. But, in addition 
to the usual diffidence of a real lover, a 
most powerful objection prevented a de- 
claration of his sentiments on his part. 
Judging from appearances, he considered 
the Lady to be in affluent circumstances :

his own he knew were the very reverse. 
Another consideration now startled him.  
Since the brother's return, his visits had 
been as frequent as before ; but the sister 
invariably abstained from making" her 
appearance. 
Whilst he was, one morning, ruminating 1 
in his chamber on that unaccountable al- 
teration in her conduct, he received the 
following letter. 
Dear Sir, 
By the time that you receive this, we 
shall be on our way from the capital. If 
we are not greatly deceived in the steadi- 
ness of our inclination, years ivVll elapse 
before we intend to re-visit it, the keen 
regret we feel in parting fro or one, who has 
done us services so very essentia), is 
much aggravated by the little probability

How often dofriendsj where they intend 
a kindness, inflict a wound! The above 
missive so stultified Domville that some 
time elapsed before he clearly understood its 
disconaolating import: neither was he im- 
mediately able to think and to act for him- 
self. On emerging from his stupor, he 
exhausted all his ingenuity in order to 
divine the motives that prompted this

departure and concealment, both so very 
unexpected ; but to no purpose. He then 
hurried to the hotel in hopes of gaining 
some intelligence. Every door was secured 
and the closed shutters showed through the 
panes their dismal, dingy, hue, except 
where placards were pasted between, 
notifying in large characters.

Thither he sped, almost hopeless of any 
intelligence, yet not knowing where else to 
apply to. 
Monsieur Noel received him with that 
sort of civility generally shewn to those 
whom we expect to deal with. It soon 
appeared, however, that there was between 
them no rallying point. The one wanted 
to dispose of the hotel, the other to hear 
from its late occupiers : they therefore very

soon parted. Yet, as trouble taken is 
seldom wholly lost, the inquirer obtained 
the information that the residence, which 
he supposed belonged to the Clermont 
family, was only a hired one. 
As his last and best resource, he now 
called on Madame Jodelle; the good 
woman was deeply grieved for the family's 
removal, but even from her the place of 
their intended residence was kept a secret. 
She had indeed heard of the sale of some of 
the property, but such particulars she was 
careful not to disclose, because she knew 
that the knowledge of similar expedients 
generally tend to lower those who resort to 
them in the estimation of their acquaint- 
ance : and she was too zealous for the credit 
of her Benefactrice, not to do her best in 
keeping up appearances.

lamentable plight, Domville spent some 
time with her in doleful confabulation, 
echoing sighs ; the one weeping, raving the 
other; alternately descanting on the amia- 
ble qualifications, moral and personal, of 
the two Absentees, in a manner not unlike 
the responses that regularly follow each 
other in a legitimate eclogue. In such topics 
pur Hero had full leisure to indulge ; his 
time was his own and, really at the present 
juncture, he was fit for nothing better. 
But our Laundress had more important oc- 
cupations compiilsorihj on her hands, to 
wit, herself and family to feed, cloth and 
shelter. The unremitting labor, indispen- 
sable for the attainment of these requisites, 
blunted the edge of sorrow, and allowed 
but little scope for its expansion.

others for his exigencies. In consequence, 
a host of griefs invaded his heart. It was 
then an open, undefended, country, easily 
over-run. 
After rambling about the city, a solitary 
being among crowds, a wretched mortal 
in the midst of its festive multitudes, he 
returned to his lodgings, shut himself in, 
and brooded for hours over his misfortunes 
as he called them, in all the luxury of 
woe. The many years enjoyment were 
over-looked, in order repiningly to dwell 
on this particular, and like all others, 
transient affliction. Like a thankless 
Receiver by whom, because one obligation 
is denied, all previous ones are deemed 
cancelled. 
Then in a wrathful fit, starting up and

reproachfully cried out.

mined on which to feed, left them both un- 
touched. So our despairingLover, unable to 
make a selection of either of these two eligi-

submit his shoulders, a little longer, to the 
intolerable burden of life.

And, in order that this same burden be

feed his melancholy thoughts, by brooding 
over the dark side of the picture, relieving 
now and then the monotony of the scene,

uttering passionate exclamations, stamping 
the boards and clenching his fists, which

It was high time such foolish pranks 
should terminate. The sense of one 
calamity is often mitigated by the effect of 
another. Some good news (for such in his 
present situation it may be termed) arrived ; 
and our old acquaintance, Counsellor 
Nathaniel Cranbourne, is the informant. 
The learned gentleman's notification was 
thus concisely worded, 
Sir, 
A quarter of the annuity, which 
I have hitherto regularly remitted to you, 
would be due on the present Monday ; but, 
as your brother, the late Earl of Domville,

thereof, that payment I conceive myself

Mr. Doraville opened the letter in full 
expectation of touching the usual remit- 
tance, but instead, the information he 
derived from its perusal was such as to en- 
force on his mind a conviction, that he was 
now suddenly reduced to a situation much 
more approximate to Madame Jodelle's, 
and to that of millions of other human 
beings ; inasmuch as since he, after mature 
deliberation, had most philosophically de- 
termined to live on in this world of troubles, 
ways and means must be resorted to for the 
sustenance of life, every other individual 
having again suffered the task to devolve 
on himself. That task he at length under- 
took, but at first with a very ill grace, re-

graciously vituperating the wholesome,

nor was he very sparing of opprobious 
epithets to his defunct brother. But as 
necessity, like death, proceeds in her strait 
forward work " with a dull, cold, ear," silent 
or queremonious, he was dragged along in 
her train. 
Amongst other worldly matters, now to 
be thought of, he had to ascertain the 
amount of his resources, I mean the quantum 
of cash left, how much out of it was due, 
how much would be required for a convey- 
ance to London, and how much for the 
attendant expences. Then followed the 
bustle of settling accounts, of packing up, 
of taking leave, in which act Mr. and 
Mrs. Renaud and Madame Jodelle were 
not forgotten, and early one fine morning,

of which he is the Hero. 
Called up to town in hopes of bettering 
his circumstances, after a residence of three 
months^ deceived in his expectations, baf- 
fled in other pursuits and, with the pres- 
sure of half a century over his head, he 
again took to his staff: and in the summer 
of the present year (1820) began a journey 
of 136 miles back to his native shire, on 
foot. The depression created by a review 
of his situation, was gradually subsiding ; 
exhilerated by exercise in the open air, 
he felt equanimity and then cheerfulness 
returning and, near the conclusion of his 
first day's march, on gaining the altitude 
that commands a view of Henly on 
Thames, where he intended to enjoy his

tiis night's lodging proud of his pedestrian 
feat, recollecting that, five and twenty 
years ago, he went over the same ground 
in no better st^'le, feeling fully able to 
match it on the succeeding days, he ex- 
claimed sufficiently aloud to startle any 
peaceful traveller. 
Days of my youth ! do 1 behold ye again \ 
With a flow of spirits unabated, he com- 
plated his journey, and a more pleasant 
one he does not remember ever having 
enjoyed.  So true it is that, in the absence 
of moral turpitude and of boddy pain, let 
the prospect be ever so overcast, by re- 
tiring within, one can conjure up brighter 
scenes and create a serener sky.

The sun began to rise ; he might still have 
beheld and enjoyed the sublime and soul- 
swelling spectacle ; but was not then in a 
liimior for such contemplations. Wrapt 
up in his roquelaure, enfonce in an angle 
of one of the back seats, his hat slouched 
over his eyes, and his arms folded, he 
brooded over his calamitous plight, in 
full expectation, however, of being allowed 
that unenviable enjoyment undisturbed. 
Unfortunately, a dicussion on the subject 
of French music arose between two out of 
the four companions of his journey.

Domville trusted that the remainder of the 
journey would proceed with less distur-

Illusive expectation ! the very reverse 
happened ! 
The remaining two (also a Badeau and a

to pay in their own coin for their share of 
the entertainment, started a subject to be 
debated upon^ of no less magnitude than

Then was the debate most unsparingly

Our Hero thought it now high time to inter-

he had maintained led the two champions 
to believe, that his ignorance of French 
precluded him from understanding the im- 
port of their sanguinary intent. He now 
undeceived them, and endeavoured also to 
undeceive them as to the necessity of a 
recurrence to any such deadly ultimatum. 
Along with the reasoning that convinced 
them, at least, of the humane motive for his 
interference, he mingled, with an effect

pleasantry.

It were downright folly.  Come, Gentle-

He at last succeeded in making them, if 
not well wishers, at least peaceable towards 
each other for the time being; and when 
they left the vehicle he felt some sorrow in 
parting from them. They had been faith- 
ful adherents to the cause each had adopted, 
and had more than once bled in its defence.

Englishmen : downright John Bulls^

thorough bred quite; though of different 
breeds, both warmly clad in substantial, 
plain clothes of unfashionable make, with 
bob wigs, low crowned; broad brimmed 
beavers ; and with a bustleness and sturdi- 
ness of manner, indicative of well stored 
purses ; indeed the round jolly faces and 
well fed cheeks of each corroborated that 
favorable indication. They had been 
taking a trip to France, because  others 
did so. Their political tenets were decid- 
edly opposite ; but they contracted much of 
the wide range, confining their strictures on 
men and measures at liome. Seldom on the 
defensive, but almost ever assailants, they 
evinced the utmost incredulity in each 
other's belief, and claimed an implicit re- 
liance on every assertion of their own; 
appealing besides in corroboration of their 
statements to those party newspapers that

advocated their own political tenets, each 
assertion, however destitute of proof, they 
recommended to adoption by such expres- 
sions as these :  
" Every body believes it.  There is not 
the least shadow of a doubt.  Sir, I know 
it as a fact.  I have been credibly informed 
by a person high in the confidence of the 
parties. It is as notorious as the sun at 
noon day. And so forth." 
The altercation was the more amusing- to 
our, now better disposed, listener, as his 
acquaintance with the principals enabled 
him to ascertain the falsehood of almost 
every charge, delivered in so positive a 
manner, and derived, as it was contended, 
from undoubted authority. Yet he forbore 
interposing and suffered them to carry on 
the debate in their own way. His perse- 
vering in the strict line of neutrality often

the fiery, flushed, faces of the two disputants, 
turning" from eacli other to his own : he 
being" now applied to, as Arbiter in every 
contradictory statement. 
When weariness compelled them to 
desist, Domville endeavoured to mitigate 
the political animosity of each, by disclos- 
ing all the good he knew of the States- 
men on either side^ whetlier on the score of 
principle or of talent : but the partiality 
and dislike of his hearers were too invete- 
rate for any abatement. Yet, the Modera- 
tor was far from lo:^ing all his pains; 
he reaped the benefit of his endeavours, 
to do the absent justice, by becoming more 
satisfied with himself.

CHAPTER II. 
A YOUNG WOMAN AND AN OLD WOMAN. 
I T so happened that, on 1;he last day of 
his journey, his patienee had further scope 
for exercise, and that on fresh ground. 
He witnessed the admission of a Lady, yet 
short of thirty, of a sour and unmarried 
aspect. She and her retinue occupied one 
half of the vehicle, the two last noted 
politicians, now siding with our hero. This

retinue consisted, first of her maid, but she 
certainly last in her lad}''s estimation, and 
secondly, of half a dozen diminitive, 
French pugs, long haired or curly, of vari- 
ous dimensions, from the size of a rabbit 
to that of a full grown hare. These, the only 
acquirements she had gained from her tour. 
Lad been purchased for a sum that would 
have well supported a family of her own 
species, during a twelve month and more. 
This Lady affected to be very nice, and 
showed upon sundry occasions much squea- 
mishness; >et the odour emitted from the 
over- fed, blear-eyed, creatures did by no 
means discompose her olfactory nerves, 
and her auricular organ was equally proof 
against their barking and growls, their 
snaps and snarls. Her maid's chief em- 
ployment consisted in washing, combing, 
smoothing and regulating the fur of these

animals, feeding" them when well and nurs- 
ing them when sick. Sometimes the mis- 
tress in a fit of tenderness, taking up one 
of her favorites, and calling it her sweet 
pretty creature, her dear little pet, would 
kiss it, hug it to her bosom, and placing 
it in her lap, stroke it with gentle hand; 
and suffered it to ]ye and sleep, and snore 
on that soft conch, and highly displeased 
did she appear, when its slumbers were 
broken by any accidental disturbance. 
The number of these dogs and the sundry 
indecent acts repletion and coiifineme?.t 
compelled them to commit, were too annoy- 
ing to be borne. Remonstrances, however, 
mildly delivered, were received by the 
fair one with offended pride : they obtained 
no other answer than what could be ga- 
thered from a certain cast of the eye, and 
a contemptuous motion of the lips, giving

utterance to a very faint sound, as if she 
had mentally exclaimed, forgetting of 
what species in the creation her favorites 
were.  Oh the Brutes! 
This reply was, however, little satisfac- 
tory to one of our John Bulls: he swore 
that, on the first next offense, he would 
seize them curs every one by the neck, and 
fling them one after the other out of the 
window into the ditch. Which threat had 
such an effect on the Lady, that recourse 
was had to her salts f or the recovery of her 
nerves. 
In this woman's unnatural fondness could 
he traced the bias of nature, perverted. 
The birth of one child would send every 
one of her present favourites to the sales- 
man or to the dog-kennel.

range of the effluvia diffused over its inte- 
rior, and in a brisk pace soon reached the 
summit. He looked about him vi^ith the 
intent of enjoying an extensive view, when 
spying a short way down, a very low 
roofed cottage or hut, tufted over with 
trees, situate in a little glen, it induced him 
to a closer examination, expecting no less 
than to behold standing under the porch, as 
its occupier, some long beared Anchoret 
of former days 
Close to the threshold, a poor woman 
w^as spinning. She was obviously very old 
and infirm, yet so much cheerful resignati- 
on dwelt on her countenance, that it excited 
his surprise. As contented persons are 
generally of a conmjunicative disposition, 
chiefly in humble stations, he met with

ready answers to those questions curiosity 
prompted him to put. 
** Good day to you, good Woman." 
"Thank you. Sir, 1 return it to you 
kindly."

Yet it is high time for you to leave work to 
younger hands."

gaged when at work. I have been brought 
up to it from childhood." 
" Were you ever married ?" 
* Yes, sure, Sir,  It is about sixty-five 
years since." 
" Is your husband still alive ?" 
** He died many years ago. A loaded 
waggon went over his body and crushed 
him to death."

felt as a heavy calamity."

" We had five. One died in the cradle, 
two of my sons were killed in the wars ; 
my only daughter died three years after 
marriage, aud my remaining boy is a crip- 
ple, quite helpless, and without his wits.'* 
'* But, surely, your age requires better

Sure, thought the Inquirer, so much 
cheerfulness near one's end is unnatural:

He ventured on a more trying question."

thoughts of death?" 
** Oh, yes. Sir, very often, God be 
praised." 
" Don't they at times make you low 
spirited ?" 
** Quite the contrary ; they are the most 
cheerful of any. I am very thankful when 
they come upon me." 
*' For what reason ?'* 
** They satisfy me that I shall soon be 
with God."

** Grand Mamma, it is getting cold and 
it is going to rain ; let me put by your 
spinning wheel, and lead you into the

"Do so, child.'' 
She with difficulty arose, courtesied to 
the stranger and, supported by her attend- 
ant and leaning on her staff, contrived to 
hobble in.  Then, for the first time, Dom- 
ville discovered that she was blind. 
This lesson was not lost on him : he was 
fully repaid for his trouble in learning it.

ushered into an apartment, where they be- 
held the cloth laid and the promise of an 
abundant repast held out to them ; which 
however, they no sooner sat down to, than 
they were baulked in the indulgence of 
their appetite in a manner, quite the re- 
verse of the mode adopted by the doctor 
Pedro Positive, for the annoyance of his 
Excellency, the Govenor of the Island of 
Barataria. Instead of the dishes being re- 
moved from them, they were removed from 
the dishes, and hurried on board the packet 
boat, under the alleged plea that, as the 
wind was no7V favorable, not a moment 
should be lost, the ship being already under 
sail. It so happened, however, that as soon 
as they were secured on board, the w ind 
suddenly chopped about, and they remained 
ruefully standing upon deck, their eyes

turned towards that place of alimentary 
entertainment, with as much longing as 
feels any devout Muselman, when he 
beholds from afar the glittering turrets of 
Mecca the holy. For their further comfort, 
they still could spy, ascending out of the 
lofty chimney, the curling smoke, emitted 
from the very fire, which had prepared 
that repast their sight alone had been 
allowed to feast on. 
It would have been well if this had prov- 
ed the only grievous accident: but, alas! 
in the hurry of removal, one of the pugs 
was left behind ', only three had been re- 
placed in the trr veiling box, Mistress and 
maid each carrying one. No sooner were 
these on board than the Lady became 
clamourous for the hoisting up of the re- 
maining invaluable treasure, which a sailor 
undertook to do, when, in the hurry of obe-

thence, with a iew summer sets, reached 
the nether planks of the boat : its hitherto

that state, to the disconsolate damsel, with 
one broken leg only, 
INot so of all the three swimmers or 
X2L\heY paddlers. One could not hold out

ently nimble in picking him up) and he 
sank to rise no more ! So that, upon a 
muster, it was discovered that two were 
missing, one disabled by a broken leg and 
otherwise grievously bruised, and two out 
of the remaining three completely soused 
and drenched, and Jn a woelul pickle, be- 
sides, as their incessant laments implied. 
At this piteous sight, the air was rent 
with the shrill ejaculations of the disconso- 
late Mourner, and a threat more than once 
held out of her determination to take a 
dip into the briny surge, in quest of her 
departed favorite. But no one had she, 
her maid excepted, to condole for her

losses. Indeed so far was any of the other 
passengers from feeling conimisseration in 
her distress, that the exhibition, in some 
degree, made np for the meal they had 
lost. Then were her xjolorons excla- 
mations altered to expressions of vitupn- 
rative anger, and deeming it more expe- 
dient to let the full weight of that anger 
fall upon her poor dependant than on 
herself, she fell a cuffing her in good 
earnest, although the girl had been alone 
true to her charge ; her tongue as voluble 
in abusive epithets, as her open palms were 
nimble in the distribution of her favors. 
Then down she flew into the cabin, there

to bemoan, with sobs and tears, the un- 
timely fate of their unfortunate compan-

CHAPTER III 
SPLENDID MISERY. 
Whilst the packet-boat is steadily 
sailing towards the white Clifls of Albion, 
we will endeavour to entertain the Reader 
with a short sketch of our Hero's brother, 
the late Earl Domville. 
On this Nobleman were plentifully 
showered the gifts of fortune ; and it was 
remarked that he, amongst the very few

had escaped her proverbial fickleness. His 
skilful and unwearied perseverance in con- 
verting* the favors already bestowed into 
means for the production of more, either 
induced or compelled the Goddess not to 
desert so sedulous a votary. Nature too 
had bestowed her endowments on his 
person with no niggardly hand : but one 
passion, and that the most natural of any, 
became the instrument of his infelicity. The 
love of self, carried to excessive egotism, 
smothered at their birth all the finer feel- 
ings. Like the spider, that is only affected 
by the motion that disturbs the meshes of 
its web, transactions, in which he had no 
personal interest, were to him as if they 
were not : and like the same gloomy, 
watchful, solitary insect, amidst the gay 
creation buzzing aroun^i, he, one of the 
prime stars of a splendid court, was a

joyless, unsocial, cold-harted calculator, 
more bloated than fed with the rich pro- 
duce of his success. 
Oderint Dum Metuunt ! was the 
terrible expression of the Roman imperial 
tyrant. Earl Doniville acted as if he had 
made that sentence the rule of his conduct. 
No regiment in the Prussian service was 
more completely drilled to the punctual 
execution of every command, than his 
house-hold establishment was made to con- 
firm to those regulations he had prescribed : 
no servant allowed to appear in his pre- 
sence, but in full costume, with his hair 
powdered and a bag Wangling behind ; 
wearing his bright crimson livery, of a 
weight oppressive from the amount of gold 
lace that broadly covered every seam. 
With the the exception of his own stern, 
sonorous, voice, dread reduced to a

whisper every sentence uttered. Except 
when he strode the stairs, each foot was 
as carefully placed on the steps, as if some 
important personage was then lying in 
articulo mortis, A frown of displeasure 
checked at its birth, any effusion from his 
dependents : whether it proceeded from 
affection or hilarity, he construed it as an 
attempt at emancipation that called for the 
interposition of his authority. 
In the hey day of youth, he never felt 
the glow of friendship, the flame of love 
nor the power of enthusiasm, and never to 
any one did he cordially hold out the right 
hand of fellowship. His connections ranked 
among the highest in the state, his depend- 
ants were numerous, immense his wealth 
and every day encreasing, and few mortals 
were visited with less bodily pain ; yet, 
with every means for enjoyment thus with-
## p. 37 (#45) ##############################################
MAZES OF LIFE. 37  
in his reach, his life passed away a stran- 
ger to real pleasure. His keenest excite- 
ment to exhilaration arose from a gloomy 
satisfaction in the miscarriages of others, 
attended with self gratalation for having 
escaped similar misfortunes. 
He took a wife as a necessary arrange- 
ment for the encrease of his consequence 
and opulence : the contract was a mere * 
bargain, in which he complimented himself 
as a gaiLer, because it added to that of 
which he already possessed a superabun- 
dance ; nor did his subsequent conduct to his 
Lady turn that bargain to a better account. 
Although residing within the same mansion, 
each had a separate establishment. When 
they happened to meet, they unaffectio- 
nately hailed each other :  It was My Lord 
and My Lady ; and, no motive existing to 
enforce dissimulation, expressions more en-

dearing escaped not their lips, because 
none was prompted by their hearts. 
The Countess derived by far the greater 
benejfit from the connection. In possession 
of the means for indulging the natural 
propensity of the sex for visits, parties, 
and glitters : she obtained from vanity all 
the satisfaction that vanity could bestow, 
reduced, however, by the usual drawback 
of rivalships and heart-burnings, and more- 
over extenuated by fastidiousness, the con- 
stant attendant on gratifications too often 
enjoyed.  But the Earl divested of such 
vivacious motives, had no real recreation  
no hobby-horse on which he could mount, 
in whose devious rambles he could lay 
aside the morgue of grandeur, and indulge 
con amore in a favorite pursuit. 
Neither of the sister arts captivated his 
taste or enflamed his imagination. Science

opened its stoves in vain ; the wonders, the 
beauties, of nature spoke a language unin- 
teiligible to his heart ; yet his library dis- 
played a valuable collection of volumes 
splendidly bound, pictures from the first 
Masters adorned his apartments, select 
parties were often invited to well conducted 
concerts, led by the first Executionists ; but 
the entertainment was for his guests, he 
only reaped the scanty one derived from 
ostentation, which, in its gratification, 
so soon finds its decay. 
Not thai his heart had been naturally dis- 
qualified for the enjoyment of pleasure : 
but, as he gradualy suftered the love of 
power and of grandeur to engross his fa- 
culties, ail other incitements became para- 
lized for want of being called into action. 
The conviviahty of the table and even gam- 
ing would have proved a relaxation, an

alleviation to a mind otherwise constantly 
occupied with the same object; but these 
and other amusements he fo^bore^ as dero- 
gatory to his dignity and tending to fami- 
liarities his unsocial pride could not 
brook.  A sure criterion this of a little 
mind, conscious of its littleness. He dares 
not descend, who is aware of his inability 
to regain the altitude he would quit.  The 
Earl, in consequence, had contracted a 
steady reserve, a haughty taciturnity, a 
morose gravity, quite unnatural in so young 
a man : be was seldom seen to smile, 
never to laugh, and the hand of care had, 
with wiimkies on his brow, anticipated the 
Avork of age. 
But though each weighty transaction 
went on smooth with him, it by no means 
follows that he was impervious to discon- 
tent. On the contrary, the fewer the dJs-

MAZES OF LIB'E. 4l 
appointiiieiits the more was his peace ac- 
cessible to repinings and vexation : a 
mere trifle would discompose his equa- 
nimity. As the luxurious Sybarite, re- 
clined on his soft couch, found a motive 
for discontent, because he detected one 
rose leaf doubled ; he would fret and 
brood over any cross accident : the suc- 
cess of a concurrent was a serious cala- 
mity ; and the slightest bodily pain found 
him in a disposition as sensitive, as though 
he were afflicted with the sharpest pain 
of the gout. 
He had not sufficient magnanimity to 
despise or to laugh at those squibs, lam- 
poons and caricatures that, in this country, 
assail every individual remarkable for 
rank, talents or success. Thus, by unrea- 
sonably amplifying to himself the impor-

tance of his individaality, he became the 
more accessible to the shafts of every 
wanton or malignant disturber of his 
repose. 
Habituated to refer every thing to him- 
self, and ever endeavouring to convert 
every one into a tool for the promotion 
of his own ends, he felt in retaliation the 
fear of being over-reached : that fear 
made him suspicious and alert. To coun- 
teract such attempts^ whether fancied or 
real, he called forth all his cunning and 
displayed wonderful perseverance. 
His head Stewart he retained to his 
death, but not without numerous endea- 
vours, and these repeated at various inter- 
vals, in order to detect him tripping in 
his accounts. This agent, however, con- 
trived to come oflf clear from ever) scru-

in the conception of his employer. His 
Lordship ascribed the apparent honesty 
of his proceedings to a dextrous, long- 
practiced, knavery. 
** This servant of mine (so he would 
argue) like the rest of the fraternity, 
must doubtless be a cheat, in some man- 
ner or another : the immense sums tliat 
pass through his hands but too success- 
fully enable him to enrich himself at 
my cost.  However, he is a clever 
shrewd fellow: it is obviously my in- 
terest to retain him, as jijuch more 
i^rvijceable to me than an honest fool, if 
there be any such : he, for his ow n sake,

I shall only Imve one rogue to watch 
over instead of many." 
His favorite maxim was that every

who obtains the greater credit for probity 
is only the more artful knave  Thus, at 
one fell swoop, into one odious desig-

clude the numerous diversity of characters, 
that discriminate the human race. Accord-

The three children his Lady brought 
him did not form any domestic circle 
round his heart. On mercenaries devolved 
the whole task of their education : what- 
ever encomiums were bestowed on them 
but faintly flattered the man, and never 
reach a heart thai was not paternal. In- 
stead of hailing them as heirs to his name, 
the succeeding upholders of his rank, wealth 
and influence, and his natural friends to 
the close of life, he repiningly marked

their progress towards manliood as liinls 
to him of a declining" age, and true 
to the suggestions of selfishness, he viewed 
his own offspring in the odious light of 
intruders, who must wish him away, as the 
chief bar to those worldly possessions they 
would acquire by his demise. 
If any sensation truly cordial came 
from such man it was the hatred he bore 
his brother. That hatred began in the 
days of his boyhood, and only ended 
with his life : it received aliment from a 
variety of occurrences. In natural gifts 
our Hero was his superior ; at school he was 
the favorite of his comrades, whilst the 
young Earl became more and more the 
object of their aversion. Neither did 
Charles try to lessen by forbearance his 
sense of superiority : on the contrary, his 
natural flow of spirits, his quickness at

the wounds he inflicted. When they min- 
gled with world, his Lordship could not 
conceal from himself that, though every 
outward consideration was offered at the 
shrine of his eldership^ to h']^ brother th^ 
homage of the heart and of the mind was 
tendered : and, whilst the greater profusion 
of obsequious bows and interested smiles

every other pecuniary channel closed

amongst his retainers and made him feel 
that he considered him as such. The 
spirited young" man spurned the degrading 
situation, and doubly aggravated the offence 
of rejection by seceding from the ministe- 
rial side, and openly espousing the cause of 
the Earl of Petersfield, the political opo- 
nent his Lordship held in the greatest dis- 
like. 
The annuity of 400/, subsequently grant- 
ed, the Earl conjectured would so far' sub- 
due his brothers pride as to induce the 
latter to make obsequious advances towards 
a reconciliation, and that a resumption of 
tory principles would be the consequence. 
In this expectation he was disappointed.

except b^ the receipt for the same, regular-

This neglect led our nobleman to infer that 
tlie hatred he felt was returned v^ith equal 
cordiality. Hence originated the angry 
insertion of his motives for disallowing his 
brother any bequest in his last will. With- 
out attempting to palliate a conduct so un- 
forgiving, we must, in justice, censure 
Charles for this sin of omission :  since he 
condescended to accept an obligation^ it 
certainly was his duty to acknowledge it as 
such. 
The latter end of Earl Domville is soon 
told. Nature was to the last constant in 
sparing him much bodily pain, he gradually 
sunk into a languid apathy, and expired 
without a struggle. A magnificent funeral 
was the last public notice taken of this

cause heartless, nobleman, whose excessive 
love of self, defeating" its own purpose, had 
promoted his own misery. Thus in some 
chemical preparations too great a propor- 
tion of one ingredient^ not only prevents 
the intended effect, but produces results 
precisely the reverse. 
That keen and unsparing scrutator of the 
human heart,  La Kochefoucault, observes 
that, whatever difference is apparent in 
conditions, there is always a certain com- 
pensation of good and of evil, that renders 
them equal. If, by the word conditions, 
he means the dispensations of nature and 
of fortune among mankind, the maxim will 
not altogether hold good. Bodily pain is a 
real evil and, in its continuance, becomes 
downright wretchedness; which no com- 
pensaiion can be adduced us adequate.

more than counterbalanced b}^ a cheerful 
disposition, in the power of any rational

fostered, or aggravated by vitious propen-

suits, re-called him to a re-consideration of 
his own immediate concerns.

expectation of a fortunate issue could be

forlorn. 
Another cause subsequently tended to 
depress his spirits.  lie who so frequently 
had paced the same streets, liailed, greeted

On calling upon the executors of his 
brother, he had the mortification to find,

that the amount of legacy left him was but 
little calculated to refresh the memory, 
and to re-excite the smiles of his former, 
fashionable, friends. He was cut off with 
a shilling ! Indeed, with the exception of 
a very iev^ collateral bequests, the whole of 
the immense property was left to the late 
Earl's three children. 
Domville, who had reasoned with him- 
self, in case of the worst happening-, was 
now fully resolved to act up to his notions 
of fitness. He collected all his fortitude, 
in order to face the formidable array of 
hardships Poverty was marshalling against

out to the last ; he, with very few pounds 
remaining, retired to a cheap lodging and,

found means of making* a little go a great 
way. Yet, as he loved to be and to appear 
jieat, he delayed parting with his better ap- 
parel, till necessity should compel the 
transfer. In the mean time, in order to 
avert that necessity, he sought to encrease 
his store of cash with the product of his 
labour. 
It now occurred to him that in the 
bottom of his trunk was deposited a literary 
work, left unfinished, because the 400. 
annuity interfered to prevent its concluding 
progress. He drew it from under his 
clothes, and began a re-perusal. So 
masterly was the performance rated by the 
impartial Author, that he resolved its many 
beauties should no longer be withheld from 
an admiring world.

Publisher ; but this man had left off busi- 
ness or business had left him off; our author 
was fain to apply to other gentlemen of the 
trade, for a purchaser. But, as his name 
was not in the tit e page and, as the delicacy 
of his vanity would suffer no consideration 
to usurp any of the influence, due only to 
the intrinsic merit of the performance, he 
was debarred from any advantage deriv- 
able from that circumstance. On the other 
hand, the traders in modern manuscripts 
never thought it worth their while to enquire, 
who it was that made a lender of a work in 
an unfinished state, on a subject which they 
deemed not sufficiently attractive; no 
wonder that the highest sum offered was so 
inconsiderable, as to deter him from sub- 
mitting to part with so much worth for so 
paltry a consideration.

premises, up three pair of stairs, not with

him,  is now a miserable lodger in some 
obscure alley, unable to extract from any 
publisher, for a valuable consideration, a 
sum sufficient to prolong his existence for 
a few weeks. 
The contrast was disheartening; but 
Domville was determined not to be dis- 
heartened. He discovered that, upon 
casting up every item on both sides, he 
was, on the whole, creditor to a consider- 
able amount > and that the prime of man- 
hood, with health, talents, steadiness of 
principles, and the consciousness of not 
having lived in vain, greatly overbalanced 
what could be adduced against him on the 
score of poverty. This conference with 
himself ended in a sirenuous determination.

Our Hero, moreover, found that the

him with additional energy ; and from the 
pressure he rose the greater, as the bow, 
further bent, sends off the arrow to a 
higher altitude. But though his mind 
was strencrthened, his heart became not

cede. He was not above receiving obliga- 
tions, as we shall see hereafter, but then 
they must come from the hand of those 
he could really esteem. The relaxing and 
even demoralizing effect of living upon 
donations, he had too sensibly felt not to 
avert, with all his might, the calamitous 
necessity of again submitting his prin- 
ciples to their acceptance. On the other 
hand, the resources derived from indus- 
trious application, assured him a certain 
weekly stipend, which was likely to be 
co-existent with the continuance of that 
application.

time (Sunday morning) customers were 
wont to call for what they could afford to 
purchase or get credit for. He heard her

there was no appeal : no tears bedewed her

lar course of thinos.  Yet one could trace 
a deeper sense of dejection ; and, taking 
by the hand a ragged, bare-footed, bushy- 
headed urchin, whom she had brought 
with her, as a forlorn hope to excite com- 
miseration, she made way for a better cus- 
tomer^ slowly left the shop and departed.

In the mean time Mrs.Grimstone, seem- 
ingly unmoved, attended to the concerns 
of her trade. She could, however, find 
time to bid her lodger step into the back 
room, and that she would soon be at 
liberty. 
Surely, thought Domville, this woman 
must be destitute of all human feeling. In 
that unfavorable prepossession he was mis- 
taken. She was not destitute of charity : 
she had occasionally sent to this female 
broken victuals and waste articles from tlie 
shop, and the Parish did the rest. 
After paying the rent, Domville could 
not help reverting to the subject of the poor 
woman, adding that he had seldom seen 
so miserable an object. 
" Miserable, indeed ! She is really much 
to be pitied.''

get an honest penny ; but the man is so 
well known and they are so poor, that 
folks are afraid to trust her with any arti- 
cle of value.  So, you see, that even that 
chance is gone from her. 
Fraught with this intelligence, our Hero 
went up to his recess and busied himself 
with looking over his apparel, in order to

thus ev ployed : how he scrutinized each 
article ! How desirous to detect rents and 
gaps, then fearful lest the cost for repairs

His indecision was encreased by the 
same apprehension he, from Mrs. Grim- 
stone's representation, had blamed others 
for entertaining.  ** This waistcoat is too 
valuable ; may be I shall never see it again." 
He, however, contrived to make up a bun- 
dle, the mending and darning of which, he 
conceived, would reach half-a-crown. 
As he went through the shop, the sight 
of some loaves, ranged upon the window's 
shelf, suggested to him that the donation of

one could not prove unacceptable. The 
first impulse was in accordance with that 
suggestion ; prudence prompted a second of 
a contrary tendency, and made him irreso- 
lute. He stood on the threshold, internally 
debating the subject, fingering the while a 
few shillings in his pocket.  " Let us first

indispensable luxury of fuel was denied. In 
lieu of papering, the walls round were 
stained with every tinge, from a dingy hue 
to a coal black. The state of the low 
ceiling matched that of the floor : the 
plaster had fallen and was falling off, and 
through the decayed and broken laths, the

and the mother completed the household, 
with the exception of the father who was 
absent, spending the remnant of his week*s 
wages at some pot house, whence he would 
return in a gruflf disposition, which he con- 
ceived himself justified to vent on his family, 
because intemperance had reduced him pen- 
iiyless : a legitimate motive for quarrelling 
besides could not be lacking, because no 
Sunday dinner will he find, cooked in 
time, to be placed before him on his arrival. 
If ever there are hopeless cases for 
doing good, with any permanent effect, 
this is surely one, chiefly considering the 
very limited means of the intended Bene- 
factor : indeed the first sensation was the 
chilly one of discouragement. However,

warmed by the consciousness of his motive, 
he proceeded. 
Reader, hast thou ever tried to handle a

foot feels an unpleasant jar, as the pressure 
forces the instrument into the soil, the heavy 
clod is then heaved up and turned into the 
trench :  it is then broken small and made 
level to match the part already done by an 
Adept. A few more such efforts repeated, 
the loins feel sore, the arms weary, and the 
Operator erects himself, in order to fetcli 
breath and to unstiffen his back. He then 
casts a rueful glance on the small extent of 
his labour, and views in despair the immense 
expanse remaining.  The spade is relin- 
quished : he recedes from the trench, and 
wiping his forehead, exclaims discouraged.

trench, others to complete a second or more 
and as they proceed, the labour feels less 
fatiguing-, the space dug is more consider- 
able, and the quantum remaining* appears of 
course much reduced. This prompts to 
fresh exertions, and he that has persevered 
thus far, on leaving work, fee]s,as the even- 
ing closes, a reasonable pride in the amount 
of his labour : an additional flow of spirits 
and an increase of appetite the consequence. 
Early next morning, he rises, impatient 
to resume his task; and day after day a con- 
siderable step is made towards pecuniary 
independence, as he need not look out 
abroad for expensive amusements, nor is he 
longer dependent on the society of others, 
as he is now surrounded with the plants 
of his own rearing. He derives pleasure 
from anticipating the produce,  the

is realized,  that pleasure is increased ten 
fold by a sense of iis usefulness.  Such, and 
moro exquisite still, is the reward of those 
who persevere in their endeavours to allevi- 
ate human misery. The practice gains 
upon them ; and, unlike the money-lender, 
who must tvait for the failing* in of his 
interest,, the act repays them at the very 
time. 
Domville, not seeming" affected by the 
wretchedness about him, inquired of the 
mother whether she could repair the several 
articles he had brought.  So saying, he 
displayed them before her. 
She replied in the affirmative ; would 
be~ thankful for the job : and in answer to 
his inquiry about the charge, he was assured 
it was well worth ten pence ! The magni- 
tude of the sum demanded, made her 
mention it rather hesitatingly : it proved^

intended employer had rated it at. He 
left her in the possession of the articles, 
with an intimation that they would be 
wanted by Tuesday next, and with a pro- 
mise on her part that she would not fail 
to take them in, on the morning of that day. 
On his re-entering the shop, he thought 
that Prudence itself would not object 
to his laying out, for the poor family's 
benefit, one half of the twenty-pence the 
moderation of the charge had left at his 
disposal. Half a quartern loaf and a peck 
of potatoes were dispatched, in order to 
ensure some food for the Sunday and fol- 
lowing day, - then nimbly up stepped the

steps at a stride, to his room, three stories

With an assurance that the debt would 
be then discharged, she left the room, in 
possession of the needful.  Soon after, 
however, a very gentle rap, hardly audible, 
proved the harbinger of her re-appear- 
ance. 
*' If you please. Sir, I would rather 
bring you a shilling at a time, just as we 
get it. It would not be safe for your

I crave not the Reader to forgive these 
minutiae, he must surely feel a charm m

the fictions of the Novelist cannot well

On Thursday next, she brought him the 
first shilling, on account. 
^' Well. Have you any work on hand ?'' 
'* No, Sir. 
" But, why dont you try to get some ?  
I have at present nothing else for you."

This reproach proved th^t all pride was 
not yet extinct in her, her altered tone

her reply.

ing a source of consolation in the worst of 
times.  Look here! displaying open an 
ample, gay coloured, cravat which, although 
intersected with scarcely fewer rents than 
those apparent, on many a standard of 
our veteran battalions, was yet a prize 
worth contending for.  Look here ! I will 
keep this for little Betsy. It will yet do 
to cut out for a tippet. I will give it her 
as soon as she can hem it. 
On the first Sunday, a second shilling 
was paid. She appeared, attended by the 
same Urchin he first beheld, and in the 
opposite hand, little Betsy was produced. 
Both children much improved in person 
and apparel ; their faces and hands bore 
evident signs of ablution, as these were no 
lonofe encrusted with a thick layer of 
dirt; the comb had forced a passage, in 
various directions, through the matted clus^

ters of their locks; and the needle had 
materially succeeded in closing* up ibe 
gaps in their covering". Indeed the free 
use of that instrument and of soap had also 
improved the appear.ance of the mother, 
who seemed not a little pleased with the 
favorable alteration she had effected in her 
children. 
Domville could not bat notice the im- 
provement, he was also pleased with her 
punctuality in the faithful discharge of his 
pecuniary claim.  All this promised fair.  
He did not suffer her to depart without 
some kind act 9nd expression, calculated 
to gratify a mother, and soon after went 
down himself to pay his rent. He then, 
thus opened his intended conference with 
his landlady.

Every one of these items, thus emphati- 
cally enumerated, were so many clenchers 
to fasten Domville's Jips. 
** And if she had all that she wants, 
triumphantly pursued the Objectrice, the

can tell her that.  If that much will suit, 
why, she is welcome.'* 
Domville expressed himself thankful for 
the offer, notwithstanding" the ungraceful- 
ness of its delivery, and hastened to im- 
part the gladful tidings to Mrs. Williams, 
who felt not less pleased at the intelligence. 
The glow of reviving industry spread 
over her pallid cheeks. One of the shil- 
lings was re-borrowed for the indispensable 
purchase of soap at Mrs. Grimstone's shop, 
and the second daughter was now made 
to help her Mother in this new undertak- 
ing. 
During the whole w^eek, Domviile's 
Protog6e had been careful to prevent her 
children from annoying Mrs. Grimstone, 
and he found the latter still favourably dis- 
posed. She had got her a customer or 
two, and^ doubted not that, if she gave

satisfaction, more would be had. She had 
also heard of an errand lad wanted at a 
Grocer's ; it would suit the eldest very well. 
The place could afford him the run of his 
teeth, perhaps bring" him in some cast off 
clothes with other pickings.  ** But then 
who is to make the application ?'* 
** I will, cried Domville,  1 will g'o im- 
mediately.'* 
So saying, having obtained the direction, 
he departed on that hopeful errand.  Time 
and trouble thrown away ' The place had 
been taken ; but was told of a Trunk maker, 
some streets off, who had such a situation 
vacant. Thither he sped  made his appli- 
cation, was let to know by the master that 
he always made it a rule, never to admit 
lads into his house without proper recom- 
mendation, or without some knowledge of 
the parents. All he could adduce, not being

satisfactory, he slowly retraced his steps, 
nothing done. 
Next morning, however, he was more 
fortunate :  calling upon his Stationer fm* 
a necessary supply of paper, he happened 
to inquire whether Mr. Demy knew of any 
one that wanted an errand lad ; Mr. D, 
replied that if he liked the looks of the boy, 
he would take him in himself, at first as a 
trial. 
In consequence, the mother having ex- 
erted all her ingenuity in making the most 
of his rags, and of a trifling article from 
Mr. Dom villa's wardrobe, introt'uced the 
youth, properly admonished, to his em- 
ployer. 
He being disposed of, a fresh difficulty 
occurred,  how to contrive for the eldest 
daughter.  She was rather pretty, and this 
street-selling oranges was, after all, one

step toward prostitution. A middle-aged 
lady wanted a maid, so Mrs. Grimstone 
informed him. -"But Sally had no ac- 
quirements,  it was not to be expected she 
would fit the place ; to be sure, the wench 
was handy, and 'cute, and willing", and all 
that; but Ladies now-a-days expect so 
much fur their money.  It mast not be 
thought on/' 
** Why not? Where is the harm in try- 
ing ? Come, Mrs. Grimstone, I have 
provided for the lad ; do you undertake the 
|?irl.  Every one for his own sex,  that's 
fair." 
** Me ! Cried she, in surprise, that would 
be a fool's errand.  I should soon come 
back as wise as I went.  " Hark ye," 
added she, laughing, which laughing pro- 
voked a cough, (the lady was somewhat 
asthmatic^ " take my word for it, a hand-

some, agreeable gentleman, such as yon, ifi 
more fitter to gain a lady's favour, than 
such a gruff, homely, plain spoken woman, 
as I be." 
Vanity certainly did not allow our Hero 
to undertake the bland efficacy of his 
address: thus encouraged^ he undertook 
the negociation of this very delicate affair. 
He was admitted, and having ascertained 
from the Lady's lips the deficiency in her 
establishment, ventured to recommend 
Sarah Williams^ as not altogether unworthy 
her protection. 
** And, pray, Sir, what can the girl do ?'* 
This plain question struck the Recom- 
niender dumb; of all the requisites expect- 
ed from a maid servant, he only knew of 
those that enabled her to rectify the dis- 
order in his apartment, and to bring in his 
meals.

*^ Can she get np fine linen, wait at table 
and occasionally do the office of a cook ?" 
Alas ! Sally, he knew, must be deficient 
in every one of these particulars; indeed, as 
to the last office, she never had any materi- 
als to work upon.  The case appeared 
hopeless ;  yet the girl was quick of ap- 
prehension, she could soon learn^ if the 
lady would abate somewhat of her expect- 
ations, for the sake of humanity.  That 
thought inspired him with a cue ; he con- 
ceived that a disclosure of the whole truth, 
a plain artless narrative, the most likely 
way to excite her participation in the rescue 
of a young female from impending ruin. 
He besought her indulgence, told his tale, 
neither boasted of nor concealed his share 
in what had already been done for the 
family. His appearance, his manner, his 
delivery, bespoke the gentleman, the man

statement weaken the intended effect, bj

^* Madam.*' thus concluded the Advo- 
cate's peroration/ if you do not, at first, 
derive all the benefit that could be expected 
from the girl's services, at least you may 
rest ass!ired that, as your motive in admit- 
ting her into your household is the effect of 
pure benevolence, gratitude on her part 
must be the return. Domestics generally 
deem their qualifications an adequate set off 
against the amount of wages received ; and 
the agreement is thus felt fis a sort of trading- 
like bargain. But here you are sure of a 
zeal, of an affection daily, hourly evinced 
in the prompt and cheerful discharge of 
what services she can as yet perform, till

Mrs. G rimstone's prognostic was verified : 
the gentleman succeeded^ and Sally was 
allowed to wait on the lady, at first only as 
a trial ; however, she, as well as her brother 
contrived to retain their respective situa- 
tions. This being accomplished, Domville 
fancied that nothing more was required 
of him,  he reckoned without his host.  
As he was busy at his daily occupation, 
heavy steps from clumsy feet, ungraced 
with dancing pumps, thumped the stairs 
ascending. A heavy fist knocked for ad- 
mission, and a dirty, coarsely clad, sturdily 
built, vulgar looking, rough-bearded figure,

begrimed with mortar and brick dust, 
appeared in view. A compound of idleness, 
drunkenness, brutality and roguery. His 
ostensible errand was only intended to in- 
troduce another he had much more at heart. 
This duplicity gave him a hesitating tone 
and manner that betrayed him.

'^ What is it you want then?" 
** Why, Sir, as you are so friendly dis- 
posed, may be, you would have no sort of 
objection to my drinking* your health in a 
pot of porter or so." 
This demand, thus impudently made, 
astonished Domviile and raised his indigna- 
tion. His first impulse was to bid the 
fellow leave the room ; but the hope, how- 
ever faint, of effecting some little towards 
his amendment, for his family's sake, sug- 
gested this milder reply. 
*^ Hark ye, Williams. I am willing to 
help those that are willing to help them- 
selves; but against the Idle and Drunkard 
my hand shall ever be closed." 
This retort had no moral effect, he only

the demoralizing eftects of that baneful 
system. He remained a moment silent, 
then resumino^.

" Get what redress you can ; but here 
you shall no longer stay. Come, Sir, 
walk out. " 
And his " proud form*" standing beside 
the door, pointed to the stairs. Williams 
sulkily followed that direction, willing, yet 
not daring to shew the blackguard. But, 
his boldness increasing as he receded, on 
the landing place he was heard, in that

into the country, round the Metropolis,

tion, derivitig" additional pleasure from 
variety, as he made it a rule to pursue 
eacli time a different direction. When he 
had completed the circle, he regularly 
traced it over again, renev^'ing thus his 
acquaintance with every striking or inter- 
esting object he had seen, and revisiting 
memorials he had here and there set up, in

commemoration of the then disposition of 
his heart and mind. 
It was in one of these festive rambles 
that he noticed a gentleman, coiidncting' 
a visitor to his carriai^e. Tiie former, in 
giving* the parting* shake, begged to be 
kindly remembered to Mrs. Sandhurst  
and the carriage drove off. 
The sound of that name, it may well be 
supposed, did not escape Domville. He 
tarried some time in cogitation, impressed 
with the probability, that the Mr. Sandhurst 
then in the carriage still in view, was the 
very Merchant who had accepted from 
him the gift of two thousand pounds, and 
had returned upon application the sum of 
fifty only, as recorded in this authentic 
history, vol, i. chap. 12.

the truth, he made to the genteel looking

depart, and requested to speak with the 
owner. His appearance being deemed a 
sufficient passport, he was admitted, when 
Doiiiville begged to be informed, whether 
the Gentleman just gone was not Mr. Peter 
Sandhurst, now or late of Liverpool, and 
nephew of a person of the same name, once a 
West India Merchant. On being ans- 
wered in the affirmative, he requested to 
know his present residence, as he had a 
message of some consequence to deliver 
to him. Furnished with the direction, he 
politely apologized for the trouble given 
and took his leave. 
Ere he closed his eyes that night, he 
made up his mind to wait on the Gentleman 
next morning, although, by so doing, he 
\yould lose the best part of a djiys 
work.

Following the directions, he found him- 
self in front of a modern Villa, of elegant 
structure, enclosed by a well laid out shrub- 
bery. He went through the gate and 
was making to the house, in as straight a 
line as the winding avenue would allow, 
when he perceived, emerging from a green 
bouse, a person who in his appearance 
bore every token of ownership.  Dom- 
ville stepped up to him. After the 
usual salutations. 
" Mr. Sandhurst, I presume.*' 
" Sir, my name is Sandhurst."

he started up and wiped his face.  Domville 
also rose and proceeded.

** Laws, my good Sir, were framed to 
bind knaves.  Honest men need them 
not. They have a code of their own, to 
which each willingly subscribes." 
" Sir, 1 heartily agree with you in that 
respect. 1 flatter myself that, in the course 
of my extensive dealings^ no one can justly 
tax me.  But, it somehow happens, that 
you have called at a time rather inconve-

lected for the purchase of additional stock 
or, perhaps, for the investment of money 
in a mortgage."

Why, Sir, rather something to that 
effect/* (in a more complaisant tone and 
returning the smile.) 
After this short digression, the Assailant 
thought it advisable to return to the 
charge. 
** Mr. Sandhurst, you perceive my drift 
and, as you truly observed, we now under- 
stand each other.  Ere I take my leave, 
be pleased to inform me what am I to 
expect from this call on you, upon a sub- 
ject in which both your honor and honesty 
are implicated." 
Why Sir, I should be extremely sorry 
to let you depart with a mean opinion of 
me.  But, what would }ou have me do 
in this affair ?  What do you expect from 
me?" (afraid lest his own suggestions 
should lead him too far,"

" Sir, you are the best judge of your

may not agree as to the more or less. 
Therefore, instead of prescribing to yoii^ I

Out of the 2,0001. return me 600. I shall

larger one, in the days of my affluence.'* 
Mr. S. expected a more serious call on 
his honor and honesty : a certain plea- 
santness about the mouth and eyes indi- 
cated his release from that surmise. Yet, 
in order to enhancet he value of the 
concession, he did not forbear a sort of  
not higgling, but coquettish parade.

therefore replied.

so much, would now certainly believe 
myself in a state of affluence : whilst you, 
probably, would consider the addition of 
thousands, but with a reference to youK

Very true. Wisely considered in- 
deed !'' (by no means displeased with the 
manner his conception of wealth was intro- 
duced.) 
" Another reason, resumed Domvilie, 
prompts me to be moderate in my demand. 
We are relations, Mr. Sandhurst : and one 
relation should not bear too hard upon 
another**' 
** Nor shall we, cried Sandhurst, highly 
flattered with this acknowledgment of 
affinity by one, whom, he knew, was a son 
to a Peer of the Realm.  But, Sir, it is

Oar Claimant then departed, ceremoni- 
ously, and yet with hearty good will, 
conducted to the outer gate by the Mer- 
chant ; and as practice had made him an 
expert physiognomist, he boded every thing 
favorable from to-morrow's interview. 
To-morrow came. He was of course 
punctual to the time, and Mr. S. at home. 
The latter, after the usual greetings, 
requested his attendance in his study. 
^^ Sir, said the Merchant in a deliberate 
tone of voice and with much emphasis,l am 
now ready and most willing to pay you

Open and laid on the desk.  Now, Sir, 
before 3011 take them up, be pleased to 
listen to what I have to say/' 
Domville was all attention. 
" Yesterday, I told you I should give 
the subject a thought,  I have done so. In 
consequence, I have a proposal to submit 
to you. From the hints dropt in our last 
conference respecting your present cir- 
cumstances, I should infer that they are 
not now very prosperous.  Sir, am I cor- 
rect?'' 
** They certainly are not so, in a pecu- 
niary point of view." 
^* My \vish is to render permanent the 
benefit you expect to derive from this sum. 
In plain words, to make the most of the 
money.  This leads me to my proposal.  
1 am at present engaged in a very profita- 
ble concern ; the 7iet profits of last year

was something more than 25 per cent ; 
and, as I have bronglit it to run uito a 
steady channel, there is little fear of an 
immediate decrease.  Now, Sir, you have 
the option of either putting these bills into 
your pocket, or, of investing the amount 
(shall I call it your capital  Domville 
bowed) into this same concern; \, insuring 
you, so long as it is thus placed, 20 per 
cent ; engaging further to account to you, 
annually, for any per centage that may 
accrue above that premium." 
Domville immediately took up the 
notes, delivered them into Mr. Sandhurst's 
hands and, with expressions of sincere 
thanks, requested him to dispose of them as 
he should think fit. The latter flatteri?d 
by the confidence reposed in him, and 
pleased with the ready manner in which 
it was evinced, deposited the five bills in

a particular division of his pocket-book, 
saying : 
** These are your's ; but (laking out 
another of equal value) I am considering 
that you may possibly be in want of an 
immediate supply.  Allow me, Sir, to beg 
your acceptance of this.  No offence, 
Mr. Domville.  Wei are relations, you 
know." 
The mean, hypocritical, shew of reluct- 
ance did not disgrace Domville's act of 
accepting the pecuniary offer; he took it 
at once and felt additional thankfulness 
for the delicate manner in which it was 
tendered. 
** Now, Sir, one word more, and then 
I flatter myself you will indulge us with 
your company to dinner,  You have been 
abroad, Mr. Domville.'* 
^* I have only been in France.**

Domville bowed in the affirmative *' 
** Perhaps you also know Itaflian ?" 
I speak it but inditferently ; I fancy, 
however, I could make myself under- 
stood." 
** Now, Sir, on the strength of our 
relationship, allow me to ask, whether you 
have any profitable employment on hand or 
in view ?'' 
*' I have a trifling one on hand, and none 
whatever in expectation.'* 
" Then, Sir, I presume, you would re- 
linquish your present one should a more 
eligible be offered.*' 
" I certainly should not hesitate." 
" I will tiien disclose what further

This was another advantageous pro- 
posal to our Hero, and the more suit- 
able to his inclination, as Florence, one 
of the places of his intended destination, 
was the very city in which he, upon in- 
quiry, had learned that his intimate Friend, 
Mr. Langley, now released from the cares 
of any diplomacy, was enjoying life in 
philosophical ease. He therefore, on every

the proposal. 
"But then, Sir, now tlmt you have 
accepted the office, you have still a further 
claim on me (and the pocket-book was 
again re- opened) the voyage is attended

felt as one just released from an oppressive

burden, he longed to be alone, in order to 
commune with himself, the better to ap- 
preciate the full value of his good fortune. 
Shortly after tea, he rose to take leave. 
His entertainer, on conducting him to the 
outer gate, gave him to understand that it 
were advisable to make preparation for 
a speedy departure : a ship bound for 
Marseilles being on the point of sailing. 
He requested him to call to-morrow at his 
counting-house, where be would be furnished 
with every requisite instruction. 
Pacing his way homewards, he felt the 
full extent of his altered circumstances, 
raised as he was on a sudden from the 
depth of poverty to a state of compara- 
tive affluence, which, with a common share 
of prudence, he would probably retain 
to the end of life. 
He then recurred to the oeconomy of

Mr. Sandhurst's management in the liqui- 
ilation of liis claim. It struck him that 
the sums, now disbursed^ were exactly 
to the amount of the legal interest his 
original remittance to that gentleman 
would have borne.  As thus

Moreover, the Merchant engaging to 
make the 5001. in his possession produce 
100 annually, it was, in other words, still 
paying interest for the original two 
thousand pounds. The surplus prie- 
mium, expected from the investment, may

be considered as equivalent to the com- 
pound interest arising from the first seven 
years. This agreement, coupled with 
several hints that dropt from him over 
their vi'ine, made it extremely probable 
that he had it in contemplation, not only 
to pay interest for the original sum, but 
intended, on some future period, to re- 
turn the principal. 
The Merchant might de<ftm it impro- 
vident, in the first instance, to trust his 
new Agent with the disposal of so large 
a sum, as he still retained some suspi- 
cion, that his noble relative was readier 
in the delivery of wise apothegms than 
expert in the practice of them.  Per- 
haps, also, as the acquisition of wealth 
had been his invariable aim since he 
began the world, he might feel reluct-

ance in parting* with so considerable a 
portion, and which he, in his conception, 
could layout to greater advantage than in 
the power of IMr. Domville to effect.  Be it 
so. We should not quarrel with a man, 
because, in the act of obliging us, he 
confers an obligation on himself. 
The result of the above transaction sug- 
gests one reflection. A considerable share 
of its fortunate issue must be ascribed to 
our Hero's behaviour^ which behaviour he 
was enabled to assume from the consci- 
ousness of having, placed himself, by his 
application and oeconomy in a state of 
independence. This gave to his address a 
tone of freedom and decision which brouaht 
him, notwithstanding his penury, to cope, 
upon equal terms, with the man of opu- 
lence^  Whatever might be the result of 
his application, he could abide the worat.

The impression prod need would have been 
far less favorable, had he made his ap- 
proaches in the humble character of a 
Suitor  of one well aware that, should his 
claim be disallowed, the only alternative 
would be to beg or to starve. So true is 
La Rochefoucault*s maxim.

CHAPTER VIII. 
A VOYAGE. 
JLT was a fine breezy morning, early in the 
spring, when Domville, in Mr. Sandhurst's 
carriage, rode with that Gentleman to 
Blackwall, where, both alighting, they were 
boated over to the ship, lying out at anchor 
with sails unfurling. 
The merchant introduced his agent to 
the captain, recommending him in the

132 MAZES OF LIFE. 
warmest terms, and desiring- that every 
attention should be paid to his accommoda- 
tion. 
After a short conversation, they took an 
affectionate leave of each other, and Mr. S. 
was rowed back to his carriage.  Dom- 
ville stood on deck, his eyes ri vetted on him 
all the time he was in sight, and, from the 
difference of his present feelings, he could 
with difficulty believe that his employer 
was the same individual, of whom he form- 
ally entertained so mean an opinion, owing 
to the shahbiness of his first remittance. 
Without any accident, our Agent landed 
at Marseilles, succeeded in the recovery of 
considerable debts, remitted them without 
delay to the firm, in the manner prescribed. 
Having concluded what business detain- I 
ed him in that city, he went on board the | 
first ship ready to sail for Leghorn, and left 
i

the Freneh coast, now with reluctance, as 
the native country of Miss De Clermont ; 
then more willingly, as he was approaching 
the city that contained his old friend, 
Mr. Langley. 
That day and the following, the vessel 
made but little way. Domville soon found 
reason to be dissatisfied with both the 
master and his crew. The former was 
surly, abusive, an incessant swearer in the 
morning ; familiar, drunk and foolish in 
the evening. The crew was a medley of 
French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese 
Mariners, the very dregs of the profession, 
all inveterate thieves and drunkards. To- 
wards evening, confusion and riot pervaded 
the ship. The men, apparently without 
much premeditation, rose upon the master, 
and confined him, bound, m his cabin. The

principal of the mutineers then approach- 
ing our Englishman, assured him that they 
did not intend him an}? harm, provided he 
remained quiet ; but, on the least shew of 
resistance, he swore that they would throw 
him oyer board. He inquired whither 
they intended to take the vessel.  In 
answer, he was rudely bidden tQ ask no 
questions, and to mind his own business. 
Now that they had gained complete 
possession of the ship, the question was, 
who should command and who should 
obey ; but, as every one was more desirous 
of assuming the former office than of sub- 
mitting to the latter, the altercation ter- 
minated in sundry quarrels,  blows were 
exchanged and biood was shed, and on 
deck and below it was a conifdete Pande- 
monium. Upon one point, however, there

appeared a full agreement. They had yet 
sufficient sense to foresee that, in this state 
of anarchy, their newly acquired en>anci- 
pation could not last long; resolving 
therefore to live a short life and a merry 
one^ they, forcing their way to the stores, 
eat and devoured, quaffed and guzzled, till 
they sunk to such a state of bestial degra- 
dation, as no moral human being can have 
any conception of, unless he were to wit- 
ness the abominable scene. 
It is remarked of wretches, thus inebri- 
ated, that they often suspend their ani- 
mosities against each other, and turn their 
savage dispositions against those who are 
uninfluenced by their example; as if the 
presence of sobriety was a reproach they 
could not bear. Domville became exposed 
to the assaults of several of those ruffians, 
who, with hideous and disgusting aspects,

uttering dreadful imprecations and armed 
with long' bladed knives, staggered up to 
him ; but too impotent to effect their mur- 
derous intent, they either stumbled and fell 
halfway, or, if they came within reach, 
were easily overpowered and disarmed. 
Yet the danger of his situation became 
more and more alarming. The wind blew 
bard, threatening a storm ; the day was 
closing and no one then able to manage 
the vessel. Looking about him for means 
of escape, in case of sudden emergenc}^ 
he spied the boat on one side the vessel ; 
he flattered himself, that with the means 
of a lever, he could set it afloat. But it 
now occurred to him, that a better chance 
for his preservation was the rescuing of 
the master from detention ; and not doubt- 
ing that, with his co-operation, he could 
reduce the crew to subjection in their

MAZES OF LIFE. 1S7 
}3resent helpless state, he resolved^ at all 
visks, on the attempt. 
Provided with a pair of double-barreled 
pistols, he went down to the cabin. He 
tried the door, it was fastened, but not of 
sufficient strength to withstand his repeat- 
ed attacks, and mat with little obstruction 
from any on. On entering^, he soon per- 
ceived that he could not dariv any 
assistance from this mm, Th(gy bad 
secured one of his legs by means of a 
chain, but so ineffectually bound his arms, 
that he contrived to free them from con- 
finement, This enabled him to unlock a 
drawer within his reach : then, in order 
to derive during" his captivity all the con-- 
solation he had any conception of, he 
poured down his throat as much ardent 
spirits as brought him to the ground. 
There our Hero found him, lying at full

lengvb, like a log, still chained by the 
leg", and io a state of absolute helplessness. 
In the mean time, the ship was driven 
about at a furious rate : in what direction 
no one could tell, and very few able to 
heed.  All of a sudden, a dreadful crush 
was heard.  It was the? signal of death to 
the crew. Xhe ship's^ keel had struck 
upon some ro,cl>j th^e waters were gushing 
through the gap, and the hold wa^ filling 
^pace. 
With a velocity instigated by a sense of 
the danger, Domville sprung upon deck. 
He recollected the boat, and by the time 
be got it ready to launch, the vessel had 
sunk so near the edge of the water, that 
on lowering it on the waves, he easily 
prevented its upseting. But in tak- 
ing a hurried leap, he missed his aim 
and fell into the sea. Unable to cope

with the stormy element, an4 be but an 
indifferent swimmer, he g-ave himself up for 
lost : however, instinctively, throwing about 
his arms, as is ever the case in the act of 
drowning*, the edge of the boat came 
within his gripe, to which he clung; and 
recovering from the astounding effect of 
his plung"G, by a violent effort, succeeded 
in springing within its area. Scarely had 
it been driven without th& vortex of the 
larger vessel, when this latter sunk, en- 
gulphed by tlie agitated waves. 
Thus terminated the short and merry lives 
of the crew : and the only survivor drenched, 
shivering with cold, in a frail skiff, half 
filled with water, night rapidly coming 
on, and the storm unabating, had not a 
much more cheering prospect. Still all 
hope was not fled, he might be picked up

THE HYPOCONDRIAC. 
On one of the southernmost points of 
France, not far from Antibes, on the shores 
of the Mediterranean, upon a rising ground 
in the centre of a wood, stands a French 
Chateau of moderate size ; erected about 
the middle of the 17th century. The late 
Owner had displayed much taste in laying 
out the grounds and in tracing walks and

tivenues through the plantation. His pri-^ 
vate worth, the steadiness of his principles 
both religious and political, tog^ether with 
the toleration he manifested towards those 
who maintained different tenets, had 
mainly secured his property from devasta- 
tion, during the most furious effervesence 
of the French Revolution. 
The singular character of the present 
Occupier produced the same effect from 
different causes; and no other injury was 
done to the estate, except what was com- 
mitted through his own neglect. Trees, 
shrubs, every plant was suffered to grow 
wild and to decay, untrimmed, unpruned 
and unattended. The walks and garden 
were choked with wee^ls, and the build- 
ings falling to ruins for want of repairs. 
His whole household consisted of himself 
and an aged woman, ^itb the addition of

ohe domestic animal, in the shape of a 
large tabby cat. Even that creature would 
have been discarded, had not the houses 
keeper made an obstinate stand in its favor^ 
protesti.^ g that if Puss must go, she would 
follow, and that he must turn them both 
out together, as she would not live in this 
gloomy solitude, deprived of every com- 
panion. His temporal concerns were ma- 
naged by an attorney, his nearest akin, 
who naturally expected to inherit the 
estate. This professional gentleman, whe- 
ther relying on that expectancy, as on a 
certainty, or whether influenced by honesty, 
abstractedly of any other consideration, 
proved no unfaithful steward. 
The retired habits of Mr. D'Aumont, the 
peculiarity of his garb, struck with awe 
the country people round, kept them at a 
respectful distance and prevented him from

being annoyed with their intrusion. But, 
alas! while he was an object of dread to 
others, he more and more became a prey 
to all the terrors superstition can conjure 
life. 
He was one of those characters that 
knew no moderation in the prevailing fer-

As a younger brother, his parents 
brought him up for the Church : they 
had intended him for the more active and 
useful calling of the Priesthood : but he, 
in the ardor of youth, impressed with the 
belief that this middle course was only 
compounding with God and Satan^ insist- 
ed upon taking the stricter vows of some 
religious order, and he brought his parents 
at length to assent. The revolution re-

and exchanged the monotony of monachal

seclusion for the activity, the iricessant 
variety, of a worldly life. Pleased with 
the novelty of the scene and gradually 
silencing- any compunctious visiting-s, he, 
smitten with the enticements of the Syren, 
became her votary, entered the army, 
fougbt in several engagements, got pro- 
moted ; and, at the age of 55, having out- 
lived every other child, upon his father's 
demise, succeeded to the estate, with a 
broken constitution, with a mind sobered 
by tlve satiety x)f worldly pleasures, and 
assailed by those reflections that are 
naturally suggested to the thoughtful, 
when verging towards the close of life. 
Reflections sucli as these, led him back 
to a recollection of his younger days. The 
numerous passages out of the scriptures, 
the doctrines in his catechism, the precepts 
of his masters, the stern injunctions, the

awful warnings of his sanctified abbot, the 
expostulations of his parents, now struck 
upon his heart as so many Voices from the 
grave ; and his conscience awoke. 
The infractions of the Monachal vows, 
that solemn pact, to which he had bound 
himself, and in which he had pledged his 
soul's salvation, that he would devote his 
whole earthly being to the service of his 
God, had not only been broken, but the 
acts of that being were glaring infractions 
of every ordinance enjoined. His punish- 
ment already was begun : A'^dissolute life 
had brought on a premature old age, and 
an early grave awaited him. 
In the dread of a speedy dissolution, he 
hastened to endeavour his peace with 
Heaven, by those means he deemed most 
efficacious. The rigid observance of every 
regulation and penance ordained by the

eanons of bis order he once more enforced 
on himself; the monkish garb again 
resumed and never afterwards quitted. 
His desire for seclusion increased with the 
fervour of penitentiary zeal ; yet, by a 
singular contradiction in his wishes, whilst 
he courted solitude, he dreaded being alone. 
It was, however, not recorded of him 
that he had committed any other misdeeds 
than those sins, usually incident to the 
votaries of the world : and the weight of 
blood, except what was shed in honorahh 
warfare, did not press upon his heart. 
But in his present gloomy and c^esponding 
disposition, every venial offence was mag- 
nified into a heinous crime, and the severity 
of macerations, increasing the mental 
horrors that haunted him, he fancied him- 
self an object of God's reprobation and as 
such, dooniiid to eternal perdition*

He seldom, ifever, strayed beyond the 
precincts of his demesne ; and, on the 
closing of the night, the wretched mourner 
sought the almost silencious society of his 
Gouvernanie. Even that sHsfht induls^ence 
he would grudge himself, as a departure 
from the established rules of his convent ; 
to his room he would compel his steps ; 
and, when immured within its gloomy 
enclosure, the thoughts of death,  the 
dread of a hereafter rushed upon his soul 
with redoubled horrors. 
However the prevalence of a calm, 
serene, starry, night; had a corresponding 
effect on him. The sublime spectacle of 
the Universe displayed^ perhaps at that 
time, more apparently to the intellectual 
eye, the known operations of nature, re- 
gulated as they are, by general, immutable 
laws, must in some degree enlarge the

often affects the intellect of the contemp- 
lative, religious Solitary. 
But, when dark, opake clouds invaded 
the sky, and the wind in hollow gusty 
blasts foretold tlie approaching storm, 
during this apparent disorganization of 
nature, the wretched penitent dreaded, lest 
the forceful hurricane, bursting through 
every obstruction, should evoke around 
him fiends the most hideous to hurl 
him to his final doom.

the marvellous that was added, in order to 
eke out the scantiness of real informa- 
tion. He was represented by turns as a 
conjuror, as a worker in miracles: as a 
devil and as a saint ; and stories were not 
lacking to establish each qualification. 
But the new comers, having enougli of 
their own concerns to fill up their time, 
paid little attention to such ridiculous 
tales. They, however, felt for the 
sufferer, and occasionally endeavoured to 
rectify the conceptions of the wonder- 
loving narrators, when they perceived some 
chance of removing the infatuation. 
One evening, the young gentleman with 
his sister, in the prosecution of their walk, 
happened to trespass on the premises 
of their solitary neighbour, he, at that 
time, being the subject of their conver- 
sation. They heard, issuing from an ad-

and fell at full length on the ground in a 
swoon. 
The two bye-standers hastened to him. 
They had raised and placed him against 
a tree, and were employing the means of 
restoring him to life, when the light of a 
lanthorn announced the approach of another 
person. It was the aged house-keeper, 
who, being alarmed on account of her 
master's long absence, came to seek him. 
On perceiving two strangers busy about 
the sufferer, her fears at first suggested the 
idea that tbey were murdering him ; but 
their appearance soon dispelled any such 
prepossession. The gentleman told her to 
stay /with his sister, that he would soon 
return with a day labourer, whose dwel- 
Ung was near at hand, and that he with his 
assistance would carry- him to the house.

mont was reviving", but delirious, ami 
pushing from him his officious attendants. 
The tvro men now deemed it expedient 
to secure his arms, whereupon he became 
furious, fancying" himself beset by fiends : 
and on finding himself mastered, howled 
out so horribly, as if he already felt the 
dreadful tortures his distempered imagi- 
nations so vividly pourtrayed. Yet it was 
remarked that, at intervals, the soothing 
voice of the young Lady made some im- 
pression : it seemed to allay the fever of 
his mind. Her brother encouraged her ta 
pour into his ear words of consolation, 
hopes of mercy, assurances of a benevolent 
of a beneficent, Deity. 
** No, no. Not for me \ Never I never I 
never !" was all he did reply. Still he 
listened to the strains and became more 
tractable ; and when her handkerchief

wiped away the h'lg drops that bedewed 
his face, he did not avert his head. By 
the time they were in' sight of the house, 
he requested to be released, alledging that 
he could now walk by himself: they com- 
plied, and followed him to the entrance. 
The Gouvernante opened the door for 
his admission.  Ere he entered, he, turn- 
insf round, sternly said.

This is mine !" 
And abruptly turning from them, he 
hurried into his dwelling.

boiirs who could not but sympathize in 
his fate, 'paid him a visit, in hopes of alle- 
viating- the sense of his misery. The house- 
keeper, after some hesitation, admitted 
them, and they were shewn into a spacious 
room, glooiny from the depression of its 
roof, from the narrow dimensions of the 
windows, from the scantiness of furniture, 
and from an ancient tapestry that covered 
the walls. The subject wrought upon 
it represented the last judgment, delineat- 
ing all the horrors that a fanatical mind, 
incessantly brooding over the appealing 
scene, could conceive. 
The Patient was lying upon his pallet, 
on his back, much debilitated from the 
severity of the late struggles : his eyes 
were fixed, his lips were parched, his skin 
felt dry with other feverish symptoms. 
But he i*e]axed the sternness of his fea-

tures, when he beheld again the heavenly 
visitor, and heard the same voice, whose 
sweetness had suspended the tortures of his 
mind in their severest visitation. She 
had brought with her what she deemed re- 
quisite for one in his situation, and her 
winninsf wavs induced him to swallow 
those cordials, to submit to that diet, to 
allow that attendance, indispen:3able for 
his recovery. 
Their joint care partly effected that 
recovery. D'Aumont became^ in conse- 
quence, so far socialized as to pay occasio- 
nal short visits to his w orthy neighbours, 
which thev ever sousrht to encouraoe him 
to repeat and to prolong : they were, in 
return, freely admitted into the chateau. 
This reciprocity of civilities, the kind 
offices it suggested, certainly wrought an 
alteration for the better in the Recluse, both

only partial, the relapses, though less severe, 
were stiil freqnent, and as usual more vio- 
lent during" the prevalence of stormy wea- 
ther. His ag-itation rose in proportion to 
the fury of the tempest. 
It was on an evening* particularly stormy^ 
when the young* gentleman, who was now 
well acquainted with the causes that acted 
most forcibly on the mental imbecility of 
the recluse, said to his sister. 
" This is a terrible, boisterous night, for 
our distempered neighbour. Suppose I 
call on him. Perhaps he may be induced 
to leave his gloomy home and to spend the 
night less miserably with us." 
** Do so. Brother, and I, in the mean 
time, will get every thing ready for his 
reception.'* 
The young gentleman took his staff and

departed, attended by his faithful spaniel. 
The mention of this dog reminds me of 
another favorable sympton of D'Aumont's 
recovery. Sultan had been of late much 
noticed and often stroked and patted by 
him ; and he felt gratified when the animal, 
returning his notice, w^ould now and then 
lick his hand. Even the old cat was a 
gainer from the alteration, being now en- 
couraged to leap on his knees, on which it 
would repose, expressing its sense of the 
favor, in grateful well pleased, purrings.  
The beneficial effects of friendly greetings 
are not restricted to the human species : 
Domestic animals are also gratified with 
such interchanges from their owners, and 
the morals of both are ameliorated. 
" Ah, Sir, cried the Gouvernante, on 
admitting him, it is very kind of you,  
my poor master !-^Come in, Sir,  the

weather is terrible.  I never before heard 
him cry, pray, groan and howl so pite- 
ously.  Hark ! do you hear him ? Yet 
it is nothing" to what has been.  I fear 
he will exhaust himself to death.''  So 
sayings they made to his chamber. 
On entering, the visitor appearing not 
to notice his agitation, gaily inquired 
after his health, adding^ that he was 
bearer of an invitation from his sister to 
him, to supper this very night; that she 
would not be denied, and that she also 
insisted on his taking a bed in her house. 
Then, with a tone of authority, he bade 
the woman wrap him up warm, for the 
night was cold and stormy, and to pre* 
pare attending her master, for she was 
included in the invitation. 
The Recluse heard this address seem-

ingly unmoved, and in a liollow, sepul- 
chral voice : 
** From this spot 1 must stir no more.  
The fiends are abroad.  I beheld divers 
of the Dead emerge from their graves, 
and pointing to mine own, they flitted 
past me, flapping my face with their 
funeral vestments.-^There !  There ! see 
you that pit close to my feet, all bestrewed 
with bones and carnal fragments : it is 
not dug by human hands. This my 
earthly house.  Would to heaven it were 
my last!'  Wherefore array me in these 
gaudy trappings? I tell you the bride- 
groom's feast is gone by. Now tolls the 
bell for the burial of the Reprobate." 
Still he was passive in their hands, 
and they contrived to induce him out of 
his gloomy abode. The storm had by 
this time considerably abated j he felt

relieved by the beverage they liad made 
him take, and the open air had an effect 
equally exhilarating on him : he was also 
enlivened by the cheerfulness of his 
present companion, and by the prospect 
of a speedy visit to the angelical lady. 
Yet his tremors would now and then 
return. ** Surely this is most arrogant 
temerity.  'Tis disobeying God's com- 
mands. He ordered me seclusion, and I 
am abroad.  He enjoined me silence^ 
and I am communing with sinful man. 
He prescribed penance and morti^* 
fication, and I am in my way to feasts, 
to merry-makings, and to carouse in 
unhallowed dwellings.  O, there will 
come a retribution a severe retribution 
for this. There !  There! (with a pierc- 
ing shriek) it is already come. Look ! 
I hear him!  I see him!  He stands

erect upon the waters, moving" onwards,  
he beckons to me.  Now he vanishes, 
doubtless to re-appear in a more horrific 
form." 
And in truth, the vision, for this time, 
was real. His companion heard and be- 
held also. The young* man had chosen 
the sea-side as a more pleasant, if not a 
nearer way, for his intended guests. His 
attention had been suddenly attracted 
towards that element by the hallooing 
voice of a human being, ^y the liglit 
the two lanterns afforded^ he beheld the 
object apparently moving upon the surface 
of the waves ; who having: made a sij^nal 
and called out for assistance, sunk and 
disappeared ! 
The Gouvernante crossed herself; 
D'Aumont terrified at the sight of the 
apparition, would have hurried back the

way he came } but his companion grasped 
him too firml}^, and in a tone of authority : 
'^Remain where you are.  The first 
duty of man is to relieve a fellow creature 
in distress. Your services may be wanted.'* 
Still the Recluse struggled to be released. 
^ What  Would you leave me here by 
myself.'* He suddenly became passive 
in his hands. " *Tis well,  Some wretch 
in the act of drowning. I must to his 
rescue. You take this lantern and hold 
it aloft." 
These words^ deliberately delivered, 
had due effect on his companion. He stood 
motionless, and the other hastened to doff 
his upper garments, fearlessly dashed in 
the water, making strait to that point 
^here he had seen the object disappear. 
It was a distance of about three hundred 
yards, more than two-thirds of which^

however, he could wade through^; having- 
got thus far, he stood a moment to examhie 
and listen,  naught could he discern, but 
still fancied he heard the attempts of a 
person struggling amidst the billows. A 
hurried voice of distress then struck his 
ear. It was instantaneously suppressed, 
as if the rolling sea now covered the mouth 
that uttered it. 
Our adventurer hesitated no longer, com- 
mitting himself to the waves, he reached 
the spot, just in time to seize the man by 
his ankle, the only pai t then above water : 
for the wretch, exhausted, had yielded to 
his fate, and was sinking to rise no more. 
His preserver, then turning his face to tlie 
light he could still perceive, with the help 
of one arm only, swam till he found footings 
himself by the continuance of most ardu- 
ous exertions, nearly reduced to impotence.

In that state, he hallooed to his com- 
panion to hasten to his assistance. D'An- 
mont obeyed the summons; he sternly 
strode towards him with his garments on, 
and made his way through the waves, un- 
heeding every inconvenience, every dan- 
ger, as if he were impassible, unmoved 
even by the joyful exclamations of the 
successful adventurer, still panting, who 
cried out : 
** I have found him.  Here he is.  I 
. hope we shall save him," 
In the mean time, he succeeded in 
raising the person's head above water; 
and when his assistant joined him, he, 
with his help, got the body upon his 
shoulders : he then undertook to convey 
him to the shore, where the old woman, 
by herself, anxiously and trembliogly 
awaited their return. This he at length

effected, but not without much difficulty : 
the distance was considerable, the bottom 
very uneven, and heavy the burden. 
As soon as they landed, the Gouvernante 
was made to kneel. On her knees with his 
head somewhat raised the stranger was 
placed. Whilst his Preserver was putting* 
on his clothes, they consulted on the best 
manner of disposing of the drowned 
person. D'Aumont's habitation was yet 
by far the nearest point; though it did 
not furnish the best accommodations, still 
such could be conveyed thither, and the 
old lady offered the use of her bed, with 
an assurance, that it was provided with 
every requisite. 
In consequence, our robust Philanthro- 
pist, once more took up his burden, and 
with the help of every assistance the 
other two could afford, proceeded to

the place they had started from^ which, 
at length, he contrived to reach. 
His charge was then immediately strip- 
ped of his apparel and laid within the 
warm blankets, and, under his directions, 
the usoal means were resorted to for 
his recovery : D'Aumont performing his 
part with a willing readiness. Whilst 
this operation was going on, his neigh- 
bour left him, hastened to the nearest 
surgeon, attended him to the house, 
heard his prognostics, saw him busy 
about his patient, then returned home to 
release his sister from the alarm occasion- 
ed by his long absence, tie shortly in- 
formed her of the cause, and made to his 
room for another dress. 
She, in the mean time, collected and 
ordered to the chateau every thing re- 
quisite. They both awaited the servant's

down to supper, and, after spending a

repose, intending to pay an early visit to

He informed them that his patient, who was 
a stranger and appeared a gentleman, was 
so far recovered as to be able to sit up and 
had taken some little sustenance. He,

iiowever, advised them to postpone their 
visit, as he had left him in a sound slumber, 
from which he prognosticated favourable 
results. 
They, in consequence, delayed their de- 
parture and invited him to sit down with 
them to breakfast, to which he assented. 
His entertainers judging from his having 
sat up all night, in anxious attendance on 
Jbis patient, that he must be in want of rest, 
oflfered him the use of a bed ; but he ex- 
cused himself, alledging that he had several 
professional calls to make, which he could 
not well put off, and departed. 
About noon, the weather clearing up, 
brother and sister proceed to D'Aumont s 
chateau. In compliance with her desire, 
they followed the track by the sea shore. 
When they reached tlie spot upon which 
the stranger had been brought to land,

she inquired how far he had to cany him 
through the water. Being informed of the 
distance, with an assurance that he had 
only one third of the way to swim : 
** And could you, said she with a coun- 
tenance^ wherein praises and reproaches 
were mingled, could you thus venture your 
life ?  O Brother ! had you perished, what 
would have become of me ? (Pressing his 
hand in both her's.) 
He was silent : he knew that a second 
reflection would do him ampler justice. 
" Yes, she resumed, you did right."  
But let*s away, I dread the very place.'' 
On arriving, they met the house-keeper, 
who with joyful alacrity told them that not 
only the gentleman was much recovered, but 
her master was getting quite another man. 
** You shall see  you shall see.  Step 
softly, though he is now awake/'

Without comprehending the whole of 
the intelligence, thus conveyed, they fol- 
lowed her to the patient's chamber. 
The door opened in front of the fire 
place : on one side they beheld the Recluse 
intensely watching every motion of the 
stranger, who, placed in an old fashioned, 
high backed, unu chair, was so bolstered up 
with pillows that he could hardly turn his 
head. He was sipping some coffee out of 
a cup he held, and every drop he swallow- 
ed, his Host felt as a cordial to his own 
heart. 
As the visitors remained at the entrance, 
fearful to disturb the patient, and much 
affected by the scene, D'Aumont perceived 
them. He arose and approached tliem.  
In lieu of his wonted garments, still too 
much impregnated with sea water for wear, 
he had wrapped himself up in a blanket,

strapped round his loins  this his only cq- 
vering', having", long- before, discarded the 
use of linen. Thus arrayed, his tall ema- 
ciated figure appeared strikingly pictures- 
que : bald was his head, sallow, and mace- 
rated his countenance, hairy his brown 
breast and shrunk limbs, and solemn his 
deportment ; yet a smile of contentedness 
played about and illumined his otherwise 
rigid, gloomy features  Whilst stretch- 
ing out an arm, he pointed to the stranger, 
and in a well pleased, subdued, voice :

They beheld and instantly recognized 
each other ! 
The cup dropped from his hand ; his 
eyes were for a moment rivetted with sur- 
prize on the lovely apparition, he could only 
say  Louise !  My ever beloved !  Ere 
thev closed : and his enfeebled frame was 
overpowered by the tumultuous tide of joy 
rushing to his heart. He let fall his hands. 
A sudden flush had reddened his cheeks. 
Again they became pallid ; and his head 
sunk on the pillows, every limb motionless, 
his lips only still muttering to himself the 
beloved name. 
Miss de Clermont did not faint. The 
sufl*erings she had borne had subjected her 
to self controul, and endued her with un- 
usual fortitude. Still this sudden, unex-

at the effect the meeting produced, could

his, he felt a gentle pressure as if the ap-

Louise, in the mean time, was bathing 
his temples and ministering every reviving 
application; the sound of her voice and the 
touch of her hand more reviving still  and 
he unclosed his eyes. 
The first object they met was his anx-

THE HONEY MOON. 
jHAVING now brought the Lovers to- 
gether, the result is anticipated.  A wed- 
ding takes place, and our story would 
here conclude in the way usual with such 
productions : but that we are loth to quit 
the subject, presuming we have something 
more to tell, worth narrating.  Besides 
Henry de Solignac is yet unprovided for.

We flatter onrs^elves that our fair Readers 
are so far interested in his fate, as they 
would rise discontented from the perusal, 
were he suffered to live on a Bachelor, 
or even were they left in doubt as to his 
future destination. For their gratification 
and our own, we hereby devote a few more 
pages to the elucidation of divers, impor- 
tant matters, connected therewith. 
The account Domville gave of himself, 
in addition to what the Reader is already 
apprised of, is soon told.  It shall be given 
in his own words. 
*' Amidst the horrors that surrounded 
me, knowing that the wind was blowing 
from the south, I still held some faint 
hopes of reaching the French coast. I 
had wrapped a white kerchief round my 
head, both as a substitute for my hat, 
then otherwise employed, and as a signal

that might attract notice. But night 
came on : as it prevented me from dis- 
tinguishing objects, so I became undis- 
cernible to others. The only remaining 
hope then rested in being able to keep 
the boat afloat ; but for all my unceasing 
exertions, the water was gaining on me.  
Still I toiled on.  I, at length became so 
exhausted, that my arms refused their 
office. Aware that in a very few seconds 
the boat must go down, 1 gave myself up 
for lost, stretched out my arms and 
looked up to heaven in despair.'* 
** At that moment, 1 perceived lights 
movino; at a moderate distance from me. 
I uttered shrieks of joy and of distress. 
I could not repeat them : the boat, now 
brimful of water, sunk, and I was immersed 
in the turbulent billows. How you suc- 
ceeded in rescuing me from a peril so

imminent, as I was then reft of knowledge, 
I can have no recollection.  All that I 
know is, that to you 1 am indebted for the 
preservation of my life, and to this dear 
bride of mine, for every sweet blessing 
that renders life delightful/* 
The stock of wealth Domville brought 
into the family, proved a very seasonable 
acquisition. Entertaining no wish and 
foreseeing no likelihood of a separation 
from his brother-in-law, his ready money 
was drawn from the bank into which he 
had placed it, ere he had ventured on his 
first voyage, and partly laid out in im- 
provements upon the estate. In the ex- 
ecution of which, they all took an active 
part. The exercise proved to each a 
fund of health and of constant cheerful- 
ness : and, by the privation of each other's 
society it enforced during the hours of

MAZES OP LIFE. 183 
employment, the sweetness of their re- 
union was tenfold increased. 
It was during one of those evenings, 
when rehearsing the former events of their 
lives, Domville said to his Bride : 
" My dearest Love,  how could you 
have been so cruel as to forsake me in the 
manner you did : flying from Paris to 
this remote place, in order to conceal 
yourself for ever from my search." 
" I'll tell you all about it, said Solignac, 
laughing and rising.  Nay, Louise, stay, 
Don't run away again from him.'* 
"Henry,  You have my free assent to 
impart all you know of me. A wife's 
every act should be known to her husband, 
whether it be done before or after 
marriage ; but in modesty, I must not 
sit by and hear my own praises; chiefly

when a sister's case is pleaded by her 
partial brother; a Lover the only judge." 
In this sportive mood she escaped from 
them^ and Solignac resumed. 
" The plain truth is, Louise loved you 
long" before our departure. First, for my 
sake, and afterwards, I suppose, for her 
own,'' 
** Heavens !  Had I but known !" 
** I, myself, knew nothing, till she told 
me all." 
** If but the slig^htest encouras^ement 
had been held out to me," 
" Nay, Domville,  I believe, in those 
cases, etiquette or propriety requires the 
first declaration from the gentleman." 
'* Alas ! a sense of delicacy restrained 
me. My circumstances so precarious! 
Not a livre I could in reality call my own : 
your's appeared the very reverse. '

^' Yet we coiikl but suppose you had 
the command of wealth. The name you 
bear, your intimacy with the English 
Ambassador, your influence over the

presumptions in favor of that belief.  
My sister did not deny herself the plea- 
sure of your society, so lon^ as we were kept 
in ignorance of our own affairs: the 
match did not then appear disproportion- 
ate ; but my father's demise dispelled the 
illusion. Your silence and the supposed 
iiisparity of circumstances brought poor 
Louise to acknowledge that, as her Love 
had now no chance of requital, Prudence 
enjoined her to forbear the sight cf the 
object : thus, i alone had the benefit of 
your subsequent visits." 
** But never will be obliterated the 
impression she made on me, the day of

our departure. Early in the tnornin!^, 
she entered my chamber, whilst I was 
busy in preparations. She appeared be- 
fore me, pale and distressed ; her eyes 
unbedewed with tears ; yet it was appa- 
rent that they had plentifully flowed ; nor 
"Was the struggle within at an end : Love, 
though vanquished, still remained unsub- 
dued. She attempted a sedateness, a 
self-command in her maqner, but it soon 
became flurried and precipitate, her lips 
quivered as she spoke, and her voice was 
tremulous in its sound. **^ 
" Brother, said she, a passion like mine, 
is not to be subdued, unless the sufferer is 
fully convinced that the smallest hope of 
a return can no longer be entertained. 
Therefore, I beseech yon, transcribe this

bosom) Let it be the only parting farew

we bid our mutual friend.  And, pray, 
let me not be called before the post chaise, 
that is to convey us away, be ready to start." 
** In an agony of grief, she turned from 
me, and withdrew.  I perused the paper, 
understood its full import, approved, ad- 
mired, my noble-minded sister.  I hasten- 
ed after her, caught the lovely, self-prac- 
tising moralist in my arms, pressed her to 
my bosom, mingled my tears with her's, 
encouraged, applauded, extolled her, and 
assured her that, at all events, she could 
depend upon one lover. That assurance 
was then and is now the truth.  Upon 
my soul, Domville, you cannot love her 
more than I do.'* 
Here the happy husband proudly smiled, 
conscious of superiority.'* 
*' Thou, Unbeliever! let thy vanity then 
hear the sequel. We brought her here.

Her strength of mind, the rationality, the 
benevolent usefulness of her active pur- 
suits, had so far effected a cure, that she 
could cheerfully perform every duty of 
her station, and your influence no longer 
disturbed her peace. Bnt here you are, 
dropped, as it were, from the clouds, or 
rather risen out of the sea, and the case is 
become, I fear, incurable. Now, that you 
know all, we'll to her and bring her 
back." 
Mr. Domville bad not omitted writing 
to Mr. Sandhurst, informing him of the 
shipwreck and imparting the cause of his 
present detention. He received a reply 
full of gratulations on his escape, with 
respects to his lady and his best wishes for 
their mutual felicity, enclosing a remit- 
tance of twice the number of pounds

sterling' that days had elapsed, since his 
departure from England. 
The Recluse, (tor we must not omit 
him) was become, as his Gouvernante had 
averred, quite another man. His share in 
the rescue of Domville from a watery 
grave had taught him his use in society. 
The sacred impulse of humanity con- 
tributed more to his amendment, than 
even the charms of his Angelical Monitrice 
as he now emphatically called her. Sway- 
ed by her example, he busied himself in 
looking out for objects of distress : but 
with so much of his usual fervor, that it 
was endeavoured to restrict him in his 
largess and to guide his hand. This 
Mrs. Domville undertook. Her bland 
authority was acknowledged and obeyed.' 
She also insisted upon a more generous 
diet, and gave instructions to his house-

keeper accordingly, and they were c6til- 
plied with. In one of his visits, perceiv- 
ing his^ good neighbours actively employ- 
ed, himself alone idle. 
" Can't I also do something ? thought he. 
Sure my lands afford scope enough for 
labour.'* Fraught with this idea, he has- 
tened home and took to his spade ; but so 
eager to do much in a short time, that the 
old woman was compelled to help him 
into the house. 
The family, on calling upon him the 
next day, were informed of the circum- 
stance. The lady again interfered, and 
positively forbade any more than a very 
moderate number of yards to be dug in the 
course of one day ; adding, that, as his 
garden and grounds required infinitely 
more labour than one person could be- 
stow, he should employ the hands of those

who would benefit him and themselves by 
their hire, and that her brother and hus- 
band would call at times, to assist him in 
directing and superintending the men. 
By such means, his estimation of life 
increased as it became valuable to others ; 
he could enjoy company and bear seclusion. 
Superstitious horrors gradually faded from 
his mind : and, from which ever quarter 
of the sky came the hurricane, it now blew 
away unheeded by him, or only associated 
itself with the idea of the distress it inflict- 
ed on others. 
Thus, happily for themselves and hap- 
pily for their friejids and dependants, the 
three members of the worthy family be- 
held the dawn and decline of each day. 
Yet, without any invidious distinction, 
Solignac, reduced to his present obscure 
situation, was the most praise- worthy. It

required no effort in the married couple to 
fulfil their destination. But his lofty 
mind, capable of planning and executing 
the most heroic achievements, he had 
brought down to objects of bare utility, of 
domestic, daily occurrences: and that soul, 
replete with Philanthropy, which had im- 
pelled him to venture his life, through every 
danger and hardship, for the amelioration 
of his native country, had contracted its 
wide sphere of action within the narrow 
precincts of family concerns, and was 
otherwise engrossed only with the petty 
concerns of an insignificant hamlet. Thus 
Apollo^ driven from Oljmpus, socialized 
the roving shepherds. Many a fair Lady 
sighed for him. He laughed at sighs*, 
deeming himself invulnerable.

ter marriageable, when do you intend to 
take to a wife?  Surely Mr. Domvilles 
felicity ought to afford you some encou- 
ragement to try the matrimonial state/* 
** I will, Madam/' replied ihe light heart- 
ed, ungallant, ** Bachelor, as soon as 1 meet 
with a partner, whom I can love as well 
as I do this sister of mine/' 
As he spoke, he kissed her affectionately 
and, bowing to the Lady, with the nimble 
stride of conscious, contented, indepen- 
dence, went out to prune his fruit trees. 
Laugh on, thou short sighted Boaster ! 
Thy Conqueror is at hand. To-morrow 
she will claim the enthral ment of thy 
heart and,  at her feet, must thou tender 
its submission !

LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP. 
About the latter end of March, after 
a snowy night, the sun in the morning 
shone cloudless. The two gentlemen had 
selected a very indecorous employment, in 
order to fill up the interval from the period 
of their rising to that of breakfast.  
They stuck up a pole, midway, in the 
private walk that led from their house

to the public road : then, stationing them- 
selves at the opposite extremities, they, 
provided with shovels, gave out the signal, 
and, with the eagerness of school-lads, be- 
stirred themselves in clearing the track of 
snow, right and left. The contest being 
who should first gain the pole. 
We are aware how scornfully will be 
derided by many a stately Reader a past- 
time so boyish : they, forsooth, would deem 
it much more becoming the dignity of 
their manhood, in a similar circumstance, 
to mope by the fire side  yawn stretch 
their limbs open and fling by some book

Lady and the meal appeared, become in a 
right cue for ^iWi and pfisaw, which hum- 
our would probably cling* to them tie

Louise was watching through her cham- 
ber window her husband and brother thus 
employed ; when the maid came up with 
a message, imparting that she had shewn 
into the breakfast-room a stranger, who 
had inquired after Mr. and Mrs. Domville. 
She in consequence went down, and beheld 
a person who, by both his appearance and 
address, claimed, in addition to her wonted 
courtesy, all the respectful regard, due to a 
realf English, Gentleman. 
The Stranger introduced himself to the 
Lady as an ancient, intimate, acquaintanc

of Mr. Domville, adding that he was ex- 
tremely desirous of seeing him, after so 
long a separation. 
*' I can assure you, Sir, that my husband 
will feel to the full as much pleasure in the 
meeting.  Mr. Langley, I presume.'' 
The Gentleman bowed, surprised. 
** How could you know me, Madam ?  
To my recollection, I never before had the 
happiness to see you." 
" Oh, Sir, your name and character are 
familiar to us. Indeed, I can now vouch 
for the accuracy given of your person." 
^* And does he still remember his old 
Friend ?>' 
'^ He often avers that could he but see 
him again, he would have nothing more to 
desire.  I will call him in.  "

Langley had also been watching the ardu- 
ous contest).'* 
''He is, Sir  the other is my Brother.'' 
** For what purpose, I wonder, such 
hurried exertions ^'' - 
I would tell, thought Louise, conscious 
of her self being the object. Solignac 
however, unravelled the Mystery : he, 
having first reached the pole, exclaimed 
with exultation. 
Yictoire ! Victoire ! 
And coming up to his sister, who had 
thrown open the sash, cried out: 
** A present, Louise, iu peux aller au vil-

" This was his own portion ; not a shovel 
full, he averred, would he allow to any one, 
on any account.'* 
During their debate, the visitor with 
Louisa went out to them ; as they ap- 
proached the contenders, she took the lead. 
* Mr. Langley, my dear !*' 
Domville rapidly turned round, breath- 
less  stared a moment in joyous suspense 
then flung by his shovel and rushed into 
his arms. 
After the first effusion, Domville pre- 
sented his brother-in-law to his friend. 
The introductory salutations over, they 
proceeded to the breakfast room ; tliat 
meal, however, was again delayed in con- 
sequence of Mr. Langley happening to 
say :

hard upon your hospitality^ I have left at the

** I will go directly, cried Domville,

awaiting this addition of company ; the 
new guest of course was the subject of 
their conversation.  The two friends short- 
ly returned  Mr. Langley entered first, 
ushering in a young Lady, apparently not

their sex.  The two Ladies understood 
and knew each other at the first glance. 
The father looked pleased at his fair enter- 
tainer, and proud of his daughter.  Dora- 
ville renewed his felicitations, boasting of 
his having anticipated such seeming excel- 
lence, when she was only ten years of age. 
But Solignac- 
The apparition was such as if it had 
dropped from Heaven, in heavenly array.

held since the days of his boyhood. And

most propitious for its appearance.  Other 
beauties she had in reserve, but these were 
sufficient for a first impression. 
His expressive features, his large black 
eyes, had now full employment in intimat- 
ing the sensations of a heart, unused to 
dissemble. They spoke too plainly to 
escape even the inexperienced object of 
his nascent love. His Sister became 
alarmed ; Domville inly laughed at the 
scoffer's fall ; and Langley could not but 
feel additional pride in the potency of his 
Daughter's spell. 
After breakfast^ when the Ladies with- 
drew and Mr. Langley had returned to the 
Inn, in order to give some directions to his 
servants, De Clermont took Domville 
aside.  Thus began the impas^ionate youth, 
almost breathless.

besides so peculiarly fascinating- in her 
foreign air and manner. Nay, don't banter 
me.  It were ungenerous : I cannot now 
retaliate. But do }0u think there is any 
hope?  Her youth may secure me from a 
previous engagement of the heart, though 
it cannot avert numberless rivals : and her 
father I fear, is rich  very rich.  Indeed 
you told us as much. -Ah, my case is 
hopeless! He will naturally consider most 
valuable that which he is most in posses- 
sion of.'* 
* There Solignac you wrong him.  
For your encouragement, I can tell you 
that, unless my friend is mairdy altered, 
the prospect of an increase of wealth will 
not influence him in the disposal of his 
daughter. I conceive, i moreover that, 
when }'our character is known to him, no

one will hold a more favourable place in 
his good opinion.  As to the Lad^^'s tuste, 
that is out of my power to controul : be 
your's the endeavour to mcline it in your 
favour." 
When Miss Langley came down, dres- 
sed for dinner, Henry enraptured disco- 
vered new beauties which her travelling 
attire, however elegantly becoming, had 
concealed. This meal, as did the previous 
one, passed away, hardly touched by him. 
He ied on her charms ; it seemed as if 
he could live but in her sight; as if his 
whole being was blended in her's. When 
with his sister she arose from table, his 
eyes remained gazing on the door through 
which she disappeared, and her image 
reflected and settled on his heart. Unable 
to share in the conversation, he withdrew 
in solitude to retrace each feature, to re-

hearse each expression : to recall her every 
action. The fruit trees were left iin-

Mr. Langley perceiving the affair be- 
conning serious, proposed to Domville, as 
the sun shone inviting, a turn in the gar- 
den. 
** Charles  this brother-in-law of your's 
is made of inflammable stuff.'* 
" As his first passion, it rages the more

not accept the offer of a battered heart for

" I perceived you watched him."

obtained from that scrutiny."

After tea, Mr. Langley thus entered 
upon the execution of his threat. 
*' Madam, said he gravely, it behoveth 
me to iniorm you that this good man of

possession will shew, relating to a ro- 
mantic adventure worth your hearing,  
Here it is.  I took it out of my travelling 
desk on purpose for .this occasion.  Bring

Whilst he was unfolding the precious 
document, Louise looked at her husband 
for an explanation : he winked silence to 
her and Henry ; and Langley proceeded 
to impart the contents of the paper. It 
proved no other than a certain rapturous

Never did the influence of friendship 
inspire more eloquent strains ; he had been

France. Langley heard him throughout 
with the utmost attention, and with hardly

of your brief.  Well whenever Monsieur

I object to my child changing her situation

In the mean time, I sha 1 not omit to pro- 
pitiate mj' daughter with a relation of 
what you have imparted to me. Indeed, 
the assurance of the many great and admi- 
rable qualities his actions have proved him 
to possess, is adding* the most powerful 
effect to any recommendation of mine. 
If he succeed in gaining her affections, may 
God bless the union. If he fail, I should 
be sorry  -very sorry ; but never will I 
force the inclination of my child in favour of 
any one.  Now to your Lady : inform her 
of our plans, our prospects, and of our in-

Domville, fraught with this intelligence,

hastened to Louisa's apartrnenf, where he 
found Henry with her. 
She had heard his raptures delivered in 
the warmest effusions of the heart, and was 
endeavouring to regulate his passion by 
the impressive affection of sisterly advice, 
when the favourable tidings, brought by 
Domville, made the ecstatic Lover more 
rapturous than ever. Amidst their congra- 
tulations, Louise felt regret to quit^ even 
for a temporary absence, this spot, so dear 
to her on every account. 
** But, said she good naturedly, we must 
not grudge a little inconvenience, when a 
brother's suit is to be thus promoted.'* 
Henry cauglit her in his arms, called 
her the most amiable, the most indulgent, 
of sisters ; then hastened to Mr. Langley,

of his own character, he poured out In

rapturous strains the most grateful acknow- 
ledg-ements. 
But when, with a father's permission, he 
ventured to appear in the presence of the 
Sovereign of his heart  when he sought to 
tender her for acceptance the homage of the 
purest  most fervent love :  his lofty, buo- 
yant spirit forsook him, and the conscious- 
ness of his own worth sunk before her fan- 
cied perfection. Is this the same youth- 
ful Hero, who dared the conquerors frown 
a criminal's death  the raging billows ? 
Behold ! the undaunted assertor of Man's 
independance, reduced to the voluntary 
slave of a Girl's caprice ; and, prostrate in 
trembling expectation, await from her lips 
the fiat of his destiny ! Thus, and His- 
tory warrants the remark. Love delights to 
raise its most splendid trophies upon the 
subjection of the most exalted characters.

It is but natural, however, to surmise, 
lluit her father's approval, his sister's in- 
fluence, the acknowledged merits of her 
admirer, and  the inclination of her own 
heart, obtained, in due time, her assent to 
an union, for which she was fully repaid 
by the j?er ma nent affection of an attentive, 
grateful husband. 
The day before their departure, Louise 
who, however, engaged in her own con- 
cerns, omitted not any attention that could 
encrease the felicity or mitigate the misery 
of others, found an hour to call on the 
Recluse. 
He had of late forborn his visits, scared 
away by the f/rand folks, as he called Dom- 
ville's present guests. She found him, his 
spirits depressed in consequence of the 
privation ; yet her presence had the effect 
of a sun-beam on his heart : but he sunk

again in dejection, when informed of her 
intended journey. 
*< My good Sir, (said Louise with the 
bland, insinuating tone and manner, that 
seldom failed to obtain the effect she 
wished to produce) grieve not at a tempo- 
rary separation, when it is fully in your 
power, not only to obtain an adequate 
compensation, but to render that compen- 
sation permanent." 
^' Ah, Madam ! where, in this world, 
can I find a substitute for even one of 
those visits your goodness has blessed me 
with ?" 
She then in a more serious manner.

their society and attentions that solace, 
those comforts, the friendship of strangers 
cannot adequately replace.  Believe nio, 
Sir, where no dereliction of moral princi- 
ples exists, our natural friends ought to be 
preferred to any other." 
He eagrly caught at the suggestion 
and promised immediate compliance. 
"Adieu, Mr.D'Aumont, the purpose of my 
visit is answered. Continue to indulge in 
society and in moderate exercise : these 
promote cheerful thoughts, and gradually 
discard every gloomy anticipation."  
Then, gently placing her hand on his 
arm, with other tokens of a friendly inter- 
est in his welfare, in order to mitagite, by 
mildness of expression, the severity of the 
implied reproach.  "My good friend- Z>e-

As they parted, his aged eyes were filled 
with tears. He ventured to press to his 
lips the hand that was held out to him ; 
and continued motionless on the spot, 
watching her every step, even when she 
was no longer in sight. 
On the same day, Mr. Langley took 
Domville apart.

to obtain from you ; then you will no 
longer be plagued with any petition of

Mr. Langley and Daughter put up at an 
hotel in that city ; but Domville would 
again become Renaud's lodger, whom he 
agreeably surprised by his arrival, and from 
whom he learnt that Madame D'Estelle

Tourville had brought her husband a son,

Our Hero wrote a letter to the Countess 
D*Estelle, inclosing one for Tourville, in 
which he informed them of his happy 
change and condition, and desired them to 
assure Monsieur le Cure of his respectful

intended as a display of his felicity : but 
that he knew how gratifying to the feelings 
are those marks of attention, arising from a 
remembrance grounded in esteem.

seleclion. During' a pause in the conver- 
sation, Domville could not but notice 
sundry whispers, winks and smiles of en- 
couragement interchanged around him : 
each chair was drawing closer to his, and 
every one seemed prepared to hear some 
mighty disclosure ; yet a little shyness 
'was perceptible, as fearmg that a request 
of the magnitude of that which they were 
about to solicit, might not be granted. At 
length, Louise undertaking the negotiation, 
arose, and leaning over him from behind, 
said : 
^< My Dear, Miss Langley has a favour 
to ask of you." 
" And is Miss Langley, said the shrewd 
gentleman, without altering his position, so 
very unfashionable, as to suppose that the

so characteristic of British timidity, under 
the French appellation of mauvaise honte. 
Come, Girl, stand up : urge your suit and 
our own with what eloquent perjsuasion 
you have at your tongue's end. A woman's 
curiosity is ever an over match for a man's

"Well then. Midway between War- 
wick and Stratford, we were informed 
by the turnpike man that the King of 
France, so at least he was told, had but 
lately rode in his carnage through a lane 
he pointed to us, leading to the village 
of Snitterfield, where the wake was then 
holding. This information appeared to 
us the more credible, as we knew that 
he was then travelling in these parts, 
under the name of the Comte de Lille, 
We in consequence agreed to ride after 
the exiled Monarch, curious to behold him 
in the situation of a spectator, and con- 
ceiving that he and his party would 
strangely contrast with the native partak- 
ers of an English wake.

US to the chief inn or public house of the 
place, where we recognized the Count's 
carriage in waiting-, but deserted by the 
Royal Owner, who with his kinsman 
and a French nobleman of high rank, 
had hastened to the scene of action. 
** We dismounted, and directed our 
steps to a spot on which we could discover 
a numerous group collected : Indeed the 
whole wake seemed to have centered 
there. Ere we reached the assemblage, 
from the loud, angry, voices, both male 
and female, and the busy motion of the 
multitude, we readily conjectured that 
some altercation, scuffle or more regular 
fight was the chief sport then going on.  
it proved indeed a curious scene.

Opposite stood, secured by the strong 
grasp of some lusty fellows, a personage 
of no less consequence than a Prince of the

from a wound in his thigh, fronted his 
Royal Highness. This fellow, in the 
coarsest, vulgar language, and at times 
pushing an enormous blacksmith's fist 
close to his defenceless face, vociferated 
threats of immediate retaliation. His 
wrath was kept from subsiding by the 
more shrill and voluble denunciations of 
a red- cloaked elderly woman, his mother. 
She poured on the hapless Prince such 
torrents of abusive epithets, as brought

fair cause she of the affray,) and assisted by 
other maidens, was endeavouring by dint of 
bandages to staunch the further effusion of

eye of the Prince, and his heart was not 
proof against her charms. The fair 
rustic, happening to step aside in order to 
recornpose her dress, somewhat disorgan- 
ized by the excitation of the dance, her 
new Lover seized the moment he thought 
favourable for his purpose, caught her in 
his arms, and with all the impetuosity of 
a Prince, unused to denials, imprinted on 
her lips and neck the most fervent kisses. 
She screamed out, alarmed by the violence 
and more perhaps by the foreign appear- 
ance of the Assailant, and struggled hard, 
but in vain, to get free. Her Brother, 
who happened to be within ear-shot, be- 
held her distress, and hastened to her 
rescue, which he effected by violently push- 
ing* the stranger away, and concluded the 
operation with a heavy blow.

The stain from this insult, the Duke,

with his coadjutor to have the affair 
hushed up on the spot. 
" In this emergency, I caught the eye 
of the king ; and stepping up, entreated 
him, in French, to withdraw with me 
from the throng, and I would endeavour 
the liberation of his Royal Highness. He 
complied, attended also by the Baronet, 
to whom I had shortly imparted the only 
means I thought likely to effect the pur-

words with his Majesty, I left him and 
stood in the way of the crowd, who, drag-

agreed with some hesitation to the propo- 
sal, and they departed. 
** Whilst this was going on, I returned 
to the mob, and informed them in a con- 
ciliatory tone, that I was commissioned to 
offer pecuniary compensation for the 
offence committed.  My speech was 
here cut short by loud cries of dissent. 
Two causes may be ascribed for the 
present failure of this almost infallible 
nostrum. They might not be aware of 
the amount of the sum that would be 
tendered,  and the liberal potations they 
had swallowed might, for the time being, 
lift them above the paltry consideration 
of base lucre. The enraged mother, 
moreover, facing me, her arms akimbo,

it has been committed, (fiercely lifting up 
the sword I held.)  You, my friends, hold 
the culprit fast, whilst I speak to him in

This strange address excited both 
their curiosity and surprise, whilst they 
stood staring in stupid indecision, I front-

ning gesticulations, in order to deceive the 
hearers, explained to him my plan for his 
liberation, and the part he was to act in 
co-operation. When I found that he 
understood me, T, with a thoughtful and 
disappointed air, turned to the ringleaders. 
* My good friends, I now perceive that 
from the law we shall with difficulty ob- 
tain the redress we require, because it 
appears that this foreigner received the 
first blow.  With me the shortest way is 
always the best. He is proud of his skill 
in the sword, I have challenged him to fight 
me with that weapon : he accepts the 
challenge. Now you have only to form a 
circle round us to prevent escape : let him 
come on ; I will soon prove that an English- 
man is a match for any Frenchman, even 
at his own weapon.  My honest fellow, 
said I, turning to the wounded man, allow

me to present yon with these few pound 
notes. The chances of battle are uncer- 
tain, therefore accept this as some indemni- 
fication. Then, doffing my upper gar- 
ments and drawing the sharp pointed blade, 
I cried out : let him face me, if he dare.  
A clear stage and fair play. 
His guards now convinced by the ad- 
ministration of cash, to which they easily 
became reconciled, that no deceit was in- 
tended, njiturally curious to behold so 
novel an exhibition as a fight with swords, 
of which they had heard much but never 
beheld a specimen, released my opponent 
from his confinement, who with a fierce 
aspect and determined step advanced, and 
having likewise stripped, also mit flam"

ing seconds, measuring swords and other

muramer}^ was performed, in order to gain 
time. At length with deadly intent our 
weapons crossed, just as we heard the 
welcome sound of the carriage wheels, 
rolling towards us. 
Now began the hacking of steel,  the 
advance,  the retreat,  the oh's and the 
ah's,  it was tierce and quart, thrust and 
parry, as fiercely dealt and with as san- 
guinary a result, as though it had been a 
theatrical display ; whilst the spectators in 
pleasing terror expected nothing less than 
to behold, at each moment, the bloody 
points of our swords appearing ^ through 
each other's sides. 
In the midst of our passes and feints, 
the carriage drew up, and out pops Sir 
Harry Offham ;  but in such a garb, as I 
had some difficulty to recognise him.  
Instead of his own he wore, with the coach-

mail's bob wig, his enormous gold laced 
cocked hat, and on his lengthy face had 
traced, with burnt cork, a pair of broad 
whiskers of the most terrible sable hue. 
Thus disfigured, he, with a couple of at- 
tendants, forced his way into the ring*, and 
provided with the footman's cane, beat 
down our deadful weapons, crying out in 
a loud; deep, commanding voice. 
** In the King's name, I order you to 
desist  you are both my prisoners.  No 
resistance.  Quick, Fellows, seize them.  
Come  force them into the Carriage. 
Clear the way there.  Postilion drive on.'^ 
In this very expeditious and summary 
manner, as if by leger-demain trick, were 
we smurjghd away before the mob, recover- 
ed from their surprise, had any thoughts of 
resistance. They, however, soon roused 
themselves to action, and posted after us

and we also showed off to some purpose. 
We were thus pursued to a considerable dis- 
tance ; even some of the fleetest overtook 
the vehicle ; but they were too few in 
number to afford* any effectual obstruction, 
Indeed, the bare production of that wea- 
pon, whose point had to their knowledge, 
done such tremendous execution, was suffi- 
cient to keep them at bay. At length they 
desisted, returned to the main body, and 
we were suffered to proceed without fur- 
ther molestation. I and the Duke laughed 
immoderately at the result of this adven- 
ture ; whilst the grotesque figure of the 
droll Baronet, who preserved an inflexible 
grim gravity, did by no means tend to 
allay our merriment.

Within a short distance from Warwick, 
we overtook the Conite de Lille, mourn- 
fnlly jogging on at a slow pace. His joy at 
meeting us ail safe from this escapade was 
excessive. The success of the stralageni 
and the manner in which it was effected, 
kept him in high glee the whole of tlie 
evening. He vehemently declared, that 
it was the most ingenious device ever at- 
tempted.  The next morning', as we took

ful concatenation of events. To the suc- 
cessful issue of this ridiculous pantomime, 
performed in a remote English village, 
you were indebted, in Paris, for your bro- 
thers life, who in consequence was ena- 
bled to save my own from the waves of the 
Mediteranean ; and thus you here enjoy the 
supreme fehcity of having the Pantommiist 
for a husband." 
This gay remark, intended to create a 
smile, made her shudder. It recalled to 
her mind the dreadful situation in which 
the family had been placed, without 
liardly any hopes of a fortunate issue: 
and the peril even more imminent that 
assailed the man, who, through an almost 
miraculous preservation, was become the 
partner of her heart and fortunes. 
I forgot to add, resumed the Narrator,

Thus challenged, Mr, Domville's present

CHAPTER XVI. 
MATRIMONIAL CONVERSION 
T HE Baronet's extravagant expenditure 
reduced him at last to this pass  either to 
submit to the silken thraldom of matrimony, 
or to the mural restraint of the Kin^s 
Bench. The fair Jailor, into whose cus- 
tody he must, in the first case, surrender 
his person, was not much calculated to ex- 
pedite his resolve in her favour, his broken

fortunes clenying" l.im the means of selec- 
tion. Indeed such is the Lady's masculine 
appearance that, were she clothed in cos- 
tume appropriate and holding" the key of 
office, she might well pass for a stout 
Janitor of the aforesaid fortress. Her height 
nearly reaches six feet, with brawny limbs 
proportionate to her size ; moreover, the 
shorter dimensions of one leg* adds by its 
waddling a peculiar gracefulness to her 
carriage. Dissimilar also are her optics : 
One eye views objects in a strait di- 
rection, whilst the other takes them in so 
obliquely as to denote, at the first glance, 
its squinting aptitude. Her pretensions 
to manhood are also established by the 
coarse, large features of her face, and are 
fuither corroborated by the growth of a 
manly beard, which, like her hair, is not of 
the most silky flexibility.*'

Here the Ladies, whose merriment had 
been excited by this portraiture, now 
exclaimed their disbelief; but the Narrator 
having re-asserted the fact, proceeded. 
* The mind and manners of this delect- 
able creature are in harmony with her phy- 
sical qualifications. She moreover enjoys 
the beatitude of ranking herself amongst the 
^ery elect, or as they call themselves, the 
select, from out of the elect of those religi- 
ous sectarians, who hold tenets, they, ex- 
clusively to any other, call Kvangelical / 
which tenets she carries even to puritanism, 
a name of distinction she is anxious to 
revive.  Only oiie desideratum could, in 
Sir Harry's estimation, counterbalance the 
heavy drawbacks in this account, and this 
desideratum she possessed. She still re- 
tained, rather increased than impaired, the 
valuable patrimony which had purchased

a former husband, who had left her a 
childless widow. 
The matrimonial negociation entered 
into, between the two high contracting 
parties, proved disgraceful to both. Sir 
Harry and his legal adviser stipulated for 
the disposal of the lady's property, in ex- 
change for the transfer of his affections,  
and the participation in his title. The 
Lady and her legal adviser insisted that 
the monies Tequisite for the release of the 
gentleman from his creditors, was an ade- 
quate price for the purchase of both his 
affection and title. Thus matters stood 
vibrating off and on for a considerable 
time. But, as the Widow could afford to 
wait and the Bachelor could not, he was at 
length compelled to surrenHer on^ her own 
terms. Yet it must be ackhowledofed that 
he made a most gallant resistance, holding

out to the very last ; lie being then, as to 
personal independance, at his last gasp: 
for his signature of the marriage contract 
could, with truth, have been dated frona a 
spunying house. 
The all subduing Bride, whose Chris- 
tian humility did not prevent her vanity 
from being tickled with the appellation 
of my Lady and your Ladyshij), ha ing 
made the Baronet her conquest, was in- 
tent on shewing the world that he was 
actually such ; and our Benedict found, to 
his bale, that she wore a beard to some 
purpose. 
The first and indeed only struggle for 
mastery was, who should hold the purse. 
Long, and loud, a d many, were the con- 
tentions; but victory constantly perched 
on the lady's coif. That possession she 
previously held, she could not be induced,
## p. 255 (#263) ############################################
MAZES OF I^IFE. 255 
on any terms, to relinquish. The Baronet, 
baffled, at length gave up the cause in de- 
spair, sunk into submission and was con- 
tent to accept as a favour, the doles of her 
bounty, dealt out with a sparing hand. 
His wonted sports, his freaks and 
pranks were at an end. To her conventi- 
cle and other spiritual meetings was the 
hapless, hen-pecked, husband forced in her 
train. Nature had already given his dark, 
long, sallow visage a cut sufficiently me- 
thodistical ; but its saucy leer and the com- 
ical mobility of its features were now for- 
bidden, and the goggling of his large black 
eyes was suppressed : they now remained 
fixed in seeming ghostly contemplation, 
or were only allowed to wander over the 
perusal of some m}^stical treatise. In lieu 
of drollery, fun and loud prophane laugh- 
ing, he was indulged in the conversation

of the saints, and moreover favoured with 
hearing in private, with the fortunate few, 
the perusal of sundry horaelies, ere he had 
the additional satisfaction of attending 
their public delivery from the pulpit ; and, 
for increase of delectation, he knew that 
some of these homelies were the product 
of his dearllib's excogitations, being inva- 
riably gratified with summons of attend- 
ance in her study, ere the ink that traced 
their characters was completely dry. For, 
she, having much at heart the welfare of 
his soul, would have deemed it a capital 
sin, were she to miss the earliest opportu- 
nity of affording it the benefit of her 
ghostly exhortations; these being natu- 
rally more impressively enforced, while 
the fair inditer was yet warm from the 
composition. To tell the truth, the Lady 
prided herself not a little on her scriptu-

ral acquisitions, and had taken the above 
efficacious methods to establish the solidity 
of her pretensions. 
As to dice, or even cards, the bare 
mention of such mihallowed g-ames would 
raise the very devil in his Lady : and, 
when once thus raised, he was not so 
easily laid. 
To all such penances the Baronet was 
in the main, fain to submit. If he dared to 
rebel against her authority, his weekly 
allowance was either reduced or wholly es- 
cheated, according to the nature or perti- 
nacity of his disobedience. For minor 
offences, his love of good living was mor- 
tified with cold short commons, and every 
ease and comfort abridged or wholly ban- 
ished, by means of those petty but nume- 
rous plagues, a wife has always in her 
power to inflict.

Strang'e to tell ! yet all such arbitrary 
vexations still operated in favour of the 
Lady's supremacy. But from what follows, 
I cannot but suspect that the Baronet is 
playing" a game of his own ; and you know, 
Domville, that though playful, he is de- 
signing. Perhaps his acumen has at length 
enabled him to find out the right key to 
her heart, which alone could turn the lock of 
her bureau. He now appears not only a 
convert to her methodistical tenets, but is 
become a most active agent in their propa* 
gation, as thus 
The Lady, elate with the success of her 
former theological rhapsodies, has taken 
a bolder flight. Very many literal passages 
from out of the Scriptures, she contends, 
have been lame ntably perverted from their 
spiritual sense : the true meaning of which 
it has been her peculiar felicity to elicit.

This conceit has flattered her ambition 
with the hopes of becoming the head of a 
new sect. The first convert our Saintess 
made to this further refinement of mysti- 
cism is her husband ; and the worthy couple 
have in consequence entered into a fresh 
partnership : he has enrolled himself 
amongst the preachers of her coventiclei 
Thus qualified, the dogmas furnished by 
Lady Offham, are thundered forth from

Here Domville, sei^ied with a loud fit of 
laughter, cried out." 
** What ! Sir Harry turned Methodist, 
and Preacher to boot! Incredible Meta- 
morphosis !  Well  of all the many farces 
the Baronet has acted, his exhibition in 
the pulpit must surely be the most farci- 
cal.  But, how has all his foolery ended ?"

*'' Oh, most gloriously ! The fame ac- 
quired by our new Preacher's eloquence 
has awakened both the religious scruples 
and the mundane jealousy of his brethren. 
Against such innovation the quondam In- 
novators made a resolute stand ; and his 
passage to the pulpit became barred by an 
impenetrable phalanx of their bodies. A 
schism the consequence. This puny sect, 
the offspring of a larger aggregation, from 
which it had succeeded, underwent a fur- 
ther reduction by the withdrawing of Sir 
Harry, his Lady and a few adherents. 
These, far from being depressed by the 
paucity of their number, had much occa- 
sion to rejoice ; from the consideration that 
the fewer the real elect, the larger must 
be the portion of each, in the kingdom to 
come. Moreover, her Ladyship, to indulge 
her own propensity and to spite her stubborn

opponents, has g^iven orders for the erection 
of a new chapel, to be bnilt at her own ex, 
pense, under Sir Harry's superintendance ; 
wherein she naturally expects to have all 
her own way. In the mean time, absorbed 
in her theological reveries and confiding in 
her husband's well tried adherence, she has 
much relaxed her watchfulness over mun- 
dane affairs, a much larger share of which 
now devolves on his own management. In 
consequence, I expect to hear, in a short 
time, that the sceptre of power has chang- 
ed hands; the Lady being, at length, com- 
pelled to acknowledge the cogency of the 
salique Law. When, probably, she will 
have the mortification to find her long 
hoarded wealth squandered for prophane 
purposes  her chapel transformed into a

Of your Friend, Piercefield, I can also 
afford some information ; although the 
purport is by no means favourable.  Of 
late years, many heavy losses have attended 
his g'ambling' concerns; indeed, fortune 
has proved a very jilt to her former favo- 
rite. The Castle in Shropshire is gone to 
the hammer, with a few smaller estates ; 
and his Lordship is now reduced to boast 
that, in spite of his creditors, he is yet 
enabled to retain his Stud from their 
rapacity. But, as amongst his numerous 
devices to keep off such gentry, ceconomy 
has not been resorted to, I greatly fear that 
the live stock must soon share the same 
fate with the land that fed them. Ah
