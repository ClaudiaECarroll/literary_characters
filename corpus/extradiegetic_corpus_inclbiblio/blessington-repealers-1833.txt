THE REPEALERS. 
CHAPTER I. 
Hail land whose verdure with the emerald vies, 
Whose sons are manly, generous  all  but wise ; 
Where hearts are warm, but heads, alas ! are hot, 
And prudence, goodly prudence, worshipp'd not. 
Gem of the West, set in a stormy sea. 
As if e'en Nature meant thee to be free; 
The waves like barriers guarding thy green shore, 
Or ready still to bear thee commerce o'er. 
Say why has Nature smiled on thee in vain, 
When still thy reckless sons her gifts profane. 
^ And give to licence what is Freedom's due, 
i^ Freedom, that hapless Erin never knew, 
y^ And ne'er can know, till reason points the way, 
v And passion yields to her benignant sway.

who, staggering into the kitchen where she was 
seated by the fire, became almost sobered by 
the look of plaintive suffering with which she 
regarded him. 
" Arrah ! be aisy, Grace, and don't be angry 
with me ; sure it 's only a little dhrop too much 
I Ve taken, and the air has got the bhetter of 
me  faith and troth that 's all ; and it shan't 
happen again, if it vexes you, my Colleen 
dhas, for sure I 'd never let the dhrop into my 
mouth again, rather than see you, with your 
pale face and watery eyes, rocking yourself 
on the boss,* and looking as if you had small 
hopes of my mending. If you scoulded me, or 
were sulky with me, I would not mind it so 
much ; but when I do wrong, you have a way 
of looking at me, Grace, that breaks the heart 
of me, though somehow or other, and more's 
the pity, I forget it when I meet them boys,

and when they coaxes me to go into the Cat 
and Bagpipes." 
" Och ! Jim, and is this the way you keep 
the Bible oath you took to Father Cahill last 
Easther Sunday, that you would not dhrink 
a dhrop in any shebean-house for a year and a 
day ? Think of your precious soul, Jim, and 
think of the dismal thoughts that comes into 
my head, when I am here all alone by myself, 
and see your chair empty right forenent me 
at th*'other side of the fire." 
" Faith and soul, Grace, you make me quite 
unaisy; but one thing I have to say  I did not 
dhrink a dhrop in the shebean-house, for I 
put my head clean out of the window while I 
was dhrinking, so my oath is safe ; and if it 
come to the worst, I would not go to purgatory 
for the oath neither, for I only kissed my 
thumb when Father Cahill give me the Bible, 
so you see all is safe, my Colleen."

" Jim dear, will you never barken to raison?" 
replied poor Grace ; *' and do you know that 
what you 're now telling me of kissing your 
thumb, is the worst of all, for it plainly shows 
me you were deceaving the priest, and me too, 
when you took the oath ; for sure it is not 
the kissing the book, or the thumb, that makes 
the difference, but the intention. And isn't 
it a sin and a wickedness to go to tie oneself 
up with a thought of slipping out of the oath 
all the while? And sure the putting your 
head out of the window at the shebean-house 
to dhrink, is just the same wicked deceaving of 
God and man ; and it 's such false ways, that 
breaks the heart of me, and dhrives away all 
the confidence that I wish to keep about be- 
lieving you. Thruth is thruth, Jim dear, and 
there is no pace without it ; and I would rather 
you took the dhrop for months, though God 
knows the thought of it falls like burning

lead on my heart, than that you took such 
mane ways to falsify your oath. How is it, 
Jim dear, that I, who love you betthv:r than 
ever I loved myself, and you, who say you 
love me  that we, who have but one heart, 
can have two minds ? / scorn a lie to God or 
man, and you think you 're chating the devil 
when you Ve kissing thumbs, and dhrinking out 
of the window at the shebean-house." 
" Well, na bochlish, Grace, what 's done 
can't be undone ; but you '11 see I '11 be a good 
boy, and this time I '11 kiss no thumbs, but on 
my bended knees promise, before God and 
you, Grace, that a dhrop of spirits, good or 
bad, shan't enter my lips for a year and a day ; 
and who knows but once I 'm used to doing 
without the creathure, I can lave it off al- 
together ?" 
Jim kept to his resolution so well, that Grace 
now began to think that all her troubles were

over, and that her husband had become the 
same sober, industrious man that he had been 
while courting her. Everything seemed to 
prosper around them : their cow was the sleek- 
est, their pig the fattest, their little patch of 
garden-ground the best kept, and their cottage 
the cleanest, in the whole village of Collogan, 
one of the most romantic spots in the county of 
Waterford. With pride did Grace rub the 
windows bright, and place in them a few plants 
given her by the gardener of Springmount ; 
and when Jim returned from his work in the 
evening, he found a cheerful turf-fire, a tidily 
swept hearth, an ample wicker-basket of laugh- 
ing potatoes, with wooden piggins, emulating 
in whiteness the milk with which they were 
filled, and a plate of butter, or kirkime,* 
* Kirkime, eggs boiled hard, and chopped, and then 
mix^d with fresh butter, a favourite luxury among the pea- 
santry in the south of Ireland.

awaiting him, with the smiling welcome of his 
now happy wife, who smoothed her shining 
hair, and arranged her neat mob-cap, that her 
best looks might greet his arrival. 
Things were in this happy state, when Jim 
was summoned to attend the election at Dun- 
garvan, and Grace saw him depart with a heavy 
heart. He repeatedly promised her that he 
would not " dhrink a dhrop of anything 
sthronger than the Blackwather cyder, and 
little of that same, and that he would vote as 
the masther tould him."" 
After a week's absence, during which her 
mind was filled with forebodings, Grace saw her 
husband return, and was cheered by the assur- 
ance he gave her, that he had rigidly kept his 
promise. 
" As for the dhrink, cuishlamachree, the 
devil a bit did I mind the not taking it, for 
the fancy for it is gone clean out of my head ;

but for the vote, och my Colleen, it went hard 
against my heart and conschience to give it to 
the Sassenach, when I saw the real old Milesian 
Repalers in want of it ; but I thought of my 
promise to you and the masther, and I voted 
for the Englisher. It 's myself that ""s quite 
entirely bothered, now that I see and hear how 
bad things are going on. Sure one knows 
nothing at all at all here of what 's happening, 
and how the English has kilt this counthry by 
taking away the Parliament, and all the good 
ould Irish laws that was made for us, and 
giving us English laws that 's only fit for them- 
selves. Faith, they might as well take away 
the praties from us, and give us bread in place 
of 'em, which, to my thinking, would be a bad 
swop any way. Here was I, working, and 
eating, and dhrinking, and sleeping, as if no- 
thing at all was the mather, while the poor 
counthry is intirely ruint, and I 'd never know

a word about it, only that the Repalers let the 
cat out of the bag. Och ! Grace asthore, it's 
a cruil thing to be living in pace, and never 
knowing so much as a word of the throubles 
that 's going on in the world." 
" Well, Jim, that bates every thing I ever 
heard; why I think it's a blessing to be in 
pace, especially as it 's no use to be throubling 
ourselves about what we can't help ; and if 
there's so much throuble in the world, we 
ought to thank God we have escaped it." 
" Faith and troth, so I said to myself at 
first," said Jim; "but the Repalers showed me 
the difference, and now I feel quite bothered 
any how, and won't be contint till we 've got 
our parliament back, and got all the Sasse- 
nachs out of the counthry. Sure that 'ill be a 
great day for the Irish! " 
" Whisth ! Jim, honey, what quare notions 
you 've got in your head ; sure it 's almost as

bad as the dhrink. It makes me quite unaisy 
to see you bothering your poor brains after 
such a fashion. If the counthry is in throuble, 
sure the great gentlemen that took the parlia- 
ment over the water to teach it English, knows 
better what to do for it than a set of poor 
spalpeens, who only do what the Repalers tell 
'em, and don^t understand what made the vex- 
ation, nor what will cure it, any more than you 
or me." 
" Och ! fie upon you, Grace ; is that the 
way you M give up liberty ? Sure, the Repalers 
said as how life is only a curse without liberty, 
and here we have been ever since we were 
born, ay, faith, and a long time before, in all 
this throuble, just bekase we have no liberty. 
Liberty, Grace a-vourneen, is just like what 
we imagine of the grand ould times in Ireland ; 
it 's something ihkt we don't quite rightly un- 
derstand^ but which, we believe, must be all

the finer for that. Faith I '11 try to turn it 
over in my mind, and once I can make it out, 
I '11 tell you all I can about it, for I think you 
have more gumption in such matters than I 
have, bekase you never get in a passion about

"Well, Jim dear,"" asked Grace, " have you 
yet rightly made out what was perplexing you 
last night ? I Ve been thinking about it, and 
it seems to me that we have been as happy and 
continted as ever two creatures was, and hasn't 
our people, and all our relations been the same

THE REPEALERS. 13 
before us ? and now you want to persuade me 
that we haven't been happy together! Jim, Jim, 
I fear you're a hard-hearted ungrateful man, 
and no good can come of it, to forget all the 
blessings we have had from Providence, and the 
paceful happy days we have spent together." 
" Grace a-vourneen, it is not that at all I 
mane. I know God is good, and I don't forget 
that we have had some happy days ; but if we 
had liberty it would be quite a different thing, 
and that's what I want." 
" And what 's liberty, Jim dear, for I can't 
rightly make out what you mane ?" 
" Why, liberty, cuishlamachree, manes to 
do everything we like ourselves, and hinder 
every one else from doing it. It also manes to 
prevent every mother's soul in Ireland from 
going to church, and making them go to mass, 
whether they like it or no. Wouldn't this be 
a great day for the Irish, Grace ? And all this

will happen, if we only vote for Repalers, pay 
no tithes, and always keep repating that the 
English are the cause of all our throubles. I 
wish you had heard all that the Repalers said, 
for I'm sure 'twould have quite convinced 
you, as it did me, and all the others who kept 
bawling and screeching out all the time, they 
were so delighted to hear that we were all 
ruint quite entirely clear and clean, and had 
only now found friends to tell us so ; but when 
I thry to think of all they said, I can't make 
out the half of it, and don't feel at all as I did 
when all the gorsoons were shouting and bawl- 
ing round 'em. But one thing I 'm determined 
on, the divil a tithe I '11 ever pay ; not that I 
begrudge the durty thrifle to Parson Disnay, 
but just out of charity, to keep them poor he- 
reticks from being lost entirely, for if the par- 
sons don't get any tithe, sure they must turn 
from being Protestants and come back to the

THE REPEALERS. 15 
thriie faith, the ould religion, which will save 
their poor sinful souls ; and Parson Disnay and 
his coadjutor Parson Wells are too good men 
not to be turned to the right road. In like 
manner the masther will be saved, for if we 
pay him no rint, and I 'm sure 'twill come to 
this point in time, faith he ''11 be obliged to turn 
Catholic, or else leave the counthry, and that '11 
be the making of him."*' 
" Och ! Jim, who on earth has been putting 
all this nonsense into your head.? Sure it's a 
sin and wickedness for them that turns many 
a good heart, and an honest mind, from the 
straight high road of truth to the crooked by- 
roads of falsehood and cunning ! Isn't it enough 
for poor ignorant people like us to do our duty, 
and follow our own religion, without throubling 
ourselves about the religion of others ? And sure 
that religion can't be bad that makes the good 
masther, and Parson Disnay and his coadjutor,

do US all the good in their power, without ever 
so much as axing if we go to church or to mass." 
" Indeed and troth Grace that 's thrue, for 
you, ma vourneen ; but still if all them heretics 
as goes to church cannot be saved like us after 
they die, oughtn't we to thry to turn 'em ? and 
as the Roman religion is the ould ancient and 
real religion, we must make it the only one. 
Och ! Grace honey, it would do your heart 
good to hear the fine discourse I hard from 
Tim Fogarty, the schoolmaster at Abbey side, 
whin he was converting Dick Nowlan. Dick, 
like a poor ignorant creathure as he is, said that 
the Protestant religion was the best, for says 
he, ' IsnH it the reformed religion, and a'n^t ye 
all crying out for reform from morning till 
night, and here's a reformed religion ready 
made to your hand ?'  ' Why then bad luck to 
you, ye spalpeen,' says Tim, ' sure the Roman 
is the only old thrue faith ; didn't you see or

hear of Paul's Epistle (which manes a letther) 
to the Romans ?"*  ' Yis, I did, sure enough/ 
says Dick.  'Well, then," says Tim, 'did 
ye ever see or hear of Paul, or any other 
of the Saints, writing a letther to the Protes- 
tants? Now, Dick, what have you got to 
say ?"*  Faitli, Grace honey, that foolish fellow, 
Dick Nowlan, was dumb founded, and could 
not say bo to a goose; and who, afther that, 
could doubt the Roman Catholic religion 
being the only thrue one ; and who could 
help wishing to convart the good masther and 
Parson Disnay, and the rest of the good people, 
to it ?" 
" Well, Jim, sure, allowing that ours is the 
oldest religion, that does not make it the best. 
I don't know enough of book-learning to be 
able to chop Latin with Tim Fogarty, to prove 
whether the Saints ever wrote to the Protes- 
tants, as they did to the Romans ; but faith, I

know well enough that many things are none 
the better for being ould. Look at the ould 
castle on the hill, with its little narrow peep- 
holes for windows, its dark passages, and in- 
convenient rooms, and tell me, if it is to be 
compared with the fine elegant house at Spring- 
mount, where the broad, clear, bright windows, 
let in the light of heaven  the halls and lobbies 
so genteel, and the rooms so beautiful, that I 
never could be tired of looking at them. To 
be sure, when the ould castle was built, I'm 
tould that they were forced to make it so sthrong 
bekase the people were always fighting and 
attacking one another, so that they were more 
desirous to keep enemies out than to let the 
fine cheerful daylight in ; and also the poor 
people had no glass for their windows, I'm told, 
in those ould bad times ; sure we ought to be 
thankful that we have the luck to live in betther 
days. Now, Fm thinking, Jim agrah, that the

THE REPEALERS. 19 
ould Roman religion, like the ould castle, was 
only fit for the ould times in which they were 
made, and that the Reformed religion, like 
Springmount-house, is the best for the present 
time : not that I would wish to forsake the 
creed in which I was brought up, but I would 
like to let other people follow their own wishes 
in going whichever road they liked on the same 
journey we must all go. Sure there 's differ- 
ent roa.ds from this to Dungarvan  some thinks 
one road pleasanter, and some thinks another ; 
wouldn't it be mighty foolish to quarrel for 
this ?  and sure isn'^t it twice worse to thry to 
interfere with people for choosing the road they 
like best to Heaven ?"' 
" Be my soul, Grace, there's some raison in 
what you say, but if them that knows the 
rights of the question say that no soul can be 
saved that passes through any other gate but 
the Catholic, wouldn't it be a pity to lave 'em 
in the wrong path ?"

** Jim, to my mind it is betther to thry and 
keep what we believe to be the right path our- 
selves, and lave the rest to God. He best 
knows, and we never can be wrong if we be- 
lieve He will show His mercy to those who 
may have made a mistake in their journey to 
Him;' 
" Faith, Grace, you have a way of coming 
over me, that knocks clean out of my head all 
the fine speechafying I have been listening to. 
When I heard the Repalers, I thought there 
was not a word to be said against 'em ; but now 
I hear you, I forget what it was they said that 
made the heart jump in my breast, and the 
angry thoughts come into my head. When I 
heard 'em, I felt as if a thrumpet was sounding 
in my ears, and that I could kill hundreds for 
the parliament and the ould religion; and when 
they dhrove us all mad with the burning words 
they spoke, and then thried to throw could

water on us, be telling us to be quiet, to dis- 
perse, and go home decently, be my soul I 
thought it was like lighting a great fire, and 
covering it over with ever so much wet slack, 
and telling it not to burn up, when you know, 
Grace, it would be sure to blaze out soon after, 
and difficult would it be for the same hands 
that lighted it to quench it. Now when you 
talk to me, asthore, with your own quiet, down- 
right earnest words, it seems to me as if I was 
listening to the fife made out of a reed that 
Thedy Mulvany used to play upon when he was 
tending the masther's sheep on the hills : and 
that same fife used to often make a fool of me, 
bekase somehow or other, when it came on me 
from the distance, it was so soft and pleasant, 
that it made me look around me on the beauti- 
ful heavens, the quiet river, stealing along like 
time, making small noise, but still always going 
away from us; the green trees, lookino- so

proud, and yet returning the salutes of the 
wind by gentle bows, just as the masther and 
the family do of a Sunday to the poor people. 
The bleating of the sheep, and the moans of the 
cows, all seemed to me more pleasant, though 
the tears came into my eyes, I couldn't tell 
for what; and you were in my mind all the 
while; and now, when I hear your own sweet 
voice raisoning with me, the fife and all them 
things comes back to me, and I feel as if I 
couldn't kill a fly, but would save all the world 
if I could." 
A mutual embrace followed Jim's confession, 
and before they retired to their rustic couch, 
he had promised Grace to leave politics to the 
Repalers, and to be happy as heretofore.

Notwithstanding Jim''s promises to aban- 
don political, and to think only of civil econo- 
my, poor Grace soon found that when he 
attended the markets on Saturdays, he might 
be seen not only with open ears, but with open 
mouth also, devouring the inflated and inflam- 
matory news poured forth to the ignorant 
multitude; and which produced much the same 
effect on their fiery spirits, that their favourite

beverage, whisky, would have done, if thrown 
on a blazing turf fire. It took her hours, nay 
days, to neutralise the poison imbibed in a few 
minutes from the mouthing orators, who al- 
ways address the imaginations of their hearers, 
and never their reason. 
All who know Ireland are aware, that in 
proportion to the exuberance of imagination in 
her sons, is the deficiency of reason and judg- 
ment ; and her wily orators fail not to take 
advantage of this peculiarity. A few spirit- 
stirring words, echoed by shouts, can at any 
time drive this excitable people to madness ; 
and the high courage, which forms one of their 
most marked characteristics, renders them reck- 
less of consequences. This same undaunted 
and undauntable courage, that made the Irish 
regiments proverbial for their valour, winning 
for them the rarely-sought distinction of being 
chosen for forlorn -hope service, becomes the

THE REPEALERS. 25 
instrument of their destruction when mis- 
directed. 
Well do I remember a discharged soldier of 
the SSth, who had been as remarkable for 
bravery and discipline in his regiment, as he 
had unfortunately become for habits of in- 
toxication and insubordination in his native 
village, answering a person who remonstrated 
with him on this subject, " Och ! Sir, you are 
right ; what a pity it is we should ever have 
peace! If the war lasted, this could not hap- 
pen ; I would have been taking towns, scaling 
fortresses, dreaming of glory at night and win- 
ning it by day. Instead of drinking all night 
and quarrelling all day, as at present, I would 
be fighting for the honour of that same Old 
England, of which we used to be so proud 
that it was our rallying word, and of which we 
are now so jealous that we are crying out to 
be separated from her. Och ! Sir, all this 
VOL. I. C

26 THE REPEALERS. 
comes from the misfortune of having peace, 
and having so much idle time on our hands 
that we don't know what to be at. I often 
think, if I had only the same work, even with 
the pipe-clay, that I used to have to do, it 
would keep the devil out of me ; for when I 
was with my regiment I never thought of any- 
thing but glory and plunder, and cared not a 
pin about all that now bothers my brains from 
morning till night, since the Repealers have 
opened my eyes. Faith, Sir, we poor devils 
always require a commanding officer to keep 
us in order ; and had we but one of our old 
officers in every district, to tell us now and 
then what we ought to think and do, we would 
not fall into the hands of the Repealers, .who 
are the only people, God help us ! who take 
the trouble of directing, or misdirecting us. 
Sir, they drive vis mad, for with a noggin of 
whisky in my stomach, and one of their speeches

THE REPEALERS. !^7 
in my head, I feel like a mad bull goaded on 
by firebrands, and am ready to rush on my 
own destruction, provided it could destroy 
those they are always pointing out to our ven- 
geance. But, when they have maddened us, 
then to hear them telling us to be quiet and 
orderly, sure it 's enough to bother and perplex 
us entirely, and I lose all patience with them. 
Sir, it's a terrible thing to have a sort of a 
heart that is ready to jump up and fight on the 
least occasion, and not to have any natural 
enemies to fight with ; it makes one quarrel 
with one's own friends, and then when the 
anger is gone out of the head, one feels 
foolish and ashamed, because it 's so hard to 
remember what the falling out was about. As 
long as we were at war with the French, every 
thing went well ; they like fighting as well as 
we do, and kept us constantly employed. Sir, 
they were our natural enemies, and when once 
c2

we had a good set-to, we bore no ill-blood ; but, 
Sir, when we quarrel with the English, it''s 
like quarrelling with our own blood-relations, 
and we feel more bitter after every fight, be- 
cause we know we are partly in the wrong, 
and they know the same, and neither, like re- 
lations, will allow it. Another thing, Sir, is, 
that lately the Repealers have been attacking 
and abusing a man I cannot help liking, ay, 
by my soul, and loving too, as if he was my 
brother ; a man. Sir, that is as brave as an 
Irishman, as honourable as an Englishman, 
and as chivalrous as a Frenchman. A man. 
Sir, that I have fought in the same field with, 
and that left as handsome a leg at Waterloo, 
as ever won a lady's heart. I cannot hear 
this noble man run down, knowing his courage 
and his generosity as I do ; and this has opened 
my eyes to the blarney, and blow-coal attacks 
of the Repealers ; and yet, Sir, once I have

THE REPEALERS. 29 
taken a glass too much of that fiery whisky, 
and heard their still more fiery speeches, I lose 
all command over myself, and God knows how 
it will end." 
There was something prophetic in poor 
M'Murogh's last observation ; for he soon after 
met a violent death in a fray with the police, 
into which the excited state of his feelings, 
worked upon by seditious counsels, had hurried 
him : and his death was but one of the many to 
which evil advice and ill-directed courage have 
led in the unfortunate country where it occurred. 
Each market-day produced an increase of 
Jim'*s moodiness : his features seldom relaxed 
into a smile, except when Grace sought to 
excite one by her playful sallies, and then 
the smile passed over his lips like a ripple on 
the surface of the clear and rapid stream in 
front of his cottage, while the depth below was 
unbroken.

Often did Grace say to him, " Och, Jim 
darlint, I fear it''s the want of the dhrop youVe 
been used to lately, that makes you seem so 
down-hearted. Sure it 's myself that ""s sorry I 
made you take the oath against it, for when 
I see you looking so gloomy, and taking no 
pleasure in anything that 's going on, it breaks 
the heart of me." 
'' Then it 's a sorrowful day to me, Grace 
a-vourneen, that I should be bringing throuble 
to your tender heart ; I wish I could forget all 
the vexing thoughts that have got lodged in 
my mind, for I 'm sorely perplexed, and feel 
always as if I was expecting to hear some 
great news or other, and that things can't 
go on as they are. This unsettles and makes 
me feel discouraged for my work. Instead of 
thinking for the year to come, and laying up 
our provision for the winter, I am thinking 
tliat, before that, some great throuble will take

THE REPEALERS. 31 
place, and that it 's no good to lay by for 
the future. Indeed, the Repalers told me 
as much, and therefore I have not the heart 
to work as I used. When I look at the 
beautiful flowers you have taken so much 
pains to rear, I think who will be one day 
pulling 'em, or perhaps thrampling 'em under 
foot ; and that our cabbages, carrots, and 
onions will one day be canted for the tithes, 
as well as the cow and the pig that we have 
taken such care of. Och ! Grace, isn't this 
enough to make a man gloomy ? and can you 
wonder that I am all no how ?'' 
" Why should the cow, or the pig, or the 
vegetables, be canted for the tithes now, Jim, 
when they never were before?'' asked Grace: 
" Haven't we got eight pounds in the bank, 
before us in the world ? and haven't I got thirty 
shillings in the chest ; besides what the house- 
keeper at Springmount owes me for the cream

cheeses, and all the hanks of fine yarn I have 
been spinning ? So you see, Jim dear, we have 
plenty of money to pay the tithes, if they rise 
ever so much. And don''t we know that good 
Parson Disnay never raises ""em unjustly ?" 
" Grace, you don't understand my throuble," 
said Jim ; "it isn't the money I 'm fretting 
about, as I know we have enough to pay all ; 
and even if we hadn't. Parson Disnay, or the 
masther, never would distress us ; but if I pay 
tithes when all the counthry is up and sworn 
not to pay, I '11 be ashamed to show my face 
among the boys : indeed as it is, they laugh and 
sneer at me, and say I have not the courage of 
a man, let alone an Irishman, and that I 'm 
afraid of you, Grace, and this vexes me." 
" Jim honey, what you say goes to my 
heart  sure I thought you had more raison 
than to mind what a set of drunken disorderly 
spalpeens, like them that follows the Repalers,

would say to you ; and when you know you are 
doing what is right, how can you listen to their 
balderdash? Faith, Jim asthore, I thought 
you had more gumption in you; sure it's a 
pity for both our sakes that I was mistaken/'

CHAPTER IV. 
" Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons. 
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste ; 
But, with a little act upon the blood, 
Burn like the mines of sulphur." 
A MAN must have either a better head or 
heart than falls to the lot of most, who can 
pardon the superiority of a wife, however 
meekly she may use it. Poor Jim Cassidy's 
head was like the generality of those of his 
countrymen of that class, not remarkable for 
its reasoning powers ; hence he was on equal 
ground with his companions, while with Grace, 
he felt he never had tlie best of an argument ;

THE REPEALERS. 35 
nay, he usually found hers so unanswerable, 
that he speedily arrived at the conclusion that 
she was terrible cute, which in Irish phraseology 
means clever. From the moment this discovery 
forced itself on his mind, he began to respect her 
more, but to love her less ; a change of senti- 
ment, that no loving heart like hers could be 
satisfied with. It was the facility with which 
Grace refuted the arguments of the Repealers, 
that conveyed the idea of her superiority to 
Jim ; it was less mortifying to think her terrible 
cute, than to acknowledge himself terrible bo- 
therheaded ; it was therefore a relief to him to 
find himself listened to with attention by hiis 
companions, over whom his sobriety gave him 
a considerable advantage. 
This cemented his increased intimacy with 
them, and drew him still more frequently from 
his home. Their enthusiasm, excited by ine- 
briation and the artful recapitulation of real

and imaginary wrongs, worked on the morbid 
feelings of poor Jim, until he believed himself 
the wretched slave they asserted him to be, 
and that it had become his duty to burst the 
chains which enslaved him. 
When he returned from a meeting where sedi- 
tion and whisky had been doing their demora- 
lising work, both freely distributed by the 
emissaries of the agitators, poor Grace has been 
astonished and grieved by his declamation. 
" Millions in chains, a starving and oppressed 
people, Saxon tyrants, no tithes, and repeal of 
the Union," were become familiar v^^ords in the 
mouth of poor Jim ; and blood, and bloody, 
were the terms applied to every demonstration 
of a power, whose mildness and clemency was by 
most people considered blameable, in so long 
permitting its justice to be called in question. 
" Yes, I 'm a slave, a chained slave, you Ve 
a slave, Grace, and we 're all slaves," used Jim

THE REPEALERS. 37 
to say ; " the nigers ar'^n't half so ill-used as we 
are ; obliged to pay the teachers of a religion we 
abominate ; obliged to submit to have our par- 
liament carried into a land of strangers, where 
our lamentations and tears, sent over through 
our reform members, only make the English 
laugh. They laugh at the brogue, instead of 
thrying to find out where the shoe pinches. 
Ar'n't we all starving, and crushed by the 
plough of oppression.? sure it calls for vin- 
gince and blood !" 
" Och ! Jim, your poor head is surely turned. 
How can you say you are a slave, or that them 
boys you go with are slaves, when they are free 
to run wild over the counthry, making mis- 
chief at every side ? How can you say you 're 
starving, when you know you ate a fine piece of 
pork with plenty of greens and potatoes for 
your dinner, and that we have a tub full of salt 
mate, and four flitches of bacon in the house.

with the loft full of potatoes ? Sure, only I'm 
too unhappy to laugh at anything now, I could 
laugh enough to hear you say you're a slave 
and starving; and sure this must be what 
makes the English people, who like the plain 
truth, laugh whenever them repaling members 
tells 'em such rhaumeish* Now hear me, Jim : 
if half what them Repalers tell you, and the 
boys that goes shouting after them, was thrue, 
wouldn't it be decenter, and kinder, not to 
make bad worse, but to give you all good ad- 
vice, and encourage you to be quiet ? And sure, 
if we have throubles to bear in Ireland, and 
every place has its share, vs^ouldn't it be wiser 
for them Repalers that can blow hot and could 
with the same breath, to make you all keep 
quiet, and orderly to your work, and be able to 
tell the Lord Leftenant, or the King himself  
' You see, my Lord, how quiet the poor Irish-

men are in all their throubles, they pay all they 
can, neither burn houses, nor flog, nor murder ; 
and ever since you gave 'em mancipation they 
have been thrying to show how much they feel 
the compliment. Sure, if they behave so well, 
and that there's no complaint against 'em when 
they have cause for complaint, your Lordship 
will take away their throubles, and put in a good 
word for 'em to the King.' What could be 
said against this, Jim ? don't you think it would 
be better than having murders, floggings, burn- 
ings, 'and sociations going on at every side, so 
that if we have throubles in Ireland, and ask 
the help of the Lord Leftenant, or the King, 
sure they can stop our mouths, by saying, 
* Arrah ! be aisy, you ill-behaved spalpeens; sure 
you don't know how to be grateful. Didn't I 
give you mancipation, and ar'n't you twice worse 
ever since ? and now ar'n't you raving mad for 
repale, which is just one as if you said you were

determined to do all the mischief you could ?' 
Sure, Jim honey, for Ireland to thry to do with- 
out England, is just as if you and I thried to 
do without the good masther that supports us. 
No, Jim, I'm afraid there's no honesty in them 
people that works you all up to madness, and 
then tells you to be quiet. I think, God forgive 
me if I 'm wrong, that what they mane is to 
make you all furious, and then, when all your 
madness is known at every side, to be able to 
say to the Lord Leftenant, * Now, my Lord, you 
see what a state they 're in, and it's only me that 
can make 'em be quiet. If I say the word, 
they 'l\ be aisy ; so make me a judge, or a great 
lord, and then I'll keep them mad Irish under 
my thumb for evermore ; but if you don't, faith 
they'll ruin themselves downright to spite you.' " 
*' Well, Grace, haven't we tried every thing 
to get our rights, just as we waited so many 
long years to get mancipation, which the Eng-

lish never gave us, nor never would give us, as 
the Repalers say, if we had not kicked up such 
a row, and frightened 'em into it." 
" No, Jim dear, ye haven't tried every way, 
for ye never tried to deserve a good chracter, 
which, to my poor thinking, would be the 
safest, and the pleasantest way too, to earn good 
treatment ; for sure if even it does not succeed 
in getting justice, it laves the comfort, and a 
great one it is, Jim, of having deserved it. 
What do the Repalers gain for Ireland, Jim 
agrah ? Mistrust and dislike, instead of confi- 
dence and pity ; for sure the warm hearts and 
generous feelings of our poor misguided coun- 
trymen, if they were really known, would be 
valued ; but England hears only of their 
crimes, and, more 's the pity, can hear nothing 
of their virtues. Is it a wonder, then, that the 
English think us savages, when every ship 
takes over to them fresh and frightful stories

of all the cruel and wicked things the boys are 
always doing ? Faith, Jim, I think them that 
calls themselves our friends, are our worst 
enemies. Is it like friends to be always telling 
ye that ye 're slaves, that ye 're trampled on, 
that ye have none of your rights, and that 
ye 're starving, when the most part of ye have 
plenty of wholesome food in your stomachs, 
and more than plenty of the wicked potheen in 
your heads? No, Jim, a thrue friend would 
raison with ye, and say, ' Be aisy and decent, 
boys, and show the English how well ye can 
behave, even when ye have cause to be discon- 
tented.' This will be an honour and a credit 
to Ireland, and England will then be ashamed 
not to do ye justice. But, no; your pretended 
friends maddens ye with burning words, that, 
like the fiery whisky, puts all raison out of 
your heads, and anger and desperation into 
your hearts;  and mind my words, and sor-

rowfully I say them, no good can come of all 
this." 
" Can you deny, Grace, that we got manci- 
pation by making such a row in the counthry, 
that they were afraid to refuse us ?" 
" Faith, Jim, I can't believe it, and I don't 
wish to believe it. I 'd rather think they gave 
it to us because they believed it was all we 
wanted to make us contented ; and so ye were 
all saying from morning till night ; ye did not 
speak a word of Repaling then, and them that 
guides ye said the mancipation would give 
every blessing. But no sooner did ye get it, 
than your bad advisers turned round, and in- 
stead of thanking them that gave it to ye, 
many of them, as I'm tould, acting against 
their judgments in so doing, they only say, ' No 
thanks to ye. We Ve got it by frightening ye, 
and now we Ve found out the way, we '11 ask 
for something fresh every year, till we 've

bothered ye all, and tired ye out, and then we 
will get what we want for ourselves and our 
own relations, and desire the fools we have 
been driving mad so long to be quiet, and do 
as they are bid.** Faith, Jim, the way as the 
Repalers uses ye, reminds me of the puppet- 
show I saw at Dungarvan, when one man 
pulled the wires, and made all the little pup- 
pets jump, act, and fight as he liked. All 
the people looked at the puppets, and were 
surprised what movements they were making ; 
but I minded the showman pulling the wires, 
and think of him every time I see or hear the 
Repalers working ye up to madness, or order- 
ing ye to be aisy, just as it serves their conve- 
nience at the time."

Old Song. 
" Tell me, Grace a-vourneen," said Jim, 
" when you hear the fine songs that describe 
how grand and great Ireland was before she was 
thrampled upon by the English, don't you feel 
your heart rising to your throat, and the tears 
coming into your eyes ? If you, a woman, 
feel this for the poor ould counthry, what must 
men feel ? Och ! the Repalers are right ;

there's something in our hearts that won''t let 
us be contint while we are slaves ; for haven't 
I seen men, able and willing to fight too, cry 
like girls when they first begin to love, at 
hearing one of the ould cronauns of the coun- 
thry sung, with its dismal, but sweet music, 
and its thrue words about our past glory and 
present slavery." 
" Jim, you make me angry to hear you talk 
of slavery. I won't allow you 're a slave, or 
that I am the wife of a slave. You pay your 
rint, we owe no one a tenpenny, we have some- 
thing before us in the bank in case of a rainy 
day, and no one can molest us while we do our 
duty. Sure then this proves we are not slaves, 
though wicked people would thry to persuade 
us into thinking so. No, Jim, the ould songs 
have often brought tears into my eyes, and 
made my heart swell, and, therefore, I don't 
sing 'em any more, as it 's ungrateful to be re-

gretting what we never knew, (and which, after 
all, maybe is not thrue,) when we have so 
much to be thankful for. When I see a lovely 
evening, with the beautiful sun entering his 
rose-coloured palace, and the trees, hills, and 
rivers all looking so grateful for the warmth 
he gave 'em before he wished 'em good night, 
do you think that if any ould song, or discon- 
tented person tould me that long ago the sun 
was finer than now, and that all I think so 
beautiful, was much more so in past time  do 
you think that ought to make me unhappy? 
No, Jim, I ought and would think that the 
beautiful sight before my eyes was quite 
beautiful enough, and thank the good God 
that gave it.'' 
" Well, Grace, you have such a quare way 
of being satisfied with every thing, that it 's no 
use thrying to put you out of conceit with 
things."

" No, Jim dear, you are wrong there, for 
I *m not easily satisfied with anything I can 
make better ; it 's only things that I can't alter 
or mend, that I think it best not to be grum- 
bling about, bekase a discontented spirit grows 
faster on one than people imagine." 
" Faith, it 's thrue enough, for you, Grace 
nla-vourneen, as I know to my cost ; and sorry 
enough I am that ever the Repalers blew the 
bad breath into me which keeps me always 
upon the fret, bemoaning the eligance and 
grandeur of this poor counthry in ould times, 
wiien people came flocking from all parts of 
the world to lam knowledge in Ireland. Then 
we had kings and queens too, as witness Gra-

and slaves : sure the notion of it is enough to 
break one''s heart !"

about "em, if ever I see one yet in all the

" What would you say, Grace, if you were

whether they are in want ; and the masther,

whose word is like a bond ! Och, Jim ! if ye

hopes that ever ye '11 see the straight road."

the likes of me, that called the gentlemen 
tyrants ; it was the Repalers as said as how 
our landlords dhrove us like galley-slaves be-

they bid us, and that this showed they were 
tyrants ; so faith I could say nothing against it." 
" Now listen to me, Jim, and I '11 tell you 
what you could have said. You might tell 
'em the landlords were estated gentlemen, 
that had laming and knowledge, and that 
their great properties in the counthry gave 
them a much greater stake in it than a poor 
man could have, therefore they must, even if 
it was only for their own interest, wish to do 
what was best for the good of all. Their 
larning gives them the power of knowing what 
is best to be done ; so in choosing a Member, 
they like to recommend one to their poor igno- 
rant tenants who is most likely to do good to

the counthry, and keep it peaceable. And ar'n't 
they right, Jim ? And for this, the poor de- 
luded creathures that's misled by bad advisers 
would call 'em tyrants." 
*' Och ! but Grace, they do other things 
that 's worse : don't they let their lands to who- 
ever will give 'em the highest rent, over the 
heads of the ould tenants, whose fathers, and 
fathers' fathers have been on the soil ? And 
don't they encourage English settlers to come 
over and fix themselves over our heads ?" 
" Tell me, Jim dear, if you had a pig to 
sell at the market, wouldn't you sell it to the 
one that offered the highest price, and wouldn't 
you have a right to do so ? And if one of the 
neighbours was to throw in your teeth, that 
you preferred selling your pig to a stranger 
who gave you a larger price, than to a neigh- 
bour who gave you only half, but who had 
bought his pigs of you for years, when maybe

they were much cheaper, or that you dicln''t 
want the money so much, wouldn't you think 
he was a foolish man, and an unreasonable 
one ? To be sure you would ; and yet ye blame 
the landlords, and call them tyrants, for getting 
the best price they can for their land, which 
is as much theirs as the pig is yours. And 
as for encouraging strangers to come and fix 
among us, sure it's a real blessing. The rich 
English farmer, who takes the land held before 
by perhaps twenty poor men, employs the 
twenty as labourers, with good and regular 
pay ; he advises 'em, gives 'em what 's better 
than all advice, a good example ; teaches 'em 
to keep their word and engagements, encourages 
schools, and helps the poor families in all 
difficulties, and shows us the comfort and de- 
cency of cleanliness and good order. He puts 
the land into fine condition, instead of letting 
it go to rack and ruin, and, while paying a

fair rent, makes an honest profit. Often and 
often do I think, that never would I know 
what I do, little as it is, if it was not for the 
pattern set me in Farmer Thomas''s house ; and 
sure one such family as that does more good 
than twenty buckeen farmers, like them of 
our own country, who are neither gentlemen 
nor farmers, though they pretend to be both." 
" I can't but allow, Grace, that Mr. Thomas 
and his family have done good, but that 's no 
raison to encourage so many other English to 
come over our heads; and though you find 
words to excuse every one, what can you say 
for us Catholics to be paying the clergy for the 
Protestants ? Sure it ""s a sin and a shame. No, 
Grace, the tithes is against all raison, and you 
can't defend 'em."" 
" Faith, Jim, I'm a poor hand at defending, 
but still I think, when you consider that all we 
pay in tithes is spint among us, and comes

back to us in twenty ways, it *s money laid out 
at good interest, and it's better than the saving 
bank. Look at the employment the clergy 
gives us, besides plants for our little gardens, 
medicine if we are sick, a word of comfort if we 
are sad, and constant encouragement and kind 
offices if we deserve it ;  sure, Jim, all we give 
'em comes back to us, one way or another." 
" Faith, it''s yourself, Grace, that bothers me 
by contradicting all the things the Repalers 
tells me ; sure you can't like me as ye used to 
do, that you 're always showing me I 'm in the 
wrong. It isn't kind of you, Grace, nor what 
I expected." 
'' Och ! Jim, would it be kind to let you keep 
false and bad thoughts in your poor head, and 
see 'em pushing you into wicked actions, that 
may cause the misery and disgrace of us both, 
instead of raisoning with you. It's I, Jim, that 
has cause to be sorrowful, and to think you

don^t like me as you used to do ; for you 're 
quite changed, always discontented, and picking 
flaws in them you once used to like in your 
heart. They are not changed, nor am I, but you 
cuishlamachree, (for you '11 always be that, in 
spite of everything,) you are changed. You 
call them tyrants that is your truest friends ; 
yourself, a slave, that has your liberty as all can 
see, and are bemoaning and bewailing for 
things that never came into your mind till 
them wicked Repalers put 'em there." 
" Maybe, Grace, you 'd next be after telling 
me that the absentees, as they call 'em, have a 
right to spend all their money in England that 
is earned by our hard labours." 
'* Why, tell me, Jim, if you liked to spend 
the little savings we have in the bank, in Youg- 
hal, instead of Dungarvan, who 'd have a right 
to blame you .^ But do you consider also, that

foreign parts, and are used to live in England, 
with everything elegant and comfortable about 
and around 'em, it is hard to live in poor Ire- 
land, where everything is at sixes and sevens, 
with constant throubles and disturbances, and 
where no one is sure of life a single day. Isn't 
it hard to drive the grand lords and ladies away 
by your bad behaviour, and then to blame 'em for 
going ? Who, that can help themselves, would 
stay in a throubled country, where one man 
can set the whole of the people in a brain fever 
whenever he likes; and sure those that stay 
are but poorly thanked, as witness the dear 
good masther, and the other gentlemen. When 
I see you, my dear Jim, that has a good honest 
heart, and used to be a pattern for decency 
and good behaviour, forgetting all the blessings 
you have, and turning your mind to thoughts 
that you cannot understand, it falls on my 
heart like a lump of ice, and makes me see how

little an Irishman can be depended on. Jim, 
what makes the English respected, but that 
they have a fixed notion of what's right, in 
their heads, and will act up to it ? Do you 
think one or two mischievous men, who wanted 
to make a ladder of the poor ignorant creatures 
below 'em to climb up to power, could succeed 
with the sober, steady English? No, they 
would only be followed by the idle and worth- 
less, who had nothing else to do. But in Ire- 
land, any man who has what is called the gift 
of the gab, who can bother the brains of his 
hearers by making 'em angry, and telling 'em 
they are slaves, may govern the poor misguided 
creathures as he likes." 
" Will you tell me, Grace, if you plase, isn't 
it enough to dhrive a man mad, to see the police 
going about at every side, and on every occa- 
sion, like spies, to see what's doing, and like 
tyrants to punish .^"

" Faith, Jim, if people mean to do no harm, 
they need not be afraid of spies ; and sure it 's a 
lucky thing for the few that 's sober and steady, 
to have witnesses to prove that they are so, in a 
counthry where the bad conduct of so many 
makes all suspected. And that ""s another wick- 
edness of them Repalers, that they are always 
inflaming the people against the police, and 
encouraging bad blood between 'em, instead of 
saying, ' Boys, take care, and show the police 
how little they are wanted in the counthry/ 
And once the Parliament and the King is sure 
of this, they won't long be left here : the only 
way to do this is never to break through the 
laws, and to be orderly.*" 
" Faith, Grace, you 're grown quite a poli- 
tician ; I 'm surprised where you got all those 
quare notions into your head." 
" Now, Jim dear, don't say such a thing, 
for you 're mocking me. How could the like

of me be a politician ? and wouldn't it be 
foolish for a poor ignorant woman to thry to 
be one ? No, my buckaleen bawn, it 's only 
the plain sense of one who wishes to live in 
peace and quietness, and to see those she 
loves thriving and decent, instead of getting 
into scrapes. Besides, Jim, I hate ingrati- 
tude; and when I see, that to do the bid- 
ding of the Repalers, a man must be un- 
grateful to his landlord and the clergy, who 
though of a different persuasion, have been 
always doing him good; when I see that a 
man must fly in the face of God by break- 
ing his commandments, make his parents and 
their friends unhappy, and och ! Jim, break 
the heart of his poor wife, sure who can 
help thrying to open the eyes of those who 
are led astray from their duty by such bad 
advisers ?" 
Poor Grace's discourse was closed by tears,

that fell in torrents on her fair cheek ; and 
Jim, while wiping them with a corner of her 
apron, kissed their traces away. But, alas! 
the, tears still flowed, for he made no pro- 
mise of abandoning the courses which caused 
them ; and Grace felt a presentiment that he 
might cause her to shed still more, so in- 
fatuated did his weak mind appear. The 
woman who has to mourn over the weak- 
ness and bad conduct of him she loves, but 
cannot respect, is placed in one of the most 
painful and humiliating situations possible. 
Poor Grace felt keenly this unhappy convic- 
tion ; and as the blundering perversity of her 
husband became more apparent to her, and 
she saw he could not even defend the opi- 
nions he had adopted, she began to despair 
of leading him back to reason, well knowing 
there is no obstinacy like that which is founded 
on weakness and ignorance. She shuddered as

she reflected on the strong hold the Repealers 
must have established on such a basis ; and 
saw with dismay that they had entirely pos- 
sessed themselves of the only tangible points in 
their unfortunate adherents  imagination, pas- 
sion, and ignorance.

Grace prepared herself with a heavy heart, 
for her accustomed visit to the housekeeper 
at Springmount, to whom she was taking her 
humble offering of new honey, fresh eggs, and 
cream-cheese. 
Such visits had hitherto been epochs of plea- 
sure in the simple life of poor Grace. The 
compliments she received on the excellence of 
her presents  the kind and gentle words of 
encouragement spoken by the mistress, and

the young lady  with the useful gifts be- 
stowed on her by them, had rendered her 
visits to Springmount f^te-days to which 
she looked forward with delight, and, being 
passed, remembered with gratitude. But now, 
how differently should she face the great 
house ! for well she knew that Jim's altered 
conduct was well known there. How mor- 
tifying to hear him blamed without being 
able to defend him ! And what could she 
say, except what she had already so fre- 
quently said to herself, without its producing 
any satisfactory result, even to her partial 
feelings, " that he was led astray ?'' 
" Och ! Jim," ejaculated poor Grace, " little 
did I think, that I should live to be ashamed 
of you ; to hear you blamed, and not be able 
to clear you ! I was too proud of you ; and 
pride is sinful ; so I am punished in the ten- 
derest point. Sure if I tell 'em you are led

astray by bad advisers, is it not owning at 
once that you are a fool? and they will look 
do\>n on you as a poor weak creature; and 
yet this I must admit, for fear they should 
think you something worse, which I could 
not bear. Och ! how lucky are those whose 
husbands have good heads as well as good 
hearts, and who are not obliged to make ex- 
cuses for those they were once proud of. 
When I look at that hive of honey, as clear 
and bright as the elegant brooch Miss Des- 
mond wears in her habit-shirt, and think that 
last year, when I took one up to the great 
house, how the mistress herself and the young 
lady both came into the housekeeper''s-room 
to look at it, and told me that it was richer 
and brighter than any they had ever tasted 
or seen, except some in a foreign country 
with an outlandish name ; sure it was I that 
was proud to tell 'em, that if my honey was
## p. 65 (#73) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 65 
better than all the honey around the country, 
it was all because Jhn filled the garden with 
such quantities of sweet flowers, that the bees 
were feasting all day long without ever having 
the throuble of flying about the country, to find 
a wild flower here and there, and then come 
home only half laden, with their poor wings 
tired, but had the finest, and sweetest of 
flowers on the spot. How pleased the young 
lady used to look, and the good mistress too ! 
Then when they praised the cream-cheese, I 
could tell 'em that Jim took pride in having 
the nicest field of clover in the w^hole country 
for our cow, and hurdled it off* every week 
to give the creathure a fresh bite, so that 
our cream was richer and thicker than any 
the neighbours'* cows produced. The eggs 
too, they used to tell me, were whiter and 
cleaner than any one else''s, and looked like 
snow-drops in the basket. I was proud then

66 THE REPEALERS. 
of hearing things praised, because Jim came in 
for the best part of it ; but now, little he 
throubles himself about the flowers for the 
bees, or the grass for the cow, since he has 
taken to be always thinking of Repaling ; and 
as it's only me that takes care of things, I 
have no pleasure in hearing praises, because he 
has no share in them."" 
This was the soliloquy of poor Grace as she 
pursued her solitary walk to the great house, 
laden with her rustic dainties. A susceptibi- 
lity, caused by the consciousness of her hus- 
band's folly, made Grace unusually observant of 
her reception by the housekeeper. She thought, 
but it might be only fancy, that there was an 
air of commiseration in the look and tone of 
Mrs. Macnab, when addressing her, that be- 
trayed she knew that Grace was no longer 
the enviable being she had hitherto considered 
herself to be ; and when the presents were

THE REPEALERS. 67 
uncovered, the observation of Mrs. Macnab, 
" Sure they are as fine as ever, which is more 
than I expected from what I heard," made 
Grace feel that all was known. 
" I 'm sorry to see you looking so pale and 
thin, Mrs. Cassidy," continued the good-na- 
tured but obtuse housekeeper. " I 'm afraid 
you have cause for it. Come donH cry ; cry- 
ing won't help you, as I tells my niece every 
day, when she is crying and bemoaning her 
husband who died last year; and yet she 
tould me that she cried the more because 
she knew it was no good. I tould her it 
was better her husband died while he was an 
honest, sober man, than to have him live to 
turn out a Repaler ; and says I, ' Look at Jim 
Cassidy, wasn't he the pattern of a boy last 
year, and see what he is now ! Sure it would 
be better for his wife he was dead of a natural 
death, than to live to see him hanged or shot.'"
## p. 68 (#76) ##############################################
68 THE REPEALERS. 
A deadly paleness overspread the face of 
poor Grace : she made an effort to approach 
the open window for air ; but, overcome by the 
dreadful images which the obtuse Mrs. Mac- 
nab had called up in her mind, she fell fainting 
into a chair, to the no small discomfiture of 
the housekeeper, who, while assisting her, mur- 
mured to herself, " Well, this is the way, 
whenever I speak sense to people, and think 
to condole with 'em; they only take it more 
to heart, which is very ungrateful.*" 
The mistress and the young lady at this mo- 
ment approached the window, to give some 
orders to Mrs. Macnab ; when, observing the 
situation of their humble favourite, Grace, 
they hurried into the room to assist her. The 
voluble housekeeeper detailed to them the 
unaccountable, as she called it, fainting of 
Mrs. Cassidy, on her just hinting the proba- 
bility of her husband's being hanged or shot ;

THE REPEALERS. 69 
and the two ladies were obliged to command 
her to be silent, ere she could refrain from 
commenting on the grievous effects her reason- 
ings and consolations never failed to produce 
on the unhappy, who always took every thing 
ill that she said for their good. 
On Grace's opening her eyes, the first ob- 
jects that presented themselves before her, 
were the dear good mistress herself applying a 
smelling-bottle to her nostrils, and the darlint 
young lady, as she always called her, bathing 
her temples with eau de Cologne. 
This goodness was overpowering to the al- 
ready deeply-excited feelings of poor Grace ; 
and as she received their active and kind ser- 
vices, she thought it was terrible that her hus- 
band and his misguided friends should have 
been wrought on to believe that such people 
could be their enemies  could be aught except 
pitying friends.

" Och !'' thought Grace, " could Jim now 
see 'em, tending and nursing me as if I was a 
born lady, what would he, what could he 
think ? And these are hereticks ! people in the 
wrong road ! Och ! why was I born to see 
what is right, and to love it, yet be obliged to 
stick by what is wrong and false, because the 
one I lo-ve best on earth shuts his eyes against 
raison ? Och ! Jim, why cannot I lave off lov- 
ing you when I cannot respect you ? but to 
have my poor heart torn to pieces between 
blaming you and pitying you, sure it's too 
cruel ; and yet didn't I take you for better for 
worse, for richer for poorer, which, for poor 
people, must mane being happy or unhappy ? 
And now, when the raison has left you, and 
you have most need of me, I 'd be for blam- 
ing you, or laving you too ! Och ! no, cuish- 
lamachree, I '11 bear with your weakness ; 
and never shall it be said that Grace Cassidy

gave up her husband because he had fallen 
into throubles, though he brought 'em on him- 
self.'' 
All these thoughts had produced torrents of 
tears from the eyes of poor Grace, accompanied 
by tremulous pressures of the hands of the 
dear mistress and the darlint young lady. 
The pressures were understood, and kindly 
returned, and glances of unutterable love and 
gratitude disclosed her feelings to her dear 
good protectresses. 
A glass of wine having restored Grace to 
something like composure, she begged to be 
allowed to spake alone with the ladies, and 
Mrs. Desmond having led the way to her 
morning-room, insisted on Grace's taking a 
chair. 
" Och ! my honoured mistress," said Grace, 
" your goodness overpowers me. Had you re- 
proached me with the failings of my husband,
## p. 72 (#80) ##############################################
72 THE REPEALERS. 
I could have borne it ; but to see your pa- 
tience, your condescension, sure it 's too much. 
I see my poor Jim's wakeness ; my heart 
drops tears of blood more bitter than the tears 
that fall from my eyes, when I see his folly  his 
infatuation. Sure, I pass my time in thrying 
to raison with him, but what can a poor, igno- 
rant, wake woman, like me, say against all that 
them wicked, clever Repalers has put into his 
head ? If they tould him plain sense and com- 
mon raison, sure one might hope that he could 
tell what it was that convinced him, and one 
might thry to argue with him ; but, no ! it 's 
a parcel of fiery, flashing burning words, 
enough to raise the anger of a passionate man 
and the disdain of a raisonable one, that they 
have poured like melting lead into his ears, 
and like that same melted lead, the words keep 
the same fantastic images when cold that they 
had when they were hot, and the poor foolish

crathers that keep 'em in their minds, thry to 
warm *em again when they want to use 'em, 
but never can. Och ! ladies, don't hate my 
poor Jim. The head is gone wrong, but the 
heart is as right and honest as ever it was, and 
will bring him to the right road once more, or 
else I must find mine to the chuchyard. Ye '11 
hear stories of him, och ! dear ladies, but do 
not believe that he is more than foolish ; wick- 
ed, I trust, he will never be,  or if he should, 
then I pray that I may not live to see it ;  
And yet what am I saying ? Ought I not to 
pray that if such a misfortune is to befall him, 
I may live to comfort him, when nobody else 
will." 
Mrs. Desmond and her daughter tried to 
console Grace by kind and soothing expressions 
of their confidence in her good sense and con- 
duct, and the salutary effect they hoped it 
would produce on her husband.

They were interrupted by the arrival of 
Mr. Desmond, or the masther, as Grace al- 
ways called him, accompanied by Colonel For- 
rester, the commanding officer of the cavalry 
regiment at Waterford, who had come to pass 
a few days at Springmount. The kind 
salute by Mr. Desmond of " How d''ye do, my 
pretty Grace ? I 'm sure you have brought us 
some of yo\u' fine honey,"' and the guinea 
slipped into her hand, prevented not Grace's 
observing, with the intuitive quickness of a 
woman, and a woman who has loved, that the 
presence of the handsome Colonel Forrester 
had suffused the cheeks of Miss Desmond with 
a brighter red than she had ever seen them 
wear. And as the Colonel fixed his intelligent 
eyes, with an expression of pleasure that could 
not be mistaken, on the countenance of Miss 
Desmond, Grace could not help offering up a 
mental prayer, that his head might be able to

THE REPEALERS. 75 
resist bad advisers, and that her darlint young 
lady might never live, like her, to be ashamed 
of the object of her love. 
'' But," thought Grace, " am I not an 
ignorant, foolish creature to be thinking of 
such a thing ? Sure he 's a gentleman, and 
what 's more, an Englishman ; and they always 
listen to raison, and are never for breaking the 
law." 
Colonel Forrester, seeing the kindness with 
which Grace was treated b}^ the family at 
Springmount, and being interested by her 
pretty face and graceful figure, addressed a 
few words of compliment to her, not on her 
personal attractions,  for he had perception to 
feel she would have little pleasure in listening 
to this species of homage, but on her honey, 
which he told her he had tasted on his last 
visit, and which reminded him of that he had 
eaten in Greece some years before.

Grace left Springmount with a heart more 
at ease than when she had entered it. The 
kind and unaltered manners of the family had 
reassured her, and she felt that, arrive what 
might, on them she could reckon as true 
friends, prepared to put the most favourable 
interpretation on all her actions, and the least 
severe one on those of her misguided, but still 
dearly beloved husband.

" Lightly thou say'st that woman's love is false ; 
The thought is falser far  
For some of them are true as martyrs' legends ; 
As full of suffering faith, of burning love, 
Of high devotion  worthier of heaven than earth." 
On her route towards home, Grace met Mr. 
Disnay, and his wife and daughter, coming to 
dine at Springmount. Her humble courtsey 
was returned by the kind greetings of the family, 
each of whom had something good-natured to 
say to her. The jaunting-car, on which they 
were seated, was stopped some time that they 
might converse with her, and the good rec-

tor's wife told Grace, she had bought a gown 
for her from the pedlar a few days before, 
and hoped she would soon come for it. How 
did her grateful heart swell with thankfulness 
towards this excellent family ! yet there was 
bitterness mingled in the overflowing stream 
that ran through it, when she reflected, that 
such were the persons against whom the Re- 
pealers would arm the hand of her weak- 
minded husband. 
" To think," said Grace to herself, " how 
changed Jim is ! how, a few short months 
ago, he loved the masther and the family 
quite as well as I do, and Parson Disnay 
the same, though now  och ! shame on them 
that turns the poor against their best friends, 
and breaks down confidence and dependence 
between them !" 
On returning to her home, she found Jim 
moodily ruminating over the half-extinguished

fire, on which was placed the iron pot that 
contained their evening repast. He hardly 
noticed her entrance, and this unnatural cold- 
ness from one who had been accustomed to 
welcome her with joyful acclamations, brought 
tears into her eyes. She felt this neglect per- 
haps the more forcibly, from the contrast it 
offered to the kindness she had met with 
abroad ; but resolving not to show that she 
observed it, lest she should offend Jim, she 
approached him with a smile, and stooped 
to kiss his forehead. He submitted in silence 
to the caress, that he had till lately sought 
with eagerness, and then said  
" So, Grace, I find you have been thrying to 
curry favour, by taking your presents of honey, 
cream-cheese, and eggs, over to the great 
house ? Sure it^s very mane of you, to be put-

Isn\ it very quare to see a wife turning 
against her own husband,  moreover a wife 
that is devout? Sure the Repalers are right 
enough when they say, that the worse we're 
traited the greater slaves we are." 
" Jim dear,'' said Grace, " you 've let the 
boodoch* get into your own good heart at this 
present moment ; you think of our thrue friends 
not as they are  not as you 've known 'em, and 
proved 'em to be for years, but as your bad 
advisers thry to make you believe they are. 
You well know I would not, I could not 
turn against you, if the whole world was 
turned against you ; and sure, Jim, it 's a bad 
sign of your new friends, when they make 
you suspect your own wife. Look at me, 
my own dear Jim, and tell me if I 'm not

that you loved  but that, och ! Jim, that I

should live to say it ! you love no longer. If 
my cheeks are pale, and my eyes heavy, och ! 
think, Jim, it'*s fretting and grieving that makes 
'em so ; and could I see you as you used to 
be, I "'d soon look as gay and as happy as 
ever I was. You used to make me the hap- 
piest woman in all Cologan; but now, Jim,"" 
and here her voice faltered from emotion, " I 
am the most unhappy, because I can't forget 
what you were.'' 
" Well, Grace ma-vourneen, I 'm grieved 
to hear you say this. Faith, I love you better 
than every thing in the world, barring the poor 
counthry ; and it 's because I wish to help to 
get her out of her throubles that I put you 
into your's. Sure it 's hard for a man to choose 
between his wife and his counthry anyway, when 
the good of one is often quite opposed to the 
good of the other ; just as it 's hard to hate 
tyrants in a body, and to like 'em separately.

they are so, I can't get the ould liking out of 
my heart, and this keeps me always in a bad 
humour. You think, a cuishlamachree, that 
you have all the sorrowful thoughts to your-

when I was here, all alone by myself, and 
looked about me, and saw the stocking you 
were knitting for me, with my name so beauti- 
fully knit in it, and the flower-pots in the win- 
dow, all placed by your own hands, and every 
thing so tidy and so clean  sure I fell into a 
sort of a waking dream, and thought over all 
the past times ; and while I was thinking, the 
smell of the flowers came in through the open 
windows; and when the smell of fine flowers 
comes near me, it always reminds me of you, 
Grace, and puts soft thoughts into my heart.

Then the bees came humming about, with 
such a pleasant sound, and the birds began 
singing, as if they knew they were among 
friends ; the cricket chirping in the corner of 
the hearth, just as if it never minded me. 
Sure the tears came into my eyes, and I 
thought what a pleasant, beautiful world this 
would be if every one was contint ! But then 
came the remembrance of all that the Repalers 
tell us, and I grew angry with myself for for- 
getting, which I am constantly doing, that Fm

tyrants that have thrown the chains over me; 
and just as I had got angry with myself, you

open your eyes to the folly of listening to bad 
advisers, and open your heart to all the inno-

give. Sure they 're ungrateful, agrah, that says 
this is a bad world, and that we live in bad 
times ; if the world and the times are bad, it 's 
our own evil thoughts and evil ways that 
makes 'em so. Who that has the blessing of a 
free conscience, can look around in the sum- 
mer, and see the beautiful skies, earth, and 
waters, with the trees, herbs, and flowers which 
God has given us, and hear the happy birds 
carolling around, without feeling that such a 
pleasant world was not given for people to be 
discontented in ? Each season has its plea- 
sures ; for when the winter comes, and all with- 
out doors looks so cold and dreary, not a leaf 
on the poor shivering trees, or a flower to be 
seen, sure it 's a pleasure to see a fine blazing 
fire, a nice clean hearth, with a warm, com-

little kitchen shining by the light of the fire,

to be discontented !"

" For his bounty, 
There was no winter in 't ; an autumn 'twas, 
That grew the more by reaping." 
Mr. Desmond, the landlord, or masther as 
he was called by his tenants, was a gentleman 
of ancient family and large fortune, deservedly 
popular in his county. He had travelled much 
in his youth, and had, late in life, married an 
English lady of high birth, his junior by many 
years, who made him the happy father of 
Frances Desmond, the young lady, or the 
young mistress, as the peasantry loved to call

her, who has been already presented to our 
readers. 
Mr. Desmond was in his sixtieth year, and 
his fair daughter had just entered on her 
eighteenth, at the period when Colonel For- 
rester's regiment came into their neighbour- 
hood. An acquaintance, commenced through 
that urbane hospitality which distinguishes 
the Irish gentry, had soon ripened into in- 
timacy between Mr. Desmond and the Co- 
lonel, and into a still warmer feeling be- 
tween him and Miss Desmond. His visits 
to Springmount were as frequent as his mi- 
litary duties would permit ; and they were 
welcomed by the whole family with undis- 
guised pleasure. Indeed, the personal and 
mental qualifications of Colonel Forrester were 
such as must have insured him a cordial re- 
ception wherever he presented himself; but in 
the remote quarter where he was at present

established, he was so superior to the generality 
of the surrounding young men, that the welcome 
accorded to him lavishly displayed all the 
friendship and esteem which his valuable quali- 
ties so deservedly inspired. 
Mrs. Desmond, accustomed to the good- 
breeding and reserve that characterizes her 
countrymen,  which, if less calculated to amuse, 
is more formed to excite respect than is the 
gay flippancy of the more mercurial Irish 
gentlemen,  felt highly gratified by the society 
of Colonel Forrester ; and perhaps the plea- 
sure was enhanced by the knowledge that he 
belonged to a high aristocratic family with 
whom her own was distantly connected. 
Mr. Desmond had lived so long in England, 
that he had adopted all its elegances and com- 
forts in his dwelling and mode of life, and 
its refinement in manners was grafted on 
the unceremonious cordiality that always re-

mains such an agreeable peculiarity in the 
high-bred Irish. He loved the English, as 
he often declared, for many reasons, but prin- 
cipally on account of his wife ; while she on 
every occasion displayed a partiality to her 
adopted country, no less indicative of her 
goodness of heart, than of the strong affec- 
tion that bound her to him who had trans- 
planted her to his native soil. While ame- 
liorating the condition of the tenants and la- 
bourers of her husband, and giving them a 
taste for cleanliness, and the power of enjoy- 
ing it, no mortifying comparisons between 
them and the more civilized peasantry of 
happier England ever escaped her. Their self- 
love was never wounded, though all that could 
excite emulation in habits of order and de- 
cency, were put into action. 
The gardener had orders to supply every 
family around with plants, and to encourage

the propagation of the different vegetables, to 
diversify their food. Flower roots, seeds, and 
slips of geraniums, were liberally supplied to 
all who wished to decorate their gardens or 
flower-pots; and the housekeeper had instruc- 
tions never to refuse assistance to the sick or 
needy, but to furnish them with broth, food, 
or wine. Clothing was distributed to those 
who were too poor to buy it, and useful pre- 
sents were sent to the more wealthy ; so that it 
is not to be w^ondered at, that the family of 
Springmount were loved and respected by the 
whole country. 
The beneficent influence which they ex- 
ercised, was visible in the appearance of the 
whole neighbourhood aroimd them. The 
clean, and well-built cottages, with glass 
windows made to open ; the gay patches 
of gardens in front, where flaunted many a 
flower from the parent stock at Springmount ;

the tidy, well-clipped hedges, and the total 
absence from sight of dunghills, and their 
animated accompaniments  pigs wallowing in 
the verdant mire, proclaimed that improve- 
ment was abroad, and that the lower orders 
of Irish only want example and assistance to 
become a civilized peasantry, instead of a 
lawless set of savages. Whole fields of tur- 
nips might be seen in the neighbourhood of 
Springmount, unmolested by any robber, save 
the birds, because Mr. Desmond had culti- 
vated them so largely that, with all the dis- 
respect for meum and tuum attributed to the 
poor Irish, there was now no temptation to 
steal what all might have for the asking ; 
while on a neighbouring property, the few 
turnip-fields scattered around were obliged to 
be guarded, and were pillaged whenever op- 
portunity admitted of depredation. 
Mrs. Desmond encouraged dairies, and her

dairy-maids taught those who were willing to 
learn, how to make milk-cheeses, so that the 
poor labourers went to their work with a pro- 
vision of home-made bread and cheese, instead 
of half-cold potatos, their former habitual 
food ; and seldom did they partake their more 
comfortable repasts, without thanking the good 
mistress who had been the means of their 
enjoying it. 
The country was in this progressive state of 
improvement, when a contested election dis- 
turbed its tranquillity, and Repeal (that watch- 
word of agitation) spread like wildfire over it. 
Their very prosperity was pointed out to the 
poor illiterate peasantry, who had hitherto been 
proud of it, as the badge of their slavery ; 
their comforts and luxuries were decried as the 
cunning inventions of their tyrants, to render 
them dependent and luxurious ; and they were 
told that their gardens were filled with flowers,

to prevent their observing the evil weeds that 
were springing up afresh every day in the rank 
garden of corruption ; and the words, "Tyrant,'' 
and " Slave Driver," were now become the 
synonymes for landlord. 
The Irish heart is not naturally ungrateful, 
far from it ; but unfortunately, as in the richest 
soils tares and briars will spring up among 
the flowers, so in the good hearts of the 
Irish many virtues are sullied by defects; and 
the mobility of disposition of this fiery people 
renders them so incapable of reflection, that, 
hurried away by their impetuosity, they often 
appear ungrateful when they are only forget- 
ful ; the forgetfulness being produced by the 
temporary predominance of some other feeling ; 
for rarely does the mind of an Irishman possess 
the power of entertaining two passions at the 
same moment. 
The peasants in the neighbourhood of Spring-

mount now began to view even the acts of 
kindness shown to them with a suspicious 
eye, and to consider advice or remonstrance 
as an unjust and tyrannical interference with 
their free will. Beholding every thing through 
the discoloured medium of their over-excited 
imaginations, the most unimportant occur- 
rences assumed a grave aspect. Every attempt 
to control their turbulence was resented as an 
injury, and the cause of such attempts was for- 
gotten by the reckless perpetrators, in the 
resentful fury the effects produced. It is with 
the Irish people as with sin,  who shall say to 
either, " Thus far shalt thou go, and no far- 
ther ?" The first step made, the descent be- 
comes rapid ; and they who have invoked the 
storm, are often powerless to save their agents 
from its fearful devastation. 
Mr. Desmond had too much knowledge of 
human nature in general, and of Irish nature

THE REPEALERS. 95 
in particular, to be as much surprised as he 
was pained, by the change operated on the 
minds of his tenantry by the popular clamour. 
He felt that, if met with prudence and firmness, 
the sea of trouble that threatened to overflow 
might subside ; but that any display of undue 
warmth in resisting their encroachments, might 
make that a party feeling which was at pre- 
sent but a partial infatuation ; and he dreaded 
to see enlisted beneath the banners of popular 
excitement, the heated and exaggerated senti- 
ments of his too easily-excited countrymen. 
He represented to the gentlemen and magis- 
trates in the country, the necessity of perfect 
union and good understanding among them- 
selves, to oppose the unruly and misguided 
peasantry, and to prevent their taking any de- 
cisive step in their meditated violation of the 
laws. 
" Better is it," said he, " to prevent crime.

96 THE REPEALERS. 
than to have to punish it ;" and acting on this 
principle,  a principle hitherto far too little act- 
ed upon in Ireland,  he determined to await the 
result, and opposed the proposals of the gentry 
around him, to demand an increase of military 
force and civil power from the Government. 
" Let us not show these misled people that 
we fear them," said Mr. Desmond ; " but let us 
by our forbearance, as long as forbearance is 
possible, prove that we prefer convincing their 
reason to coercing their persons. The laws 
have never been respected, as they ought to be, 
in Ireland. Military force is always called in 
to support them, and it is difficult to impress 
on an ignorant people, a respect for that which 
the bayonet alone forces them to endure." 
Mr. Desmond had a large fortune in the 
funds, and his estates being unentailed, he had 
the power of bequeathing it to his daughter. 
This rendered her in point of wealth, one of

THE REPEALERS. 97 
the richest heiresses in the kingdom, and, 
joined to her personal attractions, had al- 
ready obtained numerous suitors for her hand. 
Colonel Forrester was the first who had made 
a favourable impression on her youthful fancy, 
and this was strengthened by each succeeding 
interview. The passion she had excited in him, 
was the strongest he had ever known ; and its 
vividness and increasing warmth led him to 
reflect on their mutual positions. 
" Was it hkely," he asked himself, " that 
Mr. Desmond would give his fair heiress to 
a soldier, whose patrimony consisted of an 
estate of not more than two thousand a-year.^ 
No ! he surely would wish to see her allied 
to some nobleman, or at least to some person of 
suitable fortune to her own. With this con- 
viction, ought he to continue his visits to 
Springmount  visits that could only serve to 
rivet still more closely the chains that bound

him to its fair heiress ? And yet how resign 
the happiness of seeing her ? 
But when did a man in love do what he 
ought to do, except in fiction ? The next day 
saw the handsome Colonel pursuing his route 
to Springmount, thinking only of the plea- 
sure of seeing the lovely Frances^ eyes sparkle 
at his approach, and her cheeks blush a rosier 
red. 
In compliance with all received notions on 
such points, Frances Desmond ought to have 
concealed every external demonstration of the 
pleasure Colonel Forrester's visits gave her, 
until he had made her a formal declaration. 
Her wishes, according to the verse of the 
most witty and not most delicate-minded 
woman of her day, ought to have been in 
her keeping until he had told her what they 
were to be. But she was an artless child of 
Nature, and had wished that Colonel Forrester

THE REPEALERS. 99 
might always be at Spririgmount long before 
she knew that the feeling was reciprocal ; and 
he found the wish increase on his part by 
observing the involuntary proofs of satisfac- 
tion his presence afforded her. He rode by 
her side, to see all the fine points of view 
in the neighbourhood ; and, strange to say, 
neither felt the presence of Mr. Desmond a 
restraint, nor  as in fashionable phraseology, a 
third person, and that person a father, under 
such circumstances would be considered  a 
bore. 
I would it were possible, consistently with 
truth and nature, to paint Frances Desmond 
otherwise than as she is, or was, reader, when 
we knew her in the year 1832. Then would 
you see our veritable heroine as heroines are 
seen on paper, but not as they are found 
in real life, if, indeed, heroines still exist. 
With heroic courage, yet timid as the fright-

ened fawn ; possessing all the delicacy of in- 
disposition, and yet all the bloom of health  
two qualifications that it never has been our 
good fortune to encounter, except on paper,  
refined sensibilit}^, " dying of a rose in aro- 
matic pain,"" united to 
" The will to suffer, and unshrinking bear 
Ills that the timid fill with trembling fear ;" 
she should unite in her sweet and fragile per- 
son all the opposing qualities that the step- 
dame Nature never allows to meet ; and when 
we had drawn this " faultless monster that the 
world ne'er saw," we should feel convinced of 
having merited your suffrages. 
But, alas ! the age of heroines, as well as 
of chivalry, is past, and we must be content 
to represent Frances Desmond as Nature made 
her, not a faultless person, but a very at- 
tractive and lovely girl. 
The morning after Colonel Forrester's arri-

val, the letter-bag brought him a letter, for- 
warded from head-quarters, the perusal of 
which seemed to afford him little pleasure; 
and the same conveyance brought Mr. Des- 
mond an official document, dated " Castle, 
Dublin," that appeared to give him still less 
satisfaction. 
We have frequently had opportunities of 
observing the various emotions exhibited on 
the arrival of the locked post-bags in country- 
houses ; and truth compels us to declare, that 
the predominating feelings on such occasions 
have been generally gloomy or vexatious. This 
observation of ours has led us to reflect still 
farther on the subject ; and the resume of our 
reflections is this suggestion,  that henceforth 
the opening of the Sibyl bag be performed in 
solitude ; and that the letters be placed on the 
dressing-tables of the addressed, where the 
reader may contemplate, between each period.

its effects on his or her countenance reflected in 
the mirror, and endeavour to profit by the ad- 
monition thus impressively conveyed, instead 
of being surrounded by the inquisitive ob- 
servers who invariably infest the breakfast- 
tables or desserts, the usual places and hours 
of receiving letters in country-houses. 
But to return to Springmount, whence we 
have been withdrawn by this digression. The 
owner of this mansion and Colonel Forrester 
exchanged glances on perusing the concluding 
lines of their respective communications, and 
retired to the library, where we shall leave 
them in consultation, while we return to the 
humble cottage of Jim Cassidy.

CHAPTER IX. 
" Grief is the unhappy charter of our sex ; 
The gods who gave us readier tears to shed, 
Gave us more cause to shed them." 
We left Jim with softened feelings, attuned 
to those of Grace, which were overflowing with 
the milk of human kindness. 
A peaceful night followed their tranquil 
evening, in which Jim dreamed that he fought 
and vanquished the hydra-headed enemy that 
assailed his poor ould counthry  one face 
darting forth its forked tongue, filled with 
venom to destroy, and the other trying to re-

move the poison with its slaver. Jim imagined 
that he was placing the crown of Ireland (that 
crown whose thorns have pierced every head 
that has worn it) on the white locks of the 
ould masther, when he was awakened by re- 
peated knocking at his door, to inform him 
that the " Sociation would meet at Kilmack- 
thomas that evening, and that there would be 
great work there."" 
" Och ! don't go, Jim dear," cried Grace, 
while her face became blanched with terror. 
" On my bended knees I pray you not to go, 
and sure you can't have the heart to refuse 
your own poor Grace this prayer." 
" Well sure, Grace ma-vourneen, I ^m sorry 
to refuse you, but it 's quite impossible for me 
not to go. What would the boys think P" 
" Jim, Jim, what matter what they think ? 
Does their thoughts make your happiness or 
unhappiness ? But sure, Jim, your own faith-

ful wife, your poor Grace, who has no happiness 
but you  can you leave me, with all this terri- 
ble foreboding at my heart, as if ice- water was 
running through my veins ? Och ! Jim, it 's 
thrue I 'm but a wake woman, but if the 
notion of what all the world put together 
might think of any thing I was to do came in 
comparison with one thought of yours, sure 
I 'd never balance one minute, but give up all 
to make you contented. Och ! Jim, this is the 
way a woman loves ; why don't men, who are 
stronger, love as well ?"'"' 
This is a problem whose solution may more 
probably be found in the weakness than in the 
strength of men. 
Vain were Grace^s arguments, entreaties, and 
tears, to retain Jim. To the " Sociation" he 
was determined to go, and the obstinacy of his 
weak head triumphed over the pleadings of his 
heart, which urged him to comply with the

prayers of his wife. Obstinacy is almost al- 
ways found to exist in proportion to the weak- 
ness of the intellect where it is lodged, and, 
strange to say, is often mistaken by its posses- 
sor for firmness ; he, however, is the only 
person who can entertain any doubt on this 
subject, for all who come in contact with him, 
are soon aware of the difference,  a difference 
unlike many others, because it has a striking 
distinction. 
Grace is not the first, and certainly will not 
be the last, woman whose strength of head 
offered little consolation for her weakness of 
heart ; and she mourned the departure of her 
husband with bitter tears ; partly occasioned 
by her dread of his compromising his safety or 
reputation at the " Sociation ;" and partly by 
the consciousness that he no longer heeded her 
prayers, though once, and at no distant period, 
they could stay his most stubborn resolves.
## p. 107 (#115) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 107 
Tears are never so bitter as when we know that 
they fall unheeded, and poor Grace felt that 
her's had lost their power. She tried to occupy 
herself with her household duties ; sat down by 
the window to her spinning-wheel, and while 
her foot sent it revolving, and her taper fin- 
gers spun the thread, she murmured the fol- 
lowing ditty :  
" Och ! once I thought no tear of mine 
Could fall, but soon you 'd wipe it dry  
But now I 'm left alone to pine, 
Och ! woe is me, I can't but cry. 
" For you I left a mother's care, 
And an adoring father too ; 
I little thought I 'd have to bear 
Cold looks, and colder words, from you. 
" Och ! where 's the love you swore to me, 
For which I gave you all my heart ? 
Ah ! woe is me, too plain I see 
That happiness and I must part." 
The plaintive voice of Grace, and the senti-

ment of the simple ditty, which was the lament 
of the wife of a freebooter, composed some 
fifty years before, accorded so well with her 
present feelings, as to renew her tears. She 
left her wheel, and, drying her eyes, stood at 
the open door, trusting that the fine day and 
elegant prospect, as she called it, might divert 
her. 
It was one of those beautiful, calm, sunshiny 
days, when the sky is one unbroken sheet of 
blue, and the clear waters that reflect it seem to 
give back its azure tint in sparkling brilliancy ; 
the trees were scarcely agitated by the air, 
and yet there was a lightness and freshness in 
the atmosphere, that brought relief to the 
feverish brow and heated eyes of poor Grace. 
" Sure he ^11 have a beautiful day for his 
walk across the mountain," thought Grace, 
reverting with true feminine feeling to him 
who occupied all her thoughts. " How strange

THE REPEALERS. 109 
it is that I can't see a fine day, a clear blue 
sky, or the beautiful trees looking down at 
themselves in the river, but it makes me think 
of Jim. Sure this is mighty quare ; I won- 
der if the quality have such notions. I won- 
der if Miss Desmond thinks of the Curnel 
when she sees every thing looking so elegant 
about her ; but I suppose she has too many 
fine thoughts in her head to have room for all 
the loving ones that's in mine, for sure the 
love and liking is the chief comfort of the poor, 
and the rich have so many other comforts, that 
they can't enjoy this as we do, and yet for all 
this, faith, the dear young lady looked as fool- 
ish at the Curnel as I used to do at Jim before 
he axed me to marry him.''

CHAPTER X. 
" Oh ! grief hath changed me since you saw rae last, 
And careful hours, with Time's deformed hand. 
Have written strange defeatures in my face." 
Grace's soliloquy was interrupted by the 
arrival of Larry M'Swigger, an old neighbour 
of her father's, who, happening to be in that 
part of the country, came to see her. 
" Then how are you, Mistress Cassidy ?" 
demanded Larry, saluting Grace with a cordial 
shake of the hand and a kiss on the cheek. 
" Sure it 's myself that 's glad to see you 
anyways, for the sight of you is good for sore

eyes ; and, faith, mine has a good right to be 
sore, for sure I 've had salt tears in 'em enough 
to salt a leg of pork,  ay, faith, a whole side 
of pork, this last three months." 
*' Indeed, and I 'm sorry for your throuble, 
Larry," answered Grace. " I heard, sure 
enough, that you lost your poor woman some 
time ago, but I thought that as you hadn't 
seen her for a long while, maybe you had got 
used to living without her." 
" Och ! then. Mistress Cassidy, how can you, 
who have a tinder heart, be. after saying such a 
thing to me? Sure it's the being such a long 
while without seeing my poor Molly, that 
makes me in all this throuble. If we had been 
living dacently and rispectably together, quar- 
relling every day, like most other married 
couples, I might soon get over my grief, and 
think, perhaps, her going before me on the 
long road was all for the better ; but it 's so

long since I parted from the creathure, and she 
had gone so clear and clane out of my head for 
so many years, that now I know she is dead, 
faith, she comes back into my mind for all the 
world as she was whin I first married her, and 
I can't for the life of me dhrive her away. She 
is always before me, with her purty coal-black 
hair, her cheeks like two red apples, and her 
roguish eyes laughing in her head ; and sure 
isn't this enough to break the heart of me ? If 
I saw her as she was latterly, sure I could not 
have such false r^ tions, for then I 'd know 
that it was a poor ugly ould woman that was 
.dead, instead of a sprightly, purty girl ; but 
it 's all in vain for me to be thrying to remem- 
ber how she looked before I parted from her, 
when we used to be fighting and squabbling 
all day bekase I 'd take the dhrop, and that I 
used to think she looked like the north side of 
a crab-tree, so sour and contrairy when I came

home. No, faith, Mrs. Cassidy, all this is gone 
clane out of my mind, and I'm just grieving 
my heart out for the clane, sprightly Colleen 
dhas I was once so fond of, instead of thinking 
of the poor ould woman that ""s gone to her long 
home. Then whin I thry to comfort myself by 
rimimbering the nicknames and bitter words 
she used to say to me, I can't bring one of 'em 
fresh into my thoughts, but all the loving 
words is always coming into my ears ; and 
aren't I obliged to go and look at myself in the 
bit of looking-glass I 've got, to prove I 'm not 
the buckaleen bawn, and the clane, tidy boy 
that poor Molly used to call me in ould times ; 
and whin I see the ould wizen face of me in the 
glass, and all the wrinkles falling out about my 
eyes like an ould stocking about the heels of a 
beggar-man, faith, I don't know whether to 
laugh or cry, I feel so quare. Och ! Mistress 
Cassidy, sure it 's a droll thing to have the

thoughts and loving notions I had forty years 
ago all coming back young and fresh into my 
heart, for all the world as if they had been 
asleep ever since, and to see the ould face and 
the ould body outside, that is like a cabin 
falling to ruin, and the inside so fresh. All 
this comes from poor Molly's dying : sure 
it has brought grief and throuble on me any 
way." 
" Indeed, Larry, I feel for you, and am 
sorry for your poor wife. Won't you break 
bread in the house, for lucksake .?"" 
" I won't refuse you. Mistress Cassidy, for 
sure enough the ould saying is thrue, sorrow 
is dry, and I '11 be glad enough to take a glass 
of whatever you give me, while I tell you the 
rest of my throubles." 
While Larry M'Swigger partook of the re- 
past Grace laid before him, to which he did 
ample honour, washing it down with repeated

THE REPEALERS. 115 
draughts of cider, he continued his narrative in 
the following words -: 
" Maybe you'd be thinking, Mistress Cas- 
sidy, that it was throuble enough for me to 
lose poor Molly once by death ; but what will 
you say when I tell you I have lost her three 
times ?" 
Grace's countenance expressed the astonish- 
ment to which she was going to give utterance, 
when Larry emphatically exclaimed, " Whisht /" 
the Irish word for silence, and thus continued : 
" Whisht ! don't stop or hinder me till I Ve 
told you all ; for if you do, the story is so 
long, that I won't have finished it this blessed 
night." 
The threat produced the desired effect on 
Grace, who, though her curiosity was somewhat 
excited, had no desire that the narrative or the 
narrator should continue until night. 
" Well, then, to begin at the beginning,

Mistress Cassidy. Sure when myself heard 
from Dublin that poor Molly had died in the 
hospital, and that she begged with her last 
words that I'd take her home, and bury her 
dacently among her people, and not lave her 
to lie among strangers in Dublin,  sure I pro- 
mised before God and man, that I'd neither 
stop nor stay till I 'd bring her home ; so I took 
a car, and put a good feather-bed in it, and 
put Sallys and kippins about it, and covered it 
over with a fine stuff quilt, till I made it into 
as ilegant a chaise-marine as ever you set your 
eyes on, for I was determined the poor crea- 
thure should have every thing dacent for her 
journey home, and that the rain should not 
come to her. Well, I took old Baucherem, 
my horse, that drew the car quite aisy and com- 
fortable, and faith we arrived in Dublin the 
sixteenth day. 
" I went next morning to the hospital.
## p. 117 (#125) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 117 
They showed me the grave where poor Molly- 
was put in, and I took the coffin and all, just 
as it was, put it in my chaise-marine, and 
packed up half-a-dozen bottles of parliament 
whisky with it, just to refresh me on the 
road, and to keep the throuble out of my heart. 
When the night was falling, I didn't quite like 
to be all alone with poor Molly, so I made 
ould Baucherem gallop while ever I could; and 
to hear the coffin rattling against the car, faith, 
it was very awful ! But at last the coffin seemed 
to be fixed quite steady, for I heard no more 
noise ; and when I came to the public-house 
where we were to stop for the night, and tould 
'em who was in the chaise-marine, sure they 
wint out to help me to bring Molly into a 
dacent room, that we might wake her gen- 
teelly, when the devil a bit of poor Molly

coffin must have fallen on the road. This I 
call the second time of losing poor Molly, and 
we had eleven miles to go before we found her 
again. 
" Well, to make a long story short, at last I 
arrived at her own place, and I had got so 
used to having the poor creathure with me, 
that many's the shanahos about ould times I 
had with her on the road. I tould her every 
thing that happened ever since she went away, 
and often I thought, Mistress Cassidy, that 
poor Molly must be grately altered to let me 
have all the talk to myself. Sure when I re- 
flected I had not behaved genteelly to her for 
so many years, in never sending her anything, 
not so much as a scratch of a pen, faith, 1 
thought I 'd make up for it, and I axed her 
pardon, and said every thing that was dacent 
and comfortable to her, to make her mind and 
my own aisy.

" Well, sure there was Nelly Lynch, an old 
gossip of Molly's, at Cappoquin ; and when I 
was waking Molly the night before I was to 
bury her, sure Nelly and I took a glass too 
much in dhrinking a happy and a blessed rest 
to poor Molly, and Nelly takes it into her 
head that we should open the coffin, and look 
at poor Molly. No sooner said than done; 
but just think what I felt when I saw a bald 
head and an ugly ould face, no more like 
Molly's than I 'm like what I was. ' Sure,' 
says I, * this never can be my Molly,  she 
that was such a purty, clane, sprightly girl !' 
' Well,' says Nelly, * that baits everything. 
Here you are thrying to conceit an ould 
woman of past sixty into a purty clane girl,' 
and Nelly was quite affronted like, bekase I 
wanted to prove that Molly was once too 
handsome to be like the ugly ould creathure in 
the coffin.

" She looked at her again and again, and 
said she 'd know her amongst a thousand, for 
that she was not a bit changed. This vexed 
me, and I went up quite close to the coffin, 
with the candle in my hand, and looking close 
to the corpse, I said, ' Well, Mistress Lynch,' 
for I was too angry to call her Nelly, ' maybe 
you 'd be for telling me that my poor wife had 
grey whiskers, and a beard twice as thick and 
as hard as my own, for here they are.' She 
was thrying to persuade me that she had, and 
that this was still Molly, when, in my passion, 
I lifted up the winding-sheet, and there was 
not Molly, sure enough, but a poor ould sol- 
dier with a wooden-leg, and covered over with 
the marks of wounds. This was what I call 
losing Molly a third time, and after all the ex- 
pinse and throuble I had to bring her down* 
And to think of my opening my heart and

instead of my poor woman. 
" But great as my grief and disappointment 
was, still it was a comfort to show Nellv 
Lynch that my poor wife was not grown an 
ugly, ould, bald-headed creathure ; and now 
I 'U always maintain, in spite of her teeth, 
that Molly died a clane, purty, sprightly girl, 
the notion of which puts the envious, jea- 
lous creathure out of her wits. I buried the 
poor ould soldier dacently, and as I never can 
have money enough to go to Dublin again to 
bring down Molly to lie among her people, 
faith, she must take the will for the deed, and 
be con tint where she is. And for ray part, Mis- 
tress Cassidy, now that I have not seen her so 
long, and never did see her as a corpse, I have 
the satisfaction, and a grate one it is, if you 
believe me, of thinking of her only as she was

CHAPTER XI. 
" Dans les conseils d'un 6tat, il ne faut pas tant regarder 
ce qu'on doit faire, que ce qu'on peut faire." 
The letter that clouded the brow of Mr. 
Desmond came from the Secretary for Ireland ; 
it detailed the exaggerated accounts received 
at the Castle, and the anxiety of his Excel- 
lency the Lord Lieutenant to ascertain whether 
such reports were correct, and what steps the 
resident gentry considered would be most 
likely to establish peace and good understand- 
ing in the country. Mr. Desmond made Co- 
lonel Forrester acquainted with its contents, 
g2

who, in return, laid before him the letter from 
the General commanding his district, urging 
the necessity of keeping the troops always on 
the alert, and the officers at their posts. 
" How, my dear young friend," said Mr. Des- 
mond, " shall I answer this unanswerable let- 
ter ? There is so much truth mingled with the 
misrepresentations that have gone to the Castle, 
that it is difficult to draw the line between 
what to believe or disbelieve. Judging by the 
actions of our poor misguided peasantry, the 
statements sent to his Excellency may be borne 
out, for, alas ! we all know that the actions of 
Irishmen are the avant-couriers of their inten- 
tions, instead of being, as in sober England, 
the followers ; and if they are judged by them, 
then must they be condemned. A prejudiced 
judge for or against might find sufficient evi- 
dence to acquit or condemn them ; while I, who 
am impartial, see much to lament, much to

blame, and if the country was freed from the 
hateful influence of agitators, little to fear. 
But how to suggest the remedy, how cut the 
Gordian-knot of habitual misrule ; how solve 
that enigma, more difficult than that of the 
sphynx, and which has puzzled every statesman 
for centuries to expound, namely,  what is the 
best plan to govern Ireland peaceably ? First, 
get rid of agitators  buy them at any price ; 
for as well may a physician endeavour to bring 
back health to the system of a patient dying of 
fever, without having unseated the disease, as a 
government attempt to restore peace and good 
order to this country, until its moral typhus, 
so much more fatal than all the physical 
fevers that ever attacked it, is subdued. But 
while the government is deliberating, the evil 
gains ground. This very day there is a meet- 
ing of the association held at Kilmackthomas, 
where the seeds of discontent and dissension

will be widely disseminated in the fruitful soil 
of the inflammable minds of the people, to 
bring forth an abundant harvest of mischief at 
no distant day. I hope, my dear Colonel, that 
I need not impress on your mind the prudence 
of not placing your brave troops too much at 
the beck of the alarmists. All collision be- 
tween the people and the military leads to evil, 
and should only be had recourse to in cases of 
absolute necessity ; but here, in this unhappy, 
and, alas ! wilfully unhappy country, where 
every district presents opposing factions and 
interests, and where the good of the many is 
sacrificed to the advantage of the few, it is 
most difficult for a military man to know how 
to steer his course, and impossible to avoid 
being thought too lenient by the alarmists, and 
too severe by the disaffected. I shall go to 
Dublin, and reply in person to the letter from 
the Castle ; and as 1 am no jobber and have no

fare of my poor country, I shall be listened to

Mr. Desmond left the library to prepare for 
his departure, and Colonel Forrester sought 
the boudoir of Mrs. Desmond, where he knew 
he was certain of finding the fair Frances, 
pursuing her accustomed occupations of read- 
ing, working, or drawing, by the side of her 
mother. 
Mr. Desmond ascertained that the meeting 
at Kilmackthomas passed off more peaceably 
than he had expected, though, as usual, in- 
flammatory language had excited the passions 
of the people, who returned to their homes, 
bearing in their minds the seeds of discon- 
tent and sedition, ready to fructify into acts 
of hostility on the first occasion. He found 
that nearly the whole of his tenantry had 
attended the meeting, and were as loud and

animated in their plaudits of the hyperbo- 
lical speeches of the popular speaker, as if 
they had personally experienced all the mi- 
series arising from the tyranny and oppression 
Avhich the artful demagogue so glowingly de- 
picted. 
The good man felt grieved at their ingra- 
titude, and sighed to think that a long life, 
passed in a conscientious and zealous dis- 
charge of the duties of a resident landlord, 
had made so little impression on their duc- 
tile feelings, and that the spirit-stirring wo7'ds 
of the Repealers could efface the deeds of 
the friend. It is such examples of ingra- 
titude that wean people, less resolute than 
Mr. Desmond in virtue and forbearance, from 
the discharge of their patriotic duties ; and 
send many a well-intentioned man, an ab- 
sentee to other countries, where property 
and life are secured on a more solid basis

than the impulses of passion, which madden 
into fury, or melt into regret, at the man- 
dates of the factious exciter of the day, who- 
ever he may happen to be. 
" How long have I defended these mis- 
guided people," said Mr. Desmond, " and 
maintained that good-treatment was all they 
required to render them good and happy ! 
What have I left undone? And yet they 
now turn from my counsel as if I had been 
the most negligent of all the absentee land- 
lords  nay, resent my offering them good ad- 
vice, as if it was an encroachment on their 
personal liberty. ' Divide and govern,' may 
well serve as the motto of the Repealers, 
for they have broken asunder all the ties of 
good-will between landlord and tenant; mu- 
tual confidence is destroyed, and their in- 
terests, which are and must be inseparable, 
now only seem as a chain, that holds toge-

termined to shut his eyes and his ears against 
conviction, who is prepared to deny that Ire- 
land has not had grievous cause for discon- 
tent ; but he must be equally blind, who does 
not see that the time and money frittered 
away in quelling the tumults, which have 
been the effects of a long period of misrule, 
might have done much towards removing the 
cavise, and that the persons who excite the 
violence of the people retard the ameliora-

derstand that their tranquillity and orderly con- 
duct will insure attention to their grievances, 
and consideration as to the means of redressing 
them ; and this instruction will do more towards 
opening their eyes to the folly of their vio- 
lence, than the most harsh though necessary

Ireland, who would use his influence over her 
excitable sons, in impressing on their minds 
a respect for the laws, and a horror for the 
acts of blood-stained cruelty that have so often 
sullied them. Such a man might be proud of 
his empire over them, when he could boast 
that he found his countrymen savages and left 
them men.

" Qui ne sent rien, parle a merveille ; 
Doutes d'un amant rerapli d'^sprit; 
C'est ton cceur, et non ton oieille, 
Qui doit ecouter ce qu'il dit." 
We left Colonel Forrester entering the bou- 
doir of Mrs. Desmond. He seated himself 
by Frances, who was engaged in copying a 
bouquet, placed in a vase on the table ; the 
flowers had been gathered that morning by 
Colonel Forrester, who presented them to 
Frances, and he felt flattered by observing 
the interest with which she was perpetuating 
their lovely hues on the paper before her.
## p. 134 (#142) ############################################
134 THE REPEALERS. 
" What a delightful and enviable talent you 
possess, Miss Desmond," said the Colonel, ** in 
thus being able to fix the evanescent beauty of 
those bright but frail flowers, and to retain 
the shadow when the substance shall have 
passed away. When I gathered them this 
morning, their leaves sparkling with dew, I 
thought how soon they must fade and wither, 
and that a few hours would behold them 
robbed of all their beauty. I did not think 
that I should see them transfixed on paper, 
as blooming and fair as when I culled them, 
and borrowing from your pencil an immor- 
tality that Nature has denied them. How ad- 
mirably you have coloured the petals of the 
rose ! it looks as if the next zephyr's breath 
might send it floating in the air  how I wish 
it was mine !"* 
The cheeks of Frances almost rivalled the 
rose she was copying, at this address, and

THE REPEALERS. 135 
became still more suffused when her mother 
replied, "I am sure Frances will have great 
pleasure in giving it to you." 
" Certainly," said Frances, " but it is hardly 
worth offering. I have some drawings that are 
better." 
" Oh ! no, let me have this," said Colonel 
Forrester ; " I prefer it to all others." 
A certain bashful consciousness betrayed that 
Frances knew why he preferred it. 
" I never," said Frances, " pluck a bouquet 
without a sort of melancholy feeling of how 
short must be the duration of the beauties 
that tempted me to make it mine. I believe 
this is a sentiment partaken of in common 
with every one who can feel ; for we find it 
expressed in all languages, and in all times ; 
and its generality deducts nothing from its 
truth. Nay, I rather think that it adds to 
its intensity, as in experiencing what has been

thought by so many, the bond of union that 
binds us to our species is strengthened, and 
we recognise the universal sympathy." 
" I remember," said Colonel Forrester, 
" having seen a beautiful Album in France, 
that was displayed to me as the ne plus 
ultra of sentimentality. It was entitled ' La 
Guirlande de Julie,'' and contained copies of 
the bouquets presented to her each day by 
her lover during his courtship. The flowers 
were elaborately painted by the first artists of 
the day, and the verses that accompanied them 
were quite as laboured ; those of the lover 
perhaps less so than the others, but still 
showing that the imagination had more share 
in the affair than the heart. Of all dis- 
plays, that of sentimentality is the one I 
feel the least disposed to pardon," continued 
Colonel Forrester, " because it shows a pre- 
meditation incompatible with real feeling.
## p. 137 (#145) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 137 
False sentiment affiches, but true sentiment 
betrays itself; and I am inclined to doubt 
whether the hymeneal wreath of Julie con- 
tained as gay flowers as those painted in the 
exotic garland ; and whether Le Due de Pen- 
thievre was not more formed for a lover than 
a husband. I remember an acquaintance of 
mine, a young Frenchman, who wore the 
ignoble chains of a Deesse de Theatre, and 
who, during the grande passion, collected the 
bouquets and guirlaiides showered on his fa- 
vourite every night that she acted, and pre- 
served them in an armoire. He displayed 
them to me, and seemed disappointed that 
I showed no sentiment on the occasion. To 
me they smelt of the lamps, and brought 
back set phrases, artificial looks, and an ap- 
plauding audience, whose plaudits stamped as 
public property that which a lover, to have 
any illusion, must wish to consider private ;

138 THE REPEALERS. 
and with such souvenirs, the withered flowers 
looked as meretricious as the goddess to whom 
they had been dedicated. The ' Guirlande de 
Julie,'' copied by paid hands, and the verses 
written by wit instead of passion, excited 
much the same feeling. Had the loved or the 
lover copied the flowers, then I would have 
owned the " soft impeachment ;" as it was, 
I felt impenetrable. But here am I talk- 
ing of flowers and sentiments when I ought 
to be endeavouring to forget both, as what 
makes me feel the charms of one and the 
other must be abandoned, for I must leave 
Springmount." 
" Leave Springmount !" exclaimed Frances, 
and her cheek lost its rosy hue ; " why, when 
do you go .^" Then, as if sensible of the feel- 
ing her abrupt questions betrayed, she added, 
" I hope you are not obliged to leave us so 
very soon."
## p. 139 (#147) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 139 
At this moment a servant entered, to an- 
nounce that Mr. Desmond wished to speak 
with Mrs. Desmond in the library. The 
lovers were left alone, and the heightened 
colour and agitated breathing of Frances 
showed how much she felt the delicacy and 
awkwardness of their position. Colonel For- 
rester detected all that was passing in her 
mind, and, with the intuitive tact that belongs 
to true passion, saw that he must be explicit, 
or else leave her under the mortifying convic- 
tion that she had revealed a preference un- 
sought by him who had excited it. 
To avow the sentiment she had inspired, and 
the motives that prevented his declaring them 
to her before, was the business of a few mi- 
nutes. With the candour and simplicity that 
marked all her actions and thoughts, Frances 
Desmond confessed that his avowal had given 
her pleasure, and that she believed her father

140 THE REPEALERS. 
and mother loved her too well to disapprove 
her choice. She added that she had never 
concealed a thought from them, and, therefore, 
wished that he should make them acquainted 
with his feelings. 
We will pass over all the lover-like raptures 
of Colonel Forrester, and the chastened delight 
with which Frances listened to them, until 
Mrs. Desmond entered, on which Frances hav- 
ing hastily retired, the lover opened the state 
of his heart to the mother of his beloved, and 
was listened to with nearly as much compla- 
cency as he had been by the daughter. 
A mother, who feels as a mother ought, 
hears the first avowal of a passion excited by 
her child, with much of the same trembling 
anxiety with which she heard the first declara- 
tion of love for herself. Her daughter is 
a dearer self; one in whom she sees her
## p. 141 (#149) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 141 
youth renewed. She has the same sensitive- 
ness for her, rendered more acute by expe- 
rience. The mingled feelings of pleasure at 
the admiration excited, and the anxiety for 
the future, with the always painful vista of 
separation, produce an agitation even more 
durable than that of the daughter. 
" Speak to my husband," said Mrs. Des- 
mond, " and if he approves, I can have no 
objection. I do not ask you to love my child, 
because I know it is unnecessary ; but I ask 
you, I implore you, never to forget that she 
has been an only, an idolized child, accustomed 
to be watched over, shielded, and cherished, 
and to whom unkindness is unknown." 
The affectionate warmth with which Colonel 
Forrester pressed the mother's hand to his lips, 
as he vowed that the happiness of her daughter 
should be his first, his most precious care, car-

ried balm to the heart of Mrs. Desmond, and 
she felt that in giving her daughter to this 
excellent young man, she lost not her, but 
gained a son. 
There is no occasion in human life which 
furnishes a better criterion for judging a fami- 
ly, than that of the marriage of a daughter. 
The mother who sees her child about to leave 
the home of her childhood, the happy scene of 
her infancy, without feeling anxiety and dread, 
and without endeavouring to attach to her by 
links of love the new found son on whom the 
future happiness of her child is to depend, 
must possess little of the sentiments that a 
mother ought to have ; and the daughter who 
can leave the home of her happy, careless, 
infancy, the mother who watched over her, and 
the sisters who shared her pastimes, without 
a tender regret, and without endeavouring to

THE REPEALERS. 14S 
excite in the breast of her future husband a 
portion of the affection she feels for those dear 
relations, must have a character that promises 
but little for the discharge of the duties she is 
about to undertake. In such circumstances 
the husband has no reason to be proud of the 
cheerfulness with which he is followed to the 
nuptial home. 
Colonel Forrester met with nearly as tender 
a hearing from the father as had been accorded 
to him by the mother of his beloved ; but Mr. 
Desmond made his consent conditional on his 
quitting the army. " A married soldier I 
never could approve of," said the good old 
gentleman, " as I am of the old opinion that 
* Cupid may wear a red coat, but Hymen 
never."* Under such circumstances, a man 
must be a bad husband or a bad soldier; 
the duties of both are incompatible, and I

will not have my son-in-law either. There- 
fore, my dear young friend, the army must 
be given up." 
If such a proposition had been made to 
Colonel Forrester before he had known Frances 
Desmond, he would have felt it as an insult ; 
but, as the condition of being blessed with 
her hand, he hesitated not a moment in acced- 
ing to it ; and, accompanied by Mr. Desmond, 
he sought the boudoir, to announce to Mrs. 
Desmond the consent of her husband. This 
time he was not content with simply pressing 
his lips to the hand of his future mother, but 
pressed them to the cheek, and a happier group 
could not be found than the boudoir now 
contained. Frances was summoned to partake 
the general joy, and the tears from her eyes 
that bedewed the cheeks of her parents, had 
no bitterness in them, as, alternately pressed in 
their arms, they embraced her again and again.
## p. 145 (#153) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 145 
It was decided that Mr. Desmond should not 
set out for Dublin until next day, and Colonel 
Forrester wanted but little persuasion to post- 
pone his departure for head-quarters until the 
same moment. 
My readers must imagine all that persons 
under such circumstances are likely to feel. 
Those who have been similarly placed, have 
only to exercise the powers of memory ; and 
those who have yet to experience the position, 
must endeavour to picture it in their minds. 
Whether the former or the latter are most 
likely to draw a just notion of the feelings 
of the lovers, is not for us to decide ; inas- 
much as the result will be influenced in pro- 
portion as memory or imagination happens 
to be most powerful in such as depend on 
the agency of those faculties. For ourselves, 
we lean to imagination, and, therefore, have 
formed in our mind's eye, a brilliant tableau

of this happy day at Springmount ; but, like 
all days, happy or unhappy, it finished at 
about the usual hour. 
There are some people whom it is difficult 
to convince of the even tenour of the march 
of time. These sceptics are the happy and 
the unhappy. The first believe that he gal- 
lops, and the second are convinced that he 
crawls; and it is only those who are neither 
exalted nor depressed, that can really judge 
of his paces. If we gave our opinion on 
this momentous point, it would furnish a clue 
to the inquisitive, for guessing to which class 
we belong ; and as we neither wish to excite 
envy, by being supposed to belong to the 
happy sceptics, or pity (because v^^e like not 
pity) by being considered among the unhappy, 
we will even leave it to others to decide 
" who time ambles withal, who time trots

epicures. ' Now,' says Mr. O'Blarney, ' we 
are served like the poor geese at Perigord 
(I think he called it). We are put before the 
fire of bad treatment, and forced to gulp 
down the salt of hard usage, 'till our hearts 
become too big for our bodies, and then we 
are hung, or transported, or imprisoned, to 
cure our complaints.' Sure, Grace, this was 
very moving; it dhrew tears from many of 
the people, though that foolish boy. Bill Mul-

louny, began to laugh, and said he'd never see 
a goose without thinking of the Repalers.''"' 
Grace, though little disposed to smile at the 
moment, could not resist yielding to the im- 
pulse, and Jim looked at her with a face of 
seriousness that indicated he thought the 
smile little short of profanation, so impressed 
was he with the pathetic imagery in the speech 
of O'Blarney. 
" Sure, Grace, these are no times for laugh- 
ing," said Jim, " when the whole counthry is 
up, and determined to have justice. Sure 
we're carrying everything before us; all tlie 
elections are in our favour, and ther'U be more 
Irishmen and Catholics, ay, be my soul, 
and Repalers too, in the Parliament in Eng- 
land, than of our enemies ; and as every rale 
Irishman can make a speech out of nothing, 
whereas them English are mighty sparing of 
their words, and come out with 'em only as

they do with their guineas, when they think 
they are really wanted, sure we '11 bother 'em 
entirely, and dhrive 'em out of the place; 
they '11 be so tired of hearing all the Repal- 
ing members speechifying one after another 
in the rich elegant brogue of the poor ould 
counthry. And then sure, if the English mem- 
bers say a word against us, haven't we plenty 
of our own friends that will tell 'em they '11 
talk to 'em in another place? which manes 
they '11 be for offering 'em gunpowder tay, 
and sugar a lead for their breakfasts, which 
they '11 not like to take, for the English are 
not half so fond of fighting as we are, in a 
sociable way, and think people can raison 
without pistols, which, after all, every Irish 
gentleman knows is the argument that hits 
oftenest. Then they '11 not like to be made 
cry, when our speechifiers comes over 'em 
with all the melting mournful descriptions of

our slavery ; and they ""ll soon be glad to join 
all together, and ax the King to let us have 
a parliament of our own in Dublin, for sake 
of peace and quietness, and to get rid of us. 
What a blessing it is for me to be able to 
read the newspaper down at the Cat and Bag- 
pipes, and so know all they say in the Par- 
liament ! though I must say Mr. O'Blarney, 
long may he live to reign over us ! didn't 
spake half so elegantly in London as he 
does in the ould counthry ; but I suppose he 
thought that giving 'em the same fine words 
he gives us, would be throwing pearls before 
swine, for they haven't the gumption to un- 
derstand 'em. 
" That man might do anything with us, 
Grace," continued Jim, " every word he says 
makes the heart beat quicker ; sure, I've heard 
Tom Jeffreys, that was in Portugal with the 
cavalry, say, that when they were going into

battle, and that many of 'em felt a little quare, 
the sound of the trumpets roused up their cou- 
rage, and the very horses became impatient to 
rush into action, such a power had that music 
on man and baist. Now, this is the effect that 
CBlarney's speeches have on us : we go to 
hear him, half inclined to go no more, talked 
over against it by landlords, fathers, mothers, 
and wives ; but before he has' spoken half an 
hour, ay ! be my troth ten minutes, it 's all 
over with us : the heart begins to thump 
against the side, the chest begins to heave 
up as if it hadn't half room, one gets hot 
and could fits by turns, that rush up to the 
ver}^ roots of the hair, and landlords, fathers, 
mothers, and wives, are no more thought of 
than if they never were in the world. He 
might lead us to death that very minute; we'd 
face the mouth of a cannon, and glory in every 
danger, while his words are tingling in our

ears ; but when we come home, and see the 
friends we love unhappy, and a wife like your- 
self, dear Grace, looking pale and sorrowful, 
all the grand thoughts he put into our 
heads go clean out of 'em ; and when we thry 
to remember them, it's all like a throubled 
dream, and one feels quite tired and low-spi- 
rited, and cross-like, just as I used to feel the 
morning after I had taken the wicked whisky, 
out of humour with myself and all the world. 
Sure, I wish the King of England would make 
O'Blarney King of Ireland, for then "'twould 
be his interest to keep us all quiet and da- 
cent, and as he can do what he likes with 
us, 'twould be as aisy for him to make us 
orderly as to make us what we are, and the 
families at home would be satisfied, and we 
wouldn't be argufying as we all now are 
always doing, more's the pity. 
" Sure, Grace," Jim continued, after a short

pause, " the power that a man like O'Blarney 
can gain over hundreds and thousands of his 
fellow-creatures, is almost like witchcraft, and 
the more one thinks of it, the more wonderful 
it appears. His words stir up thoughts and 
feelings that were sleeping in the mind, and 
that are as obedient to his call as are the 
soldiers called out on the parade as I saw at 
Dungarvan. And then to think that this 
power, this mighty power, comes not from 
wealth, from station, or from anything but the 
strength of master thoughts, and big words, 
which have greater power than flaming swords, 
and can madden or melt; it's a quare thing, 
Grace, and we can no more account for it than 
we can explain why some music, and some 
perfumes, work our feelings into joy or sad- 
ness, bringing back pleasant or bitter thoughts, 
over which we have no control." 
" I believe, Jim dear," said Grace, " that it

156 THE REPEALERS. 
is because we all have in our hearts some 
feelings that remain quietly there, until they 
are touched by some one who knows how to 
play on 'em. Look at the pipes that Kernes 
Fitzpatrick can make send out the most sweet 
and doleful tunes, until the hearts of those that 
hear them are as soft and dismal as themselves, 
and seem to sigh back an echo to every note ; 
and then hear him play the * Foxhunter's 
Jigg,' the ' Moddhoreen Rhu,' or any of the 
hundred wild, joyous, frolicksome tunes he 
gives us ; and one forgets every melancholy 
thought, and is ready to jump out of one's 
very skin for gladness. If his notes didn't find 
some notes in our hearts that answered 'em, 
'twould be quite another guess thing ; and so 
it is with Mr. O'Blarney  he awakens up the 
sleeping thoughts, but, och ! Jim, he only 
awakens to intoxicate 'em, and uses the gift of 
God, big and burning words, to scorch those

he plays Vm off on, I don't like to say I 
detest him, Jim, because it 's a hard word to 
come from a woman's lips ; but when I think 
of the good he might do, and the harm he 
does, sure I think he 's for all the world like a 
comet, bright and flaming, that all gaze on, but 
that all dread to come too near." 
" Who ever lived, Grace a-vourneen, so mane 
and chicken-hearted, as not to feel his spirit 
rise at the fine word ' Liberty,' and his cheek 
grow red with shame at the word ' Slave ?' 
These are the words with which O'Blarney 
can madden us, for our hearts understand 'em, 
though our heads do not ; and often 's the time 
that my poor head is all in a cumfluster, when 
I can't tell what I mane or what I wish, except 
that I would die for liberty, and kill him who 
would enslave me. There 's two kind of senses 
the sense of the head, which is all for money 
and prudence, and the sense of the heart.
## p. 158 (#166) ############################################

which is all for liberty and love. They never 
are good friends together, and troth, I believe 
few Irishmen have much share of the first, 
though they have so much of the second. Peo- 
ple say of a man he has a sensible head, but 
they never say he has a sensible heart." 
" And how could they, Jim dear ?" said 
Grace, " seeing as how if the heart was sen- 
sible, it would not act so as to vex itself, and 
you must allow that those who follow what 
they call liberty, generally soon take leave of 
love. Liberty, according to my notion, Jim, is 
something so fine, so pure, and holy, that it 
couldn't burn in a heart without making it 
better ; and all the sins and crimes that are com- 
mitted in its name, only prove to me that they 
who commit 'em are guilty of two great 
crimes, those of falseness, and throwing a bad 
repute on what ought to be free from stain. I 
can fancy dying, or slaying in the field of bat-

tie, felling, or falling with a thousand wounds, 
to preserve one's country, one's family, or one's 
honour; but to commit murders on poor 
wretches who cannot defend themselves, to 
burn, to destroy, and say that such base crimes 
are in the cause of liberty  och ! Jim, it 's a 
sin and a shame, and he who rouses you with 
the name, leaves you to worship a blood- 
stained shadow, instead of teaching you to 
adore the purest of all feelings, and one that 
never gan make her dwelling but in noble 
hearts that turn from cruelty and crime. He 
leads ye with the name, but leaves ye in 
ignorance of the substance."

CHAPTER XIV. 
" It is an easy and a vulgar thing to please the mob, 
and not a very arduous thing to astonish them ; but essen- 
tially to benefit and to improve them, is a work fraught 
with difficulty, and teeming with danger." 
V." 
On arriving in Dublin, Mr. Desmond waited 
on the Secretary, and met the ready attention 
which his own high character so well deserved. 
He found Mr. Manly the enlightened and intel- 
ligent gentleman he had been led to expect, 
deeply impressed with the alarming state of the 
country, and truly anxious to tranquillize it by 
every means in his power. While doing justice 
to the statesmanlike views of the Secretary, and
## p. 161 (#169) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 161 
the unbending honesty with which he pursued 
the line marked out by duty, though thereby 
exposing himself to the unjust odium of popular 
clamour,  heaped on him by those who could 
not, or would not, render justice to the purity 
of his motives, or the firmness and ability with 
which he resisted intimidation,  Mr. Desmond 
was forced to admit that it was peculiarly unfor- 
tunate, that, at such a crisis, the person placed 
in so arduous a situation united not a more 
conciliatory manner to the various solid and 
excellent qualities that adorned him. 
The coldness and hauteur of Mr. Manly 's 
manner, lent a sternness and severity to ob- 
servations which, if made in a more good- 
natured tone, might have had a less repul- 
sive effect on his hearers. Cest Fair qui fait 
le chanson, is an old phrase that one was 
perpetually reminded of when listening to him, 
for the matter of his observations on Ireland
## p. 162 (#170) ############################################
162 THE REPEALERS. 
had nothing harsh or unkind ; on the contrary, 
it was dispassionate and full of forbearance; 
but the manner was cold and repulsive. 
Mr. Desmond had mixed too much with the 
world, not to make ample allowance for the 
Jierie of a naturally proud and noble mind, 
at finding itself for the first time opposed to 
elements so jarring and uncongenial as those 
which constituted the minds of the greater part 
of the persons with whom Mr. Manly was 
brought in contact in Ireland. The habits 
of strict veracity, so indispensable in the cha- 
racter of a gentleman in England, peculiarly 
unfit him for looking with a lenient eye on 
the habitual disregard to truth that candour 
compels us to own is one of the characteristic 
and besetting sins of Ireland : hence a consti- 
tutional coldness and hauteur on the part of 
the high-born Secretary, had been increased 
by his continually witnessing the misrepresen-
## p. 163 (#171) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 163 
tations, wilful or unintentional, of those who 
approached him ; but it soon wore off when he 
found himself with persons on whose assertions 
he could place faith. 
From the Castle, Mr. Desmond proceeded to 
the Lodge at the Phoenix Park, the summer 
residence of the Lord Lieutenant, where he re- 
ceived a most kind and cordial reception from 
the Viceroy. It would have been difficult, if 
not impossible, to have found a nobleman in 
England more calculated to fill with distinc- 
tion the high situation to which he was ap- 
pointed in Ireland, than the Marquis of Mona. 
Brave to a proverb, frank, generous, and un- 
suspicious, he was the very heau ideal of chi- 
valry. To the gallant bearing of a soldier he 
united the Jiertc of aristocracy, softened down 
by high breeding and grace of manner, as 
peculiar as it was captivating. Mr. Desmond 
had long known and learned to estimate his
## p. 164 (#172) ############################################
164 THE REPEALERS. 
noble qualities, and, as was the case with all 
who approached the Viceroy, the frankness of his 
demeanour, gained on the confidence of the fine 
old man, who listened with pleased attention to 
the animated and feeling representations of the 
Marquis ; all of which only served to convince 
him more strongly of that which he had never 
allowed his mind to doubt  the warm and deep 
interest the Lord Lieutenant entertained fcr 
the country he governed. 
A greater proof of the wish of the English 
Government to conciliate Ireland, could hardly 
be given than in selecting as her Viceroy a 
nobleman so calculated to charm the sym- 
pathies of the people. In this spirit was he 
received, and wherever he publicly appeared, 
his presence was hailed with an universal en- 
thusiasm, until defamation propagated a thou- 
sand slanders, which every action of his, if 
properly viewed, must have refuted, but which 
it was too much the interest of the propagators
## p. 165 (#173) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 165 
to keep alive ; so that he who was formed to be 
the idol of the enthusiastic, warm-hearted, and 
generous nation he was sent to rule, was held 
up to them as the betrayer of their interests  
one whom they were neither to trust nor to love. 
When Mr. Desmond v^^as made acquainted 
with the multiplied and conflicting reports of 
the state of the country sent up to the Castle, 
he no longer marvelled at the impossibility of 
the Irish Government being able to arrive at 
just conclusions, and, consequently, to apply 
remedies. The statements sent from his own 
county alone were so various and contradictory, 
that on perusing them, he almost doubted the 
evidence of his senses. 
Each reporter viewed, or at least repre- 
sented, the state of affairs through the me- 
dium of his own political feelings and pre- 
judices. An ultra Tory Lord wrote that 
the country was in open rebellion. Anarchy 
and confusion reigned around ; the Church

166 THE REPEALERS. 
was in danger ; and the Protestant ascen- 
dancy tottering. All this (as was more than 
insinuated by the writer) proceeded from the 
impolitic measure of granting the Catholics 
emancipation, and not compelling the strong 
body of the people of Ireland to bow to the 
supremacy of the weak. Tiie Irish Govern- 
ment were reproached indirectly with their ill- 
judged lenity, and an air of triumphant self- 
complacency at the shrewdness and superior 
judgment of the writer, pervaded what was 
meant to be a true and impartial statement of 
evils, the source of which he was more anxious 
to attribute to the Government than to remedy. 
Party feeling, narrow prejudices, and illiberal 
sentiments, marked every line of the Orange 
Lord's sapient epistle ; all that he reported seem- 
ed tinged with the atrabilarious hue of his own 
politics ; and Mr. Desmond finished its perusal 
with disgust, to look over the report of a liberal 
county member.
## p. 167 (#175) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 167 
Here again disappointment awaited him. 
Instead of a simple statement of facts, he 
found a recapitulation of motives, all coloured 
with the glowing tints of the writer''s imagina- 
tion, and evidently painted with a view to pro- 
duce a scenic effect at some future election. 
The tyranny of Protestants who, forsooth, had 
the audacity to protect their rights and proper- 
ties, was dwelt on with unmitigated censure; 
and Mr. Desmond, on perusing the inflated 
detail, seriously wished that an attentive study 
of ^' Crabbers Synonymes" might be recom- 
mended to the Irish gentlemen to be laid on 
their tables, with " Burn's Justice's Guide," 
as some restraint on their powers of hyper- 
bole. 
The statement of the liberal was laid by, with 
opinions similar to those which had been ex- 
cited by the perusal of the ultra Tory's report ; 
and Mr. Desmond felt a sentiment of increased 
admiration mingle with the respect due to those

168 THE REPEALERS. 
distinguished members of the English aristo- 
cracy, who could consent to leave their happy 
and civilized country, their tranquil homes, 
and agreeable habits of life and society, to 
accept the office of viceroy in a semi-barbarous 
kingdom, torn by factions, where the wisdom 
of the serpent, the courage of the lion, and the 
peacefulness of the dove, would be powerless 
when opposed to people determined to ruin 
their country for the mere gratification of 
wreaking a mutual and individual vengeance. 
Mr. Desmond failed not to impress on*the 
Lord Lieutenant^s mind, that the statements he 
had read were founded in error, and that the 
mass of the r-^ople were but as tools in the 
hands of those who wielded them for their own 
selfish and interested purposes. " Deprive 
such hands of power, my Lord," said he, " and 
their weapons become useless ; but if, as 
hitherto, the people are punished for the crimes

THE REPEALERS. 169 
of those who lead them into danger, and then 
evade responsibility, little progress is made in 
staying the evil that has been undermining- 
Ireland for years. As well might the combus- 
tible materials that spread conflagration be 
considered the cause of the flames, instead of 
the incendiary who applied the torch to them, 
as the misguided, impetuous, warm-hearted 
peasantry be condemned for the excesses to 
which they have been led by the artful and 
designing men who make a merchandize of the 
very qualities that are but the exuberance of a 
too rich soil, and traffic with the excited pas- 
sions of those ductile people. The more I 
love my country, my Lord, and pity its de- 
luded peasantry, the more I loathe those who 
lead them like victims to the sacrifice."

CHAPTER XV. 
" If those alone who ' sowed the wind did reap the 
whirlwind/ it would be well. But the mischief is, that 
the blindness of bigotry, the madness of ambition, and the 
miscalculations of diplomacy, seek their victims principally 
amongst the innocent and the unoffending. The cottage is 
sure to suffer for every error of the court, the cabinet, or 
the camp." 
Mr. Desmond found the Lord Lieutenant 
and Secretary so disposed to try every effort of 
conciliation before they called in the strong 
arm of power, that he thought it his duty to 
impress on them the utter hopelessness of such 
measures.

THE REPEALERS. 171 
" The country is now, my lord, in that 
state," said he, " that the people must be 
taught to fear the laws before they can respect 
them ; and, unhappily, conciliation in the pre- 
sent moment would be more likely to be viewed 
as a proof of the weakness than of the kindness 
of the Government. There is no protection 
for person or for property. Who can count 
for twenty-four hours on a people whom an 
inflated speech from an agitator may send forth 
to use physically the firebrands he has been 
morally scattering abroad ? Is it to be borne 
with, that any man is to be allowed the volcanic 
power of rocking a whole kingdom to its cen- 
tre, whenever he chooses to send forth his man- 
dates ? No, my lord ; were an individual to be 
found who could use such power wisely and 
moderately, never wielding it but for the be- 
nefit of his countrymen, even then, it would be 
dangerous and unwise to permit his retention 
I 2

of it. Such precedents are full of danger ; 
they offer an opportunity to every political ad- 
venturer to elevate himself on the ruins of his 
country. Tranquillize Ireland, what becomes 
of its agitators ? They know that they must 
sink into comparative insignificance ; and rather 
would they make a funeral pile of the kingdom, 
and consume themselves on it, than willingly 
abandon '' the fearful and dizzy height" to 
which they have elevated themselves at the 
expense of their country. The people are 
proud of the Colossus they have reared ; they 
admire their own strength, as displayed in sup- 
porting this proof of its unhealthy exuberance, 
but the moment that strength is directed to 
useful and profitable purposes, they will see 
their past delusion, and abandon their errors." 
Mr. Desmond was invited to dine at the 
Phoenix Park, and while partaking the hos- 
pitality of the Viceroy, was pleased to see

THE REPEALERS. 173 
assembled round his splendid board all the 
rank and talent that Dublin could boast. The 
polished urbanity of the noble host, the ami- 
able politeness of his high-born - and high-bred 
wife, and the interesting group of young people 
around them, whose attentions to their father's 
guests were as delicate as they were judicious, 
were highly gratifying to a mind like Mr. Des- 
mond'^s, who felt that all he saw was indica- 
tive of the cordial good will, and spirit of 
conciliation, which had marked the conduct of 
the gallant and generous Viceroy from the mo- 
ment of his touching Irish ground ; and he 
mentally execrated the pernicious counsels that 
would pervert the people, or induce them to 
wish to dissolve the bond of union that linked 
them to a country which could send such ex- 
amples of all that was most excellent amongst 
them. 
Before leaving the Lodge, Mr. DesmoL J could

not refrain from expressing the pleasure he 
should feel, if the Marquis and Marchioness of 
Mona made a tour through the South of Ire- 
land, and honoured Springmount with their 
presence. 
While acknowledging the hospitality and 
politeness of the invitation, the gallant Mar- 
quis declined it, and Mr. Desmond felt that 
delicacy and tact dictated the refusal. Had 
the Viceroy undertaken a tour, it must have 
been made with something of '' the pomp and 
circumstance" of regal splendour. All the 
great houses passed by without a visit, even 
though a visit was unsought, would become 
focuses of discontent, around which the satel- 
lites of each would rally ; and to prevent this, 
the Lord Lieutenant declined many an invi- 
tation where his presence could not have failed 
to excite affection and good-will. 
Unhappy is the country whose ruler is
## p. 175 (#183) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 175 
forced to such self-denial, and unhappy the peo- 
ple who are deprived of ocular demonstration 
of the qualities of him to whom their desti- 
nies are confided, and whom they only know 
through the medium of misrepresentation ! 
Mr. Desmond left Dublin next day, being 
most anxious to join his family, and feeling 
that the present was not a time to leave them 
to the tender mercies of the misguided pea- 
santry in the country. He travelled rapidly, 
and observed with inquietude the groups of 
idle gloomy-looking persons that were loiter- 
ing around the inns in all the towns where 
he changed horses, and who examined him with 
curious eyes, as if they expected some exciting 
intelligence. 
On drawing nearer home, he was surprised 
to find that he was no longer welcomed by 
the animated salutations, and reiterated pro- 
fessions of affection, with which the people
## p. 176 (#184) ############################################
176 THE REPEALERS. 
had been wont to receive him. His carriage 
being recognized, a respectful, but cold un- 
covering of the head, was the only notice given 
to him. 
*' Poor unhappy people !" thought Mr. Des- 
mond, " it is thus you always repay those who 
are your best, your truest friends. When will 
you learn to distinguish between the egotistical 
political speculators who use you as their tools, 
and those who would honestly and honourably 
serve you ? You murdered a Mountjoy, a 
kind, a noble, and true friend; and you in- 
sulted and would have destroyed a Grattan, 
whose genius, whose patriotism, threw a halo 
over his country." 
The recollection of the two persons whose 
memories he had invoked, brought sadness to 
the heart of Mr. Desmond. The Lord Mount- 
joy had been the friend of his early youth, and 
was the model on which he had formed him-

THE REPEALERS, 177 
self. The chivalrous sense of honour, the love 
of literature and of the fine arts, and above 
all, the devotion to his country, which distin- 
guished that amiable and beloved nobleman, 
had endeared him to all who knew him ; but 
by Mr. Desmond,  who had been the companion 
of his travels in Italy, and who, though many 
years his junior, had learned to appreciate his 
noble qualities,  he had ever been revered as a 
bright example of virtue, whose tragic death, 
met at the hands of those whose interests his 
life had been spent in upholding, was never 
remembered but with sorrow and with bit- 
terness. Grattan, great, good, and glorious 
Grattan, whose genius was only equalled by 
his honesty, whose long and honourable life 
was passed in advocating the cause of freedom, 
but who, while worshipping the pure flame of 
liberty, turned with honest disgust from the 
destroying fire of licence. 
I 5

178 THE REPEALERS. 
"' And can it be," thought Mr. Desmond, 
'' that this fickle, this ungrateful people, can 
forget the pure idol they worshipped, to set 
up in its stead the man of law, who can cal- 
culate how far democracy can safely go, and 
where ends the line of demarcation between 
ao'itation and treason ?" 
Such thoughts were indeed bitter. Mr. Des- 
mond dwelt on the hopes of his youth, when 
he had looked forward to seeing his country 
emerge from the dark cloud that overshadowed 
it, and, emulating England, make rapid strides 
to civilization. How had those hopes been 
frustrated !  Whig and Tory Governments had 
alternately applied themselves to redressing the 
evils under which she groaned for centuries, 
but had applied themselves in vain ; and now, 
after yielding emancipation, which had been 
considered as the panacea that was to heal 
every disease, and all parties concluded that

tranquillity would be established, a new ignis 
fatuus sprang up to mislead this reckless peo- 
ple, and conduct them to the very verge of utter 
ruin. Thus, in his declining life, Mr. Desmond 
endured that bitter infliction for a patriotic 
spirit ;  the misery of witnessing the civiliza- 
tion and happiness of his unfortunate country 
retrograding much more rapidly than he had 
ever seen them advance.

CHAPTER XVI. 
" Adieu for him 
The dull engagements of the bustling world ! 
Adieu the sick impertinence of praise, 
And hope, and action ! for with her alone, 
By streams and shades to steal these sighing hours 
Is all he asks, and all that fate can give !" 
When Colonel Forrester returned to Water- 
ford, he found that the few days which had 
elapsed during his absence, had been marked 
by fresh riots, tumultuous meetings, and resist- 
ance to the laws. On sending his resignation 
to the War Office, he regretted the being 
obliged to withdraw his services at a crisis
## p. 181 (#189) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 181 
which threatened to require them. But his pro- 
mise was pledged, and he felt that under the 
circumstances of his present engagement, his 
first duty was to attend to the happiness of his 
future wife and that of her parents, which hap- 
piness, he was decidedly of opinion, could only 
be secured by their fixing their residence in 
England. 
His brother officers heard that they were to 
lose Colonel Forrester with deep regret, for he 
was as universally as he was deservedly be- 
loved and respected in his regiment. The few 
days that must pass ere he could receive the 
acceptance of his resignation, he determined to 
remain at head quarters ; but he daily dispatch- 
ed a servant with letters to Springmount, and 
thence, in return, received tidings fraught with 
affection. 
An authority, whom to doubt would be 
profanation, has said that " the course of true

182 THE REPEALERS. 
love never did run smooth ;" and, according to 
all received usage, we have committed an un- 
usual solecism in allowing our hero and heroine 
to meet, love, and become affianced lovers, with- 
out any of the usual obstacles that intervene 
on such occasions. Yet, they loved not the less 
ardently because no such obstacles had occur- 
red ; and had the father of the heroine been a 
domestic tyrant, who refused to listen to the 
pleadings of affection, and forbade the lover the 
sight of his daughter, they could not be more 
anxious or impatient to meet again. 
'' What !" exclaims one of my female read- 
ers, " when there was neither risk nor difficulty 
in the meeting ? no mother to be deceived, and 
no father to be outwitted ?"" 
It is even so, kind and gentle reader, but 
then, remember, that Frances Desmond resem- 
bled in nought, save in beauty, a heroine of 
romance, according to the received notions
## p. 183 (#191) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 183 
of such a personage ; and that her lover as 
little resembled a hero, except in being hand- 
some, brave, and in love. Nay we must add, 
that the certainty that Colonel Forrester's pre- 
sence would be hailed with delight by her pa- 
rents, increased the pleasure and impatience 
with which Frances looked forward to his ar- 
rival ; and after this confession, she must forfeit 
all claims to the distinction of a heroine. 
The attachment between Frances and her 
parents seemed to have become more tender 
since she had been affianced to Colonel Forres- 
ter. It was as though she was desirous of 
proving to them that the new sentiment she 
experienced, a sentiment considered to super- 
sede and engross all others, had not diminished 
her affection for them, while they felt all the 
bonds of love drawn still more closely, as they 
contemplated the possibility and probability of 
a separation from their cliild.

184 THE REPEALERS. 
They had always wished to make her resi- 
dence with them a condition of her marriage ; 
but delicacy, and a fear of being thought to 
dictate to a son-in-law whose inferior fortune 
rendered the marriage in some degree unequal, 
restrained them from expressing their wishes, 
and Frances having never for a moment con- 
templated the possibility of leaving her father 
and mother, the subject was un-named, though 
it occupied all the thoughts of the doting pa- 
rents, and filled their eyes with tears whenever 
they dwelt on their child, and thought of her 
being taken from them. 
This was the only alloy to their happiness, 
the only drop of bitterness in their cup. But 
so it is ever, even with the happiest  some care 
or fear will always arise to throw a cloud over 
what otherwise might be too bright for our im- 
perfect natures. 
To a practical knowledge of the world, that 
is in no school more readily acquired than in

the army. Colonel Forrester united an affec- 
tionate disposition, and deep tenderness of na- 
ture, which that school too often tends to 
blunt. Left an orphan at an early age, the 
sole protector of a lovely young sister, he had 
assiduously supplied the place of the parents 
they had lost, until he had the happiness of be- 
stowing her hand, where she had already given 
her heart, on a young nobleman of amiable dis- 
position, cultivated mind, and large fortune. 
His attachment to his sister had prepared his 
heart for the passionate one that now engross- 
ed it, and fond anticipations of the friendship 
he hoped to cement between his future wife 
and that dear sister, were mingled in all his 
aspirations of the future. 
" Frances is precisely the person formed to 
be chosen as the friend of my dear sister," said 
Colonel Forrester often to himself; " and Louisa 
is sure to be loved, as soon as she is known." 
Every man who has a favourite sister, and

186 THE REPEALERS. 
is in love, has entertained a similar thought; 
but how few have realized the agreeable visions 
they have indulged ! Sisters-in-law are apt to 
view each other, not through the flattering 
optics of the husband and brother, but through 
the microscopic ones of female rivalry; and, 
being thrown more frequently into close con- 
tact with each other than with other female 
friends, defects are discovered that might have 
escaped detection in less near connexions. A 
sister has been accustomed to be the first per- 
son in a brother's estimation, and even a good 
one will feel something more of the woman than 
of the sister rising in her breast, when she is 
told by her brother, what brothers are too apt 
to tell, that her new relative is " the loveliest, 
wisest, virtuousest, best," of all her sex, with- 
out the enraptured panegyrist having the fra- 
ternal grace to make even one solitary exception 
for the hitherto idolized sister. 
Colonel Forrester, however, knew his sister
## p. 187 (#195) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 187 
well ; and therefore could without danger of 
disappointment, reckon on the affection which 
an acquaintance between her and his future 
wife could not fail to produce ; and in this 
conviction, felt the strongest impatience to 
make them mutually known. 
In writing to acquaint Lady Oriel of his 
approaching marriage, he gave so graphic a 
portrait of his betrothed, that she learned 
to love, even without having seen, her future 
sister ; and knowing the acute judgment of 
her brother, which not even love could have 
blinded, she felt persuaded that the picture 
was not too flattering. 
In his letters to Lady Oriel he poured forth 
his whole soul, as she had often done to him, 
when dwelhng on her wedded happiness, and 
he wrote, 
" To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou sayes 
Leads up to heaven, is both the way and guide." 
Family affections are our consolations for the

18S THE REPEALERS. 
coldness and indifference of the world ; and the 
tie that unites a brother and sister, formed in 
infanc}^ and strengthened in youth, becomes 
indissoluble in maturity. No friendship form- 
ed in after-age can have the same charm. 
This is identified with our happiest days, has 
grown with our growth and strengthened with 
our strength, until it has become a part of our 
very being. 
" Like twining streams both from one fountain fell, 
And as they ran still mingled smiles and tears." 
The difference of sex, in this relation, adds 
to the strength of the affection. As fathers 
love their daughters better than sons, and 
mothers love their sons better than daughters, 
so do sisters feel towards brothers a more con- 
stant sentiment of attachment than towards each 
other. None of the little vanities, heart-burn- 
ings, and jealousies, that, alas for poor human 
nature ! are but too apt to spring up in female

THE REPEALERS. 189 
hearts, can arise between brother and sister ; 
each is proud of the success of the other, be- 
cause it cannot interfere with self  nay, on 
the contrary, is flattering to self. Hence, if 
there be a bond of family union more free 
from all the selfish blots that interrupt all 
others, it is that which exists between an affec- 
tionate sister and brother. 
Colonel Forrester almost doubted the reahty 
of the happiness prepared for him. It seemed 
too great, too perfect, to last. The letters of 
Frances breathed affection, pure and spotless as 
herself; her dear father and mother were con- 
tinually referred to in them as being as impa- 
tient as herself for his return, and sentiments of 
pious gratitude mingled in every expression of 
chastened, maidenly tenderness, that escaped 
from her pen. 
" I shall love Springmount more than ever, 
now that I know you, dearest, are to pass your

life here with me," wrote Frances Desmond. 
" My father and mother are planning a thou- 
sand improvements and embellishments, to be 
carried on under your inspection. You are up- 
permost in every project for the future, and 
occupy us all so continually, that our love for 
you seems a new bond of union bet\veen us, 
and we wonder how we were happy before we 
knew you. But no, we were not happy, we 
were only content, and a few weeks have 
proved to us how vast is the distance between 
happiness and content. How delightful it is 
to hear my father and mother always talking 
of you ! but you have no one to speak to 
you of your Frances."

CHAPTER XVII. 
" Nous qui sommes bornees en tout, comment le sommes 
nous si peu quand 11 s'aglt de souffrir." 
Grace Cassidy was sitting by the expiring 
embers of her fire on a Sunday night, filled 
with melancholy reflections, called up by re- 
collections of the past and dread of the future, 
excited by her weak-minded husband's per- 
severance in following the dictates of the 
agitators, when Larry M'Swigger entered her 
cottage. 
" I 'm just come to ax you if you can let 
me have a bed this blessed night, Mistress

Cassidy ?" said Larry. " Indeed and troth I 
wouldn't be for throubling you, but that the 
Cat and Bagpipes, where I had engaged a bed, 
is no fit place for a quiet man,  such goings 
on ! such rhaumish and disputing ! such knock- 
ing the tables with their fists ! such flourishing 
of shillelahs, singing, crying, and cursing !  
that I wouldn't stay there, and stole away to 
come and ax you to let me have a place to lie 
down." 
Grace consented to arrange a bed for Larry, 
because she felt that she could not, without an 
appearance of inhospitality unknown amongst 
the Irish of her class, refuse him ; but the 
duties of hospitality were never so unwillingly 
performed by her as at this moment, as Larry 
would now be made a witness of her husband's 
late hours, for which she could offer no excuse ; 
and with the sensitiveness of womanly love 
she shrank from having his errors exposed.

THE REPEALERS. 193 
" Sure, these are quare times, Mistress Cas- 
sidy," said Larry, " to see the grand gentle- 
men of the country hardly so much as men- 
tioned, and all the tag, rag, and bobtail, set 
up as laiders. Faith, it reminds me of a pot 
of broth, where all the scum floats up to the 
top ; and be my soul, Mistress Cassidy, like the 
broth, the scum must be taken off*, before it ^s 
fit for using. Well, there was Jack Donovan 
came into the Cat and Bagpipes with his arm 
broke, and one of his legs dislocated, in a fight 
with one of the policemen, whom he left 
stretched for dead on the road ; and when he 
came into the tap-room and showed how kilt 
he was, didn't your husband, Jim Cassidy, 
slap him on the back, and say he was glo- 
riously maimed and illustriously mutilated? 
upon which all of 'em began screeching and 
shouting out for Jim and for Jack Donovan. 
Faith, myself slipped off and came here, to be

out of harm's way ; for if the police goes to 
take up Jack Donovan, there'll be bad work at 
the Cat and Bagpipes, for all the boys are 
determined to stand by him. 
" They had a newspaper there, and were 
reading all the speeches of the Irish mimbers. 
Faith, I couldn't make head or tail of 'em, 
there was such hard words ; only one thing I 
minded, which was that when any of the 
Repalers made a speech, the English mimbers 
began to laugh, which was not mannerly ; 
though for the matter of that, maybe they 
couldn't help it, for sure it 's hard not to laugh 
at a joke, and many 's the joke our mimbers 
will pass on 'em before they 've done with 'em. 
" Well, then, when they laughed, one of the 
Repalers up and tould 'em plain enough,  
' Gentlemen,' says he, ' ye may laugh, but the 
laugh will be echoed by many a weep and wail 
from Ireland.' Faith, this reminded me of the

THE REPEALERS. 195 
echo, that when you cried out, ' How do you 
do ?' answered, ' Very well thank you.' Well, 
Mistress Cassidy, sure we ought to be thankful 
for such mild weather here anyway, when one 
sees in the newspapers that the mimbers 
couldn't be heard for coughing in the parlia- 
ment. Faith, I never heard the English were 
so subject to coulds till lately." 
Poor Grace had scarcely heard the observa- 
tions of Larry M'Swigger, from the moment 
that he told her of her husband's ill-judged 
compliments to Jack Donovan. At one instant 
she was tempted to go to the Cat and Bagpipes 
in search of him, but the next she felt ashamed 
to present herself before such an assemblage of 
riotous and intoxicated men ; she feared also 
that Jim might be offended at her going, and 
resent it before his companions. 
She repeatedly got up and went to the door, 
to see if her husband was approaching, but he

did not appear ; and she stood leaning on the 
door-post, dreading to enter the kitchen again, 
where Larry would be sure to assail her with 
a never-ending history, to which the present 
state of her nerves rendered her little disposed 
to listen. 
It was a clear, moonlight night, and every 
object was silvered over by the bright lu- 
minary. The stillness that reigned around, 
contrasted fearfully with the. disturbed feelings 
of Grace ; and she turned from a view that had 
often delighted her, because its very calm was 
at the present moment a mockery to the agita- 
tion and fear that filled her breast. 
How often had she stood with Jim on the 
same spot on such a night, both of them charm- 
ed with all that now lay spread before her, and 
wondering if the moon was equally brilliant 
in other places ! And well did she remember 
Jim*s saying, " Sure, if it is equally bright in
## p. 197 (#205) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 197 
other places, where could it find such a clear, 
beautiful looking-glass, to see its fair face in, as 
in our own broad river ? or such fine moun- 
tains to pass over, and such woods to be shin- 
ing on, as here? And sure, Grace asthore, every 
fair face likes to see itself. Didn't I catch 
your own dear self looking on the can of water 
one day when you first wore the pink ribbon I 
brought you from the fair of Carrick ?" 
What woman forgets a compliment from the 
man she loves ? The simple one of Jim, re- 
called to her recollection by the beautiful 
scene around, brought before her the fatal 
change in him. 
*' Ah ! he loved me then," thought Grace, 
" and saw beauty in my face ! Little he thinks 
of it now, for tears have withered it, and smiles 
are strangers to my mouth, that used to be 
so full of 'em. There is that same bright and 
beautiful moon, shining on the same moun-

tains, rivers, and trees  everything is just the 
same as when I was so happy. Sure, I think 
I 'd bear the change in him better, if all 
around me was changed too. But no ; that 
beautiful moon will shine just as brightly when 
I 'm in my grave and all my throubles are 
over; and everything will look just the same, 
though my eyes, that used to be so fond of 
looking on them, will see them no more. 
Well, I hope I may be buried by the side of 
Jim, in the sunny corner of the churchyard, 
for I 'd like to have the sun shining on our 
graves, and the beautiful moon looking down 
on 'em, even though we couldn't see 'em." 
The thought of death calmed the feelings of 
Grace. She entered, and found Larry M'Swig- 
ger asleep, with his head resting on the table. 
She retired to her room, and on her knees 
offered up her prayers to the throne of mercy, 
that her husband might be pardoned and pro-

THE REPEALERS. 199 
tected, and that grace might be accorded her to 
turn him from the evil course he was pursuing. 
She arose from her supplications calm and 
reassured ; and reclined in a chair to wait the 
return of her husband. 
There is a sublimity in prayer that elevates 
even the most ordinary minds ; for who ever 
lifted up his soul to the Divinity without feel- 
ing emotions to which language is inadequate 
to give expression ? The lips may breathe 
prayers, though they only faintly convey what is 
felt ; but the heart sends forth aspirations more 
fervent than speech ever framed. It is at such 
moments that all which is pure and fine in our 
natures is most developed. Nought is so puri- 
fying as prayer ; for evil passions must be at 
rest, ere the soul can raise itself up to the 
contemplation of the Almighty, and we must 
have pardoned ere we can pray for pardon. 
Jim returned not to his home until the

morning had dawned. His flushed cheek and 
blood-shot eyes betrayed that, though he had 
abstained from intoxicating draughts, in com- 
pliance with his oath, he had not refrained 
from the equally pernicious intoxication of 
agitation.

" Through the shadowy past, 
Like a tomb-searcher, memory ran, 
Lifting each shroud that time had cast 
O'er buried hopes." 
Grace dared not trust herself with a re- 
monstrance to Jim, until sleep had calmed the 
feverish excitement under which he evidently 
laboured. Hitherto, no word of anger or bit- 
terness had passed between them, because 
Grace had forborne to urge his impatient 
temper ; and she dreaded to expose herself to 
some ebullition of anger, in which recrimina- 
tion might break down the barriers of for-

bearance, that still supplied the place of love 
on the part of her husband. While he 
dropped into the heavy slumber that follows 
powerful excitement, she saw the morning sun 
break into the chamber. 
" This," thought she, " used to be his usual 
hour of going to his work. How have I stood 
at the door to look after him, as his feet 
brushed the dew from the grass, and the birds 
were singing from every branch ! I thought 
how many hours must pass before he returned 
to me again, and I was sorrowful; but when 
he got to the last bend of the field, and 
turned round to see if I was looking at him, 
and waved his hat to me so cheerfully, my 
spirits came back, and I used to think of pre- 
paring for his return something nice for his 
supper. When I rubbed all the furniture, 
and made it shine so bright, and stuck fresh 
holly on the dresser, among the pewter plates

that shone like silver, and looked round and 
saw everything so nate and tidy that a king 
might sit down in the kitchen; I used to be 
so proud and happy, thinking how he would 
enjoy it all when he came home  and he used 
to enjoy it, and praise everything I did, and 
call me his own dear good Grace, but now  '' 
Her eyes fell on the contracted brow of the 
sleeper  his flushed cheek, and clenched teeth, 
bore evidence that, though the body reposed, 
the mind was still active ; and " slaves and 
tyrants" were indistinctly murmured from his 
lips, as with a menacing gesture of the hand 
he muttered the words that had taken such 
a hold of his heated imagination. Bitter feel- 
ings arose in the breast of poor Grace, and she 
thanked God that she had still charity enough 
left, not to curse the wily agitators who had 
led her once excellent husband to this altered 
state, and blighted all her happiness.

" It's no use thinking and fretting," said 
Grace ; '' here is another day lost from his 
work; sure, I must try and make up for it, 
by doing as much as I can." 
And with this wise resolution, a resolution 
we would recommend to every wife in similar 
circumstances, she made her simple but neat 
toilette, cleaned her house, and performed all 
her domestic duties before Larry M'Swigger 
had risen from the comfortable bed which 
she had assigned to him. 
" Why then, faith. Mistress Cassidy, it's 
yourself that's the stirring active woman any 
way, to be up so early after being up so 
late, as a body might say. Sure, you're just 
as nate and tidy as if you were in your bed 
from nine till six, instead of, as I suspect, not 
having slept at all ; for I heard you sighing 
whenever I woke in the night, which I did 
mighty often, bekase the bed was so elegant

that I, who haven't been used to such a one for 
a long while, found that it disturbed me ; be- 
sides which, I couldn't sleep for dreaming. 
Faith, I dreamt enough to fill a book, and 
such quare things ! I hope they won't come 
thrue, though I 'm afeard they will, for I 
dreamt 'em chiefly towards the morning, and 
the morning dreams mostly comes thrue,  worse 
luck for me this time if they do. I used to 
hate getting up early when I was young ; 
faith, for the matther of that, I don't much 
like it now ; but I always remimbered that if 
I stayed sleeping in my bed in the morning, and 
had bad dreams, they 'd come thrue ; so that, 
made me jump up; and I'm tould by those 
that know all about it, that the dreams of 
the night never comes to pass,  I suppose it's 
chiefly bekase people can't remember 'em so 
well."

spread a clean white cloth on the deal table, 
placed a large loaf of home-baked brown bread 
on it, with a plate of nicely-scooped crock- 
butter, and two piggins of skimmed milk ; and 
invited Larry M'Swigger with a hearty wel- 
come to partake her humble repast : an invi- 
tation which he thankfully accepted, observ- 
ing, " that a good hand she was, to give a 
decent comfortable brekus, (Irish for breakfast,) 
with lashings of every thing ; and her mother, 
rest her soul ! was the same before her.*" 
They had only finished their repast, when 
Peggy Halloran, a neighbour, came in ; and, 
big with news which she was most anxious 
to communicate, began, after the usual morn- 
ing salutation of  " God save ye this fine 
morning !*" with " Have ye heard the news ?" 
Being answered in the negative, she con- 
tinued  " Well, then, it's great news, sur- 
prising news, and terrible news for some

people I'm thinking;" stealing a look at the 
blanched cheek of Grace, who latterly had as- 
sociated news, and trouble to Jim, together in 
her mind. " Well, sure there was one of them 
police kilt last night by one of the boys, and 
sure enough he 's dead downright, and they 've

and every mother's soul in Cologan that was 
out of their houses last night, will be taken up 
and hung for the murdher. Sure, what 's the 
matther with you, Mistress Cassidy ? you look 
as pale as death ; I hope none of your friends 
had a hand in this job. My honest man never 
stirred out of the house last night ;  faith, I 
took care he shouldn't, for I put a jar of 
potheen that I got from the mountains be- 
fore him, and says I, * There's better whisky 
than ever you '11 get at the Cat and Bagpipes,

for it ; so smoke your pipe, and take your

dhrop dacently at home.' He was mighty un- 
willing at first to stay, but whin once he began 
to taste the dhrop, he hadn't the heart to lave 
it, and niver quitted it till he fell off the chair ; 
and the childer and I pulled him to the bed, 
and he awoke as fresh as a daisy this morning, 
only a little bothered in the head; and glad 
enough he is that he wasn''t at the Cat and 
Bagpipes, where he surely would have been, 
only 1 had the dhrop at home for him." 
Grace sat stupified, listening to this ha- 
rangue, and Peggy Halloran continued  " I 
hope you '11 excuse my freedom, Mistress Cas- 
sidy, but I think it's a great pity you made 
Jim swear against the dhrop; sure, all the 
neighbours say, he never was the same man 
since. Had you let him alone, and always kept

quietly with you, and been dhrunk in an hour, 
and then you'd have had a quiet night's rest.

and an aisy mind, instead of having him out all 
night with them boys. And sure the worst of 
it is, that now as he 's known not to take the 
dhrop, he '11 come off worse bekase people can't 
say he stayed out all night for the dhrink, or 
that he was in liquor when he did this, that, or 
f other, for the liquor is always an excuse for 
everything." 
The comment on the interpretation that 
would be put on Jim's sobriety, struck Grace 
with terror. " What indeed," she thought, 
" could be said for his staying out all night, 
when it was proved he did not drink.? And 
I it was that kept him from drink, and have 
only saved him from the evils of intoxication, 
to see him fall into greater, more appalling 
danger !" 
To reason with Peggy Halloran on their 
different views of the duty of a wife, Grace 
felt would be as useless, as it would be

fatiguing to her present exhausted frame and 
spirits. She knew that Peggy only spoke 
the sentiments of the generality of her female 
neighbours, who, looking on intoxication as a 
habit as necessary and natural to their hus- 
bands as their pipes and tobacco, only cal- 
culated on the means of procuring them this 
indulgence at the least possible expense. 
What a state of morals ! and these dissolute 
beings are the supporters of the Repealers ! 
Larry M'Swigger marked the paleness of 
Grace's cheek ; he knew the sleepless night 
she had passed, and he felt irritated against 
Peggy Halloran for the unfeeling personality 
of her remarks. " Sure, Mistress Halloran, 
if Jim Cassidy has been out," said Larry, 
" wasn't it to give good advice, and, being 
the only sober man amongst them dhrunken 
boys, to keep 'em out of harm's v^^ay ? He 
had no more to say to killing the policeman

than I had, of which I can make my Bible 
oath any way, and prove a yellow boy (an 
alibi) for him, so never be unaisy, Mistress 
Cassidy my jewel, for you'll see there'll be 
no danger in life." 
He gave a triumphant look at Peggy Hal- 
loran, who felt its force, for she replied that, 
" Sure, she 'd be sorry enough that Jim Cas- 
sidy got into throuble, though she must say 
he never was the same man since he left off the 
dhrink." 
Several other of her neighbours having come 
in, announced to Grace, that the police were in 
search of Jack Donovan, who had fled, and that 
the man he wounded in the scuffle, the night 
before, was dead. They added the consolatory 
* intelligence, that as Jack Donovan had confess- 
ed the crime in the presence of so many wit- 
nesses at the Cat and Bagpipes, no one else 
could be suspected of it ; but that most proba-

bly, all the persons present at his acknowledge- 
ment of the murder, would be summoned to 
give evidence of his words. 
This was a great relief to Grace's fears, 
though she still looked forward with dread to 
the effect a summons might produce on the ex- 
cited feelings of Jim, whose imprudence made 
her apprehensive that, on his examination, he 
might compromise his own safety, by giving 
utterance to the seditious language he had 
lately adopted from the Repealers. 
She awoke him, and communicated the death 
of the policeman, and its possible results, ex- 
pecting that some sentiment of pity or regret 
might escape his lips, which would have given 
her an opportunity of impressing on his mind 
the fatal consequences likely to ensue from the 
conflicts between the peasantry and police, 
which his inflated language was calculated to 
encourage; and, as hitherto Jim had been as

remarkable for humanity as for high courage, 
two qualities that ought to be inseparable, she 
fully expected that he would feel shocked at the 
murder of the unfortunate man, who, 
*' Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneal'd, 
No reckoning made, was sent to his account 
With all his imperfections on his head :" 
but no, Jim's first expression was, " So perish 
all our enemies ! Jack Donovan has set a grand 
example by killing the first." 
" Oh ! hold your tongue, Jim, for mercy's 
sake !" said Grace, " for my sake ! Do you 
want to be taken up ? to be dragged to a 
prison ?  Jim, Jim, you'll break my heart." 
" Grace, you are not fit to be the wife of a 
Pathriot, or a Repaler," said Jim. " Sure 
what's a few lives, in comparison with getting 
our Parliament back ? which we '11 be sure to 
do, if we do all the mischief we can."

To reason with him at this moment, Grace 
felt, would be useless. She therefore merely 
urged him to put on his clothes, and go to his 
work as usual, as his absence from his ordinary 
occupation might create suspicions to his dis- 
advantage. She had some difficulty in per- 
suading the weak and wilful man even to 
this prudent measure, and he only yielded to 
her tears. 
When he was gone, Grace determined on pro- 
ceeding to Springmount, to entreat the protec- 
tion of the dear, good master, in case any mis- 
fortune should happen to Jim. She found ad- 
mittance to the beloved mistress and Miss Des- 
mond, and told them the extent of her fears. 
They entered into her situation with kind in- 
terest, and promised to say all that could be 
said to Mr. Desmond, to palliate the infatu- 
ation of Jim. 
'' Och ! dear ladies," said Grace, " my poor

him, and not to let his own foolish words ruin

has come over him/'' 
Mrs. Desmond and the amiable Frances 
sincerely pitied Grace, and dismissed her 
with promises of continued protection to her 
misguided husband, in spite of his folly and 
infatuation. 
On returning to her home, Grace met various 
bodies of the police on the road, and shrank 
from encountering them, as if she felt they 
must be her enemies, from the opposition her 
husband was disposed to show them. 
" A short time ago," thought she, " and 
the sight of these men would have given me

looked on them as the protectors of my hus- 
band and self; and so they would have been, 
had he continued to deserve it. But now he 
is their enemy, and they must be his, and

" Oh ! who art thou who dar'st of love complain ? 
He is a gentle spirit, and injures none! 
His foes are ours ; from them the bitter pain, 
The keen, deep anguish, the heart-rending groan, 
Which in his milder reign are never known. 
His tears are softer than the April showers ; 
White-handed innocence supports his throne ; 
His sighs are sweet as breath of earliest flowers, 
Affection guides his steps, and peace protects his 
bowers." 
The letter from the War Office, accepting 
Colonel Forrester's resignation, had no sooner 
arrived at Waterford, than he set out for Spring- 
mount, where his presence was hailed with joy.

Mr. Desmond had only returned from Dublin a 
few days before ; and the communications which 
the two friends had to make to each other on the 
state of the country, led both to the conclusion 
that though it would be much more agreeable 
to leave Ireland, and fix their residence in Eng- 
land, yet, as their presence and influence in the 
country might have some weight in subduing 
the spirit of insubordination which was so pre- 
valent, they ought to sacrifice pleasure to duty, 
and they agreed that they would remain at 
Springmount for the present. 
Mr. Desmond told Forrester that now his 
military ties were sundered, the sooner he sub- 
mitted to his conjugal ones the better, and that 
he had given his lawyer instructions to put all 
en regie.  " I have but my child and her hap- 
piness to consider,*" said the affectionate father : 
" all that I posses? is to be hers some future 
day ; but, en attendant, it is necessary for the

happiness of us all, that you and Frances 
should feel yourselves perfectly independent. 
Therefore half my fortune shall forthwith be- 
come yours, and you wiU not, I am sure, be 
impatient for the possession of the other half." 
Colonel Forrester felt that this was the mo- 
ment to open his mind to his future father-in- 
law ; and he told him that, knowing the love 
Frances felt for her parents, he hoped they 
could not suspect him of wishing to deprive 
either them or their child of the happiness of 
passing their lives together. 
" You have overlooked," continued he, *' the 
disparity of fortune between your daughter 
and myself. Can I .do less than declare to you 
that I will never separate her from you ? All 
future arrangements I leave entirely in your 
hands. Where you wish to live, there also will 
1 live. In short, I trust, that if you have 
not obtained a wealthy son-in-law, you have

at least found a grateful and attached one, 
who, having lost his own parents, will most 
gladly transfer the affection and duty he owed 
them, to you and Mrs. Desmond."" 
This frank and affectionate avowal removed 
the only chagrin the excellent couple had felt at 
the thoughts of the marriage of their daughter ; 
and all within the walls of Springmount was 
gaiety and happiness. 
" How I long to make you acquainted with 
my dear sister !" said Colonel Forrester to 
Frances. " You are formed for each other. 
Lady Oriel is so unsophisticated, so loving, 
and so loveable, that it is impossible to know 
her without being attached to her; and yet, 
though you are her junior, you are more pose^ 
more wise, than she is ; for she has a morbid 
susceptibility, or sensibility, call it which you 
will, which has been fostered by a similar ten- 
dency in the feelings of her otherwise faultless

THE REPEALERS. 221 
husband, that has sometimes alarmed me for 
her happiness." 
" Surely," said Frances, " this similarity in 
their feelings must be conducive to their hap- 
piness, as it must produce a better understand- 
ing, and preclude the possibility of disagree- 
ment.'"" 
" I am not prepared to admit this reason- 
ing," replied Colonel Forrester. " Though I 
maintain that a similarity of tastes is highly 
conducive to happiness, a too great assimila- 
tion of feelings is apt to mar it. Lord Oriel 
is too sensitive to speak his wishes, and thinks 
his wife ought to have an intuitive knowledge 
of them. Her extreme susceptibility enables 
her at a glance to perceive when anything has 
gone wrong, though she cannot always divine 
precisely its nature. Each is afraid of wound- 
ing the other ; hence, one half their lives passes 
in refined and delicate misunderstandings, and

the other half in conceahnents, or eclair cisse- 
ments of them. Less morbid feelings would 
avoid the first, and not be compelled to the 
other two. I see, dearest, that you smile, be- 
cause, luckily, you have never been exposed to a 
contact with persons like Lord Oriel, who have 
a thousand virtues and only one fault. You 
have lived with those who have all the former 
without the latter, and I must take care that 
through me you extend not your knowledge on 
this point, and not let too much happiness 
render me too fastidious. You, dear Frances ! 
must keep me in order, otherwise I shall be 
spoiled." 
The smile of affection with which the lovely 
girl extended her hand to her lover, gave little 
assurance of her compliance with his request 
of keeping him in order ; and her gentleness 
afforded evidence that he would be compelled 
to hold the reins of domestic government, as 
she was formed to obey more than to dictate.

Every thing being now in progress for the 
marriage of Colonel Forrester and Miss Des- 
mond, it became the general topic of conversa- 
tion in the neighbourhood. The observations 
it excited, showed how strongly party feelings 
and prejudices influenced the opinions of all 
classes on the subject. The gentry expressed 
their surprise that Mr. Desmond should be 
compelled to give his heiress to a stranger,  
an Englishman,  and of comparatively small 
fortune, when he might have chosen a more 
suitable husband for her in his own country. 
They dwelt on the annoyance of seeing so fine 
an estate pass into the hands of an utter 
stranger, and each had some hypercritical 
observations to make on the ColoneFs reserved 
air, distant manner, and too dignified demea- 
nour. In short, they were determined to find 
fault, and when this determination exists, it is 
not difficult to furnish it with food. 
Among the lower classes the intended alii-

ance excited still stronger disapprobation ; and 
as in no country do the lower orders claim 
or usurp to themselves a greater right of 
questioning the conduct and motives of their 
superiors, so in no country are they less 
capable of understanding either. The tap- 
room of the Cat and Bagpipes became the 
arena where these wordy plebeian gladiators 
were to attack the right of their excellent 
landlord to grant the hand of his daughter 
to him whom he considered the most worthy 
to possess it. 
" Here ""s a purty business," said Will 
Gavin, the smith ; " the ould fool of a mas- 
ther giving his daughter, and, what^s worse, 
the green acres, to the Sassenach ! Sure, 'tis 
enough to provoke a saint if there was any 
saints ; but they left the counthry when Castle- 
reagh, bad luck to him ! carried away the 
Union."

" Arrah, whisht ! hould your tongue. Will," 
said Tom Flaherty, the cow- doctor ; " don't be 
tanking of masthers. We've had enough of 
them any way ; and sure, as the Repalers tell us, 
we 're not to own to any masther any more but 
O'Blarney ; he that 's the pattern of boys, and 
fears nothing, except our letting the ould coun- 
thry go to sleep ; ' for,' says he, ' if onct you let 
the kingdom be rocked to sleep in the cradle of 
quietness, and hushed with a lullaby of sweet 
promises, there '11 be an end of ye. England 
never remimbers ye 're alive unless whin ye 're 
mad. Show her ye 're alive and kicking too,' 
says he, * and ye '11 frighten her.' " 
" Ay," says Will Gavin, " strike the iron 
while it's hot, and it will send out sparks to 
burn 'em ; but, as I was saying, couldn't an 
Irishman be found in all the counthry for Miss 
Desmond, that she must be married to one of 
them English .?"

'^ Yes," said another, " and an officer too ; 
a dragoon ready to ride rough -shod over us at 
the word of command. Faith, it 's too bad. I 
wonder what would the Repalers say to it ; for 
if they tell us to pay no tithes, what would 
they tell us about paying rint to a foreigner, 
Avho has no natural right to the soil, and who'll 
spend every guinea of it in England."" 
" Why, faith," said Will Gavin, with a 
knowing smile, " if we know well what we Ve 
about, and mind our hits, I don't see why, 
when we Ve bringing back our Parliament to 
the ould counthry, we shouldn't bring Eng- 
land, or the best of what's in it, at all events, 
over to keep it company. Sure it would be 
only fair play, for they 've had the best part of 
Ireland. Yet no, I won't say the best ; I '11 
only say the richest part. For many a long 
day they 've had the potatos, and left us the 
skins; the cream, and left us the skimmed

milk. But when our thrue friend said the 
other day in the Parliament, that there was a 
hundred thousand Irish in London, which he 
surely tould 'em to frighten 'em out of their 
seven senses, this was a plain hint that not only 
could they bring back the Parliament, but the 
rich English too. Och ! let him alone ; he 's 
the boy for bothering 'em ; and when they 
think they have him quiet, with some bone 
they \e thrown him to pick, faith it 's himself 
that turns round on 'em when they laist expect 
it, and makes a speech clear and clane in their 
teeth. Talk of the baist in the ould story- 
book, that when you cut oiFone head, another 
sprung up in its place, sure it's a joke to 
O'Blarney ; he has a fresh mouth to screech at 
'em every time they stop the ould one, and 
finds a way to slip through every noose they 
make to catch him. Sure, them English are 
the biggest fools under the sun, for they 'd

believe anything ; and whin they make an en- 
gagement, faith, they 're for keeping it bad or 
good ; but we know a thrick worth two of that, 
and that 's what our Repalers will show 'em 
before they 're done with 'em, or my name is 
not Will Gavin." 
" That's neither here or there," replied Tom 
Flaherty ; " the point is how are we to hinder 
this Sassenach from carrying off Springmount ?" 
'* Faith, it's aisy enough," answered half-a- 
dozen at a time ; '^ knock the breath out of his 
body ; put out its light, and that 's the shortest 
way of settling it." 
" Yes, but when would we be afther doing 
it ?" asked one who had been a silent auditor. 
" Look what a hullabaloo they 're making for 
just only killing a policeman. What would 
they do if we kilt a gentleman and a Curnel 
into the bargain ? Sure, they 'd have all them 
dragoons at our heels, killing one-half of us.

and frightening the other half out of their 
lives. It 's betther let the Curnel alone any 
way ; and sure I know a safer plan to keep him 
from taking away Springmount. Let us burn 
it." 
" Well said, my boy,*" screamed half-a- 
dozen voices at a time. " Right for you. 
Sure, if it 's burnt, he can only take away the 
ashes, and we won't begrudge him that.'' 
The party was interrupted by the host of the 
Cat and Bagpipes, who declared that, " though 
sorely against his will, he must send 'em quite 
entirely out of the house, as the police would 
be coming round to look after them.*" 
This produced some animated reflections and 
lamentations on the tyranny of forcing them to 
go home to their beds when only three parts 
intoxicated, and they agreed that it was a state 
of things not to be borne with. 
Let not the English reader imagine that this

picture of the lower order of the Irish is over- 
charged ; and yet let him not conclude that no 
goodness is to be found beneath the mass of 
brutality, sharpness, and cunning, that enve- 
lopes them. Their virtues are the genuine 
production of their natures, stunted and per- 
verted in their youth, and seldom called into 
action. But their vices are the offspring of 
circumstances, originating in misrule. They 
have become demoralized by real or imaginary 
aggravation, and are hurried against their sup- 
posed oppressors either to betray or to avenge. 
In the Irish character all the elements of good 
are to be found in abundance, but these are 
turned into instruments of destruction by the 
demagogues who know how to apply the 
spark to inflammable and evil passions. What 
the Irish peasantry now are, the newspapers 
teeming with the fearful catalogue of their 
crimes but too well tell us. What they

may become, will depend on freeing them 
from the pernicious influence of the moral 
incubus that now paralyses all their better 
feelings, and leaves them, like the infuriated 
bullocks driven on by the rebels in their bat- 
tles in the rebellion,  that memorable rebel- 
lion, which ought to be at once the warning 
and fearful example of the ruinous effects of 
not checking in time the first symptoms of 
disaffection, and saving this generous but mis- 
guided people from the terrible consequences 
of their own excesses.

The murder of the policeman seemed the 
signal for violence on all sides. The pea- 
santry knew the vengeance it would call down 
on their heads, and the police felt there was 
no longer safety for them but in their num- 
bers. The rubicon was passed, and blood 
had marked its passage; hence the two pas- 
sions of fear and revenge but added to the

bad feelings of both parties, and rendered 
them reckless of consequences. When parties 
of the police encountered the peasantry on 
the roads, angry glances, threatening ges- 
tures, and mocking taunts were exchanged, 
and it was easy to foresee that the sup- 
pressed hatred on both sides would, like pent- 
in fires, soon burst forth, and make fearful 
havoc. 
The anxiety and terror of Grace Cassidy 
having produced visible effects on her health, 
her husband was induced, by the feelings of 
love that still lingered in his heart for her, 
(but which had been quelled by the angry pas- 
sions that had lately tyrannized over that once 
calm and happy heart,) to stay in his cottage 
at night, and to attend to his work by day. 
This prudence was a sacrifice offered up to 
affection, and he had not delicacy enough to 
conceal that it was a sacrifice. . Jim, in this

respect, resembled but too clearly his sex in 
general ; even the most refined and polished 
of them seldom conceal any of the sacrifices 
they make, or what it costs to make them. 
This is reserved for women, and is one of the 
many proofs they give of their superiority in 
all matters of affection and delicacy. 
Larry M'Swigger had continued at Cologan, 
to be ready in case his testimony might be 
necessary in any examination as to the con- 
fession of Jack Donovan ; and Grace had in- 
vited him to sojourn at the cottage, thinking 
that his chat of an evening might amuse Jim, 
and console him for his absence from the Cat 
and Bagpipes. 
Larry had been a traveller in his youth, 
had seen much, and had grafted on a natu- 
rally shrewd understanding various shreds and 
patches of knowledge, acquired both from what 
he had seen and heard, that, joined to his ex- 
treme ignorance, rendered his conversation very

amusing to the unfastidious tastes of his au- 
ditors. 
Grace, her husband, and their guest, were 
enjoying their simple supper, when Jim burst 
forth with, " Well, Larry, what do you say 
now to what they're doing in England, going to 
send over soldiers to kill us all clear and clane ? 
Sure the King himself has threatened us, from 
his very sait of justice in the Parliament of 
Lords, and bawled out, they say, as loud as if 
he wished the echo of his voice would reach us 
over here ; but little we 'd mind it if it did. 
We 're used to echoes and know they 're made 
by emptiness; but didn't our friend in the 
Common Parliament soon tell 'em his mind 
about it, and say it was a bloody speech ?" 
" Sure he was right," said Larry. " We 
call the linen that stops a cut or a wound a 
bloody linen, and to my thinking, the King's 
speech will stop many a wound being given, 
therefore our friend was right to call it bloody.

But you see them English couldn''t under- 
stand the sense of it ; but I, who know the 
round-about way our ministers takes to say 
things, and how they say one thing when they 
mane another, I'm never at a loss to guess 
what they're afther." 
" It wouldn't be mannerly for me to be 
contradicting you, by the side of my own 
hearth," said Jim, " and you ould enough to 
be my father ; but I don't think that was what 
O'Biarney mint." 
" Never mind, Jim dear," interposed Grace, 
" what he meant. Whatever it was, the word 
was an ugly word, and a bad word to be tack- 
ed to a King's discourse, he who is the father 
of us all." 
" He may be the father of the English," 
said Jim, " but faith if he's a father to us, 
sure it's a step-father, for we seldom hear of 
him, except when he threatens us, and his

name seldom comes to us except with a 
Whereas before it. Sure, the Repalers told 
'em that they were wanting to treat us worse 
than the Algerines, which manes, to make 
black slaves of us."' 
" Och, that reminds me," said Larry, " of 
the terrible sight I saw on my travels, when I 
crost the salt-sea ocean. I never tould it to you, 
Mistress Cassidy, nor to you neither, Jim, and

hatred to be made a black slave as any of you, 
when I was young. Well then, once upon a 
time, as the ould story-tellers say, when I was 
tired of working in Ireland, and to tell you the 
thruth, though more is the shame for me, tired 
of the poor creathure of a wife too, I determined 
to go off to one of the West India islands to

pusses, and saels, and other outlandish animals,

show you the difference between sea and land  
I saw in the West Indies, what we calls a

there, is a great ugly baist that lives in the sea,

as they called it, can bring about. But that's 
nothing to what I'm going to tell you. 
" Well, if you knew all I suffered at sea, 
you 'd pity me ; and what was worse than 
all, I found I had a natural fear of it. 
Sure, when it used to get angry, and the 
big green waves used to mount up as if they

were going to swallow us, with a great white 
froth on the tops of 'em, which they often 
threw in our faces, I couldn't help think- 
ing they were spirits, they had such an 
awful, threatening look with 'em, and I had a 
dread of 'em, I never felt before for anything. 
Sure, I've looked when the ship seemed to be 
going down between two green mountains of 
water, and thought to myself who'll ever tell 
the secrets that's buried in your heart ? What 
a wonderful sight 'twould be to see the trea- 
sures that's hid below them great waves, and 
the poor remains of them, that has been longed 
aft her and cried afther, through many a long- 
night by those that loved 'em ; and to think 
their poor bones can never lie in holy ground, 
in a dacent grave, in some clane purty church- 
yard among their own people, where their 
friends might say in passing by, ' There lies 
poor Jim, or Jack !' which sure would be some

comfort ; but them poor crathures that was swal- 
lowed up by the big cruel waves, and has ships 
upon ships passing over "em, with perhaps, their 
own counthrymen in "'em, that can't so much as 
see one of their bones, och ! troth, it's a sor- 
rowful thing to think of! When I've been on 
duty at night, and have seen the great waves 
coming from a distance with their white manes 
moving and shining by the moon-light, sure 
IVe thought they were the throops of death 
sent afther us; and when they've come quite 
close, I could not for the life of me help going 
away from the sight of 'em, and hiding myself, 
though all the crew laughed at me. 
" But such sights as that, is no laughing mat- 
ter ! one feels so helpless, there is no account- 
ing for the danger, and no avoiding it. Och I 
sure, if there's a place in the world to make 
a poor crathure feel his own insignificance, it's 
a-board ship in a storm ; it's then the thought

of the mighty, the terrible power of God, enters 
into the heart of man, and he feels he is nothing 
without the mercy of his Creator. Then to see 
the sea, when she is in a good humour, the sun 
playing hide-and-seek with her ; one minute 
throwing all his golden beams over her smooth, 
looking-glass bosom, and the next hiding him- 
self behind some fine purple cloud ; och ! it's a 
glorious sight. Then again, to look at the 
way the sea pays court to the moon, keeping 
so quiet, and so steady, just to reflect all its 
silvery brightness, and not only her round 
face, but hundreds of pillars of silver all 
spread out beneath her, just like an illumina- 
tion to do her honour. Faith, I've thought 
to myself, * Och, it's you sea, that can put 
on a fine pleasant look when you like it, just 
to flatter the sun and moon ; but you Ve a 
deceaver, and I don't trust in you, for if only 
a blast of wind affronts you, 'tis )'ou that can

show the bad heart, and the black face, and 
rise up in fearful anger to revenge yourself.' 
" I took good care not to say a word of this 
out loud, for fear she'd take vengeance on me; 
but it was passing in my mind all the time she 
was sending back their own shining smiles to 
the sun and moon, as if she was always in a 
good humour, when I knew how bad she could 
behave when neither of Vm was to the fore. 
" Another terrible thing, too, that I suffered, 
was the draims I had a-board ship. No sooner 
did I shut my eyes, but I began draiming that 
I was on land, living under beautiful green 
trees, on grass softer than velvet, and birds 
singing all round. I smelt the very perfume of 
the flowers, and kept thanking God I was done 
with that spitfire of a rogue of a sea ; when the 
ship lurched, and I awoke to find myself, sure 
enough, in that terrible prison, with the fright- 
ful waves coming all around, with looks just as

if they would say, ' Here we are, and we're not 
done with you yet.' Och ! the bitterness of 
such awakings. Sure, even now they often 
come back to my mind, and whatever my 
throubles may be, I always thank God I'm 
not in the power of the decaitful sea. 
" Well, sure I Ve bothered ye any way 
with this shanohos* about the ocean, but now 
I 'm coming to the end of my story. We arriv- 
ed at a place,  faith, I forget the name of it,  
and a boat comes off to us filled with black 
nagirs, with hardly a rag on their black, shin- 
ing bodies. When I saw them, faith, a joke 
came into my head, and I cried out in Irish to 
'em, ' How are ye, my white beauties ?' They 
up and tould me in as good Irish as ever was 
spoken, ' Sure we 're purty well ; how is your- 
self.'^' This bothered me; so I made free to 
ax 'em how long they were there, and they

devil a step I '11 ever put on this island while I 
live, for, if I came out here to make my for- 
tune, I did not come out to turn a rael nagir 
as my poor countrymen have turned.'' So I 
stuck to the ship, and wouldnH go on land for 
all the world. 
" Six weeks the ship stopped there, but 
never did I go out of her ; I knew betther ; 
though, would you believe it ? they wanted to 
persuade me that the crathures that spoke 
Irish to me were rael blacks that had been 
taught Irish by the Irish settlers; but I was 
not so foolish as to believe it, for we Irish are 
too 'cute. An Englishman would have swal- 
lowed such a story, but I knew betther; so 
back I came to Cork, facing all the dangers of 
the deep, frightened as 1 was ; but any thing 
was betther than coming home a black with 
woolly hair.

" So you see, Mistress Cassidy, and you too, 
Jim, I suffered enough rather than submit to 
be made a slave. Faith, there's few has gone 
through so much for it." 
" I don't think," said Jim, " that it was the 
slavery you minded so much as the turning 
black and woolly." 
" Och ! troth," said Larry, " 'twas both ; 
but I don't believe, Jim, that you yourself 
would like to see those brown curly locks of 
yours that's buckling round your head, turned 
to black wool, nor your dacent red and white 
face turned to an oily black. I was young- 
then, and a clane comely boy into the bar- 
gain ; but ould as I am now, with my 
withered-up face, that looks like a shrivelled 
apple, my poor eyes like burnt holes in a 
blanket, or bottled gooseberries in a burnt- 
up pie, and my few locks of hair like flakes 
of snow hanging on an ould blasted tree, I

wouldn't wish to see myself turned into a 
nagir any way, bad as I am. If I had stayed 
to be a black, I might have come home with 
plinty of money, instead of being poor as I 
am now, on the shockarane,* here to-day and 
gone to-morrow. But sure it's no use to 
fret ; a pound of sorrow they say never paid 
an ounce of debt, not that I have any debts, 
God be thanked ! for, faith, no one seemed ever 
much inclined to trust me." 
" Did you hear what our friend said in the 
parliament in London about slavery, and the 
iron entering our souls ?'' interrogated Jim, 
resuming the train of thought that Larry's 
narrative had interrupted. 
" I did sure enough," said Larry ; " but I 
thought it quite rhaumeish. If he said the iron 
entered our bodies pretty often, there would be 
some sense in it, for sure the police and the 
soldiers are great hands at seeing what we 're

made of with the points of their bayonets ; but 
as for our souls, no one but God can touch 
them, which is some comfort ; and this I know, 
bekase when Bill Tobin swore before the jus- 
tice that Dan Tooley bait him, and threatened 
to send his soul to hell in five minutes, (and 
Bill swore, too, that he believed Dan would 
have done so, had he not been prevented by 
the bystanders,) the justice stopped him, and 
explained, that though any man might bait, or 
even kill him, no man could have power over 
his soul, as that was in the hands of God. 
Therefore, it 's nonsense for the Repalers to be 
talking of the iron entering the soul, and sinful 
too, according to my notions." 
" You may say what you like, Larry," re- 
plied Jim, " but if it wasn't for the Repalers 
we'd never know anything of all our throubles." 
" That 's what I blame 'em for," said Larry ; 
they Ve always swelling our throubles, making 
mole-hills into mountains, as the saying is ;

and sure what good does this do us, except to 
make us more vexed ? If they showed us a 
way to get out of ""em, I 'd say something ; but 
to be always ripping up ould sores, and never 
giving a plaister, sure, it 's not the part of 
thrue friends. 'T would be kinder to tell us to 
have patience, and give us good advice." 
" Would you have us continue in ignorance 
all our born days," said Jim, " as we used to 
be before the Repalers let us into the rael state 
of things ? Sure, we used to believe that the 
Duke of Wellington was the greatest man, the 
finest soldier, and the bravest general that ever 
commanded, till our mimbers tould us as he 
wasn't, and laughed at the notion of it ; and 
one by one they pull down all the great men 
that we used to be so proud of, that we'd have 
gone to the mouth of a cannon for 'em." 
" Well, then," said Larry, " are we happier 
or more contented, Jim, now that they have pull-

ed down all that we used to be so proud of, and 
left us nothing at all to keep up the conceit 
in us ? Many 's the time, when I Ve been 
could and hungry, the thoughts that I be- 
longed to the same counthry as the great 
Duke, has warmed my heart, and when I con- 
sidered that he had sent his name as an honour 
to Ireland to the four quarters of the world, 
ay, faith, and farther too, to be talked of, 
I 've felt that I could lose as many lives 
as a cat, ay, or even as Plutarch himself, 
if I had 'em, to do him a service. Sure, 
what 's the pleasure in life, if one hasn't some- 
thing to be proud of? and what is so natural 
as to be proud of such a man ? Them tliat 
would say he isn't the greatest general that 
ever lived, must have hearts too small to hold 
anything but their envy, and I 'd deny 'em 
for countrymen for ever and ever. We are 
such droll people, that if those that are an

honour and a credit to us, ain't always prais- 
ing themselves, we forget 'em. We mind 
words more than deeds, and this great man 
I 'm talking of, never praises himself. He 
laves that to others to do, for, as his brother 
truly said of him, ' He 's fonder of conquering 
the enemy than of telling how he did it.' 
Now our mimbers pass most of their time in 
paying compliments to themselves, and never 
can be said to want a trumpeter while their 
own tongues can wag. Then see how the 
Great Captain, (but, no, I won't call him a 
captain, for sure he 's a general, and the 
head of all generals, and I don't like to 
take away any of his grandeur,) see how he 
spaiks ; never with big blustering words, 
but with a quiet and steady dacency, that 
shows he 's in earnest. He \s always think- 
ing of the good of the counthry, and never 
thrying to make bad worse. Let who will

be in power, it 's all the same to him : as 
long as they do what 's right, he never axes 
what party they belong to. Och ! Jim, what 
ungrateful baists we must be to let any one 
talk against such a man, who has spent his life 
in fighting for us, and now gives up his ease, 
to think how we can be best served. Think, 
Jim, of the hundreds of nights he has passed 
without sleep ; the fatigues, the dangers, the 
risks, he has endured ; the thousands of lives 
that depended on his orders, and the years 
of anxiety he must have had, to bring off 
without a single spot, a reputation as difficult 
to be kept bright as it was hard to be gained. 
Sure, if poor ould Ireland no longer had a sun 
to shine over her, his fame would throw a light 
on her. And this is the man the Repalers 
would thry to persuade us we ought not to be 
proud of !" 
The enthusiasm of Larry excited the latent

252 THE REPEALERS. 
feelings of habitual admiration that had so long 
dwelt in the heart of Jim. 
" Faith, Larry, I believe you 're right," said 
he ; " for when you remind me of what the 
Duke has done, I can't help feeling as proud of 
him as ever, and I begin to think that those 
that want to pull him down, are set on by their 
jealousy and envy."

CHAPTER XXI. 
" Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise, 
(That last infirmity of noble minds) 
To scorn delight, and live laborious days ; 
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find. 
And think to burst out into sudden blaze, 
Comes the blind fury with th' abJ5rred shears. 
And slits the thin-spun life."" 
" With fame, in just proportion, envy grows ; 
The man that makes a character, makes foes.'* 
" I WAS looking about me, the whole of this 
blessed day,*" said Larry M'Swigger to Grace 
and Jim Cassidy, as they sat at their simple 
supper, " and I thought to myself, ' What a 
pity it is that a counthry which God has done

SO much for, man should do so much against. 
To see the beautiful mountains, looking so 
proud and grand, the trees so green and 
stately, the rivers so clear and rapid, and the 
skies more blue and laughing than any where 
else ' " 
" How can you say that ?" said Jim, whose 
present discontented state of mind led him to 
cavil with many of Larry ""s observations, " since 
isn't there twice more rain in Ireland than in 
England ? and yet you're for saying, the sky is 
laughing." 
" Faith, Jim, the poor sky is a real Irish 
sky, and like ourselves, is always either 
laughing or crying. It never, to my thinking, 
looks more beautiful than when after a heavy 
shower it brightens up and smiles on all 
around. It's for all the world like Mistress 
Cassidy, begging her pardon for talking of her 
when she is to the fore, for I've thought of the

sky when Fve seen the tears resting on her long 
black eyelashes, just as the drops of rain hang 
on the leaves, and a bright glance shine out of 
them same blue eyes, which looked all the 
brighter for the tears, as the sky does after the 
shower. But that's neither here nor there to 
what I was saying, which was, that God, praise 
be to His holy name ! has done every thing for 
Ireland, and man nothing except mischief. Is 
there a more fruitful soil in the world ? IVe 
heard people call the earth our mother, but 
faith, I say it's father, mother, sister, and 
brother ; ay, be my soul, and wife also ; for 
it takes us to her- breast when the whole 
world turns from us, and the sooner I'm sleep- 
ing there the betther," continued the poor 
old man, wiping a tear from his cheek, " for I 
love the poor counthry and many that's in it 
too well not to be sick at heart at all I see. 
Every thing that God gives us is turned to

bad account. We have had the bravest gene- 
rals, and we're now ungrateful to 'em, though 
they have brought honour and glory on the 
counthry. Our eloquence grows wild, for want 
of pruning ; our mad thoughts govern iiSy in- 
stead of our governing them ; our courage is 
shown in acts of brutality ; and all that might 
make us a grand people, only makes us a wick- 
ed and a thoughtless one/"* 
" Well, Larry, I never expected to hear 
you running down the counthry after this 
fashion," said Jim. 
" 'Tis not the counthry, but the people, I'm 
running down, Jim," replied Larry ; " because 
I 'm grieved to see what they are, when I 
think what they might be. They won't give 
themselves a fair chance, and only increase 
their throubles every day, by throwing more 
obstacles in the way of those who wish to 
serve and relieve 'em. It's a terrible thing,

THE REPEALERS. 257 
Jim, to love one's country in the very pulses 
of one's heart, and yet to be obliged to feel 
ashamed of it ; for who would have the face to 
stand up and boast himself an Irishman now, a 
title that I once thought the greatest honour 
upon earth for a poor man as well as a rich, 
when the name is stained with blood and 
crime, and we are looked upon at every side 
as scarcely better than savages ?" 
" Well, Larry, that baits out every thing. 
Savages, indeed ! Faith, if you were not a 
counthryman, and an ould friend into the bar- 
gain, and what's more than either, an ould 
man, Pd be for showing you we're not such 
savages as you think, by breaking every bone 
in your body, and dhriving your ivories down 
your throat." 
" Whisht ! Jim dear," said Grace, giving an 
imploring look at the inflamed countenance of 
her husband ; " sure Larry didn't mane to

258 THE REPEALERS. 
affront you, and don't be after saying such 
ugly words.*" 
Jim reached out his hand to Larry, who 
shook it and said, " Now hear me, Jim, quiet- 
ly for a minute. I 'm too ould and feeble to 
resent threatenings, and I know you would not 
hurt me ; but you prove yourself all that Tve 
been saying of the people. To show me you 
are not a savage, you Avould brutally maim me. 
Would not this prove to me, you were what 
I said ? So it is with the counthry and the 
people. Their violence confirms every report 
made to their disadvantage; and their own 
actions speak more against them than the re- 
presentations of their worst enemies. But, Jim, 
I''m heart-sick, so let us talk of something to 
comfort me ; let us talk of the Irishmen that 
console us for being Irish. Think of the 
honour it is to this poor counthry, that one 
can't take up an Army List without being

made as proud as a peacock, by seeing the 
numbers and numbers of Irish names, betther 
known all over the world, than in their own 
ungrateful, ignorant, counthry. Sure, if Wel- 
lington is like the full moon in the middle of 
the sky, he has plenty of bright stars around 
him from his own poor little green island to 
keep him company. Look at the Beresfords 
by land and sea ; there's brothers for you, and 
Irish brothers too ! Who wouldn't be proud of 
'em ? Look at Londonderry, who never had a 
fault but being too anxious for fighting, as we 
all are. Then there 's Cole, Packenham, Pack, 
and Doyle. But if I was to go through half of 
'em, when would I have done ? Faith, it warms 
my heart to think of 'em, when it is chilled by 
shame at the crimes of the lawless. No, Jim, 
let us never forget to be proud of such heroes, 
for if we do, our bravery and courage cannot 
last ; for, as well may you expect a fire to

continue burning without putting fuel on it, as 
to keep up courage and bravery when we are 
no longer proud of it. Sure the very brats of 
children running about half naked, has been 
known to stop when they heard all the people 
about 'em spaiking of the grand battles Wel- 
lington fought, and clap their little hands and 
cry out, ' We too will be soldiers, and be 
talked about/ 
''But now, it is not he that has fought 
the battles of England and Ireland, in many 
a field of blood, and has for ever w^oven the 
shamrock with the laurels in his garland, 
that is to be our adviser, as he has been our 
protector ; no, it's him that has known no fields 
of battle except the four courts or the assizes, 
and has never seen blood drawn except from 
broken heads of the foolish boys he has set by 
the ears with his burning words ; it''s him that's 
to taich us to forget all we loved and respected,

and get ourselves made the laughing-stock of 
England, with the blustering speeches of our 
mimbers, and the mad agitation of ourselves, 
ready to take a hint for committing crimes 
whenever we can get it. I 'm an ould man, 
Jim, and maybe haven't much gumption. I've 
seen this counthry often upset, and in danger 
from one cause or another ; but if you believe 
me, I never knew it so unruly or so ill-disposed 
as at present; and if you take my advice, and it 
comes from an honest and loving heart for you 
and your nice dacent creathure of a wife, you'll 
keep away from Repalers, and their rabble fol- 
lowers, and trust to the generosity, the good 
sense, and the honour and honesty of England, 
to bring us out of our th roubles."' 
Grace Cassidy listened with grateful atten- 
tion to the good advice of Larry to her hus- 
band. She saw that it produced more effect 
than all her representations had done, and she
## p. 262 (#270) ############################################
262 THE REPEALERS. 
thought to herself, '' Well, how proud men are, 
and how obstinate when advice comes from a 
woman, and above all a wife ; Larry has only 
repeated the same advice that I have so unsuc- 
cessfully given, and to which Jim paid no at- 
tention, and now he seems sensible of its value. 
But no matter, as long as he follows it, who it 
comes from ; sure it would be too much happi- 
ness for me to think / had brought him to his 
right mind, and I'll bless Larry for ever if he 
does it." 
Grace, in this instance, displayed a supe- 
riority over the generality of her sex, of which 
she, perhaps, was little conscious ; for if there 
is a point on which women are especially sensi- 
tive, it is in their jealousy of the influence of 
other persons over the minds of those they 
love. This jealousy they themselves attribute 
to wounded affection, while the ill-natured set 
it down to the effects of wounded vanity.

Something of both feelings may, perhaps, unite 
in producing it ; but, we are loth to search too 
profoundly into causes whose effects are at least 
flattering to the sterner sex, though they may 
not always be agreeable. The most painful 
and humiliating epoch in the life of a woman 
is, when she has discovered that he on whom 
she has anchored her hopes of happiness is 
deficient in intellect, and yet has too much 
pride or too little love, to supply the deficiency 
by attending to her counsels. A woman of 
merely ordinary understanding, actuated by 
a strong affection, acquires wisdom by suffer- 
ing ; and, short-sighted as she might be for 
herself, becomes prescient for him she loves 
and would save, and whose destruction in- 
gulphs all her hopes.

CHAPTER XXII. 
" No jealousy their dawn of love o'ercast, 
Nor blasted were their wedded days with strife ; 
Each season look'd delightful as it past 
To the fond husband and the faithful wife." 
The time now approached for the marriage 
of Miss Desmond and Colonel Forrester. The 
lawyers had sent the marriage settlement, 
which had taken a less than ordinary time to 
arrange, from the unusual circumstance, that 
no obstacles, objections, or explanations had 
been started by opposing interests. Colonel 
Forrester had left all to the superintendence 
of his future father-in-law, and submitted his

title-deeds, rent-roll, &c. to the inspection of 
Mr. Desmond's solicitor, was surprised to ob- 
serve the confidence or carelessness of the 
Colonel in the affair, as he naturally expected 
to have found every covenant debated by the 
legal adviser of the lover. 
So little of love appears in the customary 
financial arrangements for marriages, that, on 
reading a settlement between contracting par- 
ties, one would be led to imagine that the 
bandeau which is supposed to envelope the 
eyes of love, was already removed, and that 
two enemies, instead of two lovers, were about 
to enter into a treaty offensive and defensive, 
the conditions of which required the strictest 
investigation. Every contingency of mishap 
and misconduct that can arrive to poor frail 
human nature is calculated upon ; and, while 
hearts and inclinations are becoming but as one, 
separate interests and purses are assured to her,

whose pecuniary interest ought to depend on 
him on whom her happiness must depend. 
No homily in the EngUsh language could 
so impressively convey the disenchanting con- 
viction of the fickleness of affection and the 
instability of felicity, as the provisions in a 
modern marriage settlement, which are as little 
in harmony with religious feeling as they are 
in unison with love. Were w^omen to peruse 
such documents, never could they approach 
the altar with the idea that the engage- 
ment about to be contracted, was either so 
awful or so sacred as all pure and elevated 
minds are prone and desirous to consider it. 
" Those whom God has put together let no 
man separate," seems to be forgotten, as more 
provisions are made for the possibility of a 
hostile separation, than for that of preserving 
and cementing the irrevocable, though disso- 
luble bond of union.

How far such provisions may influence the 
future destinies of the contracting parties, we 
will not stop to enquire ; but we should like to 
see marriage made a less business-like specu- 
lation, and that she who resigns her affections 
and her liberty into the care of him she loves, 
should not contemplate a possibility of aught 
save death dividing them. 
Mr. Desmond was not to be surpassed in 
generosity by Colonel Forrester. He made no 
distinction or separate interests between his 
daughter and future son-in-law, and the 
" What, Sir, will you not tie up this estate, 
and strictly entail such and such a property ?" 
was checked by his prompt and explicit in- 
structions. 
The marriage of the lovers was celebrated in 
the parish church, the same sacred spot that had 
witnessed the baptism of Frances, in the pre- 
sence of a few of the most intimate friends

of the family. The happy couple did not, 
after partaking of an elegant dejeune a lafour- 
chette at the mansion of the bride's father, (to 
which a distinguished circle of fashionables 
were not invited,) set off in a splendid new 
post chariot and four, with postilions and out- 
riders, to pass the honeymoon at some distant 
inn, or elegant villa, where the blushes of the 
bride are exposed to the gaze of admiring 
waiters and smiling chambermaids, or to the 
more respectful, though scarcely less embar- 
rassing observation of strange servants. There 
was no rich trousseau displayed, or elegant 
corbeille exhibited, for the excitation of the 
envy of friends and the vanity of the pre- 
senter and presented ; no ; the tasteful and 
well-chosen wardrobe that had adorned Miss 
Desmond, or rather that she had adorned, since 
her departure from London a few months be- 
fore, was considered sufficiently rich for Mrs.

Forrester. That apparel which had robed her 
lovely person when she attracted the admira- 
tion of the lover, was thought good enough, 
and likely enough, to retain the affection of the 
husband ; so that the nuptials of the lovely 
Frances Desmond and her enamoured bride- 
groom were as unlike " a marriage in high 
life,*' as thej/ were dissimilar to the generality 
of lovers to be found in that circle. 
Their honeymoon was passed in the paternal 
mansion at Springmount, and their happiness 
was enhanced by its being partaken by their 
affectionate and gratified parents, who were 
not, like most parents under such circum- 
stances, left in solitude to feel that in acquiring 
a son-in-law they had lost a daughter. 
" How I wish, dearest Frances,'' said Co- 
lonel Forrester, " that I could see this fine 
country in a state of tranquillity, and the good 
qualities of the people allowed to develope them-

selves ! I have liked Ireland from my first 
arrival, but now, can I do otherwise than love 
the country that has given you birth ?" 
A sweet smile repaid the compliment, and 
Frances said  " You will not, I'm sure, en- 
tertain a less affection for me, when I confess 
that I should never have allowed myself to 
feel towards you as I do, had you disliked my 
poor abused country. I must acknowledge, it 
is not the most happy place to live in ; and 
when I have returned from dear tranquil Eng- 
land, and seen the melancholy contrast which 
ill-fated Ireland offered to the scenes I had 
left, I have been selfish enough to wish to 
reside altogether in England. Judge then, 
how well I can appreciate the hberality of 
liking this country under all its disadvantages ; 
and how I must esteem the person who can be 
content to remain here. I see and lament the 
faults of the Irish," continued Frances ; " but
## p. 271 (#279) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 271 
I pity and love the people notwithstanding 
their faults, and would gladly make any per- 
sonal sacrifice to ameliorate their condition, or 
to assist in forwarding their civilization." 
" We will join in the task,'" replied Colonel 
Forrester ; " with kindness and patience much 
may be effected. 
" You must make up your mind," observed 
Frances, " not to be greatly surprised or in- 
censed, if you find our efforts unavailing or 
repaid with ingratitude. Look at all my dear 
father and mother have done, through a sense 
of duty, giving up for years their friends and 
society in England, society and friends so con- 
genial to their tastes, to live on their estate in 
a sort of honorable exile. Until a short time 
ago, this truly conscientious and disinterested 
sacrifice seemed to be felt and valued by their 
dependants, and they were universally beloved ; 
but the voice of the agitators silenced that of

gratitude, and those who were the most at- 
tached to our family, are now taught to regard 
us with suspicion, if not with dislike. In no 
other country must the principle of doing good 
for its own sake, be so much acted upon as 
here ; for, one has seldom the pleasure of see- 
ing one's efforts crowned with success, and still 
more seldom that of having them acknow- 
ledged. A landlord who had passed his life 
as my father has done, in the most consci- 
entious and kind discharge of the duties which 
that character imposes, would find his popu- 
larity fall to the ground before a Repealer**s 
first burst of hyperbolical eloquence, and the 
good actions of a long life thrown into the 
shade by an inflammatory string of tropes, 
metaphors, and similes, artfully addressed to 
the passions of their dupes ; and, alas ! those 
who mislead them, are rich in these tinsel at- 
tributes, and in these alone. My dear father

was giving an instance the other day, of how 
little impression solid acts of service made on 
the Irish, in comparison with professions ; his 
illustration of this peculiarity was derived from 
the career of Sir John Newport, who has passed 
his life in the most active and judicious exer- 
tions for Ireland ; and the consequence is, that 
the lower orders not only neither regard nor 
revere, but do not even name him, while they 
applaud to the very skies any one of their 
mouthing orators with ' Repeal' on his lips, and 
self-aggrandisement in his heart. All this is 
very discouraging, but we must have patience, 
and hope for better times." 
" What appears to me most disadvantageous 
to Ireland," said Colonel Forrester, " is the 
want of that respectable middle class that 
exists in England, and which has such an 
influence on the lower orders. Here I ob- 
serve few, if any, of the farmers who have

such weight, and to whom the labourers refer 
as guides and examples in England. Men 
who have stakes in the country are unwilling 
to risk what they possess; and the most elo- 
quent agitator who ever Inflamed an Irish 
rabble, would find his rhetoric fall unheeded 
on ears accustomed to the chink of money. 
We English, who have not lived in Ireland 
some months, conclude that the meetings so 
numerously attended there, are composed of 
the middle class, and consequently we attach 
an importance to them as organs of public 
opinion. But if it was generally known that 
they are for the most part composed of the 
very dregs of the people, the sediment that 
ought to be at the bottom, but * which rises 
upwards when the nation boils,"* we should 
think differently, and cease to wonder that, 
to a set of ignorant and penniless men who 
have nothing to lose, and are easily led to

THE REPEALERS. 275 
hope that something may be gained, the 
harangues of the wordy and inflammatory 
Repealers are as a law which they blindly 
adopt to work the will of their crafty leaders, 
who use them as pioneers to break down all 
that intercepts their own march in the career 
of selfish policy and overreaching ambition. 
" One thing we must admit, dearest," conti- 
nued Colonel Forrester, " namely, that had 
this country not been dreadfully misgoverned, 
the agitators who now occupy so much atten- 
tion, would either have been usefully and 
honorably filling the situation to which talent 
seldom fails to elevate men in free countries, 
or they would have had no opportunities of 
making a mischievous use of it. Had the 
distinguished individual who now sits on the 
woolsack in England been an Irishman, and a 
Catholic, what might he not have been instead ? 
Would the powerful talents with which Provi-

dence has gifted him, remain unemployed ? 
And if no field of distinction was open to them, 
who can say that disappointed ambition, led on 
by the consciousness of innate power, might 
not have made him who now presides over law 
an open violater of it ? We are all the crea- 
tures of chance and circumstance to a certain 
degree. Great talents are seldom, if ever, 
unaccompanied by ambition. Under other and 
happier aspects, he who convulses Ireland 
might have been the pacificator, for no one 
can deny that he has talents to be anything he 
pleases; and did England labour under the 
misery and disqualifications that have oppress- 
ed Ireland for centuries, Lord might be 
an agitator instead of a chancellor. 
" The talents of such men as he who governs 
the lower classes in Ireland, ought to be public 
property, and should constitute part of the 
riches of a country Is it not melancholy that

misrule should have turned them from their 
natural channel, and that, like some fine stream, 
meant to fertilise a country, stopped in its 
course and bursting into violence from being 
checked, it overflows, and bearing down the 
riches it might have so much enhanced, is 
only to be traced by the ruin it has spread ?" 
"Is it possible, dearest, that you are an 
advocate for agitators ?" said Frances. " You 
almost persuade me to pity instead of disliking 
them." 
" I look to cause when I trace effect," said 
Colonel Forrester ; " and though I shudder at 
the mischief to which agitation has led and 
may yet lead, candour obliges me to own, that 
few men possessed of the talents of the arch- 
agitator, could, under the untoward circum- 
stances in which he found himself, have resisted 
to be what he is. He might have been a great 
man ; at present he is only a remarkable one.

CHAPTER XXIII. 
" But they do only strive themselves to raise, 
Through pompous pride and foolish vanity ; 
In th' eyes of people they put all their praise, 
And only boast of arms and ancestry ; 
But virtuous deeds, which did those arms first give 
To their grandsires, they care not to achieve." 
The letters Colonel Forrester had written to 
his family in England, announcing his mar- 
riage, had been answered by cordial and affec- 
tionate congratulations from all. That from 
his sister, Lady Oriel, breathed the most tender 
prayers and wishes for his happiness; but a 
tone of melancholy, almost amounting to so-

THE REPEALERS. 279 
lemnity, pervaded her letter, and threw a damp 
over the spirits of her brother. He felt as if 
the earnestness with which she prayed for a 
continuance of his happiness, conveyed an in- 
definable impression that her own was not 
equally secure; and a vague dread that all 
was not well with her, hung over his mind. 
The family at Springmount accepted an in- 
vitation to dine at Lord Abberville's, a no- 
bleman who resided near them. They found 
the few fashionables the neighbourhood could 
muster, assembled to meet them. Even the re- 
mote district of the county of Waterford could 
boast its fashionables and exclusives; for where 
do not folly and pretension penetrate ? 
Lord Abberville owed his title to the Union, 
and a certain, or rather uncertain, portion of 
his income to a judicious and persevering sys- 
tem of jobbing, only known in Ireland. The 
rents of his overlet property were paid by pre-

280 THE REPEALERS. 
sentments which he had influence with the 
grand jury of the county to get passed, and 
which allowed large sums to be expended in 
making roads over his estates ; the work to be 
done by his tenants, and the money to find its 
way into his coffers. Presentments for roads 
never required, and where a horse-track was 
all that was necessary, passed at every assizes, 
until his property was intersected by as many 
lines as a miniature map of Europe; while the 
roads really necessary for establishing commu- 
nications for agricultural or commercial pur- 
poses were totally neglected. 
Few persons ever theoretically or practically 
understood the whole arcana of the system of 
jobbing so perfectly as Lord Abberville, and 
few had derived more advantages from it. 
Can it, therefore, be wondered at, that he was 
strenuously opposed to every attempt to reform 
the old state of things, and was loud and vehe-

THE REPEALERS. 281 
ment in decrying innovations, or, as he called 
them, projects for the subversion of the consti- 
tution. Every change introduced to correct 
the abuses under which the country had been 
so long impoverished for the enrichment of a 
few, was considered by him as a spoliation of 
his property, and resented as acts of crying 
and flagrant injustice. He grew pathetic when 
he expatiated on such hardships, and inwardly 
cursed the march of intellect which had ren- 
dered them necessary. 
Lord Abberville was a representative peer, 
and had supported every government that had 
ruled the country since he enjoyed a seat in the 
House of Lords. Indeed, the possibility of 
opposing ministers, who had anything to give 
away, had never entered his head ; though it 
has been asserted on more than one occasion, 
that he had threatened to vote against them, 
unless certain sinecures were granted to his

near relatives, and certain advantages accorded 
to himself. But this, we are willing to believe, 
was mere scandal, having too good an opinion 
of peers in general, and of Irish peers in par- 
ticular, to believe that any of them would be 
capable of such conduct. 
Lady Abberville was a woman of fashion in 
Ireland, and a complaisant follower of women 
of fashion in England. She was indefatigable 
in her exertions to be useful to the patronesses 
of the exclusive circle in which her activity 
had succeeded in getting her tolerated ; and 
she would drive, ride, or walk, from one end of 
the town to the other, to execute their high 
behests, and perform all the disagreeable parts 
of the duties that devolved on them. Was 
a party to be got up on a short notice ? she 
was dispatched to entreat the attendance of 
the desired guests. Was some unlucky person 
to be cut? she was appointed to perform the

THE REPEALERS. 283 
operation ; and far from feeling the humiliating 
position in which she had placed herself, she 
gloried in it. She kept up an extensive cor- 
respondence, knew every thing that was going 
on everywhere, and could amuse with her gos- 
sip the tedious hours of les grand dames be- 
tween the dejeunt and the promenade. She 
possessed a power of ubiquity as extraordinary 
as her loquacity, and was as humble and com- 
plaisant with the magnates of the land and 
their high-born ladies, as she was brusque and 
impertinent to those whom she considered to be 
her inferiors. Tracasserie was as congenial to 
her, as repose and peace are to others. Her 
mauvaise langue had become proverbial, and 
its results were to involve her in constant ex- 
planations, in which she was accused of show- 
ing a philosophical disregard to veracity, the 
dictates of which she seemed to consider too 
obsolete for her practice.
## p. 284 (#292) ############################################
284 THE REPEALERS. 
The presence of Lord and Lady Abberville 
in their county was always hailed with dread 
by their neighbours; they only came to raise 
the supplies for carrying on the campaign in 
England, or to get up some political address 
to convey an impression in England that his 
lordship had weight in Ireland. The delusion 
occasioned by these stratagems constituted the 
only reason for his visits being tolerated at 
the Treasury; where he was in the habit of 
intruding them for the purpose of having it 
announced in the papers, that on such or 
such a day Lord Abberville had an interview 
with the First Lord of the Treasury, which an- 
nouncement, being always copied into the Irish 
papers, failed not to produce its effect there. 
Thus, by passing in England as a man who 
had influence in Ireland, and in Ireland as a 
nobleman who had considerable weight in Eng- 
land, he contrived to impose on both nations, im- 
pressing them with a mutual bad opinion of the
## p. 285 (#293) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 285 
sagacity of the other ; for, the First Lord of the 
Treasury of each administration that had held 
the reins of government has been heard to say, 
" What a country Ireland must be, and what 
barbarous people the Irish, when such a man as 
Lord Abberville can have any influence with 
them !" And the gentry of Ireland, ever prone 
to stigmatize England, have been known to 
dwell with bitter sarcasms on the English mi- 
nistry being so credulous as to believe that 
such a talentless and unprincipled jobber as 
the peer should have power to be of use to 
them in Ireland. 
Lady Abberville profited by the political 
profligacy of her husband, which she aided and 
abetted to the utmost of her power ; but she 
held his abilities and opinions in perfect scorn, 
and perhaps the only sentiment common to 
each was, a contemptuous dislike of the other. 
The guests at Abberville-house consisted of 
two or three of the neighbouring families, the

General commanding the district, and two field 
officers of the regiment in the neighbourhood. 
The host and hostess assumed their most 
bland smiles to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Des- 
mond, and Colonel and Mrs. Forrester, as 
Lady Abberville felt they might not only be 
useful acquaintances in Ireland, where the for- 
tune and character of Mr. Desmond gave him 
great influence, but the connexion was a de- 
sirable one to be kept up in England. The 
relative importance of each of the guests 
might be ascertained by the diplomatic at- 
tentions paid them by the lord and lady of 
the mansion, which were empresse, coldly polite, 
or indifferent, according to their supposed ca- 
pabilities of forwarding the host's plans. The 
General was fete, because a plot of barren land 
which Lord Abberville had tried various modes 
of getting rid of, was now discovered by his lord- 
ship to be most admirably adapted for building
## p. 287 (#295) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 287 
a barrack on ; this ground was to be disposed of 
to Government for not more than six times its 
value. The opinion of the General as to the 
eligibility of the situation for a barrack, would 
probably decide the Government in buying the 
land ; and the opinion of Mr. Desmond and the 
other gentlemen invited, as to the necessity of 
having a large body of troops on the spot, and 
consequently of erecting a barrack to contain 
them, would decide its being built. 
It was settled between the host and hostess, 
that while one harangued the gentlemen in the 
dining-room on the advantages of having troops 
and a barrack, the other should impress on 
the minds of the ladies the improvement such 
an event must produce to the neighbourhood. 
Young men of family and fortune, with which 
the military profession abounded, would be 
thrown amongst them, balls and private thea- 
tricals would be the certain result, and what

such exhilarating amusements and near vicinity 
might lead to, was implied so clearly as to en- 
list the mammas and daughters of her circle 
most warmly in the interest of Lady Abberville. 
The dinner passed off much as all dinners in 
similar houses pass. The more recherche part 
of the guests detected various proofs of the in- 
competence of the artiste to the task he had 
attempted, and pronounced him not skilled 
in the arcanum recondite of Monsieur Ude's 
cuisine; while the less fastidious, who looked 
more to the quantity than the quality of the 
repast, averred it to be excellent. 
The interesting investigations of the compa- 
rative merits of sherry and madeira, of dry and 
sweet champaigne, and the equally important 
question whether hock was or was not better 
when iced, had given place to local topics, 
when Lady Abberville, anxious to show her 
importance to some of her less fashionable

THE REPEALERS. S89 
friends, led the conversation to England. She 
had received letters that day from the Duchess 
of AVellborough, and the Marchioness of Not- 
tingham, filled with reproaches for staying so 
long away from them. Indeed, she had pro- 
mised ere they allowed her to depart from Lon- 
don, that she would return in two months, but 
it was so hard" (bowing to her guests) " to leave 
her own agreeable neighbourhood, that she al- 
ways found it difficult to tear herself away." 
This compliment of course elicited a flatter- 
ing rejoinder from some of the persons who con- 
cluded themselves to be designated in the cir- 
cle of agreeable neighbourhood ; and then Lady 
Abberville resuming the conversation observ- 
ed, that at this moment her absence from Eng- 
land was peculiarly unfortunate, as her friends 
wished to consult her as to the possibility of 
continuing to receive a lady who had placed 
herself in a very false position. The elderly

ladies looked grave, and the young ones of the 
party thought it necessary to fix their eyes on 
their plates, and to blush, while the hostess, " on 
scandalous thoughts intent," proceeded to state, 
that it was indeed a very difficult case to decide 
on, as though much publicity and scandal had 
taken place, the husband of the lady in ques- 
tion had continued to live with her. The 
Duchess of Wellborough and Lady Notting- 
ham were disposed to give her their counte- 
nance, but she must say, she thought it a 
case in which an example ought to be made, 
as the lady had been a very prominent per- 
son in society, and had frequently marred 
the regulations and exclusions of the Lady 
Patronesses by an affected good nature, re- 
peatedly giving admissions to persons of no 
sort of fashion, to whose solicitations the other 
patronesses had turned a deaf ear. " Altoge- 
ther,*" continued Lady Abberville, '* I never

liked the lady. She had too much pretension 
for my taste  had the rage for encouraging 
les beaux arts, and doing a thousand other 
equally outre things ; and as for getting her to 
join our clique in the measures we so often 
find it necessary to adopt, it was out of the 
question. She opposed herself to cutting or 
leaving off people, and in fact, always gave us 
trouble by never being d'*accord with the other 
Lady Patronesses." 
Mrs. Kennedy, a well-meaning but obtuse 
country lady, who was present, turned to her 
daughter and said, " You see, Kate, I told you 
that Lady Abberville was one of the patronesses 
at Almack's, though you tried to persuade me 
she was not."" 
This mal-apropos observation, originating 
in the use of the us, evidently discomposed the 
self-complacency of the hostess, and as evidently 
amused the rest of the guests ; while to avoid 
o 2

the necessity of giving a definite answer, which 
she felt the persevering obtusity of Mrs. Ken- 
nedy would endeavour to elicit, she interrupted 
her observations by adding, " How very incu- 
rious you all are ! No one has asked me to 
name the fair delinquent. Now in England 
fifty questions would have been asked, and 
as many guesses made, before I had got half 
through my statement. Does this difference 
proceed from your being less curious, or more 
good-natured than our English neighbours ? 
or, as I suppose, does it originate in your igno- 
rance of the parties in question, which makes 
vou indifferent to what has put all the fashion- 
able world in England in a fever .f^ Well then, 
the heroine of this, what shall I call it ? tragedy, 
comedy, or drama in high life, is  Lady Oriel."" 
Mrs. Forrester felt almost ready to drop off 
her chair when the name of Lady Oriel was 
pronounced, and she stole a glance at her

THE REPEALERS. 293 
husband, whose face became pale as death, 
and then was suffused with crimson. Mr. and 
Mrs. Desmond were the only persons at the 
table aware of the near relationship of Lady 
Oriel to Colonel Forrester ; and they, pitying 
his embarrassment, made some remarks to draw 
the attention of the party to another subject. 
Mrs. Forrester would have given the world to 
be alone with her husband that she might speak 
comfort to him, or, if that was impossible, share 
his chagrin; and never did a few minutes that 
the ladies remained in the salle a manger, ap- 
pear so long to her. 
At length Lady Abberville arose, and led the 
way to the drawing-room ; but, before quitting 
the room, Mrs. Forrester exchanged an affec- 
tionate glance with her husband ; a glance 
which spoke volumes to them both. Frances 
had never liked Lady Abberville, but now she 
felt an antipathy towards her; she detected

294 THE REPEALERS. 
the covert envy, hatred, and malice, that in- 
stigated this calumny of the young and beau- 
tiful Lady Oriel ; and turned with disgust from 
a woman whose reputation had through life 
been so often pulled to pieces, that, though 
patched up, the rents were visible, proving the 
truth of the homely French proverb, " Une re- 
putation pldtree est comme un has raccommode 
qui laisse toujours voir oil la dtfaut existait.^'' 
No one had presumed on, and profited by, 
the indulgence of the world more largely than 
had Lady Abberville, and no one shov/ed a 
greater disposition to deprive others of a 
similar advantage. Hers had not only been 
" a youth of folly, and old age of cards," 
but a youth and maturity of flirting, and 
an old age of scandal, envy, and defama- 
tion. Every man and every woman's tongue 
had been against her, and hers was now 
turned against all whom she did not fear,

and they were few, but sacred in her eyes; 
as, all the advantages and disadvantages to 
be derived from being on good or bad terms 
with them having been maturely weighed and 
the former found to preponderate, amity was 
proved to be the wiser course, and prudence 
therefore triumphed over malice. 
Mrs. Forrester seized the first opportunity 
of approaching her mother, without exciting 
attention ; a pressure of the hand showed how 
deeply she sympathized in the feelings of her 
daughter ; and an air of cold and dignified po- 
liteness on the part of both ladies towards the 
intriguing hostess,  which neither all her most 
amusing anecdotes of fashionable scandal, nor 
her deferential attentions, could change into a 
more cordial manner,  made her feel that 
something, she could not imagine what, had 
gone wrong. 
Colonel Forrester sat in agony in the salle

d manger. Now was revealed to him the 
cause of the melancholy that pervaded his 
sister's last letter. Why had she not told 
him all, instead of allowing the dreadful 
news to break thus unexpectedly upon him? 
And yet knowing her as he did, feeling con- 
vinced of her purity, it was impossible to be- 
lieve that she could have merited the scandal 
which had fallen on her name. No, his dear 
sister v^^as innocent ; was the victim of false 
appearances ; and, with a husband so morbidly 
susceptible even to the approach of ignominy, 
what must be her situation ? His mind was 
in a chaos; and, to the continual references 
for his opinion, made by his garrulous host, 
always on subjects immediately or remotely 
connected with his own personal interest. Co- 
lonel Forrester only replied by an absent bow 
or incoherent monosyllables. 
Counting the moments with impatience until

he could leave a house now become hateful 
to him, as the scene of the defamation of 
his dear sister, and of the profanation of her 
name by the viper tongue of its mistress, he 
sat in painful reflection on the odious theme. 
When Lady Oriel had first become the subject 
of conversation, he could scarcely refrain from 
denouncing the slanderer, and vindicating the 
fair fame of his sister ; but a moment's consi- 
deration had taught him the imprudence of a 
measure which could only have tended to com- 
promise still more, not only her dignity but his 
own. A doubt of his sister'*s purity had never 
entered his mind, and his heart overflowed with 
tenderness and pity when he thought of her. 
He felt that she was exposed to humiliations 
which her delicate feelings were little calcu- 
lated to support ; and, above all, exposed to 
the morbid susceptibility of her husband, who 
would shrink under every infliction, until he

made her endure the most insupportable of all 
annoyance, that of having drawn publicity 
and defamation on another, and that other, 
not only incapable of despising the unmerit- 
ed stigma, but even of concealing the suffer- 
ings which it caused. 
The host's self-compliments, demands for ap- 
probation, and insinuations of influence with 
" the powers that be,*" were at last concluded, 
and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the 
drawing-room. Colonel Forrester would have 
unceremoniously sought them an hour before, 
but that he dreaded to find himself with Lady 
Abberville, even still more than to be com- 
pelled to listen to the verbose, oft beginning, 
never ending, histories of her Lord. Mr. Des- 
mond entered into all his feelings, and the 
sympathy of his wife, father, and mother-in- 
law, if it prevented not the wound offered to 
his peace, at least carried oil and wine to it.

Those are indeed fortunate who find, when 
sorrow assails them, that friendship admi- 
nisters an anodyne; and as this good fortune 
becomes more rare, it is like all rarities, en- 
joyed still more poignantly. There is no situa- 
tion into which our own errors can plunge us, 
wherein we do not call up pride or fortitude 
to support us, and enable us to forego the 
commiseration of friends; but when some one 
dear to us has drawn down the burning coals 
of scandal on her devoted head, then it is that 
we most require sympathy to enable us to bear 
up against the tide of defamation ; and to 
prove to us that we are sufficiently loved, to 
gain forbearance for the object of our interest, 
a belief in her innocence, or pity for her errors. 
Colonel Forrester knew that she whom he had 
chosen for his wife, would take his affirmation 
for the honour of his sister ; and so would her 
parents. But how dreadful to be compelled

800 THE REPEALERS. 
to affirm that which ought never to have been 
doubted ! and of a sister, too, of whom he was 
so justly proud ! 
Music, as ill executed as the company were 
ill assorted, filled up the weary hour-and-a 
half between the arrival of the gentlemen in 
the drawing-room and the announcement of 
the carriages. The listening to bad music was 
one of the many penances the diplomatic Lady 
Abberville imposed on herself during her exile 
in Ireland. Not to ask Miss Kennedy and the 
other Misses to play and sing, would have 
deeply mortified the young ladies, and offended 
their mammas, who failed not to repeat in all 
circles, how charmed Lady Abberville had been 
with Kate or Maria's singing and execution on 
the pianoforte. 
No sooner did the family from Springmount 
find themselves alone in the coach, than Co- 
lonel Forrester declared, that what he had

THE REPEALERS. 301 
heard relative to his sister had given him such 
pain, that he had determined to go to England. 
Mr. Desmond immediately said, " We will all 
go, my dear son, for our presence may be use- 
ful; at all events we will not be separated 
from you when you have any annoyance to 
undergo." 
Mrs. Desmond also expressed her kind 
wishes, and Frances placed her hand in his, 
as with animation she declared her impa- 
tience to be with her dear sister, whom she 
had already learned to love, but now doubly 
so, because she doubly required the affection of 
her friends. 
Hasty preparations were made for their de- 
parture from Ireland, and the journey was 
performed as expeditiously as was consistent 
with the comfort of Mr. and Mrs. Desmond. 
On their arrival in London, Colonel Forrester 
wrote to his sister, announcing his intention

of paying her a visit, accompanied by his wife. 
He did not touch on the reports that had 
reached him, as he wished the first notice of 
them should come from Lady Oriel. Indeed, 
he only desired to be made acquainted with 
the real state of affairs, that he might know 
how best to remedy the evil ; for he felt that 
the retiring habits and extreme sensitiveness 
of Lord Oriel peculiarly unfitted him for taking 
the necessary steps in the painful situation in 
which his wife was placed. 
The return of the post brought him a warm 
invitation from Lord Oriel for the whole party 
to proceed to Oriel Park, and a letter from his 
sister ; before perusing which, it is necessary for 
us to make our readers acquainted with Lord 
and Lady Oriel.

CHAPTER XXIV. 
" Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose, 
Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those ; 
Favours to none, to all she smiles extends, 
Oft she rejects, but never once offends. 
Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike. 
And, like the sun, they shine on all alike !" 
Lady Oriel was a young and lovely wo- 
man, remarkable for talent, vivacity, and that 
esprit de socitte, qui met tout en train. Mis- 
tress of a fine house, hien montte^ and placed 
by an indulgent husband at the head of a 
large fortune, she was one of the leaders of 
haut ton, and bore her blushing honours so 
good-naturedly, if not meekly, that she might

304 THE REPEALERS. 
almost be pardoned her success. So proverbial 
had her good-nature become, that she was by 
the satirical considered and called the " Refuge 
of the Destitute f* for if the wife of some coun- 
ty member living at the other side of Oxford- 
street, and blessed with two daughters, the 
softened images of their sapient papa or com- 
mon-place mamma, wished to exhibit herself 
and progeny at Almack''s, and, to accomplish 
this desirable project, had assailed, but assail- 
ed in vain, all the other patronesses, Lady 
Oriel was la derniere ressource, and a re- 
source that rarely failed. Did some young 
and thoughtless woman, whose beauty had 
excited still more female enemies than male 
admirers, find herself in that perilous condi- 
tion of being barely tolerated where she had 
been sought, and more than one-half of the 
society standing aloof to observe how she was 
received by the other. Lady Oriel's frank

THE REPEALERS. 305 
shake-hands, cordial accueil, or apropos invita- 
tion to a ball or soiree bien choisie, turned the 
scale in her favour, and re-established her, if 
not " in decencies for ever,"" at least in fashion- 
able society. Did a young painter or sculptor, 
pining in obscurity, wish to exhibit his personi- 
fication of the beau ideal that haunted his 
visions and grew beneath his hand. Lady 
Oriel's elegant salons received his work ; where 
her bland smile and just commendation found 
for it admirers and purchasers among those who 
had hardly deigned to remark it in a less dig- 
nified asylum. 
Lady Oriel's beauty was so regular, her air 
so distittgiie^ and her manner so comme il J'aut, 
and withal so fascinating, that her reputation 
as a first-rate belle was not merely an affaire 
de convention. I really do believe, though long 
experience has rendered me sceptical on such 
points, that even without her husband's rent-

S06 THE REPEALERS. 
roll of sixty thousand a year (which always 
throws a heavy balance into the scale in which 
beauty, talents, and manners, are weighed), 
she would always have been considered as a 
most captivating woman ; indeed, an irrefra- 
gable proof of the correctness of this opinion is, 
that her husband maintained it after a union 
of four years  an argument that must silence 
all sceptics. 
But though the beauty, talents, and accom- 
plishments of Lady Oriel were such as fell to 
the lot of few ; her faults, alas ! though they 
were only those which too generally attend such 
qualities, threw a shade on them that cast its 
sombre hue o'er many a future year :  but let 
me not anticipate. Lady Oriel had married at 
seventeen, and made what might indeed have 
been called a most desirable match. Lord Oriel 
was five-and-twenty, remarkably handsome, 
good-looking, well-informed, good-tempered, 
of an ancient family, and enjoying not only
## p. 307 (#315) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 307 
a very large, but that now rare possession, an 
unencumbered fortune; and, rarely as it hap- 
pens, the last-mentioned circumstance had lit- 
tle if any influence in the choice of his wife, 
who really married him because she preferred 
him to all others. Theirs was in truth a union 
of affection ! 
Lord Oriel to an easiness of disposition that 
shrank from trouble, conjoined a delicate sus- 
ceptibility on many points that was often op- 
posed to it. He wished  nay more, expected 
that those he loved should anticipate his feel- 
ings and guess his sentiments ; and when this, 
as has too often been the case, did not occur, he 
retired in silence, the arrow of disappointment 
rankling in his breast, to brood over his sup- 
posed wrongs, when a kind and frank exposition 
might have realized all his wishes. 
Lady Oriers besetting sin was coquetry; 
commenced in a wish to please (let us call it by 
no harsher name), it animated all her pursuits.

308 THE REPEALERS. 
and guided all her actions. This desire to 
fascinate equally influenced her in her bearing 
and conduct to both the old and the young; 
in it originated the air of captivated attention 
with which she listened to the aged and polished 
raconteur; the piquant smile with which she 
repaid the young and fashionable homme de 
bonne compagnie for his sallies; the suavity 
which characterized her intercourse with her 
own sex, to each of whom she had something 
aimable to say ; and even the joyous game 
of romps, or pretty stories, with which she 
made captive the hearts and ears of all the 
children she encountered. 
Yet let me do her the justice to say, there 
was nothing artificial in all this. Happy and 
pleased with herself, she wished to please and 
render happy all who surrounded her ; and this 
habit, by indulgence, so grew on her, that it 
soon became incurable, and \he frais made to 
accomplish it but too evident.
## p. 309 (#317) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 309 
During the first few months of her marriage, 
which were passed in the country, paying and 
receiving the visits of all the relations and 
neighbours of her husband, he was proud of 
her success. When the old dwelt on her 
praises, and the eyes of the young sparkled 
when she appeared, he shared her triumph, 
nay, attributed the pains she took to please to 
her wish of gratifying him by attentions to his 
friends ; and he repaid her efforts by a thou- 
sand fond commendations. 
But when, arrived in London, among stran- 
gers, he saw the ssLvnefrais made day after day 
and night after night, he began to think it was 
unnecessary, if not undignified ; and as he 
stood aloof,  wincing at witnessing the air half 
nonchalant of some, and trop empresse of others, 
surrounding his lovely wife, basking beneath 
the sunshine of her smile and the summer-light- 
nings of her playful wit somewhat too ani- 
matedly displayed,  he wished her success had

been less general, or at least that less pains had 
been taken to obtain it. He felt hurt that she 
did not remark that he no longer participated 
in her triumph ; he daily expected some tender 
reproach, which would give him a good oppor- 
tunity of hinting his disapproval ; but his tacit 
acquiescence passed with her for tacit approba- 
tion, and she continued to throw her fascina- 
tions around, unconscious that she was wound- 
ing the heart most dear to her on earth, and 
encouraging a host of pretenders, whose atten- 
tions, and the evident pleasure with which they 
were received, excited observations injurious to 
her delicacy, if not to her fame. 
Among the host of admirers (though as yet 
they had not dared to avow themselves as such) 
who followed in her train, Lord Delmore was 
the most dangerous. Handsome, clever, well- 
educated, and highly polished in his manners  
but cold-hearted, calculating, and unimaginative, 
the success he had met with in London and

THE REPEALERS. 311 
on the Continent had fostered his natural vanity, 
until it had become almost overweening; and 
his selfishness, that vice so unpardonable in the 
young, was proverbial with those who knew 
him. Lady OriePs position attracted, and her 
beauty captivated, him ; her animation in his 
presence he attributed to her wish of fixing 
him ir her chains ; and, undoubting the success 
of his final conquest, he played with her as a 
skilful angler plays with the fish he is about to 
ensnare : one day coldly polite, replying to 
all her sallies with an air of pre-occupation, 
until he had piqued her into something like 
interest ; and the next all attention, seeming to 
dwell on each word and movement of hers with 
that deep impassioned sentiment so flattering 
to woman's vanity. Lord Delmore had ruined 
more female reputations than any young man 
about town; and the good name of many a 
woman, whose virtue had resisted his arts, 
fell a sacrifice to his innuendoes and insidious

attentions  attentions always calculated to im- 
press the most false conclusions on the minds 
of the beholders. 
He soon became a daily visitor at Oriel 
House ; Lord Oriel remarked it with bitterness 
of feeling, and became gradually more cold and 
reserved towards his wife, thinking that she 
must and ought to have guessed his sentiments, 
and lamenting her total want of sympathy with 
them. 
Lady Oriel became piqued by the visible 
coldness and want of attention of her husband ; 
and, comparing it with the devouement of Lord 
Delmore, accused the former of negligence and 
unkindness, of which every day furnished new 
proofs. She therefore determined to show him, 
that though he might regard her with indiffer- 
ence, she could excite the most lively interest in 
others. 
Alas ! women look more to effect than to cause. 
They all feel, but how few can reason ! and

THE REPEALERS. 313 
men whose duty, whose interest it is, to reflect 
on this peculiarity, seldom give themselves the 
trouble to think on the subject until it is too 
late. I believe it is Fontenelle who says that 
women have a fibre more in the heart, and a 
cell less in the brain, than men ; it is this fibre 
that responds to " the nerve where agonies are 
born," so that all that women want in reason- 
ing powers, they make up for in feeling. 
Dearly have they paid for this additional fibre ; 
and it is not until age has unstrung its ener- 
gies, that it ceases to vibrate notes of woe. 
But to return to our subject. Lady Oriel, 
like all women in a similar situation, became 
insensible to the observations to which the mark- 
ed attentions of Lord Delmore subjected her. 
They had been so gradual, that her mind had 
become accustomed to them; and, free from 
guilt, or even the apprehension of guilt, she 
was fearless of calumny. 
When, day after day, her morning visitors,

male and female, found her tete-a-tete in her 
boudoir with Lord Delmore, an album or poem 
open before them, and he seeming to think (and 
showing that he so thought) the interruption 
an ill-timed intrusion, the visitors gradually 
dropped off, observing, with a shake of the 
head or malicious smile, that they were de trop 
at Grosvenor Square. 
When Lady Oriel appeared in public, Lord 
Delmore was sure to be seen near her. In the 
Park he was always close to her carriage, and 
he observed, and discovered with pleasure, 
though she little suspected it, that their liaisoji 
was now looked on as established in the coteries 
in which they moved. 
And now was the time that Lady Oriel felt 
the want of some female relation or friend, to 
hint to her the danger of her position, or to 
take from its danger, by breaking in upon the 
daily tete-a-tMe with Lord Delmore. Over and 
over again had Lord Oriel decided on speaking
## p. 315 (#323) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 315 
or on writing to her, but still delayed his inten- 
tion, hoping that she would render such a pain- 
ful step unnecessary, by becoming aware of her 
own danger. Yet still she went on, and each 
day added something to the danger, or if not 
to the danger, to the appearance of impropriety, 
to which Lord Delmore's attentions exposed her. 
How many women have been lost by this 
false, this mistaken delicacy on the part of a 
husband, when a temperate or kind remon- 
strance might have saved them from ruin, dis- 
grace, and endless remorse ! and while a hus- 
band temporises, even with his own anxiety, by 
thinking that parliament will soon be up, or 
that at such or such a time his departure from 
town must break the intimacy that offends him, 
vhe liaison becomes established ; or some im- 
prudence, without actual guilt, commits the 
reputation of the wife, who, finding herself a 
subject of public scandal, to avoid encountering 
the reproaches or cold austerity of an offended

husband, throws herself for ever outside the 
pale of forgiveness. 
The train of respectful admirers that used to 
hover round the steps of Lady Oriel, by de- 
grees dropped off. They became less restrain- 
ed in their manner towards her, when they 
encountered her by chance. And though the 
high breeding of her tone prevented their pre- 
suming to treat her with the insulting fami- 
liarity which marked their conversation with 
others, there was still sufficient change to prove 
to the initiated, that they suspected she was no 
longer entitled to the profound respect she 
formerly deserved and obtained.

We left Jim Cassidy, though somewhat loth, 
spending his evenings at his own cottage, in-

Grace accepted joyfully a sacrifice, though 
she saw it was unwillingly and uncheerfully 
made.

accept of such, and yet be thankful that they

are made ! Poor Grace had sensibility and 
delicacy enough to feel all this as keenly as the 
most refined heroine of romance, though she 
could not express it so well. 
Jim would sit in moody silence, his naturally 
open brow knit into a scowl, and his hands 
hanging listlessly over his knees ; while Grace 
turned her spinning-wheel or plied her needle. 
She used to try all her powers of conversation 
to amuse her husband, until she felt, in all its 
bitterness, the sentiment expressed by the 
French woman, whose irksome task it was to 
amuse a man, and a king too  that he was no 
longer amusable. 
" If it wouldn't tire you, Jim dear," said 
Grace one evening, when she had exhausted 
all her powers of amusing him, and found the 
effort vain, " maybe you'd read aloud to me, 
as you used to do oncet ;*" and a sigh uncon- 
sciously followed the observation.

" Sure, so I would Grace," replied Jim, 
" but the devil a newspaper have I ; and as for 
rading the ould books we've read over so often,

" Well, I won't ax you, Jim, if you don't like 
it ; but sure it is not half so tiresome as to be 
sitting doing nothing at all, with the hands 
idle and the thoughts busy with vexing sub- 
jects. Nothing is such a comfort, when one 
has vexing thoughts, as to keep the hands 
active, and to try and turn the poor troubled 
mind to something else. When I feel unaisy, 
as often I have done of late, God help me ! I 
open the Bible which Miss Desmond (that was) 
gave me, and when I read of the troubles that 
others have had, and think that we are all 
born to ' trouble as the sparks fly upwards,' 
it seems to me that I forget my own cares in 
pitying those I read of, though they have found 
rest long and long ago.'"*

Miss Desmond, or Mrs. Forrester as I ought to

taken from 'em that they'd begin to think 
about em. The grand dinners they are mostly 
tired of ; and sure enough the housekeeper at 
Springmount has tould me that the great 
people took more pleasure in plain, com- 
mon things to eat, on account of the novelty, 
than in all them rich savoury dishes they have 
before 'em every day. Then, as they don't work 
hard like us, they are seldom hungry, and they 
force their appetites by unwholesome things, 
which often makes 'em sick and sorrowful too,

for you'll see ten, ay twenty, grand, idle 
gentlefolks ill, for one hard-working man or 
woman, which ought to reconcile us to work. 
That bright wine too, which looks like damask 
roses, and clove carnations turned into liquor, 
does 'em more harm than good ; and when they 
lie down on them soft beds, with their poor 
stomachs too often overloaded, or else that 
what they eat is too rich, many an hour they 
lie tumbling and tossing, more unaisy than the 
poorest labourer on his bed of straw, and 
throubled with night-mares and dhreams that 
seldom come near the poor man's bed. The 
rich have a thousand vexations that we have 
not, ay Jim, the very best of 'em have their 
throubles ; and as they are brought up with 
every thing so grand about 'em, they get into a 
way of believing every thing ought to happen 
as they like, and therefore their disappoint- 
ments hurts 'em more than ours do us ; indeed,

they feel things more keenly, and take many 
things to heart that we wouldn't understand at 
all. So you see that those, if they have more 
pleasures, have also more pains than us, 
for God makes every thing equal. The rich 
have to think of us and for us : we depend on 
them, and sure a heavy burthen we must be to 
their minds, thinking what they can best do to 
make us aisy and comfortable. All the plea- 
sures the rich and great have too, Jim dear, 
that seems so delightful to us, isn't so to them, 
for they're too well used to 'em to take much 
enjoyment in 'em, but their cares and throubles 
fall harder on 'em than on us, who are too well 
hardened in minds and bodies to fret as they 
do. Then, if grief comes to us, we haven't 
time to give ourselves up to if ; we're obliged to 
work and be active, and that dhrives it away 
from us by day ; and the hard labour, by tiring 
us, makes us sleep sound by night, so that we

THE REPEALERS. 11 
get over it sooner. But the rich, who have 
nothing to do but to think, brood over their 
grief; and sure it 's a sorrowful sight to 
see weeping and wailing in grand rooms, with 
every thing around as if they were made only 
for rejoicing. The very grandeur makes the 
person grieve more ; for if he has lost some 
one he loved tliat shared it all, it reminds him 
more and more of the loss ; and it 's a mourn- 
ful thought to look around on all the beau- 
tiful things about, and to think of the dark, 
gloomy vault where those he is grieving for 
is lying ; for though them that 's gone can't see 
or feel how dismal the vault they 're resting in 
is, or what a difference there is between it and 
the fine houses they have left, them that 's left 
behind often thinks of it, and the comparison 
adds to their throuble." 
" Why faith, Grace, you 'd thry to per- 
suade a body that the poor is happier than the

rich ; but you won*t get many to believe you. 
Maybe you 'd be for telling us that the masther 
isn't happier than I am ?" 
" Sure, Jim dear, it's myself that has no 
raison to be proud any way, when you, my 
husband, who I pass my life in thrying to 
make happy, thinks a poor ould gentleman, a 
rich, and a grand, and rael gentleman he is to 
be sure, happier than you, a fine, comely, 
hearty, healthy boy, with a loving wife, and 
wanting nothing but the spirit of contentment, 
which may God give you! " 
*' Why, what does the ould masther want, 
Grace? Hasn't he oceans of gold and the 
whole side of a counthry belonging to him ? 
Hasn't he a good wife, though she is a Sasse- 
nach, and a fine beautiful daughter ? What 
more would he want ?" 
'' Do you forget, Jim, that he lost his son 
and heir, and never had a second ? Isn't this

THE REPEALERS. 13 
a terrible grief to a father's heart, when he had, 
as you say, oceans of gold, and the whole side 
of a counthry to give him, and an ould grand 
name, respected all round Ireland ? Sure, the 
more he had to leave his son and heir, the 
more heavy must be the loss to him. When a 
poor man loses his child, though he grieves 
truly, he hasn't so many different vexatious 
thoughts to make it worse as the rich man 
has; and he thinks, 'Well, he's gone to a 
better place, and is at rest from all labour for 
evermore ! ' If he 's hard-worked himself, 
he thinks his child that's gone to heaven is 
saved a life of toil and privation, and this com- 
forts him. Now though the dear ould masther 
has the best daughter in all Ireland, still it is 
not like having a fine grand gentleman to stand 
in his father's shoes, and keep up the name of 
Desmond. Then the masther has passed all his 
long life in doing good to all about him, and

now that he 's an ould man, isn't it a bitter 
sight for him to see the whole counthry forget- 
ting his goodness, and, like ungrateful, unnatu- 
ral children, turning against their own father, 
for such he ever has been to us all, and instead 
of listening to his good advice, and following 
it, to know that they think of nothing on earth 
but mischief and repaling ? Och ! Jim, sorry 
am I to say, the dear ould masther is rwt 
happy, and more shame to them that puts a 
thorn in his side ; for what goes to the heart 
like ingratitude from those we've been liking 
and serving all our days, as he has been sarving 
all the whole counthry ?" 
" Why, Grace, you talk as if I didn't love 
the ould masther and the family, when it 's you 
that 's mistaken, for I do." 
"I know you ought, Jim dear, and I hope 
you do ; but it 's a quare way you take to 
show it, by going quite contrary to his ad-

CHAPTER IL 
" It is a busy talking world, 
That with licentious breath blows like the wind 
As freely on the palace as the cottage." 
" Slander meets no regard from noble minds ; 
Only the base believe what the base utter.'' 
So unconscious was Lady Oriel of any cause 
for a change in the manner of her friends and 
acquaintance, that she did not observe it ; but 
it was not lost on her husband, who, sensitively 
alive to even the shadow of disrespect, was 
wounded to the quick by it, and mentally 
blamed her severely for having given birth to
## p. 17 (#25) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. IT 
such impertinence, as also still more bitterly for 
not perceiving to what she had exposed herself. 
Some ladies, who were barely tolerated in 
society, and whose conduct scarcely merited 
toleration,  if the cold reception they experi- 
enced in the few houses to which they had the 
entree could be so called,  might now be seen 
to approach Lady Oriel with a confidence and 
ease very different to the embarrassed and 
humbled air with which they formerly tried 
to catch her eye or court her notice. 
Each day found Lord Oriel still more cold 
and repulsive, and his wife now almost dreaded 
a tete-a-tete with him. Lord Delmore, as he 
became better acquainted with Lady Oriel, 
began to question the success of which, at the 
commencement of his attentions, he entertained 
no doubt. The more he saw of her, the more 
he became convinced of the purity of her mind, 
and that he owed the favour with which he was

18 THE REPEALERS. 
treated, to her perfect freedom from suspicion 
that any meaner feeling than friendship urged 
the attentions which, he now believed, would 
be spurned with contempt, if their real motive 
were avowed. 
How many v^omen'*s reputations have been 
for ever compromised by a belief in the friend- 
ship of men !  a sentiment that no woman 
excites in the breast of man, until she has lost 
the charms that gave birth to other and more 
passionate ones. 
The vanity of Lord Delmore,  that craving 
passion that sleeps not while aught is left to 
animate it,  now became alarmed. He count- 
ed the few weeks of the season still remaining 
ere the close of the session would release the 
members from their parliamentary duties, and 
send them from London for many months. In 
proportion to his doubts of triumphing over 
the principles of Lady Oriel, became his

THE REPEALERS. 19 
anxiety d^afficher his attentions, and to com- 
promise her reputation ; and with the unthink- 
ing sentimentality of most of her sex, she 
attributed this change of manner to his excited 
feelings at the prospect of their approaching se- 
paration ; and repaid it with increased kindness. 
In the unsuspecting purity of her heart, 
how often did she lament that Lord Oriel par- 
took not of her friendly feelings for Lord 
Delmore ; nay, she blamed the former as being 
cold and prejudiced, in withholding his appro- 
bation from one so apparently deserving it, and 
regretted this omission the more, as it precluded 
her extending to him the invitation that includ- 
ed a large circle of fashion at Oriel Park for the 
autumn. She had given various hints on the 
subject to Lord Oriel, but they had been re- 
ceived with such marked coldness, that she had 
not courage to persevere. 
At the commencement of the season. Lady

^0 THE REPEALERS. 
Oriel had been continually asked to chaperon 
a daughter, sister, or niece, by friends who 
were as remarkable for the strictness of their 
principles and decorum, as for their elevated 
positions in society. Lord Oriel had felt flat- 
tered that his young and lovely wife was 
selected to fill this confidential situation. 
When forced by his parliamentary duties 
to be absent from her, he dwelt with com- 
placency on her being attended by one or 
two young female friends, and remarked with 
pleasure, how well satisfied the young ladies 
appeared with the manner in which Lady Oriel 
discharged the duties of a chaperon. 
But by degrees the demands on her to fulfil 
this service fell off, and at length totally ceased ; 
while she, unconscious of any cause for it, com- 
mented in the presence of her husband on the 
unaccountable estrangement of her friends, and 
on their confiding to others, the trust they had 
so often besought her to fill.
## p. 21 (#29) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 21 
The morbid sensitiveness of Lord Oriel took 
fresh alarm at what he conceived to be indica- 
tions of liis wife's decreased estimation in the 
opinion of the scrupulous ladies in question, as 
also proof that she had ceased to merit the same 
respect as formerly ; hence his manner became 
more cold and austere than ever, and checked 
every approach to confidential intercourse on 
the part of his wife. 
Lord Delmore noted all these changes, and 
noted them with pleasure ; for who is so ego- 
tistical and unfeeling as the heartless be- 
trayer, who beholds the entanglement of her 
whom he would make his victim in the snares 
he has set for her, with the sensations of the 
spider watching some hapless fly hopelessly 
writhing in the meshes of its web ? He 
had tried repeatedly, but tried in vain, to in- 
duce Lady Oriel to open her feelings to him 
on the subject of her discontent with Lord

22 THE REPEALERS. 
Oriel. Hints, innuendoes, all were tried ; paral- 
lel cases were described by liim, the wives pitied, 
and the husbands decried as unworthy of such 
amiable victims ; but still, with the instinctive 
delicacy of affection. Lady Oriel shrank from 
exposing the dissatisfaction it was but too 
evident she felt; for though disappointed in 
her husband, she yet loved him too well to 
confess to any living creature that she consider- 
ed herself aggrieved by him. 
This was perhaps the only prudence that 
now marked her conduct ; for, though the 
thought of guilt was still a stranger to her 
mind, scandal and slander were busy with her 
fame; and, like many of her sex, she fur- 
nished an example that honour and fame are 
ViOt synonymous, and that personal purity may 
be preserved when reputation, one of its best 
guardians, has been lost. 
One of the most difficult lessons to impress 
on the minds of women is, the defencelessness
## p. 23 (#31) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 23 
of fame unless prudence guards the outposts; 
and, alas ! this lesson is often only acquired by 
the loss of that which prudence alone can pre- 
serve ; and she who has not violated the laws of 
virtue finds herself condemned as a criminal 
for having been only remiss in appearances, and 
has to weep over a blighted name, while the 
heart is still untainted. 
Lady Oriel had a feminine fondness for 
flowers ; and few days passed in which she did 
not drive to some florist's, to select plants for 
her conservatory or a fresh bouquet for the 
evening. Lord Delmore knew all her haunts ; 
and, without anything like an assignation, from 
which, notwithstanding their friendship, she 
would have held back, he generally contrived 
to meet her on the road, or near the florist''s, 
and to give her his arm while walking through 
the nursery-grounds or hot-houses in search of 
flowers. On such occasions, they had frequently 
encountered many of her female acquaintances.

24 THE REPEALERS. 
whose coldness of manner and evident avoid- 
ance of them were too visible not to be re- 
marked. 
Lady Oriers pride prevented her from com- 
menting on this change to Lord Delmore ; but 
he failed not to draw her attention to it, by de- 
claiming against the envy and jealousy of her 
sex, which induced them to show coldness to 
those whose beauty and powers of pleasing left 
their inferior attractions immeasurably behind. 
He thus instilled into her unsuspicious mind 
the injurious belief that beauty and talent 
can hope for no friends among her sex ; and 
each new instance of coldness from her former 
friends was considered as an irrefragable proof 
of the truth of this dangerous doctrine. 
Lord Delmore's saddle-horses or cabriolet 
were to be seen drawn up near Lady Oriers 
vacant carriage at the doors of all the nursery- 
grounds she frequented, or the exhibitions or

galleries she visited ; and the significant smiles 
and sly looks exchanged by their fashionable 
acquaintances, nay, even by the servants, had 
she seen them, would have for ever humiliated 
the pride and delicacy of her whose unthinking 
imprudence, in allowing such a marked display 
of attentions, gave rise to them.

CHAPTER III. 
" Man is an embodied paradox, a bundle of contradic- 
tions; and as some set-ofF against the marvellous things 
that he has done, we might fairly adduce the monstrous 
things that he has believed. The more gross the fraud, the 
more glibly will it go down, and the more greedily will it 
be swallowed, since folly will always find faith where im- 
postors will find impudence.' 
" Let me implore you, Jim dear," said 
Grace, " to go no more to the meetings of the 
Repalers. It's my prayer to you, and it's the 
advice of the masther." 
" Indeed then, Grace, 1 don't see what right 
the masther has to be giving me his advice,

just for all the world as if I was his slave, in- 
stead of being his tenant." 
" But tell me, Jim dear, when you won't 
take the advice of a friend that has been so 
many years thried as the good masther, how 
come you to go lieadlong, as if you were blind- 
folded, at the bidding of the Repalers ?'" 
" Why, Grace, didn't they tell me how bam- 
boozled we all are ? and didn't they prove it, 
as clear as mud, that all landlords are tyrants, 
and all of us slaves ? They didn't, to be sure, 
say that the ould masther in particular was a 
tyrant ; but, as they said, all landlords were ; 
and sure as the masther is a landlord, he must 
be a tyrant, and it 's our duty not to follow his 
bidding." 
" Well, Jim, a cuishlamachree, only wait, 
and if ever those same Repalers that ^s crying- 
out against landlords now, come to pick up 
their crumbs, and to have broad lands of their

own, with tenants and dependants belonging to 
'em, you '11 see how they '11 alter. If I was 
to see the great estated gentlemen, who have 
large fortunes to lose, advising the poor ignorant 
people to agitate and make disturbance, I might 
think it worth while to listen to them, from 
knowing that if the poor ould counthry was 
ruint they would suffer the most, and it would 
make me think they loved freedom, as they 
call it, better than their great fortunes ; and 
when that 's the case, there 's something mighty 
grand in it  something that makes my heart 
swell and a could tremor run up to the roots of 
my hair, which always happens to me when I 
hear of any one doing what is grand and noble. 
But when I know it's only a few gentlemen, 
followed by a pack of buckeens and spalpeens, 
who have more wind in their lungs than guineas 
in their purses, and have no fortunes to lose 
even if they ruin the poor ould counthry, sure

THE REPEALERS. 29 
then I think to myself, if these gentry didn't 
do something to make a disturbance and get 
themselves talked of, who 'd ever hear they 
were in the world at all at all ? and one way or 
other they must gain by their mischief, and have 
nothing to lose. 
" If the Lord Leftenant takes 'em up, to 
stop their mischief,"' pursued Grace, " then 
they cry out they are parsecuted; and well 
they know that even if the worst men are par- 
secuted, it makes all the people stand up for 
'em, and this gives 'em more power. If the 
Lord Leftenant lets them alone to go on with 
all their disturbance, then they say he is afraid 
of 'em, or wanting to make it up with 'em ; so, 
whichever way that poor English lord acts, 
they 11 find a plan to de9aive him. Then you 
see, Jim, that while they're disturbing the 
counthry, they get all they can out of the poor 
people ; and if they are brought up by the Lord
## p. 30 (#38) ##############################################
30 THE REPEALERS. 
Leftenant, they make a good bargain too; so 
they are sure to gain, while we are as certain of 
losing, and this is what none of ye will open 
your eyes to see. Now as the Repalers have got 
used to be followed by mobs, and to be always 
talked of and made a fuss about, they '11 never 
like to sit down quiet and aisy again as long as 
they live ; so I see no chance of our ever hav- 
ing this poor ould, throubled counthry happy, 
unless some plain, honest-spoken people would 
take the pains to show the poor people what 
fools and tools they Ve made of to sarve the in- 
terests of a few men who are puffed up by am- 
bition, and who would give up the counthry 
clear and clane to sarve their own ends. 
" Well, Jim honey, little I ever thought 
that I ""d be turning my thoughts to such 
matthers ; nor would I, if I didn't see the 
madness of the poor good-hearted fools about 
me ; and above all, Jim, if I didn't see you

THE REPEALERS. 31 
ready to believe the rhaiimeish of the Re- 
paler s against the proofs before your own 
eyes.  Will you tell, me, Jim, oncet for all, 
what is a tyrant ?" 
" Sure, Grace, a tyrant is a great budoch 
who makes his tenants pay their rints to him, 
and thries to prevent 'em attending 'sociations, 
and is always for forcing his advice on 'em 
whether they like it or no." 
" Och, Jim, if that 's all that a tyrant is, 
I don't think any one need mind being called 
a tyrant ; faith, myself thought it was some- 
thing terrible, and was quite vexed at hear- 
ing the dear ould masther called so, but now 
I see it means no harm. Was it the Re- 
palers that tould you this maning of the 
word, Jim .?" 
" No, Grace, it was myself; for as this is 
all I ever saw our landlord do, and they call 
him tyrant, sure this must be the maning."

" Jim a-vourneen, isn't it a terrible thing 
that words, turned and twisted against the 
right nianing, should have power to unsettle

their bodies than brains in their heads. 'Tis 
only necessary for the Repalers to come down 
on your ears with a few high-sounding wicked 
names, and ye are all on fire, never stopping 
to enquire if those to whom they give such 
names desarve 'em. Does not all the world 
think that a tyrant is the strongest term of 
reproach that can be given to any man in 
power r^ and doesn't even the feelings of a 
woman rise up in anger against it ? And when 
the Repalers use it against those that Pro- 
vidence has placed over ye, are ye not worked 
up to madness, and ready to commit any crime 
against 'em ? But then when in cool blood ye 
reflect on all ye know of your landlords, and 
can't find any act of cruelty or wickedness, ye

then begin to think that the word itself can't 
be so bad as ye thought, merely bekase ye 
don't find the badness in those to whom those 
bad names are tacked. Jim dear, you think 
that I 'm tame, and too quiet to bear up with 
courage against bad usage ; you think that 
I 'd be afraid of a rael tyrant, if I had the 
misfortune to meet with one. But you're mis- 
taken ; for, weak and feeble as I am, not all the 
tyrants on the earth could make me do what 
was against my own sense of honesty and prin- 
ciple ; and I 'd submit with all the courage and 
patience I could, to support whatever punish- 
ment they might heap on me, so as that I had 
the comfort of thinking T was doing what I be- 
lieved was right in the sight of God, and that 
my conscience was satisfied." 
" Faith, Grace, the difference between you 
and me is, that the right notions or principles, 
as you call 'em, is wrote down in large letters

with black ink in your mind, and can't be 
rubbed out, but they 're only slightly marked 
with a pencil in mine, and the least thing takes 
'em away, more 's the pity, and the sin too for 
me to be so wake. But you see asthore, no 
passions but gentle loving ones come into your 
head, to rub against your principles, though I 
believe even if they did you would resist ; but 
many strong and evil passions come into 
mine, and my principles melt away before 
'em like butter before a fire, or a lump of ice 
in a warm hand. Besides, Grace, you never 
yet heard the greatest of the Repalers spake ; 
sure, if you did, it would make a difference.

seems to grow wider and wider, and as he 
spakes he grows taller and taller, and the

something very grand in hearing big thoughts, 
which sure is a gift from God, coming from 
the mind in big words that matches "'em ; and 
if the great Repaler turned the big thoughts 
and the big words to stamp notions of honesty, 
dacency, and respect for the laws, on the minds 
of those whom he can so easily move, I *d look 
on him as one that ought to be approached 
with reverence, as using the gift of God for 
the benefit of his fellow creatures. But at 
present I look on him as I would on a moun-

" Oh, God ! my wife, 
The nearest, dearest part of all man's honour,

Of loose mechanics, with all coarse foul comments. 
And villainous jests, and blasphemies obscene ; 
While sneering nobles, in more polish'd guise,

Lady Oriel, with that infatuation which 
often accompanies a consciousness of talents, 
was the more easily led to believe the asser- 
tions of her artful admirer, that the coldness 
of her female friends proceeded from envy and 
jealousy, excited by her superior attractions.
## p. 38 (#46) ##############################################

This belief led her to assume a Jierte of manner 
towards them, which increased their animad- 
versions on her conduct. They might have 
overlooked much greater levity in a woman 
who sought to disarm their criticisms by 
courting their society ; but, seeing her assume 
a still higher tone, which she did from a con- 
sciousness of her own innocence, and what she 
considered their inferiority, (proved as she ima- 
gined by their mean jealousy and envy,) they 
became still more vehement in their censures, 
and less charitable in their conclusions. 
Her select receptions on Wednesdays, hi- 
therto the very focus of fashion, into which 
all its rays were merged, now became " fine 
by degrees, and beautifully less,''"' until the 
society was reduced to so limited a num- 
ber, that it seldom amounted to more than

but the tolerated portion of it. Lord Oriel 
looked in occasionally on such evenings, 
and his face assumed a paler hue, and his 
glance more severity, when, having passed 
through the splendid suite of illuminated 
rooms, he found his lovely wife with her 
small, but no longer select, circle, of which 
Lord Delmore appeared the hero, being so 
far superior to the other men present, that 
he could not fail to appear to great advantage 
by the contrast. 
The love of crowds is one of the besetting 
sins of the English of all ranks ; and this was 
never more clearly proved than in the case of 
Lady Oriel. Three parts of her guests came 
to her house to meet the fourth, and now stayed 
away because there was no longer a host  
" Mocking the desert they themselves had made." 
The few who attended, talked of some former 
satellite of Lady Oriel who had now chosen

her Wednesdays ; the new aspirant building her 
chance of becoming a leader of haut ton on the 
ruins of the temple of the deity hitherto so 
worshipped: and the fallen goddess disco- 
vered with a pang, that all her consciousness 
of superiority could not assuage the vexation 
she experienced in hearing the names of some 
of the most brilliant of " those her former boun- 
ty fed,'' as among the deserters to the camp of 
the enemy. 
It had been settled, before the attentions 
of Lord Delmore became conspicuous, that two 
young ladies, one the daughter of the Duchess 
of Derwent, and the other the heiress of the 
house of Heaviland, were to leave London with 
Lady Oriel, and to remain with her for two 
months. Cold apologies stating a change of 
places, came from the mothers of both ; and 
two of the most distinguished of the invited 
male visitors, on discovering this defection, 
made their excuses.

It was about this period that Lord Oriel, 
having returned from the House of Lords one 
night, and having looked into the drawing- 
rooms, retired by a private staircase to his 
library to write some letters; and while thus 
occupied, was disturbed by the sounds of angry 
voices in the vestibule. He was on the point 
of ringing to enquire the cause of the clamour, 
when the names of Lady Oriel and Lord Del- 
more being repeated with vehemence, he re- 
cognized the voice of an Irish footman, whose 
violence of temper had been made known to 
him on a former occasion, but whose promises 
of amendment had induced the maitre-d'' hotel 
to intercede for his pardon. With the exu- 
berance of language peculiar to his excitable 
countrymen, now increased by ebriety, he pro- 
claimed aloud his disbelief of the aspersions 
cast on the honour of his lady by the foot- 
man of Lord Delmore. He defied him to 
single combat, and in the true spirit of vulgar

recrimination, accused Lord Delmore of being 
a wily deceiver, who came into happy families 
to disturb their peace. 
In vain the footman of Lord Delmore, 
trembling with fear of punishment, apologized, 
explained, and urged the Hibernian to silence. 
The irascible champion,  though commanded to 
retire by the maitre-d' hotel,  aided in the sup- 
port of his official duties by the groom of 
the chambers and butler,  continued to vocife- 
rate invectives against Lord Delmore, mingled 
with vulgar and humiliating defences for his 
Lady, until he was dragged from the vestibule 
by the other servants, lest the noise should be 
heard in the drawing-rooms ; where they sup- 
posed their Lord as well as Lady to be. 
As the most clear and sparkling water can- 
not pass through an impure vessel without 
being sullied, so the reputation of a woman 
cannot be made the subject of menial conversa- 
tion without losing its original purity. Vul-

gar and uneducated minds are incapable of 
judging their superiors. The fine gradations, 
and almost imperceptible lines of demarcation, 
between apparent error and actual guilt, are 
altogether invisible to them. A sympathy of 
habits and feelings renders persons of equal sta- 
tion capable of appreciating motives and draw- 
ing conclusions from circumstances which the 
coarse-minded and ignorant cannot compre- 
hend ; who, judging from self, the only cri- 
terion known to them, hesitate not to attri- 
bute guilt where indiscretion alone exists. 
The utmost malice of the refined never ex- 
tended to one-half the length in its conclu- 
sions, to which servants, without any malice, 
continually go in theirs ; and many a high- 
born and innocent woman has been by her 
domestics believed capable of actions, the bare 
suspicion of which would have filled her with 
dismay and horror. But they had deduced their 
opinions wholly from the laxity of their own

moral feelings, without any malice towards 
her. 
Little did the noble-minded, delicate Lady 
Oriel imagine, that the indiscreet intimacy 
which she had allowed to subsist between her- 
self and Lord Delmore, had become for weeks 
the subject of a thousand gross pleasantries, 
hints, and innuendoes, among the lower ser- 
vants in their respective establishments. Her 
name had become familiar in their rude 
mouths, her husband"'s a jest, and her sup- 
posed lover was considered by them as a 
monstrous clever fellow, who knew what he 
was about. The upper servants, more reserv- 
ed, though equally suspicious, expressed not 
what they thought ; but, contented themselves 
with narrowly observing and internally com- 
menting on all that they observed, wondering 
at the courage of their lady, who took no pains 
to conceal the intimacy, as though she had never

THE REPEALERS. 45 
attached any idea of impropriety to it. But the 
cordiality of her accueil to Lord Delmore, and 
the frequency of his visits, confirmed them 
in the most erroneous and injurious conclu- 
sions ; while she, unsuspecting and pure-mind- 
ed, dreamed not of the dishonourable and odi- 
ous light in which she was viewed by them. 
What the feelings of Lord Oriel were, on 
hearing the degrading defence, and the accusa- 
tion that led to it, is more easily imagined than 
described. He became for a few minutes trans- 
fixed, as it were, to the spot ; a tremor shook 
his limbs ; and anger, pride, and deeply-wound- 
ed delicacy, strove for mastery in his breast. 
A few moments' reflection induced him to steal 
softly from the library ; having previously ar- 
ranged the papers on the table, and extinguish- 
ed the light, so as not to have it imagined that 
he had been there. He ascended his private 
staircase with noiseless step, and it was a relief

to him to hear the sounds of music proceeding 
from the drawing-room,  though they ill ac- 
corded with his present feelings,  as it convin- 
ced him that the clamour in the vestibule had 
not been heard in the salons. He turned from 
the sounds, and sought the privacy of his dres- 
sing-room, to brood over the " food for medita- 
tion even to madness," which the scene he had 
overheard had engendered. 
Bitter were the pangs that shot through his 
heart, when he thought of his beautiful and 
worshipped Louisa as the subject of the com- 
ments and calumnies of servants. How did she 
appear shorn of her beams, and her purity blot- 
ted by what he had heard ! . The stain on his 
own personal honour,  and few could be so sen- 
sitively alive to such a stain as was this high- 
born and high-bred aristocrat,  seemed even 
less shocking to him than the degradation of 
her he so loved and honoured. Anger rose to

repel the blow aimed at his respectability ; but 
tears, of almost feminine softness, wept the 
insult that was heaped on her he would have 
died to shield, even from a glance of disrespect ; 
and whose fair fame, now blurred over by the 
tongues of vile menials, he could not vindicate 
or avenge. How did he wish, with the pas- 
sionate affliction of a high mind unaccustomed 
to give way to violence, that the accuser and 
defender of his wife were of a rank which could 
enable him to meet them in the field, where 
their lives should atone for their accursed pro- 
fanation, or his own death release him from the 
agony it had entailed upon him ! 
At one moment, he thought of opening the 
eyes of his wife, as he felt the absolute neces- 
sity of at once putting an end to her acquaint- 
ance with Lord Delmore ; but the next, found 
him shrinking with disgust at the idea of her 
humiliation at the disclosure, and the dread

48 THE REPEALERS. 
that, with her keen sense of pride, this humilia- 
tion would chase away for ever all softer and 
warmer feelings towards him. Lord Oriel 
never for a moment doubted the actual inno- 
cence of his wife ; but he had often, and sorely, 
felt her want of reteriue in her liaison with 
Lord Delmore, and the impropriety of a mar- 
ried woman forming any friendships with men, 
of which her husband was not the connecting 
link (]r medium. 
With an agitated mind and feverish body, he 
acknowledged the impossibility of encountering 
Lady Oriel until he had come to some final deci- 
sion. His ideas were in a chaos; he seized his pen 
to write to her, but threw it away in despair at 
the first few incoherent words it traced. Never 
had he written to her before except with a heart 
overflowing with love and affection. But now 
what a change ! A thousand bitter, but 
tender emotions overwhelmed him as he looked
## p. 49 (#57) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 49 
back on the past. The lovely and trusting 
bride, who had preferred him to all others, was 
present to his imagination ; the charms of 
infancy in her person scarcely rivalled by those 
of womanhood ; and then " the wife still dearer 
than the bride,'' the fond, the happy, confiding 
partner of his happiest days, stood before him 
in all her beauty. The present, the fearful 
present, was for a few minutes forgotten in the 
past. 
But soon came back the bitter recollection, 
and with it the reproachful question, how had 
he fulfilled his duties to the lovely object con- 
fided to his care ? Had he warned her before 
danger found her ? or had he shielded or ad- 
vised her when it had ? Alas ! no ; he owned 
with mortal anguish that he left her in the 
path of danger ; from which, though she might 
escape with an unsullied person, she could not 
bear away an unspotted reputation.

^ All this his guilty neglect now struck him 
with keen self-reproach ; but such was the de- 
votedness of his love, that it was a relief to him 
to accumulate blame on himself, that a less 
portion might fall on her ; and he felt that she 
had more right to upbraid him than he had to 
censure her. 
Let no one say that true affection is ego- 
tistical, because a few pretenders to love are 
selfish. No ; egotism proves at once the absence 
of love.

" The flying rumours gather'd as they roU'd ; 
Scarce any tale was sooner heard or told ; 
And all who told it added something new, 
And all who heard it made enlargement too ; 
In every ear it spread, on every tongue it grew.'' 
Lord Oriel passed the night in feverish slum- 
bers, reclining in a bergere ; and was awakened 
by the shrill tones of Mademoiselle La Tour, 
the femme de chambre of his wife, who was in 
the dressing-room of her mistress, with which his 
room communicated. La Tour, between occa- 
sional sobs and angry tirades against Monsieur 
Henri, le valet de pied de Milord Delmore, and

a true French feeling of equality, herself with 
her lady in the Nous tous. 
Her volubility met with no check, until a 
slight noise, and an exclamation of " Ah, mon 
Dieu! elk se trouve malT made Lord Oriel 
forget all but that the person dearest to him on 
earth was suffering. He rushed into the room, 
and found Lady Oriel extended on her chaise 
longue, and to all appearance dead. Her face 
had all the rigidity and snowy whiteness of 
marble; her dark eyelashes, resting on those

THE REPEALERS. 53 
pale cheeks, gave them a still more death-like 
aspect; her i-aven hair fell in wild disorder 
over her figure, rendering it more touching; 
and the total prostration of moral and physical 
force which her whole appearance betrayed, 
showed the violence of the shock that had 
subdued her. 
To bathe her temples, to apply pungent 
odours to her nostrils, and to chafe her icy 
hands within his own, were the work of a 
moment ; but it was many minutes ere return- 
ing animation repaid the anxious and agitated 
husband's cares. During which time, with the 
usual bustling helplessness of those of her coun-

moaned her destiny; by turns recommending

woman's remedies in all similar cases, without 
Lord Oriers showing any desire of trying 
their efficacy, she murmured to herself, taking 
care that it should not be loud enough to be 
heard by him, '' Mo7i Dieu ! mon Dieu ! 
comme ces Anglais sojit betes et entetts /" 
A slight tinge of rose on the pale cheeks, 
and a deep sigh, marked Lady Oriel's return 
to life and consciousness. She opened her 
languid eyes, and seeing her husband tenderly 
occupied about her, closed them with a shudder 
that threatened a renewal of the attack. He ad- 
dressed her by the fondest terms of endearment ; 
disguising all his own misery in the hope of al- 
leviating what he knew she must feel. Having 
dismissed La Tour, who unwillingly and sulkily 
departed, he succeeded in restoring Lady Oriel 
to something like a state of calmness ; though 
the wild glance that first shrank from his when 
she opened her eyes, was now exchanged for
## p. 55 (#63) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 55 
the expression of mute, hopeless, and fixed 
despair. She suffered his attentions with an 
air of deep humility, as though she felt she 
was no longer worthy of them ; and his manly 
heart bled for her, when he witnessed the 
mental anguish that was expressed in every 
look. 
Lady Oriel believed that her husband was 
still ignorant of the cause of her sudden indis- 
position ; and the tenderness of his manner, so 
unlike the cold constraint that had marked it 
for the last few months, awakened the deep 
love that had lately slumbered in her breast, 
but which had only slumbered to awaken with 
renewed force. But at what a moment did it 
awaken ! Her indiscretion had brought dishonour 
on his name, had been the cause of the aliena- 
tion of friends, the coldness of acquaintances ! 
All  all was now revealed to her ; and she was 
dismayed when the fearful reality of her po-

56 THE REPEALERS. 
sition was exposed to the scrutiny of her 
alarmed, too lately alarmed, sensitiveness. 
How did this favourite of fortune, blessed 
with all that can render life desirable, now 
wish that the grave should hide her repentance 
and her shame!  Alas! we seldom think of 
death, until life is embittered by our errors, 
and when we are least fit to encounter it ! Lady 
Oriel dared not contemplate the probable results 
of her conduct, and yet she dreaded the results 
less than she execrated the cause; for she now saw 
the unthinking folly of her perseverance in per- 
mitting attentions which the coldness of her hus- 
band's manner had proved that he condemned. 
Lord Oriers delicacy and forbearance now 
presented themselves to her in brilliant colours, 
and in proportion to her admiration of them 
became her self-condemnation. Pride, that 
arch enemy, which avenges itself unmercifully 
when we err, yet cannot preserve us from

THE REPEALERS. 57 
erring, was up in arms in her breast, to oppose 
the flood of tenderness and deep sense of 
humiliation which threatened to overpower it. 
At one moment, she thought of proposing 
to Lord Oriel to retire to the country, to 
the Continent, any where, to escape from the 
scene of her present degradation ; hoping that 
he might be kept in ignorance of the reports 
to her disadvantage, for that such reports 
were in general circulation, she no longer al- 
lowed herself to doubt. The next moment, 
she determined to avow all to Lord Oriel, 
to throw herself on his tenderness and mercy, 
and to pass the rest of her life in endeavouring 
to atone for her faults. 
She requested Lord Oriel to leave her to 
a few hours' repose; though of even this 
temporary blessing, she felt she had at the 
present crisis but little hope. When consigned 
to the solitude of her chamber, she communed

with her own heart; and, while tears of con- 
trition and despair fell over her paper, she 
communicated to him the result of her re- 
flections, in the following letter :  
" How shall I address you, most beloved 
and most injured of men ? how find courage to 
tell you, that my levity and fatal indiscretion 
have brought blight and dishonourable suspi- 
cion on your name ? that name never before 
sullied by the searching breath of scandal  
that noble name which you gave to me with 
confidence, and in which I gloried! You  
you alone, understand me, and can believe that, 
though exposed to suspicion, I am incapable of 
guilt. Think of the bitterness of heart with 
which I avow this, and knowing that in public 
opinion I am dishonoured, I still live, and live 
to wound your peace with this fatal avowal. 
Friends have fallen off from me ; acquaintances

THE REPEALERS. 59 
have deserted me ; and you, too, whom I have 
so cruelly injured  your kindness and forbear- 
ance rises up in judgment to add to the 
misery I feel, when I reflect that I have 
brought your spotless name even to be the 
topic of your own menials. 
" Why, oh ! why did a false pride prevent 
me from seeking the cause of the coldness that 
has for the last few months marked your man- 
ner towards me ? All would have then been 
explained, and this wretchedness would have 
been spared me. But no ; I shut my eyes to 
the danger that menaced me, and, never 
dreaming of crime, disgrace has overtaken me. 
My own dishonour I might bear, supported by 
the consciousness of innocence; but to draw 
shame on you! no  that I cannot bear and 
live. We must separate, though despair is in 
the thought ; but never shall it be said that 
you were the dupe of her whom you so loved

and trusted. My innocence can never be made 
manifest to the world ; and while it is doubted 
nay, more than doubted  can I suffer you 
to be pointed at by the finger of scorn for 
sheltering one who has, in losing her good 
name, forfeited all right to such a boon ? I will 
retire to some solitary place, where a life of the 
most circumspect prudence shall at least pre- 
clude the possibility of future scandal, though 
it cannot atone for past indiscretion.  Try to 
forget and pardon me. 
" Little did I think, a short time ago, that 
I should ever have to ask you to do either !  
But let me not dwell on the past, or how shall 
I bear the present.^ I dare no longer give 
expression to an affection that must appear 
suspicious, if not worthless, when it could not 
preserve her who professes it from the cruel 
necessity of signing herself

THE REPEALERS. 61 
Various and agitating were the feelings and 
thoughts which passed through the mind of 
Lord Oriel during the hours of seclusion which 
succeeded his departure from his wife's dressing- 
room. He never for a moment contemplated 
the idea of a separation from her ; though the 
vulnerable part of his character, extreme pride, 
was painfully wounded by his anticipations 
of all that would be said and thought of 
his continuing to live with a wife whose repu- 
tation was so tarnished. 
But love, at length, triumphed over every 
other feeling in Lord Oriel's heart, and he 
awaited with fear and trembling the next 
interview with his wife ; on which he felt hung 
the peace of his future life, because on her 
conduct on this trying occasion depended his 
esteem. 
" Now," thought Lord Oriel, " is the crisis 
of my fate. If she, believing that I am igno-

rant of it, conceals her position, how can I 
esteem her again ? and yet, so naturally proud 
is her spirit, if she humiliate herself too deeply, 
may I not lose her affection in her own too 
vivid consciousness of her self-abasement ?" 
Her letter was brought to him while all these 
reflections were passing in his mind; and in 
the various sentiments of love, admiration, and 
pity every line of it excited, he forgot all, but 
the certainty it conveyed that her attachment was 
undiminished and the purity of her mind unim- 
paired. The opinion of the world faded away 
before the tenderness with which his heart 
overflowed ; and when he sought Lady Oriel, 
the timidity of a lover was more evident in his 
manner, than the forgiveness of a husband. 
His arguments and reasoning were too flatter- 
ing to her love and to her pride, to be resisted. 
She felt that a separation from him would steep 
her future years in misery ; but she shrank in
## p. 63 (#71) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 63 
dismay at the thought, that when the excite- 
ment of the moment was over, he might quail 
before the strictures of the clique, whose fiats 
had hitherto had so much influence on his 
mind, and regret the sacrifice to affection that 
he was now making. 
Dearly has that woman expiated her errors, 
when she feels that the protection a husband 
affords her, may subject him to the contumely 
of the world ! This dread was rooted in the 
sensitive heart of Lady Oriel, never again to 
depart ; but it lent new charms to her manner 
towards him ; and the gentleness, the beseeching 
love that each look and action displayed, origi- 
nating in the self-reproach and humiliation 
which preyed on her health and peace, only 
rendered her, both mentally and personally, 
more exquisitely interesting. 
Mingled tears, mutual self-reproaches, and 
renewed fondness, marked the reconciliation
## p. 64 (#72) ##############################################
64 THE REPEALERS. 
of Lord and Lady Oriel ; they vowed to be 
all the world to each other, as in the first 
days of their married life ; when in the happy 
seclusion of Oriel Park, they wished never 
to leave it. They thought not then of the 
world, because they feared it not; and their 
indifference was a triumphant proof of their 
affection, because that world held forth to 
them all its smiles. But now, both shrank 
from its powers, for both had learned to dread 
them. It was no longer an admiring but a cen- 
suring world from which they were secluding 
themselves; and bitter were the secret thoughts 
of each, as they reflected that while returning 
to the path of duty, and devoting themselves 
to domestic life, they were drawing down the 
sarcasms of that world which they had not yet 
learned to estimate at its just price. 
In trying to assuage their mutual feelings, 
each became continually aware of the futility of
## p. 65 (#73) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 65 
the effort. In praising retirement, they were 
conscious of the weighty motives both had to 
seek it ; and their delicacy taking the alarm, 
mutual constraint ensued. 
Ma'm'selle La Tour was discharged with a 
liberal present ; the whole establishment was 
dismissed, with generous remunerations for 
their services ; and Lord and Lady Oriel com- 
menced their tour to the Lakes, more devoted 
than ever to each other ; but the very excess of 
that devotion produced increased sensitiveness, 
and dread of the future. 
Had Lord Oriel possessed strength of mind 
in proportion to his pride and tenderness of 
heart, happiness might again have dawned on 
them ; but alas ! he was infirm of purpose, and, 
though not prepared to sacrifice his love to the 
world, he was nearly equally unprepared to 
confront that world in the discharge of consci- 
ous duties, while he thought his actions likely
## p. 66 (#74) ##############################################
66 THE REPEALERS. 
to be misinterpreted, or the finger of scorn 
pointed at his name. He had too much and 
too little pride; too much to be satisfied with 
aught less than the world's applause, and too 
little to be able to bear up against its tyranny 
and injustice. 
Lady Oriel had failed to make this discovery 
in happier times ; but it now came home to her 
bosom, making her dread the present, and trem- 
ble for the future, as she saw that the world, 
the fickle capricious world, which she had nei- 
ther the courage nor the wish to re-conquer, 
still held an empire over the mind of her 
husband, which would render happiness, inde- 
pendent of its opinion, difficult if not impossi- 
ble to attain. 
It has been well observed by an acute 
writer of our day, that " to be satisfied with 
the acquittal of the world, though accompanied 
with the secret condemnation of conscience, is 
the mark of a little mind ; but that it requires
## p. 67 (#75) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 67 
a soul of no common stamp to be satisfied with 
its own acquittal, and to despise the condemna- 
tion of the world." The insufficiency of self- 
acquittal to satisfy the mind, must proceed 
from the consciousness that, however innocent 
in fact, we have been faulty in appearance; 
unjust as the world is, it can seldom wound us 
if we do not furnish it with weapons. The 
world exaggerates, and misinterprets, but rare- 
ly invents. We must lay a foundation ere it can 
build ; but when once we have furnished it, there 
is no saying to what height the edifice will ex- 
tend ; and she v^ho has committed one fault, 
must expect to be accused of a hundred crimes. 
" Ce 7i'est que le premier pas qui coute.'''^ In 
the life of a woman, one false step that cannot 
be disproved, renders every future step sus- 
pected; and the heart-wounding conviction of 
this injustice takes away the confidence of virtue, 
even long after its duties have been fulfilled.

And liberty plucks justice by the nose." 
" Some, for renown, on scraps of learning doat. 
And think they grow immortal as they quote." 
Jim Cassidy returned from his work one 
evening, bringing with him the schoolmaster of 
the village, whom he had encountered on the 
road, and engaged to share his humble supper. 
Grace felt that he did this to avoid a tete-d- 
tite with her, and sighed as she thought of 
other days, when Jim would have considered

such an interruption on their privacy a hard- 
ship. 
The schoolmaster was a simple, honest man, 
only remarkable for a habit of interlarding his 
discourse with scraps of Latin, even when 
addressing those totally ignorant of that lan- 
guage, which habit generally left his hearers in 
doubt as to one-half of his conversation, and 
not quite aufait of the other. 
They were about to sit down to supper, 
when Larry M'Swiggan made an addition to 
the party, and was cordially greeted by all. 
" I 'm afraid you don't like the supper," 
said Jim, observing that the schoolmaster was 
more intent on looking around him than on 
eating. 
" Why, to spake the truth, Misther Cas- 
sidy," replied the pedagogue, " I am admiring 
domus et placens uxor.'''' 
" I see how it is," said Larry, with an arch

smile. " You were looking at Misthress Cas- 
sidy, and by speaking Latin, show that it was 
something she ought not to hear. Far be it 
from me to say, even in a dead language, what 
could offend a living ear, and that ear, more- 
over, attached to the head of a female." 
" No, Misther M'Swiggan, I was thinking, 
on looking around me, that fas est et ab hoste 
doceri, as I remark many clever contrivances in 
this culinary apartment, which Misthress Cas- 
sidy must have taken from the English." 
' Why, then, be my soul, if you knew her 
as well as I do, ever since she was a brat of a 
girl, and before too, you 'd never be after sus- 
pecting her of taking any thing from the Eng- 
lish, or any one else, but what was her right." 
" You misconceive my maning, Misther 
M'Swiggan." 
" Well, all my mistakes come from your

man nor woman of the house understand any 
more than I do, it bothers us a little, and 
puts us at cross purposes. Sure, it's no 
offence I mane to you, for I used just to say 
the same to a Frenchman on board the ship 
with me, going to the West Indies, who was 
always for jabbering his outlandish lingo to 
me. ' Sir,' says I, ' if as how you 're inclined 
to swap thoughts with me, take your choice of 
spaking Irish or English, which you '11 find 
come just as aisy to you, as having to conster 
my words into your own mother tongue, which 
I suspect you'll be obliged to do before you 
know the maning.' He shook his head, and 
said, 'Bait.' ' Bait !' says I ; ' faith, that's a 
game two can play at, and if I had you in my 
own sweet counthry, where baiting is chaip, 
I'd see what you were made of.' Sure, he 
knew well enough what I was after, for he 
looked as mad as a March hare, and after that

we never swapped a word while we stopped in 
the ship/' 
" I think, Misther Cassidy, that your friend 
has a cacoethes loquendi^'' observed the school- 
master. 
" I hope you haven''t said anything affront- 
ing to me,'' said Larry ; " for ould as I am, I 
wouldn't sit by to see myself attacked ; and, 
sure, if you have anything to say to me, spake 
out in plain English or Irish, and don't be like 
a backbiter, saying what's not fair when my 
back is turned, for sure it's all one as being 
absent when I don't know what you say of 
me." 
" I declare to you, Misther M'Swiggan, that 
I have said nothing offensive. I am not dis- 
posed to quarrel, being, as you must observe, 
the caput mortuum of a sexagenarian." 
" Well, there 's more of it," said Larry. 
" Follow on, my ould boy, for I see it 's useless

ing in your bog Latin." 
" Misther M'Swiggan, if you main to insult 
the erudition of which I am but as the mouth- 
piece, IM have you to know that contra stimu- 
lum calcas.''^ 
*' You see, Misther and Misthress Cassidy, 
he will keep throwing his bad words in my 
teeth ; for, sure, as I said before, if they are 
not bad, why not say 'em out like a man, 
instead of disguising 'em in clothes, as he 
says himself, which I can't make head or tail 
of.?" 
" I repate, Misther M'Swiggan," replied the 
pedagogue, " that I do not wish to offend ; of 
this you have only my ipse dixit, which I hope 
you will accept." 
" Och ! sure, if you Ve tipsy it \ another 
matther," said Larry. " Why didn't you say 
so at first ? though, faith, I thought you looked

a little cumflusthered, and seemed dumb- 
founded by spaking Greek and Latin to us all 
the evening, just to show your book-larning." 
The schoolmaster felt by no means inclined 
to allow Larry M'Swiggan to continue in the 
belief that he pleaded inebriation as an excuse 
for whatever he might have said, and Grace 
was obliged to interfere, to bring them to 
a good understanding ; which having accom- 
plished, the schoolmaster declared that he must 
proceed to the Cat and Bagpipes, for the pur- 
pose of exhorting the men there assembled, and 
of opening their eyes to the danger of the evil 
courses they were at present pursuing. 
" Faith,'' said Larry, " if you main to do 
that, I 'd advise you stick to the plain English, 
or, what 's betther still, the Irish tongue, which 
is ten times as expressive,  then they '11 know 
your maning ; but if you bother 'em with the 
Greek and Latin, faith, you might just as well

be whistling jigs to a milestone, in the hopes 
of making it dance." 
" I have already arranged the discourse I 
main to give them," said the pedagogue. '' I 
have no doubt it will produce a powerful eifect 
on their unsopliisticated understandings." 
" Don't be too sure of that,'" said Larry. 
" Sure, they 're already much too fisticated, as 
you call it, for it 's a word and a blow with 'em 
on every occasion, and the blow first and the 
word afther. Sure, it would be well for many 
of *em that they had no fists, for they do 
nothing but mischief with 'em ; but if you 're 
going, I '11 just go with you, and maybe tell 
you what you had best say to 'em." 
" Circus iter monstrare vulty'' murmured the 
schoolmaster. 
" There he is at it again," said Larry. 
" I 'm no more a monsther than yourself, and 
it is not over-mannerly of you to call me so."

" I per9aive that if we continue to talk,'' 
said the schoolmaster, " it will be a helium 
internecivum between us ; but let us proceed 
to the Cat and Bagpipes, Misther M'Swiggan. 
I shall be proud of your company on the way, 
for comes jucundus in via pro vehiculo est.'' 
Jim Cassidy accompanied them to the scene 
of meeting, promising Grace that he would 
retire from it as soon as the schoolmaster had 
finished his speech to *em. " For I 'm curious," 
added Jim, *' to see how they '11 take advice in 
Latin, which they can't understand, when they 
won't listen, or at least won't mind, what 's said 
to them in their own tongue ; perhaps, for the 
raison that they can't understand, they '11 pay 
more attention to it, for, somehow or other, we 
poor Irish are a little contrary whin we've 
got a quare notion in our heads." 
Grace smiled at the truth of the last observa- 
tion, and the three friends departed.

On reaching the sheebean-house, sounds of 
merriment and singing, with loud applauses, 
proclaimed that there was a full meeting, and 
they entered in time to hear the following song 
sung, or rather roared, by Bill Davin, better 
known by the appellation of *' Rattling Bill,'"* 
each verse of which elicited thunders of ap- 
plause. 
SONG. 
Sure, ain't we all slaves in the chains 
We 've taken such trouble to get ? 
Ould England 's the cause of our pains, 
But she '11 suffer the penalty yet. 
We '11 drive all the rich from the land, 
And set up the poor in their stead ; 
By O'Blarney we '11 all of us stand, 
By O'Blarney we '11 only be led. 
For he is the broth of a boy ; 
How to get up a row he knows well ; 
In Parliament, sure, 'tis his joy 
To bother their brains all pell-mell.

We tried long enough with troubles 
The English to vex and enrage ; 
They thought our riots but bubbles, 
Till they found we 'd open war wage. 
Boys ! drink to the great agitator. 
And long may he rule o'er the land, 
For he is the only dictator, 
And by him till death will we stand. 
The vociferous plaudits that followed the 
song had no sooner subsided, than the school- 
master asked permission to address the meet- 
ing, which was accorded by some of the as- 
sembly and refused by others. At length, 
however, it was decided that he should be 
heard. " We know he is an ould tory," said 
rattling Bill, " but what of that ? Hear him, 
hear him, say I ;" and it was accordingly agreed 
that he should be heard. 
*' Neighbours and pupils, for many of you 
are my pupils,*" said the schoolmaster, " I am

Led on by a man who is ever seeking the aura 
popularis, you will pass the Rubicon, after 
which there is no retreat. He is determined 
to be aut Casa?' aut nullus, and to arrive at 
the former, he will make you the pedestal on 
which he will elevate himself. But remember, 
in doing this, he tramples on you ; you but 
support his feet. He is a man who only uses 
arguments ad captaudwn vulgus, and is emi- 
nently skilled to ambiguas in vulgum spargere 
voces. But you, my countrymen, who are

verb. An nescis longas regibus esse manus? I

proves the verity of the old adage, asperiiis 
nihil est humili cum surgit in altum. I would 
call it dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, 
but to be sacrificed on the altar of ambition 
for the aggrandisement of one man  no, this I 
could not bear. This man has established the 
system of divide et impera, and takes advan- 
tage of the power it gives him ; he considers 
you all but as the fa: x populi, to be thrown to 
the winds the moment he has used you. But 
before jacta est alea, reflect on the inevitable 
consequences of following his pernicious coun- 
sels, and remember that gravis ira regum

understand the half of it. He baits out 
CBlarney by three chalks. Faith, the ould 
boy is a grand scholar any way." 
Larry M'Swiggan was mortified with the 
success of the schoolmaster, and still more 
at the folly of his countrymen for applaud- 
ing, merely because they could not under- 
stand. Poor Larry, with all his shrewdness, 
was too simple to be aware how many orators 
and literary works are judged of and ap- 
proved on the same principle, and with this 
ignorance he thought to himself  " Well, after 
such applause, the ould boy will spake more 
Greek and Latin than ever, and there '11 be no 
bearing with him. Now, if I was to spake 
plain sinse to 'em in plain English, it 's ten to 
one if they 'd listen to me, and more than ten 
to one if they 'd give a single screech for me. 
But this comes of his book larning. Sure 
after all, it's a great lielp at a pinch, espe-

daily when it taches a body to spake with 
the thoughts and words of another, and no 
one can contradict it." 
When order was restored, the schoolmaster 
resumed his speech ; " Think not, my coun- 
trymen, that I am insensible to the misfortunes 
under which this divided country has groaned 
for centuries. Alas I longa est injuria, longa 
ambages. But it is not by proving that we 
are unworthy of liberty, that we can hope to 
gain it. As well might the maniac try to 
persuade his keeper that he requires not the 
fetters that alone prevent his injuring him- 
self and others, as for us to expect that go- 
vernment will grant us the rights we forfeit 
by our own violation of the laws. I can have 
no object but the amor patria, which throbs 
in my heart, for urging you to beware of evil 
advisers, whilst he who inflames your passions

up the heat of that mint that pays his agita- 
tion. But cursed is the gold that is earned by 
the misery of the people, and shameless must 
he be, who, while he declaims on the poverty 
and ruin of his country, accepts from that 
poverty and ruin the hire of acts that, if per- 
formed with sincere good-will for his country, 
he ought to be above receiving pay for, and 
if not, what shall be said of him ? 
" Paid patriots, my countrymen, are ano- 
malies that I admit not of; I will believe him 
to be a patriot who struggles against poverty 
and oppression, and disdains to accept wages 
for services that never can, never ought to be 
paid. Of him who does otherwise it may be 
said, vendidit hie auro patriam ; for what dif- 
ference does it make that the gold comes from 
the sold? the chapman equally receives it.

did a monarch sit on a throne more worthy 
to be so considered than ours ? Let us not, 
my dear countrymen, force him to show us 
his power instead of his paternal love, nor 
compel him to give us the ultima ratio regum. 
Leave our grievances to be remedied by those 
who have the inclination to relieve, and the 
knowledge how to accomplish it ; but attend 
not to him who, if we have wounds, puts an

" The ould scholar is no fool," said another.

laming as he has in his head .?" interrogated a

third. " If I had only the half of it, I 'd 
speechify as well as tlie best of 'em, but when 
a body has only one's own thoughts in one''s 
pate, sure how can one make a speech ?" 
Rattling Bill was the first to address the 
schoolmaster, which he did in the following 
terms :  " Well, ould boy, you have been 
chopping Latin for some time, and we 've 
listened to you for all the world as if you 
were a prophet, though small profit it has 
brought us any way, for we didn't under- 
stand the half of it. So much the betther, 
perhaps, for I see by the drift of your sha- 
nahos, you 'd be for thrying to persuade us 
to remain quiet till them English fitted on 
our handcuffs. Now, I 'm of the same mind 
as O'Blarney, that the only way to avoid 
danger, is to meet it halfway, and sure we 've 
been more than halfway on the road to meet it, 
and now is not the time to turn our backs on

ourselves. And let me ax you, what would we 
do to pass the time, if we didn't kick up a bit 
of a row ? Sure it 's the only occupation we 
have, and if we like to give our money to him 
that divarts us, and keeps us always warm 
with the fiery things he puts into our minds, 
that 's our own affair. Sure, I 've heard that 
the grandees find time so dull on their hands, 
that they pay lashings of money to play-actors 
to agitate 'em, either by making 'em laugh or 
ci-y ; and why shouldn't we pay our own play- 
actor, who can do both, and prevents our ever 
bothering ourselves about thinking of paying 
rints or tithes, or providing for the wives and 
brats at home, which we used to be breaking 
our heads and hearts too, to prepare for ? No, 
no, O'Blarney has taught us a trick worth two 
of that, and I 'm for sticking by him let what 
will happen. When I think how, before I 
knew O'Blarney, I used to be bothering the

life out of myself, sure, faith I laugh at my 
folly ; for now when the agent talks to me of 
the next gale of rent, I think that may be 
there'll be another sort of a gale before that 
comes, that will blow away rents, landlords, 
and agents too, and lave us, like the wreckers 
on the shore, to pick up whatever escapes from 
the ship that has perished ; so you 11 find we 11 
have the best of it." 
" But when you see the soldiers and the 
police pouring down on us like a mountain 
floud, sweeping everything before 'em," said 
an old man who had not before spoken, " what 
will you say then? when our wives and chil- 
dren are starving and unprotected, and our- 
selves between four walls in a stone jug,* where 
we may be found morning, noon, and night,

Bill, you '11 wish you had hearkened to the 
schoolmaster's advice, and if you 're trans- 
ported to Botany Bay, or are condemned to 
dance a jig upon nothing, 'twill then be too 
late to repent. Think of the judge putting 
on the black cap  think of the terrible words 
he will spake, the solemn faces of all the court, 
and the wail of the heart-broken wife ; and 
then ax yourself how much better it would 
be to stop in time. Think also of the terrible 
night in the condemned cell  the last night. A 
disgraceful death the passport to an offended 
God  the horror of the present  the terror of 
the future  the grief of all who love you, and 
the shame you leave 'em. Ah, if you would 
think of all this, you would turn from those 
that would lead you into such snares, and you 
would yet be saved." 
" But do you think," replied Rattling Bill, 
" that there's the laist chance of its coming to

all this ? Why, don't you see that we have the 
best of it ? Was the counthry ever in such a 
state of throuble as we've put it into at pre- 
sent ? Fresh disturbances every day, and at 
every side ? And hasn't our laider sent us a 
steel to whet our pikes ? As for our mimbers 
that's in London, sure they're carrying every 
thing before 'em by the force of their speeches. 
Didn't our laider call the Parliament Com- 
mons the other day six hundred scoundrels? 
Sure that's spaking plain enough ; I dare say 
it's the first time they ever heard such names, 
but they'll hear worse before he has done with 
'em, if they let him go on." 
" Yes, and how cleverly he got out of it 
afther," replied Larry M'Swiggan ; " Oh ! let 
him alone for that. He's the boy that can get 
out of a scrape. He said he did, and he didn't 
call 'em such names; and all the House was 
crying out oh ! oh ! as well they might, to see

his 'cuteness. And he said sure, if he did say 
it, it was in the hate of the moment ; but sure 
it isn't the hate of a moment, but the hate of a 
life, that he has against the English, as well we 
know, for, faith, he can't bear to allow any one 
to attempt to govern Ireland but himself, and 
small blame to him, it's quite natural afther 
having had his own way so long. Now, them 
English are quare people, and don't often call 
bad names ; but when oncet they say a thing, 
the}'- never will deny their w^ords, and that's 
where our laider has the advantage over 'em, 
and this bothers 'em. Now there's that Misther 
Manly, that gentleman that they call an Irish 
secretary, which is a bull, as he is an English 
secretary ; now, when he spakes, he never baits 
about the bush, but comes to the truth at 
oncet, and yet the people in the Parliament 
listens to him, and never coughs or laughs, 
or cry oh! oh! as they do for our mimbers,

but keep crying out hear ! hear ! hear ! Sure, 
they seem as if they never would be tired of 
hearing him, and yet he never gives 'em the 
hard words, or clips the king's English, as 
our mimbers do,  long life to 'em, say I, but 
a little more raison." 
" Well, sure," said Rattling Bill, " it will 
be a hard case, and a cruel case too, if we can't 
go about at nights killing, maiming, houghing, 
burning, and flogging, as we've been doing 
lately, but be forced to stay at home and go 
to bed. Who could stand this ? and to be 
obliged to mind our work, and not attend 'soci- 
ations, nor follow the advice of our laider and 
his followers  better be hung at once. Then 
they want to thry us by soldiers instead of by 
jurors, which we never will stand, for we can 
frighten jurors at any time, but the devil him- 
self wouldn't frighten them soldiers, who, not 
being used to our ways, would think our

killing a few spalpeens a great crime, and 
make nothing of swinging or transporting us 
for it. But our own jurors, who are used to it, 
arn''t so severe ; besides they're afraid to be too 
hard on us, knowing that we'*d soon pay 'em a 
visit, and pay 'em nately, for their justice. No, 
no, we must keep away the trials by soldiers, 
for there's no joke, as we'll find to our cost, if 
they come amongst us." 
" We may defy trials and soldiers too, if we 
behave dacently and quietly," replied Larry 
M'Swiggan, " and show the English we have 
raison, which we've never shown 'em yet ; for to 
tell the truth, when they call us the wild Irish, 
it's the mad and the wicked Irish they might 
call us, without telling any fibs." 
" But aren't we in honour bound to stand 
by O'Blarney ?" asked Rattling Bill. ' And 
wouldn't it be a shabby and a mane thing too, 
to turn our backs on him, now that all the

English are laughing and coughing him down, 
and that he doesn't seem to have a leg to stand 
on ? Sure, in honour and dacency we're bound 
to stand by him to the last, and maybe he'll 
come to his senses, and write to us to lave our 
disturbances ; but 'till he does we had better 
go on in the ould way." 
It was evident even from the subdued tone 
of Rattling Bill, that the schoolmaster's speech 
had produced some effect on his hearers, and 
that even in their rude breasts and turbulent 
spirits, a sentiment of generosity was the 
strongest bond that still attached them to 
their leaders. When will the natural good 
qualities of this misled people be allowed to 
display themselves, and to win admiration 
where they have hitherto been accustomed to 
excite only dread or dislike ? Let us hope 
that this period is not far distant.

The spirits of Lord and Lady Oriel felt 
lightened when they had left London, and each 
mile that they retreated from it seemed to ren- 
der them more cheerful. The fair and delicate 
hand which Lord Oriel pressed within his, re- 
turned the pressure; and the renewed tender- 
ness of their sentiments made them feel as if 
they had escaped from some direful calamity.

some deluge that had threatened to annihilate, 
or, worse,  to separate them for ever. 
All this was felt, but not expressed. At 
such moments, language appears too cold, too 
feeble to convey our thoughts, and a look  a 
pressure of the hand, speaks more eloquently 
to the feelings, than all that words could 
express. 
The blow which Lady Oriel's health had re- 
ceived in the late shock, rendered her too deli- 
cate to travel rapidly; but, so tranquilly, if 
not happily, passed the hours, that she wished 
not to abridge their brief career. Lord Oriel 
read to her, and, when fatigued, she leaned her 
head on his shoulder with more tenderness, if 
with less confidence, than on former journeys, 
because she felt that henceforth they must be 
all the world to each other, while hitherto the

waiting for tea, Lord Oriel took up a news- 
paper that lay on the table, while Lady Oriel 
closed her eyes to protect them from the glare 
of light in the room, which after some hours 
of darkness in the carriage had dazzled them. 
On opening them, her glance fell on her hus- 
band, and she was shocked at witnessing the 
change a few minutes had produced in his 
appearance. The hand that held the paper 
trembled ; his face was deadly pale ; and wildly 
and furtively he glanced at her, and perceiving 
he had excited her attention, hastily left the 
room, carrying with him the paper. 
When he returned, the traces of suppressed 
agitation were visible in his countenance, and 
it instantly occurred to Lady Oriel that the 
paper he had been perusing must have con- 
tained some statement relative to her, which 
had caused this change ; but on which she dared 
not, either for his sake or her own, trust her

self to speak to him. Her embarrassment was 
increased by observing that when tea was 
brought in, the three officious waiters who 
attended, seemed to examine her and Lord 
Oriel with peculiar attention. This might only 
be imagination, but she thought that Lord 
Oriel seemed to have made the same remark, and 
that he shrank beneath the infliction. All his 
efforts to keep up a cheerful conversation for 
the rest of the evening were unavailing ; both 
felt their restraint, but neither dared to com- 
ment upon it. 
At each resting-place on the route, Lady 
Oriel observed that her husband studiously re- 
moved the newspapers from her sight. This 
studied precaution increased the nervous agita- 
tion which each day gained ground, and added 
to the languor and feverish excitement that 
was exhausting her strength. His affectionate 
attention seemed redoubled, and he watched

over her with a tenderness known only to those 
who have witnessed or been the object of those 
nameless attentions that an all-engrossing and 
anxiously-excited affection bestows in illness or 
in affliction. 
Arrived at the Lakes, they took up their 
abode at the inn at Keswick, and were more 
surprised than pleased, at finding that Lord 
and Lady Borrodaile, with their daughter, 
occupied the suite of rooms next theirs. Old 
connexions had thrown the families of Oriel 
and Borrodaile much into each other's so- 
ciety ; but a total want of sympathy, and as 
total a difference of taste, had precluded the in- 
timacy and cordiality that generally arise be- 
tween people who often meet ; and left in its 
place a cold and formal politeness, beyond 
which neither parties wished to pass. 
This untoward rencontre was evidently as 
disagreeable to Lord Oriel as to his wife,
## p. 99 (#107) #############################################
THE REPEALERS. 99 
though he took some pains to appear indiffer- 
ent to it, and proposed with affected careless- 
ness not to make any effort to renew an inter- 
course which had never afforded them any 
pleasure. Lady Oriel felt all that was passing 
in his mind, and determined on avoiding, as 
much as lay in her power, the possibility of 
meeting the Borrodailes. The constraint like- 
ly to be imposed by this resolution, was con- 
templated with a depression of spirits both by 
husband and wife ; and they retired to their 
pillows gene by the dread of the morrow. 
What are called presentiments are but a 
knowledge of the future, acquired by expe- 
rience ; and they are seldom fallacious. Those 
that depressed Lord and Lady Oriel at night, 
were increased in the morning by discovering 
that, unless they made themselves prisoners in 
their chamber, there was little chance of avoid- 
ing their neighbours, as the rooms were so 
F 2

near, and they were so continually passing 
from the salon to the bed-rooms, that not to 
meet would be almost impossible. 
Lady Oriel was going to her sitting-room, 
when Lady Borrodaile with one of her daugh- 
ters came suddenly upon her. The girl ap- 
peared embarrassed and awkward, blushed and 
turned away ; but the mother drew herself up, 
with an air of affected dignity, and having 
thrown as much angry expression into her 
small grey eyes as they would contain, which 
expression was turned on the beautiful face 
of Lady Oriel, she seized her daughter's hand 
and hurried quickly away, as if fearful of con- 
tamination by contact with her. 
All this was the business of a moment ; but 
its effects on Lady Oriel were overpowering. 
She retreated to her bed-room, to endeavour to 
calm her agitation before she joined Lord Oriel 
at breakfast, and she had been twice summoned

THE REPEALERS. 101 
to that repast, ere she had courage to en- 
counter him. 
Whilst writhing under the insult she had 
just received, her only source of consolation 
was, that her husband had not witnessed it. 
Her own humiliation, hard as it was to be 
borne, she could bear ; but /^^s, brought 
on him too by her, was more than she had 
fortitude to resist. The Indian proverb says, 
that contempt can pierce even the shell of the 
tortoise. How then must it have wounded the 
sensitive mind of a proud woman ! She had 
now to learn the painful lesson, that we may 
be stung by the marked disrespect of those 
whose warmest approbation could give us no 
satisfaction, and that the bitterness of the mor- 
tification inflicted, is not diminished by our 
consciousness of the unworthiness of the source 
whence it springs. 
It was a great relief to Lady Oriel, to see in

102 THE REPEALERS. 
about an hour afterwards, preparations going on 
at every side for the departure of the Borrodaile 
family. Her conclusions that this event was 
expedited by her arrival, were borne out by 
the officious intelligence of the landlord of the 
inn, who, when presenting the menu for dinner, 
observed that the departure of Lord Borrc- 
daile's family was very unexpected, as their 
rooms had been engaged for another week. 
When this communication was made. Lady 
Oriel stole a glance at her husband, and his 
heightened colour and averted looks betrayed 
to her that he also had guessed the motive of 
the Borrodailes* sudden departure, though he 
avoided all recurrence to it. 
Each new arrival at the inn filled Lady Oriel 
with alarm. It was in vain that she endeavoured 
to reason herself into tranquillity, by dwelling 
on the happiness that was still hers, in possess- 
ing a husband dearer to her than ever, and

THE REPEALERS. 103 
who, however a cruel and envious world might 
slander or misjudge her, was convinced of her 
purity. But, alas ! she felt that the warmth 
and delicacy of her attachment to him, gave 
fresh poignancy to the bitterness of knowing 
that he was wounded through her; and often 
did she mentally acknowledge, that all other 
sufferings would be light in comparison to be- 
holding him shrinking beneath the stain her 
indiscretion had fixed on his honour. She 
even thought that a total separation from him, 
would be less wretched than the state of con- 
straint in which they lived, and the witnessing 
the humiliations she had drawn on him. 
The sejour at the Lakes had failed to give 
them the pleasure they had anticipated, and 
they now began to suspect that solitude alone 
could save them from the perpetual rencontres 
with persons they wished to avoid. Without 
daring to expose their thoughts to each other,

thoughts in which so strong a sympathy ex- 
isted, they mutually wished to direct their 
steps to Oriel Park ; but neither had courage 
to make the proposition, till remarking one day 
some plants that reminded them of similar ones 
transplanted the year before at their home, 
it led to an expression of " How well the 
gardens must now be looking," and a deter- 
mination to go there was the consequence. 
The journey was long and tedious, both the 
travellers being occupied with painful reflec- 
tions, in which retrospections of the happy past 
were contrasted with fears for the clouded fu- 
ture. Their anxiety to conceal such thoughts, 
with the increased tenderness a mutual pity 
excited, only added to the painfulness and con- 
straint of their situation. The sensitiveness 
and pride of Lord Oriel, taking alarm at every 
incident, kept alive in his wife's mind the con- 
tinual recollection of her misfortune, and de-

stroyed the self-confidence which a conscious- 
ness of innocence might otherwise have given 
her. 
It was on a Saturday evening that Lord and 
Lady Oriel reached their home. During the 
last ten miles of their journey they had passed 
through their own estate, and were greeted by 
smiles of welcome, even more flattering than 
the marks of deep respect that accompanied 
them, from the happy and prosperous pea- 
santry they encountered at every step return- 
ing from their accustomed labours. 
The cottages peeping forth from the trees 
and flowers that shaded them, the paled-in 
gardens, redolent with the flaunting pride of 
autumn, the cheerful fires seen blazing through 
the bright windows half filled with plants, and 
the rosy- cheeked children at the gates, watch- 
ing the return of their fathers to share the 
evening repast, all presented a picture of rural

happiness, that for a short time banished the 
sense of their own depressed spirits, and the 
cause, from the breast of the owners of this 
exhilarating scene. 
The unsophisticated joy their presence seemed 
to afford, was healing to the wounded pride be- 
neath which the travellers had lately rankled. 
They were conscious of their power of dis- 
pensing happiness to hundreds  a conscious- 
ness that in itself precludes that deep sense of 
self-humiliation under which they had drooped 
for the last few weeks ; and as Lady Oriel re- 
clined her head on the shoulder of her hus- 
band, and with eyes beaming with love, sought 
his glance, she met a look of satisfied affection, 
to which his intelligent countenance had long 
been a stranger; and for which she requited 
him with a fervent and grateful pressure of the 
hand enclosed within her own. 
The air of busy gladness with which their

THE REPEALERS. 107 
servants welcomed them, was damped by an 
appearance of curious examination, convin- 
cing the conscious master and mistress, that 
the slanderous reports in circulation in the 
artificial sphere they had quitted, had reached 
their home. The demonstrative attentions of 
affection which passed between them,  perhaps 
somewhat more evident now that a conscious- 
ness of their position suggested to them the pro- 
bable examination to which their manners might 
be subjected,  were regarded with triumph- 
ant smiles by the old servants, as proofs of the 
total falsehood of the reports that had reached 
them : and, during the late dinner that was 
served on their arrival, each gentle interchange 
of tender courtesy and kindness was noted by 
the significant looks and happy countenances 
of these faithful domestics. 
Lord and Lady Oriel, in remarking this dis- 
play of respectful sympathy, felt that the rank

breath of scandal had scathed even their house- 
hold gods, and that the lustre of untarnished 
honour and purity, which identified them with 
all around, was blighted. The princely splen- 
dour of the apartments, the treasures of art 
scattered at every side, reminding them of their 
high station, and, alas ! too, of all the publicity 
that high station commanded, of which neither 
had ever before so forcibly felt the responsi- 
bility, seemed at present to weigh them down 
with a sense of oppressive and insupportable 
melancholy. As they retired to their chamber 
through the grand picture-gallery, they almost 
shrank beneath the stately and dignified glances 
with which a long train of ancestral nobles 
appeared to regard them from the massive and 
coronet-crowned frames ranged along its vast 
length. 
Humbly did Lady Oriel, in the privacy of 
her oratoire, pray to the fountain of all mercy.

that some portion of the peace which had 
hitherto blessed her in this happy spot, might 
now be vouchsafed her; and bitter were the 
tears she shed, when she recollected the dif- 
ferent feelings with which she had last knelt 
on the same hassock, then as much a stranger 
to the suspicion of guilt, as she was still to 
its reality. But the bitterness was soothed by 
the reflection that it was only the suspicion 
she had to weep over ; and she thanked the 
Almighty, who had preserved her from a worse 
fate.

Lord and Lady Oriel made it a rule to be 
regular attendants at divine service. They 
went to church the day after their arrival, and 
felt the soothing influence each well-known 
object had over them. They arrived before 
the service had commenced, and as their eyes 
fell on the family monuments, monuments so 
often looked upon, and never without chastened

feelings, the nothingness of all that had lately 
agitated them seemed more forcibly brought 
before them. In the pew they now occupied, 
once sat the persons whose names, recorded on 
the marble before them, and whose memories, 
perhaps treasured by a few, were all that now 
remained  shadows that had appeared and 
passed away, to be followed by others, alike 
destined to the same fleeting existence, and 
doomed to sleep in the vault beneath. The 
same feelings and passions had actuated them ; 
their hearts had beat with the same feverish 
pulses in youth ; and disappointment and care, 
the lot of all, had reconciled them to the 
inevitable denouement of the tragedy of death. 
Nothing so strongly enables us to meet 
with dignity and resignation, the misfortunes 
of life, as reflections on its brevity ; and 
such reflections are never brought so vividly 
to the mind as in a place of divine worship,

112 THE REPEALERS. 
where our progenitors have offered up their 
prayers. We occupy their places among 
the living ; our eyes dwell on, and our hearts 
repeat, the same supplications to the Deity 
so often offered up by them; our ears drink 
the solemn sounds of the same pealing organ 
that thrilled theirs; all the objects around 
have been familiar to their eyes, as they 
now are to our own; and they are sleeping 
the marble slumber of death in the cold dark 
vault, that sends forth its hollow reverberations 
to the sacred music they can hear no more. 
And we, too, who fret our little hour upon this 
mortal stage, shall soon rest with them ! Others 
will take our places as we have taken theirs, to 
pass through the same existence, and to arrive 
at the same goal. 
It is at such moments that we truly feel the 
nothingness  the worthlessness  of all that 
most preys upon us in life, and that the mind

THE REPEALERS. 113 
reposes, if not with hope, at least without 
dread, on that doom the inevitableness of 
which offers the only balm for ills that would 
be otherwise unbearable. 
The soothing contemplations of Lord and 
Lady Oriel were interrupted by the commence- 
ment of the service; and, though occupied as 
both were by its duties, they could not avoid 
observing that all eyes were directed to their 
pew with an expression in which curiosity was 
much more apparent than that bienveillance and 
respectful attention which had hitherto been 
wont to greet their first appearance at church. 
The sermon, too, which at any other period 
would have only claimed attention for its merit, 
now seemed to their conscious imaginations as 
being appropriately chosen with a reference to 
their supposed position. Its subject was charity ; 
not the charity of giving alms, of clothing the 
naked and feeding the hungry, but the greater.
## p. 114 (#122) ############################################
114 THE REPEALERS. 
the more difficult, and more elevated charity 
of judging favourably the imputed or proved 
errors of others  a charity so seldom practised. 
The earnest and fervid manner of Dean 
Vernon, their good pastor, lent additional force 
to the eloquence and purity of his words ; and, 
(but it might be only fancy,) they thought that 
a kinder expression seemed to pervade the coun- 
tenances of the congregation, whose glances 
were continually directed to their pew. The 
service being over, the acquaintances of Lord 
and Lady Oriel, who had been hitherto proud 
to flock round them and dispute their gracious 
smiles and shakes of the hand, now seemed to 
stand back, as if waiting to be guided by their 
pastor. The good dean having sought his 
wife and daughter, advanced with them to 
Lord and Lady Oriel; and the inquisitive 
examiners of the meeting observed, that if 
there was an increased gravity in his manner.
## p. 115 (#123) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 115 
there was also an affectionate cordiality in the 
greeting-, which showed that, if he had been 
grieved by the injurious reports so shamefully 
blazoned in the newspapers, he had never be- 
lieved them. 
This public display of respect from the 
dignified and conscientious clergyman and his 
family, was the signal for the respectful saluta- 
tions of the rest of their acquaintances; and 
they returned home with something of their 
accustomed feelings, though with a latent con- 
sciousness that to Dean Vernon's treatment 
they owed their good reception. 
The next day's post brought Lady Oriel a 
letter from her brother from Ireland, an- 
nouncing his intended marriage. It was filled 
with lover-like praises of his future wife. 
After enumerating her perfections, mental and 
personal, he added, " But I will sum up all by 
saying, that Frances Desmond is worthy to be

the friend of my sister, and I anticipate with 
feelings of delight her residence in England, 
and her entrance into the world of fashion under 
your protection. I know not another woman of 
your age, my dearest Louisa, to whose guidance 
I would entrust Frances; and perhaps there 
are few who would like to take charge of so 
handsome a person as she is. But you are free 
from jealousy, as your reputation is established 
as a beauty, and, what is infinitely better, 
as an unsuspected wife,  so you alone shall be 
her chaperon^ 
The letter fell from her trembling hands, 
and a violent flood of tears gave relief to her 
oppressed heart. The affectionate praises of 
her brother arriving at such a moment, pierced 
her to the soul, and she felt that he too, who 
had hitherto been a source of happiness to her, 
would henceforth be an additional cause of 
pain, as he, like her husband, would be forced 
to blush for her.
## p. 117 (#125) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 117 
" Oh ! how dreadful is my position," ex- 
claimed Lady Oriel. " I bring only shame and 
dishonour on those who love me; those for whom 
I would die to save them from a pang. How 
often have I looked forward to my dear bro- 
ther's marrying, and giving me a sister to love ; 
but now  how bitter is the thought ! my im- 
prudence has rendered me unworthy to be the 
friend of his wife ; for how could I bear to 
have her exposed to any of the cruel animad- 
versions which her association with me might, 
nay, must occasion ?''"' 
It was some time ere Lady Oriel could again 
take up her brother's letter to finish its perusal, 
but when she did, she was relieved by finding 
that he stated it was not his intention to come 
to England for some months, and she was 
grateful at being spared, even for so short a 
period, from the embarrassment which the 
arrival of his sister-in-law, under her pre-

118 THE REPEALERS. 
sent humiliating circumstances, must draw on 
her. 
And now Lady Oriel felt, and felt with 
renewed bitterness, that even the appearance 
of guilt produces situations incompatible with 
the domestic affections. What could be a more 
convincing proof of this, than that she, who a 
short time ago would have anticipated with 
impatience, and hailed with delight, the arrival 
of her dear and only brother, now shrank from 
seeing him, and felt relieved that he was not 
coming for some months ? She answered her 
brother's letter ; and it was that answer, in 
which a tone of melancholy was so evident, that 
alarmed him. The manner in which Lady 
Abberville tore the veil of ignorance as to his 
sister's situation from the eyes of Colonel For- 
rester, is already known to our readers. 
We must now return to London, where we 
left the Desmond family and their son-in-law,

waiting the answer to the letter which the 
Colonel had written to his sister on the subject 
of his proposed visit. This answer we will 
now lay before our readers. 
*' Never, my dearest brother, did I address 
you with such various feelings as at this 
moment, when joy at your arrival, after so 
long a separation, ought to be the only one I 
should entertain. How shall I tell you that I 
have had the misfortune of incurring scandal 
that has blighted my fame, and though innocent 
in deed, has sent me covered with shame into 
retirement ? That I am guiltless, you will 
readily believe ; but how few will render me 
this justice ! Still, ought I, can I, let your 
young and spotless wife's reputation be exposed 
to the sarcasms that the ill-natured world may 
be inclined to throw on it, if she becomes my 
associate ? I shrink from this responsibility.

for, alas ! have I not already brought disho- 
nour on him I would have died to preserve 
from it ? And you too, my brother, will you 
not have cause to blush for me, when you see 
the name of your sister, of whom you once 
were proud, made the subject of defamation ? 
" All that I have borne you may imagine, 
but I never can describe. My husband, my 
inestimable husband, like yourself, has never 
doubted me ; but his affection and unswerving 
confidence, which ought to be my consolation, 
as they are my pride, only make me feel with 
more bitterness the dreadful position in which 
my inexperience and folly have placed us both. 
Lord Oriel knows that the tongue of slander is 
busy with my fame, and that even his con- 
tinued confidence has not shielded me from its 
envenomed wounds. My own humiliation I 
could bear, but to draw shame on hiniy does, 
indeed, fill my soul with bitterness.

" But I have not yet told you what has led 
to this fearful degradation. Alas ! it was my 
levity in permitting attentions; the motives of 
which, though obvious to others, never were sus- 
pected by me until the comments they excited 
had rendered me the subject of general conver- 
sation, and were reported to me through the 
mortifying medium of my own servant. I 
have frequently tried to write all this to you, 
but felt unequal to the task. Now, however, 
it can no longer be delayed, and mine is the 
bitter, the humiliating duty of telling you, that 
you have no longer a sister of whom you can 
be proud, or one that can be an honorable 
companion to your wife. 
" I can never do justice to the delicacy of 
the conduct of my dear husband all through 
this fearful business; but I tremble when I 
think of the mortification I have entailed on 
his proud spirit : and fear that even you will

think I ought not to have subjected him to 
a continuance of humiliation by accepting the 
protection his love affords me, now that he 
alone, besides yourself, believes me worthy of it. 
" I have had great struggles on this point. 
You, who know how I love my husband, can 
imagine the despair which a separation from 
him would cause me ; but the misery of see- 
ing him exposed to mortification and suffering 
brought on him by me, is almost as bad. 
" Your happiness is my only source of con- 
solation. If you wish to preserve that, let 
not your young and inexperienced wife, in the 
consciousness of innocence, be exposed to atten- 
tions, which, though they fail to sully the 
purity of her mind, may leave a stain on her 
reputation that all her tears can never efface.

Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue

Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie 
All corners of the world : kings, queens, and states,

This viperous slander enters." 
Colonel Forrester saw at a glance the 
whole position of his sister ; and knowing the 
character of her husband, he felt all that she 
must suffer from his pride and susceptibility. 
He, too, had indulged in an almost blameable 
pride of his sister. He had seen her the idol 
most worshipped in the temple of fashion ; and, 
conscious of her purity and fixed principles, he

had never for a moment suspected the possi- 
bility of her losing that high consideration in 
the world which he saw her enjoying. But, 
alas ! in proportion to her elevation had been 
her fall ; for those who once durst hardly have 
approached the altar of this earthly divinity, 
were now the most ready to trample on her. 
His manly heart bled when he contemplated 
his still pure and high-minded sister exposed 
to the sneers and calumny of those incapable 
of believing her innocence, because incapable 
of passing the fiery ordeal of temptation un- 
defiled, as she had done. 
But while he grieved over her imprudence, 
and its fatal consequences, how did he rejoice 
in her innocence ! With the conviction of this, 
he could stand forth her champion undis- 
mayed, and he could place by her side the 
wife of his bosom, his own pure and high- 
i^ouled Frances, without aught, save pleasur-

able feelings. Never did his heart yearn 
towards his sister more tenderly than at this 
period, and the letter he wrote her was filled 
with every expression of undiminished coji- 
fidence, affection, and sympathy. 
A worldly-minded brother would have re- 
mained away from the scene of his sister''s de- 
gradation at such a moment, and would either 
have contented himself with appearing ignorant 
of the circumstance ; or have taken the oppor- 
tunity of sending her a lecture on her impru- 
dence, mixed up with some comments on the 
chances of its results extending to him. All 
the possible annoyances would have been dwelt 
on, until he had made her feel that in a bro- 
ther she had found a censurer instead of a 
friend. 
But Colonel Forrester was no worldly-minded 
brother, and therefore he tried to comfort and 
assuage the already too bitter feelings of his

sister. He made Mr. and Mrs. Desmond ac- 
quainted with the letter of Lady Oriel ; for, as 
they had heard the statement of Lady Abber- 
ville, he thought this exposition necessary. 
They were too good, too honorable, and too 
pure themselves, not to enter with warmth into 
the feelings of the writer ; and they named an 
early day for leaving town for Oriel Park, 
determined to contribute all in their power 
to re-establish its mistress in the high station 
which she was so calculated to adorn. 
It has been before stated, that Mrs. Des- 
mond was English. Her connexions were 
amongst the highest and most influential of 
the aristocracy, and she had always kept up 
a constant and cordial intercourse with them. 
The Desmonds belonged to no clique, sought 
not for supremacy, because their due portion 
of respect was accorded to them ; and they were 
as ignorant of the petty intrigues, jealousies,

" envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitable- 
ness," that characterise the circle, designated 
by the pretentieuse and insulting cognomen of 
" The Exclusives," as though they had never 
lived in London during the season. 
The circle in which Mr. Desmond moved, 
has ever been distinguished for the purity of 
its morals, the dignity of its manners, and 
the unaffected decorum of its members. This 
circle is a kind of oasis in the desert of the 
vast metropolis, refreshing to all who approach 
it, and where politics, that powerful leveller, has 
no influence, as Whigs and Tories are equally 
well received in it. It would be invidious to 
name the females who adorn this high and 
pure aristocracy ; but we might make a long 
list, and glory in holding up to imitation 
women of whom England may well be proud, 
though they are neither patronesses of Almack's, 
nor obstinate sticklers for any system of exclu-

siveness, excepting that which regards moral 
character. 
Mrs. Desmond suggested to her son-in-law 
the propriety of introducing Lady Oriel into 
this circle. " They all know me well," added 
the good woman, " and will take your sister 
on the faith of my character. Nay, it is more 
than probable that they are in perfect igno- 
rance of all the vile reports, for they neither 
talk scandal nor read scandalous publications. 
But if they heard them, they would conclude 
them false the moment they saw Lady Oriel 
living on the best terms with her honorable 
and high-minded husband, and that she was 
the associate chosen by me for my daughter. 
The consciousness of your sister's establishment 
in this really respectable circle, will soothe the 
wounded sensibility of your brother-in-law, and 
restore him to all his former feelings. So we 
must persuade them to return with us to Lon-

don for the season, however little disposed 
they may be to do so." 
Colonel Forrester felt the good sense and 
kindness of Mrs. Desmond, and rejoiced in 
thinking of the invaluable female friends,  the 
rarest of all acquisitions,  he had secured for 
his sister in Mrs. Desmond and her daughter. 
The party set out for Oriel Park, and were 
not sorry to see in all the fashionable news- 
papers an announcement of their departure from 
Thomas's Hotel, Berkeley Square, to join the 
distinguished individuals, who were on a visit to 
the Earl and Countess of Oriel. They knew 
London and its fashionable inhabitants suffi- 
ciently well, to be aware that one half of them 
would conclude the other half were amongst 
the guests of Oriel Park, and forget all scan- 
dalous histories, in their desire to be there also. 
Such are London fashionables ! 
When we censure London fashionables for

THE REPEALERS. 131 
the heartlessness and selfishness which have 
rendered them proverbial, the censure is ap- 
plied to them not as individuals, but as a body. 
It is the system that produces the evil, and it 
is only while acting en masse that they are 
faulty. The same persons who in the country, 
removed from the influence of the many-headed 
monster, ycleped fashion, are rational and well- 
disposed, in London lose their own identity, 
and adopt all the conventional egoism of their 
different cliques. They have raised a mon- 
strous idol, whose worship demands a continual 
sacrifice of all the best and purest feelings, 
and they are frightened at this imaginary 
hydra of their own creation. The opinions of 
their circle are made the alpha and omega of 
their line of conduct ; and it is not the wrong 
or the right of such or such a step, but the 
" What will the world say of it .?" which go- 
verns them. Moral rectitude and kind feelings

are all made subservient to the tyrannical 
sway of fashion, and the most ill-natured ac- 
tions are committed without a particle of 
malice, merely because each individual of a 
clique must act as the others do. 
Only one thing can be said in favour of this 
system of congregating, and loss of identity, 
namely, the humility it implies ; for a person 
with any consciousness of mental superiority, 
could never offer up his tastes and feelings at 
the shrine of an earth-formed deity, who de- 
lights only in mediocrity. M*x\dam has not 
more effectually reduced the surface of our 
streets to the same level, than has fashion 
macadamised the minds of her votaries. No 
inequalities remain  ^no elevations to mark a 
difference. All are flattened down ; and cue 
may bowl along through fashionable life with- 
out encountering any more jolts from geniu?, 
talent, or affectionate feelings, than one should

receive on the high ways of the modern Colossus 
of Roads, as he has been aptly named. 
This community of the private stock of 
thoughts and feelings of each individual, to 
the public stock, reminds one of the partition 
of goods and repasts in common among the 
Spartans. There are other' points of resem- 
blance also, which we leave to the ingenuity 
of the reader to discover ; only premising that 
England has arrived at too great a degree of 
civilization to sanction a partition of goods. 
It is only in thoughts, feelings, time, and 
repasts she tolerates a community  property 
is carefully preserved for private use or public 
display, and nowhere is more respect paid to 
the distinctions of jneum and tuum. 
We must not omit to state that which we had 
nearly overlooked, namely, that the habitual 
reference to the received usages of fashionable 
life, on all cases of feeling as well as of eti-

quette, has its advantages. Private sympathies 
and family affection, with all the embarrass- 
ments they are so likely to entail, are at once 
abolished by the irrevocable laws of fashion ; 
and one is absolved from the painful necessity 
of extending invitations to brothers or sisters 
not d-la-mode, or living out of the set of the 
fashionables. " They don't mix with our 
clique,'' is considered by a woman of fashion 
as a satisfactory and unanswerable mode of 
accounting for any breach of family kindness : 
she is innocent  the world alone is guilty. 
How much trouble is saved by this con- 
ventional mode, this true savoir vivre ! Pre- 
cedents are established, from which there is no 
appeal ; and in cases of reproach from slighted 
friends, left-off cousins, and cut acquaintances, 
a reference to the standing laws of the society 
acquits the reproached of any breach des co?ive- 
fiances de sa clique, or of being at all (as a lady

in such a case once candidly said,) influenced 
by private feelings. Yet some of the most ad- 
mirable women, and excellent men, are to be 
found in the circles denominsLted, par excellence, 
the fashionable world. They enter them as 
they would a theatre, and are but as an audi- 
ence; while tliose whom we have described 
en masse, are the actors, who have so identified 
themselves with their roles, that they have for- 
gotten their original characters, and never 
figure but in those they have assumed. It is 
for this weakness that we have criticised them ; 
as, however excellent the performance may be, 
a little more variety would be agreeable. 
Marmontel described the fashionables of his 
own time and country, as " Passant la moitie 
de leur temps a rien faire, et Vautre moitie a 
faire des riens,''"' a description more applicable 
to ours at present, as the French confine their 
fashionable homage to dress alone ; and each

individual contributes his or her quota to so- 
ciety without attempting to dictate to it, or 
establish codes, except as far as regards the 
toilette. 
In Italy, the " dolce far niente^^ operates so 
powerfully on the habits of its luxurious na- 
tives, that few could be found who would 
submit to the trouble of framing laws, or fol- 
lowing them, for the regulation of that which 
they consider merely as an accessoire to general 
society ; and there are perhaps from this cause, 
less heart-burnings and bitter feelings in Italy 
than elsewhere.

" O ! sacred Sorrow ! by whom souls are tried, 
Sent not to punish mortals, but to guide ;

To tell his Maker he has had his share ?

And be my guide, and not my punishment.'* 
In addition to her own troubles, Grace Cas- 
sidy had many friends and relations who had 
fallen victims to the system, into which they 
were led by the designing and self-interested, 
and she had to weep over the consequences of 
errors she could not defend ; errors still more 
to be deplored, because their commission marks 
not alone the want of sense but the want of

principle, two deficiencies which are too fre- 
quently inseparable. 
A first cousin of Grace had been imprisoned 
on a charge of having been implicated in the 
murder of the police-man killed by Jack Dono- 
van. His v^^ife was in her confinement, and his 
first-born child was supposed to be at the point 
of death, when Grace sought their cabin to per- 
form the duties of humanity. 
A few months before, the cottage of Patrick 
Mahoney was remarkable for its air of cleanli- 
ness and comfort. He was an industrious and 
sober man, an affectionate husband to a mild, 
gentle creature, and the fond father of one of 
the finest boys in the village. Every thing 
round them flourished, and they were quoted 
as an example of the good eflPects of prudence 
and steady conduct. But in a luckless hour 
Patrick had listened to the counsel of one, 
whom not to listen to would have been deem-

ed sin ; and ruin and misery followed his obe- 
dience. 
Wretched are those, and miserable must they 
remain, whose religious, moral, and social du- 
ties, are in direct variance. An observance of 
the advice of his spiritual director is supposed 
to be as necessary for the future salvation of 
a Roman Catholic, as obedience to the laws, and 
respect to the implied wishes of his landlord, 
are considered necessary to his worldly welfare. 
When these several obligations happen to be 
in violent opposition, how difficult is it for 
a poor, and well-disposed, but ignorant man, 
to choose between ruin here and perdition 
hereafter ! And is it to be wondered at, that 
many risk and merit the first, to avoid the 
second ? Such was the case with Patrick 
Mahoney ; for unfortunately he, like all his 
countrymen of the class to which he be- 
longed, with a strong predisposition to good,

had no fixed principles to guide him ; and con- 
sequently fell a ready victim to the pernicious 
advice of those who should have saved him. 
In a country where the true principles of reli- 
gion are understood, the precepts of its minis- 
ter must be in accordance with its tenets ; but 
in the Catholic church, in Ireland, where super- 
stition supplies its place, and where moral duties 
are as undefined as they are miscomprehended, 
the priests wield a power as dangerous as it is 
in general misapplied ; and those who yield an 
implicit obedience to it, which in the early ages 
would have won for them the palm and glory 
of martyrdom, have now all the sufferings, but 
none of the glory. Some there are among the 
Catholic clergy who are pious, good men, ful- 
filling the duties of their station with exem- 
plary perseverance, charity, and humility ; but 
they become every day more rare, and one 
dictator can encourage a thousand Jesuits to be

ready to act as his political agents whenever he 
intimates that he has occasion for their services ; 
and what such services as they can lend may 
accomplish, the last few years in Ireland bear 
painful witness. 
Grace found poor Mary Mahoney laid on the 
bed of sickness ; her body exhausted by suffer- 
ing, but her mind still more afflicted. Her 
pale face was contrasted by her straight raven 
brows, and the long black eyelashes, that 
threw a shadow over her cheeks. A dead in- 
fant was placed in a cradle near her bed, and 
her poor sick child was lying by her side, his 
heavy eyes and flushed cheek denoting the 
ravages that fever was making in his consti- 
tution. His poor mother was continually 
moistening his lips with some syrup, and the 
glance of mute, meek, subdued anguish with 
which she looked from the sick boy to the 
dead infant, and then at Grace, spoke more

142 THE REPEALERS. 
powerfully than words could have done, all 
that was passing in her mind. 
Grace attempted not to comfort the bereaved 
mother, for she felt that the attempt would 
be unavailing; but she actively bestirred her- 
self to have the sick boy put into a small 
bed, and kept as cool as possible, and made 
the necessary preparations to have the dead 
infant removed for interment. 
Mary Mahoney submitted to all Grace's ar- 
rangements, merely saying, " Let me kiss my 
poor baby before you hide it from me for ever. 
It never had a father's kiss ; but promise me, 
Grace, that you will go to the prison to my 
husband, and try to comfort him. Poor Pa- 
trick wants it more than I do, and tell him, 
dear Grace, what a sweet baby it was ; but no  
don't tell him, for he would only regret it the 
more, and he has had too much trouble already. 
Tell him, Grace a~vourneen, that I am better,

THE REPEALERS. 148 
and doing finely ; quite reconciled to the will of 
God, and always praying for him. Tell him 
that our poor boy is aisier, and to have no care 
about us. Oh ! Grace asthore, spake kindly 
to him, with your own sweet, mild, sensible 
voice, and 'twill do him good, and take the 
bitterness out of his heart, just as honey cures 
the wound that is made by the sting of wasps ; 
and ochone ! he has been stung, and to the 
quick too. Mind, a-vourneen, you tell him 
how well I am, and give him this kiss for me," 
pressing her pale, cold lips on the forehead of 
Grace. 
The coffin which a kind neighbour had 
ordered for the dead infant before Grace 
had arrived, was now brought in, and a 
tremulous movement about the lips, and still 
more marble paleness, proved the renewed 
anguish of the mother. " Grace ma-vour- 
neen," murmured she, " don't raison with

144 THE REPEALERS. 
me, for I'm beyond raison, my heart, and my 
poor head are so tired ; but do, for mercy-sake, 
what I ask you. Sprinkle the coffin with holy 
water. Now bring it here, and lay it on the 
bed, and fetch me the flannels you '11 find in the 
corner cupboard. There  that will do ; help 
me to sit up, that I may make my baby's last 
bed." 
She folded the flannels smoothly, one over 
the other, making a little elevation like a pil- 
low, and then pointed for Grace to bring her 
the dead infant. When it was brought to 
her she kissed its little face and hands several 
times, pressed it to her bosom, and then placed 
it gently in the coffin. 
" I had hoped, my precious babe," said she, 
" to have placed you in a softer bed, and to have 
made my breast your pillow ; but the Almighty 
has thought fit to take you from me, and I 
submit without murmuring to his holy will.
## p. 145 (#153) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 145 
The thoughts of you, child of my heart, shall 
make me still more desirous so to do my duty 
in this life, that I may meet you in Heaven/' 
She bowed her head to kiss, once more, the 
infant, and then said to Grace, " Now, dear 
friend, close the coffin, I have looked my last 
on that sweet face ; and lift the curtain of 
the little bed where my boy lies, that I 
may see I have still a child left me. Och ! 
Grace, it is a blessed thing to be a mother ; but 
to see the babe, for which one has suffered so 
much, carried away from one for ever, is a 
bitter thing. Then it seems, too, as if a child 
lost, was a link lost of the blessed chain of love 
between man and wife ; but no, I won't think 
this, for grief draws hearts together." 
Grace had the little bed of the sick boy 
brought nearer to his poor mother, and the 
dead infant removed for interment; and having 
made everything round the sick woman as 
VOL. II. H

comfortable as circumstances would admit, 
poor Mary became so anxious that Grace 
should proceed to Dungarvan to visit Patrick 
in his prison, that she left her to return to her 
own home, to demand the company of Jim on 
the expedition. 
When she was quitting the room, poor Mary 
called her once more to beg she would be sure 
to tell Patrick how finely she was going on, 
and not to be uneasy about her. 
What an inexhaustible mine of tenderness is 
there in woman's heart ! Here was this help- 
less creature, with a frame worn down by ill- 
ness, and a mind bowed by anxiety for a hus- 
band and child, and grief for the death of her 
infant, forgetting her own misery to send com- 
fort to her husband ; to that husband who had 
occasioned all her troubles by his obstinacy in 
rejecting her advice and entreaties, and who 
had plunged her in such alarm as to cause a

THE REPEALERS. 147 
premature labour, and the death of her child. 
The thought that he would feel all this with 
bitterness and self-accusation, rendered her 
the more anxious to make him believe that she 
was doing well, for affection triumphed over 
all suffering and selfishness. Affection is the 
true, the only refiner of our natures ; and the 
humblest peasant in her cottage who feels it, is 
at heart more refined than the proudest prin- 
cess who is unconscious of its influence, but 
who would be shocked by an unpolished phrase 
or an inelegant expression. There is a wide 
distance between refinement of the heart and 
refinement of the manners ; and we see many 
instances of the latter, with a total deficiency 
of the former

*' The virtues of others often serve as a light to illu- 
mine our own mental darkness, and to incite us to good- 
ness." 
Grace Cassidy returned with a heavy 
heart to her cottage. The resignation and 
meekness of Mary Mahoney had filled her 
with admiration and pity, and she accused 
herself of not having, with the patience of 
her friend, borne the trials that Jim's ob- 
stinacy had entailed on her. " Oh,'''' said 
she, " what were my trials to hers ? and 
how thankful ought I to be to God ! Short- 
sighted and ungrateful that I have been, how

THE REPEALERS. 149 
have I lamented not being a mother ! and now 
that I know the misery children may cause, 
have I not reason to rejoice that this grief 
has not fallen on me, as I might, like Mary 
Mahoney, have seen my babe shut from my 
sight for ever ? Oh ! 'twas a bitter sight, to be- 
hold her pale face laid against the dead face of 
her infant, as she gave it the last kiss ; and her 
words, and, above all, the meek look of the 
poor creature, made me feel a choking that I 
have seldom undergone before. It reminded 
me so much of the old song of a mother to her 
dead child, which I used to think too sorrowful 
to be true, that poor Mary seemed the very 
person who made it, and it has been ringing in 
my ears ever since. 
" Oh ! sleep, my babe, on that cold bed 
On which I lay thy precious form ; 
I thought to pillow thy fair head 
Upon a mother's bosom warm.

*^ But death, cold death, has suatch'd my child, 
And sorrow fills my aching breast ; 
Nor can it soothe my anguish wild 
To know my darling is at rest. 
" Yes, precious babe, thou 'rt gone to sleep. 
Unknowing all the cares I feel ; 
Thine eyes had yet not learn'd to weep. 
When death thus closed them with his seal. 
" Oh ! take a mourning mother's kiss, 
Impress'd upon thy forehead fair : 
Ah ! why these tears ? for thou 'rt in bliss.

" Sure, there is something in real sorrow 
that touches us all ; but v/hen it is borne as 
poor Mary bears it, one feels that God gives 
us such examples to teach us how we ought to 
bear the troubles He sends us. I hope the 
lesson won't be lost on me, for sure it was one 
that would touch a heart of stone. And there 
is poor Mary in that darkened room, the empty 
cradle before her that held her dead child, and

her sick boy, with his poor burning brow, 
and he that ought to be near to comfort her, 
locked up in a prison  and all this misery is 
within a few steps of me ; and here is the 
brilHant sun going to his bed, and drawing his 
bright crimson curtains around him, just as 
if he had not looked down on grief and sorrow 
this day. How many hearts have ached and 
eyes wept, since that sun arose this morning ! 
and there he is, going to sleep with as much 
splendour as if all below here was happy. 
Sure, it isn't natural ; I 'd like to see him look 
a little gloomy, with dark clouds about him, 
instead of all those gold and crimson ones, so 
that one might think he felt a little of the 
troubles of us poor creatures; and I don't 
like to hear all the birds singing so gaily, and 
to see every thing looking so beautiful, when 
poor Mary has such a heavy heart, and her 
innocent babe is just laid in the grave. But,

sure, I 'm a fool to have such thoughts, just as 
if the sun, who passes over such hundreds, ay, 
and thousands of people too, can mind us ; or 
as if the birds are sensible of our troubles ; 
but still it does seem unnatural to see every 
thing in nature smiling when our hearts are 
sinking." 
When Grace entered the cottage, she found 
Jim impatiently expecting her. " I thought 
you M never come home, Grace,"" said he ; " and 
the house looked so quare and so dismal with- 
out you, that I was quite lonesome." 
" I 'm glad you missed me, Jim dear,*" said 
Grace, " and I never felt more contented to see 
you. Sure, I 've been thinking Jiow thankful 
I ought to be to God, to have you safe by my 
side, and myself too in good health, God be 
praised ! when I don't desarve such blessings 
half so much as poor Mary Mahoney. Och ! 
Jim, it is she that bears her troubles. May

He who gave them, lighten them, and send 
poor Patrick safe out of prison, to be a com- 
fort to her ! And now, dear Jim, that my 
heart is full with all I Ve seen and felt the 
last few hours, let us both kneel down, and 
return thanks for all the mercies we have 
enjoyed, and the sorrows that have been 
spared us." 
The earnestness of Grace's manner, and the 
description she had given him of Mary Maho- 
ney's sufferings and resignation, touched the 
naturally good heart of Jim. They knelt 
and offered up their prayers, with hearts 
penetrated with thankfulness, and retired to 
sleep with more tranquil feelings than either 
had known for some time, and determined to 
set out to visit poor Patrick in prison next 
morning. 
When Grace and Jim liad finished their 
morning's repast, they made up a store of such

provisions as they thought would be accept- 
able to the poor prisoner, and then pursued 
their way to Dungarvan. It was a lovely 
morning, and all nature seemed rejoicing. 
Birds carolled on every branch, and butter- 
flies sported in the air, " like winged flowers." 
The dew still sparkled on the leaves, and the 
atmosphere was redolent with the perfume of 
the wild-flowers, growing in abundance on 
every side. 
They were leaving this bright and beautiful 
scene to enter the gloomy walls of a prison, to 
comfort him, who was debarred from this plea- 
sant sight, and who was kept away from his suf- 
fering wife and child. They both felt this, and 
while it rendered them serious, it increased their 
tenderness to each other. Jim was more like 
the Jim of former days, than he had been for 
many months, and Grace had more hopes of his 
amendment.

" I feel, Jim dear," said Grace, while they 
pursued their route, " that my heart has been 
lighter since we knelt down and prayed toge- 
ther last night, than it has been for months. 
Oh ! if you knew the bitterness of feeling that 
while the lips are addressing God, the heart is 
beating for one that seems to forget Him ! 
Many 's the time I Ve got up from my knees, 
fearful of offending with lip-prayers, when my 
whole soul has been with you ; and, oh I the 
frightful thoughts that have come into my mind. 
I used to imagine, Jim, that if by prayers 
and good works I could merit Heaven, what a 
terrible thing it would be for me to be there 
without you; and the idea of our being- 
separated in the next world, was so fearful to 
me, that I have been afraid to pray. But then 
I considered in myself, and I came to the 
resolution to do all the good I could, and 
always to pray for you ; and since then my

mind has been easier, and I find I can give my 
whole thoughts to the prayers when they are 
offered for you ; whereas, when I prayed for 
myself, my thoughts were going after you. 
Jim, how completely a poor woman's happiness 
here and hereafter depends on her husband ! 
God forgive me, for I know it''s a terrible sin 
and weakness, but I'd lose the courage to 
pray if I thought you and I would not be 
united in the next world. So you see a man 
has a double sin to answer for when he neglects 
his religion, for he risks his own soul, and his 
poor wife's too." 
" Well, Grace, I give you my hand and 
word that, with the blessing of God, I '11 never 
miss joining with you in prayers for the future, 
for what you've just tould me shows your 
own fond loving heart so plain, that I 'd be a 
brute if I could let you have such thoughts

when I may prevent 'em by doing my duty. 
Sure, Grace, there 's something in a good 
woman that 's holy and purifying, and if all 
women were like you and Mary Mahoney, the 
world would be better. The only wonder is, 
how poor Patrick and I could ever be such weak 
fools as to vex ye day after day. God forgive 
us for our neglect, and keep us from doing the 
like again ! It 's a quare thing, Grace, but so 
it is, that whenever you spake to me from your 
head, that is when you spake plain raison to 
me, I don't mind it a bit ; but when you 
spake to me from your heart, I *'m ready to 
do anything you ask me, for my heart un- 
derstands yours just as if they were twins  
but the heads don't agree at all; so when 
you want to get good of me, don't spake from 
the head, for I 'm no great hand at raison- 
ing, and am very contrairy likewise, but the

heart is right after all, and besides, Grace, 
that 's your own, so you may do as you like 
with it." 
Jim and Grace arrived at Dungarvan, and 
sought the prison, where, after some hesitation, 
they were admitted, and allowed to see the 
poor prisoner.

Old Play. 
After passing through various corridors, 
attended by the turnkey, whose services they 
retained by a present, they arrived at the door 
of the cell in which Patrick Mahoney was con- 
fined. 
" Well," exclaimed Grace, " what an im- 
mense place the gaol is, and what thick walls 
and gloomy passages ! Sure it 's a curious 
thing, if the country is so poor as people say, 
that they can afford to build such large strong

prisons; maybe half what it cost to build it 
would keep more than half the prisoners out of 
it. Sure it''s a sign they must have great call 
for 'em ; and, you see, it would make ten of 
the parish church." 
These reflections were uttered to Jim while 
they passed through the corridors ; but when, 
arrived at the door, Grace saw the turnkey fit 
in the ponderous key to the lock, and remove 
the chain that crossed the door, the sound 
grated harshly on her ear, and she involuntarily 
shuddered. 
" Here are some friends come to visit you, 
Mahoney," said the turnkey. " The ould saying 
goes, that people don't like to see friends in 
distress, and that 's the I'aison they never come 
to 'em in prison ; but I 'm sure the two 
that's come to see you are friends, and real 
friends too ; so I '11 leave you together." And, 
pushing them in, he closed the door, and they

THE REPEALERS. 161 
heard him bolt and lock it again on the 
outside. 
Patrick Mahoney was sitting on the side of 
his wretched bed, the only piece of furniture in 
the cell that could serve as substitute for a 
chair. He laid down the book he had been 
reading, and advanced to meet Grace and Jim. 
He was pale and haggard, with a care-worn 
aspect, as if he had been months, instead of 
only a few days, the inmate of a prison. He 
was unshaved, and his dark beard made his 
haggard paleness appear still more striking. 
" Neighbours," said he, embracing them 
both, " this is a dismal place you behold 
me in, and it's only kind and constant friends 
like yourselves that would come here. Have 
you seen my poor woman, Grace Cassidy ?" 
continued he, a tear starting to his eye as he 
spoke ; " and my poor boy, that was ill in the 
fever, when they tore me away from 'em. As

for Mary, she always thries to make light of 
her own sufferings ; and when I got frightened 
at seeing the terrible paleness that came over 
her face, and the twitching about her mouth, 
when they were dragging me away, sure she 
cried out to me that she was not ill at all, and 
that it was only a stitch in her chest, that was 
gone in a minute.  Her face, just as she looked 
that moment, is always before my eyes, and I 
have not the courage of a mouse to bear up 
against all the frightful thoughts that keep 
coming into my head about her." 
Grace broke to him the real state of his wife 
and child, and the death of the infant, with 
all the kind and consolatory expressions she 
could use, and delivered the messages of poor 
Mary ; but nothing could soften the bitter- 
ness of Patrick Mahoney's grief, as he felt that 
he had brought all those troubles on his wife. 
Tears chased each other down his cheeks, and

THE REPEALERS. 163 
he accused himself with vehemence of having 
caused the death of his infant, and probably 
that of his wife and son. 
"Oh! Grace Cassidy," said he, in answer 
to Grace's attempts at consoling him, " it 's no 
use talking; sure I know and feel I'm the 
cause of it all. Has not that blessed creature, 
for blessed she is, been advising me for months 
and months not to go against my landlord, and 
not to be attending the meetings or following the 
Repalers ? and she warned me of all that would 
happen ; but I, like a brute and a fool, wouldn't 
listen to her, though I beheld her getting paler 
and thinner every day ; and you see how her 
words are come thrue ! There she is, in her 
solitary cabin, on the bed of sickness and sorrow, 
to which my folly has brought her ; and I locked 
up here, without being able to go and nurse 
her, and half-maddened by the dismal thoughts 
that comes into my head continually."
## p. 164 (#172) ############################################
164 THE REPEALERS. 
Fresh bursts of tears and sobs followed each 
exclamation of Patrick, which were shared by 
his two friends, who left no means untried to 
comfort the afflicted and heart-broken man. 
Grace assured him that she would go and see 
Mary every day, and that she should want for 
nothing; that they would take back cooling 
draughts for the child, and whatever the doctor 
thought would be best for Mary ; but that, 
unless they could tell her that they left Patrick 
resigned to the will of God, no medicine v/ould 
do her good : and this argument had more in- 
fluence on Patrick than all the others. 
He dried his eyes, and said to Grace, " Och ! 
I never was desarving of Mary. Never did she 
give me a cross word or a sour look, though 
many 's the time I desarved both ; and when- 
ever throuble came on us, and mostly always of 
my bringing on, she bore it so patiently, and 
was always only thinking how she should com-

THE REPEALERS. 165 
fort me, and never remembering herself. Only 
once she spoke of herself, and how often her 
words come into my mind since I have been 
here ! ' Patrick dear,' said she, ' I could bear 
anything; but to have you taken away from 
me, to see violent hands laid upon you, oh ! I 'm 
afraid it would kill me ! and then I know your 
good heart would make you be always blaming 
yourself, and even in death this would throuble 
me.' Yet after all this good advice, I went on, 
without minding it. 
" Och ! Grace," continued the poor man, 
after a pause, " when will the terrible effects 
of my folly and bad conduct be over ? I am 
committed here on the suspicion of a murder, 
a suspicion that never could have fallen on me 
had I not been known to keep irregular and 
improper hours; and now I have murdered 
my own child, and am killing its mother, 
by that most cruel death, a breaking heart.
## p. 166 (#174) ############################################
166 THE REPEALERS. 
Good as Mary is, and sure such goodness was 
never surpassed on earth, how can she ever look 
at me without thinking that I caused the loss of 
the child that we both looked forward to as a 
new tie to bind us to each other ? How can I 
comfort her for the throuble I Ve brought on 
her ? and when she thinks of her baby, and often 
will she think of it, won't the thought be mixed 
with the cause of its death ?  I am that cause.'' 
Grace said all that kindness and pity could 
prompt to console the sorrow and lighten the 
remorse of Patrick, and left him not until she 
had succeeded in reconciling him to himself.

CHAPTER XIII. 
Adversity, 'tis thine to prove 
The truth of friendship, or of love; 
Thy frown can send the false away, 
But makes the faithful nearer stay ; 
Thy chilling breath illusion rends, 
And is too cold for summer friends. 
Old Fable. 
The meeting between Colonel Forrester and 
his party with Lord and Lady Oriel, was mark- 
ed by the most affectionate cordiality ; the 
pale cheek, chastened expression of counte- 
nance, and timid manner of Lady Oriel in- 
creased the tenderness of her brother, and the 
deep interest she excited in the rest of his new

family. Mrs. Forrester and she became friends 
and sisters in heart, and perhaps it would be 
difficult to find two women so calculated to 
understand and appreciate each other. Young, 
handsome, and highly accomplished, married 
to men to whom they were fondly attached, 
and without any of the pretensions or rivalry 
that in general clouds the friendship of women 
so much as to render it apocryphal, they 
quickly formed an attachment that promised 
to be as durable, as it was sincere. 
The whole party soon felt as much at home 
with each other, as if they had been acquainted 
all their lives. Mr. Desmond accompanied 
Lord Oriel over his farms, and witnessed the 
improvements in progress ; and Mrs. Desmond 
drove or walked out with Lady Oriel and Mrs. 
Forrester in the beautiful park or its environs. 
The evenings were passed in cheerful conver- 
sation, enlivened by music, and the hours flew^

THE REPEALERS. 169 
with a rapidity only known to those with 
highly cultivated minds, and in congenial 
society. 
It was evident that the arrival of the party 
had produced the happiest effects on the master 
and mistress of Oriel Park. Lord Oriel, in wit- 
nessing the cordiality and admiration evinced 
by the mother and daughter towards his wife, 
gained more confidence, and was enabled to 
look forward to lier future position with less 
dread. Morning calls from all the distinguish- 
ed families in the neighbourhood poured in on 
them ; and the presence of two such irreproach- 
able women as Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. For- 
rester, failed not to have a great weight in re- 
establishing Lady Oriel in her former position. 
Colonel Forrester suggested to his sister the 
propriety of her giving frequent dinners; and a 
splendid ball, to which all the ball-going peo- 
ple in the vicinity were invited, was as numer- 
VOL. II. I
## p. 170 (#178) ############################################
170 THE REPEALERS. 
ously attended as any fete Lady Oriel had ever 
given in former days. 
At the first commencement of this series of 
entertainments, Lord Oriel betrayed a nervous 
anxiety, as if he doubted their success ; and the 
manner of Lady Oriel showed a timidity that 
denoted she no longer felt certain, as formerly, 
that she could not fail to please. Colonel For- 
rester observed this apprehension, and, with his 
knowledge of the world, felt and declared that 
all such indications of a consciousness of having 
been placed in a false position, must be sub- 
dued, and an air of unembarrassed ease and 
cheerfulness assumed. 
" But, my dearest brother," said Lady Oriel, 
" I feel so alarmed, knowing the frightful 
things that were said and believed of me, that 
though innocent, I am always afraid of ob- 
serving some incivility or slight in the persons 
who approach me ; and when they are kind, I
## p. 171 (#179) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 171 
am so grateful, and think their conduct so 
good-natured, that I can scarcely conceal what 
is passing in my mind, or preserve the same 
ease of manner, as in past times."' 
" I can understand your discomfort, dear 
Louisa,'' replied Colonel Forrester ; " and, 
with your delicacy, and sensitiveness, it is 
but natural you should feel as you do. But, 
believe me, the world will always remember 
the reports in question still more, by your 
exposition of any consciousness of their ever 
having existed. Receive, with dignified equa- 
nimity, the respect and attention due to your 
station, and which you feel you have not really 
forfeited, however appearances may have been 
against you. But beware of showing either 
timidity or gratitude, or you will be oftener 
compelled to suffer from the first, than to have 
cause for the second." 
Each week brought an increase of visiters

to Oriel Park, and its susceptible master no 
longer had cause to be nervous about the re- 
ception of his wife, in his own county at least. 
Lady Oriel rejoiced, for his sake much more 
than for her own, in having recovered her 
place in society ; for the great world, or rather 
the circles of fashion that compose it, had lost 
all charms for her, from the moment she had 
experienced its frowns, and she only wished her 
husband could be as independent of it as she 
was. She felt that a happy home with a few 
chosen friends, like those at present around her, 
was preferable to all the gaiety and splendour 
of a London life ; and she ceased to value the 
admiration she had hitherto so much desired to 
excite. 
Every trial with which we are visited in life, 
however severely it may be felt at the time, 
brings with it a corrective for some error,  
correctives, that alas ! all of us but too much
## p. 173 (#181) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 173 
require. Lady Oriel had suffered severely, and 
was chastened, but not soured, by the lesson she 
had received. In ceasing to seek admiration, 
she had learned to merit esteem ; and if she 
became a less fascinating, she became a more 
estimable woman. 
If, a few days before the arrival of her bro- 
ther and his party, any one had told Lady 
Oriel how advantageous its results would be 
in assisting her to regain her place in society, 
she would have doubted, or at least have not 
believed, the extent and the rapidity with 
which this object would be accomplished ; the 
anticipation would have appeared too flattering 
to her hopes. 
But now that it was achieved, was she as 
happy as might be expected ? Alas ! no ; ex- 
perience had taught her the little value to be 
attached to the occupations and amusements 
that had hitherto filled up her time, and had

174 THE REPEALERS. 
also laid open to her the undue importance 
her husband placed on that fickle and hollow 
circle, denominated, par excellence, the fashion- 
able world. She saw that on this foundation 
of sand, Lord Oriel was still disposed to build 
his and her happiness ; and she felt grieved 
that he could not, like her, choose a more solid 
foundation. Loving her husband as she now 
did, even with more tenderness than ever, this 
want of sympathy was mortifying to her ; and 
she trembled as she reflected, that not on her 
future conduct, but on her reception by the 
fashionable world in London, would the tran- 
quillity of her husband solely depend. 
" Could we change situations," said Lady 
Oriel to herself, '* and that he, without a crime, 
had been censured and condemned by the 
world, should I refer to that world for peace 
of mind ? No, once assured of his honour, 
and possessing his undivided affection, I would
## p. 175 (#183) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 175 
abandon the circle which had doubted him, and 
proudly confine myself to the narrow one of 
chosen friends, who knew how to estimate him." 
The quickness of perception of Lady Oriel 
had led her to detect every symptom of the 
thoughts and feelings of her husband ; and her 
heart sickened when she observed his nervous 
anxiety to ascertain the effect her presence 
produced in the society around them. To 
a woman of a proud and delicate mind, 
nothing is more humiliating than to observe 
in a husband the semblance of an appeal 
to the opinions of others in the estimation he 
forms of his happiness, or of the sources of it. 
She wished Lord Oriel to be happy, without 
any reference to the uncertain criterion of 
fashionable award ; and she was jealously alive 
to the conviction, now forced on her mind, that 
never would he be happy unless he saw her 
reinstated in the same brilliant position she

176 THE REPEALERS. 
had formerly held, and which her pride shrank 
from ever again stooping to seek, while her 
feelings yet rankled under the indignity she 
had experienced. 
The agreeable manners and excellent qua- 
lities of the Desmonds and Forresters rendered 
them universally beloved and respected by all 
the visiting circle in the vicinity of Oriel Park. 
They were so cordially pressed to prolong their 
visit, that they consented to remain until 
March, when Lord and Lady Oriel intended 
to go to London for the season, and Mr. 
and Mrs. Desmond decided on opening their 
splendid mansion on an extensive scale of hos- 
pitality, for the alleged purpose of making 
their son-in-law personally acquainted with the 
large circle of their acquaintance, but really 
much more with the intention of establishing 
Lady Oriel in that circle. The delicate tact of 
Mrs. Desmond had prevented her ever touching
## p. 177 (#185) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 177 
on the subject ; but Colonel Forrester, who was 
in the secret, observing the alarm and timidity 
with which his sister contemplated her return 
to London, acquainted her with the project of 
Mrs. Desmond, and assured her that, from the 
influence and popularity of that lady, it was 
certain of being crowned with success. 
How grateful did Lady Oriel feel for such 
true, such rare proofs of friendship ; and how 
did she thank her brother, to whom she fell 
she owed it, while he disclaimed all thanks by 
saying  "I cannot allow you, my dearest 
Louisa, to think you owe the aifectionate 
friendship of my wife and her mother to me ; 
you are only indebted to me for the acquaint- 
ance. Your own merits alone have secured 
you their love, and as they are as sincere as 
they are warm in their attachments, you may 
calculate on them for life. There is this differ- 
ence between them and the persons who com- 
I 5

pose the fashionable world, that no evil rumour 
could be for a moment credited by the first, 
and there is no extent of evil to which the cre- 
dulity of the last will not lend a willing ear. 
Such is the difference between true friends and 
worldly ones, between good people and people 
of fashion, and from the simple reason that 
each judges from self." 
Lady Oriel conducted her amiable friends to 
the cottages that were scattered in the vicinity 
of Oriel Park, where her presence never failed 
to dispense gladness ; and when Mrs. Desmond 
and her daughter saw the cleanliness and com- 
fort that pervaded the domestic economy of 
these humble dwellings, where good order, and 
a scrupulous attention to neatness, marked the 
habits of their inhabitants, they sighed at 
the contrast offered to them in the cottages 
round Springmount, which, with the exception 
of that of Grace Cassidy and Mary Mahoney,

THE REPEALERS, 179 
presented melancholy proofs of the often- 
repeated fact, that Ireland is a century behind 
England in civilization. 
Encouragement had not been wanting on the 
parts of Mrs. Desmond and her daughter, to 
induce the lower orders in their neighbour- 
hood to adopt the improvements and comforts 
common to the English peasantry. At their 
jwn expense they had chimneys built, instead 
of the old mode of a hole, with a parapet of 
dried mud round it, to let out the smoke ; and 
they had glazed windows made to open, to sup- 
ply the place of the small square of bull's-eye 
glass, that admitted but little light, and no air. 
They had brick floors, instead of the unequal 
mud ones, half-filled with lodgments of water, 
and the roofs were ceiled to keep out. vermin, 
and prevent their being, as heretofore, the re- 
ceptacles of typhus, the vapours of which had 
lodged in the unceiled thatch. These improve-

ments had been effected, with considerable ex- 
pense to the excellent owners of Springmount, 
but had failed, except in a few instances, to 
answer the desired end  of giving the peasantry 
a taste for comfort and cleanliness. 
" Sure, the chimney carries off all the hate 
of the fire with the smoke," said old Madge 
Casey, " and the cabin isn't half so warm as it 
used to be ; and then thim plaguy windows lets 
in so much light, that if there is a speck of 
dirt, they shows it ; besides, they Ve so aisily 
broken, and then the misthress and the young 
lady are vexed if we fill up the broken pane 
with a wisp of straw or ould rags, as we used 
to do with the ould windows. The floor, too, 
is so hard to the feet, and must be claned conti- 
nually ; and as for the roof, sure, it's as could 
as ice, and as white and shining too, and keeps 
none of the hate in, as you may see by its 
having none of the marks of the smoke on it.
## p. 181 (#189) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 181 
Och ! it 's not to be compared to the elegant 
roofs we had before, with the sticks across for 
the hens to roost in ; and sure it was so com- 
fortable to have all the cocks and hens over our 
heads, crowing and fighting, and the pigs rout- 
ing on the floor, and muddling in the lochs of 
water running here and there between our legs, 
and putting their snouts into the iron-pots, 
just as if they were their own throufFs, and that 
they knew they had the best right to 'em, as 
sure they certainly had, for they were the rale 
rint payers. But now every thing is changed, 
and they want to make us English, which they 
never can do, barring we 're born over again ; 
and sure it 's a pity they won't let us be com- 
fortable in our own way. Sure, them English 
must work like galley slaves, or niggers, merely 
to keep the house clane ; and what fools they 
must be to be thinking of the comforts of the 
house, as if it was a Christian, instead of think-

18^ THE REPEALERS. 
ing of their own. I dare say the ladies did it 
all for the best ; but we Ve never had a bit of 
pace or comfort since we took to their English 
ways ; and as for the poor pigs, sure they Ve so 
lonesome and low-spirited since they 're kept in 
their styes, instead of having the run of the 
house, that it 's dismal to hear the moaning 
and grunting of 'em. The poor cocks and 
hens, too, are quite on the shockarone ; and the 
young ducks and goslings, that used to be so 
happy, swimming in the little ponds of muddy 
water in the floor, are now straying about as if 
they didn't know what to do with themselves. 
Och ! it's a dismal thing to see a family scat- 
tered about in such a manner, that used to be 
all happy and comfortable under the same roof, 
fattening and thriving together on the same 
victual, and, as a body might say, having but 
the same bed and the same board. God for- 
give them that 's the cause of all this change-

ment, for I 'm sure they meant it for the 
best." 
Madge Casey spoke the sentiments of the 
greater part, if not the whole, of the old pea- 
santry round Springmount. They could not 
habituate themselves to the changes, which 
they were loth to consider improvements, in 
their dwellings. 
" I don't like their newfangled alterations," 
said Molly Macguire ; " sure, it isn't natural 
that we should be following fashions that those 
that were here before us never dreamt of. I loved 
my poor father and mother that 's gone to their 
long home, and I like to remember them sitting 
one at each side of the chimney-corner, their 
toes almost in the ashes, their heads resting 
on their knees, and their short dudeens* in the 
corners of their mouths, as comfortable as two 
poor creathurs could be; the house so gay

with pigs, ducks, and geese, running about the 
floor, grunting, quacking, and squalling ; cocks 
and hens crowing over their heads so lively ; 
and the gossoons so happy, tormenting the cat 
and dog, and baiting their little sisters ;  sure it 
was a pleasant sight, and the ould couple seemed 
to enjoy it ! I could sit down and remember 
this, till it seemed to be all before my eyes. 
But now every thing is so changed, that I canH 
for the life of myself bring 'em back to me, 
and this bothers me, and puts dismal thoughts 
into my head ; for I seem to be an unnatural 
child to my poor parents that 's dead and gone, 
God rest their souls ! to turn their fine flouchoo- 
laugh* cabin topsy-turvy into an English cot- 
tage, as they call it ; so that, if they were to 
come back some night (and sure there's no- 
thing to hinder 'em, as many 's the spirits have 
done before), 'twould drive 'em stark mad to see

how every thing is changed, and that their un- 
natural children wouldn't be contint with what 
was good enough for them. Och, agrah ! when 
one has lost those that were near and dear to 
one, it seems so natural to keep everything 
the same as it was before they went ; for then 
it seems as if they were not gone quite entirely, 
and one can bring ''em before one's eyes just as 
they used to be." 
Mrs. Desmond and her daughter saw wi^h 
disappointment that the improvements they had 
made had not increased the comfort of the 
persons they were intended to benefit; and 
their efforts to ameliorate the condition of a 
people whose prejudices and habits opposed a 
powerful obstacle to their benevolent endea- 
vours, were, though not altogether abandoned, 
greatly discouraged. 
Grace Cassidy and Mary Mahoney profited 
by the countenance and support which they

186 THE REPEALERS. 
received. Their cottages were as clean and 
tidily kept as in England, their gardens as redo- 
lent of flowers, and there was even a spirit of 
coquetry in the care bestowed in the decoration, 
particularly by Grace, who, having no children 
to occupy her time, had more leisure than Mary. 
The fresh nosegays ranged on the dresser as 
white as unsunned snow, and on which a goodly 
show of pewter and delf was set out ; the brick 
floor, cleanly swept, and as red as a cherry ; 
the windows rubbed bright, and all the rustic 
furniture shining from the efforts of Grace's 
hands  all showed the tasteful care, as well 
as cleanly habits of the tidy housewife ; and 
her person was as well attended to as her 
house. 
The old neighbours found out that " sure 
and troth Grace Cassidy was full of conceit, to 
have her kitchen as iligant as the parlour in 
genteel houses, and her garden full of roses,

and other fine plants, just as if it was a gentle- 
man's garden. Sure, poor people didn't want 
flowers ; they were only fit to devart the rich, 
who had nothing else to do with their money 
or their time; but faith the pride of some 
people was mighty great, to be setting up for 
such grandeur !" 
Thus, what ought to have insured Grace the 
approval of her neighbours, excited only their 
enmity, as they considered her habits a re- 
proach to their own. This feeling was increased 
by their jealousy at seeing the plain, solid, 
eight-day clock, brass warming-pan, gridiron, 
and frying-pan, that were presented to her by 
Mrs. Forrester, in order that her Irish cottage 
should have all the appendages of an English 
one ; and they were heard to say, that " sure 
there would be no living with Grace, now that 
she was setting herself up as a lady, with her 
clock instead of an hour-glass."

Every word which Patrick said, touched a 
chord that vibrated in the heart of Jim, and all 
the reflections and advice of Grace failed to 
produce an equal effect on his mind. Example 
is always more convincing than precept, and 
this was never more exemplified than in the 
altered tone of feelings with which Jim Cassidy 
returned to his home. Both husband and wife 
deeply sympathised with the poor prisoner 
they had left, and the serene aspect of nature

and the pure freshness of the air seemed, from 
the contrast of the heavy atmosphere and 
gloomy cell in which they had spent the last 
two hours, to be still more delightful. 
" When will poor Patrick be at liberty to 
enjoy all that is now refreshing us ?" said Jim. 
" Och ! Grace ma-vourneen, when I think 
that I might have been there in his place, and 
have seen you shut out from me as we were 
from him^ sure it makes the heart sink within 
me." 
"But you forget, Jim dear," replied Grace, 
" that 1, being your wife, should have a right 
to stay with you wherever you were, and there- 
fore I'd be with you in that gloomy, narrow 
cell, for I have no child to keep me at home 
away from my husband. If poor Mary had no 
children she would be with Patrick, and then 
he would not be so miserable, nor she neither." 
" That's just like your own womanly heart,

to think so," said Jim ; "but you don't know 
the heart of man, ma-colleen : we are proud and 
obstinate : we are like the oaks of the forest, 
that stand in pride to resist the storm, and re- 
fuse to bend to it, till it strikes us to the earth; 
but ye are like the delicate shrubs that yield to 
every breeze, and bend with it, so that ye are 
not destroyed as we are. If Mary was in that 
wretched hole of a cell, she would be content 
because she was near him^ and doing her duty ; 
but he would be always noticing the want of 
comfort around her, and dwelling on the dis- 
grace of having brought her there, with the 
bitter thought that it was by not discharging 
his duty that they were both there : so un- 
happy as he is away from her, I think he would 
be more unhappy to have her there. Then, 
Grace, every man has a pride for his wife, and 
though he can bear up against the affronts he 
has brought on himself, he couldn't bear to see

misplaced in a prison as a beautiful fresh nose- 
gay, the sight of which only makes one low- 
spirited, by reminding one of where it came 
from, and where it ought to be. One would 
like to keep the wife and the flowers for our 
own home."" 
" Yes, Jim dear, I can understand a man's 
thinking thus, but a woman never deems herself 
out of her place when she is comforting her 
husband. Sure, the very words, the holy words 
of marriage, says, they are never to forsake each 
other in sickness or in health, in riches or in 
poverty, and much more in sorrow ought they 
to be together ; but men are too apt, Jim dear, 
to treat women as flowers, that are for sunshine 
and happiness, instead of being charms in gloom 
and trouble ; whereas we are never so much at 
home as in comforting the afilicted, and making

thole we love forget the cares and vexations 
that fall on all.'' 
About this period news arrived that Donelly, 
who had fled for the murder of the policeman, 
had fallen a victim to a drunken quarrel with 
some of his reckless associates, and his aged 
father and mother, whose sole support he was, 
were now plunged in grief, with no consolation 
left them, but that, had he been arrested by the 
police, his life would have paid the penalty of 
his crime, with all the ignominy attached to 
such a death ; and from this additional misery, 
his scarcely less disgraceful, though less pub- 
licly disgraceful, death had saved them. Their 
poor neighbours flocked round to comfort 
them ; and the worthy rector, Mr. Disnay, 
afforded them ample assistance. 
The unhappy parents, while receiving the 
generous stipend of Mr. Disnay, administered 
with no sparing hand, remembered with bitter-

ness, that their unfortunate and guilty son had 
been one of the most active of the ringleaders 
in opposing the payment of tithes, and acknow- 
ledged how admirable was the creed of that 
religion which repays injuries with benefits.  
'' Och ! Mich," said the poor old woman to 
her husband, " isn't it a fine thing, and a won- 
derful thing too, to see Parson Disnay, and all 
his family, showing such favour to us after all 
the harm and mischief our poor boy that's dead 
and gone did to them and theirs ? Well, God 
rest his soul and forgive him his sins ! sure he'd 
be now alive if he hadnH followed bad advisers ; 
and it's only the good pattern that Parson Dis- 
nay sets us, in forgiving all our poor boy did 
against him, that keeps me from going down 
on my knees to give my ten thousand curses to 
them Repalers that led our child astray."

inflicted by unkindness, while revenge or ran-

cour but serves to keep them unhealed. The 
Irish have not been taught to practise this 
virtue (for a virtue it positively is, and for its 
perfection requiring many others) ; but, unfor- 
tunately, their passions, quick to be excited 
and as quick to be appeased, have ever been 
encouraged to keep alive the spirit of ven- 
geance, as something praiseworthy ; while for- 
giveness they are taught to consider as a proof 
of a mean spirit and a dastardly nature. So 
little were the poor and ignorant peasantry 
capable of appreciating the conduct of Mr. 
Disnay and his curate, that the instances of 
their forgiveness of injuries, and repayment of 
evil with good, were sometimes reputed as in- 
dications of their cowardice, meanness, or cun- 
ning, or all three united ; and this opinion was 
entertained by a people eminently calculated 
by nature not only to appreciate, but to prac- 
tise the virtue they decried. It has been truly

said, that " happiness is but opinion ;" but, 
alas ! we see examples constantly brought be- 
fore us that virtue is equally a matter of con- 
vention ; and the sister-country proves, that 
from ignorance and superstition, two giant 
fiends, beneath whose shadow all goodness be- 
comes blighted, that which is most admirable 
in religion and morals may, even in the nine- 
teenth century, be as undervalued as it is mis- 
understood. 
In holding up Mr. Disnay and his curate as 
examples of the advantage to be derived to 
parishioners from seeing before them men 
whose lives accord with their professions, we 
would not have it imagined that good clergy- 
men are wholly confined to the established 
church. We have known many excellent and 
worthy priests of the Roman Catholic religion ; 
but many of their tenets precluded the possi- 
bility of their being equally serviceable to

their flock ; and above all, the Divine precept of 
" Do unto others as you would they should 
do unto you" was never sufficiently inculcated 
or acted upon, to enable them to subdue the 
angry feelings or violent actions of their in- 
flammable flocks. 
It augurs ill for any religion, when the 
persons who profess it act in open violation 
of its dictates. Murder, violence, and rapine, 
speak little in favour of the manner in which 
the powerful influence, supposed to be held by 
the Roman Catholic priests over their flocks, 
is wielded ; and the constant repetition of 
such atrocities must dispose all reasonable 
people to conclude, either that the priests have 
no power  the most charitable conclusion, or 
that the country where such outrages stain the 
national character must have less religion than 
any other country on the face of the globe ; or, 
lastly, that the religion professed by the ma-

jority in Ireland is totally powerless in influ- 
encing their conduct or feelings  the chief and 
grand motive of all religion. We are told, and 
the statement is borne out by the accounts 
which every week reach us, that the priests 
are but as the tools of him who rules Ireland ; 
whose sceptre is a firebrand, never waved but 
for destruction, and the ignition of the passions 
of his deluded followers. 
What can be thought of ministers of the 
Gospel, sent to preach peace and good will on 
earth, who lend themselves to the further- 
ance of bloodshed, the violation of all laws, and 
the plans of those who oppose themselves to 
the legitimate rulers of the land, tracking the 
path of rebellion by the blood of their victims ? 
Let us in charity hope that the priests are 
powerless, that they only yield obedience 
to the reign of terror they cannot resist, and 
that when the strong and mighty arm of the

law shall have quelled the anarchy which has so 
long deluged Ireland in crime, they will show 
that what has appeared to be guilt, was only 
weakness, and lend their assistance to soothe 
angry feelings, and re-establish peace and good 
order. Let them, by their conduct, prove that 
the Roman Catholic religion never tolerates 
crime, whatever may be its object ; and we will 
be one of the first to render them justice.

kept them in perpetual harmony, and the un-

rester attended to the comforts of Mr. and 
Mrs. Desmond, was a new bond of union be- 
tween him and his excellent wife. She repaid 
it by the warmth with which she attached her- 
self to his sister, Lady Oriel, and the sweet- 
ness with which she soothed the occasional 
moodiness of her Lord. No day passed in 
which the Desmonds did not congratulate 
themselves on the son-in-law whom Providence 
had given them ; and as they marked the hap- 
piness of their daughter, how did they rejoice 
in her choice, and in their ready acquiescence 
in it. 
Mrs. Forrester was now as ladies wish to 
be who love their lords ; and this circum- 
stance seemed to complete the happiness of 
the whole family. " How I hope it will be 
a son !" said Mrs. Desmond, " that it may 
be named after you," laying her hand on that 
of her husband ; ^' it would give me such hap-

piness to see another Walter Desmond as the 
future master of Springmount/' 
" But, my dear," replied Mr. Desmond, 
" Forrester's is as ancient a name as ours, 
and it would be ungracious to accept this 
compliment from him, of changing the name 
of his first-born." 
*' Well, well," said Mrs. Desmond, " the 
truth must out, for I cannot keep this, the 
first secret that was ever between us, any 
longer. Forrester has told me that his first 
son is to be Walter Desmond, and that if 
God grants him a second, he is to be For- 
rester, with his English estate settled on him. 
All this he told me very soon after his mar- 
riage, but I won't tell you what he said, when 
he prayed that his first-born might resemble 
you in every respect, for I should make you 
too proud." 
" The man who was honoured by your

preference, and blessed by your affection for 
twenty years, my dearest Louisa, must be 
already too proud to be spoilt by any other 
circumstance, however flattering ; but I feel 
deeply sensible of the affectionate delicacy of 
Forrester, and think we may consider ourselves 
to have indeed drawn a prize in the lottery of 
life, in having secured such a protector for 
our child, and such a companion for our- 
selves." 
The period had now arrived for the de- 
parture of the Desmonds and Forresters from 
Oriel Park for London, and they set out with 
regret from a place where they had passed 
their time so happily, and formed friendships 
which they felt would only terminate with their 
lives. The gentleness, and various powers of 
pleasing, which Lady Oriel so eminently pos- 
sessed, had excited an affection in the minds 
of her guests, which every day's knowledge of

THE REPEALERS. 20S 
her served to increase, and she repaid it with 
warmth and sincerity. Mrs. Desmond she 
loved and respected as a mother, and Mrs. 
Forrester she attached herself to as a sister ; 
and as she had never known either of those 
precious ties, she yielded to the new feelings of 
affection which were developed in her sensitive 
heart, with all the tenderness that formed a 
part of her nature. In short, the united fami- 
lies presented the rare example of parting with 
increased regard, after having passed the dif- 
ficult ordeal of a sejour of three months in a 
country-house, and looked forward with im- 
patience to their meeting in London in a few 
days. 
Had Lady Oriel not been supported by the 
protecting presence of Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. 
Forrester, she dared not have contemplated her 
return to London ; and even with their support, 
she looked forward to it with dread ; her self-

confidence was gone, and she felt that a look, 
a whisper, or a cold reception, had power to 
overwhelm her with confusion and dismay. 
The conduct of the unfeeling Lady Borrodaile 
at Keswick, had sunk deep in her mind, was 
often reflected upon, and never without bitter- 
ness, not towards the obtuse and ill-bred ma- 
tron, but towards herself, for having so far 
forgotten her dignity as to have placed herself 
in a situation to be exposed to the rudeness 
of such a person. Had Lady Oriel known the 
motives of Lady Borrodaile's conduct, she would 
have smiled in pity at what had pained her, for 
the impertinence of that lady had proceeded 
solely from jealousy and envy, at seeing her 
daughter overlooked whenever she was in the 
same society with Lady Oriel ; a circumstance 
that excited in the mind of the mother, a dis- 
like to the fair and innocent cause, and which 
she seized the first opportunity that offered for 
displaying.

THE REPEALERS. 205 
Had Lady Oriel known that this female 
dragon of virtue, who pulled her daughter 
away from a contact with a suspected woman, 
was in the constant habit of bringing her in 
close intimacy with women relative to whose 
reputations suspicion had long been exchanged 
for certainty, she would not have judged her- 
self so severely as she had done. But, with 
the delicate susceptibility of a pure and proud 
mind, she was more disposed to think favour- 
ably of the motives of others, than to find 
excuses for herself. Lady Oriel had yet to 
learn, that severity towards the errors, real, 
or supposed, of others, rarely proceeds from a 
love of virtue or detestation of vice, but are 
the modes in which jealousy and envy delight 
to avenge themselves for mortifications, of 
which, perhaps, she whose beauty or talents 
excite them, is the only person unconscious. 
An error in conduct may be overlooked, pro-

vided the sinner is neither young, beautiful, nor 
cleTer, the qualities which, alas I most fre- 
quently lead to error, by exciting the adoii- 
ration that prompts women to listen to the 
tempter ; but if she be handsome, or clever, 
or worse  both, then must she expect no 
mercv from her own sex, and make up her 
mind to console herself with the occupation 
which talents never fail to give to those who 
cultivate them, and which always * prove their 
own exceeding great reward." 
There are situations in life in which, because 
the evil qualities of our natures are not called 
into action, we believe we have them not ; and 
others, when, because the good qualities lie 
dormant, or are chilled by unpropitious cir- 
cumstances, we imagine they do not exist. 
Alas ! human nature is a web of mingled yarn. 
where good and evil are so closely woven toge- 
gether that it is difficult to separate them ; one

is sometimes more visible than the other, but 
both are to be found in all. the degrees differ- 
ing only in proportion to the excitement the}' 
find. 
Without the unfortunate dilemma in which 
Lady Oriel's imprudence had placed her hus- 
band and herself, the defects of Lord Oriel 
had probably never been observed, for it was 
this circumstance that encouraged their growth. 
He had now become so dependant on worldly 
opinion for happiness, that he lost much of the 
native dignity of his character ; and Lad}^ Oriel 
saw this defect with sorrow and self-reproach, 
attributing it to her own fatal imprudence. 
They left Oriel Park a few days after the 
Desmonds and Forresters had proceeded to 
London, and both entered town once more. 
with mutual fears for the future and painful 
retrospections of the past. 
The Morning Post announced the arrival

208 THE REPEALERS. 
of the Earl and Countess of Oriel in Grosvenor 
Square ; and the same paper, among the fashion- 
able parties for the week, announced a grand 
dinner for Wednesday at the splendid mansion 
of Mr. and INIrs. Desmond, and a ball for 
Friday, to which all the elite of fashion in 
London were invited. Lady Oriel found in- 
vitations for both; and her brother, a few 
hours after her arrival, came to urge the ne- 
cessity of her appearing at them. 
The dinner-party consisted of the Duke and 
Duchess of Heaviland, the Marquis and Mar- 
chioness of Bowood, the Earl and Countess of 
Grandison, and two or three distinguished 
members of the House of Commons. The 
party had been arranged with a view to intro- 
ducing Lady Oriel into the circle to which 
Mrs. Desmond was most anxious she should 
belong  a circle wherein the aristocracy of 
reputation was considered to be versus that of

THE REPEALERS. 209 
fashionable exclusiveness  the one in which she 
had hitherto figured. 
Lady Oriel could not resist casting a glance 
at her husband, when Mrs. Desmond presented 
her to the Duchess of Heaviland, the only 
lady there with whom she was not acquainted, 
though her acquaintance with the others was 
but slight ; and she observed that he anxiously 
watched her reception by a lady who was con- 
sidered so scrupulous as to female propriety 
as the Duchess. The accueil was peculiarly 
gracious, because Mrs. Desmond had spoken 
highly of Lady Oriel. The evil reports in 
circulation she had never heard, or, if heard, 
had forgotten ; and, even had they been re- 
membered, her knowledge of Mrs. Desmond's 
character and principles would have led her to 
disbelieve them. The other ladies behaved 
just as they would have done in former days; 
and after the first ten minutes of nervous

embarrassment were over, the marked affection 
of Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. Forrester, with the 
manly and dignified bearing of her brother, 
who being deputed by Mr. Desmond to do the 
honors chez lui, and as host, directed much of 
his attention to his timid sister, soon placed her 
at her ease. 
In the drawing-room, during the soiree, the 
Duchess expressed her desire to cultivate the 
acquaintance of Lady Oriel ; and a number of 
other ladies, who came in the evening, renewed 
with apparent pleasure their former intercourse 
with her. Lord Oriel observed all this with 
gratified feelings, and in returning home, re- 
marlced what an agreeable day they had spent ; 
a remark that elicited a smile from his wife, 
who, however satisfied she might feel at the 
flattering reception she had received on this 
her first entre into fashionable life since she had 
retired from it, had more than once mentally

THE REPEALERS. 211 
confessed, that it was the only dull day she had 
passed in the society of the Desmonds and 
Forresters. 
She had been enjoying such rationally happy 
evenings during their stay at Oriel Park, that 
she found it difficult to reconcile herself to the 
vapid amusements of balls and routs ; and she 
resolved that, if she was fortunate enough to 
recover her former position in society, so as to 
satisfy her husband's susceptibility, she would 
confine herself as much as possible to the do- 
mestic circle, where she felt that true happiness 
could alone be found. 
Cards of visits and invitation came pouring 
in every succeeding day, to all of which Lord 
Oriel gave an attention very unlike his former 
indifference. He had become excessively scru- 
pulous as to the reputations of the ladies on 
his wife's visiting list, and requested her to 
avoid two or three who were considered un pea

leste, but who were generally received in so- 
ciety. Lady Oriel ventured to observe, that 
having suffered herself from the malignity of 
scandal, she thought it wrong to show more 
prudery than other ladies towards the persons 
in question. But he with a sigh answered, 
that it was this very misfortune that rendered 
it so much more necessary for her to be scru- 
pulous; and though she felt the truth of the 
remark, it wounded her.

An invitation to dinner soon followed the 
visit of the Duchess of Heaviland to Lady Oriel, 
and this seemed to afford extreme satisfaction to 
her husband. Heaviland House was consider-

ed one of the last strong-holds of aristocratic 
grandeur that London boasts ; the style of the 
mansion, the extreme richness and solid beauty 
of the furniture, and the almost feudal splen- 
dour kept up in the establishment, might well 
entitle it to this distinction. It was not more 
unlike the town mansions of the generality of 
our nobility, than were its owners. 
The Duke of Heaviland was a nobleman of 
high character, reserved and dignified manners, 
amiable disposition, and domestic habits. With 
a true taste for magnificence, he avoided all 
ostentation ; and though his immense fortune 
and high character gave him great weight, he 
took little part in public life, and contented 
himself with discharging the duties of his ele- 
vated station with scrupulous exactitude. He 
had filled the situation of Viceroy, in Ireland 
with impartiality and credit; had visited the 
French court as ambassador extraordinary, and

THE REPEALERS. 215 
left behind him, in France, a deep impression 
of the splendour and hospitality of the English 
nobility, which few were so well calculated to 
represent with dignity, as the Duke and his 
amiable Duchess. The Duke's politics were 
high tory, and had always been so consistent, 
reasonable, and moderate, as to gain him the 
respect of all parties. 
The Duchess of Heaviland was exactly the 
wife suited to the Duke, and fitted to fill the 
high station she held. Sensible, mild, digni- 
fied, and perfectly unaff*ected, she pursued 
the even tenour of her way, avoiding all cliques, 
and confining her society to a select circle, as 
irreproachable in morals as elevated in rank. 
No petty competition, no political intrigues, no 
assumption of leading or driving the world of 
fashion, ever actuated the Duchess of Heavi- 
land's movements. She stood proudly aloof 
from the crowd, supporting with dignity " her

place of state," respected by all, and beloved by 
those who had opportunities of knowing her. 
It was during her Grace's sejour in Ireland, 
as the representative of female majesty, that 
Mrs. Desmond's acquaintance with her ripened 
into a strong and cordial friendship, and had 
since been maintained by frequent intercourse 
and correspondence. And it was at the desire 
of Mrs. Desmond that the Duchess cultivated 
the acquaintance of Lady Oriel, as hitherto, 
her Grace had rarely sought any intimacy with 
the members of the clique, to which Lady 
Oriel had formerly belonged, from their being, 
as she observed, too fashionable, and too gay 
for her sober habits. 
The gentleness and decorum of Lady Oriel's 
manners had strengthened the favourable im-

Lord Oriel also formed an intimacy which 
brought them often together; and the select 
and distinguished guests whom the Oriels fre- 
quently met at Heaviland House, all sought the 
acquaintance of Lady Oriel, who, as the con- 
stant associate of the Duchess of Heaviland, 
soon became as recherchee in the best society, as 
even her fastidious Lord could desire. Those 
who had formerly dropped off from her, now as 
eagerly sought a renewal of her acquaintance, 
and she conducted herself so mildly and decor- 
ously towards them, that they accused them- 
selves of inj ustice, in ever having doubted her 
purity. 
This was a triumph to Lord Oriel, and seem- 
ed all that was requisite to his happiness ; his 
pride in his wife no longer humiliated, he be- 
came cheerful and gay, and a succession of 
recherche dinners, and brilliant soirees, once

more enlivened his elegant residence in Gros- 
venor Square. 
The Desmonds and Forresters, to whom Lady 
Oriel owed her reinstatement in society, were 
delighted beyond measure at witnessing the 
happiness they caused; and all was sunshine 
and gaiety in the two families, who never passed 
a day without meeting, and felt that each in- 
terview only rendered them mutually dearer. 
Colonel Forrester and his Frances made the 
house of Mr. Desmond so agreeable, that it was 
quoted as offering the pleasantest society in 
London ; and the worthy pair seemed to grow 
young in witnessing the happiness of their 
children. 
Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester were at the 
Opera, and Lord Albany entered their box. " I 
hope, ladies," said he, " that you are delighted 
with the ballet of Faust. You must admit that 
the music is as pretty as it is original ; and the

March, infernal as it is meant to be, is very 
fine. I like the Opera better than any other 
theatrical amusement,'*'' continued Lord Albany ; 
" the hour is more suited to one's habits ; for 
really it is bien genant to be obliged to swallow 
one's dinner, and drive off in a state of personal 
discomfort, to arrive when half the new comedy 
or tragedy is over, and be told that the most 
effective scenes have passed. Then the sort of 
dinners one gets preparatory to a play  I think 
of them with horror ! To dine dans une bonne 
maison the day of a premeditated visit to the 
theatre, is out of the question ; so one is forced 
to hurry over soup and cotelettes, a la minute, 
at Crockford's, at the risk of burning one's 
mouth ; and drink wine half-iced, denying one- 
self the gentlemanly comfort of discussing a 
dessert ; and then ' to be taken (as the poetical 
apothecary's label directs) and well shaken' 
over the pave in a cabriolet, one is out of

humour before one arrives, digestion is de- 
ranged, comfort destroyed, patience put hors de 
combat ; and, consequently, one is little disposed 
to judge favourably of the entertainment, and 
one leaves the theatre, vowing that we have 
now neither dramatic writers nor actors; and 
all this because we have been derange^ and that 
if we will not change our hours, so they will not 
change theirs." 
" But would it not be a good plan to go to 
the theatre without dining," asked Lady Oriel, 
" and sup afterwards ? by which means, all the 
disagreeable effects you have so pathetically 
deplored would be avoided."" 
" Helas ! mes dames,'''' said Lord Albany, " I 
have tried that plan ; but it answers not. From 
going without dinner, one is apt to make a 
more substantial supper, and this banishes 
sleep. The ghosts of the murdered lamb, 
chicken, &c. sacrificed to our appetites, rise up

in judgment against one, presenting even more 
hideous visions than those which murdered the 
slumbers of Macbeth." 
" How much more you men think of dinners 
than we do !" said Mrs. Forrester. 
" I own that in general we do," replied Lord 
Albany ; " for la gourmandise is not a female 
vice. Still, who can deny that much of our 
comfort depends on our dinners? and he is 
therefore wise, who, reflecting that as we must 
dine three hundred and sixty-five days in the 
year, resolves to dine well, in order to spare 
the stomach and its poor dependant, the temper. 
I never dine with Lord Refton without feeling 
a happier and, I do believe, a better man for 
the rest of the evening ; ' my bosom's lord sits 
lightly on its throne,' because the stomach is 
not weighed down with any ' perilous stuiF.' 
His plats are so delicious, so tpure from all 
that is gross, that they can only send light and

accounts for his being always gay, spirituel, 
and amiable.'' 
" I know not if this be the cause," said Lady 
Oriel, " but I am ready to admit the effect ; 
for Lord Refton is very agreeable and spi- 
ritueV 
" Oh ! I do assure your ladyship," replied 
Lord Albany, " that my theory on this point 
is irrefutable. Good cooks make agreeable 
men. Only compare the most gifted con- 
versationist, even Moore himself, after a dinner 
at Refton 's, or in an ordinary house with the 
same guests, and he would be no longer equally 
brilliant. I have thought of searching into 
history, to discover the materials of which were 
composed the particular repasts eaten by the 
remarkable men of the last century the day of, 
or the day previous to, any remarkable action, as 
I am convinced it would elucidate my system.

be taken off from poor human nature, by disco-

ascertaining that

" Apropos to con amore^ as beauty always is

very handsome woman opposite to us? she 
might make one forget dinner and supper 
too."

her through her glass, " is the wife of our most 
popular writer, and is remarkably beautiful ;

other evening as one of the very few perfect 
specimens now to be seen of a beauty peculiar 
to Ireland: hair like the wing of the raven 
seen with the sun's rays full on it, and skin 
white as the driven snow, with eyes of Heaven's 
own blue. The lady comes of an ancient Irish 
race, and belies not her blood, which sends that 
mantling rose-tint to her cheeks, ' as if she 
blushed because she is too fair.' " 
" A mauvaise honte^'''' added Lord Albany, 
" that few ladies are guilty of for such a cause ! 
Look into the parterre, and you will see talking 
together two of the men who have the most suc- 
ceeded in fiction  Moore the poet and Lord 
Fableton. Both have made reputations from

but such is the prejudice of society, that while

of the novel-writer, often proves the most perni- 
cious gift to the individuals who compose the 
talkers instead of the writers in society. How 
strange does it appear to casuists," continued 
Lord Albany, smiling, " that one man with his 
plume can soar into the regions of fiction, and 
gain immortality by a brilliant fable; while 
another, using his tongue instead of a pen, and 
adhering to prose instead of verse, becomes 
stamped with the degrading epithet of a liar, 
and all from a different use of the same faculty ! 
What a poet would my poor friend Lord Fa- 
bleton have made, had he turned his inventive 
powers to good account, instead of being, as at 
present, considered an emulator of the Baron 
Munchausen !

' What a brilliant imagination ! what invention !' 
was repeated at every side ; and albeit unused 
to the approving mood, I was forced to yield 
assent to their well-merited commendations. I 
left Grosvenor Square duly impressed with the 
advantages of imagination, and wishing that I, 
too, could find a ladder to mount into this 
palace of gold, and bear away even a little of 
its dust. With this feeling I entered White's, 
and seated myself, inwardly invoking the aid 
of imagination, until my invocations were in- 
terrupted by the voice of my imaginative 
friend. Lord Fableton, who related tales and 
anecdotes which satisfied many of his hearers 
that he was in his anecdotage, and stated as 
facts the bright eff*usions of his brain. The 
past, present, and future, were equally and 
impartially misrepresented, and the poem I 
had heard read in the early part of the even- 
ing, contained much less invention than his con-

versation. No sooner had he withdrawn, than 
the circle he had left commented most severely 
on his want of veracity. ' And this,' thought 
I, ' is the reward of genius, and such is the in- 
vidious distinction made between men of equal 
powers of imagination. One gains immortality 
by his pen, while the prejudices of society 
stamps my poor friend as a liar, only for having 
spoken his bright imaginings  he ought to have 
been a poet.'  The young lady next the Irish 
beauty is the authoress of * Romance and 
Reality,' and of several exquisite poems, full 
of imagery, and of a fancy that would not 
have shamed Hafiz himself." 
" I have read her novel," said Lady Oriel, 
" and think it exceedingly clever ; the dialogue 
epigrammatic and sparkling, displaying all the 
freshness and gaiety of youth, with the obser- 
vation of maturity."

" She is very handsome certainly," replied 
I.ady Oriel ; " indeed so are all the family ; and 
I remember being particularly struck, when I 
saw her and her sister the late Lady Usridge 
for the first time, both fair and with an air so 
distingue and comme il faut, each adding to 
the charm of the other; indeed I never see 
the living sister without thinking of the lost 
one, the beautiful pendant that Nature gave 
her. Then in the box to the left, is the

Mrs. Forrester, '' you will be better able to

" Decidedly," said the Duke ; " if, as you 
say, you believe her to be innocent with regard 
to the scandalous reports in circulation." 
" But what will the world say ? And if, as 
I suspect, a party is made against her, my 
single countenance can do her little good, and 
may do me much harm."" 
" My dear Jane, I am shocked to hear such 
sophisms from your lips. The same mode of 
reasoning has ruined many a woman ; because 
while each of her friends, if friends such calcu-

should be the only female ready to do a kind 
and charitable action, the poor woman has 
fallen to the deepest depth of the slough of

follow their example. It is not the crime, 
but its consequences, that you all dread. Self- 
ishness has taken the place of all natural 
feeling : you are willing to be on terms of 
intimacy in society with those of your own sex, 
about whose conduct you cannot doubt, be- 
cause they happen to be received, yet draw oiF 
in terror from some you loved, and do not 
suspect, because scandal has seared what vice 
could not sully. If you were all ignorant of 
the misconduct of those you continue to visit, I 
should hold you blameless ; and if you believ- 
ed the scandal propagated against those you 
discard, I should consider you conscientious, 
but not cruel ; while as it is, I think you both, 
and so thinking, avow that selfishness and gross 
insensibility have demoralised you all."

women !" said the Duchess, " as if they only 
were insensible and selfish."

" Pardon me," said the Duke ; " I am will- 
ing to admit that the disgusting defects I have 
named, are even more prevalent among men 
than women. With us, a man dare hardly per- 
form a service, attended even with the sem- 
blance of the slightest personal sacrifice, with- 
out the risk of being held up to ' the world's 
dread laugh,' and being pointed at as an 
enthusiast, un tite foible, a man who is the 
dupe of the designing. All this is very dread- 
ful ; for, be assured, when we are arrived at the 
point of considering generosity, disinterested- 
ness, and goodness, as proofs of weakness, we 
are not far from looking on their opposites as 
praiseworthy. Misfortune, however unmerited, 
and error, that existed only in appearance, 
and never descended to reality, meet with few 
advocates at present ; while undoubted guilt, if 
upheld by circumstances, passes current in 
society: and all this injustice proceeds alone

from selfishness, as people are neither more 
severe nor malicious than formerly ; they are 
only influenced by the fear of injuring self. 
This is felt in the senate, in the clubs, in fact, 
in all places. A charge likely to aflfect the 
reputation of any individual, however un- 
founded or improbable it may be, is sufficient 
to annul friendships of long duration; and 
former friends are content with hoping the 
charges may be untrue, instead of taking pains 
to prove them so. But en attendant, what could 
they do ? They could not act in opposition to the 
opinion of the world, and, therefore, the friend is 
sacrificed to the only friend of the egotist  self." 
" But as we cannot change the world," said 
the Duchess, " we must submit to it."

pillars are of marble, substantial, and, alas !

of gauze diaphane ; all that passes within is de- 
tected, as the gauze is too clear to conceal 
defects, though it shades slight spots ; and 
the pillars are considered, like those that sup-

'' Au contraire,''' said the Duke, " I will 
never consent to it. This is the first error of 
which Lady Oriel has even been suspected. 
You disbelieve the charge, and so do I ; but

admitting, for sake of argument, that she was 
not blameless, it is always charitable to look 
mildly on Si first faulty because it prevents the 
recurrence of many another: besides, 
' To err is human, to forgive divine.' 
But when error is repeated, and that, as in the 
case of Lady Baskerton,

ance that led to the rumours. You are unspotted 
in reputation, my dear Jane, and, therefore, can 
afford to be charitable to the erring or the sus- 
pected. This is one of the happy privileges of 
undoubted virtue, and the worst that can be 
said or thought is, that the undoubted virtue

defalcation of such women as you, must pass 
the sentence of ostracism on Lady Oriel ; and 
could you, believing her guiltless, be the means 
of injuring her ?"" 
" I shall certainly call on her to-morrow," 
said the Duchess ; " for you will do me the 
justice of admitting, that I never oppose myself 
to your judgment."* 
"But to return," said the Duke, " to the 
subject of the systematic selfishness that per- 
vades society at present  I assure you, Jane, 
that it is distressing to witness it. In the senate, 
men are ashamed to give an elan to the noble and 
generous sentiments that animate them : at the 
bar, legal technicalities and satirical pleasant- 
ries supersede the bursts of eloquence and 
feeling that formerly resounded from the bar- 
risters, in defending virtue or exposing vice; 
and in society, men encounter each other

armed against any display of high feeling, lest 
they be laughed at as enthusiastic or romantic, 
two terms now received as the acme of reproach 
and ridicule. I wish a few of us plain honest 
men would take courage, stand by each other, 
dare to avow our pretensions to generosity 
and manliness, and show that there is a still 
greater ridicule than that of being considered 
unselfish and unknowing  the ridicule of being 
ashamed of being neither. Madame de Stael pro- 
foundly observed, ' that there are many men 
received in the best society, who, if accused of 
a dishonourable action, would reply. It is pos- 
sible that the action was wrong, but, at least, no 
one dare tell me so to my face."* She adds, ' No- 
thing can convey a stronger idea of the utmost 
depravation ; for where or how could society 
exist, if people were to kill each other ; to have 
the right to do all the evil possible ; to break 
one's word, and to lie, as long as it is not per-

mitted to tell the person he has lied  in 
fact, to separate honour from bravery, and to 
transform courage into a means of committing 
or defending bad actions ?^ It is thus, my dear 
Jane, that we lose the substance of all that is 
good and noble, and adhere only to the shadow; 
and this is the most hopeless of all states. Few 
pause to ask, is Lady C or Lady D 
really culpable ? the only question is, are they 
received ? and if they are, they may continue 
to enjoy all the advantages of a good reputa- 
tion, while they are universally known to have 
a bad one. Can any state of society be worse 
than that of receiving women, of whom nearly 
the whole of that society have the very worst 
opinion, and for receiving whom they can give 
no better excuse than that they are received 
elsewhere ? The same facility exists with our 
sex. I meet men continually in the best so- 
ciety, whose reputations have long ceased to be

alleged want of principle in the houses, and 
by the persons who invited them. One of the 
many bad effects of scandal is, that its general 
extension accustoms people to hear the most 
dishonorable reports, without being either 
much shocked or surprised. They think on 
these subjects as the French writer did on 
another, when he said, ' Ce n'est rien s'il ne le 
salt pas, et pea de chose s'^il le salt.'' The scan- 
dal, if true, is now of slight importance, and if 
untrue, of less, provided the person incurring 
it is supported by her clique ; and this, Jane, I 
call demoralization."

bent in languor, as if she thought not how many 
were seeking to catch their recognition; and now 
look, she speaks, and raises those brilliant orbs 
as if to make us doubt which is most beautiful, 
their animation or their repose. Every line of 
her poetry is to me fraught with a recollection 
of her lovely face ; it haunts me, and is my very 
beau ideal of what a Corinne should be. For a 
long time, I was afraid to read the produc- 
tions of Mrs, Grantly, lest they should disap- 
point me. I thought it impossible that great 
talent could be joined to so much beauty ; but 
I have learned to estimate them for their in- 
trinsic merit, without any reference to their 
beautiful author ; and it is no faint praise to 
say, ' the mind keeps the promise we had

those exquisite verses lately published ; and it 
was of her that the Emperor Alexander of 
Russia observed, that she had too much beauty 
for a woman who wished to derive no advan- 
tage from it. Her reputation has, however, de- 
rived an advantage from it ; for she has proved 
the possibility of great personal charms and high 
spirits being accompanied by a retenue of con- 
duct that has defied even the suspicions of slan- 
der. Though an indefatigable leader of fashion, 
nay, by some considered an agitator, or dictator,

the very personification of aristocracy, from his 
intellectual-looking head to his finely-formed 
legs and feet. He is accused by many of being 
Jier, but the charge only arises in the accuser's 
ignorance of his character. If he hsis Jiertt^ it is 
only that of a proud consciousness of his own 
high reputation ; and who would not be proud 
' f it ? See him with his family and friends, and 
it is impossible to meet a person more natural, 
kind, and unpretending.

said, that her sole besetting sin is a passion for 
diamonds, if it be a sin ? and she excuses this 
by saying, that they are the only bright things 
that do not fade." 
" Oh ! pray tell me who that dull-looking 
man is, that has fixed himself on Mr. Luttrell, 
who appears to wince under the infliction ?" 
" That," said Mrs. Forrester, " is a man, 
who, without any one qualification for shining 
in society, believes himself to have as many as 
Athenaeus thought necessary for the formation 
of a cook, when he states that a chef de cuisine 
ought to be a mathematician, a theoretical mu- 
sician, a natural philosopher, and a natural 
historian. Mr. is only a natural-fool ; 
but, unfortunately, he is filled with preten- 
sions, and consequently is a most tiresome 
personage. You observe that short gentleman 
near the Duke of Lenox .? He is the person of 
whom George the Fourth observed, on seeing 
him in uniform, that he must be a megalo-

saure, an antediluvian reptile, with paddles 
instead of legs, and clothed in mail." 
" Our host does the honours extremely well," 
observed Mrs. Forrester ; '' hov^ general his 
civilities are ! After all, politeness ought to 
be added to the list of the cardinal virtues, 
for how many of them depend on it ! At all 
events, politeness makes us forget the ab- 
sence of virtue, and the want of politeness 
its presence." 
"What!" interrupted Lord Albany, who 
overheard the last sentence, " moralising in a 
ball-room ? and eulogising virtue and polite- 
ness in a scene where only the semblance of 
both are tolerated ? Virtue, like a portionless 
beauty, has more admirers than followers ; and 
politeness, like love, is only approved when 
oneself is the object. I dare not remain to 
hear my aphorism refuted," continued Lord 
Albany, gliding away.

" No, stay until I have replied to your 
aphorism by another," said Lord Montagu, 
who joined them in time to hear the retreat- 
ing peer's observation ; " and do not fly like 
a Parthian, throwing a dart as you retire." 
" I fled, not from a dread of being refuted 
by you, Montagu," said Lord Albany return- 
ing; " it was the ladies," (bowing,) " that I 
feared; so now for your aphorism." 
" Remember," said Lord Montagu, " you 
depreciated politeness and virtue, and I say, 
' Les esprits legers font beaucoup de mat, 
quand Us se melent de juger les sentimens, 
qu'^ih ne sauraient comprendre.'''''' 
" And I must reply," said Lord Albany, 
laughing, " that I am willing to be ranked in 
the list des esprits legers, if you are in that

retired, leaving Lord Montague to continue his

" I have been pointing out the various per- 
sons who have passed before us to Lady Lucy," 
said Lady Oriel, " and fear I have but ill-per- 
formed my task. I should have had your Lord- 
ship5 or Lord Albany, to act as showman, and 
then I am sure Lady Lucy would have had 
a piquant epitome of the character of each 
person." 
" That depends," replied Lord Montagu, 
" on how the persons to be described stand 
with the world, for I confess that, from a na- 
tural indolence of disposition, I am rather dis- 
posed to think well of those who are well with 
the world, and vice versa, which verifies the 
proverb that * Le rnonde est imjoueur, qu'on a 
toujours de son parti quand on gagrie^ 
" And I," said Mrs. Forrester, ''am always 
disposed to doubt the justice of the sentences 
that the world passes on hearsay evidence, as I 
think the world a good witness on a trial, but a 
bad judge."

' One thing you must admit,'' said Lord 
Montagu, " which is, ' Si mtchant que soit le 
monde, il ne nous ferait pas grand mal si nous 
tikions pas si souvent son complice.'"''' And so 
saying, the peer passed on, leaving Lady Oriel 
to reflect on the truth of the axiom, and to 
apply it to her own peculiar case. 
" On ne connait bien tout Vetendue d^uu 
malheur que lorsquon s^en accuse,''^ thought 
Lady Oriel to herself, as she recurred to the 
past; " I cannot blame the world for v/ounding 
me with the arms which I presented to it. 
The fault was all my own."

CHAPTER XIX.

occasions dans la vie, ou 1 'on a absolument besoin des per- 
sonnes qui en ont. Marivavx. 
Lady Oriel observed, and the reflection 
sank deep in her mind, that all the charity 
shown in drawing favorable conclusions on her 
recent esclandre, emanated from those who 
were pure and unsuspected themselves, and 
who judged her by the criterion of their own 
hearts. In no instance had she met with 
slights from a woman of undoubted virtue; 
while, on the contrary, she had experienced
## p. 253 (#261) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 25S 
various indications of rudeness from ladies 
who had been compelled to profit largely by 
the charitable interpretations put on their 
conduct, and who, feeling how little they 
merited the forbearance shown them, were 
disposed to believe that she too stood in a 
similar position. 
It is fortunate for the sinning, that there 
are many good and virtuous people in the 
world, otherwise how could one half of so- 
ciety meet the other? The vulgar phrase of 
set a thief to catch a thief, would be more 
than verified by the instinctive tact with which 
certain errors would be detected and exposed 
by those who had known them by personal 
experience ; confidence would be destroyed, be- 
cause one of its best guards, a belief in virtue, 
would no longer exist; and medisance, which 
always prevails in proportion to the degree of 
corruption in society, would become general.

The trial Lady Oriel had passed through, 
determined her on never ao^ain livinoc in habits 
of intimacy with ladies whose reputations were 
too apocryphal to admit of their judging with 
charity, or supporting a tottering friend. 
Among the acquaintances she now sought 
to cultivate, the wife of the Premier, and the 
Marchioness of Bowood, were distinguished. 
The first lady, from the high official station 
of her husband, was called to take a lead in 
society which her domestic habits had hitherto 
led her to decline, though her various accom- 
plishments and dignified manners peculiarly 
fitted her for the post of honour. Lady Rey 
was always cited as an example for mothers 
and wives; and her daughters emulated her 
virtues. Married in early youth to a noble- 
man no less distinguished for his high cha- 
racter than for his brilliant and solid talents as 
a statesman, and who sought for happiness and

THE REPEALERS. 255 
repose from his political duties, where only it 
can be truly found, in the bosom of his family, 
the domestic circle of Lord Rey had become 
proverbial for the exhilarating example it fur- 
nished of harmony and rational enjoyment. 
Even he, the supposed misanthropic poet, 
whose sarcasms have touched all circles, and 
spared none, never recurred to the family of 
the Premier without commendations whose 
warmth proved their sincerity ; and he has been 
often heard to say that one such family might 
reconcile even a sceptic to the belief in virtue 
and goodness. 
No Avonder, then, that Lady Oriel was 
anxious to become something more than a 
guest at the grand receptions of Lady Rey, 
and that she desired to be admitted to the 
more select re-unions,  a distinction that was 
soon accorded her. 
The Marchioness of Bowood had long been

on visiting-terms with Lady Oriel, who rarely 
missed any of the soirees at Bowood House ; 
and the amiability and kindness of its owners, 
so generally felt and acknowledged, had given 
a peculiar charm to its society. In the splen- 
did gallery at Bowood House, filled with the 
finest productions of art, might, during the 
season, be seen all that London could boast 
of rank, genius, and talent. Statesmen, poets, 
wits, authors, and artists, were here to be met, 
enlivened by a galaxy of female beauty, fur- 
nishing subjects of inspiration for the chisel or 
the pencil, or realising the dreams of the poet. 
Nothing could be more judicious than this 
blending of society ; and the soirees at the 
Marchioness of Bowood's were considered to 
offer more various attractions than those of any 
other house in London ; the very locale of the 
splendid suite of rooms assisting to give a 
charm to them.

" Pray look, Lady Lucy," said Lady Oriel, 
" and tell me if England has not reason to be 
proud when she can show such specimens of 
beauty as those in that circle; no other ca- 
pital in Europe could, I am sure, produce 
them." 
" Who is that handsome woman,^' asked 
Lady Lucy, " whose eyes outshine the dia- 
monds on her brow ? How very lovely she 
is ! and how completely aristocratic is the cha- 
racter of her beauty,  delicacy supported by 
conscious dignity, and Jierte softened by femi- 
nine mildness ! 
" That," replied Lady Oriel, " is the young 
Duchess of Lenox ; and that distinguished- 
looking woman on whom she leans, and who 
displays pearls, when she smiles, that rival the 
oriental ones on her neck, is her sister, the 
Marchioness of Burton. What a fine animated 
expression of countenance, fierce, and almost

stern in its expression when grave, but beauti- 
ful when she smiles. They are the daughters 
of the Marquis of Mona, and are justly consi- 
dered one of the handsomest families in England. 
Of them indeed it may be said, ' all the 
daughters are virtuous, and the sons brave.' 
That lovely blonde, who is speaking to the 
Marchioness of Burton, is the Lady Augusta 
Gearing. Is she not the personification of a 
poet's bright imagining, blooming as Hebe, and 
almost as celestial ? Purity and innocence are 
enshrined on that fair brow, and the fairy foot 
that peeps forth from her robe, might serve as 
a model to the sculptor." 
" She is indeed most lovely,'"* replied Lady 
Lucy ; " and so is that lady now entering." 
" That is the Marchioness of Glansicarde," 
said Lady Oriel. "Is not talent marked in 
every lineament of her beautiful face ? But 
how could it be otherwise with the daughter of 
such a father ? at least, according to my belief,
## p. 259 (#267) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 259 
that talent is hereditary. The two ladies at 
the door are Lady Yesterfied, and her sister, 
Mrs. Branson. They might serve to personify 
the morning and evening stars; both charming, 
and yet unlike each other. Their family are 
remarkable for beauty, and I understand equal- 
ly so for goodness. That handsome woman is 
Lady Emeline Hart Burtley, a young poetess 
j^f much brilliancy and imagination. Her po- 
etry resembles the exotic production of warmer 
climes ; bright, luxuriant, and fanciful. The 
lady next her is a bas-bleu, in the best acceptation 
of the phrase, being not only highly learned, but 
full of talent. Mathias, than whom no better 
judge can be found, pronounces her the best 
Italian scholar of our day; and her transla- 
tions of Petrarca are the best I know. Lady 
Norely, who is now speaking to Lady Lacre, 
is another of our literary ladies, and is remark- 
able for the sprightliness of her wit and the 
soundness of her understanding."

" You are very kind, dear Lady Oriel," said 
Lady Lucy, " to have told me the names of all 
these beauties and bas-bleus, therefore I won't 
be so exigeant as to ask you to name the other 
lovely faces I see around. They look like a par- 
terre of the richest and rarest flowers, each ren- 
dering the other more beautiful by its vicinity." 
" How pleasant it is,'' said Mrs. Forrester, 
" to rest the eyes on such an assemblage of 
beauty ! and yet there is something melancholy 
too in the pleasure ; and I could almost weep, 
as did Xerxes when he contemplated his sol- 
diers, as I reflect how fleeting are the charms 
which now dazzle our eyes, and that a few years 
will have faded their lustre ! There is some- 
thing very touching in the wreck of beauty; 
it is difficult to believe that the silken tresses, 
starry eyes, cheeks of rose, lips of coral, and 
teeth of pearl, now before us, may be sought 
for in vain, some years hence." 
" We must only console ourselves," replied

Lady Oriel, " with hoping to find a succes- 
sional crop of beauties, the daughters of those 
now before us, springing up to take their places. 
Are not the roses of this summer as fresh and 
blooming as those of the last ? and do we not 
look forward to seeing the next vernal season 
bring forth as bright ones? So it is with 
beauty  as fast as one race fades, another 
succeeds; and it is only eyes dimmed by age, 
which discover that the last are inferior to the 
first, for contemporaries deny this decline." 
" There are many specimens of the florid 
gothic here," said Lord Dorville, joining in 
the conversation, " that would confirm your 
last remark. Lady Oriel, which I inadvertently 
overheard, and which proves the truth of the 
old proverb, ' that listeners never hear good of 
themselves,' for I am old enough to have lost

go, and yet I passed in my day for what the 
ladies call a very pretty fellow. You look

very incredulous, fair ladies," said the fine old 
peer ; " but I refer you to your grandmothers, 
and to a certain portrait, by Sir Joshua Rey- 
nolds. I come to assemblies like this once or 
twice a-year, and go home comparing notes 
between the beauties of the night and the beau- 
ties of forty years ago. On dit que les absents 
out toujours tort, and I believe it is so, for I 
find myself quite as well satisfied with the faces 
before me," (bowing to them,) " as I ever 
was with the beauties that charmed me in 
my youth, though the turbaned dames newly 
restored and varnished, whom I meet in the 
saloi observe to me how the present race 
ha degenerated, and call on me to furnish 
evidence of the superiority of the first, to 
the present, every look of theirs rendering 
the comparison almost ludicrous."

Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester having 
promised to take Lady Lucy Forbes shopping, 
conducted her to Howell and James's, in Re- 
gent-street, an establishment that astonishes a 
novice in London more than any other, and

which quite bewildered the youthful Lady 
Lucy. 
" What a delightful place !" said she ; " what 
exquisite things ! Do you not come here very 
often, dear Lady Oriel ? Oh ! I must buy 
that wreath ; it looks as if the morning dew 
still trembled on its leaves, it is so fresh and 
blooming/' 
Lady Oriel, amused with the unsophisticated 
raptures of Lady Lucy, told her that she 
dared not come verj/ often to Howell's, for 
fear of making her too proud of belonging to a 
sex, in whose honour was raised such a temple. 
Behold,"" added Lady Oriel, '' the zephyry 
laces, more delicate than the finest web that the 
hapless Arachne ever spun, and diaphane 
gauzes from France, ethereal as the drapery of 
the cloud that deceived Ixion. See the rain- 
bow-tinted chintzes and muslins, with the soft- 
textured silks and satins of England. The

velvets of " Genoa the superb," the delicate 
poplins of Ireland, the cambrics of Scotland, 
the treasures of the Indian loom ; the brilliant 
gems of Orient dazzling the sight, and the per- 
fumes that " breathe of Araby the blest " 
stealing on the senses from their crystal pri- 
sons ; the most remote regions ransacked to 
bedeck us, and the productions of all climes 
brought to adorn us. All this," continued 
Lady Oriel, laughing at her own description, 
and the gravity with which Lady Lucy listened 
to it, " is calculated to impress a woman with 
too great an idea of the importance of her sex, 
for whom alone this splendid pile is reared, 
and therefore I do not indulge myself often 
by coming here." 
" And I," said the artless Lady Lucy, 
" should like to come every day, even if I had 
not the power of buying, merely to look at such 
beautiful things as I see around me."

" You remind me," replied Lady Oriel, " of 
the naive question of a clever English child to 
her mother at Venice, on seeing the Place St. 
Mark for the first time. ' Pray, mamma, are 
people allowed to see this every day, or only 
on holidays ?' *" 
The rooms at Howell's v/ere filled with hand- 
some and well-dressed women, all admiring and 
admired ; and the suite where the jewellery is 
displayed, exhibited a " chosen race of fashion's 
favourite sons," examining the bijouterie, and 
deciding on the relative merit of turquoises or 
sapphires for buttons ; or whether a Trichino- 
poly or Maltese rose-chain was the most distin- 
gue for the evening. At one counter was a 
young lady with her mamma, choosing her first 
ball-dress, and in deep consultation whether it 
should be virgin white or couleur de rose; and 
^t the next were two pale and melancholy- 
looking women, selecting grey and black for 
their second mourning for a mother.

Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester both mused 
on the reflections the scene around them gave 
birth to, but Lady Lucy could do nothing but 
wonder and admire ; and when music stole on 
her ear, and advancing to the place whence 
it proceeded she saw an exquisite clockwork 
group of Chinese musicians, and a rope-dancer 
performing evolutions, and pointing the light 
fantastic toe with a precision worthy of Mon- 
sieur Paul himself, there were no bounds to 
her childish delight, and she stood quite as 
amused as the beautiful children who were near 
her, applauding the graceful dancing and per- 
fect time of the Chinese. " Happy age, when 
every thing can please !" thought Lady Oriel. 
" How long will it be ere this fair creature 
has learned to look on all that now enchants 
her as coolly as I do ? May she at least be 
spared the lesson that has for ever removed 
the veil of enchantment from my eyes, and

" I thought," said Mrs. Forrester, " that 
this establishment had been peculiarly dedi- 
cated to ladies ; but I see here all the young 
men of fashion about town ! Do they come to 
admire the ladies, or the scarcely less beautiful 
objects of taste around ?"" 
" Both, I would charitably suppose," re- 
plied Lady Oriel. " How busy they all seem ! 
That group of young men are selecting waist-

whether a bracelet or a ring would be the most 
appropriate cadeau to the ' Cynthia of the

fond mothers ; and many a young man to pur- 
chase miUes jolies choses for the person dearest 
to him on earth, whose image, reflected in the 
glasses around, shares his admiration with the 
pretty things he is selecting; need I add, that 
person is  himself? Foreigners are more 
surprised at the magnificence of this establish- 
ment than at any other in London," continued 
Lady Oriel. " I once accompanied some French 
ladies here ; and they were so astonished at the 
display of riches at every side, that they could 
not for an hour pause to select the articles they 
came in search of. I remember one of them 
observed to me, that if Paris had such a house, 
half the husbands would be ruined, as French 
ladies cannot resist temptation as the prudent 
English do."

It was not without repeated hints that Lady 
Oriel and Mrs. Forrester could get Lady Lucy 
away; and she left Howell's declaring that, 
now she found it was not dearer than other 
houses, and had so much more beautiful things, 
she never would go into another; holding up 
her empty purse in triumph, the contents of 
which had furnished her with, as she said, fifty 
of the loveliest, most useful, and tempting 
things, when she thought that twice the sum 
could not have purchased half of them !

their way, Colonel Forrester proposed a wager 
to Lord Oriel, as to how many times within 
half an hour the two words " the people''' would 
be used in the first speech of a repealing 
member. 
This led to Mr. Desmond's observing, that 
these two words, though so continually used, 
never failed to produce a certain effect. 
" Joined together,'' said he, " they have a ma- 
gical influence that rarely fails to draw atten- 
tion, and acts as a claptrap to the lower classes 
of the community, as does some liberal senti- 
ment introduced into a dramatic performance 
and addressed to the gallery ; both are in 
general used for the worst purposes, and how 
seldom for any good ! Does a democrat wish 
to excite a tumult and draw attention, as a 
means of attaining some object of egotistical 
ambition, to gratify which the peace of his 
country would be readily sacrificed by him ?

' the people ' is the watch-word for revolt ; and 
repeated with due emphasis, gains him a crowd 
of idle followers, too lazy to work, but not 
ashamed to steal ; who throw up their hats, 
and give him their ' sweet voices !"'  the why or 
wherefore, they can hardly tell. Does a dra- 
matic writer bestow his tediousness on a suffer- 
ing audience, anticipating the fate of his maud- 
lin production ? he sprinkles it over with a few 
liberal sentiments, addressed to popular feeling, 
in order that the applause of the gallery may 
drown the disapprobation of the boxes and pit. 
Thus are the people and liberal sentiments made 
the tools of those, who never use them except 
for their own private ends, and who deride the 
folly by which they profit. It was truly ob- 
served by a French writer, that the people are 
always the instruments, and always the pretext, 
but never the object in a revolution ; and the 
termination of every revolution has proved the

truth of this observation  the people, who are 
the many, being sacrificed for the benefit of 
their democratical leaders, who are the few.*' 
They arrived in time to hear Mr. Manley 
make his admirable speech  a speech that posi- 
tively electrified the House ; and to witness the 
discomfiture of him, whose equivocating de- 
fence filled with disgust a nation accustomed to 
reverence veracity too deeply ever to shrink 
from its laws, whatever may be the conse- 
quences. Mr. Desmond had not been at the 
House of Commons for many years, conse- 
quently many of the faces of the members were 
unknown to him, but Lord Oriel undertook to 
point out the most remarkable of them. 
" That tall, thin, distinguished man, with a 
forehead that would have enchanted Gall or 
Spurzheim, I need not name to you, as every 
one knows Sir Francis Ramsbury, and I may 
add, every one esteems and respects him ; he is

THE REPEALERS. 275 
an admirable speaker, and what is better, an 
admirable man. The person next him you 
of course know ; he is your Secretary, Mr. 
Manley, a man of great talent and power, and 
formed to take a leading part in political life. 
He has all the requisites for a public man : 
high personal and mental courage, strict prin- 
ciples, and eloquence that never degene- 
rates into bombast or hyperbole ; he is always 
listened to with attention by the House ; and 
the man whom one of the Irish members de- 
nounced as the most unpopular man in Ireland, 
has the consolation of being one of the most 
respected in England. It appears that the 
office of Irish Secretary, which certainly, how- 
ever it may be a post of honour, is decidedly a 
post of danger, may now be considered as the

Robert Neil, and the present occupant ; and 
three such predecessors must always incite a 
successor to distinguish himself. By the by, 
there is Sir Robert Neil ; I hope he may 
speak, as few know Ireland so well as he, and 
none can describe what has come under his 
observation more forcibly, eloquently, or truly. 
He is an able man, and a perfect master of 
business; much too clever, and useful, not to 
make me wish he was employed. Such men as 
Sir Robert Neil, who have great stakes in the 
country, are the safest to be employed in steer- 
ing the bark of the state ; and we have too few 
who to great talents unite a large fortune, to 
spare the services of such a one, whose opinions 
carry so powerful an influence with the sensible 
part of the community, and who, having much 
to lose, cannot be suspected of being disposed 
to risk it by hazardous measures. That tall, 
gentlemanly-looking person, who has just en-

tered, is Mr. Hutler Lerguson, the warm and 
eloquent defender of the Poles. And there at 
his left you see the gifted author of a series of 
novels, any one of which must obtain for their 
author a literary fame rarely accorded to any 
author, but more particularly to one of his 
years, and still more rarely merited. That 
gentleman he is talking to, is his brother, a 
highly-gifted young man. The two gentle- 
men to the right are Mr. Errice, the brother- 
in-law of Lord Rey, and Mr. Makaully. The 
first is a most clever, sensible man of business, 
and the speeches of the other tell you better 
than I can, what his powers are. The Agitator, 
of course, you know by sight  there he is ; his 
countenance is good, and peculiarly Irish ; his 
voice well suited to the powerful bursts of elo- 
quence with which he inundates his auditors ; 
and it must be admitted, he is one of the most 
effective speakers in the world, as he dazzles

where he cannot convince ; and though he often 
leaves Reason free, he makes captive the Pas- 
sions, which but too generally prevent her using 
her freedom." 
*' You should see the effect of his eloquence 
on the Irish," said Mr. Desmond ; " it is ma- 
gical. When he said a day or tvvo ago that 
he represented Ireland, it was not so hyperbo- 
lical, as the expression borrowed from Louis 
XIV. by Napoleon, when he said ' Je suis la 
France P He represents the whole Roman Ca- 
tholic population of the lower class, for they 
only see, hear, believe, act, or think, as the 
Agitator tells them ; or rather should it be said, 
they represent hbn, being but the instrument 
of his will, wielded as he thinks fit. I wish 
Mr. Thiel would speak, though, perhaps, it 
may be as agreeable to read his speech, as to 
hear him dehver it. His mind is so imbued 
with poetry, that it comes forth without effort,

nay, as it were, malgrt hii, and his images are 
so poetical and forcible that one cannot help 
wishing they were embodied in a poem or 
tragedy, instead of in a speech. Thiel is a man 
of genius, and I am one of the many who wish 
that all such were addressing posterity by the 
midnight lamp at home, instead of addressing 
St. Stephen'*s, as it is easier to find good 
speakers than good writers; and of the best 
speeches that have been made on popular 
topics, how few will be read ten years hence ! 
I never come here," continued Mr. Desmond, 
" and hear the plaudits bestowed on any of the 
popular speakers, without reverting to other 
days, when Pitt, Fox, Grattan, Sheridan, and 
Canning, were wont to electrify the house. 
How often have I heard them, and owned the 
magic influence of eloquence kindled by genius. 
It seems to me as if the plaudits given to their 
successors awaken the echoes in the house of

death so near us; and that from their very 
tombs is sent forth a reverberation, to cheer 
others in the path in which they strove. From 
St. Stephen'^s to Westminster Abbey the dis- 
tance is short, but the road is difficult; and 
those who have traced it so gloriously, led on 
by genius, and supported by principle, sleep 
calmly the sleep of death, unmoved by all that 
could once animate their glowing souls, within 
a few paces of the scene of their past triumphs. 
What a contrast between the scene of turmoil 
and worldly cares before us,  the passion- 
stirring harangues, and the angry rejoinders,  
and the awful silence of the house of God, 
where reposes all that was earthly of those 
deathless souls !"" 
Lord Oriel, seeing that the old man was moved 
with the reminiscences he had called up, and 
fearing the excitement might be too strong, 
proposed to leave the house, and they returned 
home.

Colonel Forrester escorted Lady Oriel and 
his wife to Vauxhall, thinking that the more 
his sister was seen in public at the present crisis, 
the more advantageous it would be in checking 
the injurious reports circulated about her. 
Lords Montagu and Albany joined them ; 
the latter declaring that he had come to walk 
off the possible effects of a most inimitable din- 
ner at the modern Lucullus'*s, Lord Refton, 
where one was sure to dine in the salon of 
Apollo. 
" Youj Forrester, understand a dinner," 
said Lord Albany, '' and therefore I wish you 
had partaken of that which we enjoyed to-day." 
" Do pray, Lord Albany, instruct us novices 
in the mystery of la cuisine^'''' said Lady Oriel, 
" and tell us what you consider a good dinner ; 
and, if not impertinent, may I ask you to give 
us the menu of that which has elicited your 
commendation .?" 
" I am proud and flattered by the request,"

said the peer. " Indeed I take a pleasure in 
seeing a taste for the table extending, and in 
forwarding this rational taste as much as I can, 
by judicious praise when merited, and disap- 
probation when otherwise. Hitherto it has 
been a general observation, that the English 
know how to eat^ but not how to taste,  a re- 
proach that almost stamps us as barbarians. A 
faultless cook was not only meant to satisfy the 
appetite, but to excite it; whereas our bar- 
barous Anglais look more to quantity than qua- 
lity, and are satisfied with thinking they are 
eating French dishes, when they are devouring 
some entrees that no gargotier on the Boulevards 
at Paris would acknowledge. But to return to 
Refton's dinner  he had la bisque d'ecrevisse

" You really get poetical in your descrip- 
tion,'' said Colonel Forrester ; *' hitherto I have 
been of opinion that poetry proceeded from 
the heart, but I now begin to think it may 
originate in a neighbouring region.'* 
" My dear Forrester, if you interrupt me, 
I shall never get to the end of my menu,^' said 
Lord Albany. " Le filet de hauf etonne de 
son deguisement a la Napolitaine, Le quar- 
tier de chevreuil, fdchS d'etre marine, pour

Lady Oriel, and almost fear I have bored you 
too, as I have observed that in eating, as in 
all other sciences, it is necessary to discuss it 
con amove. But en verite, when I think of the 
vast obligation that this most admirable and 
useful of all the sciences owes to Refton, under 
whose fostering care it is daily extending, I am 
apt to grow enthusiastic."" 
The party were amused with the affected 
gravity with which Lord Albany dwelt on the 
subject, and Lady Oriel promised that next 
season she would consult him in the choice of 
an artiste de cuisine, as otherwise she should 
be afraid of inviting him to dinner. 
" Apropos to dinner,^' said Lord Albany. 
" A man is now passing, whom I cut last 
year for two reasons  first, that I found it 
easier to cut him than his fricandeauy which 
was impenetrable to the spoon, and the barba- 
rian advised me to try a knife; the second,

that the Goth had a puree de truffes ! Imaginez 
vons, a substance that should be croquante, 
served as puree! There was no speaking to 
him after such a solecism in civilization. I 
shall never forget the dinner he gave us that 
day. Soupe a la reine, tournee ; fish, guiltless 
of having seen its native element for weeks ; 
vol au verity qui auroit impunement affronte le 
vent cfest, les escalloppes de lapereau qui, comme 
dit Boileau, sentoient encore les choux dont Us 
furent nourris^ and the impenetrable frican- 
deaUf before named. I always judge of a man 
by his dinners ; and as they are the only things 
emanating from him that I can profit by, if 
they are good, I cultivate his friendship, if 
bad, I bow out of it, as no man ought to 
demand the sacrifice of his friend submitting to 
starvation or indigestion because he chooses to 
keep a bad cook. All men past twenty-five, 
and most men under it, seem to think

' Their various cares in one great point combine, 
The business of their lives, that is  to dine.* 
' So much superior is the stomach's smart, 
To all the vaunted horrors of the heart.' '' 
'' What a strange creature is Albany !" said 
Colonel Forrester, as they drove off from Vaux- 
hall. " To hear him descant on the mysteries of 
the cuisine, one would suppose that he thought 
of nothing else, and yet he is, perhaps, one 
of the best-informed men in England, full of 
talent, and with powers of being satirical, from 
the lightness and plaisanterie of his coup de 
pattes, that few ever possessed without abusing; 
but he is so thoroughly good-natured, that, 
unlike the generality of wits, he prefers his 
friends to his jokes, and suppresses many a one 
calculated to set the table in a roar."' 
" This is a great merit," said Lady Oriel^ 
in an age when people attend so little to 
the feelings of others, and think more of mak-

ing a reputation for wit than they regret un- 
making the reputations of half their acquaint- 
ance, for one is very often the consequence 
of the other. Half the plaisanteries that do so 
much mischief, and give so much pain, pro- 
ceed less from malice than from the desire to 
shine ; and this desire is so general, that people 
attempt to say sharp things, who can only say 
coarse ones. It is like endeavouring to cut a 
hard substance with a paper-knife ; the intention 
obvious, but the effort is unsuccessful. If, 
therefore, those who have really power to shine 
at the expense of their friends and acquaint- 
ance, use it not, they have double merit, and 
the more so, because the world seldom gives 
them credit for their forbearance."''' 
" It is strange," said Mrs. Forrester, '' to 
see satirical people so well received in society, 
even by those who suffer the most from them."" 
" It is precisely because they fear to suffer still

more, that they act the aimable,'''' said her hus- 
band ; " but of this be assured, that if satire 
was not universally acceptable, we should have 
fewer satirists. The very persons who affect 
to be shocked at some cutting epigram, pointed 
lampoon, or piquant anecdote, are the first to 
engage the author, or to repeat the eff'usion 
with a moral disclaimer, of ' How very shock- 
ing it is !' ' How ill-natured V and a hope 
that ' there was no foundation of truth in it.'" 
" Why, my dear brother," said Lady Oriel, 
*' where can you have formed such opinions 
of the world .?" 
" In the world, my dear sister," replied 
Colonel Forrester ; and be assured, there is 
wisdom in the old proverb, 
* Chi pensa male spesso I'indovina.' " 
" I shall grow afraid of you,"*' said Mrs. 
Forrester, with a glance, in which less of fear

you judge from self, and if you judge so harshly 
of the world, with such opinions, you cannot 
love.'' 
" Ungrateful that you are," said the adoring 
husband,

She placed her white and dimpled hand on 
his mouth, to stop the continuation of his 
address, and he kissed it fondly though she 
affected to chide him.

When we read the fearful catalogue of 
crimes that the Irish newspapers are filled with, 
it is difficult to believe that the people commit- 
ting them can have any of the good qualities 
with which we love to invest the Irish. Bravery, 
for which they are proverbial, is ill shown by

the most barbarous murders; and generosity, 
to which they are certainly not without claims, 
is not visible in the revengeful spirit that is but 
too often displayed in the vengeance with which 
they visit real or supposed offences. And yet 
they are brave, and generous, notwithstanding 
the enormities into which they are hurried; 
for their crimes, paradoxical as the opinion 
may appear, are but the excesses of the quali- 
ties we have named, and which, if cultivated, 
would produce flowers and fruit instead of poi- 
sonous weeds. 
Ignorance is the bane of the Irish peasant; 
it leaves him open to the tyrannical mental em- 
pire of those whom interested motives may 
lead to usurp it ; and, unguarded by principles, 
the only true barriers for resisting evil counsel 
or example, with excitable feeUngs, warm ima- 
ginations, and no judgment, he falls a ready 
victim to their designing arts.

" Don't you think, Jim dear,'' said Grace, 
" that it would be a good thing to write a line" 
(as a letter is always called in Ireland) '' to 
Miss Desmond that was, to ask her to spake a 
word to the dear ould masther, in favour of poor 
Patrick. Sure, if they were to transport him, 
'twould be a terrible thing ; I won't let myself 
think that they would do worse than that to 
him : but the notion of his being taken away 
from Mary, now that his eyes are open to his 
own folly, makes me very unaisy. Miss Des- 
mond, that is Mistress Forrester, would put 
in a good word to the ould masther, and the 
masther would spake to the King, and ask him 
lo write to the Lord Liftenant to let poor Patrick 
out of jail. Oh ! this is a good thought, and a 
lucky one, and I '11 write the letter before I 
sleep. Mistress Forrester is too good to refuse 
spaking to the masther. She was always kind ; 
and now that she has a loving husband of her

own, she '11 feel more than ever for a poor crea- 
thur of a woman that 's in danger of losing 
her's. The ould masther will never refuse her, 
for he is always glad to do a kind action ; and 
as for the King, I 'm not a bit afraid of his re- 
fusing the masther, for every one says he has 
the best heart in the world. The only one I 'm 
afraid of is the Lord Liftenant, for he being on 
the spot in Ireland, and seeing with his own eyes 
all the wickedness and mischief the foolish mis- 
guided people commit, won't be so aisy on pri- 
soners as the others ; but I don't think he '11 
refuse the King, if he writes him a line  and 
then we'll have poor Patrick home again with 
Mary."

asked;' 
Grace and Jim made a detour, that they 
might visit poor Mary Mahoney, and found her 
better and her boy much less feverish. She 
was filled with thankfulness at the good ac- 
counts of her husband ; but still the love of the 
woman triumphed over the prudence of the 
wife, as she expressed her hopes that poor dear 
Patrick wouldn't take it too deeply to heart, 
nor blame himself too much for their trouble. 
Grace assured her that Patrick now had a per- 
fect sense of his own imprudence, adding that 
they found him reading his Bible, the salu- 
tary effects of which study were already visible 
in his altered sentiments. 
This last intelligence gratified Mary beyond 
measure. " This is indeed," said the poor 
woman, " happy tidings for me, for I know by 
experience the comfort that blessed book will 
give him. Many and many 's the weary and sor-

rowful hour that I have been relieved by reading 
it, when poor Patrick first took to following the 
Repalers, and that I fell into fretting. I never 
opened it but that the words fell on my heart 
just like, as they tell me, oil falls on the sea, 
making it quite calm. And sure, how can I be 
thankful enough for knowing how to read, 
which opened this blessing to me ! How often 
have I lamented that poor Patrick was not read- 
ing it with me ! But just see the goodness and 
mercy of Providence, that out of every trouble 
can make good : Patrick is taken up for a crime 
of which, God be thanked ! he is innocent ; and 
the separation from me, and the death of our 
poor infant, has turned his mind to the only 
true comfort that can be found. There he is, 
in that solitary cell, reading the word of God, 
and fixing his thoughts on Him in whom alone 
is safety ; and I am thankful that his eyes are 
opened, though at the price of so much grief."

Mrs. Forrester, or Miss Desmond, as she still 
loved to call her, and the next day's post saw 
the following letter dispatched. 
" Most Honoured Lady, 
" In all my troubles, and I have lately 
had my share, you have always appeared to me 
as the guardian angel that was to save me. I do 
not now address you for myself, as, God be 
thanked, Jim has grown wiser, and I trust 
will never again give me cause for unhappi- 
ness. But Patrick Mahoney is pining in a 
prison, and his poor wife, Mar}^ Mahoney, is 
lying on the bed of sickness and sorrow, hav- 
ing lost one child ; and the rosy-cheeked curly- 
headed boy whom you and the dear mistress 
used to admire, is dangerously ill, while the 
loving husband and fond father is kept away 
from them. 
" It is in your power, dear and honoured

lady, to extricate him from the doleful cell in 
which he is now shut up, with no other com- 
pany but his own sad thoughts, and his angry 
conscience always reminding him that, had he 
followed good advice, he would now be at 
home with his wife and child. I pity Patrick 
even more than poor Mary ; because her con- 
science has not fallen out with her, and must 
be saying comforting things in the midst of all 
her troubles ; and sure, dear lady, it is a bless- 
ing to have a companion which we never can 
be rid of, like conscience  a friend, instead of 
a foe. 
" I thought of all this when I saw how she 
bore her troubles, and laid her dead baby in 
the coffin, with a look which I never can for- 
get ; it seemed as if she had found courage and 
consolation from a voice within her own mind ; 
and sure enough, that voice must come from 
conscience. But when I saw the care-worn

face of poor Patrick, and the tears falling down 
his pale cheeks  and oh ! for certain, 'tis a bitter 
sight to see a man weep  quite as different to 
the tears of a woman, as an April shower is to 
the pelting drops that are forced from some 
black cloud by the winter's storm  I thought 
to myself, dear and honoured lady, that it was 
a blessing when we had only to weep for mis- 
fortunes ; but that the scalding tears wrung 
from us by our own faults, if they leave their 
marks on the cheek, leave more fearful marks 
on the heart from which they spring. 
" Patrick is accused of being concerned in 
the murder of a policeman ; he is entirely in- 
nocent, God be thanked ! but he says, that if he 
had not been in the constant habit of leaving 
his poor woman, and being out at unseasonable 
hours in the night, he would not, he could not, 
have fallen under such a bad suspicion. What 
I beg of you to do, is to get the dear ould

masther to spake to the King; every one says 
he is a good, humane, tender-hearted gentleman, 
and to ax him to write a bit of a line to the Lord 
Liftenant, to let Patrick home to his poor 
wife. 
" What makes me so anxious at this present 
moment is, that the Irish Laider has been writing 
to tell us, that the soldiers are going to be 
let loose on us, like blood-hounds, and that in- 
stead of being tried by judge and jury, prison- 
ers are to be judged by young officers come from 
school, who would rather condemn 'em than 
not. I don't much believe all this, but still it 
frightens us ; so, for God's sake, send the ould 
masther to the King at once. Or may-be 
'twould be as well for yourself, dear lady, to 
spake to the Queen, for women are always ten- 
der-hearted, and can pity each other, and she 'd 
spake to the King, or may-be write to the 
Lady Liftenant to get poor Patrick off.

"Sure it would be a good thing, and a 
great service to Ireland, if the ould masther 
would just tell the King, that the quiet and 
dacent people in Ireland  and there 's many 
more of 'em than is supposed  are afraid of 
their lives of the wicked disturbers, that are 
bent on mischief, and are ready to kill, maim, 
or destroy all who won't join 'em. Many 's the 
poor men that goes with 'em through fear of 
losing their lives, or having their houses burned 
over their heads ; but if once they had soldiers 
and officers to take their parts, would give up 
all nightly meetings and disturbances, and sleep 
in peace.

people here out of their wits is, that they

friends, and they had confidence ; but you know, 
dear lady, how aisy it is to make a poor 
Irishman believe anything. My own poor 
honest husband was made to believe he was a 
slave and starving, when he was at liberty to 
attend all agitation meetings in the country, 
and had aten a hearty dinner off as elegant a 
piece of salt pork, as red as a rose, with cab- 
bage like the green leaves of young trees, so 
fresh and bright, and potatoes laughing out of 
their skins for joy at being aten.

The place is so beautiful, the sky looks more 
blue than ever, and the river more clear ; and 
as for the trees and flowers, sure they 're as 
bright in their freshness as if they came 
out spic and span new for the first time, 
though we 've now been looking at 'em, and 
a pleasant sight it is, for the last six weeks.

I 'm sure the English birds can't sing more 
sweetly, nor the flowers smell more delightfully, 
than they do at Springmount ; though all the 
world declares that everything in England is 
finer than here. 
" And now it 's time for me to finish this

I 'm sure you '11 pardon my boldness in writing 
it ; and yet when I think how many long miles 
'twill have to go over, and the wide green sea 
to cross before your own pretty eyes will look 
at it, I don't feel half so courageous as when I 
used to be tould to walk, up to Miss Desmond's 
room at Springmount, and that I used to tell 
you all that was passing in my poor ignorant 
mind. But here, you had woods, and mountains, 
and flowers, and green fields, about you, and 
seemed as fond of 'em as I am, which gave me 
courage to spake to you ; for I used to say to

Poor Grace's letter was read aloud at the 
breakfast-table by Mrs. Forrester, and though 
many passages in it elicited a smile, the sim-

ty*s representative in Ireland in favour of 
Patrick Mahoney, reminded him of the Roman 
Catholic custom in Italy of praying to God to 
influence their patron saint ; and it would be 
difiicult, if not impossible, to persuade Grace, 
that the Lord Liftenant, as she calls the Vice- 
roy, is not in Ireland a more powerful person 
than the King himself. 
Instead of obeying Grace's desire of address- 
ing the King, Mr. Desmond wrote to the two 
most influential magistrates in his county to 
interest themselves for poor Patrick, and make 
^ his innocence manifest  a proceeding she would 
have thought much less advisable than that 
which she counselled ; as Grace, in common 
with all the persons of her own class in Ire- 
land, entertained an implicit belief that interest, 
and not justice, was the best thing to be sought ; 
or rather, that the latter could only be ob- 
tained by the former.

A disrespect for the laws has long been 
prevalent in Ireland, and has led to the certain 
and injurious effects of a scepticism in justice. 
A criminal entertains a strong hope that the 
interest of his landlord, or some one else whose 
interest can be obtained, will save him from the 
merited punishment of his crimes ; and the in- 
nocent, though conscious of his freedom from 
the guilt imputed to him, is " afraid he '11 
suffer, for sure he has no interest to get him 
out of his troubles." The demoralizing effects 
of such a state of things is best proved by the 
actual condition of Ireland, where Law and 
Justice are supposed to depend on power and 
interest. 
" Well, what if I did give Jack Brohy an 
unlucky blow, that knocked the breath out of 
his body, and sent him to sleep in the church- 
yard, instead of his bed, sure the masther can 
get me off; he knows all them that will be on

the jury, and they wouldn't like to affront him 
by finding me guilty. And does not he know 
the Judge himself ? sure they all go to eat their 
grand dinner at the great house.'' 
This is the wa}'^ of reasoning and thinking of 
the lower classes in Ireland ; and until they are 
taught to respect the laws, and look with con- 
fidence for justice, there is little hope or pro- 
spect of their amendment. 
Every day's post brought Mr. Desmond let- 
ters from his agent and steward, filled with 
alarming accounts of the increasing tumult and 
disturbances in his county ; many of the houses 
of his tenants had been attacked, and plundered 
of arms ; threatening notices had been served 
on all disposed to pay tithes, or take farms at 
a higher rent than the former tenant paid. 
The steward stated, that the English bailiffs 
of several of the gentlemen in the county had 
received notices to quit their situations or pre-

pare for death, and that he feared he should 
shortly receive a similar one, from the indi- 
cations of wrath and ill-will he saw in the per- 
sons around him. 
When Mr. Desmond communicated the con- 
tents of these letters to Colonel Forrester, the 
latter told him that he thought it was their 
positive duty to return to Ireland, and endea- 
vour, by their presence, to restore tranquillity 
at least to their own immediate neighbourhood. 
While admitting the propriety of the measure, 
Mr. Desmond sighed at thinking how little in- 
ducement his native country held forth, even to 
the best-disposed of her gentry, to make it their 
permanent residence, when he, who had done 
violence to his taste, in abandoning the society 
of his English friends and connexions from a 
sense of duty, and never placing himself on the 
decried list of absentees, found himself no longer 
beloved or trusted by those to whom he had been

an indulgent landlord and kind protector for so 
many years. 
When Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. Forrester 
were made acquainted with the intention of 
their husbands to return to Ireland, they de- 
clared their determination of accompanying 
them ; though both the gentlemen proposed 
their continuing in England, being fearful of 
exposing them to the dangers of a country in 
a state of turbulence almost bordering on open 
rebellion, as Ireland was represented to be. 
The gaieties of London Mrs. Forrester could 
abandon without a sigh, but she felt the deep- 
est regret at the thought of being separated 
from Lady Oriel, to whom she had become 
fondly attached ; though she was comforted by 
the reflection, that they should leave her re- 
established in society, and her husband no 
longer suffering from either slights or indig- 
nities offered, or supposed to be offered to her.

When the ladies drove to Lady OriePs to 
acquaint her with their approaching departure 
for Ireland, they found her with Lord Oriel, 
to whom she had been complaining of the fa- 
tigues, mental and personal, which she was 
suffering in consequence of the continued round 
of gaieties and constant late hours to which she 
had lately been exposed ; and he was admitting 
that she looked ill and languid, and wanted 
rest. 
No sooner had Mrs. Desmond announced 
their intended departure, and her deep regret 
at their approaching separation, with her hope 
that at some period Lord and Lady Oriel would 
come to Ireland and see the future estates of 
their brother, than Lady Oriel, stealing a sup- 
plicating glance at her husband, exclaimed, 
" Oh ! how I wish that we were going with 
you ! how delightful to see the Lakes of Kil- 
larney, and th fine woods and mountains that

dear Frances has been telling me so much 
about !" 
Mrs. Desmond expressed how much gra- 
tified her circle would feel at such a visit, 
and Lord Oriel, to the joy of all, declared his 
willingness to accompany them to Ireland as 
soon as they pleased.

CHAPTER XXIII. 
" Wealth is the magic wand that makes all fair, 
However foul it might have been before ; 
It hides deformity, gives youth to age, 
Makes dullness bright, and blockheads pass for wits; 
Nay, glosses o'er our crimes, and gilds our vices. 
There are but two things wealth can never do. 
Give happiness, or add one hour to life." 
Old Play. 
It was arranged that Lord and Lady Oriel 
should accompany the Desmonds and For- 
resters to Ireland, and that they should leave 
London in a fortnight, to allow time for having 
Springmount put in readiness for their re- 
ception.

They were all invited to a grand fete at Mr. 
Vernon's, whose wealth and splendid style of 
living made him a conspicuous character ; who, 
though sneered at by the beau monde, as im 
nouveau riche, and a parvenu, yet found his din- 
ners, soirees, and balls, attended by all the indi- 
viduals the most a la mode in that beau monde. 
The influence of wealth over those who can 
never, in any way, benefit by it, is as extra- 
ordinary as it is general ; and in no way is this 
more clearly proved than by the facility with 
which a supposed millionnaire finds himself es- 
tablished in the aristocratic circles in London 
on something even more than on equal terms ; as 
there is a pretension and purse-proud assump- 
tion in a parvenu that leads him to take liberties 
in retaining the position he has usurped, which 
a nobleman would never dream of practising. 
The fete to be given by Mr. Vernon was ex- 
pected to be the most brilliant of the season,
## p. 313 (#321) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 313 
and Rumour, with her hundred tongues, was 
sending forth inflated descriptions of the pre- 
parations making for it. Temporary rooms, and 
new conservatories, were to spring up as if by 
the hand of enchantment, and all the flowers of 
all the gardeners around London were com- 
manded : nay, it was almost insinuated that a 
fine night was also commanded ; for what is it 
that wealth is not supposed capable of accom- 
plishing ? and that of Mr. Vernon was boundless. 
While all London, which means the fashion- 
able part of it, were anticipating the fete, let us 
take a peep at the givers, and, Asmodeus like, 
display the feelings that actuated two persons 
supposed to be amongst the happiest in London, 
it being the received and established opinion 
that wealth can buy happiness as well as other 
rare things. Were the interiors of many a 
mansion, where riches most abound, laid open 
to our view, we should discover the fallacious-

ness of this belief  a belief that forms no part 
of the creed of those who possess this envied 
wealth, though many have sacrificed youth, 
health, and affection to attain it, discovering, 
alas ! too late, that it cannot ensure that for 
which they have toiled. 
SCENE  THE MORNING ROOM OF MRS. 
VERNON.  A CONJUGAL TETE-'A-TETE. 
'' How often must I repeat to you, Mrs. Ver- 
non, that you mar all my projects, by the ex- 
treme civility of your manner ? I carefully ob- 
served your reception of our noble guests yes- 
terday, and blushed for the humility so appa- 
rent even in your curtsies. You were so little 
at your ease, and so thankful to your company, 
that you appeared more like the hostess of an 
inn^ receiving the gentry of her county, than 
the '<nistress of one of the most splendid man- 
sions in London, and the wife of one of the 
richest capitalists."

" I am sorry," replied Mrs. Vernon meekly, 
" that I have failed to meet your wishes. I 
am, as you know, naturally of a timid dispo- 
sition, and feel myself embarrassed among so 
many strangers. Besides, not having been in 
my youth accustomed to such elevated society, 
I cannot shake off a certain degree of shyness, 
when I see myself surrounded by persons of 
such importance, and hear announced the titles 
of individuals of birth, whom I never expected 
to know but by the newspapers/' 
" Pooh, pooh  that is all nonsense; recol- 
lect, that if the persons you now mix with have 
birth and rank to pride themselves on, (and 
proud and insolent enough are our aristocracy 
disposed to be, for these advantages) we have the 
aristocracy of wealth, which gives power and 
influence, and which we must make them feel, 
by receiving their advances with a careless 
politeness, which shows that we are by no 
means elated by them, but receive them as a

right, not as a concession. My son quoted 
Bacon to me the other day, as saying that 
knowledge is power. This I deny ; wealth is 
power ; every day proves it ; and this. Bacon 
seems to have known as well as I, or why did 
he not content himself with knowledge, of which 
I admit he had a good stock, without seeking 
wealth by means which, if we believe his contem- 
poraries, were not always strictly honorable.'^" 
" If you allowed me to differ in opinion with 
you," said Mrs. Vernon, in her usually gentle 
tone, " I should say that I think our aristocra- 
tic friends much less haughty than the gene- 
rality of our acquaintance. It appears to me, 
that their positions in society being established, 
they are not compelled to remind people of 
their claims, and consequently are more at their 
ease, and allow others to be more so, than our 
less elevated associates, who are continually 
making efforts to retain the places they have 
usurped .""^

THE REPEALERS. 317 
" You are wrong, quite wrong," replied the 
obtuse husband. " The very ease you talk of 
is a proof of their insolent nonchalance, as the 
French call it, and is to me much more offen- 
sive than all the self-important airs of the 
Davisons, Rowlands, and all the other million- 
aires on whom those great Lords and Ladies 
affect to look down, and receive at all their 
grand parties, only because they are rich. De- 
fend me from the condescension of your people 
of fashion ! I know them, Mrs. Vernon, I know 
them." 
" Then why seek them ?" asked the wife 
quietly. " With your opinion of them, their 
society cannot contribute to your happiness." 
" Will you never understand me, Mrs. Ver- 
non ? Why did I toil for years, why risk the 
fortune so hardly earned, in speculations that 
might have beggared me, but to gain power, 
and to confront those proud Nobles face to face, 
making them feel that there is a still higher,

prouder aristocracy than theirs, that of wealth. 
Yes, I do make them feel this, and they hate me 
for it. Those on whose estates I have heavy 
mortgages, or who have political views which 
my interest may forward, are all civihty. But 
look at the supercilious politeness of those who 
stand in neither of the predicaments I have 
named ; observe the affected indifference with 
which they view my pictures, statues, gold 
plate, in short all that in their hearts they 
covet. And can you then wonder, that 
though I seek them because their presence ad- 
ministers to my vanity, I detest even while 
making use of them ?" 
Mrs. Vernon sighed, but answered not: 
experience had taught her that her gentle rea- 
soning fell unheeded on the ear of her selfish and 
wilful husband, or only served to provoke harsh 
observations on her want of knowledge of the 
world and proper spirit.

" Recollect, Mrs. Vernon," resumed the hus- 
band, " that I will have neither your sister nor 
my brother, nor their sons and daughters, 
invited to our fete. This I am decided on ; I 
will have none but the very elite of fashion, as 
the newspapers term it, as nothing is so vexa- 
tious as to hear people asking the names of 
those, they meet nowhere else, and to know 
that these unknown individuals are our bro- 
thers, sisters, nephews, and nieces.'^ 
Mrs. Vernon ventured to remark, that were 
their relations to be seen three or four times, all 
questions w^ould cease ; but her husband casting 
a half angry, half contemptuous look at her, 
repeated his decision, that they should not be 
invited, and quitted the room, leaving his good- 
natured wife deeply pained at the mortification 
she must inflict on relations who were dear to 
her, and whose society constituted her chief en- 
joyment.

CHAPTER XXIV. 
" Vous demar.dez comment on fait ces grandes fortunes ? 
c'est parcequ'on est heureux. Dfes qu'on est dans le fil de 
I'eau, il n'y a qu'a se laisser aller." 
Mr. Vernon, commenced his career as a 
merchant with a good capital, a cool and calcu- 
latino' head, a heart that had so little influenced 
his actions, or feelings, that not only his friends, 
but himself, almost questioned its existence, and 
a sound stomach; the indulgence of which 
formed one of his principal sources of enjoy- 
ment. He passed the days of his youth un- 
tempted and untempting, until chance threw 
into his path Miss Bosville, the daughter and 
coheiress of a rich city banker, and to this cir-

cumstance, and not to her beauty, accomplish- 
ments, or amiable qualities  and shewas rich in 
all these did she owe the preference that Mr. 
Vernon professed, when he sought, and, aided 
by her father's advice, won her hand. 
The well-established reputation for exacti- 
tude and caution Mr. Vernon had gained in 
business, joined to his wealth and regularity of 
conduct, had won the approbation of Mr. Bos- 
ville ; and as there was nothing disagreeable in 
his appearance, and as he assumed a softness 
of manner calculated to please the young and 
amiable person he sought as a wife, she soon 
yielded to his suit, and in her twenty-third year 
became the wife of Mr. Vernon, who was ten 
years her senior. 
With little of the romantic in her feelings, 
and a less than usual portion of the imagination 
that falls to her sex, Mrs. Vernon possessed an 
affectionate disposition, an equal and sweet tem- 
per, great good sense, and an undeviating 
p5

gentleness, joined to a natural timidity, which 
lent a grace to her manners knd rendered her 
peculiarly formed to make an excellent wife and 
mother, and to be the focus of attraction and 
happiness in the domestic circle. 
Soon after the marriage of Mrs. Vernon, her 
sister became the wife of a junior partner in the 
bank of her father, and continued to move in 
the unfashionable, but estimable sphere of her 
early friends ; while Mr. Vernon, aided by the 
large fortune his wife had brought him, ex- 
tended his commercial connexions, and Fortune 
seemed delighted to shower on him her choicest 
favours, by realizing even more than his hither- 
to ambitious dreams of wealth. 
Years had flown, and each succeeding one 
had added thousands to the wealth of Mr. 
Vernon : he became noted on Change, quoted 
in the City, a principal sharer in loans, a large 
landed proprietor, and an influential member 
of Parliament, who would shortly, report

Stated, be raised to the peerage. He was 
the father of tWo sons, both in ParUament, 
and of two daughters, on whom he meant to 
bestow fortunes that must entitle them to 
marry with the highest. His house in London 
was a palace fitted up with all that luxury 
could invent or wealth command : the finest 
specimens of art in painting and sculpture 
were seen at every side ; and not only Danae, 
but Venus herself, and all the beau ideals of 
mythology, had yielded to the golden shower 
of this modern corrupter, and left the land of 
their birth to decorate the walls or niches of 
the new temple of Plutus. 
The chef-cfauvres of Benvenuto Cellini, 
with all the treasures of the cinqua cento, 
filled his cabinets treasures that afforded their 
owner no enjoyment save that of seeing the 
admiration and envy they excited. Vases of 
c vstal-de-roche, set in enamel, and enriched 
with sparkhng gems ; cups of onyx, and jars of

lapis lazuli and malachite, with the rich and 
laboured bijouterie of the time of Louis the 
Fourteenth, were disposed on stands of silver 
and ebony of curious workmanship : while the 
costly porcelaine de Sevres, of Turquoise blue, 
or the pale rose of Dubary, were scattered 
through the various suites of rooms, all vouch- 
ers of the wealth that had given to their pre- 
sent owner the spoils of the once proud palaces 
of the Eternal City, of Genoa the Superb, of 
Venice the Gorgeous, and of Florence ; of whose 
merchant princes, the riches, love of display, 
and ambition of the present possessor of their 
treasures, reminded one, though not of their 
taste,  for in this ^Ir. Vernon had no rivalry 
with the Medici, though master of some of 
their finest specimens of art,  of the excellence 
that their taste had called forth. 
The Library of Vernon House was the r?e plus 
ultra of magnificence. Bookcases of carved 
rose-wood, supported by Corinthian columns
## p. 325 (#333) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 325 
of the same precious materials, the capitals 
and frieze gilt, and crowned by antique busts 
of or-molu, contained all that ancient or mo- 
dern literature could offer. Large mirrors, de- 
scending from the architraves to the base, re- 
flected the fine proportions of the library, with 
the gorgeous bindings of the books, and the 
gilded busts and antique vases filled with the 
rarest flowers, that were distributed around. 
Behind the mirrors, which turned on a pivot, 
maps were arranged, and in recesses beneath, 
the celestial and terrestrial globes were divided 
by a facsimile of the Warwick Vase, in pure 
gold of colossal dimensions, filled with pot 
pourri, breathing of Araby the blest. Tripods 
of or-moki, bearing candelabres, were placed 
in front of the mirrors. The curtains were of 
crimson satin, trimmed with gold bullion fringe, 
and fell in graceful folds to the ground. 
The cornices corresponded with and joined 
the friezes of the bookcases, and, like them,

were in alto-relievo, representing subjects from 
the antique, executed in or-molu : the carpet 
was made to match the curtains, and its ma- 
terial was so thick that the foot fell unheeded 
on its surface, enhancing the luxury of the 
springy elasticity of its touch by its total 
absorption of sound. 
One end of the library opened into an 
orangery, with a marble fountain by Bernini 
in the centre, that sent its crystal streams in 
air ; and this again led into an aviary filled 
with the choicest singing-birds, whose notes 
mingled with the murmurs of the fountain, 
and led one to believe that one was far away 
from the murky atmosphere of London. The 
windows were of gold-coloured glass, reflecting 
a glowing radiance, and giving a Claude Lo- 
raine tint to all around. 
Wherever the eye rested, it was met by forms 
of beauty, and tints various as the rays of a 
golden sun setting into repose, that filled the

soul with delicious musings. The easy chair, 
the lounging sofa, the Grecian canopy, each with 
their table on castors, containing all the appa- 
ratus of writing, almost tempted the indolent 
by the facility they offered of describing the 
ideas the beauty of the scene was so calculated 
to give birth to. This was a sort of royal road 
to learning, where luxury wooed the student, 
presenting all that antiquity can boast to refine 
and elevate the mind, and all that modern 
civiHzation can afford for the luxuriant indul- 
gence of the person. 
Here, where genius might have essayed his 
pinions, and talent conveyed its impressions to 
ages yet unborn, the man of wealth, the 
heartless parvenu, made his notes of speculation 
of thousands to be acquired, influence to be 
gained, and friends to be left off, the scene pos- 
sessing no more power over his obtuse nerves, 
than the obscure counting-house where his 
ambitious visions first took flight.

Nothing in art can continue to dazzle but so 
long as we are unaccustomed to the contempla- 
tion of it. Let a person dwell for some months, 
nay, a few weeks, in one of the mansions that 
has the most struck his fancy, and he will 
find that by degrees his vision becomes so 
used to the objects which first enchanted him, 
that he soon ceases to be sensible of their pre- 
sence, or to feel aught more than that gene- 
ral complacency excited in the mind by 
being surrounded by agreeable objects. It is 
otherwise with the beauties of nature. The 
more the eye becomes accustomed to behold 
them, the more pleasure do they convey : each 
point of view gains a new interest by being con- 
trasted with others ; the diff*erent periods of the 
day or season change the appearance, and 
throw a fresh light over the scene, that prevents 
its ever becoming monotonous.

Uhuitre est malheureuse quand quelque longue mala-

Montesquieu. 
Mr. Vernon had neither grown wiser nor 
happier with his accession to riches. They 
opened new fields to his ambition, and as by 
degrees he reahzed the dreams which that en- 
croaching passion had engendered, he found 
the vista extended to an interminable distance ; 
the most remote point being always the most 
brilliant and seducing, holding forth hopes that 
there he might repose, and enjoy the good he 
had gained. But 
"Illusive hope still points to distant good."
## p. 330 (#338) ############################################
330 THE REPEALERS. 
A competency was the first object that lent 
activity to the exertions of Mr. Vernon ; this 
acquired, the prospect of v^ealth became the 
next point of attraction. But as wealth is com- 
parative, his ideas on this score enlarged with 
his means of acquiring it ; and he Avho would 
have considered himself at the acme of his 
ambition as master of a plum, had now arrived 
at thinking himself unlucky as a millionaire, 
unless a coronet glittered on his brow. 
But while seeking this imaginary good, a 
sentiment of dislike and envy to all who pos- 
sessed hereditary claims to its distinction, was 
prominent in his breast. He looked on their 
gaiety as insulting, their coldness as revolting, 
and their indifference as something not to be 
borne, at least, until he had gained the first 
step in the ladder that he meant to climb. 
He affected in conversation to despise the 
distinctions of rank, though rank was the

THE REPEALERS. 331 
sole end and aim of his existence : and yet he 
has been known to break forth into disbelief 
and invective, when some person has inadver- 
tently stated the refusal of some very dis- 
tinguished commoner,  some Burdett of the 
day,  to accept the Peerage, as if such a re- 
fusal was impossible. 
Mr. Vernon was so intent in looking forward 
that he had forgotten to look back, else might 
he have remembered the former points of his 
ambition,  points that had receded as soon 
as reached, and were thought of no more. Ex- 
perience might have taught him, that hitherto 
success had but excited him to new exertions. 
But when did man profit by the lessons of 
experience ? 
" Man never is, but always to be blest ;" 
and as long as Hope, Fortune, or Ambition, 
has a bauble to lure men on, they rarely pause

until the grave receives them, and ends their 
illusions. 
This has been, and will be the history of 
man, as long as the genus exists, thinking only 
of that future that will end but as the past, 
in disappointment, or that he shall never see. 
He who calls himself prudent, laughs at the 
extravagance of the thoughtless dissi pater of 
wealth, who, determined to enjoy to-day lest 
to-morrow come not for him, spreads around 
him the enjoyments that gold can procure, and 
lives to want the comforts that he has bartered 
for luxuries. This to the prudent man seems 
madness, or folly ; and he says, " I will keep 
my stores until unbounded riches have given 
me the means of enjoying all, and then I will 
indulge to satiety." But he recks not that 
the sense of enjoyment will then have passed 
for ever, and that the cup filled by the syren 
Pleasure can charm no more  Ambition takes

the place of Avarice, as Avarice has usurped 
that of Pleasure, all doomed to the same end  
disappointment. 
Mr. Vernon felt not that his days were fast 
fleeting in the pursuit of the imaginary good 
that had lured him on, and that enjoyment 
had not yet found him ; but he flattered him- 
self, that once elevated to the rank he had 
so long aspired to, he should enjoy repose when 
a coronet encircled his brow. But until that 
wished-for event, uneasy lay the head which 
anticipated it, though that head was pillowed

consciousnesss of being the master of countless

Mr. Vernon possessed a vague idea that per- 
fect happiness was only to be attained by arriv- 
ing at the fourth step in the peerage ; but he 
tried to stifle this thought, because he felt that 
his age gave him little chance of accomplishing

it, and consoled himself with the hope that, once 
a Lord, his feelings would change, and that 
he should begin to taste the pleasures he had 
hitherto put away from him, lest they might 
interfere with the grand object of his pursuit. 
The eldest son of Mr. Vernon resembled his 
father in selfishness and in ambition. A noble 
or generous feeling had never had a place 
in his breast; for egoism, vanity, and conceit 
had left little room for other passions. With 
the advantages of having passed his boyhood^ 
at Eton  that Macadamiser of hereditary 
distinctions  he was much less impressed with 
a respect for rank than was his father. He 
had approached too near nobility to be imposed 
on by the false notions adopted by those who 
see it at a distance ; and he found that the 
Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, Lord 
Johns and Lord Henrys, of the first and second 
forms, had nothing to distinguish them from

their untitled playmates, except what he could 
little appreciate  an open manliness and good 
breeding, the effects of that freedom from hau- 
teur and affectation that is, in general, a re- 
markable characteristic in the ancient nobility. 
This close contact with the young scions of 
aristocracy had taken off Francis Vernon's 
deference for them, and left him free from 
prejudices for or against them ; but Christ 
Church, with what he called its invidious dis- 
tinctions, excited his wrath ; and though he 
liked to lounge on the arm of a tufted col- 
legian, he disliked him for the badge that 
marked the difference in their birth, and longed 
for the period that would elevate him to rank 
and station. His father's well-calculated libe- 
rality had enabled him to maintain a promi- 
nent position at Christ Church : he had the 
best hunters, the best furnished rooms, gave 
the most recherche dinners the most frequently

of any man at Oxford, and piqued himself 
on having his rooms constantly filled with the 
elite of his circle, which he attributed to 
the attraction of his society, until a candid 
friend avowed, in a moment of abandon, that 
he, too, would adopt Vernon's mode of filling 
his rooms, by placing large mirrors in them,  
the sure plan of collecting visiters, and the 
only reflections a la mode at Christ Church. 
During his visits to the paternal roof in 
London or in Wiltshire, Francis Vernon was 
sure to engage some of his titled companions 
as guests, proud to display to them the un- 
bounded luxury that reigned there, and glad to 
show his parents and sisters the perfect equality 
with which he treated the owners of the high- 
sounding titles that he abridged of their rank 
in conversation, which never failed to be re- 
marked and rewarded by a complacent smile 
from his father.

Henry Vernon, two years junior to his bro- 
ther, resembled his mother in gentleness and 
amiability, to which he united firmness and 
decision, with considerable talent and general 
information. 
The sisters were handsome, showy, and ac- 
complished ; skilled in all the arts of display, 
and as ambitious and aspiring as even their 
father could desire. They were ready to lend 
themselves to any scheme to procure their ele- 
vation into that third heaven of their imagina- 
tion,  some ducal family. 
To accomplish this desirable object, dinners 
and balls in the season, select parties at Vernon 
Villa at Richmond, and shooting-parties in the 
autumn and winter were arranged, to which 
two latter, none were engaged that could mar 
the projects of the inviter, or distract the 
attention of the invited from the objects of 
attraction held forth to them. Earls h?d

the happiness of domestic life, and Barons had 
searched for the hidden shawls, or boas, and 
assisted the fair owners in enveloping their 
persons with them, evincing a tender anxiety, 
indicative of more than common interest ; but 
the Misses Vernons were not to be caught 
by aught less brilliant than the present pos- 
sessors or expectants of a Dukedom, and were 
voted by the aspirants to their favour as very 
amiable, but rather reserved, which was at- 
tributed to the old-fashioned notions inculcated 
by Madame Mere, instead of to the indiffe- 
rence of the young ladies. 
It is thus that vanity accounts for all that

Mr. Henry Vernon had acquired riches 
more slowly than his elder brother, and was 
content to enjoy them less ostentatiously. Sim- 
ple in taste and cultivated in mind, he looked 
on wealth as a means, and not as the end 
of enjoyment, and really found gratification in

the choice works of art and well-chosen library 
with which he had enriched his spacious and 
richly-furnished house. 
One daughter was the sole offspring of the 
ill-assorted union of Mr. Henry Vernon with 
the rich and handsome  or rather let us pay 
respect to the gifts of Nature by placing them 
before that of Fortune, and say, the handsome 
and rich Miss Oswald. When Mr. H. Vernon 
wooed and won this lady, he was more attracted 
by the roses on her cheek, and the lustre in her 
eye, than by the thousands that composed her 
dower, or the large expectancies that futurity 
promised he . She was so young and lovely, 
that Scepticism itself could hardly have doubt- 
ed that one whose beauty was so calculated 
to adorn the domestic circle, should sigh for 
a more extended theatre to exhibit her charms. 
Henry Vernon was not the first, and will not 
be the last man, who discovers that a beautiful

exterior may cover a cold and selfish heart. 
Such discoveries, like all that depend on ex- 
perience, arrive too late to be of advantage 
to him who makes them. All are ready to 
admit this truism ; but who ever was willing 
to profit by the experience of others, though 
offered ever so much below prime cost ? Hen- 
ry Vernon soon found that he could neither 
expect a friend nor companion in his wife ; and 
that he must be content to abandon the hopes 
he had formed of cTieerful evenings at home,  
his expected consolation for long hours of con- 
finement in his counting-house,  and return 
to his solitary hearth, to seek in the perusal of 
some new work to pass the hours wasted by his 
wife in a round of amusements, which appearing 
to her to be the sole end of existence, any at- 
tempt to interrupt them only produced re- 
proaches, ill-humour, and obstinacy.

in Mrs. Henry Vernon's feelings. The same 
round of heartless, joyless amusements conti- 
nued to fill up her time, interrupted by pe- 
tulant complaints of being left out of Mrs. 
Vernon'^s select parties, and expressions of an- 
ger and vexation towards her husband for what 
he could neither avert nor change. Henry 
Vernon had observed with pain his brother's 
intentional withdrawal from his society ; habits 
of youthful intimacy had cemented a brotherly 
affection on his side, which had never been but 
slightly participated by Mr. Vernon, and which 
pride and ambition quickly extinguished. 
Conscious that he was acting unkindly, he 
soon began to dishke the sight of his brother, 
because, by reminding him of his wilful neg- 
lect, it became a source of embarrassment and 
reproach. 
It rarely happens when we behave ill towards 
any one with whom we have lived on terms of

affection that dislike towards that person does 
not ensue ; and the less excuse we find in our 
own hearts for our unkindness, the more strongly 
do we entertain the disHke. We begin by being 
unkind, and we end by being unjust and cruel ; 
and it is well if we confine ourselves to feelings, 
and do not commit actions which wounded con- 
science will surely, though too late, avenge. 
Mrs. Vernon felt a sincere friendship and 
respect for her brother-in-law, whose society 
was so agreeable to her taste as to induce 
her to submit without a murmur to that of 
his wife, which was far from being congenial 
to her. She saw with regret her husband's 
cold and unbrotherly wish of withdrawing from 
anything more than an occasional intercourse, 
and felt pain at each interview, on observing 
the undiminished kindness of Henry Vernon's 
manner, which seemed like a tacit avowal that 
he knew there was no want of affection on her

part ; while the offended air and angry insinua- 
tions of his wife embarrassed and annoyed her. 
But if Mrs. Vernon felt pained at being com- 
pelled to withdraw from the intimacy of her 
brother-in-law's family, how much more deeply 
did she feel at being forced to confine her 
intercourse with a loved and only sister to 
occasional visits, formal dinners once or twice 
in the season, and now and then an affectionate 
tite-d-tite^ when both felt anxious to conceal 
from the other the consciousness that their 
intercourse was limited, and marked this con- 
sciousness by a careful avoidance of any refer- 
ence to the innumerable dinners, balls, and 
routs, the accounts of which so constantly filled 
up the columns of the " Court Journal," where 
the *' fashionable" or "elegant" Mrs. Vernon 
generally headed some leading-article in the list 
of fashionable intelligence. 
With that fine tact peculiar to women, and

which always exists in proportion to the warmth 
of heart and dehcacy of the person possessing 
it, Mrs. Burrell, the sister of Mrs. Vernon, had 
early observed the line of conduct Mr. Vernon 
had forced his wife to adopt, and that which 
she herself must follow, to save her affection- 
ate and sensitive sister from additional pain. 
Mrs. Burrell, therefore, avoided all allusion to 
the infrequency of their intercourse, and con- 
tented herself with showing an increased affec- 
tion in her manner when they met. 
By this delicacy, Mrs. Vernon was saved the 
pang of thinking, that while obeying the harsh 
mandates of a husband, she had either wounded 
or lost a sister's heart ; and the soft and con- 
tinued pressure with which she retained that 
sister's hand in her's marked how gratefully she 
felt this forbearing tenderness to her feelings. 
Less tact on either side must have led to 
most painful scenes. Temper, good-nature,

and aiFection, though precious in themselves, 
must fail to insure the happiness of those dear 
to us unless we also possess tact, the invaluable 
gift which is the true panacea that sweetens the 
cup of life, founded on forbearance, itself a vir- 
tue. Tact enables us to avoid wounding, and to 
repel wounds ; it is the sure indicator of good- 
ness as well as refinement ; for though the lat- 
ter lends additional charms to its practice, it 
is the former that gives birth to it. Tact, like 
Genius, must be inherent ; and cultivation only 
does for one what it does for the other, po- 
lishes and refines both, but cannot create either. 
I refer not to that spurious Tact, the off- 
spring of society, nursed by policy and edu- 
cated by deception, which enables people who 
dislike, or are indifferent to each other, to meet 
without any excitement or betrayal of angry 
feelings ; to show interest where none is ex- 
perienced, and to avoid all occasions of touch-

ing on disagreeable subjects. This, I admit, 
is best acquired in an intercourse with polished 
society ; but the Tact I worship is that which 
springs from the sensitive mind, with all the 
bland influences of kindness, blessed and bless- 
ing, the full-grown offspring of goodness. This 
Tact precludes the necessity of speech : a look 
suffices : a pressure of the hand, or total silence, 
is often more eloquent than all that language 
could express  
" El silentio ancor suolo 
Haver prieghi e parole." 
Mr. Burrell, with all his wife^s affectionate 
nature, wanted her philosophy ; he felt morti- 
fied, not for himself but her, at seeing her left 
out at all the brilliant fetes given by the 
Vernons; and when their acquaintance, with 
that want of perception so remarkable in a 
certain class, dwelt on the newspaper descrip- 
tions of such fetes, and appealed to Mrs. Bur-

rell for the particulars, the embarrassed looks 
and heightened colour of his wife, who was only 
embarrassed because she felt what was passing 
in his mind, increased his displeasure. 
Mr. Burrell was justly proud of his wife; he 
was aware of her merits; he had been accus- 
tomed to see her looked up to and respected by 
all his friends ; and as his fortune and position 
were highly respectable, he was shocked and 
humiliated at finding her unappreciated by her 
brother-in-law : and secretly accused her sister 
of a want of respect for her, or a want of spirit 
in vindicating what was due to herself, in thus 
tamely submitting to the imperious and un- 
natural dictation of her selfish and worldly- 
minded husband.

ment, and his second was lately gazetted in the 
Guards. Both were promising young men, na- 
tural and unaffected, fondly attached to their ' 
parents and to each other, and loving their sister 
with all that affection which a handsome and 
most amiable young woman is so calculated to 
excite in the breasts of brothers only two years 
her senior. She had been their playfellow in 
infancy, and was now the object of their fond 
interest and protection. Charles Burrell wrote 
to her detailed accounts of all he saw in his tra- 
vels ; purchased for her all that he thought she 
would like; and William made her the con- 
fidant of all his pleasures and troubles, the 
latter of light import and brief duration  while 
her father and mother looked on her as the 
sweetener of their existence, whose gaiety and 
unclouded gentleness shed all the blessings of 
a perpetual spring and sunshine over their 
lives.

Mr. and Mrs. H. Vernon and their daughter 
were in the library, waiting the announcement 
of dinner, the mistress of the mansion looking 
over the columns of " The Morning Post,*" 
where she saw the notice of the coming fete 
of Mrs. Vernon, with the programme of the 
intended aAiusements. Her brow curved, her 
eyes flashed, and her cheek assumed a deeper 
red as she perused the paper and recollected 
that she was not bidden to the pageant. She 
was about to express the angry feelings big 
within her breast, when the maitre d^httel 
announcing that dinner was served, compelled 
her to restrain the expression, though she did 
not conquer the anger. 
Mr. H. Vernon was too well versed in the 
temper of his wife not to observe the indications 
of a coming storm ; and his daughter had wit- 
nessed too many, not to have a foreboding of 
an approaching one. The presence of the ser-

vants imposed a restraint that was evidently 
borne with impatience by the mistress of the 
house, who cast from time to time angry glances 
at her husband, as she saw him help himself 
to some fresh plat, which, she had sagacity 
enough to discover, was done to prolong the 
dinner, and retard the disagreeable scene which 
he anticipated. 
Her patience became exhausted, when, at 
the second course, after scarcely more than 
tasting two or three of the entremets, he com- 
menced mixing sugar, oil, and vinegar, for 
some brawn, and she angrily observed, that 
he seemed unusually disposed to eat. Mr. 
H. Vernon answered, that he was rather hun- 
gry,  and felt his colour heightened at the con- 
sciousness of the want of truth of his reply, 
no less than at the tone of the remark that 
produced it. 
'' You bid fair, to-day," said his wife, with

one of her most spiteful looks, " to rival a 
certain friend of ours, who certainly resembles 
a zoophyte, in having a stomach but no brains." 
This observation Mr. H. Vernon had more 
than once heard his wife apply to his brother, 
and he was thankful she had not, on the pre- 
sent occasion, named him before the servants ; 
but, fearing some more open explosion of her 
anger, he sent away his untasted brawn, and 
became almost as anxious as herself for the 
disappearance of the domestics,  such was his 
dread of any exhibition before them ! 
They had no sooner left the room than Mrs. 
Vernon asked her husband, whether he had 
seen the notice of the fete to be given by his 
sister-in-law ; and, ere he could reply, she 
demanded how long he intended to support 
the cool impertinence of his relations, in thus 
passing them over: for her part, she would 
no longer submit to it ; adding, that it was

all his fault for not asserting what was due 
to her, if not to himself, and for not making 
some exertion to extend the circle of their 
acquaintance into the fashionable coteries, to 
which Mrs. Vernon had gained access, and for 
which she (Mrs. H. Vernon) was a much more 
eligible candidate, than her silent, frightened- 
looking sister-in-law. 
She then commented on the hrusquerie of 
Mr. Vernon, the insipidity of his wife, the flip- 
pancy and airs of his daughters, and the in- 
solent nonchalance of the eldest son  " All of 
which,*' calmly observed her husband, " proves 
that we are happy in not living more frequently 
in their society."" 
The anger of the lady blazed afresh at this 
reasonable remark. She said she wanted not 
their society  nay, she hated it, but she want- 
ed to take her proper place at their fashionable 
parties, among the people of high rank who 
frequented them.

Long experience had taught Henry Vernon 
the utter uselessness of reasoning with his wilful 
wife, and he rarely attempted a reply, except 
to avoid incurring her increased anger by the 
charge, often repeated, that his silence was an 
impertinent display of contempt towards her. 
He had tried to make her sensible how undig- 
nified it would be for them to show that they 
were mortified by the neglect of his brother ; and 
always recommended the maintenance of a dis- 
tant but civil intercourse between the families. 
Such- representations and recommendations had 
little effect ; he was accused of want of proper 
spirit  a favourite phrase with angry ladies  
and was constantly forced to bear, or forbear, 
in the angry discussions, replete with bitter sar- 
casms, to which each new grand fete of his 
brother's gave rise. 
Henry Vernon passed in the circle of his 
acquaintance as one who was governed by 
his wife : the men called him hen-pecked, and

the women quoted Mrs. H. Vernon as an ex- 
ample of a clever person, who knew how to 
manage her husband. 
It is thus that people often judge : the mar- 
ried individual who has the misfortune to have 
an incorrigible partner, is called weak because 
he submits to what cannot be remedied, though 
his submission evinces his superior strength of 
mind ; while the incorrigible person, who is 
endured as an incurable evil, is called clever, 
because she destroys her own happiness, and 
interrupts that of all around her, by the in- 
dulgence of a bad temper and false view of 
subjects, incompatible with cleverness, in the 
proper acceptation of the word. 
If we reflect on all the examples of hus- 
bands or wives that have been most govern- 
ed, we shall find that the submitting party was 
the most clever, and the governing one the 
most weak; unless, where the latter was so

gentle that the sway was not apparent, the per- 
son following the poet's heau ideal of the wife 
" Who never answers till her husband cools, 
And though she rules him, never shows she rules." 
A jealousy of being governed, and a desire 
of governing, are in general most frequently to 
be found in weak minds of both sexes ; and this 
love of rule joined to obstinacy, another charac- 
teristic of feeble intellect, renders such persons 
so incorrigible, that passive forbearance is all 
that remains to a husband or wife, so unhappily 
" paired, but not matched." Let not, however, 
persons so borne with rejoice in the belief that 
they are clever, but be thankful to the strength 
that yields to their weakness. 
Mary Vernon had naturally a quick temper, 
but the painful experience of the evils which her 
mother's violence produced, had taught her to 
correct it, without impairing that sensitiveness

and vivacity which generally accompany quick- 
ness of temper. We have described the minds, 
but not the persons, of some of our characters : 
this latter we must now attempt  and as Mary 
Vernon is before us, we will begin with her. 
She was in her eighteenth year, rather above 
than below the middle size, slight and elegantly 
formed, and possessing that roundness without 
which female symmetry cannot exist. Her com- 
plexion was exquisitely fair  that fairness which 
peculiarly belongs to very dark-haired women ; 
her cheeks slightly tinged with the rose of 
health, and her lips of the rich crimson that 
made her white and regular teeth look still more 
briUiant. Her face was perfectly oval ; her eyes 
a deep blue, shaded by silken eyelashes of 
raven hue, and surmounted by brows whose long 
and jetty arches added beauty to her fair and 
open forehead. Her hair, at a little distance, ap- 
peared to be black, but was of a rich brown, 
possessed of that golden reflection which is as

rare as it is beautiful ; her arms, hands, and feet 
might have served as models to the sculptor, 
and finished a form as graceful as symmetry, 
youth, and health could make it. Add to all 
this, a countenance varying and full of ex- 
pression, and Mary Vernon is before you, gen- 
tle or ungentle reader. 
Yet methinks I hear you say, " Why she 
is, then, that faultless monster (of beauty) 
that the world ne'er saw ; for, as yet, all that 
has been described is perfect.'** But, alas ! the 
beauty of Mary Vernon, like all earthly beauty, 
was imperfect; as all her female friends de- 
clared her nose to be nn pea retrousse, and her 
lips a little too full  two faults that none of her 
male friends could ever be brought to admit, 
though often assailed on the subject, with that 
pertinacity displayed by ladies in their love 
of truth, and their wish of making male con- 
verts to the justice of their opinions. 
On no subject is the discrimination of women

more visible than on that of female beauty. 
A blemish that might have for ever escaped 
the eye of man, (nay, such is the blindness 
of mankind on such points, might have ap- 
peared to him as something attractive) is at 
one glance detected by the quick perception 
of woman ; and with the kind wish of extending 
her discoveries, is made known to most of her 
male friends. This, which we call her love 
of truth and candour, is, by the ill-natured 
world, stigmatized as jealousy or envy, two 
feelings which we, who know the gentle sex, 
maintain to be foreign to their natures. 
Mary Vernon was a good musician, had a 
clear and sweet, though not a powerful voice ; 
excelled in painting, and possessed a knowledge 
of the elements of all the sciences necessary to 
form a rational and accomplished companion. 
No wonder, then, that with so many per- 
sonal and mental attractions, she was generally

admired, and had already refused more than 
one eligible offer for her hand. It was some 
lurking fear of the superiority of her charms 
drawing attention from, or provoking com- 
parisons with, those of his daughters, that 
influenced her selfish uncle, almost as much 
as his false pride, in excluding her from his 
fashionable reunions,  an exclusion that was 
by no means disagreeable to the two young 
ladies, who felt no strong predilection for their 
beautiful cousin. 
There were two people in Carlton Gardens, 
where the town mansion of Mr. Vernon was 
situated, who partook not his or his daughter's 
feelings of indifference to Mary Vernon ; nay, 
who felt for her a more than common interest 
and affection : these were Mrs. Vernon and 
her second son, who had long learned to esti- 
mate their charming relation. The son scarce- 
ly viewed her in the light of a cousin, owing

to the restricted intercourse of the families, 
which had produced a more tender, though less 
famiHar acquaintance between them. 
There is nothing so destructive to love as 
the familiarity that is engendered by constant 
intercourse in youth : this destroys illusions, 
and establishes a sort of sisterly or brotherly 
relation, that precludes other sentiments be- 
tween the parties. It is the reverse in more 
matured age : persons so thrown together, form 
attachments that become strengthened by habits 
of intimacy, that render them indispensable to 
each other, even after passion has removed the 
veil which had at first blinded them. Providence 
has wisely ordained, that habit should replace 
other and dearer ties, as a compensation for 
the decrease of passion  that fever of the heart 
and mind, which, followed by re-action, produces 
indifference, and all the somniferous train of 
feelings, or want of feelings, that form such
## p. 15 (#25) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 15 
a (Jreary contrast to the brilliant dreams from 
which the heart has awakened. Providence, 
the all-wise director of all, has decreed, that 
each season of life should have its own pecu- 
liar charm, and has given us habit, in our 
more mature age, to atone for the loss of the 
more passionate enjoyments of our youth. 
Habit it is which inures us to what was at first 
disagreeable, softens down what was harsh, and 
makes us feel our own insufficiency, by teaching 
us to depend for happiness on others. 
Ask those who have spent years together, 
perhaps often breaking forth into murmurs at 
their mutual defects, if they would change their 
partners for all the perfection that imagination 
creates to mock reality, and they will say, 
or they will feel, that such a separation would 
be insupportable, as habit, that forger of strong- 
est chains, has riveted theirs too indissolubly 
to be divided, except by death.

" It is too ridiculous," said Miss Vernon to 
her sister, " that mamma should make no ex- 
ertion to get us asked to the Duchess of De- 
loraine''s ball. It might be easily managed, 
knowing, as we do, half the people with whom 
the Duchess is most intimate : but mamma will 
do nothing, and papa seems for once paralysed, 
as he is deaf to all the hints I have given him. 
The Marquis of Tadcaster has asked me ten 
times if we go there, and, not liking to own

that we were not invited, I gave no positive 
answer. He has lately become more marked 
in his attentions; and this ball might have 
decided something. He is going immediately 
after to Scotland ; and, once there, who can 
say when we shall see him again ?" 
" I assure you," answered Louisa, " that 
I am quite as vexed as you are ; for I see the 
horrid perspective before us of a winter in the 
country, without the chance of forming any 
thing like a desirable alliance ; and, as we have 
now been out four seasons,  that is to say, 
you have been four and I three  it is quite 
time that we were settled. However, I am 
sure I have no chance until you are married ; 
and I must say, that I think you have waited 
long enough for a dukedom, and that it would 
be wise to catch at the first coronet that is 
supported by plenty of green acres, instead 
of doing penance at home.*" 
There was something unpalatable in the

observations of Louisa Vernon to the vain and 
irritable feelings of her sister, and their con- 
versations on marriage, the subject that most 
interested them, seldom concluded without the 
excitement of angry feelings. The vanity of 
both prevented their acknowledging the wounds 
inflicted; but these rankled not the less, and 
the young ladies were most anxious to succeed 
in their matrimonial speculations, no less for 
the sake of the splendid establishments they 
contemplated, than from the wish of triumph- 
ing over each other. 
Mrs. Vernon saw with sorrow, that worldly 
feelings had blighted all the sentiments of 
natural affection in the breasts of her daugh- 
ters. In vain she tried to lead them back ; for 
the path of nature, like that of virtue, once 
lost, is difiicult to be regained, and, like it, 
is only discovered with repentance for a guide. 
The generous and affectionate heart of the

mother was chilled by the cold and calculating 
selfishness of her daughters ; and they looked 
on her as une bonne bourgeoise, who had little 
knowledge of the world that they worshipped, 
and who could in no way assist their projects. 
As the fite drew near, they felt the necessity 
of bringing their admirers to a decided declara- 
tion, and determined to spare no pains to effect 
so desirable an end. Louisa's experience of 
three unsuccessful seasons had discouraged her 
ambitious hopes, and she had reasoned herself 
into the conviction, that, after all, a person 
might be very happy as a Countess ; a con- 
viction that the attentions of Lord Durnford 
had considerably helped to bring about. 
In the appearance of the Misses Vernon there 
was nothing to distinguish them from any other 
of the good-looking young ladies of fashion 
of the day. They were what might be called 
handsome ; but their countenances were so little

expressive of any of the qualities that fix sym- 
pathy or affection, that after one had allowed 
that they were good-looking, and had a certain 
air of fashion,  an air as distinct from that 
which distinguishes high hirth and high breed- 
ing, as is the false diamond from the brilliant 
gem it is made to copy,  there was httle else 
to be said. Beauty depends much more on 
expression than on feature, as all must have re- 
marked, who have seen plain features redeemed 
by that soul-beaming expression, which leaves 
the impression of beauty, or " something than 
beauty dearer," behind, bringing back faces to 
memory, the details of which inight not sup- 
port a strict scrutiny, but the tout ensemble 
of which captivated.

CHAPTER III. 
" A fete is one of the many palliatives for that common 
malady ennui, and, like most palliatives, gives but a 
temporary relief, generally followed by a return of the 
disease." 
The long looked-for f^te to be given by 
Mr. Vernon at length arrived, and was ushered 
in by torrents of rain, which poured from an 
early hour in the day, and continued with- 
out intermission, as if to prove to him, a truth 
he had lately seemed to doubt, namely, that 
gold cannot command all things. The tem- 
porary rooms, not formed to " bide the pelt-

ing of the pitiless storm," became inun- 
dated ; and temples draped with pale rose 
and celestial blue, ere half the day was over, 
were only fit to receive Naiades, and were 
totally inapplicable to the terrestrial nymphs 
and swains for whom they were arranged. 
Galleries and kiosks crumbled " like the base- 
less fabric of a vision,^' leaving many a wreck 
behind; and had Mr. Vernon contemplated 
the novel exhibition of a Naumachia for the 
amusement of his guests, he might have easily 
contrived to accomplish it, so plentiful was 
the supply of water on the leads, and in the 
garden, where the fete was to have displayed 
its greatest attractions. Triumphal arches lay 
prostrate on the earth, burying in their fall the 
rich and rare plants and flowers imported from 
all the nurseries round London ; and fragments 
of silk draperies, mingled with garlands of ar- 
tificial roses, were seen borne along the yellow

streams that urged their turbid course through 
all the walks in this lately beautiful garden. 
Variegated lamps were tossing in the breeze 
on the dripping branches that supported 
them ; and the drenched flowers, half covered 
by mould and gravel, gave an air of desolation 
and ruin, that seemed to warn millionaires how 
soon the elements may dissipate the fruits of 
their riches. 
Mr. Vernon viewed the scene of destruction 
from his dressing-room window, and as he 
saw the snowy and rose-coloured petals of the 
camelia japonicas and the blossoms of the 
other rare plants of his conservatory, hurried 
along by the hurricane, he bethought him of 
the truth of the proverb, that '' riches can make 
unto themselves wings to fly away.'' He mora- 
lized, not on the powers of Nature, but on the 
probable cost which this ill-timed freak of her's 
would entail upon him ; and the dire necessity

of receiving the guests of the evening in the 
splendid salons of his mansion instead of, al 
fresco, in the temples and gardens, on which 
he had expended such vast sums, to astonish, 
if not delight the beholder. 
The young ladies were still more annoy- 
ed by the unpropitious storm. They, unlike 
their papa, calculated not the expense, but 
the results of the destruction of the garden. 
They had contemplated all the possibilities of 
well-managed tete-a-tetes with their respec- 
tive admirers; the most judicious modes 
of eliciting declarations : and a fine night, 
and the silver moon shedding her radiance 
over all that luxury and wealth could combine, 
were considered as essential requisites in the 
stage decorations of the act of the comedy they 
intended to represent. An unusual softness 
of manner might be assumed, in a scene where 
Nature is exhibited as Nature is seen in a 
ballet; forced flowers and rare exotics might

serve as symbols of tenderness to lovers them- 
selves, the productions of the hot-beds of Lon- 
don fashionable forcing-frames ; and a thousand 
half sentences, " looks, and becks, and wreathed 
smiles," might be given to encourage languid 
admirers, beneath the glow of variegated lamps, 
and on the velvet of a green lawn, that would 
lose all charm in the blaze of the ball-room, 
with the feet gliding over the chalked floor, 
and the eyes dazzled all around by splendour 
and the heart gladdened by gaiety. No ! in a 
ball-room, no role but that of the brilliant 
danseuse could with propriety be played; and 
the only chance left was a stroll through the 
suite of apartments, when the languor of fatigue 
and heat might furnish a pretext for sighing 
for the countr}', regretting being pent up in 
London, and envying the supposed admirer, 
who would be so happy in Scotland, or wher- 
ever else his ennui might tempt him to go.

light fantastic toe in the garden, it would be 
necessary to change the costumes prepared, un 
peu en Berg^re a VOptra^ for something more 
analogous to the gilded salons in which the 
fete would be held. Aigrettes of diamonds 
must be substituted for wreaths of flowers, and 
robes embroidered in pearls, must take the 
place of Diaphane gauze, with bouquets of 
lilies of the valley and roses. 
Mr, Vernon, while his young ladies were at- 
tending to the momentous change of their de- 
corations, was ordering a double supply of wax- 
candles to be scattered through the suite of 
salons, that a blaze of light, emulating the sun 
its'^lf, should illuminate the chef-d'oeuvres of 
art that enriched their walls. 
The company assembled at the usual hour 
the usual faces, dresses, and smiles, were 
exhibited ; the usual affectation of not being 
pleased shown off, as if each had agreed that

it was indecorous, or at least vulgar to appear 
gratified at what was meant to give gratifica- 
tion, (the nil admirari being one of the adopted 
secrets of fashionable non-entity most generally 
followed,) and the usual nothings were re- 
peated. 
Lord Albany joined Lady Oriel and Mrs. 
Forrester, and amused them with his piquant 
remarks on the scene and on the principal actors 
in it. 
" Do you see Lady Danvers ?''^ said he ; 
" she is getting herself up in her role of a 
woman of fashion, but she is not calculated to 
fill the part well." 
'' Is it then so difficult a part .'^" interrogated 
Mrs. Forrester. 
" Cela depend,^'' replied Lord Albany ; " to 
you ladies nothing appears so easy, and nothing 
is so easy ; mais^ Lady Danvers finds it ter- 
rible up-hill work ; she wants to be an in-

fluential leader, the female Grey, Wellington, 
or Canning, of fashionable, instead of political 
life ; and, helas ! she is only formed to be the 
Billy Holmes, which means the whipper-in ; and 
between a leader and a whipper-in in fashionable 
Hfe there is as great a difference as in political. 
I could give a receipt to make a woman of 
fashion, if I saw a meritorious debutante for 
the part ; but I should as soon think of giving 
Ude's instructions how to dress a salmi de 
becassine to an under-housemaid, as my receipt 
to Lady Danvers; Tieither would do justice to 
them." 
" Pray let us be favoured with your rules," 
said Lady Oriel ; " and as we are going to 
rusticate in Ireland, there is no chance of our 
abusing the favour, by any clumsy attempts 
at the part."" 
" I must again remind you, Mesdames," 
said Lord Albany, " that to give i/ou sl receipt

THE REPEALERS. 29 
to make a woman of fashion would be ' to 
gild refined gold, or paint the lily ;' but if you 
command me to state what I should recommend 
to others, you shall be obeyed, the more readily 
that my woman of fashion must not be less 
than fifteen years your senior. Suppose a lady 
highly born, and highly bred, (mind, I don't 
say well-bred,) of at least thirty-five years old, 
married to a man of rank and large fortune. 
Beauty is of no importance ; but strong nerves 
are indispensable, as without these sinews of 
war, a leader of fashion cannot succeed. A 
good tournure is highly necessary, and a prac- 
tical knowledge of French and Italian cannot 
be dispensed with. The lady must have na- 
tural vivacity, and acquired self-command to 
control any unseemly ebullition of it ; she must 
have tact without talent, that is to say, she 
must not excel in conversation, writing, music, 
or any of the accomplishments that require

talent, as excellence in any of them wovild 
occupy too much of that precious time, which 
her duties as a woman of fashion require. So- 
ciety is to be considered the end and aim of her 
life. Dinners, balls, and routs, the only things 
that come home to our business and bosoms ; 
and all else, as insignificant and unworthy of 
attention. Politics, by which I mean a super- 
ficial view of the feuds of faction, must be 
familiar to her; and she must make up in 
warmth of zeal, for all she wants in real com- 
prehension of the questions agitated by the 
Guelphs and GhibeHnes of our day. A strict 
attention to la mode is necessary ; a lavish 
expenditure on her person, and a prudent 
regard to economy in all other disbursements, 
are recommended. A consciousness of superi- 
ority and power, with a philosophical indif- 
ference to the means employed to obtain it, 
and a stoical disregard to the feehngs of others.

is to be cultivated, and the exclusive system, 
that sainte alliance of the haut ton, is never 
to be abandoned. Beauty, wit, and talent, are 
to be voted unnecessary, or de trop ; and power 
is to be retained coute qui coute. All without 
the pale of her own circle are to be considered 
mauvais ton, and those unknown to her as 
being unknowable. She is to cultivate an in- 
timacy with the leading ambassadresses, render 
useful the received Corypheus's of fashion, and 
employ as her creatures the tolerated. One 
or two political leaders must be fixed at her 
receptions, as habitues, and their satellites are 
to be encouraged. Fashion is to be considered 
as the true object of a laudable ambition, and 
all else as accessories of little importance. 
Place this lady in a large and elegantly-fur- 
nished mansion in St. James's, Grosvenor, or 
Berkeley Square, give her a villa near town 
to which she may retire with a chosen few of

her clique during the summer, and a fine 
family seat in the country, where she may 
hold her state in the winter, surrounded by 
the magnates of the land, with a sprinkling of 
foreigners of distinction ; dress her head a hi 
Herbault, her bust a la Victorine, her feet 
a la Melnotte, and serve her up, with plenty 
of diamonds and pearls, and you will have a 
woman of fashion." 
The ladies laughed at the gravity with 
which Lord Albany repeated his receipt, and 
agreed tliat it would be thrown away on Lady 
Danvers.

CHAPTER IV. 
" Concealment is too frequently the consequence of 
guilt, not to be often mistaken for it." 
Lady Oriel had been talking to a group 
who were looking at a picture, by Titian, in 
the gallery at Vernon House, when the sound 
of a voice familiar to her struck on her ear ; 
she turned to look, and found the eyes of 
Lord Delmore fixed on her with a steadfast 
gaze. The impressions which the sight of him 
conveyed, were so mingled with all of pain and 
humiliation she had ever known, that she felt 
c 5

34 THE REPEALERS. 
a sudden faintness come over her; but, though 
ready to sink to the earth, she subdued every 
external symptom of emotion; and, affecting 
not to have seen him, walked to another room. 
This was the first time they had met since 
her return to town. She had seen in the 
papers that he had gone to Italy, and hoped 
he would remain there, until time had enabled 
her to lose the poignant sense of her own im- 
prudence which every recollection of him called 
up. She had learned to judge his artful con- 
duct with the same sincerity and severity with 
which she analyzed her own, and the arts by 
which he had so successfully compromised her 
in the eyes of their mutual acquaintances, being 
now unveiled, excited her indignation and 
contempt. 
How did she rejoice that Lord Oriel was 
not with her at this rencontre, as his presence, 
and the consciousness of the scrutiny with
## p. 35 (#45) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 35 
which he would examine her countenance, 
would have increased her agitation. She pro- 
posed to Mrs. Forrester to retire ; and, seeing 
Colonel Forrester at that moment enter from 
the House of Lords, where he had been to hear 
a debate, they both requested him to call their 
carriage, and left Mr. Vernon's house. 
Lady Oriel reflected with pleasure that in 
a very few days she should leave London, and 
trusted that she should not again meet Lord 
Delmore. She hesitated whether she ought to 
tell Lord Oriel of the meeting or not ; and, with 
the candour and delicacy natural to her, de- 
termined on doing so ; but, after a little reflec- 
tion, she thought that the mention of Lord 
Delmore's name from her lips would conjure 
up such a host of painful reminiscences in the 
sensitive mind of her husband, that she had 
not courage to introduce the subject. 
Here again the too susceptible nature of
## p. 36 (#46) ##############################################
36 THE REPEALERS. 
Lord Oriel led to mischief, because it was the 
cause of his wife''s concealing from him her 
rencontre with Lord Delmore ; a circumstance 
which, though trivial in itself, and which might 
naturally be expected to take place, he had 
not contemplated, from his believing that in- 
dividual to be abroad ; and though he would 
certainly have been pained at her telling him 
the fact, his was a temper to be deeply offended 
by her concealment of it. 
The first circumstance that leads to the 
necessity of a concealment between man and 
wife, gives the colour to their future happiness. 
How often do concealments proceed from the 
fear of wounding a susceptible mind, or ex- 
citing an irritable temper ! and when once a 
habit of dissimulation is established, the purity 
of conjugal affection is destroyed, though the 
affection itself may continue in all its pristine 
force. A delicate-minded woman, or a sensi-

tive man, discovering that even a trivial con- 
cealment has been practised, feels confidence 
impaired, and suspicion awakened ; the real 
motives are seldom examined, for people are 
not willing to believe themselves too suscepti- 
ble, or irritable, and would be offended at the 
supposition were it made to them. But as it 
is easier to act with candour than to conquer 
either disposition or temper, we have no hesi- 
tation in advising all husbands and wives to 
avoid concealment if they wish to preserve hap- 
piness, and not be deterred from a statement of 
facts by the fear of present annoyance, which 
leaves a much hghter impression than is made 
by a future discovery of them. 
There is something repugnant to the delicacy 
of affection in the consciousness that heads 
which repose on the same pillow should be 
occupied by thoughts which they dare not 
utter. Lady Oriel felt this the night of the

38 THE REPEALERS. 
fete, and affected to be asleep when Lord Oriel 
entered her room, to avoid a conversation in 
which she could not name the disagreeable 
meeting that even then agitated her nerves and 
wounded her feelings. 
" When,^' thought she, with bitterness, 
" will the effects of my folly cease to rise up 
in judgment against me? It is to it I owe the 
susceptibility on my husband's part that ren- 
ders concealment necessary." 
The Abbe de Chaulieu observed of Fonte- 
nelle, that he had the most kindness and the 
least feeling of any man he had ever known. 
This observation showed a profound knowledge 
of human nature; for though it may appear 
a paradox, it is nevertheless true, that persons 
the most remarkable for general kindness are 
those who have the least feeling ; deep feeling 
being always accompanied by an inequality of 
humour, that often precludes habitual kind-

THE REPEALERS. 39 
ness ; while the absence of feeling leaves us 
masters of ourselves, and ready to show those 
acts of civihty that are gratifying to the re- 
ceiver, and cost little to the giver. 
Lord Oriel was an exemplification of the in- 
compatibility of the two ; for no man possessed 
more feeling, and its excess produced the effect 
of want of kindness, by rendering him irritable 
when he most wished to be kind. A woman 
of less delicacy of mind than his wife, might 
have corrected this exuberant and unhealthy 
action of feeling, by an exposure to him of the 
pain it occasioned her ; but Lady Oriel attri- 
buted his morbid sensibility entirely to her own 
errors, and supported the sufferings it inflicted 
with the patience of a martyr. 
Lord Oriel had intended going from the 
House of Lords to the fete at Mr. Vernon's, 
but, having been detained later than he ex- 
pected, he concluded, from seeing many car-

riages leaving Carlton Gardens, that Lady Oriel 
had left it. He stopped at White's to look 
at the evening papers, and was reading one, 
his face shaded partly by the paper, when 
Lord Tadcaster and some other young men 
walked in, and gave a description of the fete. 
" Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester were the 
prettiest women there," observed Lord Tad- 
caster ; ." and so Delmore seemed to think, for 
he never took his eyes off the first, who blushed 
very becomingly when she caught his eyes 
fixed on her face." 
The observations ended here, and it seemed 
to Lord Oriel as if some one had pointed him 
out to Lord Tadcaster, and so stopped any 
farther remark. He felt his cheeks glow with 
rage and shame : at one moment he felt dis- 
posed to call Lord Tadcaster to account for 
having named Lady Oriel, and the next he 
thought, that as nothing positively offensive
## p. 41 (#51) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 41 
had been said, such a step would only excite 
fresh scandal, and revive the former. 
He was one of the last to leave White's, 
as he felt too much agitated to confront the 
persons he must pass to leave the room ; and 
in driving home, his mind was in a chaos, that 
made him dread an interview with his wife. 
Would she tell him of the meeting ? To name 
it, would be opening afresh old wounds, that 
both were anxious not to touch ; but not to 
tell him would be still worse, as denoting a 
want of confidence in herself and him too. 
Anxious as he was to ascertain how Lady 
Oriel would act on this occasion, he was re- 
lieved by finding her, as he imagined, asleep ; 
and as he looked on her beautiful face, with 
the silken fringe of her raven eyelashes rest- 
ing on the delicate rose-coloured cheeks, he 
breathed a prayer that no tear might leave 
its trace on those fair cheeks, and laid his head

42 THE REPEALERS. 
on his pillow, to seek in sleep an oblivion of 
the painful feelings that, during the last two 
hours, had been passing through his mind. 
But sleep pressed not his weary eyelids ; for 
thought after thought, and all connected with 
Lord Delmore, presented themselves. Did Lady 
Oriel know of his arrival in London when she 
proposed the visit to Ireland ? Why was she so 
afraid of meeting him ? Alas ! he was grow- 
ing unjust and suspicious to his own Frances. 
He felt his injustice, but he had no longer 
the power of checking it. If, however, she 
told him, as she would be sure to do on the 
morrow, that she had met Lord Delmore, all 
would be well ; but if not, he dared not think 
of the consequences. 
Little did he imagine that she who occupied 
all his thoughts was as wakeful, and nearly 
as agitated as himself, and from nearly the 
same cause. All her self-reproach had again
## p. 43 (#53) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 43 
been excited by the train of thought her inter- 
view with Lord Delmore had called up. His 
presence would revive the former scandal ; her 
husband would again become susceptible and 
unhappy ; restraint would take place of the 
confidence beginning to be re-established be- 
tween them ; and all this was the consequence 
of her past levity and imprudence. She sup- 
pressed the sighs that laboured in her breast, 
lest her husband should suspect she was not 
asleep ; but he, who believed her in slumber, 
gave a free vent to his, every one of which 
struck on her ear as a knell of departing hap- 
piness, and reproached her for being the cause. 
To a refined and sensitive mind, there is 
no suffering that falls so heavily on the heart 
as the consciousness of having inflicted un- 
happiness on those dear to us. Our own tears 
or sighs relieve the grief they spring from ; 
but those we cause, fall back with bitterness

on our breasts, and fill us with remorse and 
anguish. To have trifled with our own peace 
of mind, appears light in comparison with the 
complicated guilt of having destroyed that of 
one who loved and trusted us ; and Lady Oriel 
felt, that a woman who has been careless of her 
reputation, thereby wounding her husband's 
honour in its most tender point, can never more 
hope for that uninterrupted confidence which 
forms the only solid basis on which the hap- 
piness of married life can be built. Her heart 
melted within her, as she thought over the 
pangs she had inflicted on the noble and gene- 
rous breast beside her ; and she could have wept 
over him, if she dared, as all the past came 
in review before her.

CHAPTER V. 
" Suspicion is a heavy armour, and 
With its own weight impedes more than it protects." 
Lady Oriel left her chamber ere her 
husband awoke, and when they met at the 
breakfast-table, both laboured under a con- 
straint that each endeavoured, but in vain, 
to hide. A consciousness of something to be 
concealed pressed on the spirits of the wife, 
and a knowledge that something was concealed, 
wounded the feelings of the husband. 
Those whose susceptibility or irritability force 
their connexions to the painful necessity of
## p. 46 (#56) ##############################################
46 THE REPEALERS. 
concealment, are precisely those who are the 
most offended by it. With all Lord Oriel's 
natural goodness of heart and delicacy of mind, 
it never occurred to him, that his wife's silence 
on the subject of her interview with Lord Del- 
more proceeded wholly from the excess of her 
affection for himself, making her dread the idea 
of giving him pain. A less refined mind than 
hers would neither have anticipated the chagrin 
which the mention of Delmore's name would 
occasion him, nor have committed the error of 
having any concealment on the subject. But 
here were two people, fondly, warmly attached 
to each other, frittering away their happiness, 
from a too great similarity of dispositions and 
a too great refinement of ideas. A little less on 
either side might have saved them both from 
much misery ; but circumstances had, unfor- 
tunately, tended to increase their morbid sen- 
sibility, and they were now paying the penalty.

" How passed off the fete?" asked Lord 
Oriel. " I was on the point of searching you 
there, when I saw so many carriages coming 
away that I concluded you had left. The ball 
was very brilliant and agreeable ?" 
" Nothing remarkable," replied Lady Oriel. 
" On the whole, I thought it went off heavily, 
as the fetes at Mr. Vernon's generally do. He 
walks about with such an air of demanding 
admiration for his house, his furniture, his pic- 
tures, and ail that is his, that it makes one feel 
less disposed to accord it ; and then he seems 
so dissatisfied that his guests are not surprised 
or eblouis by his grandeur, that it makes many 
of them take a spiteful pleasure in affecting 
a nonchalance, even greater than they feel." 
Lord Oriel asked other questions; but still 
Lady Oriel mentioned not Lord Delmore, and 
he felt every moment more discomposed by her 
concealment. At length he arose from the

table, and affecting a careless air, observed  
" I heard another version of the fete from Lord 
Tadcaster, at White's, where I stopped to look 
over the evening papers. He mentioned hav- 
ing seen Lord Delmore there." 
Lady Oriel felt the blood rush up to her 
very forehead, from the consciousness of the 
false interpretation her husband might put on 
her concealment of this fact ; and her blushing 
reminded him of Lord Tadcaster's remark on 
the subject. 
" By the by," said he, with an air of pique 
Lady Oriel had never seen him exhibit before, 
" it will be absolutely necessary for you, either 
to give up going into society where you are likely 
to meet him, or to conquer the habit of blush- 
ing at his presence or at the mention of his name. 
Lord Tadcaster commented last night on your 
blushing most becomingly when you caught 
Lord Delmore's eyes fixed on you ; and you

THE REPEALERS. 49 
must be aware that nothing can be so likely 
to convey a false impression as your betraying 
any symptom of consciousness with regard to 
him." 
There was something in the tone and manner 
with which this was said that deeply wounded 
Lady Oriel. She felt that she was misunder- 
stood ; and her pride and delicacy, but above 
all, her affection, was wounded. 
Lord Oriel left the room, leaving her to shed 
tears, almost as bitter as those he had removed 
from her eyes some months before ; and a sense 
of his injustice mingled with her own self- 
accusations. 
" A few months ago,'* thought she, " I could 
have thrown myself into his arms, and confessed 
the motive of the concealment that pains him, 
without a single mental reservation. But now 
confidence is at an end ; for I have not fortitude 
to bear up against the clouded aspect and

evident unhappiness that any recurrence to 
that fearful event in my hfe produces in him. 
The consciousness of my own errors which 
oppresses me, and betrays itself by external 
marks, instead of meeting sympathy from him, 
who ought to understand me, excites only an- 
ger or displeasure. I ought to have left him 
when my imprudence had broken down the 
barriers of confidence ; for now, disguise it how 
I may, we are no longer happy, and our happi- 
ness no longer depends on each other." 
When Lord Delmore found that his visits 
would no longer be received by Lady Oriel, 
rage and mortification took possession of his 
mind. Not knowing the discovery she had 
made of the scandal which his attentions had 
excited, he attributed her door being shut 
to him to caprice, or to the representations of 
some busy, meddling friend. Lord Oriel, from 
what he had already observed of him, he was

THE REPEALERS. 51 
certain, would not have prohibited them ; 
therefore, the blame must rest wholly with 
Lady Oriel, and this manifestation of her per- 
fect indifference towards him, was most mor- 
tifying to his amour-propre. 
With all his vanity, Lord Delmore never 
believed that he had excited any warmer sen- 
timent than friendship in the heart of Lady 
Oriel, and all hope of this ripening into a 
warmer feeling had long been abandoned. 
But vanity urged the desire of making the 
world think otherwise ; and in proportion as 
he was convinced of her purity, he became 
anxious to convey to the world an impression 
to the contrary  an impression so easily con- 
veyed in the circles in which he lived, where 
idleness and the love of scandal render every 
new tale certain of a favourable reception. 
Positive dislike had taken place of the ad- 
miration he had felt for Lady Oriel, and he

inwardly resolved that she should suiFer for 
thus casting him off, without a word or a line 
of explanation, after the footing of established 
friendship on which he had been received by 
her for the last few months. 
He appeared at the clubs with a sombre 
air  talked of going abroad, having noiv no 
longer any inducement to stay in England  
said that Lady Oriel was the most divine wo- 
man on earth, and her lord the most jealous 
of husbands  adding with a smile, that it was 
strange, but true, that husbands never be- 
came jealous until it was too late to prevent 
the mischief they dreaded, and only locked 
the door when the treasure was stolen. 
Innuendoes of this kind continually repeated 
to the men of his circles, with confessions which 
he allowed to be wrung from him by the ques- 
tions of the indiscreet women, soon spread the 
evil reports he was so anxious to propagate.

When Lady Annersly and some of her clique 
asked him why he no longer appeared with his 
friend Lady Oriel, and how he contrived to 
exist away from her ?  a sigh, a pensive look, 
and a " Don't talk to me about it !  Poor dear 
soul, she is to be pitied, with her jealous brute 
of a husband !  It is really too bad, to have all 
one's comfort broken-up in this way !" implied 
all that he wished them to believe, while it also 
gave them to understand, that he was a most 
attached as well as attachable person. 
When such reports had been whispered in 
the circles of society for a week, and com- 
mented on in the clubs for a fortnight, it is 
no wonder that they soon after found their 
way into the newspapers, and were blazoned 
abroad with all the piquant emendations that 
a maliciously disposed editor could give them, 
until they assumed a form sufficiently pal- 
pable to impress the uninquiring with a belief

that what was so publicly asserted must 
be true. 
Had Colonel Forrester been in England at 
this moment, the first statement coming from 
the press would have been checked by a legal 
proceeding against the newspaper in which it 
had appeared, and this would have silenced all 
the others. But he, unfortunately, was absent, 
and the morbid sensibility of Lord Oriel ren- 
dered him totally unfit for taking any of the 
necessary steps to stop statements that filled 
him with indignation and sorrow, the falsehood 
of which he knew, but wanted knowledge of 
the world to know how to refute. 
How many people pass through life \nthout 
having acquired, or having sought to acquire, 
the practical knowledge necessary to render the 
journey less painful ! and how few are so fortunate 
as to be exempt from the circumstances that ren- 
der such a knowledge necessary ! Lord Oriel,
## p. 55 (#65) ##############################################
THE REPEALERS. 55 
shrinking from the publicity which legal steps, 
as he thought, would give to the scandalous 
falsehoods in question, was little aware that 
they were the only means left him of checking 
their promulgation ; and that the impunity with 
which paper after paper published the scandal 
was considered as positive proof of its truth. His 
supine and reprehensible negligence, or pride, 
had kept him from acting as the guardian of 
his wife's honour, and by his morbid feelings 
and want of worldly knowledge, he was now 
equally unfitted for being its avenger. 
Lord Delmore, having excited the sympathy 
of the frivolous and vicious part of the society 
to which he belonged, and the contempt of the 
good and sober-minded, determined on travel- 
ling for a few months. Change of scene, he 
thought, would amuse him, and confirm the 
impression he wished to convey, that he left 
England because he was separated from Lady

Oriel. He was as tired of the moors and moun- 
tains in Scotland as he had been before of 
the preserves of the best manors in Norfolk and 
Suffolk : he had explored the Lakes, and found 
them, as a certain tragic dame was reported 
to have expressed herself with regard to the 
" vasty deep,'^ ^' vastly wide and vastly pro- 
found."^ Wales was familiar to him. and, hke 
all familiar things, no longer desirable ; and 
Ireland, with its A\liite-feet and Black-feet, its 
Shanah- vests and Caravats, Captain Rock and 
Agitators, held forth no temptation. To Paris, 
therefore, he determined to go in the first in- 
stance, and, if that failed to amuse him, to 
proceed to Italy. 
By one of those extraordinary chances that 
so often arise in this world of chances, the first 
person he met on entering the steam-packet was 
Mademoiselle La Tour, the ci-devant femme de 
chambre of Lady Oriel. A few questions and

well-timed compliments elicited from her all that 
she knew, all that she suspected, and all that 
she thought probable about Miladi. " ]\Iilord

take de la fleur d'orange pour ses nerfs, or un 
peu de tilleul, Milord did tell her to go away, 
and did stay alone with Miladi, with de door 
locked; and when she came again, they have 
both so red eyes as if they cry beaucoup. Yet 
they were not very angry ; for they did look 
very loving, and Milord kiss Miladi's hand very

give her unjoli cadeau, and say she not want 
her no more ; and so she left her, and was now 
going to set up uiie boutique dans la Gallerie 
de VOrme ; and she hope Milord Delmore be 
one good friend to her, and she be one good 
friend to Milord ; for she counsel Milord not 
keep his valet de pied, Monsieur Henri, be- 
cause he is one havard tres dangereux, pour 
un Monsieur qui a du succes comme Milord.''' 
The whole secrets of Oriel House were now 
explained to Lord Delmore, and he saw plainly 
that the plans he had followed to produce a 
misunderstanding between the husband and 
wife, had only united them afresh and more 
tenderly than ever. He felt convinced that 
all his arts would be unavailing to establish 
himself again sur un pied d'^intimite with Lady 
Oriel, and rejoiced that he had left England, 
as his absence, much more than his presence.

would confirm people in the belief that he 
wished them to entertain. 
A liberal cadeau from his Lordship's purse 
found its way to the reticule of Mademoiselle, 
who, while accepting it, remarked that " It was 
not one wonder Milord was so aime par toittes

when he left her, she could not resist adding,

eye and une jolie tournure, which prove he is 
one bete.'''* 
Among the Enghsh at Paris, Lord Delmore 
acted the sentimental and serious, but consoled 
himself for this restraint by abandoning his 
naturally gay spirits to uncontrolled indulgence 
in the French circles into which he was admit-

ted. Madame la Vi scorn tesse de Beauregarde, 
the most spirituelle of the Parisian elegantes, 
declared him to be tres-bien pour un Anglais ; 
and her manner towards him, even more than 
her words, marked that, me7ne pour un Fran- 
cais, he would not have been considered other- 
wise than tres-aimable. 
He passed his time so agreeably at Paris 
that he thought not of crossing the Alps, and 
was only disturbed from the pleasing routine of 
amusements into which he had fallen by letters 
from England, announcing that his pecuniary 
affairs were so embarrassed that the raising 
supplies became every day more difficult ; and 
urging the necessity of his immediate return, 
for the purpose of adopting some plan of relief. 
He had long had a vague idea that he was 
ruined, but he had always chased the dis- 
agreeable reflection from his mind every 
time it had intruded itself. During a Lon-

don season, who has time or inchnation to 
think about his affairs ? and so many shoot- 
ing-parties are made up for the autumn, fol- 
lowed by the hunting season at Melton, that one 
never has a moment to give to disagreeable 
subjects ; so, from year to year, Lord Del- 
more, like many of his contemporaries, had gone 
on, putting off the evil day of examination, 
until a stoppage of the means of prolonging 
his pleasurable pursuits, forced on his mind 
the painful conviction, that examination was 
not only indispensable, but probably unavailing. 
" Well," thought he, " if I am ruined, I 
must only sacrifice my inclinations, and marry. 
This is a bore, to be sure, but there is no 
avoiding it, and," examining himself in the 
glass, " I flatter myself I shall have no great 
difficulty in making myself acceptable." 
He arrived in London only a few days before 
the f^te at Vernon House, and that was the

62 THE REPEALERS. 
first occasion of his appearing in public since 
his return from Paris. 
On seeing Lady Oriel, his first impulse was to 
approach her ; but, observing the circle around 
her, even he, with all his courage and non- 
chalance, dared not risk the cold reception he 
had a presentiment he should receive from her, 
a reception which would at once serve as a 
refutation to all the evil reports circulated 
about them. He hovered near her, hoping to 
find her alone for a moment, but, when he 
caught her glance, the expression of it con- 
vinced him he had better avoid any attempt 
at addressing her, and he saw her leave the 
room with sentiments much nearer akin to 
hate than to love. 
The good footing on which she seemed es- 
tablished in society was painful to him from 
two motives ; the first, that it seemed as if the 
evil reports relative to him were no longer be-

lieved, which was most mortifying to his vanity ; 
and the second, because he wished her to be 
punished for breaking off so uncivilly with him, 
a crime for which he never could forgive her. 
" Your virtuous women are such fools,''^ 
thought he : " now Lady Annersly, or Lady 
Flora Disbrow, or any of the women of that 
clique, would never have dared to cast me 
off, sa?is meuagement, for fear of provoking 
me to say something against them. But this 
lady, who has allowed me to exhibit myself 
as the humblest, though certainly not as the 
most unhappy of her adorers, at every ball, 
soiree, and fete, of last season, until we were 
considered as inseparable as married lovers 
in the first week of the honey-moon, now 
quietly cuts me, without so much as a word, 
look, or smile, totally regardless of my ven- 
geance." 
On leaving the salon, he met Lord Tad-

caster, who offered to drop him at Crockford's, 
and during their drive, they talked over the 
fete. Both agreed that old Vernon was a bore, 
and his daughters a little too demonstrative 
in their desire to wear coronets. 
" They will have fifty thousand each, I un- 
derstand,'' said Lord Tadcaster, " and as much 
more at the father's death ; a good fortune as 
times go ; and if I wanted money, I should not 
mind marrying the elder ; but that not being 
the case, I will leave her to barter her plum 
for a strawberry -leaf coronet, the object on 
earth she most longs for. I have no desire 
to give myself a beau-pere in old Vernon, or a 
heaufrhre in my friend and schoolfellow Frank, 
who, I think, is the most disagreeable of the 
family, perhaps because I know him the best." 
The fifty thousand pounds in possession, and 
a similar sum in reversion, sounded most agree- 
ably in the ears of Lord Delmore. To the

THE REPEALERS. 65 
young ladies he had never paid any attention, 
and hardly knew them asunder. But ri'importe, 
he should take the first opportunity of acting 
Vaimable to which of them he found the least 
disagreeable ; and he doubted not his success, 
provided he could conceal the ruinous state of 
his finances, the dilapidations in which became 
every day more apparent, and rendered some 
speedy relief more indispensable. 
Animated by the cheering prospect of Miss 
Vernon's thousands, of which already he anti- 
cipated the possession, and excited by cham- 
pagne, he sat down to hazard, and after three 
hours' play, found himself minus as many thou- 
sands. With an aching head and soured tem- 
per, he left the splendid salons of Crockford's, 
where the gilding lavished around seems to 
mock the dupes whose gold has paid for it.

" She is peevish, sullen, froward, 
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty ; 
Neither regarding that she is my child. 
Nor fearing me as if I were her father." 
The fete given by Mr. Vernon passed off, 
like the generality of such amusements, un- 
satisfactorily to the host and the guests; a 
thousand faults were found with the arrange- 
ments of it, and chiefly by those who had never 
given, nor were likely to give a fete in their 
lives; the ices were pronounced to be too cold, 
the rooms too much lighted ; and it was dis-

covered that a profusion reigned around, which, 
as the guests repeated to each other, clearly 
proved that the giver was a parvenu, a nouveau 
riche, in short, all but a person comme il faiit, 
though decidedly a person comme il en fauty 
as the world now stood, when money is the 
passport to society. 
Mr. Vernon had discrimination enough to see 
that his guests were more disposed to sneer 
than smile, or, if they did smile, it was in stich 
a sort, as left little doubt that satire, more 
than pleasure, produced the risible movement ; 
and he was as angry and disappointed, at what 
he termed their ingratitude, as if their amuse- 
ment had been his sole motive in giving the 
fete, and that an ostentatious desire of asto- 
nishing them, and forcing their admiration and 
envy, had not been his principal inducement. 
People seemed to render him responsible even 
for the badness of the weather, and various

comments were made on the absurdity of 
choosing such a night for a fete, as if his in- 
vitations had only gone forth that day. Host 
and guests stood on equal grounds with regard 
to their feelings towards each other, and both 
seemed perfectly to understand their mutual 
estimate. 
The Miss Vernons were the most disappoint- 
ed of all the circle, for neither the Marquis of 
Tadcaster nor Lord Durnford had proposed ; 
though all available arts had been tried to 
draw them to this desired and desirable point. 
The ladies felt that, notwithstanding their ad- 
dress, it was but too evident that the said Lords 
saw the pains taken to entrap them, and this con- 
viction served to render the would-be entrappers 
still more mortified at their want of success. To 
have condescended to use such arts and give 
such encouragement, humiliated them in their 
own estimation only because they had not at-

tained their object. Had they succeeded, they 
would have thought Httle of the means ; as it 
was, they felt as offended and angry at their 
projects being defeated, as if the Lords in 
question had been the wooers, instead of, as 
was really the case, being the wooed. 
The sisters retired to their chambers, discon- 
tented with the world and with themselves, and 
well disposed to vent a part of their ill-humour 
on each other. Before separating, Louisa 
Vernon inquired, " Well, has Lord Tadcaster 
proposed .'*'" 
" No," replied her sister, " and if he had  " 
" You would have jumped at him," inter- 
rupted Louisa ; " though I know you were now 
on the point of telhng me you would have 
refused him." 
A look of suppressed rage, and a sneer, re- 
paid this remark, as Miss Vernon spitefully 
replied, " I do not ask you if Lord Durnford

70 THE REPEALERS. 
has proposed, as your good temper explains 
the state of that affair ; so bon soir, ma chhre 
saur /*" and, humming an air to conceal her 
mortification, she quitted her sister. 
The family party met next morning at a late 
breakfast, mutually disposed to find fault with 
each other, and equally discontented with the 
fete. Mr. Vernon, as was usual with him on 
such occasions, and the occasions were not un- 
frequejit, expressed his dissatisfaction with Mrs. 
Vernon's too great civility to the guests, against 
the greater part of whom he was very acri- 
monious in his remarks, and then stated his 
displeasure at the too pointed attention paid 
by his daughters to the Lords Tadcaster and 
Durnford. 
The young ladies, little accustomed to be 
rebuked, pouted and looked sulky, and took 
so little pains to conceal their discontent, that 
the angry spirit of their father was kindled

afresh, and he demanded with a fiery glance, 
if, after all their advances, the young men had 
proposed ? " No," he added, replying to his 
own question, " they have not, and I could 
have sworn they would not : and so, after being 
bored last winter with them in the country, 
shooting all my pheasants, and playing off their 
fine airs, it has all come to nothing ! Well, 
young ladies, do not frown ; I must allow that 
this disappointment does not arise from want 
of encouragement on your parts."'

using the most perfect frankness with Lord 
Oriel, and conquering all fear of offending or 
wounding him by intelligence, that, coming 
through others, would be doubly mortifying. 
" I enter into your feelings, my dearest 
sister,*''' said he, " and admit that it demands 
courage to touch on subjects that one knows 
will give pain ; but be assured, that the ap- 
pearance of concealment is much more likely 
to wound than the mention of a name which 
he must often hear ; and you, by magnifying 
your own past imprudence, betray a conscious- 
ness of it, that will lead the malicious part of 
the world to draw false conclusions. You have 
no guilt to accuse yourself of, and therefore 
ought to be able to meet Lord Delmore with the 
calm indifference of a common-place acquaint- 
ance. Any deviation from this conduct will only 
tend to revive scandal, and confirm evil reports : 
therefore, when you encounter Lord Delmore

again, bow to him as to any other casual ac- 
quaintance. For the few days we shall be in 
town, it is necessary for you to appear as much 
in the world as possible, lest Lord Oriel should 
fancy that you are staying at home to avoid 
Delmore, or lest others may draw the same 
conclusion. I repeat to you, Louisa, that hav- 
ing done nothing to forfeit your own self- 
respect, you are to blame for the timidity you 
betray, and that, with a husband so extremely 
susceptible as yours is, you must conquer it, 
or else pass your life a martyr to its effects.'' 
When Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester were 
next day entering Kensington Gardens for their 
promenade, they met Lady Mary Tremayne, 
with the Miss Vernon s, escorted by Lord Del- 
more. They stopped to speak for a few mi- 
nutes, and Lady Oriel addressed the customary 
salutation to the latter with cold politeness, 
which he r 'plied to in the same tone.

The advice of her brother had such a good 
effect on her, that she felt she had, on this 
trying occasion, conducted herself without be- 
traying the least emotion, and she was rejoiced 
by this consciousness. 
On riding through the Park, Lord Delmore 
had seen the carriage of the Vernons at the 
gate at Kensington Gardens, and having had 
a levee of duns that morning, with sundry 
hints from his soHcitor and agent, of the im- 
possibility of pacifying them much longer, the 
necessity of seeking Plutus through the road of 
Hymen was more strongly than ever impressed 
on his mind ; and he resolved to lose no time 
in cultivating his acquaintance with the Miss 
Vernons. Knowing Lady Mary Tremayne, 
their chaperon, he joined the party, and find- 
ing Miss Vernon the most disposed to smile 
on him, from the recent retreat of Lord Tad- 
caster,  Miss Louisa still entertaining hopes of

Lord Durnford, which induced her to be more 
reserved to Delmore,  he acted the agreeable 
so successfully, that the Marquis was forgotten 
when they met I<ady Oriel. 
On leaving her. Lady Mary Tremayne, with 
the malice pecuhar to her clique, laughingly 
observed to Lord Delmore, that if this was the 
first meeting he had had with his old friend. 
Lady Oriel, since his return, she thought it 
had passed off very coldly. " Not a blush, 
a sigh, or even the appearance of trepidation," 
added she. " I should have expected, at least,

to this iveak7iess, though she has been accused 
of others." 
" Oh ! Lord Delmore must have met Lady 
Oriel chez nous,'''' said Miss Vernon. 
At this moment they were passing through 
the gate, when Lord Delmore, with an ex-

pressive look at Miss Vernon, replied, that he 
had not seen Lady Oriel at the fete, because 
he had eyes for only one lady there, and who 
could look at any other woman when Miss 
Vernon was present ? 
The young lady was as much gratified as 
surprised at the compliment, and congratulated 
herself on having already so well supplied the 
place of Lord Tadcaster ; who, notwithstanding 
all the encouragement given to him, had never 
said any thing half so warm to her. 
" Their hearts are different," thought she, 
little imagining that the difference was not 
in their hearts, but in their purses, and that if 
Lord Delmore's was only half as well filled 
as that of the Marquis, he would have been 
even more chary of his compliments. 
They parted mutually gratified. Having 
ascertained that they would be at the Opera, 
Lord Delmore pressed the hand of his belle on

assisting her to her carriage, and with a tender 
look rode away. 
When the ladies began discussing his preten- 
sions,  a common habit with ladies as well as 
gentlemen when any one leaves their circle,  
Lady Mary Tremayne observed, that certainly 
Lord Delmore was a very delightful person, 
handsome, clever, and agreeable. " I never see 
him," said she, " without being reminded of the 
compliment paid by Madame du DefFand to La 
Princesse de Talmont's appearance, when she 
said she had '' Pair distiriguee sans etre singu- 
liere,''''  the most rare thing in the world. 
Lady Mary Tremayne"*s opinion had great 
weight with the Vernons, merely because they 
knew she was very much a la mode; and con- 
sequently her praise raised Lord Delmore not 
a little in their estimation. Still there was 
enough of the family love of riches in the young 
ladies, to induce them to inquire if he had a

THE REPEALERS. 79 
large fortune, and sufficient amour pi^opre for 
her order de noblesse in Lady Mary, to en- 
gage her to answer, " Certainly," though she 
was totally ignorant on the subject ; and she 
added :  " not only has he a large fortune, but 
in case his uncle dies without marrying, which 
is very hkely, he is heir to a Dukedom." 
This last piece of intelligence quite achieved 
the conquest of Miss Vernon's head,  for heart 
was out of the question in her case  the only 
proof of her possessing that necessary organ 
in the economy of the human frame, being 
a certain palpitation at the left side after 
dancing. 
Discomfited as she had been by the retreat 
of Lord Tadcaster, without even leaving her 
the prospect of a proposal from him at any 
future time, nothing could be more opportune 
as a salve to her wounded vanity, than this 
new and brilliant conquest. Having left Lady

Mary Tretnayne at home, she could hardly, 
during her drive to Carlton Gardens, resist 
showing her triumph to her sister, sundry hints 
of which were given, and as carefully refused 
to be accepted by Miss Louisa, who had 
too much vanity and pretension of her own, 
to bear patiently with the display of her 
sister's. Nay, the insinuations of her conquest, 
so broadly given by Miss Vernon, almost de- 
termined her saur cadet to enter the lists with 
her, to dispute Lord Delmore's preference, and 
influenced her to take even more than usual 
pains in her toilette of the evening, and to affect 
un air empresse towards Lord Delmore, which 
she hoped might distract his attention from her 
sister. 
Mrs. Vernon had accompanied her daughters 
to the Opera, and was astonished to observe 
the vivacity with which they tried to captivate 
the new beau. He, with his usual tact, di-

THE REPEALERS. 81 
vided his attentions so equally, as to alarm 
Miss Vernon, and give hopes to Miss Louisa, 
rendering both more anxious to secure him ; 
and he was so respectful to Mrs. Vernon, that 
he interested even her in his favour. 
Lord Durnford's entrance to the box changed 
the scene, by renewing Miss Louisa's hopes ; 
and she now devoted her undivided attention to 
him, leaving her sister free to occupy all that 
of Lord Delmore; who, anxious to lose no time, 
plied her with compliments too plain to be mis- 
taken, and too well received, to leave any doubt 
of the final success of the needy cajoler. 
Miss Louisa, finding Lord Durnford's atten- 
tions by no means keep pace with her wishes, 
became indignant at observing the familiarity 
that seemed to have been established between 
Miss Vernon and Lord Delmore since she had 
commenced her conversation with Lord Dum- 
ford. To interrupt it, she pointedly asked the

latter, if that was not his friend Lord Tad- 
caster in the box at the opposite side? and 
being answered in the affirmative, she spitefully 
observed, that he had been for the last two 
hours so occupied with the lady next him, that 
she had not been able to see who the lady was, 
his head being continually interposed between 
them. 
Miss Vernon felt all the malice of the re- 
mark, and well knew the feeling that dictated 
it : but it only served to make her more anx- 
ious to secure her present conquest, to accom- 
plish which she redoubled her complaisance to 
him. 
On passing through the round room, leaning 
on the arm of Lord Delmore, she was most dis- 
agreeably surprised by finding Lord Tadcaster 
giving his arm to her cousin Mary Vernon, 
to whom he appeared to be paying marked 
attention ; while Mrs. Henry Vernon, leaning

THE REPEALERS. 83 
on her nephew, stood by her daughter, ex- 
ulting in the admiration her beauty excited, 
and the evident conquest which that beauty 
had achieved ; for Lord Tadcaster's assiduity 
was too undisguised to be mistaken. 
How did Miss Vernon now rejoice, that 
Lord Delmore's attendance saved her from the 
mortifying position of being delaissee ! and he 
who was au fait of the encouragement given t< 
Lord Tadcaster, determined to take advantage 
of the pique his desertion must excite in the 
breast of the young lady, who, he was certain, 
would be now most anxious to prove that her 
affections had never been engaged to Lord Tad- 
caster, by openly displaying a preference for 
himself. 
Occupied as Lord Delmore was in securing 
the prize he sought, he was forcibly struck 
by the beauty of Mary Vernon, and wondered 
not that Lord Tadcaster had found it so irre-

sistible. " When do you start for Scotland P'"* 
asked Delmore. 
" I know not," replied the other ; " perhaps 
not at all." And then turning to Mary Ver- 
non, he resumed his conversation with her, with 
an air of interest that betrayed how much she 
influenced the sudden change in his plans. 
Louisa Vernon cast sundry malicious glances 
at her sister, as if she wished to say, " You see 
you have been months trying to retain him, 
and Mary only knows him one day, and the 
shooting-party is abandoned." 
Nothing of all this sisterly intention was 
lost on Miss Vernon ; for those who are the 
most malicious, are the most sensible of the 
malice of others. Her conquest of Delmore 
alone enabled her to meet it " with decent 
dignity." How could she be grateful enough 
to him for saving her from a position so em- 
barrassing to her vanity ? But one way sug-

THE REPEALERS. 85 
gested itself, and she readily adopted it  that 
of leaving no means untried to convince him of 
the pleasure his attentions conferred. Ere he 
handed her to the carriage, he had made all 
but a positive declaration, and she had done 
all but accept him. 
The next day the Miss Vernons found them- 
selves again at Kensington Gardens, chaperoned 
by Mrs. Murray, a lady whose sole recommen- 
dation was, that she passed for being fashion- 
able ; a distinction due to a large fortune, and 
a fondness for rank, which induced her to sacri- 
fice all her time, and much of her wealth, to 
assemble round her all who could boast it, pro- 
vided they were of the elite. She conde- 
scended to chaperon the Vernons occasionally, 
because they were considered " catches'" by the 
younger sons of many of the Lady Mammas 
of her acquaintance, and it gave her an 
importance with them ; and the young ladies

86 THE REPEALERS. 
preferred her as a chaperon to many others, 
because she knew everybody, and was past the 
age of pretending to attention for herself. 
Lord Delmore met them accidentally, though 
Miss Louisa's spiteful glance at her sister 
seemed to insinuate that the meeting was not 
one of chance ; and the pertinacity with which 
she engrossed the conversation of his Lordship, 
betrayed her determination to interrupt the 
confidential entretien she supposed her sister 
wished to hold with him. 
Next to forwarding her own personal in- 
terest, was the pleasure Miss Louisa felt in 
defeating that of her sister ; and on this point, 
if on no other, a perfect sympathy existed be- 
tween them. Had Lord Durnford, or any 
other fashionable beau been present, with whom 
Miss Louisa could have commenced a flirtation, 
she would have permitted Miss Vernon to en- 
gross the attentions of Lord Delmore without

THE REPEALERS. 87 
interruption ; but to be compelled to fall back 
on Mrs. Murray, and leave her sister mistress 
of the field, was out of the question ; so she 
maintained an uninterrupted fire of words, 
smiles, and sallies, that scarcely allowed time 
for her mortified and angry sister's edging 
in a word, and made Lord Delmore ready to 
exclaim, * 
'^ How happy could I be with either ;" 
nay, almost led him to fear, that both ladies 
had made up their minds to share his coronet ; 
an intention which he foresaw would be very 
embarrassing to him. 
Miss Vernon pouted and sulked, because she 
wished her admirer to give some decided proof 
that she was the object of his attention ; and 
this he was too well bred to do in the present 
state of affairs, knowing that such a step would 
make an active enemy of Miss Louisa. 
The party sauntered along the umbrageous

walk, unmindful of the beautiful verdure, and 
all that Nature offered to charm them, occu- 
pied with feelings little in harmony with the 
calm scene around, when, arriving at the end 
of the walk, they encountered Mrs. and Miss 
Burrell, escorted by Lord Durnford. The Miss 
Vernons stopped to speak to their aunt and 
cousin. 
Now was the turn of the elder sister to cast 
spiteful glances at Miss Louisa, as if to show 
her, that she observed something more than 
common in the attentions Lord Durnford was 
paying Emily Burrell ; and when, after ex- 
changing a few common-place remarks, the 
parties separated. Miss Vernon observed aloud, 
" that Lord Durnford seemed to be very much 
in love with her cousin,'' though she could have 
seen nothing to justify the opinion in the few 
minutes they had been together, and it was said 
solely from the wish of wounding her sister.

THE REPEALERS. 89 
We may be told this is not nature, and that 
such characters as the Miss Vernons do not 
exist, they are fortunate who have not met 
such ; but we beheve few are so lucky ; for 
every day's experience proves that society offers 
many examples where the ties of kindred, 
instead of being considered as bonds of union, 
are looked on as fetters that bind discordant 
souls together, and give a privilege to each 
for venting the acrimonious observations and 
ill-natured hints which good breeding banishes 
from mere acquaintances. 
PoHteness, that cementer of friendship and 
soother of enmities, is nowhere so much re- 
quired, and so frequently outraged, as in family 
circles ; Vaimable franchise which near relation- 
ship is considered to warrant, serves as an ex- 
cuse for all the disagreeable truths that enemies 
discover, but that only friends can tell the 
possessor. Friends can see defects with the

naked eye, however weak that organ may be ; 
but too frequently require magnifying glasses 
to discover good qualities. 
How strange is it that people should not 
feel, what every hour^s experience must tend to 
prove  the necessity of practising politeness. 
With strangers and acquaintances, all admit 
the necessity of observing it ; but in nearer, 
and what ought to be dearer connexions, it is 
continually abandoned, and the consequence 
is, that all the illusions of life are destroyed, 
and with them much of the happiness ; for we 
are unfitted to receive or bestow it, if we have 
been told of faults or defects, mental or per- 
sonal, the discovery of which destroys our 
self-confidence, and sours us towards the dis- 
coverer. 
By politeness we would not be understood 
to mean the flattering insincerity that too often 
passes current for it, and than which nothing

THE REPEALERS. 91 
can be more different. Forbearance towards 
errors and defects, and a just appreciation of 
good qualities, joined to mildness and good 
breeding, is what we would inculcate, as the 
surest means of preserving domestic harmony, 
and of promoting domestic affection. Half the 
pains bestowed to conciliate acquaintances, 
might turn relatione into friends ; a meta- 
morphosis more rare and difficult to be accom- 
plished than most people imagine. 
It was Cosmo de' Medici who observed, that 
" we are commanded to forgive our enemies, 
but not our friends," implying that the injuries 
or wrongs inflicted on us by the latter are un- 
pardonable. One thing is quite certain, namely, 
that we have more frequently occasion to for- 
give those who are reputed to be our friends, 
than our enemies, and the injuries they commit 
are more pernicious and lasting in their effects. 
At dinner at Mr. Vernon's, Miss Louisa ob-

served, that Lord Tadcaster seemed wholly 
occupied with her cousin Mary the night before, 
a piece of intelligence that seemed to mortify 
her father even still more than it had done her 
sister. " Where could they have made his 
acquaintance ?" demanded the parvenu, as if he 
was the only nouveau riche who received Lords. 
But when his son observed that I^ord Tad- 
caster had asked him, the night of the fete, 
if Mrs. Henry Vernon and her daughter were 
in the room, and showed evident symptoms of 
disappointment at discovering they were not, 
Louisa said, with a bitter smile, " Oh ! then 
I suppose his tendresse for Mary is of some 
date." Mr. Vernon cast a look of rage at her, 
and of contempt at Miss Vernon for having 
been duped into the belief that she was the 
object of Lord Tadcaster's attentions. 
Mrs. Vernon really pitied the mortification 
of her daughter, and felt grieved at the un-

kindness of Louisa, who thus increased it ; but 
Miss Vernon, with an air of affected noncha- 
lance, changed the subject, by telling her mother 
that they had met Mrs. Burrell and Emily, 
escorted by Lord Durnford, at Kensington- 
Gardens, and that he seemed much smitten 
with Emily. 
This completed the ill-humour of Mr. Ver- 
non, who observed, that he should not at all 
wonder if both the Lords proposed to their 
cousins, though he was quite sure no pains 
would be taken to induce them to do so, for 
neither Mr. Henry Vernon nor Mr. Burrell filled 
their houses in the winter with stupid young 
men, as some others were foolish enough to do, 
who after all had their daughters left on their 
hands, season after season ; a reproach that 
deeply wounded the vanity of the young ladies, 
and showed the want of feeling of the father.

" Love is a passion whose effects are various ; 
It ever brings some change upon the soul, 
Some virtue, or some vice, till then unknown, 
Degrades the hero, and makes cowards valiant. 
" As love can exquisitely bless, 
Love only feels the marvellous of pain ; 
Opens new veins of torture in the soul, 
And wakes the nerve where agonies are born." 
The morning of the departure of the Des- 
mond party arrived, and Lord and Lady Oriel 
joined it with alacrity ; he to be away from 
the possibility of meeting Lord Delmore, who

was hateful to him, and she to be removed 
from the busy world, which had become irksome 
to her. Coldness and restraint had subsisted 
between them since the luckless night of the 
fete at Vernon House, but it was not the cold- 
ness or restraint of sated affection or indiffe- 
rence ; it was the forced calm of a too warm 
interest that feared to trust itself to words. 
The contrarieties that had arisen to cloud 
the horizon of Lord Oriel's wedded life, had 
awakened the slumbering energies of his love, 
and the doubts and fears that in general pre- 
cede marriage, had in this instance followed 
it ; for never had either the husband or wife 
been so anxiously alive to their mutual feel- 
ings as at present. They were not happy, 
but they were not indifferent, and we all know 
it is easier to still the waves of passion, than 
to break the dead sea of indifference, which, 
hke the lake Asphaltes, destroys the energies

of all that approach it, until, like the birds who 
are said to drop lifeless on its dull surface, the 
heart sinks to rise no more. 
No sooner had the party felt themselves free 
from the confined air of London, and the 
shackles which its conventional modes impose, 
than their spirits appeared relieved as if from 
a load that oppressed them, and cheerfulness 
took place of the former restraint of Lord 
and Lady Oriel. Neither had ever travelled 
the route they were now pursuing ; the objects 
that presented themselves were fresh, and acted 
as a stimulus to their feelings, diverting them 
from the beaten track that had lately and 
painfully occupied them. 
Arrived in Wales, the rural inns, rustic at- 
tendants, picturesque points of view, and above 
all, the Welsh harpers, offered such new and 
piquant attractions, that they expressed them- 
selves charmed with their journey, and when

they reached Holyhead, where they found the 
excellent and amiable Captain Skinner on hos- 
pitable thoughts intent, waiting to conduct 
them to his comfortable residence, where a 
good dinner awaited them ; they allowed that 
Irish hospitality extends even to this side of 
the water, and duly appreciated the reception 
which the veneration and aiFection entertained 
for the Desmonds had insured for them. 
They embarked the next day, under the 
auspices of the good and agreeable Captain 
Skinner, and, favoured by propitious gales, 
made a quick and pleasant passage. The Hill 
of Howth, lifting its blue head to the skies, and 
standing forth as a guardian to the island it 
bounds; the Wicklow mountains fading into 
distance, and the beautiful bay, with all the 
picturesque scenery that encircles three of its 
sides, struck them with wonder and delight, 
and they could not resist expressing their sur-

prise that a scene so calculated to excite ad- 
miration was so little talked of or written about 
that it burst on them unawares. 
No sooner were they landed on terra-firma 
than they were surrounded by groups of beg- 
gars, all beseeching their charity, love, and 
pity in the various tones of Eastern, Western, 
Southern, and Northern brogues, as rich and 
mellifluous in sound as flowery in sense. The 
Creator, Heaven, the Saints, and Angels, were 
all called in as witnesses to the necessities 
and merits of the petitioners. One declared 
that food had not passed his lips for days, 
though the steams that issued from them bore 
witness that liquids of the strongest quaUty had 
not been excluded  and another averred that 
she was dying, in language that proved it was not 
from inanition. An old woman vowed that the 
last breath of life was leaving her, as a blue 
vapoury smoke emitted from her lips,  proceed-

ing from a short pipe stuck in the corner of her 
mouth, and sending forth nearly as much smoke 
as a small steam-engine,  gave signal that the 
mechanical powers which impelled it were in full 
vigour : while a lame man, who hopped with ex- 
traordinary velocity on his crutch, catching the 
halfpence that were thrown amongst them, call- 
ed the saints to witness that he was a poor crip- 
ple who could not move hand or foot, and was 
obHged to pay a creathur to put the snuff into 
his nose. 
" Sure if you are," said a blind man, who 
was near him, '* you can find the way to your 
mouth purty well, without paying any one, 
except the shebean shop/' 
" Arrah what 's that to you, Cupid ?" replied 
the cripple. " I wish I had half as much moun- 
tain dew in my stomach as you have, although 
I 'd then be almost as blind." 
While breakfast was being prepared atHowth,

the gentlemen strolled through the village, and 
seeing a group standing round a piece of water, 
they stopped to examine what was going on. A 
man was endeavouring to get his dog to jump 
into the water after a stick ; but all his efforts 
were vain, and each failure produced peals of 
laughter from the bystanders. 
" Does your dog often take to the wather ?"' 
asked one of them with a sly look. 
" Yes sure, when there 's plenty of oaten 
or barley-meal on it," replied the other ; and 
the group acknowledged the pleasantry with 
shouts of laughter. 
The blind beggar now joined the party, and 
a wag, who seemed a privileged person, asked 
him  " Well, Cupid, if you had a glass of 
whisky given you, what religion would you 
make it?" 
'' Faith, I'd make it a Protestant!" replied 
he ; " for I 'd take the beads off it anyway."

There was something so new to Lord Oriel 
in seeing misery sporting jests, that he could 
not resist giving a shilling to Cupid, who pray- 
ed that his Honour and Grace might, like him, 
never be able to discover that a rosy cheek 
can fade and a sparkling eye grow dim. "And 
sure, your Honour," added the mendicant, 
" that 's more than my namesake Cupid can 
say; for by all accounts, though he's blind, 
he soon finds out a change in beauty, and does 
not much like other people''s mothers though 
he 's so fond of his own."" 
Mr. Desmond was amused with Lord OriePs 
astonishment at the naivete of his countrymen, 
and led the way to the stand of jingles and jaunt- 
ing-cars at the entrance to the town, in order that 
he might see some specimens of the rare genus 
to which the drivers of these vehicles belong. 
They were sauntering about with stockings

ing over their shoulders, and each with a short 
pipe in the corner of his mouth, whose column 
of smoke seemed to direct its course towards 
the eye that overlooked it. 
A fat Englishman, whose rotundity of person 
spoke more for his good living than for his abste- 
miousness, was endeavouring to make a bargain 
with one of the drivers ; and having declared that 
he would not pay more than eigh teen-pence 
to be conveyed to Dublin, the driver, after 
examining him from head to foot, pulled off his 
great-coat and threw it over the head of his 
horse, and then advancing, offered to assist 
his passenger to mount the jaunting-car. 
" Why, what do you mean by covering your 
horse's head in that there way?" asked the 
Englishman. 
" Main .^" said the driver ; " faith, I main 
that he should not see you ; for if oncet he

my life, he 's so 'cute.'' 
They entered the meat-market, and Lord 
Oriel was gratified at observing the cleanliness 
that reigned around, which he had not been 
prepared to expect. A fat, elderly man was 
looking at the meat in one of the stalls, and the 
butcher addressed him, hoping that he would 
become a customer. The man declined, saying- 
he was merely a traveller, who had stopped to 
look around him. 
" Oh ! sure if that 's the case," answered the 
butcher, " will you just do me the favour to let 
me call the buyers and tell 'em you deal with 
me.^ for, as you're in such good condition, 
it will be the making of me." 
The fat man passed rapidly on, apparently 
ill-satisfied with the compliment paid to his 
obesity ; and Lord Oriel observed to Mr. Des- 
mond, that even while transacting their busi-

ness, it seemed that the Irish could not resist 
a joke. 
'* It is very true," replied the latter ; " and 
so strong is this tendency to the ridiculous in 
their natures, that it mingles even with what 
is most grave, and renders it doubtful when 
they are in earnest. They are a fine race, full 
of generous sentiments, but volatile, unsteady, 
and inflammable, partaking much of the qua- 
lities of the Lazzaroni of Naples, but more fiery ; 
a distinction which may originate in the dif- 
ference of their favourite beverages, the lemo- 
nade and acqua fresca of the Neapolitan being 
more cooling than the whisky of the Irish." 
When they returned to the inn they found 
a crowd of beggars still around the door ; who 
having discovered that an English Lord was 
among the arrivals, hoped his Lordship's Ho- 
nour and Glory would tell the English when 
he went back, " that they (the Irish) were as

would lead to sundry awkward questions rela-

knew must terminate in an expose, as little 
likely to satisfy the paternal feelings of a 
cautious father as of clamorous creditors; he 
therefore considered it wiser to engage the 
affections, or rather let us call them, the affec- 
tations of the young lady, and by an elopement 
assure himself of her hand, and trust to pater- 
nal and maternal affection for pardon. 
Miss Vernon had experienced the withering 
influence of five seasons ; a lustre that un- 
fortunately adds no lustre to female charms, 
though it marvellously tends to quicken and 
enlighten the perceptions of spinsters, and, in 
decreasing their attractions, increases their ex- 
perience. She, therefore, determined to accept 
what she considered to be the disinterested 
offer of Lord Delmore, who declared that he

loved her too passionately to contemplate " the 
law's delay," and that he dared not on this ac- 
count formally demand her hand of her father. 
What a triumph to a heartless coquette of 
twenty-two was this avowal ! an avowal she had 
been almost tempted to believe would never be 
made, from the ill-natured insinuations of her 
sister, who had proved herself to be Lord Del- 
more's best friend, by appearing to doubt the sin- 
cerity of his sentiments for Miss Vernon. How 
delightful to demonstrate to the world, and 
above all to her sister, that she was sought for 
herself alone ! There was no resisting this 
temptation ; more especially when the lover 
insinuated that her sister had tried to be her 
rival : and she consented to elope with a man, 
who, if his statement relative to her sister had 
been true, was, from disclosing it, unworthy of 
her preference. 
The persons most easily duped are the tho-

roughly good, who, unsuspicious of evil in- 
tentions, detect them not ; or the frivolous and 
callous, who pique themselves too much on 
their worldly knowledge and wisdom, to believe 
that they can be overmatched. Miss Vernon 
was of the latter class, and fell a victim to her 
heartlessness. The elopement was judiciously 
planned, and as judiciously executed. 
On returning from the last ball of the season, 
having previously arranged with her femme de 
chambre, she found her moveables packed up 
for flight. When the porter slept, she, with 
noiseless tread, descended from her chamber, 
and, aided by Mademoiselle La Ruse, con- 
veyed the few articles she thought necessary 
to the hall-door, whence Lord Delmore and his 
valet de chamhre assisted in removing them 
to the travelling carriage in waiting; which 
soon whirled the artificial lovers on the road 
to marriage, and  repentance.
## p. 110 (#120) ############################################
110 THE REPEALERS. 
The first expression of Miss Vernon was  
" Well, I've triumphed over my sister! how 
angry she will be !" And the apparent compla- 
cency vath which this supposition was dwelt on 
mortified the amour propre of the lover, who felt 
as angry as if he was indeed a lover, and as if 
the idea of outwitting the father, mother, sister, 
brother, nay, the young lady herself, had not 
been a principal motive in the aiFair. 
When we are conscious of the selfishness 
of our own motives, we feel the least dis- 
posed to pardon, and the most disposed to re- 
sent, the selfishness of others. As Lord Del- 
more looked on the soulless face of his future 
bride, and listened to the heartless reflections 
she uttered, he cursed the poverty that com- 
pelled him to the step he was taking ; and the 
indifference he had hitherto experienced towards 
her, was turned to loathing. 
Even she was struck with the increasing

THE REPEALERS. Ill 
coldness of his manner, and tried to awaken 
interest by affected agitation and timidity. But 
it was all too late ! his vanity, the only sensitive 
point in his character, was wounded ; and as it 
was now impossible for her to retract, he was 
careless of other consequences. A runaway 
daughter could only present herself as a wife 
before her angry parents; and, therefore, he 
little troubled himself to conciliate the affection 
of one who was too completely in his power to 
assert her own dignity or independence. 
Gretna Green, that blacksmith's shop where 
chains are forged that often gall for life, was 
at length reached by the worldly-minded pair ; 
and, the ceremony being performed, they set out 
on their return to England, as little like married 
lovers, as if the nuptial knot had been tied 
some fifty years before. A repentant letter, 
announcing the marriage, was dispatched to 
Mr. Vernon from the first English town on

11^ THE REPEALERS. 
their route, and they gradually pursued their 
journey towards London, as ennuyts as two 
people can be who have discovered when too 
late that they have been duped, and who 
despise the selfishness and heartlessness that 
have mutually deceived them, without reflect- 
ing that each was equally culpable. 
On their arrival at Thomas's Hotel, they ex- 
pected a letter of forgiveness, and recall to the 
paternal mansion in Carlton Gardens ; instead 
of this, they found a cold and austere epistle 
from Mr. Vernon, stating that, as his consent 
to their marriage had never been demanded, 
Lord and Lady Delmore could not feel sur- 
prised at his withholding the provision he had 
intended for his daughter, a provision that he 
had always meant should be conditional on the 
fortune of the husband, and on the settlement 
to be made on the wife. He added, that he 
had no objection to receive Lord and Lady Del-

THE REPEALERS. 113 
more as occasional guests at his house, but more 
than this concession they were not to expect. 
When Lord Delmore perused this letter, lie 
turned to his bride, and asked her if she had 
anticipated a severity so unnatural, and if she 
thought that firmness or obstinacy were equally 
as strong as the selfishness now apparent in her 
father. 
" I felt quite sure," replied the amiable Lady 
Delmore, " that papa would act as he has 
done. Avarice and ostentation are his ruling 
passions ; he wished myself and sister to wear 
coronets, but to buy them at the cheapest 
price. He would have parted with some thou- 
sands to accomplish this end ; but as I have 
effected it for myself without his assistance, he is 
too happy to save his money ; so that it is pro- 
bable we shall never see a guinea of his. Mais 
riimporte ; you have a sufficiently large fortune 
not to be gene by this, which had I not known,
## p. 114 (#124) ############################################
114 THE REPEALERS. 
I should not, knowing as I have always done 
the avarice of papa, have consented to the 
elopement."" 
Her words, and the cool, unconcerned air 
with which they were uttered, spoke daggers 
to Lord Delmore. A sentiment of hatred and 
contempt arose in his mind towards her, which 
triumphed over the restraint that politeness 
had hitherto imposed on him. 
'' What will your Ladyship think then,""* 
replied he, " when I tell you that I have been 
for a long time an embarrassed man? You 
may start, and look astonished," observing the 
half-incredulous, half-terrified air of his wife, 
" but it is nevertheless true ; and if your 
father does not assist us, utter ruin must be 
the consequence." 
" Then you did not, after all, marry me for 
myself,'^ exclaimed the angry and humiliated 
lady : " the expectation of a fortune was the

THE REPEALERS. 115 
inducement ? What a triumph to my sister to 
discover that I have wedded a ruined man !" 
Here a violent passion of tears and sobs in- 
terrupted her utterance. 
" You at least, Madam," said Lord Del- 
more, " ought not to reproach me with inte- 
rested motives, as it appears quite clear you 
would not have eloped with me had you known 
the real state of my affairs. Recrimination is 
useless; we have committed a betise, and all 
that now remains to us is to remedy it as well 
as we can. You must assail your father, and 
try to induce him to come down handsomely, 
for we have no other resource." 
'' If you knew my father as well as I do," 
answered the weeping Lady Delmore, *' you 
would be aware that all appeals to him will be 
unavailing. He is impracticable on money mat- 
ters ; and  oh !  oh !" (bursting into a fresh 
torrent of tears,) " I, who have been all my life

116 THE REPEALERS. 
accustomed to splendour, now find myself mar- 
ried to one wh only sought me for the wealth 
he believed me to possess." 
Disgusted with this unrestrained exhibition of 
her selfishness, and venting execrations on her 
and himself. Lord Delmore retired to his cham- 
ber, leaving his wife alone to weep mingled 
tears of mortified vanity and rage. 
She had never loved Lord Delmore, even 
when she believed him rich and great ; but 
now that she knew he was poor, she almost 
hated him. She looked on herself as a victim 
to his arts, though she had been quite as wilHng 
to be the deceiver as he was to deceive. But so 
it is ever : we condemn the faults by which we 
suffer, but rarely pass a just sentence on those 
we commit ourselves, or pity the consequences 
they entail. 
Lady Delmore passed a sleepless night, the 
first she had ever yet known. The more she
## p. 117 (#127) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 117 
reflected on her future prospects, the more 
gloomy did they appear. Accustomed from her 
infancy to consider money as the primum mobile 
of life, it had never for a moment entered her 
mind, that a possibility existed of her finding 
herself without it. She felt that the most 
attractive man, with the highest rank, could 
never have tempted her to marry, if she knew 
he were poor : and yet, with this worldly 
wisdom, to be united to a ruined man ; to 
have no means of indulging the extravagant 
tastes with which she had been brought up :  
there was misery in the thought ! Lady Del- 
more had consoled herself for the coldness of 
her husband on their route, by anticipating 
future splendour. Dreams of her house, equi- 
pages, plate, diamonds, and Opera-box, had 
beguiled the weary hours of the journey ; and 
the triumph with which she should exhibit them 
to the envious eyes of her sister, had added

118 THE REPEALERS. 
poignancy to the pleasure they aflPorded in 
contemplation. But all these gay visions faded 
away before the fearful reality of poverty that 
her alarmed fancy now conjured up ; and the 
supercilious smiles or mock pity of her sister 
were mingled in all the pictures her imagina- 
tion formed of the future. 
After much reflection she decided, that the 
wiser plan would be for them to conceal their 
embarrassments as long as they could, as Mr. 
Vernon would be more likely to make them 
some advance, the less he was aware of its ab- 
solute necessity. Pride and ostentation might 
induce him to present a portion to the rich 
Lord Delmore, that the needy son-in-law had 
no chance of receiving; for if there was one 
thing on earth that Mr. Vernon detested more 
and pitied less than another, it was poverty. 
He viewed it, not as a misfortune, but as a 
crime, and carefully avoided all contact with 
those he suspected of being stamped by it.
## p. 119 (#129) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 119 
" No ! no !'' said Lady Delmore to herself, 
" if he discovers our ruin, we have nothing to 
hope from him ; and my sister will aggravate 
our misfortunes. From my brother I must not 
expect sympathy : my mother is the only one 
in that gilded palace who will feel for me." 
This was the first moment for years that 
an affectionate sentiment towards her mother 
had entered the heart of Lady Delmore. Self- 
ish and worldly-minded herself, all her sym- 
pathies had been with her father ; but now 
that trouble had overtaken her, and poverty 
menaced her with its train of evils, she turned 
towards the gentle and generous being she had 
hitherto shghted and undervalued. 
Lady Delmore attired herself with care next 
day, and stepped into the well-appointed cha- 
riot, emblazoned with the coronet she had so 
long sighed for; and, as the two footmen in 
splendid liveries jumped up behind, and the 
coachman drove off from Thomas's Hotel to

120 THE REPEALERS. 
Carlton Gardens, she almost forgot her cares in 
the pleasure of exhibiting this tasteful equi- 
page and its aristocratic decorations to her 
sister. 
When the servants at her father"'s house an- 
nounced the Countess of Delmore, she assumed a 
dignified air, as she passed through the file of 
powdered menials, and was sho^vn into the 
library, where she found her father, brother, 
and sister. They received her civilly, but 
coldly : her father, after touching her cheek 
with his, addressed her as follows :  
" I do not reproach you. Lady Delmore, 
with the indecorous manner in which you have 
accomplished a marriage, that, if suitable in 
point of fortune, could have met with no ob- 
stacle from me, to render such a clandestine 
step necessary. I repeat, I do not reproach 
you, and for two reasons : the first, that it 
would be now useless; and the second, that

THE REPEALERS. 121 
its consequences can affect only yourself, and 
can be nothing to me.'** 
The new Countess drew up with a hauteur 
which led her father to believe that Lord Del- 
m ore's finances were in a more flourishing state 
than he had been led to imagine, from the 
result of the inquiries he had instituted ; and, 
as Mr. Vernon was one of those who believed, 
judging from his own feehngs, that hauteur 
was a certain sign of wealth, this belief in- 
duced him to show a little more cordiality to 
his daughter, which increased in proportion 
to her airs of affected dignity. Her brother 
and sister went through the same ceremony of 
kissing her cheek. The former carelessly de- 
manded where was Delmore, and she coldly 
replied, that Lord Delmore was gone to call 
on the Premier. 
Having asked for her mother, Miss Vernon 
conducted her to the boudoir, and during their

passage to it, made two or three spiteful ob- 
servations, which convinced her sister that she 
had lost none of her ill-nature. 
The reception from Mrs. Vernon was kind 
and affectionate : she embraced her daughter, 
who, as she felt herself pressed to the heart 
of her mother with a warmth so different from 
the reception she had experienced from the rest 
of the family, inwardly acknowledged, that 
goodness and virtue are the only props that 
fail not, even to the erring, when they seek 
them. 
" I am anxious to see your husband, my 
dear child," said Mrs. Vernon, " that we should 
no longer be strangers to each other. If, as 
I trust will be the case, he makes you happy, I 
shall love him as a son.'* 
The new-made wife sighed, as she felt how 
little was her chance of happiness; but she 
tried to look cheerful.

THE REPEALERS. 123 
Determined to mortify her sister for the 
malicious sneers she had detected on her coun- 
tenance. Lady Delmore remarked, that now 
she was a married woman, she would chaperone 
her when she liked ; adding, that Lord Del- 
more's high and extensive connexions would, 
of course, widely extend the circle of her ac- 
quaintance. With true parvenu bad taste, she 
dwelt on the different Dukes, Duchesses, Mar- 
quises, and Marchionesses, who were the near ^ 
relations of her lord, and with whom she should 
henceforth live ; while her sister sat listen- 
ing, ready to burst with envy and jealousy, 
the effusions of which she could scarcely 
suppress. 
When Lady Delmore arose to depart, she 
asked Miss Vernon if she was disposed for 
a drive, and the latter having consented, with- 
drew to prepare for it. Mrs. Vernon beckoned 
her daughter to her chair, and taking her hand

with affection, addressed her in the following 
terms :  
" I have learned from authority I cannot 
doubt, my dear child, that Lord Delmore's 
affairs are in a most embarrassed state. This 
gives me great pain, because your father is not 
likely to behave as generously as circumstances 
may demand. I have concealed this informa- 
tion from the family, trusting that he may be 
induced to give you a portion, before he knows 
how much it may be required ; for, alas ! his 
liberality is more likely to be displayed before 
than after such a knowledge. You may be 
well assured how much gratification it would 
afford me to urge your interests with him ; but 
you know how little influence I possess. Ac- 
cept this gift, which may be useful," (putting 
a little note-case into her daughter's hand,) 
" and recollect, that though my means are not 
equal to my wishes of assisting you, I have

THE REPEALERS. 125 
always the power, as far as a few hundreds may 
be of use." 
The stubborn heart of Lady Delmore was 
moved by the affectionate consideration and 
soothing manner of her mother ; and when she 
embraced her, a tear  the first one of filial 
affection she had ever shed  was transferred 
to the cheek of her mother, who hailed it as 
a symptom of natural feeling, that promised 
future good. 
" Have you heard of the approaching mar- 
riages of your cousins," asked Mrs. Vernon, 
'' to the Marquis of Tadcaster and Lord Durn- 
ford ? All is arranged. Your aunt Vernon 
is more bustling and important than ever, and 
seems highly elated at the prospect of her 
daughter's being a Marchioness : but your 
cousin is the same sweet, frank, unaffected crea- 
ture as ever. My sister, though with every 
reason to be satisfied with the prospects of her

126 THE REPEALERS. 
daughter, feels the approaching separation from 
her most deeply, and is only consoled by Lord 
Durnford's promise of spending a certain por- 
tion of the year with them in the country." 
Miss Vernon having entered prepared for 
their drive, Lady Delmore took leave of her 
mother, and affecting an air of protection to- 
wards her sister, they entered the carriage. 
Not a syllable of approbation of the elegant 
equipage passed the lips of Miss Vernon, which 
encreased the spleen of her sister, who revenged 
herself by saying, " So, mamma tells me, that 
Eliza Burrell is to be married immediately 
to Lord Durnford. It 's a famous match for 
her; for he is rich, good-looking, and of an 
ancient family. I saw from the first moment 
that he was desperately in love with her. Your 
meeting with them, I^ouisa, will be very awk- 
ward at first." 
" Not more so than your's with Lord Tad- 
caster,'* spitefully answered Miss Vernon.
## p. 127 (#137) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 121 
" Oh, c'est toute une autre affaire,'''' said 
Lady Delmore ; "for as I am married, and 
married first, there can be no awkwardness, at 
least on my side, though he may be suspected 
of being delaisse,'''' 
" I can assure you,'' said Miss Vernon, " it 
is universally well known, that he never had 
the least intention of proposing to you, and it is 
as universally suspected, that you eloped with 
Lord Delmore in anticipation of Tadcaster's 
marriage." 
Lady Delmore felt the blood rush to her 
cheeks, and anger rise in her breast, at this 
speech of her sister's, which she had drawn on 
herself by the wish of piquing that sister, and 
was as deeply offended as if the ill-natured 
observation was wholly unprovoked. 
" Those who communicated such impertinent 
remarks to a sister,"" replied she, " must have 
had a poor opinion of her sisterly feelings." 
Miss Vernon, not knowing what to reply to

128 THE REPEALERS. 
this severe reproof, affected to be occupied in 
looking at the visiting-Hst in her hand. 
Determined to exhibit her coroneted carriage, 
Lady Delmore ordered her servants to drive 
up St. James's-street, and arrived opposite to 
the formidable battery of eyeglasses levelled 
from ' White's' and ' Crockford's"* just as Lord 
Delmore was descending the steps of the for- 
mer. She drew the check-string, and the 
coachman pulled-up nearly at the door of 
" White's.""* A sentiment of bienseance and 
conveyance in the mind of her husband dis- 
gusted him with the want of delicacy, of her 
thus exhibiting herself in public so recently 
after her marriage, the clandestine manner 
of which had excited such an esclandre; and 
stopping in full view of the formidable bay, 
or rather let us call it beau-Wmdovf , "' the cyno- 
sure of curious eyes," where pretensions and 
reputations are tried by the fiery ordeal of

high-seasoned anecdotes, racy bons mots, and 
piquant descriptions, the agreeable results of 
the leisure hours of its aristocratic frequenters. 
He anticipated all that would be thought and 
said of the unblushing bride ; and anger at the 
ridicule it would subject him to, was added to 
the other unloving feelings she excited within 
his breast. 
Miss Vernon being seated at the far-ofF side, 
and Lady Delmore stooping forward, he did 
not observe the former until he had uttered  
" What the devil, Lady Delmore, can make 
you exhibit yourself, like a Lady Mayoress, so 
publicly, and, above all, stop to place yourself 
under the fire of ' Whitens' and ' Crock ford's ?'' 
Remember you are still a bride.*" 
At this moment Miss Vernon advanced her 
head and the tip of her finger towards Lord 
Delmore, who coloured on perceiving that she 
had been a Hstener to his unlover-like address

to his wife ; and the polite inquiries he made 
after her health and that of Mrs. Vernon offer- 
ed a curious contrast to the unceremonious and 
sarcastic speech to Lady Delmore. 
While she was replying to it, two vulgar- 
looking men approached, and, rudely pushing 
by Lord Delmore, requested the ladies to leave 
the carriage, as they had seized it under exe- 
cution. 
" What does all this mean ?" gasped Lady 
Delmore to her husband, whose cheeks became 
nearly purpled with the mingled feelings of 
rage and shame. 
" Leave the carriage," said he with angry 
impatience, irritated almost to madness by the 
consciousness that many eyes were fixed on 
them. 
During this disgraceful exhibition, Lady 
Delmore descended in fear and trembling, over- 
powered by shame and mortification, as she

observed the crowd of idle gazers assembling 
round them ; but Miss Vernon declared, she 
would not, could not leave the carriage, as she 
was unprepared for walking. 
Lord Delmore could have annihilated her, 
for the delay this caused ; the crowd was every 
moment increasing ; vulgar jokes were passing 
all around them, and yet she still persevered 
in her determination of not leaving the carriage. 
" I am Miss Vernon, the daughter of Mr. 
Vernon  the rich Mr. Vernon  of Carlton 
Gardens ; drive me to my father's door, and 
I will give you five pounds, and 3^ou may then 
do what you like with the carriage.'" 
" If she be Miss Vernon, how comes she 
in this here carriage .?" said one of the by- 
standers : " Mr. Vernon, I warrant, has more 
crowns in his purse than on his carriage, and 
would never go for to let anything belonging to 
him be seized for debt."

' Will you, or will you not, leave the car-

Delmore. 
'' No, certainly not," replied the 3'oung lad\', 
'it would be too shocking to walk in St. James"'s- 
street, and papa would never forgive it." 
Lord Delmore seized the arm of his trem- 
bling wife, and hurried her awav from the 
spot, followed by a few of the rabble, who pur- 
sued them to the door of Thomas's Hotel. 
Lady Delmore, on entering her room, sank into 
a chair in violent hvsterics. and her unfeelino- 
husband, having rung for her maid, left her,

that five pounds divided between them, was not 
to be rejected; and, having jumped up behind 
the carriage, dispossessing the powdered and 
laced footmen of their places, they drove oflf* 
to Carlton Gardens, followed by the shouts and 
laughter of the crowd, who passed a thousand 
bitter jests on the footmen, who, humiliated and 
angry, pursued the carriage on foot. 
Mr. Vernon was descending from his car- 
riage, when the equipage, which had flattered 
liis vanity two hours before, arrived at his 
door, and the motley effect of two ill-dressed 
men, instead of the spruce footmen, astounded 
him . Though the coachman had driven quickly 
to escape from the mob, many of them now 
entered the aristocratical precincts of Carlton 
Gardens, shouting in triumph at having over- 
taken the carriage. 
Her father'^s servants assisted Miss Vernon 
to alight, and the bailiffs, impressed with re-

would not forget them there five pounds she

that, there were fifty executions out against 
his property ; so Miss might see, that if they 
had not nabbed the coach, somebody else 
would ; and so Miss might see as how the law 
must take its course." 
Miss Vernon passed up the steps through 
the crowd, and the hall-door being closed, the 
bailiffs departed with the carriage, and Mr. 
Vernon demanded of his daughter the solution

of the mystery, bow she came to be alone in 
the carriage, and where her sister was ? With 
as httle feehng of dehcacy, as of pity for that 
sister, the young lady explained the whole 
transaction, and each word produced increased 
anger on the part of the proud and selfish 
father. 
" And all this happened in front of White's?'' 
said he ; " and you refused to leave the car- 
riage, by which you prolonged the expose, and 
directed the attention of a vulgar mob to my 
house, so that my name will be mixed up in 
this disgraceful business ! Whereas, had you 
left the carriage, and accompanied your sister 
on foot, my name would never have been 
brought forward. You have shown as little 
feeling as common sense in this business, and 
have proved that you are totally incapable of 
acting for yourself without compromising your 
family."

THE REPEALERS. 137 
So saying, the angry father left the room, 
and sought his wife, to give her the painful 
intelligence, which exceeded even her worst 
fears of the state of Lord Delmore's affairs. 
" Here is a pretty affair, Mrs. Vernon," said 
he; "one of your daughters has married a 
ruined, beggarly Lord  is turned with igno- 
miny from his carriage, in the most public 
street in London ; and the other is such an 
idiot, that instead of going with her sister, she 
persists in remaining in the carriage, and re- 
turns to my door, followed by a mob, and 
escorted by bailiffs. This all comes of your 
false indulgence to them, which I always 
guessed would produce the worst conse- 
quences." 
Mrs. Vernon listened to him in silence, for 
she was well aware how useless any observa- 
tion of her''s would be, and she hoped, that 
if^ he exhausted his anger on her, he would

return to kinder feelings towards his unfortu- 
nate daughter. Lady Delmore. At length she 
ventured to insinuate the necessity of taking 
some step to assist to extricate Lord Delmore 
from his difficulties, but was stopped by the 
increased anger of her husband. 
" What !"" said he, " are you so weak and 
absurd as to believe that I will advance a 
guinea to a spendthrift, who has swindled my 
foolish daughter into a marriage ? No ! let 
them starve if they will ; I have done with 
them both. Never name the subject to me 
again :'' and so saying, he withdrew. 
Mrs. Vernon sent for Louisa to inquire the 
particulars ; and she related them without 
sparing a single painful circumstance, from the 
unfeeling address of Lord Delmore to her sis- 
ter, up to the moment that he, as she said? 
pulled her out of the carriage ; and the ma- 
lignant emphasis with which she related the

THE REPEALERS. 139 
whole, shocked the feelings of her mother. 
Mrs. Vernon ordered the carriage, that she 
might go and comfort her daughter; and, ere 
she had time to ask Louisa to accompany her, 
that young lady excused herself, on the plea 
of having some music to practise  an excuse 
that was revolting to the affectionate heart of 
Mrs. Vernon. 
On arriving at Thomas's Hotel, she found 
Lady Delmore, with pale cheeks and swollen 
eyes, extended on the sofa. Her tears flowed 
afresh when her mother embraced her, and she 
wept on her bosom with uncontrollable anguish, 
while the pitying mother used every endeavour 
to console her. Having succeeded in restoring 
her to something like calm, Mrs. Vernon in- 
quired for Lord Delmore, and was shocked 
at discovering that he had left her daughter 
while she was in hysterics, and had not since 
returned to the room. This unfeeling conduct

140 THE REPEALERS. 
disgusted her, and she rang the bell to request 
he might be searched for in his room, when the 
waiter, with a look of astonishment, declared, 
that Lord Delmore had set out for Dover 
twenty minutes before, leaving a letter, which 
was now produced, for Lady Delmore, but 
which, hearing that her Ladyship was ill, he 
had not delivered. 
The waiter having withdrawn, Mrs. Vernon 
tried to compose her daughter's agitated feel- 
ings, who, breaking open the seal, read the few 
lines the letter contained, when it fell from her 
trembling hand, and, turning deadly pale, she 
pointed to it, saying, " Read that, mother, for 
you can pity me, little as I deserve it.'"* 
The heartless writer avowed, that he was 
about to desert for ever a wife whom he had 
only wedded for the sake of the portion he sup- 
posed ber to have. He told her she must 
blame her low-born parvenu father for the

separation, as, had he given them a suitable 
provision, he (Lord Delmore) would not have 
left England. He added, that on handing her 
from the carriage, a note-case had dropped from 
her hand, of which he had possessed himself, 
and, discovering that it contained Bank-notes 
to the amount of five hundred pounds, he had 
appropriated them to his use, being the only 
price he was ever likely to receive for the coro- 
net with which he had encircled her brows. 
" After the exhibition of the morning,'' he con- 
tinued, " it would be impossible for him to 
appear in London ; and he concluded she would 
of course return to her father, who must con- 
sole her and himself with the ancient name 
engrafted on the parent stock, and support 
her, as it was impossible for him to make her 
any allowance."

CHAPTER X. 
'' The gods in bounty work up storms about us, 
That give mankind occasion to exert 
Their hidden strength, and throw out into practice 
Virtues that shun the day, and lie conceal'd 
In the smooth seasons and the calms of life." 
" I will bear it 
With all the tender sufF'rance of a friend, 
As calmly as the wounded patient bears 
The artist's hand that ministers his cure." 
Mrs. Vernon felt her tenderness for her 
unfortunate daughter redoubled by the pity 
with which she now regarded her ; and Lady 
Delmore, for the first time, became sensible
## p. 143 (#153) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 145 
of her past selfishness and folly, and grateful 
for the sympathy and affection of her mother. 
The unfeeling conduct and despicable mean- 
ness of her husband filled her with shame and 
contempt, and she avowed that she merited 
all that had befallen her for having eloped 
with him. 
Mrs. Vernon, though fearful of the reception 
Lady Delmore might meet with from her fa- 
ther, still thought it absolutely necessary that, 
deserted as she was by her husband, she should 
return to the paternal roof, and having given 
orders to the femme-de-chambre to remove her 
mistress's things from the hotel to Carlton Gar- 
dens, she took her daughter home with her 
in the carriage. 
" If your father does not behave as kindly 
as we could wish," said the good mother, '* my 
excellent sister will receive you as if you were 
her own child ; and I can supply you with all
## p. 144 (#154) ############################################
144 THE REPEALERS. 
the pecuniary assistance you require until your 
father relents, and makes, as I am sure he 
eventually will, a suitable provision for you. 
So pray be comforted, my dear child, and bear 
this trial with patience." 
The reception of Lady Delmore by her father 
was, as Mrs. Vernon had predicted, harsh and 
unkind, and her sister showed nearly as little 
good feeling. Mr. Vernon's ambition and ava- 
rice had deadened all natural affection in his 
breast ; he looked on his children as so many 
available means of extending his grandeur by 
their intermarrying with noble and rich part- 
ners ; but the moment this expectation was frus- 
trated, his dislike became much more marked 
than his affection had ever been for the child 
that had so disappointed him. 
The kindness and sympathy of her mother 
was Lady Delmore**s only source of consolation 
under all the mortifications to which she was
## p. 145 (#155) ############################################
THE REPEALERS, 145 
continually subjected ; but that kindness had 
operated a total change in her character. She 
learned to reflect on her own errors, and to 
deplore them, to conquer the egotism that had 
hitherto governed her ; and almost disarmed the 
malignity of her sister by the patience with 
which she now supported its symptoms, instead 
of, as in former days, resenting, or provoking 
fresh attacks. 
Happy are they whom misfortune awakens 
to a sense of their errors ! Even the best must 
own that patience and resignation are the pil- 
lars of human peace on earth ; for  
" How poor are they that have not patience ! 
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?" 
Patience is thrice blessed, giving and receiving 
good ; it disarms anger, or enables us to sup- 
port its stings and arrows, and we feel after 
each trial, through which it has supported us,

an internal satisfaction that carries balm to the 
heart. 
Mrs. Vernon rejoiced in the change in her 
daughter's character, but deplored the unfortu- 
nate marriage that led to it ; yet, can anything 
be deemed unfortunate that leads to such re- 
sults ?  and Lady Delmore often told her mo- 
ther, that perhaps without the rude trial that 
opened her eyes to her own defects, she might 
have continued as selfish and frivolous as be- 
fore. When Mr. Vernon and her sister pointed 
out to her the satirical notices in the newspapers 
of the arrest of the carriage in St. James's- street, 
and the flight of Lord Delmore for the Con- 
tinent, commenting on them with severity, and 
blaming her as the cause of all, she meekly 
acknowledged that she was, and added with 
humility that she should never cease to remember 
her error with sorrow. Even the obtuse father 
refrained from reproaching her, and by degrees

THE REPEALERS. 147 
began to treat her with something as like kind- 
ness as his harsh nature was capable of; and 
her sister forbore taunting her when she found 
her taunts unanswered. 
It was not without violent and unceasing 
efforts over her naturally irritable temper that 
Lady Delmore had achieved this conquest of it. 
Religion was called in to her aid ; and when 
was religion ever invoked in vain, if sought with 
humility of heart ? 
" True religion 
Is always mild, propitious, and humble ; 
Plays not tlie tyrant, plants no faith in blood, 
Nor bears destruction on her chariot-wheels. 
But stoops to polish, succour, and redress." 
Lady Delmore made it the guide of her actions 
and the regulator of her thoughts; it led her to 
judge others with indulgence, and herself only 
with severity. 
Mrs. Vernon now found that she had re- 
h2

covered a daughter when she had least expected 
such a blessing, and by means the least likely, 
according to human experience, to accomplish 
such a change  the marriage of that daughter 
with a dissolute man of fashion. The ways 
of Providence are inscrutable, and out of evil 
is good often produced. 
The day that Mrs. Henry Vernon came to 
invite her broth er-in-law''s family to be pre- 
sent at the nuptials of her daughter, an invita- 
tion which she determined on giving in person, 
that she might enjoy the malicious pleasure of 
seeing their mortification, was indeed a trying 
day to Mr. and Miss Vernon, who were as jea- 
lous, and envious in heart, as even Mrs. Henry 
Vernon could desire. She apologized for not 
having come more frequently to see them lately, 
particularly knowing the annoyance they must 
all have had in the very unfortunate marriage of 
their elder daughter  hoped Louisa would be

THE REPEALERS. 149 
more fortunate. Apropos to Louisa : the jewels 
Ordered for their cousin, Miss Burrell, were 
only inferior in splendour to those presented 
to her daughter, by the Marquis of Tadcaster. 
Louisa became pale with rage at this mal- 
apropos drawing in of the marriage of Miss Bur- 
rell, as apropos to her. She felt all the malice 
of it, and her aunt rejoiced that she did so. " I 
have been so occupied,*" said the spiteful Mrs. 
Henry Vernon, " in receiving and returning the 
visits of all the Marquis's family, that I have 
not had a moment to myself. To be sure, they 
are delightful people, though perhaps I am 
partial in my judgment of them, as .\iey are so 
kind and attentive to me, that I should be 
ungrateful if I did not highly esteem them. 
The Duchess of Montressor is to present my 
daughter, the future Marchioness of Tadcaster, 
at Court, and it is expected that her diamonds 
will be the finest of the season."" The parvenu

lady, talking of diamonds as she would of green 
peas ! " The family jewels of the Marquis are 
esteemed among the finest in England, and he 
has made considerable additions to them lately. 
My daughter wished to prevent his doing so, 
but he was obstinate ; and a young man of sixty 
thousand a year, and in love for the first time, 
may be allowed to be a little extravagant on 
such an occasion. Certainly my daughter has 
reason to be flattered by his preference, when 
one thinks of all the young ladies that were 
trying to attract him," (fixing her eyes on Lady 
Delmore's face, who felt herself blush, not 
with anger, but shame, as she remembered her 
efforts to entrap him.) *' But," continued the 
loquacious lady, " he declares he never felt 
the slightest preference before ; indeed, the 
Duchess of Montressor tells me the same. Mr. 
Henry Vernon wished to make a splendid 
present to our daughter, a present worthy a

THE REPEALERS. 151 
Marchioness, and probably a future Duchess ; 
but as among the Marquis's family jewels, 
there are suits of rubies, emeralds, sapphires, 
pearls, onyxes, opals, and turquoises, we hardly 
knew what to do ; so I luckily thought of 
having a Marchioness's coronet in diamonds, 
which we have ordered, and a river of dia- 
monds for her neck. Part of the trousseau 
is coming from Paris, and the rest is from 
Howell and James's, in Regent Street. The 
pocket-handkerchiefs cost ten guineas each ; 
the coronets are embroidered in dead gold, and 
have a beautiful effect; indeed, I like a Mar- 
quis's coronet so much, that I shall be almost 
sorry when my daughter changes it for a ducal, 
though ' Your Grace' does sound very well." 
Mrs. Henry Vernon scarcely allowed time for 
a word from any of the family, and w^as elated 
at observing the depression of their looks ; 
" Would you believe it," said she, turning to

152 THE REPEALERS. 
her sister-in-law, " Mr. Henry Vernon, instead 
of rejoicing in our daughter's making such a 
splendid marriage, is quite in low spirits at 
the idea of her leaving us. I tell him that this 
is much too absurd, for surely no one wishes to 
have his daughters left season after season on 
his hands," (giving a spiteful look around her.) 
"But what is more extraordinary is, that my 
daughter, though very much attached to the 
Marquis, bursts into tears every time that 
her separation from us is referred to : this 
comes from the folly of Mr. Henry Vernon, 
who has always accustomed himself and her to 
be in a great degree dependent on each other 
for happiness, just as if they could be always 
together, and now they can't bear parting." 
Having exhausted all the bavardage, with 
which she came freighted, she prepared to de- 
part, and once more inviting them to the nup- 
tials, she added, " But if it would be too pain-

THE REPEALERS. 153 
ful to Lady Delmore's feelings to witness a 
marriage, so soon after her own unfortunate 
one, I will not press her to come ; though, 
to be sure, a marriage by special licence, the 
ceremony performed by an archbishop, and in 
a splendid drawing-room, could not be like a 
Gretna Green wedding." And so saying, she 
hurried away, declaring she had a thousand 
things to do, but paused at the door of the 
boudoir, to tell Miss Vernon that she need not 
be afraid of meeting Lord Durnford at the mar- 
riage, as, out of delicacy to her feelings, they 
had not asked him ; and like a Parthian she 
fled, throwing her arrow behind. 
The rage of Mr. and Miss Vernon broke 
forth the moment that she who had excited 
it was out of hearing, and there was no 
term of reproach that they did not bestow on 
her. They forgot all the provocations they 
had given the narrow-minded and spiteful

woman ; but Mrs. Vernon and Lady Delmore, 
who remembered them, were less surprised, 
though equally pained by her obtuse indelicacy. 
Mr. Vernon declared his decided resolution of 
not attending the marriage himself, or allowing 
any of his family to go : a resolution which he 
adhered to, and which gave his unamiable 
sister-in-law the opportunity of telling her 
confidential friends, that the jealousy and envy 
of the Carlton Garden family were so great, 
that they could not support being present at 
the ceremony. The satisfaction of propa- 
gating this belief, amply consoled her for their 
absence from the nuptials.

CHAPTER XI. 
" Dublin, I love thee, though with spires ill crovvn'd, 
But hate thy joy-bells' melancholy sound, 
And loathe the ill-dressed, idle, brazen crew, 
That prowling through thy unswept streets I view, 
Ripe for rebellion, spurning order  law ; 
The maddest, wittiest wights the world e'er saw." 
From Howth to Dublin the route excited 
the admiration of Lord and Lady Oriel. Fine 
points of view presented themselves at every 
fresh turn ; and the sea spreading out as a vast 
mirror to reflect the beautiful coast, added to 
the charms of the scene, which was sadly con- 
trasted by the uncountable shoals of beggars

156 THE REPEALERS. 
that assailed the carriages at every side, cla- 
morous and persevering beyond all that they 
had yet experienced. The}^ were struck with 
the beauty of the streets ; but were not pleased 
with the pedestrians that filled them, a race 
new to English eyes, appertaining neither to 
the upper nor lower class, and affecting a 
swagger and air of idle impudence, that de- 
noted they belonged not to the middling class, 
which is in general the most truly respectable 
in all nations. 
"What are those people?" asked Lord 
Oriel of Mr. Desmond. " Are they professional 
men ?  though no ; their appearance indicates 
that they are not." 
" A dozen duels would be the inevitable 
consequence of your question," replied Mr. 
Desmond, " if any of the worthy individuals 
who have excited it, heard you. They call 
themselves Irish gentlemen, have a noble con-

tempt for business, and for the drudgery it en- 
tails, and occupy their leisure-hours in attending 
political meetings, each individual being per- 
suaded that, under the auspices of the Agitator, 
he may aspire to representing some county 
in Ireland in a British Parliament ; ' as sure 
his cousin Jack, or his friend Bill, has got 
into the House of Commons, and why should 
not he ?' Those who formerly bounded their 
ambition to some of the liberal professions, 
the church, the law, physic, or commerce, 
now despise such avocations ; and to be an 
M. P. seems to them a distinction too easily 
attained, not to be sought ; this has therefore 
become the end and aim of all their pursuits. 
They look on the Agitator as the Corypheus 
who is to lead them to glory, and are too short- 
sighted to see that he is destroying the country 
he affects to protect. Poor Ireland is indeed 
fallen ; and the specimens she sends over to

158 THE REPEALERS. 
England to sow the seeds of dissension in the 
ParUament, and to reap the harvest in the 
fields, prove alike her degradation. When I 
last visited the House of Commons," continued 
Mr. Desmond, " I could not name half-a-dozen 
of the new Irish members. I looked in vain for 
influential men of property or station, men 
whose grandfathers or fathers were known to 
me, or whose names at least were familiar to 
my ear ; but I could see only O'Blarney and 
his proteges, ready to vociferate against Eng- 
land, and endeavouring to arouse the turbu- 
lent to assist them by appeals to their pas- 
sions." 
The party found apartments ready for them 
at Morison's Hotel, and were gratified by the 
cleanliness and comfort of the house, and the 
attention of the master and his assistants. 
Having left their names at the Castle, an in- 
vitation to dinner was sent them for the next

THE REPEALERS. 159 
day, and a select party of the elite of the 
Dublin fashionables were assembled to meet 
them. 
The Marquis of Mona, undismayed by all 
the misrepresentations so industriously circu- 
lated to decrease his popularity in Ireland, 
continued to discharge his duty there with a 
courage and calmness as remarkable as that 
he evinced when, after the memorable and 
glorious battle of Waterloo, he submitted to 
the operation of amputation without wincing, 
showing that he was no less distinojuished for 
mental than for bodily courage. Lord Oriel 
observed to Mr. Desmond, that with all his 
preconceived opinion of the high courage and 
generosity of the Irish character, he thought 
it would have been impossible for the Go- 
vernment to have chosen a nobleman more cal- 
culated to suit them than the Marquis of Mona. 
The most agreeable part of the Dublin so-
## p. 160 (#170) ############################################
160 THE REPEALERS. 
ciety is that to which strangers, making a short 
stay, have the least chance of being admitted. 
It consists of the gentlemen of the Irish bar, 
who are as remarkable for their wit and other 
agreeable qualities as for their hospitality ; and 
the few families to whom Mr. and Mrs. Desmond 
presented Lord and Lady Oriel, gave them 
a most favourable impression of that circle. 
They found Lord and Lady Abberville con- 
stant visitors at the Cr.stle and the Phoenix 
Park ; the noble lord intruding his opinions 
on the Vice-^roy and Secretary, unmindful of 
the little attention they received, and my 
lady trying to make herself useful to the Mar- 
chioness of Mona, whose dignified mind shrank 
from the intriguante with instinctive dread, and 
whose ears were closed to the innuendoes, scan- 
dalous stories, and malicious tales, she sought 
to instil into them, against all whose recep- 
tion she wished to preclude.
## p. 161 (#171) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 161 
" And so, after all," said Lady Abberville to 
the Marchioness, " Lord and Lady Oriel are 
living together. Well, some men can bear any- 
thing, and he must be wilfully blind. She really 
must have good nerves to present herself so 
unblushingly, after her affair with Lord Del- 
more ; and the Desmonds and Forresters, for 
moral people, are very indulgent.'" 
Lady Mona changed the subject, with a 
coldness of manner that marked her disap- 
proval; and the wily Lady Abberville, who 
quickly saw she had done wrong in attacking 
Lady Oriel, dexterously shifted her ground, 
by observing, that she had been out of Eng- 
land all the time, and only heard of the affair 
through the papers, and from the letters of 
Lady Welborough and Lady Nottingham, who, 
she must say, were a little disposed to be 
spiteful on such occasions. For her part, she 
had always liked Lady Oriel, and thought her

162 THE REPEALERS. 
a very charming person, and therefore she 
should pay her all the attention in her power, 
especially as her dear Lady Mona was a friend 
of hers. 
The Desmonds and Colonel Forrester were 
astonished to see the courage with which Lady 
Abberville advanced and seized Lady Oriel's 
hand, and proclaimed her delight at seeing 
her in Ireland ; trusted she would spend some 
time with Lord Abberville and herself at their 
seat ; for though Lady Oriel would find no 
place in Ireland like Oriel Park, still if she 
could be content with more homely accommo- 
dation, they would make up in the heartiness 
of their welcome, for what they wanted in 
splendour. She said, she had felt delighted 
at the marriaoe of Colonel Forrester to their 
charming neighbour; it was so gratifying to 
have an English person settled at Spring- 
Mount ; one who would certainly do much

THE REPEALERS. 
good ; for poor Mr. Desmond, though the best 
man in the world, was a Httle obsolete in his 
notions, and could not enter into the true cha- 
racter of the Irish people. She had made the 
Lord Lieutenant au fait of the real state of 
the country, and he had profited very much 
by her suggestion ; but still he seemed strangely 
opposed to the building a barrack in their neigh- 
bourhood, the only plan that could tranquillize 
the country, and which she trusted Colonel 
Forrester would aid her in getting carried into 
effect. 
Lady Oriel was only relieved by the arrival 
of the gentlemen from the dining-room, when 
Lady Abberville left her to go and assail the 
Marquis of Mona, whose good-breeding was 
put to the test by the tiresome and persevering 
efforts of the manoeuvring lady, to carry her 
point of the barrack. There was not a country 
gentleman present of whom Lady Abberville

had not a request to make. Presentments to be 
passed, canals to be made, barracks to be built, 
and markets to be removed to some village 
of her Lord's, to force said village into a town 
these were the subjects of her conversation 
to each ; and they seemed to dread her ap- 
proach as something that would draw them into 
present ennui and future trouble. Her legs 
seemed to be as active as her tongue, for she 
was to be seen as well as heard in every corner 
of the room ; and it was not until the car- 
riages were announced, that she ceased to en- 
treat, suggest, or cajole, whichever best suited 
the person addressed, on every point on which 
she required assistance. 
Lady Oriel, who had only seen her in Eng- 
land as the creature of the patronesses of the 
exclusive clique^ was surprised to view her in 
her new character : but the motive of her 
actions in both were the same  self-interest.
## p. 165 (#175) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 165 
" If all Irish ladies were like Lady Abber- 
ville," said Lady Oriel to Mrs. Desmond, 
" how I should dread them ! There is no re- 
treating from her, and it is equally disagreeable 
to be treated by her as a friend or enemy."" 
" She is an odious person, I must admit," re- 
plied Mrs. Desmond,  " wwe V7'aie intriguante, 
deterred by no feelings of delicacy, and guided 
by no principle, save self-interest, in the pur- 
suit of her egotistical plans. I consider her 
vicinity to Spring-Mount its greatest draw- 
back ; but luckily, she only comes to Ireland 
when driven by necessity. Then while she is

over all the tittle-tattle of the clique she has left

of her friends. Lady Welborough and Lady

malice of the quoter, until they assume a mean-

whom they originated ever intended they should 
bear ; for nothing passes through the mind or 
lips of Lady Abberville, without being tainted 
by the mechancete of her nature. She does 
so much mischief, that I cannot speak of her 
with the forbearance I wish to use ; and she is 
the only person in female form that Mr. Des- 
mond has an antipathy to." 
The party were invited to Marino, the beau- 
tiful residence of Lord and Lady Castelmont, 
the former the worthy successor of his noble 
and excellent father, and the latter as peerless 
in reputation as in beauty, offering a bright 
model of perfection in female virtue and love- 
liness. They passed a most agreeable day at 
Marino, and allowed that all they had heard of 
the charms of Irish hospitality exceeded not 
the reality. 
Their next visit was to Kilruddery, the fine 
seat of Lord Leath, beautifully situated near

Bray, where the beauty of the park, the solid 
elegance and comfort of the house, and the 
amiabihty of the owners, called forth their 
warmest approbation, and realized all they 
had imagined of the bon-hommie, and ease of 
manner of the Irish nobility, who unite all 
the advantages to be derived from other 
countries to the cheerfulness and warmth of 
heart peculiar to their own. 
An invitation from the Duke and Duchess of 
Cartoun, to visit Cartoun, was too tempting to 
be resisted ; and they were delighted with the 
frank and cordial reception that welcomed them 
from the excellent and patriotic Duke and his 
truly amiable Duchess. 
" What a delightful place Ireland would be 
to reside in," said Lord Oriel, " if the country 
was only tranquil ! And surely, the presence 
of all the Irish nobility, if they resemble the 
three families we have visited, could not fail

to have the happiest effect on the habits and 
minds of the people. I must say, that I blame 
the absentees for much of the mischief that has 
occurred ; though you, who have had more 
power of judging, look as if you differed from 
me. 
" I,^' replied Mr. Desmond, " look on ab- 
senteeism as a consequence, and not as a cause, 
of the troubles that have been so long and 
so loudly attributed to it. I know districts 
where the landed proprietors have constantly 
resided on their estates, doing all the good 
in their power ; and yet no sooner did the Agi- 
tator wave his sceptre, and his satellites work 
on the minds of the ignorant peasantry, than 
they shook oft* their allegiance to their old and 
tried friends, forgetful of years of benefits re- 
ceived, and unmindful of all, save the excita- 
tion of the moment. One of the noblemen we 
have visited, who has been a constant resident

on his estate, and who might serve as a model 
for landlords and neighbours, has had the mor- 
tification of seeing his son (a most amiable and 
enlightened young man) defeated in an elec- 
tion for a place he had represented honourably 
and conscientiously, and where his constituents 
could have no doubt of the zeal and honesty 
with which he would advocate their interest. 
There must be a reciprocity of benefits between 
landlord and tenant, to make the tie that unites 
them advantageous and lasting ; and if a land- 
lord knows that, notwithstanding years of kind-* 
ness and forbearance on his part, and apparent 
content on that of his tenants, any popular 
excitement may turn them against him, he 
has but little encouragement to remain in a 
land where a sense of duty is the only incite- 
ment. Nothing can tend so much to injure 
a country as the dissemination of dissensions 
between landlord and tenant, artfully leading

both parties to suppose that their interests 
are separate; yet those who profess to be 
the friends of Ireland have invariably pur- 
sued this system, and its baleful effects are 
but too visible. You, my dear Lord Oriel, 
like all who judge of Ireland without a per- 
sonal knowledge of it, are disposed to think 
harshly of absentees; but few reflect on the 
misery of residing in a country where laws are 
trampled on, and murder and rapine stalk 
abroad in open day. An outcry is raised at 
every attempt that is made to coerce the law- 
less and turbulent, and to check them in their 
fearful career of crime. We hear that the 
liberty of the subject is violated  that a death- 
blow is aimed at the British Constitution ; but 
those who make this outcry forget, or at least, 
mention not, that not only the hberties, but the 
lives, of the respectable and peaceful subjects 
in Ireland are attacked every day, and that.

them the power of slaying, flogging, and burn-

tremble under the reign of terror establish- 
ed by the infuriated people, who, goaded 
on to madness by the inflammatory speeches 
and letters addressed to their passions, com- 
mit the most fearful crimes. For myself," 
continued Mr. Desmond, " though abhor- 
ring the crimes of these infatuated people, I 
cannot abhor themselves  ' I love the off*enders, 
but detest the offence f and all my anger is 
against those who excite them to such deeds. 
Patriotism, love of liberty, devotion to country 
sacred words, that ought never to be profaned, 
are the watchwords, the war-cry, to lead this 
unhappy people to murder, pillage, and de- 
struction ; and those who are compelled to vote 
for a political measure, which the exigence of 
the times demand, an exigence brought on by

evil counsels, are denounced, by those who have 
reduced Ireland to this fearful crisis, as her 
worst enemies and enslavers, and pointed out 
to the vengeance of the misled populace. No 
country can be a fit residence for independent 
and honourable men, where the worst of all 
tyranny is established  that of brutal force, and 
where those who most love and worship liberty 
are forced to support measures that seem to 
assail it, in order to arrest the crimes com- 
mitted in her name. The Bill about to be 
passed in Parliament, furnishes ample subject 
for the attacks and reproaches of the faction 
who have rendered it necessary ; but if it did 
not pass, what would be the fate of the re- 
spectable and well-disposed class of the people 
in Ireland ? The question is, are the well- 
conducted and orderly to be left to the tender 
mercies of the infuriated miscreants who have 
taken the law into their own hands, or are

measures, strong and illegal as they may be 
considered, to be taken to protect the good, 
and check the bad ? Look at the run made 
on the banks for gold ; you see how soon the 
hint given on this subject was taken, and the 
unthinking people reflect not on the inevitable 
consequences which must draw an accumulation 
of distress and misery on their heads by de- 
pressing the markets, and deteriorating the 
value of the produce they have to sell. Every 
reaction following events of this kind is 
fraught with misery, and the senseless people, 
instead of opening their eyes to the cause, look 
only at the effect, and blame Government for 
the inevitable consequences of their own folly. 
The Irish have been accustomed to look up to 
the English as lovers of liberty and protectors 
of the oppressed ; this opinion, and the respect 
it produced, it has been the study of the faction, 
who have convulsed Ireland for the last few

years, to destroy, and the reason is obvious. 
If the sober-minded and influential class in 
England have opposed themselves to this fac- 
tion, as it was clear from the beginning they 
would, it became necessary to depreciate them, 
and extirpate all sympathy between them 
and the Irish, to prevent the latter seeing 
the real state of public opinion in England, 
with respect to their self-constituted rulers. To 
explain to the ignorant multitude why the 
Enghsh rose not en masse to support the Irish 
demagogues, it was necessary to misrepresent 
the nation, and have it imagined that, as they 
would not countenance murder, rapine, and all 
the excesses of licence, they no longer wor- 
shipped liberty."

CHAPTER XII. 
" Erin, thy verdant sea-girt shore 
Was never meant for slaves to tread. 
Though dimm'd are now the days of yore 
When monarch s for thee fought and bled, 
When know^ledge open'd her fair page, 
And glory wide her flag unfurl'd, 
Thou wert the boast of a past age, 
The bright gem of the western world. 
But faded is thy glory now. 
Nought but thy courage rests with thee ; 
A reckless courage that, I trow, 
Has led thee on to misery !" 
While visiting the beautiful environs of 
Dublin, Lord and Iiady Oriel remarked to each 
other, that it was strange so fine a city and so 
beautiful a country drew so few travellers to 
visit them.
## p. 176 (#186) ############################################
1T6 THE REPEALERS. 
" We English are strange people," said Lord 
Oriel. We should think it a reproach not to 
have seen every city in France and Italy, and 
not to have made ourselves familiar with the 
fine scenery of other countries. But how few 
of us are acquainted with Ireland ! and had we 
not been tempted by the desire of visiting our 
friends, we most probably never should have 
seen the romantic and fine country now before 
us, which, we must admit, is more worthy of 
admiration than many of those places which 
the wealthy and the idle travel thousands of 
miles to admire. 1 think this indifference to the 
beauties of Ireland, on the part of England, 
has done much to keep us in ignorance of the 
real state of the country, and consequently to 
prevent our having reflected on the best means 
of ameliorating the grievances under which she 
has loncp crroaned." 
' I agree with you,"' said Mr. Desmond,

THE REPEALERS. 177 
" for 1 have often deplored the ignorance of 
the members in both houses of Parhament 
on the subject of Ireland,  an ignorance which 
makes them listen ^vith disbelief to many state- 
ments founded on fact, and with credulity to 
too many founded on falsehood. That Ireland 
has long suffered from misrule, one must be 
sceptical to deny; that she has many griev- 
ances to complain of, it would be more than 
folly to refuse to believe : but, instead of 
searching to discover the original malady, and 
to remove it, anodynes and palliatives have 
been applied, which have only yielded a tem- 
porary relief, and the disease has burst forth 
with renewed force from the slumber it had 
taken. Opium can still and blunt the sense 
of pain ; but it removes not the cause, and 
the remedies applied to Ireland have been 
opiates from which she has awakened with in- 
creased excitability, the sense of suffering ren-

dered more acute by the re-action arising from 
the temporary relief. It is not want of good-will, 
but want of knowledge, of which the persons 
who have treated the maladies of Ireland, are to 
be accused. They have not studied the idio- 
syncrasy of the country, which demands a 
knowledge and reflection that few of those 
who are capable, are disposed to give it. That 
Ireland has for centuries been mis-governed, 
no better proof can be given than the facility 
with which she yields to every ignorant and 
designing charlatan who wishes to try expe- 
riments on her : like the wretched invalid who is 
ready to submit to the remedies of every quack 
who prescribes for him. A sound constitution 
and healthy state would preclude such dan- 
gerous experiments ; and, instead of blaming 
the political charlatans who have practised 
on Ireland and fatted on her diseases, we 
should blame the supine negligence that has 
allowed the disease to make a progress so

THE REPEALERS. 179 
appalling, as to throw the country into such 
hands. Had Ireland been properly governed, 
there would be no agitators, for without 
grievances they could not exist ; but hitherto 
the original malady has been overlooked while 
finding remedies for the dangerous symptoms ; 
and even now, the bill that arrests the pro- 
gress of murder, does nothing towards re- 
moving the irritation that gave the agitators the 
power of increasing the crime. Such conduct 
is like that of allowing a brain-fever to pursue 
its ravages on a patient, while we are content 
with confining him in a straight waistcoat ; we 
may prevent the effects of his own madness from 
bringing destruction on others, but we do not 
prevent the disease from destroying himself. 
The bill must therefore, be followed by mea- 
sures of wisdom and justice, and they can only 
be administered by a knowledge of the causes 
of the original evil. Ireland has had some of 
the most able and willing statesmen that Eng-

land could boast, as her secretaries, who, had 
they arrived in Ireland with only half the 
knowledge and experience relative to it with 
which they left it, might have done much 
to relieve the burthen under which she has 
writhed so long ; but certain peculiarities, the 
result of her grievances, render it more diffi- 
cult to acquire a correct knowledge of the true 
state of the country than can be imagined by 
those who are accustomed to plain and open 
dealing. Misrepresentations, taking the hue 
of every political faction, come pouring in on 
the Secretary on his arrival ; his ears, habituated 
to the matter-of-fact details of business of the 
veracity -loving English, are ill calculated to sift 
the grains of truth from the vast chaff of false- 
hood in which they are confounded ; and finding 
himself continually deceived, his credulity be- 
comes metamorphosed into its opposite extreme, 
and he who believed too much, learns to doubt 
too largely. Disgusted with the prevarications

and cunning he meets  which, by the by, are 
the invariable consequences of ill-treatment on 
weak and ignorant minds,  he learns but too 
often to despise those whom he had come to 
pity and to serve, and to consider their defects 
as the cause instead of the effect of their 
troubles." 
After a stay of ten days in Dublin, the 
party proceeded on their route to Spring- 
mount, and were much gratified by the beauty 
of the country through which they passed : hill 
and dale, and those beautiful mountains, clear 
streams, and rapid rivers, peculiar to Ireland, 
continuall}' called forth their admiration. The 
excellence of the provisions at the inns at 
which they stopped, surprised them ; and Lady 
Oriel declared that the butter was more de- 
licate and finely flavoured than any she had 
ever before eaten ; it looked and tasted as 
if the cows had fed only on buttercups and 
primroses. The slim-cake and hot griddle-

bread, luxuries to be had only in Ireland, 
met with great success ; and the newly laid 
eggs were pronounced to be so good, as to 
verify the Irishman's boast, that " sure it was 
only Irish hens that ever laid fresh eggs." 
The crimped salmon, with its white curdy 
veil, letting its rose-colour appear through, 
was allowed to be far superior to any English 
salmon they had ever tasted ; and the speckled 
trout, fresh from the water, was pronounced 
matchless. 
The air of cordial welcome with which the 
Desmond family were received at all the inns, 
might have led a satirical observer to recol- 
lect the lines ending with, " The warmest 
welcome always at an inn ;" but the present 
party attributed it, as in truth they ought, 
to the respect and regard entertained for 
them, and the " Och ! sure, 'tis we that are 
proud and contint, to see your honors back

warmth that carried conviction of its sincerity. 
On passing over a common. Lady Oriel was 
surprised and shocked at seeing a flock of non- 
descript birds, resembling geese, but without 
feathers, trembling beneath the chill breeze 
that was wafted from the mountains. Being 
in a light open carriage, she called out to the 
postilion, " Pray, what are those birds .?" 
" Sure, plaise your honour's ladyship, they 
are geese, and they play h  11 with 'em in 
this counthry, seeing as how they sell the 
clothes off their backs." 
There was no resisting this answer, and 
Lord and Lady Oriel laughed heartily at it, 
though the postilion added with a grave face, 
" Faith, it' s no laughing matther for the poor 
geese any way :"  a truth they were by no 
means disposed to doubt. 
Arrived at Capoquin, the beauty of the

scenery induced them to remain a day or two 
there, that they might explore it ; they had a 
boat to convey them over the limpid and 
rapid Black-water river, a misnomer, as the 
water is peculiarly clear, but which is said to 
have been so called from its banks having 
been once so thickly wooded that the dark 
trees threw a deep shadow over the river, 
nearly excluding the light  hence it was called 
black-water. 
They stopped to view Drumana, the ancient 
and beautiful seat of the noble family of Gran- 
dison, the last of whose earls resided there 
in a style of princely hospitality, and attracted 
many guests by private theatricals, to enact 
which he fitted up a very tasteful theatre. 
Our present King, then a midshipman, spent 
some days at Drumana, and entered into its 
gaieties with all the spirit and vivacity pecu- 
liar to his age and profession, leaving behind

him an impression that even still exists of the 
frankness, good humour, and condescension of 
Prince William Henry, as the old inhabitants 
still call his Majesty. Various anecdotes and 
bons-mots are repeated relative to this memo- 
rable visit, all highly flattering to the illus- 
trious visiter; and the persons who remember 
him, declare that they are quite sure that his 
Majesty, even though he is a king, does not 
forget the happy days he spent at Drumana, 
as a gay and frolic-loving reefer. 
" Och ! then, wasn't it a grand sight,"' said 
an old woman to the party, " to see a king's 
son, born and bred in palaces, sent to sea just 
like the child of any private gentleman, and 
treated no better, and just laughing and play- 
ing for all the world as if he had never 
seen any greater grandeur? Sure, we always 
thought that such great people never laughed 
or played themselves, but only kept others to

do it for 'em. But, faith. Prince William 
Henry showed us the contrary, for he was the 
first in every frolic, and long as it is since 
that happy time, I think even now I see him, 
with his rosy cheeks and laughing eyes, as 
gay as a summer's morning, with something 
kind to say to every person that came near 
him." 
" Ay, and something kind to do, too," inter- 
rupted the husband, " for I well remember he 
snatched a kiss from you, Peggy, which made 
me jealous enough at the time, though now I 
think it 's a great honour that my poor old 
woman should have been kissed by a king." 
" Don't be bragging, Davy," said the wife, 
" for sure the ladies can't believe that such a 
poor ould woman as I am, ever had so great an 
honour." 
" Ay, Peggy," said the husband, " sure the 
whole country round knows that you were the

prettiest girl in the barony, and what's more, 
the most modest and dacent; and there never 
was any grand company at the great house, but 
what the good Lord and Lady used to send for 
Peggy to show 'em an Irish beauty." 
" Well, Davy," said the old woman, " there's 
no remains of that now. It's only the heart 
that rests the same, and sure that 's for all 
the world Hke a large sound nut in a withered 
shell, where it hasn't room." 
" Never mind, my ould woman," said Davy, 
patting her on the shoulder with a look of in- 
effable affection ; " I wouldn't give the ould 
shell for the freshest and greenest husk that 
ever covered a filbert in the brown woods of 
Drumana." 
Nothing can be more picturesque or beautiful 
than Drumana. The house stands boldly on 
an eminence, commanding a view of the fine 
river that winds along its banks and almost

washes its base, and the woods around are 
crowned by mountains that give sublimity to 
the whole. Mr. Desmond had ordered a dinner 
peculiar to that part of the country, to be pre- 
pared in the grounds. It consisted of salmon 
caught for the occasion, and cut into large 
slices ; a fire of wood was kindled on a stone, 
and each piece of salmon on a long wooden 
skewer was stuck in the earth round the fire, 
and occasionally sprinkled with salt and water, 
and turned until roasted ; potatoes dressed a 
r Irlatidaise, and Black-water cyder, as sparkling 
as champaign, formed a repast that the English 
visiters declared to be one of the most delicious 
of which they had ever partaken ; and Peggy 
and her husband who superintended it, were 
delighted with the commendations it received. 
They returned to Capoquin to sleep in rooms 
breathing of lavender, it being the common 
custom in many parts of Ireland to keep quan-

tities of this fragrant flower dried in their 
presses and drawers: and the murmuring of 
the pellucid stream flowing under the windows 
of the inn soothed them into slumber. 
The next day they proceeded to Lismore, 
the whole route passing along the banks of 
the Black-water, and off'eriug the most richly 
wooded and romantic points of view. 
Perhaps there is nothing in Ireland more 
beautiful than the entrance to Lismore. The 
fine bridge, and picturesque castle above it, 
which overhangs the river at a height that 
makes the head grow dizzy to look down it ; 
the woods and mountains around, and the 
velvet lawns of the grounds of Mrs. Scott, 
off*er a picture rarely equalled, and never sur- 
passed. In this castle was born Robert Boyle, 
the celebrated philosopher, a circumstance that 
adds much to the interest with which it is 
viewed, and excites speculative surmises as to

190 THE REPEALERS. 
how far the sublime and beautiful scenery 
around might have influenced the turn of his 
mind, even at the early age at which he left 
Lismore, to pursue his studies at Eton. 
The union of such powerful genius and 
talent such strong rehgious principles, sim- 
ple habits, and affectionate disposition, had 
always endeared the memory of this celebrated 
man to the persons who were now viewing the 
place where he first saw the light, and there 
was almost a religious reverence in the feelings 
with which they examined the venerable ruin. 
The present owner of Lismore, the Duke of 
Devonshire, is deservedly popular there ; he 
has expended large sums in improvement, and 
resided some months on the spot, where his 
kindness and extensive charities have left a 
warm sentiment of gratitude and attachment. 
The party arrived at Springmount on a fine 
summer's evening, when the sky and earth

wore their brightest looks, and the Oriels were 
charmed with the romantic beauty of the spot. 
Springmount was a castellated mansion, stand- 
ing on a gentle eminence, commanding a fine 
view of the river and adjacent country, and 
nearl}' embosomed in woods, surrounded by 
high mountains, losing themselves in the clouds. 
The fine and picturesque mountains in Ireland 
never fail to attract the admiration of those 
accustomed to the tamer scenery of England, 
and add peculiar beauty to the landscapes. 
The apartments at Springmount were spa- 
cious, and fitted up with a due regard to 
comfort and elegance. Pictures, statues, and 
vases, collected during the travels of Mr. Des- 
mond, who was not only an amateur, but a 
connoisseur in the fine arts, ornamented the 
salons; and an extensive and well-chosen li- 
brary offered resources of no ordinary kind 
to studious visiters. The principal rooms

opened on a terrace of tesselated marble, whence 
flights of steps descended to the pleasure- 
grounds, through which the limpid and rapid 
river hurried along its impetuous course, never 
pausing to admire the beauties it reflected on 
its glassy surface. A stone bridge of one arch, 
finely proportioned, and ornamented with a 
light balustrade of marble, was thrown across 
the river, and a pleasure-boat was moored near 
a picturesque boat-house for the amusement 
of the guests. A sunk fence of wide dimen- 
sions divided the pleasure-grounds from the 
deer-park ; but in wandering through the mazes 
of the former, the beautiful animals that 
sported free as air were visible, and gave a 
wildness and animation to the scene. Thrushes 
and blackbirds innumerable enlivened the um- 
brageous shades, and sent forth their notes 
of joy ; and the lonely Philomel, at eve, was 
heard to warble her melancholy song, while

THE REPEALERS. 193 
the russet corn-creak, hopping like a partridge 
over the velvet lawns, repeated her clear, shrill 
cuckoo, which was echoed around till it died 
in distance. 
A repose reigned round Springmount that 
was delicious to those who had been shut up 
in the confined atmosphere of London. There 
is a peculiar lightness in the air in Ireland, 
whicli  whether it be attributable to the moun- 
tains, or to the Atlantic, we leave casuists to ex- 
amine  brings healing on its wings to the over- 
excited mind, as well as to the exhausted body ; 
and the visiters felt this benign influence, as 
with elastic spirits they arose, the morning after 
their arrival, to wander through the grounds, 
and admire the taste and judgment with which 
they were laid out. 
They entered the breakfast-room as the bell 
summoned them to that repast, and found a 
table plentifully piled with all the luxuries 
VOL. III. K

that Ireland can furnish. Honey, bright and 
sparkling as topaz, raspberry jam that might vie 
in tint with the ruby, fruit of every descrip- 
tion, and cream and butter such as Erin alone 
can produce, graced the board. 
After breakfast Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. For- 
rester proposed driving through the park, to 
show Lady Oriel the finest points of view ; and 
Mrs. Forrester requested that they might pass 
the gates and extend their drive to the cottage 
of Grace Cassidy. 
" You have shown us some good specimens 
of English peasantry," said Mrs. Forrester, 
" and I am impatient, dear Lady Oriel, to 
show you our choicest sample in Grace Cas- 
sidy." 
We pass over the drive through the really 
fine park, which had the usual quantity of

hill and dale, and lawns intersected with groups 
of trees, with the river winding through them, 
and glittering beneath the sunbeams, like a 
vast azure-coloured serpent, coiling itself along. 
Lady Oriel was delighted with the views and 
the country, and confessed that henceforth she 
should find all scenery tame that had not 
mountains to diversify them, so much did they 
add to the beauty of the landscape. 
Mrs. Forrester was gratified by the admi- 
ration her natal residence excited; and acknow- 
ledged that, much as she liked England, she 
always, while there, felt the want of her native 
mountains, and hailed them on her return as 
old and dear friends.

CHAPTER XIII. 
" Now let us thank th' eternal Power ; convinced 
That heaven but tries our virtue by affliction : 
That oft the cloud which wraps the present hour, 
Serves but to brighten all our future days." 
When the landau stopped at the little gate 
of the rustic paling that inclosed the garden of 
Grace Cassidy from the road, she arose from 
her spinning-wheel, and came forth to receive 
the ladies. She wore her dark hair combed 
back from her high and open forehead, leav- 
ing her long and jetty brows uncovered ; a 
small mob cap, neatly plaited, and white as

snow, gave an almost Quaker simplicity to the 
character of her head ; her kerchief crossed her 
fair bosom, and the ends were confined by an 
apron, that nearly covered the pale blue cali- 
manco quilted petticoat, and left her small 
ankles and well-formed feet exposed. Her gown 
was of flowered chintz, the sleeves coming only 
to the elbows, and was open in front, so as to 
leave the petti'Joat in sight, the waist long, and 
the skirt plaited with fulness. A small collar of 
narrow black velvet lent additional whiteness 
to her fair throat, and black mittens half con- 
cealed her roundly-turned arms. She wore blue 
stockings, and silver buckles in her shoes ; and 
from her waist hung a silver chain to which was 
attached her pincushion, scissors, and key. 
Such was the holiday suit of Grace, who, 
anticipating the probability of the ladies passing 
by her cottage, and stopping to speak to her, 
had dressed herself in her best clothes, to do

honour to their presence. The delicacy and 
grace of her slim figure, the piquancy and ani- 
mation of her countenance, joined to her pic- 
turesque attire, rendered her a most attractive- 
looking person ; and Lady Oriel accused Mrs. 
Forrester for not having prepared her to ex- 
pect so much beauty ; declaring in French, 
to spare Grace's modesty, that she had " never 
beheld so pretty a peasant." 
" Och ! my honoured mistress and my dear 
young lady, what a happy day it is for me to 
see you back again ! My very heart jumps for 
joy." And seizing the hands held out to her 
by the two ladies, she pressed them to her lips. 
" Sure, I could not close my eyes last night 
for the gladness I felt at the thoughts of seeing 
you this blessed day, and I thought to myself 
that joy can drive away sleep as well as grief, 
which I never suspected before." 
The naivete with which this confession was

THE REPEALERS. 199 
made, excited a smile from the ladies; and Lady 
Oriel, in French, requested that they would 
encourage Grace to talk, for her mellifluous 
brogue and simple shrewdness highly amused 
and interested her. They entered the cabin, 
or cottage, as it deserves to be called, and com- 
plimented Grace on its perfect neatness and 
good order. Every thing was in its place, and 
an air of comfort pervaded the whole, that 
was highly gratifying to her visiters. The per- 
fume of the flowers from the garden was wafted 
through the open casement, and freshly-gathered 
nosegays adorned the dresser and the window 
sill. 
When the ladies were seated, Grace pointed 
to the clock and said, " Och! dear young lady, 
that is, Mrs. Forrester I mean, for sure, though 
you're still a young lady, it's not proper for me 
to be calling you so, just as if you were not 
married ; every time I look at that elegant

200 THE REPEALERS. 
and beautiful clock, I think of you, and bless 
you ; and sure the blessing of even a poor sim- 
ple creature like me, coming from the heart, 
can't but do good. There never was anything 
that puts serious and blessed thoughts into the 
head like a clock ; when I am alone here at my 
work, it seems such good company to me, that 
I almost consider it like a living creature ; and 
when I hear it go tick, tick, sure it seems as if 
it was reminding me that time is passing swiftly 
away, and that I must not waste it. Then 
there's its hand, pointing always to the coming 
hour, like hope, and only pausing a moment at 
that hour, and then advancing to another; it's 
like the time it marks, always passing yet still 
the same, for it's us that change, and not time. 
Sure there's eternity in the thoughts a clock 
puts into the mind ; there it stands, showing us 
all the hours we pass, each one of which brings 
us nearer to the last hour of hfe. But sure I'm

THE REPEALERS. 201 
forgetting myself, to talk so boldly before such 
grand company." 
The ladies encouraged Grace, and she pro- 
ceeded, " Well then, ladies, I declare that some- 
how or other, that clock makes me think as I 
never thought before I had it  of how quick 
life is passing away  our hours and minutes 
are counted, even as are counted the hours 
by the steady hand advancing round the dial ; 
and it makes me reflect on the necessity of 
preparing for that hour when, though we 
can no longer trace the warning hand of the 
clock, it will still remain to convey the same 
lesson to others. Och ! what fine thoughts 
are to be found in simple things, if one had 
the gift to express ''em as one feels 'em. The 
flowers that spring up delight us, and fade 
even while we are enjoying their fragrance. 
The trees, lately the pride of the fields, whose 
leaves wither and die, all seem intended to

remind us that every thing must perish, to re- 
concile us to the same fate, and to prepare us 
for it." 
There was a solemnity in Grace's look and 
manner, that not even her strongly Irish accent 
could impair ; and I.ady Oriel felt a sympathy 
for her, that no person of her class had ever 
before excited in her mind. 
" How is your husband, Grace ?" asked Mrs. 
Forrester. 
" Indeed then, ma'am, it 's finely he is, and 
quite come to his senses again, and stays at 
home at nights, and minds his work by day, 
just as he used to do before he ever heard 
of them poor foolish Repalers. Perhaps it 's 
all for the best that he took that mad turn, 
though it did make one miserable at the time, 
for, sure, I was not sensible enough of my hap- 
piness, until I thought it had left me ; and now 
it is come back, I feel as if I never could be

thankful enough to God. We are sad ungrate- 
ful creatures, and go on from day to day enjoy- 
ing all the good that Providence sends us, just 
as if we had a right to it, but when misfortune 
comes, we then begin to know the value of our 
past happiness, though it only makes us more 
discontented with present troubles. How few, 
like me, have had the blessing to recover what 
they had lost ! and this makes me remember 
every hour with gratitude what I owe to the 
Almighty," 
The blue eyes of Grace became suffused with 
tears, and as she wiped them with the corner of 
her apron, she observed, with a smile, " There 
are tears of sorrow, tears of joy, and tears of 
thankfulness. Mine are the last, and they 
refresh me as the dews of heaven refresh the 
earth, and lighten my heart when it is weighed 
down by the sense of my own un worthiness and 
the goodness of God.''

" Grace, I have been telling Lady Oriel of 
the delicious buttermilk you used to give me to 
drink," said Mrs. Forrester ; " have you any 
at present ?" 
" Och ! it 's myself that has," replied Grace, 
" for I churned this morning at the peep of 
day, thinking ye would be passing this way, 
and have kept the can of buttermilk in spring 
water in the dairy. Sure, if the lady would be 
so condescending as to taste it, I M be mighty 
proud, and if you 'd all of ye just eat a bit of 
my griddle-cake and kirkime,''^ it 's a favour, 
and an honor too, that I 'd never forget." 
The ladies accepted Grace's offer; who, 
spreading on a table a cloth as white as a snow- 
drop, made of the yarn of her own spinning, 
placed a wooden piggin, equally white, piled 
with kirkime in the centre, a griddle-cake at 
one end, and a jug of buttermilk at the other, 
* Eggs boiled hard, and chopped in fresh butter.
## p. 205 (#215) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 205 
with small piggins for the ladies to drink out 
of, and wooden knives for the butter,  the 
Irish being as particular to use wooden knives 
for butter, as the higher class of EngUsh are to 
use only silver. Grace waited on her guests 
with an alacrity and delight, that proved the 
gratification she felt at the occupation; and 
Lady Oriel declared she had never partaken of 
a more delicious repast. 
Grace wished to present the ladies with nose- 
gays, and for this purpose would have plucked 
half the flowers in her garden ; but they pre- 
vented her, reminding her that they had such 
abundance at home, that they preferred seeing 
them in the garden. 
The party drove away, followed by the bless- 
ings and grateful curtsies of Grace, who re- 
mained at the door until the carriage had 
vanished from her view, and then entered, 
repeating aloud to herself, " ^Vas there ever

206 THE REPEALERS. 
such dear, kind, good ladies ? No pride in 'em, 
and so pleased with every thing in my cottage, 
when, sure, every thing I have I owe to them. 
How I wish Jim could have seen ^em, seated 
round that table, praising every thing, and so 
condescending to me. But, och ! sure, I quite 
forgot to tell 'em about poor Mary Mahoney 
and her husband. This was very thoughtless 
of me, and shows the truth of the old saying, 
that when one is happy oneself, one forgets 
those who are unhappy. Well, sure, I '11 go 
and see poor Mary to-morrow, an^ then go to 
the great house, to tell 'em all about her, for I 
know she depends on me. What would she 
think, the poor dear creature, if she knew how 
I have neglected to speak about her ?" 
When Jim returned from his work, Grace 
told him of the visit she had received, and 
dwelt with delight and gratitude on the kind- 
ness of the old mistress, the young lady, and
## p. 207 (#217) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 207 
the sweet manners of the beautiful young 
English lady. 
" Is she as handsome as Mrs. Forrester ?'' 
asked Jim, " for, according to my notions, she 
is the biggest beauty of a lady in all Ireland. 
I say of a lady, Grace, bekase I know one that, 
in my eyes, is twice as handsome, and not a 
hundred miles off at this moment. Faith, you 
bkish, Grace ma-colleen, just as if you knew 
who I mean, though sure I have not told you 
her name." 
" Och ! Jim agrah, I wouldn't be making 
comparisons between the two ladies, but what 
the difference between 'em is, I could tell you. 
Mrs. Forrester looks as if she had never known 
trouble, and that tears had never filled her 
eyes, though she's one that, if the trouble 
came, would bear it nobly, for she's full of 
feeling. She 's like a fresh rose in full bloom, 
before the sun or the wind has faded it. But

208 THE REPEALERS. 
the other lady looks as if tears were no stran- 
gers to her eyes, for all they Ve so bright, and 
that they had looked up to Heaven so often 
when troubled on this earth, that they stole the 
soft blue of the sky when she is letting fall the 
tears of night. One would like to tell Mrs. 
Forrester all one's happiness, for one knows she 
would feel it, and rejoice at it ; but one would 
choose that English lady to tell all one's griefs 
to, because one sees that she has learned to pity 
others, by having suffered herself, great, and 
grand, and beautiful as she is. Mrs. Forrester, 
Jim, gives me the notion of an angel, and the 
other lady that of a saint." 
The husband of Mary Mahoney had been 
tried and acquitted of the charge brought 
against him ; but he returned to his suffering 
wife with ruined health, the consequence of a 
gaol-fever, and totally incapable of working. 
The poor woman, too, had never recovered her

premature confinement, and continued in a 
languishing state ; both unable to make any 
exertion for their support. Grace and her 
liusband assisted them to the utmost of their 
power; but the broken constitutions of the 
luckless couple required many comforts which 
the Cassidys lacked the means, though not the 
inclination, to give them. The Repealers in 
the neighbourhood, looking on Mahoney as a 
political victim, wished to identify his cause 
as their own, and made a subscription between 
them, amounting to a few pounds, which they 
sent him, with an inflated letter, expressive of 
their sympathy for his situation, their hatred 
of the tyranny and injustice that had led to it, 
and their determination to support and avenge 
him. This epistle was signed by the most 
prominent of the faction, with " Repealer" 
added to each name ; and the subscribers were 
known to be the most lawless and ill-conducted 
men in the parish.

When the letter and money were delivered 
to Mahoney, he was in the greatest distress, 
undergoing all the privations that poverty can 
impose, with a beloved wife pining in languor 
before his eyes, and whom proper nourishment 
might restore to health. The poor man read 
the letter, and then laid it on the table, casting 
a wistful glance at the money, and then at the 
pale cheek and attenuated person of his wife ; 
the purse which contained it seemed to him as 
if it held the elixir of life, and his affection for 
Mary almost triumphed over his principles; 
but a second perusal of the letter restored him 
to himself, and he determined to return the 
money to the donors. 
Mary watched the changes in his countenance, 
and asked him what the letter was about ; and 
when he read it to her, and told her his de- 
cision, she left her chair, and approaching 
the one he reclined in, pressed her lips to

his forehead, and a tear fell on his face at the 
moment. 
" God be praised ! cuishlamachree,'" exclaimed 
she, " that you have had courage to resist this 
temptation ! I know it was for me that you 
looked so wistfully for a moment at that purse ; 
but heaps of gold could not give me the happi- 
ness that the certainty of your good principles 
has given me." 
" Och, Mary, ma-vourneen,'" replied the poor 
man, " poverty is a frightful thing, for it leaves 
a body open to such temptations, and he who 
would remain honest ought to keep away want, 
or pray to have a friend like you to prop up his 
tottering good resolutions when he is tempted. 
I have had enough of Repalers, and wish I 
might never hear the name again ; but their 
money shall not pay the price of our broken 
health and broken hearts  no; I'd rather die 
than touch it ! You see they don't give it, as

good neighbours, to a poor and suffering man 
and woman, but they want to make me pass for 
a victim to tyranny and injustice, when I 'm 
only a victim to my own wilful folly, in not 
listening to your advice, and attending to their 
wicked and pernicious counsels. It is true, I 
was not guilty of the crime laid to my charge, 
and, God be thanked ! my innocence was 
proved; but had I not been in the habit of 
going out at night, and, at all unseasonable 
hours, of attending their meetings, I could not 
have been suspected ; so that all my sufferings 
have been brought on by myself, and what 's 
worse, my own dear Mary, all yours." 
" Never think of mine, cuishlamachree,'^ re- 
plied Mary ; " sure, now that your eyes are 
open, and that our thoughts are the same, I 'm 
a happy woman ; and if 1 saw you once more 
in good health, I 'd have nothing on earth to 
desire. '"*

The purse was returned to the Repealers, 
with a candid exposition of the altered views 
and feelings of Mahoney, who was voted by 
them a turncoat and a coward, and strongly 
suspected to be a spy ; a suggestion that only 
one of the faction had the good sense to doubt, 
and who made the simple observation, that a 
spy would not have declared his dereliction 
from them, as Mahoney had done, but would 
have imposed on them to the last. 
From the moment that Mahoney refused the 
aid of the Repealers, he became a marked man 
with them ; his horse was houghed, his cow 
maimed, his pigs killed, and his garden, that 
spot which had been the pride and pleasure of 
poor Mary, was uprooted, the paling destroyed, 
and every plant, flower, and vegetable, was 
scattered over the road. Mr. Disney, the vene- 
rable and worthy pastor, came to the assistance 
of the unhappy couple, and relieved their wants.
## p. 214 (#224) ############################################
214 THE REPEALERS. 
A few of the gentry in the neighbourhood sub- 
scribed to buy them a cow, and allow them a 
weekly stipend until they were able to work ; 
but this protection only drew fresh attacks of 
violence from the misguided men who had vow- 
ed his destruction, as Mahoney was now looked 
upon as the protege of the anti-repealers ; and 
each act .of aggression committed on him was 
meant as an attack on the persons who were 
charitably relieving his wants. Threatening 
notices were found nailed on his door ; his 
humble friends and neighbours were warned 
not to assist him or enter his house ; and a very 
iew days saw the cow given to him sacrificed, 
like the former, to the brutal rage of the vin- 
dictive rabble, leaving the poor couple nearly 
heart-broken by such a fearful system of per- 
secution. 
Luckily for the poor Mahoneys, the family 
of Springmount arrived at this critical period,

THE REPEALERS. 215 
and Mr. Desmond having heard of the tyranny 
exercised by the lawless depredators over this 
unhappy couple, determined to protect them. 
Grace Cassidy, who had never deserted them, 
in defiance of all threats, proceeded to their 
cottage the morning after the visit of the ladies 
from Springmount, taking with her, according 
to her usual custom, a basket of provisions. 
Even since the last visit, only four days be- 
fore, fresh depredations had been committed, 
and the air of misery and desolation this once 
cheerful spot wore was painful to witness. 
The broken paling of the garden lay scattered 
around, dead flowers and plants were pro- 
strate on the earth they lately decked, and the 
effluvia of putrified vegetables tainted the air. 
The windows were all broken, the parasitical 
plants that nearly covered the cottage torn 
down, and drooping their withered leaves in 
death.
## p. 216 (#226) ############################################
216 THE REPEALERS. 
" And this/' thought Grace, " is the work 
of the friends of Ireland, the Repalers, who 
are ever to be traced by the ruin and destruc- 
tion that marks their path. What will be 
their next act of oppression and cruelty to 
this unhappy couple, to whom they have left 
nothing but a little life? Is there no law to 
save us from such terrible scourges ? Och ! 
if the humane English knew only half what 
the quiet and dacent people are exposed to, 
they would make some effort to save us." 
Grace entered the cottage, and was shocked 
at the scene that presented itself to her. The 
poor couple were sitting on the floor, with 
disease preying on their exhausted frames, 
every article of their furniture broken in 
pieces and strewing the floor, and all their 
provisions trampled under foot. The same 
miscreants who had hitherto been persecuting 
them had broken into their cottage the night

before, and completed this work of destruc- 
tion by breaking and smashing every thing in 
the house; Mary was half dead with fright, 
having expected every moment, during the stay 
of the Repealers, to see her husband and child 
massacred ; for it had been debated whether 
he should be killed or not, when her passionate 
entreaties to spare his life had touched even 
their obdurate hearts, and they departed 
leaving the wretched couple exhausted with 
suifering, their household gods shivered at 
their feet, and their only child nearly in con- 
vulsions from excessive terror. 
Grace, Uke a ministering angel, tried to 
comfort and assist them: she made them par- 
take of some of the provisions she had brought, 
and cheered them by the intelligence of the 
arrival of the dear good ould master, and all 
his family, at Springmount, who would soon 
help and save them.

While she was yet holding out this hope 
to her poor friends, Mr. Desmond and Colonel 
Forrester, who had heard of the attack on the 
Mahoneys the night before, came to visit the 
cottage, and amply realized Grace'*s promises; 
for, no sooner had they witnessed the destruc- 
tion around, than Mr. Desmond declared he 
would remove the Mahoneys to Springmount, 
where they should have the protection of his 
own roof, and left the family overpowered by 
their gratitude, while he returned to send a 
conveyance for their removal. 
" I well knew he would," said Grace, " for 
sure there 's not his match in the world for 
goodness ; and now, dear friends, you may look 
on your troubles as being over, when once you 
are lodged under his happy roof. Sure, Mary, 
you must let me make you a little dacent to 
meet the ladies ; and you too, dear cousin, 
pray tidy yourself a bit : though weak enough

a good bed, and an aisy mind, will, with the 
blessing of God, soon set you and Mary right ;

" Och ! Grace, ma-vourneen, it's yourself that 
always has words of comfort, and pleasant 
tones to spake 'em in, and looks of kindness 
too," said Mary ; " may you never require 
the services that you have so often rendered 
me ! But if you should, och ! Grace, it's myself 
that would be a sister to you, for I feel as if 
it was the same warm red blood that set both 
our hearts a beating, and put loving thoughts 
in 'em. I never, as you know, Grace asthore, 
had the blessing of a sister, and you are in 
the same state ; often and often have I grieved 
for it, for sure one seems to be incomplete,

pillow, played in infancy the same plays,

and grown into womanhood side by side like 
two roses on one stem. Let us then be as 
sisters, dear Grace ; for much as I have to love 
in my husband and child, I want to extend 
my love still wider. Sure God has filled our 
hearts with affection, and happy are they who 
have objects to share it from their birth, but 
us who have not sisters or brothers, the na- 
tural links in the chain of love, we must forge 
'em for ourselves, and be to each other what 
Providence has denied to us  sisters."

CHAPTER XIV. 
" Some fiery fop, with new commission vain, 
Who sleeps on brambles till he kills his man, 
Some frolic drunkard, reeling from a feast, 
Provokes a broil, and stabs you for a jest." 
The cold-hearted and calculating Lord Del- 
more hurried from London, without one feeling 
of pity towards the wife, even yet a bride, that 
he was deserting, nay, whom he had plundered 
of her mother's gift. He recoiled from the re- 
membered instances of her selfishness and fri- 
volity that had come under his notice, as if he 
were free from such defects, instead of being 
pre-eminent in them, and soiled by actions, in

comparison to which the errors of his wife ap- 
peared as virtues: thus verifying the obser- 
vation, that the less goodness we have, the 
more do we require in others, and the less are 
we inclined to overlook their deficiencies. No 
compunctious reflections visited his breast at 
having marred the happiness of a young and 
pretty woman ; and if any feeling was excited 
towards her, it was one of distaste. 
He pursued his course to Paris with rapidity, 
anxious to lose the sense of the humihating ex- 
hibition he had made, vis-d-vis to White's ; and 
forgetful that one of the advantages derived 
from our boasted march of intellect is the 
celerity with which scandal and gossip are 
conveyed from one capital to the other. The 
march of intellect is often confounded with 
the gallop of frivolity, and may sometimes 
be called the halt of reason ; and if we reflect 
on the avidity with which personal scandal.

private anecdotes, and mysterious innuendoes 
are sought after and propagated, we can 
hardly flatter ourselves that the " march of 
intellect,"' or " general spread of knowledge," 
have made us wiser or better. 
It is the fashion to decry certain newspapers, 
and to hold up their editors to reprobation for 
the personalities in which they indulge. We 
believe ourselves moral, religious, and good, 
when we declaim against such publications ; but 
we forget that it is we who give the taste for 
them, and the editors only administer to our 
appetites. If the taste existed not, we should 
have none of the publications alluded to ; but 
we never blame ourselves, being content to 
blame others.

at Paris in a very few days after himself, and

tion much less flattering, though more marked, 
than that which he had hitherto excited in the 
French capital. He found himself much less 
recherche, though more stared at ; and was 
oftener invited to Le Salon des Etrangers, 
than to the English Ambassador'*s. Finding 
his time hang heavy on his hands, he by de- 
grees accustomed himself to pass much of it at 
Le Salon, and risked the greater part of the 
sum so dishonorably acquired at Rouge et Noir, 
with the general result of such experiments, the 
loss of it, and with it his temper ; a union 
of no unfrequent occurrence in the life of a 
gambler. 
An impatient, and equivocal ejaculation, in- 
stigated by the fate of his last stake, offended 
a French officer ; who, in return, applied an 
epithet to him that admitted of no doubt of 
the intention to insult him. Angry words suc- 
ceeded, and a rencontre was arranged for the

next morning in the Bois de Boulogne, which 
terminated in the death of Lord Del more, who 
fell pierced through the heart by the ball of his 
adversary : thus incurring his doom through the 
means of the theft committed on his wife, as 
without that money he would not have played 
at Le Salon, nor have had the quarrel which 
led to his duel. 
Lord and Lady Abberville soon made their 
appearance at Springmount : the former full of 
les dernier s " on dits"" of the underlings at the 
Treasury, which were attempted to be passed 
off as extracts from private letters from the 
ruling powers ; and the latter " big with the 
fate" of female reputation, and sending forth 
insinuations and implications of no doubtful 
import, had the ears that received them been 
at all akin to the malicious tongue that uttered 
them. Her malice was so generally known, 
that when the mode of wearing bracelets in the

form of serpents first came out, Lady Abber- 
ville was one of the earliest adopters of it, 
which gave rise to two lines that were very 
generally repeated in the circles in which she 
moved, the individuals composing them, con- 
sidering that next to the pleasure of hearing an 
enemy attacked, is that of hearing a friend. 
The lines were :  
" Of Abberville now you need feel no alarm. 
The serpent has fled from her tongue to her arm." 
" I have heard to-day from Lady Notting- 
ham," said Lady Abberville, " who writes that 
Mr. Henry Vernon's daughter is to be married 
to the Marquis of Tadcaster. What a mci- 
alliance! it is really shocking. Such a vulgar 
family of parvenus, mais ' Qui suit se faire

must admit, is very handsome, though her petit

citizeness of credit and renown, and of fortune 
I'll be sworn ; for a man of fashion rarely goes 
into the city, except to his banker, or to search 
for some one who will entitle him to have a 
banker." 
' But Lord Durnford is already rich, and 
can have no temptation to marry," said Mrs. 
Forrester, " wholly for money." 
" Qui salt, ma chhe dame ?" replied Lady 
Abbcrville. " Men may have large estates, 
and green acres, but there is a certain board of 
green cloth, in the purlieus of St. James's, 
that has discovered the secret of sweeping them 
away * at one full swoop,' or dismantling them 
so rapidly, that the wand of enchantment never 
accomplished a transfer of property with more 
celerity. It was to this great modern alche- 
mist, that a ruined frequenter of his verdant 
table asked, in the agony of losing his last 
stake, ' What ! will you not leave me a tree

to hang myself upon ?' the whole of his woods 
having disappeared during the season. Now 
1 know that Lord Durnford was a constant 
frequenter at this transmuter of metals, and 
therefore I think it probable he has found it 
convenient to marry a rich wife: besides, 1 
know that few men marry except for money," 
stealing a spiteful glance at Colonel Forrester, 
" and I rejoice that I was an untochered lass, as 
I could not bear to be married for my fortune, 
a fear that must always enter into the minds of 
rich ladies." 
The whole party felt the malice of Lady 
Abberville's insinuation, but it fell harmless 
on them ; and they were more inclined to pity 
the inherent spitefulness that led her to wound 
those whom it was her interest to conciliate, 
tbnn angry at the attempt. 
" Of course you have heard of Lord Del- 
more's extraordinary marriage, and desertion 
of his wife,''' resumed Lady Abberville. " His

THE REPEALERS. 229 
history is a curious one altogether. I was much 
in his confidence," (looking at Lady Oriel,) 
" and he has told me some very amusing anec- 
dotes." 
The mischief-loving Cancanniere was disap- 
pointed at seeing Lady Oriel show no symp- 
tom of embarrassment at her insinuation, and 
therefore changed the subject. Lady Oriel 
had previously seen in the newspapers all the 
particulars of the marriage, and anticipating 
the malice of Lady Abberville, had schooled 
herself to conquer every symptom of uneasiness, 
should the subject be referred to. 
Having exhausted all her scandal, the inde- 
fatigable lady returned to the end and aim 
of all her present speculations  the barrack 
to be built, and declared that she " had an 
architect ready to commence the building, as 
she was sure that, as soon as it should be 
erected, the government must see the neces- 
sity of purchasing it. The country was be-

coming every day more troubled : without the 
means of accommodating a large military force, 
it never could be tranquillized; but strange 
to say, the Marquis of Mona seemed to be 
ignorant of the actual state of affairs, though 
she had endeavoured to enlighten him. The 
barrack was the only means of terrifying the 
lower classes, and civilizing the middling ; she 
had made herself thoroughly acquainted with 
all the intrigues and plots of white-feet, black- 
feet, agitators, repealers, and conservatives, 
and knew more of what was going on, and 
likely to go on, than any magistrate in the 
country, or all the magistrates put together." 
Having finished her tirade she withdrew, 
much to the relief of the circle at Springmount ; 
and Mr. Desmond observed, that to her might 
well be applied the remark made by a poet on 
the gifted Madame de Stael, " that she excelled 
more in monologue than dialogue, never allow- 
ing any one to speak but herself, though," added

he, " it is profanation to compare an intriguante 
to a woman of genius." 
When Lady Oriel had recovered from the 
fatigues of her recent journey, Mr. and Mrs. 
Desmond proposed their making a tour to the 
Lakes of Killarney ; and the party set out, de- 
termined to be amused  a determination that 
we recommend to all parties about to undertake 
that perilous adventure, a party of pleasure  
the progress and termination of which are ge- 
nerally as little pleasurable, as though a spell 
was cast over the individuals composing it. 
Such parties in general commence in idleness, 
and end in ennui, leaving aught but agreeable 
impressions of the sights seen, or of the persons 
with whom they have been seen. And why is 
this ? it is because people expect too much, and 
will not bear with too little. A bad day, or a 
bad inn, can eclipse the superficial gaiety of in- 
dividuals tired of themselves, and depending for 
amusement on external sources; and in the frame

of mind or humour such discomforts produce, 
the agreeable companions of the day before, 
agreeable from the exhilarating effects of sun- 
shine and good accommodation, are looked upon 
as disagreeable and tiresome, because we are 
conscious of being both ourselves, when we 
draw the uncharitable conclusion. 
The party from Springmount had predeter- 
mined to find bad inns an amusing novelty, and 
bad weather a bearable evil, in their own agree- 
able society ; and, consequently, the expedition 
had little chance of ending like the generality 
of parties of pleasure. As they travelled with 
Mr. Desmond's horses, they proceeded not as 
rapidly as travellers in search of amusement love 
to do, as it seems to be an understood thing 
that pleasure and rapidity of movement are in- 
separable ; people gallop through countries they 
go to examine, and leave them with a confused 
jumble of ideas, in which scarcely a distinct 
notion is defined, the recollections being hke the

trees, hills, and mountains that they flitted by, 
one succeeding another, and all vague, dreamy, 
and confused. 
They rested the first night at a country inn, 
and were more amused than disquieted at ob- 
serving the bustle and agitation their arrival 
produced. 
" Bill, Bill, arrah ! where are you, Bill ? 
Can't you run and get the bellows to blow 
a spark of life into the fire ?" said or rather 
screamed the master of the inn : " Sure the 
ladies will die of the could any how.*" 
" Is it the bellows you main ?" said Bill, 
(thrusting his fingers into the uncombed locks 
of fiery hue that hung in wild disorder over his 
head,) " sure it has lost it's nose, and its no use 
thrying it; sorrow's the breath it will give."" 
And so saying, he knelt, and supplied the place 
of the bellows with his mouth, until he pro- 
duced a blaze from the turf that sent forth 
sparks of light as red as his own locks.

" Run, run for your life. Bill, and see what's 
in the larder," said the landlord, walking off at 
the same time to give his instructions. 
The ladies had retired to examine the bed- 
rooms, the windows of which looked into the 
yard, and saw the indefatigable Bill, aided by 
a bare-legged girl, in active pursuit of some 
poultry, whose cries bore witness to their alarm. 
" This, I suppose,'"* said Lady Oriel, pointing 
to the yard, " is the larder, and before us is our 
dinner." 
'' Them devils of ould cocks is as cunning 
as a fox," screamed the panting Bill, " they'll 
never be caught ; thry the ould hen, Biddy, 
she's not so cute, say something civil to her, 
and she'll come to you." 
" Chick, chick," said Biddy, with her most 
insinuating smile. But smiles were vain ; the 
ould hen was as wary as her male friends, and 
nothing remained but for Bill to hunt them,

and pelt them down with stones, hitting with a 
dexterity that surprised the ladies, each stone 
bringing down a wounded bird. 
" Arrah ! stop, Bill, are you mad, you fool of 
the world ?"" screamed Biddy, " sure you were 
only to kill two, and there you've kill'd four." 
" Fve a mind to kill every mother's soul of 
'em," said Bill, " for giving me all this bother- 
ation, instead of letting themselves be caught 
quietly at oncet, when they know they must be 
caught at last." 
The wounded birds were seized, their flutter- 
ing pinions broken, and their heads wrung by 
Bill, who desired Biddy to run into the lough, 
and pull him out two of them ducks. 
" Can't you do it yourself. Bill ?*" said the 
gentle Biddy, " and bad manners to you." 
"Arrah ! how can I, woman," says he, " now 
that I've got my stockings on ? Go in, Biddy 
agrah, and I'll give you a glass to warm you."

2S6 THE REPEALERS. 
" Here goes," said Biddy, tucking up her 
garments as high as decency would permit, and 
rushing into the green slimy pool, designated as 
the lough by Bill, in which sundry ducks were 
enjoying their verdant bath, which, as Bill often 
observed, was meat, drink, and washing to 
them. She seized a struggling duck in one 
hand, and placing it under her arm, whence it 
sent streams of liquid mud over her garments, 
she grasped another, whose screams and strug- 
gles seemed to excite her anger, instead of 
moving her pity, as she said, " Well, divil mend 
your taypots, now I have ye in spite of yeVe 
teeth, and the English lords and ladies will 
know what ye're made of before ye''re two hours 
oulder." 
" Success to you, Biddy agrah," cried Bill. 
*' Sure yourself is the girl for bringing 'em to 
raison." 
Mrs. Forrester made the gentlemen laugh
## p. 237 (#247) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 237 
when she attempted a description of the scene 
she had witnessed; and the ladies confessed, 
that not even their disgust at the cruelty the 
feathered tribe had suffered could subdue the 
laughter that Bill and Biddy had excited. 
The dinner was served in a much shorter 
time than could have been expected, and the 
quantity could not have been blamed, except in 
its excess, whatever might be said of the qua- 
lity. A salted shoulder of mutton boiled, and 
called corned mutton, served up with cab- 
bage, graced the top of the board ; a piece of 
roast-beef confronted it at the bottom ; two 
broiled ducks smothered in onions flanked one 
side, and a spatch cock, which means a broiled 
fowl, faced it ; the interstices of the table being 
filled with potatoes and pickles that seemed to 
have " fallen into the sear and yellow leaf." 
Bill seemed as astonished as grieved that 
neither the ducks nor fowls were touched, and

could not resist recommending them, as being 
elegant and mighty tinder, an observation that 
called smiles to the faces of all the party. 
Hearing Lord OrieFs remark to Mrs. Desmond 
that the beef was more highly flavoured in Ire- 
land than in England, but much less fat. Bill, 
with a bow and a pull of one of his elfin locks, 
begged their lordships' pardon, but the raison 
that bit of beef on the table was so Ia?ie was, 
that it was from a piper's cow, who had danced 
away all her fat. 
The second course consisted of the three 
remaining slaughtered fowls, fried eggs and 
bacon, buttered greens, roast potatoes, apple- 
dumplings, and cream-custards ; and again Bill 
strenuously recommended the fowls  " Sure, 
if they 'd only taste 'em, they 'd find 'em beau- 
tiful; there wasn't finer in all Ireland, and a 
body might travel from Cork to Dubhn and 
not meet with their match any how."
## p. 239 (#249) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 239 
Bill had a motive for urging the guests to 
demolish the fowls, which was, that he had 
been scolded by the host and hostess for killing 
four instead of two, and was afraid of another 
lecture, if they returned untouched. " Sure, 
my lords, I'm greatly afeard yourselves and 
the ladies, saving their presence, aren't quite 
continted with the dinner, for ye have eat so 
little." 
Bill was re-assured by the commendations 
bestowed on the repast ; and his appetite being 
excited by the dainties before him, he mentally 
promised himself to partake a portion before 
they were restored to the pantry of the hostess. 
On removing them, aided by the active Biddy, 
he dissected, or rather tore the limbs from the 
ducks and fowls; and having piled up a py- 
ramid of wings and legs of ducks and fowls on 
a plate, covered with onion-sauce, he concealed 
it, pour le moment^ in the place next at hand.

which happened to be the bed-room designed 
for Lady Oriel ; and the savoury mess was put 
under her ladyship'^s bed, breathing odours the 
least likely to charm a fine lady, though pecu- 
liarly attractive to the olefactory nerves of Bill 
and his friend Biddy. 
" By the powers, Biddy my girl," said Bill, 
'' we'll have an eligant supper when they're 
all gone to their beds! and I'll just lave the 
plate under the bed, till we've an opportunity 
of slipping it safe into some hole or corner. 
But the divil's in the misthris, she's always 
poking her nose everywhere, and smells the 
taste of a rat, if one has only got a morsel hid 
in a corner; sure many's the comfortable bit 
and sup I 'd share with you, Biddy my dear, 
but that I've no place to hide 'em, and am 
obliged to swallow 'em up, at the risk of 
choking myself, bekase the ould woman is 
always after my heels."
## p. 241 (#251) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 241 
' When Bill descended into the kitchen with 
only the carcases of the ducks and fowls, the 
hostess screamed out, " Well, if this does not 
bait out Ban and Bansigher !  ten wings and ten 
legs all gone, and nothing left but the poor 
bodies of three fowls and two ducks ! Talk of 
aiting, sure it 's them English lords and ladies 
that have the stomachs, and could ait twice as 
much as the Irish gentry ! Faith they must be 
charged double price to make up for it; and 
if they dhrink as much as they ait, they '11 have 
a purty long bill to pay !"' 
" Indeed then, misthriss, you're right enough, 
they're the very divils for swallowing wing 
after wing, and leg after leg disappeared ; sure 
I thought they 'd never stop, they kept playing 
away at such a rate !" 
While Bill was speaking, Biddy entered with 
the plates, on which were the fragments of the 
small morsels bf beef and mutton, the only part

of the dinner touched by the guests. The 
hostess looked over the plates, and then, turn- 
ing to Bill with one of her most fiery glances, 
" Arrah, you tief of the world ! you gor- 
mandizing rogue ! did the English lords and 
ladies swallow the bones as well as the flesh of 
my elegant wings and legs ?" 
" Faith and they picked 'em clane," said 
Bill, " and threw 'em in the fire ; that 's what 
they did;' 
" I '11 never believe you, ye rogue of the 
world !" cried the enraged hostess ; " sure such 
genteel company would never do the like ; and 
if they did, wouldn't I smell it all over the 
house?" 
At this moment the valet-de-chambre of Lord 
Oriel descended, followed by a footman bearing 
the pyramidally piled plate, which he placed 
on the table ; and the valet angrily complained 
that her ladyship's room had been infected with
## p. 243 (#253) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. ^43 
the abominable smell of the onions, and that 
having tried to discover whence the smell came, 
Mrs. Marsden, her ladyship^s femme-de-cham- 
bre, had found the plate hid under her lady- 
ship's bed, and was now burning eau a bruit to 
get rid of the dreadful odour. 
The cheek of Bill assumed a crimson tint, 
one shade darker than his locks, he saw that 
denial was vain, and was stupified by the detec- 
tion of his guilt ; Biddy disappeared, and the 
hostess, having thanked my lord's body-servant, 
as she called him, for causing the elegant wings 
and legs to be restored to her, turned to the 
culprit, and shaking her head at him, said, 
" No wonder, you carroty-headed rogue, you're 
so fat and plump, when this is the way you're 
robbing, and pilfering, and backbiting grand 
company, by making me believe they're aiting 
me out of house and home ; no wonder you kill 
four fowls, you cruel-hearted baist, instead of

two, when it' s all to put into your own hungry 
mouth ; I Ve long suspected you, and looked 
after you sharply, but now you're found out, 
and here" (holding up the plate) " are the 
bones that you said the grand company picked 
so clane, and then threw into the fire. Sure, 
if they knew that 3^ou wanted to make 'em pass 
for porpoises and giants in regard to aiting, 
what would they say to you ? If you had stolen 
the beef or mutton, I wouldn't blame you so 
much, but my elegant ducks and fowls, I'll 
never forgive you." 
The inn was so small, and the partitions so 
thin, and the landlady's voice so loud, that all 
her harangue had been overheard by the p^rty 
from Springmount, who were not a little amused 
at this characteristic scene of Irish manners; 
and when Bill came up with tea, looking ashamed 
and afraid, they could hardly conceal their 
laughter.
## p. 245 (#255) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 24t5 
" How odd !'' said Lord Oriel, " that the 
landlady should make such a distinction in 
theft, as to be furious at his stealing poultry, 
and to say that, had he taken the beef or 
mutton, she would not have blamed him. 
Henceforth Bill will conclude that beef and 
mutton may be stolen with impunity, and that 
poultry alone is forbidden. Strange people ! how 
difficult it is for strangers to understand them/' 
Arrived at Killarney, they found the princi- 
pal inn nearly filled by visiters, and had to 
take up their abode in, the less-frequented one, 
a circumstance which, though offering worse 
accommodation, promised to afford them a bet- 
ter opportunity of judging of the national cha- 
racter in its native garb, than in the Anglicised 
hotel, where all was, or affected to be, a V Ang false, 
with bowing, curtseying, and obsequious host 
and hostess, mincing waiters, and smirking 
housemaids.
## p. 246 (#256) ############################################
246 THE REPEALERS. 
The whole party were enchanted with the 
scene, which far surpassed all their expecta- 
tions. The magnificent woods, fine mountains, 
and admirable lakes spread out like vast mirrors 
reflecting them ; and above all, the arbutus, 
with its flowers and fruit, which here flourishes 
so luxuriantly, called forth their warmest admi- 
ration. Lady Oriel contrasted her present po- 
sition and feelings with the painful ones that 
weighed down her spirits, when, a year before, 
she visited the Lakes of Cumberland, tete-a-tete 
with her husband, shrinking from contact with 
former acquaintances, lest she should encounter 
the mortification inflicted on her by the heart- 
less Lady Abberville. 
Supported now by the presence of two ladies 
who were considered models of every female vir- 
tue, her husband nearly restored to his former 
peace of mind and confidence, how much had 
she to be grateful for, and with what true

THE REPEALERS. 247 
humility did she return thanks to that All-mer- 
ciful Power that had vouchsafed to save her 
from the consequences of her imprudence ! 
The day after their arrival at Killarney, Co- 
lonel Forrester encountered the Marquis of 
Tadcaster, who had arrived from England a 
few days before with his wife, on a tour through 
the South of Ireland. He informed Colonel 
Forrester of the death of Lord Delmore, and 
the circumstances that led to it ; and, while 
commenting on the profligacy and dishonour 
which marked the conduct of Lord Delmore 
up to the last moment of his life, he stated 
the good feeling and good sense with which 
Lady Delmore had conducted herself under 
such very trying circumstances, and added, 
that though her worthless husband neither had 
made, nor intended to make a provision for her, 
yet by the settlements made by his father, 
she now found herself in possession of a suit- 
i

able jointure, which his creditors could not 
touch, but of which she immediately resigned 
three parts to the creditors, sorely against the 
advice and wishes of her father. 
" My excellent father-in-law and her uncle," 
said Lord Tadcaster, " was so gratified by the 
the whole of her conduct, that he has settled 
ten thousand pounds on her, so that she is 
now independent of her selfish father ; but she 
continues to live under his roof for the sake 
of being near her amiable mother, to whom 
she devotes all her time and attention.'" 
Lord Tadcaster asked permission to present 
his wife to the ladies, and Colonel Forrester 
returned to inform Lady Oriel of the death 
of Lord Del more, to prevent her betraying any 
emotion on hearing it publicly announced. 
When the whole of his conduct was laid 
open to her by her brother, how did she shud- 
der at the idea that this was the man for whom
## p. 249 (#259) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 249 
she had once entertained sentiments of good 
will and friendship, and towards whom she 
considered her husband had been unjust ! 
" How could I have been so deceived?"" asked 
she of herself. And this question led to a train 
of reflection, that ended by her consciousness 
that it was vanity, and the gratification his 
flattery and attentions afforded to that vanity, 
which had blinded her to the defects of this 
unprincipled man. 
How many of the finest qualities are eclipsed 
by this one passion, which, like Aaron's serpent, 
swallows up the rest ; and how many sacrifices 
of principle, honour, and happiness, are daily 
off^ered up at its shrine ! If there be a passion, 
which more than all others leads its victim 
into danger, it is vanity ; and against its in- 
dulgence every effort should be made in early 
youth, ere it has found its unfailing reward, 
vexation of spirit, shame, and ridicule.

Lady Oriel, Mrs. Desmond, and Mrs. For- 
rester, were so much pleased with the Mar- 
chioness of Tadcaster, that they invited her 
and her lord to join their party, and stay some 
time with them at Springmount,  a proposal 
that was cheerfully accepted ; and having seen 
all that the romantic and beautiful country 
round Killarney could boast, they set out on 
their return to Springmount, highly gratified 
by all that they had seen. 
At this period it was announced that Lady 
Oriel was soon likely to increase her family ; 
intelligence which delighted her husband, and 
afforded the utmost gratification to her friends. 
Lord Oriel had long sighed for this addition to 
his happiness, as it had been a source of pain 
to him to think that at his decease his ancient 
title would become extinct, and his fortune pass 
into other hands. 
The death of Lord Delmore seemed to re-

THE REPEALERS. 251 
move the last trace of Lord OriePs uneasiness. 
That heartless man could now no longer 
cross their path, to awaken dormant retro- 
spections and forgotten scandal; and seeing 
his wife beloved and respected by all around 
her, he ceased to remember that she had ever 
been exposed to slander ; or recollected it only 
to rejoice that she had recovered the place 
in society, to which her many virtues so fully 
entitled her. 
The persecution that Patrick Mahoney ex- 
perienced from the Repealers disgusted Jim 
Cassidy more with them than all the repre- 
sentations of his wife and friends. He declared 
he never would attend another meeting, and 
that henceforth he would stand aloof from them 
a declaration which filled the heart of poor 
Grace with joy and thankfulness. 
" Och ! Jim dear, this was all that was 
wanting to my happiness,"' said Grace, " and

at what a blessed moment does it come ! Sure, 
it was wrong of me, and unloving too, to doubt 
you after all I've seen of your good sense 
lately, but somehow or other I was afraid the 
speeches, and the cunning way them people 
have to make one believe black was white, 
might get you back into their hands, and sure 
that would have been the death of me, and 
not only of me, but one more precious, dear 
Jim, for I 'm in the way to be a mother.^' 
" Then God be thanked, my own Grace,'' 
said Jim, embracing her, " and you '11 see I '11 
never vex or bother you any more. Och ! you 
rogue," kissing her again, " why didn't you 
tell me before ? Sure you ought to know how 
glad it would make me. I hope, Grace a- 
vourneen, the child will be like you, for then 
I '11 love it twice as well, as I know it will 
be a blessing." 
A look of tenderness unutterable repaid

THE REPEALERS. 25S 
Jim's affectionate declaration ; and he vowed 
henceforth to be the best boy in the parish, 
and save every halfpenny he could, now that 
he was to be a father. 
" I never tould you, Grace, how often I was 
vexed at our not having a child,'" said Jim, 
" bekase I thought you might take it ill ; but 
sure it 's a bitter thing to think that a couple will 
be growing ould, with no one to love, no one 
to save for, and no one to shed a tear for ""em, 
when God takes 'em to himself. But now all 
this fear is over, and I '11 be as happy a father 
as any other poor man in the country." 
Trouble ever follows quickly on the foot- 
steps of joy. The day after the scene we have 
described, Jim Cassidy was torn from the arms 
of his distracted wife, and lodged a prisoner 
in the same gaol where he had formerly visited 
his friend Patrick Mahoney. His former con- 
nexion with the disaffected and lawless men

in his neighbourhood had rendered him an 
object of suspicion to the police, and the recent 
acts of violence in the vicinity of Cologan had 
awakened their vigilance, and led to the arrest 
of many who were less innocent of the oiFence 
with which they stood charged, than was Jim 
Cassidy. 
Unfortunately for Grace, her husband's arrest 
took place during the absence of the family 
of Springmount at the Lakes of Killarney, and 
she suffered all the anxiety and alarm such a 
circumstance was likely to produce until they 
returned. She had gone to Jim every day, 
and stayed with him in prison until the gates 
were closed, and all visiters excluded. The 
first evening, this separation was a dreadful 
trial to them both; and poor Jim wept like 
a child when the turnkey led Grace to the 
door and locked the heavy chain that secured it. 
But she conquered her own grief to administer

THE REPEALERS. 255 
comfort to his ; and smiling through her tears, 
said, " Well, dear Jim, sure v/e 're like two 
foolish children, crying because we are separated 
for a night, when, to-morrow, the moment the 
doors are opened, I '11 be here to stay with you 
all the day, and every day, till the dear mas- 
ter comes back, when you may be sure he 11 
soon open those iron gates, and send you home 
with me ; and we '11 both smile at all the trou- 
bles that 's now frightening us, and making 
us cry." 
Grace's situation increased the grief and anx- 
iety of Jim ; he trembled lest her alarm might 
endanger her safety, and reproached himself 
bitterly for ever having laid himself open to 
suspicion by his former imprudence. Patrick 
and Mary Mahoney, though both ill and suf- 
fering, had themselves conveyed in a car to 
the prison to comfort their friends, and it was 
a touching scene to behold the four mingling

their tears together, but the women smiling 
even through theirs to comfort their husbands. 
No sooner had Mr. Desmond returned to 
Springmount than he procured the release of 
Jim Cassidy, who from that moment became 
an object of suspicion and dislike to his former 
associates. He was pointed out as an informer, 
a term of reproach the most ignominious that 
can be applied in Ireland, and the most Hkely 
to draw down vengeance on the unhappy per- 
son who is the object of it. Not all Grace's 
confidence in the goodness and power of Mr. 
Desmond could tranquillize her mind for the 
future safety of her husband, and she trembled 
every time he left her presence.

CHAPTER XV. 
" Oh ! could I worship aught beneath the skies 
That earth hath seen or fancy can devise, 
Thine altar, sacred Liberty, should stand, 
Built by no mercenary vulgar hand, 
With fragrant turf and flowers as wild and fair 
As ever dress'd a bank or scented summer air." 
Jim Cassidy had only been a few days 
released from prison, when Larry Macswiggan 
came into his house one evening, and with 
evident symptoms of alarm announced that he 
had stolen away from the Cat and Bagpipes 
to inform them that the disaffected faction

assembled there, were violent in their threats 
against Cassidy, and that he feared they would 
put them into execution. " They say you are 
an informer, a turncoat, and a spy, in the pay 
of Mr. Desmond, and his Sassenach son-in-law, 
and that they will have vengeance on you and 
Patrick Mahoney. I 've often seen 'em mad 
and foolish ; but this time they bait out Ban 
and Banagher, and Ballinisloe into the bargain," 
said Larry, " for they have the very devil in 
their heads, ay, be my troth, and in their hearts 
too, and God only knows where they will 
stop." 
" I '11 go to the Cat and Bagpipes this very 
minute," said Jim Cassidy, " and confront 
'em, for no man shall say that I 'm a turn- 
coat, a spy, or an informer;" and the honest 
blood mounted to the face of the indignant 
man. 
Grace seized him by the coat, and with an

appealing look and a face pale as marble en- 
treated him not to venture amongst them. They 
are all intoxicated/' added she, " and incapable 
of listening to reason ; go not near them, Jim 
dear, but if you wish to clear yourself of their 
vile charges, wait ""till they are sober, and seek 
them with one or two quiet steady friends." 
*' Sure I '11 go with him myself," said Larry, 
" and be spokesman, and the schoolmaster 
won't refuse, I 'm sure, to give 'em some more 
of his Greek and Latin to help him out of the 
scrape ; but at this present moment they are 
too tipsy and violent to listen even to the 
Agitator himself if he was on the spot." 
Jim Cassidy yielded to the entreaties of his 
wife, and Larry began to relate the th roubles, 
as he called them, that were disturbing the 
neighbouring counties. " Faith, things get 
worse and worse every day," said he, " and 
the run on the banks has given the finishing

blow to the poor people. The cattle and pigs; 
are driven back from the fairs unsold, not a 
bill will be discounted, if it was signed by the 
Lord Liftenant himself; and them that are suf- 
fering from all this, haven't the sense to see 
that they have brought it on themselves, but 
get more desperate in their folly. If you heard 
the wicked threat'nings of the people at the 
Cat and Bagpipes ; they swore they 'd burn 
the house over the heads of Mr. Desmond and 
his family, and set fire to his woods !" 
" Och ! Larry dear," said Grace, " do you 
think they are serious in this ? and och ! why 
didn't you tell us before? Let us go, Jim, 
without losing a moment, and put the family 
on their guard." 
" There 's no danger this night any way, 
Mistress Cassidy," said Larry, " of that, I 
promise you, for they have not sufficient men 
to undertake an attack on Springmount, but

that they intend such a measure I have not the 
least doubt, and think Mr. Desmond ought to 
be informed of it to-morrow. Little, he that 
has thrown the spark of fire amongst these mad 
and wicked people, imagines the mischief he 
has caused, and if he had heard what I did to- 
night, he 'd tremble to think what he has done ; 
but gentlemen little know of what different 
stuff the minds of the poor ignorant people are 
made, and that though it 's aisy enough to drive 
'em mad, it 's no aisy thing to bring 'em back 
to their raison ; they are for all the world like 
the elephants that Dick Mulligan tould me 
they have in Ingee in their battles, who often 
turn round and thrample on those that drove 
'em on, doing more harm to their friends than 
their enemies. Sure they may say what they 
will, but I '11 never believe but what it gives 
many a heart ache to the laider of the Re- 
palers, to see and hear the cruel murders and

wicked things they do; but he can't stop 'em, 
though he can make 'em do anything else. I Ve 
seen him, and known him, and believe him to 
be a humane man, for God never gave the gift 
of fine thoughts and words to a narrow or a 
cruel heart ; therefore I wish he was now on 
the spot to hsten to the mischief that 's plotting, 
and to see, that while he is thinking of liberty 
as a fine, grand, and elegant thing, that's to 
bring blessings, and peace and plenty, on poor 
ould Ireland, but to get which some mischief 
and danger must be gone through, they are 
thinking of it as a something that will give 
every idle fellow amongst 'em the power of 
plundering the rich, living without work, and 
having no laws, and that the mischief incurred 
to gain it, is only a foretaste of that they will 
have to keep it. This is the difference between 
a gentleman's view of liberty, and the view of 
a poor ignorant man. Their laider knows this.

but he knows it would be useless to attempt 
making them feel as he does, and therefore tries 
to use them as means of carrying his point, 
hoping to be able to correct them after he has 
succeeded, which he has little chance of." 
While Larry was yet talking, shout and 
yells, from a distance, struck on the ears of his 
auditors. " They come, they come,'* cried 
Larry, " and if you wish to save your lives, let 
us fly from the house." 
A look at Grace, and the recollection of her 
situation, decided Jim to adopt the advice of 
Larry, and snatching up a cloak, which he 
threw over her shoulders, the two men hurried 
the trembling Grace through the back door of 
the cottage, and by a short cut across the fields 
that led to Springmount; which they had 
hardly reached, when they saw a column of 
fire ascend the air, and heard the shouts of 
triumph of the infuriated rabble, as the flames

spread wider and wider, embracing the paling 
and trees close to the cottage. 
Tears burst in torrents from Grace, as she 
beheld her cottage, the quiet, happy home 
where she had passed such blissful days, enve- 
loped by the lurid blaze, and she felt as if her 
happiness was destroyed with the home that 
witnessed it. 
" Och ! Jim dear,*" sobbed the poor woman, 
" our beautiful cottage, and all the nice fur- 
niture that I was so proud of; our garden and 
lovely flowers, all  all destroyed ! And to think 
that in a few hours no trace will remain of all 
that was so fair and flourishing an hour ago  
och ! it 's too cruel !" and she wept in agony on 
the shoulder of her husband. 
Jim tried to console her, and observed how 
happy it was that they had fled, for that other- 
wise their lives would have fallen a sacrifice to 
the wrath of the incendiaries. " We 're safe

and together, Grace a vourneen," said Jim ; 
" and the same good friend that provided us 
with the cottage, can give us another ; so don't 
be unhappy, and you'll see, Grace, you'll 
never have any fretting in the new house, 
as you had in the ould, on account of my 
folly." 
They gained entrance at Springmount, and 
Mr. Desmond being informed of their arrival, 
and the cause that led to it, summoned Colonel 
Forrester and Lords Oriel and Tadcaster to 
consult on the best measures to pursue. After 
much consultation, it was agreed that to go out 
and meet the rabble, now that the mischief they 
had intended was perpetrated, would be un- 
availing ; but it was decided that the park-gates 
and lodges should be guarded by armed men 
for the night, each of the noblemen, and Mr. 
Desmond, and Colonel Forrester, presiding at 
the four gates : and Mr. Desmond wrote off to

Dublin Castle an account of the whole trans- 
action. 
Lady Oriel and the Marchioness of Tad- 
caster were exceedingly alarmed at the danger 
to which they fancied their liege Lords exposed ; 
but Mrs. Desmond and Mrs. Forrester, who 
knew Ireland better, tranquillized their minds 
by the assurance that the passionate efferves- 
cence of the insurgents would evaporate with the 
fire they had kindled, and that when they had 
exhausted their fury, they would return to their 
homes. The courage of the mother and daugh- 
ter, as displayed in the confidence with which 
they saw their husbands depart for their separate 
guard stations, was even more convincing than 
their words ; but the English ladies, while sub- 
mitting to the emergency that required such a 
sacrifice of comfort on the part of their hus- 
bands, made elaborate comparisons between the 
comforts of England and Ireland, which satis-

factorily convinced themselves and those who 
heard them, that a residence in Ireland was 
like Rochefoucault's opinion of marriage,  
" sometimes convenient, but never delightful." 
The ladies sent for Grace Cassidy, that they 
might gain confidence from her unsophisticated 
account of what she had witnessed ; but the 
pale face, curved brow, and Pair abattu of 
Grace, were little calculated to reassure them. 
" How good you must be, my dear Mrs. 
Desmond," said Lady Oriel, " to live among 
a set of people on whose stability of opinion 
you cannot calculate for twenty-four hours. 
To-day they love you ; to-morrow they loathe 
you; and the change arises not in what they 
see, or know, but in the insidious dictate of 
some rancorous demagogue." 
" Och, my Lady," observed Grace, who 
overheard the observation, " do not hate and 
condemn us, although appearances are against

US. The same people, who have laid in ashes 
my happy home, would sacrifice days and nights 
to repair the mischief they have done, when 
once raison comes back to 'em ; I hate their 
actions when they are wicked, but I cannot 
hate them, for I know they act before they 
reflect. Sure it is difficult for an English lady 
to understand this, and to make allowance for 
'em. But if you knew, my lady, what good 
there 's in their hearts, you 'd forgive the mis- 
chief that's in their heads. I would not be 
afraid to go before five hundred of 'em, if my 
husband was not exposed to their fury, for they 
are tender-hearted, though their heads are so 
fiery ; and when they see a weak woman before 
'em, they will listen to her with more respect 
than to a regiment, ay, my lady, than to ten 
regiments ; but I 'm a coward for my husband, 
and tremble for him, when I 'd disdain to fear 
for myself."
## p. 269 (#279) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 
" How sorry I am, my good Mrs. Cassidy," 
said Lady Oriel, " that your neat cottage is 
destroyed ! It was only yesterday that I was 
telling Lady Tadcaster how nice it was, and 
we intended going to see 3'ou to-morrow."" 
" Sure your ladyship was good and kind, 
to think of such poor people as us, and 'twas 
an honour we can't forget ; but I 'm consoled 
for our loss when I think that this spite on 
the part of the Repalers widens the breach 
more than ever between them and my husband, 
and proves his innocence of the charges brought 
against him of being one of them. No blessing 
comes without its price, and I bow with thank- 
fulness to the will of God, happy that I have 
preserved my husband safe from all the dangers 
that threatened him." 
When Grace retired, the two English 
ladies dwelt with warm commendation on her 
beauty and simple purity of character, and

agreed, that Grace Cassidy and Mary Mahoney 
were as original as they were amiable, and of 
a more elevated nature than the female pea- 
santry in England ; commendations that were 
highly flattering to Mrs. Forrester, who was 
so partial to her protegees. When morning 
dawned, the gentlemen returned to their wives, 
and despatches were sent off to the neighbour- 
ing towns, to inform the commanding officers 
of the act of violence of the night before. After 
breakfast, they all proceeded to the still burn- 
ing ruins of the lately neat and picturesque 
cottage ; where they found Jim and Grace Cas- 
sidy weeping over the destruction of their 
household goods, and carefully collecting frag- 
ments of the destroyed articles of predilection 
as souvenirs for the future. Mr. Desmond 
assured them, that they should have a cottage 
even more convenient and pretty than the one 
they deplored, and supplied with every article

suited to their comfort; and Grace, while 
thanking and blessing him, in the honest 
warmth of her heart, only prayed that their 
new residence might look on the river and the 
mountains, for somehow she had got so used 
to them, she could not be happy without 'em. 
This request Mr. Desmond kindly promised 
should be attended to; and Grace and Jim 
returned to Springmount with lighter hearts 
and more contented minds.

CHAPTER XVI. 
" Now for our Irish wars : 
We must supplant those rough, rug-headed kerns, 
Which live like venom, where no venom else. 
But only they, have privilege to live." 
The destruction of the house and property 
of the Cassidys appalled the peaceable part of 
the inhabitants of Cologan, and excited the tur- 
bulent to still greater violence. Notices and 
threatening letters were posted up at every side, 
and the Mahoneys and Cassidys were denounced, 
and those who harboured or protected them 
menaced with vengeance. Troops were sent

THE REPEALERS. 2^7$ 
from Waterford to preserve the peace, and Mr. 
Desmond called a meeting of the magistrates, 
to take into consideration the most effectual 
method of quelling the spirit of insubordination 
that raged around him. A copy of the resolu- 
tions of the magistrates was sent to the Cat 
and Bagpipes, and, instead of producing the 
desired effect, only increased their turbulence 
and disaffection. 
" It is now coming to the point," said 
Rattling Bill ; " we must conquer them, oi 
they will conquer us : once rid of ould Des- 
mond, and his English faction, we shall have it 
all our own way ; and sure the best way to 
be rid of him is to burn Springmount. Are 
we to let him take up those turncoats, spies, 
and informers, the Mahoneys and Cassidys, as 
if he protected 'em purposely to spite us ? No ; 
let us make short work of it, and burn the 
house, and all that 's in it, to ashes."

" But what will our laider say to it, he that 
sets his face against killing and burning ?" said 
Gavin. 
"No matter what he says to it," replied 
Rattling Bill ; ' Onc't the job is done, it will 
be no use his preaching to us after. Besides, 
I don't see why, if we are to agitate, and kick 
up a row to please and serve his turn, we are 
not to kick up a row sometimes to please our- 
selves ; so I 'm all for making a bonfire of 
Springmount." 
" Yes," said another, " and as we are about 
it, let us burn the new barracks that ould mis- 
chievous woman Lady Abberville is building." 
" Ay, and her house into the bargain," said 
Bill, ** for she 's a rael bad one, that runs with 
the hare, and hunts with the hounds." 
It was agreed that these misguided men 
should assemble at night on a certain spot ; first 
proceed to Lord Abberville's, to begin the work

of destruction, and then set fire to Springmount : 
and all this deliberate villainy was resolved with- 
out a feeling of compunction in themselves, or 
pity for those they had doomed to death. 
" Now that we Ve slept on it," said Rattling 
Bill, " I 'm glad that Grace Cassidy escaped 
last night, though IM have been glad her 
shilly-shally husband had been broiled on his 
own hearth, as all turncoats and informers de- 
sarve to be. But she 's a decent woman, and 
a purty woman, ay, and a modest woman too, 
and 'twould be a pity to kill her. When I went 
home and got to bed, the fumes of the whisky 
in my brain, and the recollection of the crack- 
ling flames and smoke in my memory, sure 
I had a quare dream : I dreamt we were all 
around the burning house, preventing the in- 
habitants from getting out of it, when the roof 
fell in, and I saw Grace Cassidy rise out of the 
smouldering ruins, and float in the air, with

bright wings to her shoulders, and a glory 
round her head. Grace has always a purty 
smile, just as if she smiled to please others 
more than herself; for it's melancholy like, 
though it 's so sweet. But in my dream it was 
ten times sweeter, and she said, ' Och ! boys, 
boys ! you 'd destroy me, but I 'd save you ! 
Turn from your evil courses, and repent, and 
I '11 be your guardian angel !' Sure with that 
she smiled again, and waved her wings, and 
a perfume finer than the finest flowers filled 
the air, and music, the softest and grandest 
too that ever I heard, came by on the wind, 
and I awoke  and awoke to think with horror 
and trembling, that she was burned. I 've 
seen blood shed, more than I ought to see. 
God forgive me ! But if you beheve me, the 
thoughts of this innocent creature, destroyed on 
her own hearth, and by her own neighbours, 
shocked me more than all I Ve ever seen : and

the big drops of perspiration burst from my 
forehead, and I seemed to hear her voice in 
every breeze. When I got up, and was tould 
she was safe at Springmount, I hugged the 
person that tould me, and I 'm determined now 
that a hair of Grace Cassidy's head shall not be 
harmed: so mind, boys, that every mother's 
soul of you keep a sharp look-out for Grace, 
that no mischief comes to her, happen what 
will ; for my dream wasn'^t sent me for nothing ; 
and as long as she's safe, IVe a notion, as 
the dream said, that she'll be our guardian 
angel." 
" Well, who ever expected to hear Rattling 
Bill minding dreams like an ould woman ?" said 
Gavin ; " sure nothing will surprise me after 
that r 
" I would not advise you to be after making

sleep we 're more under the influence of God, 
than when we 're awake ; for our evil passions 
are not tormenting us ; and he that dare doubt 
my courage, or compare me to an ould woman, 
should not live an hour after." 
" You mistake me, Bill," said Gavin, " I 'm 
not such a fool ; sure I might as well doubt the 
daylight as doubt your courage; so shake 
hands, my boy." 
" There's many a man here," said old Tim 
RafFerty, "that's as brave as Bill, no dispa- 
ragement to him neither, that has had dreams 
and warnings, and those are fools who slight 
'em, so I 'm for following Bill's advice, and 
not hurting a hair in Grace Cassidy's head. 
But let us not attack Springmount, unless 
we have a sufficient force, for them English 
lords and their servant, with the Curnel, and 
the servants of the house, make a great body 
of men."

" I 'm for letting the whole of 'em escape," 
said Rattling Bill, "and merely burning the 
house, for then we '11 get rid of 'em altogether 
without bloodshed." 
" Och ! sure if it's only the bloodshed you 
dislike," said Gavin, with a fiend-like smile, 
" there '11 be none of that, when they '11 be 
burned instead of being kilt." 
" You're always for the killing, Gavin," said 
Bill, " more shamp for you ; but in this case 
we '11 be guided by the votes of all the party 
when we assemble together." 
The family at Springmount and their 
guests, unmindful of the danger that threat- 
ened them, were consulting on the best mode 
of allaying the irritation in the neighbourhood, 
which the protection afforded to the Mahoneys 
and Cassidys had so powerfully excited. Lord 
Tadcaster offered to give the Mahoneys an 
asylum in England, by appointing the husband

gatekeeper to one of the entrances to his park, 
and Lord and Lady Oriel declared they would 
establish the Cassidys at Oriel Park. 
" This willingness to oblige is very amiable," 
said Mr. Desmond, " but recollect if we accept 
your proposals it will have the appearance of 
yielding to the system of intimidation these 
misguided men have been so long aiming to 
establish." 
" But, dear Mr. Desmond," said Lady Oriel, 
" even an apparent concession is better than 
risking the lives of the two poor families, 
and exposing yourself to the resentful fury of 
the people." 
" Let us wait a few days before we decide on 
any thing," said Mr. Desmond, ''as I am in 
hopes the presence of the military will deter 
the ill-disposed from any violent measures." 
While they were yet consulting, Lady 
Abberville was announced, and entered the 
library with all the bustling importance that

THE REPEALERS. 281 
marked her movements. After the custo- 
mary salutations, she began, '' Eh Men, Mes- 
sieurs et Mesdames, will you now acknow- 
ledge that the country is in a state of open 
rebellion ? I have been telling the Govern- 
ment so for the last two years ; but they are so 
obstinate that they will believe nothing till the 
mischief arrives. I know, Mr. Desmond, that 
you have considered me as an Alarmist, but the 
events of the last few days prove that I have 
been right, and you wrong. All this comes 
from not having barracks ; I always said what 
the inevitable consequences must be, but I 
must say I have been very ill supported by 
the gentry in my neighbourhood," (looking 
spitefully at Mr. Desmond and Colonel For- 
rester,) " but now they are attacked in their 
own houses, they must open their eyes to the 
necessity of keeping up a sufficient military 
force on the spot, which cannot be done with- 
out barracks. Since I saw you, I have ad-

vanced rapidly with my building, the masons 
have gone on surprisingly, the barrack is now 
two stories high ; I've been almost continually 
on the spot, and have been scarcely an hour off 
my horse ; the fatigue has been overpowering, 
but when the country is in danger it is the 
duty of every one to exert himself, and I know 
this barrack will be the saving of it, for hongrt 
malgre, the Government must buy it. Lord 
Abberville has written an official account of 
all the recent transactions to the Premier, for the 
Viceroy seems so absurdly incredulous, that it is 
useless writing to him ; and this morning, on 
hearing that your house had been attacked last 
night, we sent off a detailed statement, as we 
considered it the duty of Lord Abberville to 
send the first account." 
" You have been somewhat premature,''' said 
Mr. Desmond, " for my house has not been 
attacked, as my friends Lord Tadcaster and 
Oriel can certify."

" Well, that is very extraordinary,'' said 
Lady Abberville, with angry warmth, " as we 
were positively assured it had been. But if 
it has not, it will be, I dare say, which is 
a-peu-prh la mime chose, for my information 
is in general too correct to admit of my doubt- 
ing it, so prenez garde, mes amis, and don't 
count on your popularity, for I assure you, 
this is not the moment to remain quiet, when 
danger is at your door. I must be off to 
look how my bariack is going on, for the 
masons idle if I am not looking at them ; I 
make them work extra hours, which keeps 
them out of harm's way, and I hope a few 
weeks will soon finish the building. My stupid 
steward has been trying to persuade me that 
it will not be fit for occupation for some months, 
but this is all nonsense; I shall have it plas- 
tered and whitewashed the moment the walls 
are run up, and shall certainly advise its being

my project with the Government. Adieu, 
adieu, mes amis /' and away went the in- 
triguante.

CHAPTER XVII. 
" In thy fair brow there's such a legend writ 
Of chastity, as blinds the adult'rous eye ; 
Not the mountain's ice, 
Congeal'd to crystal, is so frosty chaste 
As thy victorious soul, which conquers man, 
And man's proud tyrant, passion." 
Lords Tadcaster and Oriel looked at each 
other with astonishment, when they heard the 
tirade of Lady Abberville ; and when she had 
withdrawn, they mutually congratulated each 
other, that England was free from such women. 
" What a nuisance she must be in a neigh-

bourhood !" said Lord Oriel to Mr. Desmond : 
" with all that extraordinary activity, mental 
and personal, that she possesses, turned to 
one account, selfish aggrandizement,  I cannot 
fancy a more disagreeable voisine ; then her 
effrontery is so glaring, her want of veracity so 
remarkable, and her system of jobbing so odious, 
that she makes one forget she is a woman.^' 
" Thirty years ago,'' said Mr. Desmond, 
" she would be httle disposed to pardon this 
oblivion of her sex ; for I date a dislike to me, 
which even her policy cannot prevent her from 
occasionally showing, to my neglect of the 
charms of the woman  for, strange to say, she 
once had charms  a neglect which originated 
in the disgust excited by the manoeuvres of 
the intriguante. I was to have been ruled, as 
she had ruled all the rest of her neighbours, by 
blandishments or diplomacy ; but both schemes 
failed, and the consequence is, she has never

THE REPEALERS. 287 
forgiven me. Every time I see her approach 
my wife and daughter, or the wives and daugh- 
ters of my friends, I think them profaned by 
her society ; knowing, as I do, the vileness 
of her character, and the mechancete of her 
nature. All this is universally allowed by all 
who know her, but by the assistance of sheer 
impudence, she has established herself in a forced 
position in society, though she is as generally an 
object of dislike as of dread to all who come in 
contact with her. Of her may it be said, 
" With that dull, rooted, callous impudence, 
Which, dead to shame, and every nicer sense, 
Ne'er blush'd, unless, in spreading vice's snares, 
She blunder'd on some virtue unawares." 
A poor girl, who acted as bar-maid at the 
Cat and Bagpipes, and to whom Grace Cassidy 
had shown kindness on more than one occasion, 
having overheard the threats vowed against 
Springmount and its inhabitants, thought it

right to apprize Grace of them, and stole out 
to give her the information. The dream of 
Rattling Bill, which made a deep impression 
on the superstitious mind of the girl, was not 
omitted. Grace having learned all that she could 
from Judy Mulvany, hastily dismissed her, and 
betook herself to a consultation with Mary Ma- 
honey on what steps it was best to pursue : the 
delicacy of both was deeply wounded at the 
idea of exposing their benefactors to such 
danger, and they agreed that this reflection was 
the most painful of all the sufferings inflicted 
on them. 
" We ought no longer to stay beneath their 
roof,'' said Grace, " for never should I know 
a happy moment, if any misfortune occurred 
here, of which the protection afforded to us 
was the cause. Dearly as I love Cologan and, 
God knows, its mountains, woods, and river, 
are, as it were, a part of myself, I would rather

THE REPEALERS. 289 
never see them again, than expose this dear 
good family to the risk of danger." 
" But where shall we go ?" said Mary Ma- 
honey, whose energies, weakened by bodily 
and mental suffering, were no longer capable of 
resisting as formerly the outrages of fortune. 
" No matter, dear Mary," said Grace, " any- 
where, provided that we draw not troubles on 
others." 
" You are right, Grace ma-vourneen," re- 
plied Mary, " we ought to go away, for it 
would be too cruel to have our benefactors 
suffer for us." 
" But how to skreen them from the danger 
that threatens at present," said Grace ; " if we 
tell the Master, he will have all the soldiers 
here, who will fire on, and kill the half, if not 
the whole, of these misguided men. Och ! it's 
terrible to think of, but something must be 
done, and done quickly." 
VOL. III. o

After a few minutes' pause, Grace said, 
" I '11 go myself to the meeting, and speak to 
'em ; but this must be kept a secret from Jim ; 
for he would either insist on going with me, 
which would spoil all, or prevent my going." 
" Och ! Grace a-vourneen, I tremble for you," 
said Mary Mahoney, " exposing yourself to the 
violence of these intemperate men. If I could 
go with you, I should be less afraid." 
" Fear no., my dear Mary,'' said Grace, " I 
shall be in the hands of God, and being alone, 
and totally unprotected before 'em, their pity 
will be more excited than their anger. My 
only fear is, the not being able to work on their 
feelings, but for myself I fear nothing." 
" Let us pray to the Almighty, in whose 
hands is the issue of all," said Mary, " for He 
alone can touch the hearts of these stubborn 
men." The two women knelt and prayed to- 
gether, with a fervency known only to those, who

THE REPEALERS. 291 
have no hope but in prayers, and both arose with 
calmed feehngs, and increased confidence, in 
that Power which alone can save. 
A thought had suggested itself to Grace. 
The dream of Ratthng Bill, which seemed not 
only to have made a deep impression on his 
mind, but on that of some of his partisans, as 
related by Judy Mulvany, might be turned to 
good account. Might not a deviation from 
truth, on such a momentous occasion, an occa- 
sion when the lives of so many of her fellow- 
creatures were at stake, be pardonable.? and 
yet, with the purity of her unsophisticated 
mind, she shrank from a falsehood, even to 
work good. 
" Och ! sure it 's like play-acting," said 
Grace, to herself, "and I don't like it; but 
what 's to be done ? I have no other means of 
saving 'em all, so God must forgive me, for 
taking advantage of Rattling Bill's dream."

Judy Mulvany having told her that the 
party were to assemble at a field near the Cat 
and Bagpipes, at twelve o'clock, Grace deter- 
mined to go there, and, as soon as her hus- 
band slept, to proceed on her perilous em- 
bassy. 
It may well be imagined, that the remainder 
of the day passed not without agitation to 
Grace ; and when she retired to rest, she 
counted with impatience the moments, until 
the heavy breathing of Jim should assure her 
that he slept. He fell into a doze, and she 
was on the point of stealing from her couch, 
when, at the first movement, he started from 
his slumber, and muttering, " Grace, Grace 
dear, donH leave me," grasped her arm. 
She trembled with emotion. How strange 
that he should wake at such a moment ! and 
still more strange, that he should ask her not 
to leave him ! But in a few minutes the

THE REPEALERS. 293 
heavy breathing of Jim assured her that he 
slept soundly, his hand relaxed its grasp of 
her arm, and she gently, and with noiseless 
step, left her bed. 
The moon-beams shed their light in the 
chamber, and Grace, ere she had courage to 
leave it, paused, to cast a parting look at her 
sleeping husband. " What if I should never 
see him again V thought Grace  and the blood 
froze at her heart! at the possibility  " Och, 
no, no ! God is good,'** cried she ; and, murmur- 
ing a blessing on the sleeper, and a prayer for 
herself, she left the room, and sought a closet 
near to it, where she had arranged the clothes 
in which she meant to attire herself. She put 
on a white dress, and wrapped a dark blue 
cloak over her person ; and, having let herself 
out of the house by the servants' offices, with 
trembling steps and a beating heart, repaired 
to the field pointed out to her by Judy Mul-

vany, stealing along by the side of the hedge 
for concealment. 
She found many persons already assembled, 
all armed, and a quantity of combustibles, 
heaped, ready for their wicked purpose. The 
sight of so many armed men, and~ the preci- 
sion with which they went through the differ- 
ent evolutions, at the command of Rattling 
Bill, aided by the reflection of her own utter 
helplessness, awed poor Grace, and she trem- 
bled as they approached her place of conceal- 
ment. But when Rattling Bill addressed them, 
every word of his speech thrilling on her ear, 
and increasing the pulsation of her heart, as 
she listened in breathless suspense, her terror for 
those so dear to her conquered all fears for self. 
"It is decided, boys," said Bill, "that 
Springmount is this night to be burned to 
the ground, but it is not yet decided whether its 
owners, and the Sassenachs who are with them,

THE REPEALERS. 295 
are to share its destruction : I have proposed to 
leave their fates to the votes of you all, so let 
those who wish to save them, cry ' yes,"* and 
those who doom them to death, cry ' no." " 
A silence as of the grave reigned for a 
moment, it was as if each felt the fearful re- 
sponsibility of his deliberation; hope arose in 
the breast of Grace, but it was only to be 
chilled the next moment. As the cry of death 
struck on her ear, the moon-beams fell on the 
face of Rattling Bill, and Grace remarked 
that an expression of sorrow and disappoint- 
ment paled his brow. 
" Do I hear right ?" asked Bill ; " do ye 
doom the family and their friends to death ?" 
" We do," was the reply, and her heart 
sank within her as she heard it. 
"Now then," thought Grace, "is the mo- 
ment ;" and, casting off her cloak, she rose up 
before the party, the moon casting its silver

radiance on her snowy drapery, and giving 
almost a celestial expression to her pallid face. 
" Boys, boys, you 'd destroy me, but I 'd 
save you. Turn from your evil courses, and 
repent, and let me be your guardian"  angel, 
she could not bring herself to add. 
" ^Tis her, 'tis her, just as she appeared in my 
dream !" said Bill, " and she shall be heard."*' 
A number of the men opposed her being 
listened to, and made cutting remarks on her 
presence ;  " She 's a play-actor,'' said one  
" Och ! she knows well enough what she 's 
about," said another. 
But the personal friends of Rattling Bill, 
and they were the most numerous, insisted on 
her being heard ; and Bill, with deep reverence, 
led her amongst them, forming a group of his 
most influential friends around her. 
" Why have you come here, Grace C as- 
sidy .?" asked Bill.

" The Almighty has put it into my heart," 
answered Grace  '' Who amongst you, friends 
and neighbours as you have been to me since my 
infancy," said Grace, " ever saw me forget the 
modesty of a woman, and come before you thus 
boldly even in the Hght of day ? then may you 
well believe, that I would not now, in the dead 
hour of night, venture alone, and unprotected 
before you, were I not commanded by a Power 
that quells fear. You stand on the edge of a fear- 
ful precipice, and can I, your own countrywo- 
man, your friend, and neighbour, do otherwise 
than try to save you ? I forget that you 've left 
me homeless, and a dependant on charity for 
a roof to cover my head ; I forget that you 
have stamped names of infamy on my husband, 
who has done nought but yield to my prayers of 
abandoning you  but who would never betray ; 
I forget that you are about to destroy those 
who have sheltered us in our hour of need ; 
o5

298 THE REPEALERS. 
I forget all, but that you are my friends and 
neighbours, and that I am commanded to save 
you. The troops are arrived, and are within 
call of Springmount. The family are on their 
guard ; any attempt to attack, or set fire to 
the house, must end in your total destruction. 
Be warned, and rush not on your ruin." 
" She is right!" burst from several voices ; 
" it's no good attempting it ! Sure, she's sent 
here by God to warn us ! Doesn't this prove 
there was sense in Rattling Bill's dream ?" 
Grace smiled at observing how well her plan 
worked on their superstitious feelings ; and Bill, 
no longer master of himself, cried out, " Look 
at her, look at her !  I '11 swear there she is, 
standing just for all the world, barring she has 
not the wings to her shoulders, as she appeared 
in my dream, with just the same smile, and not 
a step will I or my friends take against her 
advice."

*' That we won't, that we won't !'' was echoed 
around. But Gavin, and a few more of the 
most discontented of the party, murmured 
that it was hard to have come there for no- 
thing ; and that, " after all, ould Desmond and 
his Sassenach son-in-law were their enemies, 
and ought to be punished."" 
" You know not what you utter,"' said Grace ; 
" but if you knew the goodness, the mildness, 
and the mercy of the master and his son, as 
I do, ye would lay down your lives to serve 
him, instead of being here at this hour plotting 
to destroy him. Whom did he ever injure, and 
whom is it that he has not served ? You have 
all turned against him, because ye are ashamed 
to look at his noble face and grey locks after 
your ingratitude. Boys, boys ! where are the 
fine manly, honest Irish hearts that were an 
honour to the country  hearts that were full of 
love and loyalty ?  and what has Mr. Desmond

300 THE REPEALERS. 
done to turn ye ? Tell me one single example 
of tyranny or bad usage that ever he has been 
guilty of? No, you cannot; but how many 
acts of generosity, charity, and mercy could 
I bring to your minds ! I repeat to you that 
I am commanded to warn ye. I have done my 
duty, let the rest be on your own heads. I 
call God to witness that neither the family at 
Springmount, nor my husband, know that 1 
am come amongst you ;  oh, let me not have 
come in vain ! " 
They consulted for some time together, and 
the voice of Bill and his friends were heard, 
drowning those of Gavin and his adherents. 
A dozen of the former, headed by Bill, ap- 
proached Grace, and addressed her in the fol- 
lowing terms. 
" Grace Cassidy, we believe, and we have 
private reasons of our own for it, that you have 
been marked out by Providence to save us.
## p. 301 (#311) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 301 
We will follow your advice  no injury shall be 
done to Mr. Desmond or his property  and 
you may return, with the happy thought of 
having saved many lives.'' 
A smile of joy and gratitude illumined the 
face of Grace ; and Bill again cried out, " There 
she is! with just the same smile, and all, bar- 
ring the wings, just as I saw her in my dream ! " 
Bill and his friends conducted Grace to the 
entrance at Springmount, with as much re- 
spectful deference as if she was the mistress 
of that mansion ; for, in addition to the respect 
her virtue, modesty, and courage excited, was 
now joined a superstitious reverence, attached 
to her in consequence of Bill's dream, and her 
appearance and words so exactly corresponding 
with it. 
When Grace found herself once more safe 
beneath the roof of Mr. Desmond, she threw 
herself on her knees, overpowered by the

S02 THE REPEALERS. 
various emotions she had gone through, and 
filled with joy and gratitude at having been 
made the humble instrument of saving the 
family, she poured forth her thanksgivings to 
the Almighty power that had guided and pro- 
tected her. She arose from prayer with calmed 
feelings, and having sought the pillow of the 
watchful and agitated Mary Mahoney, pressed 
her hand, and whispered, " I am safe, and we 
are all saved, God be thanked ! Breathe not a 
word of what I have done to mortal ! " and she 
glided from the chamber to seek the repose her 
exhausted frame and spirits so much required. 
She found her husband asleep, unconscious 
of her nocturnal ramble ; and as she pressed her 
pillow, she again thanked the Almighty for the 
security with which she could now court repose. 
When Bill and his friends left Gavin and 
his discontented associates, they looked at each 
other with bitter mockery. "And so, after
## p. 303 (#313) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. SOS 
all," said Gavin, " we 've come on a fool's er- 
rand, and there '11 be no burning ; and all 
bekase Rattling Bill is turned out a dreamer, 
and Grace Cassidy comes here with her palaver 
to turn us from our work. Be my soul, this is 
what I call quare goings on ! I was thinking, 
all the time she was preaching to them fools 
that minded her, that I 'd like to shy a stone at 
her and stop her potato trap for coming to spoil 
our divarsion." 
" We must not go against Rattling Bill," 
said another of the party. 
" No, no ! " was repeated around, " we will 
not go against him ; and you may say what ye 
will, but the dream was a mighty quare dream, 
and Bill did right to mind it." 
" So he did," repeated several voices, " and 
we'll stick to Bill." 
'* But isn't it too bad for us to go home like 
fools," said Gavin, " without having done any-

thing ? Sure, I know a nice bit of mischief we 
could do, if we set off before Bill and the boys 
comes back, and there 's no dream to prevent it/' 
*' What 's that ? Tell us at onc't," cried a 
dozen voices. 
" Well then,'' said Gavin, " let us go and 
burn down the new barrack that ould cat Lady 
Abberville is building; she that's making the 
poor masons work extra hours, but never gives 
'em an extra halfpenny. Ay, ay, my boys, let 
us be off, and to work ; for sure it would be a 
pity to let all our iligant materials for setting 
fire be lost." 
The desire for executing this new project of 
mischief spread like lightning among the party, 
and ere five minutes from its being first pro- 
posed, they were on their road to put it into 
execution. 
Having kindled the flames at every side of 
the barrack, "Sure," said Gavin, "it's a pity
## p. 305 (#315) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 305 
we don't burn the house over the heads of 
the ould jobbers ; the bloodsuckers, that 's been 
living on the plunder of the country for years  
ay, and often set us on to mischief too, by 
underhand encouragement, just for her own 
ends." 
" Yes, yes, let us set fire to the house," cried 
all the party; and they quickly proceeded to 
Lord Abberville's, and as quickly set fire to 
different parts of the house and offices, which 
soon sent forth a blaze, which was hailed with 
joy by the incendiaries. 
The flames increased every moment, and em- 
braced every side of the mansion, before the 
inmates were aware of their danger. The ser- 
vants rushed through the burning doors, utter- 
ing piercing shrieks ; but no one thought of 
rescuing the unpopular master or mistress, who 
awoke not until all retreat by the stairs was im- 
practicable ; and they appeared at the windows

306 THE REPEALERS. 
frantic with terror, and demanding assistance 
with cries of distraction and anguish. 
Gavin mocked at their sufferings and mi- 
micked their movements, and when some of his 
less ferocious companions proposed saving them 
by putting a ladder to the window, he would 
not permit it. 
A few minutes more must have been fatal 
to them, when a dozen men rushed forward 
with ladders, and the one who led them placing 
four at their base, and six to guard an open 
space, two mounted the ladders and rescued 
the agonized Lord and Lady Abberville from 
their perilous position, amid the cheers of some 
of those who, a few minutes before, would have 
equally cheered the destruction of the persons 
now saved. Such is the mobility of the natures 
of this inconstant people ! 
Having seen Grace Cassidy safely housed at 
Springmount, Rattling Bill and his associates
## p. 307 (#317) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 307 
were returning to their homes, when the lurid 
flames of the barrack mounting towards the 
sky, attracted their attention. 
" What can it be ?" said one. " Sure, it 's in 
the direction of Lord Abberville's," cried ano- 
ther. " Let us go directly," said Rattling Bill, 
" and help to extinguish the flames. " 
They rapidly pursued their course across the 
fields, and arrived only in time to see the crum- 
bling walls of the barrack totter and fall to 
the ground, and the mansion of Lord Abber- 
ville blazing in the distance. They flew, rather 
than ran ; and having seized the ladders in the 
garden, placed them against the burning walls 
of the house, and assisted the terrified Lord 
and Lady to descend. Rattling Bill was the 
hero on this occasion, and without his services 
the owners of the burning pile must have min- 
gled their ashes with those of their residence. 
All their personal property was lost. They

had not even garments to cover them ; and the 
wretched couple, covered with the great coats 
of the compassionate peasantry, sat on the steps 
of the green-house, sending back reproaches 
to each other. 
" Eh bien, Milor/' said Lady Abberville, 
" you see what your obstinacy has brought on 
us ! I always said your continued betises could 
not fail to draw mischief and trouble on us.'" 
" You forget," said Lord Abberville, " how 
unpopular your eternal intrigues and manoeu- 
vres have rendered you ; and I dare be sworn, 
that the dislike of the peasantry to i/ou, and 
not to me, is the cause of this fearful outrage." 
" Par exemple,"*^ said the angry lady, " 1 give 
you joy of this new discovery ; but you always 
were bite, and bite you '11 continue to the end 
of the chapter." 
The irritated Lord, provoked beyond en- 
durance, cried out to the crowd, " Tell me,
## p. 309 (#319) ############################################
THE REPEALERS. 309 
boys, whether you have been instigated to fire 
my house by your disUke to me ?'*' 
" No, no!'' was repeated by nearly all the 
persons present. 
" I told you so," said Lord Abberville, turn- 
ing with an air of triumph to his wife; " so 
you see. Lady Abberville, it was their dishke 
to you that prompted them.*" 
" No, this I will never believe!" said Lady 
Abberville, " for I know they despise you. 
Tell me," said the angry lady, " what led you 
to the injury you have done us ?'"* 
" Why then, if you must know,"" said Rat- 
tUng Bill, " it was contempt of your husband, 
and dislike of yourself. We have looked upon 
him as a weak fool in your hands, but we Ve 
considered you as something worse  an artful, 
designing rogue.**' 
The rage of both may be easily imagined : 
that of the husband was the more concentrated ;

310 THE REPEALERS. 
but the anger of the wife evaporated in spe- 
culations of the claim this outrage would give 
them on the Government. 
" Mind, Lord Abberville," said Miladi ; 
" that you swear all my diamonds, ' the family 
diamonds', were destroyed : few people know 
that they were melted long ago, and that paste 
supplied their place ; you must, therefore, talk 
of their value, with a lengthened face, and a 
woful shake of the head. The plate, the ' fa- 
mily plate,' too, must figure in alto relievo in 
our schedule of losses : you must dwell on the 
quantity and massiveness of it ; you cannot say 
too much, for recollect you are only making 
a substantive of what was merely a participle ; 
and between plate and plated there is little dif- 
ference, except to the buyer and seller. If 
you play your cards well, we may turn this 
night's adventure to a profitable account, and 
a burned house may prove a richer argosy than

we have ever yet freighted. Our picture gal- 
lery, (with half-a-dozen vile copies,) our library, 
(with a hundred or two bad novels,) may be ad 
infinitum swelled into a collection of splendid 
pictures, as unique from their quantity as their 
quality ; and the books, the combined re- 
searches of generations, of the literature of all 
countries. Our furniture, (the ruined heir- 
looms of our ancestors,) unseemly to sight, and 
unfit for use, may be magnified into the most 
costly and elegant meubles, uniting the splen- 
dour of the reign of Louis Quatorze, with all 
the convenience of modern refinement. I hope 
our remise and ecuries are burnt down, for that 
will allow of our adding the splendid establish- 
ment of horses, (consisting of two hacks, and 
a pair of spavined carriage-horses,) to the list 
of our losses, with the elegant carriages, for 
which Lord and Lady Abberville had long 
been distinguished."

Heartless as was Lord Abberville, he shrank 
from the calculating coldness of his wife, who, 
in a few minutes after her escape from a fear- 
ful death, was plotting the falsehoods, most 
likely to render the danger she had escaped 
from, profitable ; but the intriguante had as 
completely lost sight of past danger, in her 
plans of rendering it advantageous to her fu- 
ture prospects, as if it had occurred years, 
instead, of a few minutes before. 
The moment the roof fell in with a crash, 
Gavin and his friends shouted in triumph, and, 
the work of destruction being now completed, 
retired from the scene of action. Little did 
they imagine that the mistress of the burning 
ruins hailed their destruction with even more 
joy than they did ; had they suspected it, their 
triumph would have been damped. 
A servant was dispatched to Springmount 
to announce the catastrophe that had taken

place ; and in due time a carriage, laden with 
pelisses and great coats, arrived to bear the 
Lord and Lady to the hospitable roof of Mr. 
Desmond, where they experienced all the kind- 
ness to which their circumstances, rather than 
their merits, entitled them. i 
Before leaving his dressing-room next morn- 
ing, a letter was delivered to Mr. Desmond 
from Rattling Bill, in which, with the frank- 
ness that characterised his nature, he detailed 
the intentions of the Repealers to set fire to 
Springmount the night before, and to sacrifice 
its inhabitants to the flames. He stated that 
to the courageous conduct of Grace Cassidy 
they owed their safety, and that, knowing the 
modesty of her feelings, a sense of justice pre- 
vented him from allowing the part she had taken 
in the last night''s adventures to remain con- 
cealed.

" Grace Cassidy has opened my eyes,*" wrote 
Bill, " to the delusion I have indulged in, 
when I believed you, honored Sir, to be our 
enemy. The veil has dropped from my sight, 
and I deplore my errors ; but, having violated 
the laws, I fly from Ireland, to seek in Ame- 
rica that peace which my own folly has de- 
prived me of here. Before I go, I have exacted 
a promise from those over whom I had in- 
fluence, never to harm you or yours ; I know 
they will be faithful to it, and I also know 
that you will repay the pure and fearless wo- 
man who has saved your lives, and preserved 
from crime, 
" Your now faithful Servant, 
" Bill Donovan.'' 
Mr. Desmond sent to Grace Cassidy to meet 
him in the library, as soon as he had perused 
Rattling Bill's letter, and when he saw the diffi-

dent looks and bashful countenance of Grace, 
as she presented herself before him, he could 
hardly believe that it was this timid woman who 
had braved the presence of a riotous rabble 
the night before, to save him and his family. 
" Grace," said Mr. Desmond, taking her 
hand, " I know all that you did last night, 
and I shall never forget it." 
" Och ! dear master,"" said Grace, her cheeks 
becoming suffused with a tint that rivalled the 
rose, " who tould you ? Sure it was nothing 
at all, for what was a life like mine compared 
to yours, and the dear Mistress and Mrs. For- 
rester's ? and then it was worth while risking 
twenty lives to show these poor misguided men 
that they were wrong. Excuse my freedom 
for daring to speak so boldly before you, 
honored Sir, but after my husband and your 
dear blessed family, sure I feel my next duty 
is to my poor misguided, but always dear

countrymen. The most insignificant person 
may serve his country, as the mouse gave 
liberty to the lion by gnawing the meshes of 
the net that entangled him, and therefore I took 
courage to speak the truth to thosel love." 
" Come with me, my good Grace, to the 
breakfast-room," said Mr. Desmond, " that all 
the company may know to whom they owe 
their lives." 
*' Och ! please. Sir, to excuse me," said 
Grace, " I only did my duty, and, above all, 
my husband does not yet know that I left 
his side last night, and I beg, honored Sir, 
you will not mention it till he knows it." 
Mr. Desmond sent for Jim Cassidy, that he 
might have the pleasure of telling him of the 
heroism and admirable conduct of his wife ; 
though Grace blushed a rosy red, when the 
master lavished on her the epithet she so well 
deserved.

But no sooner was Jim made sensible of 
what she had done, to the details of which 
he listened with open eyes, ears, and mouth, 
than he ran to Grace, and falling on his knees, 
while the tears coursed each other down his 
cheeks, he exclaimed, his voice broken by sobs, 
" Yes, Sir, she's a blessed woman, and a guar- 
dian angel to all she loves ; but I, I 'm not 
worthy to belong to her, and I know it, I feel 
it, for all she's so loving and kind to me." 
Grace, unrestrained by the presence of Mr. 
Desmond, threw herself into the arms of her 
husband, and, while pressing him to her heart, 
said, " Don't say so, dear, dear Jim, for if 
there 's more good in my heart than in the hearts 
of other women, it's the warm love for you that 
has brought it out, just as the sun brings out 
the flowers of the earth." 
Mr. Desmond insisted on leading Grace to 
the breakfast-room, where he briefly informed

the party that, if they were all assembled there 
in safety, they owed it to the heroism of Grace 
Cassidy. The compliments and commenda- 
tions she received on all sides, deeply embar- 
rassed her ; but the warm shakes of the hand 
of the dear ould Mistress, Mrs. Forrester, and 
Ladies Oriel and Tadcaster, encouraged her. 
Lady Abberville interrupted their commen- 
dations, to reproach Grace for not having saved 
her house and property, instead of allowing her 
diamonds, plate, furniture, pictures, library, 
horses, and carriages, to be consumed. 
Mr. and Mrs. Desmond looked at her with 
astonishment, at hearing the recapitulation of 
this catalogue raisonnee of her losses, having 
frequently observed the paucity of even the 
common comforts of life in her mansion ; and 
both felt inclined to smile, as .ae speculation 
of the intriguante was exposed to them. 
Mr. Desmond and Colonel Forrester fixed 
a comfortable annuity on Grace Cassidy, her

husband, and their future offspring : and the 
Lords and Ladies Tadcaster and Oriel sub- 
scribed a considerable sum to be vested for her 
use. But, when Grace heard of it, she en- 
treated that it might be appropriated to the 
wants of Patrick and Mary Mahoney, charged 
with a small provision for Larry Macswiggan. 
This generosity encreased the admiration 
the whole party felt for her ; and though her 
wishes of providing for the Mahoney s and Larry 
Macswiggan were carried into effect, her bene- 
factors insisted that the sum they had sub- 
scribed for Grace should be appropriated 
wholly to her use. 
Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester, in due time, 
gave birth to sons ; Lord Oriel's restored hap- 
piness soon banished his too great suscepti- 
bility, and ht is now considered to be one 
of the happiest husbands in England, as is 
Lady Oriel one of the happiest wives. 
Lady Tadcaster is pronounced to be as fault-

less a wife as daughter, and her friends rejoice in 
her happiness ; and Lady Delmore is once more 
on the point of approaching the hymeneal altar, 
with better prospects of happiness, being led to 
it by the good Duke of Bridgenorth. Grace 
Cassidy has given birth to a daughter, to whom 
Lady Oriel and Mrs. Forrester stood sponsors. 
and the village of Cologan looks, and is, more 
flourishing than ever. 
Repealers are no more heard of; they have 
died a natural death : and the Union between 
England and Ireland bids fair to become everv 
day more indissoluble, by the strengthening of 
the strongest of all bonds of union  favours 
conferred, and gratitude excited.
